He was known before that to insiders at the Moscow Conservatory, where he performed some of his early piano works. An opera, however, based on Alexander Pushkin’s brilliant narrative poem Tsygany (The Gypsies, 1824), was an important musical event. By the time the young composer reached his twentieth birthday, on 2 April 1893, rehearsals were already under way. Aleko was never imagined as a career-launching move, but that is what it turned out to be. It was composed in 1892 as a final diploma project at the Conservatory. The libretto, patchily contrived for pedagogical purposes by the Moscow critic and dramaturge Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko, invited comparison, in its verismo plot of jealousy and murderous revenge, with Mascagni’s Cavalleria rusticana, a recent hit at the Bolshoi (for details, see Richard Taruskin: “Aleko,” The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, 1992). Given a deadline of one month to write the opera, Rachmaninoff (the only one of the three seniors in the class to finish the job on time) submitted the score in less than three weeks (for exact dates, see T/N, 178-80). The result was quite astonishing: not only did it make good use of specifically “Russian” and “oriental” musical strategies worked out by Glinka, Borodin, Tchaikovsky, and others, but it contained choral and solo numbers with original, well-crafted melodies. The performance at the Bolshoi Theater was given on 27 April 1893, with lead singers and the Bolshoi’s principal conductor, Ippolit Altani. Some of the arias were sung and later recorded by famous singers, with Feodor Chaliapin first and foremost (Chaliapin recorded Aleko’s cavatina in 1923 in Hayes and 1930 in London). In our own day, baritone Mariusz Kwiecien included it on his compact disc “Slavic Heroes” (2011). The opera brought Rachmaninoff early fame: Tchaikovsky found him a publisher, and mentored him during rehearsals; the Kiev Opera invited the composer to conduct it there, which he did in October 1893; and in St. Petersburg, Rimsky-Korsakov himself conducted the “Dance of the Gypsy Girls” at a Russian Symphony concert in December 1894. In a special performance in St. Petersburg on the centenary of Pushkin’s birth in May 1899, Chaliapin sang the lead part, with “true suffering in his sobs at the end,” according to the composer (LN 1, 290). Beyond Russia, audiences first heard music by Rachmaninoff in December 1893, when his cousin, the celebrated pianist Alexander Siloti, performed the First Piano Concerto in Wiesbaden and Frankfurt. The German reviewers heard echoes of Chopin, Liszt, and Grieg in the piano writing but failed to\n\nxii\n\nPreface\n\ngrasp the “Russian” character of the music (Keldysh, 79). In 1895, Rachmaninoff was discovered in the West in a major and lasting way. That is when Siloti first played the “Prelude in C-sharp Minor” in London. Once heard, the public demanded Siloti play it without fail in every recital in England and Scotland, and later in 1898 in New York, Boston, and Chicago (Barber, 55-70). Rachmaninoff himself played it in England on his first tour abroad in 1899. Eventually he came to regret its popularity, as he was expected to play “it” (as the piece was called in the newspapers) after every piano recital. For decades in the twentieth century, this short work of 1892 was widely considered to be the best known piano composition ever written. Today Rachmaninoff is universally known as a composer of major works for piano and orchestra which have a permanent place in the concert repertoire, especially his Second Concerto (1900-01), his Third Concerto (1909), and his “Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini” (1934). He is admired for many other works too, among them his Second Symphony with its sweeping Adagio (190608), and his singularly moving “All-Night Vigil” (sometimes called “Vespers,” for four-part unaccompanied mixed chorus, 1915). In his solo piano works he stands with Chopin and Liszt. Only his songs remain less well known, especially outside Russia, although this is changing today as younger singers discover them and learn to sing them in Russian. Rachmaninoff’s eighty-three songs, or “románsy” as they are called in Russian, include some of his finest and most memorable music. The “romances” come out of the Russian current of the great nineteenth-century stream of Romantic song that goes back to Beethoven and Schubert. Like German Lieder and French mélodies, they are songs written to be sung by one singer, with a piano accompaniment especially composed for the song. Instead of writing the words, the composer customarily chooses a lyric poem or other text and sets it to music by writing a voice part and a piano part. The success of Aleko owed something to Rachmaninoff the youthful songwriter—to his love of drama, skill in crafting melodies, originality in writing declamatory parts for voice, and supreme pianistic gifts. His best early compositions are piano pieces and songs. The purpose of this book is to collect and translate the lyrics of all the songs written by Sergei Rachmaninoff, and to comment on their musical realization. The texts are presented in their entirety, as they appear in each song, in the original Russian (there is one early song in French). These are followed by a transcription of the Russian words in the Latin alphabet, and, printed line by line alongside it, a translation into plain, unrhymed English. My translations are not “singing” versions, but they will allow a reader who does not know Russian to listen to a song and follow the words from start to finish as they are sung.\n\nPreface\n\nxiii\n\nThe order of the songs and the consecutive numbering of them used here follow the 1957 Moscow edition of Rachmaninoff’s songs Romansy: Polnoe sobranie (“Romances: Complete Collection,” abbreviated PSR). A new academic edition of Rachmaninoff’s complete works in some fifty volumes is being undertaken jointly by the Central State Glinka Museum in Moscow and Russian Music Publishers (with Bärenreiter-Verlag in Germany), but as of this writing only two volumes of piano works have been issued. Valentin Antipov, the editor of these volumes, told me in Moscow in 2007 that preparation of the songs had not begun, because a “textologist” had not yet been found. The present volume is an attempt to establish the lyrics of Rachmaninoff’s songs as accurately as possible. The research was carried out over a dozen years, including visits to many libraries in Moscow and elsewhere to track down the various publications of the texts Rachmaninoff used in his songs. In my research I found a number of errors which are corrected here, including a bowdlerized lyric (Song 53), which was censored in the Soviet period and rewritten to remove religious language. I claim no originality in matters of musical interpretation. Historical and descriptive information—poets or other authors of the text, dates, other settings of the text, key signatures, voice range, and so on—is provided at the end of each song. Recordings of the song are also listed there, by the singer’s last name (or the full names of each instrumentalist, in cases of transcriptions, which are abundant in several of Rachmaninoff’s songs). At the back of the book, further information about the singers and a list of the songs recorded by each of them are placed together in an Index of Singers. Throughout the book, in lieu of footnotes, the names of works cited are given in italics, with page numbers as necessary. Information about sources will be found in the Bibliography; major sources are also described in the “List of Abbreviations” on pages xxi-xxii. Rachmaninoff’s song texts have been collected and translated into English once before, in The Singer’s Rachmaninoff, compiled by Natalia Challis (New York, 1989). That was a useful volume, but it is now out of print; it repeats some stubborn errors, and uses an inaccurate system of phonetic transcriptions. Singers who want to see a correct phonetic transcription of the songs should consult the excellent manual by Professor Laurence R. Richter, Rachmaninov’s Complete Song Texts (Leyerle Publications, Geneseo, New York, 2000). His book also contains literal and idiomatic English translations, making it a new and up-to-date singer’s manual for Rachmaninoff’s songs. My book may be used as a reference to find information about a particular song, but it can also be read as a continuous narrative. Each group of songs is preceded by a short section about Rachmaninoff’s life, ideas, and contacts in the artistic world during his twenty-six years as a composer of romansy. He had connections, sometimes very close ones, with leading figures of the\n\nxiv\n\nPreface\n\n“Silver Age” of Russian art at the turn of the twentieth century. He knew the writers Anton Chekhov, Maxim Gorky, and Ivan Bunin. He knew theater people, including Savva Mamontov at the “Private Opera” and Vladimir Teliakovsky, director of the Imperial Theaters, both of whom hired him as a conductor. He knew Konstantin Stanislavsky at the Moscow Art Theater, and Sergei Diaghilev, who brought him to Paris to take part in his first “Saison Russe” in 1907. He worked with Feodor Chaliapin and other singers of his generation (to whom he dedicated some of his songs), and concert organizers like Alexander Siloti and Serge Koussevitzky. I hope some glimpses into these relationships will humanize Rachmaninoff, too often thought of as a dour and humorless man, “a six-and-a-half-foot-tall scowl” in the words of Igor Stravinsky. As in my book about Tchaikovsky’s songs (TCS), the aim of the commentary is to illuminate the composer’s professional life, his life as an artist. Both men were born into loving, extended families, but, unlike Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff had a successful marriage and was at peace in his private life. As professionals the two men were exceptionally disciplined and stood out in their insistence on the highest artistic standards. As a composer, Tchaikovsky was inexhaustibly gifted, and he accomplished more. As a musician, however, Rachmaninoff was gifted in more ways, and was torn between three callings. He wanted first and foremost to compose. When he had to learn to conduct early in his life in order to find a job, he became (like Gustav Mahler, a contemporary he greatly admired) an outstanding conductor. When he left Russia in 1917, already famous as a pianist, he honed his skills, learned new repertoire, and practiced every day to be able to give recitals to support his family. A recent assessment of his place as a pianist in his lifetime is one by Alex Ross, who wrote, in a New Yorker review of recordings of the “hundred greatest” pianists of the 20th century, “The most immediately impressive volumes are those in which a player’s personality swamps every piece on the program. The lord of them all is probably Rachmaninoff. Of the Slavic pianists who fill the twentieth-century pantheon, Horowitz may have produced more electricity and Paderewski more tears, but Rachmaninoff is the one who pins you in your chair with the force of his mind” (Ross 1999). Rachmaninoff always thought of his songs as performances coming out of and written for a specifically Russian milieu. After he left Russia, for good, at the end of 1917, he wrote no more songs.\n\nxv\n\nAcknowledgments First, I wish to thank Malcolm Hamrick Brown, founding editor of Russian Music Studies, who encouraged my work on this project from the first time we met in New York to discuss it. For his sage advice and unfailing support I am deeply grateful. My thanks extend to the wise and steady Director of Indiana University Press, Janet Rabinowitch, and to her editorial staff, whose bright and ready responses have eased my way and made the production of the book a pleasant task. Part of my research for this book was supported by travel grants from the Colgate University Faculty Research Council in October 1996 and January 2000, and a summer grant in May 1998 from the International Research & Exchanges Board, with funds provided by the U. S. Department of State (Title VIII program) and the National Endowment for the Humanities. I thank them all for their generosity and trust, and I assume sole responsibility for the views expressed in this book. My colleagues at Colgate University helped and encouraged me in many important ways, especially Alice Nakhimovsky, Nancy Ries, Matt and Denise Leone, Albert and Rebecca Ammerman, Jane Pinchin, Anthony Aveni, Chris Vecsey, and Tim Byrnes. I am also grateful to the staff of the Colgate Library, especially to the resourceful Ann Ackerson, head of Interlibrary Loan. It was an inspiration to work in the hallowed reading rooms of the Slavic and Baltic Division of the New York Public Library, the Library of Congress, and the State Lenin Library in Moscow. Libraries at Stanford and Cornell, and Bird Library and the Belfer Audio Archive at Syracuse University, made me welcome and offered ready assistance. I owe a special thanks to Robert Hodge, who played rare vocal recordings for me at the Belfer Archive. In Moscow, Vyacheslav Nechayev, Director of the Library of the Union of Theatrical Workers, and his staff welcomed me during various projects for more than twenty-five years in their historic reading room on Strastnoi Boulevard located a block away from Rachmaninoff’s Moscow apartment (the room was originally the university typography, where Crime and Punishment was first printed). At the Moscow Conservatory Library, Lyudmila Dedyukina cheerfully supplied books and cuttings from journals and newspapers of the pre-1917 period. Eleonora Mamedova-Sokolova and the late Nikolai Sokolov of the Chaliapin Museum have been resourceful and valued friends in all matters pertaining to the Russian vocal scene. Irina Medvedeva of the Glinka Museum welcomed this project and allowed me access to their Rachmaninoff archive. To Alexander Abramovich Makarov, a friend of many years and son of the renowned accompanist Abram Makarov, I am grateful for personal introductions\n\nxvi\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nto Konstantin Lisovsky, Tatyana and Olga Reizen, and Zara Dolukhanova: to each of them I owe thanks for their warm hospitality and readiness to answer my questions about performing Rachmaninoff’s songs. For information about recordings not in my own collection, I am greatly indebted to Donald Seibert, Greg Audette, Victor Han, and Richard Kummins, who have been generous in sharing their records and knowledge with me. Ian Harvey, in addition to sharing recordings over many years, has faithfully kept me up to date on new recordings and performances of Rachmaninoff’s songs. Nancy Ries inspired me throughout my work, sharing her ideas and insights with me in Moscow and in Hamilton. Laurel Fay and David Cannata gave me invaluable advice at the beginning stage of my work. Donald Seibert, Ronald Rebholz, Joseph Miller, and Nancy Ries read portions of the manuscript and brought their wisdom to fundamental issues of interpretation and presentation. I was inspired by friends of many years who expressed interest and support: Edward Lobb, Charlotte Douglas, Joseph and Susan Higgins, Stuart Anthony, Will Rogers, Anne Gregory, and many of my former students. I owe very much to friends in Moscow and Novgorod who listened to the songs and shared their ideas with me: Svetlana Golybina, Nina Drozdetskaya, Olga Kazakova, Galina Krasnova, Natalia Kulakova, and my dear friend and partner Vasily Petyarkin. I am indebted to Rimgaila Salys, author of the catalogue of Leonid Pasternak’s Russian years (see Salys in the Bibliography), who put me in touch with the Pasternak family in Oxford and Moscow. Dr. Ann Slater-Pasternak, on behalf of The Pasternak Trust in Oxford, graciously permitted me to use Leonid Pasternak’s portrait of the composer as an illustration for the book. This book would not have been written had it not been for the collaboration of Joseph Miller, wisest of friends. He originally showed me the need for such a book of texts of Russian songs with parallel translations. Since then he has given selflessly of his time and companionship while reading and editing the manuscript, making each page better: il miglior fabbro. R. D. S. Hamilton, New York April 2013\n\nxvii\n\nA Note on Dates and Spelling Before 1918, the Julian Calendar (“Old Style”) was used in Russia and is still used by the Russian Orthodox Church. The Gregorian Calendar (“New Style”) was adopted in February 1918: this moved the calendar ahead by thirteen days, or twelve in the 19th century. Dates in this book are given in Old Style if the event took place in Russia before 1918, and in New Style if outside Russia or after 1918. Except in the Bibliography, where authors and titles are transliterated according to the simplified Library of Congress system, Russian names are spelled in this book as we are used to seeing them, even if that entails some inconsistencies. For example, Tchaikovsky and Chekhov begin with the same Cyrillic letter, but I have retained the older spelling for Tchaikovsky’s name because it is more familiar than “Chaikovsky.” In cases of individual artists who adopted a non-standard spelling, I use that: Rachmaninoff (not Rakhmaninov), Chaliapin (not Shaliapin). Names of artists are spelled as they would be in a concert program or recording: Hvorostovsky (not Khvorostovski). In the narrative, first names common to both English and Russian are spelled as in English: Alexander, not Aleksandr; at the bottom of each song, however, where the author’s name is given, the full name is spelled in a more exact transliteration with stress marks: Aleksándr Sergéyevich Púshkin. To follow the words of a song as sung on recordings or in performance, a reader who does not already know Russian needs a phonetic transcription of the words rather than a transliteration. With each song, there is a phonetic transcription of the lyric in Latin letters, side by side with a translation into English. The purpose of these parallel texts is to enable readers who do not know Russian to follow the words, and what they mean, as they are being sung. My transcriptions are an attempt to show better than the LC system what the words actually sound like. In my transcription, the composer’s name would be spelled “Chajkófskij,” and the writer would be “Chékhaf.” Unlike transliteration, these spellings show the automatic changes that take place in voicing and devoicing of consonants, and in reduction of the vowel “o” to “a” when it is not stressed. They also show which syllable in the word is stressed, a feature that stands out very strongly in spoken Russian, less so when it is sung. First, and most important, is the sound “j” (called “yot” from Greek “iota”). It is exceedingly common in Russian. This is not “j” as in English or Spanish, but the sound “y” in “you,” “bayou,” or “boy.” When it begins a word, the reader should interpret the letter “j” in transcriptions of songs in this book as sounding like the German “Johann,” never like French Jean, Spanish Juan, or English John.\n\nxviii\n\nA Note on Dates and Spelling\n\nI retain the LC convention of an apostrophe for the “soft sign” used in Russian spelling. Its use has nothing to do with the meaning of an apostrophe in English, but indicates that the letter it follows is “softened” or made with the palate (“palatalized”). When following words being sung, it may be ignored. In words where spelling and speaking are at variance, the transcription shows the sound rather than the spelling for obvious reasons. There are few such cases in Russian, but they occur in some very common words and endings. I have kept the LC convention of using “y” to stand for the tense Russian vowel that is a variant of “i” as in “Bill” or “wit,” only deeper. To master this sound, one needs to work with a Russian speaker. For an amusing illustration of the facial contortions required to pronounce this vowel in a loud voice from the rostrum of the Hall of Columns in Moscow, see the photograph of Nicolas Slonimsky in his autobiography Perfect Pitch (Slonimsky 1988, plate 29). The vowel system is very easy. The vowels are a, e, i, o, u, plus the deeper variant of “i” just mentioned. Every vowel is a syllable, and every syllable has one vowel in it. Russian words are stressed on one of the syllables only; unlike English, Russian does not have secondary stress. When a, e, and o are not in the stressed syllable, they are “reduced” in spoken Russian, but “o” to “a” is generally the only reduction heard in singing, and then not uniformly. a e i y o u\n\nas in “Mahler” as in “bet” as in “beet” as in “Bill” (tense “i” explained above) as in “coat” but deepened toward “call” (as in “kot,” tomcat) as in “flute”\n\nConsonants are transcribed as in the LC system except for “j.” My transcriptions do not show the difference between plain and palatalized consonants, but it is not necessary to understand the distinction in order to follow a song. b d f g j k l m n p\n\nas in “boy” as in “dish” as in “father” as in “Gogol” as in “Johann” as in “kaftan” (but without any puff of air) as in “bull” as in “Moscow” as in “noble” as in “Paul” (no puff of air)\n\nA Note on Dates and Spelling r s t v z\n\nxix\n\ntrilled once, as in Italian “Roma” as in “soul” as in “Tomsk” (no puff of air) as in “Volga” as in “Zachary”\n\nSome Russian consonants require two or more letters in transcription: ch kh sh shch ts zh\n\nas in “China” as in “Bach” or Scottish “loch” as in “shoot” as in “fresh chips” as in “bats” or “pizza” as in “azure” or French “Jean”\n\nSome examples of Russian names follow in the table below: 1) The “LC” column shows Library of Congress transliteration, used in the Bibliography of this book. 2) The “Translation” column shows the spelling used in the narrative and commentary throughout the book. 3) The “Song Text” column shows the transcription used in this book for each song, devised to approximate the way the words actually sound.

Sergei Vasilievich Rachmaninoff was born into a gentry family of modest means in the spring of 1873, on a family estate near Novgorod. He spent his early boyhood in that flat river and lake country in the far north with its long winter nights and its white nights in summer, near the Volkhov River and Lake Ilmen, the scene of Rimsky-Korsakov’s opera Sadko. Novgorod is the oldest city in Great Russia, a city rich in medieval churches and monasteries on both sides of the river; on the right bank stands a large walled and towered Kremlin built around the eleventh-century Cathedral of St. Sophia, with its silver domes and sonorous bells. In Novgorod, as in Moscow, where the composer later lived, the sound of church bells was a constant accompaniment to daily life. In both cities, Rachmaninoff went to hear bells and came to know master bell ringers (VOR 1, 116, and LN 3, 427). Bells are a motif in such compositions as the Easter movement of the First Suite for two pianos, Op. 5 (1893), the Second Symphony, Op. 27 (1906–7), and the choral symphony The Bells, Op. 35 (1913), which Rachmaninoff considered one of his best works. In its extended lines of grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins, Rachmaninoff’s family situated him within a circle of kinship and acquaintance that was decisive in shaping all the important events of his formative years—the development of his musical gifts, his education, his early friendships, and even his marriage. The Rachmaninoff clan was typical of 19th-century noble families of moderate means: they lived in the country at least part of the year, were welcome in society in town, and had a network of connections that could gain them access to just about anyone they might need or wish to meet. A century earlier, Gerasim, Rachmaninoff’s great-great-grandfather, was a soldier in the Preobrazhensky Guards of Peter the Great’s daughter Elizabeth, who in 1741 seized the throne with the help of her Guards. She rewarded Gerasim with officer’s rank and a “diploma of nobility, which had not heretofore been given to the Rakhmaninovs,” allowing him to buy land in Tambov province, where he and his descendants lived on their family estate called Znamenskoye (Keldysh, 18). Of his children, Nadezhda married Yury Alekseyevich Pushkin, whose sister was Maria Gannibal, the grandmother of Alexander Pushkin; his son Ivan translated Voltaire and opened a publishing house in St. Petersburg; and his other son, Alexander, Rachmaninoff’s great-grandfather, was an officer who played the violin well, but who died in 1812 at the age of thirty trying to save a man who was freezing to death in the steppe. Military service remained the traditional form of service for most of Gerasim’s sons and grandsons all the way down to Rachmaninoff’s father Vasily, who was a Guards officer.\n\nEarly Years (1873–1892)\n\nAmateur music-making was another tradition that ran in the family. Rachmaninoff’s grandfather Arkady was a systematic and ambitious musician who had studied piano with John Field (1782–1837), the Irish pianist and composer. He played at musical soirées, composed romances and piano pieces, and is said to have sat down at the piano every morning of his life. Arkady’s mother, Maria, was of the Bakhmetyev family, who were landed gentry too, and very active musically; she played the piano; her cousin Nikolai was a solo violinist with the serf orchestra and choir he kept on his estate; he wrote church music and romances, and for more than twenty years was director of the Imperial Court Chapel Choir. In the Rachmaninoff family lore it was said that a good singing voice and the perfect pitch that many of them possessed were inherited from Maria Bakhmetyeva (VOR 1, 14). Rachmaninoff’s father Vasily was technically a good pianist and could play with a beautiful, soft tone. He was an inventive and whimsical improviser: his sister recalled that “he would play the piano for hours, not well-known pieces, heaven only knows what they were, but you could listen to him for hours” (VOR 1, 15). He liked a certain impish polka (written by Franz Behr, though Rachmaninoff thought his father had written it); in 1911 Rachmaninoff arranged it and published it as “Polka de W. R.”, spelling Vasily with a “W” (see T/N, 152 and 190). Rachmaninoff recorded this polka in 1919, 1921, and 1928 (this latter recording is on the Sergei Rachmaninoff volume, no. 81, of the “Great Pianists of the 20th Century” series of Philips CDs). Vladimir Horowitz also liked this polka and played it in his Moscow recital in 1986. Rachmaninoff was born on 20 March 1873 Old Style (1 April New Style) on a family estate in Novgorod province. There is disagreement about whether this estate was Oneg, near Novgorod, or Semyonovo, near Staraya Russa. The evidence for the latter is an official document, the church registry of births, marriages, and deaths, which records his baptism at Starye Degtyari, four kilometers from Semyonovo. Semyonovo was his father’s house. It is so far from Novgorod that to take an infant born in Oneg to Semyonovo for baptism would have been not just unlikely but impossible, given the season and the duration of a trip of nearly two hundred kilometers over snowy or muddy roads. The director of the Rachmaninoff Museum in Novgorod believes the family was at Semyonovo when Sergei was born. Rachmaninoff, however, always gave Oneg as his place of birth, and for that reason the matter remains undecided: in the new New Grove, Geoffrey Norris gives Oneg, while Richard Taruskin (in the Opera volume) gives Semyonovo. At any rate, it was at Oneg, near Novgorod, that Rachmaninoff had his first memories of his childhood, and that is where he lived until the family left Novgorod when he was nine. He was lucky to be born into a musical family that recognized the boy’s talent early and took steps to give him regular piano lessons, first with his mother, who started teaching him to play and read music at the age of four.\n\nEarly Years (1873–1892)\n\nWhen his grandfather Arkady came for a visit, they played duets. When he was seven, he suggested to his sisters’ French governess that if she would sing Schubert’s “The Maiden’s Lament” (Des Mädchens Klage, D 191), he would accompany her. The piano part of this song gives the right and left hands two different repeating figures, simple but expressive; he had heard his mother play it many times. She at first didn’t take him seriously, but he pleaded, and when they had finished, he asked her to sing it again twice more; she was astonished that he played it so well, from memory, his hands not big enough to play all the chords, but without a single wrong note (B/L, 3). This performance sprang from the boy’s own imagination, and once they had gone through it, he wanted it to be repeated: the idea of the drama and even thrill inherent in a good song performance remained with him when he grew up and shaped his conception of the songs he wrote. The next morning news of this performance was dispatched to grandfather Arkady, who came by train from Znamenskoye and sent Vasily to St. Petersburg to bring back a teacher from the Conservatory. Anna Ornatskaya, a Conservatory graduate and friend of Rachmaninoff’s mother, was brought to Oneg to live in the household and teach Sergei. She taught the boy there from 1880 to 1882, when the family moved to St. Petersburg. Many years later, in 1896, Rachmaninoff dedicated “Spring Waters,” Song 32, to Anna Ornatskaya; one of his best songs, it has an especially thrilling and dramatic piano part. Rachmaninoff’s mother, Lyubov Petrovna, was the daughter of General Piotr Butakov, who taught history at the Novgorod military college. He died when Rachmaninoff was only four, but his widow, Rachmaninoff’s grandmother Sophia Aleksandrovna Butakova, was important in Rachmaninoff’s childhood. He was the third of six children—Vasily and Lyubov had three sons and three daughters—but of the six Sergei was Sophia’s favorite. She spoiled him, but did not indulge him; she let him play and encouraged his time at the piano, but she expected him to behave himself, which he did, without rebellion; he was happy being with her and came to have the highest respect and affection for her. She was a connoisseur of church choirs, and she took him to services to hear the best liturgical singing; she knew the bell ringer “Yegorka,” whom Sergei first saw in her house. When Lyubov and the children moved to St. Petersburg, she bought an estate near Novgorod, Borisovo, just so Sergei could come to live with her on his summer vacations. His time spent there was the happiest in his childhood. Her maiden name was Litvinova, and she was related by marriage to the famous soprano Félia Litvinne. Rachmaninoff and Litvinne both performed in Diaghilev’s “Saison Russe” in Paris in 1907, and Rachmaninoff dedicated one of his romances to her, Song 75, “Dissonance” (1912). Vasily Rachmaninoff planned to send his two older sons, Vladimir and Sergei, to the Corps of Pages to train as officers, but he squandered away the five estates in Lyubov’s dowry, and when the family left Oneg in 1882 the\n\nEarly Years (1873–1892)\n\nmarriage was breaking apart. Volodya, as eldest, did go to military school, but, for Sergei, Anna Ornatskaya arranged a scholarship to the Conservatory school, and he undertook a three-year course of study there. The move from the comfortable estate at Oneg to a crowded apartment in St. Petersburg near the Haymarket—the neighborhood of Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment—was a further strain on the family. Vasily and Lyubov separated, and Lyubov was left with the care of the children. For Sergei, this period went badly, because his mother had no time to supervise him; she sent him to live with the Trubnikovs, a lenient aunt and uncle and their children, but he was fiercely independent and they could not control him. He refused any kind of help and insisted on doing everything himself: “ya sam” he would say, “I can do it myself,” and this became his nickname at the Trubnikovs (B/L, 3). Instead of doing his homework, he played hooky on the streets. He liked the city and its opportunities for jumping on and off the trams and spending his carfare at the ice rink, but he was unhappy living away from Oneg, and he missed his grandmother especially. His father’s departure was a blow, because, despite his immaturity, or perhaps owing to it, the children were happier being around him than with their mother. The only thing Sergei looked forward to was summer at Borisovo. His piano playing improved, but he failed his other subjects in 1885. His mother did not punish him and allowed him to go to grandmother’s for the summer, but now something would have to be done to save him. She turned to the family for help. One of Vasily’s sisters was married to Ilya Siloti, and among their children was Alexander (Sasha) Siloti (1863–1945). Ten years older than his cousin, Siloti was embarking on a brilliant career as a pianist himself. His teachers were Nikolai Rubinstein, Tchaikovsky, and Franz Liszt. Lyubov Petrovna asked him to hear Sergei play and to test his ear, which he did. He said there was only one place to send him: to Moscow to study with Nikolai Zverev, a renowned piano teacher (who had taught Siloti) and strict housemaster who tolerated no nonsense from any of his pupils, especially the boys who lived under his roof. At the end of the summer of 1885 in Novgorod his grandmother put him on the Moscow train after taking him to a convent for a special service. She had sewn a hundred rubles into an amulet she put around his neck, and gave him her blessing. When the train pulled out, he burst into tears (VOR 1, 18-19).\n\n2. When Sergei appeared before Nikolai Sergeyevich Zverev (1832–1893) on the recommendation of his cousin Sasha Siloti, Zverev asked him to play something and agreed to take him as a pupil. He taught both boys and girls, but every year two or three of the boys lived on full room and board in his house\n\nEarly Years (1873–1892)\n\nnear the crowded bazaar called the Smolensk Market, a twenty-minute walk from the Conservatory. Rachmaninoff had aunts he could have lived with in Moscow, but Siloti wanted Sergei to live in Zverev’s house, as he had done in 1871 and for ten more years until he graduated (with a gold medal) from the Conservatory. Zverev, a bachelor, and his sister, a spinster, ran the house with some strict rules: no fighting and no horseplay; no ice-skating or riding or rowing or other dangerous activity that could result in injury to a hand; and obligatory piano practice three hours a day, six days a week. Zverev made good money from the many pupils he had, so he did not charge his “cubs” for room and board (zver’ means “wild animal” in Russian, so the boys were called zveryáta, “cubs”). To develop their understanding of the performing arts he took them to concerts, the opera, and the theater, always buying good seats. The first practice period was at 6 a.m., and each of the three boys had to take that period twice a week; if they had come home late from the theater the night before, that was not an excuse to miss early practice if it was their turn. But the strict regime was relaxed on Sundays, when Zverev held open house from noon till evening. Those afternoons were, in Rachmaninoff’s words, a “musical paradise,” with distinguished guests from the musical world dropping in. Guests at the Sunday soirées were not invited to play, but to listen to the boys play. Zverev was hugely pleased by these performances, as Rachmaninoff later recalled: “No matter what we played, his verdict was always ‘Fine! Well done! Excellent!’ He let us play anything we felt like playing... I cannot adequately describe what a spur to our ambition was this opportunity to play for the greatest musicians in Moscow, and to listen to their kindly criticism—nor what a stimulant it was to our enthusiasm” (B/L, 11). Among the guests at the soirées were Muscovites like Tchaikovsky and Sergei Taneyev, or visitors, like Anton Rubinstein, who came to Moscow early in 1886 to give a series of brilliant recitals that covered the history of piano music. Each of Rubinstein’s recitals was performed in the evening for ticket holders, and the next day for students at a free matinee. Zverev’s “cubs” heard every recital twice. When Rachmaninoff arrived at Zverev’s, fellow cub Matvei Presman wrote of him, “he was not well prepared technically, but what he was already playing was incomparable” (VOR 1, 152). Presman also said that the only thing Zverev taught them was to keep their hands and arms relaxed and not to saw their elbows back and forth. But there was more to it than that. It was Zverev’s task to prepare his pupils in two or three years to be turned over to the piano faculty at the Conservatory who would complete their training—Taneyev, Vasily Safonov, Paul Pabst, Siloti, and others; and they had to be so well prepared that they did not have to be retrained. Zverev’s pupils included eminent pianists like Siloti and Konstantin Igumnov; and pianists who were composers, too, like Feodor\n\nEarly Years (1873–1892)\n\nKeneman and Arseny Koreshchenko, who were two of Chaliapin’s favorite accompanists; and Rachmaninoff’s contemporary of genius Alexander Scriabin (1872–1915), who was in Rachmaninoff’s same class but as a day student. The “Russian pianistic method” Zverev taught was known for its “songful melody and freedom of hand movement” (Baker’s, 4046). Igumnov was admired as an artist of impeccable taste “who worked out every detail of the music to the utmost perfection” (ibid., 1659).This approach to playing the piano can be traced back to John Field, who lived in Russia most of his adult life and was an enormously influential teacher there. Of those who studied with him, two were especially important in passing on his legacy: Alexander Villoing (1804–1878), who gave lessons to the Rubinstein brothers, and Alexander Dubuque (1812–1898), who taught Mily Balakirev in St. Petersburg and Nikolai Zverev in Moscow. Field’s playing had “unmatched beauty of tone,” “sweetness and shading,” “speed, evenness and purity of embellishment”; Mikhail Glinka, who took lessons from Field, admired “his forceful, gentle, and distinct playing. It seemed that he did not strike the keys but his fingers fell on them as large raindrops and scattered like pearls on velvet.” To Liszt’s charge that Field’s playing was “sleepy” Glinka answered that “Field’s music was often full of energy, capricious and diverse, but he did not make the art of music ugly by charlatanism, and did not chop cutlets with his fingers like the majority of modern fashionable pianists.” He emphasized “effortless command and equality of all fingers, slow practice, and tonal control through hand techniques far in advance of his time, the whole subordinate to musical ends” (Langley). “Feeling” is not a part of this description, and Zverev never asked his pupils to play with “feeling.” He insisted on perfect knowledge of the musical text, including the “punctuation marks”; he expected clean technique, clarity in the phrasing and precision in the execution; and the player had to pay attention to the quality and tone of the sound being produced, and to learn to control it. He passed on what Dubuque had shown him was a method to master the soft, singing line, the technical ease and elegance which characterized the strong but poetic style of John Field (Keldysh, 29). These were core attributes of the “Russian piano school” as it was understood and being taught in Moscow when Rachmaninoff began his training at Zverev’s in the fall of 1885. To widen the knowledge of music of his pupils and to cultivate their taste, Zverev employed a woman to come twice a week for two hours to play eighthand arrangements of orchestral works with them at two pianos. They played symphonies by Haydn, Mozart, and, their favorite, Beethoven. At the end of the spring exams, Zverev invited Taneyev, who was Director of the Conservatory, to hear Rachmaninoff, Presman, and two of the other boys play an eight-hand arrangement of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony. Taneyev was amazed that they played it all the way through from memory (VOR 1, 158).\n\nEarly Years (1873–1892)\n\nIn 1888 Rachmaninoff finished Zverev’s piano course and was assigned to study with his cousin Sasha Siloti. He had matured during those three years, and he and Siloti became friends, playing music together not only during lessons, going to concerts, and visiting the relatives and friends they had in common. Siloti was newly married to Vera Tretyakova, a daughter of the Moscow textile magnate and art collector Pavel Tretyakov.\n\n3. Rachmaninoff began composing in his second year at Zverev’s. It is striking that his early efforts range over several genres, not only piano pieces but also orchestral, chamber, and vocal works. He was ambitious, and in this he emulated Tchaikovsky, who was his hero at the Moscow Conservatory. In February 1887 he wrote a Scherzo for orchestra, his earliest extant composition, based on Mendelssohn’s Scherzo from A Midsummer Night’s Dream (T/N, 162). Over the next year he wrote his early piano pieces (ibid., 147-8). He made sketches for an opera, “Esmeralda,” a subject he took from Victor Hugo’s Hunchback of Notre Dame (ibid., 182). He impressed his theory teacher Anton Arensky, who took him into his course in harmony for composers. By the fall of 1889 he had set his sights on composition; that spur to “ambition” he felt playing Sunday afternoons in the presence of Tchaikovsky was turning toward composing music. As we shall see, some of his early unpublished songs show him taking Tchaikovsky as a model. The living arrangements at Zverev’s house now posed a problem. He wanted his own room with his own piano to compose. He asked Zverev to do this for him, but it led to a quarrel. Whether as “ya sam” he insisted too strongly to be allowed to have his way without any interference from others, or whether Zverev was offended at what seemed a lack of gratitude for the home and schooling he had given Rachmaninoff for three years, tempers flared. Zverev could not forgive him, and broke with him as a result. Rachmaninoff tried repeatedly to ask forgiveness, but Zverev ceased speaking to him. After a month, Zverev led him on foot to his cousins the Satín family, who lived on Prechistenka Street, not far from Zverev’s house. A family council called by his two aunts, Siloti’s mother and Aunt Varvara Satiná, also a sister of his father’s, considered the matter but could not agree that Sergei was their responsibility. The next day he moved in with Mikhail Slonov, a friend at the Conservatory who was five years older, and had his own rooms (B/L, 20). Varvara Satina and her husband had four children, two girls and two boys. Of the boys one was Sergei’s age and one eight years younger. The girls, Natalia (Natasha) and Sophia (Sonya), were younger than Sergei by four and six years. Natasha played the piano and would, in 1902, become Rachmaninoff’s wife.\n\nEarly Years (1873–1892)\n\nSophia loved music and science (she eventually was a geneticist on the faculty of Smith College); she became Rachmaninoff’s faithful friend and chronicler. Their mother took Sergei’s side and, in the fall of 1889, offered him a home and family. They immediately made him feel welcome, and he showed the winning way he had with younger children, a quality he inherited from his father. He was happier with them than he had been since he moved to Moscow. In the following spring he wrote his first two songs (Songs 1 and 2, 1890). The girls’ father, Alexander Satin, managed the large Naryshkin estate southeast of Moscow and had his own estate “Ivánovka” a few hours’ ride from there, in Tambov province (VOR 1, 253). Rachmaninoff spent the summer at Ivanovka with the Satins in 1890 and again in 1891. It was in a beautiful natural setting, wooded steppe country with rivers and forest paths; he came to love it and found there the peace and quiet he needed to compose. These were exceptionally happy times in a household crowded with young people who all loved music; the Silotis were there, too. Satin’s sister was married to a man named Dmitri Skalon, a cavalry general who played the cello and lived in St. Petersburg. His three daughters Natalia, Lyudmila, and Vera, also came down to Ivanovka. Natalia Skalon, five years his elder, became Rachmaninoff’s first regular correspondent the following winter. He wrote music for them, and he and Vera, two years younger, were romantically fond of each other. He was not allowed to write her, but to Vera he dedicated his fine early song, later revised for Op. 4, “In the silence of the secret night” (Song 12). He was devoted to the Skalon sisters and corresponded with Natalia Skalon until his marriage to Natalia Satina in 1902. He finished his First Piano Concerto at Ivanovka in July 1891; the dedication read “À Monsieur A. Ziloti.” At the end of the 1890–91 academic year Siloti left the Conservatory. To avoid having to work with a different teacher, Rachmaninoff asked to take his final exams in piano that spring, a year early; he passed with a gold medal. The next year, when he asked to be examined in theory and composition a year early, his request was also granted. One of the requirements was to write an opera on the subject of Pushkin’s narrative poem The Gypsies. This was Aleko. When he played it for the examiners on May 7, he received a grade of “5” with a plus. Then Zverev came up to him, took out his gold watch, and presented to it to him, ending their two years of estrangement. Upon graduation, he was awarded the highest honor, the Great Gold Medal. It was an astonishingly brilliant finish to his schooling, showing how well he had learned to work and to work hard. He was nineteen, on his own, with the official title of “Free Artist.”\n\nNine Unpublished Songs (1890–1899)\n\n9\n\nУ врат обители святой 1 At the gates of the holy abode Like several other Russian composers, Rachmaninoff was drawn to this lyric of Mikhail Lermontov (1814–1841) by the powerful and original way it expresses rejection, “best feelings” spurned, in the image of the beggar by the monastery gates who asks for a piece of bread and is handed a stone. It is a scene easily imagined by a Russian reader; in fact, as we know from the memoirs of Yekaterina Sushkova, a scene like this actually took place outside St. Sergius Lavra near Moscow. In August 1830 a party of young people, including the 18-yearold Sushkova and the sixteen-year-old Lermontov, made an excursion to the monastery, with Sushkova’s grandmother riding in the lead as chaperone. At the gates they gave some coins to a beggar, who thanked them and told them the story of some other young people who had dropped stones into his cup. Later, at the inn, Lermontov, instead of joining them all at dinner, found a pencil and a scrap of paper, and, kneeling at a chair, wrote out this poem, handing it to Sushkova as he sat down to his bowl of chilled fish soup with kvass (Sushkova, 114-7). This intense Romantic gesture just before the soup course is almost a parody of what Lermontov would do so well later in mature work like his novella “Princess Mary,” but this early poem already shows his authentic voice. Rachmaninoff saw the emotional power in this lyric, and his response to it is impressive. His music pays attention to the words. His own authentic voice is heard unmistakably in the piano part, which establishes the emotional terms at the outset, and supports the voice part eloquently throughout. A third of the song’s 45 bars are for piano alone. The beginning of the voice part, with its six repeated B-flats, contrasts with the emotionally strong introduction, and it can be ponderous if taken too slowly and allowed to drag. The baritone Sergei Leiferkus, who sings it in the original key, manages the right tempo, moving ahead as he rises to the high point of the song, marked con moto (with animated movement), “thus did I beg for your love, with bitter tears, with longing.” At this point the piano again has a moment all to itself, to pause for lyrical reflection and let the words sink in. The song can work with other voices, too, as the fine recording by the Swedish soprano Elisabeth Söderström shows. She brings an underlying sense of animation to the whole song, while her accompanist, Vladimir Ashkenazy, plays the notes in the piano part with a chaste lyricism, not adding false emotional emphasis or arpeggios that are not in the score.

Tchaikovsky had admired Fet as a poet who could move him musically: as he wrote in a letter to Grand Duke Konstantin, “he has the power to touch strings of the soul that no artist, however great, can touch with words alone… he even avoids subject matter that can easily be expressed in words” (Romanov 1999, 52). This unusual lyric by Fet entitled “Romance” is such a poem.Tchaikovsky noticed it as soon as it was published in 1886, and chose it for one of his Opus 60 songs, which he wrote in May of that year. The subject is first awareness of being in love, when it is still an unspoken secret. The metaphor of the heart in flower is highly unusual in Russian poetry; here the feeling of love, opening like a flower, is felt, as a physical sensation. Fet used “flowers” as a metaphor for something inexpressibly beautiful and tender. That this heart is a “night flower” makes it more romantic, more mysterious. Rachmaninoff tried his hand at this text as a variation on Tchaikovsky’s song, which he admired. Tchaikovsky set his song (for high voice) in E Major, 6/8 Allegretto con moto, in an ABA form where the B section (the second stanza and first two lines of the third) slows down to più tranquillo; the rapt lead-in to the word “heart” is further held back and preceded by a series of 16 repeated notes. The A sections are a light dance, almost playful, but the B section is reflective, expressing a quiet awe. Rachmaninoff modeled his 3/4 Allegro song in C Major on this pattern, including some repeated notes, but he wrote it for low voice, with no gradations in tempo indicated. It is a youthful exercise never intended for publication, but the result is an ardent song with a strong, con moto ending. The excellent recording by the Russian baritone Sergei Shaposhnikov makes a convincing case for it by moderating and varying the tempos to give it shape. Я тебе ничего не скажу, И тебя не встревожу ничуть, И о том, что я молча твержу, Не решусь ни за что намекнуть. Целый день спят ночные цветы, Но, лишь солнце за тучи зайдёт, Раскрываются тихо листы, И я слышу, как сердце цветёт. И в больную, усталую грудь Веет влагой ночной… я дрожу, Я тебя не встревожу ничуть, Я тебе ничего не скажу.\n\n12\n\nSong 2 (1890) Я тебе ничего не скажу, Я тебя не встревожу ничуть, Я тебе ничего не скажу. Ja tebe± nichevo± ne skazhu±, Ja tebja± ne fstrevo±zhu nichu±t’, I a to±m, shto ja mo±lcha tverzhu±, Ne reshu±s’ ni za shto± nameknu±t’.\n\nI’m not going to say a word to you, I’m not going to alarm you in any way, And what I’m silently repeating to myself, I wouldn’t mention even with a hint.\n\nTse±lyj de±n’ spja±t nachny±je tsvety±, No, lish so±ntse za tu±chi zajdjo±t, Raskryva±jutsa ti±kha listy±, I ja sly±shu, kak se±rttse tsvetjo±t.\n\nNight flowers sleep all day, But when the sun sets behind the clouds, Their petals softly open up, And I feel my heart flowering.\n\nI v bal’nu±ju, usta±luju gru±t’ Ve±jet vla±gaj nachno±j… ja drazhu±, Ja tebja± ne fstrevo±zhu nichu±t’, Ja tebe± nichevo± ne skazhu±.\n\nAnd into my aching, tired breast Flows moist night air… I’m trembling, I won’t alarm you in any way, I won’t say anything to you.\n\nJa tebe± nichevo± ne skazhu±. Ja tebja± ne fstrevo±zhu nichu±t’, Ja tebe± nichevo± ne skazhu±.\n\nI won’t say anything to you. I won’t alarm you in any way, I won’t say anything to you at all.\n\nText. Afanásy Afanásievich Fet, 1885. First published in Vestnik Evropy (Herald of Europe) in 1886, no. 1. Title: Романс (Romance). First set by Tchaikovsky in 1886, Op. 60/2. Rachmaninoff changed one word in line 6 of the poem (for woods, рощи, he substituted clouds, тучи); he repeated three lines at the end. Georgi K. Ivanov, who catalogued all the songs by Russian composers with lyrics in Russian in his Russian Poetry in Music of the Fatherland (to 1917), names 16 composers who wrote songs to this text after Tchaikovsky (Ivanov, vol. 1, 372). Only two are well known today: Tchaikovsky’s song and the “popular” version by Tatiana Konstantinova Tolstaya (for a list of recordings of these, see below). Information is hard to find on Tolstaya, but see Korabelnikova 2004, 781. Meter. Ternary. Anapest, 3-foot, with masculine endings: After sundown a breath of fresh air And my flowering heart is revived… Music. Dated 1 May 1890. Without opus number. C Major. 3/4, Allegro. For Bass Voice: c–f1. First published posthumously in Lamm in 1947. No dedication. Recordings. Del Grande, Kharitonov, Leiferkus, Shaposhnikov, Söderström, Suchkova. Tchaikovsky: Ivan Kozlovsky, Sergei Larin, Sergei Lemeshev, Jennie Tourel, Georgi Vinogradov, Sherri Weiler. Tolstaya: Boris Gmyria, Nadezhda Obukhova, Nikita Storozhev, Tatiana Tolstaya, Lyudmila Zykina.\n\nNine Unpublished Songs (1890–1899)\n\n3\n\n13\n\nОпять встрепенулось ты, сердце Again you leapt, my heart\n\nNikolai Grekov (1807–1866) is nearly forgotten today, but in 1860 he was as well known as Fet and Polonsky, and many 19th-century Russian composers found attractive lyrics in his poetry: Mussorgsky’s fine early song “Where are you, little star?” (late 1850s) uses a shortened Grekov lyric, and Tchaikovsky wrote three of his most charming songs to lyrics by him (Songs 12, 26, and 28 in TCS). Grekov was of the landed gentry like Fet and the Tolstoys, but his small estates in Tula and Kaluga were modest and did not bring in much income. He graduated from Moscow University in 1827, served a few years in a government job, then retired to the country, supporting his family by writing and translating Shakespeare, Goethe, Heine, Calderón, and others. His wife died young; this loss, and his memory of first love, inspired his best song lyrics, including “little star” and the present poem. His verse was musical; he wrote about love in outdoor settings that evoke the Russian countryside—subjects very close to Rachmaninoff’s heart. In one of his poems, he defines poetry this way: “In life, poetry is the rose in a garland of thorns.” Both those images appear in the present text, as does the word music; the lyric is about the poet’s heart reawakening to love and accepting life anew in both its beauty and its pain. In Rachmaninoff’s song, for the first time in his early songs, the voice part takes the lead, with the piano playing a strong but supporting role. The verb in the first line means the sudden rising up in flight of a bird, or sudden beating of the heart. As the voice part rises and falls, Rachmaninoff finds trembling figures in the piano to suggest flight. The song bears his own signature. It is a slight but beautiful song, recognizably by Rachmaninoff and promising original songs to come. Опять встрепенулось ты, сердце, и снова В душе моей вспыхнули грёзы, И рвётся из груди кипучее слово, И льются горячие слёзы... И снятся опять ей всё звуки да звуки, Всё музыки полные речи, Да чёрные очи, да белые руки, Да кудри, да белые плечи. И снова душа отозваться готова На всё, в чём есть тернья и розы, И рвётся из груди кипучее слово, И льются горячие слёзы…\n\n14\n\nSong 3 (date uncertain)\n\nApja±t’ fstrepenu±las’ ty, se±rttse, i sno±va V dushe± maje±j fspy±khnuli grjo±zy, I rvjo±tsa iz gru±di kipu±cheje slo±va, I l’ju±tsa garja±chije sljo±zy…\n\nAgain you beat faster, my heart, and again Bright dreams live in my soul, And a passionate word flies from my breast, And hot tears pour out…\n\nI snja±tsa apja±t’ jej fsjo zvu±ki da zvu±ki, Vsjo mu±zyki po±lnyje re±chi, Da cho±rnyje o±chi, da be±lyje ru±ki, Da ku±dri, da be±lyje ple±chi.\n\nAnd my soul dreams of sounds, those sounds, Words you spoke full of music, And black eyes, and white hands, And curls, and white shoulders.\n\nI sno±va dusha± atazva±tsa gato±va Na vsjo±, f chom jest’ te±rn’ja i ro±zy, I rvjo±tsa iz gru±di kipu±cheje slo±va, I l’ju±tsa garja±chije sljo±zy…\n\nAnd again my soul is ready to respond To everything that has thorns and roses, And a passionate word flies from my breast, And hot tears pour out…\n\nText.

He was not well known in Russia, and I have not found any other Russian songs that use lyrics by him. The song is dated 1 April 1891, soon after Rachmaninoff’s eighteenth birthday. Spring—the coming of spring, sudden joy, and first love—was one of his favorite themes. He went on to write a cantata for baritone, chorus, and orchestra to a famous Nekrasov poem about the “verdant noise” of spring’s coming (“Spring,” Op. 20, 1902); and several of his best songs are celebrations of spring (Song 32 “Spring waters,” Song 38 “Lilacs,” and Song 56 “Before my window”). In the case of this early song, the French lyric is pretty in a conventional way but pale and precious compared to Aleksey Tolstoy’s exuberant celebration of spring which Tchaikovsky made into one of his most well-known songs (“In early spring,” Song 40 in TCS). The theme, however, is exactly the same: looking back and remembering the happiness of a spring morning which was also the morning of love. Rachmaninoff wrote a love song with a soaring, passionate vocal line, and then tenderness in the last words “do you remember?”. These words work better in the Russian version of the song, and indeed the whole song works better in Russian. There is a good recording of the song in French (but only one) by the tenor Sergej Larin. Everyone else sings the song in Russian. The tempo is not indicated in the manuscript and the editor has marked it “Moderato,” which gives performers some room for interpretation. The recordings vary, with a fleet performance by Elisabeth Söderström in just over two minutes, and a much slower, beautifully articulated reading of the song as an anthem of love by the baritone Pavel Lisitsian that is just under three minutes. Rachmaninoff added two words to the French original and repeated a few phrases, which I have enclosed in brackets below. C’était en avril, un dimanche, Oui, le dimanche! J’étais heureux... Vous aviez une [jolie] robe blanche Et deux gentils brins de pervenche, Oui, de pervenche, Dans les cheveux [brins de pervenche].\n\nIt was in April, a Sunday Yes, on Sunday! I was happy... You wore a [pretty] white dress And two nice sprigs of periwinkle, Yes, periwinkle, In your hair [sprigs of periwinkle].\n\n16\n\nSong 4 (1891)\n\nNous étions assis sur la mousse, Oui, sur la mousse, Et sans parler, Nous regardions l’herbe, [l’herbe] qui pousse, [Et] la feuille verte, et l’ombre douce, Oui, l’ombre douce, Et l’eau couler.\n\nWe were sitting on the moss, Yes, on the moss, And without speaking, We looked at the grass, [the grass] that grows, [And] the green leaf, and the soft shade, Yes, the soft shade, And the rippling water.\n\nUn oiseau chantait sur la branche, Oui, sur la branche, Puis il s’est tu, J’ai pris dans ma main ta main blanche... C’était en avril, un dimanche, Oui, le dimanche... T’en souviens-tu?\n\nA bird was singing on a branch, Yes, on a branch, Then it was silent, In my hand I took your white hand... It was in April, a Sunday Yes, on Sunday... Do you remember it?\n\nThe Russian translation was made by the Soviet poet Veronika Tushnova (1915–65) when the song was first published in 1947. Апрель! Вешний праздничный день, да, вешний день!.. Луга в росе. Ты пришла в белом платье своём и два подснежника в косе, да, два цветка, два цветка в тёмной косе. И без слов мы сели на мох, бархатный мох; в блеске лучей весь мир зеленел, каждый листок влагой блестел, в лёгкой тени, где-то у ног, журчал ручей... А в кустах звенел голосок птички лесной. Руки твои в своих я так бережно сжал в то ясное утро, весной, светлой весной... Помнишь, помнишь? Apre±l’! Ve±shnij pra±znichnyj de±n’, Da, ve±shnij de±n’!.. Luga± v rase±.

Tchaikovsky chose thirteen of them, with an unerring eye, for eleven of his songs and two of his duets. This is the first of six songs by Rachmaninoff to lyrics of Tolstoy’s. The theme is twilight, the passage from day to evening, in this case a hot day, which carries oppressive implications in the Russian context. So twilight brings relief, and another passage, too, from the present to a memory of the face of the woman the poet loves. Rachmaninoff made a good choice here of a lyric for a song, but he did a poor job of finding music for these words. The restless, rising phrases are at odds with the passage to stillness, to the contemplation of a bond, in this case a tender romantic bond. The long iambic hexameter phrases of the lyric do come across clearly in Rachmaninoff’s use of eighth notes for each syllable in the line until the last one, which is a quarter note, or a dotted quarter note, or a dotted half note; this design culminates in the last word of the second stanza, a whole note high B. But the song searches too strenuously for a convincing melody, and the closing phrase comes as a relief. Singers have not taken the song up: except for the four complete sets of Rachmaninoff’s songs, there are no recordings of it, making it (together with Song 77, a setting of two lines in Church Slavonic from the Gospel of St. John written for the war effort) the composer’s least recorded song. Жаркий день бледнел неуловимо, Над озером туман тянулся полосой, И кроткий образ твой, знакомый и любимый, В вечерний тихий час носился предо мной. Улыбка та же была, которую люблю я, И мягкая коса, как прежде расплелась, И очи грустные, по прежнему тоскуя, Глядели на меня в вечерний тихий час. Жаркий день бледнел неуловимо, Над озером туман тянулся полосой, И кроткий образ твой, знакомый и любимый, В вечерний тихий час носился предо мной, В вечерний тихий час.\n\nNine Unpublished Songs (1890–1899)\n\n19\n\nZha±rkij de±n’ bledne±l neulavi±ma, Nad o±zeram tuma±n tjanu±lsa palaso±j, I kro±tkij o±bras tvo±j, znako±myj i ljubi±myj, V veche±rnij ti±khij cha±s nasi±lsa preda mno±j.\n\nThe hot day grew paler imperceptibly, A band of mist stretched out over the lake, And your gentle image, so familiar and beloved, Floated before me in the quiet evening hour.\n\nUly±pka ta± zhe byla±, kato±ruju ljublju± ja, I mja±khkaja kasa±, kak pre±zhde rasplela±s’, I o±chi gru±snyje, pa pre±zhnemu tasku±ja, Gljade±li na menja± v veche±rnij ti±khij cha±s.\n\nYour smile was the smile I love so much, And your soft braid, as before, came undone, And your sad eyes, with a look of longing, Were gazing at me in the quiet evening hour.\n\nZha±rkij de±n’ bledne±l neulavi±ma, Nad o±zeram tuma±n tjanu±lsa palaso±j, I kro±tkij o±bras tvo±j, znako±myj i ljubi±myj, V veche±rnij ti±khij cha±s nasi±lsa preda mno±j, V veche±rnij ti±khij cha±s.\n\nThe light of a hot day faded imperceptibly, A band of mist stretched out over the lake, And your gentle image, so familiar and beloved, Floated before me in the quiet evening hour, In the quiet evening hour.\n\nText.

There was a boom in the next two decades in sentimental urban romances, and Ratgauz’s melancholy poems were the perfect expression of what Russian composers were looking for in this vein. By 1917, Ratgauz had 144 poems set to music by contemporaries like Arensky, Ippolitov-Ivanov, Grechaninov, Koreshchenko, and Glière. In the list of Russian poets whose poems were made into songs before 1917, Ratgauz is fifth, ahead of poets like Aleksei Tolstoy, Yakov Polonsky, Aleksei Pleshcheyev, and Feodor Tyutchev, and behind only the top four—Konstantin Balmont, in first place, followed by Alexander Pushkin, Afanasy Fet, and Mikhail Lermontov. As a poet he is not even close to being in the same league as any of these other poets, but Tchaikovsky chose his texts well and wrote powerful music for them. Indeed, some consider Op. 73 to be Tchaikovsky’s finest set of songs. Rachmaninoff chose less well. He found this poem in 1893, when it first appeared in print. By that time, he had written Op. 4 and Op. 8, which contain several very good songs. They include sad songs, but nothing to match the extremes of despair and impossible hopes in this text. It is hard to imagine Rachmaninoff sharing these sentiments, except maybe the penultimate line, a wish to bring back the happy summers spent at Ivanovka with the Satins and the Skalon sisters. The song is well shaped, with “portentous repeated quaver octaves” in the bass accompaniment (Martyn, 84) to the midpoint of the song, line 7, where there is a shift to a major key, then back to the minor for the last stanza; there is a strong piano postlude of seven bars. It is a big, ambitious song, but he rightly decided not to publish it. «Умри!» – твердит мне день, томительный и скучный, «Умри!» – мне шепчет ночь таинственною мглой. И в жизни тягостной, с тоскою неразлучный, Без цели я брожу усталою стопой. «Умри!» – твердил мне ум, когда в душе унылой Почуял я намёк на светлый сон любви... Но ты, мой нежный друг, мой ангел светлокрылый, Ты взором ласковым мне всё твердишь: «Живи!» О, как я жить хочу! Как страстно жажду света, Возврата пылких грёз, несбыточной мечты!..

The theme is the fragility of the happiness love brings, requiring the beloved’s early demise. The piano part is carefully crafted, with a laconic, but expressive accompaniment to the first stanza and the last 7 lines of the poem; this frames the impassioned music for lines 5 and 6, with forte arpeggio chords; then there is a reflective postlude to close the song. Like the preceding song, it has a conscious design, but except for the two passionate lines that speak of love, the voice part lacks really strong, defining phrases. In Russian, the verb “died” cannot be used with “flower,” but “faded” means “died” in this context, and that is how I have translated it below. The masculine pronoun “он” in the first line of the second stanza is sometimes translated as “it,” meaning the flower, but that makes no sense. This can only mean “he” who loved her, the lover named in the third person as “your poor friend” (there is no first person pronoun in this poem). Увял цветок! Лазурным утром мая Нашла гроза, сломился стебелёк... И, словно слёзы, лепестки роняя, Увял цветок! Тебя любил он с неземною силой, – Как только жрец любить богиню мог, – Но ты взята безжалостной могилой... Увял цветок! Чужой мечтам, чужой желаньям ясным, Твой бедный друг душою изнемог. Возврата нет к угасшим дням прекрасным... Увял цветок! Увял цветок! Uvja±l tsveto±k! Lazu±rnym u±tram ma±ja Nashla± graza±, slami±lsa stebeljo±k… I, slo±vna sljo±zy, lepestki± ranja±ja, Uvja±l tsveto±k!\n\nThe flower died! On an azure morning in May A thunderstorm came, breaking its stalk… And shedding its petals like tears The flower died!\n\nTebja± ljubi±l on s nezemno±ju si±laj, – Kak to±l’ka zhre±ts ljubi±t’ bagi±nju mo±k, – No ty vzjata± bezzha±lasnaj magi±laj… Uvja±l tsveto±k!\n\nHe loved you with an unearthly power, As only a priest could love a goddess, But you were taken by the pitiless grave… The flower died!\n\nNine Unpublished Songs (1890–1899) Chuzho±j mechta±m, chuzho±j zhela±n’jam ja±snym, Tvoj be±dnyj dru±k dusho±ju iznemo±k. Vazvra±ta ne±t k uga±sshym dnja±m prekra±snym… Uvja±l tsveto±k! Uvja±l tsveto±k!\n\n23\n\nAlien to dreams, alien to clear desires, Your poor friend is stricken in his soul. The lovely burned-out days are gone beyond return… The flower died! The flower died!\n\nText. Daniíl Ratgáuz, 1893. Untitled. First published in Ratgauz 1893, p. 49.

In May and June of 1856, Aleksei Tolstoy and Sophia Miller, Tolstoy’s wife and the addressee of his best love lyrics, traveled to the Crimea. There Tolstoy began a group of fourteen lyrics he called “Crimean Sketches.” Rachmaninoff found the text of this song in that cycle. Like Song 5, this lyric describes an intimate memory, this time on an evening when the poet and his lover were riding horses together by the Black Sea. Rachmaninoff shortened the poem by leaving out two stanzas not needed for the song (they are printed below). This is a straightforward song to a good text that works in performance. The ternary rhythm of the poem is brought out clearly in the placement of word stresses in the voice part and in the triple note figures in the piano part; it has a good melodic phrase that is flexible enough for variation, first with tenderness in the memory of a happy time together, then building to the repeated lines at the end of the second stanza, and finally ending in the quiet close. It has not been widely sung, but singers have noticed it, including Daniil Shtoda, a tenor from St. Petersburg, who included it on his first recording of Russian romances. There is also a fine recording of the song by Konstantin Lisovsky. Ты помнишь ли вечер, как море шумело, В шиповнике пел соловей... Душистые ветки акации белой Качались на шляпе твоей? Меж камней, обросших густым виноградом, Дорога была так узка; В молчании над морем мы ехали рядом, К руке прилегала рука! В молчаньи над морем ехали мы рядом, К руке прилегала рука. Ты помнишь ли рёв дождевого потока И пену, и брызги кругом? И нам наше горе казалось далёко, И как мы забыли о нём! Ty po±mnish li ve±cher, kak mo±re shume±la, F shypo±vnike pe±l salave±j… Dushy±styje ve±tki aka±tsii be±laj Kacha±lis’ na shlja±pe tvaje±j?\n\nDo you remember that evening, how the sea roared, How a nightingale sang in the sweetbrier? How fragrant sprigs of white acacia Swayed on your hat?\n\nNine Unpublished Songs (1890–1899)\n\n25\n\nMesh ka±mnej, obro±sshykh gusty±m vinagra±dam, Daro±ga byla± tak uska±; V malcha±nii nad mo±rem my je±khali rja±dam, K ruke± prilega±la ruka±! V malcha±n’ji nad mo±rem je±khali my rja±dam, K ruke± prilega±la ruka±.\n\nBetween the rocks, overgrown with thick grapevines, The road was so narrow; We rode in silence together above the sea, Hand in hand! In silence above the sea we rode together Hand in hand.\n\nTy po±mnish li rjo±f dazhdevo±va pato±ka I pe±nu, i bry±zgi krugo±m? I nam na±she go±re kaza±las’ daljo±ka, I kak my zaby±li a njo±m!\n\nDo you remember the roar of the pouring rain, And the foam and spray all around? And how our grief seemed so far away, And how we forgot all about it!\n\nText. Alekséi Tolstóy, 1856. Untitled; No. 4 in “Крымские очерки” (Crimean Sketches). First set by Rachmaninoff, who removed two stanzas, repeated lines 7 and 8, and made two minor changes in wording. He was not satisfied with it but decided not to revise it (LN 1, 178-9). Cui set this same text in his late opus of 18 songs to Tolstoy’s poems (Op. 67/14, 1904). A setting was made in 1894 by G. E. Konyús (Georgi Conus, 1862–1933), composer and piano teacher of Scriabin and Medtner. Rachmaninoff knew the Conus family well; he played his trio with Julius, the violinist (see p. 46); in 1932 Julius’s son Boris married Tatiana, Rachmaninoff‘s younger daughter. Meter. Ternary. Amphibrachs, alternating lines of 4 and 3 feet: Remember the evening we rode by the sea, A nightingale sang in the brier... Music. Dated 16–17 July 1891, Ivanovka. Without opus number. E Major. 12/8, [Moderato]. For Middle Voice: e1–a2. First published posthumously in Lamm, 1947. No dedication. Recordings.

Because it was never published, this song follows the other eight unpublished songs in the Moscow edition of the Complete Romances (PSR) and is thus out of chronological order. It was written in June 1899 at the Krasnenkoye estate of the Kreutzer family, where Rachmaninoff was spending the summer (VOR 1, 292-5). Yelena Kreutzer took piano lessons from Rachmaninoff for many years and was a friend of Natalia Satina, Rachmaninoff’s future wife, by that time a student at the Moscow Conservatory. They invited Natasha to visit them in June. In this period of his life Rachmaninoff was performing and conducting, but was still recovering from the botched premiere of his First Symphony and finding it difficult to undertake any large compositions. Hence the jocular words at the top of the manuscript of the song: “No! My muse has not died, dear Natasha. I dedicate my new romance to you.” Yelena and Natasha used the large library at Krasnenkoye to look for good poems to give Rachmaninoff as texts for songs. He dropped in on them one day and started reading himself, whereupon he found this lyric in the poems of Pushkin’s contemporary Prince Vyazemsky (1792–1878). The idea behind this comic song is the notion that if you get the hiccups it means someone must be thinking about you. When Vyazemsky visited Épernay in the champagne district of France he thought of his friend Denis Davydov and wrote this poem to him while drinking champagne in the Moët cellars. Davydov, who was a cavalry officer (and a poet), had once told him the story of how he happened to be in that very place in 1812 with partisans in pursuit of Napoleon’s retreating army. Rachmaninoff used only the first three stanzas, changing the addressee to Natasha, and situating the champagne-drinking in a cellar in Voronezh, a mundane town near Krasnenkoye. He thought it was a huge joke and promised to write a song to those words, and on the next day he performed it with gusto. The song goes from romping gaiety to tender romanticism (there are musical quotes fromTchaikovsky’s opera Eugene Onegin), and the last four words are to be sung “à la hiccup.” Barrie Martyn finds these antics “heavy-handed” and “forced” (Martyn, 121) but Max Harrison defends it as being in the vein of Stravinsky’s nonsense songs (Harrison, 88). In his spirited recording, Sergei Leiferkus reads the words of the dedication before singing the song. Нет! Не умерла моя муза, милая Наташа. Посвящаю тебе мой новый романс.\n\nИкалось ли тебе, Наташа, Когда шампанское я пил Различных вкусов, свойств и видов, Различных возрастов и сил?\n\nNine Unpublished Songs (1890–1899)\n\n27\n\nКогда в воронежских подвалах Я жадно поминал тебя, Любя Наташу, поэтессу, Да и шампанское любя? Здесь бьёт кастальский ключ, питая Небаснословнoю струёй; Поэзия, – здесь вещь ручная: Пять франков дай и пей, и пой! No! My muse has not died, dear Natasha. I dedicate my new romance to you. Ika±las’ li tebe±, Nata±sha, Kagda± shampa±nskaje ja pi±l Razli±chnykh fku±saf, svo±jstf i vi±daf, Razli±chnykh vo±zrastaf i si±l?\n\nWere you hiccuping, Natasha, While I was drinking champagne Of various tastes, characteristics, and kinds, Of varied vintages and strengths?\n\nKagda v varo±neshskikh padva±lakh Ja zha±dna pamina±l tebja±, Ljubja± Nata±shu, poete±ssu, Da i shampa±nskaje ljubja±?\n\nWhen in the cellars of Voronezh I was thinking about you so ardently, Loving Natasha, my poetess, And loving the champagne too?\n\nZde±z’ b’jo±t kasta±l’skij klju±ch, Pita±ja nebasnaslo±vnaju strujo±j; Poe±zija, - zde±s’ ve±shch ruchna±ja: Pja±t’ fra±nkav da±j i pe±j, i po±j!\n\nHere flows a Castalian spring, that inspires Not like the fabled stream [of the Muses]; Here poetry comes in wine by the glass: Pay your five francs, then drink and sing!\n\nText. Prince Piotr Andréyevich Vyázemsky, 1838. Title: Эперне (Épernay, a town in the Champagne district of France). Only Rachmaninoff has set this text. He used only the first 3 of 18 stanzas, changing the references to Davydov to fit Natasha and replacing the cellars of Moët with Voronezh. He added a note to the title which reads “Please read the verses carefully first!” Meter. Binary. Iambic tetrameter: While drinking glasses of champagne Of varied vintages and strengths. Music. Dated 17 May 1899, but this date was written in later, and is probably erroneous; the actual date of June 1899 is given by Kreutzer in her memoir (VOR 1, 292-5). Without opus number. F Major. 4/4, Быстро [Fast]. For LowVoice: c–f1. First published posthumously in Lamm, 1947. Dedicated to the composer’s wife. Recordings. Burchuladze, Crona, Del Grande, Kharitonov, Leiferkus, Nesterenko, Söderström, Suchkova.\n\n28\n\nFirst Published Songs, Opus 4 (1893) 1. Word of a new talent named Rachmaninoff spread quickly. The music publisher Karl Gutheil approached him with an offer to publish Aleko and pay him a fee of 500 rubles for it. He also bought two pieces for cello and piano, Op. 2, and the first set of songs, Op. 4. It was a large sum, but there were delays in getting the money to him, so he took a job giving piano lessons in the summer of 1892 after graduation. He received good fees and became friends with some of his pupils, like Yelena Kreutzer, but he did not like having to teach in order to support himself (VOR 1, 28). Among the works Rachmaninoff composed in 1892–3 were five pieces for piano, called “Morceaux de Fantaisie,” Op. 3, written in the autumn of 1892. The second of these, a Prelude in C-sharp Minor, made an immediate impression when he first played it in Moscow on 26 September 1892, and later that year in Kharkov. His cousin Alexander Siloti played it for the first time outside Russia in London in 1895 (Barber, 61), and first brought it to the U.S. in 1898, where it became a sensation. Rachmaninoff himself played it in England on his first tour there in 1899. It has an arresting beginning, dignified but menacing, with its three-note descending octave unison chords; there is drama in the middle section, and then a chordal climax, a “mournful tolling of bells,” and a final sequence of chords “each held in suspense as the music gradually vanishes into the distance” (Martyn, 69). In an interview published in The Delineator in February 1910, Rachmaninoff cautioned against playing it too loudly or yielding to the temptation to play the final chords as arpeggios. This three-and-a-half to four-minute Prelude in C-sharp Minor became one of the most famous piano works ever written. He sold Op. 3 to Gutheil for 200 rubles, or 40 rubles a piece (about 20 dollars, as he said in his interview for The Delineator during his North American debut in 1909–10); he regretted not publishing the work in Germany to protect his rights, as he did later with other sets of piano works. But since Russia was not a signatory to international copyright agreements, the twenty dollars he received for the Prelude was all he ever got for it. It has been estimated that, had it been protected by copyright, the composer might have made $100,000 on this work alone (Harrison, 50). At any rate, it passed into the public domain, and was played by everyone for free. Rachmaninoff’s recording of it on the Philips “Great Pianists of the 20th Century” set is played exactly as he calls for in the interview above, the melodic lines clearly articulated and the chords not pounded out showily but played with a stately restraint. The prelude became well known beyond the\n\nFirst Published Songs, Opus 4 (1893)\n\n29\n\nworld of classical music. In 1918 George L. Cobb published a Tin Pan Alley instrumental version called “Russian Rag.” It was played by jazz musicians who arranged it, including Duke Ellington (“Cotton Club Nights,” 1938), Jack Teagarden (“It’s Time for T,” 1941), and Nat Cole in his early King Cole Trio period (1944); for many more curious offshoots of the prelude, see Harrison, 227-9. The piece hardly survives Teagarden’s band, but Nat Cole’s version for piano, guitar, and bass conveys a certain respect for the original. Whether Rachmaninoff would have liked it is hard to say, but it is known that he admired Art Tatum’s piano improvisations and Paul Whiteman’s orchestra, and was at Aeolian Hall in 1924 when Whiteman introduced Rhapsody in Blue with George Gershwin as soloist.\n\n2. During Rachmaninoff’s last year at the Conservatory, in late 1891 or early 1892, his friend Yury Sakhnovsky (see Song 11) introduced him to a married woman named Anna Lodyzhenskaya; she was in her mid-twenties, and of Gypsy blood. Her husband Piotr was a dilettante composer and carouser and a friend of Chaliapin’s. He wrote a song which he dedicated to Rachmaninoff, “Those fleeting dreams” (Пронеслись мимолетные грезы, 1896), which Lamm in 1947 mistakenly included in Rachmaninoff’s unpublished songs because a score of the song in Rachmaninoff’s hand was found among his papers (PSR, 326); there are several recordings of this song, including a good one by Nadezhda Obukhova. Anna’s sister Nadezhda Aleksandrova was a well-known singer of “Gypsy” songs whom Rachmaninoff certainly admired; she made recordings of two such songs (Ianin, 418), including “White and Pale (Night Flowers),” a song later in Obukhova’s repertoire and recorded by her. Rachmaninoff found this “Gypsy” company irresistible, and particularly Anna, with her deep-set, dark eyes, her kind manners, her engaged interest in the younger men. After graduation, the evenings he spent at Anna’s were frequent. He called her “Rodnaya,” a term of the closest endearment in Russian, and referred to her by that name with his friends Slonov and Sakhnovsky. In the words of Lyudmila Skalon, she was his “passionate platonic love” (VOR 1, 239). He was living with his cousins the Satins during most of these years. It is not surprising that they disapproved of Anna Lodyzhenskaya; they did not like her and found her “unattractive.” Since so much of what we know about Rachmaninoff comes to us through the Satin sisters, or through Soviet keepers of archives not curious enough to tell us anything about this woman of whom they also disapprove, we have to imagine this relationship rather than construct it out of known facts. But Anna’s hold on Rachmaninoff and his lasting devotion to her cannot be doubted: he would ask Sakhnovsky or Slonov to spend the evening with Rodnaya (“dearest heart”) when he could not go himself; he sent\n\n30\n\nFirst Published Songs, Opus 4 (1893)\n\nmoney to her “regularly” and, years later, sent money to Piotr after she had died (Irina Chaliapin in VOR 2, 177-8). Rachmaninoff dedicated his “Capriccio on Gypsy Themes” (1892–4) to Piotr, his song “Oh, do not grieve” (Song 29, 1896) to Nadezhda, and to Anna he dedicated the first song in Op. 4 (Song 10, 1892) and his First Symphony. In January 1893, when Rachmaninoff and Mikhail Slonov went to Kharkov to give a recital, Anna advised them to “be happy and have fun” (LN 1, 207). During this recital, Slonov, a baritone, performed two songs from Opus 4, including the song dedicated to Anna.\n\n3. When Rachmaninoff and Slonov were in Kharkov, they stayed in the town house of a rich merchant and his wife whom Rachmaninoff had met when he gave his first recital there in December 1892. This couple, the Lysikovs, had a summer estate called “Lebedin” outside town, and they invited the two young men to visit them there in the summer of 1893. For Rachmaninoff it was a productive summer. There he wrote the last two songs of Opus 4, (he dedicated number 5 to Mrs. Lysikova); he also wrote a Suite for Two Pianos (Fantaisie-Tableaux), Op. 5, which he dedicated to Tchaikovsky; two Morceaux de Salon for Violin and Piano, Op. 6; and a Fantasy for Orchestra “The Crag,” Op. 7, which Tchaikovsky promised to include in a concert he was to conduct in January 1894. It was the last work Rachmaninoff showed to Tchaikovsky before Tchaikovsky’s untimel"
