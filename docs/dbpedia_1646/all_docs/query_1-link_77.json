        "text": "Cecil Pollard, the young accountant who saved The Gramophone in 1926, and stayed for the rest of his life\n\nIf the 1920s brought to an end the industry’s infancy, the 1930s were perhaps its teenage years – a period of colossal creative energy, boundless enthusiasm and the establishment of a way of working that remains much the same today. And all this against a background of tough economic conditions. It also gave us quite a few of the first classics of the gramophone, recordings – often first recordings – that have stood the test of time: Pablo Casals playing Bach’s cello suites, Artur Schnabel in the complete Beethoven piano sonatas, some of the earliest recordings of Sibelius symphonies and Hugo Wolf Lieder sung by Elena Gerhardt, all issued by HMV – and masterminded by the young Walter Legge – as Society Editions, and limited to 500 subscribers who paid upfront. (Many years later a reader questioned why no LP reissues of the Schnabel Beethovens had appeared: an obstacle created by the initial subscription concept. Alec Robertson suggested in the magazine’s pages that older subscribers would waive any rights and allow this classic cycle to appear on LP. And this did indeed happen in November 1961. They have not left the catalogue since.)\n\nFred Gaisberg pours the coffee for Artur Schnabel at the Abbey Road Studios Green Room in the early 1930s (photo: Warner Classics)\n\nIn 1932, Christopher Stone stepped up from being London Editor, taking his place as Co-editor of The Gramophone with Mackenzie (Mackenzie’s wife Faith would take on the role of London Editor – their marriage seemed to work best when they weren’t actually living under the same roof!). Another important figure appeared in the magazine’s pages: Edgar Jackson, who tried – unsuccessfully – to modernise the appearance of the magazine, but also took on the coverage of jazz and light music in our pages, a role he held for 28 years. Jackson had been the founding editor of Melody Maker, and he and his American colleague Leonard Feather established their invaluable ‘personnels’ (ie artist listings) that gave The Gramophone’s reviews particular cachet. Jackson also brought onboard the American writer and later record producer John Hammond, who discovered artists like Billie Holiday, Count Basie, Bob Dylan and Benny Goodman (who would later become his brother-in-law).\n\nThe 1930s was a tough decade financially, and Cecil Pollard fought had to keep costs down – the launch and then closure of Vox, a broadcast review edited by Christopher Grieve (aka the poet Hugh McDiarmid) left a nasty dent in the company’s finances. A change of printer helped and in 1938 The Gramophone moved to Gibbs & Bamforth, a company (and its successors) that retained the contract for the next 42 years.\n\nMackenzie would leave The Channel Islands in 1930, taking many of his books and records with him, but the pre-electrical recordings were given a kind of Viking funeral – as Faith Mackenzie recalled, ‘What more dignified end could be devised for them than to be warmed gently on the stove and fluted to fantastic shapes and launched on to a milky sea carrying paper sails on a perfect evening in June.’ (With Mackenzie’s departure from his island, the original company registered in The Channel Islands was liquidated and a new company was floated on the mainland, General Gramophone Publications Limited, the ‘General’ was needed to distinguish it from Hayes-based, The Gramophone Company, home of HMV.)\n\nThe 1930s also saw a new arrival on the classical record scene that very quickly would establish itself as one of the major players, Decca Records. Despite tough economic conditions, the record industry was performing well: the Columbia Graphophone Company’s shares had risen from 11 shillings (55p) in 1923 to nearly £20 in 1929. A young stockbroker, Edward Lewis, was tasked with the flotation of the Barnett Samuel Company, manufacturers of the Decca Dulcephone, the patent for which had been filed in 1914. (The word Decca came about merging the word Mecca with the initial D of Dulcephone – it has the great advantage that it is easy to pronounce in most languages.) Lewis quickly realised that actually making discs to be played on the gramophones they produced would make perfect sense, and in 1929 he bought the Duophone Company in south-west London. The resulting new company was named The Decca Gramophone Company. Another major feather in the young record company’s hat was when Walter Yeomans jumped ship from The Gramophone Company to Decca, bringing considerable expertise of the nascent record business with him. The first recording was of Frederick Delius’s Sea Drift with the baritone Roy Henderson (Henderson’s pupil Kathleen Ferrier would later join the Decca roster and was a hugely important figure as the company moved from 78 to LP in the early 1950s).\n\nRight at the start of the decade (April 1931), the Columbia and Gramophone companies merged to form Electric and Musical Industries Ltd (which later would become known simply as EMI).\n\nAs the decade drew to a close, and with war on the horizon, the gramophone captured a musical event that had far more than just cultural importance. It was the classic recording of Mahler’s Ninth Symphony, recorded live by the Vienna Philharmonic and Bruno Walter (who had conducted the work’s premiere) on January 16, 1938 – almost exactly two months before Hitler annexed Austria, the so-called Anschluss (‘Union’) – and overseen by Fred Gaisberg, one of the great record producers of the pre-Second World War period. (It would come out on 20 78rpm discs, and in the January 1939 issue of The Gramophone, Gaisberg wrote about Dr Bruno Walter with affection and admiration: ‘He has said that he always tries to approach even the oldest and most hackneyed work as though it was a new composition which he was playing for the first time.’)\n\nGramophone in the 1930s: Timeline\n\nMay 1930 First release in Columbia’s ‘History of Music’ series, eventually comprising five sets containing 40 10-inch 78rpm discs\n\nOctober 1930 BBC SO formed, first permanent London orchestra since the LSO (1904).
