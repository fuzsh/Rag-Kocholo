        "text": "This exploratory study focuses on the relationship between vocal expression, musical structure, and emotion in recorded performances by famous singers of three Schubert songs. Measurement of variations in tempo, dynamics, and pitch showed highly systematic relationships with the music&#39;s structural and emotional characteristics, particularly as regards emotional activity and valence. Relationships with emotional activity were consistent across both singers and musical pieces, while relationships with emotional valence were piece-specific. Clear changes in performing style over the twentieth century were observed, including diminishing rubato, an increase followed by a decrease of the use of pitch glides, and a widening and slowing of vibrato. These systematic changes over time concern only the style of performance, not the strategies deployed to express the structural and emotional aspects of the music.\n\nSince the middle of the 19th century, Franz Schubert’s song cycles Die schöne Mullerin and Winterreise are not only considered as an outstanding contribution to the Lied genre, but also as “romantic” compositions par excellence, whose protagonists might be depicted adequately only by performances of male singers. The “masculine nature” (Carl Lafite) of these thoughts, emotions and actions might be inappropriate for female singers. This attitude, which is still present today (even amongst professional musicians and musicologists), though, contradicts not only the performance practice of the early 19th century, but even Schubert’s handling of his songs. In fact, the idea of these two cycles as “men’s cycles” has only developed in the course of the 19th century, when various impacts such as the general upvaluation of the Lied genre, the transfiguration of the composer, the interpretation of his songs as being a personal statement, and the idea of Werktreueshaped the reception of Schubert’s compositions. These factors led to the consolidation of strong and still valid power structures, in which men are regarded as the norm, whereas women (and other alternative voice categories like countertenors) appear as deviation from this norm. These structures are tightly related to similar conditions and principles which have been outlined in the past decades by the masculinity studies on higher levels of our society. In this paper, I will set out this whole process by delineating the performance practice at Schubert’s time, his own attitude (insofar as it is possible), the various influences of romantic musical aesthetics, and the development of the mentioned performance tradition towards the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. Furthermore, a number of statements from the 21st century will demonstrate that these concepts are still common today, and I will correlate them with some certain principles pointed out by masculinity studies from the last decades.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, the performance practice of baroque music has undergone many stylistic changes. Moreover, the rich resources of primary source material available to us in musical recordings of the period have only recently been realised. Bruce Haynes, in his book The End of Early Music, suggests that the twentieth century saw three principal schools of performance: romantic, modernist, and historically-informed. This study investigates Haynes&#39; hypothesis through a comparison of fourteen recordings of Bach&#39;s Solo Violin Sonata in A minor BWV 1003, ranging from 1933 to 1999. Focus is made on eight predetermined observation criteria: tempo, tempo fluctuation, rhythmic alteration, accentuation, articulation, portamento, vibrato, and ornamentation. Each criterion is discussed with reference to the secondary literature and observations of each recording are compiled in a systematic fashion. Each ofthe three schools (romantic, modernist, and historically-informed) is p...\n\nPerformance practice denotes the study of information relevant to the performance and perception of music in various historical contexts. Such information may be found in manuscript and printed scores, mechanical or electrical recording devices, music and dance treatises, books and letters, media accounts and visual documentation of concert settings, instrument designs and TEMPERAMENTS, and so on. A temporal art, live music can only manifest itself in ever-varied performances, yet it “remains unchanged behind this relativity” (Rosen). The relationship between the absolute and the relative aspects of music constitutes the basic concern of performance practice. Depending on the resolution of this relationship, two orientations have evolved. The first asserts the inherent value of the past, seen as a repository of the composer’s intentions, and hence the source of presumably immutable truths about proper musical performance. By contrast, the second orientation affirms the all-important contribution of the present, seen not necessarily as a corrupting factor but rather as a re-creative one without whose impulse music would ossify into a lifeless repetition of the past. The three major topics of performance practice—notation, perception, and instruments—will be treated from the often conflicting perspectives of the two orientations, and exemplified by findings of contemporary research."
