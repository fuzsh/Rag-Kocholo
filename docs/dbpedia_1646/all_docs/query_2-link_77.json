Three Czech composers who suffered Nazi persecution\n\nIn March 1939 German troops took over what was left of the Czech Republic after the Munich Agreement and Hitler named the region \"Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia\". Allegedly, this meant that the Third Reich would protect the country. In fact it deprived its inhabitants of many rights. Most severely it affected the Jews. Jewish musicians were banned from their profession and some time later they were forbidden even to own a musical instrument. The assasination of Reinhard Heydrich was the most sensational act of resistance. In a more secret way, there was also resistance amongst musicians. This was demonstrated in our four concerts, featuring three different composers.\n\nKindly supported by: Deutsch-Tschechischer Zukunftsfonds,\n\nErnst von Siemens Musikstiftung and Bareva Foundation\n\nCo-operation partners: Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gedächtniskirche Berlin\n\nand Staatsbibliothek zu Berlin (Berlin State Library)\n\n+ 14.

He had already been a successful composer when he was banned from his profession because his wife was Jewish.

It could be heard in the movie Les portes de la nuit, sung by Yves Montand.\n\nJoseph Kosma was born in Budapest, he studied with Béla Bartók and became a proponent of modernism. While living in Berlin he joined the circle around Eisler, Brecht and Weill. In 1933 he emigrated to Paris. He co-operated with the poet Jacques Prévert and together they were formative for the chanson of their time. During the war under German occupation, Kosma composed music for films, while his name didn't show up in the credits but instead those of some of his friends.\n\nStefanie Wüst, soprano\n\nChristopher Arpin, piano\n\nKrisztian Palagyi, accordeon\n\nHabakuk Traber talked with Prof. Manuela Schwartz\n\nThis concert was supported by Bareva Foundation\n\n(161) 11. January 2024 \"Persecution and Rediscovery\"\n\nKonzerthaus Berlin, Musikclub\n\n+ Maria Herz (1878-1950) - Composer between Germany and England\n\nMaria Herz, pianist and composer from Cologne, emigrated to England already around 1900 because of strong anti-semitic tendecies in Germany. In England she organised concerts, sometimes also performing her own music. When WWI broke out she happened to be in Cologne. It was meant to be just a visit but because of the war she could not return, and even after the war she stayed in Germany. When her husband died in 1920 she had to struggle to earn a living but nevertheless resumed composing. For some time she studied with Philipp Jarnach. In 1935 she fled to England for the second time.\n\nFour Little Pieces for string quartet, Op. 5\n\nString quartet, Op. 6\n\nAsasello Quartet: Rostislav Kozhevnikov and Barbara Streil (violins), Justyna Sliwa (viola), Teemu Myöhänen (cello)\n\nAlbrecht Dümling talked with Albert Herz (the composer's grandson) and Heinrich Aerni (Zentralbibliothek Zurich) and Christiane Silber (conductor, Berlin).\n\nThis concert was supported by Bareva Foundation\n\n2023\n\n(160) 9.

The composer and cellist Joachim Stutschewsky (1891-1982)\n\n\"A life without compromises\" - that's the title Joachim Stutschewsky gave to his memoirs which have not yet been published. He was born into a family of Klezmorim in what is now Ukraine, playing the violin from early childhood, but as a teenager he took up the cello. In the 1920's he was a founding member of the Kolisch Quartet and thus stood in the center of the musical avant-garde. He also was the key person in the society for the promotion of Jewish music (\"Verein zur Förderung jüdischer Musik\") in Vienna. In 1938 he fled to Palestine. There however he gained little recognition for his uncompromising commitment to Jewish music. In his own music Stutschewsky amalgamated the traditional Klezmer tone with, in places, modernist stylistic elements.\n\nSchir Jehudi / Jewish Song (1937)\n\nAndante religioso (1942)\n\nM'chol kedem / Oriental Dance (1923)\n\nFour Jewish dance pieces for piano (1929)\n\nIsraeli Suite (1942)\n\nJoel Blido, cello\n\nJascha Nemtsov, piano\n\nJascha Nemtsov talked with Walter Labhart\n\nThis concert was supported by Bareva Foundation\n\n(159) 26. October 2023 \"Persecution and Rediscovery\"\n\nKonzerthaus Berlin, Musikclub\n\n+ Repeatedly uprooted - the Polish-Jewish composer Jerzy Fitelberg\n\nJerzy Fitelberg (1903-1951) was born in Warsaw. His father was the conductor and composer Gregorz Fitelberg. Jerzy F. studied in Berlin with Franz Schreker and quickly became one of the most successful young composers in the German capital. He was also connected internationally. His string quartet No. 2 war performed at the ISCM festival in Geneva in 1929, his second violin concerto in Vienna 1932. Also in later years his music was performed at the ISCM festivals several times.\n\nIn 1933 he emigrated to Paris and in 1940, just in time before Paris was occupied by the Germans, he fled to New York. He became a citizen of the United States in 1947. In 1951 Jerzy Fitelberg died in New York. 5 string quartets have major importance in Fitelberg's varied, mostly instrumental oeuvre.\n\nString quartet No. 1 (1926)\n\nfrom String quartet No. 4 (1936): Theme, excerpts from variations No. 1-6, Coda\n\nfrom String quartet No. 5 (1945): 2. movement Tema con variazioni and 3. movement Vivace\n\nFitelberg Quartet (Krakow): Aleksander Daskiewicz, Nikola Frankiewicz, Paweł Riess, Jakob Gajownik\n\nGottfried Eberle talked with Christoph Slowinski\n\nThis concert was supported by Bareva Foundation\n\n(158) 15. June 2023 \"Persecution and Rediscovery\"\n\nKonzerthaus Berlin, Musikclub\n\n+ Bronislaw Huberman - Violinist and campaigner for a united Europe\n\nBronislaw Huberman (1882 - 1947) started an early international career as a violinist at age 11. He was born in Czestochowa in the Russian Empire (now Poland). The outbreak of WWI meant a great shock to him. He campaigned for the unification of Europe which he considered the only way to achieve peace. Later he made great efforts to rescue German Jews from Hitler. He was influential in founding an orchestra in Palestine which later turned into the world-famous Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. The program of our concert included pieces which had been regularly performed by Huberman. His own violin playing was heard on historical records with music by Schubert, Brahms and Sarasate.\n\nJohannes Brahms: Scherzo c minor WoO 2 (1853, from FAE-Sonata)\n\nNiccolò Paganini: Caprice No. 24, arr. for violin and piano by Karol Szymanowski\n\nMax Bruch: Kol Nidre (arr. by Huberman)\n\nLudwig van Beethoven: Andante con variazioni from sonata in A Major, Op. 47 (\"Kreutzer sonata\")\n\nJudith Ingolfsson, violin\n\nVladimir Stoupel, piano\n\nAlbrecht Dümling talked with Harald Eggebrecht and Habakuk Traber\n\nThis concert was supported by Bareva Foundation\n\n(157) 19. May 2023 \"Persecution and Rediscovery\"\n\nKonzerthaus Berlin, Musikclub\n\n+ Prodigy, enfant terrible, early completed - the fantastic story of Polish-Jewish composer André Tchaikowsky\n\nAndré Tchaikowsky has been known mainly as a pianist. Among connoisseurs, his performances of Bach, Chopin and Ravel were legend. When his opera \"The Merchant of Venice\" received its posthumous world premiere at Bregenz Festival in 2013, people began to recognise Tchaikowsky the composer, too.\n\nHe was born Robert Andrzej Krauthammer in Warsaw in 1935. At the age of 5 he and his mother were forced to live in the Ghetto. She perished in the Holocaust, but the boy survived thanks to his daring grandmother, who provided a false identity and secret hiding places for him. After the war, he kept his acquired name Czajkowsky. Artur Rubinstein, among others, promoted him in the first years of his career as a pianist. Over the years, Tchaikowsky put more and more effort into composing. He produced a small number of impressive works which show some influence from the Second Viennese School and which are steeped in virtuosity, subtle irony and deep melancholy. He died of cancer in London in 1982 at the age of 46.\n\nSonata for clarinet and piano\n\nInventions for piano op. 2, No. 1-8, 10\n\nSeven Sonnets of Shakespeare, No. 2, 4 und 5\n\nKatarzyna Wasiak, piano\n\nAnia Vegry, soprano\n\nRuben Staub, clarinet\n\nPeter Sarkar talked with Frank Harders-Wuthenow and Katarzyna Wasiak\n\nThis concert was supported by Bareva Foundation\n\n(156) 23. March 2023 \"Persecution and Rediscovery\"\n\nKonzerthaus Berlin, Musikclub\n\n+ Ursula Mamlok and Black Mountain College. To the composer's 100th anniversary\n\nWhen Hitler came to power in 1933, the multidisciplinary art school \"Bauhaus\" was forced to disband itself. Many of its former members followed an invitation to the newly founded Black Mountain College in Asheville (North Carolina). From 1944 BMC offered summer classes. Quite a number of the music instructors were immigrants, e.g. Ernst Krenek, Eduard Steuermann, Heinrich Jalowetz, Stefan Wolpe, and the violinist Rudolf Kolisch. The composer Ursula Mamlok (1923 - 2016) who had been born in Berlin, visited the first of these summer classes. There she composed her \"Three Part Fugue\", under Krenek's supervision. Our concert is dedicated to Mamlok to commemorate her 100th anniversary.\n\nMusic by Ursula Mamlok: Three Part Fugue for piano (1944)\n\nThe Birds Dream Six Short Pieces for piano (1944)\n\nVariations for flute solo (1960)\n\nErnst Krenek: 3.

Paris, 1972) was one of the key personalities in 20th century music, as a conductor, composer and music theorist. For a short while he lived in Berlin before moving on to Paris by the end of the 1920's. There he met Rudolf Kolisch, who introduced him to the performance style of the Second Viennese School. Erich Itor Kahn taught him the principles of dodecaphony and Paul Dessau conducting. Dessau had also fled to Paris. The three men formed a close partnership which is mirrored in several pieces they dedicated to each other. During the German occupation in France, Leibowitz tightened his ties to Schönberg.\n\nMusic by René Leibowitz: Deux Mélodies (after Fr. Hölderlin and H. v.

He grew up in Berlin and showed extraordinary gifts as a musician early on. Franz Schreker took him as a student of composing at the age of 14. Strasfogel also joined Leonid Kreutzer's piano master class, and he studied conducting with Julius Prüwer. For 2½ years he worked at Berlin State Opera, but in 1933 he was dismissed. In December 1933 he found a new home in the United States and he was lucky to find a good position: He joined the New York Philharmonic Orchestra as Official Pianist (1935-1945). 1946 he made an attempt to re-establish himself as a composer, but he didn't get any response. Thus he continued to work chiefly as répétiteur and conductor, at Metropolitan Opera (1951-74) and later in Strasbourg. Only in 1983 he began to compose again, after 35 years of silence. In 1991 Kolja Lessing initiated Strasfogel's re-discovery as a composer.\n\nDuet for Violin and Piano (1991, dedicated to Kolja Lessing and Rainer Klaas)\n\nPrélude and Elegie for guitar (1946) from: Prélude, Elegie and Rondo for guitar (dedicated to Andrés Segovia)\n\nRondo (Variations) for piano (1988/89)\n\nVariations on a Well-known Tune (A Child's Day) (1946, dedicated to Ian Strasfogel)\n\nFranz Schreker: Wiegenlied der Els (from the opera Der Schatzgräber), Piano transcription by Ignace Strasfogel (1926)\n\nPerformers:\n\nKolja Lessing, piano\n\nDaniella Strasfogel, violin\n\nJohannes Monno, guitar\n\nKolja Lessing, Ian Strasfogel and Johannes Monno talked with Peter Sarkar.\n\nThis concert was supported by Bareva Foundation\n\n(153) 22. October 2022 \"Persecution and Rediscovery\"\n\nKonzerthaus Berlin, Werner-Otto-Saal\n\n+ \"... I owe Webern my purpose in life ...\" - The composer Philip Herschkowitz\n\nAs a private tutor he was most sought after - in the 1980's his apartment in Moscow became a place to go for musicians like Elisabeth Leonskaja, Dmitri Smirnov or Elena Firsova.\n\nPhilip Herschkowitz was born in Iași (Romania) in 1906. After finishing his studies at the conservatory in his home town he moved to Vienna. Anton Webern made a huge impression on him in those years in Vienna. After the Austrian \"Anschluss\" in 1938, the Romanian authorities refused to let him move back into his country under the pretext that he was a Jew who had been living abroad. The following odyssey brought him as far as Tashkent. After the war, he settled in Moscow. Since his music didn't conform to the doctrine of \"Socialist Realism\", he was nearly completely excluded from public musical life. He had to earn a living giving private lessons. Finally, in 1987, he was allowed to move to Vienna, but a few months later he died there. Most of his compositions have never been published.\n\nArnold Schönberg: Sechs kleine Klavierstücke, Op. 19\n\nPh.

May 2022 \"Persecution and Rediscovery\"\n\nKonzerthaus Berlin, Kleiner Saal\n\n+ Escape in the very last moment: Hans Heller (1898-1969), a pupil of Franz Schreker\n\nThe German-Jewish musician Hans Heller could no longer pursue his career as a pianist when he got injured in WWI. Thus he decided to become a composer. He studied as a private pupil with Franz Schreker. He made quick progress, as can be seen in his piano sonata, written in 1926 for the pianist Inge Eichwede who later became his wife. Together they escaped the Nazi regime to Paris. Here Heller composed a couple of major works, despite unsatisfactory living conditions. When France fell under German rule he was interned and coerced to forced labour. In the very last moment he escaped being deported to a termination camp. After the war the Hellers lived in the US but returned to West Berlin in 1955.\n\nPiano sonata Op. 3 (Berlin 1926)\n\nVom kleinen Alltag op. 8.

In his desperation he took a post in Iceland. In the end he stayed there for the rest of his life. In these 20 years he played an important role in different fields of music in Iceland, e.g. by conducting the first opera performances at the newly founded National Theatre of Iceland.

At the age of 20 he moved to Berlin. There he founded a string quartet ensemble. Being Jewish, he didn't get any concert engagements from 1933. Thus he enrolled as concertmaster of the newly founded orchestra of the \"Kulturbund Deutscher Juden\". Bronisław Huberman invited him to join the Palestine Symphony Orchestra, so Pártos played solo viola in this orchestra from 1938 to 1956. Composing was of equal importance to him.

Viennese School\n\nThe Second Viennese School was a cornerstone within the multitude of musical tendencies of the 1920's. The Schoenbergians did share some fundamental beliefs but they were individualists nevertheless. Ernst Bachrich, who studied with Schoenberg 1916-19, was one of them. In the following years Bachrich played a vital role in Schoenberg's \"Society for Private Musical Performances\" (as pianist and secretary). As a composer of songs, chamber and piano music he found his own voice. He conducted at the Vienna Volksoper and later (1928-32) in the Rhineland. In 1932 he returned to Vienna and contributed to the city's musical life as pianist, conductor and co-organiser of the concert series \"Musik der Gegenwart\". In 1938 he was blacklisted but he continued composing and promoting his music. He was deported to Izbica Ghetto (Poland) in May 1942 and killed in Majdanek concentration camp a few weeks later.\n\nPsalm op. 10,1 (Lyrics: Emil Arnold Holm)\n\nOsterblüte op. 10,2 (Greta Bauer-Schwind)\n\nPortraits: Three piano pieces op. 6\n\n- Vivace impetuoso\n\n- Lento con abandono\n\n- Improvisation on an American folk tune\n\nL'Angelus (folk tune from Brittany)\n\nThree songs op. 3\n\n- Bestimmung (Christian Morgenstern)\n\n- Schlummernd im schwellenden Grün (Friedrich Hebbel)\n\n- Winter (Theodor Däubler)\n\nPiano sonata op. 1\n\nDie frühen Verse op. 15 (Melodrama, Emil Arnold Holm)\n\nAnna Christin Sayn, soprano\n\nAlexander Breitenbach, piano\n\nFrank Harders-Wuthenow, Anna Christin Sayn and Alexander Breitenbach talked with Peter Sarkar\n\nSupported by the Harald Genzmer Foundation\n\n(148) 10.

His wife Irma Wolpe Rademacher was one of the most important interpreters of his compositions. She performed in Bucharest, Berlin, Paris and Palestine and was internationally highly regarded. Both were active members of the left-wing cultural organisation \"Novembergruppe\". The couple lived in Berlin until March 1933, when the Nazis made a large-scale raid. Being Jewish, Irma was aware of the danger. Her political foresight and her network saved her husband's and her own life. The odyssey of their escape took them through Cheb (Czechoslovakia), Bucharest, Vienna and Zurich, as far as to Jerusalem, and finally to New York. In our days both musicians are little noticed in the music history.\n\nThis concert has been dedicated to the memory of Austin Clarkson (*1932 - 13. March 2021). He was musicologist, professor at York University, Toronto, and chairman of the Stefan Wolpe Society. He had studied with Wolpe and became his friend.

Julius Stern's 200. anniversary\n\n170 years ago, the Musikschule für Gesang, Klavier und Komposition (Music school for voice, piano and composition) was founded in Berlin. Julius Stern was one of the founders. In 1857 the institution was renamed Stern'sches Konservatorium. Stern also founded the choir Stern'scher Gesangverein, which together with the court orchestra (Königliche Kapelle) had its first appearance 1851 at the \"Schauspielhaus\" (which is nowadays Berlin Konzerthaus).\n\nIn 1935 Stern'sches Konservatorium was \"Arianised\" by ejecting all Jewish teachers and students. Some of them then founded the Jüdische private Musikschule Hollaender on their own premises.

For example, Ernst Toch lost his income because his music would not be performed any more in Germany. Like him Paul Hindemith was driven into exile.\n\nIn his talk with Albrecht Dümling Peter Hanser-Strecker explained how his long-standing publishing house reacted to the pressure from the Nazi regime and why, later, they made an effort to publish and to distribute Viktor Ullmann`s music.\n\nErnst Toch: The Juggler for piano solo, op. 21 (1923) and four songs from: Neun Lieder op. 41 (1928)\n\nPaul Hindemith: Sonata for Oboe and piano (1938)\n\nViktor Ullmann: Abendphantasie after Friedrich Hölderlin for Soprano and piano (1943) and first movement of Piano sonata No. 6, op. 49 (1943).\n\nPerformers: Anna Maria Pammer (soprano), Viola Wilmsen (oboe) and Holger Groschopp (piano).\n\nAlbrecht Dümling talked with Peter Hanser-Strecker\n\n(143) 20.

The Nazis found justification to ban him from his profession in nothing more than his inclination towards the left. Schröder sent his Jewish wife and their daughter to the countryside, away from Berlin. Meanwhile, in his Berlin home, he gave shelter to a Jewish couple, who could therefore survive. After the war, the Schröders worked in the eastern part of Berlin but were cut off when the wall was erected.

At first, each of them started an international career, but it was cut short when the Nazis came to power in 1933.

After living in France for one year, some friends helped him to emigrate to Denmark. In 1943 he became Danish citizen, shortly before he had to move on: in the course of the rescue of Danish Jews he was brought to Sweden, together with his wife and three children.

Thus a number of musicians, who suffered persecution as Jews in Germany, could find refuge in Japan: Manfred Gurlitt, Joseph Rosenstock, Klaus Pringsheim and Leonid Kreutzer. Together with Josef Laska, who had arrived there earlier, they made a substantial contribution to Japan's musical life.\n\nJoseph Rosenstock: Sonata for piano, 1. movement\n\nManfred Gurlitt: Piano Quintet, 2nd movement\n\nPieces by Klaus Pringsheim and Josef Laska\n\nPerformers:\n\nWolfgang Bender and Gisela Bender, violins\n\nChristiane Buchenau, viola\n\nMaria Magdalena Wiesmaier, cello\n\nAntonis Anissegos, piano\n\nIrene Suchy, musicologist from Vienna and expert on this subject, talked with Peter Sarkar\n\n(106) 28.

He had to earn his living by writing the piano scores for his more successful brother Leo's operettas (1873-1925).

His first place of exile was France, where he devoted himself to his Jewishness, to socialism and to the musical avant-garde more strenuously than before. This can also be seen in his compositions. Pieces with mass impact like Thälmannkolonne are accompanied by complex piano pieces such as Guernica. The most influential personalities for Dessau were Bertolt Brecht and Arnold Schoenberg; once he had finally arrived in Los Angeles, he co-operated directly with them. They also crystallised his view of Germany.\n\nTwo Songs for Bass and Piano after Langston Hughes (1934)\n\nGuernica for piano (1938)\n\nJewish Dance for violin and piano (1940)\n\nThree pieces for violin with piano accompaniment(1941/42)\n\n\"Deutschland\" and \"Das deutsche Miserere\" (Brecht, 1943) for voice and piano\n\nEleven Jewish Folk Dances for piano (1946)\n\nPerformers: Holger Groschopp, piano\n\nMax Simon, violin\n\nJohannes Schwärsky, baritone\n\nGuest: Maxim Dessau, the composer's son\n\nModeration: Albrecht Dümling\n\n2012\n\n(104) 18.

From early childhood, life had not been easy for him, but he finally made his way as a composer, producing more than 200 works. In the 1930s he was quite successful and he won several prizes. But because he had studied with Arnold Schoenberg in Berlin, the Nazis obstructed his career. Thus he was hard-pressed for money, and this may have led to his mental disorder that in 1944 caused his committal to the lunatic asylum in Obrawalde.\n\nSuite for viola and piano\n\nPiano sonatas No. 6 and No. 3\n\n4 songs after different poets:\n\nDie Türen (Ernst Lissauer)\n\nGlück (Ernst Collin Schonfeld)\n\nMohn, roter Mohn (Jenny Boese)\n\nZeitgeist (Friedrich Hölderlin)\n\n4 songs after Rainer Maria Rilke\n\nVenedig\n\nTodeserfahrung\n\nVorgefühl\n\nLiebes-Lied\n\nPerformers: Moritz Ernst, piano\n\nIrena Troupová, soprano\n\nJean-Claude Velin, viola\n\nGottfried Eberle talked with Albert Breier\n\n(103) 28.

Entirely unknown is the fact that he composed chamber music while living in New York around 1950.\n\nGeorg Kreisler had planned to take part in the event on 29 October and was looking forward to it immensely.

But who is the man behind this splendid parody? Franz Reizenstein, being Jewish, fled from Berlin in 1934, where he had studied composition with Paul Hindemith and piano with Leonid Kreutzer. During the war he was interned in England as an \"enemy alien\", but later he became a British citizen and gained a professorship at the Royal College of Music in London.

In 1938 the Schönthals fled from Germany, first to Stockholm, then, in 1941, to Mexico City, where Ruth continued her studies. She has had considerable success as pianist and as composer. In 1946 she met Paul Hindemith and went to study with him at Yale University, until 1948.\n\nThe outstanding feature of her music is the fusion of different stylistic elements from the traditions of Europe, Mexican folk music, and aleatoric and minimalist music.\n\nReverberations - Nachklänge (1967-1974)\n\nSonata in Two Movements for cello and piano (1989)\n\nExcerpts from: Sonatina(1939)\n\nVariations in Search of a Theme (1976)\n\nThe Canticles of Hieronymus (1986)\n\nPerformers: Adina Mornell, piano\n\nJohanna Kotschy, cello\n\nBettina Brand talks with Adina Mornell\n\n2010\n\n(96) 16.

May 2009 \"Persecution and Rediscovery\"\n\nKonzerthaus am Gendarmenmarkt Berlin, Musikclub\n\n+ Returning to a foreign Homeland: Friedrich Hollaender\n\nHollaender's fate is characteristic for many of those who fled from the Nazi regime and returned to Germany after the war. He was a celebrated cabaret artist, composer and pianist in the 1920's, he worked together with Tucholsky, Klabund and Mehring at the cabaret \"Schall and Rauch\", and he had his own stage named \"Tingel- Tangel\". One of his most famous titles was Ich bin von Kopf bis Fuß auf Liebe eingestellt. He emigrated in 1933. In Hollywood he failed to re-establish his \"Tingel-Tangel\" in 1934, but he succeeded as a composer for the movies. In the 1950's he returned to Germany. But was he well received? The lecture recital focused on Hollaender's experience as a \"remigrant\" in postwar Germany.\n\n- Wenn der Mond, wenn der Mond\n\n- Tauentzienmädel\n\n- Nass oder trocken\n\n- Du bist die Frau\n\n- Münchhausen (Lügenlied)\n\n- An allem sind die Juden schuld\n\n- Trinkgeld\n\n- Ja, wenn die Musik nicht wär\n\n- Das ist zu machen, mein Schatz\n\n- Emigrantenballade (excerpts)\n\n- Ich ruf Sie an\n\n- Totale Verfremdung\n\n- Wie man sich unsichtbar macht\n\n- Der Song vom Stottern\n\n- Da lumpada lumpa\n\n- Spötterdämmerung\n\nPerformers: Maria Thomaschke and Andreas Jocksch - voices\n\nManfred Schmidt - piano\n\nOlaf Taube - vibraphone/percussion\n\nMartin Genschow - double bass\n\nWinfried Radeke - Arrangements, moderation and conception\n\nVolker Kühn talked with Winfried Radeke.\n\n(87) 6.

Widely unknown is his musical output, although he composed around 40 works. In his early years he wrote mainly songs. Shortly before German troops occupied Prague he escaped to Palestine. Until his death he was dramatic adviser at the national theatre Habimah. In Palestine he also resumed his career as a composer.
