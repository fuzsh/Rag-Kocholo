        "text": "The effect of the National Socialist revolution on musical life in Germany was described to a Manchester Guardian reporter yesterday by Miss Ann Broadhurst, a young singer, whose home is at Leigh, Lancashire, and who returned a few days ago from a stay of ten months in Leipzig, where she has been studying at the Conservatorium.\n\n“Music has received a terrible setback since the elections of March,” she said. “It is not so much that there is active hostility to musicians, or to the practice of the arts in general, as that the atmosphere of the country is one- in which artists cannot work and study. People have no time for music in Germany now. I know and admire the Germans, and I remember how striking their enthusiasm for music seemed to me when I first went there. Even the poorest people knew and appreciated the great composers, and could sing long passages front them. All that is gone, for the time being at any rate. Political excitement is so high that it is doubtful whether a recital will get support.\n\nOf course, a great deal of damage has been done directly by the movement against the Jews. In May the Leipzig Conservatorium decided to hold a week’s festival in commemoration of Brahms. But the grandmother of Brahms was a Jewess. A letter was received from the authorities, asking whether it was absolutely necessary to carry out this programme. The Conservatorium replied that they had made elaborate and costly preparations, and that it would be extremely inconvenient to cancel it. The Government then said that they would allow it on this occasion on condition that the event did not recur. The same ban has fallen on the works of Mahler, Mendelssohn, and other Jewish composers.\n\nThe Salzburg Festival is suffering badly this year from the fact that German visitors to Austria are subject to a special tax of 1,000 marks (about £75), imposed by the German Government. This is, of course, a purely political measure, but music suffers by it.\n\nThe expulsion of Jewish musicians has had its effect, too. The case of Bruno Walter is now notorious. He will never conduct at the Gewandhaus in Leipzig again, I suppose. It is a strange thing, because he was so popular there, and had an enormous following of the real German kind. Dr. Fritz Kohl, the husband of Elena Gerhardt, the singer, has been removed from the directorship of the Leipzig wireless station for political reasons, and that is another loss.”\n\nMiss Broadhurst found the Germans consistently friendly and pleasing in ordinary society; but when she found that one of her letters home had been opened in transit she gave up writing fully to her relatives and destroyed her private papers, which contained nothing but personal correspondence and press cuttings. “The only thing I kept was a series of articles clipped from the Manchester Guardian on the Polish Corridor,” she said."
