Having early decided against an operatic career, she made an international reputation as an exponent of German song. Her interpretation of the songs of Hugo Wolf was considered unsurpassed in her day. In 1933 she settled in London, where she developed her career as a teacher. She gave her last recital at Liverpool in 1947."
