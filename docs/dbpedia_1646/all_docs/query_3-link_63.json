        "text": "Paul Cabanel was born in Oran. After studies of law he trained as a singer at the local conservatory and at the Conservatoire National de Paris. During military service he was severely wounded at the Verdun battle in 1916 and was not able to continue his studies until 1919. He made his debut as Hérode in Massenet’s Hérodiade at Kairo where he also appeared in Manon, Faust and Thaïs. Until 1932 he sang at various provincial opera houses also making some guest appearances in Belgium and Switzerland. He was engaged at the opera of Bordeaux during seven seasons as well as at the opera of Vichy. It was not until 1932 (!) that he made his debut at the Opéra-Comique as Scarpia where his singing was immediately warmly received. The following year he succeeded at the Grand Opéra as Méphistophélès in Berlioz’ La Damnation de Faust which became his most famous role. Cabanel became an admired member at both opera houses. His further repertory included Leporello, the High Priest in Samson et Dalila, Escamillo, Tonio, Figaro, Nikalantha, Basile, Colline, the four villains in Les Contes d’Hoffmann, Papageno, Frère Laurent and Arkel in Pelléas et Mélisande including a number of Wagnerian roles. He appeared as Mephistophélès in Gounod’s Faust more than 1000 times! The artist was engaged at the operas of Rio de Janeiro, the Teatro Colón, the Teatro Liceo Barcelona and at Amsterdam. He was particularly admired at the Théâtre de la Monnaie in Brussels where he sang Boris at the end of his career in 1954. From 1942 to 1958 he was a sought-after singing coach at the Conservatoire National de Paris.\n\nCharles Cambon, Paul Cabanel and Hélène Bouvier, rehearsing “Samson et Dalila”\n\nTino Pattiera (27 June 1890 – 24 April 1966) was a Croatian-Dalmatian Italian tenor, born in Cavtat, near Dubrovnik.\n\nPrior to taking up the repertory for which he became famous, he was notable in operetta.\n\nPattiera was a handsome man with an exceptional, dark heroic tenor voice, that was, some say, perfectly suited for roles such as Manrico in Il trovatore. It was in this role that he made his stage debut at the Dresden Opera in 1914 and it was in the Italian repertoire that he specialized. Among his closest friends and colleagues during the early days at Dresden were Richard Tauber and Elisabeth Rethberg.\n\nPattiera was the most popular tenor in Dresden in the 1920s. It was during that time he partnered with the soprano Meta Seinemeyer and was responsible for a resurgence of interest in Giuseppe Verdi’s operas in Germany. Singing with Seinemeyer under Fritz Busch, they gave performances of La forza del destino and Don Carlos in notable productions.\n\nIn addition to his work in Dresden in the Italian repertoire, Pattiera sang Tannhäuser and the role of Bacchus in Ariadne auf Naxos, was a guest artist in several European cities, and joined the Chicago Opera Company for the 1920/21 season.\n\nOn 31 January 1925, the Dresden premiere of Umberto Giordano’s Andrea Chénier was given with Seinemeyer as Maddalena. It won praise from the composer himself, who was in the audience. Tino Pattiera, who became her most famous stage and recording partner, sang the title role.\n\nOn occasion compared with Caruso during his partnership with Seinemeyer, Steane notes “that Dresdeners are said to have compared their performances together to the Melba-Caruso evenings at Covent Garden.[2]\n\nPattiera gave his last performance in 1953 in Dresden and then retired, after which he taught in Vienna. He died in 1966 and is buried in his hometown of Cavtat.\n\nMichel Dens (22 June 1911 in Roubaix – 19 December 2000 in Paris) was a French baritone, particularly associated with the French repertory, both opera and operetta.\n\nBorn Maurice Marcel, the son of a journalist, he studied at the Academy of Music in Roubaix. He made his debut at the Opéra de Lille, as Wagner in Gounod’s Faust, in 1934, and remained there as a member until 1936. Thereafter he sang at the Opera Houses of Bordeaux, Grenoble, Toulouse and Marseille. In 1943, he was heard at the Monte Carlo Opera as Escamillo, Valentin, and the Count in Le nozze di Figaro.\n\nAfter the Second World War, he began a very successful career at the Opéra-Comique and the Palais Garnier in Paris. His roles at the Opéra-Comique included; Figaro, Lescaut, Zurga, Frédéric, Ourrias, Dapertutto, Alfio, Marcello, Scarpia, et al., he took part there in the creation of Emmanuel Bondeville’s Madame Bovary, on 1 June 1951.\n\nHis debut role at the Opéra in 1947 was in the title role of Rigoletto, he also sang there as Enrico in Lucia di Lammermoor, Hérode in Hérodiade, Athanaël in Thais, et al. He appeared with success at the Aix-en-Provence Festival and at most of the great Opera Houses of France.\n\nHe also appeared in Belgium, Switzerland, Canada, and North Africa.\n\nHe enjoyed a remarkably long and successful career, singing in opera as late as 1979, and also attaining magnificent success in French and Viennese operettas, notably in Lehár’s The Land of Smiles and The Merry Widow. He also sang in works by Louis Varney, Robert Planquette, Charles Lecocq, André Messager, and others. As late as 1992, he gave concerts in Paris and Marseille. He was made a Chevalier de la Légion d’honneur.\n\nDens sang an estimated 10,000 performances during his long career.\n\nSir Peter Pears, in full Sir Peter Neville Luard Pears (born June 22, 1910, Farnham, Surrey, England—died April 3, 1986, Aldeburgh, Suffolk), British tenor, a singer of outstanding skill and subtlety who was closely associated with the works of Sir Benjamin Britten. He received a knighthood in 1977.\n\nPears studied at the University of Oxford, at the Royal College of Music, and then with Elena Gerhardt and Dawson Freer. In 1936 he met Britten, and in 1938 he gave the first of many song recitals with Britten as accompanist. The two men became lifelong companions. In 1942 Pears made his opera debut in London in Jacques Offenbach’s Tales of Hoffmann. He then joined the Sadler’s Wells Opera, where he created the title role in Britten’s Peter Grimes (1945). In 1946 Pears helped Britten found the English Opera Group, and in 1947 they were instrumental in founding the Aldeburgh Festival.\n\nPears sang in the first performances of all of Britten’s operas, including Albert Herring, Billy Budd, Owen Wingrave, and Death in Venice.
