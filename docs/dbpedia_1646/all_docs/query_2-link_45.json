        "text": "The Chicago Symphony Orchestra family mourns the loss of legendary American pianist Byron Janis. He died in Manhattan on March 14, 2024, at the age of ninety-five.\n\nJanis made his professional debut at the age of fifteen in 1943, performing Rachmaninov’s Second Piano Concerto with the NBC Symphony Orchestra, under the baton of Frank Black. The following year, he was chosen by Vladimir Horowitz as his first student, and at eighteen, he became the youngest artist signed to a contract by RCA Victor Records. On October 29, 1948, Janis made his Carnegie Hall debut, and Olin Downes in the New York Times wrote, “Not for a long time had this writer heard such a talent allied with the musicianship, the feeling, the intelligence and artistic balance shown by the twenty-year-old pianist, Byron Janis. . . . Whatever he touched he made significant and fascinating by the most legitimate and expressive means.”\n\nOn March 4, 1954, Janis made his debut with the Chicago Symphony in Orchestra Hall. “Mr. Janis played a performance of the Tchaikovsky concerto uncommonly beautiful for what it was, and uncommonly exciting for what it can be. . . . If you have it, you have it, and Mr. Janis does,” wrote Claudia Cassidy in the Chicago Tribune. “He has temperament and fire and he wants, perhaps more than anything in the world, to play the piano. You can always tell that by the sound. It comes out in the explosions of the double octaves, in the instinctive sensing of the crest of a phrase . . . his Tchaikovsky was big, beautiful and dynamic, yet with all its tensions it sensed the relaxed sweep of the grand style. . . . Reiner and the Orchestra gave superb collaboration, part Russian song, part Russian bear.”\n\nFor more than twenty years, Byron Janis was a regular visitor, as soloist with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and as a recitalist in Orchestra Hall.

among several others.\n\nThis article also appears here.\n\nThe Chicago Symphony Orchestra family joins the music world in grieving the loss of legendary American pianist André Watts, who died on July 12, 2023. He was seventy-seven.\n\nWatts was born on June 20, 1946, in Nuremberg, Germany, to a Hungarian mother and an African American U.S. Army soldier. His mother was his first piano teacher, and by the age of nine, he had won a competition to perform on a children’s concert with the Philadelphia Orchestra. Watts became a part of the American musical fabric when, at the age of sixteen, he appeared on a nationally televised Young People’s Concert with the New York Philharmonic on January 15, 1963, performing Liszt’s First Piano Concerto under the baton of Leonard Bernstein. Two weeks later, an ailing Glenn Gould canceled with the Philharmonic, and Bernstein invited Watts to perform the same Liszt concerto on subscription concerts on short notice. Columbia Masterworks soon recorded Watts’s interpretation, and the release The Exciting Debut of André Watts won the 1963 Grammy Award for Most Promising New Classical Recording Artist.\n\nWatts became a student of Leon Fleisher at the Peabody Conservatory, combining his studies with a packed concert schedule that quickly included as many as 150 concerts a year. He soon made his debut with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at the Ravinia Festival in June 1965, one day before his nineteenth birthday. Performing at the inauguration of U.S. President Richard Nixon in 1969, Watts had become a symbol for the civil rights movement, a quiet fighter “who lets his good example as a famous artist have the effect of a thousand protesters,” according to Norman Darden, writing in the Saturday Review in July 1969. In 1976, Watts gave a recital televised on PBS’s Live from Lincoln Center series, making him the first pianist to have a full-length recital broadcast on television in the United States.\n\nWatts was the youngest person ever to receive an honorary doctorate from Yale University, and he received the Avery Fisher Prize in 1988 and the National Medal of Arts in 2011. He was inducted into the Hollywood Bowl of Fame in 2006, the American Classical Music Hall of Fame in 2014, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2017. Watts was appointed to the faculty of the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University in 2004, and in 2017 he was named a distinguished professor, the highest academic rank the university bestows upon its faculty.\n\nWatts was a frequent guest, appearing with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra on many occasions, as follows:\n\nJune 19, 1965, Ravinia Festival\n\nMACDOWELL Piano Concerto No. 2 in D

professional debut at the age of fifteen in 1943, performing Rachmaninov’s Second Piano Concerto with the NBC Symphony Orchestra, under the baton of Frank Black. The following year, he was chosen by Vladimir Horowitz as his first student, and at eighteen, he became the youngest artist signed to a contract by RCA Victor Records. On October 29, 1948, Janis made his Carnegie Hall debut, and Olin Downes in the New York Times wrote, “Not for a long time had this writer heard such a talent allied with the musicianship, the feeling, the intelligence and artistic balance shown by the twenty-year-old pianist, Byron Janis. . . . Whatever he touched he made significant and fascinating by the most legitimate and expressive means.”\n\nOn March 4, 1954, Janis made his debut with the Chicago Symphony in Orchestra Hall. “Mr. Janis played a performance of the Tchaikovsky concerto uncommonly beautiful for what it was, and uncommonly exciting for what it can be. . . . If you have it, you have it, and Mr. Janis does,” wrote Claudia Cassidy in the Chicago Tribune. “He has temperament and fire and he wants, perhaps more than anything in the world, to play the piano. You can always tell that by the sound. It comes out in the explosions of the double octaves, in the instinctive sensing of the crest of a phrase . . . his Tchaikovsky was big, beautiful and dynamic, yet with all its tensions it sensed the relaxed sweep of the grand style. . . . Reiner and the Orchestra gave superb collaboration, part Russian song, part Russian bear.”\n\nFor more than twenty years, Byron Janis was a regular visitor, as soloist with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and as a recitalist in Orchestra Hall.

of its iconic musicians, Milton Preves (1909–2000), in honor of the anniversary of his birth on June 18.\n\nBorn in Cleveland, Preves moved to Chicago as a teenager and attended Senn High School. He was a student of Leon Sametini at Chicago Musical College, Richard Czerwonky at the Bush Conservatory of Music, and Albert Noelte and Ramon Girvin at the Institute of Music and Allied Arts before attending the University of Chicago.\n\nPreves joined the Little Symphony of Chicago in 1930, regularly worked in radio orchestras, and was invited by Mischa Mischakoff (then CSO concertmaster) to join the Mischakoff String Quartet in 1932. Two years later, second music director Frederick Stock appointed Preves to the Chicago Symphony Orchestra’s viola section, promoting him to assistant principal in 1936 and principal in 1939. He would remain in that post for the next forty-seven years, serving under a total of seven music directors, including Désiré Defauw, Artur Rodzinski, Rafael Kubelík, Fritz Reiner, Jean Martinon, and Sir Georg Solti.\n\nPreves performed as a soloist with the Orchestra on dozens of occasions, including the world premieres of David Van Vactor’s Viola Concerto and Ernest Bloch’s Suite hébraïque for Viola and Orchestra, both dedicated to him. Under Reiner, he recorded Richard Strauss’s Don Quixote—along with cellist Antonio Janigro and concertmaster John Weicher—with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for RCA in 1959.\n\nA lifelong educator, Preves served on the faculties of Roosevelt, Northwestern, and DePaul universities, and he also always taught privately out of his home. An avid conductor, he held titled posts with the North Side Symphony Orchestra of Chicago, Oak Park–River Forest Symphony, Wheaton Summer Symphony, Gary Symphony, and the Gold Coast Chamber Orchestra. As a chamber musician, he performed with the Budapest, Fine Arts, Gordon, and Chicago Symphony string quartets, as well as the Chicago Symphony Chamber Players.\n\nAs reported in his obituary in the Chicago Tribune, “It was while directing the Oak Park–River Forest group that he gained an unusual measure of national attention. He briefly became an icon of the fledgling civil rights movement in 1963, when he resigned from the community orchestra because it would not allow a Black violinist he had invited to perform with the group.” (More information can be found here.)\n\nPreves died at the age of ninety on June 11, 2000, following a long illness. Shortly thereafter, his family began donating materials to the Rosenthal Archives, establishing his collection of correspondence, contracts, photographs, scrapbooks, programs, and recordings. Most recently, his children donated additional photographs, mostly portraits of music directors and guest conductors, all autographed and dedicated to Preves. A sample of that collection is below.\n\nIn October 1984, on the occasion of Milton Preves’s fiftieth anniversary with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, fellow viola Isadore Zverow (1909–1999) composed this poem to honor his colleague:\n\nIt’s no mean feat, without retreat\n\nTo hold the forte so long,\n\nTo stroke and pluck in cold and heat—\n\nAll to produce a song.\n\nToward music bent, with single intent,\n\nUnyielding dedication,\n\nYou of yourself so gladly lent\n\nYour valued perspiration.\n\nYou sat and played and marked and bowed\n\nAnd sometimes e’en reproached\n\nAnd sometimes we squirmed (just a bit)\n\nWe didn’t wanna be coached.\n\nAnd yet whene’er the chips were down\n\nThroughout these fifty anna,\n\nYour steadfast presence was a crown\n\nAiming at Nirvana.\n\nThis article also appears here.\n\nThe Chicago Symphony Orchestra family joins the music world in mourning the loss of the remarkable Romanian pianist Radu Lupu. He died in Lausanne, Switzerland, on April 17, 2022, following a long illness. He was seventy-six.\n\nA frequent performer with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra for nearly fifty years, Lupu appeared with the ensemble in Orchestra Hall, at the Ravinia Festival, in Carnegie Hall, and on tour to Bucharest, Romania and Berlin, Germany.\n\n“I was deeply affected when I heard about the passing of Radu Lupu, one of the greatest pianists of our time,” Riccardo Muti wrote from his home in Ravenna. “I had great respect for him as an artist, and we always looked forward to making music together. It was with Lupu that I led memorable performances of Beethoven’s five piano concertos with the Philharmonia Orchestra in London, and I will always treasure that experience. I am so grateful for his most recent visit with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 2017 for even more Beethoven. He was a wonderful and sensitive person and I considered him a dear friend.”\n\nLupu made his debut with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in October 1972, under the baton of Carlo Maria Giulini. “Six years ago, a young Romanian pianist named Radu Lupu won the quadrennial Van Cliburn International Competition and then returned quietly to his studies. Last night, twenty-seven now and bearded, he made a historic local debut in Beethoven’s Third Concerto,” wrote Roger Dettmer in the Chicago Tribune. “Reports of his achievement should include a mention of phenomenal technical command, a range of tonal color and dynamics evidently unlimited, and a control of nuances as well as the big moments that awed. . . . As no other pianist in memory, not even Rachmaninov, he became a spirit trumpet through whom we heard the composer speak.”\n\nA complete list of his performances is below:\n\nOctober 5 and 6, 1972, Orchestra Hall\n\nBEETHOVEN Piano Concerto No. 3 in C Minor, Op. 37\n\nCarlo Maria Giulini, conductor\n\nAugust 1, 1973, Ravinia Festival\n\nBEETHOVEN Piano Concerto No. 5 in E-flat Major, Op. 73 (Emperor)\n\nLawrence Foster, conductor\n\nAugust 3, 1973, Ravinia Festival\n\nBEETHOVEN Piano Concerto No. 1 in C Major, Op. 15\n\nLawrence Foster, conductor\n\nApril 18 and 19, 1974, Orchestra Hall\n\nMOZART Piano Concerto No. 23 in A Major, K. 488\n\nSir Georg Solti, conductor\n\nAugust 6, 1977, Ravinia Festival\n\nBRAHMS Piano Concerto No. 1 in D Minor, Op. 15\n\nEdo de Waart, conductor\n\nAugust 7, 1977, Ravinia Festival\n\nMOZART Piano Concerto No. 21 in C Major, K. 467\n\nFranz Allers, conductor\n\nJanuary 12, 13, and 14, 1978, Orchestra Hall\n\nBEETHOVEN Piano Concerto No. 2 in B-flat Major, Op. 19\n\nErich Leinsdorf, conductor\n\nMarch 26, 27, and 28, 1981, Orchestra Hall\n\nBEETHOVEN Fantasy in C Minor for Piano, Chorus, and Orchestra, Op. 80 (Choral Fantasy)\n\nChicago Symphony Chorus\n\nMargaret Hillis, director\n\nBEETHOVEN Piano Concerto No. 4 in G Major, Op. 58\n\nDaniel Barenboim, conductor\n\nMarch 8, 9, and 10, 1984, Orchestra Hall\n\nBEETHOVEN Piano Concerto No. 5 in E-flat Major, Op. 73 (Emperor)\n\nLeonard Slatkin, conductor\n\nJanuary 31, February 1, 2, and 5, 1991, Orchestra Hall\n\nMOZART Piano Concerto No. 24 in C Minor, K. 491\n\nNeeme Järvi, conductor\n\nFebruary 10, 11, 12, and 15, 1994, Orchestra Hall\n\nBEETHOVEN Piano Concerto No. 4 in G Major, Op. 58\n\nDaniel Barenboim, conductor\n\nJanuary 31, 1996, Orchestra Hall\n\nMOZART Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major, K. 448\n\nDaniel Barenboim, piano\n\nMOZART Concerto for Three Pianos in F Major, K. 242\n\nElena Bashkirova, piano\n\nDaniel Barenboim, conductor and piano\n\nMOZART Concerto for Two Pianos in E-flat Major, K. 365\n\nDaniel Barenboim, conductor and piano\n\nJanuary 30, 31, February 1, and 4, 1997, Orchestra Hall\n\nSCHUMANN Piano Concerto in A Minor, Op. 54\n\nDaniel Barenboim, conductor\n\nSeptember 19, 1998, Sala Mare a Palatului, Bucharest, Romania\n\nSCHUMANN Piano Concerto in A Minor, Op. 54\n\nDaniel Barenboim, conductor\n\nJanuary 12, 14, 15, and 16, 1999, Orchestra Hall\n\nMOZART Piano Concerto No. 23 in A Major, K. 488\n\nDaniel Barenboim, conductor\n\nFebruary 10, 11, 12, and 15, 2000, Orchestra Hall\n\nBEETHOVEN Piano Concerto No. 2 in B-flat Major, Op. 19\n\nDavid Zinman, conductor\n\nApril 22, 2000, Philharmonie, Berlin, Germany\n\nBRAHMS Piano Concerto No. 1 in D Minor, Op. 15\n\nDaniel Barenboim, conductor\n\nFebruary 21, 22, and 23, 2002, Orchestra Hall\n\nMOZART Piano Concerto No. 27 in B-flat Major, K. 595\n\nFranz Welser-Möst, conductor\n\nOctober 3, 2002, Carnegie Hall, New York\n\nBRAHMS Piano Concerto No. 1 in D Minor, Op. 15\n\nDaniel Barenboim, conductor\n\nFebruary 13, 14, and 16, 2003, Orchestra Hall\n\nBEETHOVEN Piano Concerto No. 5 in E-flat Major, Op. 73 (Emperor)\n\nDaniel Barenboim, conductor\n\nFebruary 16, 17, and 18, 2006, Orchestra Hall\n\nMOZART Piano Concerto No. 20 in D Minor, K. 466\n\nMOZART Concerto for Two Pianos in E-flat Major, K. 365\n\nDaniel Barenboim, conductor and piano\n\nFebruary 25, 26, 27, and March 2, 2010, Orchestra Hall\n\nBEETHOVEN Piano Concerto No. 3 in C Minor, Op. 37\n\nGianandrea Noseda, conductor\n\nJanuary 10, 11, 12, and 15, 2013, Orchestra Hall\n\nBEETHOVEN Piano Concerto No. 1 in C Major, Op. 15\n\nEdo de Waart, conductor\n\nApril 27, 28, and 29, 2017, Orchestra Hall\n\nBEETHOVEN Piano Concerto No. 5 in E-flat Major, Op. 73 (Emperor)\n\nRiccardo Muti, conductor\n\nFollowing the April 27, 2017, performance of Beethoven’s Emperor Concerto, Hedy Weiss in the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, “Lupu’s often quiet but brilliantly expressive articulation compels listening by means of understatement, and yet there is an undeniable grandeur about it. And in tandem with the orchestra, he brought a dreamy tranquility to the slow passages of this familiar work that was metabolism-altering. The pianist’s emotional connection and eye contact with both Muti and the CSO musicians was both visible and audible at every moment.”\n\nLupu also gave a number of recitals in Orchestra Hall, as follows:\n\nFebruary 10, 1988 (with Murray Perahia)\n\nJanuary 21, 1990\n\nFebruary 13, 1994 (with Daniel Barenboim)\n\nJanuary 31, 1996 (with Daniel Barenboim)\n\nFebruary 11, 1996 (with Daniel Barenboim)\n\nFebruary 9, 1997 (with Daniel Barenboim)\n\nJanuary 21, 1998\n\nNovember 24, 2000 (with Daniel Barenboim)\n\nJanuary 27, 2002\n\nJanuary 15, 2004 (with the Staatskapelle Berlin and Daniel Barenboim)\n\nFebruary 19, 2006 (with Daniel Barenboim)\n\nFebruary 10, 2008\n\nJanuary 31, 2010\n\nThis article also appears here.\n\nThe Chicago Symphony Orchestra family mourns the loss of Dale Clevenger, who served as principal horn from 1966 until 2013. He died yesterday, January 5, 2022, in Italy, at the age of eighty-one.\n\nDale Clevenger was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee on July 2, 1940. A legend in the world of french horn for his sound, technique, finesse, and fearless music making, he joined the CSO at the invitation of seventh music director Jean Martinon. Throughout his forty-seven-year tenure, he performed under subsequent music directors Sir Georg Solti, Daniel Barenboim, and Riccardo Muti, along with titled conductors Pierre Boulez, Bernard Haitink, Carlo Maria Giulini, and Claudio Abbado, among countless guest conductors.\n\n“The loss of Dale Clevenger, one of the best and most famous horn players of our time and one of the glories of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, leaves a very deep void in the music world,” Maestro Muti said in a statement. “Fortunately, we have many audiovisual recordings of him with the Chicago Symphony to show his extraordinary technique and nobility of musical phrasing. I am certain that all his colleagues, former and current, all horn students, and myself, as we were personal friends, will mourn this huge loss.”\n\nA versatile musician in many areas, including chamber music, jazz, commercial recordings, and as soloist, Clevenger frequently credited his mentors Arnold Jacobs (CSO principal tuba, 1944–88) and Adolph “Bud” Herseth (CSO principal trumpet, 1948–2001 and principal trumpet emeritus, 2001–04).\n\nClevenger was a featured soloist on several CSO recordings, including works by Martin, Schumann, Britten, and Mozart. He also played on the Grammy Award–winning recording The Antiphonal Music of Gabrieli with the brass ensembles of the Chicago, Philadelphia, and Cleveland orchestras. He recorded horn concertos by Joseph and Michael Haydn with the Franz Liszt Chamber Orchestra of Budapest, as well as Mozart’s horn concertos on two separate releases, each of which was nominated for Grammy awards. Clevenger also performed with Barenboim and colleagues from the CSO and the Berlin Philharmonic on the Grammy-winning CD of quintets for piano and winds by Mozart and Beethoven. With Barenboim and Itzhak Perlman, he recorded Brahms’s Horn Trio for Sony Classical. He performed on the Tribute to Ellington release with Barenboim and other members of the Orchestra, and his recording of Strauss’s First Horn Concerto with Barenboim and the CSO also won a Grammy Award. John Williams wrote a horn concerto for him, which he premiered with the CSO under the baton of the composer, in 2003.\n\nAlso a conductor, Clevenger served as music director of the Elmhurst Symphony Orchestra for fourteen years. His conducting career included guest appearances with the New Japan Philharmonic, Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, Civic Orchestra of Chicago, Roosevelt University Symphony Orchestra, Toronto Conservatory Orchestra, Northwestern University Summer Symphony, Western Australia Symphony Orchestra, Osaka Philharmonic, National Philharmonic of Slovakia in Bratislava, Sinfonia Crakovia and the Opole Philharmonic in Poland, and the Bartlesville (Oklahoma) Symphony Orchestra. In 2011, he conducted the Valladolid (Spain) Symphony Orchestra with Daniel Barenboim as soloist.\n\nTeaching was an integral part of Clevenger’s life, and horn players who studied and coached with him won positions in some of the world’s most prestigious ensembles. Over the years, he taught at Northwestern University, Roosevelt University, and the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University. Clevenger also gave recitals and master classes throughout the world: in Italy, Spain, Germany, Belgium, Austria, Switzerland, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Japan, China, Australia, Mexico, Canada, and Israel. In 1985, he received an honorary doctorate from Elmhurst College.\n\nBefore joining the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Clevenger was a member of Leopold Stokowski’s American Symphony Orchestra and the Symphony of the Air directed by Alfred Wallenstein; he also was principal horn of the Kansas City Philharmonic. He appeared as soloist with orchestras worldwide, including the Berlin Philharmonic. Clevenger participated in numerous music festivals, including the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival; Florida Music Festival in Sarasota; Marrowstone Music Festival in Bellingham, Washington; Affinis Music Festival in Japan; and the Jerusalem International Chamber Music Festival. Additionally, he worked with the European Community Youth Orchestra under Claudio Abbado and participated in countless International Horn Society workshops.\n\nIn February 2013, when he announced plans to retire, Clevenger wrote to his colleagues in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra: “You are truly some of the finest musicians on the planet. To have had the pleasure and privilege of making music and sharing the stage with you in thousands of concerts is a sweet memory I shall cherish. . . . I encourage you to do everything possible in your power to keep my Chicago Symphony Orchestra ‘the best of the best!’”\n\nIn Orchestra Hall on June 10, 2013, members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra — under the batons of Clevenger and Riccardo Muti — performed an appreciation concert for their longtime colleague. As part of the program, several musicians put together a tribute, and that video is below.\n\nClevenger married Nancy Sutherland in 1966; they divorced in 1987. Alice Render, also a horn player, became his wife later that year; she died in 2011. He married Giovanna Grassi in 2012, and she survives him, along with a son and a daughter, Michael and Ami, from his first marriage; two sons Mac and Jesse, from his second marriage; a sister, Alice Clevenger Cooper; and two granddaughters, Cameron and Leia. Details for services—to be held at Christ Church in Winnetka, Illinois in the late spring—are pending.\n\nNumerous tributes have been posted online, including the Chicago Sun-Times, Chicago on the Aisle, Chicago Classical Review, New York Times, and Gramophone, among others.\n\nThis article also appears here.\n\nOn August 26, 1971, the Chicago Symphony Orchestra—plus family members, administrative staff, trustees, governing members, and several members of the press—departed Chicago for Vienna, embarking on the ensemble’s first overseas tour to Europe.\n\nGeorg Solti, beginning his third season as eighth music director, and Carlo Maria Giulini, the first principal guest conductor, would join the Orchestra on the road for nearly six weeks for a tour that included twenty-five concerts in fifteen venues in nine countries: Austria, Belgium, England, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Scotland, and Sweden. The repertoire varied from symphonies by Beethoven, Brahms, Mahler, Haydn, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky; to piano concertos by Mozart and Prokofiev, featuring Vladimir Ashkenazy and Rafael Orozco; and orchestral works by Bartók, Berlioz, Carter, Ravel, and Stravinsky. No other international tour since has included more concerts or a wider variety of programming.\n\nThe detailed tour schedule is available here:\n\nThe first concert of the tour was given in Edinburgh’s Usher Hall on September 4, with Solti leading Mendelssohn’s Overture to A Midsummer Night’s Dream, Carter’s Variations for Orchestra, and Brahms’s First Symphony (a video of most of that performance is available from ICA Classics). The final concert was given on October 5 in London’s Royal Festival Hall, with the Orchestra performing Mozart’s Symphony no. 39, Ravel’s Rapsodie espagnole, and Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony under Giulini’s baton.\n\nConsistently welcomed and cheered by capacity audiences, the Orchestra received overwhelmingly favorable critical response. Upon their return to Chicago, the musicians were welcomed as heroes with a tickertape parade down State and LaSalle streets on October 14, 1971.\n\nBefore the Orchestra performed a single concert, there were four recording sessions for Mahler’s Eighth Symphony at the Sofiensaal in Vienna beginning on August 30. The cast included sopranos Heather Harper, Lucia Popp, and Arleen Augér; mezzo-soprano Yvonne Minton; contralto Helen Watts; tenor René Kollo; baritone John Shirley-Quirk; bass Martti Talvela; and three choruses: the Chorus of the Vienna State Opera, the Singverein Chorus, and the Vienna Boys Choir.\n\nLondon Records released the recording in October 1972. In Gramophone, Edward Greenfield wrote, “Now at last Mahler’s Symphony of a Thousand can be heard on record at something approaching its full, expansive stature. Here is a version from Solti which far more clearly than any previous one conveys the feeling of a great occasion. Just as a great performance, live in the concert hall, takes off and soars from the very start, so the impact of the great opening on ‘Veni, creator spiritus’ tingles here with electricity . . . [with] playing from the Chicago orchestra that shows up all rivals in precision of ensemble, Solti’s performance sets standards beyond anything we have known before. . . . This is as near a live performance as the dynamic Solti can make it. At times, the sheer physical impact makes one gasp for breath, and I found myself at the thunderous end of the first movement shouting out in joyous sympathy, so overwhelming is the build-up of tension. . . . No doubt one day the achievement of this first really great recording of Mahler’s Eighth will be surpassed, but in the meantime I can only urge all Mahlerians—and others too—to share the great experience which Solti and his collaborators offer.”\n\nThe recording would win three 1972 Grammy awards for Album of the Year–Classical, Best Choral Performance–Classical (other than opera), and Best Engineered Recording–Classical.\n\nThis article also appears here.

He originally planned to become a teacher but gravitated to performance as a career while in the armed forces. During World War II, Herseth served as a bandsman at the pre-flight school in Iowa and at the U.S. Navy School of Music. He ended his military service with the Commander of the Philippine Sea Frontier in the South Pacific.\n\nIn early 1948 while studying for his master’s degree from the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, Herseth was appointed by Music Director Artur Rodzinski to the post of principal trumpet of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He never performed with Rodzinski (whose music directorship ended in April 1948) but would go on to serve under five CSO music directors: Rafael Kubelík, Fritz Reiner, Jean Martinon, Sir Georg Solti, and Daniel Barenboim. Herseth made countless solo appearances and recorded extensively with the Orchestra, including seven recordings of Ravel’s orchestration of Mussorgsky’s Pictures at an Exhibition (under Kubelík, Reiner, Seiji Ozawa, Carlo Maria Giulini, Solti (twice), and Neeme Järvi).\n\nConstantly devoted to the development of the next generation of symphony orchestra musicians, Herseth regularly gave seminars, coaching sessions and master classes in Chicago and throughout Europe and worked with the European Community Youth Orchestra, the West-Eastern Divan Workshop for Young Musicians and the Civic Orchestra of Chicago.\n\nHerseth held honorary doctor of music degrees from DePaul University, Luther College, the New England Conservatory of Music, Rosary College, and Valparaiso University. He received the Living Art of Music Symphonic Musician Award in 1994, was named Instrumentalist of the Year by Musical America in 1995 and was an honorary member of the Royal Danish Guild of Trumpeters. In June 2001, Herseth received the American Symphony Orchestra League’s Gold Baton Award, marking the first time in the League’s history that the award was bestowed on an orchestral player, and he also was awarded an honorary membership from London’s Royal Academy of Music at its commencement exercises. He was accorded a singular honor in 1988, when the principal trumpet chair of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which he continued to occupy until 2001, was named after him.\n\nOn June 7, 1998, Herseth’s friends—including Doc Severinsen, Daniel Barenboim, Arnold Jacobs, Frank Crisafulli, Arturo Sandoval, and numerous brass players from around the world—appeared in a tribute performance at Orchestra Hall to celebrate his fiftieth anniversary with the CSO. On January 27, 2000, the CSOA’s Women’s Association recognized Herseth for his “one season plus five decades” as the CSO’s principal trumpet.\n\nAfter the Ravinia Festival season in the summer of 2001, Herseth relinquished the principal trumpet chair and became principal trumpet emeritus. On February 21, 2004, he retired from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra after fifty-six years and received the Theodore Thomas Medallion for Distinguished Service. Following retirement, Herseth was a longtime member of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra Alumni Association.\n\nHerseth was interviewed by John von Rhein in the Chicago Tribune in April 2001, shortly after the announcement that he would cede the principal trumpet chair. He said, “for years I’ve been telling people I am lucky to get here, fortunate to still be here and to have had all these marvelous experiences.” And when asked how he would like posterity to remember him, Herseth replied, “as a fairly decent guy who gave it his best every time he had the chance.”\n\nAdolph Herseth died at home in Oak Park, Illinois, on April 13, 2013, at the age of ninety-one. He was surrounded by his family, including Avis, his beloved wife of nearly seventy years.\n\nThis article also appears here."
