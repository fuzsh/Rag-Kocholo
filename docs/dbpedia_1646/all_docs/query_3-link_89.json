MAHLER: Wer hat dies liedlein erdacht / Lula Mysz-Gmeiner, mezzo-soprano; Waldemar Lischowsky, Julius Dahlke, pianists / available for free streaming at Internet Archive\n\nThe austere-looking woman pictured above may not be on your musical radar; she wasn’t on mine until two days ago, when my friend Joe Pearce mentioned her in passing and I looked her up on YouTube. In fact, unless you are German or Austrian, you may never even have heard of her, let alone heard her. I certainly hadn’t.\n\nBut there are reasons why I hadn’t heard her. Although she is listed in the Kutsch-Riemens A Concise Biographical Dictionary of Singers (Chilton, 1969), a book I’ve owned since 1970, their assessment of her is not nearly as enthusiastic as it was for her contemporaries Elena Gerhardt, Julia Culp or Lotte Lehmann. All Kutsch and Riemens have to say of her is that she was one of the most famous concert singers of her epoch, not that she was a great lied interpreter. Thus I had no real motivation to look her up. After all, she wasn’t mentioned even once on George Jellinek’s famous WQXR radio program devoted to historic singers, The Vocal Scene, nor was she featured on any of those many Everest-Scala cheapie LPs on which historic singers were reissued—the ones with the candy-cane-colored generic covers, which sold for $2 at Sam Goody’s ($1 when they were on sale). And because she recorded exclusively for Polydor, and didn’t make all that many records (roughly two dozen, both acoustic and electric, during the 1920s), there weren’t any other LP reissues by her except for one on Discophilia M3, a weird pirate label I never saw, and one on Preiser’s “Lebendige Vergangenheit” series, and those were fairly pricy LPs back in the day. (As it turns out, she also wasn’t featured on either Vols. 1 or 2 of Michael Scott’s massive The Record of Singing boxed sets in the 1980s; she did appear on Vol. 3, but those sets cost an arm and a leg and I didn’t have the money to buy Vol. 3.) So she flew under my radar, as I’m sure she has flown under most of yours.\n\nBut she was truly one of the greatest lieder singers who ever recorded. The following biographical information is culled from K-R, Wikipedia (which is similar to K-R), and a few tidbits that Joe Pearce told me. Born in Kronstadt, then part of Transylvania, on August 16, 1876, Julie Sophie Gmeiner grew up in a highly musical family. Her sister Ellen and brother Rudolf also had successful career as concert singers, though they never recorded; another sister, Luise, was a pianist in Berlin. She first studied with Ludwig Lassel, then with Gustav Walter (1834-1910), one of the leading tenors of his day and the second-oldest singer known to have made commercial recordings (baritone Antonio Cotogni, born in 1831, made one issued recording in 1908). After 1896 she also studied with Emilie Herzog, Etelka Gerster and Lilli Lehmann. She made her concert debut in 1899 and garnered high praise for her singing, but in 1911-12 she underwent further vocal training with Raimund von zur Mühlen, another unrecorded singer.\n\nSomewhere along the line she changed her first name to Lula, and in 1900 married the Transylvanian engineer Ernst Mysz in Kronstadt. They had three daughters, two of whom died young. The third, Suzanne, later fell in love with tenor Peter Anders when he studied with Lula in the 1930s. Lula’s other notable pupils were sopranos Maria Müller and Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. Lula made extensive concert tours of both Europe and the United States, was highly prized by such knowledgeable colleagues as conductor Artur Nikisch and composer Max Reger, who was crazy about her voice and wrote several songs dedicated to her including his Vier Gesänge, Op. 88, published in 1905.\n\nFrom 1920 onward she was a voice teacher at the Staatlich akademische Hochschule für Musik zu Berlin, and it was during the 1920s that she made all her records for Polydor, both acoustically and electrically, with a few songs recorded in both formats, but there doesn’t seem to be a lot of them, perhaps 26 or 28 titles in all. A few (see labels) were somehow reissued by British Decca in the 1930s, but for the most part they remained on Polydor 78s. Although nothing is known of her two accompanists, Waldemar Liachowsky during the acoustic period and Julius Dahlke on the electricals, they were both clearly above the usual norm of pianists on old lieder recordings. Dahlke, in fact, was identified on the labels as playing a Bechstein grand piano, clearly a luxury for a lieder singer on discs in those days.\n\nListening to Mysz-Gmeiner takes you back to not only an era of lost vocal art, when singers were expected to not only have firm, well-produced voices, not the squally, tremulous horrors that often pass for professional singers nowadays, but ones who were expected to throw themselves emotionally into the words of the songs, acting them out both dramatically and poetically. Mysz-Gmeiner often makes her effects through her complete absorption in the words she is singing, and this alternates between a dramatic reading, as one might expect from a great actor like Chaliapin, and a poetic reading of the text. Moreover, Mysz-Gmeiner often makes her points by means of coloring her tones, and in this respect she was truly a master painter. She could even change the color of a tone while holding a single note, something that is impossible for nearly any modern-day singer, no matter how vocally gifted, to bring off, and all of this comes from a woman who was near or over age 50 at the time of recording.\n\nThe other thing you will notice is something that is completely verboten today, and that is the use of rubato and rallentando effects in her songs. Very often this is subtle, but occasionally the effects are a bit broad. Most musicians nowadays will probably cringe at this, but there was a point in time when, if you did not introduce some rubato into classical music, you were considered an unfinished artist. Yes, there are some similar effects in Gerhardt’s recordings, but those moments are generally subtler than Mysz-Gmeiner’s. A good example is Schubert’s Der Einsame; no lieder singer on earth would even think of introducing such broad decelerando into this song as she does, but she gets away with it because it enhances the words and the mood. In short, she may have had her mannerisms, but she knew what she was doing. She is never, ever vulgar or cheap in her effects; nothing she does is to show off the voice. And oh, yes, she also occasionally used a somewhat broad portamento—listen to Schubert’s Frühlingsglaube, for instance—and this, too was a musical tradition going back to the late 18th century. But our musical academics, in their rush to force Straight Tone down everyone’s throat, have thrown out portamento and rallentando in performance practice, ignoring the fact that this is quite probably what Schubert’s, Schumann’s and Brahms’ songs sounded like during those composers’ lifetimes.\n\nOf course I agree that these traits in her musical style could occasionally be excessive, but as I said, for the most part she is extremely tasteful. And what an interpreter she was! Her recording of Erlkönig is far and away the greatest I’ve ever heard in my life. She accurately portrays the father, son and Erl-king with exactly the right vocal tone and accents; you are never once in doubt as to which character is singing, and the terror she infuses into the young boy’s lines is almost horrific. You get so caught up that, at first listen, you may not even catch some of the slow-downs she tosses in here and there.\n\nMy impression of Mysz-Gmeiner’s voice is that it was of a good size but not really huge: more like Brigitte Fassbaender than Lilli Lehmann. Of course, this is good enough for a lieder singer, particularly one with such extraordinary skills as hers. Small wonder than listeners, even professional musicians, were bowled over by her singing.\n\nMysz-Gmeiner poured the same kind of emotion into Der Zwerg, one of Schubert’s strangest and darkest songs, yet she could also sing lightly and with great joy in Die Forelle, though she imparted more of a connection to the words in this song as well as in Mendelssohn’s generally flighty Auf flügeln des gesanges and even Mozart’s Das Veilchen, a song usually just tossed away by most lieder singers. As one might expect, Carl Loewe’s crazy dramatic ballad Herr Oluf is right up her alley with its almost over-the-top histrionics.\n\nOne of her more interesting performances is that of Tchaikovsky’s At the Ball. She doesn’t entirely reflect the mood that Pushkin intended, that of someone who is so numbed with grief that she can’t even show emotion; on the contrary, Mysz-Gmeiner’s grief comes out of her as if she is even beyond tears, it is so deeply felt. Thus I would place this in the category of an interesting outlier among recordings of this song.\n\nMy guess is that, in non-German countries, she was already forgotten by the time she died in August 1948, one week shy of her 72nd birthday. But an art as sincere, dramatic, and occasionally poetically subtle as hers should never be neglected or forgotten.\n\n—© 2021 Lynn René Bayley\n\nFollow me on Twitter (@Artmusiclounge) or Facebook (as Monique Musique)\n\nReturn to homepage OR\n\nRead The Penguin’s Girlfriend’s Guide to Classical Music\n\nHINDEMITH: Mathis der Maler / Kurt Streit, tenor (Albrecht von Brandenburg); Wolfgang Koch, baritone (Mathis); Martin Snell, bass (Lorenz von Pommersfelden); Charles Reid, baritone (Wolfgang Capito); Franz Grundheber, bass (Riedinger); Raymond Very, tenor (Hans Schwalb); Ben Connor, baritone (Prefect of Walburg); Oliver Ringelhahn, tenor (Sylvester von Schaumberg); Manuela Uhl, soprano (Ursula); Katerina Tretyakova, soprano (Regina); Magdalena Anna Hoffmann, mezzo (Countess Helfenstein); Andrew Owens, bass (The Count’s Piper); Vienna Symphony Orch.; Bertrand de Billy, cond / Naxos DVD 2.110691-92; Capriccio CD C5450 (live: Vienna, December 11-12, 2012)\n\nThis 2012 performance of Hindemith’s Mathis der Maler is being simultaneously released by Naxos as a DVD and by Capriccio as a conventional CD. I listened to the audio-only version first, in part because I had access to it about a week before the DVD arrived.\n\nSo far as I can tell, this is only the fourth recording of this opera despite the fact that it is considered one of the few true masterpieces of the 20th century, which goes to show you how reactionary and resistant to non-Italianate works most operagoers are. The other three were the 1977 EMI recording with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, James King, Ursula Koszut, William Cochran and Peter Meven, conducted by Rafael Kubelik; a 1990 Wergo recording with Roland Hermann, Josef Protschka, Victor von Halem, Sabine Hass, Heinz Kruse and Ulrich Helscher, conducted by Gerd Albrecht; and a 2005 Oehms Classics recording with Falk Struckmann, Scott MacAllister, Susan Anthony and Par Lindskog, conducted by Simone Young. The EMI recording, which I own, is considered to have the best singing and conducting. The Oehms Classics recording is considered to have the overall poorest singing, which I think is fair.\n\nThe biggest drawback to this opera is that the entire plot is based on religion, specifically the early war of the Lutheran Protestants vs. the Catholic Church, with Mathis the painter caught in the middle of all the action. Mathis is also torn between creating secular and religious art. For those of us who do not believe in all this organized Christianity nonsense, which is in fact all based and built upon so-called pagan religions, much of the opera is thus somewhat meaningless. But the music survives, and if we buy into the concept that not only Mathis but all of the other people in this opera really believe down to their feet in either Roman Catholicism or Lutheran Protestantism, it is indeed a dramatic tale.\n\nI made an A-B comparison between the first 20 minutes of these two recordings in order to get a feel for the differences in both singing and conducting. My impressions are as follows:\n\nDe Billy’s conducting is not only a bit slower than Kubelik’s but also more lyrical. He does emphasize the rhythm when the music demands it, but becomes slack on in-between passages when it does not. For those who like lyrical approaches to modern opera, however, this will suffice. Both of our Mathises, Wolfgang Koch and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, have a somewhat loose vibrato. (This was a period when Fischer-Dieskau was having a vocal crisis; I heard him “live” at Carnegie Hall in 1976 and his voice sounded uncharacteristically dull in timbre and not always steady.) Raymond Very, the Hans Schwalb on this new set, has an ugly voice, a full-blown wobble, and just shouts his role. I’m not sure he’s really a professional singer, although the other two tenors are almost (but not quite) as bad. Soprano Manuela Uhl, as Ursula, has a somewhat edgy voice but it is steady and she can sing; Koszut’s voice, though not golden age, has a more pleasant timbre. Both casts act out their parts dramatically, although Fischer-Dieskau has more of a lieder singer’s detail in interpreting the text. So from a strictly aural standpoint, I prefer the EMI recording.\n\nAs the opera moves along, however, de Billy becomes rather more animated and begins accenting the rhythms more strongly. Regarding the vocal line, Hindemith took great pains not to write in his most harmonically advanced style; although the orchestral accompaniment is full of unusual harmonies, the vocal lines, taken by themselves, are tonal and consonant. They don’t sound so much like sung recitative as simply like sung transitional passages one would hear in a Strauss or Wagner opera. The difference is that he never “breaks out” into arias, and without arias as guideposts, 90% of opera audiences are absolutely lost. They don’t know when to applaud (how about you just don’t until the end of the act?) or what to applaud for (how about the music drama and not for the tunes and high notes?). But Mathis builds up to some terrific climaxes; it’s just that most of them are choral, not for solo voice. The biggest problem with this performance is that the three tenors get a lot of singing, and every one of them is awful.\n\nAs for the video, the production is interesting if somewhat over-symbolic and fussy. During the playing of the orchestral prelude, we see Mathis standing with his arms outstretched as if he were Christ on the cross, then reading from some holy book or another before staring up into heaven. I’m not entirely sure why modern stage directors feel the need to continually have action when none is asked for by the composer, but apparently this is their thing. Some kind of giant object (the hand of God?) appears in the upper left-hand corner in the sky above Mathis. A woman appears before him, looking up at him alluringly (we later learn that this is the Countess Hellfenstein), but he does not get involved romantically. Another goofy-looking object that resembles a giant hip bone suddenly appears stage right up in the sky. At the end of the Prelude, Mathis again extend his arms in the air, crucifixion-style. Symbolism, folks, symbolism! “What does it all mean, Mr. Natural??!?” “It don’t mean shee-it!”\n\nYet the set does resemble an artist’s loft, there is nothing bizarre about the costumes or perverse in any way. For this, I was very grateful, although Mathis’ loft studio has, for some unexplained reason, a whole human skeleton standing under one of the stairways. Perhaps the former tenant. Sadly, none of the tenors’ voices sound any better while watching than they do when just listening to the opera. But by golly, they act up a storm. Manuela Uhl does a boatload of superfluous arm-waving during her arietta and duet with Mathis. I wouldn’t have minded it so much except that none of it looked natural; all of her movements were “stagey” in a way that signaled to me that she learned to mechanically replicate every little motion and facial expression the director told her to do. At least most of Wolfgang Koch’s motions looked natural, though he did some eye-bugging that annoyed me. Tenor Raymond Very has, as noted above, an extraordinarily ugly and defective voice, but he’s an excellent stage actor. Every motion he did looked natural and motive by the situation and the character. Tenor #2, Oliver Ringelhahn as Sylvester von Waldburg, is just a shade less squally-sounding than Very but isn’t as good of an actor. And of COURSE the chorus has to keep moving while they’re singing, walking around and around each other in circles. Can’t you directors learn that choruses are supposed to remain static when singing? No one in real life moves around this much while singing, and if they do move around this much they’re usually not singing at the same time. Or even talking. And no one I know, whether in a mob or not, is going to wave their arms and mill around when welcoming the Cardinal. Interestingly, some guy from the chorus who sings out “Make way for the Archbishop!” has a better voice than all the others, particularly that of Archbishop Albrecht von Brandenburg who sounds like a junk man screaming that he has some nice used pots and pans to sell. Magdalena Anna-Hofmann as the Countess also has a very squally voice.\n\nI tolerated this performance for about 40 minutes but just had to pull the plug on it. Most of the singing was so bad that it was giving me a migraine. My luck, right? I finally find an opera production that’s pretty traditional in terms of sets and costumes, and most of the singing is so execrable that it took then nine years to decided to release it on CD and DVD.\n\nSo that is my assessment, and if you can prove to me that I have been unfair in my assessment of the singing (mostly the tenors) or incorrect in my description of the acting, I will gladly eat this review. But I don’t think you can prove this to me.\n\n—© 2021 Lynn René Bayley\n\nFollow me on Twitter (@Artmusiclounge) or Facebook (as Monique Musique)\n\nReturn to homepage OR\n\nRead The Penguin’s Girlfriend’s Guide to Classical Music\n\nGORDON: Pointillism.1-5 Havens.2-3,5 Stranger Than Fiction.* 2-3,6 Dance.2-3 Sunyasin.4,5 Counterpoint.2,3,6 Bella.* 1,3 Modality.1,4 Steps.1,4 Walking Dream 4 / Jon Gordon, a-sax; Derrick Gardner, tpt; Alan Ferber, tb; 1Reginald Lewis, 2Tristan Martinuson, t-sax; 3John Ellis, 4Anna Blackmore, bs-cl; 5Jocelyn Gould, gtr/voc; 6Larry Roy, gtr; Will Bonness, *Orrin Evans, pno; Julian Bradford, bs; Fabio Ragnelli, dm / Artist Share, self-produced CD available HERE\n\nIt seems as if every jazz player in the world today considers him or herself a “composer,” when in fact most of what they write are tunes, and often uninteresting ones at that—it’s the solos that liven up the pieces they play. But alto saxist Jon Gordon can honestly and truly call himself a composer because what he writes are complex pieces that have structure and are also harmonically challenging to his fellow musicians.\n\nThe opener on this set, Pointillism, is a perfect example, starting off as a few sporadic notes that seem unrelated but then moves on to a sax solo by Gordon, during the course of which we hear dark, Monk-like figures played by two tenor saxes and two bass clarinets in unison. Thus we have here music akin to that which Charles Mingus wrote, only with a modern bent. In Havens, Gordon coalesces the beat more fully than in Pointillism, opens with one them and then moves to another which contrasts as well as complements the first. Eventually we get a swinging 6/8 beat, but this comes and goes as the music—all of it at this point written and not improvised—continues to develop. But fear not, jazz lovers; there’s plenty to hear in this piece, improvised or not. It holds your attention in part due to the constantly shifting meter and in part due to the eventual regularity of the irregular-sounding melodic line which runs like a thread throughout the entire composition. I believe that Will Bonness’ piano solo is the only improvisation on this track; it starts out almost as a fill to the ongoing melodic line before the saxes drop out and let Bonness move into more daring territory—but still staying within one basic chord except for the ends of phrases. At about the 6:35 mark, I think that trumpeter Derrick Gardner is also improvising, but not truly a solo…he plays over the ongoing development of the saxes. Truly a strange composition!\n\nMoreover, this strangeness continues throughout the album, and I must give Gordon props for not repeating himself from track to track. Not only is every piece in this set interesting, all of it sounds different from the tracks preceding and following each one. He thus has more than one “voice” as a composer, although intricate rhythms and a strong use of counterpoint infuse each one. Gordon’s solo in the midst of Stranger Than Fiction somehow comes as a surprise, simply because at this point in the piece one has come to expect further written-out development, but here he chose to just play an improvisation, which is in turn followed by an excellent guitar solo by Larry Roy and an even better one by pianist Orrin Evans.\n\nAs one continues to listen to the entire set, the more one becomes engrossed in Gordon’s compositional style, almost as if this were a concert of formal music. And that is as it should be because, as I mentioned early on, he is a real composer and not just someone who bats out a few tunes to jam on. Now, mind you, he’s not quite as varied in his approach as Mingus was; most of his melodic lines, though very creative, tend to stay within a fairly narrow note-range, and Dance sounds suspiciously like a faster variant of Haven, but the invention is always there, and I particularly like his ear for instrumental color. Gordon apparently likes his instruments to play from the middle of their ranges on down–not for him the blasting trumpet sound of some groups—and he has a keen ear for mixing his instruments to create unusual timbral blends. So he at least has an individual approach to both composition and orchestration. One might be tempted to say that he uses his 9- or 10-piece (depending on the track) band as a small orchestra, but it goes beyond that. Gordon thinks like a chamber music composer who is trying to balance a specific group of woodwinds, or strings and brass, or whatever, thus he constantly alternates between blending, polyphony, and moving the different voices in his ensemble around either together or in opposing figures. In Sunyasin he even blends in a wordless soprano voice (Jocelyn Gould) in a way that reminded me of the Sauter-Finegan Orchestra, only with far less brass. And this impression continued into the little fugue he threw in, which eventually unravels as the underlying tenors and bass clarinets move away from the alto sax and trumpet. So much of this is subtle that the casual listener will undoubtedly miss a lot of this, but repeated listening will reward you with the ingenuity of Gordon’s writing. And, as in the preceding tracks, when the guitar solo comes it almost seems like a surprise—a release from the intricate web of music he has sucked you into.\n\nAnd the surprises, always subtle, keep on coming, like the opening rhythm of Bella which seems to be running backwards, and the sudden surprise of hearing a bass solo (the first one on the record). On Modality, Gordon harks back to several of the jazz experiments of the late 1950s and early ‘60s, yet his use of harmony is more fluid and has more movement than in many a “modal” piece from that earlier time (e.g., Miles Davis’ So What?). When the alto solo comes in, around the 1:48 mark, the rhythm suddenly changes into a sort of a funky Latin groove. Then, in Walking Dream, one hears the multiple layers of the improvised piano playing against the alto sax, both of which are played against by the bass and drums in different rhythms. Fascinating!\n\nMy best advice to you is, Get this album and listen, listen, listen! I promise you, the listening will reward your patience. There are several layers to this music, and all of them are fascinating.\n\n—© 2021 Lynn René Bayley\n\nFollow me on Twitter (@artmusiclounge) or Facebook (as Monique Musique)\n\nReturn to homepage OR\n\nRead my book, From Baroque to Bop and Beyond: An extended and detailed guide to the intersection of classical music and jazz\n\nSCHUMANN: Myrthen: Der Nuβbaum / Fritz Schrödter, ten; anon pno; Charles Panzéra, bar; Magdeleine Panzéra-Baillot, pno; Victoria de los Angeles, sop; Gerald Moore, pno / Dichterliebe: Ich grolle nicht / Félia Litvinne, sop; anon pno / Dichterliebe: Ich hab’ im Traum geweinet / Nicolai Figner, ten; anon pno / Frauenliebe und Leben: Er, der Herrlichste von allen / Marie Knüpfer-Egli, sop; anon pno / Liederkreis: Dein Bildnis wunderselig / Lilli Lehmann, sop; anon pno / Wanderlied: Wohlauf! noch getrunken den funkelnden Wein / Willi Birrenkoven, ten; anon pno / Die beiden Grenadiere / Vittorio Arimondi, bs; anon pno; Feodor Chaliapin, bs; anon orch.; Sir George Henschel, bar/pno; Herbert Janssen, bar; Michael Raucheisen, pno / Volksliedchen: Wenn ich früh in der Garten geh.

It is part of Profil/Hännsler Classic’s series dedicated to historic lieder recordings, and the first devoted to Schumann.\n\nAs one can see from the above list, we have singers great and not-great, famous and obscure, legendary interpretations—some, like the 1928 Lotte Lehmann Frauenliebe und Leben, in an earlier, far less common version—and some who just sing the notes. Interestingly, the net has been cast far and wide, including such singers one would never suspect of having recorded Schumann such as Nicolai Figner, Giuseppe Borgatti and Erik Schmedes, as well as such obscure names as Fritz Schrödter, Marie Knüpfer-Egli, Willi Birrenkoven, Ursula van Diemen, Louis van Tulder, Alice Raveau, Thom Denijs and Flora Nielsen. Thus it’s quite the grab-bag!\n\nI like the suggestion in the liner notes that this is Profil’s answer to the massive EMI LP sets of the 1980s, titled The Record of Singing, only devoted exclusively to lieder, but was less thrilled about the fact that they didn’t include even rudimentary information on who the singers were. Between Joe Pearce of the Vocal Record Collectors’ Society and some information which I was able to find online, including photos of the artists, I was able to identify the singers I didn’t know.\n\nTwo things strike you regarding many of the acoustic recordings, particularly the early ones from 1901-1909. First, nearly all of the artists are singing too loudly, which somewhat spoils the effect of the texts of these songs, probably in order to compensate for the fact that the early recording horn wasn’t very sensitive to singers with nuance (as tenors Karl Jörn and Karl Burrian learned to their embarrassment). And second, almost none of the accompanying pianists were any good. I don’t mean just somewhat straightforward and insensitive: most of them could barely play their instruments. Apparently in the old days, the accompanist didn’t matter to ANYONE at the record companies as long as the Famous Singers could be heard, so the singers belted and the pianists klunked along.\n\nWe start our excursion with tenor Fritz Schrödter (1855-1924), an interesting case. He was primarily a singer of operetta and light tenor roles, the heaviest (for the most part) being Assad in Goldmark’s Queen of Sheba and the title role of Offenbach’s Contes d’Hoffmann, yet he also belted out Canio, Turiddu and Enzo Grimaldi in La Gioconda. He must have been very close to the horn for his recording of Der Nuβbaum because he almost sounds as if he’s shouting the song. But he had a good voice. a fine legato, and didn’t distort the music.\n\nNext up is Félia Litvinne, the famous Russian soprano who migrated to France and was associated with dramatic roles, particularly Wagnerian. Just to think of a Wagnerian soprano singing Schumann lieder sounds horrible, but although Litvinne’s voice really had a bright “cut” to it, she also had a good legato and actually sings the song with some feeling. Even better, however, is the famous early Russian tenor Nicolai Figner. Nearly all of his opera recordings sound not so good, but in “Ich hab’ im Traum gewinet” from Dichterliebe (in Russian) you can really tell that he was an artist—and for once, his pianist is at least competent.\n\nMarie Knüpfer-Egli (1872-1924) was an Austrian soprano. According to Pearce, she “made a good number of recordings for G&T and Gramophone, from 1902 up to about 1920. She recorded with Margarethe Knupfer, a mezzo who must have been her sister-in-law, as she (Marie) was married to the very famous bass Paul Knupfer, who died around 1920 and was a prolific recorder.” Her excerpt from Frauenkliebe und Leben is cleanly sung but has zero feeling in it. Lilli Lehmann needs no introduction to vocal collectors; she was one of the legendary sopranos of her time, and her version of the “Intermezzo” from Liederkreis is very finely sung.\n\nWilli Birrenkoven (1865-1955) was a dramatic tenor with an excellent voice. He debuted in 1888 at the Opera House of Dusseldorf. From 1890 to 1893 he appeared at Köln, from 1893 to 1912 at the Municipal Theatre of Hamburg. Here he sang among other things in the premieres of Busoni’s Die Bratwald (1902) and Siegfried Wagner’s Sternengebot (1908). He became known in particular as an famous interpreter of Richard Wagner’s operas, even at Bayreuth. His rendition of Wanderlied is strongly and robustly sung, yet with some soft singing in the middle section to show that he could modulate the voice. Vittorio Arimondi was a famous Italian bass of the period, and revels in the famous Beiden Grenadiere.\n\nMezzo-soprano Therese Behr-Schnabel is, of course, more famous for having been Artur Schnabel’s wife than for her career which she gave up shortly after her marriage except for a few lieder recitals with hubby accompanying. I had only heard her electrical recordings, of which two are featured here, on which she sounds as if the voice was shot—and indeed it was, because her 1904 recording of Volksliedchen, with an indifferent pianist, is really outstanding both vocally and interpretively. In the later recordings, it’s only interpretation you listen for, and yes, she still had it. Otherwise, the voice has turned sour in tone and the low range is unsteady.\n\nTo say I was surprised to see Giuseppe Borgatti singing Schumann would be an understatement; he was clearly one of the premier dramatic Italian tenors of his time, and lieder certainly didn’t seem to be his thing, yet he turns in a surprisingly fine rendition of Due bist wie eine Blume, and the 1905 Fonotipia sound quality is quite good for its time. Of Slezak there is little to say that hasn’t already been said of him; next to Caruso, he was clearly the greatest tenor of his time, and he does not disappoint here, though he uses more rubato than is fashionable nowadays.\n\nLydia Lipkowska was a famed Russian soprano who didn’t sing at the Met but did sing at the Boston and Chicago Opera companies as well as New York’s San Carlo Opera. I never thought a lot of her voice—it wasn’t bad, but it didn’t grab me, either—and here she is OK without being really impressive either vocally or interpretively. Next up is Erik Schmedes, a dramatic tenor almost as highly prized in Vienna (but not quite) as Slezak, but who always sounded just loud and dreadful on records. He does so here. He should have been dragged out in back of the recording studio and horsewhipped for giving a performance of “Ich grolle nicht” from Dichterliebe as awful as this. Ditto his pianist.\n\nJulia Culp was a mezzo-soprano whose lieder performances were absolutely drooled over by critics in her day. She didn’t possess the most beautiful of voices, and she uses far too much portamento for our tastes today, but you can tell that she was a really fine artist, although in “Er, der Herrlichste von allen” she takes a lot of unnecessary breaths. Piano Otto Bake, actually one of the few identified by name on these early records, wasn’t great by any means but he sounds like Geoffrey Parsons compared to most of the others. Chaliapin was Chaliapin: a bit over the top, but always involved with the feelings of the character he was singing. Frieda Hempel, who had for me one of the most beautiful voices of all German soubrettes, does a typically excellent job with Widmung, and she had a very fine pianist in Coenraad v. Bos.\n\nThe great German-Jewish baritone Friedrich Schorr sounds absolutely fantastic in Wanderied, his rich, beautiful voice ringing out with ease. But Schorr is even more sensitive in Du bist wie eine blumen, a formerly unpublished recording. Robert Jäger is the fine pianist in both.\n\nUrsula van Diemen (1897-1988) had a Dutch father and a German mother, and acted in movies in addition to singing. She had a high, bright voice, sang expressively, and was lucky to have a fine accompanist in Arpad Sandor, who later worked with Jascha Heifetz. I could have lived without the duet, sung in English by Lucrezia Bori and John McCormack (quite bad English in Bori’s case). Two very pretty voices, but only McCormack really sings as if he understands the words. Much better is the duet between famed Dutch soprano Jo Vincent and the little-known (outside of Holland) tenor Louis van Tulder. Born in 1892, van Tulder first worked in an office but left the security of a fixed job to become a singer. From 1916 on, van Tulder was first lyric tenor at the Netherlands Opera, singing in Faust, Martha, and La Boheme. After 1930, he was exclusively a concert- and oratorio-singer.\n\nFew truly great singers of the pre-World War I era were so highly prized, yet so quickly forgotten after his death, as Sir George Henschel, who also happened to be an excellent conductor (his recording of Beethoven’s First Symphony was part of Columbia Records’ 1927 centennial tribute to the composer). He had a fine, pointed voice, never used much portamento, sang with an almost 3-D reading of the texts, and also accompanied himself at the piano (no mean feat, even today). Interestingly, I had never heard his Beiden Grenadieren before, and although it is not as theatrical as Chaliapin’s it is just as deeply felt.\n\nAlice Raveau (1884-1945) made her debut in 1908 at the Opéra-Comique in Paris in Gluck’s Orphée, and this part remained her real star role. In 1911 she appeared as Orpheus at the Arena d’Orange and in 1910 she sang at the Opéra-Comique in the premieres of the Samuel-Rousseau’s opera Léone. She was a very intense singer who felt the music from the inside, although on this recording, at least, the voice sounds a bit nasal. Richard Tauber is Richard Tauber.\n\nThom Denijs (1877-1935) was a Dutch baritone, who made two complete recordings of Dichterliebe, one for the acoustic horn in 1923 and the second for the microphone in 1928. It is from the latter we hear two excerpts here. Although he devoted a large part of his career to lieder and oratorio, he did have an opera career earlier on, singing such roles as Papageno in Die Zauberflöte. Elena Gerhardt was, of course, the German mezzo noted for her lieder interpretations; when she made her electrical recordings for HMV, critics practically had an orgasm praising them. But like Theresa Behr-Schnabel, there was some tonal deterioration; her acoustic recordings with Artur Nikisch at the piano are superb whereas in these you’re really just listening for the artistry. These four recordings by her had never been issued previously. French baritone Charles Panzerá had both fine artistry and an excellent voice, though I had never heard him sing Schumann before. In der Fremde is a little slow, but his Der Nuβbaum is sheer perfection.\n\nLotte Lehmann was a singer I enjoyed thoroughly on her early electrical recordings, but never much liked after 1935. Happily, we have here two early examples of her from 1932, and she sings with a much fresher, more attractive tone than in her later outings, though to my ears she always took too many breaths. Herbert Janssen was a fine artist who, to my ears, really didn’t have the best German baritone voice. But by the electrical era, record producers finally started ensuring that the accompanists were at least pretty good and, at time, superb, thus from this point on we have few problems with the accompanists.\n\nElisabeth Schumann remains a controversial artist. Many listeners complain about her rubato effects, which sounded quite out-of-date by the 1930s, while others, like me, are mesmerized by the purity of her voice and her ability to color her tones. With that being said, she was too close to the microphone for Mondnacht, which rather ruins the effect she was clearly trying to make. If she had stepped back two paces, I think it would have come out fine.\n\nTenor Karl Erb (1877-1958) was another of those singers who, like George Henschel, were lionized during their lifetimes only to be marginalized and then forgotten in later years. In his case, however, it was because the voice itself, though pleasant, wasn’t much to listen to; it was his artistry you went back to, over and over again, and he does not disappoint here in the four songs chosen for inclusion. Indeed, I would put him on the same high pedestal as Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, and that’s going some. A true interpretive and musical genius.\n\nRia Ginster, a German concert soprano who specialized in lieder, was sort of the female Karl Erb, except that her voice had a somewhat abrasive and metallic sound whereas Erb’s voice was quite pleasant, just small. But she too was a first-rate interpreter, as these songs show. (In fact, these specific pressings are the best I’ve ever heard of Ginster; not even her EMI LP or CD reissues ever sounded this good.) Willi Domgraf-Fassbaender’s one contribution to this set is beautifully sung and interpreted with passion, but perhaps a bit too much so—he sounds as if he’s delivering an Italian opera aria rather than a Schumann lied.\n\nI knew the name of Susan Metcalfe-Casals, the American mezzo who married Pau (Pablo) Casals, but had never heard her before. It was a somewhat small, dry voice, not unpleasant or defective in any way but not really a first-rate instrument. She was, however, a good interpreter, and perhaps we should cut her some slack since she was 59 years old when she made these discs, the only ones she ever made. Interestingly, these were not fully commercial recordings, but were made for HMV’s yellow label, for private distribution only.\n\nCD 3 starts with a very famous recording, Aksel Schiøtz’ 1946 Dichterliebe with Gerald Moore, one of his very last recordings as a tenor. He suffered a stroke shortly thereafter, had to stop singing for nearly three years, and could only come back as a baritone. The Dichterliebe is a very good one, but it’s been available on Danacord for more than a decade. The three songs recorded in 1949 as a baritone are also quite good, and in fact on these the voice sounds very tenor-ish; it would be a few years before he completely lost the brightness on top. By 1949, he merely lost his highest notes, B and C, but still had the tenor timbre.\n\nFrida Leider was, of course, one of the two greatest Wagnerian sopranos of her time, the other being Florence Austral. Both were eclipsed in 1935 by the arrival of Kirsten Flagstad on the international scene, but by 1939 Leider’s voice was on the decline and she soon gave up the Wagnerian roles. These 1943 lieder recordings are among her very last; the voice is bit more fluttery than in the past, but she was still a fine artist if rather too loud an interpreter for this delicate music. (Her accompanist, Michael Raichausen, is also too slow.) Baritone Hans Hermann Nissen was also a Wagnerian who sang Hans Sachs in Toscanini’s famous 1937 performance of Die Meistersinger. He, too, is a fairly straightforward, exuberant singer, but at least he chose a song that fit that style of interpretation.\n\nFlora Nielsen (1900-1976), another little-known singer nowadays, was a Canadian soprano whose real name was Sybil Crawley. She started out her career as a soprano, and was still one when she made these recordings, but later switches to mezzo-soprano. The voice sounds very “British,” if you know what I mean: tight, laser-like tonal focus, very little vibrato, almost an edgy quality, but still a decent quality timbre. She also sounds like a mezzo, even here. As an interpreter she’s so-so. These are more curiosities than anything else. And of course everyone who listens to Wagner knows who Hans Hotter was. Apparently he suffered throughout his life from asthma, and this is what caused the frequent wobble in his voice, but when at his best he was incomparable as an interpreter. Curiously, he chose to record Mondnacht, but surprisingly he pulls it off, in part because the voice is steady as a rock here, even if you never in a million years would think of Mondnacht as a song for a bass-baritone.\n\nKarl Schmitt-Walter (1900-1985) is the next little-known singer. Joe Pearce claims that he was one of the most popular baritones in Germany, even better liked in the 1930s than Willi Domgraf-Fassbaender, that he made films and recorded a lot of crossover material on 78s and LPs well into the 1960s, but truth to tell, I’ve never heard or heard of him before. It was a nice, light voice, and he was clearly a fine interpreter; both of his songs here are very well sung. He rode the voice on the breath with perfect ease, and though the voice obviously lacked size it was of a fine quality. Mezzo Elisabeth Höngen is another famous name, but I doubt if many have heard her from as far back as 1946, when this recording of Schlief die Mutter endlich ein was made. The voice was much lighter and brighter than in the 1950s and ‘60s, and she sings with wonderful energy and engagement. Her accompanist, Hans Zipper, is also quite zippy!\n\nWe next hear four very famous singers. French baritone Pierre Bernac also qualifies as a Karl Erb-type singer: a pleasant if not really beautiful voice, but outstanding interpretation. One will search far and wide to hear lighter, more engaging singing from Elisabeth Schwarzkopf in 1951, and of course Fischer-Dieskau was a great singer regardless of era. Victoria de los Angeles was never much of an interpreter of anything, except perhaps Madama Butterfly, but she had a gorgeous voice.\n\nThe last CD, titled “Legendary Lied Cycle Recordings,” starts with Gerhard Hüsch’s 1936 recording of Dichterliebe which I felt only has his outstanding vocal quality to recommend it. As for me, I not only prefer Schiøtz’ version to his but also the 1935 recording by Charles Panzéra and Alfred Cortot…but it’s typical of Germans to assume that only a German baritone could deliver a “great” performance. A Dane and a Frenchman doing a better job on German lied than a German? Impossible! But so it was although, on re-listening to it, there are some interesting interpretive touches here that somehow escaped me the first time I heard it. So maybe it’s not really legendary, but it is pretty good overall, though “Aus alten Marchen” is taken too slowly and has some extra decelerandos in it to boot.\n\nHappily, Profil chose to include Lotte Lehmann’s earlier 1928 recording of Frauenliebe und Leben rather than her later recording. Although this has an orchestral arrangement, it is somewhat tasteful for its time despite the drippy string portamento (probably arranged by the conductor, Frieder Weissmann), and in 1928 Lehmann still had the youthful bloom on her voice that was gone by the mid-1930s. Indeed, the only fault in her singing here—which only became worse with age—is that she took too many breaths in the middle of phrases, even those that were fairly easy to sing. Nonetheless, this is clearly a great performance in every respect, truly worthy of preservation. Listen particularly to “Du ring an meinem Finger,” where she not only interprets the words like the great actress she was but also binds the phrases together perfectly. Seven years on, she couldn’t sing half this well.\n\nWe end with Friedrich Schorr’s 1937-38 recording of Liederkreis with Fritz Kitzinger at the piano. The famous baritone’s voice was not in as good estate here as it was in the late 1920s-early ‘30s, but although there is some obvious wear on the voice (he gave up singing by 1940 and turned to teaching) the tonal deterioration was not as pronounced as Lehmann’s by this time. As mentioned earlier, Schorr was alternately pretty good and great in his interpretations, and he is so here. Not every song is interpreted fabulously, but most are quite good and some are truly great. More interestingly, in some songs (a good example is “Die Stille”), one can actually “hear” the face behind the voice, and he lightens his voice even more than Hotter did for “Mondnacht.”\n\nThus we come to the end of our Schumann survey, and I would be remiss if I didn’t give the absolute highest praise to restoration engineer Holger Siedler for this set. Although he often left in a bit more of the original surface noise than I like, each and every track on this set is engineered perfectly—so much so that, even in the early acoustic recordings, you can actually hear some of the natural studio resonance, which is almost miraculous. I would place his restoration of these discs even higher than not only my own but also of Ward Marston and Seth Winner, both of whom have done some very high-quality remastering of older records. I’m sure that he didn’t have mint copies of every record in this set to work from, but it sounds like it, and for that I’d give him a “What a Performance!” award just for the remastering.\n\n—© 2021 Lynn René Bayley\n\nFollow me on Twitter (@Artmusiclounge) or Facebook (as Monique Musique)\n\nReturn to homepage OR\n\nRead The Penguin’s Girlfriend’s Guide to Classical Music\n\nFEATHER: Esquire Blues.

Announcers: Leonard Feather, Michael Roy (Spotlight Bands Broadcast) / available for free streaming on YouTube (live: Metropolitan Opera House, New York, January 18, 1944)\n\nFor one night and only one night in the long history of the Metropolitan Opera House, Tuesday, January 18, 1944, there was a major program change. Instead of Mozart, Verdi, Wagner, Puccini or Strauss, the composers featured were Duke Ellington, Harold Arlen, Hoagy Carmichael, the Gershwin brothers, Spencer Williams, Fats Waller and Lionel Hampton. The sopranos were Billie Holiday and Mildred Bailey, the baritones Louis Armstrong and Jack Teagarden, the bass was Oscar Pettiford, and the only tenor featured was the tenor sax of Coleman Hawkins. This was a jazz concert, a major War Bonds drive, and Eddie Johnson and the Met board had no choice but to capitulate in order to show their patriotism.\n\nThe concert has since become the stuff of legend; it was issued several times on LP and CD beginning in 1971, shortly before Louis Armstrong’s death, although in recent years the number of re-releases has dropped off. Despite the fact that Benny Goodman’s name and image were featured prominently on the poster advertising the concert, he wasn’t even in New York at the time. He and his band were playing out in California, and he just phoned in a performance of Rachel’s Dream sometime during the evening, but this remote contribution has not been included in any of the releases I’ve seen. Barney Bigard, who at the time was a star with Duke Ellington’s orchestra, plays all the clarinet solos.\n\nAs you can see from the lineup listed above, this was clearly an all-star band, all of the musicians present either winners or runners-up in every instrumental category. Nowadays, few people pay much attention to Esquire Magazine, and when they do it’s probably to protest the attitude of Maleness propagated in its pages, but in the 1940s it was one of the few major mags in America besides Metronome and down beat to devote a good number of pages per month to jazz and to hold annual popularity contests for fans from 1944 t0 1946. It’s rather sad that neither of the two best jazz guitarists of the day, Oscar Moore or Django Reinhardt, were present, but Moore was still little-known, only recently coming to prominence as a member of the ascendant Nat Cole Trio, and Reinhardt was hiding out at the time in France. Or Algiers. Or Switzerland.\n\nAs you can hear on this remarkable recording, the young audience—and those are clearly young voices yelling and cheering, teenagers and others either too young for or exempt from being drafted—go absolutely nuts over the music. Granted, many of them probably had little real knowledge or appreciation of what these musicians were really doing, but although I won’t pretend that every solo in this two-hour concert was an absolute gem (Jack Teagarden, for one, overblows several notes, and a few of the musicians just played rhythmic riffs during their solo spots) there is clearly enough here to excite the jazz genes of anyone who still has blood in their bodies. For these young people, who didn’t even have to buy tickets—all they had to do to get in was to buy a War Bond or three—this concert was the equivalent of their Woodstock, only without having to sleep in mud and get sick. And you know what? It’s actually refreshing to hear an audience go absolutely bonkers for the likes of Roy Eldridge, Art Tatum, Coleman Hawkins, Bigard, Casey and drummer Sid Catlett, who in my personal opinion never sounded more vibrant and inventive as he does here, rather than screaming for some craphead rock band playing inane licks over a deafening but uninteresting drum beat.\n\nThis was, in a sense, Swing’s Last Stand. In only two years, the musical landscape was to change drastically in favor of progressive swing (faster and less danceable than the beats heard here), bebop (faster and even more complex) and early R&B, the three divisions into which jazz was headed. By the end of the 1940s, you were in one of those three camps or a “Moldy Fig” who only listened to New Orleans or Chicago Dixieland. The jazz world was about to rip asunder, and to this day no jazz historian other than me has ever pointed to this multiple fork in the road as the real reason for the demise of the big bands and the loss of interest in jazz. For better or worse, swing had something in it that appealed to almost everyone. The later forms of jazz did not. They appealed to large sects within the jazz-listening community but clearly not to everyone or there wouldn’t have been that division.\n\nConsidering what would happen to Billie Holiday about a decade hence—drug busts and a fall from grace—it’s almost sad to hear her introduced as the “All-American singer.” But was she ever in great voice for this concert! So too was Mildred Bailey, who by 1947 had dropped out of sight, fighting ill health and depression, eventually becoming one of the forgotten superstars of jazz singing.\n\nTo be honest, I have no idea how much of this program was worked out in advance. Probably the order of appearances: note that they held off bringing Armstrong in until the fifth number, giving him special status, and of course Teagarden was also held back until that time as well. There was probably also an ordering of the numbers played or sung—that only makes sense. But in several cases, the length of the performances tended to run as long as they ran, and if one or two of them went overtime, someone else’s number probably got cut. As in the case of Benny Goodman’s January 1938 Carnegie Hall concert, they programmed the longest jam session for next-to-last, a 12-minute version of Lionel Hampton’s Flying Home that absolutely tore up the floorboards. In fact, this performance was so popular with the audience that they even issued it on a V-Disc under the title Flyin’ on a V-Disc.\n\nThe second half hour of the show was broadcast live on the Spotlite radio program. Since this was a commercially-sponsored program, the all-stars had to play the then-theme song of the Coca-Cola company We All Drink Coca-Cola. Probably the best band that ever played it in the history of the company.\n\nInterestingly, within this two-hour swingfest we do hear a few indications of the split in jazz to come. Armstrong, of course, always had his heart in what he loved to call “one of the good old good ones,” and there are several of them here, from Muskrat Ramble to Basin Street Blues. Ike Quebec’s and Kenny Clarke’s Mop Mop was very close to the emerging bop beat, and bassist Oscar Pettiford, also at that time a star with Duke Ellington, suggests elements of bop in his solo on For Bass Faces Only.\n\nOne of the really interesting things about this concert—to me, anyway—is that fact that although Teddy Wilson was present, he did not play on many numbers here. That honor went to Art Tatum, a man often castigated by the musically insensitive for not being able to swing, but swing he does throughout this concert, even when playing behind Holiday or Armstrong, which he was never to do again for the remainder of his career. Had Goodman been in New York instead of California, we might have had the rare opportunity of hearing Tatum accompany him as well.\n\nBut what stands out about this concert that one didn’t always hear in the later Norman Granz-organized Jazz at the Philharmonic jam sessions is the easy communion and unity among the musicians. Everyone is trying to play their best, but as a group there is a cohesion that rarely came out of thrown-together jam sessions like this, even when one hears the contrast between the Armstrong-inspired vibes of Hampton and the Bix Beiderbecke-inspired xylophone and vibes of Red Norvo. It’s not so much competition as simply playing their best and having fun. Just listen, for instance, to the way Tatum comes roaring into view on piano right after Norvo’s excellent solo on I Got Rhythm. You can hear Norvo call out, “Come on, Art, Art!” to egg him on, and I don’t think it bothered Red in the least that Art blew him away. When Armstrong enters, he’s playing his best, but in his own style; he’s not trying to out-Tatum Tatum…although Coleman Hawkins, then on the cusp of his bop phase, plays a blistering solo halfway between bop and R&B, and a brilliant one it is, too.\n\nAnd listen to how Tatum plays a steady and un-frilly comp to Roy’s, Hawk’s and Bigard’s solos. He’s not trying to show off here, but be a good colleague. He even gets Jack Teagarden into a great mood on trombone. Big T never really embraced bop, but he did flirt with it. Only Roy Eldridge sounds as if he wanted to show Tatum that he had the kind of chops on trumpet that the latter had on piano, and by golly, he succeeds. (It just struck me that one other major jazz name who should have been at this concert, but apparently wasn’t voted in, was Lester Young.)\n\nSo there’s not a lot of harmonic sophistication in this concert. Don’t expect to hear anything that resembles what Charlie Parker, Thelonious Monk, Dizzy Gillespie or Bud Powell were doing behind the scenes…that was to dominate jazz’s future, not early 1944. And although I alluded to the fact that Al Casey wasn’t the greatest jazz guitarist of his time, he contributed a surprisingly modern-sounding chorus to the improvised blues that just precedes the Spotlite portion of the program. But alas, Casey later rose to fame as a rock guitarist, and you can hear this element of his playing in his own composition, Buck Jumpin’, which is pure R&B. Casey may have been a good guitarist, but he knew which was the path to riches and it wasn’t the way he played on the blues.\n\nTaken as a whole, however, this is clearly an excellent concert within the swing axis as of 1944. You get a little of everything and a lot of surprising moments when you suddenly realize that your favorite (or not-so-favorite) musician is giving out with a really great chorus or two, and that, after all, is the essence of jazz.\n\n—© 2021 Lynn René Bayley\n\nFollow me on Twitter (@artmusiclounge) or Facebook (as Monique Musique)\n\nReturn to homepage OR\n\nRead my book, From Baroque to Bop and Beyond: An extended and detailed guide to the intersection of classical music and jazz"
