Elena Gerhardt (born Nov. 11, 1883, Leipzigâ€”died Jan. 11, 1961, London) was a mezzo-soprano, one of the most accomplished singers of German lieder of her time.

Gerhardt studied at the Leipzig Conservatory and made her debut at Leipzig in 1903. Having early decided against an operatic career, she made an international reputation as an exponent of German song. Her interpretation of the songs of Hugo Wolf was considered unsurpassed in her day. In 1933 she settled in London, where she developed her career as a teacher. She gave her last recital at Liverpool in 1947.
