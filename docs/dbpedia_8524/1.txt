Allright, so my German is pretty basic, but I still enjoy flicking through the Blick am Abend on my 10 min train ride home in the evening. Not because it's great journalism, nicely set up, or because even I can spot grammatical errors, but because of this crazy section called "Singles des Tages".

To put it lightly, it's hilarious

One of the funniest things I've noticed is when the male candidate is asked the question "Which celebrity do you look up to?" (or "impresses you", something along those lines).

I swear it.... half of them or so answer " Vin Diesel "

Come on, that just can't be right! So many people can't agree on this

Is it a Swiss thing like the Nickelback/James Blunt radio obsession I read about somewhere on EF, or is it the journalist who's subtly trolling?

What do you think?
