        "text": "Classical Music Daily - February 2023 - Written by Esdras Mugatik\n\nGreetings Professor Rose,\n\nI have just heard your Rachmaninoff Sonata No 2 performance on YouTube and I want to tell you that it is astounding - just astounding. Many words of acclaim and praise are due to you for this superb interpretation.\n\nI have long admired your great musicianship and great virtuosity and they are found here in a performance of total command, deep insight and true musical wisdom. Just fantastic!\n\nIt is also obvious that your knowledge is based on vast experience, for you have performed for many decades, appeared around the world in concert and concerti, made a shelf full of recordings and taught countless students in lesson and masterclass. You studied with Adolph Baller, Leonard Shure and Rudolf Serkin and have collaborated with a luminous array of conductors and orchestras (such as Georg Solti, Sergiu Comissiona and Charles Mackerras). All of those experiences add up to create the command that your performance exhibits.\n\nAnd what of the performance here? What can I say? Well, I assure you it will be great praise.\n\nI am deeply impressed by your ability to clarify the complex textures of this powerful composition; not by omitting, or ignoring or underplaying the inner voices, but by such a judicious balancing of the voices and chords that while all is perfectly present and perfectly clear, there is no clutter or confusion, just the pure music.\n\nYour control of technique is total and I deeply appreciate that you do not attack the piano, but draw from it a beautiful, balanced and nuanced tone. For example: unlike some barnstorming pseudo-virtuosi, you insist that all sounds at the piano have a musical meaning. That is what the great pedagogue Tobias Matthay taught. Thus, say in a passage high in the piano’s register, you do not drive nails into the ears of your listeners, but create scintillating waves of sound.\n\nAnother striking feature of your performance (and this is found in all your performances) is the very subtle emphasis of phrasing that might almost be called elocution. Just a tiny hesitation, a tiny emphasis, a tiny rubato that alters the music from a mere mechanical rendition to an artistic creation. In this era when electronic (MIDI) and computer music dominate how we hear, your playing style is based on human nature, not mechanical method. These days we are being tricked by the Turing Test into believing that a machine-like performance is music. This is why you are sometimes called things like 'The Last of the Great Romantics' or such like. That may be (though I hope you are not the last of the tradition), but the reason is that your performances are alive.\n\nI thank you for this grand performance, for the grand music making and for the potent creativity you bring to this music. You are indeed and without question a great pianist. A very great pianist.\n\nInternational Piano - July/August 2021 - Written by Jerome Rose\n\nIt is quite ironic that this question plagues everyone that has practiced the piano, both amateur and professional alike, with very little that has actually been written to answer this question. Yes, there are biographers and reviewers galore that write about specific performances, recordings, and videos, but few that actually attempt to penetrate the essence of the question.\n\nIn fact, the question itself is somewhat impossible to answer; and no simple listing of the elements of a performance can capture what constitutes greatness. It starts in music with a phrase, a sentence, a paragraph, a movement, a piece, a performance, and inevitably morphs into a concert season and a lifetime. The aspiration that exists in any true artist is the desire to achieve the moment or moments of synthesis in performance that create a transcendental meaning or response; some moment of execution of “Mind, Body & Spirit” that the Romantics understood so well.\n\nIt all starts with talent, training, exposure, culture, history and experience. There is also the necessity within the individual at an early age to aspire to some greater height that gives meaning to their work. So much depends on parents and teachers to instill in the child these values. The basic character of the creative youth is truly what needs to be nurtured to carry this formidable development through to a positive end. Obviously, there can be a great cost to everyone involved in carrying these responsibilities through a lifetime where so many fail.\n\nEvery accomplished pianist knows the drudgery of exercise, self-criticism, trial and error, the inconsistencies of performance and audience response and the daily grind of maintaining a high professional standard. Every pianist in the world knows this. As well, every pianist in the world is constantly striving for “something more”.\n\nThe difficulty is knowing what that “something more” is. That is why I ask students, “what constitutes a great pianist”? Surprisingly few have thought about this or can reasonably answer the question in a meaningful way. But nevertheless, this question needs to be asked in order to define that which the student is striving to achieve. Truly, if there is any guide from all the great historical pianists, there has to be something in common with all of them.\n\nI would say, in the most simple terms, that what they all have in common is that eternal commitment to art and to the life of the artist. It is that dedication to the higher ideal and the higher purpose in their life that we are witness to in their work. The unwillingness to compromise and the complete willingness to dedicate their lives to their art. This dedication allows their inner life and intellectual life to continue to grow and flourish. It is a basic philosophy, within their reality, which includes countless hours of work and their almost religious commitment to their art.\n\nOne of my personal sayings that I truly feel in performance is that “the tones have to reverberate off the membrane of your soul”. The sense of message has to be there at all times. Also, that sense of purpose that engages an audience and brings them into the aural sensory world of the performer: that ability to communicate where the interpretation of the music is so profound that, even if one disagrees, you are swept up in the intensity of the performance supported by the collective energy of the audience. There is such conviction within the performance that you cannot be distracted or look away.\n\nSuch words as charisma, communication, sound, intensity all lead to a transcendental experience – a place in time that an audience member will never forget. I believe that this is “what constitutes a great pianist”.\n\nIt is not a matter of reputation, audience kudos or even publicity. It is what happens on stage that makes you remember that moment in the years to come. The pianist creating these transcendental moments can only be measured through the totality of a night, a season or a lifetime. Very few artists have been able to sustain a career on this level. Quite simply, we need to be and can only be grateful for the moment.\n\nIf the pianist succeeds in creating this lasting moment, he or she is truly, “ A Great Pianist”.\n\nNew York Classical Review - July 16 2018 - Written by David Wright\n\nJerome Rose opened the International Keyboard Institute and Festival Sunday night at Hunter College.\n\nIt was time to put away the plaster busts of Beethoven, Schumann and Liszt Sunday night at Hunter College’s Kaye Playhouse, as pianist Jerome Rose demonstrated what loose cannons those canonical composers really were.\n\nHow better to kick off the 20th annual International Keyboard Institute and Festival—two intense weeks of recitals, master classes and lectures about the piano—than with a program of piano pieces that dared all in their day, and still challenge the understanding of performer and listener alike?\n\nRose, the festival’s founder and director, sailed with abandon into the opening Vivace, ma non troppo of Beethoven’s Sonata No. 30 in E major, Op. 109. The forward momentum was indeed almost troppo, but in spite of that the pianist showed a keen sense of every flit and twist in this volatile music.\n\nIn contrast, the ensuing Prestissimo, a biting parody of the sonata’s tender opening theme, seems to call for a mercilessly strict tempo. On Sunday, the spurts and fluctuations of the Vivace seemed to bleed over into it, causing a somewhat blurry performance.\n\nThere were no such issues, however, with the great closing movement, which packs a world of expression into its noble theme and just six variations. In this performance, one wished the theme would sing out a bit more, but the variations were finely characterized, from the ornate soprano aria of No. 1 to the blossoming of ecstatic trills in No. 6.\n\nRose’s broad tonal palette in the variations, from brilliant to mellow to sturdy, served to remind listeners, as this piano festival got under way, how essential touch and tone are to playing the instrument at the highest level.\n\nFor volatility, even Beethoven’s Op. 109 takes a back seat to Schumann’s Humoreske in B-flat major, Op. 20. The composer, whose beloved piano cycles such as Papillions and Carnaval can seem like the purest expression of ADHD in music, outdid himself in this piece, seemingly flinging heterogeneous bits of music together in no discernable order. If Schumann hadn’t already used the title “Traumes Wirren” (Dream Confusions) for an earlier piece, it would have suited this one perfectly.\n\nRose’s response to Schumann’s interpretive challenge was similar to what he did in the Beethoven: press ahead. At the outset, the tempo really was troppo, and Schumann’s brief, bright ideas sped by as if seen from a bullet train. As the piece unfolded, however, the pianist found the right combination of momentum and characterization, and the mood swings—the mingled “humors”—of the Humoreske could be better appreciated.\n\nFrom the muffled drums of its opening to the exhaustion of passion at its close, Liszt’s “Funérailles” is such a compelling drama that one forgets that it, too, is composed of extremely heterogeneous materials: a wailing dirge, a sensuous love theme, a thrilling battle scene, all tumbling after each other in a tragic procession.\n\nOn Sunday, Rose needed no sped-up tempos to engage the listener, relying instead on sonorous crescendo in the funeral march, glowing tone in the erotic interludes, and an edge-of-the-seat rush of octaves as his hero galloped into the fray.\n\nSuch a masterpiece, so stirringly delivered, was bound to cast a shadow on its two more lyrical mates from the collection Harmonies poétiques et religieuses. At least “Bénédiction de Dieu dans la solitude,” which preceded “Funérailles” on this program, was made of first-rate materials, attractively set. Rose laid it out beautifully, his rubato growing out of the theme’s long expressive arc, the chords big and round, the filigree liquid.\n\n“Cantique d’amour” (Hymn of Love), the closing piece in both Liszt’s collection and Sunday’s program, was yet another Lisztian effort to bridge the sacred and the profane, in the prolix, frothy style to which this composer sometimes resorted when inspiration flagged. It at least brought Sunday’s recital in for a safe, soft landing.\n\nNot content to leave it there, Rose returned with a brilliant encore, Liszt’s Hungarian Rhapsody No. 1 in C-sharp minor, delivered with plenty of soul in the mournful recitative and fire in the frenzied conclusion.\n\nClassical Music Guide - July 15 2018 - Written by Donald Isler\n\nJerome Rose - IKIF\n\n20th International Keyboard Institute and Festival at Hunter College\n\nJuly 15th, 2018\n\nBeethoven: Sonata No. 30 in E Major, Op. 109\n\nSchumann: Humoreske in B-Flat Major, Op. 20\n\nHarmonies poétiques et religieuses\n\nBénédiction de Dieu dans la solitude\n\nFunérailles\n\nCantique d'amour\n\nYes, it's that time of summer, meaning the beginning of the latter half of July, when lovers of the piano and its repertoire flock to Hunter College for the International Keyboard Institute and Festival. It offers two weeks of recitals (often two a day) presented by exceptional pianists of all ages, plus classes, master classes, lectures, and a competition.\n\nThe founder of the Festival, now beginning its 20th season, is the pianist Jerome Rose, who, traditionally, gives the opening night recital. The winner of the 1961 Ferruccio Busoni International Piano Competition, and a student of Rudolf Serkin and Leonard Shure, Mr. Rose has had a long and impressive career as an artist and teacher, and is as busy as ever. Next month he will celebrate his 80th birthday. He is a very serious musician (which also came across in what he told me during an interview last year) and he always plays big, demanding programs.\n\nThe first movement of Beethoven's Op. 109 was beautifully played, alternately thoughtful and turbulent. The second movement was appropriately wild. In the third movement there was a good intensity in the first variation, a nice interplay of the hands in the second, a lovely rolling-along sensation in the fourth variation, and excellent voicing of the melody against the trills in the sixth.\n\nThe Humoreske of Schumann is quite an odd, though fascinating major work. Its many peculiarities include at least one brilliant \"false ending\" which produced applause from the audience at the wrong time! The first allegro section in B-Flat Major was performed in a lively manner, with beautiful phrasing. The D Minor section was dramatic, the quasi-fugato Intermezzo section was brilliant, and a later section, where the melody is played in octaves, was deeply felt.\n\nAmidst a lot of very fine playing in the Beethoven and Schumann there was some rushing and a few memory lapses. But by the second half of the program Mr. Rose was at the top of his game. Indeed, though this should not be a surprise, considering his reputation as a Liszt player, the all-Liszt second half of the program was marvelous!\n\nThe Bénédiction de Dieu dans la solitude was lush and lovely, though powerful. Mr. Rose handled the complicated arpeggiation and ornamentation with ease. In the Funérailles he produced a huge sound, and his octaves were those of a young virtuoso! In Cantique d'amour there is a melody with an accompaniment \"floating\" around it, and later an ardent melody punctuated by brilliant octaves. I couldn't imagine this played any better!\n\nMr. Rose played one encore, the Thirteenth Hungarian Rhapsody of Liszt. The \"quasi-gypsy mode\" was exactly right, and in the end he pulled out all the stops. Very exciting, indeed!\n\nThe Festival is off to a good start!\n\nAmerican Record Guide - November/December 2017 - Written by James Harrington\n\nWhere, in the heat of July in New York, could you hear Vladimir Feltsman take you on a ride with Baba-Yaga to the Great Gate of Kiev for only $20? Now in its 19th year, the International Keyboard Institute and Festival (IKIF) presented two weeks of masterclasses, lectures, and concerts by renowned pianists and students at Hunter College. Founded and directed by pianist Jerome Rose and Festival Director Julie Kedersha (Rose’s wife), the institute draws students from all over the world to study and compete. New York area audiences who appreciate world class pianists in recital come every night for the bargain price of $20 to the Sylvia and Danny Kaye Playhouse. During the day these same pianists give masterclasses that are open to the public and all the students, usually in Hunter’s Lang Concert Hall. A two-week pass that covers every event is only $200.\n\nIt is the dual nature of this event that sets it apart from other festivals or summer educational programs. The recitals are performed with all the skill expected across town at Carnegie, Alice Tully, Avery Fisher, and Merkin Halls. I have reviewed CDs in ARG by at least eight of this year’s pianists, and all concert performances were at an exceptionally high level. Nearly 100 students from all over the world came for the two weeks; each had several piano lessons a week with the distinguished faculty, and they got to attend all of the evening concerts. They have the option to compete for scholarships, with the winner invited back for a main stage recital next year.\n\nThe list of pianists who have performed and taught at IKIF over the past 19 years reads like a who’s who in the piano world: Wild, Entremont, Sandor, Janis, De Larrocha, Ts’ong, Hamelin, Goode, Pressler, Keene, Laredo, Oppens, Frank, Katsaris, Bavouzet, Howard, and of course, Rose himself. Other pianists who have records regularly reviewed in ARG are also IKIF performers: Kobrin, Kern, Swann, Suk, Wang, Li, Bax, Burleson, Demidenko, Kristenko, Gavryluk, Yakushev, and Baczewska. Some have been performing at the festival for 15 or more years, and there is a growing number of home-grown artists and teachers. In the case of Baczewska, now one of the brightest and best of IKIF’s performer-teachers, she began as a student 19 years ago and was a competition winner.\n\nAt pre-concert talks, program notes are discussed and performers are interviewed. Two or three of the performers gather at a small table stage right between 7 and 7:15 each evening for at least half an hour. One of the participants is the scheduled pianist for the following evening’s recital, which works as wonderful advertisement for both the artist and the program. There is a discussion of both the current and next evening’s programs, often with examples on the piano and the opportunity to ask questions.\n\nRose gave the opening concert on a Sunday evening, as he has done each of the past seasons. He is present for every event over the next two weeks. Indefatigable even at 79, his gregarious personality coupled with a still impressive big romantic piano style and over 50 years as a teacher make it easy to understand his success with IKIF. I was reminded of learning a lot of Liszt repertoire back in the 1970s from his Vox Box recordings, and then attending his all-Liszt recital back in 1986 on Liszt’s 175th birthday at Alice Tully Hall. This year he played Beethoven’s Sonata No. 18, Schumann’s Fantasy Pieces Op. 12, and Liszt’s Sonata—a demanding program for someone half his age. I remember Liszt’s Sonata as the high point of his recital 31 years ago, as it was again in July. There is so much in this piece that can distract the pianist’s overall conception, but Rose is a master with Liszt’s music, and I heard all the motivic transformations clearly. Yet the work moved right along, keeping my attention so well that all of a sudden we were at the fugue, then the presto octaves, and then the final heavenly pages. He offered no encore; only his heartfelt thanks to the audience for their attendance and his hope that they would return all through the festival.\n\nFor the next 13 days, the place to be in New York for all things piano was IKIF at Hunter College. The repertoire was quite varied but centered on Beethoven (eight sonatas, Diabelli Variations, and Bagatelles), Schubert, Chopin, Liszt, and Schumann. I also heard earlier music (Bach, Scarlatti, Rameau, Mozart, and Haydn), plenty of Russian (Moussorgsky, Balakirev, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninoff, Scriabin, Prokofieff), French (Debussy, Ravel, SaintSaens), and even a group of Chinese pieces. Of the nearly 200 works programmed in the main evening recitals, there were only five duplicates: Tchaikovsky’s ‘Dumka’, Liszt’s Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 (with different cadenzas), a couple of Rachmaninoff preludes, and Scriabin’s left-hand Nocturne.\n\nEach of the main recitals could justify a full review. That said, here are some of my most memorable moments looking back over the two weeks. Ilya Yakushev substituted Beethoven’s Tempest Sonata for the originally programmed Appassionata. Sonata No. 17 is not heard anywhere near as often as it should be, and the performance was clearly in the mold of the later work, full of great contrasts and unusual power and excitement. Nikita Mndoyants played Beethoven’s second set of Bagatelles and Schubert’s great Sonata, D. 958, on the first half of his recital. The second half was Prokofieff’s Sonata No. 8 in perhaps the most riveting performance of the entire festival. Though I was very sorry to have missed Magdalena Baczewska’s recital, I did get to hear her play gorgeous excerpts the night before (Debussy’s Images plus Chopin’s Scherzo 2 and some nocturnes).\n\nYoung Vladimir Rumyantsev gave the most technically demanding recital, which included both Balakirev’s Islamey and Ravel’s Gaspard de la Nuit—on the first half! At his Saturday afternoon recital the overflowing audience was seated in the aisles and standing along the back. The second half was a big group of great Rachmaninoff preludes followed by Liszt’s Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 with Rachmaninoff’s huge cadenza. The following evening, Feltsman’s masterly Pictures at an Exhibition was preceded by some of Brahms’s ballades and rhapsodies.\n\nLater in the second week, Jie Chen opened with a gorgeously played D 894 Sonata by Schubert and then dazzled the audience with Four Seasons of China and Schulz-Evler’s Beautiful Blue Danube. Dmitri Rachmanov performed Schubert and Schumann (Vienna Carnival), followed by a Russian second half: Blumenfeld, Liadov, Scriabin (including a great Sonata No. 6), and another big group of Rachmaninoff preludes.\n\nAlexander Kobrin closed the festival for the second year in a row. His recital (Beethoven’s Sonatas Nos. 27 and 28, Schumann Symphonic Etudes) brought us full circle from Rose’s opening program, which began with Beethoven and Schumann. Of all the pianists I heard, Kobrin was the most understated, but very much in control; and his soft playing, even in very fast, complex passages, was quite amazing. He included four of Schumann’s five posthumous etudes and brought the recital series to a rousing conclusion.\n\nIKIF’s website (www.ikif.org) is worth investigating. Based on prior years, I expect many of the performances from this year to be available online in the near future. From 2016 backwards, there are over 200 five- to ten minute performance excerpts from past festivals, with Earl Wild, Philippe Entremont, Gyorgy Sandor, Marc-André Hamelin, Leslie Howard, Jerome Rose, and Ursula Oppens.\n\nIKIF’s 20th anniversary is scheduled from July 15 to 29, 2018. It will be a time to celebrate how the event has grown from its first 16 years at Mannes School of Music to its recent years at Hunter. Pianists already scheduled include Vladimir Feltsman, Jean-Efflam Bavouzet, George Li, and Jerome Rose. There will be some recognition of the 100th anniversary of Debussy’s death and the 75th anniversary of Rachmaninoff’s. If you love great piano music and live in or near New York, or are looking for excuse to visit, put those dates on your calendar now. You won’t spend a lot of money, but you’ll be richly rewarded for as many evenings as you can attend. After this past summer, you will find me at these events for many, many years to come.\n\nNew York Classical Review - July 2017 - Written by Bruce Hodges\n\nJerome Rose opened the International Keyboard Institute and Festival Sunday night at the Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College\n\nAn evening with Jerome Rose at the piano is usually an evening well spent, especially if he has invited some of his best friends – in this case, three different landmarks for the instrument.\n\nTo kick off the 19th International Keyboard Institute and Festival Sunday night at the Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College, Rose began with Beethoven’s Sonata No. 18, Op. 31, No. 3, a relatively gentle opening to an evening that would end in a blaze.\n\nIn the first movement, Rose–founder of the festival–captured its sense of hesitation and quiet humor, even if the rhythms could have been cleaner. But he surged forward in the second movement Scherzo, with fleet playing and agility in what sounds like a devilish moto perpetuo. Adopting a riskily fast tempo, at times the pianist seemed to be barely hanging on, but the excitement watching that happen was undeniable. At the end, the audience almost broke into spontaneous applause.\n\nIf the Menuetto might have been the high point, it was because Rose infused it with clarity and simplicity. Using a no-nonsense approach, slightly formal but with room for tenderness, the pianist reached one of the evening’s expressive high points. In the Presto finale, Rose found the required “con fuoco” immediately. Rhythms were again dicey, but offset by the pianist’s accuracy in the composer’s relentless dotted rhythms.\n\nOne of the challenges in Schumann’s Fantasiestücke is how to characterize the eight sections, in which the composer’s dual nature comes to the fore. From the gentle charm of “Des Abends” (“In the Evening”) to the humor of “Fabel” (“Fable”), Rose made Schumann’s colors vivid and distinct. The high point came with “In der Nacht” (“In the Night”), masterfully plotted, with the pianist capturing the union of Florestan and Eusebius in rhapsodic splendor.\n\nSome inaccuracies in “Traumes Wirren” (“Dream’s Confusions”) were offset by Rose’s quiet wit, which flickered elsewhere throughout the evening. The sequences in “Grillen” (“Whims”) fit together like a jigsaw puzzle. In the tricky voicing of “Warum?” (“Why?”) and in the stormy left-hand rumblings of “Aufschwung” (“Soaring”), the pianist showed quiet concentration, unerringly letting the melodic line float to the surface. By the time he reached the “Emde von Lied” (“End of the Song”), melding heat and introspection, the scope of Rose’s conception became clear.\n\nBut for many in the audience, the pinnacle came after intermission, with Liszt’s complex Sonata in B minor. Rose’s pedigree in this repertoire is formidable: his 3-CD Liszt set was released in 2015 on Medici Classics, and was awarded the Grand Prix du Disque from the Franz Liszt Society in Budapest, Hungary.\n\nRose began with a moment of meditation, patiently waiting for the audience to relax into complete silence. The sober opening soon gave way to stormier sequences, and there was no denying the pianist’s heat and excitement. In the slow movement, nothing escaped the pianist’s gaze (and fingers), as he explored every corner of Liszt’s inspiration. And the pianist kept the ferocious fugue in line, with all voices audible. Rose kept his body language at a minimum, opting to pour energy into the composer’s unyielding torrents of notes.\n\nThe thundering penultimate section was gripping, full of adrenalin and a breathless prelude to the calm postscript that brings this vast landscape to a close. In Rose’s hands, the final sequence embodied a great mind coming to rest – actually two minds, composer and pianist. And after a short pause, the bravos, cheers and standing ovations began. No encore was offered, but none was needed.\n\nAfter acknowledging the applause, the visibly exhausted pianist offered a few words of thanks to those attending, with brief encouragement to support IKIF. Rose deserves immense credit for programming such a beefy opening concert, while simultaneously masterminding the entire festival – two-and-a-half weeks of outstanding pianists, coupled with master classes and lectures.\n\nPianoNews - June 2016 - Written by Carsten Dürer\n\nDie Liszt-Aufnahmen des amerikanischen Pianisten Jerome Rose galten in den 70er Jahren als so etwas wie eine Referenz-Einspielung. Rose hatte 1975 von der Liszt-Gesellschaft in Budapest den „Grand Prix du Disque“ für seine Liszt-Aufnahmen der „Consolations“ erhalten, die er damals für das Label Vox eingespielt hatte. So entschied Rose sich im Jahr 2015 dieser damals wichtigen Auszeichnung mit einer CD-Box mit zahlreichen Liszt-Aufnahmen aus unterschiedlichen Jahren zu gedenken. Interessant ist diese Neuausgabe der Auf nahmen vor allem, da die meisten dieser Liszt-Einspie lun gen bislang noch nie auf CD erschienen sind. Rose er weist sich gerade in den Paganini-Etüden und den Études de Concerts als junger Virtuose, geradezu als technisch auftrumpfender Heißsporn, der aber durchaus weiß, was er da\n\ntut. Das erkennt man in der geschickten Phrasierung und den Rubati, die er großartig einfließen lässt. Allein Geschwindigkeit ist nicht seine Sache, sondern das Ausgestalten der musikalischen Inhalte. Allerdings hat Rose auch seine ganz eigene Spiel- und Sichtweise, bedenkt man andere Aufnahmen aus den 70er Jahren des 20. Jahrhunderts.\n\nHinzu kommt ein doch recht scharfer Flügelklang in diesen frühesten Aufnahmen. Anders klingen da schon die beiden Balladen von Liszt sowie seine „3 Liebesträume“. Hier kann Rose wirklich zeigen, dass er ein romantischer Geist ist im Sinne von voranstürmend und etwas übergroß in den Aussagen.\n\nDoch in „Seliger Tod“, dem vielleicht in der Aussagekraft beeindruckendsten Stück dieser CD, erscheint dann tatsächlich die weiche und verträumte Seite des Interpreten, mit Grandezza und farbenreich. Auf der dritten CD spielt er dann alle vier Versionen des Mephisto-Walzers, allein dies ist schon eine Seltenheit.\n\nAber die besten Momente zeigt er wieder in den eigentlichen „Erzählstücken“, so wie in der „Bénédiction de Dieu“ sowie den Sankt-Franziskus-Legenden: Da ist der warme und weiche Klang einnehmend, die genaue Differenzierung in der Dynamik bestens gestaltet. Jerome Rose ist ein großartiger Pianist in diesen Liszt-Einspielungen und es ist gut, dass er in dem von ihm gegründeten Label daran erinnert, welch großartiger Liszt-Interpret er ist.\n\nFrom PIANONews 2-2016 www.pianonews.de\n\nEnglish translation:\n\nThe Liszt recordings of American pianist Jerome Rose were considered to be a type of reference recording in the 70’s. In 1975, Rose was awarded the \"Grand Prix du Disque\" by the Liszt-Society Budapest for his Liszt recordings of the \"Consolations\" that at that time he had played for the label \"Vox\". Rose decided in 2015 to celebrate the anniversary of this important award with a collection of CDs including numerous Liszt recordings of different years. This new edition is particularly interesting, because most of the Liszt recordings here have never been released on CD.\n\nEspecially in the Paganini Etudes and the Etudes de Concerts, Rose proves to be a young virtuoso, positively a technically strong hero, who thoroughly knows what he is doing. This is evident in the subtle phrasing and rubati that he incorporates greatly throughout. Not only speed is his goal, but the shaping of musical content.\n\nHowever, Rose has his own particular way of playing and perception, considering other recordings of the 70’s in the 20th century. In addition, the sound of the grand piano is quite harsh in these earliest recordings. Differently still, is the sound of the two Ballades by Liszt, as well as his \"3 Liebesträume\". At this point, Rose can really show that he is of a romantic spirit in the sense of storming ahead, and with perhaps extreme passion.\n\nYet in \"Seliger Tod\", the work of the CD that perhaps has the most impressive expressiveness, the soft and dreamy side of the interpretation finally appears with grandeur and richly colored. On the third CD he plays all four versions of the Mephisto Waltz, which already is quite a rarity. But he shows the best moments again in the actual narrative pieces, like in the \"Bénediction de Dieu\" as well as in the Legends of Saint Francis: here, the warm and soft sound is captured, the exact differentiation in the dynamics revealed best.\n\nJerome Rose is a magnificent pianist in these recordings of Liszt, and it is wonderful that he reminds us in his self-founded label what an extraordinary interpreter of Liszt he is.\n\nGramophone - January 2016 - Written by Jeremy Nicholas\n\nFinally another fine Lisztian but of a different vintage. The American virtuoso Jerome Rose recorded a series of Liszt recitals in the mid-1970's and 1986, one of them winning the Grand Prix du Disque (from the Liszt Society of Budapest). To celebrate the 40th anniversary of their first appearance, on three Medici Classics discs, and with the repertoire ordered like a helpful reference library, are six Paganini Etudes, five Concert Etudes, four Waltzes, two Ballades, two Polonaises, Berceuse, three Liebestraüme, four Mephisto Waltzes, 'Bénédiction de Dieu', two Légendes and six Consolations.\n\nRose takes no prisoners in what is largely a sequence of bravura works (there are remarkable performances of Mephisto Waltz No. 1 and St. François de Paule', for instance) but he also paces and phrases beautifully ('Benediction de Dieu'). It is particularly good to have the complete Liebestraüme and Consolations in sequence and in the best recorded versions I have heard. You may turn elsewhere for more variety of touch (Gary Graffman in the Paganini Etudes) and sheer electrifying execution in 'Waldesrauschen' and 'Gnomenreigen', but as a neatly packaged collection of original works you could hardly wish for a better introduction to Liszt's genius.\n\nPianiste - November/December 2015 - Written by Stéphane Friédérich\n\nMagnifique interprète (disciple de Rudolf Serkin, entre autres) et pédagogue non moins renommé (au Mannes College of Music, notamment), le pianiste américain reçut le Grand Prix du disque de la Société Franz Liszt en 1975.\n\nLe label a réuni les oeuvres primées, ainsi que des premières en CD.\n\nCe qui frappe d’abord, c’est la puissance et la légèreté des interprétations.

The quality of sound and picture on Blu-ray are outstanding and the lack of fussiness in the camera work shows Rose's economy of technique and lack of any unnecessary gestures. This would be a valuable lesson to any student of the piano and the challenges thrown up by live filmed performances are awesomely met by Rose, who always does what he wants with a control, even in breathtakingly exciting passages, without ever seeming to be careful.\n\nSo here the great romantic player transfers his technical and interpretative skills to a different idiom, but what is so gratifying and it could be said unusual, is the virtuoso finding the virtuoso in Beethoven. There is no doubt that Beethoven was a virtuoso, and Rose's performances of these sonatas are far from the sometimes inhibited versions where speeds and attack are more cautious. The speeds in the \"Pathetique\" and \"Moonlight\" sonatas are certainly on the fast side, but in the case of the \"Moonlight\" in the last movement marked presto agitato, the music comes to life with an electricity which I'm sure is just what Beethoven would have wanted. Anything less would fail to meet the brilliance of the writing.\n\nAs we move further into Beethoven's compositional life, there is more scope in the Waldstein sonata for virtuosity, and the fast speed that Rose adopts in the first movement is exactly right. There is also more contrast and the emergence of the other aspect of Rose's playing which is power. Speed and power are two of the most exciting things in musical performance, and in this sonata the speed is never in danger of pressing too hard and the clarity of semiquaver passages swirling in torrents, sometimes with filigree lightness, and sometimes with great strength, convey the extraordinary imagination of the composer. However, the second movement, Adagio molto, has another quality of profundity and majesty which are perfectly captured. The sequence of single notes at the outset with Rose is beautifully expressive, and the cantabile rich and deep. The Rondo - Allegretto moderate has just the right degree of lightness and poise which is contrasted with the fire and virtuosity of the triplet semiquavers and later octaves which follow the opening section. This octave passage which starts in the left hand with enormously fast triplets in the right, later being reversed, is an example of exactly how virtuoso a technique is required to bring off this passage at the required breathtaking speed.\n\nThe last movement of the \"Appassionata\" is another case in point where the level of our appreciation of Beethoven's genius is lifted by a speed which is fast and where we feel the performer is fearlessly on the edge, but where flawless execution is never in doubt.\n\nThe sonata which asks for the most nuance is \"Les Adieux\" where the poise and beauty, & feeling of regret are so sensitively achieved in the opening, before the explosion of joy erupts. The Andante espressivo contains the most profound utterances in this work and finds a response of the utmost sensitivity. Here Rose is not afraid to produce grandiose tone where needed and this attitude of going one step further than we might be used to, without ever creating a hard sound, is another aspect that sets these performances apart. The virtuoso is, however, the light-fingered magician in the Vivaccissamente, with a touch that became known as \"perle\" in the romantic era, and the quirkiness of this movement with its false endings which are testament to Beethoven's sense of humour bring this impressive and thought-provoking recital to an end.\n\nFono Forum - April 2014 - Written by Mario-Felix Vogt\n\nBereits 2008 veröffentlichte der amerikanische Pianist Jerome Rose eine Beethoven-DVD mit den letzten drei Klaviersonaten, nun präsentiert er sein zweites Beethoven-Album als hochauflösende Blu-ray: einen Konzertmitschnitt aus dem New Yorker Yamaha-Saal mit den fünf populären Sonaten „Pathétique“, „Mondschein“, „Waldstein“, „Appassionata“ und „Les Adieux“. Ohne aufwändige Schnitttechnik und optische Spielereien wurde das Ganze produziert, somit lenkt nichts von der Musik ab, gelegentlich wird das freundlich applaudierende Publikum eingeblendet. In seinem Umgang mit Beethoven zeigt sich der Serkin-Schüler als Meister der alten deutschen Schule. Geradlinig und großformatig angelegt ist sein Beethoven-Spiel, ohne Firlefanz, und die Bewegungsökonomie von Roses Klaviertechnik hat ihre musikalische Entsprechung in seiner subtilen Gestaltung von Agogik und Dynamik. Die langsamen Sätze nimmt er ähnlich wie Wilhelm Backhaus seinerzeit in recht zügigen Zeitmaßen („Mondscheinsonate“) und bringt sie wunderbar zum Singen, etwa das Adagio cantabile aus der „Pathétique“, während die Unerbittlichkeit mancher Fortissimo-Akkorde in der „Appassionata“ an Rudolf Serkin erinnert. Allerdings klingen auch diese Passagen nicht so schroff wie bisweilen bei Serkin, denn harsche Töne gibt es bei Rose nicht. Mögen seine Sechzehntel-Läufe auch nicht immer so gestochen scharf erscheinen wie bei Gulda und Pollini, so ist sein Beethoven-Spiel doch vor allem in den langsamen Sätzen wärmer und oft auch farbenreicher als das der beiden Pianistenstars.\n\nInternational Piano - March/April 2014 - Written by Julian Haylock\n\nJerome Rose Plays Beethoven - Live in Concert - Volume II\n\nTackling the five most popular nicknamed sonatas in the Beethoven canon is a formidable undertaking, yet Jerome Rose finds something significant to say in even the most hackneyed of masterpieces.\n\nTake the ‘Pathétique’, for example, whose famous opening movement is swept along on cantabile tides that trace the peaks and troughs of Beethoven’s structural imagination with unfailing acuity. If the prevailing modern trend is towards heavily weighted digital clarity and temporal exactitude, Rose creates impressionistic washes of sound with a malleability of timing that imbues his readings with a vital sense of recreative discovery. Where others – notably in the outer movements of the ‘Moonlight’ – have a tendency to treat every utterance with the weight of 200 years of interpretative accretion bearing down on its shoulders, Rose, dissolves the metronomic into washes of velvet-toned inspiration.\n\nRose’s tendency towards expressive narrative reaches its apex in the ‘Waldstein’, in a reading that fuses the music’s innate classicism with a Romantic impulse that emerges free of furrowed-brow, rhetorical strait-jacketing. We are so used to enduring head-splitting fortissimo sonorities in the modern age that it comes as a surprise to encounter in the ‘Appassionata’ an Arrau-like soundworld of luxurious resonance. An exquisite, dreamily reflective account of ‘Les adieux’ provides the musical icing on a richly rewarding recital of timeless classics.\n\nPianiste - January/February 2014 - Written by Stéphane Friédérich\n\nDisciple d’Adolph Baller, Leonard Shure et Rudolf Serkin, Jerome Rose fait partie de ces artistes qui possèdent en eux, «génétiquement» presque, une part de l’âme de l’Europe germanique et centrale. Professeur\n\ninternationalement reconnu, il poursuit l’enregistrement en vidéo de cycles de pieces considérées comme les fondements du répertoire classique et romantique.\n\nJerome Rose a choisi cinq sonates de Beethoven qu’il interprète sur un Yamaha CFX remarquablement réglé. Ses lectures étonnent presque tant elles contrastent avec les prestations hautes en couleurs et engestes…de tant de jeunes solistes actuels !\n\nÀ l’image, on ne verra pas de mouvements inconsidéréset, à l’oreille, de dynamiques fracassantes. La volonté\n\nde l’interprète est de s’effacer devant la musique et, dans le cas de Beethoven, d’en révéler l’architecture\n\nnée de formules avant tout rythmiques. Il va à l’essentiel, ne livrant que le texte, resserrant la masse sonore\n\ndans une sonorité pleine. Un Beethoven « pur », presque antiromantique, rappelant celui d’un Serkin dans l’Appassionata. Rien de grandiloquent non plus dans la Sonate «Pathétique » à l’énergie pourtant bondissante.\n\nDans la Sonate Waldstein, les courbes du chant n’appuient aucun effet, suppriment tout pathos. Le sens\n\ndu phrasé est naturel, idéal, au service de l’homogénéité du discours musical. Cet esprit narratif, de l’ordre de la\n\nconfidence dans cette sonate, fait songer à Edwin Fischer. Plus loin, dans la Sonate « Clair de Lune », on songe à l’austère conception de Wilhelm Backhaus. Il n’y a que chez les grands « légataires » du piano européen que l’on trouve encore l’empreinte des maîtres du passé. Souhaitons qu’elle demeure indélébile.\n\nEnglish Translation:\n\nDisciple of Adolph Baller, Leonard Shure and Rudolf Serkin, Jerome Rose is one of those artists who possess in them, almost \"genetically\", a part of the soul of Central and Germanic Europe. An internationally recognized Professor, he continues the recording on video of the cycles considered to be the foundations of the classical and romantic repertoire.\n\nJerome Rose chose five Beethoven sonatas that he performs on a remarkably regulated Yamaha CFX. His readings most surprise as they contrast with the colorful performances and gestures ... of so many of today’s young soloists!\n\nIn the video, we do not see unnecessary movements, nor for the ear, sensational dynamics. The desire of the interpreter is to yield to the music and, in the case of Beethoven to reveal the architecture born from all the rhythmic formulas. He goes to the point, reading only the text, tightening the mass of sound into one line of full sound. A Beethoven \"pure\", almost anti-romantic, is reminiscent of a Serkin in the Appassionata. There is nothing grandiose either in the Sonata \"Pathétique\" which nevertheless is bounding in energy.\n\nIn the Waldstein Sonata, the contours of the line do not support any effect, eliminating any pathos. The direction of the phrasing is natural, ideal, and in service to the homogeneity of musical discourse. This narrative spirit, and the confidence of order in this sonata, reminds one of Edwin Fischer. Later in the \"Moonlight\" Sonata one thinks of the austere conception of Wilhelm Backhaus. It is only among the great \"heirs\" of the European piano that one still finds the imprint of the masters of the past. Let’s hope it remains indelible.\n\nFono Forum - September 2013 - Written by Mario-Felix Vogt\n\nWenn man Jerome Rose als Interpreten beschreiben möchte, sollte man mit seinen Liszt-Aufnahmen beginnen. Dessen Klavierwerke haben das Schicksal, dass sie nur selten technisch wie musikalisch auf gleichermaßen hohem Niveau ge-spielt werden. Den Musikern, die nur über durchschnittliche Pianistik ver-fügen, fehlt das Handwerkszeug, den individualistischen Virtuosen Textver-ständnis und Disziplin und den Wett-bewerbspianisten, die seine Etüden allzu ˜ seelenlos wie eine Nähmaschine abspulen, die Sinnlichkeit. Zu den wenigen Interpreten, die Liszts manuelle Anfor-derungen souverän bewältigen und sich seinen Werken strukturbewusst und ohne Gefühligkeit nähern, gehören Svjatoslav Rich-ter, Clifford Curzon – und Jerome Rose.\n\nDass in dem 1938 geborenen Amerikaner ein echter Virtuose steckt, zeigt seine Aufnahme des buchstäblich donnernden Klavierstücks „Orage“ (zu Deutsch: Ge-witter) aus den „Années de pèlerinage“, Suisse, das er kra˜voller und brillanter eingespielt hat als seine berühmteren Kollegen Daniel Barenboim und Alfred Brendel. Auch die „Transzendentalen Etüden“ hat er gut im Griff: Die ob ihrer eminenten Schwierigkeit gefürchtete Etüde „Feux follets“ (zu Deutsch: Irr-lichter) ˛irrt unter seinen Händen und ist voller Leichtigkeit. Doch das Besondere an Roses Liszt-Spiel ist nicht seine Virtuosität – die rus-sischen Tastenakrobaten Lazar Berman und Boris Berezovsky wissen die Etüden noch einen Tick brillanter und präziser darzubieten –, sondern die Haltung, aus der heraus er sich Liszt nähert. Um die viel beschworene große Linie und um ein logisches und rhythmisch präzises Spiel ohne modische Mätzchen und Ef-fekte geht es ihm in seiner Darstellung der h-Moll-Sonate, und der Klavierken-ner Ingo Harden bringt es auf den Punkt, wenn er formuliert, dass Rose stets da-rum bemüht ist, „noch das geringste Formteil unter dem Gesichtswinkel des kompositorisch Ganzen darzustellen“.\n\nEr tut dies mit einem fülligen, bisweilen sinfonisch anmutendem Klavierton, der sich deutlich von der kühl-schlanken Klangäs-thetik seiner älteren ame-rikanischen Kollegen wie Leon Fleisher oder Gary Graffman abhebt. Ein weiterer Komponist, der Jerome Rose besonders am Herzen liegt, ist Brahms. Den Beginn der f-Moll-Sonate gestaltet er mit orches- traler Wucht und wunderbar sonoren Bässen und proÿliert die Charaktere von Haupt- und Seitenthema sehr gegensätz-lich, ohne den Überblick zu verlieren, und für die beliebte g-Moll-Rhapsodie op. 79 wählt er ein ˛üssiges Tempo und wirkt so jeglicher Sentimentalität ent-gegen. Auch seine DVD mit Schuberts späten Sonaten setzt Maßstäbe in der gelungenen Synthese aus struktureller Bewusstheit und wohldosierter Poesie. Dass ein Künstler mit dem interpre-tatorischen Proÿl von Jerome Rose auch ein herausragender Beethoven-Spieler staltet die Oberstimme als „primus inter pares“. In letzter Zeit setzt er sich wieder intensiv mit Beethoven auseinander: Im Juni hat er eine Blu-ray mit den fünf berühmtesten Sonaten („Pathétique“, „Mondschein“, „Waldstein“, „Appassio-nata“ und „Les Adieux“) aufgenommen, sie wird in Kürze erscheinen, und als ich ihn im März in Paris traf, war er gerade mit der Produktion einer Master Class auf Video beschä˜ igt, in der er Hinweise zur Interpretation und zum Üben von technischen Details in Beethoven-Sona-ten gibt. Zwischen den Aufnahmen hatte er Zeit für ein Gespräch...\n\nJerome, wie sind Sie zur Musik ge-kommen?\n\nMein Lieblingsausdruck dafür ist: prä-natale Vorbestimmung. (lacht) Schon vor meiner Geburt hatte meine Mutter beschlossen: Bringt sie ein Mädchen zur Welt, dann wird es eine Tänzerin, ist es ein Junge, dann wird er Pianist. In meinem Geburtsjahr ging sie sogar zu Konzerten in die Hollywood Bowl, um den Embryo musikalisch zu inspirie-ren. Sie hatte eine große Leidenscha˜ für die Musik und wünschte sich eben-so leidenscha˜ lich, dass ihr Sohn ein Musiker wird. Wir nennen in den USA diese Mütter Klaviermütter, sie unter-scheiden sich nicht prinzipiell von den Tennis- oder Eislaufmüttern. Mein Weg war also vorgezeichnet. Mit dreieinhalb Jahren ÿ ng ich an Klavier zu spielen, und mit vier konnte ich bereits Noten lesen. Dann bekam ich Unterricht bei dem in Los Angeles sehr angesehenen Konzertpianisten Marvin Maazel. Er war der Onkel des Dirigenten Lorin Maazel und hatte vor dem Zweiten Weltkrieg eine große Karriere in Europa, konnte aber während des Kriegs kaum Konzerte geben. Da er schließlich von irgendetwas leben musste, war er gezwungen, Kinder zu unterrichten. Denn außerhalb der berühmten Musikhochschulen wie der Juilliard School in New York und dem Curtis Institute in Philadelphia gab es damals wenige Institute in den USA, selbst in Los Angeles existierte damals kein wirkliches Musikhochschulleben.\n\nSie haben in den siebziger Jahren für das Label Vox eine ganze Serie an Liszt-Werken eingespielt. Wie hat sich das ergeben? Was mögen Sie an Liszt?\n\nNun, ich hatte damals bereits Schumann aufgenommen, und der Vox-Gründer George Mendelssohn wollte gerne weitere Aufnahmen mit mir machen. Er stellte mich vor die Wahl: entweder Liszts „Années de pèlerinage“ oder alle Clementi-Sonaten. Da ent-schied ich mich natürlich für Liszt. Ich war damals bereits in meinen Dreißigern und musste nun das ganze Liszt-Reper-toire neu lernen, denn während meines Studiums hatte mich niemand in seine Werke eingeführt. Nun wurde ich plötz-lich als Liszt-Interpret berühmt und be-kam für die Aufnahmen den Grand Prix du Disque. Ich bin dafür sehr dankbar.\n\nGlauben Sie, dass seine Musik immer noch unterschätzt wird?\n\nOh ja. Seine Werke werden außerdem meistens schlecht gespielt. Er war ein großer Klassizist, der den kompletten Schubert, Beethoven und Mozart stu-dierte, also das wichtige Repertoire der Wiener Klassik. Ein Interpret sollte sich seiner Musik mit der gleichen Heiligkeit nähern wie einer Beethoven-Sonate. Ich schätze die Verzerrungen und die Frei-heiten gar nicht, die sich viele Pianisten in Liszts Stücken nehmen. Musikalische Freiheit und musikalischer Ausdruck entstehen aus einer wirklichen Kenntnis des Notentexts. Undiszipliniertes Musi-zieren hingegen empÿ nde ich als chao-tisch, vor allem kann ich es gar nicht er-tragen, wenn Pianisten nicht zählen. Die grundlegendste Organisation von Musik ist doch Rhythmus. Viele Pianisten von heute möchten vor allem Individualisten sein. Für mich ist wirklich großes Kla-vierspiel jedoch dadurch charakterisiert, dass man die Individualität des Inter-preten gar nicht bewusst wahrnimmt, weil man die pure Musik hört. Ein wirklich exzellentes Bœuf Bourgignon basiert doch auch auf einem guten Stück Fleisch und nicht auf den später hin-zugefügten Gewürzen.\n\nWenn es Ihnen vor allem um die Musik selbst geht, wie-so produzieren Sie seit sechs Jahren vorwiegend Konzert-mitschnitte auf DVD und Blu-ray?\n\nIch denke, dass der visuelle Aspekt einer Auff ührung ebenfalls wichtig ist. Es ist doch toll, György Cziff ra beim Spielen zuzusehen oder Benno Moisei-witsch, all diesen großartigen Künstlern, die leider nicht mehr unter uns sind. Diese Filme sind wichtige historische Dokumente. Was hätte ich darum gege-ben, Schnabel und Rachmaninow beim Spielen zu erleben. Mit meinen eigenen Konzertÿ lmen versuche ich ebenfalls eine Tradition am Leben zu erhalten: das Klavierspiel der Serkin-Schnabel-Ära, die alte deutsch-wienerische Tradition. Denn ich möchte gerne etwas von Be-deutung hinterlassen.\n\nEnglish Translation:\n\nFor the last few years there has been an artist, whose recordings regularly receive the highest ratings in FONOFORUM: Jerome Rose is his name, student of Rudolf Serkin, and one of the most important American pianists. On August 12th, he will celebrate his 75th Birthday – one more reason to present him. Mario-Felix Vogt met the artist in Paris.\n\nIf one wants to describe Jerome Roses artistic personality, one should start with his Liszt-recordings. These works have the unfortunate fate of being rarely performed well in technical and musical aspects. Those musicians that have only mediocre pianistic skills lack the right tools, individualistic virtuosos lack text understanding and discipline and Competition pianists, who unspool his etudes often soulless like sowing machines, lack sensibility. Amongst the few pianists that can master Liszt’s manual demands and approach them with sense of structure and without sentimentality, are Svjatoslav Richter, Clifford Curzon – and Jerome Rose. His literally thundering recording of the piano piece “Orage” from the “Annees de pelerinage”, Suisse, shows that there is a true virtuoso within him. He plays it more powerful and brilliantly than his famous colleagues Daniel Barenboim and Alfred Brendel. Also his Transcendental Etudes are masterful: the etude “Feux folltes”, much feared for its eminent difficulty, flickers under his hands and is full of lightness.\n\nYet, the exceptional about his playing is not his virtuosity – Russian key-acrobats like Lazar Berman and Boris Berezowsky know how to present these etudes even a tad more brilliantly and precicely – but the demeanor in which he approaches Liszt. He cares about the much-adjured big line and a logical and rhythmically precise playing in his performance of the b minor sonata. Piano expert Ingo Harden puts it in a nutshell, when he writes that Rose constantly seeks to “ demonstrate yet the smallest form among the many viewpoints of the whole composition”. He does so with a full, sometimes symphonic tone, which distinguishes considerably from the cool, slim sound aesthetic of his older American collegues like Leon Fleisher or Gary Graffman.\n\nAnother composer that is very dear to Jerome Rose is Brahms. He shapes the beginning of the f minor sonata with orchestral weight and wonderfully sonorous basses and profiles the characters of the main theme very contrastingly, without ever losing the overview. For the popular g minor Rhapsody Op. 79 he chose a flowing tempo and thus counteracts any unnecessary sentimentality. His DVD with Schubert’s late Sonatas sets standards in terms of successful synthesis of structural awareness and well-dosed poetry.\n\nIt seems obvious that an artist with a interpretative profile like Jerome Rose must be a extraordinary Beethoven-player. In fact, in 1978 he recorded the three most popular Sonatas “Pathetique”, “Moonlight” and “Appassionata”, as well as the last three sonatas and the Sonata Op. 101, the latter actually twice, in 2001 as CD and 2008 as DVD. Rose takes the final movements of the “Moonlight” and the “Appassionata” very tempestuously, powerful and with a rounder, more orchestral sound than, lets say, Friedrich Gulda, whose Fortissimo arrives in a rather steely vestment. The slow movements he mostly plays song-like and simple, yet accompanying figures don’t disappear in a marsh of sound, Rose leaves them their melodic value and shapes the soprano line as “primus inter pares”. It recent years he has been dealing with Beethoven very intensely: in June he recorded a DVD with the five most famous sonatas (“Pathetique”, “Moonlight”, “Waldstein”, “Appassionata”, and “Les Adieux”), that will soon be released, and when I met him this March in Paris, he was working on a Masterclass Video, in which he gives advice on interpretation and practicing technical details in Beethoven-Sonatas. In-between the recordings he took the time for an interview…\n\nJerome, how did you find this music?\n\nMy favorite expression for that is prenatal predestination (laughs). Already before my birth, my mother had decided: if she gave birth to a girl it would become a dancer, if it was a boy, he would become a pianist. In the year that I was born she went to concerts at the Hollywood Bowl to musically inspire the embryo. She had a great passion for music and wished so passionately that her son would become a musician. In America we call these kinds of mothers “Piano Mums”, in principle they don’t differ from “Tennis Mums” or “Figure Skating Mums”. My path was therefore already paved. With three and a half years I began to play the piano, and at four years old, I was able to read music. Then I started lessons with Marvin Maazel, a concert pianist that was very reputable in Los Angeles. He was the uncle of the conductor Lorin Maazel and had had a great career in Europe before the Second World War, however had to stop playing concerts during the war. Because he had to make a living, he started teaching children. Besides the famous music conservatories like the Juilliard School in New York and the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, there was little else in the United States, even in Los Angeles there was no real music conservatory.\n\nIn the Seventies you recorded for Vox a series of Liszt’s works. How did that come about? What do you like about Liszt?\n\nWell, I had recorded some Schumann at the time and the founder of Vox George Mendelssohn wanted to make more recordings with me. He gave me the choice: either Liszt’s “Annees de pelerinage” or all Clementi sonatas. Naturally, I chose Liszt. At the time I was already in my thirties and had to now learn the whole Liszt repertoire, because during my college years I wasn’t really introduced to it. Suddenly I became known as a Liszt-performer and received for those recordings the Grand Prix du Disque, which I am very thankful for.\n\nDo you think that his music is still underestimated?\n\nOh yes. His works are also often played badly. He was a big classicist, who studied the complete Schubert, Beethoven and Mozart, the most important repertoire of Classical Vienna. A performer should approach his works with the same sanctity than a Beethoven-Sonata. I don’t approve of the many distortions and liberties pianists take when playing Liszt. Musical freedom and musical expression develop from true knowledge of the text. To me, undisciplined music making sounds chaotic, and I especially dislike it when pianists don’t count. The most basic organization of music is through rhythm. Many pianists today want to be individualistic. To me though, really great playing is shown when one doesn’t consciously perceive the individual of the performer over the music. After all, a really excellent Boeuf Bourgignon is based on good meat and not spices that are added later.\n\nIf you care about the music above all else, why have you produced predominantly Live-Recordings on DVD and Blu-ray for the last six years?\n\nI believe that the visual aspect of a performance is also very important. It is so great to watch Gyorgy Cziffra play or Benno Moiseiwitsch, all these extraordinary artists that are unfortunately no longer amongst us. These films are important historical documents. What wouldn’t I have given to experience Schnabel or Rachmaninoff at the piano. With my own concert films I am also trying to keep a tradition alive: the piano playing of the Serkin-Schnabel era, the old German-Viennese tradition. Because I want to leave behind something of importance.\n\nPianoNews - March/April 2013 - Written by Carsten Dürer\n\nIn den vergangenen 10 Jahren ist der amerikanische Pianist Jerome Rose wieder äußerst aktiv geworden und konnte an seine große Karriere in den 60er Jahren, nachdem er den Busoni-Wettbewerb gewonnen hatte, anknüpfen. Weniger im konzertierenden Bereich als vielmehr als weltweit anerkannter Pädagoge und mit seinen CD-Produktionen.\n\nMittlerweile hat er sich allerdings auf Einspielungen auf DVD verlegt und bringt nun auch noch eine Produktion auf den Markt, die nurmehr als Blu-Ray-DVD erscheint. Ob dieses Format in Europa schon so weit angenommen ist, dass man diese DVD gut verkaufen kann, sei dahingestellt. Letztendlich geht es um die Interpretationen von Rose.\n\nUnd nachdem er schon eine DVD mit Schumann-Werken vorgestellt hat, hat er sich nun die zyklischen Charakter-Werke von Schumann vorgenommen. Schon in den „Davidsbündlertänzen“ zeigt sich vor allem eines: Rose hat eine deutliche Vorstellung von der Gesamtstruktur, weiß den dramatischen Bogen zu spannen, ohne ihn zu unterbrechen. Auch in Bezug auf die Klanggebung kann er punkten.\n\nIn den „Symphonischen Etüden“ sind Kleinigkeiten manchmal etwas unscharf, aber es entsteht ein wirklich überzeugendes zyklisches Denken. Jerome Rose ist ein Pianist alten Schlags, verkörpert in seinem Spiel fast schon vergessene Qualitäten der Pianistik: Ruhig und konzentriert in jeder Bewegung mit einer bestechenden Ökonomie der Hände auf der Klaviatur weiß er vor allem sich selbst zuzuhören, seinen Klang zu gestalten, so dass niemals wirklich etwas hässlich, oder übertrieben klingt.\n\nEr arbeitet schwer an den Werken, lässt den Zuschauer nicht im Ungewissen, dass diese Werke emotionale Tiefe vom Interpreten verlangen. Und vor allem in der 2. Klaviersonate kommt es durch diese Art des Spiels zu den wirklich großen und überzeugenden Momenten: Jerome Rose weiß die Facetten zwischen rauschhaften Ergüssen und der lyrisch-überzeugenden Gestaltung brillant auszutarieren, um dieser Sonate ein Gesicht – ein ganz persönliches – zu geben.\n\nRose, der Yamaha CFX-Flügel und das Spiel sind auf dieser Blu-Ray-DVD die alleinigen Protagonisten. Kein Firlefanz, vier unterschiedliche Kameraeinstellungen und der dunkle Vorhang im Hintergrund konzentrieren die Sicht des Zuschauers noch einmal mehr auf die Musik. Warum also eine Blu-Ray-DVD? Schade, da viele dieses Spiel auf diese Weise (noch) nicht erleben können.\n\nEnglish Translation:\n\nOver the last 10 years, American pianist Jerome Rose has become very active again and has been able to continue his great career that began in the 60s with his win at the Busoni Competition, now less as a concert pianist and more as a world-renowned pedagogue and through his CD productions. Recently he has focused on DVD recordings and now published a new production in Blu-ray Disc form. It is debatable whether or not this format has established itself enough in Europe to sell well.\n\nBut in the end, it is all about Rose’s interpretations. Having already presented a DVD with Schumann works, he now takes on the cyclical character works of Schumann. Already in the Davidsbündlertänze one thing in particular is evident: Rose has a clear vision of the overall structure and knows how to build a dramatic arc without interruptions. He also impresses with his sound. In the Symphonic Etudes some little details are unclear, but a truly convincing cyclical thought is created.\n\nJerome Rose is a pianist of the old school. Embodied in his playing are almost forgotten qualities of pianism: calm and focused in all his movements, with an incredible economy of the hands' movement on the keyboard, he, above all, knows how to listen to himself, to shape his sound so that nothing is ever ugly or overdone; working hard on the pieces, the audience is never guessing that these works require a great emotional depth from its interpreter. Especially in the second Sonata, with this kind of playing, the really great and convincing musical moments are created. Jerome Rose knows how to brilliantly balance all the facets between ecstatic outpouring and lyrical shaping to give this Sonata a very personal character.\n\nRose, the Yamaha CFX, and his playing are the protagonists of this DVD. With no frills, four different camera angles, and a dark curtain in the background, the attention of the viewer is focused ever more on the music. So why a Blu-ray Disc? It's a pity, because this way many cannot (yet) experience this playing.\n\nInternational Piano - January/February 2013 - Written by Julian Haylock\n\nThere is nothing worse than over-excitable, overinterpreted Schumann, so it comes as something of a relief to encounter this second volume of favourite works from Jerome Rose, who absorbs the composer's free-flowing imagination into compelling musical paragraphs. Even when the flights of fancy come thick and fast, as in Davidsbündlertänze, one is left with the sensationof supreme logic binding everything together.\n\nIn the Op 12 Fantasiestücke, not a single ugly note is sounded. No matter how awkward and fatiguing Schumann's figurations - most infamously in Traumes Wirren - Rose maintains a remarkably relaxed action, so that at times it looks as if he is merely flopping his fingers gently onto the keys and somehow sounding the right notes.\n\nNot surprisingly, the Etudes symphoniques (without the posthumous numbers) respond particularly well to his ability to sustain the long line that underpins the whole structure. Without resorting to extremes of dynamic or articulation,this is a reading that emphasises the 'symphonic' rather than the 'etude'. However, there are technical triumphs along the way too, not least in Etude 10, where Rose manages to despatch the toccata-like figurations against continuously sounded dotted rhythms without using the sustaining pedal.\n\nKreisleriana is another magisterial conception that refreshingly avoids outbursts of mannered interpretative rhetoric, yet it is the Second Sonata that really lifts the roof off, with its combination of high-velocity agility and velvety sonorities.The recording and pin-sharp picture quality capture Rose's effortless playing to perfection, and the direction rightly focuses our attention on where it needs to be - those amazing hands.\n\nPianiste \"Pianiste - Maestro\" - January/February 2013 - Written by Stéphane Friédérich\n\nCe qui frappe en premier dans l'interprétation de Jerome Rose, c'est l'extraordinaire souplesse du geste.\n\nLe pianiste semble davantage dialoguer avec l'instrument qu'engager un combat contre lui.\n\nDans Schumann, prendre ses distances avec le clavier peut s'avérer périlleux. Le toucher est ici d'une remarquable précision. Il reste fluide, élégant.\n\nLes traits et accords ne sont jamais forcés alors que le son, dans les Etudes Symphoniques, par exemple, est projeté avec éclat. C'est un piano charnu (superbe Yamaha CFX) qui respire à l'allure d'une promenade romantique. Jerome Rose cherche avant tout la clarté du récit, la logique interne de la musique, sans surcharger les lignes des Fantasiestücke. Point d'hallucination, de déferlement de puissance.\n\nIl suggère la passion plutôt que l'exhibitionnisme. C'est plus net encore dans les Davidsbündlertänze, remarquables de lisibilité.\n\nLa beauté de la phrase, sa plastique bien ciselée, l'emporte sur la démonstration pure, renouvelant l'attention comme pour la délicate Seconde Sonate dans laquelle il est si facile de s'égarer. La caméra très intrusive nous place au plus près du clavier.\n\nCes interprétations au caractère artistocratique sont aussi des leçons de maître !\n\nWhat is first noticeable in Jerome Rose’s interpretation, is the extraordinary smoothness of movement. The pianist seems be in a dialogue with the instrument rather than in a fight with it. In Schumann, getting away from the keyboard may be risky. But here, the playing is remarkably precise and remains fluid and elegant.\n\nTechnical passages are never forced, while the sound, in the Symphonic Etudes, is projected with brio. It’s a robust piano (superb Yamaha CFX) that breathes as in a romantic promenade. Jerome Rose searches for the clarity of the line before anything else, the internal logic of music, without exaggerating the lines of Fantasiestücke. No hallucination or surge of power. Everything suggests passion rather than mere display. Even moreso in the Davidsbündlertänze, marvelously intelligible.\n\nThe beauty of the phrase and its well-cut sculpting, gives more than pure demonstration, renewing the attention as in the delicate Second Sonata in which it is so easy to wander. The very intrusive camera places us as close to the keyboard as possible.\n\nThese aristocratic interpretations are also lessons from a master!\n\nPianiste - January/February 2013 - Written by Stéphane Friédérich\n\nWhile visiting Paris we met with the American pianist Jerome Rose whose new recording is devoted to the works of Schumann.\n\nLike many American musicians trained after the war, Jerome Rose benefited from the presence of many artists exiled from Europe:\n\n“My musical tradition is more Russian and German. Russian in the sense that I’ve benefited from a school that knew how to exploit the physical capacities of beginners. I am not talking about style or sound, but of the coordination of body motions.”\n\nThe pianist is conscious of the extreme diversity of teachings within the same school.\n\n“I was lucky enough to begin music in Los Angeles. The city was, by then, home of Heifetz, Rubinstein, Rachmaninov, Stravinsky, Piatigorsky… then, I went to San Francisco, another cultural city, with Isaac Stern, Yehudi Menuhin, Leon Fleisher. I studied with a student of Joseph Lhévinne, then of Adolphe Baller, a protégé of Arthur Schnable. I also studied with Leonard Shure and Rudolf Serkin.”\n\nJerome Rose has recorded dozens of CDs of romantic composers.\n\n“To be honest, my interest in this repertoire came fairly late. I became an interpreter of Liszt thanks to my recording contracts! I was better prepared to play Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert, Rachmaninov and Scriabin. But I believe that one has to perform other composers than the ones one already knows. Take Serkin, for instance. He was not considered an interpreter of Chopin. Yet, he forced himself to perform all his Etudes in concert.”\n\nDo we have to possess special abilities to interpret Liszt’s music?\n\n“A pianist should be able to play everything,” replies Jerome Rose.\n\nDoes he think the same about contemporary music?\n\n“What we once considered “contemporary” has sometimes become “classic” today. Everybody can play the Schoenberg Piano Concerto or works by Dutilleux. The question that arises about contemporary music is somehow quite simple: what does the music mean? Can I memorize it? If not, then I do not see how it could stay in History…”\n\nJerome Rose’s teaching and especially his masterclasses, are much sough after. What does he get from it?\n\n“As Arthur Schnable explained, I learn more from my students than they learn from me. To teach, is to reflect upon one’s own playing. One cannot teach a work that one has not played.”\n\nAre there interpretative parameters that cannot be taught?\n\n“The way to use one’s own corporeal energy...that cannot be taught. Video recordings constitute a great improvement because the intensity of a performer is immediately caught on camera. Look at Cziffra’s playing...it’s staggering!”\n\nA jury member of numerous prestigious international competitions, Jerome Rose gives us food for thought about competitions:\n\n“Competitions have become, everywhere, a foundation of our society. We always have to be at our best, at any time. But for a jury, what matters is to be convinced that the contestant loves what s/he is playing.”\n\nAre competitions necessary then?\n\n“Yes, if the contestant understands that it represents only a moment in his/her whole career. And among young artists who win competitions, only a few will become great artists, because their interpretations will be enriched by their lives.\n\nEPTA - Winter 2012 - Written by Angela Brownridge\n\nDuring the early days of his career Jerome Rose recorded an album of Schumann that contained two of the works on this Blue-ray disc: Davidsbundlertanze and Kreisleriana. I was privileged to be present in London's Wigmore Hall when that recording was made and remember vividly Rose's enviable technique, impetuosity and vigour. It was a very physical performance, being that of a young man caught up in the power he was able to wield with an extraordinary passion and wildness, yet with compelling control and accuracy. Listening to and watching this great pianist in this latest recording, the same passion and verve have remained throughout a life in which his performances have gained even more depth of character, more dynamic interest, and that elusive way of playing Schumann which provokes the feeling that it is as the composer would have heard it in his mind. Rose has been described as \"the Last Romantic of our own age\", and one telling feature which is consistent in all his performances of these major works of Schumann is the freedom of expression in the moulding of the phrases, coupled with stunning virtuosity applied with consummate ease. It is an incredible feat to be able to produce performances such as these live in concert, and the sound on the Blue-ray is sharp, immediate and superior to that of DVDs. The film itself has enough variety of shots to maintain the interest, and Rose's playing is a masterclass in economy of movement in everthing from hushed cantabile to ferocious power.\n\nFor pianists who play romantic music there has been perhaps more emphasis on the works of Chopin and Liszt than on those of Schumann. The difference which makes Schumann a more complex composer, and therefore more difficult to interpret, is the personal element in which he exhibits the two sides of his personality, naming them Florestan (the extrovert), and Eusebius (the dreamer). This brings an extra dimension to his music which demands the imagination of the performer to step inside these characters to reveal them. The Davidsbündlertänze constitutes a self-portrait provided by Schumann of his \"varied states of mind\", highlighted and objectified by the characteristics of Florestan and Eusebius. It is also a representation of the Davidsbünd, Schumann's imaginary spiritual brotherhood of artists whose aim was to combat the superficial nature of contemporary culture. The composer creates music for dancing, romantic love and longing, whilst exploring the innermost thoughts of his mind. There are many recorded versions of this piece ranging from Gieseking (1942), Rosen (1963), Kempf (1967), Ashkenhazy and Hough (1988), and Pollini (2001). To take the opening of Hough's version which gives a preview of both Florestan and Eusebius, there is a myriad of contrasts, and his initial approach is too dreamy without the immediate plunge into the energy which Rose creates; and Rose is the only pianist who takes notice of the 'Immer lebendiger'('livelier') - at the bottom of the first page. Pollini's 'Innig' ('profound, intimate'), one of the Eusebius pieces, is beautifully tender. Hough's is rather slow, almost too introspective, and Rose captures the mood perfectly by not over-indulging the sentiment. Pollini's 'Ungeduldig' ('impatient'), number 4, is too circumspect, and this is where Rose is at his best, driving the music forward. This applies to number six, 'Sehr Rasch' ('very fast'), where with Rose there is no compromise; and the uninhibited upsurge of number 9, although marked 'Lebhaft' ('lightly'), reflects the wild side of Schumann's nature. The ending , 'Nicht schnell' (not fast), benefits from Rose's understatement, as he understands the need for simplicity to put this wonderful set of pieces to bed.\n\nFantaisiestücke Op. 12 is a set of eight pieces, the title being inspired by the 1814 collection of novellas 'Fantaisiestücke in Callots Manier' by one of Schumann's favourite authors E T A Hoffman. These pieces again represent the duality of Schumann's personality in the form of Florestan and Eusebius. The opening piece belongs to Eusebius, 'Des Abends' a gentle picture of dusk. 'Aufschwung' ('soaring, very fast') finds Rose able to stretch the interval of a tenth in the first bar, (a motif repeated many times), with consummate ease, whereas other pianists such as Brendel appear to have more difficulty. Brendel's 'Grillen' (Whims) is lacking in energy, and whilst his 'In der nacht' (In the night') has clarity and beautiful articulation, Rose's interpretation strikes me immediately as being in a different class from the many others I have heard. It's spooky, cloaked in mist, and moves faster than other versions of which its agitation and turbulence makes it the most compelling version, along with 'Traumes Wirren' ('disturbed dreams') which moves at the ultimate fast pace while losing none of the detail.\n\nKriesleriana - an enigmatic title of which, in a letter to Simonin de Sire, Schumann wrote: (talking of his new compositions): \"of all these, Kreisleriana is my favourite. This title conveys nothing to any but Germans. Kreisler is one of E.T.A Hoffmann's creations, an eccentric, wild and witty conductor. You will like some of it. The inscriptions over my pieces always occur to me after I have finished composing the music.\" So the wildness begins with the first piece, and I immediately went to Argerich's recording of 1984 knowing that she would be able to deliver all the excitement needed, with the magical contrast of the mesmerising second section: in the closing bars, she almost becomes hysterical, and loses some of the necessary weight. Rose maintains his equilibrium with just a little more emphasis on the build-up of phrases and the important sforzandos. In the second piece, 'sehr innig und nicht so rasch' ('very intimate and not too fast'), Argerich is slower, creating expressive lines, whereas Rose moves forward, and it made me ponder the fact that most pianists opt for a musical performance of movements like this, pausing at the end of phrases, where perhaps Schumann envisaged something on less preconceived lines. Highlights of Rose's performance are number 3, 'Sehr aufgeregt' ('very excited') moving slightly faster than other versions, with highly expressive playing in the slower section with the undulating phrases beautifully captured. In number 6, 'Sehr langsam' ('very slow') Argerich opts for a much slower interpretation which is very Bachian in the second section. Rose has the wind behind him in the demi-semiquavers of this passage,which is not saying they are too fast; and in number 7,\n\nmarked 'very fast', Rose is dazzling, able to employ a breathtaking speed. Again he is totally convincing in number 8, 'Schnell und spielend' ('fast and with ease') with its wispy, enigmatic feel, finding just the right tempo for the lopsided left-hand octaves.\n\nThe Symphonic Studies Op. 13 form a contrast to the previous sets of pieces, in that they are variations and therefore concerned with musical development rather than exploring the characteristics of Schumann's personality. Ashkenazy takes a slow tempo for the theme, and Richter is extremely slow. In variation 1 Ashkenazy is muted, and Rose utilises the spikyness of the dotted rhythms to good effect. In this set there are also two movements which make me think I have never heard such a telling interpretation as Rose's with as much intensity of feeling in the melody and throbbing bass of variation 8. The music is propelled forward without losing any of its depth, and in the next variation one can hear every note of Askenazy's, as one would expect, but with Rose the figurations swirl in waves to great effect. There are speed changes in Ashkenazy's finale when the music drops to piano. Rose keeps up the momentum , with fast octave- and chordal-playing being one of his great strengths. He provides a convincing end to what can sometimes sound somewhat banal.\n\nThe G minor Sonata Op. 82 brings to an end this Schumann recital; both its outer movements demand great speed, the first being marked 'as fast as possible', and the fourth and last movement 'very fast', with a coda which exhorts the pianist to play faster and even faster, which might strike one as being impossible! There are ways round this, but a recording by Anton Kuerti falls sadly short of really trying to get a move on. It's very four-square, the slow movement also being at a very slow tempo which robs the music of movement. Richter decides to go for the very fast tempo, although not from the start. He gets into his stride only after the notorious octave passage near the beginning where the left hand has to stretch in tenths and the right to leap in octaves over ninths. From here on Richter's priority is speed which he can deliver marvellously, often quite lightly. Rose links his speed to the melodic element in the first movement, which is a different approach from that of a headlong dash. The interspersed slow sections he takes quite fast with only a little of the perpetual slowing down the composer asks for. His slow movement has some beautiful cantabile, growing to one of the most passionate climaxes I have heard. The third movement is thrown off with the aplomb it requires, and the final Rondo does meet its 'presto' specification, with a lightness which makes it swift rather than heavy, not really going for the crescendos. Richter also goes for the speed, and Rose in the final section is equally formidable, particularly considering that he is playing live.\n\nIt is very difficult to compare CD recordings with this Blue-ray DVD, but naturally the addition of a picture, as well as some of the best sound-quality one could hope to find, would make it a must-see and -hear version. Overall, what is most compelling is Rose's experience of the works he plays, which has given him a consistency and insight, coupled with his technique which knows no limitations. He is without doubt one of the greatest Schumann interpreters of all time.\n\nPianoNews - November/December 2012 - Written by Ernst Hoffmann\n\nMan spürt bei jedem Ton und bei jedem gefilmten Portrait dieses Pianisten, wie stark die Seelenverwandtschaft zwischen Johannes Brahms und Jerome Rose ist. Er sei sehr eng mit dieser Musik verbunden, erklärt der 74-Jährige in einem Monolog über Brahms im Anhang. Seit seiner ersten Begegnung mit der Klaviermusik von Brahms - es waren seinerzeit einmal die Händel-Variationen - habe er sein\n\nWissen über diese Musik immer weiter verfeinert. Dabei sei ihm auch bewusst geworden, dass aus den Klavierwerken sogar Brahms' große Kenntnis der Werke Richard Wagners herauszulesen sei.\n\nBei der Arbeit an den Klavierstücken op. 76 habe sich Brahms intensiv mit Chopin beschäftigt und diese Serie hätte auch eine unverkennbare Verbindung zum Violinkonzert und den Violinsonaten.\n\nEtwas topfig wirkt die akustische Atmosphäre beim Auftrittsapplaus von Jerome Rose im kleinen Saal des Yamaha Artist Service Centers New York. Sehr markig und entschlossen gestaltet Rose die akkordischen Intervallsprünge zu Beginn der Klaviersonate Nr. 3 op. 5 und leitet mit Hilfe einer sukzessiven Entspannung zum Seitenthema über. Gerade in diesem Frühwerk, das Rose auch als Studie für die\n\ngroßen sinfonischen Werke empfindet, legt er es auf extreme Kontraste an, ohne dass dabei Brüche entstehen. Zuweilen hebt er die linke Hand bei Crescendi stärker hervor als die rechte, als wolle er die Phrase mit einem dicken Filzstift unterstreichen. Auch im Finale der Klaviersonate oder bei den „Zwei Rhapsodien\" op. 79 erzeugt er aufregend weiche Konturen, die mit den kapriziösen Teilen der\n\nWerke kontrastieren. Dem Moderato semplice der Intermezzi op. 117 verleiht er eine Erhabenheit, die fast an Liszt erinnert. Die Kameraperspektiven sind oft kreuzförmig angelegt, manchmal überlagern sich die Bilder für Sekunden oder verschwimmen stimmungsvoll ineinander. Dann öffnet sich plötzlich eine Raute, die die Frontalansicht des Pianisten einblendet, oder das Bild wird zweigeteilt und\n\nman sieht Rose nebeneinander von der Seite und von vorne.\n\nThrough every note and every filmed portrait of this pianist, one can feel the strong affinity of nature between Johannes Brahms and Jerome Rose. \"I feel very connected to this music\", explains the 74-yearold pianist in a monologue about Brahms in the bonus feature of his new DVD. Since his first recording encounter with the piano music of Brahms – it was the Haendel-Variations then – he has refined his knowledge about this music. In doing so, he also became aware of how one can interpret from the music, Brahms’ incredible knowledge of the works of Richard Wagner. When working on the Klavierstuecke Op. 76, Brahms also studied the works of Chopin intensely. Furthermore, this opus has unmistakable connections to the violin concerto and the violin sonatas, Rose explains.\n\nThe acoustic atmosphere of the small hall at the Yamaha Artist Service Center in New York City seems a little subdued during the entrance applause for Jerome Rose.\n\nHis interval jumps are very marked and decisive at the beginning of the Piano Sonata Nr. 3 op 5 but with a gradual relaxation he leads into the second theme. Especially in this early work, which Rose cites as an excellent study for the great symphonic works, he opts for extreme contrasts without fragmenting the piece. Sometimes he intensifies the left hand over the right one, as if he wanted to emphasize the phrase with a big pen. In the finale of the Piano Sonata, as well as in the two Rhapsodies op 79, he creates excitingly soft contours that contrast well to the capricious sections. His Moderato Semplice of the Intermezzi Op. 117 has a grandeur that resembles that of Liszt.\n\nThe camera perspectives are often in cross-form and sometimes the pictures are superimposed on each other, or blend atmospherically into one another. Then suddenly a diamond form opens from the center of the screen that fades to a frontal perspective of the pianist, or the screen will be divided in half, and one sees Rose both from the side and the front.\n\nFono Forum - May 2012 - Written by Ingo Harden\n\nMeisterlich\n\nSeit einiger Zeit bringt Jerome Rose Hauptwerke der klassisch-romantischen Klaviermusik in repräsentativen Zusammenstel­lungen auf dem eigenem Label Medici Classics heraus. Parallel dazu erscheint seit einigen Jahren eine ähnlich angelegte DVD-Serie, die inzwischen beim „Vol. 6“ angelangt ist. Der Band zeigt den bald 74-jährigen Amerikaner in Live-Auftritten mit der großen f-Moll-Sonate und allen dreißig „späten“ Klavierstücken von Brahms. Ein stolzes Programm, das nicht nur ein imponierendes Bild des Kom­ponisten entwirft, sondern von dem einstigen Rudolf-Serkin-Schüler auch in imponierender Manier absolviert wird: sicher und gewichtig, schlicht und konzentriert sachbezogen, kraftvoll expressiv, ohne gefühlige oder schwerblütige Seitenpfade einzuschlagen, rhythmisch flexibel nur, wenn dies struktureller Er­hel­lung der Musik dient.\n\nDie Realisierung unterstreicht den absolut seriösen Charakter von Roses Musizieren durch eine Kameraführung, die ohne Rück­sicht auf filmisch „interessantere“ Perspektiven oder gar Effekte ihr Hauptaugenmerk auf Tastatur und Hände richtet.\n\nAuch Yamahas einfach ausgestattetes New Yorker Studio und die gnadenlos vollständige Erfassung aller Auftritte, Verbeu­gun­gen sowie der bei jedem Beifall automatische Schwenk auf das kleine (freundlich-neutral reagierende) Publikum dürften auf einen durch die moderne Luxusoptik verwöhnten Konsumenten von heute nicht sonderlich einladend wirken. Ernsthaft Musik­interessierte, vor allem Pianisten und solche, die es werden wollen, werden an einer derart ungeschön­ten Dokumentation meis­terlicher Konzertpianistik dagegen ihre helle Freude haben.\n\nMasterly\n\nFor some time now, Jerome Rose has been releasing major works of classical and romantic piano music in representative compilations on his own label Medici Classics. Parallel to this, he has created a similarly designed DVD-Series that has already reached Volume 6. The film shows the soon-to-be 74-year-old American in live appearances performing the great F minor Sonata and all thirty “late” piano pieces by Brahms. This is a big program that not only creates an impressive image of the composer, but that is also performed in an impressive manner by the former Serkin-pupil: secure and weighty, simple and focused, powerfully expressive, without getting lost in sentimental or ponderous side-paths, rhythmically flexible only when it serves the structural enlightenment of the music.\n\nThe realization emphasizes the absolutely serious character of Rose’s music making through camera work that is conducted, regardless of cinematically fashionable perspectives or special effects, with its main attention focused on keyboard and hands. Yamaha’s simply-appointed New York Studio and the complete coverage of all appearances, bows and short turns to the small (friendly, neutrally reacting) audience may not seem overly-exciting to some consumers that are spoiled by some luxurious modern visuals. However, serious music-lovers, especially pianists and aspiring pianists, will have real delight in this very unpretentious documentation of masterly concert pianism.\n\nGramophone - May 2012 - Written by Jed Distler\n\nOver the past few years Jerome Rose has been setting down much of his core repertoire in front of an audience at New York's Yamaha Artist Services for DVD, including works that he's recently recorded on CD. The present DVD offers two and a half hours of solo Brahms, with no less than all of the late Piano Pieces and the youthful F minor Sonata. If anything, Rose plays the latter better in 2011 than he did in his 2007 audio-only recording. The little instances of over-pedalling and of telegraphing loud climaxes have been tempered, without any residual loss of drive or passion in the first-movement development, the Scherzo's swaggering rhythms and the finale's racing coda. The Intermezzo's foreboding funeral-march rhythms are more flexible now, yet manage to sound more insistent. Rose's long-lined, tellingly shaped Andante espressivo also gains in dramatic and dynamic scope, although this may be due to the DVD's superior high-definition sound. The short pieces, too, often reveal Rose at his seasoned best.\n\nNotice Op 76 No 1's carefully contoured imitative writing; and if Nos 2 and 3 are a shade forthright and brusque, No 4's phrases effortlessly ebb and flow over the bar-lines. His assiduous hand-crossings in the Op 79 No 2 Rhapsody's main theme both sound and look effortless, while the Op 116 group stands out for Rose's poetic simplicity in No 2 and his insightful timing and voicing of No 5's strange harmonies. Interestingly, the Op 117 No 1 Intermezzo is relatively spacious and reserved in comparison with the businesslike urgency of the following B flat minor piece (perhaps it's a hair fast for Brahms's Andante non troppo, yet Rose makes it work). Op 119 features a broader, more bass-oriented reading of the C major Intermezzo than usual, an austere, granitic Rhapsody and an achingly drawn-out B minor Intermezzo. It all adds up to a meaty, enjoyable programme. Those who want the music minus the DVD's modest yet effective camerawork and Rose's bonus booklet-notes can obtain the complete audio soundtrack by itself via MP3 download.\n\nPianiste - May/June 2012 - Written by Stéphane Friédérich\n\nMedici Classics a édité plusieurs récitals du pianiste américain. Spécialiste du répertoire romantique, Jerome Rose s'est produit avec les plus grands orchestres et a gravé un catalogue de disques conséquent. Il est dommage qu'il ne soit pas invité à jouer en France. Son programme d'oeuvres de Brahms couvre plusieurs périodes d'écriture du compositeur. On admire avec quelle facilité (apparente) Jerome Rose traduit avec une belle intelligence analytique les pièces les plus denses comme la Sonate op. 5. Le son un peu mat de l'acoustique accentue la conception organique des oeuvres.\n\nMais ce qui frappe, c'est la souplesse du toucher, la clarté de l'articulation dans les Klavierstücke dont il souligne avec justesse l'indépendance des caractères. Voici des interprétations limpides, naturellement chantantes, presque distanciées.\n\nENGLISH TRANSLATION:\n\nMedici Classics has issued several recitals of this American pianist. A specialist of the romantic repertoire, Jerome Rose has performed with leading orchestras and has produced a catalog of important recordings. It's a pity he is not invited to play in France. His program of the works of Brahms covers several periods of the composer's writing. One admires how with such (apparent) ease Jerome Rose has translated with great analytical intelligence the most complex works, like the Sonata op. 5. The slightly dull acoustic accentuates the organic conception of the works.\n\nBut what strikes you is the flexibility of touch and clarity of articulation in Klavierstücke which rightly emphasizes the independence of characters. Here are interpretations that are clear, naturally singing, almost distanced.\n\nPianoNews - May/June 2012 - Written by Hans-Dieter Grünefeld\n\nJerome Rose Plays Brahms - Live in Concert - DVD and Blu-ray\n\nDie Empfehlung, achten Sie auf die Hände des Pianisten, hat beim Brahms-Programm von Jerome Rose signifikante Bedeutung. Denn die Bildregie dieser Aufnahmen „Live in Concert\" aus dem kleinen Saal der Yamaha Artist Services in New York erlaubt zu sehen, wie die Kinästhetik seiner Hände offenbar mit dem jeweiligen emotionalen Gehalt der Werke korrespondiert. Elegant bewegt Jerome Rose seine Finger über die Tasten beim „Capriccio - Un poco agitato\" der Klavierstücke op. 76, deren „Allegretto non tropo\" er zu einem Prä-Ragtime im Tzigan-Stil figuriert. Für die „Rhapsodie\" op. 79 mobilisiert er insistierende Kraft, die bei der „Ballade\" sogar zu vertikal hämmerndem Anschlag gesteigert wird. Dicht aneinander überkreuzende Hände zeigt eine Nahstudie zur stillen Leidenschaft im „Adagio\" aus den Fantasien op. 116 und in den Klavierstücken op. 119 werden filigrane Harfenklänge imaginiert. Evident wird deshalb nicht nur, wie Jerome Rose unterbewusst eigene Affinitäten physisch transponiert, sondern auch, dass er den epischen Stil etwa der Sonate f-Moll vollkommen internalisiert hat und deren expressive Facetten - impulsiv im Allegro, lyrisch im Andante, burlesk im Scherzo und mit Passion im Finale - überzeugend darstellen kann. Mit diesem Brahms-Recital breitet Jerome Rose seine fundierten Kenntnisse der romantischen Seele aus.\n\nEnglish Translation:\n\nWith this Brahms recital Jerome Rose spreads his profound knowledge of the romantic soul.\n\nThe recommendation to watch the hands of the pianist during the performance has great significance with Jerome Rose’s new Brahms recording. The camera direction of this “Live Concert” from the small hall of Yamaha Artist Services in New York allows the audience to see how the kinesthetics of his hands correspond to the emotional content of every work. With elegance, Jerome Rose moves his fingers across the keyboard in the “Capriccio – un poco agitato” of the Klavierstücke, Op. 76, and the “Allegretto non troppo” he configures into a pre-ragtime in Tzigane-style. For the Rhapsodie, Op. 79 he activates an insistent power, which even increases to vertically hammered strikes in the “Ballade”. Densely crossing hands show a close study of silent passion in the “Adagio” from the Fantasien, Op. 116 and in the Klavierstücke Op. 119 delicate harp sounds are imagined. It becomes evident that Jerome Rose not only transports his inner unconscious affinities, but also, that he totally internalizes the epic style of, for example, the Sonata in F minor and can portray its many facets – impulsive in the Allegro, lyrical in the Andante, burlesque in the Scherzo and with passion in the Finale – brilliantly. With this Brahms recital Jerome Rose spreads his profound knowledge of the romantic soul.\n\nInternational Piano - March/April 2012 - Written by Julian Haylock\n\nBrahms Piano Sonata no.3. Piano pieces opp.76, 79 & 116–119.\n\nBlu-Ray/DVD\n\nJerome Rose possesses the ideal sonority for Brahms – seductively rich-toned, with leading voices clearly delineated – yet in the F minor Sonata he reminds us that this is the thrilling brainchild of a burgeoning young genius, not a product of his portly middle age. This is particularly felt in the Andante espressivo second movement, which flows with the infatuating freshness of a youthful mountain stream, while the symphonic exuberance of the outer movements emerge as compelling, organic wholes.\n\nIn the later ‘miniatures’, Rose’s clear-sightedness allows us to experience more than usual the music’s temporal compression – these are musical worlds in which every note truly counts. There is a divine simplicity about Rose’s playing – no matter how complex and demanding Brahms’s textural writing becomes, he retains his almost impossibly relaxed finger-action, ensuring that nothing is allowed to cloud the supreme clarity of musical thought. In this respect there are fascinating parallels with Wilhelm Kempff’s sparingly-pedalled, crystalline lucidity, yet Rose evinces an inner, poetic glow that is closer in projection and feeling to Radu Lupu.\n\nMost compellingly of all, Rose refuses to be generically pigeon-holed. Where others adopt a kind of all-purpose musing intimacy in the more introspective intermezzi, Rose is always acutely sensitive to Brahms’s instructions, ensuring that op.118 no.2 is both tender and flowing, while giving extra space to the unbearably poignant Adagio that opens op.119. The excellent picture and sound quality of the DVD version becomes still more resplendent via the sublime clarity of Blu-Ray.\n\nGramophone - July 19 2011 - Written by Jed Distler\n\nIt’s another New York July, and for the first time in ages I can attend the International Keyboard Institute & Festival at the Mannes College/New School for Music auditorium on 150 West 85th Street, now in its 13th season.\n\nTraditionally, founder and artistic director Jerome Rose gives the opening recital. He did so with an all-Brahms program, and, believe me, the man has never played better. Everything is coming together for Rose now. The music emerged with multi-levelled, thoughtfully contoured textures that were full-bodied, clear and cogent, rather than notey. Every piece told a story in sweeping paragraphs and long phrases that allowed Brahms’ cross-rhythmic operations their due, moving over the bar lines yet with unflagging rhythmic incision. You heard that in the two Op 79 Rhapsodies that opened the program, in the F Minor Sonata’s craggy first movement (Rose’s effortless, hair-raising octaves at the development section’s start stunned me), in a slow movement that ebbed and flowed, and a febrile, chance-taking finale that combined Rubinstein’s élan and Katchen’s nerve. Rose gave over the concert’s second half to the Op 116 piano pieces, and fused poetry with power, pushing the Yamaha "
