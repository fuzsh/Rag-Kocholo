        "text": "ABSTRACT Title <strong>of</strong> Dissertation: BRAZIL AFTER HUMBOLDT – TRIANGULAR PERCEPTIONS AND THE COLONIAL GAZE IN NINETEENTH-CENTURY GERMAN TRAVEL NARRATIVES Cerue Kesso Diggs, Doctor <strong>of</strong> Philosophy, 2008 Dissertation directed by: Pr<strong>of</strong>essor Elke P. Frederiksen Department <strong>of</strong> <strong>German</strong>ic Studies School <strong>of</strong> Languages, Literatures, and Cultures This project is a study <strong>of</strong> nine <strong>German</strong> travel narratives on Brazil written between 1803 and 1899, identifying their contribution to the discourses on <strong>German</strong> national identity in the nineteenth century. Famous <strong>German</strong> explorer and scientist Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1834) influenced travelers to explore Brazil, the part <strong>of</strong> South America that he was not able to enter for political reasons. I approach their accounts from new historicist and post/<strong>colonial</strong> perspectives. My thesis is that these narratives help construct a <strong>German</strong> national identity that occupies a fluid (<strong>colonial</strong>) position in response to diverse “Ot<strong>her</strong>s” encountered in <strong>colonial</strong> Brazil. While contributing to the study <strong>of</strong> travel literature, my dissertation contributes significantly to the field <strong>of</strong> <strong>German</strong> Cultural Studies by applying a post/<strong>colonial</strong> approach to the reading <strong>of</strong> <strong>German</strong> texts. Chapter I locates my <strong>investigation</strong> theoretically at the intersection between post/<strong>colonial</strong>ism – the critique <strong>of</strong> colonization and <strong>colonial</strong> ideology – and new historicism – the reading <strong>of</strong> texts within their historical contexts, identifying discourses by juxtaposing them with various ot<strong>her</strong> contemporary texts. Katrin Sieg’s concept <strong>of</strong> triangular thinking and Susanne <strong>Zantop</strong>’s idea <strong>of</strong> <strong>colonial</strong> fantasies are instrumental in my reading. Chapter II places my selection <strong>of</strong> travelogues in the historical contexts <strong>of</strong> nineteenth-century <strong>German</strong>y and Brazil, underscoring their paths to nationhood and changes in Wissenschaft. Chapter III shows that Alexander von Humboldt’s influence on <strong>German</strong> explorers <strong>of</strong> Brazil is more evident in the scope <strong>of</strong> their research than in their writing styles. Chapter IV interprets <strong>German</strong> travelers as surprised yet critical flâneurs in Rio de Janeiro, as skeptical listeners to the stories <strong>of</strong> <strong>German</strong> immigrants, and seekers <strong>of</strong> <strong>German</strong>ia in their responses to Brazilian women. Chapter V shows how a <strong>German</strong> understanding <strong>of</strong> ‘race’ as an ingredient <strong>of</strong> national identity colors the travelers’ anthropological observations <strong>of</strong> blacks and native populations in Brazil."
