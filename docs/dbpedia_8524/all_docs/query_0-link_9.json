        "text": "Hi,\n\nI would be very grateful of your opinion as to which book I should look into to learn German. I would like to speak really good German and not only easy German as most of the people speak...\n\nMy level is at the moment B1-B2 (...looking to improve).\n\nThanks a lot!\n\nAren\n\nIf you are talking about books specifically for learning German, i.e. textbooks, I remember using the em Brückenkurs books which would be suitable for your level of German (indeed they offer text books for a range of skill levels). A quick look on Google informs me that they're available on Amazon.\n\nIf you are talking about actual literature that you could use to pick up more German, I'd recommend reading popular English books which have been translated into German (for example Diabolus - the German version of Dan Brown's Digital Fortress ). Of course that's by no means great literature, but readable and could be useful.\n\nIf you're looking for something more challenging than that - but more effective - then I'd recommend the following German literature for a start: Short stories (such as Das Brot , Die Küchenuhr and Nachts schlafen die Ratten doch ), Wolfgang Bochert (easy to read and not intimidating because of their short lengths) Der Vorleser , Bernhard Schlink (easy to read and an interesting storyline) Liebelei , Arthur Schnitzler (includes the odd Viennese German word, but - again - not too tricky to pick up)\n\nThose are the kind of books I read and I found them interesting reads as well as instrumental in picking up new vocabulary and getting more of a 'feel' for the language. Hope that helps\n\nIt depends how good your German is and whether you are happy to read \"proper literature\" with the risk that you have to check on the vocabulary.\n\nGood reads which should improve your German would be Thomas Mann's \"Buddenbrooks\" http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddenbrooks\n\nGünther Grass is probably the most known living author in Germany. He received the literature nobel prize in 1999 - one of the most famous books he wrote is \"Die Blechtrommel\".\n\nEasier reads could be \"Der Schwarm\" (Frank Schätzing) - good german SciFi eco-thriller.\n\nAlternatively I would go for newspapers and current affairs magazines like FAZ, Der Spiegel, etc to improve your German.\n\nIt all depends on your level and whether you want to learn in class or autodidactically.\n\nLearning a language does not uniquely involve studying Grammar. If you want to speak it, then, I suggest that all of following components of learning a language are catered to: listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills. Any tutor or teacher is of valuable help here.\n\nA course book I can recommend in this case:\n\nBegegnungen (A1-B1), Schubert-Verlag. It's good interesting texts on primarily German culture.\n\nOf course you can also go about it on your own, with focus on Grammar.\n\nA Practice Grammar of German by Dreyer, Schmitt, Hueber - Verlag. It offers detailed comprehensive German Grammar. You gain insight on why this word has to on this or that position in a sentence. Mind you, it's for upper-intermediate students who want to perfection their German.\n\nFor basic Grammar I recommend Übungsgrammatik Em, Hueber-Verlag. Very insightful.\n\nOh and there's an abbreviated version of Faust. Hueber-Verlag. It's THE German classics lit. If you want to know a thing or two, you want to go for this one...\n\nThere are so many good books....It's a matter of just choosing one...\n\nI am taking private German lessons in preparation for the B2 exam. After having a look around Orel Füssli to find self study material, I selected\n\nhttp://www.amazon.de/Lehr--%C3%9Cbun...3662245&sr=1-3\n\nWhen I started my German lessons and showed her what book I had been using, she was very excited and very impressed. She said this is a standard grammar book and it's really going to teach you everything. With that said, she also mentioned that the exercises are quite dry and you'll learn more grammar than you'd ever need to know. She says as a reference book, it really is the best.\n\nThe one I linked above is an older copy, but I'm sure if you google around you can find the newest."
