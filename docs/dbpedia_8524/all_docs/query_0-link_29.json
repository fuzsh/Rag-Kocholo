        "text": "Using the list\n\nA. LISTEN\n\nListen carefully to the pronunciation of each word or phrase in the vocabulary list.\n\nB. REPEAT\n\nRepeat each word or phrase OUT LOUD several times until you remember it well and can recognize it as well as produce it. Make a list of the words in this chapter which you find difficult to pronounce. Your teacher may ask you to compare your list with other students in your class. Make sure to learn nouns with their correct gender! Beispiel: die Sprache fünf\n\nC. WRITE\n\nWrite key words from the vocabulary list so that you can spell them correctly (remember that it makes a big difference whether you cross the Atlantic by ship or by sheep). You may want to listen to the vocabulary list again and write the words as they are spoken for extra practice.\n\nD. TRANSLATION\n\nLearn the English translation of each word or phrase. Cover the German column and practice giving the German equivalent for each English word or phrase. Next cover the English column and give the translation of each.\n\nE. ASSOCIATIONS\n\nThink of word associations for each category of vocabulary. (What words, both English and German, do you associate with each word or phrase on the list?) Write down ten (10) associations with the vocabulary from the chapter. Beispiel: der Student/die Universität das Flugticket/das Flugzeug\n\nF. COGNATES\n\nWhich words are cognates? (Cognates are words which look or sound like English words.) Watch out for false friends!!! Write down several cognates and all the false friends from the chapter, create fun sentences that illustrate similarities and differences between the English and German meanings of these words. Beispiel: Nacht/night grün/green False Friends: hell = light, bright vs. Hölle = hell\n\nG. WORD FAMILIES\n\nWhich words come from word families in German that you recognize (noun, adjective, verb, adverb)? Write down as many as you find in the chapter. Beispiel: das Studium (noun; studies) der Student (noun; person) studieren (verb)\n\nH. EXERCISES\n\nWrite out three (3) „Was passt nicht?” (‘Odd one out’) exercises. List four words, three of which are related and one that does not fit the same category. Categories can be linked to meaning, grammar, gender, parts of speech (noun, verb, adjective)"
