        "text": "When you’re on holiday in a new country, you want to make the most out of every day, right?\n\nLet’s talk about the days of the week in German. The last thing that you want to do is to miss an important opportunity by muddling your days. With this basic guide, you’ll learn how to say the days of the week in German sehr schnell—very fast.\n\nFirst, let’s talk about the building blocks you’ll need to talk about the days:\n\nWoche (VOH-kuh) means week, easy to remember because of how close it is to English.\n\nTag (tahk) means day. You’ve probably already learned Guten Tag, which means good day or hello. Be careful with the pronunciation, a g at the end of a word makes a soft k sound in German.\n\nGenau? Good, now you’re ready to get started.\n\nHow to remember the German days of the week\n\nThe German days of the week each have a clear origin, and these can help you remember their names.\n\nMontag is named after the moon, Mond in German. Why does this sound familiar? Oh yes, Monday.\n\nDienstag is named for the old Germanic god Týr, god of war. The English day Tuesday also shares this namesake.\n\nMittwoch is a literal word for “mid-week”. You’ve got to love how straightforward some of the German words are!\n\nDonnerstag means “day of thunder” and is named after Donar, the god of war in old Germanic mythology. Donar is better known by his Norse name, Thor.\n\nFreitag is named for Frige, the goddess of marriage and motherhood. This is easy to remember because of its similarity to its English equivalent, Friday. Frei also means free in German, so you can think of the freedom that comes with starting the weekend.\n\nSamstag comes from the Old High German sambatztag, which means day of Sabbath or rest.\n\nInteresting fact: in northeastern Germany, you may hear the word Sonnabend used instead of Samstag. This literally means “Sunday eve” and is mainly used by older generations as youth embrace the more popular Samstag.\n\nSonntag literally means “day of the sun\", just like Sunday in English.\n\nHow to use the German days in everyday life: all your questions, answered\n\nUsing vocabulary is never just translating word for word, like it is in many language classes.\n\nUse these context and grammar tips to help you master using German days in real life.\n\nWhat gender are days of the week in German?\n\nAll days of the week in German are masculine: der Montag or ein Donnerstag, for example.\n\nBecause of this, you can use am before a day to mean occurring on that day. For example, am Sonntag means on Sunday.\n\nShould you capitalise days of the week in German?\n\nLike most German nouns, days of the week are capitalised in most cases. The only exception to this is if you are describing a habit or recurring action that you take every week on that day. In this case, the day is not capitalised and adds an 's' to become plural.\n\nFor example:\n\nIch esse freitags mit Freunden.\n\nI eat out with friends on Fridays.\n\nTo say you will eat out with friends this Friday, you would say Ich esse am Freitag mit Freunden.\n\nHow are dates written in Germany?\n\nOne important note for any Americans reading this is that Europeans write their dates out day, month, year instead of month, day, year.\n\nSo, Christmas Eve 2022 would be written 24.12.2022. instead of 12.24.2022. Just remember, the units of time go from smallest to largest.\n\nWerktage vs. Wochenende\n\nWochentage means days of the week, but it can also mean weekdays depending on the context. Each week is broken out into two parts: werktage and wochenende.\n\nWochenende literally means “week end” like its English translation. There are several ways to describe the working days of Montag bis Freitag (Monday through Friday), including unter der Woche, Arbeitstage or Werktage.\n\nMorgen Morgen?\n\nYou might have noticed that the word for morning is Morgen and the word for tomorrow is also morgen.\n\nThis isn’t a typo!\n\nIf you think about it, it makes some sense, but can still be confusing to learn. There are some subtle differences between the two words and how they are used:\n\nder Morgen (the morning)\n\nHow to use it:\n\nAm Morgen…\n\nIn the morning…\n\nmorgen (tomorrow)\n\nHow to use it: Used as a lower-case adverb to describe when something will happen.\n\nFor example:\n\nIch gehe morgen…\n\nTomorrow, I’m going…\n\ndas Morgen (tomorrow)\n\nHow to use it: Tomorrow in the sense of the future.\n\nFor example:\n\nDas Morgen ist ungeschrieben.\n\nTomorrow is unwritten.\n\nSo, how do you say tomorrow morning?\n\nIn many cases, this is redundant. You would simply say am Morgen (early morning) or am Vormittag (late morning).\n\nIf a distinction is needed, you might say Morgen früh, which means tomorrow morning or first thing in the morning.\n\nNow you know all about the German days of the week\n\nWith all this new knowledge, you’re ready to go out and book coffee dates, sign up for boat tours, and anything else that requires intimate knowledge of how to say ‘Monday’."
