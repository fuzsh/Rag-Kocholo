        "text": "Love is complicated enough but love in different languages gets even more complicated. If youâre an English-speaker romantically interested in a German-speaker, itâs a great idea to learn their language.\n\nFlirting can be tricky when language barriers and cultural differences are involved, but weâll help you to bridge these, as we walk you through some German pick up lines from sweet to silly - as well as cultural doâs and donâts when it comes to flirting with Germans.\n\nHow to say flirt in GermanÂ\n\nâTo flirtâ in German is âflirtenâ, an expression we took from English because itâs not that common. In German-speaking countries, weâre just not known to be particularly flirty people.\n\nThere are some old-fashioned terms for the practice of wooing someone though:\n\nSchÃ¤kern\n\nPoussieren\n\nTÃ¤ndelnÂ\n\nLiebÃ¤ugeln (literally: to eye someone nicely)\n\nHerausmausern (originally used for the courting of birds)\n\nHow to flirt in German with natural conversationÂ\n\nThe best way of flirting is always the one that doesnât seem like flirting. Break the ice by saying âhiâ, introducing yourself to the other person and talking about everyday topics like your hobbies or the weather. This is how a standard conversation could go.\n\nIntroducing yourself\n\nStart simple. Just say hallo and ask the other person for their name.\n\nAsking how they are, and enquiring about their welfare\n\nThen find out how theyâre doing to make sure theyâre feeling good about talking to you. Be receptive to their emotions. Only continue if theyâre also in a flirty, chatty mood.\n\nTalking about where youâre from\n\nNext up, you can tell them a little bit about yourself and get to know them, too. Ask where theyâre from and learn about their background.\n\nTalking about the weather\n\nWhenever you run out of ideas, you can always talk about the weather in German. Thatâs probably the safest and easiest conversation topic.Â\n\nBuying someone a drink\n\nIf the conversation is going really well, you can offer to buy them a drink of their choice. Just make it clear that this can also be a coffee or a fruit juice. You donât want to give the impression that youâre trying to get them drunk. Thatâs not cool in any country.Â\n\nFor some inspiration on what to try and order, check out our fresh guide on German drinks.\n\n39 pick up lines in German to use: Good, cheesy, & cringeworthy\n\nCringy German pick up lines\n\nLetâs be honest. Most pick up lines are at least a little cringy. So you can either use this as a list of what not to say, or you can use them jokingly.\n\nFunny German pick up lines\n\nThese are silly but if you can can make the other person laugh, thatâs a great start!\n\nAll out - German pick up lines\n\nIf youâve gotten to know a person a little bit, itâs nice to compliment them, preferably on their personality. Find out how you do that - in our helpful guide on German compliments.\n\nOr, if youâre ready to make a big move and go all out with your pick up line, consider one of these.\n\nCute German pick up lines\n\nSome lines can actually be quite sweet. I'd go so far as to say opening with sweet potatoes or octopuses can only be the start of a great conversation.\n\nStarting a conversation in German\n\nThese arenât exactly pick up lines but sometimes itâs best to start a conversation without revealing your intentions of hitting on the other person. So it comes in handy to have an excuse like asking them for the time.\n\nCultural tips for flirting in German-speaking countries\n\nAll the pick up lines mentioned here are pretty tame and safe to use on strangers. In the worst case scenario, the other person will walk away from you, and in the best case scenario, your pick up line was so bad that they start laughing - and humor is the best way to break the ice. Just keep a couple of things in mind before you approach someone:\n\nRead the room. Itâs often ok to approach someone at a bar or in a club if you feel like theyâre open to it, but itâs not okay to use a pick up line on a coworker, for example.Â\n\nGermans tend to take their time. Establish something like a friendship base. Then you can compliment the other person, preferably on their personality. Find out how you do that - in our helpful guide on German compliments.\n\nIf theyâre not openly flirting back right away, thereâs still hope that they might be interested in you. Flirting is usually very subtle here.\n\nAt the same time, be aware of social cues and body language. If theyâre leaning away from you or crossing their arms, you might want to give them some space. Keep in mind that even if theyâre not directly telling you no, they might just be polite.\n\nRefrain from big gestures and showing big emotions. Donât tell them âich liebe dichâ right away. Thereâs a good chance theyâll reply with a firm âtschÃ¼Ã!â\n\nDonât be like AurÃ©lie\n\nThe German band Wir Sind Helden has a hilarious song about a French girl called AurÃ©lie who comes to Germany and entirely misreads the German flirting game because sheâs used to French guys who are a lot more assertive. Sheâs just waiting to be approached and misses that the Germans do in fact like her.\n\nWir Sind Helden - AurÃ©lie (Official Video): Lyrics\n\nAurÃ©lie, die MÃ¤nner mÃ¶gen dich hier sehr\n\nSchau, auf der StraÃe schaut dir jeder hinterher\n\nDoch du merkst nichts, weil sie nicht pfeifen\n\nUnd pfeifst du selbst, die Flucht ergreifen\n\nDu musst wissen, hier ist weniger oft mehr\n\nAch, AurÃ©lie, in Deutschland braucht die Liebe Zeit\n\nHier ist man nach Tagen erst zum ersten Schritt bereit\n\nDie nÃ¤chsten Wochen wird gesprochen\n\nSich auf's GrÃ¼ndlichste berochen\n\nUnd erst dann trifft man sich irgendwo zu zweit\n\nAurÃ©lie, so klappt das nie\n\nDu erwartest viel zu viel\n\nDie Deutschen flirten sehr subtil\n\nTranslation:\n\nAurÃ©lie, the men here like you very much\n\nLook, on the street everyone is looking at you\n\nBut you don't notice because they don't whistle\n\nAnd if you whistle yourself, they run away\n\nYou should know that here less is often more\n\nOh, AurÃ©lie, in Germany love takes time\n\nHere it takes days to take the first step\n\nThe next few weeks will be spent talking\n\nWe talk and talk and talk\n\nAnd only then do we meet aloneÂ\n\nAurÃ©lie, it'll never work out like this\n\nYouâre expecting way too much\n\nThe Germans are very subtle at flirting\n\nSo what if your pick up line works?\n\nThereâs a chance one of these pick up lines or tips on how to flirt in German will actually get you someoneâs attention - and then what? Now itâs time to learn German. If âKommst du Ã¶fter her?â is all you got, the conversation will be over pretty quickly, and with it, your dream of a German romance story.Â"
