        "text": "The artists Tobias Duwe, Lars Möller and Till Warwas belong to\n\nthe group of North German Realists, which has been dedicated\n\nto the theme of painting in front of nature, plein air painting, for\n\nmore than three decades. The challenges of painting outdoors\n\nunder the northern German sky due to changing weather and\n\nlight conditions often force the artists to work quickly, resulting\n\nin a very dynamic representation of their subjects and objects.\n\nAn impasto application of paint and the dominance of clear and\n\ncontrasting colour tones often lend the paintings an impressive\n\neffect of immediacy.\n\nFor the joint exhibition „Elbwärts“ (Towards the Elbe), Duwe, Möller\n\nand Warwas have approached numerous well-known motifs along\n\nthe river, but also striking places in the Hamburg cityscape, which\n\nthey have captured with a fresh eye, artistically documenting the\n\nchanges in the city and nature. The exhibition in the Jenisch Haus\n\npresents almost 100 pictures, some of them in large format, most\n\nof which were taken especially for the exhibition and mostly plein\n\nair, and are thus on public display for the first time. Among the\n\nmotifs are views of the Elbe beach, the Jenischpark and the harbour,\n\nspecial impressions of the Schanzenviertel and the Speicherstadt\n\nas well as panoramas of the Alster and its surroundings.\n\nWith their plein air paintings, the North German Realists Tobias\n\nDuwe, Lars Möller and Till Warwas stand in the tradition of\n\ninfluential landscape painters such as Max Liebermann, Friedrich\n\nKallmorgen, Max Slevogt or Thomas Herbst, who as early as the\n\n19th century captured in paintings the then still partially undeveloped\n\nElbe slope as well as the views of the Elbe from parks and\n\nelevated paths."
