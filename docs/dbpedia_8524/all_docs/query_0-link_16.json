        "text": "Together with SPRYLAB, the international media company Ringier has relaunched its digital editions of the titles “Blick”, “SonntagsBlick” and “Blick am Abend” and optimised and made subscription management more flexible for print and digital subscribers with the Blick Online Kiosk.\n\nabo.blick.ch is the official online kiosk for buying subscriptions to the newspapers “Blick” and “SonntagsBlick”. With just a few clicks, new customers can order their subscription as a printed version in their letterbox or as an e-paper and choose the term and payment method that suits them best. Subscribers can manage their subscription themselves in the customer area, enter delivery interruptions or holiday diversions, for example, and benefit from discounts or exclusive prize draws.\n\nThe demands of newspaper readers on subscription models are usually much more demanding than those of traditional sales. Getting as close to the customer as possible and responding flexibly to their individual needs is a challenge that runs through almost all stages of today’s customer journey. Newspaper subscribers, for example, no longer want to be bound by minimum terms or cancellation periods; they want to decide for themselves when and for how long they want to read a newspaper.\n\nRingier recognised this and, as a modern newspaper publisher, wanted to create an interface between the shop system and the subscription management system in order to manage subscriptions, orders and deliveries simply, efficiently and smoothly, and to offer customers the option of managing their subscriptions flexibly with regard to delivery intervals, cancellation periods and terms.\n\nThe digital editions of all Blick titles had to be redesigned. In addition to relaunching the apps and web readers, a particular challenge was to fully automate the workflow. At the same time, the digital payment process was redeveloped and significantly simplified.\n\nIn order to ensure the smooth overall performance of the new portal and apps, all technical requirements were successfully implemented within a very tight timeframe:\n\nDevelopment of a new online kiosk using Angular, Java Spring and AWS Cloud Services\n\nLink between payment system (Data Trans) and subscription management system (SAP) using the Purple DS Entitlement Server\n\nDevelopment of new iOS and Android apps for phone & tablet as well as a new web reader for all Blick titles based on Purple DS\n\nDevelopment of an admin frontend for comprehensive campaign and customer management\n\nDevelopment of a custom storefront for app & web\n\nFully automatic generation of the mobile-optimised reading mode for e-paper\n\nUser migration\n\nSPRYLAB has completely redesigned all Blick titles digitally on the basis of the Purple DS platform. A storefront specially developed for Ringier gives the apps and the web reader the Blick-typical appearance.\n\nIn addition, SPRYLAB has developed a flexible online kiosk that makes it possible to purchase both digital and print subscriptions. By using defined interfaces and modern technologies, SPRYLAB has created a modular storefront user interface that can be easily and flexibly customised. The customer journey of the payment process has also been completely redesigned and significantly simplified.\n\nA customised admin frontend offers editors comprehensive campaign and customer management. The use of the Purple DS PDF workflow guarantees the smooth, fully automated playout of new digital editions.\n\nWith the new portal and the subscription management apps, Ringier offers its readers the flexibility they want in terms of delivery intervals, cancellation periods and terms. The overall optimised customer journey has led to a measurable increase in customer satisfaction and loyalty."
