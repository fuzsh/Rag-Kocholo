        "text": "Member of Bach family\n\n(24) (b Eisenach, ; d Leipzig, ). German composer and organist. The most important member of the family, his genius combined outstanding performing musicianship with supreme creative powers in which forceful and original inventiveness, technical mastery, and intellectual control are perfectly balanced. While it was in the former capacity, as a keyboard virtuoso, that in his lifetime he acquired an almost legendary fame, it is the latter virtues and accomplishments, as a composer, that by the end of the 18th century earned him a unique historical position. His musical language was distinctive and extraordinarily varied, drawing together and surmounting the techniques, the styles, and the general achievements of his own and earlier generations and leading on to new perspectives which later ages have received and understood in a great variety of ways.\n\nThe first authentic posthumous account of his life, with a summary catalogue of his works, was put together by his son Carl Philipp Emanuel and his pupil Johann Friedrich Agricola soon after his death and certainly before (published as Nekrolog, ). Johann Nikolaus Forkel planned a detailed Bach biography in the early 1770s and carefully collected first-hand information on Bach, chiefly from his two eldest sons; the book appeared in , by when the Bach Revival had begun and various projected collected editions of Bach’s works were under way; it continues to serve, together with the obituary and the other 18th-century documents, as the foundation of Bach biography.\n\n1. Childhood.\n\nWalter Emery, revised by Christoph Wolff\n\nThe parents of Johann Sebastian were Johann Ambrosius Bach (11) and Maria Elisabeth Lämmerhirt ( ), daughter of a furrier and town councillor in Erfurt, Valentin Lämmerhirt (d ). Another Lämmerhirt daughter became the mother of Bach’s cousin Johann Gottfried Walther, suggesting that Lämmerhirt blood was perhaps not unimportant for the musical talents of the Bach family’s greatest son. Elisabeth’s elder half-sister Hedwig Lämmerhirt was the second wife of Ambrosius Bach’s uncle, Johann Bach (4), organist of the Predigerkirche in Erfurt. Ambrosius, who had been Stadtpfeifer in Arnstadt and from violinist in the Erfurt town music, worked in Eisenach from as Hausmann (director of town music) and also as a musician at the ducal court of Saxe-Eisenach. Elisabeth and Ambrosius were married in Erfurt on April 8, and had eight children, five of whom survived infancy: Johann Sebastian, the youngest, as well as three sons (nos. 22, 71, and 23) and a daughter, Maria Salome. The date of Johann Sebastian’s birth, March 21, 1685, was carefully recorded by Walther in his Lexicon, by Sebastian himself in the family genealogy, and by his son as the co-author of the obituary. It is supported by the date of baptism (March 23; these dates are old-style) in the register of St Georg. His godfathers were Johann Georg Koch, a forestry official, and Sebastian Nagel, a Stadtpfeifer from nearby Gotha. The house of his birth no longer stands; it is not the handsome old structure (Frauenplan 21) acquired by the Neue Bachgesellschaft in as the ‘Bachhaus’ and established as a Bach Museum. He would have been born in the house in the Fleischgasse (now Lutherstrasse) that Ambrosius Bach bought in after gaining Eisenach citizenship.\n\nAfter the time of the Reformation all children in Eisenach were obliged to go to school between the ages of five and 12, and (although there is no documentary evidence of it) Sebastian must have entered one of the town’s German schools in . From he attended the Lateinschule (as had Luther, also an Eisenach boy); this offered a sound humanistic education. At Easter he was 47th in the fifth class, having been absent 96 half-days; in he lost 59 half-days, but rose to 14th and was promoted; at Easter he was 23rd in the fourth class, in spite of having lost 103 half-days (perhaps owing to illness, but probably also to the deaths of his parents). He stood one or two places above his brother Jacob, who was three years older and less frequently absent. Nothing more is known about his Eisenach career; but he is said to have been an unusually good treble and would have sung under Kantor A.C. Dedekind at St Georg, where his father was in charge of instrumental music before and after the sermon and where his relation Johann Christoph Bach (13) was the town organist.\n\nHis early musical education is matter for conjecture; presumably his father taught him the rudiments of string playing and notably the violin, Ambrosius’ primary instrument. The Stainer violin listed later among the instruments in Bach’s estate was probably an inheritance from his father. According to Emanuel, he had no formal tuition on keyboard instruments until he went to Ohrdruf. But even though he later described Johann Christoph as ‘a profound composer’, no doubt he was impressed by the latter’s organ playing and most likely received some instruction from him well before he turned ten years of age.\n\nElisabeth Bach was buried on , and on November 27, Ambrosius married Barbara Margaretha, née Keul, the daughter of a former mayor of Arnstadt. Aged 35, she had already been twice widowed. Her first husband had been a musician, Johann Günther Bach (15), and her second a pastor, Jacobus Bartholomaei (both marriages had taken place in Arnstadt), and she brought to her third marriage two little daughters, Catharina Margareta and Christina Maria, one by each of her earlier husbands. A month before Ambrosius's own second marriage, on , he and his family had celebrated the wedding of the eldest son Johann Christoph (22) in Ohrdruf. The music on that occasion was provided by Ambrosius Bach, Johann Christoph Bach (13), and Johann Pachelbel from nearby Gotha, as well as other friends and family members. This was probably the only occasion on which the then nine-year-old Sebastian met Pachelbel, his brother’s teacher. In all likelihood, Ambrosius commissioned for the occasion from his Eisenach cousin the wedding concerto “Meine Freundin, du bist schön” (text and surviving performing parts are in Ambrosius’s hands). But barely three months after re-marrying, on February 20, 1695 and two days before his 50th birthday, Ambrosius Bach died after a long and serious illness. On March 4, the widow appealed to the town council for help; but she received only her legal due, and the household broke up. Sebastian and Jacob were taken in by their elder brother Johann Christoph, organist at Ohrdruf.\n\nBoth were sent to the Lyceum. Jacob left at the age of 14 to be apprenticed to his father’s successor at Eisenach, Johann Heinrich Halle; Sebastian stayed on until , when he was nearly 15, and thus came under the influence of an exceptionally enlightened curriculum. Inspired by the educationist Comenius and directed by the reform-minded young rector Johann Christoph Kiesewetter, it embraced religion, reading, writing, arithmetic, music, history, and natural science. Sebastian entered the fourth class probably about , and was promoted to the third already in July of the same year: on he was listed first among the seven new boys and fourth in the class; on he was first, and was promoted to the second class; on he was fifth; on second, and promoted to the first class, in which he was fourth when he left the school on (new style) and went to Lüneburg. For most of his time in Ohrdruf he performed as choral scholar under the experienced Kantor Elias Herda.\n\nIn the obituary Emanuel stated that under his brother Christoph’s guidance his father ‘laid the foundations for his playing of the clavier’. He also told the story of how Christoph would not allow his brother to use a certain manuscript that contained keyboard works ‘by the most famous composers of the day – Froberger, Kerll, Pachelbel’; how Sebastian copied it by moonlight, demonstrating ‘this very passion to improve himself in music’; how the brother took the copy away from him; and how he did not recover it until Christoph died in . The manuscript has not survived but a good idea of its contents can be obtained from a comparable manuscript collection of works by Froberger, Kerll, Pachelbel, and some other composers compiled in by another Pachelbel pupil, J.V. Eckelt. Above and beyond this anecdotal information, the rapid progress made under the tutelage of his brother is documented by the so-called Weimar Tablature (discovered in ) that contains in the hand of the 13- to 14-year-old student D. Buxtehude’s most ambitious, large-scale chorale fantasia Nun freut euch lieben Christen gmein buxwv214. It provides the first reliable evidence of the unusually high level of proficiency and technical competence of the young organist and his primary choice of instrument.\n\nSt Michael’s, the late Gothic hall church where Christoph was organist, was destroyed by fire in and subsequently rebuilt. It had contained a good-sized organ that was examined by Pachelbel in , but its deficiencies were never completely remedied during Christoph’s tenure. Sebastian no doubt picked up some of his expert knowledge of organ building while helping his brother with repairs. Besides, he probably got to know the famed organ builder Georg Christoph Sterzing who maintained his workshop in Ohrdruf; Bach’s connections to Sterzing are documented into the 1730s.\n\nNo documentary evidence exists to establish when Bach started to compose, but it is reasonable to suppose that it was while he lived in Ohrdruf – not least because other contemporaries, and his own sons in due course, began composing original music well before reaching the age of 15. The earliest organ chorales in the Neumeister manuscript provide plausible examples of pieces composed before and around . They are characterized by sound craftsmanship, observance of models provided mainly by Pachelbel (his teacher’s teacher) but also by Buxtehude, and everywhere by the sense of an endeavour to break away from musical conventions and find independent solutions.\n\n2. Lüneburg.\n\nWalter Emery, revised by Christoph Wolff\n\nAccording to the school register, Sebastian left Ohrdruf on March 15, 1700 ‘ob defectum hospitiorum’ (‘for the lack of “hospitia”’); he had lost access to the free table and his brother could not take care of him without this essential support. The problem seems to have been solved by Elias Herda, Kantor at the Lyceum, who had been educated at Lüneburg. No doubt it was he who arranged for Sebastian to go north; probably he similarly helped Georg Erdmann, a fellow pupil of Sebastian’s, three years older, who left the school just before Bach (for the same reason). According to the obituary they travelled together and must have reached Lüneburg before the end of March. Both were entered in the register of the Mettenchor (Matins choir) by April 3, 1700 and probably sang in it within a matter of days for Holy Week and Easter, which fell on April 11.\n\nSt Michael’s Church in Lüneburg had two schools associated with it: a Ritteracademie for young noblemen, and the Michaelisschule for commoners. There were also two choirs: the ‘chorus symphoniacus’ of about 25 voices was led by the Mettenchor, which numbered about 15, and was limited to poor boys. Members of the Mettenchor received free schooling at the Michaelisschule, up to 1 thaler per month according to seniority, their keep, and a share in fees for weddings and other occasions (Bach’s share in has been put at 14 marks). From the arrangement of the pay-sheets it has been deduced that they were both trebles. Bach was welcomed for his unusually fine voice; but it soon broke, and (according to the obituary) he spoke and sang in octaves for eight days. After that he may or may not have sung, but no doubt he made himself useful as a keyboard accompanist or string player. As the last extant pay-sheet is that for , no details are known; but it is clear that the school was short of instrumentalists at just this time.\n\nAt school, Bach’s studies embraced orthodox Lutheranism, logic, rhetoric, Latin and Greek, arithmetic, history, geography, and German poetry. The Kantor was August Braun, whose compositions have disappeared; the organist, F.C. Morhard, was a nonentity. The organ was repaired in by J.B. Held, who had worked at Hamburg and Lübeck; he lodged in the school and may have taught Bach something about organ building. There was an exceptionally fine music library, which had been carefully kept up to date. If Braun made good use of it, Bach must have learnt a good deal from the music he had to perform; but his chief interests probably lay outside the school. At St Nicholas’s Church was J.J. Löwe ( ), distinguished but elderly. The St John’s Church was another matter, for there the organist was the renowned Georg Böhm ( ), originally from Thuringia and certainly an additional attraction for Bach’s northern journey. He apparently lost no time to connect with Böhm, for the Weimar Tablature contains an autograph copy (dated ) of J.A. Reinken’s elaborate and demanding chorale fantasia An Wasserflüssen Babylon. The fact that this piece was copied from a manuscript in Böhm’s possession, as Bach specifically indicated, suggests an early, close, and apparently lasting relationship, a proposition supported by the fact that in Bach named Böhm as his northern agent for the sale of Partitas nos. 2 and 3.\n\nBach went more than once to Hamburg, some 50 km away, most likely encouraged by Böhm who, at the time, served as harpsichordist of the Hamburg Opera, one of the directors of which was Johann Adam Reinken. He may well have visited the opera, then directed by Reinhard Keiser, whose St Mark Passion he performed during the early Weimar years and again in . He possibly also met with his cousin Johann Ernst (25), who was about this time studying in Hamburg, but he apparently was primarily interested in the city’s organ scene and in particular the organist of St Katharinen, Reincken, whose influence on the young Bach as both theorist and practitioner is difficult to overestimate. Marpurg’s familiar anecdote makes the point neatly: how Bach, returning almost penniless to Lüneburg, once rested outside an inn; how someone threw two herring heads out on the rubbish heap; how Bach – a Thuringian, to whom fish were a delicacy – picked them up to see if any portion were edible; how he found that they contained two Danish ducats, and was thus able not only to have a meal, but also ‘to undertake another and a more comfortable pilgrimage to Herr Reincken’.\n\nJ.A. Reincken ( ), organist of St Katharinen since , was a leading figure of the north German school. Böhm may have advised Bach to hear him; and his showy playing, exploiting all the resources of the organ, must have been a revelation to one brought up in the reticent tradition of the south. As for the organ itself, Bach never forgot it; in later years he described it as excellent in every way, said that the 32′ Principal was the best he had ever heard, and never tired of praising the 16′ reeds. Reincken might have given him a copy of his Hortus Musicus ( ); Bach’s reworkings of three sonatas with fugal movements from this collection (the keyboard pieces bwv954, 965, and 966) are likely to have been made relatively soon after and provided him with his first encounter with permutation fugues. In , replying to Forkel, C.P.E. Bach reported that Sebastian early on became ‘a pure and strong fuguist’ through his own efforts. Permutation fugues in the manner of Reincken played a major initial role in his practice of fugal composition.\n\nThe market-place in Lüneburg had been graced since the end of the 17th century by a palace used for the visits of the Duke of Celle-Lüneburg and his court; the principal ducal residence and seat of government lay in Celle, some 80 km to the south. The duke, married to Eléonore d’Olbreuse, a Huguenot of noble birth, was a pronounced francophile and maintained an orchestra consisting largely of Frenchmen, which played in both Celle and Lüneburg. Thomas de la Selle, dancing-master at the Ritteracademie next door to Bach’s school in Lüneburg, was also a member of the Celle orchestra. Emanuel Bach knew that his father was often able to hear this ‘famous orchestra’ and thus to become acquainted with French taste. It cannot be ruled out that Bach occasionally helped out as an instrumentalist when the court orchestra played in the ducal residence in Lüneburg.\n\nThe date of Bach’s departure from Lüneburg is not known, but we may suppose that he completed his final school year after two years and graduated at Easter . It seems unlikely that he remained in Lüneburg for any length of time after that, for he left without hearing Buxtehude and took extraordinary pains to do so in winter . He probably visited relatives in Thuringia after Easter . All that is definitely known is that in the fall of he competed successfully for the vacant post of organist at St Jacobi in Sangerhausen (the organist was buried on July 9), but the Duke of Weissenfels intervened and had Johann Augustin Kobelius, a somewhat older man, appointed in November of . Bach is next heard of at Weimar, where he was employed at the court as a musician for the first two quarters of , most likely at the instigation of, and as assistant to, the ailing court organist Johann Effler, a close friend of the Bach family. The court accounts have him down as a lackey, but he described himself as a ‘Hofmusikant’ (court musician) in the Ursprung. Bach was employed at the minor Weimar court, that of Duke Johann Ernst, younger brother of the Duke Wilhelm Ernst whom Bach served from .\n\nOf the musicians with whom Bach now became associated, three are worth mentioning. Georg Christoph Strattner ( ), a tenor, became vice-Kapellmeister in , and composed in a post-Schütz style. Johann Paul von Westhoff ( ) was a fine violinist and had travelled widely, apparently as a diplomat, and is said to have been the first to compose suites for unaccompanied violin ( ). Johann Effler ( ) was the court organist: he had held posts at Gehren as successor to Johann Michael Bach (14) and Erfurt (where Pachelbel was his successor) before coming in to Weimar, where about he moved to the court. A sickly man by the early 1700s, he may have needed to hand over some of his duties to Bach, and probably did something of the kind, for a document of at Arnstadt, where Bach next moved, describes Bach as court organist at Weimar – a post that was not officially his until .\n\n3. Arnstadt.\n\nWalter Emery, revised by Christoph Wolff\n\nThe Bonifaciuskirche at Arnstadt had burnt down in and was subsequently rebuilt in ; it then became known as the Neue Kirche, and so remained until , when it was renamed after Bach. In J.F. Wender contracted to build an organ, which by the end of had become usable; on Andreas Börner was formally appointed organist. The organ was complete by , and was examined before July 3; there were more examiners than one, but only Bach was named and paid, and it was he who ‘played the organ for the first time’. The result was that on August 9 the Arnstadt burgomeister Martin Feldhaus, who – as brother-in-law of Johann Michael Bach (14) – had personally supervised the work of the organ builder, offered Bach the post over Börner’s head; at the same time, ‘to prevent any such “collisions” as are to be feared’, Börner was given other work. Bach accepted the post ‘by handshake’ on . The exact date of his move to Arnstadt is not known, nor is his address. As his last board and lodging allowance was paid to Feldhaus, he probably spent at least that year in either the Golden Crown or the Steinhaus, both of which belonged to Feldhaus. Considering his young age, and local standards, he was well paid; and his duties, as specified in his contract, were light. Normally, he was required at the church only for two hours on Sunday morning, for a service on Monday, and for two hours on Thursday morning; and he had only to accompany hymns. He thus had plenty of time for composition and organ playing, and he took as his models Bruhns, Reincken, Buxtehude (all northerners), and certain good French organists. There is also circumstantial evidence (see below, Geyersbach affair) that he took part in musical activities of the small Arnstadt court capelle of the counts of Schwarzburg.\n\nBach was in no position to put on elaborate music at Arnstadt. The Neue Kirche, like the other churches, drew performers from two groups of schoolboys and senior students. Only one of these groups was capable of singing cantatas; it was supposed to go to the Neue Kirche monthly in the summer, but there does not appear to have been a duty roster. The performers naturally tended to go to the churches that had an established tradition and friendly organists; and Bach had no authority to prevent this, for he was not a schoolmaster and was younger than many of the students. Further, he never had much patience with the semi-competent, and was apt to alienate them by making offensive remarks. One result was his scuffle with the student J.H. Geyersbach (b ). On , on his way home from the castle, he and his cousin Barbara, elder sister (aged 26) to his future wife, fell in with six students who had been to a christening feast; one of these was Geyersbach, who asked why Bach had insulted him (or his bassoon), and struck him in the face with a stick. Bach apparently was wearing his court uniform and drew his sword, but another student separated them. Bach complained to the consistory that it would be unsafe for him to go about the streets if Geyersbach were not punished, and an inquiry was held. The consistory told Bach that he ought not to have insulted Geyersbach and should try to live peaceably with the students; further, he was not (as he claimed) responsible only for the chorales but was expected to help with all kinds of music. Bach replied that if a music director were appointed, he would be willing enough.\n\nBach, unimpressed, asked for four weeks’ leave, and set off for Lübeck – ‘what is more, on foot’, says the obituary, adding that he had an overwhelming desire to hear Buxtehude. Dates and distance cast some doubts on his straightforwardness. He left Arnstadt about October 18, and was therefore due to be back, or well on his way back, by about November 15; he would thus have been unable to hear even the first of Buxtehude’s special services, which were given on various dates from November 15 to December 20 and in included the two oratorios Castrum doloris and Templus honoris buxwv 134–5. It is conceivable that Bach was not merely a member of the audience but likely a participant in the large ensemble Buxtehude assembled for the two major works; after all, he had to finance his extended trip and pay his Arnstadt substitute. Perhaps, like Mattheson and Handel before him, he also went to see if there was any chance of succeeding Buxtehude, and was put off by the prospect of marrying Buxtehude’s daughter, aged 30; in any case, by there was a rival in the field. However that may be, he stayed almost three months at Lübeck, and was absent altogether for about 16 weeks, not returning to Arnstadt until shortly before , when he communicated.\n\nOn February 21 the consistory asked Bach why he had been away for so long; his replies were deemed unsatisfactory and barely civil. They next complained that his accompaniments to chorales were too elaborate for congregational singing, and that he still refused to collaborate with the students in producing cantatas; further, they could not provide a Kapellmeister for him, and if he continued to refuse they would have to find someone more amenable. Bach repeated his demand for a music director, and was ordered to apologize within eight days. From the next case that the consistory heard that day it seems that there had been actual ‘disordres’ in the church between Bach and the students. There is no evidence that Bach apologized, and the consistory dropped the matter for eight months. They brought it up again on November 11, 1706, and Bach undertook to answer them in writing. They also accused him of inviting a ‘stranger maiden’ to make music in the church, but for this he had obtained the parson’s permission. The woman singer in question cannot have been his cousin and future wife, for she had long been resident in Arnstadt and therefore would unlikely have been described as a stranger.\n\nNeither Bach nor the consistory took further action; no doubt they saw that the problem would soon solve itself. Probably Bach had come back from Lübeck with exalted ideas about church music, requiring facilities that Arnstadt could not provide. His ability was becoming known; on November 28 he helped to examine an organ at Langewiesen. Forkel said that various posts were offered to him; and with the death of Johann Georg Ahle, on December 2, a sufficiently attractive vacancy seemed to have arisen.\n\n4. Mühlhausen.\n\nWalter Emery, revised by Christoph Wolff\n\nAhle had been a city councillor of the Free Imperial City of Mühlhausen, organist of St Blasius, and a composer of lesser rank than his father Johann Rudolf Ahle, also of Mühlhausen. Musical standards had fallen during his tenure of office, but the post was a respectable one and various candidates gave trial performances. One was to have been Johann Gottfried Walther, the future lexicographer; he sent in two compositions for February 27, 1707 (Sexagesima) but withdrew after being told privately that he had no hope. Bach’s candidacy was promoted in particular by the organ builder Wender of Mühlhausen. He played at Easter (April 24) and probably performed Cantata bwv4. At the city council meeting on May 24 no other name was considered, and on June 14 Bach was interviewed. He asked for the same salary that he was receiving at Arnstadt (some 20 gulden more than Ahle’s); the councillors agreed, and a contract was signed on June 15. At Arnstadt his success became known; his cousin Johann Ernst (25) and his predecessor Börner applied for the Neue Kirche on June 22 and 23. He resigned formally on June 29, and presumably moved to Mühlhausen within a few days. Bach’s responsibilities in Mühlhausen also included the Brückenhof Church of the convent of Augustinian nuns where there was an organ by Wender without pedals; his principal duty there was to play for weekly and special services, alternating with the organist of the Marienkirche.\n\nOn Tobias Lämmerhirt, Bach’s maternal uncle, died at Erfurt. He left Bach 50 gulden, more than half his salary, and thus facilitated his marriage to Maria Barbara (b ), daughter of Johann Michael Bach (14) and Catharina Wedemann. The wedding took place on October 17 at Dornheim, a village near Arnstadt; the pastor, J.L. Stauber ( ), was a friend of the family and himself married Regina Wedemann on . Pupils began to come to Bach at about this time, or perhaps even earlier. Johann Martin Schubart ( ) is said to have been with him from , and Johann Caspar Vogler ( ) to have arrived at the age of ten (at Arnstadt), to have left for a time, and to have returned from about until . These two became his immediate successors at Weimar; from their time onward he was never without pupils.\n\nSometime in , he was commissioned to compose Cantata bwv150 in honor of the Mühlhausen town councillor Dr. Conrad Meckbach, possibly on the occasion of the latter’s 70th birthday on April 19. It was probably in the fall of the same year that Bach wrote Cantata bwv131; this was clearly intended for a penitential service, perhaps connected with a disastrous town fire of May 30. It was not Bach’s own Pastor Frohne who commissioned this cantata, but Pastor Eilmar of the Marienkirche – a fact whose possible significance will be seen later. On February 4, 1708 the annual change of council took place, and Cantata bwv71 was performed at the Marienkirche (with a repeat-performance at St Blasius one week later). It must have made an impression, for the council printed not only the libretto, as was usual, but also the music. Bach next drew up a plan for repairing and enlarging the St Blasius organ; the council considered this on February 21 and decided to act on it. Cantata bwv196 may have been written for Stauber’s wedding on June 5, if not his own in the previous year. At about this time Bach played before the reigning Duke of Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst, who offered him Effler’s post at his court. On June 25 Bach wrote to the council asking them to accept his resignation.\n\nNo doubt the larger salary at Weimar was an attraction, particularly as Bach’s wife was pregnant. But it is clear, even from his tactful letter to the Mühlhausen councillors who had treated him well, that there were other reasons for leaving. He said that he had encouraged ‘well-regulated church music’ not only in his own church, but also in the surrounding villages, where the harmony was often ‘better than that cultivated here’. He had also gone to some expense to collect ‘the choicest sacred music’. But in all this, members of his own congregation had opposed him, and were not likely to stop. Some people no doubt disliked the type of music that he was trying to introduce. Further, Pastor Frohne may have distrusted his organist; an active Pietist, he was at daggers drawn with the orthodox Pastor Eilmar of the Marienkirche – Bach had begun his Mühlhausen career by working with Eilmar, the librettist of bwv131; they had become intimate enough for Eilmar and his daughter to be godparents to Bach’s first two children.\n\nThe council considered Bach’s letter on June 26 and reluctantly let him go, asking him only to supervise the organ building at St Blasius. However badly Bach may have got on with his congregation, he was evidently on good terms with the council. They paid him to return and perform a cantata at the council service in as well as in (all trace of these works is lost). In he negotiated on friendly terms with the new council on behalf of his son Johann Gottfried Bernhard (47). He is not known to have been paid for supervising or opening the St Blasius organ, but he may have done so.\n\n5. Weimar.\n\nWalter Emery, revised by Christoph Wolff\n\nWhen he announced his resignation from Mühlhausen after a tenure of only 11 months, Bach said that he had been appointed to the Duke of Weimar’s ‘Capelle und Kammermusik’. However, Weimar documents show that on , when his ‘reception money’ was paid over, he was called ‘the newly appointed court organist’, and that he was almost always so called until , when he became Konzertmeister as well. Effler, who most likely had engineered his succession, was pensioned off on full salary (130 florins); on he received a small gift as ‘an old sick servant’, and he died at Jena on .\n\nBach reportedly wrote most of his organ works at Weimar, and the duke took pleasure in his playing. His salary was from the outset larger than Effler’s (150 florins, plus some allowances); it was increased to 200 from Michaelmas , 215 from , and 250 on his promotion in . On it was ordered that his share of casual fees was to be the same as the Kapellmeister’s. Moreover, he seems to have had a fair amount of spare time, in which, for instance, to cultivate the acquaintance of Telemann while the latter was at the neighbouring court of Eisenach ( ). Together with the violinist Pisendel he copied a concerto in G of Telemann’s (twv52: G2), probably during Pisendel’s visit to Weimar in .\n\nSix of Bach’s children were born at Weimar: Catharina (bap. ; d ); Wilhelm Friedemann (45) (b ); twins (b ; both died in a few days); Carl Philipp Emanuel (46) (b ); and Johann Gottfried Bernhard (47) (b ). The various godparents show that Bach and his wife kept in touch with relations and friends from Ohrdruf, Arnstadt, and Mühlhausen, besides making fresh contacts at Weimar; it is noteworthy that Telemann was godfather to Emanuel and apparently was present at his baptism in March of .\n\nOn Bach, his wife, and her older sister Friedelena (who died at Leipzig in ) were living at the house of Adam Immanuel Weldig, a falsettist and Master of the Pages. They probably stayed there until , when Weldig gave up his house, having secured a similar post at Weissenfels. Like Telemann, Weldig was godfather to Emanuel; Bach (by proxy) to a son of Weldig’s in . Weldig’s house was destroyed in ; where Bach lived before and after the given dates is not known.\n\nSince , Johann Gottfried Walther (the lexicographer) had been organist of the Stadtkirche; he was related to Bach through his mother, a Lämmerhirt, and the two became friendly. On Bach stood godfather to Walther’s son. Forkel told a story of how Walther played a trick on Bach, to cure him of boasting that there was nothing he could not read at sight. Their relations remained close; Bach later served as the Leipzig sales agent for the Musicalisches Lexicon ( ), in he negotiated on Walther’s behalf with the Leipzig publisher J.G. Krügner, and Walther’s references to Bach in his letters to Bokemeyer carry further evidence of their friendship. From one such letter it seems that during his nine years at Weimar Bach gave Walther some 200 pieces of music, some by Buxtehude, others compositions of his own.\n\nOf Bach’s pupils, Schubart and Vogler have already been mentioned. Other private students include the page Adam Friedrich Wilhelm von Jagemann who took keyboard lessons in 1711/12. Johann Gotthilf Ziegler ( ) matriculated at the University of Halle on , but before that he had studied with Bach for a year or so, and had been taught to play chorales ‘not just superficially, but according to the sense of the words’; Bach’s wife stood godmother to his daughter in , and in Bach employed him as agent, in Halle, for Partitas nos. 2 and 3. P.D. Kräuter of Augsburg ( ) set out for Weimar in , and stayed until about . Johann Lorenz Bach (38) probably arrived in autumn ; he may have left Weimar by . Johann Tobias Krebs ( ) studied with Walther from , with Bach from about until . Johann Bernhard Bach (41) worked with his uncle from about until at least , alongside Samuel Gmelin ( ), who appears to have left in . Cornelius Heinrich Dretzel of Nuremberg ( ) may have been briefly with Bach as well.\n\nThe specification of the organ in the castle chapel, published in , does not represent the organ that Bach left in . Extensive alterations were made in . Still less does the specification represent the organ that Bach was faced with in , for he himself made even more extensive alterations in . The organ is said to have been built by Compenius in . It was overhauled in , and a Sub-Bass added, by J.C. Weishaupt, who carried out further maintenance work in . A contract for alterations had however been signed on with Heinrich Nikolaus Trebs ( ), a Wender pupil, who had moved from Mühlhausen to Weimar in . Bach and he had worked together on a new organ at Taubach in , opened by Bach on ; in he gave Trebs a handsome testimonial, and in he and Walther became godfathers to Trebs’s son. Bach and Trebs collaborated again about , over an organ at Bad Berka. Trebs’s new organ was usable during ; he had done 14 days’ tuning by May 19 and was paid off on September 15. Of this rebuild nothing is known, except that either Bach or the duke was determined that the instrument include a Glockenspiel; great trouble was taken over obtaining bells from dealers in Nuremberg and Leipzig, and it seems that the original set of 29 (a number hard to account for) had to be replaced because of difficulties over blend and pitch. In the organ had a Glockenspiel on the Oberwerk.\n\nIn and Bach was paid for repairing harpsichords in the household of the junior duke, Ernst August and Prince Johann Ernst. On he was godfather to a daughter of J.C. Becker, a local burgher. From Bach was lodged in the castle at Weissenfels. Duke Christian’s birthday fell on February 23, and Cantata bwv208 was written for this occasion, and re-performed later at the Weimar court (see below). In October 1713 Bach composed the strophic aria bwv1127 on a German poem based on Duke Wilhelm Ernst’s motto ‘Omnia cum Deo and nil sine eo’ and written for his 51st birthday. About the young prince Johann Ernst, an active composer who had studied with both Walther and Bach, returned from a grand tour, apparently with a good deal of music, for in the year from June 1 there were bills for binding, copying, and shelving (some of the music came from Halle). In he had been in Amsterdam and may have met the blind organist J.J. de Graff who was in the habit of playing recent Italian concertos as keyboard solos. This may have given rise to the numerous concerto arrangements made by Walther and Bach, but they both may have been exposed to Italian (and French) music prior to via the Halle and Leipzig bookseller A. C. Sellius, an agent for E. Roger in Amsterdam.\n\nOn Bach was probably at Ohrdruf, standing godfather to a nephew; and on November 6 he took part in the dedication of the new Jakobskirche at Weimar (there is no evidence that he composed any of the music). On November 27 he was at Weimar, as godfather to Trebs’s son. At about this time he seems to have gone to Halle, perhaps to buy music, and to have become accidentally involved with the authorities of the Liebfrauenkirche. The organist there (Zachow, Handel’s teacher) had died in , and the organ was being enlarged to a three-manual of 65 stops. The story has to be pieced together from hints in an incomplete correspondence; but it looks as if the pastor, J.M. Heineccius, pressed Bach to apply for the vacant post. Bach may have been involved in planning the enlargement of the organ, when Zachow became incapacitated; at all events, he stayed in Halle from November 28 to December 15 at the church authorities’ expense. He also composed and performed a cantata (probably bwv21), attended a meeting on , was offered the post, and let the committee suppose that he had accepted it, although he had not had time to find out what his casual fees would amount to. On December 14 they sent him a formal contract. Bach replied on , saying cautiously that he had not been released from Weimar, was uneasy about his salary and duties, and would write again within the week. Whether he did so is not known; but in February the committee resolved to tell him that his salary was not likely to be increased. Thus, at Halle he could expect a slightly smaller salary than he was already getting; the attraction was the organ, more than twice as large. Bach must then have approached the duke, for on March 2, ‘at his most humble request’, he became Konzertmeister (ranking after the vice-Kapellmeister), with a basic salary of 250 florins from February 25. In finally refusing the Halle post, he probably mentioned that figure, for the committee accused him of having used their offer as a lever to extract more money from the duke. This he denied on March 19, in a letter so reasonable and so obviously honest that he remained on good terms with Halle and was employed there as an organ examiner in . Gottfried Kirchhoff had meanwhile been appointed organist on .\n\nFew cantatas (apart from the secular bwv208) can be ascribed to the early Weimar years. bwv18, 21, 54, and 199 appear to date from about and clearly have no specific connection with the cantatas composed with an eye to the church calendar from onwards. On it was ordered, at the request of the new Konzertmeister, that cantatas should in future be rehearsed in the court chapel, not at the Kapellmeister’s home or in other lodgings; and on Palm Sunday, March 25, Bach performed bwv182. This was the fourth Sunday after his appointment as Konzertmeister, when he had become responsible for writing a cantata every four weeks. As he evidently hoped to complete an annual cycle in four years, he did not keep strictly to this rule; having written a cantata for Advent Sunday in (bwv61), he wrote for the 23rd Sunday after Trinity in (bwv163) and the second Sunday in Advent in (bwv70.1); in he no longer wrote canatas for the court chapel. Apart from such intentional irregularities, there are gaps in the series, and the strange thing is that these gaps became more numerous after the end of . One of the gaps is accounted for by the death at Frankfurt on of the musically gifted Prince Johann Ernst, plunging the duchy into mourning from August 11 to , when not a note of music might be played. From there are no cantatas at all. A tentative explanation will be suggested for this; but it is hard to see why Bach’s usual allowance of paper was paid for on when he is known to have performed church cantatas not monthly, but only sporadically, after January 19. Most likely, however, he wrote the funeral music bwv1142 for Prince Johann Ernst on April 2, 1716. On the high feast days, the ducal family attended the main service at Sts Peter and Paul Church in the city of Weimar. There was more space for a larger performing ensemble such as required for bwv172 (Pentecost ), bwv63 (Christmas ), and bwv31 (Easter ).\n\nOn Bach, like the librettist Salomo Franck and ‘the book-printer’, was paid for ‘Carmina’, bound in green taffeta, that had been ‘presented’ on some unspecified occasion – perhaps on January 24 when Duke Ernst August had married Eleonore, sister of the Prince of Cöthen. Ernst’s birthday was celebrated in April; two horn players from Weissenfels came to Weimar, probably brought over for a repeat performance of bwv208. Meanwhile, the new organ at Halle had been making progress, and on April 17 the council resolved that Bach, Kuhnau of Leipzig, and Rolle of Quedlinburg should be invited to examine it on April 29. They all accepted; each was to receive 16 thaler, plus food and travelling expenses. The examination began at 7 a.m. and lasted three days – until sometime on May 1, when the experts wrote their report, a sermon was preached, and fine music performed; there followed a tremendous banquet given by the town council. On May 2 the organist and the three examiners met the builder to discuss details.\n\nOn Bach and an Arnstadt organ builder signed a testimonial for Johann Georg Schröter, who had built an organ at Erfurt. In Bach was mentioned in print for the first time: in the preface to Mattheson’s Das beschützte Orchestre, dated February 21, Mattheson referred to Bach as ‘the famous Weimar organist’ saying that his works, both for the church and for keyboard, led one to rate him highly, and asked for biographical information that Bach never provided.\n\nIt is against this background that Bach’s departure from Weimar has to be considered. In he had been employed by Duke Johann Ernst; since his return in , by Duke Wilhelm Ernst, Johann’s elder brother. The brothers had been on bad terms, and when Johann Ernst died in and his son Ernst August came of age in , things became no better. For some time, the ducal disagreements do not seem to have affected Bach; perhaps they were kept within bounds by Superintendent Lairitz, and Ernst August’s younger half-brother (Johann Ernst, the composer) may have had some influence. But the latter died in , Lairitz on , and the new superintendent certainly failed to cope with the ‘court difficulties’; like the rest of Wilhelm’s household, he was forbidden to associate with August. The musicians, though paid by both households, were threatened with fines of 10 thaler if they served August in any way.\n\nIt seems unlikely that the cantata gaps in and the total lack of cantatas for were due to casual losses. It is tempting to suppose, however, that Bach found his position increasingly embarrassing (owing to his early connection with the junior court) and expressed disapproval of Duke Wilhelm’s behaviour by evading his own responsibilities. In fact, Bach does not seem to have disapproved of the duke’s behaviour until he discovered that a new Kapellmeister was being sought elsewhere. Drese senior died on ; his son, the vice-Kapellmeister, was by all accounts a nonentity. Bach produced bwv70.1 for December 6 and completed only the first movement of bwv186 for December 20, but there were no more cantatas to follow, as far as is known. By Christmas , Bach may have found out that the duke was angling for Telemann. Negotiations with Telemann came to nothing; but apparently Bach now set about looking for a post as Kapellmeister. He was offered one by Prince Leopold of Cöthen, brother-in-law to Duke Ernst August (Bach and the prince had probably met at August’s wedding in ) and the appointment was confirmed on . No doubt Bach then asked Duke Wilhelm’s permission to leave, and no doubt he was refused – the duke being annoyed because his nephew had obviously had a hand in finding Bach a job that carried more prestige and, at 400 thaler, was better paid.\n\nThe duke and Bach must nevertheless have remained on reasonable terms for the time being, for at some date hardly earlier than the end of September Bach was in Dresden and free to challenge the resident French keyboard virtuoso Louis Marchand. Versions of this affair differ, but according to Birnbaum (who wrote in under Bach’s eye), Bach ‘found himself’ at Dresden, and was not sent for by ‘special coach’. Once there, some court official persuaded him to challenge Marchand to a contest at the harpsichord; the idea that they were to compete at the organ seems to have crept in later. Whatever may be the truth about these and other details, it is universally agreed that Marchand ran away.\n\nOn his birthday, , Duke Wilhelm set up an endowment for his court musicians; and the second centenary of the Reformation was celebrated from October 31 to November 2. Presumably Bach took part in these ceremonies, though there is no evidence that he set any of the librettos that Franck had provided. Emboldened, perhaps, by the Marchand affair, he then demanded his release in such terms that the duke had him imprisoned from November 6 until his dismissal in disgrace on December 2. The Cöthen court had paid Bach an advance of 50 thaler on August 7 and ‘the newly arrived Kapellmeister’ received his first salary on December 29, suggesting that Bach and his family left Weimar for Cöthen only after Christmas and just in time for the traditional New Year’s festivities at the Cöthen court. His duties in Cöthen began on January 1, 1718 with the traditional congratulatory music for the princely family. However, he was in Leipzig on December 16–18 examining the new organ at the university church (Paulinerkirche). The three-manual instrument with 48 stops was the largest in Saxony at the time and was built by Johann Scheibe, with whom Bach later collaborated and whose son he was later in dispute with. He may have returned from Leipzig to Weimar for Christmas, performing his final service for the ducal court, but his post of Konzertmeister disappeared after he left. The younger Drese had become Kapellmeister in his father’s place and Bach’s pupil J.M. Schubart took the post of court organist.\n\n6. Cöthen.\n\nWalter Emery, revised by Christoph Wolff\n\nExcept during the few last months of his Weimar period, Bach had been on good terms with Duke Wilhelm; but his relations with that martinet must always have been official. At the princely court of Anhalt-Cöthen, until the end of , things were different; Prince Leopold was a young man who, as Bach himself said, loved and understood music. He was born in , of a Calvinist father and a Lutheran mother. The father died in , the mother ruled until Leopold came of age on . There was no court orchestra until , when Leopold persuaded his mother to take on three musicians. While studying in Berlin in , he met the bass singer and composer Augustin Reinhard Stricker (1675–1720); from the end of he was on the usual grand tour, during which he studied with Johann David Heinichen at Rome. He returned capable of singing bass, and of playing the violin, viola da gamba, and harpsichord. The Berlin court orchestra had broken up in , and from he employed Stricker as Kapellmeister and his wife as soprano and lutenist; by he had 18 musicians. However, by Stricker and his wife seem to have resigned, leaving the prince free to appoint Bach.\n\nThe late-medieval St Jacob Cathedral in Cöthen was Calvinist and had an organist, but elaborate music was rarely performed there. The two-manual organ built in 1674–6 by Z. and A. Thayssner had 25 stops. The court chapel in the castle had a small organ of unknown specifications. The newly built Lutheran St Agnus Church (completed in ) had a two-manual organ of 27 stops by J.H. Müller (1707–8). Bach probably used the St Agnus and St Jacob organs for teaching and private practice. He communicated at St Agnus and took part in the baptisms at the court chapel but had no official duties in either. He may, however, have been involved in the affair of , when a cantata was put on for the dedication festival of St Agnus, and 150 copies of (presumably) the libretto were printed. The printer’s bill for one thaler and eight groschen was endorsed by the pastor: ‘The churchwardens can give him 16 groschen; if he wants more, he must go to those who gave the order’.\n\nBach’s basic salary, 400 thaler, was twice Stricker’s, and extra allowances made it up to about 450. Only one court official was paid more, and there is other evidence that Bach was held in high esteem. On the last of his children by his first wife (a short-lived son) was named after the prince, who himself was a godfather. Bach’s residence in Cöthen is not definitely known, but it seems likely that he began as a tenant in Stiftstrasse 11; in , when that house was bought by the prince’s mother for the use of the Lutheran pastor, he moved to Holzmarkt 10. The orchestra needed a room for their weekly rehearsals; the prince supplied it by paying rent to Bach (12 thaler a year) as well as a regular sum for the maintenance of a harpsichord.\n\nBach’s official functions at the court were comparatively light since they involved no weekly church music. The regular major duties were congratulatory cantata or serenata performances for New Year’s Day and the prince’s birthday on December 10, and occasionally for other special occasions in honor of the princely family. His double title of “Kapellmeister and Director of Chamber Music” indicates his responsibility for chamber music performances throughout the year. Some extant printed texts help to identify the occasion for the works, but the music has survived for only a few of the relevant dates: bwv66.1 (December 10, 1718), bwv134.1 (January 1, 1719), and bwv173.1 (December 10, 1722). bwv184.1 was performed on New Year’s Day in either or in 1721–3, and bwv194.1 on an unknown occasion sometime between and . Only texts have survived for bwv1150–53. In there may have been no birthday celebrations, for the prince was married, at Bernburg, the next day. There is, however, no evidence for the performance of a wedding piece. After Bach had moved to Leipzig, bwv36.2 was performed on November 30, for the birthday of the prince’s second wife.\n\nOn May 9, 1718 the prince went to drink the waters at Carlsbad for about five weeks, taking with him Bach, five other musicians, and a harpsichord. The upper nobility from all over Europe used to spend their summer vacation at this famous spa in Bohemia, but it is not known whom the Cöthen musicians entertained. Early in Bach was in Berlin, negotiating for a new harpsichord. About this time he seems to have been busy composing or buying music, for between July 1719 and May 1720 some 26 thaler were spent on binding. During Handel visited his mother at Halle, only some 30 km away; Bach tried, but failed, to make contact with him. He also disregarded a renewed request from Mattheson for biographical material.\n\nIn January 1720 Bach stood godfather to the daughter of the Cöthen viola da gamba player C.F. Abel. W.F. Bach was nine in December 1719; the title page of his Clavier-Büchlein is dated January 22, 1720; it contained among other works early versions of 11 preludes from Das wohltemperiete Klavier and the composing scores of the two-part preambles (inventions) and three-part fantasias (sinfonias). In May Bach again went to Carlsbad with the prince for another extended stay. He used these leisurely weeks for making a fair copy of his sonatas and partitas for solo violin, by far the most calligraphic of all his surviving musical autographs. The date of his return to Cöthen does not seem to have been recorded; but apparently it was after July 7, for that was the date of Maria Barbara’s funeral, and there is no reason to doubt Emanuel’s story that his father returned to find her dead and already buried. The death of his nearly 36-year old wife may well have unsettled Bach, and even led him to think of returning to the service of the church. But there was a more practical reason for his taking an interest in St Jacobi at Hamburg. The organist there, Heinrich Friese, died on ; Bach had known Hamburg in his youth, and must have been attracted by the organ, a four-manual Schnitger with 60 stops. There is no evidence that he was actually invited to apply for the post; but he may well have made inquiries of his own.\n\nAt all events, his name was one of eight being considered on November 21, and he was in Hamburg at that time but had to leave on November 23. A competition was arranged for November 28, five days after Bach had had to leave for Cöthen; three candidates did not appear, and the judges were not satisfied with the other four. An approach was made to Bach, and the committee met on December 12; as Bach’s reply had not arrived, they met again a week later, when they found that Bach had refused. Perhaps he was unable, or unwilling, to contribute 4000 marks to the church funds, as the successful candidate actually did.\n\nFrom the way in which the committee kept the post open for Bach, one may suppose that they had heard his recital at St Katharinen. Exactly how this performance was arranged, no-one knows; but in the obituary Emanuel stated that Bach played before Jan Adam Reincken, the magistracy, and other notables; that he played for more than two hours in all; and that he extemporized in different styles on the chorale An Wasserflüssen Babylon for almost half an hour, just as the better Hamburg organists had been accustomed to doing at Saturday Vespers. As a fantasia on this chorale was one of Reincken’s major works, this may seem a tactless choice; but the obituary makes it clear that the chorale was chosen by ‘those present’ and not by Bach himself. Reincken is reported to have said, ‘I thought this art was dead, but I see it still lives in you’, and showed Bach much courtesy. A later remark of Mattheson’s has been taken to imply that Bach also played the G minor Fugue bwv542. He also appears to have presented his Cantata bwv21, perhaps in a second concert.\n\nIn early Bach must have been preparing the Brandenburg Concertos, whose autograph full score was dedicated on March 24, 1721 to the Margrave Christian Ludwig of Brandenburg-Schwedt, brother of the first Prussian king, before whom Bach had played in Berlin while acquiring the new Cöthen harpsichord in . What he played is not known; but he was invited to send in some compositions. The margrave’s reaction to the receipt of the six works assembled for him by Bach is also not known.\n\nOne of Bach’s friends at Cöthen was the goldsmith C.H. Bähr; Bach stood godfather to one of Bähr’s sons in , and deputized for a godfather to another in . About the beginning of he gave a performance of some unspecified kind for Count Heinrich XI Reuss of Schleiz; this may have been arranged by J.S. Koch, the Kantor there, who had held a post at Mühlhausen, though possibly not in Bach’s time there. On Bach was the 65th communicant at St Agnus; one ‘Mar. Magd. Wilken’ was the 14th. This may well have been Bach’s future wife – the mistake in the first name is an easy one – but Anna Magdalena makes no formal appearance until September 25, when Bach and she were the first two among the five godparents of the son of the princely wine stewart Christian Hahn. This baptism is recorded in three registers. In two of them Anna is described as ‘princely singer’, in the third, simply as ‘musician’ (Musicantin). In September Anna was again a godmother, to a child called Palmarius; again the registers differ in describing her occupation. Her name does not appear in court accounts until summer , when she is referred to as the Kapellmeister’s wife; her salary (half Bach’s) is noted as paid for May and .\n\nPractically nothing is known of her early years. She was born on at Zeitz. Her father, Johann Caspar Wilcke, was a court trumpeter; he worked at Zeitz until about , when he moved to Weissenfels where he died on . The surname was variously spelt. Anna’s mother (Margaretha Elisabeth Liebe, d ) was daughter of an organist and sister of J.S. Liebe who, besides being a trumpeter, was organist of two churches at Zeitz from until his death in . As a trumpeter’s daughter, Anna may well have met the Bachs socially. Since the famous cantatrice Pauline Kellner (1664–1745) was active at the Weissenfels court from , it is likely that Anna Magdalena was trained by her. She was paid for singing, with her father, in the chapel at Zerbst on some occasion between Easter and midsummer . At about June 15 and not quite aged 20, she joined the Cöthen capelle at the rank of chamber musician. Her wedding with Bach (aged 36) took place on December 3. The prince saved Bach 10 thaler by giving him permission to be married in his own lodgings. At about this time Bach paid two visits to the city cellars, where he bought first one firkin of Rhine wine, and later two firkins, all at a cut price, 27 instead of 32 groschen per gallon. Probably early in , Bach gave his wife an album, the Clavier-Büchlein for Anna Magdalena Bach. 25 leaves are extant, about a third of the original manuscript. The album contains fragmentary composing scores of the French Suites and has a later replacement title-page, on which Anna Magdalena wrote the title and the date and Bach noted the titles of three theological books. It seems to have been filled by when Bach started a second album for his wife.\n\nOn the prince married his cousin Friderica Henrietta, Princess of Anhalt-Bernburg. The marriage was followed by five weeks of illuminations and other entertainments at Cöthen. This was not however an auspicious event for Bach because the prince’s second wife was ‘eine Amusa’ (someone not interested in the Muses) and probably had a somewhat negative influence on the generally happy relationship between Bach and her husband. But what certainly played a more important role in the court’s attitude toward musical affairs were the budgetary reductions beginning in and the resulting personnel reductions in the capelle. Family pressures involving the powerful princess mother Gisela Agnes and her younger son August Ludwig as well as external events forced Prince Leopold into economizing. That may have already been on the horizon when Bach explored the Hamburg situation in late .\n\nA legacy from Tobias Lämmerhirt (Bach’s maternal uncle) had facilitated Bach’s first marriage; Tobias’s widow was buried at Erfurt on , and Bach received something under her will too, though not in time for his second marriage. On Bach’s sister Maria, together with one of the Lämmerhirts, challenged the will, saying that Bach and his brothers Jacob (at Stockholm, Sweden) and Christoph (at Ohrdruf) agreed with them (Christoph had died in ). Bach heard of this only by accident; and on March 15 he wrote to the Erfurt council on behalf of Jacob as well as himself. He objected to his sister’s action and said that he and his absent brother desired no more than was due to them under the will. On April 16 Jacob died; and the matter seems to have been settled on these lines towards the end of the year. Bach’s legacy of 224 thaler amounted to more than a year’s pay.\n\nIn summer there was no Kapellmeister at the neighbouring court of Anhalt-Zerbst, and Bach was commissioned to write a birthday cantata for the prince; for this he was paid 10 thaler in April and May. The birthday was in August, and payments made during that month presumably refer to the performance of bwv1154, a lost work which was scored for two oboes d’amore and ‘other instruments’.\n\nSeveral didactic works for keyboard belong to the Cöthen period. The autograph of Das wohltemperirte Clavier (book 1 of the ‘48’) is dated on the title-page. The handsome fair copy was preceded by drafts, like those in W.F. Bach’s Clavier-Büchlein (begun in ); and some of the movements look earlier than that. Presumably Bach brought them together for convenience, partly to serve as the last step in his keyboard course, focusing on contrasting free-improvisatory and strict-imitative styles, partly to exhibit the advantages of not-quite-equal temperament (the term ‘wohltemperirt’ being borrowed from Werckmeister).\n\nStaatsbibliothek zu Berlin\n\nThe title page was almost certainly the only part of the Orgel-Büchlein (Fig. 1) that Bach wrote at the turn of while still at Cöthen, but as another educational work it is best mentioned here. It was meant to be a collection of chorale preludes, not only for the ordinary church seasons but also for occasions when such subjects as the Lord’s Prayer, or Penitence, were being emphasized. The paper is of a kind that Bach used only in Weimar. Very few items (revisions of bwv620 and 631, composition of bwv1169) date from the Leipzig period; in the rest, the writing resembles that of the cantatas of 1715–16. Of the 164 preludes Bach allowed for, he completed fewer than 50. Last in this group of works come the Auffrichtige Anleitung (‘upright instruction’) with 15 Inventions and 15 Sinfonias, whose autograph fair copy is dated ‘Cöthen, ’. Its contents had already appeared, in earlier versions and under different titles, in W.F. Bach’s Clavier-Büchlein of .\n\nThe story of Bach’s move to Leipzig begins with the death of Kuhnau, Kantor of the Thomasschule there, on . Six men (Bach not among them) initially applied for the post, among them Telemann, who was still remembered for the good work he had done at Leipzig 20 years before. He had been doing a similar job at Hamburg for about a year and was probably the most famous of German musicians actually living in Germany. One of the Kantor’s duties was to teach Latin. Telemann refused to do that; nevertheless, he was appointed on August 13. But the Hamburg authorities would not release him and offered to increase his pay; in November he declined the Leipzig post. At a meeting on November 23 Councillor Platz said that Telemann was no loss; what they needed was a Kantor to teach other subjects besides music. Of the remaining five candidates, three were invited to give trial performances; two dropped out, one because he would not teach Latin. By December 21 two Kapellmeisters newly applied, Bach and Graupner, and both were immediately invited by the town council to audition for the position. The remaining other candidates were Kauffmann of Merseburg, Schott of the Leipzig Neukirche, and Rolle of Magdeburg. Of the five candidates, Graupner was preferred; he was a reputable musician, and had studied at the Thomasschule. He successfully performed his test on with two cantatas, one before and one after the sermon. But on March 22 he too withdrew, having been offered more pay at Darmstadt. Meanwhile, Bach had auditioned on February 7, 1723 with the two cantatas bwv22 and 23. He was not an unknown in Leipzig, particularly since Kuhnau had invited him to perform bwv172 on Whitsunday at the two Leipzig main churches. Rolle and Schott were also heard, and possibly Kauffmann too, but each of them with only one cantata. On April 9, after Graupner had withdrawn, the council considered Bach, Kauffmann, and Schott. Like Telemann, none of them wished to teach Latin. Out of fear that the shortlisted candidate Bach might also be prevented by his prince from accepting the position, Councillor Platz said that as the best men could not be got, they must make do with the mediocre. But the council resolved to approach Bach, for on April 13 he obtained written permission to leave Cöthen. On April 19 he signed a curious document that reads as if he were not yet free from Cöthen but could be free within a month; like Telemann before him, he also said he was willing to pay a deputy to teach Latin. On April 22 the councillors agreed on Bach, one of them hoping that his music would not be theatrical. On May 5 he came in person to sign an agreement; on May 8 and 13 he was interviewed and sworn in by the ecclesiastical authority; on May 15 the first instalment of his salary was paid. With family and furniture, he moved to Leipzig on May 22, and performed his inaugural cantata, bwv75, at the Nikolaikirche at the opening of the school year, on May 30, the first Sunday after Trinity. On June 1, at 8.30 a.m., he was formally presented to the school.\n\nThis story has been told in some detail because it throws light on the circumstances in which Bach worked at Leipzig. To him, the Kantorate was a step downwards in the social scale, and he had little respect for his employers. The stage was set for trouble, and in due course trouble came. Councillor Platz on Telemann is curiously echoed by Councillor Stieglitz, ten days after Bach’s death: ‘The school needs a Kantor, not a Kapellmeister; though certainly he ought to understand music’. In Cöthen, Bach was not replaced and remained as titular Kapellmeister with minimal obligations at the court about 40 miles away from Leipzig, until the death of Prince Leopold in . Performances there are documented for July 1724 (with A.M. Bach), December , November 1726 (bwv36.2), , and on the occasion of the Prince’s funeral ceremonies in March 1729 (bwv1143).\n\n7. Leipzig, 1723–9.\n\nChristoph Wolff\n\nThe position of Kantor at the Thomasschule, held conjointly with that of civic director of music, had been associated with a wealth of tradition since the 16th century. Ever since the Kantorates of Seth Calvisius (1594–1615) and Johann Hermann Schein (1615–30) the institution had become the preeminent training ground for young musicians in Protestant Germany. Up to a quarter of the graduating students, who came from all over the country, ended up in musical professions. It was one of the most notable positions in German musical life both in this and in the esteem it commanded; and there can be little doubt that the general attractiveness of the position in itself played a part – very likely the decisive part – in Bach’s decision to move from Cöthen to Leipzig. His subsequent remark about the social step down from Kapellmeister to Kantor must be seen in the context of his later disagreements with the Leipzig authorities, as indeed the letter in question (to Erdmann, a friend of his youth, on ) makes unequivocally clear. In any event, Bach was not the only Kapellmeister to apply for the post. The duties were incomparably more varied and demanding than those in Cöthen or Weimar (to say nothing of Mühlhausen or Arnstadt) and more or less corresponded to those undertaken by Telemann in Hamburg. It cannot have been mere chance that Bach wanted to tackle a range of duties comparable with those of his friend. Above all he must have preferred the greater economic and political stability of a commercial metropolis governed democratically to the uncertainties of the court of an absolute prince, where personal whim often held sway. The university – the foremost in the German-speaking world at the time – must have been another special attraction in the eyes of a father of growing-up sons.\n\nMusical aptitude was a decisive factor in the selection of pupils for the Thomasschule, and it was the Kantor’s responsibility to assess and train them – altogether 55 ‘alumns’, i.e., scholarship recipients to be housed in the school’s dormitory. The alumns were joined by a substantial number of ‘external’ students from families residing in Leipzig. Their musical education was furthered by the daily singing lessons, mostly given by the Kantor. There was also instrumental instruction for the ablest pupils, which Bach had to provide free of charge but was thus enabled to make good any shortage of instrumentalists for his performances. Indeed, the number of professional musicians employed by the town (four Stadtpfeifer, three fiddlers, and one apprentice) was held throughout his period of office at the same level as had obtained during the 17th century. For further instrumentalists Bach drew on the apprentices and students of the Stadtpfeifer as well as university students. In general, the age of the Thomasschule pupils ranged between 12 and 23. Remembering that voices then broke at the age of 17 or 18, it is clear that Bach could count on solo trebles and altos who already had some ten years’ practical experience – an ideal situation, impossible in boys’ choirs today.\n\nAs far as church music was concerned, Bach’s duties centred on the principal services on Sundays and church feasts, as well as some of the more important subsidiary services, especially Vespers. In addition, he could be asked for music for weddings and funerals, for which he would receive a special fee. Such additional income was important to Bach, as his salary as Kantor of the Thomaskirche and director of music came to only 87 thaler and 12 groschen (besides allowances for wood and candles, and payments in kind, such as corn and wine). In fact, including payments from endowments and bequests as well as additional income, Bach received annually more than 700 thaler. Further, he had the use of a spacious official residence in the south wing of the Thomasschule, which had been renovated at a cost of more than 100 thaler before he moved in in . Inside the Kantor’s residence was the so-called ‘Komponirstube’ (‘composing room’), his professional office containing his personal music library and the school’s. The buildings of the old Thomasschule were, scandalously, demolished in to make room for senior minister’s quarters (today church offices). Already in the 1880s, the west façade of the Thomaskirche (originally attached to the Thomasschule) was rebuilt in the neo-Gothic style, with a significant increase of the space for the organ and choir gallery.\n\nDuring his early Leipzig years, Bach involved himself in church music with particular thoroughness and extreme energy. This activity centred on the ‘Hauptmusic’ composed for Sundays and church feasts. The performance of a polyphonic cantata, with a text related as a rule to the Gospel and/or Epistle for the day, was a tradition inherited from previous Kantors. Even so, Bach engaged on a musical enterprise without parallel in Leipzig’s musical history: in a relatively short time he composed at least three complete or nearly complete cycles of cantatas for the Church year, with about 60 cantatas in each, making a repertory of roughly 200 sacred cantatas extant today. The first two cycles were prepared immediately, for and ; the third took rather longer, being composed between and . The obituary lists a total of five annual cycles, yet it remains unclear how exactly the large body of cantatas was shelved in Bach’s office and counted after the composer’s death. The fourth cycle, to published texts by Picander, presumably dates from 1728–9, but the texts were apparently only selectively set to music; the formation and makeup of the fifth cycle proves totally elusive. The established chronology of Bach’s vocal works demonstrates that the main body of the cantatas was in existence by , and that Bach’s development of the cantata was effectively complete by . The existence of the fourth and fifth cycles has been questioned, because of their fragmentary survival compared with the almost complete survival of the first, second, and third; but until a positive argument for their non-existence can be put forward the number of five cycles, laid down in the obituary of , must stand. Compared with the high proportion of Bach’s works of other kinds that are lost (orchestral and chamber music, for instance), the disappearance of about 100 cantatas would not be exceptional. (The preservation of Bach’s works is discussed below, §11; see §III, (7), 15 for the correspondence of excess chorales in the Breitkopf collection of to the number of lost cantatas.)\n\nThe first cycle begins with the beginning of the academic school year on the first Sunday after Trinity with Cantata bwv75. It was performed ‘mit gutem applausu’ at the Nikolaikirche, followed by bwv76, for the second Sunday after Trinity, performed at the Thomaskirche. The two largest churches in Leipzig are both Gothic in style, and in Bach’s time they contained stone and wooden galleries. The choir lofts were on the west wall of the nave above the council gallery. The organs too were in the choir lofts (the ‘Schüler-Chor’): the Nikolaikirche and the Thomaskirche each had a three-manual organ with 36 and 35 stops respectively (Oberwerk, Brustwerk, Rückpositiv, Pedal). The Thomaskirche had a second organ, fitted to the east wall as a ‘swallow’s nest’, with 21 stops (Oberwerk, Brustwerk, Rückpositiv, Pedal); this fell into dilapidation and was demolished in . The organs were always played before cantata performances, during which they would provide continuo accompaniment; they were played by the respective organists at each church; during Bach’s term of office these were Christian Heinrich Gräbner (at the Thomaskirche until ), Johann Gottlieb Görner (at the Nikolaikirche until , then at the Thomaskirche), and Johann Schneider (at the Nikolaikirche from ). Bach himself, who had not held a regular appointment as an organist since his time in Weimar, directed the choir and the orchestra, and would not normally be playing the organ. However, he frequently must have directed his church ensemble from the harpsichord, as is documented for the performance of bwv198 in . At any rate, the harpsichord was often, if not regularly, employed as a continuo instrument in addition to the organ.\n\nThe cantata was an integral part of the Leipzig Lutheran liturgy. It followed immediately on the reading from the Gospel, preceding the Creed and the sermon (the second part of a two-part cantata would follow the sermon, ‘sub communione’). Apart from organ playing and the congregational singing of hymns, selected by the Kantor, the other musical constituent of the liturgy was the introit motet, which would be taken from the Florilegium Portense ( ) by Erhard Bodenschatz, a collection mainly drawn from the 16th century (Lassus, Handl etc.), and was performed a cappella with harpsichord continuo. Services began at 7 a.m. and lasted three hours; this allowed a mere half-hour for the cantata, and Bach rarely overstepped this duration. The normal performing forces consisted of about 12–16 singers and 18 instrumentalists; the precise number varied according to the work, but it was rare for the total number of singers and players to fall below 25 or to exceed 40 (the figure required on exceptional occasions, like the St Matthew Passion, which demanded two Kantoreien and double the normal number of instrumentalists). Ordinarily the performing forces under Bach’s direction consisted of four groups: pupils from the Thomasschule (the first ‘Kantorei’); the eight salaried town musicians, until headed by J.G. Reiche and thereafter by J.C. Gentzmer; University students (principally Bach’s private pupils); and additional assistants (probably regularly including one or two paid soloists) and guests. The first Kantorei alternated weekly between the two main churches, St Thomas and St Nicholas, while the other three under the direction of choir prefects provided a cappella music at the three other churches under Bach’s purview.\n\nBach took up his additional duties as music director to the university, a post traditionally held by the Thomaskantor, by August 9, 1723 when he performed the Latin Ode bwv1155 (lost) at the university’s festivities marking the birthday of Duke Friedrich II of Saxe-Gotha. The major part of his duties for the university comprised the musical provisions for the so-called quarter-day orations and the ‘old’ services in the Paulinerkirche, the University church, employing pupils from the Thomasschule and town musicians on the four major festivals of Christmas Day, Easter Day, Whit Sunday, and Reformation Day; Bach was paid 2 thaler and 6 groschen on each occasion. He carried out the most important of his civic duties for the first time on , when he introduced bwv119 as part of the annual celebration of the change of town council at the Nikolaikirche. The enormous scope of Bach’s new responsibilities, as well as his vast workload, may be gauged from the fact that the day before (14th Sunday after Trinity) bwv25 was heard for the first time, and the first performance of bwv138 (for the 15th Sunday) was soon to follow.\n\nsaw the start of Bach’s protracted wrangle with the university. In a written request for payment, he laid claim to the traditional right of the Thomaskantor to be responsible for the ‘old’ services and the quarter-day orations. The university, however, wanted to combine these duties with responsibility for the ‘new’ services (normal Sundays and holy days), which it had in entrusted to J.G. Görner, organist of the Nikolaikirche, together with the title of ‘Musik Direktor’. On September 28 Bach’s request was turned down, and he was paid only half the fee. He would not give in and turned to the Elector of Saxony in Dresden with three petitions. Following the intervention of the Dresden court, the university decided to put Görner in charge of the ‘new’ services only, and awarded Bach his traditional rights with payment as before. Thereafter, as the regular fee payments prove, Bach retained responsibility for the ‘old’ services and quarter-day orations until .\n\nOn Bach inaugurated a new organ (which he had previously appraised) in Störmthal, outside Leipzig, with bwv194. Then, from the second Sunday in Advent to the fourth, came his first break in the weekly routine of composing and performing cantatas; in Leipzig, unlike Weimar, this period was a ‘tempus clausum’, as was Lent up to and including Palm Sunday. On Christmas Day figural music returned, in a particularly splendid manner, with bwv63 and the D major Sanctus bwv238 at the main service and the Magnificat bwv243.1 at Vespers; these were Bach’s first large-scale compositions on Latin texts such as were customary in Leipzig on major feast days. At this point in the calendar his duties were unimaginably heavy, yet he carried them out with incomparable creative vigour, producing bwv40 and 64 for the feasts of St Stephen and St John the Evangelist, bwv190 for New Year, bwv153 for the Sunday after New Year ( ), bwv65 for Epiphany (January 6) and bwv154 for the following Sunday (January 9); after that, normal weekly services were resumed.\n\nDuring the next ‘tempus clausum’ Bach composed his first large-scale choral work for Leipzig, the St John Passion bwv245.1, first performed at Vespers in the Nikolaikirche on Good Friday (April 7). This Vespers service had been introduced specially for the performance of a Passion only in ; in that year Kuhnau’s St Mark Passion (now lost) had been performed. Performances alternated annually between the Thomaskirche and the Nikolaikirche, an arrangement to which Bach strictly adhered. bwv245 had several further performances, each time in a greatly altered version (see §III, (7), 14): on (in a second version adapted to the annual cycle of cantatas), probably on (in a third version), and on (fourth version); in about Bach undertook a revision of the work which remained unfinished.\n\nWith the first Sunday after Trinity (June 11) Bach began his second cycle; these were chorale cantatas. Not least because it included works composed at Weimar, the first cycle had been thoroughly heterogeneous in character, both musically and textually, but Bach gave the new cycle a unifying concept, with all the works based on texts, and their melodies, from the hymnbook. Unfortunately, this series of chorale cantatas, beginning with bwv20, O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort, and its programmatic overture, was interrupted early in after 44 weeks; Bach continued the weekly production of new works, but with non-chorale cantatas such as settings of texts by the young poet Christiane Mariane von Ziegler. In subsequent years he added to the cycle but never completed it. On June 25 he was in Gera for the dedication of the organ at the Salvatorkirche. In July he went to Cöthen with Anna Magdalena for a guest appearance as a performer; he had retained the title of Court Kapellmeister there, and it lapsed only on the death of Prince Leopold in . There is evidence of further visits to Cöthen, with Bach performing alongside his wife (who sang as a soprano), in and . During Bach started to prepare a second Clavier-Büchlein for Anna Magdalena. On he performed the Tafel-Music bwv249.1 at the Weissenfels court for the birthday of Duke Christian; this was the original version of the Easter Oratorio bwv249.3, first given at Leipzig the following April 1. bwv249 represents the beginning of a long-standing collaboration with the fluent Leipzig poet Christian Friedrich Henrici (Picander), the chief supplier of texts for Bach’s later Leipzig vocal works.\n\nBach produced congratulatory cantatas for two Leipzig University professors in May and August (bwv36.1 and 205). On September 19–20 he played the Silbermann organ at the Dresden Sophienkirche before the local court musicians (on one of the two days performing concertos, with orchestral accompaniment provided by Dresden court musicians), thus continuing his practice of giving virtuoso organ performances on concert tours – and undoubtedly in Leipzig, too, although he no longer held a post as organist. His favourite instrument in Leipzig was evidently the great organ of the Paulinerkirche built by Johann Scheibe in , with 53 stops, three manuals (Hauptwerk, Seitenwerk, and Brustwerk) and pedals; Bach had been one of its examiners in . Early in – during the third cycle, which had started in – there was an interruption of Bach’s production of cantatas, for reasons that remain obscure: between February and he performed 18 cantatas by his cousin Johann Ludwig Bach (3/72). In particular, between Purification and the fourth Sunday after Easter, he performed none of his own music at the main Sunday services; even on Good Friday he used a work by another composer, Reinhard Keiser’s St Mark Passion, which he had performed once before, in Weimar. Difficulties with performers may have been partly responsible; the instrumental forces required in J.L. Bach’s cantatas are more modest than those Bach himself normally used. Even apart from this, however, the pattern of Bach’s cantata production – as far as can be judged from the available material – changed during the third cycle; there are considerable gaps as early as the period after Trinity Sunday , and it seems that the third cycle, unlike the first two, extended over two years. In the gaps, cantatas by other composers and further performances of Bach’s own works were given.\n\nThe extended interruption of cantata production may have been – in part, if not primarily – a scheme in order to turn to other creative activities such as the composition of the St Matthew Passion and the preparation of the keyboard partitas. In fact, the fall of saw the appearance in print of Partita bwv1, under the general title of Clavier-Übung: with this Bach began his activity, later to increase in scope, as a publisher of keyboard music. Partita bwv1, published singly, was followed by nos. 2 and 3 ( ), bwv4 ( ), bwv5 ( ), and bwv6 ( or ; no copy is known). Evidently the series was originally planned to comprise seven partitas. There are early versions of nos. 3 and 6 in the second album for Anna Magdalena of . Bach sent bwv1, with a dedicatory poem, to the Cöthen court as a form of congratulation on the birth of an heir, Prince Emanuel Ludwig (born ). In , on the installation of Dr Gottlieb Kortte as university professor, Bach produced a more sizable occasional work, the dramma per musica bwv207.1.\n\nIn Bach produced two extremely important works. The St Matthew Passion, for double choir to a libretto by Picander, was performed on Good Friday (April 11; there is evidence that it was repeated in the Thomaskirche in , , and ; see §III, (7), 14). The other work was the Trauer Ode bwv198, performed in October at a memorial ceremony, planned by the university, on the death of the Electress Christiane Eberhardine, who had remained a Protestant when her husband, August the Strong of Saxony, converted to Roman Catholicism. For this Bach was commissioned to set a text by the Leipzig professor of poetry, Johann Christoph Gottsched. This became a somewhat controversial affair, as the university director of music, Görner, felt he had been slighted. Bach however retained the commission and performed the two parts of his work, ‘composed in the Italian manner’, directing it from the harpsichord, in the university church, on October 17. Between and there was a period of national mourning, with no other musical performances.\n\nIn a brief dispute with the church authorities flared up. The sub-deacon, Gaudlitz, demanded that he himself should choose the hymns to be sung before and after the sermon at Vespers; as it was usual for the Kantor to select these hymns, Bach felt that his rights had been encroached upon. As the dispute was settled in the sub-deacon’s favour Bach must have seen this as a setback, for once again his grievances had not been met; but his relations with the ecclesiastical authorities were on the whole good throughout his time at Leipzig. His relations with the town council, in particular the supervisor of the Thomasschule, Councillor Stieglitz, went less smoothly and were to become even more difficult in the 1730s. Documents dealing with the various disputes show Bach to have been a stubborn defender of the prerogatives of his office who frequently reacted with excessive violence and was often to blame if there was a negative outcome. It would be wrong, however, to draw hasty inferences about Bach’s personality and his relations with the world about him. It is an unfortunate coincidence that about a half of Bach’s surviving correspondence is concerned with generally trivial but often protracted disputes over rights. This material is extant in public archives, while utterances of kinds not appropriate to archival preservation, which might have complemented this rather austere view of his personality, have survived in only small quantity. From Bach’s behaviour during these disputes it can be seen that, under pressure, he would defy bureaucratic regulations in order to preserve his independence and to clear himself an artistic breathing-space. His taking over of the collegium musicum in , to be directed under his own management, must be seen in this context, as it represents something more than an incidental biographical fact.\n\nEarly in Bach spent some time at the Weissenfels court in connection with the birthday celebrations in February of Duke Christian, with whom he had long been associated. In January the title of court Kapellmeister of Saxe-Weissenfels was conferred on him (his Cöthen title had expired with the death of Prince Leopold); he retained the title until the duke’s death in . At the end of March, he went to Cöthen to perform the funeral music for his former princely employer; only the text survives of this large-scale work in four parts (bwv1143), but much of its music can be reconstructed as it consists of parodies of bwv198 and 244. On April 15 (Good Friday) the St Matthew Passion was performed again at the Thomaskirche. On the second day of Whit week (June 6) and very near the end of the school year, the Picander cycle cantata bwv174 was performed. The manuscript, uniquely for Bach, is dated ‘fine d: 5 Junij 1729. Lipsiae’; perhaps this represents some sort of final gesture after a heavy, six-year involvement in cantata composition.\n\nBeside the production of cantatas, Passions, and other vocal occasional works, both sacred and secular, instrumental music retreated to the background during Bach’s first years in Leipzig. Apart from some keyboard and chamber works (including the sonatas for harpsichord and violin bwv1014–19) there appear to have been only a relatively small number of organ works (preludes and fugues, trio sonatas) which are hard to date individually but will have been primarily connected with Bach’s activities as a recitalist.\n\nIn an invitation to visit Leipzig was delivered to Handel, then in Halle, by Wilhelm Friedemann, in place of his father who was ill at the time; but nothing came of it. Thus, Bach’s second and last attempt to establish contact with his highly esteemed London colleague met with failure. Significantly, in both cases the initiative was taken by Bach.\n\n8. Leipzig, 1729–39.\n\nChristoph Wolff\n\nOn his appointment as director of the collegium musicum, decisive changes came about in Bach’s activities in Leipzig; and at the same time new possibilities were opened up. The collegium had been founded by Telemann in and had most recently been directed by Georg Balthasar Schott (who left to become Kantor at Gotha in ); it was a voluntary association of professional musicians and university students that gave regular weekly (and during the fair season even more frequent) public concerts. Such societies played an important part in the flowering of bourgeois musical culture in the 18th century, and with his highly reputed ensemble, in such an important commercial centre as Leipzig, Bach made his own contribution to this. After having previously been loosely connected with the collegium (e.g., performing bwv193.1 in ), he took over its direction before the third Sunday after Easter – in other words, by – and retained it until .\n\nBach must have had strong reasons for wanting to take on this fresh area of work in addition to his other duties. To some extent it is possible to guess those reasons. For six years he had immersed himself primarily in the production of sacred music, and he had created a stock of works sufficient to supply the requirements of his remaining time in office. In his efforts to provide sacred music that was at once fastidious and comprehensive he had met with little appreciation from the authorities, and no additional facilities (for example, much needed professional instrumentalists) had been placed at his disposal: it would be understandable if he now felt resigned to the situation. Further, as a former Kapellmeister, he must have been attracted by the prospect of working with a good instrumental ensemble, and another important incentive must have been the thought that, as director of the collegium, he would be able to establish a wholly independent musical praxis, in accordance with his own ideas and, in fact, be practically in control of musical life in Leipzig. Whether the new position brought him some additional income remains unknown.\n\nNothing, unfortunately, is known about the programmes of the ‘ordinaire’ weekly concerts. But the surviving performing parts for such works as the orchestral suites bwv1066–8, the violin concertos bwv1041–3, and the flute sonatas bwv1030 and 1039 demonstrate that Bach performed many of his Cöthen instrumental works (some in revised form) as well as new compositions. The seven harpsichord concertos bwv1052–8, collected together in a Leipzig manuscript, also belong in this context. Bach often performed works by other composers as well, including five orchestral suites by his cousin Johann Ludwig, secular cantatas by Handel and Porpora, and the flute quartets that Telemann wrote for Paris. Further, Bach’s many musical acquaintances from other places must have made frequent appearances, including his colleagues in the Dresden court orchestra (there is evidence of visits from Johann Adolf Hasse and his wife Faustina, Georg Benda, Silvius Leopold Weiss, Carl Heinrich Graun, and Jan Dismas Zelenka). C.P.E. Bach’s remark that ‘it was seldom that a musical master passed through [Leipzig] without getting to know my father and playing for him’ must refer to performances of the collegium musicum, which took place on Wednesdays between 4 and 6 p.m. in the coffee-garden ‘before the Grimmisches Thor’ during the summer months and on Fridays between 8 and 10 p.m. in Zimmermann’s coffee-house during the winter. In addition, there were ‘extraordinaire’ concerts, to mark special events; on these occasions, during the 1730s, Bach performed his large-scale secular cantatas. The number of text booklets (300) printed for those special events provide an idea about the size of the audience. His activities with the collegium must have made heavy demands on him, and the reduction in his production of sacred music is easy to understand.\n\nThis does not, however, mean that his interest in sacred music was diminished. Such a view is contradicted not only by the major ecclesiastical works written after but also by the simple fact that, throughout his period of office, Bach provided performances of his cantatas, a repertory largely completed before , every Sunday at the two main Leipzig churches. His reference to the ‘onus’ of such undertakings, in connection with the performance of a Passion planned for , might just as well have been made in the 1720s. Admittedly, his difficulties became particularly acute about , as his important memorandum of , dealing with the state of church music in Leipzig and outlining his remedies, testifies. His letter of October 28 that year, to his old friend Erdmann in Danzig, may be read in the same sense; sheer frustration that the memorandum had proved ineffectual drove him to consider leaving Leipzig. It would seem that his work with the collegium musicum had not yet brought about the intended equilibrium in his activities.\n\nThe situation had been aggravated by other, external factors. The old headmaster Johann Heinrich Ernesti had died in (Bach had performed the motet bwv226 at his funeral in October). During the subsequent interim in the Thomasschule’s direction the organization of school life was disturbed. Problems of space appear to have arisen too. It was in this context that complaints were made about Bach’s neglect of his school duties (the dropping of singing lessons, absence on journeys without leave); in there was even a question of reducing his salary ‘because the Kantor is incorrigible’. It would appear that things were put right by Johann Matthias Gesner, an old acquaintance from the Weimar years who took over the headship of the school in the summer, and who seems soon to have established friendly and familiar relations with Bach.\n\nOn Good Friday Bach apparently performed the St John Passion in its third version bwv245.3, and in the two following years the St Mark Passion bwv247 and an anonymous St Luke Passion bwv246. From June 25 to 27, 1730 the bicentenary of the Augsburg Confession was celebrated across Lutheran Germany, and Bach wrote three cantatas for the event (bwv190.2, 120.3, and 1139.2). They are not untypical of his church compositions of this period, most of which were put together as reworkings of earlier compositions and parodies; that is also true also of the major vocal works like the St Mark Passion, the B minor Mass, the Kyrie-Gloria masses, and the oratorio trilogy for Christmas, Easter, and Ascension Day. Among the relatively few new cantatas composed between and , the chorale-text-only works bwv9, 14, 97, 100, 112, 117, 140, 177, and 192 stand out.\n\nIn a collected edition of the six partitas appeared as op.1, under the title I.Teil der Clavier-Übung. From this formulation it is clear that Bach planned further ‘parts’ in a series of ‘keyboard exercises’, and these he now proceeded to produce. His new and continuing interest in publishing his own compositions is a clear sign of a new determination with regard to independent and freely creative activity. At the end of Bach and his family had to move to temporary quarters while rebuilding and extension work were being carried out on the Thomasschule. His residence must have become increasingly cramped, for his family was growing. In the early years in Leipzig Anna Magdalena had borne a child almost every year, but few of them survived infancy: Christiana Sophia Henrietta (b spring ; d ), Gottfried Heinrich (48), Christian Gottlieb (bap. ; d ), Elisabeth Juliane Friederica (bap. ; d Leipzig, ), Ernestus Andreas (bap. ; d ), Regina Johanna (bap. ; d ), Christiana Benedicta (bap. ; d ), Christiana Dorothea (bap. ; d ), Johann Christoph Friedrich (49), Johann August Abraham (bap. ; d ), Johann Christian (50), Johanna Carolina (bap. ; d Leipzig, ), Regina Susanna (bap. ; d Leipzig, ).\n\nJoy and sorrow were everyday matters. But Bach’s family life must have been harmonious in more than one sense; in he reported, as a proud paterfamilias, that with his family he could form a vocal and instrumental concert ensemble. The family moved back into their refurbished apartment the next April. The school was reconsecrated on with a cantata, bwv1162. In Bach had been to Dresden for the first performance of Hasse’s opera Cleofide and to give concerts at the Sophienkirche and at court (there were enthusiastic reports in the newspapers). In he went with his wife to Kassel for the examination and inauguration of the organ of the Martinskirche, where he reportedly played the ‘Dorian’ Toccata and Fugue in D minor bwv538.\n\nWith the death of Elector Friedrich August I of Saxony on a six-month period of national mourning began.During the mourning period and as soon as the date was set for the fealty visit in Leipzig by Elector Friedrich August II, Bach appears to have composed the Missa (Kyrie and Gloria) of what would later become the B minor Mass bwv232 for the festive service in the Nikolaikirche on April 21. However, whether or not the performance actually took place on that day – after it was decided that the protestant court without the Roman-catholic Elector would attend the Lutheran service – remains unclear.

There is evidence to suggest that the Missa was also performed at this time, perhaps at the Sophienkirche in Dresden, where W.F. Bach had been working as an organist since .

As a gesture of thanks, Bach paid his respects to the Dresden royal household and an enthusiastic public with a two-hour recital on the new Silbermann organ at the Frauenkirche on December 1. Henceforth, his name and title as 'church composer’ was kept on the rolls of the Dresden Royal Kapelle and Chamber Music through .\n\nAfter the dedication of the Missa in , Bach kept the Saxon royal family’s interests in mind with his ‘extraordinaire’ concerts of the collegium musicum.
