I already know we say \"gute Nacht\" and \"schönes Wochenende\". So here I have two possibilities, it may be accusative or nominative.\n\nIf they really say \"schön Abend\" it might then be because of their dialekt...\n\nAs I want to look like a real german :p when I say good good evening and because grammar is important to me as a learner, to have some basics to which I can refer while speaking, I need your help.\n\nFor the moment I'm stuck with my \"Einen schönen Tag noch\".\n\nThank you in advance."
