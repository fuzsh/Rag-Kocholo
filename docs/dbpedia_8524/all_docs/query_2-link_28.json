For a self-assessment go to our link collection.\n\nIf you have prior knowledge of German but are not sure which class is the right level for you, please check the tables of contents below the group class tables. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us.\n\nIf the number of registered students is less than three in a class, we reserve the right to cancel or combine classes. You will be informed accordingly prior to the start of the class.\n\nClass fees are not refundable and must be paid in full prior to the first day of class. Once you have registered for one or more classes, your credit card will be charged within 48 hours.\n\nOur school follows BVSD (Boulder Valley School District) for all weather-related closures.\n\nTextbooks\n\nTextbooks can be purchased through the school and the book fee will be added to your school account.\n\nIf you signed up for an in-person class the teacher will be handing out the book during the first class. Books for online classes will need to be picked up at the Director’s house — we do not mail or ship books or materials.\n\nIMPORTANT! If you are unable to pick up your book in Boulder, please order your book online through Amazon or directly from the publisher. Thank you!"
