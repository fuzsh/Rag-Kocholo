        "text": "Almost five years in the making, 700 published articles and nearly 3.5 million page views later, Newly Swissed has been featured in a major Swiss newspaper.\n\nFor the team behind Newly Swissed, this kind of press coverage is a big deal. Why?\n\nBlick am Abend is one of the major commuter tabloids, published by the Ringier group. The official print circulation is 308'936 copies.\n\nThis means that the article about Newly Swissed has been printed and distributed 308'936 times - minus the ten copies which I have kept for our archives.\n\nTaking one for the Team\n\nFor those who do not speak German, here is a translation:\n\n\"Newlyswissed.com is a website for expats – but it is just as interesting for the local Swiss. That is because Dimitri Burkhard (33) and his team look at [Switzerland] with wide open eyes. They come across the kinds of things that many Swiss do not even notice. As a result, they regularly deliver funny, interesting or even curious stories.\"\n\n\"For instance, they have visited a vintage junk yard, have recommend a [burger] restaurant where French fries are served in Chinese pottery, and know the best place to take your date in Zürich this season. The latter is a chilly place: The ice rink at ETH where the city views are simply stunning. Dimitri is Swiss, is married to a Japanese and has lived in the United States as an expat for many years.\"\n\n\"CAPTION: Dimitri Burkhard (33) explores Switzerland. Here is his latest discovery: A vinyl record stamp from the Swiss Postal Service.\"\n\n\"But what was inside that parcel?\"\n\nBy a show of hands: How many have wondered what was inside the package I am holding in the picture? Swiss photographers Ursula Sprecher and Andi Cortellini have been on my radar since 2011 when I featured their quirky portraits of Swiss hobby clubs.\n\nNow they have released the entire collection in a book, and I had to have it! The parcel contained the book, but the vinyl record stamp caught my attention first..."
