The olinguito weighs 2 lbs. and looks like “a cross between a teddy bear and a house cat.”\n\n—NBC LA, August 23, 2013\n\nA new Schnügel has been discovered! 😀 Well… I’m a little behind in my blog posts, so technically, it was discovered back in August, but I didn’t get a chance to blog about it until now. 😛\n\nI ♥ Schnügels. It’s my favorite Swiss word. For those of you who aren’t familiar with it, let me backtrack a bit and give you a brief history on my introduction to the origin of this word.\n\nMy friend E- first told me about it a few years back, and ever since then, I’ve been addicted. Blick am Abend (which literally translates to “View at night”) is a free Swiss daily newspaper that is distributed throughout all the train and tram stations here every weekday evening. On the 3rd to last page from the back, there is always a photo of “der Schnügel des Tages” (the Pet of the Day).\n\nPeople send photos of their cute pets with a short comment, and looking at this photo has become the highlight of my day. 🙂 Generally, it is a photo of a kitty or doggie or hamster, so I figure the word Schnügel must mean something small, cute, and furry. However, occasionally I see a bird or snake or lizard or something else as the Schnügel. I think recently, there was even a goldfish. But my favorites are always the cute, fluffy ones.\n\nOnce, I came upon a website that showed a Kägi-fretli chocolate bar as the Schnügel of the Day, but I’m not sure if it was a joke or not, as I can’t read German. 😦\n\nBut usually Schnügels are cutie animals. So it was very exciting for me to read that scientists recently discovered a new mammal. With big eyes and soft orange-brown fur, the olinguito definitely fits the definition of a Schnügel. I mean, look at this guy… it almost appears as if he’s smiling at us!\n\nHip hip hooray! A new Schnügel has been discovered. The world is now a cuter place. 🙂"
