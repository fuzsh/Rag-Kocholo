The newspaper was filled with rumors, political scandals, provocative articles, exclusive materials, crime and other «sensitive» topics from everyday life in Switzerland, which reputable publications preferred to avoid. The name of this Zurich newspaper can be translated from German as «Glare», «Flash», «Reflection», «Lightning».\n\nThis was the first experience of publishing a typical tabloid press in Switzerland. It is not surprising that the newspaper was soon hit by a wave of criticism and indignation from dissatisfied readers, and there were even attempts to close the publication. Despite the difficulties, the popularity of «Blick» grew at an extraordinary pace, just a year later its daily circulation set the first record in Switzerland — 200 thousand copies. In the following years, the circulation only increased. In the 1980s, the newspaper used Bingo lottery cards to attract new readers. In the early 1990s, the popularity of «Blick» began to decline, however, in 1995, the newspaper's editorial board was able to set a new circulation record — more than 335 thousand copies.\n\nSince 2008, an abridged version of this tabloid «Blick am Abend» has been published in Switzerland, and it is distributed in the evening as a free advertising and information newspaper.\n\nTranslate the latest edition of the Switzerland newspaper «Blick»\n\nLatest issue of the «Blick» (The Flash) may be translated in English language now.\n\nFor request latest edition of this media, click «Translate» button in front of the selected translator.\n\nTranslation result will be opened in your browser on new window (or tab).\n\nSelect one of the translators below.\n\navailable 3 translators\n\n⇓\n\nTranslate «Blick / The Flash / blick.ch» newspaper into English by Google Translate\n\nClick on this button to begin translation of the media ⇒\n\nRead «Blick / The Flash / blick.ch» newspaper online in English with translation by Yandex Translate\n\nFor request translation result click on this button ⇒\n\n«Blick / The Flash / blick.ch» in English by Bing Translator\n\nClick on button this for translate media ⇒\n\n...\n\nEnglish version of «Blick / The Flash / blick.ch», latest issue from SysTran Translation Service\n\nTranslator currently not available x\n\nEnglish edition of «Blick / The Flash / blick.ch», fresh translation by PROMT Trans\n\nTranslator currently not available x"
