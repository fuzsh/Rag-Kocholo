        "text": "When you learn German, learning German idioms (Redewendungen) is a fun and effective way to boost your language fluency.\n\nYou'll hear numerous references to sausages, condiments, bread, and other delicious German foods.

Um den heißen Brei herumreden\n\nLiteral Translation – Talk around the hot porridge.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Beat around the bush.\n\nAlthough you may not need this phrase very often with your direct German friends, it could come in useful if you want to sound more like a native speaker. If you want someone to get to the point, tell them:\n\nRede nicht um den den heißen Brei herum. (Don't (you) beat around the bush.)\n\n2. Da kannst du Gift drauf nehmen\n\nLiteral Translation – You can put poison on that!\n\nEnglish Meaning – You can bet your life on it!\n\nThis following German idiom doesn't sound very friendly, but it means that something is a sure thing. For example, if someone asks if you think you'll pass your next German exam, you can respond with this phrase.\n\nIch weiß, dass ich die Prüfung bestehen werde. Da kannst du Gift drauf nehmen! (I know that I'll pass the exam. You can bet your life one it!\n\n3. Sich zum Affen machen\n\nLiteral Translation – Make an ape of yourself\n\nEnglish Meaning – Make a fool of yourself\n\nInstead of making a fool of themselves, Germans turn into monkeys or apes. If you think someone is misbehaving, you can say:\n\nMach dich nicht zum Affen! (Don't make a fool of yourself!)\n\n4. Zwei Fliegen mit einer Klappe schlagen\n\nLiteral Translation – Hit two flies with one swat.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Kill two birds with one stone.\n\nThe next time you do two things at once, remember this German idiom that has been around since the 8th century.\n\nDu kannst zwei Fliegen mit einer Klappe schlagen. (You can hit two flies with one stone.)\n\n5. Eine Extrawurst verlangen\n\nLiteral Translation – Demand an extra sausage.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Demand special treatment\n\nImagine the entitlement someone must have to demand an extra sausage! Although this German idiom includes a food reference, use this expression to speak about entitled individuals in a disapproving tone.\n\nWarum verlangst du immer eine Extrawurst?! (Why do you always demand special treatment?!)\n\n6. Himmel und Hölle in Bewegung setzen\n\nLiteral Translation – Set heaven and hell in motion.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Move heaven and earth.\n\nWhen you think of a romantic phrase to say to your loved one, you probably don't think about including the word “hell.” In German, it's completely acceptable to say you'll do anything to achieve a goal.\n\nIch setze Himmel und Hölle in Bewegung. (I'm moving heaven and earth.)\n\n7. Da steppt der Bär\n\nLiteral Translation – The bear dances there\n\nEnglish Meaning – A party that's off-the-hook\n\nIn German, the idea of a dancing bear signifies a party you won't want to miss! The next time you want to get everyone rushing to a party, remember to tell them:\n\nDu musst dort sein. Da steppt der Bär. (You have to be there. The party is off-the-hook.)\n\n8. Tomaten auf den Augen haben\n\nLiteral Translation – Have tomatoes on the eyes.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Blind to something\n\nSometimes in life, we can all be oblivious to facts staring us straight in the face. In German, you might have tomatoes on your eyes that are distorting your perception of reality.\n\nHast du Tomaten auf den Augen? Sie will dich nur für dein Geld. (Are you blind? She only wants you for your money.)\n\n9. Den Nagel auf den Kopf treffen\n\nLiteral Translation – Hit the nail on the head.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Hit the nail on the head.\n\nThis German idiom is the same as the English version. When someone is spot-on doing something correctly, let them know.\n\nDu hast den Nagel auf den Kopf getroffen. (You hit the nail on the head.)\n\n10. Ich verstehe nur Bahnhof\n\nLiteral Translation – I only understand train station.\n\nEnglish Meaning – It's all Greek to me.\n\nWhen your German friend uses an idiom that you don't understand, you can respond with this idiom, which means you can't make heads or tails out of the conversation.\n\nIch verstehe nur Bahnhof. Kannst du nochmal erklären? (It's all Greek to me. Can you explain again?)\n\n11. Weggehen wie warme Semmeln\n\nLiteral Translation – Leave like warm rolls.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Sell like hotcakes.\n\nThe word Semmeln is a colloquial term for Brötchen (bread rolls). You can use this phrase to talk about a product or service that's selling fast and in high demand.\n\nMein neues Design geht weg wie warme Semmeln. (My new design is selling like hotcakes.)\n\n12. Seinen Senf dazugeben\n\nLiteral Translation – Add his mustard to it.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Give your two cents worth.\n\nOnce again, a favorite German food makes its way into a well-known idiom. Instead of giving your two cents to express your opinion, you add your mustard.\n\nEr muss immer seinen Senf dazugeben. (He always has to give his opinion.)\n\n13. Jemandem die Daumen drücken\n\nLiteral Translation – Press the thumbs for someone.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Cross your fingers.\n\nIn English, we cross our fingers for someone to wish them luck. But, in German, you have to press your thumbs into the palm of your hand.\n\nSei nicht nervös. Wir drücken dir die Daumen! (Don't be nervous, we have our fingers crossed for you!)\n\n14. Etwas wie seine Westentasche kennen\n\nLiteral Translation – Know something like your vest pocket.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Know something like the back of your hand.\n\nSimilar to the English expression, this German idiom stresses how well you know something.\n\nIch wohne seit zwanzig Jahren in Berlin. Ich kenne die Stadt wie meine Westentasche. (I've lived in Berlin for 20 years. I know the city like the back of my hand.)\n\n15. Man soll den Tag nicht vor dem Abend loben\n\nLiteral Translation – One shouldn't praise the day before the evening.\n\nEnglish Meaning – You shouldn't count your chickens before they hatch.\n\nWhen you celebrate prematurely, you could risk disappointment later. You can warn others in German by telling them not to praise the day before the evening arrives.\n\nWir haben Fortschritte gemacht, aber wir sollten den Tag nicht vor dem Abend loben. (We made progress, but we shouldn't count our chickens before they hatch.\n\n16. Jemandem ein Ohr abkauen\n\nLiteral Translation – Chew off someone's ear.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Talk off someone's ear.\n\nSome people don't know when to stop speaking. At times, you might even feel like your ear is about to fall off. In German, chewing off someone's ear means you're annoying them with your endless rambling.\n\nIch habe Martha an ihrem Geburtstag angerufen, und sie hat mir ein Ohr abgekaut für zwei Studen. (I called Martha on her birthday, and she talked my ear off for two hours.)\n\n17. Klar wie Kloßbrühe\n\nLiteral Translation – Clear as dumbling broth\n\nEnglish Meaning – Crystal clear\n\nIronically, German dumpling soup isn't a clear liquid but a milky white. Nevertheless, you can confirm that you fully understand your German friends with this colloquial expression. Don't be surprised if you hear someone exchange Kloßbrühe for a different but similar brothy dish.\n\nDu musst dich nicht wiederholen. Die Anweisungen sind klar wie Kloßbrühe! (You don't have to repeat yourself. The instructions are crystal clear!)\n\n18. Dumm wie Bohnenstroh\n\nLiteral Translation – Dumb as bean straw\n\nEnglish Meaning – Dumb as a post\n\nThis idiom's origin came from a centuries-old tradition when peasants used leftover plant cuttings, or bean straw, to fill their mattresses. Because poorer classes were assumed to be unintelligent, the term dumb as bean straw emerged.\n\nDie Kandidaten sind dumm wie Bohnenstoh. (The candidates are as dumb as posts.)\n\n19. Die Kirche im Dorf lassen\n\nLiteral Translation – Leave the church in the village.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Don't get carried away.\n\nWhen someone gets carried away with excitement, you might need to remind them that their ideas are becoming overwhelming. Before the invention of electricity, a town crier would announce important events at the church. Hence, the origin of this unusual German idiom, which means, settle down.\n\nWir müssen die Kirche im Dorf lassen. (We have to keep a cool head.)\n\n20. Schwein haben\n\nLiteral Translation – Have a pig.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Be lucky.\n\nIn German, you'll often find pigs symbolizing good luck. When something incredible happens to you, let everyone know you've had a pig using this German idiom.\n\nHeute habe ich Schwein gehabt! Ich habe 50 Euro auf dem Boden gefunden. (I got lucky today! I found 50 Euros on the floor.)\n\n21. Die Salamitaktik anwenden\n\nLiteral Translation – Use the salami tactic.\n\nEnglish Meaning – The Salami tactic is a stealthy approach to admit the truth.\n\nA Salamitaktik is the name given to a distinct method someone uses to reveal the truth bit by bit.\n\nExpensive German salami comes in extra-thin slices. You might need to eat hundreds of slices before you get to the end, which is where the meaning of the expression originates.\n\nThe person using the Salamitaktik is trying to soften the blow of whatever they are trying to say.\n\nVersuchst du die Salamitaktik anzuwenden? (Are you trying to use the salami tactic?)\n\n22. Da haben wir den Salat\n\nLiteral Translation – There, we have the salad.\n\nEnglish Meaning – We're in a big mess.\n\nSometimes you warn somebody about the consequences of their actions, but they just don't listen. You know that a trainwreck is about to happen, but there's nothing you can do about it. Similar to “I told you so,” you can use this German idiom to remind someone that you foresaw the entire predicament.\n\nDu hast die Regeln ignoriert. Jetzt haben wir den Salat. (You ignored the rules. Now we're in a mess.)\n\n23. Das fünfte Rad am Wagen sein\n\nLiteral Translation – Be the fifth wheel on the wagon.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Be the third wheel.\n\nInstead of saying someone is the third wheel, Germans say someone is the fifth wheel when they are the odd man out. If somebody tags along uninvitedly, this German idiom could be appropriate.\n\nIch möchte nicht das fünfte Rad am Wagen sein. (I don't want to be a third wheel.)\n\n24. Einen Vogel haben\n\nLiteral Translation – Have a bird.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Crazy\n\nSomeone who has a bird in German must be out of their mind. The expression originates from the belief that crazy people must have a little bird in their heads. Typically, Germans use this idiom as an insult.\n\nDu hast einen Vogel! (You're insane!)\n\n25. Geld aus dem Fenster werfen\n\nLiteral Translation – Throw money out the window.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Throw money out the window.\n\nSome German idioms are the same as their English counterparts like this one. When someone is wasting money or overspending, this expression can come in handy.\n\nWarum wirfst du Geld aus dem Fenster? (Why are you throwing money away?)\n\n26. Eine Leiche im Keller haben\n\nLiteral Translation – Have a (dead) body in the basement.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Have skeletons in the closet.\n\nSome German idioms seem to paint the most atrocious images in your mind, and this one is no exception. The English phrase of having skeletons in the closet is a tamer way of saying you have secrets from the past. As the Germans say, a skeleton in the closet, or body in the basement, can also be an embarrassing or unpleasant memory you keep to yourself.\n\nEs scheint ihnen gut zu gehen, aber die Familie hat eine Menge Schulden. Das ist nicht ihre einzige leiche im Keller, die sie haben. (They seem to be well-off, but the family has a lot of debt. That's not their only skeleton in the closet.)\n\n27. Lügen haben kurze Beine\n\nLiteral Translation – Lies have short legs.\n\nEnglish Meaning – You won't get far with lies.\n\nThis German idiom is a reminder that the truth always comes out eventually and that lies won't get you very far. You can use this phrase to say, “you won't get away with this,” to a liar. The expression is also similar to the English idiom, “liar, liar, pants on fire.”\n\nVergiss nicht, dass Lügen kurze Beine haben. (Don't forget that lies get exposed.)\n\n28. Fix und fertig\n\nLiteral Translation – Quick and ready\n\nEnglish Meaning – At the end of your rope.\n\nWhen you're worn-out, exhausted, or at your wit's end, this German idiom could be the perfect way to describe your emotional and physical state. After powering through a long workday or challenging activity, it's not unusual for a person to feel fix und fertig.\n\nNach zwölf Stunden Arbeit bin ich fix und fertig. (After 12 hours of work, I'm completely exhausted.)\n\n29. Ich glaube ich spinne\n\nLiteral Translation – I think I spider.\n\nEnglish Meaning – I can't believe it.\n\nSometimes, you can't believe what you're hearing or seeing. In this case, you can use the popular German idiom that doesn't make any sense when translated literally. Similar to “you've got to be kidding,” or “I think I'm losing my mind,” this phrase is appropriate to use when you hear a shocking announcement.\n\nDu hast ein neues Auto gekauft ohne mich zu fragen? Ich glaube ich spinne. (You bought a new car without asking me? You've got to be joking.)\n\n30. Die beleidigte Leberwurst spielen\n\nLiteral Translation – Act like the offended liver sausage\n\nEnglish Meaning – Act like a prima Donna.\n\nUse this German idiom to describe anyone who is easily offended, a sore loser, or acting difficult. Typically, the liver sausage is the last sausage of choice for most Germans, who tend to choose the more appealing varieties first.\n\nDu hast nur eine Runde verloren. Jetzt spiel nicht die beleidigte Leberwurst. (You only lost one round. Don't act like a sore loser now.)\n\n31. Einen Kater haben\n\nLiteral Translation – Have a tomcat.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Be hungover.\n\nAfter a night of drinking too much German beer or wine, you might end up with a hangover or Kater. Originally, Kater comes from the word Katarrh, a condition involving inflammation of the mucous membranes. Over time, the pronunciation of the word became Kater.\n\nViele Deutsche klagen über einen Kater am Neujahrstag. (Many Germans complain about a hangover on new year's day.)\n\n32. Alles hat ein Ende, nur eine Wurst hat zwei\n\nLiteral Translation – Everything has an end. Only a sausage has two.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Nothing lasts forever.\n\nEverything ends at some point, which is where the following German idiom gets its roots. The sausage reference adds a dash of humor to an otherwise depressing reminder of our mortality.\n\nSei nicht so traurig. Alles hat ein Ende, nur eine Wurst hat zwei. (Don't be so sad. Everything has to come to an end eventually.)\n\n33. Ein Affentheater aufführen\n\nLiteral Translation – To throw an ape theater performance.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Throw a fit.\n\nIf you can imagine a group of apes throwing a fit, you'll easily understand this German idiom. A person who is overreacting and beginning to behave like an uncivilized animal may inspire you to bust out this phrase.\n\nHör auf so ein Affentheater aufzuführen! (Stop throwing such a fit!)\n\n34. Unter einer Decke stecken\n\nLiteral Translation – Hide under a blanket.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Be in cahoots.\n\nWhen you keep a secret between yourself and someone else, or a small group of people, you may be in cahoots. If you're keeping the secret from others, Germans say you're “hiding under a blanket.”\n\nWir müssen die Überraschungsparty geheim halten. Er darf nicht wissen dass wir unter einer Decke stecken. (We have to keep the surprise party secret. He can't find out that we're in cahoots.\n\n35. Das Ei des Kolumbus\n\nLiteral Translation – The egg of Columbus\n\nEnglish Meaning – A light bulb moment.\n\nEver spend hours searching for a solution to a problem, only to discover that the answer was strikingly straightforward the entire time? Once you know how to do something, it seems easy enough, but getting to that point doesn't always happen immediately. Germans call this phenomenon finding the egg of Columbus.\n\nEndlich habe ich das Ei des Kolumbus gefunden. (I finally found the simple solution.)\n\n36. Das Haar in der Suppe suchen/finden\n\nLiteral Translation – Search for/Find the hair in the soup.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Find fault with something.\n\nOverly-critical and pessimistic individuals in German are often referred to as searching for hairs in the soup. One way to remind someone to be less negative is with this idiom that expresses your disapproval of the person's outlook.\n\nManche Menschen müssen immer das Haar in der Suppe suchen. (Some people always have to find fault with something.)\n\n37. Ich glaube mein Schwein pfeift\n\nLiteral Translation – I think my pig is whistling.\n\nEnglish Meaning – When pigs fly!\n\nExpress your astonishment during the most unexpected moments with this useful German idiom. Like the English phrase, “when pigs fly,” the German version uses the verb whistle instead of fly. This expression is also valuable to express sarcasm when you believe something is nonsense.\n\nIch glaube mein Schwein pfeift! Ich hätte nie gedacht, dass er über 40 ist. (I don't believe it! I never would have thought that he's over 40.)\n\n38. Es ist alles in Butter\n\nLiteral Translation – It's all in butter.\n\nEnglish Meaning – It's all good.\n\nEverything is better when it's covered in butter in this German idiom. If someone asks how you are, you can use this phrase to let them know you feel fine and that everything is hunky-dory.\n\nEs ist alles in Butter. Ich mach mich gemütlich. (I'm fine. I'm making myself comfortable.)\n\n39. Da fresse ich glatt einen Besen\n\nLiteral Translation – I'll smoothly chow down on a broom.\n\nEnglish Meaning – I'll eat my hat if that's the truth.\n\nYet another sarcastic way to reply to a statement you find hard to believe is the phrase, “I'll eat a broom.” In English, you might say, “I'll eat my hat,” to express your reluctance to believe something.\n\nWenn du recht hast, fresse ich einen Besen. (If you're right, I'll eat my hat.)\n\n40. Wir sitzen schōn in der Tinte!\n\nLiteral Translation – We're sitting in ink nicely.\n\nEnglish Meaning – We're in a lot of trouble.\n\nWhen you find yourself in a jam, use this German idiom. Many times, this phrase implies someone is having financial difficulties.\n\nWarum sitzt du so tief in der Tinte? (Why are you in so much trouble?)\n\n41. Mich laust der Affe\n\nLiteral Translation – The ape is delousing me.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.\n\nOne way to announce that you're surprised in German is with this exclamation of bewilderment. Sometimes, you might hear something that takes you off-guard. This knowledge could even be as shocking as a random monkey coming up and delousing you.\n\nNext time you're blown away by a story, you can put your feelings into words with this fun German idiom.\n\nIch glaube, mich laust der Affe. (Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.)\n\n42. Nach jemandes Pfeife tanzen\n\nLiteral Translation – Dance to someone's flute.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Do everything someone else's way.\n\nIf anyone expects you to bend over backward to please them, you might end up dancing to their flute instead of your own. In English, you might say you're dancing to someone's tune, blindly obeying, or doing their bidding.\n\nIch muss nicht nach deiner Pfeife tanzen! (I don't have to do everything you say!)\n\n43. Voller Bauch studiert nicht gern\n\nLiteral Translation – A full stomach doesn't like to study.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Fat belly, lean brain\n\nMost Germans know that it's essential to take a break after eating before returning to your mental tasks. This phrase is helpful after lunch when you start to feel sleepy and not at your most productive.\n\nIch brauche noch 15 Minuten. Voller Bauch studiert nicht gern. (I still need 15 minutes. A full stomach doesn't like to study.)\n\n44. Jemanden ausnehmen wie eine Weihnachtsgans\n\nLiteral Translation – Tear someone apart like a Christmas goose.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Take someone to the cleaners'.\n\nAlthough this phrase might sound like an intimidating remark or threat, it refers to shamelessly taking someone's every last penny. When you prepare a Christmas goose, you typically remove the insides to insert the stuffing. A similar English idiom is, “to rob someone blind.”\n\nDie Organization hat uns ausgenommen wie eine Weihnachtsgans. (The organization robbed us of everything we had.)\n\n45. Schlafen wie ein Murmeltier\n\nLiteral Translation – Sleep like a marmot.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Sleep like a log.\n\nMarmots are known for sleeping particularly long and deep. The animals also have long hibernation periods, making them an ideal analogy. If you've had a similarly restful slumber, you can let others know how rejuvenated you are with this German idiom.\n\nIch habe wie ein Murmeltier geschlafen. (I slept like a baby.)\n\n46. Schlau wie ein Fuchs sein\n\nLiteral Translation – As clever as a fox\n\nEnglish Meaning – As clever as a fox\n\nYou must be as smart as a fox if you're brilliant. This idiom, which is the same in German and English, stems from the fact that foxes are skilled at finding food and shelter in many different environments.\n\nDu hast alle Antworten richtig. Du bist schlau wie ein Fuchs. (You got all the answers correct. You're as bright as a fox.)\n\n47. Wie Pilze aus dem Boden schießen\n\nLiteral Translation – Shoot out of the ground like mushrooms.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Spring up everywhere.\n\nWhen something proliferates within a short time, it's said to shoot out of the ground like mushrooms, at least in German. Under the right circumstances, mushrooms start growing everywhere in the forest, where this German idiom gets its origins.\n\nOnline-Shops sind überall. Sie schießen wie Pilze aus dem Boden. (Online shops are everywhere. They're springing up like mushrooms.)\n\n48. Krokodilstränen weinen\n\nLiteral Translation – Cry crocodile tears.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Insincere display of remorse.\n\nSomeone pretending to feel sorry about something is shedding crocodile tears. The saying stems from the notion that crocodiles don't feel guilty about eating their victims. Once the animal bites down on its prey, the pressure of its jaw closing presses on the tear ducts. Although the crocodile appears to be crying, it's not remorseful.\n\nEr weint immer Krokodilstränen wenn er erwischt wird. (He always sheds crocodile tears when he gets caught.)\n\n49. Wer zuerst kommt, mahlt zuerst\n\nLiteral Translation – Whoever comes first eats first.\n\nEnglish Meaning – First-come, first-serve.\n\nIf a limited supply of something is available, you might only have the chance to get it on a first-come, first-serve basis. This similar German idiom means the same thing. Whoever is the first person in line at the bakery is the first to get their bread, so you better not be last. Another meaning could be, “the early bird gets the worm.”\n\nDie Konzertkarten sind auf einer wer zuerst kommt, mahlt zuerst Basis angeboten. (The concert tickets are offered on a first-come first-serve basis.)\n\n50. Wie Kraut und Rüben\n\nLiteral Translation – Like cabbage and turnips.\n\nEnglish Meaning – topsy-turvy\n\nTraditionally, farmers planted cabbage and turnips together in the field. In contrast to other vegetables, farmers mix these two chaotically. After harvesting, the cabbage and turnips also cook well together. Now, the expression means something is all mixed up or a mess.\n\nDeine Wohnung sieht aus wie Kraut und Rüben. (Your apartment looks like a mess.)\n\n51. Das Zünglein an der Waage\n\nLiteral Translation – The pointer on the scale.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Tip the scale.\n\nThis is one of those German idioms that's relatively straightforward. Use the phrase to describe a deciding factor that tips the scale or balance. The Zünglein is the pointer on a scale that shows an exact measurement. Additionally, this phrase can mean “tie-breaker.”\n\nDie entgültige Abstimmung ist das Zünglein an der Waage. (The final vote is the tie-breaker.)\n\n52. Jacke wie Hose\n\nLiteral Translation – Jacket like pants.\n\nEnglish Meaning – It doesn't matter.\n\nMost jackets and pantsuits are made from the same fabric, which is where the meaning of this phrase comes from. When you use this expression, you're saying that it doesn't matter whether you choose option A or option B. The outcome will be the same.\n\nEs ist Jacke wie Hose. (It doesn't make a difference.)\n\n53. Turteltauben sein\n\nLiteral Translation – Be turtle doves.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Be lovebirds.\n\nTwo turtle doves are a sign of love, both in German and English. This is one of those German idioms to talk about two people who can't get enough of each other.\n\nKommt ihr zwei Turteltauben, oder nicht? (Are you two lovebirds coming, or not?)\n\n54. Seine Felle davonschwimmen sehen\n\nLiteral Translation – See his furs floating away.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Watch your hopes and dreams fade away.\n\nAnother melancholy German saying describes the tragic phenomenon of watching your hopes and dreams disappear before your eyes.\n\nThe traditional work of tanning hides had the potential to become a lucrative business. The craftsmen had to be careful not to lose the pelts while cleaning them in the river. If your grip wasn't firm enough, you might end up watching your dreams float away.\n\nWir haben plötzlich unsere Felle davonschwimmen gesehen. (We suddenly saw our dreams fading away.)\n\n55. Auf der Leitung stehen\n\nLiteral Translation – Stand on the wires.\n\nEnglish Meaning – A mental block\n\nSimilar to “I have my wires crossed,” this phrase is another way of saying that you're confused or don't understand something.\n\nYears ago, when the telephone connections were poor, some would say that someone was standing on the line, causing the bad signal. Consequently, communication and understanding were missing.\n\nToday, the expression means that someone is slow to catch on to what's happening.\n\nStehst du auf der Leitung? (Are you slow to catch on?)\n\n56. Jemanden übers Ohr hauen\n\nLiteral Translation – Go over someone's ear.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Cheat, pull a fast one.\n\nA blow above the ear line is against the rules and dangerous to the opponent in a fencing game. Because this type of move involves brutality, the term evolved to mean lying, cheating, or stiffing somebody.\n\nDu hast mich übers Ohr gehaut! (You set me up!)\n\n57. Jemanden über den Tisch ziehen\n\nLiteral Translation – Pull someone over the table.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Use somebody, mop the floor with someone (in a game)\n\nPulling someone over the table can mean that you ripped someone off, exploited them, or beat them mercilessly at their favorite board game. The phrase gets its origins from a traditional Alpine competition in which two players hook their middle fingers together with their elbows on the table. Then, both pull until one pulls the other over the table and wins.\n\nDu versuchst mich über den Tisch zu ziehen. (You're trying to rip me off.)\n\n58. Gift und Galle spucken\n\nLiteral Translation – Spit poison and bile.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Fly off the handle.\n\nSomeone furious might reach their boiling point and start spitting fire, or in German, poison, and bile.\n\nEr spuckt Gift und Galle, weil er nicht mehr das Sagen hat. (He's flying off the handle because he doesn't have the say anymore.)\n\n59. Butter bei die Fische\n\nLiteral Translation – Butter with the fish.\n\nEnglish Meaning – In all honesty/Give more effort.\n\nThis grammatically incorrect phrase is interesting because the accusative die follows the dative preposition bei. Another peculiarity is that this saying has two different meanings.\n\nFirst, you can use this German idiom to mean, in all honesty, to be frank or to cut to the chase. A second use for this expression can mean giving your best effort or give it some elbow grease.\n\nJetzt mal Butter bei die Fische. Hast du die Schule geschwänzt? (In all honesty, now. Did you skip school/play hooky?)\n\nGib ein bißchen Butter bei die Fische und du kannst in einer Stunde fertig sein. (Give some elbow grease and you can be done in an hour.)\n\n60. Den schwarzen Peter zuschieben\n\nLiteral Translation – Pass the black Peter.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Pass the blame.\n\nPointing the finger at or shifting the blame to someone else is known as passing the black Peter in German.\n\nThe idiom stems from an old children's card game. What we now think of as the Joker in a card deck was called the black Peter. When you put an inconvenient task into someone else's lap or play the blame game, you're passing them the Joker or most unwanted card in the deck.\n\nDiesmal kannst du nicht deinem Bruder den schwarzen Peter zuschieben. (You can't pass the blame onto your brother this time.)\n\n61. Eine Schwalbe macht noch keinen Sommer\n\nLiteral Translation – One swallow doesn't make a summer.\n\nEnglish Meaning – There's still a ways to go.\n\nCelebrating too soon could set you up for disappointment down the line. With this German idiom, you can remind someone not to count their chickens before they hatch.\n\nWir haben den ersten Schritt gemacht, aber eine Schwalbe macht noch keinen sommer. (We took the first step, but there's a long way to go.)\n\n62. Da brat mir einer einen Storch\n\nLiteral Translation – Someone is roasting a stork for me.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.\n\nThis is one of those creepy-sounding German idioms, but don't take it literally. Storks are thought to bring good fortune, which is why Germans traditionally protect and cherish them. The idea of roasting one is unimaginable, which is where this exclamation of surprise gets its roots.\n\nDa brat mir einer einen Storch! Sowas habe ich noch nie gesehen. (I'm shocked! I never saw something like that.)\n\n63. Den Schalk im Nacken haben\n\nLiteral Translation – Have the joker on the neck.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Be up to mischief.\n\nIf you're dealing with a prankster, joker, or another mischievous person, this German idiom can describe someone who's a pain in your neck.\n\nEr hat den Schalk im Nacken. (He's up to mischief.)\n\n64. Auf Wolke 7 schweben\n\nLiteral Translation – Float on cloud seven.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Float on cloud nine.\n\nAchieving the highest level of euphoria, bliss, and ultimate happiness is known as floating on cloud nine in English or cloud seven if you're German. According to the saying, God lives in the clouds in seventh heaven. This cloud is where the happiest angels live. Usually, this expression means someone is falling in love.\n\nSeit dem Urlaub schweben wir auf Wolke sieben. (We're floating on cloud nine since the vacation.)\n\n65. Kleider machen Leute\n\nLiteral Translation – Clothes make people.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Clothes make the man.\n\nBased on a short story in Swiss literature, you might recognize this German idiom from the similar English version. This phrase can remind someone of the importance of making an excellent first impression by dressing appropriately.\n\nKleider machen Leute ist besonders wahr in einem Geschäftsumfeld. (Clothes make people is especially true in a business setting.)\n\n66. Tabula Rasa machen\n\nLiteral Translation – Smoothly scraped board.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Start from a clean slate.\n\nThe term tabula rase stems from a Latin phrase meaning a smoothly scraped board or clean slate. If you're getting a fresh start or a new beginning, this idiom could provide an excellent opening line when meeting new friends. You can also use this phrase negatively to emphasize that your point is not to start over from scratch.\n\nWir wollen keine Tabula Rasa machen. (We don't want to start from scratch.)\n\n67. Eine Rabenmutter sein\n\nLiteral Translation – Be a raven mother.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Be a bad mother.\n\nIn German, if a mother fails to meet her parental responsibilities, she must be a raven mother. Because the bird's babies leave the nest before they can fly, the misconception arose that they are bad parents. Although the superstition isn't true, the idiom is still commonplace.\n\nIch fühle mich wie eine Rabenmutter. (I feel like a bad mother.)\n\n68. Die Büchse der Pandora öffnen\n\nLiteral Translation – Open Pandora's box\n\nEnglish Meaning – Open Pandora's box\n\nHere's one of those German idioms you'll probably recognize from its English counterpart. When you open Pandora's box, you're likely to set off a chain reaction, whether that's for the better or worse.\n\nWie oft muss du noch die Büchse der Pandora öffnen? (How many more times do you have to reopen Pandora's box?)\n\n69. Sich ins gemachte Nest setzen\n\nLiteral Translation – Sit in the made nest.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Have it made.\n\nWhether you marry rich or are born with a silver spoon in your mouth, the idea behind this German idiom is that you can just sit back and relax in the nest someone else made. The phrase comes from the actions of the cuckoo bird, which steals pre-built nests from other birds instead of making its own. You can use this expression in various ways.\n\nSie hat sich ins gemachte Nest gesetzt. (She married for money.)\n\nWir haben die ganze Arbeit gemacht. Sie hat sich einfach ins gemachte Nest gesetzt. (We did all the work. She just rode along on our success.)\n\n70. Einen Eiertanz aufführen\n\nLiteral Translation – Perform an egg dance.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Walk on eggshells.\n\nA story from Goethe describes a scene with a floor full of eggs and a girl who danced carefully through them without touching a single one. Now, the idiom often depicts how careful you have to be around susceptible subjects or people.\n\nSie führt immer einen Eiertanz auf weil sie niemanden auf die Füße treten will. (She always walks on eggshells because she doesn't want to offend anyone.)\n\n71. Den Kürzeren ziehen\n\nLiteral Translation – Pull the shorter one.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Get the short end of the stick.\n\nWhere there's a winner and a loser, the loser typically ends up with the short end of the stick.

This idiom describes someone disadvantaged, short-changed, or who had bad luck.\n\nJedes mal ziehst du den Kürzeren. (You lose every time.)\n\n72. Wie du in den Wald hineinrufst, so schallt's heraus\n\nLiteral Translation – The forest echos back what you shout into it.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Treat others how you want to be treated.\n\nSimilar to “you reap what you sow,” this German idiom serves as a reminder that what goes around comes around.\n\nBevor du die Beherrschung verlierst, denke daran, dass hier gilt: wie man in den Wald hineinruft, so schallt es heraus. (Before you lose control, remember the rule that what goes around comes around.)\n\n73. Jemanden den Hof machen\n\nLiteral Translation – Make someone's farm.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Court someone\n\nWhen love is in the air, an interested person may decide to woo that special someone with dates, gifts, and other thoughtful gestures.

(He gifted me flowers and chocolate! He's really making an effort to court me.)\n\n74. Viele Wege führen nach Rom\n\nLiteral Translation – Many roads lead to Rome.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Many roads lead to Rome.\n\nThere's more than one way to get something done, which is meant in this following idiom. This is one of those German idioms that's nearly identical to the English saying, this expression means there could be multiple solutions to a challenge.\n\nMan weiß nie. Eine neue Denkweise könnte die Lösung sein. Viele wege führen nach Rom. (You never know. A new way of thinking could be the solution. Many roads lead to Rome.)\n\n75.

Sich die Hörner abstoßen\n\nLiteral Translation – Shed one's horns.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Let one's guard down.\n\nSomeone who's feeling uptight and unrelaxed might need to let their guard down, or in German, shed their horns.

By shedding them, you're ready to have fun, go wild, and let loose.\n\nDie Studenten wollen sich die Hörner abstoßen bevor Semesterbeginn. (The students want to have some fun before the new semester begins.)\n\n77. Den Faden verlieren\n\nLiteral Translation – Lose the thread.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Lose your train of thought.\n\nIf you start to tell a story and forget your point mid-way through, you may have lost the thread in German. In English, you'd say you lost your train of thought or got derailed.\n\nLass uns nicht den Faden verlieren. (Let's not get off-track.)\n\n78. In Teufels Küche kommen\n\nLiteral Translation – Come into the devil's kitchen.\n\nEnglish Meaning – Be in a sticky situation.\n\nThe devil's kitchen isn't a safe place to be, which makes this reference a suitable way to say you're in deep trouble.\n\nWir kommen alle in Teufels Küche mit deinem Fehlverhalten.
