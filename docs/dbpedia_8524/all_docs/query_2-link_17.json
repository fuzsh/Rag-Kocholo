Being on time to a meeting actually means getting there 10 minutes beforehand just to make sure you’re ready to go. In the German culture tardiness is no laughing matter. To many Germans, being on time is considered a sign of respect towards other people’s time. That being said, it’s key for learners of the German language to master this concept in order to avoid any potential pitfalls when immersing yourself in German culture.\n\nTelling the time is important in most cultures, and telling the time in German offers no exception. Having a firm grasp on how to tell the time in German allows you to function in a German-speaking environment and avoids potential confusion.\n\nLet’s get started now and we’ll make sure you increase your knowledge on all of the following:\n\n● What do you need to say in German to ask for the time\n\n● What you need to know and understand to tell the time in German\n\n● The intricacies of German punctuality\n\nLos geht’s! – Let’s go!\n\nNote: We're only covering the German spoken in Germany in this article, and not in other German-speaking countries, which may present some subtle differences.\n\nKnowing how to ask for the time in German\n\nAt this point in your studies of the language, you’ve likely encountered the most common phrases in German. We’ll focus on the most important phrases when it comes to learning the time:\n\n● Wie viel Uhr ist es? – What time is it?\n\n● Wie spät ist es? – What time is it?\n\nSo if you find yourself walking through the streets of Munich and you’d like to know what time it is, you could ask someone:\n\n● Entschuldigung, wie viel Uhr ist es? – Excuse me, what time is it?\n\n● Können Sie/kannst du mir sagen, wie spät es ist? – Could you tell me what time it is?\n\nDepending on your pronunciation and confidence in your German skills, the person is likely to hold their watch so you can see the time. If this is not what they do and they tell you the time out loud, you’ll be ready to understand them by continuing to read this post.\n\nHow to tell the time in German\n\nTelling the time has its challenges in German, but read on for some awesome tips and tricks to make this learning experience a breeze.\n\n● We use the verb “sein” (to be) when saying what time it is.\n\n● So, we give the time using “es ist...” (it is...o’clock).\n\nHere is the full list of all the hours in German:\n\n● It’s one o’clock. – Es ist ein Uhr.\n\n● It’s two o'clock. – Es is zwei Uhr.\n\n● It’s three o’clock. – Es ist drei Uhr.\n\n● It’s four o’clock. – Es ist vier Uhr.\n\n● It’s five o’clock. – Es ist fünf Uhr.\n\n● It’s six o’clock. – Es ist sechs Uhr.\n\n● It’s seven o’clock. – Es ist sieben Uhr.\n\n● It’s eight o’clock. – Es ist acht Uhr.\n\n● It’s nine o’clock. – Es ist neun Uhr.\n\n● It’s ten o’clock. – Es ist zehn Uhr.\n\n● It’s eleven o’clock. – Es ist elf Uhr.\n\n● It’s twelve o’clock. – Es ist zwölf Uhr.\n\nWhen we speak German, we typically use the 12-hour clock, which is considered less formal. However, the 24-hour clock is much more common when you encounter times in written German. When you learn German, you should keep in mind that it does not use the AM or PM distinction.\n\nYou can use one of the following phrases to avoid any confusion:\n\n● morgens – in the morning. This is any time before noon. For example: Ich gehe morgens um acht Uhr in die Schule.\n\n● nachmittags – in the afternoon. This refers to any time after noon. For example: Ich spiele um drei Uhr nachmittags Tennis.\n\n● abends – in the evening. Abends refers to the evening hours. Example: Ich gehe um sechs Uhr abends Eis essen.\n\n● nachts – at night. This refers to any hours during the night. Example: Ich gehe nachts um elf Uhr ins Bett.\n\nYou also need to know that 12:00 noon and 12:00 at night are referred to as Mittag and Mitternacht, respectively.\n\n● Mittag – midday/noon (note that, as an indication of time, no article is needed)\n\n● Mitternacht – midnight (please note that, as an indication of time, no article is needed)\n\nHere are a few other key words that are essential to understand when it comes to time:\n\n● um – Is equal to the English word “at” and signifies when exactly you are doing something, such as: “Wir treffen uns um vier Uhr” (We are meeting at four).\n\n● And the word we use to ask about the time in German is “wann?”\n\n○ Example: Wann essen wir Kuchen? --- Um ein Uhr nachmittags."
