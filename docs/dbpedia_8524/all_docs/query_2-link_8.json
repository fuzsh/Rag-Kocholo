        "text": "Throughout a typical 24-hour cycle in Germany, you will find consistent cause to refer to different times of the day in German. When do you need to get up? When will you go to work, or plan to meet up with friends?\n\nFrom ancient times to today, daylight has influenced the daily structure of events in Germany and elsewhere across the globe. Understandably, words describing concepts like “day” and “night” are vital in discussions and planning. If you’re keen on mastering time expressions (or just getting around) in German, keep reading.\n\nTimes of the day in Germany: Useful vocabulary\n\nHow to use German time expressions correctly\n\nTimes of the day in Germany: Useful vocabulary\n\nTo make the most of valuable daylight, it’s best to be mindful of how quickly time slips away. This isn’t a principle limited to efficiency-minded Germans; across various cultures and languages, the day is typically divided into distinct time intervals. In German, these are:\n\nWhile these German time expressions highlight the general parts of the day, there are also words to pinpoint a more precise time without relying on a clock:\n\nHow to use German time expressions in context\n\nTime is an important matter and even absolute beginners will have to talk about it. Let’s learn about general time phrases like nachmittags (afternoon) and practice talking about specific times of the day.\n\nIndefinite time expressions\n\nIndefinite time expressions are vague time references without specific details. Examples in English include “sometimes,” “often” and “rarely.” You can also point to a time of the day (or, rather, a day) without specifying the day itself:\n\nEines Morgens erhielt sie einen Anruf. (One morning she received a call.)\n\nEines Tages packe ich meine Sachen und gehe. (One day I’ll pack my things and leave.)\n\nIndefinite time is in the genitive and uses the indefinite article.\n\nNote: Die Nacht (night) is feminine, but uses the male form of the indefinite article in indefinite time expressions:\n\nEines Nachts klopfte es an die Tür. (One night there was a knock on the door.)\n\nDefinite time expressions without prepositions\n\nDefinite time expressions without prepositions pinpoint a specific time without additional location indicators. Instead, they are accompanied by an adjective narrowing down the point of time:\n\nLetzte Nacht hat es geregnet. (It rained last night.)\n\nMorgen früh gehe ich nicht zur Arbeit. (I’m not going to work in the morning.)\n\nEr war den ganzen Abend zu Hause. (He was at home all evening.)\n\nIch gehe jeden Morgen laufen. (I go for a run every morning.)\n\nDefinite time expressions without prepositions are in the accusative.\n\nDefinite time expressions with prepositions\n\nDefinite time expressions with prepositions provide specific details about when an action occurs by using additional location indicators. Don’t forget to choose the grammatical case of the time of the day according to the preposition:\n\nAn (at), in (at/during), vor (before), seit (since), nach (after) + dative:\n\nIch gehe am Mittag nach Hause. (I’m going home at lunchtime.)\n\nIn der Nacht war es kalt. (It was very cold at/during the night.)\n\nIch war vor Sonnenaufgang zu Hause. (I was home before sunrise.)\n\nIch bin seit heute Morgen auf den Beinen. (I’ve been on my feet since this morning.)\n\nNach dieser Nacht werde ich nie wieder trinken. (After that night, I will never drink again.)\n\nNote: An (at), in (at/during) and vor (before) are so-called two-way prepositions that can take the dative or the accusative. With time expressions, they always take the dative.\n\nGegen (towards), für, um + accusative:\n\nGegen Abend wird es schnell dunkel. (It gets dark quickly towards evening.)\n\nFür den Morgen ist Schnee gemeldet. (Snow is reported for the morning.)\n\nUm Mitternacht gibt es ein Feuerwerk. (At midnight, there is a fireworks display.)\n\nWährend (during) + genitive:\n\nWährend der Nacht gab es einen Sturm. (There was a storm during the night.)\n\nIf you have to give a lot of information in one sentence involving a general time, a definite time and a place, remember this: Time before place, and general time before specific time! For example:\n\nEines Tages werde ich dich zum Schwimmen um Mitternacht in meinen Pool einladen. (One day I will invite you for a midnight swim in my pool.)\n\nThe importance of the times of the day in German\n\nGerman, much like English, employs distinct words for various times of the day.\n\nUnderstanding both indefinite and definite time expressions is key for understanding what is happening when. For instance, Heute Morgen denotes “this morning” in German, while morgens means “every morning.”\n\nIf you need some extra motivation to master these nuances, think about this: Would you rather get up early just this morning, or every morning?"
