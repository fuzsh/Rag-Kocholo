With the Blick am Abend application, the Blick Group is continuing its digital offensive, Ringier wrote in a statement on Thursday. The focus of the application is on entertainment for commuters and includes selected news, games to pass the time and the most important information on TV, cinema and events for after-work planning.

The integration of all current SBB disruption information should help commuters make arrangements to get to their destination on time. Well-known features like weather and horoscope, as well as the PDF of Blick am Abend are also included.
