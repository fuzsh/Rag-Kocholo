During his time in office, California’s unemployment rate dropped to a record low, nearly 3 million new jobs were added, and healthcare coverage expanded to millions more Californians. Guided by his leadership, the state enacted far-reaching reforms, including in criminal justice, immigration, workers’ compensation, water, pension, education, housing and economic development reforms. California also established comprehensive targets to protect the environment and fight climate change. Brown currently serves as chair of the California-China Climate Institute housed at UC Berkeley; executive chair of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists; board member of the Nuclear Threat Initiative; and farmer on land settled by his great-grandfather more than 150 years ago.\n\nRichard Falk\n\nRichard Falk is a professor emeritus of international law at Princeton University, and the Euro-Mediterranean Human Rights Monitor’s Chairman of the Board of Trustees. In 2008, the United Nations Human Rights Council appointed him to a six-year term as a UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in the Palestinian territories occupied since 1967. He is the author or co-author of more than 20 books. His memoir, Public Intellectual: The Life of a Citizen Pilgrim, was published this last year.\n\nCynthia Lazaroff\n\nCynthia Lazaroff is an award-winning documentary filmmaker and founder of Women Transforming Our Nuclear Legacy. She is the author of Dawn of a New Armageddon, a personal account of the Hawaii missile scare, published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists on August 6, 2018. An expert on US-Russia relations, including on the history, geopolitics, military, cyber and escalating nuclear risks between these two countries, Cynthia has been engaged in Track II citizen diplomacy and mediation efforts with Russia since the early 1980s.\n\nWatch the video of this event.\n\nNuclear Dangers in Ukraine\n\nSecond in our Zoom Series\n\nWITH NOAM CHOMSKY AND DANIEL ELLSBERG\n\nCo-hosts Cynthia Lazaroff and Richard Falk\n\nFriday, April 29, 2022\n\n12:00 pm PT | 3:00 pm ET | 8:00 pm CET\n\nWatch the video of this event.\n\nABOUT THE PARTICIPANTS:\n\nNoam Chomsky\n\nPhilosopher, cognitive scientist, linguist, political commentator, and lifelong activist, Chomsky is arguably the single most influential scholar in the world today. He is a sharp critic of American foreign policy and an anarchist who believes in creating a radically different, more just society. Chomsky is the author of more than 100 books, his most recent, Requiem for the American Dream: The 10 Principles of Concentration of Wealth & Power, was published in 2017. At the age of 93, knowing his voice still needs to be heard during this critical time, Chomsky hasn’t retreated from the world stage, contending, “We’re approaching the most dangerous point in human history and are now facing the prospect of the destruction of organized human life on Earth.”\n\nDaniel Ellsberg\n\nDaniel Ellsberg, known to many as the original whistleblower, in 1971 released the Pentagon Papers, a top-secret study of the US government’s decision-making in the Vietnam War. He was charged under the Espionage Act of 1917, along with charges of theft and conspiracy, carrying a maximum sentence of 115 years. Because of governmental misconduct, illegal evidence-gathering, and a stellar defense team, all charges against Ellsberg were dismissed on May 11, 1973. He is the author of four books, the latest published in 2017 entitled The Doomsday Machine: Confessions of a Nuclear War Planner. Ellsberg was awarded the 2006 Right Livelihood Award “…for putting peace and truth first, at considerable personal risk, and dedicating his life to inspiring others to follow his example.”\n\nCynthia Lazaroff\n\nCynthia Lazaroff is an award-winning documentary filmmaker and founder of Women Transforming Our Nuclear Legacy. She is the author of Dawn of a New Armageddon, a personal account of the Hawaii missile scare, published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists on August 6, 2018.
