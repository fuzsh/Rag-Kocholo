        "text": "Henry's Memorial Page\n\nHenry Martin Hellman of Lowell, Indiana, Professor Emeritus of Chemistry at New York University, died on Thursday, November 3, 2005. He was 85.\n\nHenry Hellman was the beloved husband of the late Isabel (née Paul) Hellman. He was born on July 4, 1920 in Gamla Nordsjö, Sweden, the son of the late Karl and Mathilda Hellman. He immigrated to the US with his family in 1927, arriving in New York harbor on the Fourth of July; he was told the fireworks were for his birthday. The family settled in Gary, Indiana. He received a B.S. from Indiana University in 1943 and a Ph.D. in Chemistry from Purdue University in 1947. He joined the Department of Chemistry at NYU as an instructor the same year, bringing with him the latest ideas in the area of physical organic chemistry. He was promoted to Assistant Professor in 1950, Associate Professor in 1961 and Full Professor in 1969. He served as Chairman of the Department from 1966 to 1970 and is remembered as a dedicated teacher by generations of NYU students.\n\nHellman is survived by sister Maria Hellman-Näslund of Umeå, Sweden and brother Bertil Hellman of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. He was the adored uncle and great-uncle of many nieces and nephews, many of whom were touched by his love for music, culture, learning and science."
