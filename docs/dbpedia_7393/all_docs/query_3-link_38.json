        "text": "The following is a statement from Verified Voting. For additional press inquiries, please contact aurora@newheightscommunications.com\n\nPHILADELPHIA (March 4, 2021) – Verified Voting, a leading national organization whose mission is to strengthen democracy for all voters by promoting the responsible use of technology in elections, welcomes Prof. Martin Hellman to its Board of Directors. Hellman previously served on Verified Voting’s Board of Advisors and is currently Professor Emeritus of Electrical Engineering at Stanford University.\n\n“Martin Hellman is a deeply respected expert on computer security and cryptography,” said Barbara Simons, Verified Voting’s Board Chair. “We’re excited to welcome Marty to the Board of Directors as we advance our mission in this important moment for election protection work.”\n\nProf. Hellman is best known for his invention, with Diffie and Merkle, of public key cryptography. This technology allows electronic banking and other secure transactions on the Internet, and protects literally trillions of dollars daily. Prof. Hellman has been a long-time contributor to the computer security debate, starting with his efforts in the mid 1970s to improve the security level of the Data Encryption Standard (DES). In the mid 1990s he served on the National Research Council’s Committee to Study National Cryptographic Policy, whose main recommendations have since been implemented. His current project focuses on reducing the unacceptable level of risk inherent in nuclear deterrence. Prof. Hellman’s many awards include the ACM Turing Award, which is the highest distinction in computer science and considered the “Nobel Prize of Computing”; election to the National Academy of Engineering; induction as an inaugural member of the Cyber Security Hall of Fame; EFF’s Pioneer Award; and three “outstanding professor” awards from minority student organizations.\n\nView the full list of Verified Voting Board of Directors and Board of Advisors here.\n\n###"
