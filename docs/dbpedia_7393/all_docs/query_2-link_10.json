        "text": "Unqualified Presidents that were Former Comedians are not going to make a Joke out of the hard work of Europeans and Americans hard earned money to defend a land that isn‚Äôt theirs to begin with. Enough is enough! No we are no longer sending any money or military help to UKRAINE. Zelensky must learn to use his head for peace not war, even if it‚Äôs giving up land to Russia. My message to Zelensky: Put your own head in the Guillotine. Not the entire Worlds! You had stolen enough Zelensky! Your acting skills aren‚Äôt convincing anymore petreying you and your county as victims. The only real victims are all the countries that came in solidarity with your nonsense wars that lead no where other to more money for you. You should go to prison for stealing $200 billion dollars from our Planet‚Äôs hard working humans. Unqualified Presidents like Joe Biden that clearly can't think straight due to his worsening dementia, cognitive degradation, and memory loss as exhibited during the debate (where he wasn't allowed to have teleprompters) and his policies have hurt the economy, caused hyperinflation, and his border policies along with his weakness/incompetence have emboldened all of our enemies and lessened our national security. He appears to only be a puppet who can only read speeches (written by his handlers) from teleprompters to falsely appear to be competent, but note that he often has to be led off of the stage by someone else because he doesn't know where to go or how to exit the stage. I am scared for our country if Joe has to make any fast critical decisions in a crisis. I don't think he is the one making such decisions which begs the question who is running our country? Joe Biden should go to a prison too for sending money without authorization to a country that doesn‚Äôt need it. All Ukrainians needed to do is talk with Putin and see how they will split the cake and who gets the cherry on top. And leave all the other countries out. Americans and European Union only get the brown whip cream üí© out of this nonsense wars! Lesson Learned for Future Generations: No Commedians should ever be elected as President of any country. Sorry, but the life of people isn‚Äôt a joke. And the life of millions is in the hands of a President. And a comedian would never understand the seriousness of this. No OLDER MEN with Dementia should be allowed to be Presidents. I even believe that 70 years of age should be the maximum age limit in Government Positions to ensure the well being of the younger population. Older men are resentful in their lives and want to bring the same misery onto others. Therefore, is dangerous ‚ö†Ô∏è to havd them in office. Sincerely, Alicia Valdes President & CEO Global Eco Army Global Eco Navy Global Eco Air Force Global Eco Space Force https://lnkd.in/eER2ikNq\n\nThe drums of war are beating again. And the government and media are conditioning the people again that war is inevitable. (as long as it's \"over there\") For the umpteenth time, WHO is declaring war? Certainly NOT CONGRESS, which is supposed to be our only body to legally do so. No. We don't declare war anymore. It's all \"police actions\", or we are \"supporting\" allies in conflicts that themselves may or may not be declared. All because we the people have been gradually and quietly convinced to allow our Executive Branch gather and wield more and more power unconstitutionally. It is now approaching the level of an Authoritarian State and we MUSH take steps to reestablish the balance between our three branches of government for which our Constitution was designed.\n\nWe welcome that President Biden declared opposition to a full scale invasion of Rafah and indicated a willingness to restrict the flow of offensive weapons that he acknowledged have been used to kill innocent civilians. Talk is one thing, action is another. Morally, politically and strategically, Biden must make sure he follows through on these declarations and uses significant US leverage to halt the slaughter that Israel has perpetuated and plans to greatly expand. If Biden had adopted this position earlier, tens of thousands of lives could have been saved. And by adopting it now, tens of thousands of people alive today could survive this horrific war who would not otherwise if Israel continues its assault on Rafah. This is why there have been consistent protests in the US throughout this war, which have shamefully resulted in the arrests of thousands of students and supporters demanding an end to US complicity in slaughter. Biden can and must secure a ceasefire now.\n\nWell, a it‚Äôs a very sad way for 2023 to end but it has been coming since the now infamous escalator ride by trump. The Republican Party is now fully committed to destroying American democracy. Our allies, against the world‚Äôs most dangerous, genocidal thug are being denied aid because the GOP, subservient to trump, Putin and a suitcase full of conspiracy theories are now doing all possible with the tiny U.S. House of Representatives majority to ignore every single responsible act regarding US security. 1. They refuse funding Ukrainian patriots, fighting and dying so that the US and NATO don‚Äôt have to. 2. They equate the southern border issues as an equivalent threat to Putin, who holds the most nukes and is allied to Xi. Both are genocidal aggressors and have immense nuclear arsenals 3. They are hellbent of overturning our constitutional rights, in favor of a White Christian Nationalist theocracy like Iran‚Äôs and the Taliban. Worse, they are incapable of unscrewing themselves because they have allowed the party to be influenced by a combination of Russian, oligarchical and immoral US influencers so that they now meet the description of being ‚Äúreflexively controlled‚Äù by now Russian but formerly Soviet influencers. To make matters worse, the US national security community refuses to ‚Äúunscrew‚Äù themselves and work intelligently towards the large number of required solutions to protect the homeland from malign influence. WTF/ WTH/ National Security Council, The White House Office of the Secretary of Defense Office of the Director of National Intelligence Today‚Äôs GOP‚Ä¶ is traitorous. https://lnkd.in/g5bwdHFY\n\nUsing the \"no win\" analogy/mindset currently in this travesty is not applicable at all. I could possibly, kind of (not really) see how this thought process would make sense say back in November of 2023 about a month into this insanity; while things were still being figured out and before boots were on the ground to confirm such sadistic acts. But not now, not EIGHT months later, not after the UN, the ICC, the ICJ, and multiple genocide experts have condemned Israel and demanded they stop their genocidal acts. If Biden had an ounce of humanity or morality left, after the initial ICJ hearing he would have publicly denounced Israel, apologized to the Arab and muslim community and cut off support to Israel. Today after EIGHT months, after Israel just defied the ICC courts orders, and bombed a refugee camp made up of tents in Rafah; if Biden had even an ounce of humanity or empathy left he would have publicly declared that he is sending in military forces to remove Netanyahu and his cabinet from power. We are way past looking weak, saving face, making public statements or speeches that will help garner votes in November. We are simply at America, \"the leader of the free world\", \"the most powerful country in the world\", showing the international community genocide can never be tolerated, no matter the circumstances. We mean this, because we are using our governance capability to stop one of our allies from relentlessly persisting in carrying out such abhorrent acts. Plain and simple. After eight months, after various independent bodies advice and input; you could us their declarations to alleviate any blowback you might receive from genocidal zionist associates, to put an end to this insanity now. If America ever wanted their input in the humanitarian world to mean something in the future, they would show the world we are removing ourselves from this madness and are now actively working to stop it. There is no contemplation in genocide, no thinking win-win or lose-lose, you just use all resources to stop it.\n\nAgain, we have been lied to! Where is the American Citizen?! Patrick Lawrence details, in conjunction with an article by former CIA analyst John Kiriako, how our USG has, in fact, over the years, provoked a nuclear-armed Russia with its activities in the Ukraine. And Ukraine is not a democracy! If you are a retired military officer, is it your duty to keep your mouth shut or to voice opposition to what is destroying the American Constitutional Republic‚Äîthe Constitution each of us swore to defend? We did not swear to defend the Military Industrial Congressional Complex or a person, but we promised to protect the American Constitutional Republic and its Constitution. How is supporting this Ukraine Lie supporting our Constitution? We have lied to once again Afghanistan, Iraq, etc.‚Ä¶ With the Ukraine loss, will it again be nothing to see here as our liberal Hegemonists seek their next target to bring democracy, too? How can we survive as a republic with no accountability and wars that are not in the American National Security interest but instead for the benefit of American Grifters, parading as Patriots? Founder John Jay in Federalist #4 distinguishes between wars of interest and pretense. \"But the safety of the people of America against dangers from foreign force depends not only on their forbearing to give just causes for war to other nations, but also on their placing and continuing themselves in such a situation as not to invite hostility or insult; for it need not be observed, that there are pretended as well as just causes of war. It is too true, however disgraceful it may be to human nature, that nations, in general, will make war whenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it; nay, that absolute monarchs will often make war when their nations are to get nothing by it, but for purposes and objects merely personal, such as a thirst for military glory, revenge for personal affronts, ambition, or private compacts to aggrandize or support their particular families or partisans. https://lnkd.in/e44BKqtJ"
