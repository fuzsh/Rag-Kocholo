The proposed signature scheme is not only asymptotically almost compact but also practical for concrete ...\n\nPublic-key encryption scheme with selective opening chosen-ciphertext security based on the Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption\n\nChosen-ciphertext security has been well-accepted as a standard security notion for public-key encryption. But in a multi-user surrounding, it may not be sufficient, because the adversary may corrupt some users to obtain the random coins as well as the ...\n\nThe Twin Diffie–Hellman Problem and Applications\n\nWe propose a new computational problem called the twin Diffie–Hellman problem. This problem is closely related to the usual (computational) Diffie–Hellman problem and can be used in many of the same cryptographic constructions that are based on the ...\n\nInformation & Contributors\n\nInformation\n\nPublished In\n\n558 pages\n\nISBN:9781450398275\n\nDOI:10.1145/3549993\n\nEditor:\n\nRebecca Slayton\n\nCornell University\n\nPublisher\n\nAssociation for Computing Machinery\n\nNew York, NY, United States\n\nPublication History\n\nPublished: 26 August 2022\n\nPermissions\n\nRequest permissions for this article.\n\nCheck for updates\n\nQualifiers\n\nChapter\n\nAppears in\n\nContributors\n\nOther Metrics\n\nBibliometrics & Citations\n\nBibliometrics\n\nArticle Metrics\n\n0\n\nTotal Citations\n\n4\n\nTotal Downloads\n\nDownloads (Last 12 months)1\n\nDownloads (Last 6 weeks)0\n\nOther Metrics\n\nCitations\n\nView Options\n\nGet Access\n\nLogin options\n\nCheck if you have access through your login credentials or your institution to get full access on this article.\n\nSign in\n\nFull Access\n\nView options\n\nPDF\n\nView or Download as a PDF file.\n\nPDF\n\neReader\n\nView online with eReader.\n\neReader\n\nMedia\n\nFigures\n\nOther\n\nTables\n\nShare\n\nShare\n\nShare this Publication link\n\nCopied!\n\nCopying failed.\n\nShare on social media\n\nAffiliations\n\nSusan Landau\n\nRequest permissions Authors Info & Affiliations"
