        "text": "In computing, the equivalent of the Nobel prize is the ACM Turing Award. Yesterday, the winners of the Turing Award for 2015 got announced. The award goes to Whitfield Diffie and Martin E. Hellman for their invention of public-key cryptography and digital signatures. This invention in the 1970s truly revolutionized computer security. (http://amturing.acm.org/)\n\nWe all use their invention daily in many applications without noticing really. The Diffie-Hellman key-exchange protocol belongs to the staple protocols with a variety of uses.\n\nStill today, when one comes across the idea of public-key cryptography for the first time, one gets totally amazed about the beauty of this invention. If you do not know what I mean here, just look up any of the many explanations you can find on the web.\n\nI got to know about this invention in the early 1980s. My colleague Emo Welzl told me over a coffee about this amazing invention: ‚ÄúCan you imagine that two people can agree on a secret number by publicly shouting out numbers? Although everyone else around knows the rules of the game and hears the numbers, they do not get to know the secret number.‚Äù I considered this story ‚Äúunbelievable‚Äù; this got me hooked into cryptography; until now. As many of you know, I work with IAIK and our main research topic has been information security since almost 30 years now.\n\nThese days we talk a lot about the whistle blower Edward Snowden and all the dirty tricks of NSA we got to know. The fight between military use and civil use of cryptography has been going on since the invention of public-key cryptography by Diffie/Hellman (and others). This discussion is by far not over. Just now, the discussion between Apple and FBA about decrypting the contents of an iPhone is rather loud in the media.\n\nIn the early 1990s, this discussion had the name ‚ÄúBattle of the Clipper Chip‚Äù. The US government then wanted to install a crypto chip with a backdoor in all computer devices. According to The New York Times, this was the first holy war of the information highway.\n\nIn this discussion over the Clipper Chip, Steward Baker ‚Äî then the General Counsel of the NSA ‚Äî said the following memorable sentence about the inventors of public-key cryptography:\n\n‚ÄúThis is the revenge of people who couldn‚Äôt go to Woodstock because they had too much trigonometry homework.‚Äù\n\nRead the article in The New York Times here: http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/12/magazine/battle-of-the-clipper-chip.html?pagewanted=all\n\nWith their invention of public-key cryptography, Diffie and Hellman have contributed not only to the science of computing, but a lot more to the understanding of privacy, a basic human right.\n\nThe until then mostly ‚Äúuseless‚Äù and pure mathematical art of number theory suddenly became useful.\n\nCopyright notice: The picture of Whitfield Diffie is a screenshot from a video from the RSA Conference with the title ‚ÄúCryptographers‚Äô Panel 2015‚Äù (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9RtZrNPP26w). The picture of Martin Hellman is a screenshot from a video by the Stanford University School of Engineering with the title ‚ÄúStanford Engineering Hero Martin Hellman on inventing cryptography‚Äù (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=caoDRvR2Jo8).\n\nToday I prepared tomorrow‚Äôs class in Rechnerorganisation. I am going to present my thoughts about assignment 3 and 4.\n\nLet me describe what happened:\n\nIn assignment 2, the students have built a synchronous automaton which can compute modular multiplication. They are going to use this digital circuit as a co-processor together with CPU, RAM, and I/O in order to compute modular exponentiation in the following assignments. In these assignments they are going to learn to model synchronous digital systems using Verilog.\n\nI had in mind to use modular exponentiations as the prototype example for our research in IT-security at IAIK.\n\nExponentiation is usually done by a sequence of squaring and multiplication operations, usually referred to as the ‚Äúsquare-and-multiply algorithm‚Äù. In order to find some background information about the ‚Äúright-to-left‚Äù version of this algorithm, I ended up in Samarqand, the capital of Uzbekistan. The Persian mathematician and astronomer Jamshƒ´d al-KƒÅshƒ´ ( ÿ¨ŸÖÿ¥€åÿØ ⁄©ÿßÿ¥ÿßŸÜ€å‚Äé) lived there when he published his famous book ‚ÄúKey to Arithmetic‚Äù in the year 1427. Check out this link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamsh%C4%ABd_al-K%C4%81sh%C4%AB\n\nal-KƒÅshƒ´ invented the right-to-left square-and-multiply algorithm. He also determined 16 decimal digits of Pi. In case you want to know more about him, check out http://www.jphogendijk.nl/arabsci/Dold1.pdf or http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Al-Kashi.html\n\nThe reason for studying modular exponentiation comes from cryptography. I thought that I help my students jump right into this field by exposing them to the basics of public-key cryptography. One of my heroes in this arena is Whitfield Diffie (http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitfield_Diffie) , one of the inventors of public-key cryptography. If you see a photo of him you immediately think of the hippie era in the late sixties. They say that the invention of public-key crypto was the revenge of those youngsters who were not allowed to go to the Woodstock Festival in 1969, but rather had to study math instead. üôÇ\n\nI had a dysfunctional guitar amplifier in 1969, and I hated to be unable to repair it. I wanted to play Jimi Hendrix, but couldn‚Äôt. This heavily influenced my decision to study electrical engineering at TU Graz soon afterwards. And this brought me finally here where I teach computers to students.\n\nWhile I am writing this text, I am chewing on the best chocolate of the world from my Persian friend Massoud who I visited in Stockholm on Saturday. I wonder whether Jamshƒ´d al-KƒÅshƒ´ also knew chocolate. Working in science and technology is fun, I must say. From Samarqand to Woodstock to Stockholm to Graz.\n\nIt is a real pity to read that 55% of all Austrians are ‚Äúnot interested‚Äù in developments in science and technology: http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_401_fact_at_en.pdf\n\nIt is so much fun, I think.\n\nBy the way: In my other home country, Sweden, 23% of all citizens are ‚Äúnot interested‚Äù in science and technology (http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/ebs/ebs_401_fact_se_en.pdf). What a difference!\n\nThe photo above does not show Samarqand. Not Woodstock either. Any guesses?"
