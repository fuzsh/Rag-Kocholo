        "text": "Hellman and Whitfield Diffie were awarded theÂ ACMâs 2015 Turing Award, often called âThe Nobel Prize of Computer Scienceâ for their invention of public-key cryptography and digital signatures, a fundamental contribution to modern cryptography that now underlines security for the global digital economy, which transfers trillions of dollars a day.\n\nHellmanâs work has also been recognized by a number of other international honors and awards, including election to theÂ National Academy of Engineering, induction to theÂ National Inventorâs Hall of Fame, theÂ Marconi International Fellowship, theÂ IEEE Hamming Medal, theÂ Franklin Instituteâs Louis E. Levy Medal, and more.\n\nHellman and his wife Dorothie recently recently completed a book,Â A New Map for Relationships: Creating True Love at Home & Peace on the Planet. Detailing Martin and Dorothieâs work on global issues, their work finds critical parallels between the process of improving martial and interpersonal relations with that of international relations and modern diplomatic strategy. It has won praise from prominent individuals including former United States Secretary of DefenseÂ William Perry, who called the book an âengaging and persuasive story relating domestic peace to world peace.â\n\nDuring the Cold War, Hellman helped drive an unprecedented dialog between Soviet and Western scientific communities on the need for peace in the nuclear age. This effort culminated in Hellmanâs co-editing ofÂ Breakthrough: Emerging New Thinking with Soviet Professor Anatoly Gromyko. The work, a cooperation between over 30 leading Western and Soviet scholars, was an evidenced-based roadmap to peaceful global relations, leading to a future society âbeyond war.â Breakthrough received critical acclaim from individuals ranging from Soviet PresidentÂ Mikhail GorbachevÂ to CIA DirectorÂ William Colby.\n\nHellmanâs work in nuclear strategy and international relations is also highlighted by his authorship ofÂ Diffusing the Nuclear Threat, a risk-analysis to the potential failure of nuclear deterrence. Various aspects of the project have been endorsed by the President Emeritus of Stanford University and Former Head of the FDA, two Nobel laureates, Former Secretary of Defense William Perry, Former Secretary of StateÂ George Shultz, and Retired Supreme Court JusticeÂ Sandra Day OâConnor, among others."
