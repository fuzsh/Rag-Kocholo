        "text": "Cryptography Guru Martin Hellman Urges International Cooperation on AI, Security: Martin Hellman \"achieved legendary status as co-inventor of the Diffie-Hellman public key exchange algorithm, a breakthrough in software and computer cryptography,\" notes a new interview in InfoWorld. Nine years after winning the Turing award, the 78-year-old cryptologist shared his perspective on some other issues: What do you think about the state of digital spying today? Hellman: There's a need for greater international cooperation. How can we have true cyber security when nations are planning — and implementing — cyber attacks on one another? How can we ensure that AI is used only for good when nations are building it into their weapons systems? Then, there's the grandaddy of all technological threats, nuclear weapons. If we keep fighting wars, it's only a matter of time before one blows up. The highly unacceptable level of nuclear risk highlights the need to look at the choices we make around critical decisions, including cyber security. We have to take into consideration all participants' needs for our strategies to be effective.... Your battle with the government to make private communication available to the general public in the digital age has the status of folklore. But, in your recent book (co-authored with your wife Dorothie [and freely available as a PDF]), you describe a meeting of minds with Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, former head of the NSA. Until I read your book, I saw the National Security Agency as bad and Diffie-Hellman as good, plain and simple. You describe how you came to see the NSA and its people as sincere actors rather than as a cynical cabal bent on repression. What changed your perspective? Hellman: This is a great, real-life example of how taking a holistic view in a conflict, instead of just a one-sided one, resolved an apparently intractable impasse. Those insights were part of a major change in my approach to life. As we say in our book, \"Get curious, not furious.\" These ideas are effective not just in highly visible conflicts like ours with the NSA, but in every aspect of life. Hellman also had an interesting answer when asked if math, game theory, and software development teach any lessons applicable to issues like nuclear non-proliferation or national defense. \"The main thing to learn is that the narrative we (and other nations) tell ourselves is overly simplified and tends to make us look good and our adversaries bad.\" Read more of this story at Slashdot.\n\nCryptography Guru Martin Hellman Urges International Cooperation on AI, Security: Martin Hellman \"achieved legendary status as co-inventor of the Diffie-Hellman public key exchange algorithm, a breakthrough in software and computer cryptography,\" notes a new interview in InfoWorld.

It's not just a buzzword; it's a reality knocking on our doors. The shift to quantum-resistant technologies is not just important; it's imminent. 💻 Why Quantum-Resistant? Traditional encryption methods won't stand a chance against quantum computers. We need cryptographic algorithms and physical security measures that can! 🔑 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD): Think of it as the superhero of data transport. QKD uses quantum mechanics to secure data in transit, making it virtually unbreakable. This technology is incorporated into the PRISM project. 🔐 Act Now: Whether you're a business or an individual, the time to upgrade your cybersecurity strategies is now. Don't wait until quantum computers become mainstream; start protecting your data with quantum-resistant technologies today! 📢 Spread the Word: Share this post and help raise awareness about the quantum shift in cybersecurity. Let's move towards a safer digital future together! RSM MT | Merqury Cybersecurity | Melita Ltd. | UMNAI | University of Malta | MITA (Malta Information Technology Agency) | Critical Infrastructure Protection Directorate PRISM is a project co-funded by the European Union. #PRISM #Quantum #QuantumCommunication #QuantumInnovation #QuantumComputing #EuroQCI #EuropeanQuantumCommunication #CyberSecurity #CyberDefense #InformationSecurity #Malta\n\nRegarding cybersecurity’s next-gen landscape, may I welcome your team to the Cybersecurity Revolution: Embracing Deterministic Chaos! 🔐 >>>> Hey everyone, Exciting news! We're launching a groundbreaking Cybersecurity group that will reshape digital protection. Join us and contribute to this fantastic community! Traditional cybersecurity relies on mathematical periodicity vulnerabilities. But quantum computing and AI demand a new paradigm. Quantum computers threaten encryption methods, while AI faces adversarial attacks. To counter these threats, we must embrace deterministic chaos. Chaos systems exhibit unpredictable behavior, even with deterministic rules. This randomness can bolster our defenses against quantum computing and AI vulnerabilities. Deterministic chaos offers multiple benefits. It introduces unpredictability, hindering quantum computing and AI attacks. It also enables resilient security through self-learning systems that adapt to new threats. In our Cybersecurity group, we explore the potential of deterministic chaos. We invite experts, researchers, and enthusiasts to join us. Let's collaborate, share knowledge, and push the boundaries of cybersecurity. Join us. Let's revolutionize cybersecurity together!

The document is an uncomfortable read for security professionals, but brings important questions to the foreground. The quantum threat has been likened to the nuclear arms race and climate change — in that they are all existential threats that promise to irrevocably change the international and geopolitical landscape. But unlike the nuclear arms race, it is not just a race to build capability. With quantum computing it is also a race to protect the world from their impact. Quantum computers will be cryptographically superior to classical computers and contemporary encryption. These machines will soon crack the encryption algorithms we use today to protect everything from national critical infrastructure to online banking. ‘Q-Day’ is forecast to happen within years, not decades. But the threat is already very real. Today, information is at risk from Harvest Now, Decrypt Later attacks. Once a computer is functional, it will be able to access this stolen data. We know that information has already been collected en masse for this purpose. As such, the quantum threat exists today, even before the advent of a mature quantum computer. Complete article:\n\nThe Danger of Quantum Computing to Cyber Security “But within the U.S. cybersecurity community, the threat is seen as real and urgent. China, Russia and the United States are all racing to develop the technology before their geopolitical rivals do, though it is difficult to know who is ahead because some of the gains are shrouded in secrecy. On the American side, the possibility that an adversary could win that race has set in motion a yearslong effort to develop a new generation of encryption systems, ones that even a powerful quantum computer would be unable to break. The effort, which began in 2016, will culminate early next year when the National Institute of Standards and Technology is expected to finalize its guidance for migrating to the new systems. Ahead of that migration, President Biden late last year signed into law the Quantum Computing Cybersecurity Preparedness Act, which directed agencies to begin checking their systems for encryption that will need to be replaced. But even given this new urgency, the migration to stronger encryption will most likely take a decade or more — a pace that, some experts fear, may not be fast enough to avert catastrophe.”#QuantumComputing#CyberSecurity"
