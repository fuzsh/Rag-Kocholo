        "text": "By Richard Brogle and Jakob Lindenmeyer\n\nIn 1992 you received an Honarary Doctorate from ETH Zurich. What do the folks back home in the US know about our university?\n\nWhitfield Diffie: Okay, ETH is perhaps not as well known in the States as the elite universities in Paris, Oxford or Cambridge. But ETH is one of the better known European universities. In the States, ETH is mostly known in connection with Albert Einstein.\n\nYou work at Sun Microsystems. What are you working on at the moment?\n\nDiffie: When I started to work at Sun in 1991 as a \"distinguished engineer\" I was asked to work on any issue that I considered to be important. For me that was the issue of security, together with its political implications. Today, as Chief Security Officer, I co-ordinate all relevant security technical processes, from their development to their production.\n\nA propos security: Would you use cryptographic software to which you could not access the source code?\n\nI try not to. In business one is often subjected to inherent necessities. Encryption programmes are, however, very small and the most important are accessible in the source text. If it is important to your security that the programme code be concealed, then you are vulnerable at this point. Don't rely on secrets that you can't readily change.\n\nAre there such things as absolutely secure encoding systems?\n\nWith a few exceptions, we don't know. But in the meantime we do have systems that we can trust, like the Rijndael algrorithm developed in Belgium, which was adopted as an AES (advanced encryption standard). I believe there are systems that can't be broken into. But there is still a way to go until we reach the mathematical certainly that we would like to have.\n\nCan cryptography be used to hide who is communicating with whom?\n\nWhen two parties exchange information, every router in between knows where the packet is headed. In order to deceive the router one would have to send out an awful lot of trash [thinks about it and smiles]. Perhaps the deluge of spam mail is simply a gigantic Trojan horse. I don't knowâ€¦ we should look into it. Perhaps it's even a conspiracy.\n\nFor the past ten years you have been fighting against export barriers on encryption software. Why did the US government suddenly lift these barriers in 2000? Was it because of your intervention?\n\nMy arguments were certainly an important input. But the main reason for the lifting was the pressure the US-industry brought to bear on the government. Europe felt that it was being spied on by the USA, especially after the interception programme \"Echelon\" became public knowledge. Following this Europe loosened the restrictions for software export in the field of security. The IT industry in the US also wanted its share of the global market and lobbied the government to get rid of the long-overdue export restrictions.\n\nWhat were your feelings when you heard that the British secret service had possibly discovered public-key cryptography before your own discovery?\n\nWhen I heard that the British secret service had purportedly discovered something in this area ahead of me, I went to England to talk to the people involved. I spoke at length with James Ellies, the Brit whose work was closest to my own. I came to the conclusion that, although they understood the technology, there was no reason to believe that they realised its importance.\n\nWhy not?\n\nThe US secret service NSA (National Security Agency) and the other secret services were used to dealing with certain problems and they viewed these new possibilities as just a mathematical curiosity. The possibilities that public-key cryptography opened up did not begin to interest the secret services until it was published in freely available literature.\n\nDid no-one try to stop you publishing your discovery?\n\nIndeed, I had heated discussions with secret service officers but I was never threatened. Some of them might not have liked me but I have good relations with most of them nowadays. In the early days the secret services tried to gain control over the publication of anything to do with cryptography. But experience with similar censorship measures in the area of nuclear technology shows that the more something is censored, the more interesting it becomes.\n\nIs it possible that secret service agencies, like the NSA still have a big enough lead that they are able to decode transactions generally believed to be safe?\n\nI would say it's certain that the NSA has knowledge that it doesn't share with the public. But only a minor amount of NSA's work is devoted to crypto-analytical endeavours and in the past 25 years public knowledge in this field has increased enormously and begotten fundamental insights. The analytical technologies that we possess today lead us to believe in the security of our solutions."
