The Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange system is used in protocols including the Secure Sockets Layer and Secure Shell, which allow secure processing of transactions on theinternet. PKC uses a \"public key\" and a \"private key\", allowing implementation of digital signatures and an encryption algorithm without requiring that sender and receiver first exchange a secret key.\n\nFather: Robert Hellman physicist, b. circa 1909, d. 2007)\n\nMother: Adelaide Leifer Hellman (d. 1984)\n\nBrother: Howard\n\nBrother: Stephen\n\nWife: Dorothie\n\nHigh School: Bronx High School of Science, Bronx, NY (1962)\n\nUniversity: BS Electrical Engineering, New York University (1966)\n\nUniversity: MS Electrical Engineering, Stanford University (1967)\n\nUniversity: PhD Electrical Engineering, Stanford University (1969)\n\nTeacher: Ass't Prof of Electrical Engineering, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1969-71)\n\nTeacher: Ass't Prof of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University (1971-75)\n\nTeacher: Assoc Prof of Electrical Engineering, Stanford University (1975-79)\n\nProfessor: Electrical Engineering, Stanford University (1979-96)\n\nHellman Associates Founder & President (1983-88)\n\nBinary Corporation Vice President (1975-76)\n\nIBM Watson Research Center (1968-69)\n\nPayPal Advisor\n\nVeriSign Scientific Advisory Board (2008-)\n\nTRW Summer Intern, 1967\n\nEFF Pioneer Award 1994\n\nNational Computer Systems Security Award 1996\n\nACM Kanellakis Award 1997\n\nFranklin Institute's Louis Edward Levy Medal 1997\n\nIEEE Koji Kobayashi Computers and Communications Award 1999\n\nMarconi International Fellow Award 2000\n\nJournal of Cryptology Editorial Board (1992-95)\n\nIEEE Fellow, 1980\n\nInternational Association for Cryptologic Research 1996\n\nNational Academy of Engineering 2002\n\nNational Research Council National Cryptographic Policy Committee (1994-96)\n\nEta Kappa Nu Honor Society\n\nSigma Xi Scientific Research Society\n\nTau Beta Pi Engineering Honor Society\n\nDaisy Alliance Board of Directors\n\nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee\n\nFoundation for Global Community\n\nGore 2000\n\nObama for America\n\nJewish Ancestry\n\nOfficial Website:\n\nhttp://nuclearrisk.wordpress.com/\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nBreakthrough: Emerging New Thinking (1987, non-fiction, with Anatoly Gromyko)\n\nNew!\n\nNNDB MAPPER Create a map starting with Martin Hellman\n\nRequires Flash 7+ and Javascript.\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
