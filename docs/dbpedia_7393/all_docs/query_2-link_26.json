        "text": "With a deep interest in the ethics of technology, Dr. Hellman has been applying risk analysis to a potential failure of nuclear deterrence. In this upcoming lecture, he will be arguing that national security is separable from global security in this era of nuclear weapons, cyberattacks, terrorisms, and environmental crises. He will be calling on U.S. citizens and policymakers to take a wider view of global issues. Dr. Hellman received his B.E. from New York University in 1966, and M.S. and Ph.D. from Stanford University in 1967 and 1969, respectively. He is best known for his invention, with Whitfield Diffie and Ralph Merkle, of public key cryptography which, among other applications, enables secure Internet transactions and is used to transfer literally trillions of dollars every day. Robert Stewart Distinguished Lecture"
