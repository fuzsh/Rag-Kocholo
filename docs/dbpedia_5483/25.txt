It’s safe to apply KatSupreme’s Cat Scratch Deterrent Tape to most surfaces, but we recommend avoiding leather and faux leather surfaces. The tape is residue-free and safe to apply on fabric upholstery, curved surfaces, couch corners, wooden furniture, and more.

If you’re worried that it may not work on your furniture, cut a small piece and test it on an inconspicuous area.

To attach the bowl to the base in a flat position, set down the base with the logo facing towards you. Insert the bottom of the bowl into the closest indentation on the base and gently rotate clockwise. The bumps around the bowl base insert into the notches in the base and secure the bowl in place. Once the bowl no longer rotates clockwise, you’re ready to go! Simply rotate counterclockwise to remove the bowl.

To insert at an angle, follow the same process, this time lining up the bowl with the notches near to the rear of the base.
