        "text": "If you do not have a library or wish to add tapes, which are currently not loaded in a library, you will need to manually add them to the scratch pool.\n\nIn the Director Media tab, Tape Regen window, click the Scratch radio button, select the scratch pool to add to and click Add Tapes to Scratch Pool.\n\nIf you wish to add one tape to a pool, enter the six-character VolSer to the VolSer edit field in the Add Single VolSer to List frame, click Add>> add it the Add List.\n\nIf you wish to add a range of tapes to the pool, use the Add Range of VolSers to List frame. For example, if you have a range of VolSers, like 00001 to 00020, you would enter:\n\nPrefix: Any leading characters. In this example, there are not any, so leave it blank.\n\nFrom: The starting point of the range. In this example, enter 1.\n\nTo: The ending point of the range. In this example, enter 20.\n\nPostfix: Any trailing characters. In this example, there are not any, so leave it blank.\n\nZero Pad Numeric Portion Size: Most bar codes are full six-character fields, so for this example, enter 6.\n\nClick Add Range>> to generate the list of tape, i.e., VolSers and add it to the Add List.\n\nOnce VolSers are in the Add List, you can highlight a single VolSer and remove it by clicking Remove, or remove all of the tapes in the list by clicking Remove All."
