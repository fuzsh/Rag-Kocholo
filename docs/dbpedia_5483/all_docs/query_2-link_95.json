Watch the video to see how it’s done and follow along with the detailed instructions below.\n\nStep 1\n\nAssemble your materials\n\nStep 2\n\nGet your image ready and print it\n\nStep 3\n\nApply packing tape over your image\n\nStep 4\n\nSoak your image in warm water\n\nStep 5\n\nRub off the wet paper\n\nStep 6\n\nLet your sticker dry then apply it!\n\nStep 1\n\nAssemble your materials\n\nYou will need the following materials for this project:\n\nYour photo, image, design or text\n\nPacking tape (heavy duty is best)\n\nPaintShop Pro or another photo editing program\n\nScissors or exacto knife if you want to trim your photo\n\nA cloth, a spoon or something to burnish the image\n\nBowl of warm water\n\nStep 2\n\nGet your image ready and print it\n\nMeasure the width of the packing tape\n\nResize or crop your photo so it will fit on the packing tape\n\nYou can also enhance your image with a variety of effects (check out our video tutorials below to see how to convert to your image to black and white, or use a script to add a cool effect)\n\nIf you want to use an image that is larger than the packing tape, you can print it on multiple stickers but you will need to be very precise when lining them up on your object\n\nPrint your image on a laser printer (this process works better with laser printed or photocopied images, than with ink jet printed images)\n\nStep 3\n\nApply the packing tape over your image and trim\n\nCarefully apply the packing tape over your image, making sure there are no bubbles or wrinkles\n\nYou can tape your paper to your table or workspace, to keep it in place while you are applying the packing tape\n\nOnce the packing tape is smoothly in place, rub it firmly with a cloth or spoon or other burnishing tool – the more pressure you apply, the better the final result will be\n\nTrim off any excess paper and tape around your image\n\nStep 4\n\nSoak your image in water\n\nImmerse your taped image in warm water for at least 5 minutes\n\nThe longer you let the image soak, the easier it will be to remove the paper\n\nStep 5\n\nRub off the wet paper\n\nStart rubbing the paper off the back of the image\n\nIf some of the paper remains, put the taped image back in the water to soak some more\n\nContinue alternately soaking and rubbing off the paper until all the paper is gone\n\nStep 6\n\nLet your image transfer dry then apply it\n\nLay your image, sticky side up, on a flat surface and let it dry completely\n\nOnce the sticker has dried, you will find that the stickiness has returned\n\nNow you just have to stick it on whatever object you are decorating, making sure to smooth it out nicely\n\nIf you have made a bunch of stickers and aren’t going to use them all right away, you can put them on a sheet of wax paper to use another time\n\nHow to edit photos and images\n\nBefore you go to transfer your photo or image onto the packing tape, make sure it is looking it’s best! These tutorials will show you how to crop your photo to the correct size, how to work with text, and how to add some effects.\n\nHow to add text to your photos\n\nThis project works not only with photos, but also with any artwork image or text.
