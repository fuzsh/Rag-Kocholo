Cats scratch to communicate, claim possessions, and stretch and condition their claws, says Dr. Andrea Sanchez, a veterinarian at Banfield Pet Hospital.\n\nTo select the best products to protect furniture from cat scratching, we spoke to veterinarians and cat behaviorists and tested 17 products to deter destructive scratching. Our top pick is the Sofa Scratcher Squared, a durable sisal-covered post that fits neatly around the corners of sofas and chairs. We love its simple, clean design and neutral color options.\n\nKeep in mind that there are a variety of reasons a cat might be attracted to scratching your sofa. Some cats don't have alternative scratching posts or pads or don't have them in the right locations. Others enjoy the furniture's height or the feeling of scratching a couch or carpet. Whatever the reason, you can stop your cat from scratching furniture by offering them more attractive options.\n\nRead more about how Insider Reviews tests and evaluates pet products.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur top picks for products to keep cats from scratching furniture\n\nBest overall: Sofa Scratcher Squared - See at Chewy\n\nPart furniture guard, part scratching post, the Sofa Scratcher does double duty to protect furniture from destruction.\n\nBest furniture guard: Clawguard Furniture Shields - See at Chewy\n\nClawguard Furniture Shields are an easy-to-install, semi-permanent fix to protect furniture and carpet from a cat's claws.\n\nBest scratch tape: Sticky Paws on a Roll Furniture Strips - See at Chewy\n\nSticky Paws On a Roll temporarily deters a cat from destruction by making furniture scratching too sticky to be enjoyable.\n\nBest nail caps: Soft Claws Cat Nail Caps - See at Chewy\n\nSoft Claws Cat Nail Caps allow your cat to scratch and use their paws naturally without causing damage to your furniture.\n\nBest scratching post: On2Pets Skyline Sisal Cat Scratching Post - See at Chewy\n\nThe On2Pets Skyline Sisal Cat Scratching Post has three poles and a wide, turf-covered base for happy vertical and horizontal scratching.\n\nBest floor scratcher: Our Pets Double-Wide Cat Scratcher - See at Chewy\n\nThe Our Pets Double-Wide Cat Scratcher satisfies even timid cats with its simple design.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest overall: Sofa Scratcher Squared\n\nPros: Combination scratcher/furniture guard; fits snugly against a couch, chair corner, or furniture leg; held in place by weight of furniture instead of tape or pins; made of toxin-free sisal; available in five colors\n\nCons: More expensive than furniture guards and most scratching posts, light assembly required\n\nThe genius of the Sofa Scratcher Squared and its half-moon-shaped cousin, the Sofa Scratcher, is that its sisal-covered edges fit snugly against a couch or chair. This provides a cat with an appropriate place to scratch right at the center of the room where felines prefer to mark their territory, says Christine Calder, a board-certified veterinary behaviorist at Calder Veterinary Behavior Services. The Sofa Scratcher lines up flush against furniture, and its wood core prevents your cat from sinking their claws into the upholstery.\n\nMy furniture-scratching cat seemed to enjoy flexing his claws on the Sofa Scratcher Squared as much as he enjoyed using them on my couch. He tore at the sisal guard every time he jumped onto the furniture for a nap. After nearly six months of use, it still looks brand new.\n\nUnlike shields and tape, both Sofa Scratcher models have a rectangular polycarbonate base that slips under the leg of a couch or chair, using the furniture's weight to keep it in place. Felt backing on the scratcher prevents pilling on your upholstery. The 24-inch-tall square scratcher and its two 5.5-inch-wide panels perfectly covered the chair and couch I tested it on.\n\nIf you have taller furniture, you may need scratch tape or a furniture guard to protect the remaining inches of exposed furniture. Because the half-moon scratcher didn't match the shape of my furniture, it left gaps large enough for a determined cat to reach the upholstery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest furniture guard: Clawguard Furniture Shields\n\nPros: Transparent, flexible, made from durable marine-grade vinyl, withstands sharp claws, easy to install with upholstery twist pins, waterproof, comes in four sizes, can be cut down to smaller sizes, long-lasting\n\nCons: Visible on furniture and carpeting, upholstery pins may leave marks on delicate materials\n\nSanchez says that one way to stop a cat from scratching furniture is to make their favorite scratching spots less desirable. Covering an area with slick vinyl can discourage destructive tendencies.\n\nOf the two vinyl guards we tested, the Clawguard Furniture Shield offered the most protection and took less than five minutes to install. The transparent, flexible material attaches to upholstery or carpeting with twist pins inserted through holes that run the length of the shield's edges. When the shield is secured tight, the clear plastic caps on the pins look like small buttons.\n\nAfter figuring out the vinyl was unpleasant to scratch on his first attempt, my furniture-scratching cat did not touch it again, preferring to use the nearby posts and pads instead. Not even a utility knife left marks on the guard, and a pushpin could only fully penetrate it with heavy pressure.\n\nYou can choose from four sizes, which come in packs of two. You can also cut them down in size with scissors. Aside from how well they protect furniture, the best thing about the shields is that they will last for months, if not years.\n\nDespite being made of clear vinyl, Clawguard Furniture Shields are easily visible. And while my upholstery did not show signs of being embedded with pins when I removed the guard after testing, more delicate materials may.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest scratch tape: Sticky Paws on a Roll Furniture Strips\n\nPros: Adheres to a variety of surfaces, transparent, comes in multiple sizes including a tape roll, easy to remove, doesn't leave residue, not too aversive for cats\n\nCons: Debris clings to tape's sticky exterior, visible on furniture\n\nLike furniture guards, scratch tape takes the fun out of scratching a couch leg or the edge of a carpet. Of the two versions we tested, we found Sticky Paws was best at deterring scratching without causing unnecessary fear, pain, or discomfort. This tape is also recommended by Daniel \"DQ\" Quagliozzi, a cat behavior consultant and owner of Go Cat Go!\n\nSticky Paws is a transparent, double-sided tape. One side adheres to upholstery, carpeting, and other household materials, while the other sticky side faces outward. When cats scratch, the tape briefly grips their nails and paws, preventing them from digging in. \"Sticky tape is not too aversive for cats,\" says Calder. It may be unpleasant to scratch, but doing so doesn't cause discomfort or fear.\n\nSticky Paws comes in different shapes and sizes, but our favorite was Sticky Paws On a Roll, which works like a packaging tape dispenser so you can easily cut the tape to size. Like the furniture guards, after my cat got his paws on the tape just once, he chose not to focus any more energy on it, turning instead to nearby posts and pads.\n\nThe biggest problem with using Sticky Paws is the reason it works in the first place: Stuff sticks to it. Dust and hair collect on the adhesive outer layer, although I was surprised that after three weeks on my furniture, it had collected less debris than expected. While the interior of the tape adhered well, it's more temporary than a furniture guard, was more easily penetrated in our testing, and requires frequent replacement. The tape didn't leave any residue, but it's not the most aesthetically pleasing option.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest nail caps: Soft Claws Cat Nail Caps\n\nPros: Flexible vinyl, fits medium-sized claws well, variety of colors, last four to six weeks, comes with 40 caps plus nontoxic adhesive and six applicators, affordable, doesn't interfere with natural scratching and claw extension\n\nCons: May be difficult to get on, may fall off before four to six weeks are up, many cats will not tolerate them\n\nNail caps prevent your cat's claws from scratching your furniture. Calder likes Soft Claws, and out of the two nail cap brands we considered, we found the medium-sized Soft Claws nail caps to be better sized for a 9- to 13-pound cat's claws.\n\nSoft Claws are made of durable, flexible vinyl that slips over the nail. The cat claw covers don't interfere with a feline's ability to extend or retract their claws and come in a variety of colors. Super strong, nontoxic adhesive keeps each cap secure for four to six weeks. Each package comes with 40 nail caps, two bottles of adhesive, and six applicators.\n\nAccording to Calder and Sanchez, nail caps can be a good solution for preventing damage without removing a cat's ability to practice the innate behavior of scratching. While it's important to teach a cat to focus their scratching on posts and pads, in the short term, \"these nail caps may be just the relief your furniture needs,\" says Sanchez.\n\nThe biggest drawback of nail caps is that many cats, including mine, will not tolerate them. Even those whose cats are okay with their claws being handled may find getting them on and situated correctly challenging. It's also not uncommon for caps to fall off before their four- to six-week lifespan is up.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest scratching post: On2Pets Skyline Sisal Cat Scratching Post\n\nPros: Three scratching posts of different heights, sisal-covered posts, broad base covered in scratchable artificial turf, holds up to 32 pounds\n\nCons: Requires light assembly\n\nWhen figuring out how to stop your cat from scratching furniture, the goal is not to punish them for their behavior but to redirect it. Every cat has their personal scratching preference. Suppose your cat is scratching vertically on your furniture. In that case, they will likely prefer a vertical scratcher, says Quagliozzi. If they scratch carpets or rugs, a horizontal scratch pad is more likely to satisfy their desire. Some, like my cat Osito, enjoy both. Whatever they like, Calder says it's important to have multiple scratchers.\n\nThe Skyline Sisal Cat Scratching Post was the clear favorite of the seven vertical scratchers we tested. Both of my cats returned to the scratcher multiple times a day during the first month of testing. Six months later, one still scratches there daily.\n\nResembling a city skyline, this scratcher has three sisal-covered vertical posts at heights of 30.5 inches, 22 inches, and 16.5 inches arranged together at the center of a broad rectangular base. The base is covered in scratchable artificial turf. After six months, the scratcher's sisal is a little shaggy but still looks nice overall.\n\nThe sturdy scratcher can withstand up to 32 pounds of cat. It requires some light assembly and falls in the middle of the pack in terms of price. Considering how frequently my cats use it, it's well worth the cost.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest floor scratcher: Our Pets Double-Wide Cat Scratcher\n\nPros: Simple design, affordable, made from recycled materials, recyclable\n\nCons: Slides around on smooth floors\n\nSome cats like to scratch vertically, others horizontally, and some a little of both. If you've found destruction on rugs, carpets, and couch cushions, your cat falls into one of the latter two categories, and providing them with a properly placed floor scratcher may solve your problem.\n\nWe tested four floor scratchers and found the simple design of the Our Pets Double-Wide Cat Scratcher was the most universally attractive to our feline testers. This affordable scratcher made from recycled corrugated cardboard is 18 inches long and 10 inches wide and sits inside a cardboard frame. It also comes with a small bag of catnip to help entice cats.\n\nThe durable interior pad of the scratcher is reversible, so even if your cat claws through the top layer, you can turn it over. How long that will take is specific to individual cats, but ours still looks almost new after nearly two months of use by my two cats. When it's completely worn out, the pad and frame can be recycled.\n\nThe scratcher slides around a bit on a smooth floor when a cat really gets clawing, but ours has never flipped over or shot across the room. Despite the sliding, this is hands down my timid cat's favorite scratcher. She uses it multiple times daily and snoozes or watches squirrels outside the window while on the pad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow we tested products to keep cats from scratching furniture\n\nAll of the products were provided as editorial review samples by their manufacturers, except the nail caps, Max and Marlow Tall Scratch Post, and Furniture Defender Cat Scratching Guard, which Insider Reviews purchased.\n\nTo objectively compare the products in each category of this guide, I devised the following tests:\n\nScratch test: To determine how the furniture guards and scratch tape would hold up over time, I scratched them with three different tools: a fork, a push pin, and an X-acto knife. Each tool was dragged across the same section of the product 50 consecutive times, and I noted if any penetrated the material and how long it took to do so.\n\nPenetration test: I used the same three tools in the penetration test. I conducted three trials with each tool as I attempted to make a hole through the material. First, I applied light pressure, then medium pressure, and finally, my full strength.\n\nNail caps test: Because neither of my cats volunteered to try out the nail caps, I tested their longevity by sticking two caps from each brand onto the tines of a plastic fork. Each week over five weeks, I scraped the fork on a scratcher 100 times and looked for any shifting or loosening of the caps.\n\nLongevity test: Our best overall product and top scratching post have remained in use since testing for the first version of this guide began in October 2020. I assessed each to identify any aesthetic or functional deterioration in their material over time.\n\nCat attract test: I doused each floor scratcher and scratching post with catnip and introduced them to my cats. I placed each in the locations they prefer to scratch and rotated them weekly, noting which scratchers they avoided, which they used occasionally, and which they returned to again and again.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow to stop your cat from scratching furniture FAQs\n\nWhy do cats scratch furniture?\n\nScratching is a natural behavior for cats. \"Scratching serves many functions for a cat, including a communication tool that leaves both scent and visual marks at a site, a way to clean and condition the claw beds, and a great way to stretch the muscles of the legs and toes,\" says Sanchez. Cats who don't have easy access to scratching posts or horizontal scratch pads may turn their claws toward furniture and carpeting.\n\nHow can I stop my cat from scratching my sofa?\n\nOwning a scratching post or pad isn't helpful if it's not where your cat likes to scratch. Cats need a variety of choices in various locations to be fully satisfied. Sanchez recommends placing them in high-traffic areas and near your cat's favorite resting spots. The material a scratching post or pad is made from may also determine whether your cat prefers your furniture to a scratching post or pad. \"Some cats will strictly scratch on softer materials such as cardboard boxes or scratch pads, while other cats will only use carpeted or tall, sturdy posts,\" says Sanchez. Many cats enjoy scratching a sisal rope or cloth, but some may find other materials more attractive. If your cat is attracted to carpet, Quagliozzi recommends framing a piece of carpet for them to use.\n\nDoes cat scratching deterrent spray work?\n\nOur experts say that cat scratching deterrent sprays do not help redirect furniture scratching. \"They don't really work, and they're an aversive,\" says Calder. An aversive is any tool or technique that uses discomfort, pain, fear, or intimidation to force an animal to change their behavior. Deterrent sprays are aversive because they irritate a cat's acute senses of smell and taste, making them sneeze and cough. Using scratch tape or furniture guards combined with training is a more effective long-term strategy for changing a cat's behavior. \"Our goal is not to scare the cat; it's more about finding out why the behavior is occurring in the first place,\" says Calder.\n\nShould cats be declawed?\n\nTo prevent a cat from scratching, some veterinarians offer declawing, a surgical procedure that removes a cat's claws. Although declawing techniques have become less painful with laser technology, it's a surgery that still carries potential complications.\n\nSome countries and US cities have banned the practice. The American Veterinary Medical Association also discourages the practice and instead recommends providing scratching surfaces like the ones featured in this guide, frequent nail trims, and positive reinforcement training. Complications of this procedure can include infection, tissue necrosis, and back pain, according to the Humane Society of the United States.\n\nIn addition, removing a cat's claws prevents them from practicing innate behaviors such as scratching and climbing. Veterinarians do not know how or if, declawing impacts a cat's quality of life and psychological well-being.\n\nA cat typically heals from laser declawing in around three weeks, and pain can be managed with medications such as fentanyl patches. However, Bob Murtaugh, a veterinarian and chief professional relations officer at Thrive Pet Healthcare, does not believe the procedure is necessary unless there is a valid medical reason.\n\n\"I think the best thing is to just provide them with some scratching opportunities and to train them,\" says Murtaugh. \"Part of having a cat recognizing the fact that they might take it out on a sofa every once in a while.\"\n\nIn addition to providing a cat with acceptable scratching alternatives, such as scratching posts and scratch pads, covering a cat's claws with nail caps is a more humane option than removing them altogether. Some veterinarians will even put them on for you, says Murtaugh.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat else we tested\n\nAll of the products we tested for this guide to protect furniture from cat scratching are high-quality enough to get the job done. Here are the ones that didn't quite make the cut but may work for your needs.\n\nScratching Posts\n\nPetfusion Ultimate Cat Window Scratching Post: I liked the design of this scratching post, which has a perch at the top that suctions to a window for stability. My cats, however, did not feel the same. They used neither the sisal scratcher nor the perch.\n\nSmartcat Ultimate Scratching Post: The Smartcat Ultimate is tall enough to accommodate a full body stretch and has a sturdy wooden base. However, my cats showed no interest in using either this scratcher or the similarly shaped Frisco Sisal Scratching Post, which seems to be due to its imposing column shape.\n\nFrisco 33.5-inch Sisal Scratching Post: This scratching post is similar to the Smartcat Ultimate, but with a faux-fur-covered base and top, it's less aesthetically pleasing. Like the SmartCat Ultimate Post, my cats did not use the Frisco scratcher, likely because of its imposing column shape.\n\nFurniture Guards\n\nFurniture Defender Cat Scratching Guard: Like Clawguard's Furniture Shields, these furniture guards are clear and flexible but with slightly thinner vinyl that may be easier to penetrate than the marine-grade vinyl used in the Clawguard Furniture Shields. The Furniture Defender comes in five sizes and carries a 100% money-back lifetime guarantee.\n\nScratch Tape\n\nClawguard Protection Tape: Although this tape is high quality and looks nicer on furniture than Sticky Paws, it does not have a sticky exterior. As a result, Clawguard Protection Tape functions more like a temporary furniture shield with an adhesive backing for twice the price of Sticky Paws On a Roll.\n\nScratch Pads\n\nKong Naturals Cat Scratcher: Of the floor scratchers we tested, Kong's incline version was the second simplest design. While my brave cat liked this ramped scratcher, my timid one was unimpressed.\n\nK&H Ramp and Track Scratcher: One of my cats enjoyed both clawing this expensive inclined scratcher and playing with the ping pong balls embedded in its base. He unfortunately lost interest in it within a month, even when I sprinkled it with catnip and moved it to different locations in the home.\n\nBergan Star Chaser Turbo Scratcher: Both of my cats enjoyed the light-up ball that rolls around the track that encircles this scratch pad. I even chose it as one of our favorites in our guide to interactive cat toys. But while both liked the ball, only one of my cats was interested in using the scratch pad at the Star Chaser's center.\n\nNail Caps\n\nPurrdy Paws: These nail caps were similar in quality to Soft Claws and they stayed firmly glued to our scratcher fork throughout five weeks of testing. They are about 50% longer than Soft Claws, which some cats may find awkward.\n\nShoshi Parks\n\nContributor\n\nShoshi Parks is a contributor for Insider Reviews, where she tests and writes about products for dogs and cats.
