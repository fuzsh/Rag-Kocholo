It‚Äôs super, super easy, and chances are you have all the things that you need, laying around your house already.\n\nFor the scratch-offs you‚Äôll need:\n\nDish soap\n\nAcrylic paint\n\nPaintbrush (I like to use the foam brushes for this project, as you don‚Äôt get streaks)\n\nContact paper, or Scotch tape\n\nStart by mixing your soap and paint together. You want equal parts, and if it seems it‚Äôs thick, add some more dish soap. If it‚Äôs too thick, it‚Äôs sometimes harder to scratch off.\n\nI wanted to make my scratch-off section in the shape of a heart, so I took my contact paper, traced a heart on the back, and cut it out. You could also do this with Scotch tape, but it would probably be easier to just have a basic shape, such as a square or rectangle.\n\nNext, to make it easier, I traced around the heart (with a pencil, so you can erase it afterwards) where I wanted it placed on the paper. Then I wrote what I wanted under the scratch-off, and erased the pencil mark.\n\nPaint your contact paper with the soap/paint mixture. I stick a little double sided tape under the contact paper so it doesn‚Äôt move around while painting it, and put it on a paper plate for easy clean up. I painted 2 thin coats. On a lot of the tutorials I‚Äôve seen for these, the paint is always really streaky‚Ä¶.I feel like it looks sloppy, but then again, I‚Äôm a perfectionist! I found that using a foam brush makes it come out streak-free.\n\nAfter both coats have dried, I peeled my heart off, and placed it over the words I wrote, pressing down (not rubbing!) to make sure it‚Äôs stuck on the paper.\n\n**Have a project you made using one of my tutorials? Show it off! I, along with all my followers, would love to see it! üôÇ I‚Äôve started a new page on my blog called ‚ÄúYour Pictures!‚Äù, located right next to the ‚ÄúAbout This Blog!‚Äù link at the top of my blog. Check it out for more information, and to see other fan pics!**\n\nUntil tomorrow!!"
