        "text": "I use Symantec Backup Exec 2012 myself and I have my backups setup like this and it works well for us.\n\nMy backups are ran daily when business is conducted on Monday thru Friday Nights as well as Saturday Night which is appended to my Friday Night Tape.\n\nMy Setup:\n\nI use a 10 tape rotation in 2 sets of 5\n\nAllowing one complete weeks set to be stored offsite, with the nightly tape taken offsite the next day as well.\n\nFull sets are brought back Monday Mornings.\n\nTapes Labeled:\n\nSet A Monday thru Set A Friday\n\nSet B Monday thru Set B Friday\n\nTwo Backup Jobs where created one scheduled for Weekdays as Full Backups, one for Saturday Full Backups.\n\nThere are 3 servers involved all with the appropriate agents needed to conduct good backups (IE SQL Agent, etc) they all backup to one LTO5 Tape unit which is attached to the master BE2012 Server - all 3 servers have the same type of jobs created, but each start at a different time Weekdays Server 1 at 7pm, Server 2 at 930pm, Server 3 at 1130pm. Saturdays 1PM, 330PM, 530PM\n\nWeekday Job and Saturday Job - Storage set to “Any tape cartridge storage”, “Keep data for 2 Days”\n\nSetting tapes for a 2 Day retention will Mark the tapes as Appendable 2 days after the last time it was modified.\n\nWhich works something like this for me for Friday and Saturday (where I have no operator to change the tape) Friday backups start at 7:00PM the Last Job Runs at 11:30PM Tape is last Modified sometime on Saturday 12:30AM. Tape is Appendable until Monday 12:30AM - Thus when Saturday Afternoon jobs kick in, the tape is accessible.\n\nPrior to Starting Backups one Weekdays at 6PM an Inventory Job is ran on the tape that was inserted for the nightly backup this way the system see that the tape is in an over-writable status as it has been well over 2 days since the tape was last seen. No need to schedule an Inventory Job on Saturday as the tape will still be in the tape unit.\n\nDuring the Weekday Monday thru Friday there is an Eject Job which runs at 6:00AM which has the tape ejected and ready for replacement by the operator that morning for the nightly runs.\n\nThis has worked for me very well - no need to scratch tapes - and I keep a good amount of backups stored offsite.\n\nCheers\n\nEdit: As an Added benefit doing it this way - 1 Tape isn’t being hammered constantly as it takes a full 2 weeks for the tape to be reinserted into the tape unit.\n\nWhat is the difference between infinite allow append and 2 days append period.\n\nIn our scenario, we backup 5 servers for daily jobs and size of total backup is around 1.3 TB. The backup tape can store upto 2.8 TB. So, If Tape A completes the job in first week and stores 1.3TB. The tape can run on second week without issues. but the third, when the tape gets full, its not overwriting and perform backups. Then it prompts to insert an overwritable table to complete the job.\n\nOur job timings :\n\nserver 1 - 19.30pm\n\nServer2 - 20:00pm\n\nServer3 - 23:50pm\n\nServer4 - 00:50am\n\nServer5 - 6:00am\n\nIs the tape not overwriting because of protection period. The job completes upto 3 servers succesfully and when it starts server 4 completes half of it and stucks at 3:00 AM. If I check the tape size in the morning, it says media full(not appendable). At the moment, we set protection period to 10 days and append period to Infinite - Allow append.\n\nCan you please help me with this scenario.\n\nThanks\n\nFirst lets go over Protection Period and Append Period so you have a better understanding of it. Much easier if you just watch this YouTube Video as it will do a better job of explaining it instead of me typing it all out.\n\nWhat you need to understand is What the Protection Period does to the tape, how it works and how it’s calculated from the tapes “Last Modified” time.\n\nProtection Period Protects the tape from being Overwritten for some set length of time, once that length of time expires the tape will become over-writable if it’s used again.\n\nAppend Period allows the tape to be append to for a length of time, once that length of time is reached the tape can no longer be appended to and it now needs to wait until it’s protection period expires before it can be used again and overwritten.\n\nProtection Period Calculation - It’s not 10 days of protection from the start of your job, it’s 10 days of protection from the LAST modified time of the tape, So if you keep appending to the tape then that time frame keeps extending out 10 days past the LAST modified time of the tape.\n\nBUT… At one point, somewhere in time, you need to tell the backup system that the data on the tape is no longer protected and in so doing the tape becomes over-writeable.\n\nBasically it’s run backups, allow tape to be append to if so desired, but ensure you pull tape from the system before it fills, store tape and wait until it’s protection period expires from the last “Tape Modified” time before you put tape back into system, when the tape is rotated back in run an inventory job on the tape first so system can see what tape it has from it’s catalog and in so doing it should note that if you have the protection period set correctly it will see that the tape is now over-writeable, start backup process all over again.\n\nCheers\n\nHopes this helps you out."
