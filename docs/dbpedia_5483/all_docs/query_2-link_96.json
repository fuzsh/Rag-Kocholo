        "text": "MM0001: Tape library is not detected by Windows Server 2003 MediaAgents\n\nSymptom\n\nWhen certain Windows updates and service packs are installed on Windows Server 2003 MediaAgents, tape libraries might not be detected.\n\nResolution\n\nApply the Windows hot fix as described in the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:\n\n\"Error returned by the IOCTL_SCSI_GET_INQUIRY_DATA operation on a Windows Server 2003-based computer: 'STATUS_INVALID_DEVICE_REQUEST'\", http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943545/en-us\n\nMM0002: Barcodes change after firmware upgrade or restart\n\nSymptom\n\nError Code 64:39: Media label does not match.\n\nCause\n\nAfter a library firmware is upgraded or restarted, the library reports all media with different barcodes than prior to the upgrade or restart. All of the media with data and existing spares are marked exported with no location and the error message appears.\n\nResolution\n\nMethod 1\n\nThis is the preferred method.\n\nFrom the CommCell Console, select Storage Resources | Libraries.\n\nRight-click the appropriate library, and then click Properties.\n\nThe Properties dialog box appears.\n\nClick the Status tab, and then clear the Enable Library check box.\n\nRefer to the library manual or contact your library hardware vendor to configure the library so that the library reads the barcodes the same way it read the barcodes before the upgrade or restart.\n\nAfter you or your library hardware vendor has configured the library, in the Properties dialog box, select the Enable Library check box on the Status tab.\n\nWhen the library is online, perform a full scan of the library.\n\nMake the media is listed in the old format.\n\nIn the case of assigned media, right-click the media, and then click View Contents to make sure that the media still has data.\n\nDelete all of the spares in the library that have a new barcode.\n\nSelect Storage Resources | Libraries | <Library Name> | Media by Groups | Default Scratch.\n\nHold down the Ctrl key, and then in the right pane, select all of the appropriate media.\n\nRight-click the selected media, and then click All Tasks | Delete.\n\nMethod 2\n\nUse this method if you want to change the barcode format.\n\nDelete all of the spares in the library with that have the new barcodes.\n\nSelect Storage Resources | Libraries | <Library Name> | Media by Groups | Default Scratch.\n\nHold down the Ctrl key, and then in the right pane, select all of the appropriate media.\n\nRight-click the selected media, and then click All Tasks | Delete.\n\nRight-click the library, and then click Update Barcodes.\n\nA message appears that asks you if you want to continue.\n\nClick Yes.\n\nThe Update Barcodes dialog box appears.\n\nIf you want, add a prefix/suffix to or remove a prefix/suffix from the barcode.\n\nClick OK.\n\nPerform a full scan of the library.\n\nMM0003: Block size errors occur during backup job or auxiliary copy operations\n\nSymptom\n\nThe backup job or Auxiliary Copy operation fails with one of the following error messages:\n\nError Code 25:31: A read error occurred for JobID [...] for the tape in Library [...] Drive [...]. Tape volume block size encountered is different from this product's standard. Please insert a new tape or erase the data on this tape and re-run the job.\n\nError Code 40:79: The block size is incorrect on the tape. Please format the tape using TapeTest.exe application and try again. For more help, call Customer Support.\n\nError Code 62:317: The current block size on the tape is incorrect.\n\nError Code 62:1154: While trying to read the media label on tape, the tape block size encountered is unrecognizable and unsupported by the application.\n\nCause\n\nYou used new media, or you used media that have already been formatted with a block size that is not supported by Commvault software. The media might have been used by another product previously. Commvault software supports only the values that are available in the software when you edit a data path.\n\nResolution\n\nPerform this procedure only if you are certain that the media are new or imported from a different backup environment.\n\nWarning\n\nIn this procedure, you format all of the media. Any data on the media will be erased.\n\nIf you have a small number of media, format the media with the TapeToolGUI.\n\nIf you have a large number of media, it might not be possible to format each one individually. Configure the software to overwrite the media automatically.\n\nNote\n\nThe Erase Media option is a licensed feature.\n\nFrom the CommCell Browser, go to Storage Resources | Libraries.\n\nRight-click the appropriate library, and then click Properties.\n\nIn the dialog box that appears, click the Media Usage tab.\n\nIn the Overwrite Media area, select When content verification fails.\n\nA warning appears that tells you that any errors will be ignored.\n\nRead the warning carefully, and then click OK.\n\nFrom the CommCell Browser, select Media by Location | Media in Library that is under the library that you selected previously.\n\nRight-click the media that you want to erase, and then click Options | Erase Media.\n\nMM0004: \"End-of-Data Marker\" and \"No More Data is on the Tape\" errors\n\nSymptom\n\nJob fails with one or more of the following errors:\n\nError Codes 40:6 or 40:64 Error occurred in Library [...],Drive Name [...],Barcode [...],Path [...] [The end-of-data marker was reached during an operation] For more help call please call your vendor's support hotline.\n\nError Code 40:78 The end-of-data marker was reached during an operation\n\nError Code 62:318 No more data is on the tape.\n\nCause\n\nAn error was encountered while the media was accessed, whether reading, seeking, or writing to it. In many cases, a portion of the media has been damaged. However, the error might be related to other hardware components.\n\nResolution\n\nMake sure the latest Service Pack is installed on the CommServeÂ® host and MediaAgents.\n\nNote\n\nThe CommServe host and all of the MediaAgents that are in the same CommCellÂ® group must include all of the additional updates to the same level of current Service Pack. In addition, you must apply any other updates that were released after the Service Pack to both the CommServe host and the MediaAgents.\n\nIf the error occurred during a backup, keep the media, but mark the media full so that no new backup uses this media. For more information, see Mark a Media Full.\n\nAlthough the media has bad sections, there might still be valid data on it, depending on where the error was encountered. However, the same errors might be encountered when you restore or copy data from this media.\n\nIf the error occurred during an auxiliary copy, you must prevent jobs that were written to the bad portion of the media from being copied so that the Auxiliary Copy operation can proceed.\n\nTo determine which job to disable, examine the error in the Event Viewer.\n\nThe Job ID that is listed in the Backup Jobs part of the error message is the job that was written to the damaged portion of the media.\n\nError Code 40:91 Failed to Copy or verify Chunk [...] in media [...], Storage Policy [...], Copy [...], Host [...], Path [...], File Number [...], Backup Jobs[...].\n\nPrevent the job from being copied. For more information, see Prevent Jobs from Being Copied.\n\nNote\n\nDepending on the location and extent of the damage, it might affect more than one job. Therefore, the jobs cannot be restored.\n\nIf the error occurred during a restore, data that was written to the damaged part of the media probably cannot be recovered.\n\nTo rule out the possibility of hardware or firmware issues, contact your library hardware vendor.\n\nMM0005: There is no media in the drive\n\nSymptom\n\nOne or more jobs may be pending or waiting with the error:\n\nFailed to mount media with barcode [...] side [...] into drive [...] in library [...] on host [...]. SCSI Operation: Load Tape Drive. Reason: There is no media in the drive. Advice: Please upload log files from CommServe MediaAgent and Client and contact your vendor s support hotline with the job ID of the failed job.\n\nResolution\n\nManually mount the media that is indicated in the error message into any of the drives.\n\nFrom the CommCell Browser, click Storage Resources | Libraries | <library> | Media By Location | Media In Library.\n\nRight-click the media, and then click All Tasks | Verify Media.\n\nIn the dialog box that appears, specify which resources are used to load media into a drive.\n\nClick OK.\n\nContinue to manually mount and verify each media.\n\nIf the error occurs for a specific media, the media is faulty.\n\nIf you cannot load the media into the drive through the front panel or by using the management software, the hardware is faulty.\n\nIf the hardware is faulty, contact your library hardware vendor.\n\nMM0006: Tape block size is not recognized while media label is read\n\nWhile the media is accessed, one of the following error occurs:\n\nError Code 62:1154: While trying to read the media label on tape, the tape block size encountered is unrecognizable and unsupported by the application.\n\nError Code 62:305: Tape volume block size selected is not supported by the underlying HBA card. Change Block size on data path to a lower level and start a new media.\n\nUsually, the error message accompanies a Failed to mount media with barcode error message.\n\nSymptom\n\nYour adapter and drive are not supported, or the driver software is not up to date.\n\nResolution\n\nUse the Hardware Compatibility Matrix to verify that your adapter and driver are supported.\n\nIf necessary, update your driver software to the latest version.\n\nIf updated the driver software recently, you might need to reinstall the previous version.\n\nSymptom\n\nYour HBA (Host Bus Adapter) card cannot handle the block size that is used, or the HBA is not supported. The default block size used is 64 KB, but 32 KB is appropriate for most HBA cards.\n\nResolution\n\nThe block sizes that the Commvault software supports might not be supported by the HBA card. This procedure validates the block sizes that are supported by the Commvault software.\n\nIn the CommCell Browser, navigate to Storage Policies | <library>.\n\nRight-click the appropriate drive, and then click Validate Drive.\n\nThe Validate Drives dialog box appears.\n\nSelect 32 from the Volume Block Size (KB) list, and then click OK.\n\nIf the validation succeeded, configure the data paths to use a 32 KB block size.\n\nFrom the CommCell Browser, right-click the appropriate storage policy copy, and then click Properties.\n\nThe Copy Properties dialog box appears.\n\nClick the Data Paths tab.\n\nSelect the appropriate data path, and then click Properties.\n\nThe Data Path Properties dialog box appears.\n\nIn the Block Size (KB) area, select Use specified value, and then select 32 from the list.\n\nClick OK.\n\nClick OK.\n\nIf the validation does not succeed for the 32 KB block size, repeat the validation procedure with each of the supported block sizes until the validation succeeds.\n\nIf the validation does not succeed regardless of which block size you used, then the HBA card might be defective and you must contact your library hardware vendor for assistance.\n\nMM0007: There is no active controller for the library\n\nOne or more jobs are pending or waiting with the following error:\n\nLibrary [], MediaAgent [], Drive Pool [], Media[]: There is no active controller for this library.\n\nResolution\n\nUsing the CommCell Console\n\nIn CommCell Console, check that the MediaAgents are online.\n\nIf the MediaAgents are not online, check that there is network connectivity between the CommServeÂ® host and the MediaAgents.\n\nIn the CommCell Browser, navigate to Storage Resources.\n\nRight-click the library that is offline, and then click Properties.\n\nThe Library Properties dialog box appears.\n\nClick the Library Controller tab and determine which MediaAgent is acting as the Active Library Controller.\n\nIf the MediaAgent is not the Active Library Controller, check the Failover Library Controller list.\n\nSelect the appropriate library controller, and then click Details.\n\nThe Library Controller details appear.\n\nClick Reset Controller.\n\nClick Close.\n\nCheck whether the library comes back online.\n\nYou might have to press F5 more than once to refresh the view.\n\nThe library should be online if the Active Library Controller is now the MediaAgent (MA).\n\nIf the library is not online after you reset the controller, use the MediaAgent to bring the library back online.\n\nUsing the MediaAgent\n\nLog onto that MediaAgent either remotely or directly.\n\nOpen the Windows Device Manager.\n\nMake sure that the Medium Changer is visible (either online or offline) in the Device Manager.\n\nMake sure that the correct number of drives is visible.\n\nCheck that each tape drive has a valid driver installed.\n\nIf there is no driver installed on the tape drives, download the driver from the library hardware vendor's Web site and install it.\n\nNote\n\nGo to the Compatibility Matrices to determine if the driver that you use is supported.\n\nIf either the Medium Changer or the correct number of drives does not appear in the Device Manager, then there might be a hardware error. In this case, contact your library hardware vendor.\n\nYou can try to restart the MediaAgent to see if drives appear. However, if the drives do not appear in the Device Manager, then they will not appear in the CommCell Console.\n\nIf the drives appear in the Device Manager, then open the Windows command prompt.\n\nNavigate to the \\\\Program Files\\[installation directory]\\Base directory, and then type scanscsitool to start the scanscsitool utility.\n\nAfter the scanscsitool utility starts, it provides information about the library and its drives.\n\nNote\n\nFor troubleshooting purposes, you should print the output of the scanscsitool to a text file.\n\nFor example: scanscsitool \\> c:\\\\scsi.txt.\n\nYou can open the file in Notepad.\n\nCheck the Library Information and make sure that the drive count is correct and that the serial number is visible. If the serial number is blank or the drive count is a negative number (-1), then the operating system cannot communicate with the Medium Changer.\n\nNote\n\nYou can try to change the status of the Medium Changer in the Device Manger. That is, either enable or disable the Media Changer, and then run the scanscsitool again. If that does not fix the issue, then there is a problem with the library hardware. In this case, contact the library hardware vendor.\n\nCheck the Tape Drive Information. Make sure that the SerialNumber is not blank.\n\nSometimes, the serial number can appear blank if there is a tape loaded in the drive.\n\nCheck to see if a tape is loaded. If one is, then you must unload the tape manually using the library's front panel.\n\nRun the scanscsitool again.\n\nIf there is no tape loaded, return to the Device Manager and make sure that each tape drive has a driver installed.\n\nUse the Device Manager to check all of the failover MediaAgents that are attached to this MediaAgent.\n\nIf all of the drives are correct, but the library does not come back online, then restart the Commvault services on the Medium Changer.\n\nIf the library is not online, send the logs from the MediaAgent and the CommServe host to your Software Provider.\n\nResolution\n\nIf you cannot reset the library or if it remains offline, check that:\n\nThere are no media stuck in the library.\n\nThe library's front panel status shows that it is ready and online.\n\nThe library is visible and accessible to the operating system.\n\nAt least one library controller MediaAgent is online.\n\nMM0008: Performing a read test with TapeToolGui utility\n\nYou can use the TapeToolGui to troubleshoot performance or damage issues on media. You must run the TapeToolGui.exe on the MediaAgent server that is attached to the tape drive the uses the media that you want to test.\n\nCaution\n\nMisuse of the TapeToolGui utility can result in data loss. We strongly recommended that you open a support case with your Contracted Support Service before you use the utility.\n\nVerify the Access Path for the Tape Drive\n\nUse this procedure for both Window-based servers and Unix-based servers to determine the tape drive's access path, and to load the media.\n\nFrom the CommCell Console, navigate to Storage Resources | Libraries | <library name> | <Master Drive Pool>.\n\nRight-click the drive where you will load the media, and then click Properties.\n\nIn the Drive Properties dialog box, do either of the following:\n\nIf the drive is active, click the Status tab, and then click Details in the Active Drive Controller area.\n\nIf the drive is not active, click the Drive Controller tab, select the appropriate drive controller, and then click Details.\n\nThe Drive Controller Details dialog box appears.\n\nWrite down the Access Path value.\n\nClick Close.\n\nClick OK.\n\nFrom the CommCell Console, navigate to Storage Resources | Libraries | <library name> | Media by Location | Media in Library.\n\nRight-click the appropriate media, and then click Load Media.\n\nIn the Load Media dialog box that appears, select the appropriate MediaAgent, Drive Pool, and Drive, and then click OK.\n\nCheck the Event Viewer to make sure that the media is loaded into the correct drive.\n\nBefore you continue, make sure that no jobs are using the MediaAgent.\n\nWindows-Based Servers\n\nUse this procedure for Windows-based servers to stop the MediaAgent services, and perform the read test using the TapeToolGui.\n\nEstablish a remote desktop connection to the appropriate MediaAgent.\n\nOn the Start menu, click All Programs | Commvault, and then click Process Manager.\n\nIn the Process Manager dialog box that appears, click the Services tab, and then select the appropriate MediaAgent.\n\nTo stop the MediaAgent services, click the button with the red square.\n\nIn the message that appears that asks you if you want to stop the services, click Yes.\n\nIn Windows Explorer, navigate to C:\\<software installation path>\\Base, and then double-click TestToolGui.exe.\n\nTo make sure that you loaded the correct media, select Read Label, and then select the access path that you recorded previously from the Tape Name list.\n\nClick Start.\n\nIn the Operation Results area, information about the media appears, including the On Media Label (OML) and the media's original barcode. If the OML does not appear, the media is either blank or it has been overwritten.\n\nAfter you have verified that it is the correct media, select Read.\n\nSelect the access path from the Tape Name list, and make sure the Block Size value is 64.\n\nThe Read operation reads the data from the media at the file level and reports statistics based on EOF. You only need to specify File Mark if you want to test a specific portion of the media.\n\nClick Start.\n\nTapeToolGui reads the media and logs the current file mark and the amount of data that is read for reference.\n\nIn the Process Manager dialog box, click the green arrow button to start the MediaAgent services.\n\nFrom the CommCell Console, navigate to Storage Resources | Libraries | <library name> | Media by Location | Media in Library.\n\nRight-click the media that you tested, and then click Unload Media.\n\nUNIX-Based Servers\n\nUse this procedure for Unix-based servers to stop the MediaAgent services, and perform the read test using the TapeToolGui.\n\nTo stop the MediaAgent services, at the Unix prompt # or [root@servername], type:\n\n[root@servername]# commvault stop <instance_name>\n\nThen press Enter.\n\nPress Enter.\n\nA list of the detected devices appears.
