        "text": "In this guide, you will learn how to apply sticker, iron-on and sew-on name labels to childrenâs clothing, shoes and equipment. We will go through in detail what the different label types are and how to use them, to make your life easier.\n\nChildren lose a large number of items when going to school or nursery, labelling everything will make sure that you save yourself money and we save the planet from unnecessary landfill.\n\nWe will also cover the use of name tags in care homes.\n\nIf you have a specific question, just jump to the relevant chapter using the links below.\n\nHow to stick on sticker labels\n\nHow to iron on iron on labels\n\nHow to sew on name tapes\n\nOther ways to apply name tags\n\nWhere to put on labels\n\nHow can you remove name labels\n\nWhere to buy name labels\n\nName Labels for Care Homes\n\nMy Nametags recommendations\n\nHow to stick on sticker labels\n\nWhat is a sticker name label?\n\nStick on labels for labelling clothing or equipment can be seen as a multi-layered puzzle, from the top you have the ink, then the label, then glue and lastly the backing paper. We will look at each of these in more details:\n\nInk â This ink is used to print the personalised information such as name, information and decorations on the label. It needs to adhere to the label material, and should be water-resistant and rub/scratch resistant to be durable. It is possible to put a layer of lamination on top of the label, to protect the ink, but this makes the label more stiff and less comfortable. A lamination layer can also detach from the label (called delamination) over time, as water gets under the lamination layer.\n\nLabel â The labels are usually made from a plastic material. Cheaper labels are made from paper, but these are not good for surviving washing machines/dish washers or being lost outdoors. Plastic labels need to use plasticisers to soften the label (imagine the difference between a hard plastic toy and a flexible plastic label), and it is important that the labels do not use phthalates as plastic softeners.\n\nGlue â Stickers will use a strong adhesive to keep the label stuck to the equipment or clothing. The glue need to hold on in a wash cycle and outdoors. If a label has an inferior glue, the label will fall off after a few washes, but a good label will stick on clothing and stay on for numerous washes.\n\nBacking paper â The labels are stuck onto a siliconised backing paper or backing sheet. The silicon makes it easy to remove the labels from the backing paper. Some companies do not remove the rubbish label material between the labels, making it harder to take off the labels.\n\nDo stick on childrenâs name labels work?\n\nThe quality of sticker uniform labels has improved a lot over the last twenty years, and the majority of childrenâs name tags sold in the UK are now stickers. There are a number of reasons for name stickers being popular:\n\nEasy to use â Just peel off and stick to clothes, shoes and equipment\n\nStay on in the wash â when applied correctly, quality name stickers will stay on in the washing machine, tumble dryer and dishwasher\n\nOne type fits all â with sticker name labels, there is no need to order multiple types, you can use stickers for all your labelling needs\n\nMany modern fabrics cannot be ironed â a number of acrylics and fleeces can not be ironed, so sticker name labels is the perfect solution\n\nWhat is a quality name sticker?\n\nAnyone can make sticky labels, but there is a large difference between low quality stick on labels and high quality ones. Chose a company that has been around for a long time, and has won awards and has a number of positive reviews. Good customer service is important, but it is tricky to assess until things go wrong - look at reviews to get an idea. Here are some things to look out for\n\nArea High Quality Low Quality Company Company Queenâs Award, ISO 9001 or similar quality awards\n\nBeen around for a long time\n\nA substantial number of reviews Writing/print Stays on in the wash for years Fades quickly\n\nRubs off, needs heel protectors because the print is not resistant enough Shape Labels with rounded edges are more likely to stay on in the wash Some companies cut their labels square, these labels are more likely to catch on other items/clothes and fall off Glue Does not fall off Fall of quickly in the wash\n\nHow to apply sticker name labels?\n\nIt is easy to apply sticker nametags, as long as you follow certain basic rules.\n\n- Make sure the surface you apply the labels to is clean and dry\n\n- If you put the sticker school name labels on clothing, ideally put the labels on the care/washing label. If that is not possible, the brand label might also work\n\n- Try to make sure that no part of the sticky label goes out over the edge of any label or surface\n\n- Apply the labels from one side, and try not to get any air bubbles under the labels\n\nHow to iron on iron on labels\n\nWhat is an iron-on name label?\n\nAn iron on nametag for labelling clothing contains multiple elements, and to better understand how such labels work, it might be helpful to look at the layers. Please note that iron-on name labels are only meant to be used on clothing and fabric items, do not use these labels on equipment.\n\nSiliconised paper â Most iron-on name labels are delivered with siliconised paper. This paper protects the label and the ink from the high direct heat of an iron, and ensures that no part of the label sticks to the iron. If you do not have siliconised paper, you might be able to use baking paper or parchment paper, but not all non-stick papers are good for this, so you might have to experiment. The reason the paper has a silicone coating is that this makes it non-stick, so the paper will not stick to the label or iron, and the label/ink will not stick to the paper.\n\nInk â This ink is used to print the name, information and decorations on the label. It needs to adhere to the label material, and should be water-resistant and rub/scratch resistant to be durable. In addition, the ink needs to be very resistant to heat, as we are going to be applying a lot of heat to the surface of the label. It is possible to put a layer of lamination on top of the label, to protect the ink, but this makes the label more stiff and less comfortable, and many laminates get damaged by the high heat from an iron. A lamination layer can also detach from the label (called delamination) over time, as water gets under the lamination layer.\n\nLabel â The labels are usually made from a plastic material. Cheaper labels are made from paper, but these are not good for surviving washing machines/dish washers or being lost outdoors. Paper based labels could also be damaged by the heat of an iron. Plastic labels need to use plasticisers to soften the label (imagine the difference between a hard plastic toy and a flexible plastic label), and it is important that the labels do not use phthalates as plastic softeners.\n\nGlue â Stickers will use a strong hot-melt adhesive to keep the label stuck to the equipment or clothing. The glue might be slightly sticky or not sticky at all when cold. This glue is quite complex. When heated, it should transform from a solid to a more liquid state to better adhere to the clothing, and as it cools down it creates a strong bond between the label and the clothing fibres. You usually need to wait 24 hours for the glue to properly cool down and fully bond with the textile. The glue need to hold on in a wash cycle and outdoors. If a label has an inferior glue, the label will fall off after a few washes.\n\nBacking paper â The labels are stuck onto a siliconised backing paper. The silicon makes it easy to remove the labels from the backing sheet. Some companies do not remove the rubbish label material between the labels, making it harder to take off the labels.\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.\n\nIrons\n\nWhen ironing on children's name tags, you want to have high heat. On most irons, you can select three dots or a Linen/Cotton setting, or just turn the dial to maximum, before applying the iron.\n\nMost people assume that all irons are the same, and it does not matter which one you use. Sadly, irons vary a lot, and it is useful to know the differences. The main difference between irons is that some (typically older) irons can be set to a very hot temperature, whilst cheaper or newer irons tend to have a lower maximum temperature. For the hot-melt glue of an iron on label to melt properly, it usually requires a temperature around 150-170 degrees C for several seconds. To get the glue heated to this temperature with a lower heat iron, you might have to apply the (lower) heat for longer. This is the main problem when applying iron-on labels, that people do not use the iron for long enough.\n\nDo not use the steam function when applying iron onto the name labels. The water from the steam could get into the hot-melt glue and weaken the glue. More importantly, as you are likely to have a waterproof silicone paper between you and the label, the steam is likely to come up and can hurt your hand. Some irons do not heat to the max temperature when turning off steam, so it might be that you have to empty out the water from your iron so that you can set it to highest temperature.\n\nSome newer irons have an automated heat setting. These irons are supposed to be easier to use, but typically the heat setting is so low that it might not be possible to get the glue to melt.\n\nSome people might suggest using straightening irons instead of an iron. Whilst this might work, you are better off controlling the process with a proper iron.\n\nThe tip of an iron is good to get to corners, but sometimes not as hot as the main iron, so you might need to iron for longer.\n\nDo iron on labels stay on?\n\nWhen iron on name labels first were released several decades ago, the hotmelt glue that they used was not great, and these first iron on name labels could not compete with sew ons. However, in the last 15 years, the quality of the glue has increased, and the best companies now offer 10 year guarantees that their labels will stay on in washing machines and tumble dryers. With these high quality labels, there is no need to use sew on labels ever again. So yes, personalised iron on labels do work, and work well.\n\nHow long do iron on labels last?\n\nThe nature of the modern hotmelt glue for iron on nametags means that these labels will stay on for as long as your child (or elderly relative) will be using the garment.\n\nAre iron on labels any good?\n\nIron on school labels are excellent for natural fabrics like wool or cotton, that can take high heat. However, they require a high heat to apply, so some fabrics like fleeces might melt or be damaged by the heat of the iron. Check the washing instructions on the piece of clothing to find out if it you can apply iron to the fabric. If you cannot use an iron, you could sew on a label, but you might be better off using a name sticker to stick onto the garment.\n\nWhilst these iron on name tags are excellent for clothing, it is much harder to use them for shoes. You need to be able to apply high heat to a part of the shoe without damaging it, and it is much easier to use a sticker name tag for shoes. Similarly for equipment such as water bottles.\n\nTroubleshooting applying iron-on name labels\n\nWhat can go wrong when applying iron on name tags?\n\nProblem Solution\n\nLabel not staying on the clothing at all Your iron might be too cold. Maybe it is not plugged in, or set on a very low setting.\n\nLabel corners still not staying on Iron the label and the corner for longer. You might have a colder iron, so need to\n\niron for a longer time. Labels falling off in the wash\n\nIf your labels are falling off in the wash, they were probably not attached properly.\n\nSome companies use low-quality hotmelt adhesive on their iron on labels to save money, but if you have gone with a quality company, it is probably that the labels were not heated enough. You need to reapply with either more heat or a longer time. Print melting on the labels\n\nDid you use a silicone paper between the label and the iron? Try not to move\n\nthe iron, just set it down and keep it still for the required time. Silicone paper stuck to label\n\nYour silicone paper is not siliconized enough. If you have lost the silicone paper that came with the labels and tried to use baking paper instead, you might need to contact the company to ask them to send more proper silicone paper to use. Clothing is melting\n\nIron on labels need a lot of heat to melt into the fabric. Some fabrics, like acrylics or fleece materials, cannot take so much heat. Either iron at lower temperatures\n\nfor a lot longer, or use name stickers instead.\n\nHow to sew on name tapes?\n\nWhat is a sew on name tape?\n\nUnlike iron on and stick on name labels, sew on name tapes use no glue to fix the label, instead relying on you sewing it on.\n\nSorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.\n\nDifferent sew on name tapes\n\nEmbroidered â these name tapes are usually made from white bleached cotton or a cotton-like plastic material. The name is embroidered on the name tape, and you can usually choose the thread colour and the writing style. They are the most traditional nametapes, as this was the only way to do name labels until about 30 years ago.\n\nPrinted â these are a cheaper way to create a classic-looking name tape without the expense. They are typically made of plastic. Make sure that the print quality is high and the ink is sufficiently water resistant.\n\nWrite yourself â This is the simplest version, just a fabric strip that you write on yourself and a permanent marker. They need no personalisation, so you can buy it at department stores like John Lewis. The problem with permanent markers is that they tend to fade in wash, so the name is at best blurry and at worst illegible. The tape is most often a cheap cotton-like plastic tape.\n\nDo sew on name tapes work\n\nSew on nametapes will stay on, if your sewing is good enough and if you have chosen high quality name tapes. Lower quality fabric labels might be printed, and the print might fade, but proper sew on labels should be embroidered and stay on.\n\nTypically most sew on labels will have corners sticking out, so they might itch children's necks.\n\nThis is the traditional solution, so some boarding schools might still insist on it, even if more modern labels are as good or better than the old sew on nametapes.\n\nHow do you sew a label by hand?\n\nSome name tapes are cut into the perfect size, whilst others are delivered on a roll. If you have roll of clothing labels, cut off the correct length.\n\nDecide what thread to use. Sew on name tags are usually white, so you could chose this as a colour. Alternatively you can select a colour that fits the garment, so that any stiches outside of the name tape will be practically invisible. Finally, if you are confident in your stiches looking beautiful and perfect, you could select a contrasting thread colour to make your stitches stand out. Cotton thread is the most common to use.\n\nThen, decide where to apply the label. This is usually the neck area of shirts and blazers and the back of trousers or skirts. You can pin it in place with a pin going in the direction of the label (so you can sew around it).\n\nThread your needle with a thread about 25cm (10-12 inches) long. Tie a solid knot at the end of the thread.\n\nDecide on what type of stitch you would like to use. Here are some of the different stiches you might consider:\n\nEnd stitching only, leaving middle unstitched. Remember to fold the short ends underneath to prevent fraying\n\nPut the two ends together to form a loop, and attached the ends to each other and the garment\n\nStich all along the label (see different stiches below)\n\nIf you select to sew all along the label you have to decide on what type of stitch you would like to use. You can read more about this on the Takelessons website.\n\nRunning stich â Easiest stitch\n\nBlanket stitch â covers the label and is hard to remove. Not great on flexible clothing as they do not stretch\n\nWhip stitch â faster than blanket stitch. Can look very nice with contrasting coloured stitches\n\nIs this the traditional English solution?\n\nCashâs name tapes were launched in England and the UK in 1870s. Originally, the company made silk ribbons in Coventry, a centre for textile manufacturing. However, after just over 100 years their machines were too old and people started migrating from sew on clothing labels to iron on and stick on name labels. Cashâs currently manufactures their labels in China, so the traditional English name tapes are no longer made in Britain. You can read the story about the closure here.\n\nOther ways to apply name tags\n\nThere are alternative ways to apply name tags to clothing, that are less common.\n\nEmbroidering name\n\nSome school uniform shops might offer to embroider your childâs name into the blazer or school uniform. You could also embroider a childâs name into each garment yourself. This is likely to take much more time than sticking or ironing name labels onto the clothing, but it will look more elegant. You could also embroider a small animal or similar next to their name.\n\nThe last option for embroidering names into clothing is if you have a tailor who can do this for you. This is typically done when making a garment, but you could ask if they would do this on all clothing.\n\nGetting help putting on name labels or name tapes\n\nThe obvious answer to get help with ironing or sewing might be that grandparent who lives nearby. Both ironing and sewing skills were stronger before, so older people tend to be better at these things. If you have a nanny or domestic help, you might also ask them (and you can show them this simple guide if they need help). There are other outsourcing or concierge services that might find people who can help you, too. But the easiest way is probably just to use sticker name labels that stay on clothing and equipment, that way you can bypass both ironing and sewing.\n\nApplicators for name labels\n\nSome systems try to find other easy to apply ways to apply name labels to clothing, such as press and click, snap on or snappy tags applicators. Often they end up with plastic bits that might itch or annoy your child, so be careful that you understand how these systems work before buying them.\n\nLaundry stamps\n\nAnother seemingly perfect solution is to use fabric stamps or laundry stamps for your children's clothing. This is a stamp, often with a personalised message such as your childâs name and phone number. It uses permanent fabric ink to apply the name to the inside of a garment or a care label. It is a very simple and quick to use system.\n\nWhen using laundry stamps, the ink will often bleed through the fabric to the other side, so make sure that this will not cause an unsightly mark on your childrenâs clothing. The ink is likely to fade over time, so your kids' name and your phone number might look ugly or not be readable after a while. Once you have stamped a garment, it is impossible to remove, so if you want to hand the clothing down to another sibling or give it to charity afterwards, this might not be the ideal solution. Bear in mind that a black ink laundry stamp on works on white or very light backgrounds.\n\nPermanent markers\n\nPermanent markers or laundry markers are easy to buy and to use to write your kidâs name into clothing. However, most permanent markers will fade and they often bleed through the garment, leaving an unsightly ugly unreadable mess. In addition, you cannot remove it for a younger sibling or for giving away to a charity shop. Use iron on or sticker name tags instead!\n\nWhere to put on labels\n\nWhat kind of item would benefit from an iron-on nametag?\n\nYou can successfully put an iron-on nametag onto many different types of clothing and also some non-clothing items. Most things made of fabric that need to be personalised can benefit from iron-on school name labels. Stickers also work on clothing, but the location of the iron-ons or stickers is key to keeping them on and not seeing them fall off in the wash.\n\nNow that you have the iron-ons and you have the thing to be labelled, where on the item should you place the iron-on? What about the stickers? Should you place an iron-on in the same place as a sticker?\n\nGood quality stickers and iron-ons will not be hard and scratchy like the old generation iron-ons so you can put them on the inside of clothing without worrying if it will scratch your childâs skin.\n\nLabelling shirts and blouses\n\nIron ons\n\nLetâs start with school uniform shirts and blouses and where best to put an iron-on nametag. To be able to see at a glance to whom the piece of clothing belongs, the best place to put the iron-on is on the inside of the blouse or shirt near the neck. You could put the iron-on on the manufacturerâs label (covering the label) or right next to the manufacturerâs label on the fabric of the shirt or blouse. Either way, the name will be very visible if picking up the shirt from the lost property box or sorting laundry. Anyone who picks up the school shirt can see that it belongs to your child and they can get the uniform back to you quickly.\n\nAnother option for shirts and blouses which is not so visible but effective, is to put the iron-on on the washing label. That is usually found down the side of clothing, sown into a side seam. That is where someone would check to see if the article of clothing has a name on it.\n\nStickers\n\nStickers can be placed on the washing or care label of the shirts and blouses. These labels can be found down the side of the shirt or blouse and will usually say the size of the shirt, what washing temperature to use and where the shirt is made. It is made of nylon and is a perfect smooth surface onto which to put the sticker nametag. The nametag will stay on in the wash because it can adhere extremely well to the washing care label. The sticker is also usually the right size for a good fit onto the care label, if made by a reputable company. For good measure stick a sticker school name label on both sides of the washing label. Simply peel it off the backing paper and stick it to the nylon label, making sure you do not go over the edge of the washing label.\n\nAnother place to put the sticker is on the manufacturer or brand label. Sometime these labels are bumpy because they are woven and will not provide the absolutely best sticking surface, but as a temporary measure, it is a good place to put the sticker nametags.\n\nAlso, the material of the actual blouse or shirt could be a good place, although the sticker may not be there after a number of washes because the material may not provide the smoothest surface for the glue. The stickers, if of good quality, should stick for a number of washes, but will eventually come off and will need to be replaced when put onto rough cloth.\n\nLabelling skirts and trousers\n\nIron ons\n\nFor school skirts and trousers the same rules applies â iron the nametags onto the fabric of the skirt or trousers right next to the manufacturerâs label, on the manufacturerâs label or onto the washing/care label. Again, think about where you want the nametag to be visible.\n\nStickers\n\nStickers do best on smooth surfaces so the washing or care label is the optimum surface on any skirts and trousers. Find the care label sewn into the seam usually around the pocket area of the inside of a pair of trousers or a skirt.\n\nLabelling Coats and Blazers\n\nThe key to labelling coats and blazers is to tell the person who is looking at it, who the owner is, and so it is best to iron the nametag in a location that is clearly visible on the inside of the jacket or coat. At school, many coats and jackets look alike and to avoid picking up the wrong one, the label should be placed somewhere where it is easy to see. This avoids mix-ups. Anyone can quickly see the ownerâs name.\n\nIron ons\n\nCoats and blazers have synthetic linings. Appy an iron-on nametag to the lining near the neck area, taking special care to protect the fabric of the lining by covering it with a piece of silicone paper which is usually provided by the nametags company.\n\nStickers\n\nPeel the sticker off the backing paper and stick it to the care or washing label on the inside side of the coat or blazer. Quality nametags will stay on the washing label. As a temporary measure you could put the sticker on the lining fabric up by the neck if the coat or blazer is not going to be washed frequently.\n\nLabelling Socks\n\nIron ons\n\nIron-on name labels are great for socks. Where you iron the nametag depends on whether you want the label to be visible when you wear the sock or not. For discreet labelling, iron the nametags onto the outside underside of the sock, where you cannot see it because it is under the foot. The best place on the underside is on the arch where neither the ball or the heel rub the nametag on the shoe. Rubbing the nametag on the inside of a sweaty shoe may cause the print to fade over a prolonged period of time. For obvious labelling, put the nametag on the outside of the sock by the ankle or at the top of the sock.\n\nRegardless of where the iron-on goes onto the sock, a good tip is to put the label in a position where it is least likely to stretch. Take a close look at the grain of the sock fabric. In which direction is to less likely to stretch? Place the iron-on nametag lengthways along the grain of the fabric. This avoid stretching the nametag.\n\nStickers\n\nStickers work very well in most places but not on socks. This is because the socks stretch, they do not have a care label and often the fabric of the sock is not smooth enough to allow a sticker to adhere to it properly.\n\nLabelling underwear\n\nIron ons\n\nYou can label your underwear on the inside or outside. Apply the nametag directly onto the fabric, being careful with the maximum temperature of the iron. Things to consider here are who is going to be looking at the garment and where would you like the name to be visible? The outside would be a good place if communal laundry is involved. Quick sorting is key and the outside would be the most visible place to put the iron-on nametags.\n\nStickers\n\nThe stickers can be put on the care/washing label if the underwear has one. If not, place it somewhere where the fabric is less prone to being stretched.\n\nLabelling Gym Kit/Sportswear\n\nIron ons\n\nIt is a little trickier to decide where to put the iron-on or whether an iron-on is appropriate at all. The answer will depend on what the type of fabric of the sportswear\n\nIf the kit is made of thin lycra, it is best not to put the iron-on onto the fabric of the garment because the high temperature of the iron may damage the fabric. In this case, put the iron-on nametag on the care/washing label. That will be made of nylon and will be able to take the heat of the iron.\n\nCotton or heavier synthetic sports kit can take the heat of the iron so the iron-ons will work on these types of clothing. The basic rule of thumb is check the material! Make sure the iron does not come directly into contact with synthetic materials. Usually, a silicone sheet of paper is provided so that this can be avoided.\n\nStickers\n\nStickers work very well on very smooth synthetic materials. Name the sportswear by putting the sticker on the care/washing label or try putting the sticker directly on the fabric. If you have put the sticker on the fabric (and not the washing label), wash the item a few times to see if the sticker stays on.\n\nLabelling bed linen/towels/kitchen\n\nIron ons\n\nBed linen/towels/kitchen linen tends to have a high cotton component and can take high heat. An iron-on nametag works well for household linens. Towels can be textured and so would not work so well for stickers unless you have a smooth care or washing label on the linen.\n\nLabel wherever you think would be most practical. This would usually be on the edge of the towel or bed linen by a corner. Holiday homes and catered accommodation uses iron-ons to mark their bed linen and that is practical so that you know where to store the linen, what type of linen it is and where it belongs to.\n\nLabelling shoes\n\nStickers\n\nThe best shoe labels are stickers, as they can easily be stuck anywhere inside a shoe. Labels under the tongue of the shoe are protected and will not rub against the foot, but they are not very visible. Put labels for shoes on the sole or on the side near the heel, as long as the label is good enough to withstand the rubbing. Some low quality shoe labels have to be protected with a shoe shield, essentially a transparent sticker to put on top of the label.\n\nLabelling school items\n\nStickers\n\nSticker labels are the best for labelling school items like pencils, lunch boxes, water bottles, books and other equipment. Stick on school labels can be stuck on a place that is easy to see, in case the items are lost and picked up by nursery/school staff. The personalised stickers should have the name of the child as well as your mobile number, to make it easy to return the items to you.\n\nHow can you remove name labels?\n\nWhat are the reasons for removing nametags?\n\nHow do you remove sticky name tags?\n\nIf you want to remove a sticky name tag from a school uniform, garment or equipment, you should be able to just peel it off. Depending on the label, and of how long it has been on the item, it might come off in pieces. The only challenging thing is to remove the glue afterwards.\n\nHow to remove an iron on name label\n\nAn iron on label is usually fairly difficult to remove, as the glue ensures that the iron on label is glued deeply into the garment. The easiest solution might be to iron another label on top, either with the name (if giving to a sibling or a friend) or just ask the name label company for some blank iron on labels that you can apply on top (if giving to a charity shop or used school uniform sale).\n\nIf you have to remove the label you can put silicone paper or a wet towel on top of the label, and then heat with an iron, in the same way as when you applied the label (a towel is thicker, so might need more time). When the glue is warm enough, you might be able to remove the label with tweezers whilst the label is hot. Careful when removing, as the label can burn your fingers.\n\nHow can you remove sew on name labels?\n\nSew on labels are usually easy, but time consuming, to remove. Just unstitch the label and remove. Careful that you do not damage the fabric.\n\nWhere to buy name labels?\n\nPrinting school labels in store\n\nWhen buying school uniforms and childrenâs clothing, some shops can print school uniform labels while you wait. Whilst this sounds great, the quality is usually not great when printing in store, as the printers they use are not the best for making name labels. The ink is typically not very rub resistant, and there is a very limited choice of designs available.\n\nSome stores allow you to order sew on labels in store. They are then made and shipped to you. This was the standard way for Cashâsâ nametapes when they were made in Britain. In the past, many supermarkets and stores like Wilko, Asda, Argos, M&S (Marks and Spencer), Morrisonâs, Sainsburys and in the US, Walmart and Kmart, would allow you to order iron on and sew on labels in store. Most of these have stopped this, as it is more convenient online.\n\nBuying labels online\n\nBuying name labels online is the standard way to order labels. You can design and personalise online, and labels are delivered quickly. Some companies offer labels on Amazon, but the best design options are usually on label companies homepages.\n\nWe offer the only Queenâs Award-winning name tags in the UK on the My Nametags website.\n\nName Labels for Care Homes\n\nDo I need name labels in care homes?\n\nIf you or a relative is moving into a care home, assisted living or communal living accommodation, they will probably need name labels for all their personal possessions. It is very easy to have clothing and items swapped between residents, and you do not want to lose items just due to the communal washing. It is very important for the dignity of the older people that they are able to keep using their own clothing.\n\nThe best way to avoid this is to make sure that all clothing and equipment (such as glasses cases) are clearly labelled, ideally with colourful labels that are very easy to spot. This will also help staff to sort things, as you can imagine the work it is to try to identify unlabelled clothing at every wash.\n\nWhat labels do I need in a care home?\n\nFor a resident in a care home or nursing home, you need both iron on and sticker labels. Iron-on labels are used for all articles of clothing, whilst the stickers are used for shoes and everything else.\n\nYou can also go with sew on labels instead of iron on, but it will take a lot longer to sew these onto all pieces of clothing.\n\nWhere to put labels for care home residents?\n\nMake sure you put name stickers on glasses cases, on the reading glasses or normal glasses themselves, pillboxes, favourite books etc. You can also put sticker nametags on shoes. In short, all their personal possessions should have name tags.\n\nIron-on name labels can be put on all clothing items.\n\nMy Nametags recommendations\n\nWhat is the best way to label clothes?\n\nWhen labelling childrenâs clothes, shoes and equipment, we would recommend that you use name stickers on almost everything. These labels are very quick to apply, and they stay on care labels in the wash. Because the labels are so easy to use, you are likely to actually put them on all items, and probably save money as items your child loses comes back to you.\n\nFor socks and underwear, where there is no label, we would suggest you use iron-on nametags.\n\nWhat are the best name labels?\n\nMy Nametags is the market leader in the UK, as the quality of our name tags has been appreciated for more than 15 years. We are the only name label company with a Queenâs Award. We were the first company in the UK to guarantee our iron on labels for 10 years, and this is one more testament to the quality of our products.\n\nAt My Nametags, we have tested all our competitorsâ products, and we believe our name labels are the best in the market, if not the world. But donât take our word for it, just look at the number of positive comments we have received from customers over years.\n\nYou can design your My Nametags labels online now."
