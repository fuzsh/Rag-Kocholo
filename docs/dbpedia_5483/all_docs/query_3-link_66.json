HSM notifies CA-1\n\nwhen a tape can be released and put back into the scratch pool. Since HSM\n\nbelieves these tapes are scratch, then HSM notified CA-1 and CA-1 scratched\n\nthe tapes.

There's an air of \"We know best, just do as we say\" about this.\n\nThen I peeked at your address, \"Northern Territory Government\". That'll be\n\nthe city of Darwin I expect. How appropriate that the place where this\n\nevolutionary step first (perhaps I shouldn't be so sure about that) happened\n\nshould be named after the person who is normally acknowledged as the person\n\nwho first proposed the relevant theory.\n\nHowever, whenever the matter of the birth of the theory of evolution comes\n\nup, it should be noted that, some way to the north and west of the city of\n\nDarwin, there is an imaginary line on the surface of the seas separating the\n\nislands of the Malay Archipelago, now Indonesia, called \"Wallace's Line\"[1].\n\nIt is named after Alfred Russel Wallace who eked out an existence among the\n\nislands acquiring exotic specimens for wealthy collectors. In doing so his\n\ninquiring mind also came up with the famous theory and, knowing Darwin, he\n\nsent him a summary, asking him whether he thought the idea was worth\n\npublishing. Darwin was now forced both to finish his leisurely writing on\n\nthe same topic and acknowledge Wallace as a co-author in a paper to the\n\nLinnean Society.\n\nBy rights, the famous theory should be named after both Darwin and Wallace.\n\nChris Mason\n\n[1] Essentially separating Asian and Australian mammals.\n\n----- Original Message -----\n\nFrom: \"Fred Schmidt\" <***@ibm-main.lst>\n\nNewsgroups: bit.listserv.ibm-main\n\nTo: <IBM-***@BAMA.UA.EDU>\n\nSent: Wednesday, 19 April, 2006 7:32 AM\n\nSubject: How to identify what is on a duplexed HSM migration tape marked as\n\nScratch\n\nPost by F***@ibm-main.lst\n\nHi fellow listers,\n\nWe have suddenly seen a large number of tapes appear on our daily scratch\n\nvolume list.
