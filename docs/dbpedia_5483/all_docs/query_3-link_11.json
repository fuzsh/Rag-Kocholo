        "text": "Hi,\n\na question related to HP Data Protector Manager v A.09.00...\n\nthis week I replace a Backup guy. Have a quesion about moving scratch tapes to working Pool.\n\nI had 3 min instructions so forgot one step that quickly put on paper (not my fault :) )\n\nso, what I did:\n\n1. found the tape with yesterday's back and removed it (was week 2)\n\n2. inserted Tapes for a new week (Week 3 in my case)\n\nThe guy told me that he takes a photo of tapes before inserting them ... and then I should find them and move in DP Manager.\n\nSo what I could do ...\n\n1. In HP DP Manager I moved the tape with yesterdays backup (that phisically removed) from working pool (Default LTO-Ultrium) to CS (it is Scratch pool).\n\n2. Since I didn't take the photo of tapes that I inserted I decided to make it even simpler :)\n\n(don't think that I have to have the tapes names before inserting them to the library (take a photo like instructed.)\n\nIn the scratch pool (SC) I see Expired with horisontal green tape icon. So for me it is a sign that those tapes could freely go to the working pool. This what I did: just moved them to working pool Default LTO Ultrium.\n\nCould somebody confirm that I did right? (or what is my mistake if any...)\n\nThanks."
