        "text": "There are two different technologies when it comes to thermal printing: direct thermal and thermal transfer. It is important to know the differences as each have their own pros and cons to printing as well as varying degrees of application.\n\nLet’s take a look and see what each method has to offer so you’ll know if direct thermal or thermal transfer is right for you.\n\nDirect thermal (DT) printing utilizes heat-sensitive paper that has ink embedded within the label material. When this paper comes into contact with the hot temperature of the print head, it changes color before rapidly cooling, leaving behind the desired text or image. Direct thermal printing is easier to use since it does not require ink, toner, or ribbon.\n\nThis means less supplies and lower maintenance costs overall. Direct thermal is a versatile choice as it can be used in industrial, desktop, and mobile printers.\n\nScale printers in grocery and retail industries are also an example of direct thermal printers.\n\nBecause it uses heat-sensitive materials, direct thermal labels do not have a long shelf-life, usually lasting around six to eight months. They have a tendency to scratch easily, and overexposure to direct sunlight or high temperatures will cause the print to fade faster.\n\nThese labels are more scratch and rub resistant than direct thermal, and able to last for up to two-years.\n\nThermal transfer printing does depend on several factors: media type, printer model, and application. Specific thermal ribbon materials are best suited for specific substrate materials, as the overall print quality can be affected.\n\nNeed to find thermal transfer labels?
