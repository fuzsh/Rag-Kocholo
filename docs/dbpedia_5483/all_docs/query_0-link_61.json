        "text": "No Returns Policy\n\nAll our orders are custom and cut to size. Due to the nature of our process, we are unable to accept any returns or exchanges.\n\nWarranty Info\n\nNatural Fiber Fabric Variations: All natural fiber fabrics may present small holes, runs, etc. This is a natural characteristic of these materials, and out of our control. We proactively include extra yardage to compensate for any such imperfections.\n\nFabric and Roll Variability: All bolts & rolls may exhibit a +/- 10% variation. Our discounted pricing accounts for any discrepancies, ensuring value for our customers.\n\nSeams and Damage Allowance: Bolts & Rolls may contain seams or marks from the manufacturing process. Extra yardage is always provided to account for this.\n\nCustom Cut Products: All fabrics and sewing accessories are precisely tailored to your specifications, making them non-returnable.\n\nPackaging Variations: Snaps & some elastics are packaged by weight, hence count is approximate. Our pricing reflects these minor quantity discrepancies.\n\nWaterproof Fabric Aesthetics - Our waterproof fabrics are designed primarily for their functional attributes, ensuring they provide effective moisture barriers for a variety of applications. Due to variations in the manufacturing process and the availability of materials, the waterproof side of the fabric may display aesthetic inconsistencies, including but not limited to variations between shiny or matte finishes, as well as differences in texture such as dot matrix or fluid matrix patterns. These variations do not affect the functional integrity of the waterproof barrier. We understand the importance of both function and aesthetics for your projects and strive to provide fabrics that meet your needs while ensuring the highest quality and performance.\n\nWash and Care Instructions: To preserve the integrity and performance of our fabrics, please follow the provided care guidelines. Improper care may affect fabric performance.\n\nPerformance Under Various Conditions: The efficacy of our specialty fabrics (waterproof, absorbent, etc.) may evolve with environmental factors and wear. We design our products to deliver sustained performance.\n\nProduct Improvements: We continually strive to improve our products for better performance and sustainability. As such, you may receive a product that has been slightly updated from what is shown in our product images. These improvements are part of our commitment to innovation and delivering the best quality to our customers.\n\nSpecs Disclaimer\n\nThis information is obtained by industry accepted test methods and represents typical data. Please work with a +/- 10% variation from any of the aforementioned specs. Nothing contained herein is to be construed as permission or recommendation to infringe any patent. It is furnished for your general information only and does not represent a warranty or guarantee of Wazoodle Fabrics.\n\nFabric Content: The components of the fabric. Note that variations in fiber blend percentages may occur within a +/-10% range.\n\nFabric Weight: The mass per unit area of the fabric, typically expressed in grams per square meter (gsm) or in ounces per square yard (osy). Expect a possible variation of +/-10% from the stated weight within the same sku from different lots as well as different colors within the same product style.\n\nFabric Thickness: The measured thickness of the fabric in millimeters or inches. As with other metrics, this can vary by +/-10%.\n\nFabric Shrinkage: Percentage of reduction in dimensions after washing and drying. Shrinkage can vary, so anticipate up to +/-10% difference from the data provided.\n\nFabric Stretch: The elasticity of the fabric and its ability to return to its original size after stretching. Please allow for a +/-10% variation in stretch capabilities.\n\nUPF Rating: Indicates the Ultraviolet Protection Factor offered by the fabric. Variations in protection levels can occur, and a +/-10% variation should be considered.\n\nWazoodle Fabrics makes no representations, collateral agreements, conditions or other warranties of any nature or kind, express or implied, with respect to such information or product and assumes no responsibility as to the accuracy or the suitability of the information or product for purchaser’s intended uses. The purchaser should conduct its own tests to determine the suitability of the material for their particular application.\n\nThe foregoing statements shall supersede the terms and conditions, whether express or implied, of any separate agreement of purchase and sale between Wazoodle and the purchaser.\n\nAbsorption in Fabrics\n\nWe strive to provide high-quality fabrics suitable for a diverse range of applications. It is important to note, however, that we do not perform absorption testing on our fabrics. The absorbency of any fabric can be significantly influenced by the design and construction of the final product in which it is used.\n\nKey Points:\n\nProduct Design Influence: The ultimate absorption capacity of a fabric in a finished product depends heavily on the product's specific design and construction. Variations in design can lead to significant differences in performance.\n\nRecommendation for Testing: We strongly recommend that customers conduct their own testing to determine the absorption characteristics of our fabrics in conjunction with their product designs. This testing should consider all elements of product design and the interaction between different materials.\n\nInteractions with Other Materials: The performance of our absorbent fabrics can be affected by the use of additional layers or materials. For instance:\n\nAdding a cotton top layer may enhance the overall absorption capability.\n\nIntegrating a moisture-wicking layer can facilitate rapid moisture dispersion, potentially reducing compression leaks and influencing perceived absorbency.\n\nVariability in Performance: Due to the myriad of factors that can influence the absorbency of a fabric within a specific product design—including material combinations, construction techniques, and external conditions—we cannot guarantee specific results without proper testing.\n\nCopyrights & Trademarks\n\nAKASTiq® is a registered trademark of AKAS Tex.\n\nDri-QWick™ is a registered trademark of AKAS Tex.\n\nECO-PUL™ is a registered trademark of AKAS Tex.\n\nProCare® is a registered trademark of AKAS Tex.\n\nProCool® is a registered trademark of AKAS Tex.\n\nProECO® is a registered trademark of AKAS Tex.\n\nProSoft® is a registered trademark of AKAS Tex.\n\nStretch-FIT™ is a registered trademark of AKAS Tex.\n\nTransWICK™ is a registered trademark of AKAS Tex.\n\nSILVADUR™ is a registered trademark of DuPont de Nemours, Inc.\n\nREPREVE® is a registered trademark of Unifi, Inc.\n\nCOOLMAX® is a registered trademark of The LYCRA Company.\n\nLycra is a registered trademark of The LYCRA Company.\n\nZorb® is a registered trademark of Wazoodle Fabrics.\n\nCan I use your brand information on my products?"
