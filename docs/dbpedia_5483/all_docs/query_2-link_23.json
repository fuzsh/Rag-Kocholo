Some have to be absolutely tamperproof and others have to resist extreme external influences, e.g. in the engine area.\n\nWe offer a comprehensive assortment of taper evident laser labels to fulfill all requirements, combining the knowledge of laser marking technologies with expertise in self-adhesive films.\n\nWith our laser labels we combine a high-performance adhesive with a data carrier that is destroyed upon tampering. These tamper proof car labels comply with the legal (NHTSA, EEC, GB) and manufacturer-specific regulations of the automotive industry."
