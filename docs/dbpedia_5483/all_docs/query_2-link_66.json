        "text": "( UPDATE: some of you sent questions about colored image transfers, or why their previous projects were cloudy or not sticking. I have 5 super helpful tips for you at the end!!)\n\nQuiz: what can you use packing tape for, besides packing?\n\nSo excited to share with you today a really cool image transfer technique on how to turn packing tape into great looking clear labels and stickers!\n\nJust think about all the ways you could use these beautiful stickers: pantry labels, gift tags, decorative touches on glass, wood or metal objects…\n\nUPDATE: we just created another variation of this project on how to make photo candles, plus a video tutorial!\n\nToday’s packing tape image transfer is a bit different. The images will be transferred onto the packing tape which can be used just like a clear sticker, with your own custom designs!\n\nAll the lovely vintage images used in this post are from the Graphics Fairy. Thank you Karen! ( Some of the helpful resources are affiliate links. Full disclosure here. )\n\nMaterials and tools:\n\nPacking tape. I tested different brands and the heavier duty ones gave much better results than thin tape. I used the Duck brand tape like these here.\n\ninkjet printer and standard office paper\n\nscissors\n\nNOTE: there are actually printable clear label sheets you can use to make labels. The purpose of this project is that packing tape is easier to find in many parts of the world, and it is just a quick way to make some fun stickers!\n\nStep 1:\n\nPrint images on paper. Take into consideration the width of the tape,\n\nI will show you a trick at the end on how to make larger labels!\n\nStep 2:\n\nTake a piece of tape, press the sticky side onto an image, center the packing tape over it evenly and press. Then cut out the section.\n\nHere’s a REALLY IMPORTANT part of the image transfer process: burnish the piece using the back of a spoon and make sure to cover all the printed areas. The more pressure you can apply to the tape and image the better result you will get!\n\nStep 3:\n\nDrop the piece into a bowl of room temp water. Let them soak for at least 5 minutes.\n\nI find it much easier to let them soak for an hour. Then the paper just peel of really easily, leaving you with a beautiful image on the packing tape!\n\nYou may also love this image transfer project that has become a reader favorite: here’s the tutorial on how to transfer images to wood and make vintage-inspired pallet crates.\n\nStep 4:\n\nUse these pieces just like a sticker.\n\nThese stickers not only look great on glass, but also on wood!\n\nSo what happens when you want a larger sticker, like the gorgeous grain sack label on the big jar above?\n\nI have tried overlapping the tape, and did not like how it looked.\n\nAs you can see, although each of the butterflies will fit on a piece of tape, the large grain sack label won’t.\n\nHere’s a trick to work around the limitations.\n\nCut the larger design into smaller pieces, apply tape on each piece. After you make the smaller labels, assemble them back together into the original design.\n\nDoesn’t this clear label ( or “these labels” ) look gorgeous on a jar of whole wheat flour? Can’t even tell it was pieced together!\n\nHere are a few tips to help you get the best results.\n\nI have mentioned some of them earlier, but it is worth mentioning again:\n\nI tested different brands of tape and the heavier duty ones gave much better results than thin tape, which can lose the stickiness and get cloudy . A reader also shared that the packing tape from post office loses stickiness. I used the Duck brand tape like these here.\n\nColor images will transfer using the same method. Magazines will transfer also! However, the magazine paper will cause the tape to lose the stickiness no matter which kind of tape you use!\n\nBurnish the piece using as much pressure as you can apply to the tape and image. You will get much better image transfer this way!\n\nImages with lots of contrasts, such pen and ink drawings will look better than images with subtle shades, such as the photo of a forest.\n\nSoaking the tape and paper longer, about one hour, will make it easier to peel, and the stickers will look cleaner.\n\nStore any extra stickers by sandwiching them between parchment paper or wax paper and they will stay sticky until you are ready to use them.\n\nRelated article: How to make beautiful no-bake Sharpie art bowls.\n\nMake gorgeous mason jar oil lanterns in 2 minutes!"
