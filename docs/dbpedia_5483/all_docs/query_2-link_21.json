Because we offer unlimited variations, you can chose a custom size, shape and color. Our silver and gold labels are most popular, but with our technology, we customize the color based on your needs. We can also add a special message on the scratch off area such as “scratch here” or “your prize awaits”. Our labels have a permanent, clear adhesive so the top layer can be scratched away showing through to what the label is covering.\n\nScratch off labels have many applications and are used to hide a specified portion of your promotion. As a result, the labels create an interactive way to engage with customers, stand apart from competition and drive sales.\n\nSecurity Scratch Off Labels\n\nLabels & Specialty Products also offers security scratch off labels to be applied to gift cards or membership cards. These labels are unique because of their scratch off and peel resistance. Due to our advanced technology, the label will not allow for removing and reapplying. This ensures the label is not tampered with so the code or pin remains protected. Security scratch off labels have many applications and can be customized to your needs."
