I couldn’t find help anywhere else !\n\nWhile I can’t argue with the recommendation to use Veeam if you’re fully virtualized, tapes are still a valid method of backing up…\n\nOnce the tapes are in the Scratch Media pool, if you set the job in BE to run as \" Append to media, Overwrite if no appendable media is found\" instead of “Append to media. Terminate if no appendable media is found”, it should allow you to use the scratch media pool. By design, Symantec didn’t make scratch media appendable.\n\nIt sounds like you could benefit from our Virtual Tape Library. You could either do disk-to-disk or disk-to-disk-to-tape. This would greatly reduce your backup window by increasing the speed of your backups. Disk will be much faster than tape and also allow for you to off-load the backups to another device; if you are to choose the disk-to-disk-to-tape architecture.\n\nYou can find out more info here, but let me know if you have any questions: Virtual Tape Library (VTL) from StarWind"
