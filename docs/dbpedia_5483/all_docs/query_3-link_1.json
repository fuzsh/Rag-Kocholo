I have set the slot to be a Cleaning Slot, but it still looks like it is treating the tape like a normal LTO5 tape.\n\nI'm thinking my issue is due to the labels.\n\nThey have the following number sequence: C00001L5 to C00020L5\n\nI asked for Cleaning tape labels, so maybe these are not the correct ones?\n\nTrying to look into this, I found that it might be because there is no rule set up for the Label code specified above.\n\nI tried to add a rule, and entered:\n\nNew-BEBarCodeRule -mediatype \"CLN\" -barcodeprefix \"C\"\n\nbut it didn't seem to work. I have run both a Scan and Inventory on the Slot itself and the Library.\n\nAny ideas?\n\nAre there more commands I need to run to get the rule to be enabled?\n\nDo I have to restart the services?"
