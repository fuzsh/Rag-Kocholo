Fred,

Unlike the MVS/Catalog were CA-1 will un-catalog the file as it goes

scratch, with HSM CA-1 will NOT tell HSM that a tape has gone scratch and

should be removed from the CDS; it is the other direction. HSM notifies CA-1

when a tape can be released and put back into the scratch pool. Since HSM

believes these tapes are scratch, then HSM notified CA-1 and CA-1 scratched

the tapes. It sounds like something was changed within HSM so that it

believed it only needed a smaller number of duplex tapes and released the

extra's.

Subject: How to identify what is on a duplexed HSM migration tape marked

as Scratch

Hi fellow listers,

We have suddenly seen a large number of tapes appear on our daily scratch

volume list. We are a bit nervous about releasing them for scratch, since

they are HSM migration tape duplex copies and we don't see the original

tape of the duplex pair in this list. We expected that both tapes of a

duplex pair would be marked scratch at the same time.

We would like to identify some datasets on these tapes and check that they

really do no longer exist as catalog entries with VOLSER of MIGRAT* on the

system.

Unfortunately, as far as HSM is concerned, the tapes are now marked as

scratch. This means we cannot do a LIST TTOC for these volumes in the OCDS

to see what datasets are on the tape. We also cannot identify what the

VOLSER is of the other volume in the duplex pair.

Tape utilities to list the tape's contents seem to be a waste of time, as

there is only one dsname on the tape, ie HSM.COPY.HMIGTAPE.DATASET and the

actual data is in a compressed form.

We ran a HSM audit to see if that gave us a warm fuzzy feeling. We saw

lots of "FIX ATTEMPT - BAD TTOC SUCCESSFUL", but no VOLSER's were

mentioned in the output. This also makes us nervous.

Some manual changes to CA1's OUTCODE for various tapes were made prior to

the increase in the scratch tape list. But we are not sure if this is

related to the problem.

HSM gurus.... help! Please.

Fred,

Skimming over your post, the idea that the machines had taken over and that

the humans were no longer the predominant intelligence on the planet came to

mind. There's an air of "We know best, just do as we say" about this.

Then I peeked at your address, "Northern Territory Government". That'll be

the city of Darwin I expect. How appropriate that the place where this

evolutionary step first (perhaps I shouldn't be so sure about that) happened

should be named after the person who is normally acknowledged as the person

who first proposed the relevant theory.

However, whenever the matter of the birth of the theory of evolution comes

up, it should be noted that, some way to the north and west of the city of

Darwin, there is an imaginary line on the surface of the seas separating the

islands of the Malay Archipelago, now Indonesia, called "Wallace's Line"[1].

It is named after Alfred Russel Wallace who eked out an existence among the

islands acquiring exotic specimens for wealthy collectors. In doing so his

inquiring mind also came up with the famous theory and, knowing Darwin, he

sent him a summary, asking him whether he thought the idea was worth

publishing. Darwin was now forced both to finish his leisurely writing on

the same topic and acknowledge Wallace as a co-author in a paper to the

Linnean Society.

By rights, the famous theory should be named after both Darwin and Wallace.
