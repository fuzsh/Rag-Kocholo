Hi all,

I have purchased some new Cleaning tapes, and some labels for them.

The problem is that Backup Exec 2012 detects the tape ok, but assigns it to the "Scratch Media"

media set. I have set the slot to be a Cleaning Slot, but it still looks like it is treating the tape like a normal LTO5 tape.

I'm thinking my issue is due to the labels.

They have the following number sequence: C00001L5 to C00020L5

I asked for Cleaning tape labels, so maybe these are not the correct ones?

Trying to look into this, I found that it might be because there is no rule set up for the Label code specified above.

I tried to add a rule, and entered:

New-BEBarCodeRule -mediatype "CLN" -barcodeprefix "C"

but it didn't seem to work. I have run both a Scan and Inventory on the Slot itself and the Library.

Any ideas?

Are there more commands I need to run to get the rule to be enabled?

Do I have to restart the services?
