As a storage administrator, you know how many tapes the daily cycle uses. You regularly verify that enough scratch tapes are available in your scratch tape pool to meet your site requirements. In this context, the term scratch tape refers to a tape that has scratch status, and it is available for applications to write data on. Scratch tape pool refers to a library of scratch tapes.

Some applications are set up to send data to tape. Tape management systems typically do not allow applications to write data at the beginning of the tape unless the tape has scratch status. If a tape has scratch status, any data it contains can be over-written.

An insufficient number of scratch tapes for the daily processing cycle can prevent your applications from completing on time. For sites with a heavy dependence on tape, insufficient tape can be a critical problem.

This scenario shows how a storage administrator identifies existing scratch tapes and then adds additional scratch tapes if not enough scratch tapes are available.

The following illustration shows how a storage administrator identifies existing scratch tapes and then adds additional scratch tapes.

To manage scratch tape availability and status, do the following:
