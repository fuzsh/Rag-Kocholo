The Wizards have signed Shaun Livingston to a contract, the team announced today in a press release. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed, but I would guess it's a one-year deal, likely not fully guaranteed. According to team president Ernie Grunfeld, Livingston's "size and playmaking ability will give [the Wizards] more flexibility in the backcourt."

It's not the first time the Wizards have signed Livingston as a free agent. During the 2009/10 campaign, Washington inked the 6'7" guard to a pair of 10-day contracts before signing him for the rest of the season. Livingston's PER with the Wizards over the course of 26 games was 14.4 PER, which would have been a career high over a full season.

The Wizards, off to an 0-7 start, have struggled to get solid production from the point guard position with John Wall sidelined. A.J. Price has assumed the role of starting point guard, and has averaged 10.1 PPG and 6.9 APG, but has only shot 32.9% from the floor. Backup Jannero Pargo, who was released by the Wizards to make room for Livingston, was having even more trouble from the field, shooting 25.0%.

Pargo's contract was believed to be partially guaranteed for $300K, so that amount will count against the Wizards' cap this season.
