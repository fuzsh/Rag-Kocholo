The Washington Wizards are the NBA’s last winless team, but that doesn’t tell the whole story. They are without John Wall and Nene, probably their two best players, so they may be better than their 0-7 record indicates. It has gotten to the point where they require the services of Shaun Livingston.

Washington Wizards President Ernie Grunfeld announced today that the team has signed free agent guard Shaun Livingston. Per team policy, terms of the deal were not released. ‘We are obviously familiar with what Shaun brings both on and off the court based on his previous time here and we’re confident that he will be a positive addition to our team,’ said Grunfeld.
