Please include your name, mailing address, and phone number along with the copy and photo.\n\nWe also need a copy of the death certificate or name and number of the funeral home to verify death.\n\nWarriors guard Shaun Livingston will miss his fourth game this season after being declared out of Monday night’s game in Chicago with a sore right foot.\n\nThe 33-year-old backup point guard also sat out Golden State’s victory in Brooklyn Sunday with a sore foot. He’s also missed two other games with a bruised left knee and after Monday will have missed half of the Warriors’ eight games.\n\nHowever, no one’s worried about Livingston’s ailments as the team is again taking a long-term view on the health of their veterans.\n\n“We need to have him ready for the long haul so night’s like this if he’s banged up, we’ll rest him,” Kerr said a week ago when Livingston sat with a bruised knee.\n\nLivingston played nine minutes and went scoreless on Friday against the Knicks in New York. He’s averaging 5.5 points per game and 3.5 rebounds per game this season.\n\nMeanwhile, the Warriors are listing forward Andre Iguodala probable Monday night with left calf tightness.\n\nOriginally Published: October 29, 2018 at 11:14 a.m."
