        "text": "WashingtonWizards.com reporter Casey Phillips scored the first interview with new point guard Shaun Livingston after the team decided to re-sign him and release Jannero Pargo earlier Thursday. In the interview, Livingston said that his main job will be to help the team get into their offensive sets.\n\n\"I think that communication can sometimes get lost in the speed of the game, so it's kind of coming out here and helping guys up to speed, and also getting myself up to speed.\"\n\nLivingston added that his familiarity with the coaching staff from his last time in D.C. in 2010 will help his transition to this new team go easier.\n\n\"Especially me being at the point guard, where I have been playing, [you have to be] an extension of the coach. So me being familiar with the coaching staff, it kind of helps implement the plays and the system to the guys a little more. It's a smoother transition.\"\n\nYou can watch the full video here."
