        "text": "OAKLAND — Even as the Warriors fret about a start that does not match their championship standard, they are fully aware that life involves more than just basketball.\n\nHere’s the latest of many examples: the Warriors granted permission to reserve guard Shaun Livingston to miss Friday’s game against the Washington Wizards at the Oracle so he can attend the funeral of Mavericks guard Devin Harris’ brother. Harris’ brother was killed in a car accident last week.\n\nThe Warriors had offered support for the Harris family earlier this week. Livingston, who is close friends with Harris, arranged for teammate Stephen Curry to speak with Harris’ nephew, Brayden, before Monday’s win in Dallas as well as sign autographs for him. Livingston plans to return to the Bay Area this weekend, and is expected to be available for Sunday’s game against Detroit at the Oracle.\n\nWith Livingston’s absence and Damian Jones remaining on a G-League assignment, it is possible the Warriors will lean on Quinn Cook, who is on a two-way contract that allows the Warriors to keep him for up to 45 days in combined practices and game appearances.\n\nThe Warriors will also be without one of their distinguished luminaries for Friday’s game. Though they plan to honor former Warriors player Al Attles, he is expected to stay in the hospital for unspecified reasons. While Attles plans to attend on his behalf, Warriors coach Steve Kerr plans to wear a retro suit that Attles wore as Golden State’s head coach (1970-83).\n\nLending support\n\nThe Warriors might have everything you can ask for with their ownership, coaching, players and culture. But that depth also makes reserves vulnerable to sit because of a dreaded coaching decision.\n\nWarriors guard/forward Nick Young and center JaVale McGee mark the latest examples Young sat in Wednesday’s game as Kerr’s quest to find a definitive backup shooting guard has involved Young and Patrick McCaw switching in appearances. McGee was a healthy scratch for the first time this season for matchup purposes. Kerr wanted to make forward Kevon Looney active to defend Toronto’s smaller lineup, though he also sat amid a competitive game.\n\n“That’s part of being on this team and part of the sacrifice you have to make to be a part of our group,” Kerr said. “We play a lot of people and you can’t play everybody every night. Certain nights it’s not your night. But last night was a tough night for Javale and Nick.”\n\nKerr said Young and McGee will play in Friday’s game against Washington, meaning other players such as McCaw and Looney might experience a “DNP” as well. All things considered, Kerr liked how Young and McGee handled the healthy scratch. Kerr observed Young “always has a smile on his face” and thought he “was great” after talking to him on Thursday morning. As for McGee?\n\n“JaVale is a pro,” Kerr said on Wednesday night. “He wasn’t thrilled about it. I don’t expect him to be. He’s human. I explained my thinking.”\n\nKerr has done that with both his young players patiently waiting for opportunities and veterans suddenly facing a new role.\n\n“I talk to all our guys. I just try to figure out who needs a conversation each day,” Kerr said. “There are individual discussions every single day to sort through what’s happening in each players existence and how the season is playing out and check in.”"
