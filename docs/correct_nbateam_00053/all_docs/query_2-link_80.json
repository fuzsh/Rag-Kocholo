        "text": "Tributes poured in last week for former Golden State Warriors guard, Shaun Livingston, who hung up his sneakers after five years with the team. Livingston’s playing career history is well known, from his status as a top draft pick, to the devastating injury that threatened his career, to his resurgence with Golden State.\n\nFor everything else that came before, Livingston retires as a three-time champion who was integral to the functioning on and off the court of one of the most unstoppable teams in NBA history. Whether it was his calming veteran presence, or his well-honed basketball IQ on both ends of the floor, or his turnaround mid-range jump shot that never seemed to miss, the Warriors would not have achieved all their success without him.\n\nTributes flew in from all quarters\n\nUnsurprisingly tributes flew in from all quarters of the Warriors organization. General Manager Bob Myers called his career “one of the most inspirational in the history of professional sports”, saying, “what he accomplished after suffering so many trials and tribulations early in his career is a true testament to who he is as a person, which has always been characterized by tremendous class, grace, and professionalism.”\n\nSteph Curry posted his own tribute on instagram, saying “No words will describe my appreciation for this guy and what he means to me and the success of this franchise.” Klay Thompson commented “Cheat code!” on Livingston’s instagram retirement post, before congratulating him on his retirement.\n\nCoach Steve Kerr tweeted “It’s hard to express how thankful I am to have coached this man the past 5 years. What an amazing combination of talent, grace, & character”. Warriors President Rick Welts posted his own tribute, thanking Livingston for “being such an inspiration and example of a true professional on and off the court.”\n\nWhen the Warriors waived him earlier in the summer, Governor Joe Lacob had this to say about Livingston. “Shaun was a huge part of three NBA championship teams with the Warriors, but his overall journey is what is most remarkable. He overcame incredible odds following a devastating injury, wore nine different NBA uniforms during his comeback, had a stint in the D-League and, fittingly, ended up being a major contributor on one of the best teams in NBA history.\n\n\"Now, his resume indicates that he’s one of only a handful of players in league history to win at least three NBA championships. He has been a tremendous credit to the Warriors organization and our community for the last five years and has always carried himself as a professional. We thank Shaun for his immense contributions, wish him well in his next chapter and look forward to honoring him at some point in the future.”\n\nWhat’s next?\n\nAltogether it’s a mark of just how highly the Warriors’ backup point guard and veteran leader was held across the organization. But the comments also demonstrate how his former teammates, coaches, and front office colleagues see Livingston’s qualities and how that might play into the next phase of his career.\n\nLivingston’s ability to read the floor, directing plays and teammates, and his maintenance of the locker room in times of great stress have all the hallmarks of a great coach. On the other hand his knowledge of the game, understanding of how the league works from pretty much every angle a player could after his varied career, and his ability to build strong relationships could be of great use in a front office.\n\nClearly the Warriors have plans for Livingston somewhere within their organization. Only last month Kerr said “He’s somebody I’m hoping can be involved with our organization for many years to come. That would be the plan if we can pull it off, but he’s got to get away right now and get some freedom, enjoy his family before he figures out what’s next.”\n\nLast season the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Livingston had already talked with Myers about his post-playing career. Marc Stein of the New York Times reported earlier this summer of “rumblings” that the Warriors would offer Livingston a role somewhere in the organization.\n\nWhat might once have been dismissed as wishful thinking, possesses more intrigue after the Warriors promoted former player Mike Dunleavy to assistant GM and brought in Zaza Pachulia in a wide-ranging consultancy role that will allow him to learn the ropes of the business as he enters his post-playing career. This is an organization that values loyalty and seeks to support people who they know, respect, and trust.\n\nSo don’t be too surprised if, or perhaps when, a 6-foot-7 point guard phenom out of Peoria, Illinois rocks up to work at Chase Center in the not-too-distant future. This time though, he’ll have swapped those sneakers for a suit."
