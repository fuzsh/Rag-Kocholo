The Washington Wizards signed free agent guard Shaun Livingston on Thursday.

Per team policy, terms of the contract were not disclosed.

Livingston, a seven-year NBA veteran, appeared in 58 games last season with the Milwaukee Bucks, averaging 5.5 points, 2.1 assists and 2.1 rebounds per game.

He previously played in 26 games for the Wizards in 2009-10, posting 9.2 points per game.

"We are obviously familiar with what Shaun brings both on and off the court based on his previous time here and we're confident that he will be a positive addition to our team," Wizards president Ernie Grunfeld said. "His size and playmaking ability will give us more flexibility in the backcourt."

In addition to Washington and Milwaukee, Livingston has also had stints with Miami, Oklahoma City, the Los Angeles Clippers, and Charlotte.

He has career averages of 6.8 points, 3.5 assists and 2.6 rebounds per game.

To make room for Livingston, Washington waived Jannero Pargo.
