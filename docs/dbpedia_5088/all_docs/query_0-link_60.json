        "text": "One of the must have for your Skyrim board game collection. Especially if you are a collector of Skyrim series.\n\nGood Seller, fast shipping from UK to Canada! Definitely will shop with again.\n\nI bought 4 for my daughter as they are so much cheaper here than anywhere else else. They are all gorgeous. Hazel is beautiful and a great figurine to have. I'm very pleased with the site and the purchase\n\nNot the easiest record to source on vinyl but a real gem, received promptly, well packaged and in perfect condition.\n\nJustin Adams is one of the unsung heroes among UK guitarists and cross-cultural ambassadors, committed to working with great musicians across West Africa, the Maghreb and southern Europe. On this record he joins the remarkable Mauro Durante of Canzoniere Grecanico Salentino to showcase a UK/Puglia blend with a sharp political edge. The title track Still Moving bears witness to the trauma of refugees seeking shelter that few here can imagine and too few even care to think about.\n\nFull credit to Justin Adams, a wonderful musician with a true grasp of what solidarity means. His world view crosses musical borders and calls for a better future for all humanity."
