Adjusting to civilian life after the horrors of war is difficult, but his family just wants him to relax and have a little well-earned fun. Reluctantly, he agrees to take up the game of golf, to which he is hopelessly unsuited. Although it seems golf is just not his game, a mysterious caddy by the name of Bagger Vance turns up to give him some much-needed advice on how to thrive on the golf course. While his tips are helpful, the captain soon comes to realize that the advice he is giving is really intended to help him move on with his life."
