        "text": "From Academy Award-winning director Robert Redford comes a film that celebrates the power and potential of the human spirit. Will Smith, Matt Damon and Charlize Theron star in this highly acclaimed tale of a local hero with a promising future whose hopes are shattered on the battlefields of war. Once considered Savannah's greatest sportsman and favorite celebrity, Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon, Saving Private Ryan) had won the heart of the town's prettiest heiress, Adele Invergordon (Charlize Theron). But when he returned from war, he was a defeated man, giving up golf and Adele for the sake of alcohol.\n\nWhen Junuh is given a chance to redeem himself by competing in a celebrity golf tournament, he must first regain his swing and his self-respect. It will take a miracle, in this form of a mysterious caddy named Bagger Vance (Will Smith, Men in Black), for Junuh to get his game back as well as his life.\n\nThe film also stars Bruce McGill, Joel Gretsch (Minority Report), Lane Smith and Harve Presnell, and introduces J. Michael Moncrief.\n\nThe Legend of Bagger Vance is produced by Robert Redford, Michael Nozik and Jake Eberts. The screenplay is by Jeremy Leven, based on the novel by Steven Pressfield. Karen Tenkhoff is the executive producer, with Chris Brigham and Joseph Reidy serving as co-producers.\n\nThe Last Castle\n\nHis service to his country made him a hero. One mistake made him a prisoner. For General Eugene Irwin (Robert Redford), it's just a matter of serving out his sentenceâ€”until he makes the shocking discovery that his fellow inmates are being murdered.\n\nView\n\nAmerican Beauty\n\nLester Burnham's wife hates him, his daughter Jane regards him with contempt, and his boss is positioning him for the axe. Look closer as Lester decides to make a few changes in his life; the freer he gets, the happier he gets. But Lester is about to learn that the ultimate freedom comes at the ultimate price.\n\nView\n\nA Beautiful Mind\n\nThis winner of four Academy Awards including Best Picture, stars Russell Crowe as a brilliant mathematician on the brink of international acclaim who becomes entangled in a mysterious conspiracy.\n\nView"
