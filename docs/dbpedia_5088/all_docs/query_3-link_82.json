        "text": "I wrote for 17 years before I earned my first penny (a $3500 option on a screenplay that was never produced).\n\nI wrote for 27 years before I got my first novel published (The Legend of Bagger Vance).\n\nDuring that time I worked 21 different jobs in eleven states.\n\nI taught school, I drove tractor-trailers, I worked in advertising and as a screenwriter in Hollywood, I worked on offshore oil rigs, I picked fruit as a migrant worker ...\n\nCan you find me in this photo?\n\nFor one season I lived in this house. It had no power, no water, no doors, no windows. Rent was $15 a month ...\n\nAll during this time I was writing.\n\nWhy do I tell you this?\n\nBecause this site is about you learning from my mistakes\n\nIt’s about you avoiding the dead ends I drove myself into before I found myself as a writer.\n\nWHY AM I TELLING YOU THIS?\n\nBecause the “war of art” is not about genius, it’s about work.\n\nWe can’t control the level of talent we’ve been given. We have no control over the nature of our gift. What we can control is our self-motivation, our self-discipline, our self-validation, and our self-reinforcement.\n\nWe can control how hard and how smart we work.\n\nGates of Fire: 1M copies sold worldwide. Legend of Bagger Vance: 450K copies. Tides of War: 125K. The War of Art: 500K.\n\nTWO MANTRAS FOR YOUNG WRITERS\n\nFrom my (fictional) 96-year-old literary agent, Marty Fabrikant, as quoted in The Knowledge:\n\n1. Talent is bullsh*t\n\n\"I’ve seen a million writers with talent. It means nothing. You need guts, you need stick-to-it-iveness. It's work, you gotta work, do the freakin' work. That's why you're gonna make it, son. You work. No one can take that away from you.\"\n\n2. The work is everything\n\n\"And I'll tell you something else. Appreciate these days. These days when you're broke and struggling, they're the best days of your life. You're gonna break through, my boy, and when you do, you'll look back on this time and think this is when I was really an artist, when everything was pure and I had nothing but the dream and the work. Enjoy it now. Pay attention. These are the good days. Be grateful for them.\"\n\nBegin today\n\nStart with this War of Art [27-minute] mini-course.\n\nIt's free.\n\nThe course's five audio lessons will ground you in the principles and characteristics of the artist's inner battle.\n\nContinue each week (also free) with our \"Writing Wednesdays\" and \"What It Takes\" posts, each one like a new chapter in The War of Art. Plus continual videos, freebies, specials and new material throughout the year.\n\nDO THE WORK\n\nSteve shows you the predictable Resistance points that every writer hits in a work-in-progress and then shows you how to deal with each one of these sticking points. This book shows you how to keep going with your work.\n\nNOBODY WANTS TO READ YOUR SH*T\n\nSteve shares his \"lessons learned\" from the trenches of the five different writing careers—advertising, screenwriting, fiction, nonfiction, and self-help. This is tradecraft. An MFA in Writing in 197 pages.\n\nTHE AUTHENTIC SWING\n\nA short book about the writing of a first novel: for Steve, The Legend of Bagger Vance. Having failed with three earlier attempts at novels, here's how Steve finally succeeded.\n\nTHE WAR OF ART\n\nRead this one first.\n\nIt identifies the enemy—what I call Resistance with a capital “R,” i.e. fear, self-doubt, procrastination, perfectionism, all the forms of self-sabotage—that stop us from doing our work and realizing our dreams.\n\nStart here.\n\nEverything else proceeds from this.\n\nTURNING PRO\n\nAmateurs have amateur habits. Pros have pro habits. When we turn pro, we give up the comfortable life but we find our power. Steve answers the question, \"How do we overcome Resistance?\"\n\nFOLLOW THE LINKS BELOW FOR MORE GOODIES\n\nPatronu aradığında sürekli hasta olduğunu söyleyerek iş yerine yalan söylüyor porno hikaye Patronu artık bu kadarının gerçek olamayacağını ve rapor görmek istediğini dile getirip telefonu kapatıyor türbanlı Olgun kadın hemen bilgisayarının başına geçip özel bir doktor buluyor ve onu arayarak evine davet ediyor porno Muayene için eve gelen doktor olgun kadını muayene ediyor ve hiç bir sıkıntı olmadığını söylüyor brazzers porno Sarışın ablamız ise iş yerine rapor götürmesi gerektiğini bu yüzden rapor yazmasını istiyor brazzers porno fakat doktor bunun pek mümkün olmadığını dile getiriyor sex hikayeleri Daha sonra evli olan bu kahpe doktora iş atarak ona yavşıyor ve istediğini alana kadar durmuyor Porno İzle Karılarını takas etmek isteyen elemanlar hep birlikte evde buluşuyor türkçe porno Güzel vakit geçirdikten sonra kızlara isteklerini iletiyorlar ve hatunlarda kocalarının bu isteklerini kabul ediyorlar seks hikayeleri Hemen ellerine telefonları alan elemanlar karılarına video eşliğinde sakso çektiriyorlar porno izle Hiç beklemeden sikişe geçen elemanlar hatunları değiştire değiştire sikmeye başlıyorlar."
