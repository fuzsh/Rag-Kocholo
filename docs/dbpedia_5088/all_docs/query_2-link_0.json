        "text": "Succesful film with a sentimental story and intelligent character studio . Touching and sensitive portrait of an ex-golf winner who participates in the U. S. International Open in Savannah , Georgia, against two sports idols , the 2 greatest golfers of their time, Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen to play for $10,000 and being based on a true story . Classic story rings true because of Matt Damon's complex and adequate acting and stunningly realized by director Robert Redford. Exceptional Matt Damon and Will Smith displaying first-rate performances reaching an important milestone and a terrific Joel Grestch and Bruce McGill as their upright as well as serious contenders . As a tired War Vet named Rannulph Junuh : Matt Damon gets a chance to play against two biggest winners. As Rannunlph gets to achieve for big time , thanks to a caddy , as he triumphs over by odds , but sheer determination helps them attain their dream , playing the final Open , as he gets the chance to participate in the International Golf Championship , no matter how far-fetched the dream . Meanwhile , he falls in love for a wealthy young girl (Charlize Theron) who at the same time organizes the tournament. As he has an intelligent skill to no match for the class boundaries . Some Things Can't Be Learned. They Must Be Remembered. It Was Just A Moment Ago.\n\nA sympathetic and agreeable film about a down-and-out golfer well played by Matt Damon tries to recover his game and his life with help from a mystical caddy magnificently performed by Will Smith . An enjoyable tale based on the Savannah Championship in which took part three famous international champs played by Joel Gretsch , Bruce McGill and Matt Damon . It contains a classic plot about personal overcoming and deals with a slice of American history , and is plenty of good feeling , heartfelt , interesting characters and formidable performances . However , sometimes is some sentimental and predictable but is still pretty amusing . Likable and enjoyable plot about a disillusioned goll player who attempts to retrieve his old and authentic ¨Swing¨ and his companions a coach and caddie , both of them face the dual challenge to win a world championship and redeeming themselves . Splendid film from the filmmaker Robert Redford of another David beats Goliath sports movie , similarly to ¨Rudy¨ with Sean Astin and ¨Hoosiers¨ with Gene Hackman , and it is even better than ¨The Greatest Game Ever Played ¨ 2005 by Bill Paxton with Shia LaBeouf . Sentimental plot stretches Hollywood manipulation , but is still entertaining delivering an engaging acting as Matt Damon , Will Smith and the likeable little boy J. Michael Moncrief ; they are backed by a good supporting cast , such as : Bruce McGill , Joel Gretsch , Lane Smith , Carrie Preston , Harve Presnell , among others .\n\nSpectacular and rousing musical score by Rachel Portman , fitting perfectly to action . Fine production design and good sets , filmmakers had trouble filling the fields with extras for the final game, and needed to move people around when shooting different angles ; extras were given 1910's hairstyles and their clothing was checked for anachronisms . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Michael Ballhaus ; filmed on location in Jekyll Island , Georgia , Savannah , Georgia , Beaufort , Hilton Head , Kiawah Island, South Carolina, Bluffton, Charleston, South Carolina . The motion picture was compellingly directed by Robert Redford , he's a notorious producer/director and especially actor ; being this one his sixth film , the first one was the Oscarized Ordinary People , following : The Milagro Beanfield War , River runs through , The Horse Whisperer , Quiz Show , The Company You Keep , Conspiracy , Lions for Lambs , Cathedrals of Culture , among others . Rating : 7/10. Better than average , worthwhile seeing ."
