        "text": "- Sand traps and claptrap - that's Robert Redford's \"The Legend of Bagger Vance.\" Mixing golf and spirituality is problematic to begin with. They go together like, well, golf and spirituality. But Steven Pressfield's novel \"The Legend of Bagger Vance\" at least attempted to be a religious parable put in terms the average, golf-loving American could understand. It was based on Hinduism's Bhagavad Gita, in which the deity Krishna, in the guise of a charioteer, has discussions on the nature of God with a prince.\n\nRedford, who directed but does not star in the film, has said he wanted to avoid the novel's specific religious/spiritual dimension. But what that gives him is a \"Jonathan Livingston Seagull''-level story filled with quasi-mystical sentimental mush. It's for the birds. He tries to vary tones with a little bit of jazzy comedy here, a little romance there, but nothing really works.\n\nAnd the principal characters, forced in the bright light of the fairway to work not just as allegory but as viable, identifiable human beings, become ludicrous. Bagger (Will Smith) is a mysterious caddy who walks out of the dark with a battered hat and a suitcase, in the Savannah of 1931, to help a washedup, hard-drinking, ex-war hero golf star named Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) recover his swing. Rannulph has agreed to help ex-girlfriend Adele Invergordon try to save her Depression-threatened golf resort by appearing in an exhibition with two of the era's greatest (real-life) stars, Walter Hagen and Bobby Jones. (I don't mean to insult any Rannulphs out there, but what's with that name? )\n\nBagger, who wears layers of worn-out winter clothing despite the heat, is meant to be Rannulph's spiritual guide to redemption and recovery. But the screenplay by Jeremy Leven ( \"Don Juan DeMarco'') also has a more conventional purpose - we're supposed to get involved in this belabored golf match as if the outcome is suspenseful.\n\nWhen Bagger attempts to impart his wisdom in a serious way, you might want to grab an iron and go after somebody. \"That shot is a dragon you've got to slay,\" he says at one point. \"The blades of grass are going to follow the sun,\" he comments at another. When one of Rannulph's errant drives heads for a sand trap, Bagger says, \"Beach.\" (Why couldn't he have just said \"Sand?\" He's already mysterious - need he be verbally cryptic, too?)\n\nPlot perplexes\n\nYet Bagger also attempts to help Rannulph by hectoring and insulting him, encouraging him to hurry up and lose when he's not doing well. The purpose of this kind of reverse psychology seems at least as questionable as Redford's intentions in taking on this project in the first place. But Rannulph responds to Bagger's annoying repartee with a warm smile.\n\n\"Bagger Vance\" is sandbagged by the unbelievability of its two principal characters - as well as by a cloying third one, a young boy named Homer (J. Michael Moncrief) who believes in and befriends Bagger and Rannulph even while being ashamed of his own hardworking father. Actually, in a framing device that too many films since \"Saving Private Ryan\" use, Homer narrates the story as an old man having a heart attack on a golf course. Redford seems to think this ghastly plot device is cute. It isn't. (Jack Lemmon plays the elderly golfer.)\n\nSmith enjoys the chance to be a folksy, sage Southerner. He has a powerful glint in his eye and a compelling smile that make him entertaining throughout the ridiculous things Bagger must say. His dynamic personality isn't enough alone to sell this character, but he certainly does try.\n\nDamon, a fundamentally charismatic actor saddled with a fundamentally cliche√©d role, nevertheless stays in character and consistently acts as if Rannulph's search for his lost swing really matters. And when his initial success on the course results in a display of untoward vanity, Damon handles Rannulph's egotism very nicely.\n\nWhile Redford can't find the right tone for the movie, he nevertheless has firm control of the production values.\n\nFilmed in and near Savannah, this captures the town's lovely, permanently antebellum beauty better than Clint Eastwood's \"Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.\" And Judianna Makovsky's golfing costumes are darling.\n\nThere is outstanding cinematography by Michael Ballhaus ( \"Quiz Show,\" \"Primary Colors''), who occasionally gives us a whizzing golf ball-eye's view of the fairways. In one thrilling moment, the camera turns away in mid-drive and seems to fly off in a different direction all by itself. If nothing else, there's a golf-instruction video in Ballhaus' future. He also elegantly uses car headlights to light the darkened course.\n\nNow, here's the tale\n\nFrankly, I wish the film could have just dispensed with Bagger and Rannulph completely. It also could have dumped Adele who, other than giving Theron an attempt to show off her Marilyn Monroe-ish profile, provides little romantic spark for Damon.\n\n\"Bagger Vance\" in this regard is inferior to the roguishly funny \"Tin Cup,\" another shaggy-dog golf-match film that has teasing sexuality courtesy of Kevin Costner and Rene Russo.\n\nInstead, Redford should have focused on the far more interesting tale of golf pros Jones (Joel Gretsch) and Hagen (Bruce McGill) battling each other with different philosophies and lifestyles. In fact, there is an unforgetable, breakout performance by McGill, who was electrifying as an angry lawyer in \"The Insider.\"\n\nHis hedonistic Hagen is a Babe Ruthlike character, arrogantly superconfident about his talents and his vices, but also witty and highly intelligent. \"This is where a man needs pals in the mermaids' union,\" he says, after hitting the ball into water.\n\nIf the movie had been about these two (Gretsch also is very good as the sincere Jones), it would have been a thought-provoking, dramatically involving movie about golf. It would have made its subject interesting. Instead, it's been ruined with all this golf-aslife silliness. But in Hollywood, that's just par for the course."
