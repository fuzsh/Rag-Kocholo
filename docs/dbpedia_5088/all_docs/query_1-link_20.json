        "text": "A Century of Film\n\n20th Century-Fox\n\nThe Studio\n\nThe studio originally began as Fox. It began with William Fox and its start came in 1904. “Fox’s initiation into the movie business came in 1904 when he purchased from J. Stuart Blackton of the Vitagraph Company the Brooklyn nickelodeon (which, given the five-cent admission fee, was then the generic name for movie theaters). The location was 200 Broadway, and the price was $1,600. This was an inauspicious beginning, for, indeed, Fox had been swindled. Prior to the sale, Blackton hired customers to fill the 146-seat house. Once the deal was closed and Fox’s name appeared on the lease, the day’s admissions totaled two.” (The Fox That Got Away: The Last Days of the Zanuck Dynasty at Twentieth Century-Fox, Stephen M. Silverman, p 30)\n\nFox brought his own name into it in 1915 and he rose quickly: “No other major studio was regularly making these kinds of movies. During 1915, its first year of business, Fox Film took in $3.21 million, more than a tenfold increase over the $272,401 posted the previous year by the Box Office Attractions Company. Of that 1915 total revenue, profits totaled $523,000. The following year, gross revenues climbed to $4.24 million, with profits of $365,000. In less than two years the company had catapulted into the front ranks of American movie studios and had, according to the trade paper Wid’s Daily, established itself as ‘a concern whose films would, without question, bring money to the box office.’ It was the fastest arrival the motion picture industry had ever seen.” (The Man Who Made the Movies: The Meteoric Rise and Tragic Fall of William Fox, Vanda Krefft, p 157)\n\n“On February 1, 1915, William Fox formally incorporated the Fox Film Corporation in New York. The next year he bought the Selig Studio in Edendale (Selig had moved to east Lost Angeles), and in 1917 Fox opened his own studio on Sunset and Western Boulevards in Hollywood.” (Silverman, p 39) “[A] Fox discovery was one of the screen’s first sex symbols, Theodosia Goodman, the daughter of a Cincinnati tailor, hired in January, 1916, for $75 a week. She was thrown into erotic dress and re-christened Theda Bara.” (Silverman, p 40)\n\n“During Fox Film’s first two years, Fox had made movies that primarily reflected the world as he knew it: a harsh environment full of melodramatic passions and events. Now, in relative prosperity, he began to make movies that mirrored the world as he thought it ought to be. Stories acquired a dimension of social consciousness and commented more explicitly on timely issues.” (Krefft, p 217) But then, after a few years of going strong, the studio was rocked. “In the summer of 1919, Fox Film sustained the biggest jolt of its history so far. Theda Bara quit. … Although Theda had recently lost some of her drawing power, she was still Fox Film’s biggest star and the most visible driving force behind its success. Her movies had put the studio on the map, defined its brash, modern identity, and helped finance whirlwind expansion. To many, she was the face of Fox Film. Fox had no one lined up to take her place.” (Krefft, p 269-270)\n\n“Fox’s anxious penny-pinching paid off. By late 1923, Fox Film had built up sufficient reserves to take another run at making an expensive, important movie. The national economy was beginning to rally, and Fox understood that if he made a truly great movie, even theaters allied with rival studios would want to book it in order to share in the profits. The project he chose was The Iron Horse, an epic about the building on the transcontinental railroad in the 1860s.” (Krefft, p 341)\n\n“The Warners’ Vitaphone proved unreliable. Sound and picture frequently fell out of sync. William Fox picked up the slack with his Movietone sound-on-film system (popularized by his western hit, In Old Arizona (1929), which was also the first talkie to contain scenes filmed outdoors). That became the industry standard.” (Silverman, p 54)\n\nIn 1927, Fox would buy controlling stock in MGM but Louis B. Mayer went to Hoover after he was elected and eventually Fox was forced by the government to divest his shares. It was part of Fox’s expansion as “following his March 1927 purchase of New York’s Roxy Theatre, he made two other major acquisitions that transformed the company into one of the nation’s largest exhibition circuits.” (Krefft, p 463) In fact, it would be those theaters that would make the studio so enticing to Darryl F. Zanuck when he later bring forward the merger that would make the current company. But the fallout from all of that would be Fox’s ouster from the company that bore his name in 1930.\n\n“Fortunately for Fox, the first presentation of the Academy Awards took place on May 16, 1929, and honored films released in 1927 and 1928, by far the studio’s two strongest years.” (Krefft, p 456) While people remember Wings as the Picture winner, it was Fox’s Sunrise that won Best Production and the studio won five Oscars overall, including Director and Actress.\n\nBut Fox was falling behind the other studios, without major stars, without a visionary head and its theaters were the main thing it had to offer when the eventual merger that would save the company came along.\n\n“Each party needed something the other had to offer. Would a Fox union with Twentieth Century be a merger or a takeover? … They agreed to a merger. Schenck would resign from United Artists and becomes chairman of the board, and Sidney Kent president, of what would be called Twentieth Century-Fox. As usual, Zanuck got the top billing. Zanuck would be vice president of Twentieth Century.” (Twentieth Century’s Fox: Darryl F. Zanuck and the Culture of Hollywood, George F. Custen, p 194)\n\nThe logo would carry over from Twentieth Century and would incorporate Fox into the bottom of it. For a full history of the logo, please go here, which is also where I got the image at the top.\n\n“By 1935, the producer’s place within the studio system had been altered by the trend toward decentralization of his power. Every studio with the exception of Warner Brothers had dispensed with a mode of production organized around a single supreme production authority. But at Twentieth Century-Fox, with Schenck’s backing, Zanuck put in practice what Thalberg had briefly attained and what Selznick had yearned for: a studio with a virtually autonomous production head.” (Custen, p 196)\n\n“Darryl Zanuck’s 20th Century-Fox was no place for an Auteur. Movies were made on what amounted to an assembly line: writers wrote, directors directed, actors acted, cutters cut and Zanuck himself supervised every detail on each stage of production. At Twentieth, the script was the star. It had to be, for Zanuck was star-poor. … Zanuck wisely decided to build up from the script, rather than down from the star. With good scripts, he could borrow stars from other studios and meanwhile develop his own stable of personalities.” (Take Two: A Life in Movies and Politics, Philip Dunne, p 44)\n\n“His major inherited assets at Fox were Shirley Temple and Will Rogers, and he had big plans for both. But soon after Zanuck assumed power and before he could use him in a picture, Rogers was killed in a plane crash, which left Zanuck with only half of Fox’s assets – and Shirley Temple unfortunately had to grow up. Fox’s legacy to Zanuck, then, was an aging Shirley, Janet Gaynor, Warner Oland, who played Charlie Chan, and Warner Baxter, who played practically everything else.” (Don’t Say Yes Until I Finish Talking: A Biography of Darryl F. Zanuck, Mel Gussow, p 68)\n\n“To add to this roster of players Zanuck brought with him from Twentieth Century some of his loyal stars, including Loretta Young and Fredric March, and he also retained for the future a player who was under a nonexclusive contract to Fox Films. Zanuck was impressed neither by his personality nor his price, but decided to hang on to him just in case. Which was how he came to have Henry Fonda available when he was needed.” (Zanuck: The Rise and Fall of Hollywood’s Last Tycoon, Leonard Mosley, p 155) Later, Zanuck would use Fonda’s desire to play Tom Joad to lock him down: “He signed a seven-year contract with 20th Century-Fox, albeit reluctantly. And he was given the part of Tom Joad in The Grapes of Wrath, and played himself into movie history. He inveighed against the contract later, because he maintained no other role Zanuck gave him stood up to Tom Joad.” (Mosley, p 191)\n\nOne of the things that isn’t often written much about is the disaster that befell Fox, possibly the worst disaster ever for those who love old films: “On Sunday, July 9, 1937, around 3:00 a.m., a series of explosions shook the Little Ferry, New Jersey, warehouse to which Twentieth Century-Fox had banished all its prints and negatives of William Fox-era movies. … The entire archive was obliterated. Gone forever were the only known copies of most of the films Fox had produced.” (Krefft, p 721-722)\n\n“Sydney Kent, president of the entire corporation, died in March 1942. From the very inception of Twentieth Century-Fox, he had total faith in Zanuck’s tastes, and when he died some of Zanuck’s leverage also departed. Kent was succeeded by Spyros Skouras, head of Fox’s theaters. While Zanuck learned to negotiate a working relationship with Skouras (who was headquartered in New York), the two men neither liked nor understood each other.” (Custen, p 270)\n\n“There were no combination producer-directors on the Fox lot until Ernst Lubitsch arrived in early 1943. Otto Preminger was next, and Preston Sturges signed in 1947. But these were experiments. Later, when Hawks came to Fox to do some films in the late 1940s, Zanuck always had a Fox producer (Sol C. Siegel) assigned to his films”. (Memo from Darryl F. Zanuck: The Golden Years at Twentieth-Century Fox, ed. Rudy Behlmer, p 58)\n\n“From the early days at Warners, Zanuck has let many of the big ones get away, and they have become stars in spite of Zanuck. In the early forties, his daughter Darrylin wanted him to discover one of her playmates, a beautiful raven-haired, violet-eyed English girl but Zanuck said, ‘You and your friends!’ and let Elizabeth Taylor go to MGM. He fired Rita Hayworth and later Marilyn Monroe.” (Gussow, p 166)\n\n“Fox’s profits were impressive in the immediate post-World War II period, continuing and even accelerating the wartime trend. In 1946 the studio earned a profit of $22.6 million, by far the largest figure in the young company’s history, and in 1947 profits were a still-robust $14 million.” (Twentieth Century-Fox: The Zanuck-Skouras Years, 1935-1965, Peter Lev, p 102)\n\n“His films from 1948 to 1952 included some good but non-controversially successful program movies like Call Northside 777 with James Stewart, Unfaithfully Yours with Rex Harrison, The Gunfighter with Gregory Peck, All About Eve with Bette Davis and Anne Baxter, David and Bathsheba with Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward, Mister 880 with Edmund Gwenn, Five Fingers with James Mason, The Snows of Kilimanjaro with Ava Gardner, Susan Hayward and Peck, and People Will Talk with Cary Grant. But in that same period came such joltingly challenging movies as The Snake Pit with Olivia de Havilland (which subsequently changed U.S. medical practices for treating the mentally unbalanced), Twelve O’clock High (which dared to criticize the orthodox viewpoint on war and heroism), Pinky, Viva Zapata! with Marlon Brando (which did what Zanuck as a good Republican said he would never do, and that was take the viewpoint of the rebel leader against the government), and an even more uncompromising view of American attitudes towards it black and white subjects in No Way Out, with Sidney Poitier and Richard Widmark. They were big, they were bold and, on a falling market, they made money. So it was not surprising that in 1950 Time magazine put Zanuck on its cover and hailed him as one of the greatest movie-makers of his time.” (Mosley, p 241)\n\n“A verity of evidence suggest that Darryl Zanuck was a reluctant participant in the Hollywood Blacklist, which began with the Waldorf Declaration. Zanuck did not attend the meetings at the Waldorf Astoria, but Fox was represented by Spyros Skouras and Joseph Schenck. Schenck, in particular, was strongly committed to the blacklist. Zanuck gave Ring Lardner Jr. a new screenplay assignment on 12 November 1947, after Lardner had testified before HUAC.” (Lev, p 110)\n\n“In mid-1951, Fox’ plan for the ‘divorce’ between production and exhibition sides of the business was approved in court with a deadline of two years for implementation.” (Lev, p 162) That was the end of the real distinction between the major studios and the minor ones as the majors would no longer have their own theaters to distribute films to. But other things were also changing. “In the ‘Old Hollywood’ of the 1930s and 1940s the loss of stars under long-term contracts would have been disastrous, but in the ‘New Hollywood’ of the 1950s one could make single or even multiple picture deals with absolutely first-rank acting talent. Following this trend, Fox signed Cary Grant, Marlon Brando, John Wayne, Lauren Bacall, Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Clark Gable to appear in one or more films.” (Lev, p 166)\n\nFox’s CinemaScope was a huge success when it came out in 1953. “By early November every major studio in Los Angeles was licensed by Fox to make CinemaScope pictures – with the exception of Paramount.” (Behlmer, p 238) Finally, though, in 1956, Zanuck left the studio to become an independent producer of films and things did not go well over the next several years.\n\n“In 1962, Fox lost $39.8 million after taxes, and in the three preceding years the company had lost an additional $48.5 million in feature film production. To keep itself going, the Studio had sold 260 of it 334 acres just outside Beverly Hills to the Aluminum Company of America for $43 million. In Rome, production had started on Cleopatra, which began to sop up money faster than Fox could pour it in. The Studio was dying. Bankruptcy threatened, the sound stages were closed, the parking lots were empty. Spyros Skouras was fired as president, and Darryl Zanuck, after first threatening a proxy fight, was elected to take his place and save the sinking skip.” (The Studio, John Gregory Dunne, 1968)\n\nTo get an idea of what the state of Fox was in 1967, I would have to quote the entirety of John Gregory Dunne’s The Studio. He was allowed complete access to the lot for a year and the book he wrote is one of the most masterful narrative books about film ever written.\n\n“[There was] a $161.3 million loss on features produced between 1963 and 1970, greater than either the $145 million profit on The Sound of Music or the $61.4 million made when Fox licensed its pre-1963 features to television.” (Silverman, p 266) If not for those two things, Fox would have gone under.\n\nThings get tricky in these years. There have been several books written about the period just after this, when Dick Zanuck would get ousted from the studio (by his own father) and then the elder Zanuck would also step down. In fact, for all of the studio’s history up through 1985, the best summation is the first 10 pages of The Films of 20th Century-Fox.\n\nIn the seventies, Fox did okay with two huge disaster films (The Poseidon Adventure, The Towering Inferno), then Alan Ladd, Jr. took over and he took a gamble on George Lucas and his new Sci-Fi film and Star Wars became the biggest film of all-time and set up a lucrative franchise at the studio (though, they had unwisely given Lucas all the merchandising rights). In the mid-80’s, though, two key events happened that really changed the studio, first with its purchase by Rupert Murdoch and second, the development of the fourth major network on television.\n\nBefore it expanded into “news”, Fox developed its own shows for television, but it also gave the studio a network on which their own movies could play to gain more exposure. The studio would move decently along, with any major smashes for several years (after Return of the Jedi left theaters, it would be five more years before Fox had either a $100 million film or a Top 5 for the year film, both of which came with Big in 1988). But in the 90’s, it came roaring back, first with Home Alone (the #1 film of the year and one of the biggest hits of all-time) then a string of other successes (the second Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Independence Day) before Star Wars came back to help the studio regain its status, first with the Special Edition releases then with the prequels. It would do okay in the 2000’s, never slipping too low but also rarely getting above 4th place among the major studios at the box office, though it would finish the decade strongly with Avatar, the biggest domestic film of all-time to-date.\n\nIn the late 90s also came the arrival of Fox’s in-house independent arthouse studio with Fox Searchlight. It wouldn’t, for the most part, be a big business boost (only three films grossing over $85 million) but it would reap the awards. Since its inception, while the main studio has earned 387 nominations and just over 100 wins at the various awards, Fox Searchlight has earned 524 nominations and 200 wins including a Best Picture win for Slumdog Millionaire.\n\nNote: For all things below, I have included Fox Searchlight, including statistics. I often, especially in the awards, mention when films are Searchlight films.\n\nNotable Fox Films\n\nnote: These are Fox notables. Unless stated otherwise, assume it’s the first Fox film to do whatever is listed, not the first ever.\n\nGertie the Dinosaur – first Fox film (1914)\n\nSunrise: A Song of Two Humans – first Oscar winner for Best Picture (1927)\n\nIn Old Arizona – first all-talking film (1929)\n\nStand Up and Cheer! – first Fox film with Shirley Temple (1934)\n\nDante’s Inferno – first 20th Century-Fox release (1935)\n\nIn Old Kentucky – last Will Rogers film; released posthumously (1935)\n\nRamona – first all-Technicolor feature film (1936)\n\nAll About Eve – nominated for an all-time record 14 Oscar nominations (1950)\n\nInferno – first 3D film (1953)\n\nThe Robe – first film released in CinemaScope (1953)\n\nThe Abominable Snowman – first Hammer film released through Fox (1957)\n\nThe Sound of Music – first film to gross over $100 million; second highest grossing film all-time to-date (1965)\n\nThe French Connection – the last Fox film to win Best Picture to-date (1971)\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope – highest grossing film of all-time to-date; first film to gross over $300 million (1977)\n\nStar Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back – highest grossing sequel to-date; third film ever and first sequel to gross over $200 million (1980)\n\nStar Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi – highest grossing sequel to-date (1983)\n\nHome Alone – third highest grossing film of all-time to-date giving Fox three of the four highest grossing films from April, 1991 to August, 1993 (1990)\n\nThe Brothers McMullen – the first film from Fox Searchlight (1995)\n\nThe Full Monty – the first Fox Searchlight film nominated for Best Picture (1997)\n\nStar Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace – first sequel to gross over $400 million, third highest grossing film of all-time to-date giving Fox six of the 11 highest grossing films of all-time (1999)\n\nJuno – first Fox Searchlight film to gross over $100 million (2007)\n\nSlumdog Millionaire – first Fox Searchlight film to win Best Picture; highest grossing Fox Searchlight film (2008)\n\nAvatar – highest grossing film of all-time; first film to gross over $700 million (2009)\n\nThe Directors\n\nRaoul Walsh\n\nFilms: 13\n\nYears: 1915 – 1960\n\nAverage Film: 58.9\n\nBest Film: The Red Dance\n\nWorst Film: The Revolt of Mamie Stover\n\nWalsh had two different runs at Fox, one at the original Fox up through 1935 and then returning 20 years later in the twilight of his career for some weak final films. In between, he did his best work at Warners.\n\nFrank Borzage\n\nFilms: 11\n\nYears: 1925 – 1932\n\nAverage Film: 71.6\n\nBest Film: 7th Heaven\n\nWorst Film: Young America\n\nWinner of Best Director at the Oscars twice while at Fox, Borzage was often teamed with Janet Gaynor and the films they made together were some of the brightest spots at Fox during the years before the merger.\n\nJohn Ford\n\nFilms: 31\n\nYears: 1920 – 1952\n\nAverage Film: 69.6\n\nBest Film: The Grapes of Wrath\n\nWorst Film: Tobacco Road\n\nThe best and longest lasting of the Fox directors and the only one aside from Borzage to win Best Director twice at the studio and one of only three directors (and the first) in the Zanuck era to have a film win Picture and Director (How Green Was My Valley). What he didn’t do at Fox, though, were Westerns, with just three among his 31 films.\n\nIrving Cummings\n\nFilms: 22\n\nYears: 1928 – 1946\n\nAverage Film: 57.9\n\nBest Film: Down Argentine Way\n\nWorst Film: Behind That Curtain\n\nCummings was a relentlessly mediocre director but he was a major director at Fox for a long time, even earning an Oscar nomination in 1929 for In Old Arizona.\n\nHenry King\n\nFilms: 36\n\nYears: 1933 – 1962\n\nAverage Film: 61.4\n\nBest Film: Call Northside 777\n\nWorst Film: Prince Valiant\n\nHe directed 16 films at Fox that earned Oscar noms including seven that were nominated for Best Picture (even though he was nominated for Best Director just twice). In back-to-back years he directed The Song of Bernadette and Wilson which combined for 22 Oscar nominations and 9 Oscars.\n\nNorman Foster\n\nFilms: 10\n\nYears: 1937 – 1940\n\nAverage Film: 61.9\n\nBest Film: Think Fast, Mr. Moto\n\nWorst Film: Charlie Chan at Treasure Island\n\nNot particular good but he worked fast and cheap, directing series films at Fox. Of the 10 films I have seen by him at the studio, six were Moto films, three were Chan films and the last was a Cisco Kid film.\n\nH. Bruce Humberstone\n\nFilms: 14\n\nYears: 1936 – 1962\n\nAverage Film: 60.1\n\nBest Film: To the Shores of Tripoli\n\nWorst Film: Madison Avenue\n\nLike Foster, he began with series, doing four Chan films and a Cisco Kid film but then he graduated to bigger things branching out into all the genres.\n\nWalter Lang\n\nFilms: 34\n\nYears: 1937 – 1961\n\nAverage Film: 62.0\n\nBest Film: The King and I\n\nWorst Film: Song of the Islands\n\nThough he directed 13 Oscar nominated films at the studio, the only big one was at least by far his best film: The King and I.\n\nOtto Preminger\n\nFilms: 15\n\nYears: 1937 – 1954\n\nAverage Film: 63.3\n\nBest Film: Laura\n\nWorst Film: Whirlpool\n\nA producer at Fox for years, Preminger was finally allowed by Zanuck to direct and Laura proved he belonged there (earning him an Oscar nom) even if he never again reached those heights while at Fox (though he did several times after he left Fox).\n\nHenry Hathaway\n\nFilms: 30\n\nYears: 1940 – 1960\n\nAverage Film: 62.9\n\nBest Film: Call Northside 777\n\nWorst Film: Prince Valiant\n\nHis best years were before he joined Fox but he was a proficient director during his two decades at the studio, especially in 1951 when he directed four films.\n\nJoseph L. Mankiewicz\n\nFilms: 13\n\nYears: 1946 – 1972\n\nAverage Film: 73.6\n\nBest Film: All About Eve\n\nWorst Film: Cleopatra\n\nHow many directors have both their best and worst films nominated for Best Picture? Mankiewicz began as a writer and then a producer before Zanuck finally let him start directing. He won four Oscars in two years for A Letter to Three Wives and All About Eve and went out with a bang with Sleuth but he also made Cleopatra which almost sank the studio. Without Cleopatra his average film goes up to 76.9.\n\nHenry Koster\n\nFilms: 19\n\nYears: 1948 – 1965\n\nAverage Film: 62.0\n\nBest Film: My Cousin Rachel\n\nWorst Film: Wabash Avenue\n\nThe last of the Henry directors came along at the end of the Studio Era. He wasn’t a great director and what was by far his best film (Harvey) wasn’t at Fox.\n\nJean Negulesco\n\nFilms: 20\n\nYears: 1948 – 1970\n\nAverage Film: 59.2\n\nBest Film: How to Marry a Millionaire\n\nWorst Film: Three Coins in the Fountain\n\nUnfortunately arriving at Fox after his one Oscar nomination (Johnny Belinda), he was prolific in the 50s, directing 16 films in the decade. They weren’t very good but he made a lot of them.\n\nThe Stars\n\nJanet Gaynor\n\nThe Fox star as the studio transitioned from silent to sound and the winner of the initial Best Actress Oscar. Gaynor worked a lot with director Frank Borzage and was often teamed with Charles Farrell. To me, Gaynor was definitely the best actress of the first decade of the Sound Era.\n\nEssential Viewing: Sunrise, Lucky Star, 7th Heaven, Street Angel\n\nShirley Temple\n\nThe little star was Fox’s biggest money, especially in the first few years after the merger with 20th Century. There is the famous story (repeated in numerous books listed towards the bottom) where John Steinbeck let Zanuck end a meeting after he heard that Temple broke a tooth, noting how important Temple was to the studio. She faded after she hit adolescence and eventually left pictures.\n\nEssential Viewing: Bright Eyes, Curly Top, Heidi\n\nHenry Fonda\n\nThe classic actor was never exclusively signed to Fox but they kept finding films for him and he would eventually sign a long-term contract so that he could play Tom Joad.\n\nEssential Viewing: The Grapes of Wrath, Young Mr. Lincoln, My Darling Clementine\n\nGregory Peck\n\nThe quintessential decent man and a perfect successor to Henry Fonda. He developed from Fox and was in a number of key films, including a Best Picture winner and a nominee before the Studio Era ended.\n\nEssential Viewing: Gentleman’s Agreement, 12 O’Clock High, The Keys of the Kingdom\n\nTyrone Power\n\nPower’s matinee good looks and charisma made up for having a much more marginal ability when compared to Fonda or Peck.\n\nEssential Viewing: Son of Fury, The Mark of Zorro, The Razor’s Edge, Nightmare Alley\n\nBetty Grable\n\nActing was never her strong suit but she was America’s #1 pin-up girl during World War II and she was a huge star throughout the entire decade.\n\nEssential Viewing: How to Marry a Millionaire, Pin Up Girl, Down Argentine Way\n\nMarilyn Monroe\n\nShe started as a bit player and her early Fox work included All About Eve. But then people (men) started to notice her and she was off and running. She would leave Fox at the top of her game in 1956.\n\nEssential Viewing: The Seven Year-Itch, How to Marry a Millionaire, Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, Bus Stop\n\nSigourney Weaver\n\nEven had she done nothing but the Alien films for the studio, that probably would be enough. But she also gave them one of the best acting performances of her career, earned two Oscar nominations and had a key role in the highest grossing film of all-time.\n\nEssential Viewing: Alien, Aliens, The Ice Storm, Avatar, Working Girl\n\nGenres\n\n“One important approach that Zanuck brought to Fox from his years at Warner Bros., was a cycle of biographies of great men (and, in a few instances, women).” (Lev, p 30)\n\n“Almost a quarter of the movies made during Zanuck’s tenure there were set between 1865 and 1902; a third were musicals. … No other studio gave the musical a decidedly rural twist. … And, before other studios were making wide use of it, Zanuck decided that the nostalgic world of musicals meant our memories would be recorded in Technicolor. Between the years of three-strip Technicolor’s perfection (1936) and the widespread industry shift away from black and white (1954), almost two out of every three color films made in Hollywood were done at Twentieth-Century Fox.” (Custen, p 200)\n\n“Twentieth Century-Fox did not make the so-called integrated musicals of MGM, where musical elements developed plot and character and vice versa. Fox musicals were more like revues or variety shows, where the musical numbers are realistic moments of the plot (e.g., nightclub scenes, or trips to the theater) rather than fantasy expressions of the characters’ inner feelings.” (Lev, p 88)\n\nBut Fox was most-known for Social Dramas, films with a message like The Grapes of Wrath or Gentleman’s Agreement, even though less than a third of the films I have seen from Fox are Dramas. They did like Mystery series, with a few Sherlock Holmes films, the Moto films (eight in all) and the Charlie Chan films a series that produced over 20 films over a decade covering both the original Fox and 20th Century-Fox. That would continue in later years as they would make big franchises in a different genre, Sci-Fi with first, Planet of the Apes (seven films through 2011) and then Star Wars as well as X-Men in Action. They would also embrace Action Cop films in later years making two of the best of them (The French Connection, Die Hard). Fox wasn’t big on War films before 1941 with just a handful but they got big during the war (I’ve seen six from 1943 alone) and continued through the 50s. They weren’t as big on Westerns as other studios but they made their fair share with a few from John Ford and several Cisco Kid films. They would embrace Parodies among their Comedies, first with the Flint films, then with Mel Brooks followed by Hot Shots and the terrible current trend of Parody films (Epic Movie, Meet the Spartans).\n\nThe Top 100 20th Century-Fox Films\n\nThe Princess Bride\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath\n\nSunrise: A Song of Two Humans\n\nAll About Eve\n\nM*A*S*H\n\nAlien\n\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\n\nMoulin Rouge!\n\nThe French Connection\n\nSlumdog Millionaire\n\nThe Ice Storm\n\nIn America\n\nStar Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back\n\nSideways\n\nThe Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\n\nAll That Jazz\n\nThe Hustler\n\nThe Ox-Bow Incident\n\nSleuth (1972)\n\nMinority Report\n\nMiller’s Crossing\n\nSay Anything\n\nKingdom of Heaven\n\nBroadcast News\n\nThe Last of the Mohicans (1992)\n\nThe Verdict\n\nMaster and Commander: The Far Side of the World\n\nThe Commitments\n\nThe Descendants\n\nKagemusha\n\nNight and the City (1950)\n\nJuno\n\nGrand Canyon\n\nSolaris\n\nYoung Frankenstein\n\nPickup on South Street\n\nBreaking Away\n\nThe Diary of Anne Frank\n\nBlack Swan\n\nThe Crucible (1996)\n\nRomeo + Juliet\n\nA Letter to Three Wives\n\nOscar and Lucinda\n\nThe Full Monty\n\nThe Tree of Life\n\nThe Gunfighter\n\nBetrayal\n\nKinsey\n\nStar Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\n\nOnce\n\nBarton Fink\n\nThe Darjeeling Limited\n\nNever Let Me Go\n\n7th Heaven (1927)\n\nDie Hard\n\nTwo for the Road\n\nGentleman’s Agreement\n\nThe Miracle on 34th Street (1947)\n\nThe Leopard\n\nAliens\n\nStar Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi\n\nPatton\n\nStar Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones\n\n***.5\n\nNosferatu the Vampyre\n\nWalkabout\n\nFight Club\n\nEdward Scissorhands\n\nSons and Lovers\n\nX2\n\nWalk the Line\n\nPrizzi’s Honor\n\nPanic in the Streets\n\nThe Stunt Man\n\nThe Good Thief\n\nX-Men\n\nMy Darling Clementine\n\nNotes on a Scandal\n\n(500) Days of Summer\n\nSexy Beast\n\nThank You for Smoking\n\nFantastic Mr. Fox\n\n127 Hours\n\nThe Phantom of Liberty\n\nI ♥ Huckabees\n\nLucky Star\n\nThe Bravados\n\nNo Way Out (1950)\n\nBulworth\n\nThe Savages\n\nBoomerang (1947)\n\nCompulsion\n\nDead Ringers\n\nDown with Love\n\nRaising Arizona\n\nBig\n\nCrazy Heart\n\n28 Days Later\n\nQuills\n\nGarden State\n\nNotable 20th Century-Fox Films Not in the Top 100\n\nnote: Includes all films I have either already reviewed or have current plans to review in the future (for Adapted Screenplay) as well as all films I saw in the theater.\n\nHow Green Was My Valley (#101)\n\nThe Thin Red Line (#103)\n\nEnemies, a Love Story (#104)\n\nSilkwood (#105)\n\nThe Snake Pit (#108)\n\nPlenty (#109)\n\nIce Cold in Alex (#110)\n\nNorthwest Frontier (#111)\n\nFrench Connection II (#112)\n\nThieves’ Highway (#114)\n\nA Hatful of Rain (#115)\n\nHeaven Knows, Mr. Allison (#116)\n\nThe History Boys (#118)\n\nThe Prime of Miss Jean Brodie (#119)\n\nLaura (#124)\n\nThe Last King of Scotland (#125)\n\nState Fair (1933) (#128)\n\nStar Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace (#131)\n\nThe King and I (#134)\n\nA Tree Grows in Brooklyn (#135)\n\nAnd Then There Were None (#136)\n\nStreet Angel (#138)\n\nDecision Before Dawn (#139)\n\nKissing Jessica Stein (#140)\n\nSilver Streak (#143)\n\nHeaven Can Wait (#144)\n\n***\n\nYellow Sky (#147)\n\nHot Shots!

The films are listed in alphabetical order. Unless I have something specific to say, I don’t mention films that have full reviews elsewhere or films that I saw in the theater from 1989 to 2005 (they are all mentioned in those Nighthawk Awards).\n\nBig Trouble in Little China – I rewatched this recently with Veronica because she loves it. I hated it even more than I used to. Insipidly stupid at every level.\n\nBlack Widow – I was probably in the minority since my approach to this film was “who cares about Theresa Russell when Debra Winger is right there!”\n\nDreamscape – For a mostly no-name director (Joseph Ruben), a visionary Sci-Fi film.\n\nGleaming the Cube – Set and filmed in Orange County, this was the first film I ever saw where I recognized locations.\n\nHangover Square – I saw this because Stephen Sondheim in one of his books mentioned the Bernard Herrmann score was fantastic. He was right.\n\nHarry and Tonto – Not a bad film but the pick of Art Carney for Best Actor over Jack Nicholson and Al Pacino is one of the most bizarre choices the Academy has ever made.\n\nThe History of the World Part I – It did not hold up that well when I watched it with Veronica but there are still some very funny scenes. It’s good to be the king.\n\nHow I Got Into College – The process is so different now I don’t know that it would find an audience today but it hilariously satirizes a lot of what I went through.\n\nIce Cold in Alex – Really good film that I saw because it was BAFTA nominated. See it if you can. Great cast.\n\nKnight and Day – Kind of the opposite of Gleaming, because I recognized the locations but they got them all wrong. Uses the geography of Boston at complete random.\n\nLake Placid – This movie is completely ridiculous but it’s hard to get more ridiculously awesome than the scene where a crocodile eats a bear.\n\nLeave Her to Heaven – Widely regarded as a classic but just a 69 on my scale. Tierney’s performance, to me, is really the only solid thing about it.\n\nLove is News – Given that it stars both Tyrone Power and Loretta Young, neither of whom do anything for me, this is a surprisingly engaging and charming Rom-Com.\n\nLucas – Kerri Green as a cheerleader. Formative film for me.\n\nNorthwest Frontier – Like Ice Cold in Alex, directed by J. Lee Thompson when he was still a good director and earned BAFTA noms. Really good.\n\nOffice Space – I feel the need to point out that I took my baseball bat to my printer in 1998, a year before this film was released. With one swing, it went from one piece to fifteen. It was very satisfying.\n\nPigskin Parade – Mediocre Comedy but the first solid proof that Judy Garland had real acting talent.\n\nThe Poseidon Adventure – How to do a disaster movie right. Not great but good solid entertainment and good acting (a rarity in the genre).\n\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show – Saw it at midnight in a theater my first time. The right way to see it. Not a huge fan but “The Time Warp” is an awesome song.\n\nThe Simpsons Movie – Proof that it works better in a half-hour format. Good but not remotely close to the level of the best the show has had to offer.\n\nSon of Fury: The Story of Benjamin Blake – James Leer is right. It’s not bad. Actually, it’s maybe the most enjoyable film Power ever made.\n\nThe Vanishing – A great example of why you don’t remake films even if it’s the same director. Sandra Bullock is damn cute though.\n\nX-Men: First Class – Didn’t see it in the theater but it’s one of the better X-Men films, especially the magnificent scene where Magneto confronts the men in Argentina. Fantastic music in that scene.\n\nX-Men: Last Stand – This is why you don’t hand your franchise over to Brett Ratner. Not terrible (to me, anyway, many do think it’s terrible) but a big fall from the first two.\n\nWitchcraft – Very effective mid 60’s British Horror film.\n\nThe 8 Most Under-Rated Fox Films\n\nThese are all films that I rate at **** that have never appeared in TSPDT’s Top 1000 (now 2000) or their Top 250 21st Century Films (now 1000). I also eliminated any films that were nominated for Best Picture or Best Director as well as any massive box office hits. These eight films are what is left – under-rated by awards groups at the time, under-rated at the box office, under-rated by current critical esteem. I list them in chronological order.\n\nThe Gunfighter\n\nBetrayal\n\nThe Commitments\n\nGrand Canyon\n\nThe Crucible\n\nOscar and Lucinda\n\nSolaris\n\nKingdom of Heaven\n\nThe Best Fox Films by Decade\n\n1920’s: Sunrise\n\n1930’s: Lucky Star\n\n1940’s: The Grapes of Wrath\n\n1950’s: All About Eve\n\n1960’s: Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\n\n1970’s: Star Wars\n\n1980’s: The Princess Bride\n\n1990’s: The Age of Innocence\n\n2000’s: Moulin Rouge\n\n2010’s: The Descendants\n\nnote: All of these are high **** except Lucky Star which is ***.5.

Except for 1914 and 1915 (two films each year), there is no year before the merger where I am above 30%.\n\nnote: I have seen at least 50% of all films in every year after 1938. I am over 60% for every year after 1961. I am over 70% for every year after 1985. I am over 80% for every year after 1999.

It would jump into 3rd place in 1941 and move into 2nd place in 1942. It would pass MGM and move into 1st place in 1961 and has been there every since.\n\nThe Top Films:\n\nFox would win just the second Nighthawk in 1928 and would its first post-merger in 1940, just the third studio to win two awards. But it would have to wait 30 years for its next award, finally becoming the 6th studio to win three. It would win two more in the decade but still be the sixth each time.

Another 25 films earn Nighthawk nominations with six of them being #2 films including Lucky Star even though it’s only ***.5 (1930 is a weak year). In total, 61 films make the Top 10 and 113 make the Top 20. Fox wins seven Picture awards each in both Drama and Comedy with 32 total Drama nominations and 22 total Comedy nominations.\n\nNine films win the Oscar though Slumdog, which is Fox Searchlight, is the only one to do it since 1971. The first two (Sunrise, Cavalcade) were from before the merger. There have been 61 other nominees, 6 of were just Fox and eight of which are Searchlight. Since 2003 there have been 8 nominees, all of which were Searchlight except for Avatar. Fox has also had several of the worst nominees ever in this category (Doctor Dolittle, Cleopatra, Towering Inferno, Peyton Place, Three Coins in the Fountain, Love is a Many-Splendored Thing). From 1949 to 1955, Fox had six films nominated for Picture, none of which were nominated for Director or Screenplay and of their seven nominees from 1962 to 1969 five of them were not nominated for Director or Screenplay.\n\nAt the Globes, Fox has won 8 Drama awards and 13 Comedy awards. But through 1977, Fox had won five of each but from 1979 to 2005, Fox won no Drama awards and won 8 Comedy awards before finally taking three Drama awards in the last four years. Searchlight has won two Drama awards (Slumdog, Descendants) and only one Comedy award (Sideways).\n\nEight films have won the BAFTA with another 28 nominees. Only one film (Last King of Scotland) has won British Film with another 11 earning nominations. The Full Monty and Slumdog are both among the oddities that have won Picture but not British Film.\n\nBoth Sideways and Slumdog won the BFCA while 19 other films have earned nominations. With the BFCA coming out at the same time as Searchlight, only 7 of the 21 nominated films are from the regular studio. In five different years (2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2011), Searchlight has had multiple nominees.\n\nMoulin Rouge, Little Miss Sunshine and Slumdog have won the PGA while nine other films have earned nominations.\n\nThe most dominant critics winners are Sideways (4 wins), Grapes of Wrath and Sons and Lovers (two each when there were only two groups). Slumdog also won two while 16 other films have won one each including three years where multiple Fox films won one each (1970 – M*A*S*H, Patton, 1977 – Star Wars, Turning Point, 2011 – Tree of Life, Descendants).\n\nBest Director\n\nJohn Ford (The Grapes of Wrath)\n\nGeorge Lucas (Star Wars)\n\nRidley Scott (Alien)\n\nF.W. Murnau (Sunrise)\n\nWilliam Friedkin (The French Connection)\n\nAnalysis: Six Fox films win the Nighthawk though instead of Friedkin it’s Robert Altman (M*A*S*H) and Danny Boyle (Slumdog). There are also another 27 nominees and 37 more Top 10 finishes. There are eight Drama winners and 27 more nominees as well as 7 Comedy winners and 20 nominees.\n\nThere are 11 Oscar winners including three that didn’t win Best Picture (7th Heaven, Bad Girl, Grapes of Wrath). There are also another 39 Oscar nominees including five in 1943 and 1944 and three in 1977. In the 30s, Fox won the award twice but earned no other nominations. The longest streak was 1956-61 while the longest drought was 1989-1996.\n\nEight Fox films have won the Globe, though there are big droughts (from 1947 to 1960, from 1960 to 1971 and from 1985 to 2008). There are another 25 nominees with A Hatful of Rain the only film to earn a nomination without a Picture nom. Prizzi’s Honor is the only winner from the Comedy categories.\n\nFox has done well at the BAFTAs here. It has won seven awards in just over 40 years and the main studio has won five awards just since its last Oscar. There have also been 13 other nominees.\n\nThree Fox films have won the BFCA (Moulin Rouge, Minority Report, Slumdog) while six other films have earned nominations.\n\nSix films have won the DGA, though, like at the Oscars, after 1971 there is just one winner and its a Searchlight film (Slumdog). There have been 33 nominees with Joseph L. Mankiewicz the only director with two wins and the only one with more than two nominations (he has three).\n\nPrizzi’s Honor and Tree of Life both won three awards while Elia Kazan won two awards in 1947 (for both Gentleman’s Agreement and Boomerang, both of them Fox films) and Sons and Lovers won two awards in 1960, both when there still only two groups. Aside from that, Thin Red Line and Slumdog both won two awards while 13 films have won one each.\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay:\n\nThe Princess Bride\n\nThe Grapes of Wrath\n\nAll About Eve\n\nM*A*S*H\n\nThe Ice Storm\n\nAnalysis: Seven films win the Nighthawk but again, one of my Top 5 is out (Ice Storm) though Sunrise, Sideways and Slumdog are all in. There are another 27 nominees. There are 6 Drama winners and 32 nominees and 8 Comedy winners and 12 nominees.\n\nThere have been 10 Oscar winners but they are spread out oddly with one each in the 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s but none in the 60s, three in the 70s, none in the 80s or 90s and then two in 00s and one in 2011. There have also been 32 other nominees including at least two in every decade. Of the four Fox Searchlight films to earn nominations only 127 Hours failed to win the award.\n\nFour of the five Globe winners in the Screenplay category are adapted (All About Eve, Five Fingers, Sideways, Slumdog). Fox would go an astounding 52 years between wins in this category (yes, the category would be defunct for a decade during that, but still). There have been 28 Fox films nominated for Screenplay at the Globes an 18 of them qualify as adapted though none between 1985 and 2000.\n\nIn the years where there was one BAFTA category, one winner (Julia) and three nominees were adapted. Since the split, Fox has won this category six times and earned eight other nominations.\n\nThere have been two BFCA winners (Sideways, Slumdog) and three nominees.\n\nThe Snake Pit won two WGA awards. There have also been seven winners in the genre category era as well as eight winners since the adapted split. There have been 138 total films nominated for the WGA.\n\nSideways swept all the critics awards. Naked Lunch won four awards while Slumdog won two and Hustler, Pretty Poison and Descendants won one each.\n\nBest Original Screenplay:\n\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\n\nThe Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nSay Anything\n\nBroadcast News\n\nAnalysis: The only Nighthawk winners are Butch, Discreet, Broadcast News and Miller’s Crossing. There are 19 other Nighthawk nominees. At my Globes, there are 6 Drama winners and 14 other nominees as well as 4 Comedy winners and 20 other nominees.\n\nThere have been 10 Oscar winners including Miracle on 34th Street which won both awards. It would take until 1944 for Fox to win this award and there would be no winners between 1954 and 1969 and none between 1979 and 2006. The peak was 1944 to 1954 (when, admittedly, there were two categories) when Fox managed 22 nominations and 5 wins with four nominations in 1944 and five in 1950.\n\nOf the Globe nominees, one winner (Miracle) and 10 other nominees qualify as original. Of the BAFTA nominees, three early winners were original and there have been three winners since the split as well as eight early nominees and four nominees since the split. There have been three BFCA winners (In America, Little Miss Sunshine, Juno) and four nominees. Panic in the Streets was the only original script to win an award in the genre era while six films have won since the adapted / original split. As mentioned above there have been 138 total films to earn nominations which includes 26 Fox films just from 1948 to 1950. An Unmarried Woman won four awards while Breaking Away, Broadcast News, Juno and The Savages won two each and Bulworth and In America each won one.\n\nBest Actor:\n\nHenry Fonda (The Grapes of Wrath)\n\nPaul Newman (The Hustler)\n\nGene Hackman (The French Connection)\n\nGeorge C. Scott (Patton)\n\nRoy Scheider (All That Jazz)\n\nAnalysis: There are eight Nighthawk winners but this time two of them don’t win the Nighthawk (Scott, Scheider). But aside from the first three, there are Michael Caine (Sleuth), Newman again (The Verdict), William Hurt (Broadcast News), Forrest Whitaker (Last King of Scotland) and Clooney (The Descendants). There are also another 28 nominees. There are nine Comedy winners with more in the 80’s (four) than there were before the 80’s (three) and another 26 Comedy nominees. There are also nine Drama winners (De Niro for King of Comedy and Douglas for Wall Street instead of Hurt) and 30 other nominees.\n\nThere have been eight Oscar winners but they are oddly spaced. There was one winner for the old Fox (Warner Baxter for In Old Arizona) then the merged company would have to wait until 1956 for Yul Brynner to win and another 14 years before the next Oscar. But then, Fox won three Oscars in four years (Scott, Hackman and Art Carney). Since then, though, just one win for the main corporation (Douglas) and two recently for Fox Searchlight (Whitaker, Jeff Bridges). There have been 36 other nominees, including three in 1972 and twice losing to a Fox winner. Fox Searchlight is also riding a four year streak of nominees through 2011, the longest streak in studio history.\n\nFox has won the Globe Drama award nine times, but they are spread out. After winning in 1944 (Alexander Knox for Wilson) it wouldn’t win again until Scott in 1970. And it would win five total times through 2000 but Fox Searchlight has won four times in just the last six years (Whitaker, Mickey Rourke, Bridges, Clooney). There have been 29 other nominees including two each for Sons and Lovers and Sleuth. There have been 8 Comedy winners (all from the main studio), two each in the 50’s, 80’s and 00’s and one in 1974 and 1993. There have also been another 30 nominees including two for M*A*S*H. In 2006, Fox won Comedy (Borat) while Searchlight won Comedy (Last King of Scotland).\n\nThere have been 11 BAFTA winners although Gene Hackman won for two different Fox films in 1972 (The French Connection, The Poseidon Adventure). There have been another 28 nominees. The last three winners have all been Searchlight films. Since the last regular studio nomination in 2005, Searchlight has two wins and six other nominations.\n\nOf the three BFCA winners and seven other nominees only Russell Crowe (Master and Commander) and Joaquin Phoenix (Walk the Line) weren’t from Searchlight films. Just in the last four years, Searchlight has two wins and five total nominations. It’s always the same at SAG with two Searchlight winners and five nominees as opposed to two regular studio nominees (in this case Tom Hanks (Cast Away) and Phoenix).\n\nWhitaker swept all six critics awards in 2006. The next best is three wins for George C. Scott (when there were only three groups) and three for Jack Nicholson (Prizzi’s Honor) when there were five groups. Six other actors have won two awards each while a whopping 23 others have won one each.\n\nBest Actress\n\nBette Davis (All About Eve)\n\nHolly Hunter (Broadcast News)\n\nAnne Baxter (All About Eve)\n\nNatalie Portman (Black Swan)\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer (The Fabulous Baker Boys)\n\nAnalysis: There have been 10 Nighthawk winners although neither Davis nor Baxter wins the award. It does include, aside from the other three, Janet Gaynor (twice), Olivia de Havilland (Snake Pit), Ingrid Bergman (Anastasia), Joanne Woodward (Three Faces of Eve), Bette Midler (Rose) and Cate Blanchett (Oscar and Lucinda). There have been 39 other nominees including the two from All About Eve and two from The Turning Point. The only Drama winner who didn’t win the regular award is Jane Fonda for Julia. There have been a total of 9 Drama winners and 44 total nominees. In Comedy, there have been 8 winners and 34 total nominees.\n\nA total of 12 films won the Oscar but that includes three films that all shared the initial Oscar for Janet Gaynor. Fox won three straights Oscars (1955-57) following Paramount’s three straight Oscars. It had three nominees in both 1957 (including the winner) and 1977 (when it didn’t win). In addition to the 12 winners there have been 40 nominees including two each for All About Eve and Turning Point.\n\nThere have been 9 Drama winners at the Globes, most recently about once a decade (1979, 1989, 1999, 2010) along with 21 other nominees with Anastasia receiving two nominations (though Eve and Turning Point only one each). There have been 14 Comedy winners but that includes winners in some really weak years like 1974 (Raquel Welch for Three Musketeers) and 1994 (Jamie Lee Curtis for True Lies). Kathleen Turner won back-to-back awards for Fox in 1984 and 1985 (Romancing the Stone, Prizzi’s Honor) while Walter Lang directed three winners in five years in the 50s. Fox took both awards in 1956 and 1979. There have also been another 22 Comedy nominees.\n\nAt the BAFTAs, Fox won four times in a decade (1969, 1970, 1973, 1978) and then didn’t win again for 27 years, winning six awards overall with another 24 nominations. In 1969, it earned three nominations. Fox Searchlight has won two BFCA with Fox winning another and there have a total of 10 nominations for the two studios combined (including winners). There have been three SAG winners and seven other nominees.\n\nMichelle Pfeiffer is the grand critics winner (5 awards) with four each for Sally Field (Norma Rae), Holly Hunter (Broadcast News) and Hilary Swank (Boys Don’t Cry) while Reese Witherspoon won three (Walk the Line), four others win two and 15 others win one each.\n\nBest Supporting Actor:\n\nAlec Guinness (Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope)\n\nGeorge Sanders (All About Eve)\n\nBen Kingsley (Sexy Beast)\n\nMandy Patinkin (The Princess Bride)\n\nGeorge C. Scott (The Hustler)\n\nAnalysis: Five performances win the Nighthawk but not Sanders (the best #3 of all-time) or Kingsley. Instead, Clifton Webb (Laura) and Kirk Douglas (A Letter to Three Wives) win. There are also another 30 nominees. There are four Drama winners (all of whom win the Nighthawk) and four Comedy winners (Patinkin, Michael Lerner (Barton Fink), Richard Pryor (Silver Streak), Thomas Haden Church (Sideways)). There are 41 total Drama nominees and 27 total Comedy nominees including three each for Star Wars, The Princess Bride and Barton Fink.\n\nThere have been 10 Oscar winners, seven from 1938 to 1952 then a 25 year gap, again in 1977 and 1985 then another big gap to 2006. There are also 35 other nominees including two each for Peyton Place and The Hustler and an another one for Julia. Fox managed three nominations in 1950 and an astounding four in 1977 but hasn’t had one since 2006 and not one for the main studio since 1991.\n\nThe studio has won seven Golden Globes including back-to-back odd choices of Richard Attenborough for The Sand Pebbles and Doctor Dolittle but hasn’t won the award since 1974. It does have 21 nominations including two each for The Hustler and Julia. Surprisingly, it has been nominated more recently for the main studio (Michael Douglas for Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps in 2010) than Searchlight (Church in 2004).\n\nAfter winning an early award at the BAFTAs (Fred Astaire in 1974 for Towering Inferno), the studio would go over 20 years before its next award, winning again in 1996, 1997, 2001 and 2006. It has also earned 8 other nominations including a second for Inferno. Fox has won three BFCA awards (Quills, Sexy Beast, Sideways) and earned five other noms. However, in spite of five nominations, no Fox film has yet won SAG in this category. Church would win five critics awards with four actors winning two awards each and 12 others winning one award.\n\nBest Supporting Actress:\n\nSarah Bolger (In America)\n\nJoan Allen (The Crucible)\n\nSigourney Weaver (The Ice Storm)\n\nCeleste Holm (Gentleman’s Agreement)\n\nJane Darwell (The Grapes of Wrath)\n\nAnalysis: There are four Nighthawk winners though this is the lowest crossover with only Bolger winning the award along with Sally Kellerman (M*A*S*H), Jeannie Berlin (The Heartbreak Kid) winning weak years and Vanessa Redgrave (Julia) just outside the Top 5. Aside from that there are 37 other nominees including two each from The Song of Bernadette, Gentleman’s Agreement, All About Eve and Enemies a Love Story. There have been 3 Drama winners, 6 Comedy winners, 40 Drama nominees and 27 Comedy nominees (including three from Young Frankenstein).\n\nFox has won 9 Oscars and earned 49 nominations but for only 41 films. The 8 films with two nominations (including Gentleman’s Agreement which also won the award) is a record for any studio and Fox did it twice in 1949 (Pinky, Come to the Stable) and again in 1950 (All About Eve) and then in back-to-back years again in 1988-89 (Working Girl, Enemies a Love Story). Fox hasn’t won the award since Marisa Tomei’s surprise win in 1992 and though Searchlight has earned 8 of those nominations in just over a decade, it has never won.\n\nThe studio has won 7 Globes but hasn’t won since 1988. It has also earned another 33 nominations. There have been two BAFTA winners (Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, Ice Storm) and another 16 nominations. Joan Allen (The Crucible) and Virginia Madsen (Sideways) would win the BFCA with seven other nominees. No Supporting Actress has yet won at SAG in spite of 9 nominations (all but one of which were for Searchlight films).\n\nAnjelica Huston (Prizzi’s Honor) would win all five existing critics awards. Chloe Sevigny (Boys Don’t Cry), Madsen and Jessica Chastain (Tree of Life but shared with other films) would win four each. Two others would win two each and 14 actresses would win award each.\n\nBest Ensemble\n\nAll About Eve\n\nThe Princess Bride\n\nThe Crucible\n\nIn America\n\nThe Hustler\n\nAnalysis: This is based on the total points for acting for all members of the cast. Four of them have very strong leads while The Princess Bride has a massive list of great supporting work.\n\nBest Editing:\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nSlumdog Millionaire\n\nAlien\n\nThe Princess Bride\n\nThe French Connection\n\nAnalysis: The first four would win the Nighthawk as would Sunrise, The Grapes of Wrath and M*A*S*H while 26 other films would earn nominations.\n\nEight Fox films have won the Oscar though only one before 1965 (Wilson) and only one since 1979 (Slumdog) while five won in the 70s. Another 44 films have earned nominations and Fox had three nominees each (including the winner) in both 1970 and 1977. Every Fox film with 10 or more Oscar nominations earned an Editing nom.\n\nSix films have won the BAFTA with another 13 nominations. Avatar won the BFCA with two other nominees. Eleven films have won the ACE with four of them since 2001 after a 22 year gap. There have also been 37 ACE nominees. Slumdog and Black Swan won critics awards.\n\nBest Cinematography:\n\nThe Last of the Mohicans\n\nSunrise\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nAlien\n\nKagemusha\n\nAnalysis: There is a sixth perfect score for Cinematography: The Grapes of Wrath. As usual, that doesn’t mean these all win the Nighthawk (French Connection does while Alien and Kagemusha don’t). Including the winners there are 35 total Nighthawk nominees.\n\nFox has won 22 Oscars for Cinematography including both awards in 1941 and 1944 and at least one winner each year from 1941 to 1946 and 1959 to 1964. Including the winners, it’s had 89 total nominees including 27 in the 40’s and 19 in the 50’s. It did go almost 30 years between winners (1974 to 2003).\n\nOnly five films have won the BAFTA with only Last of the Mohicans and Slumdog since 1980 with another 18 nominations. Avatar and Tree of Life won the BFCA with two other nominees. Four films have won the ASC (Hoffa, Thin Red Line, Slumdog, Tree of Life) with seven other nominees. Tree of Life won all five critics awards, Barton Fink won four, Fabulous Baker Boys and Thin Red Line won three each while two others won two and two others beyond that won one each.\n\nBest Original Score:\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nThe Last of the Mohicans\n\nStar Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back\n\nThe Princess Bride\n\nStar Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\n\nAnalysis: The other three Star Wars films also have perfect scores. Eight Fox films win the Nighthawk (Star Wars, Empire, Phantom Menace, Revenge, Mohicans, Princess Bride, Laura, Slumdog) while another 26 earn nominations.\n\nFox has won 14 Score Oscars as well as two Adapted Score Oscars, though again, it had a long stretch between winners (1977 to 1997). In total, 88 films have been nominated for one of the Score awards (including winners).\n\nFox has won 7 Globes, usually about once a decade (1949, 1969, 1977, 1980, 1995, 2001, 2008). It has also earned 20 nominations. Seven films have won the BAFTA with another 14 nominations. Minority Report and Slumdog won the BFCA with two other nominees. Four films have won critics awards.\n\nBest Sound:\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nThe French Connection\n\nDie Hard\n\nMoulin Rouge\n\nMaster and Commander: The Far Side of the World\n\nAnalysis: All of these earn perfect scores as do (in chronological order) Alien, Kagemusha, Empire, Jedi, Fight Club, Phantom Menace, Minority Report and Revenge of the Sith. Yet, the Nighthawk winners are Lifeboat, Patton, French Connection, Star Wars, Alien, Die Hard, Last of the Mohicans and Phantom Menace. There are also 41 more Nighthawk nominees, one of the studio’s best categories.\n\nFox has done well here with 13 Oscars, at least in one in every decade since the 40’s (except the 10’s so far) and two in all but the 80’s and 00’s. It has been nominated an additional 41 times including three nominations in 1977.\n\nFox has won nine BAFTAs as well as earning 17 other nominations. In the 80’s and 90’s, Fox won the award only twice while earning 11 other noms but in the 00’s, it has won four times with only two additional noms. Avatar won the BFCA while three others have been nominated. Master and Commander, Walk the Line and Slumdog have won CAS while nine other films have earned noms.\n\nBest Art Direction:\n\nMoulin Rouge\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nKagemusha\n\nAlien\n\nThe Princess Bride\n\nAnalysis: Only three films win the Nighthawk: Star Wars, Alien and Kagemusha. There are also 38 other nominees including Moulin Rouge (losing to Fellowship) and Princess Bride (losing to Last Emperor).\n\nFox has won the Oscar a whopping 22 times including both Oscars in 1942 and one of the two Oscars in four straight years (1941-44), though it wouldn’t win the award between 1979 and 2001. The studio would earn another 59 nominations with three each (including a winner) in 1955, 1956 and 1964.\n\nFox has won 6 BAFTAs with another 18 nominations. Avatar won the BFCA while two others have been nominated. Fox has won the ADG five times while earning nine other noms. Moulin Rouge won the LAFC.\n\nBest Visual Effects\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nAvatar\n\nStar Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith\n\nStar Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\n\nStar Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back\n\nAnalysis: There are also perfect scores for Alien, Independence Day and the other two Star Wars films. Fox does great here with 13 Nighthawk winners including the first four (chronological) Star Wars films and eight winners in the 70’s and 80’s alone. There are also 29 other nominees.\n\nFox has had more winners here (19) than regular nominees (17). That includes four winners in six years from 1962 to 1967 and 6 winners in 10 years from 1977 to 1989 including three Star Wars films (in fact, from 1977 to 1986 every Fox film nominated in the category won the award). Predator, in 1987, was the first Fox film to lose the award since 1959 not to lose it to another Fox film (though that award, in 1970, when Patton lost to Tora Tora Tora is the only time Fox has been nominated twice in one year).\n\nOnly four Fox films have won the BAFTA (Jedi, Aliens, Day After Tomorrow, Avatar) while 12 other films have earned nominations. Avatar and Rise of the Planet of the Apes won the BFCA while Tree of Life was nominated.\n\nAvatar is the biggest film ever at the VES, winning six awards and losing five others (three of them to itself). Attack of the Clones and Rise of the Planet of the Apes have also done well while 17 other films have earned nominations.\n\nBest Sound Editing\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nFight Club\n\nDie Hard\n\nAlien\n\nStar Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back\n\nAnalysis: I actually have 10 Fox films with a perfect 9 here, one of the categories that Fox excels at. The other perfect 9 scores go to Minority Report and the other four Star Wars films. But the 10 winners are slightly different (Night and the City, Patton, French Connection, Aliens instead of Fight Club, Minority and the last two Star Wars films, though Fight Club loses to Phantom Menace). There are also 38 other nominees.\n\nI appreciate Fox in this category much more than the Oscars do, with the studio only winning four awards (Star Wars, Aliens, Speed, Master and Commander) with 10 other nominees, especially in 1999 when both Phantom Menace and Fight Club lost to The Matrix.\n\nAvatar is the rare film to win two awards and earn a third nominations from the MPSE while Damien: Omen II simply won two. Seven films have won an award and earned a second nom, 25 films have won the award, 8 films have earned two noms but didn’t win and 37 more have earned just one nom.\n\nBest Costume Design:\n\nMoulin Rouge\n\nKagemusha\n\nThe Princess Bride\n\nKingdom of Heaven\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nAnalysis: With the other three films against stiff competition (Fellowship of the Ring, Last Emperor, Memoirs of a Geisha), only Star Wars and Kagemusha win the Nighthawk though 36 films have earned nominations and the studio has never gone very long between nominations.\n\nFox won four early Oscars through 1956 but has only won four Oscars since with Moulin Rouge its only Oscar since 1979. It has won three BAFTAs (Those Magnificent Men, Kagemusha, Master and Commander) and earned 14 other noms. Black Swan is the only film to earn a BFCA nom. Three Fox films have won the CDG (Slumdog, Crazy Heart, Black Swan) and another 18 films have earned noms.\n\nBest Makeup\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nMoulin Rouge\n\nStar Wars Episode VI: The Return of the Jedi\n\nStar Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace\n\nStar Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back\n\nAnalysis: Eight Fox films win the Nighthawk although only Star Wars, Jedi and Phantom Menace from my Top 5. Also winning are Young Frankenstein, Alien, Quest for Fire, Aliens and Princess Bride. Another 24 films earn nominations.\n\nFox has won three Oscars (Planet of the Apes, Quest for Fire, Mrs Doubtfire) and earned five other nominations. It has won three BAFTAs (Quest for Fire, Name of the Rose, Last of the Mohicans) and earned 10 other nominations. Only two films have earned BFCA noms (Avatar, Black Swan). Moulin Rouge won four MUASG awards with Cast Away and Planet of the Apes winning an award each and six other films earning nominations (A Midsummer Night’s Dream and Bedazzled earned two noms each).\n\nBest Technical Aspects\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nAlien\n\nStar Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back\n\nKagemusha\n\nMaster and Commander: The Far Side of the World\n\nAnalysis: Simply adding up all the points in the technical categories. The first Star Wars is one of the best films ever on this list, irregardless of studio.\n\nBest Original Song:\n\n“Jai Ho” (Slumdog Millionaire)\n\n“Falling Slowly” (Once)\n\n“Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head” (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid)\n\n“Storybook Love” (The Princess Bride)\n\n“Suicide is Painless” (M*A*S*H)\n\nAnalysis: Three films both win the Nighthawk and earn a second nomination (Slumdog, She’s the One, Love Me Tender) with seven other films earning just a win and an additional 21 films just earning a nomination.\n\nThe only Fox film to do the double (win plus a nomination) is Slumdog. Twelve films just win the Nighthawk. The studio won nine Oscars from 1943 to 1979 then only one more between 1979 and 2007 (1988) before winning three straight from 2007 to 2009. An additional 37 films have earned nominations and only twice has the studio gone more than three years between nominations (a seven year gap from 1980 to 1987 and a ten year gap from 1997 to 2007).\n\nFox has won seven Globes including two in a row in 2008 and 2009. They have also earned 16 other noms. Fox did manage a nomination during the short-lived BAFTA category for Give My Regards to Broad Street.\n\nAmazingly, Fox won this award four times in a row at the BFCA (adding 127 Hours to the Oscar winners although The Wrestler won instead of Slumdog) as well as earning three other noms.\n\nBest Animated Film:\n\nFantastic Mr. Fox\n\nAnalysis: That’s the only Animated Film to earn ***.5 or **** from me and thus is the only one on the list (and is the only Nighthawk nominee).\n\nThere have been two Oscar nominations: Ice Age and Fox. The Simpsons Movie and Fox both earned Globe noms and BAFTA noms. There have been four BFCA noms: Waking Life, Ice Age, Simpsons, Fox. There have been eight Annie nominations but they tend to favor the big studio films. Fox won two critics awards and Waking Life won one.\n\nBest Foreign Film:\n\nThe Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie\n\nKagemusha\n\nThe Leopard\n\nNosferatu the Vampyre\n\nPhantom of Liberty\n\nAnalysis: Kagemusha wins Foreign Film at the Nighthawks while four others earn nominations, though The Leopard doesn’t (coming in sixth in a very tough year) and Liliom does.\n\nFox has won two Oscars (Discreet Charm, Volver a Empezar, which was a 20th Century Fox International Classics release) and seven other nominations (one from Searchlight). For me, see the section above on Foreign Films. There have been eight Globe noms including two each in 1974 and 1982 but has never won the award. There have been no BAFTA noms. The only BFCA nom is Water. No Fox film has won a critics award.\n\nBest Film (by my points system):\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nThe Princess Bride\n\nAlien\n\nStar Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back\n\nKingdom of Heaven\n\nAnalysis: This is a category that simply adds up all the points I use in my system. The Princess Bride benefits from lots of acting while the others benefit from great Tech work across the board.\n\nBest Film (weighted points system)\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nThe Princess Bride\n\nAlien\n\nAll About Eve\n\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\n\nAnalysis: Star Wars finishes just one point above The Princess Bride with a big drop to Alien and another big drop to Eve (which finishes so high because of the acting which is weighted higher). Kingdom of Heaven is 6th and Empire is 9th.\n\nBest Films With No Top 5 Finishers:\n\nSideways\n\nMinority Report\n\nMiller’s Crossing\n\nSleuth\n\nThe Ox-Bow Incident\n\nThe Verdict\n\nThe Descendants\n\nThe Commitments\n\nnote: These are all the films that earn a 94 or higher that don’t manage to land in the Top 5 in any category.\n\nWorst Film with a Top 5 Finish:\n\nAvatar\n\nNighthawk Notables\n\nBest Film to Watch Over and Over: Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nBest Line (comedic): “Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.” (Mandy Patinkin in The Princess Bride)\n\nBest Line (dramatic): “You don’t know the power of the dark side.” (James Earl Jones in Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back)\n\nBest Opening: Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nBest Ending: Slumdog Millionaire\n\nBest Scene: the trench sequence in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nBest Kiss: Freida Pinto and Dev Patel in Slumdog Millionaire\n\nBest Death: Wallace Shawn in The Princess Bride\n\nMost Gut-Wrenching Scene: John Hurt’s death in Alien\n\nMost Heart-Breaking Scene: “Say goodbye to Frankie, Dad.” (Sarah Bolger in In America)\n\nBest Use of a Song (Dramatic): “Elephant Love” (Moulin Rouge!)\n\nBest Use of a Song (Comedic): “You Can Leave Your Hat On” (The Full Monty)\n\nBest Original Song from a Bad Film: “Nothing’s Gonna Stop Us Now” (Mannequin)\n\nBest Soundtrack: Juno\n\nBest Non-Rock Soundtrack: Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope\n\nWatch the Film, SKIP the Book: Sideways\n\nRead the Book, SKIP the Film: The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\n\nFunniest Film: The Princess Bride\n\nBest Guilty Pleasure: Cannonball Run\n\nWorst Film by a Top 100 Director: Cleopatra (Joseph L.

I saw 67 Fox films in the theater, including seeing all six Star Wars films at least seven times each (Episode IV I have seen in the theater 20 times – 13 times originally and another 7 times for the special edition).\n\nAwards\n\nAcademy Awards\n\nNumber of Films That Have Earned Nominations: 345\n\nNumber of Films That Have Won Oscars: 107\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Nominations: 179\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Wins: 47\n\nBest Picture Nominations: 70\n\nTotal Number of Nominations: 951\n\nTotal Number of Wins: 212\n\nCategory With the Most Nominations: Cinematography (89)\n\nNumber of Films with Nominations I Haven’t Seen: 3\n\nDirectors with Most Oscar Nominated Films: Henry King (16)\n\nBest Film with No Oscar Nominations: The Ice Storm\n\nYear with Most Fox Nominated Films: 1950 (10) / 2006 (11) *\n\nYear with Most Fox Nominations: 1977 (35)\n\nYear with Most Fox Oscars: 1977 (10)\n\nOscar Oddities:\n\nIn 2006, four of the films were Searchlight films while in 1950, obviously, they were all just 20th Century-Fox films.\n\nThe 35 nominations in 1977 is tied for the fourth most ever but the most extraordinary thing is that 33 of them came from just three films. It is the only year in history where three films from the same studio had double digit nominations. It is only of three years when even two studios did it.\n\nThe Best Picture nominations break down like this: 8 for Fox, 9 for Fox Searchlight, the other 53 for 20th Century-Fox.\n\nThe Turning Point is tied as the biggest loser at the Oscars, going 0 for 11.\n\nOn the flip side, Slumdog is the only film with more than 5 nominations not to lose at least 3 of them (it went 8 for 10).\n\nThe only film to earn multiple nominations and win them all is Cocoon (2 for 2).\n\nHenry King dominates with 16 nominated films (including 7 Picture nominees), for a total of 66 nominations and 18 Oscars. In fact, no other director has ever been more successful at one studio at the Oscars.\n\nMost Oscar Nominations\n\nAll About Eve – 14\n\nThe Song of Bernadette – 12\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope – 11\n\nJulia – 11\n\nThe Turning Point – 11\n\nHow Green Was My Valley – 10\n\nWilson – 10\n\nThe Sound of Music – 10\n\nPatton – 10\n\nMaster and Commander: The Far Side of the World / Slumdog Millionaire – 10\n\nnote: All three of the films nominated for 11 awards are from the same year. Most lists don’t have Star Wars with 11 noms (including the Oscars themselves) but I count special awards in normal Oscar categories (like the Sound Editing award it won) as a nomination.\n\nMost Oscar Wins:\n\nSlumdog Millionaire – 8\n\nPatton – 7\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope – 7\n\nAll About Eve – 6\n\nHow Green Was My Valley – 5\n\nWilson – 5\n\nThe King and I – 5\n\nThe Sound of Music – 5\n\nThe French Connection – 5\n\nfour films – 4\n\nMost Oscar Points:\n\nAll About Eve – 625\n\nPatton – 540\n\nSlumdog Millionaire – 510\n\nHow Green Was My Valley – 480\n\nThe Song of Bernadette – 480\n\nThe French Connection – 465\n\nStar Wars Episode IV: A New Hope – 455\n\nJulia – 450\n\nWilson – 435\n\nThe Sound of Music – 425\n\nOscar Nominated Films:\n\nThere are only four years where no Fox films earned Oscar nominations: 1930, 1981, 1995, 2007 (and Searchlight had a nominee in 2007).\n\nFrom 1936 to 1999 there were never back-to-back years with fewer than 2 Fox films nominated and that streak goes from 1936 to the present if you include Searchlight.\n\nFox has lead with the most nominated films 13 times although, ironically, not in 1950 when it had its own high of 10 films nominated.\n\nThe high number for nominated films in one year is 7 in 1984.\n\nWhether alone or combined with the Fox Corporation, 20th Century-Fox was generally in 6th place among total nominated films until the late 40s. By 1956 it was in third place by itself (second when counting Fox). Through 2011, it is in third place by itself but in 1st when also counting Fox and Searchlight.\n\nBy Decade:\n\nnote: The first number is just 20th Century-Fox. The second number also includes Fox (20s and 30s) and Fox Searchlight (90s to present).\n\n1920’s: 0 / 6 (5th)\n\n1930’s: 19 (6th) / 28 (6th)\n\n1940’s: 68 (2nd)\n\n1950’s: 73 (2nd)\n\n1960’s: 37 (2nd)\n\n1970’s: 35 (3rd – tie)\n\n1980’s: 28 (5th)\n\n1990’s: 29 (5th – tie) / 33 (4th)\n\n2000’s: 15 (10th) / 31 (2nd – tie)\n\n2010’s: 3 (9th – tie) / 7 (4th)\n\nTotal: 307 (3rd) / 345 (1st)\n\nOscar Nominations:\n\n20th Century-Fox has had the most total nominations 13 times plus two more times for Fox and one more time where it has the most when combined with Searchlight.\n\nFox lead for the first two years though by its end in 1935, it had dropped to fifth. 20th Century-Fox, even without Fox, passed Columbia into 6th place in 1941 after just seven years. It would pass Warners and RKO in 1950, moving into 4th (and combined with Fox would have been in 2nd). It moved into 3rd in 1955 and 2nd in 1958 but was so far behind MGM that even the Fox nominations wouldn’t have gotten it close to 1st place. By 1979 the combined nominations put it in 1st and it took 1st on its own in 1987. It dropped from 1st place in 1995 though when combined with Fox it would have stayed until 2008 and when also combined with Searchlight it is still in 1st. As of 2011, 20th Century-Fox is in 3rd (846), Fox Searchlight is in 14th (73) and Fox is in 22nd (36) though combined they are easily in 1st.\n\nYears with Most Total Oscar Nominations:\n\n1977: 35\n\n1955: 26\n\n1950: 25\n\n1944: 23\n\n1943, 1947, 1965, 1970, 1972: 22\n\nBy Decade:\n\nnote: See same note above for total films.\n\n1920’s: 0 / 20 (1st)\n\n1930’s: 38 (7th) / 54 (7th)\n\n1940’s: 179 (1st)\n\n1950’s: 179 (2nd)\n\n1960’s: 132 (2nd)\n\n1970’s: 139 (1st)\n\n1980’s: 83 (5th)\n\n1990’s: 49 (8th) / 57 (8th)\n\n2000’s: 46 (8th) / 92 (2nd)\n\n2010’s: 3 (11th – tie) / 22 (3rd – tie)\n\nTotal: 848 (3rd) / 951 (1st)\n\nOscar Wins:\n\nFox’s longest streak with at least one win is 1952 to 1972 followed by 1937 to 1950.\n\nThe longest streak with no wins is 1997 to 2000, although if you count Searchlight the only streaks of more than one year are 1934 to 1936 (when the two companies were combining) and 1990-91.\n\n20th Century-Fox has lead all films with wins 11 times plus twice when it was still just Fox and once Searchlight did it. It lead three years in a row from 1969 to 1971.\n\nWhen Slumdog won 8 Oscars in 2008 it was as many as all of the Searchlight films combined to that point and as many as 20th Century-Fox had won from 1994 to 2008.\n\nFox was still in 1st place in total Oscars as late as 1934. 20th Century-Fox wouldn’t equal its parent company until 1941 by which point they were tied for 7th place among studios though combined they were in 2nd. With a few big years in a row, Fox would leap into 4th place but by 1947 it was all the way in 2nd place where it would stay for decades. In 1978, combined with Fox it moves into 1st place but wouldn’t do it on its own until 2001. It would be passed by Paramount in 2011 but when combined it is easily in 1st.\n\nBy Decade:\n\nnote: see note up above for films\n\n1920’s: 0 / 8 (1st)\n\n1930’s: 5 (8th) / 11 (6th)\n\n1940’s: 41 (1st)\n\n1950’s: 36 (2nd)\n\n1960’s: 30 (3rd)\n\n1970’s: 40 (1st)\n\n1980’s: 12 (6th)\n\n1990’s: 6 (12th) / 8 (10th – tie)\n\n2000’s: 8 (11th – tie) / 24 (1st)\n\n2010’s: 0 / 2 (7th)\n\nTotal: 178 (2nd) / 212 (1st)\n\nCritics Awards\n\nNumber of Films That Have Won Critics Awards: 98\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Awards: 49\n\nBest Picture Wins: 26\n\nTotal Number of Awards: 264\n\nCategory With the Most Awards: Actor (47)\n\nMost Awards:\n\nSideways – 22\n\nThe Tree of Life – 15\n\nPrizzi’s Honor – 12\n\nSlumdog Millionaire – 10\n\nThe Fabulous Baker Boys / Broadcast News – 9\n\nMost Points:\n\nSideways – 1541\n\nThe Tree of Life – 938\n\nPrizzi’s Honor – 824\n\nSlumdog Millionaire – 667\n\nBroadcast News – 664\n\nMost Points by Critics Group:\n\nNYFC: Broadcast News – 340\n\nLAFC: Sideways – 390\n\nNSFC: The Tree of Life – 270\n\nBSFC: Sideways – 240\n\nCFC: Sideways – 370\n\nNBR: The Turning Point – 230\n\nGolden Globes\n\nNumber of Films That Have Earned Nominations: 196\n\nNumber of Films That Have Won Globes: 67\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Nominations: 98\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Wins: 23\n\nBest Picture Nominations: 79\n\nBest Picture Wins: 21 (13 Comedy / 8 Drama)\n\nTotal Number of Nominations: 417\n\nTotal Number of Wins: 101\n\nCategory With the Most Nominations: Picture (79)\n\nBest Film with No Globe Nominations: The Princess Bride\n\nGlobe Oddities:\n\nSince 1952, Fox has won Best Picture 18 times and Best Director 6 times but it has only won Best Screenplay twice (Sideways / Slumdog).\n\nEvery film nominated for at least six awards won at least one award.
