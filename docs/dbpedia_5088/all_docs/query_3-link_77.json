        "text": "“I attempted to write my first novel when I was twenty-four. Bagger Vance[my first published book] came out when I was fifty-one.\n\n“Twenty-seven years is a long time to labor without success. Can you imagine how many times I was taken aside by spouse, lovers, family, and friends and given ‘the talk?’ Can you imagine how many times I gave it to myself?”\n\nSteve Pressfield (The Legend of Bagger Vance)\n\nMy Overnight Success\n\nThere’s no guarantee that if you plug way at writing for basically three decades that you’ll eventually not only become a published author, but also see your first published book turned into a movie starring Will Smith, Matt Damon, Chalize Theron and directed by Robert Redford—but it’s nice to point out when it happens.\n\nIn his post Pressfield expands on his “nearly three-decade odyssey” by offering some nuggets like:\n\n1. It’s hard.\n\n2. You gotta be a little crazy.\n\n3. It’s worth it.\n\nBut he also says that it wasn’t all wilderness;\n\n“Within those twenty-seven years, I earned a living for at least a dozen as a professional writer. I worked in advertising. I had a career as a screenwriter. And I spent six years writing unpublishable novels (which counts as work too.)\n\n“In other words the process, although it had many crazy and desperate years, was simply one of relentless, diligent labor and self-education. I was failing. But I was learning. By the time, twenty-seven years in, when I sat down to write The Legend of Bagger Vance, I was a seasoned pro who understood the principles of storytelling, who possessed abundant self-discipline, and who had had enough success in related fields to tackle this particular enterprise with confidence.”\n\nSteve Pressfield\n\nCheck out the full My Overnight Success article as well as his book The War of Art: Break Through the Blocks and Winn Your Innner Creative Battles.\n\nHappy New Year.\n\nRelated posts:\n\nBob DeRosa’s ‘Shortcuts’\n\nBeatles, Cody, King & 10,000 Hours\n\nTennessee Williams on ‘Apparent failure’\n\n‘Failure is an Option’\n\nAaron Sorkin on Failure\n\nOvernight Success—“It doesn’t seem that long ago I had hopes of being the hot kid, selling my first story in ’51 when I was 25. I got on the cover of Newsweek in April 1985, and was seen as an overnight success after little more than thirty years.”—Elmore Leonard\n\nSpectacular Failures\n\nP.S. Countdown to 2000th special post on January 22, 2015—11 posts\n\nScott W. Smith\n\nRead Full Post »\n\nEpiphany: A moment in which you suddenly see or understand something in a new or very clear way.\n\nMerriam-Webster definition\n\n“Inside each and every one of us is our one, true authentic swing. Something we was born with. Something that’s ours and ours alone. Something that can’t be learned… something that’s got to be remembered.”\n\nBagger Vance (Will Smith)\n\nThe Legend of Bagger Vance\n\nScreenplay by Indiana-born Jeremy Leven, from a novel by Trinidad-born Steve Pressfield\n\nThere’s a mystical side to golf where, along with various sand traps and water hazards, there are inner demons to battle. Since it’s Good Friday, I thought a scene from The Legend of Bagger Vance would be fitting*. (I think it was screenwriter Gary Ross who said Seabiscuit is not a sports film about victory but about life’s struggle. (Same could be said about Rocky and many other fine films)\n\nIn this Robert Redford directed scene, Will Smith helps golfer Matt Damon work through his inner and outer struggles.\n\nP.S. Steve Pressfield who wrote the novel The Legend of Bagger Vance: A Novel of Golf and the Game of Life is an avid golfer and counts screenwriting guru Robert McKee (Story) as his golfing buddy. He’s quoted as saying, “I’ve stolen concepts from Bob over and over and they’ve always worked. And he’s a pretty good golfer too.” He covers some of this ground in his book The War on Art.\n\nP.P.S. Bagger Vance screenwriter Jeremy Leven earned a graduate degree in Child Psychology from Harvard and was a fellow at Yale medical schools.\n\n* In the book Gita on the Green: The Mystical Tradition Behind Bagger Vance by Steve Rosen (and a forward by Steve Pressfield) writes that Bagger Vance was loosely based not after the Christian tradition of light, but the ancient Hindu spiritual poem Bhagavad-Gita. But Pressfield is also Jewish so maybe we can say Bagger Vance, like The Shawshank Redemption and Groundhog Day, is more ecumenical than dogmatic.\n\nRelated posts:\n\nWriting Quote #38 (Steve Pressfield)\n\n“More Light”\n\n‘Groundhog Day’ And Cheap Therapy\n\nScreenwriting Quote #171 (Garry Marshall) “Audiences like to watch characters whose lives change for the better.”Screenwriting and Slavery to Freedom\n\nScott W.
