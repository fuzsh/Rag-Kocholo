        "text": "These are the logo variations used throughout the years by 20th Century Studios (formerly Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation), with more to be added over time.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox Film Corporation\n\nWee Willie Winkie (1937) and Star! (1968):\n\nThe logo is in a sepia-tone.\n\nThe Robe (1953):\n\nKnown for being the first movie filmed in CinemaScope, this was the debut of the iconic 20th Century Fox \"CinemaScope\" logo. Here, the sky background is replaced with a red curtain backdrop.\n\nPrince Valiant (1953):\n\nInstead of the blue sky background, the CinemaScope credits are on a purple curtain background.\n\nThe Girl Can't Help It (1956):\n\nAs the film is CinemaScope and transforms from black and white into color in the opening scene, the 1935 logo is shown with re-orchestrated music.\n\nPeyton Place (1957):\n\nThe 1953 logo is in a shade of orange.\n\nWill Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (1957):\n\nTony Randall appears onscreen during the logo and, using a trumpet, a snare, and a bass, plays along to the fanfare. He said it was a clause in his contract to do this.\n\nSomething's Got to Give (1962):\n\nThe short version of the 1953 logo has a largely different and slower rendition of the short 1997 fanfare conducted by David Newman.\n\nCleopatra (1963, 2001 DVD):\n\nThe logo is tinted in amber and is in 3D. Only appears before the DVD menu.\n\nWhat a Way to Go! (1964):\n\nThe 1953 logo is tinted in raspberry pink, corresponding to Gene Kelly's character in the film. Also, the \"0\" is largely tilted.\n\nThose Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines (1965):\n\nThe opening shows a vaudeville-era curtain with a piano playing. As the 20th Century Fox drums start, the curtain lifts to show the black & white 1935 20th Century Fox logo. The pre-CinemaScope fanfare is played by the piano and an off-kilter trumpet. One of the last films to use the 1935 logo.\n\nBatman (1966):\n\nThe 1935 logo is used. On the Blu-ray release, the logo is cropped to widescreen.\n\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) and The Culpepper Cattle Co. (1972):\n\nThe logo is sepia-toned.\n\nThe French Connection (1971):\n\nThe logo begins in black-and-white and slowly fades in to color. Appears on the version currently streaming on Vudu. Also appears on TCM's prints of said movie.\n\nTogether Brothers (1974):\n\nThe 1935 logo is used again, but is silent.\n\nYoung Frankenstein (1974):\n\nThe logo is in black & white, in the style of the movie.\n\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975):\n\nThe fanfare is played on a piano. According to Richard O'Brien in the DVD commentary, the sequence originally was going to be normal, and the piano version of the fanfare was to be played at the movie's climax, just before Frankie started singing \"Wild and Untamed Thing\".\n\nThe Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother (1975):\n\nThe 1935 logo is used once more.\n\nAt Long Last Love (1975):\n\nOnce again, the 1935 logo is used, but it seems to be vaguely flashing through different colors.\n\nSilent Movie (1976):\n\nThe 20th Century Fox logo is seen about a minute into the movie after the three main characters take the pregnant woman in the car with them; the camera pans, and a 20th Century Fox billboard is seen, but the letter \"O\" seems to be coming out at the audience, and from it comes a red screen and the opening credits begin.\n\nAll This and World War II (1976):\n\nFollowing a series of old 1940s Fox press video clips of various stars and executives supporting the studio and film, the 1935 logo tinted in blue appears for only a second, then fades out to show the word \"PRESENTS\" in white on a black background. Also, the opening drum roll of the fanfare segues into the opening music of the film.\n\nStar Wars: Episodes IV-VI (1977-1983):\n\nThe 1953 logo fades out to bring the Lucasfilm logo. Later releases use the 1996 Lucasfilm logo and/or the 1994 TCF logo. The Disney+/4K prints use the 2015 Lucasfilm logo while the 1994 TCF logo is bylineless. Both of which are slated below.\n\nThe World's Greatest Lover (1977):\n\nNormal 1953 Fox logo, but the fanfare is a 1920s-style rendition.\n\nQuintet (1979):\n\nThe logo fades to a white snowstorm, starting the film.\n\nHealth (1980):\n\nNormal 1953 Fox logo, but an extra drumroll is added after the usual roll. Instead of the fanfare, the opening song is used. The logo cuts to the opening scene, rather than fading out.\n\nThe Cannonball Run (1981):\n\nThe 1953 logo begins as usual, but then a searchlight is taken out, causing the music to wind down to a stop. Police sirens and car engines are then heard. Another searchlight is taken out, and an animated Ferrari colored red appears. It makes itself into the \"0\" while the cop takes out the last three searchlights. The police car crashes into the searchlight on the right. The Ferrari comes out of the \"0\", honks, and laughs in a Burt Reynolds fashion. This logo is usually edited out of television airings. The 1953 logo also looks different than its original design (most likely because this variation was designed by Hal Needham, the director of the movie, and not Rocky Longo). This logo was reused for 20th Century Fox Records discs.\n\nChariots of Fire (1981, Non-USA):\n\nThe 1953 logo is zoomed in and silent. This has so far has been seen on recent SKY TV and Fox Classics airings, along with some Blu-ray prints; all other prints have had the 1994 logo plastered over. US prints seem to use The Ladd Company logo.\n\nJohnny Dangerously (1984):\n\nWhen the fanfare finishes, the logo freezes and turns into a picture of colorful shapes that form the 1981 logo.\n\nRevenge of the Nerds (1984):\n\nIn an homage to Star Wars, the 1953 logo (newer prints have it plastered with the 1981 logo, however) fades to black after ten seconds, but the 1981 fanfare continues playing as the screen fades into the film's logo, seen on a black background, over which the fanfare finishes.\n\nThe Sicilian (1987):\n\nThe 1981 logo is in black and white with a shade of ice blue.\n\nDie Hard franchise:\n\nDie Hard (1988): The logo is tinted in dodger blue, put on a space background, and is in 3D. Only appears before the DVD menu.\n\nOn the Blu-ray, DVD, Laserdisc and VHS widescreen releases, the 4:3 version of the logo is stretched. The 1995 Laserdisc and the 1999/2001 DVD use the standard logo widescreen 2:35.1.\n\nDie Hard 2 (1990): Same as the first movie, but it's snowing on the logo and the logo is in 3D. This appears only before the DVD menu.\n\nSame as the original film, only seen on the Laserdisc and VHS widescreen and Soviet/Russian theatrical release, while the 1999/2001 DVD also uses the standard logo widescreen 2:35.1.\n\nDie Hard With a Vengeance (1995): The logo is a bright gold color and appears in 3D. Only appears before the DVD menu.\n\nLive Free or Die Hard (2007): The logo glitches and the searchlights go out due to a power outage.\n\nThe Abyss (1989):\n\nThe logo is heavily cropped. The film was shot in Super 35, a process that created a widescreen image by cropping the top and bottom portions of the frame. Thus, the pan-and-scan version looks normal.\n\nThe ending uses the Fox print logo used in the 1980s and intermittently in the early 1990s.\n\nEdward Scissorhands (1990):\n\nSnow is falling on the 1981 logo, in keeping with Edward creating snow in the film. The structure is also covered with snow. Also, it's tinted in a steel blue color. Instead of the trademark 20th Century Fox fanfare, there is haunting, yet fairy tale-like music in the background. On 4:3 full-screen prints, along with the film itself, it is open matted.\n\nYoung Guns II (1990):\n\nThe 1953 logo is used with the 1979 fanfare. Only seen on the CBS/FOX/Fox Video VHS releases. Theatrical prints as well as the widescreen Laserdisc release use the standard logo of the time with long fanfare. Current prints edit the logo out.\n\nNaked Lunch (1991):\n\nExactly the same as Young Guns II (home video release only).\n\nPoint Break (1991):\n\nSame as The Abyss, but this time, the logo starts its animation when it fades in, and then freezes when it's about to fade out. On 4:3 full-screen prints, along with the film itself, it is open matted.\n\nWhite Men Can't Jump (1992):\n\nStandard 1981 Fox logo, but the fanfare is in a \"funk/rap\" style which segues into the opening theme of the movie.\n\nThe Alien series:\n\nAlien³ (1992): The fanfare is re-orchestrated by Elliot Goldenthal (the film's composer) but it freezes when it nearly finishes, complete with bending strings and wailing French horns until the fanfare finishes with a crash, seguing into the opening title. (This variation can be heard on the soundtrack album for Predator.)\n\nAliens: Colonial Marines (2013, video game): The 2009 prototype logo is zoomed out further than usual.\n\nAlien: Isolation (2014, video game): The 1981 logo is used with a retro tape effect and the 1935 fanfare logo is heard. When the logo is finished, it flickers out like an old TV.\n\nPrometheus (2012): The logo has a blue tint, reflecting the film's color palette.\n\nAlien: Covenant (2017): The logo is in a shade of dark blue-gray.\n\nAlien: Romulus (2024, as 20th Century Studios): The logo plays normally, but just as it finishes animating, the 1997 fanfare \"freezes\" like the Alien³ variant. It then glitches and gains a green tint, before wiping away to the right a few seconds later.\n\nMiracle on 34th Street (1994):\n\nThe 1994 logo is in a shade of red and is zoomed-out more than usual (less-than open-matte) and jingle bell sounds are heard at the end of the logo.\n\nSpeed films\n\nSpeed (1994): The logo is tinted blue and seen on the television at Howard Payne's mansion, and zooming in through the \"0\". Only appears before the DVD menu.\n\nThe behind-the-scenes featurette has the logo is zoomed in faster than usual.\n\nSpeed 2: Cruise Control (1997): The fanfare is re-orchestrated by Mark Mancina (the film's composer; he later composed the 2006 Disney fanfare) and after it finishes, the logo is swept away by water, segueing into the opening scene of the movie. It is also the first part of the first track of the film's score soundtrack as \"Twentieth Century Fox Fanfare / Motorbike Chase\".\n\nFar from Home: The Adventures of Yellow Dog (1995):\n\nThe logo has a tawny tint.\n\nFox Power Rangers films:\n\nMighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie (1995): The logo's 1994 fanfare is out-of-sync.\n\nTurbo: A Power Rangers Movie (1997): The logo has a golden tint, just like Volcano.\n\nBraveheart (1995, International release) and The Legend of Bagger Vance (2000, US release):\n\nThe opening theme of the movie is used instead of the fanfare.\n\n20th Century Fox: The First 50 Years (1997, 20th Television)\n\nBy the end of the program, the logo is bylineless. At the end of the logo, a searchlight brightens as it transitions to the end credits.\n\nStar Wars: Episodes IV-III (1997-2005; Special Edition (Episodes IV-VI) and 2019 Disney+ release):\n\nThe 1994 logo is already in its position. Only seen on the original releases. The 1994 logo is bylineless in the Disney+/4K prints. In the 2015 digital release of the films, the 1994 logo with the News Corporation byline is removed, except for Episode IV, as 20th Century Fox holds distribution of the film at the time. Just like the original trilogy, the logo fades out to reveal the 1996 Lucasfilm logo. In the Disney+/4K prints, it fades out to the 2015 Lucasfilm logo. It is also the first track of the 2004 version of the score soundtrack for the original trilogy as \"20th Century Fox Fanfare\". According to the soundtrack, Alfred Newman (the original composer of the fanfare) was credited.\n\nVolcano (1997):\n\nThe Fox logo moves up until the screen is black and the credits start. The logo also has a golden tint to it.\n\nAnastasia (1997)\n\nFirst film to use the 1997 fanfare. The fanfare is different than it is currently.\n\nBulworth (1998):\n\nThe logo's fanfare is out-of-sync.\n\nHow Stella Got Her Groove Back (1998):\n\nThe 1994 logo is in a shade of orange.\n\nEver After: A Cinderella Story (1998):\n\nExactly like on Miracle on 34th Street, but the logo is in a shade of brown. It also uses the fanfare from Anastasia.\n\nDrive Me Crazy (1999):\n\nThe 1994 logo is in a shade of vermilion.\n\nFox Studios Australia Promotional Videos (2000s):\n\nA series of videos promoting Fox Studios Australia features its own version of the 1994 Fox logo animation: The structure now reads \"FOX STUDIOS AUSTRALIA\" and the Los Angeles cityscape is replaced with the skyline of Sydney, Australia.\n\nMen of Honor (2000):\n\nExactly like on Miracle on 34th Street, but the logo is zoomed out way further than usual (open-matte) and is in a shade of metallic gold.\n\nDigimon: The Movie (2000):\n\nThe logo is tinted dark blue.\n\nX-Men film series: In all the logo variants, the X in the logo stays for a brief moment after the logo has faded out. This version makes an appearance on Mon incroyable fiance, the French version of My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance.\n\nX-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009, video game and movie trailer): The logo is made of adamantium (the indestructible metal that covers Wolverine's entire skeleton in the comics).\n\nX-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) and X-Men: Apocalypse (2016): Same as the variant used in the first three X-Men films, but with the 2009 logo instead. Also, part of the X-Men theme is heard at the end of the fanfare.\n\nX-Men: Dark Phoenix (2019): Once the logo reaches its final position, the \"X\" in \"FOX\" turns molten red and the background gets darker.\n\nFrom Hell (2001, DVD):\n\nThe logo plays as normal, but after several seconds, the logo turns sepia, animates in reverse and speeds up. Only appears before the DVD menu.\n\nMoulin Rouge (2001):\n\nFootage of the Fox logo plays on screen in a concert hall behind draped red curtains. There is a conductor on stage is conducting the orchestra playing the fanfare, which can be seen below the stage. The orchestra's warmup and the audience's applause sounds for when the conductor arrives on stage, as well as the conductor's baton being tapped three times, are heard before the fanfare.\n\nPlanet of the Apes (2001):\n\nThe background in the logo changes to space and the Fox structure slowly fades into the opening sequence. Also, the logo is pushed to the left and has a large green-yellow tint.\n\nDr. Dolittle 2 (2001):\n\nThe logo is in international Klein blue. On small widescreen prints, the logo is in 16:9 open matte.\n\nIce Age film series:\n\nIce Age (2002): The logo is stretched out and snowing sounds are heard at the end of the logo, segueing into the opening scene. On 35mm uncropped film scan prints, the logo is zoomed out further than usual (open-matte).\n\nIce Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (2009, 3-D): The logo is carved out of stone, with snow topping above it among a prehistoric backdrop, surrounded by snow-covered pine trees. A volcano pit replaces the \"stage\", and the searchlights are replaced with an assortment of smoke-spewing geysers. This variant is only seen on the 3D version; the 2D version uses the regular 1994 logo instead. However, it is seen on the 2010 Blu-ray 3D release, as well as the 2009 TrioScopics 3D DVD release. This was done by Blue Sky Studios, who would later animate the 2009 logo.\n\nAn earlier prototype version existed on Dave Strick's earliest demo reel. Here, the logo is bylineless, the lighting is largely different, and wireframes appear when the passing light is seen.\n\nMinority Report (2002):\n\nThe 20th Century Fox logo and the DreamWorks Pictures logo take place in underwater scenery.\n\nPhone Booth (2003):\n\nThe logo fades into a mist of clouds.

Only appears before the DVD menu.\n\nDown with Love (2003):\n\nSame as Young Guns II and Naked Lunch, but with the News Corporation byline and 1997 fanfare. It fades to the CinemaScope logo.\n\nThe film was shot with Panavision optics but used the credit as a throwback to the 1950s-60s films it references.\n\nThe Day After Tomorrow (2004):\n\nThe logo turns lapis lazuli blue and a thunderstorm appears in the background.\n\nKingdom of Heaven (2005):\n\nThe logo is tinted in dark yellow-ochre.\n\nElektra (2005):\n\nAfter the sunflash, the logo turns black-and-white, which appear darker and contrasted.\n\nIt's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (2005-):\n\nThe logo is seen in a theater, but the 2nd part of the logo stops abruptly due to a dangerous threat in the theater. Seen only on Thunder Gun Express.\n\nFantastic Four original film series:\n\nFantastic Four (2005): When the logo finishes, the logo turns red and fades to the 2002 Marvel logo (much akin to the Lionsgate and Columbia Pictures film The Punisher).\n\nFantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer (2007): Exactly like the first film, but the fanfare plays at the end while the logo turns blue when the flipbook page appears. On small widescreen prints, the logo is cropped to 16:9.\n\nGarfield: A Tale of Two Kitties (2006):\n\nWhen the logo finishes, it turns red as the camera zooms out to show it on a flag.

A choir can be also heard during the fanfare's second half, continuing into the opening scene.\n\nThe Simpsons Movie (2007):\n\nThe movie itself is the first one with the brighter enhanced version of the 20th Century Fox logo. Here, Ralph Wiggum (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) walks out of the \"0\" in \"20th\" and sings along to the second half of the fanfare. The logo then turns black and white as the camera pans up to the moon. Also, the logo is cropped to 16:9 aspect ratio to match the prologue. The animation for Ralph is done by 20th Century Animation.\n\nThe Seeker (2007):\n\nThe logo plays normally until the end, when it turns selective yellow. A pair of swirls, representing the first sign, appear in the sky.\n\nKrabat (2008, Germany):\n\nWhen the animation finishes, the logo turns stormy as several crows pass over. The 1994 fanfare is also used.\n\nWhat Happens in Vegas (2008):\n\n“Grace Kelly” by MIKA is heard at the end of the fanfare, which segues into the Regency Enterprises logo.\n\nKanikuly Strogogo Rezhima (aka High Security Vacation) (2009, Russia):\n\nThe logo plays as normal, but the fanfare is out-of-sync. When the camera passes the middle searchlight, the whole logo turns into a Chinese-styled painting that quickly disappears into dust, transitioning into the Channel One logo as the fanfare fades out.\n\nMy Name Is Khan (2010, international):\n\nThe 2009 logo plays, but it appears to be darker and also cuts to black instead of fading out. This logo only appeared in international releases, but the Fox Searchlight Pictures logo only appears in US releases.\n\nDiary of a Wimpy Kid film series:\n\nDiary of a Wimpy Kid (2010): The 75th Anniversary variant of the 2009 logo plays as usual, but when it finishes, it transforms into a paper sheet drawing. The camera pans back down to the structure (which is seen from the front) before zooming out to reveal the logo on the cover of Greg Heffley's diary. Also, the News Corporation byline and the word \"CENTURY\" are written in Greg's handwriting.\n\nDiary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules (2011): The 2009 logo plays as normal, but with a large orange tint. At the end, it turns into a paper sheet drawing before the camera pans downwards.\n\nDiary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days (2012): Same as Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules, but this time a paint splash effect is seen before the logo turns into a drawing. A beach ball flies in front of the camera as it pans downwards.\n\nDiary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (2017): As the fanfare ends, a paper drawing of the logo (this time appearing to have been cut out from a sheet of paper) flips in from the bottom of the screen as several notecards cover the background, followed by the camera panning downward.\n\nMarmaduke (2010):\n\nOn the DVD bonus feature \"Canine Casting\", the last four notes of the extended version of the 1950s 20th Century Fox fanfare that was used during the CinemaScope era are heard.\n\nPredators (2010): On all five character video profiles for the movie, the 1994 logo is tinted in blood red. Joy Ride 3: Roadkill (2014):\n\nThe 1994 logo is used with the 1997 Anastasia fanfare.\n\nRio 2 (2014):\n\nThe logo's fanfare is redone in a Samba style by John Powell (the film's composer). This theme is also the first track of the film's original score, titled \"20th Century Fox Fanfare (Rio 2 Samba Version)\". According to the soundtrack, Alfred Newman (the original composer of the fanfare) was credited.\n\nThe Fault in Our Stars (2014):\n\nThe logo is seen at nighttime, and when it finishes, the camera pans up towards a starry night sky, a la the variant for The Simpsons Movie.\n\nGone Girl (2014):\n\nThe logo is cut short and ends before the animation is even complete. Also, the logo is in a darker tint.\n\nThe Book of Life (2014, Unused):\n\nA mariachi band rendition of the fanfare is heard, composed by Gustavo Santaolalla. The \"0\" in 20th is replaced by a skull, the logo is set in Mexico and a graveyard, and the searchlights are replaced by candles. This was supposed to appear on the film itself, but the normal logo and fanfare were used instead. The fanfare, which was not found in the soundtrack, can be heard here.\n\nFantastic Four (2015):\n\nIn a similar vein to the X-Men film series, the '\"F\" stays for a brief moment after the logo fades out.\n\nAloha (2015, International release):\n\nThe 1953 logo is used (same as Young Guns II and Naked Lunch). Only seen on international prints.\n\nBridge of Spies (2015):\n\nOn US prints, the logo is sped up and silent. On international prints, the logo and fanfare are sped up for the second half.\n\nJoy (2015):\n\nThe short version of the Fox fanfare is used before abruptly cutting into the background music.\n\nThe Peanuts Movie (2015):\n\nThe 2009 logo plays as usual, albeit in open-matte, but after the opening drums are played, a piano rendition of the fanfare is played, backed with a re-arranged version of the drum track of the normal fanfare, based on the 1994 fanfare, which is later revealed to be performed by Schroeder on his toy piano, sitting in front of the podium, as the logo finishes turning into its position. There is no registered trademark symbol here (later removed in 2021). Just like the regular logo, the animation of Schroeder was done by Blue Sky Studios.\n\nIndependence Day: Resurgence (2016):\n\nThe logo turns blue-tinted.\n\nA Cure for Wellness (2016):\n\nSame as Gone Girl, just largely darker.\n\nLogan (2017):\n\nExactly the same as Down with Love, but without the registered trademark symbol or News Corporation byline, and the logo is now in black and white. Appears only on the Noir edition.\n\nWar for the Planet of the Apes (2017):\n\nThe fanfare is played in an ominous tribal manner.\n\nCondorito: The Movie (2017, Chile):\n\nA rose petal flies in once the logo forms. Condorito, one of the characters of the film, walks in for the remainder of the logo, picks the petal and walks away once the camera moves to its normal position.\n\nThe Greatest Showman (2017):\n\nTwo versions of the logo are used. First, there is the 1953 logo with the shortened 1997 fanfare from the final 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment logo. Then, there is the 2009 logo in black and white and at double speed with the film's opening song (\"The Greatest Show\") is heard.\n\nUnsane (2018):\n\nExactly the same as Independence Day: Resurgence, but the sky is darker and is cropped to 4:3.\n\nThe Flip Side (2018):\n\nThe fanfare is played on a xylophone.\n\nBohemian Rhapsody (2018):\n\nThe fanfare is played on an electric guitar, performed by Queen guitarist Brian May, while the drums are performed by Queen drummer Roger Taylor. During the drumroll, the drumroll from the 1954 fanfare can be heard. Also, the logo has a pale orangish tint to it and stays on-screen a bit longer than usual before fading out. The fanfare is also the first track of the soundtrack as \"20th Century Fox Fanfare\". According to the soundtrack, Alfred Newman (the original composer of the fanfare) was credited. On widescreen prints, it is cropped to 16:9.\n\nAlita: Battle Angel (2019):\n\nThe logo plays as normal until the end, when two searchlights swoop across the screen (a la the 1994-2010 logo), turning the structure into a dilapidated version in the future reading \"26th CENTURY FOX\".\n\nThe Balkan Line (2019, Russia):\n\nSame as Braveheart and The Legend of Bagger Vance, but with the 2013 logo instead. Once the registered trademark symbol fades in, the logo cross-fades into the Russia-1 logo.\n\nTerminator: Dark Fate (2019):\n\nDomestic/International: The logo plays as usual, but is largely speed-up and filtered in VHS quality. It glitches to the 1981 logo that is in cyan for a moment before reverting back to its usual colors. Then it glitches more to the interview footage from Terminator 2: Judgement Day. This also applies to the following 3 logos (Skydance, Paramount Pictures and Tencent Pictures).\n\n20th Century Studios\n\nThe Last Duel (2021):\n\nThe logo is dimmed to match the lighting of the rest of the film.\n\nThe Bob's Burgers Movie (2022):\n\nThe fanfare is played on a ukulele, with most of the second half played on Gene's keyboard along with laser sounds and fart noises from his megaphone. The drums at the beginning remain normal as usual.\n\nDarby and the Dead (2022, Hulu):\n\nThe logo is brighter than usual.\n\nBarbarian (2022):\n\nThe logo has a very large orange tint.\n\nBoston Strangler (2023, Hulu):\n\nThe logo is darker than usual and desaturated.\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine (2024):"
