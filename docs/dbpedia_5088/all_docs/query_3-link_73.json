        "text": "The Legend of Bagger Vance on Blu-ray\n\nDirector Robert Redford's lyrical look at salvation and sand traps stars Matt Damon as Rannulph Junuh, a former pro golfer in 1920s Georgia. Unable to play since being traumatized in World War I, Rannulph agrees to take part in a tournament to save his old flame's (Charlize Theron) resort and receives advice that changes his game-and his life-from guru-like caddy Bagger Vance (Will Smith). With J. Michael Moncrief, Bruce McGill, and an unbilled Jack Lemmon narrating. 126 min. Widescreen; Soundtracks: English Dolby True HD 5.1, French Dolby Digital stereo; Subtitles: English (SDH), French; featurette; theatrical trailer."
