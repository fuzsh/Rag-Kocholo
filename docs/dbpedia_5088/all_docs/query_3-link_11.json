        "text": "Have you seenThe Legend of Bagger Vance?The film was released in 2000 and was not a box office success.I must admit that I had not seen it until recently.I saw it on a list of films that life coaches should watch, so I found it on Amazon and watched it with my wife a couple of weeks ago.\n\nA sports fantasy, The Legend of Bagger Vancewas directed by Robert Redford and starred Will Smith, Matt Damon, and Charlize Theron. Although it was generally panned by critics, the theme of redemption through finding encouragement, focus, and purpose fits well with the coaching paradigm.\n\nThe film is told through the eyes of Hardy Greaves. Played by Jack Lemon as an old man, Greaves’ heart attack on a golf course provides the bookends of the story. As he lies on the grass, he thinks back to his experiences with Bagger Vance (Smith) and Rannulph Junuh (Damon) when he was a youngster (J. Michael Moncrief).\n\nA beloved son of Savannah, Georgia, and a competitive golfer, Junuh leaves all this and his girlfriend, Adele Invergordon (Theron), behind to serve in World War One. His company is wiped out with Junuh as the sole survivor. Although he wins the Medal of Honor for his personal bravery, Junuh fails to return home after the war. He finally turns up years later as an alcoholic and gambler without a purpose in life, considering himself a failure.\n\nTo move quickly through the plot, Adele’s father has died leaving the resort and golf course he developed to go under due to the Depression. In an effort to save her family fortune, she sets up a celebrity golf exhibition featuring two of the best players of the day, Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen. With young Greaves’ encouragement, Adele reaches out to Junuh to play and build local support. This is when Bagger Vance shows up and offers to be Junuh’s caddie.\n\nVance models great coaching techniques. He wants his client/golfer to succeed, but Junuh’s success is not up to Vance. He is encouraging but challenges his client/golfer when necessary. Vance stands back and allows Junuh to make mistakes and learn from them. When Junuh hits a ball into the woods and the stress of the moment brings on a battlefield flashback, the focus that Vance has taught him brings him back into the game to make a seemingly impossible shot.\n\nOf course, the movie is a fantasy like Field of Dreams(1989). The point is not to be accurate or realistic, but to share an idea. Although Rannulph and Adele must be in their late thirties in the film, they look like college students. Vance mysteriously appears and then disappears when his work is done. He also shows up unexpectedly at the end of the film as Greaves is dying.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, the plot is loosely based on the Hindu sacred text, the Bhagavad Gita, where the Warrior/Hero Arjuna(R. Junuh) refuses to fight. The god Krishna appears as Bhagavan (Bagger Vance) to help him to follow his path as the warrior and hero that he was meant to be. Building on this account, the film’s story is meant to be mythical with a deeper meaning than one might perceive on the surface.\n\nOn an emotional level, the film is uplifting. On an intellectual level, it requires one to leave a sense of reality behind. The viewer knows how it will end, but Junuh’s struggle for redemption and the interplay with Vance is fun to watch.\n\nWill this make someone’s list of all-time greats? Probably not, but the film reminds us that redemption is available when we find encouragement and purpose in our lives.\n\nLabels\n\nI am grateful for my heritage as a Southern Baptist. I was exposed to the Bible and worship from a very young age. I grew up in a church in south Alabama that supported the Cooperative Program of missions giving. This meant that our church had the benefit of being part of a supportive group of local churches and the educational opportunities that afforded. Our state convention provided varied and effective ministries with groups like orphans, ethnic groups, and college students. We supported missionaries at home and abroad. We had good Bible study and training literature (which we paid for, of course). I went to an accredited seminary and paid a remarkably low tuition. Wherever you went on a Sunday morning (in the Southeast and Southwest, at least), you could find a church that sang the familiar hymns and studied the same Bible lesson. In hindsight, I realize that this Southern Baptist utopia was imperfect. There were significant theological differences, often geograp\n\nAs I read the story of the Good Samaritan during my devotional today, I was reminded of the times that I have heard the story in the Christian education setting of the local church--as a youngster in primary and intermediate classes (old terminology), as a young adult in college classes, and then as an adult, often teaching the passage myself. The characters and story line are very familiar due to these experiences of Christian education. These are challenging times for Christian education in the church. Like so much of what is happening in the church today, the old forms do not seem to support present needs. What once worked no longer seems to be effective. Christian education or the formation of believers is in a state of flux. In an article on ethicsdaily.com , retired professor Colin Harris addresses this issue. He points out that the period of the 60’s and 70’s “saw the beginnings of a loss of vitality within the educational dimension of church ministry, as the\n\nIn a recent blog , consultant Seth Godin addresses the power of metaphor. He points out, “The best way to learn a complex idea is to find it living inside something else you already understand.” In other words, “this” is like “that.” “When you see a story, an example, a wonderment,” says Godin, “take a moment to look for the metaphor inside.” Jesus turned this around. In the use of parables, he told a story or provided a metaphor and challenged his hearers to see the truth within. For example, in his teaching on the Kingdom (or Reign) of God in Matthew’s Gospel, Jesus compares the Kingdom to such things as a mustard seed, yeast, a hidden treasure, a net, a king, and a landowner. His hearers are encouraged to use their imaginations to understand something that they had never experienced. He also attempted to shift their perspective so that they might see signs of the Kingdom breaking into their present reality. These are metaphors for the Kingdom.

On the eve of the Global Leadership Summit, a worldwide conference sponsored by the church in cooperation with the Willow Creek Association, church leadership imploded as a result of further allegations against former pastor Bill Hybels. Last year, Hybels introduced the team who would assume church leadership upon his retirement--lead pastor Heather Larson and teaching pastor Steve Carter. Although the founding pastor planned to stay on to assist in a time of transition, reports of sexual impropriety involving Hybels surfaced early this year. He accelerated his departure from the church and left the board of the Willow Creek Association. When other charges emerged last week, teaching pastor Carter resigned. On Wednesday evening, Larson and the entire elder board--lay leaders who provide accountability on behalf of the congreg\n\nCraig Groeschel, the founder and senior pastor of Life.Church. The Global Leadership Summit which began as a project of Willow Creek Community Church in South Barrington, Illinois, and its founding pastor, Bill Hybels, over 25 years ago was held this week without Hybels. For several years, the GLS has been now produced by the Willow Creek Association, a spin-off organization and a loose network of churches but Hybels has been its driving force. Attended by thousands at the church facility in South Barrington and broadcast to thousands more at satellite locations, the annual meeting brings together not only evangelical leaders but outstanding speakers from business, charitable organizations, politics, and business. For the first time, Hybels did not appear due to allegations of sexual impropriety brought against him over the past year by former employees, staff members, and business associates. He has already left the church and resigned from the board of the association."
