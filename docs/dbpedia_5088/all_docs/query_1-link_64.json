        "text": "It was announced today that the Walt Disney Company will be dropping the ‘Fox’ in 21st Century Fox, renaming the iconic studio “20th Century Studios”. Similarly, ‘Fox Searchlight Pictures’ will become ‘Searchlight Pictures’. At this time Disney has not made decisions about 20th Century Fox Television or Fox 21 Television Studios, but discussions about the names are underway as reported by Variety.\n\nDisney’s acquisition of the iconic studio last March (at $71.3 billion) made the eventual rebranding inevitable according to insiders. The purchase included the 20th Century Fox film and television studios but not Fox News or the Fox broadcast network.\n\nDisney has already begun to phase out the ‘Fox’ name for its acquired properties, changing email addresses for Searchlight staff and replacing logos on forthcoming films. These include the Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Will Ferrell-starring Downhill, and the forthcoming family film Call of the Wild. Logos will be slightly changed, removing ‘Fox’ from logo marks but otherwise being predominantly the same.\n\n20th Century Fox was initially formed in a 1935 merger between Twentieth Century Pictures and Fox Film Corporation. Many of the most successful films of all time have been released under the 20th Century Fox banner, including Titanic, Avatar, Alien, Star Wars: A New Hope, and Home Alone. Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp bought 20th Century Fox in the mid-1980s along with a host of TV stations, forming the beginnings of what became Fox News (which launched in 1996).\n\nInsiders speculate that one reason for the name switch has to do with the associations between ‘Fox’ and Murdoch and his conservative news empire, the latter having a controversial reputation outside its target demographic. Adding to the controversy is a slate of sexual misconduct scandals, recently dramatized in the 2019 film Bombshell."
