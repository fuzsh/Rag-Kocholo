        "text": "Logo descriptions by Sean Beard, Matt Williams, Nicholas Aczel, Randomkid0627, and others.\n\nLogo captures by Eric S., wolfie14, userjt, 20thCenturyFoxLover, EnormousRat, Donny Pearson, filmbaza.net, Logos2010, and Mr.Logo\n\nThese are most of the logo variations seen throughout the years by 20th Century Fox.\n\nWee Willie Winkie (1937) andStar! (1968): The logo is in a sepia-tone.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe Robe (1953): The sky background is replaced with a curtain background. The Robe itself is 20th Century Fox's first Cinemascope movie\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe Girl Can't Help It (1956): As the film is CinemaScope and transforms from black and white into color in the opening scene, the 1935 logo is shown with re-orchestrated music.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nPeyton Place (1957): The 1953 logo is in a shade of orange.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nWill Success Spoil Rock Hunter? (1957): Tony Randall appears onscreen during the logo and, using a trumpet, a snare, and a bass, plays along to the fanfare.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nCleopatra (1963, 2001 DVD): The logo is tinted in amber and is in 3D. Only appears before the DVD menu.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nWhat a Way to Go! (1964): The 1953 logo is tinted in raspberry pink, corresponding to Gene Kelly's character in the film. Also, the \"0\" is slightly tilted.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThose Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines (1965): The opening shows a vaudeville-era curtain with a piano playing. As the 20th Century Fox drums start, the curtain lifts to show the black & white 1935 20th Century Fox logo. The pre-CinemaScope fanfare is played by the piano and an off-kilter trumpet. One of the last films to use the 1935 logo.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDeadfall (1968): The 1935 logo is used.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nButch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969): The logo is sepia-toned in the same style of the opening credits for the movie.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe French Connection (1971): The logo begins in black-and-white and slowly fades in to color. Appears on the version currently streaming on Vudu. Also appears on TCM's prints of said movie.\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________\n\nYoung Frankenstein (1974): The logo is in black & white, in the style of the movie.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975): The fanfare is played on a piano.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother (1975): The 1935 logo is used.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAt Long Last Love (1975): Again, the 1935 logo is used, but it seems to be vaguely flashing through different colors.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSilent Movie (1976): The 20th Century Fox logo is seen about a minute into the movie after the three main characters take the pregnant woman in the car with them; the camera pans, and a 20th Century Fox billboard is seen, but the letter \"O\" seems to be coming out at the audience, and from it comes a red screen and the opening credits begin.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nAll This and World War II (1976): Following a series of old 1940s Fox press video clips of various stars and executives supporting the studio and film, the 1935 logo tinted in blue appears for only a second, then fades out to show the word \"PRESENTS\" in white on a black background. Also, the opening drum roll of the fanfare segues into the opening music of the film.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe World's Greatest Lover (1977): Normal 1953 Fox logo, but the fanfare is a 1920s-style rendition.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHealth (1980): Normal 1953 Fox logo, but an extra drumroll is added after the usual roll. Instead of the fanfare, the opening song is used. The logo cuts to the opening scene, rather than fading out.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe Cannonball Run (1981): The 1953 logo begins as usual, but then a searchlight is taken out, causing the music to wind down to a stop. Police sirens and car engines are then heard. Another searchlight is taken out, and an animated Ferrari colored red appears. It makes itself into the \"0\" while the cop takes out the last three searchlights. Unexpectedly, the police car crashes into the searchlight on the right. The Ferrari comes out of the \"0\", honks, and laughs in a Burt Reynolds fashion. Sadly, this logo is usually edited out of television airings. The 1953 logo also looks a little different than its original design (most likely because this variation was designed by Hal Needham, the director of the movie, and not Rocky Longo).\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nChariots of Fire (1981, Non-USA): The 1953 logo is zoomed in and silent. This is very rare and so far has been seen on recent SKY TV and Fox Classics airings, along with some Blu-ray prints; all other prints have had the 1994 logo plastered over. While US Prints will most likey use the The Ladd Company logo.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nJohnny Dangerously (1984): When the fanfare finishes, the logo freezes and turns into a picture of colorful shapes that form the 1981 logo.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nRevenge of the Nerds (1984): In an obvious homage to Star Wars, the 1953 logo (newer prints have it plastered with the 1981 logo, however) fades to black after ten seconds, but the 1981 fanfare continues playing as we fade into the film's logo, seen on a black background, over which the fanfare finishes.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe Sicilian (1987): The 1981 logo is in black and white with a shade of ice blue._______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDie Hard (1988, DVD): The logo is tinted in dodger blue, put on a space background, and is in 3D. Only appears before the DVD menu.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThe Abyss (1989): The logo is heavily cropped. The film was shot in Super 35, a process that created a widescreen image by cropping the top and bottom portions of the frame. Thus, the pan-and-scan version looks normal.\n\nThe ending uses the Fox print logo used in the 1980s and intermittently in the early 1990s.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEdward Scissorhands (1990): Snow is falling on the 1981 logo. The structure is also covered with snow. Also, it's tinted in a steel blue color.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nYoung Guns II (1990): The 1953 logo is used with the 1979 fanfare.

Only seen on the trailer.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nBulworth (1998): The logo's fanfare is out-of-sync.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHow Stella Got Her Groove Back (1998): The 1994 logo is in a shade of orange.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nEver After: A Cinderella Story (1998): Exactly like on Miracle on 34th Street, but the logo is in a shade of brown.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDrive Me Crazy (1999): The 1994 logo is in a shade of vermilion.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nFox Studios Australia Promotional Videos (2000s): A series of videos promoting Fox Studios Australia features its own version of the 1994 Fox logo animation: The structure now reads \"FOX STUDIOS AUSTRALIA\" and the Los Angeles cityscape is replaced with the skyline of Sydney, Australia.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nMen of Honor (2000): Exactly like on Miracle on 34th Street, but the logo is zoomed out way further than usual and is in a shade of metallic gold.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nDigimon: The Movie (2000): The logo is tinted dark blue.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nX-Men (2000), X2: X-Men United (2003), and X-Men: The Last Stand (2006): On every X-Men film, the \"X\" in the Fox logo remains visible to the end although the rest of the logo has already faded out.\n\nOn trailers and TV spots for X-Men and on one theatrical trailer for X-Men: The Last Stand, the logo appears made out of metal as if water flowed along a window. Drops of blueish water leave gradually, and then the logo becomes clearer.\n\nOn the teaser trailer for X-Men: The Last Stand, the variant on Titan A.E. and Solaris is used.\n\nOn another theatrical trailer for X-Men: The Last Stand, the one seen on Miracle on 34th Street and Cheaper by the Dozen is used.\n\nOn TV spots for X-Men: The Last Stand, the logo is in lavender.\n\nOn the trailer for the X-Men Trilogy on Blu-ray, the logo is steel blue/ghost white and is on a stormy background.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________________\n\nFrom Hell (2001): The logo plays as normal, but after several seconds, the logo animates in reverse and speeds up.
