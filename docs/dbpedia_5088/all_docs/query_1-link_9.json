        "text": "Not to be confused with Twentieth Century Pictures.\n\nBackground\n\nIn 1935, Twentieth Century Pictures, Inc. and Fox Film Corporation merged to form Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation (the hyphen was dropped in 1984). During the Golden Age of Hollywood, 20th Century-Fox was one of the \"Big Five\" studios, alongside Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Paramount Pictures, RKO Radio Pictures, and Warner Bros. In 1981, the studio was sold to investors Marc Rich and Marvin Davis; however, Davis bought Rich's interest in 1984. A year later, the News Corporation purchased a 50% stake in the studio, followed by the remainder in the following years. In 1990, all of News Corporation's media and television holdings (including 20th Century Fox) were placed under Fox Entertainment Group, and floated on the stock exchange in 1998. In 2004, after News Corporation was reincorporated in the United States, they bought out the remainder of FEG. From 2013 to 2019, 20th Century Fox was a subsidiary of 21st Century Fox, which was formed when News Corporation split into two companies. As of January 2023, the studio's three most financially successful films are Avatar, released in 2009, its sequel Avatar: The Way of Water, released in 2022, and Titanic (under international rights), released in 1997 (all of which were directed by James Cameron). 20th Century Fox also has a specialty division named Fox Searchlight Pictures (currently known as Searchlight Pictures).\n\nOn December 14, 2017, the Walt Disney Company announced its plans to buy most of 21st Century Fox's assets, including 20th Century Fox.[1] The process was completed on March 20, 2019, with the last pre-Disney release from the studio being Alita: Battle Angel, released on February 14 of that year. The remaining assets Disney didn't acquire, notably the Fox network and Fox News, were spun off into a new company called Fox Corporation. On January 17, 2020, Disney announced that it would be dropping the word \"Fox\" from the studio's name (presumably to avoid confusion with Fox Corporation), along with Searchlight Pictures. Nevertheless, Disney continues to own perpetual rights to the 20th Century Fox name for the studio's legacy film library. However, the studio was still legally incorporated and traded as Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation until December 4, 2020. Since then, the company has been using 20th Century Studios, Inc. as copyright for 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures, while it has used 20th Television, Inc. as copyright for 20th Television productions under Disney. As of 2020, titles from 20th Century Studios and Searchlight Pictures are released internationally through Buena Vista International.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox Film Corporation\n\n1st Logo (November 8, 1935-September 11, 1968)\n\nVisuals: Same as the Twentieth Century Pictures, Inc. logo, except \"FOX\" appears in place of \"PICTURES, INC.\".\n\nAlternate Descriptive Video Transcription: Searchlights pierce a starry night sky, sweeping the clouds and illuminating a towering edifice in the form of \"20th CENTURY FOX\".\n\nTrivia: Like the original 20th Century Pictures logo, this was designed by Emil Kosa, Jr.,[2] who was also responsible for creating the Statue of Liberty matte shot in Planet of the Apes (1968).\n\nVariants:\n\nOn the 1942 Technicolor film The Black Swan, the logo is tinted in sepia.\n\nOn colorized prints, depending on how it was colorized, the logo would have different colors.\n\nThe logo would either take place against a day or night sky background.\n\nA Soviet version exists with the text in Russian. The text varies depending on the version. The 1941 version uses the text \"20 BEK ФOKС\". The 1950 version uses \"20Й ВЕК ФОКС США\". The 1952 version (of which a colored version exists) uses \"20-Й ВЕК ФОКС\". The 1948 version uses a black background and not the background with the structure and searchlights with the text \"ПРОИЗВОДСТВО XX ВЕК--ФОКС США\".\n\nFox Movietone News newsreels use a slightly altered version of the tower in the opening credits with \"presents\", in script, below it.\n\nFor early color releases (except for The Little Princess), the structure is sepia-toned, the left searchlights are pink, the right searchlights are yellow and blue, the \"stack\" is blue, the middle searchlights are green, and the sky is dark purple.\n\nOn the current print of Les Miserables, the logo fades into the National Telefilm Associates logo.\n\nOn the 2002 restoration of the 20th Century-Fox Hour, the \"0\" is more circular and has a bigger hole, and there are extra searchlights in front of the logo.\n\nClosing Titles: Superimposed on a special background or sometimes on the last scene of a movie, the words \"The End\" fade in (with the font varying depending on the movie) with the following text: \"Released through Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation\", \"Released by Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation\", \"Produced and Released by Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation\", or \"Produced and Distributed by Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation\".\n\nTechnique: The monument was created as a painting on several layers of glass, and the searchlights were traditionally animated frame-by-frame; this was done by the special effects department of the studio.\n\nAudio: A redone variant of the 20th Century Pictures fanfare once again composed and conducted by Alfred Newman.[3]\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn Love Under Fire, a different recording of the fanfare is heard.\n\nOn some films, it is silent or has the film's opening theme.\n\nOn some 20th Century Pictures films, such as one print of The Call of the Wild, the original TCP fanfare is heard due to sloppy plastering.\n\nZorba the Greek, one of the last films to use this logo, uses the first half of the 1953 CinemaScope fanfare.\n\nOn the 1994 Studio Classics VHS of Carmen Jones, the 1979 fanfare is heard, likely due to a reverse plastering error.\n\nOn Seven Arts TV prints, the CinemaScope extension fanfare that debuted with the next logo is used (the extension is heard over the Seven Arts logo).\n\nThe 20th Century Fox Hour uses that show's fanfare; a voice-over from Restoration of the 20th Century Fox Hour can be heard in the video.\n\nAvailability: It's still saved on just about every 20th Century Fox release from 1935 to 1968, with some exceptions.\n\nThe logo premiered on Metropolitan (released on November 8, 1935) and made its final regular appearance on Prudence and the Pill (released on May 23, 1968). It later made some appearances on Deadfall (1968), Together Brothers, At Long Last Love, The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother, and All This and World War II.\n\nThe logo first debuted in black and white, while it was introduced in color in 1936.\n\nThe color version can be seen on the 2007 DVD release of The Little Princess (1939; some public domain prints of the film use the next logo, while other prints use either the black-and-white version or no logo at all) and some colorized prints of Bright Eyes and Heidi, as well as some newer colorized prints of Miracle on 34th Street.\n\nSome current prints of films such as The Blue Bird (1940), Leave Her to Heaven, Forever Amber, and David and Bathsheba plaster this logo with the next one.\n\nThis was plastered by the 4th logo on an AMC airing of Young Mr. Lincoln from February 15, 1999.\n\nOlder television prints of Return of the Fly plaster the next logo with this one while retaining the CinemaScope fanfare, followed by the Seven Arts Television logo. This fanfare was sampled for The Weather Girls' 1982 track \"Success\".\n\nIt made an appearance at the start of an early 1990s Seven Network Australia airing of Conan the Barbarian (1982) in place of the 4th logo.\n\nLegacy: Alfred Newman's fanfare and the use of Art Deco architecture in the logo's design cement its reputation as one of the most beloved logos of all time.\n\n2nd Logo (September 16, 1953-December 11?, 1987)\n\nVisuals: A redrawn version of the previous logo, but the back of the structure now has a visible ending point, the \"0\" in \"20th\" is slanted at an angle and leans towards the right, the left searchlight is redesigned and sits higher atop its tower, and the two searchlights in front of the camera have been removed.\n\nTrivia:\n\nThis logo was designed by Pacific Title artist Rocky Longo, who also designed the next two logos. The \"0\" was slanted so it would fit within the new CinemaScope aspect ratio.\n\nThe extended CinemaScope fanfare has appeared on the two Star Wars score albums. Many other albums also carry this fanfare (albeit rearranged), and can be found on iTunes.\n\nIn December 1977, this logo was adapted as the label design of 20th Century-Fox Records, until the label was closed down in 1982.\n\nVariants:\n\n1953-1967: The searchlights are slimmed down, and the structure is placed in the center of the screen with a dark blue sky surrounding it.\n\n1957-1987: Like the slanted zero version of the CinemaScope logo, but without the snipe and fades out.\n\nThere is an extended version without the CinemaScope snipe, which only appeared on High Anxiety and 1981's History of the World, Part I.\n\n1968-1987: The structure and the sky background are off-center and shifted to the left. Starting in 1976 with The Omen, the registered trademark symbol (\"®\") was added to the bottom-right of the logo.\n\nA shorter version of this logo exists.\n\nOn older international prints of Chariots of Fire and Breaking Away (and on a recent TV airing of the former), the logo is zoomed in, as those films were shot in \"open matte\" and the logo was not adjusted for widescreen.\n\nSome pan-and-scan versions of widescreen films have certain colors filling in the empty black screen space. Some early 2000s HBO widescreen airings have a blue fill, while the 1992 Fox Video VHS of M*A*S*H has a green fill.\n\nOn a USA 16mm print of Star Wars, the logo, and the entire film, is cropped to 2.76:1.\n\nSnipes:\n\nCinemaScope: The logo fades to the text \"TWENTIETH CENTURY-FOX PRESENTS A CINEMASCOPE PRODUCTION/PICTURE\".\n\nFrench Cinemascope snipe: On a French airing of Journey to the Center of the Earth, a French print of the movie is used, with the snipe reading: \"20th Century-Fox présente\" and \"UN FILM CinemaScope\".\n\nSoviet Russian snipe: On a 35mm Soviet release of The 300 Spartans, the Cinemascope snipe is replaced by a blue background with white Russian text reading \"ПРОИЗВОДСТВО 20-Й ВЕК ФОКС США\", which translates to \"PRODUCTION OF 20TH CENTURY FOX USA\".\n\nTechnique: The monument was created as a painting on several layers of glass, and the searchlights were traditionally animated frame-by-frame; once again, this was done by the special effects department of the studio.\n\nAudio:\n\nNovember 5, 1953-1960: The 1953 recording of the original fanfare, which debuted on How to Marry a Millionaire.\n\nApril 30, 1954-1967: The original fanfare is extended for CinemaScope. After the point the original fanfare would've stopped, four ascending string notes play, followed by four horn notes. This repeats twice before ending in a majestic flourish. This version was once again conducted by Alfred Newman, and debuted on River of No Return. After CinemaScope was dropped in 1967, the 1935 fanfare was only used from this point on, until the CinemaScope extension returned on Star Wars in 1977.[4]\n\nMarch 9, 1960: A different recording of the original fanfare, conducted by Nelson Riddle, debuted on Can-Can.\n\n1965-October 31, 1981: The 1935 recording of the original fanfare.\n\nDecember 21, 1979?-December 11, 1987: A rearranged version of the 1935 fanfare. The earliest known film to have used this fanfare is believed to be Scavenger Hunt. This arrangement is used on the next logo.\n\nMay 21, 1980: A new recording of the CinemaScope fanfare, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra and conducted by John Williams, which was used on The Empire Strikes Back.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nIn other cases, the logo is silent or has the movie's opening theme.\n\nMarilyn Monroe's final and unfinished project Something's Got to Give has the short, slower version of the 1997 fanfare conducted by David Newman. The film can be found as a bonus feature on The Seven Year Itch special edition DVD, and as the last third of the AMC documentary Marilyn: The Final Days. Pre-discovered prints probably didn't have a fanfare at all.\n\nAn abridged version of the 1962 variant of the 1954 CinemaScope fanfare. This can be heard on a few films such as Fire Sale, Damien: Omen II, Brubaker, Fatso, Willie & Phil, Magic (1978), and the TV movies Miracle on 34th Street (1973), Good Against Evil, and The Diary of Anne Frank (1980).\n\nAround 1962, the fanfare was slightly modified with reverb and chorus effects. Though, the regular version was still used until 1967. This would also be used on Star Wars and High Anxiety, both released in 1977.\n\nHistory of the World, Part I has a different arrangement of the CinemaScope fanfare by John Morris.\n\nThere are lower-pitched versions of the 1935 and 1954 CinemaScope fanfares that exist on some films.\n\nOlder prints of The Call of the Wild (1935) use the 20th Century Pictures fanfare.\n\nRecent prints of The Roots of Heaven have the 1994 fanfare play over the CinemaScope variant.\n\nThe original 1977 Magnetic Video release of Fantastic Voyage has the opening flourish of the Magnetic Video music mistakenly play during the first half of the fanfare.\n\nNetflix prints of French Connection II use an abridged recording of the CinemaScope extension from The Empire Strikes Back (1999 arrangement).\n\nThe VHS release of Young Guns II has this logo with the 1979 music playing over it instead.\n\nOn a Spanish copy of History of the World: Part I, this logo has the 1981 Gaumont fanfare due to poor plastering.\n\nOn a Swedish 16mm print of Star Wars (Stjärnornas krig), the second drum roll is repeated, cutting out the first.\n\nOn Damnation Alley, the second half of the CinemaScope fanfare is cut.\n\nAvailability: With some exceptions, this logo is seen on releases from Fox from the time-period starting with The Robe, and used in tandem with the first logo and the next-two logos.\n\nThis logo made its official debut with The Robe (released on September 16, 1953), the first motion picture filmed in CinemaScope. It allegedly made its final official appearance on Wall Street (released on December 11, 1987), but it remains unknown if it actually appeared on originally theatrical prints; all current prints of the film replace it with the 4th logo. Nonetheless, this logo is still retained on most Fox releases from this period.\n\nThe CinemaScope variants aren't usually subject to plastering; however, an early 2000s AMC print of Satan Never Sleeps plastered it with the 4th logo.\n\nHowever, it is still retained on DVD releases of the film and on one FMC airing.\n\nAmong the last films to use the CinemaScope variants in their original run were Von Ryan's Express, which was predominantly filmed in Panavision at the insistence of star Frank Sinatra, Fantastic Voyage, and the Flint films.\n\nThis logo is retained on the original theatrical versions of Star Wars and The Empire Strikes Back on their 2006 DVD releases, but is still plastered with the 4th logo on the remastered \"Special Edition\" versions.\n\nThe international version of Chariots of Fire also originally featured this logo, although the current UK DVD release plasters it with the 1994 logo. However, it was left intact on a recent Sky TV airing and on the Warner Blu-ray of the international version.\n\nThe original Key Video VHS releases of Moving Violation and Thunder and Lightning plaster this with the 4th logo; the former restored it on current prints and the Shout! Factory DVD release, but the latter plasters it while keeping the original abridged fanfare.\n\nSome releases of Alien and its director's cut plaster this with the 3rd logo, but it is still retained on the original 1981 VHS, the 1999 theatrical DVD, and the recent Blu-ray releases.\n\nThis logo can also be found some early-to-mid-1980s films of the era, such as The Cannonball Run (albeit as a variant), older video releases of Bill Cosby: Himself, the original CBS/Fox Video release of Revenge of the Nerds, the original Key Video VHS release of The Buddy System, Moving Violations, and the CBS/Fox VHS release of Project X (1987). It is also intact on older U.S. cable prints of Young Guns and older VHS copies of Young Guns II; however, the letterbox LaserDisc release of the latter film uses the 4th logo. Later home video/DVD releases and TV prints of these films plaster it with the either the 4th logo or those from another distributor.\n\nCurrent prints of Avalanche Express (which Warner Bros. acquired from Fox with its purchase of the Lorimar film library) plaster this with the 1998 WB logo, but it is still intact on the Spanish R2 DVD release. No logo appears at all on the Warner Home Video VHS release thereof.\n\nThis logo does not appar at all on Carmen Jones, The Girl Can't Help It, A Circle of Deception, The Longest Day, Zorba the Greek, Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines, The Cape Town Affair, The Day the Fish Came Out, Star!, Deadfall, Patton (some TV broadcasts spliced in a logo from another film), Tora! Tora! Tora!, Trouble Man, The Poseidon Adventure, U.S. prints of The Towering Inferno, At Long Last Love, The Adventure of Sherlock Holmes' Smarter Brother, Silent Movie, Prudence and the Pill, or All This and World War II.\n\nThe 1976 revision makes an appearance on the Criterion Collection Blu-ray release of Naked Lunch.\n\nThis logo can also be found on the Vestron VHS release of Fort Apache: The Bronx and on a Trifecta syndicated print of Oh Heavenly Dog! (which Paramount/Trifecta owns the television rights to via Mulberry Square Productions).\n\nSouthern Comfort was originally seen with the 1976 revision of this logo; it can be seen on some older European copies of the film, preceded by the Overseas Filmgroup logo.\n\nThe original Blay Video VHS release of Magic (1978) retains this logo, but not on the LaserDisc release; it's unknown if other releases of this film retain this logo.\n\nThis logo is also seen at the beginning of the original CBS/Fox VHS release of the M*A*S*H series finale, \"Goodbye, Farewell, and Amen\".\n\nThis logo might also be seen on theatrical German/Argentine prints of titles from Walt Disney Productions/Pictures and Touchstone, as Fox had distribution rights to Disney's output in most countries such as Germany and Argentina until 1987.\n\nThe audio from this logo also makes an appearance at the start of the launch trailer for the 2011 mobile game Angry Birds Rio.\n\nAdditionally, this logo precedes the Toho logo on Criterion prints of Akira Kurosawa's Kagemusha, and it is also seen on current international prints, but without the Toho logo.\n\nLegacy: It was often given the unofficial nickname of \"Slanted Zero\" thanks to its intended design. Some have seen the zero in the logo as off-putting, though more have seen this logo in a more favorable light for its design and extended fanfare.\n\n3rd Logo (February 16, 1956-December 12, 1967)\n\nVisuals: A redrawn version of the last logo. The \"0\" is straightened and the typeface is significantly altered compared to previous and future logos.\n\nTrivia: Just like the previous and next logos, it was designed by Rocky Longo.\n\nVariants:\n\n1960-1966: For movies that were shot in 70mm/Todd-AO, such as 1960's Can-Can, 1963's Cleopatra, and 1965's The Agony and the Ecstasy, the logo is enhanced with an improved sky and tweaked colors in the structure and searchlights, which animate a bit slower. It appears for five seconds and then fades to the words \"TWENTIETH CENTURY-FOX PRESENTS\". The Bible in the Beginning... contains the text \"A TWENTIETH CENTURY-FOX RELEASE\" with copyright information below it.\n\n1965-1967: The logo does not have the CinemaScope snipe and fades out.\n\nA zoomed-in variant exists on VHS prints of The King & I and The Sound of Music.\n\nAn open matte version exists, which is seen on the Fox Movie Channel bumpers from the 1990s.\n\nA 16-bit version exists, with white searchlights and stormy blue clouds in the background. It's also a still logo.\n\nSnipes:\n\nCinemaScope 55: The logo fades to: \"A CINEMASCOPE PICTURE IN (or INTRODUCING) CINEMASCOPE 55\"\n\nGrandeur 70: In 1961, The King and I was re-released in a 70mm version, called \"GRANDEUR 70\", so the CinemaScope snipe was replaced with a Grandeur 70 snipe, which is the text \"IN\" with the Grandeur 70 logo below it.\n\nTechnique: The monument was created as a painting on several layers of glass, and the searchlights were traditionally animated frame-by-frame; once again, this was done by the special effects department of the studio.\n\nAudio:\n\nFebruary 16, 1956-1961: The full CinemaScope fanfare from the previous logo.\n\n1960-1966: The 1935 fanfare or the opening theme of the movie.\n\n1965-1967: Silent or the opening theme of the movie.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nSometimes, the logo is silent or has the opening theme of the movie.\n\nOn Can-Can, a different arrangement of the short fanfare by Nelson Riddle is heard.\n\nAvailability: Seen on large-format (70mm, CinemaScope 55) films.\n\nThis logo made its first known appearance on Carousel.\n\nThe \"regular 0\" variant without the CinemaScope snipe or \"Twentieth Century-Fox presents\" card following is seen on The Sound of Music and Doctor Dolittle (1967).\n\nThe 16-bit version is only seen on Predator 2 for Sega Genesis.\n\nThe CinemaScope snipe of this logo made appearances on Lionsgate's La La Land and on the broadcast of the 74th Golden Globe Awards.\n\n4th Logo (April 10, 1981-August 5, 1994)\n\nVisuals: Another redrawn version of the last logo. This time, the structure is as off-center left as the late 1960s variant of the 1953 logo. The searchlights now have a glow (possibly Scanimate) surrounding them, and the sky is in a lighter shade of blue (closer to daytime, as opposed to the night-blue shade of its predecessors), with the clouds looking more \"blended\". This design of the logo was used as the basis for the 1994 logo.\n\nTrivia: This logo was designed when Rocky Longo repainted the eight-layered glass panels, and straightened the zero. This logo is actually traced over the 1953 logo if one lines up both variants over each other. It also bears a large resemblance to the 1956 logo (particularly the number \"20\").\n\nVariants:\n\nOn some films, such as Porky's Revenge!, the front-left searchlight is pink.\n\nSome films used a dark, washed-out structure.\n\nOn anamorphic films, the Fox logo would be squeezed to fit on standard 1.33:1 film and then stretched with special projector lenses so it could be shown in scope, though the first two Die Hard films and The Adventures of Ford Fairlane use a version where the logo is not squeezed, and thus is stretched out horizontally (at the request of the films' producer, Joel Silver, who liked the stretched look after a mishap with an editor accidentally splicing in a flat logo in the anamorphic print).\n\nThere is another scope variant that was done for films shot in Super 35 where the 1.85 variant was cropped to 2.35/2.39.\n\nOn a few films shot in scope, the logo is in extreme close-up.\n\nOn a couple of films, the logo is placed at a very far distance.\n\nA 4:3 anamorphically-squished version was used on the 1989 CBS/Fox Video release of Die Hard and the TV spots for The Fly (1986). This version was also seen on a Soviet release of Die Hard 2.\n\nOn Jack the Bear, the right searchlight's animation syncs with the middle one's. This is the only variation that doesn't appear on any other film.\n\nClosing Titles:\n\nSame as the previous, but the text reads as either \"Produced and Released by Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation\" or \"Released by Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation\".\n\nIn 1990, the text was shortened to either \"Released by Twentieth Century Fox\" or \"Produced and Released by Twentieth Century Fox\".\n\nOn The Abyss, The Boy Who Could Fly, FernGully: The Last Rainforest and My Cousin Vinny, there was a variation which had \"RELEASED BY\" above the 20th Century Fox print logo.\n\nSometimes, there is a variant where it reads \"Distributed by Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation\" above the print logo, used on both films.\n\nTechnique: The monument was created as a painting on several layers of glass, and the searchlights were traditionally animated frame-by-frame; this time the logo was animated by Pacific Title.\n\nAudio:\n\nApril 10, 1981: The 1954 CinemaScope extension fanfare.\n\nDecember 25, 1981-October 1, 1993: The 1979 fanfare, which was used in tandem with the long version until Freaked. Most films would either use this or the long version.\n\nAugust 6, 1982, July 20, 1984-July 1, 1994: A new arrangement of the long version of the 20th Century Fox fanfare, as conducted by Lionel Newman. The first film to use this rendition was The Pirate Movie, (released on August 6, 1982, though it was not officially used until its premiere on Revenge of the Nerds) and the last to use it was Baby's Day Out (released on July 1, 1994).\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nIn other cases, the logo is silent or has the film's opening theme. Rookie of the Year coincidentally has opening music that starts with a drumroll similar to the one that normally would start the Fox fanfare.\n\nOn some films, such as Porky's II: The Next Day, the 1935 fanfare is heard.\n\nSome prints of pre-1981 films, such as Thunder and Lightning, are plastered with this logo, but keep their original fanfare or sometimes use the 1979 variant. In some cases, it's silent, like on Hardly Working, or has the opening theme of the film.\n\nA slightly modified 1980 recording/arrangement by John Williams, as played by the London Symphony Orchestra, was used on Return of the Jedi. Similarly, Class Action and War of the Roses use James Horner's own arrangement, while some films scored by Jerry Goldsmith also use his own arrangement. An arrangement of the Alfred Newman fanfare with a heavy brass section was used on The Chase, composed by Charles Gerhardt.\n\nThe DVD release of Caravan of Courage: An Ewok Adventure and Battle for Endor: An Ewok Adventure, as the French audio track on the 1998 DTS DVD of Predator use the 1997 arrangement.\n\nOn The Fly (1986), the abridged version of the 1953 CinemaScope fanfare is heard, possibly on purpose.\n\nOn newer prints of Wizards, the logo is out of sync with the 1979 fanfare.\n\nOn AMC's prints of Wall Street, a lower-pitched version of the 1979 fanfare is heard.\n\nTCM France's print of Inferno (1980) has the 1994 fanfare playing over this logo due to poor reverse plastering.\n\nOn Amazon Prime Video and Syfy's prints of Die Hard 2, the 1997 fanfare is heard as a result of a reverse plaster, being based on the post-2007 print.\n\nOn Young Guns (1988), the last note of the 1979 fanfare is cut short.\n\nAvailability: Seen on films from Fox from the time-period until 1994. During its first few years in use, this was used in tandem with the 1953 logo.\n\nNotable films to use this logo include Taps, The Verdict, theatrical versions of Return of the Jedi, Porky's II: The Next Day, Romancing the Stone, Porky's Revenge!, Commando, Aliens, Predator, Broadcast News, Big, Die Hard, Working Girl, Say Anything..., The War of the Roses, Die Hard 2, Home Alone, Predator 2, FernGully: The Last Rainforest, Edward Scissorhands, Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, Alien 3, Once Upon a Forest, The Sandlot, Mrs. Doubtfire, Speed, and Baby's Day Out, among others.\n\nThis logo allegedly premiered on Star Wars IV: A New Hope (released under this title on April 10, 1981), which would use this logo on most fullscreen prints save for the HBO television premiere until the 2nd logo was restored to the film for the 1995 THX release. This logo made its first appearance as the regular logo on T*A*P*S and Modern Problems (both released that Christmas), and its final appearance on Airheads (released on August 5, 1994).\n\nThis logo also plasters the 1953 logo on the video release of Chu Chu and the Philly Flash, current prints of Thunder and Lightning (with the abridged CinemaScope fanfare), Wizards, the director's cut of Alien, My Bodyguard, Revenge of the Nerds, Bad Medicine, Moving Violations, Wall Street, and Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise.\n\nFox plastered/updated the 1st and 2nd logos with this on some colorized versions of its films in the 1980s, such as Miracle on 34th Street (1947; the original logo is restored on newer colorized prints however), and Technicolor films such as Halls of Montezuma.\n\nThis logo also plastered the 3rd logo on late 1980s/early 1990s NBC airings of The Sound of Music.\n\nIt can also be seen on international prints of Crocodile Dundee (except in Australia and New Zealand, where the film was released by Hoyts Distribution), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III (except in Hong Kong, where it was released by Golden Harvest), as well as on the trailer for Deck the Halls.\n\nWhen History of the World: Part I (one of the last films to use the 2nd logo) aired on AMC in the mid-2000s, the extended version of this logo popped up at the very end. Later airings used the current 20th Television logo instead. A similar occurrence also happened when AMC aired Independence Day in 2008.\n\nPost-2007 prints of Die Hard 2 replace this with the next logo (except for Amazon Prime Video and Syfy's prints, where it is still left intact, albeit with the 1997 fanfare).\n\nThe Hong Kong 1995 P&S LaserDisc release of Return of the Jedi removed this in favor of the CBS-FOX Video logo.\n\nThe B&W variant of this logo can be found on some U.S. prints of The Sicilian (however, it does not appear on the Vestron Video VHS release thereof).\n\nThe 1991 (not 1989) Vestron Video release of Young Guns, including the late 1990s LIVE reprint which uses that master, plastered the TCF logo with a sped-up silent version of the Vestron Pictures logo, while other prints omit the logo or, in the case of older pay-TV prints, plastered it with the 1953 logo.\n\nOther Fox releases of Morgan Creek films have this logo removed on Media Home Entertainment releases and current prints, but it is still retained on the CBS/Fox Video and Fox Video releases of The Exorcist III, Young Guns II and Pacific Heights, as well as Tubi's print of Nightbreed (the theatrical cut).\n\nIt is also preserved on the original 1989 Vestron Video VHS release of Young Guns.\n\nOlder VHS, Laserdisc, VCD, and DVD copies of Speed plaster this with the next logo (which was originally intended to debut on the theatrical release of the film); however, it is still retained on the Blu-ray release and USA Network's print of the film (and presumably Syfy's as well).\n\nIVE releases of films from Gladden Entertainment Corporation, along with DVD releases from Live Entertainment and Artisan Entertainment, generally preserved this logo, but it was removed on the 1987 Media Home Entertainment release of Mannequin (replaced by the Cannon Films logo as part of a legal settlement between Cannon and Gladden), the 1991 Live Home Video release of Mannequin 2: On the Move, the Shout! Factory Blu-ray release of Millennium (1989), the Olive Films Blu-ray releases of Mannequin and Mannequin 2: On the Move, and the 1996 Avid Home Entertainment re-release of Weekend at Bernie's.\n\nIt is also preserved on the Vestron Video VHS and Shout! Factory Blu-ray releases of The Sicilian.\n\nHBO's current print of Mannequin also preserves the Fox logo.\n\nThis logo can also be found on the HBO/Cannon Video VHS release of Highlander.\n\nThe Warner Home Video release of The King of Comedy plasters this with the Regency Enterprises logo, while the earlier RCA/Columbia release skips to the opening credits, and even blacks out the closing title.\n\nIt is, however, preserved on all releases since Fox acquired the video rights to the early Regency library.\n\nThis logo can be found on international theatrical prints of Brazil, including the Italian release distributed by Cecchi Gori Group, but most international home video releases either skip to the opening title card or plaster it with the Weintraub Entertainment Group logo, while the Fox Blu-ray releases use the 1994 logo.\n\nIt is currently unknown whether this logo was seen on the international releases of Legend.\n\nMost U.S. VHS releases of The Princess Bride do not have this logo (with the exception of the 1998 MGM VHS release), as 20th Century Fox only held North American theatrical and television rights. As a result, it can be seen on U.S. TV prints of the film, including the 2021 Disney+ print. Amazon Prime Video prints use MGM masters, and therefore plaster this with the MGM logo. It is also retained on the film's current UK DVD releases and the Australian two-disc deluxe edition, despite the film being re-released by Lionsgate there.\n\nThis logo was also seen on the U.S. theatrical prints of The Name of the Rose.\n\nHowever, all home video prints of the film just cut straight into the movie.\n\nThe 1979 theme variant makes an appearance at the end of Sony Movie Channel's broadcast of the 1974 TV movie Death Cruise (a Spelling-Goldberg production), before the 2002 SPT logo, and it is also intact on Crackle's print of the title.\n\nThis logo may also appear on theatrical German prints of titles from Walt Disney Pictures/Touchstone, as Fox had distribution rights to Disney's output in that region before Warner Bros.' German branch took over in 1987.\n\nThis logo was also seen on international theatrical prints of Conan the Barbarian (1982), but current international prints have the 1997 logo in its place.\n\nHowever, this logo was retained on a recent Hits Movies airing.\n\nThis logo was seen on trailers for True Lies, The Pagemaster, and Miracle on 34th Street (1994), all of which ended up using the next logo.\n\nIt is intact on the current UK DVD and Blu-ray releases of Robin Hood: Men in Tights by Fabulous Films, which was released under license from Sony, which is taken from a Fox-owned master instead of a Sony-owned master.\n\nThis logo is also preserved on the Vestron Video VHS release of Fort Apache, The Bronx.\n\nThis logo may also have been seen on U.S. theatrical prints of Streets of Gold, The Manhattan Project, The Morning After, Power, The Boy Who Could Fly, Big Shots, Dreamscape, Fire & Ice (1983), Silkwood, Prizzi's Honor, Plenty, and Space Camp, but home video releases show no evidence.\n\nIt is also preserved on the Vestron VHS releases of Mr. Mom, The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai, National Lampoon's Class Reunion, The Flamingo Kid, Loving Couples, and Impulse (1984).\n\nThis logo is skipped on the Vestron VHS release of Blame it on Rio, but the 2000 MGM Movietime VHS release thereof still retains it.\n\n5th Logo (July 12, 1994-January 22, 2010)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, two searchlights swoop across the screen (first one by one and then both at the same time, in sync with the opening drumroll), revealing a top-down view of the 20th Century Fox structure, redone in CGI. The camera moves down and then around the structure, revealing a Los Angeles/Hollywood skyline in the distance and a starry, cloudy blue/purple/orange sky in the background. Midway through the camera's panning, a yellow light (most likely the sun) shines behind the structure as the second half of the extended fanfare begins, and the camera pans past an additional searchlight in front of the structure before settling into its more usual position and angle. The orange byline \"A NEWS CORPORATION COMPANY\" fades in at the bottom of the screen.\n\nTrivia:\n\nIf one looks very closely, several hidden details can be found in the background, such as the Hollywood sign in the distance and the signage of fictional restaurants/stores behind the structure, including \"Steve's Place\" (referring to Steve Bell, former network production president of 20th Century Fox Television), \"Burns' Tri-City Alarm\" (a homage to Studio Productions animator Kevin Burns' late father, who owned a burglar and fire alarm company in Upstate New York), \"Murdoch's\" (referring to then-Fox CEO Rupert Murdoch), and \"Chernin's\" (referring to former News Corporation president and Chernin Entertainment owner Peter Chernin). There are also signs reading \"STUDIO PRODUCTIONS\" and \"TOPIX\", which, of course, refers to the companies that animated this logo.\n\nThis logo's design had been used earlier for the 1992 20th Television logo.\n\nVariants:\n\nA prototype version of this logo exists, in which the sky background is different, and the camera starts at the default angle before zooming past the structure into the sky. This was created by Richard \"Doc\" Baily of Image Savant for Studio Productions, and can be found on a Image Savant demo reel dated October 22, 1993, as well as on the 1997 documentary 20th Century Fox: The First 50 Years (albeit in reverse).\n\nAnother prototype version also exists, in which the rear searchlights animate differently and the front-right searchlight leans further left. Also, the Hollywood sign is located directly behind the structure, and the Hollywood hills behind the cityscape look different. The byline also fades in late. This version appeared on a demo reel from Flip Your Lid Animation.\n\nOn the \"Special Edition\" reissues of the Star Wars trilogy from 1997 onward, and on the Star Wars prequel trilogy, only the final shot of the finished logo is seen during the first half of the fanfare, followed by the 1996 Lucasfilm logo during the second half (much akin to the original releases of the first three films). On Disney+/4K prints, both the News Corporation byline and registered trademark symbol are removed from the Fox logo, and the Lucasfilm logo is replaced with its 2015 revision.\n\nA short version of this logo exists, which can be found on The Making of The Pagemaster and the CBS television special I Walk the Line: A Night for Johnny Cash, and was also seen on trailers and TV spots for Fox films.\n\nOn The Simpsons Season 10 DVD boxset (released in 2007), the logo is entirely cel-drawn, and Bart Simpson is seen vandalizing the structure while a police officer chases him. On the \"Special Feature Length\" section of each disc, the logo is barricaded behind a wall (which is leaking water).\n\nAn unedited open matte version with neither the byline nor the \"®\" symbol exists. It also runs at 30fps since it wasn't transferred to film. While this variant isn't used on any films or programming, the end shot was used for the 1995-2008 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment logo. It was also found on a later Flip Your Lid demo reel and at the end of the aforementioned 20th Century Fox: The First 50 Years.\n\nOn 4:3 fullscreen prints of certain films from 1999 onward, starting with Never Been Kissed, the logo is zoomed out further than usual.\n\nOn international releases of The Art of War, the 4:3 version of this logo is stretched to widescreen.\n\nThis logo plasters the 1981 logo on the 1995 UK VHS and the 2002 DVD releases of Speed, but is off-center. Said variant is also seen on international DVD releases of Conan the Barbarian (1982).\n\nStarting with Robots (released on March 11, 2005), the colors of the logo were adjusted.\n\nStarting with The Simpsons Movie (albeit as a variant), released on July 27, 2007, the logo was enhanced again with brighter colors. Used in tandem with the previous variant.\n\nClosing Titles:\n\nLike the last logo, until Ice Age: The Meltdown, the text either reads \"Released by Twentieth Century Fox\" or \"Produced and Released by Twentieth Century Fox\".\n\nOn international prints of Titanic, the text reads \"Produced and Released by Paramount Pictures and Twentieth Century Fox\". The North American prints only swapped the studio names the other way around.\n\nOn The Magic Pudding, the print logo is seen instead of the \"Twentieth Century Fox\" text, alongside the logos for Icon Productions and Energee Entertainment.\n\nOn Cast Away, the text reads \"Distributed by TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX FILM CORPORATION\".\n\nOn In the Mix, the print logo scrolls in the credits along with the Lions Gate Films logo.\n\nOn The Dolphin: Story of a Dreamer and Spanish prints of The Aviator, the entire logo is used as a closing logo for some reason.\n\nAt the end of the first two X-Men films and Death Sentence, the print logo is shown.\n\nAt the end of the DVD film Family Guy Presents: Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story, the 1995 20th Century Fox Television logo is used instead.\n\nOn most post-2006 films, no closing logo or in-credit notice is shown at all.\n\nTechnique: CGI directed by the late Kevin Burns at Studio Productions (now Flip Your Lid Animation), who had previously animated the logos for Paramount Pictures, Universal Pictures, Buena Vista Television, and Morgan Creek. Animated in collaboration with Image Savant and Topix.\n\nAudio:\n\nJuly 12, 1994-January 30, 1998: A new arrangement of the extended CinemaScope fanfare, conducted by Bruce Broughton in the 20th Century Fox Scoring Stage (now the Newman Scoring Stage), in which the original 1935 fanfare was recorded. The orchestra is three times bigger, and the fanfare has more reverberation and larger brass/string sections than other fanfares.[5] The last release (officially) to use this fanfare was Great Expectations. However, The Object of My Affection (1998), Wing Commander (1999), some prints of Lake Placid 2 (2007), and German productions such as Krabat (2008) and John Rabe (2009), used this fanfare instead of the 1997 recording. An E! News story on Bruce's fanfare can be seen here.\n\nNovember 14, 1997, March 27, 1998-: A slower arrangement of the long TCF fanfare, as performed by the 20th Century Fox Studio Orchestra and conducted by David Newman, whose father Alfred Newman composed the original fanfare in 1933, as well as its extended counterpart in 1954. According to the Twenty Thousand Hertz podcast, this fanfare was recorded to coincide with the re-opening of the Newman Scoring Stage at the Fox Studio Lot in 1997. The first film to use this fanfare was 1997's Anastasia; Fox films kept using the 1994 fanfare until January 1998.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn some 1994-1998 films, the amount of reverberation/echo can vary.\n\nThe \"Special Edition\" version of the Star Wars trilogy uses the modified 1954 recording of the fanfare as played by the 20th Century Fox Studio Orchestra and conductor Alfred Newman, and the 1980/83 recording of the fanfare as played by the London Symphony Orchestra and conductor John Williams, respectively. New arrangements of John Williams' fanfare were used on the Star Wars prequel films. The VideoVan VCD print of The Phantom Menace uses the normal logo with 1994 fanfare, but the last half of the Star Wars recording can faintly be heard on the Lucasfilm logo.\n\nOn the U.S. prints of The Legend of Bagger Vance and most international prints of Braveheart, the opening theme of the film is heard over the logo instead.\n\nOn the early French and UK releases of Asterix Conquers America (Astérix et les Indiens) and UK, Australian and New Zealand releases of Shine a Light, the logo is silent.\n\nOn the 1993 Image Savant prototype variant, the first 14 seconds of \"Sweet Lullaby (Ambient Mix)\" by Deep Forest is heard.\n\nA short version of the 1997 fanfare exists. The only films to use it are The Darjeeling Limited with the short version of the Fox Searchlight Pictures logo and Marilyn Monroe's unfinished project Something's Got to Give with the 2nd logo. This was also used on the final 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment logo.\n\nOn some prints of Speed and the first two Die Hard films, the 1981-1994 fanfare is heard due to plastering the 4th logo. Other prints may use the 1994 or 1997 fanfares.\n\nOn Anastasia (the 1997 fanfare's debut film), Ever After: A Cinderella Story, some dubs of X2: X-Men United, and Joy Ride 3: Roadkill, the fanfare has a different arrangement than the one that's currently used. This was also conducted by David Newman.\n\nOn Asian Blu-ray releases of Robots, if the Mainland Chinese 2.0 track is selected, the logo (and the rest of the film) is in PAL-pitch, despite being presented in its original film frame rate (notice the audio stuttering from the time stretch used). This is possibly due to it being sourced from TV broadcasts of the film when shown in China, since PAL is the country's video standard there.\n\nAvailability: This logo made its theatrical debut on the North American, Italian and French prints of True Lies (released on July 12, 1994), and was seen in front of almost every subsequent 20th Century Fox film until Tooth Fairy (released on January 22, 2010).\n\nIt can also be seen on some trailers, behind-the-scenes clips and interviews for Predators, as well as the international trailer for Vampires Suck, in tandem with the next logo.\n\nIt can also be found on some video games based on 20th Century Fox films, starting with all versions of both Fantastic Four and Eragon (not counting Ice Age 2: The Meltdown, with the final Fox Interactive logo on the GBA version and no Fox logo at all on all other versions).\n\nThis logo was used in tandem with the next logo until mid-2010, and seen on direct-to-video releases of that year such as Flicka 2 and Mirrors 2, while Space Chimps 2: Zartog Strikes Back used no Fox logo at all.\n\nIt plasters the 2nd logo on international DVD releases of Chariots of Fire and Conan the Barbarian (1982) as 20th Century Fox holds distribution rights.\n\nThis logo does not appear on Epic Movie.\n\nDespite this logo ending regular usage on January 22, 2010, it continued to appear until October 19, 2010, and made a reappearance on the Toei Animation production Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods (March 30, 2013). It even remains unchanged on that film's U.S. Funimation DVD and Blu-ray release. This was also still used for the CIS branch of the company from January 5, 2012 to December 24, 2016 (except for a few films released by the branch), beginning with We Are Family and ending with Santa Claus: Battle of the Magi. It was also seen with the News Corporation byline on Fright Night 2: New Blood (September 30, 2013), and Joy Ride 3: Roadkill (June 3, 2014).\n\nThis logo is also seen on Argentine theatrical prints of The Mask, preceding the New Line Cinema logo.\n\nOn newer prints of some pre-1997 films (such as Nell, The Pagemaster, later prints of Asterix Conquers America (Astérix et les Indiens), and Jingle all the Way), the 1994 fanfare is replaced by the 1997 re-recording.\n\nThis logo was once removed from digital prints of Star Wars Episodes I-III, V and VI, and replaced with the fanfare in the Lucasfilm logo with a custom Star Wars theme, likely due to Disney's ownership of the franchise since 2012. However, following Disney's purchase of Fox, recent Disney+ and 2020 digital and home video prints have the Fox logo restored (excluding the registered trademark symbol and News Corporation byline), and may also appear on TV airings in the future, besides TNT. It also makes an appearance on the post-Disney+ DCPs (Digital Cinema Packages) of the first six Star Wars films, so much so that it even showed up at the start of the 2024 25th anniversary limited theatrical re-release of The Phantom Menace.\n\nIt is also seen at the end of some prints (including a True Entertainment UK broadcast) of the 2005 TV movie Suzanne's Diary for Nicholas, which is actually a Fox Television Studios production.\n\nIt is also retained on the 2003 HIT Entertainment U.S. DVD of the 1997 film The Wiggles Movie (under the title Magical Adventure! A Wiggly Movie).\n\nOn certain films, the original filmed logo is \"plastered\" with the videotaped version, which can be seen on current prints of Independence Day and Mr. & Mrs. Smith.\n\nIt is also seen at the beginning of the DVD film Family Guy Presents: Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story (after a brief prologue and fake trailers created for the film).\n\nIt is also seen on some international prints of The Art of War, as well as that film's PAL DVD release.\n\nIt is also seen on international theatrical and home media prints of Delgo, as Freestyle Releasing released the film in North America.\n\nIt was also seen at the end of a 7flix airing to Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules (2011), despite the film using a variant of the next logo at the beginning.\n\nLegacy: With this logo being redone in CGI, it ultimately became a favorite to many, both inside and outside the logo community.\n\n6th Logo (August 10, 2009-January 10, 2020)\n\nVisuals: A complete redesign of the structure, with many elements of the logo sharing little resemblance to their 1956/1981/1994 counterparts. This time, it is in a dark/orange evening environment, and the structure has a more realistic appearance, complete with a rectangular pattern in the center stage. Extra emphasis is placed on the searchlights around the rear (hidden in previous logos), with two appearing in the intro and after the camera stops moving respectively.\n\nTrivia:\n\nThis logo made its first appearance on a trailer for Avatar on August 10, 2009, before making its official theatrical debut with said film on December 10.\n\nLike the previous logo, if one looks very close in the far right-hand corner before approaching the main structure, the same Hollywood sign (not very big, but still visible if one looks hard enough) from the previous logo can be seen.\n\nOne can also see an Ice Age billboard, cars in the city, and stars at the end of the logo, but there are fewer than the previous logo.\n\nThe \"Celebrating 75 Years\" variant for TCF's 75th anniversary is a contemporary throwback of (and a contemporary homage to) the 20th Century Fox CinemaScope logo, where the 20th logo faded after 10 seconds into the CinemaScope logo; the overall branding for the \"Celebrating 75 Years\" anniversary including the text included in the logos was created in collaboration with Struck Librarian, an agency in Salt Lake City, Utah. More information on the collaboration, including various unused designs, can be found here.\n\nOn September 16, 2014, 20th Century Fox posted a compilation of the logos and its variants (including the \"William Fox Presents\" version of the Fox Film Corporation logo), backed by the 1998 re-recording of the 1997 fanfare (albeit with the drum roll played twice), as a promotion of the new Fox Movies website, on the studio's YouTube channel here.\n\nThe 2013 version of this logo also appeared on a season 3 episode of This Is Us (despite 20th Century Fox Television producing that show) as well as the Family Guy season 20 episode, \"All About Alana\", using the 20.\n\nThe 2013 version also made its first appearance since the renaming during the credits of Deadpool and Wolverine; the movie itself acts as a final sendoff for the films Fox co-produced with Marvel Studios. The first second of the logo appears at the end of a montage of behind-the-scenes footage from these films (going all the way back to 2000's X-Men) and quickly fades out.\n\nAlternate Descriptive Video Descriptions:\n\n2009-2015: In a logo, a towering block of gold letters reads \"20th Century Fox\". Hollywood spotlights criss-cross their shining skyward beams.\n\n2009-2013 (News Corporation byline, after the above description): More words appear: \"A News Corporation Company.\"\n\n2015-2020: Searchlights sweep an evening sky, piercing clouds, and illuminating a towering edifice in the form of 20th Century Fox, with the lights of Hollywood, palm trees, and the hills beyond.\n\nBylines:\n\nAugust 10, 2009-November 5, 2013: \"A NEWS CORPORATION COMPANY\"\n\nJuly 17, 2013-January 10, 2020: Bylineless.\n\nVariants:\n\nFebruary 12, 2010-March 3, 2011: When the logo finishes its move into position, the camera pans up and two streaks of light draw \"75\", as two searchlights turned on, after the \"75\" finishes drawing, with the word \"CELEBRATING\", appearing letter by letter, above the numbers and \"YEARS\" below both in spaced-out letters. The camera pans the words and numbers in position. Also, the registered trademark symbol \"®\" and the News Corporation byline are engraved on different parts of the structure. Also, the front searchlight we usually pass leans more to the left before going off-screen, and a searchlight behind the structure has been removed.\n\nThe prototype version had a much darker red-orange sunset sky, harder shading, and different searchlight positions.\n\nAnother prototype version exists, which can be found on two CGI environment reels by Dave Strick, a designer and modeler at Blue Sky Studios. A much different sky is used and the searchlights are less realistic, the front-left searchlight is located in a slightly different position and wireframes fade in on most of the 3D geometry at the end of the logo sequence (The wireframes indicate the parts of the structure that Strick modeled). It also lacks the flash before the front searchlight passes in. One version of this has Blue Sky's logo and copyright info (dated to 2008) along the bottom of the screen, while another version has details (including Strick's email address) at the beginning where the logo starts blurry and then gains focus. The latter version can be seen here.\n\nA short version with a portion of the animation appears on licensed video games, such as Rio: The Video Game and Aliens vs. Predator.\n\nA still print version can be seen on other games, such as Ice Age: Continental Drift - Arctic Games.\n\nOn some movies with this logo, like Avatar (the logo's debut film) and Penguins of Madagascar, there is an error with the two opening searchlight beams during the fanfare's drumroll. Also, the camera-panning animation is different.\n\nThe final half of this logo's camera-panning sequence can be seen at the beginning of Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace 3D (plastering the 1994 logo variant, before the Lucasfilm logo).\n\nStarting with Turbo, released on July 17, 2013, the News Corporation byline is excluded, and the logo is bylineless for the first time since the 4th logo, due to the aforementioned split.\n\nAn open matte version exists, which was only seen on TV spots for Runner Runner and The Counselor, The Peanuts Movie (albeit as a variant) and on video games based on 20th Century Fox properties.\n\nAn enhanced variant of this logo exists. This variant includes an improved searchlight opening at the beginning, wider beams of light, and more detailed textures. Also, the \"X\" in \"FOX\" is brighter than usual. This variant was only used on Ice Age: Collision Course, Murder on the Orient Express, Ferdinand, Terminator: Dark Fate (only at the end; the beginning uses a variant), and Spies in Disguise.\n\nA sped-up version of the 75 Years variant with the ending theme playing over it also exists, which has been spotted at the end of a Polish airing of the Warner Bros./Regency film Under Siege 2: Dark Territory.\n\nSometimes, such as on international prints of My Name is Khan, Joy, and Maze Runner: The Death Cure, the logo cuts to black instead of fading out as it usually would. On the former, the logo cuts to the Fox Star Studios logo.\n\nClosing Titles: None for the most part, but there are a few variants:\n\nA short version with only the final shot (similar to the variant seen on trailers and TV spots for many Fox films) is seen at the end of Lincoln, Poltergeist (2015), Rules Don't Apply, all DreamWorks Animation films from The Croods to Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie (removed from post-2018 prints), Terminator: Dark Fate, the TV specials Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas and Ice Age: The Great Egg-scapade (TV airings only), and 7flix airings to Ice Age: Collision Course. It's also seen on the short films Maggie Simpson in The Longest Daycare, Rocky and Bullwinkle, Almost Home, and Cosmic Scrat-tastrophe as an opening logo.\n\nAt the end of Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace 3D, the text \"Released by Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation\" is shown.\n\nAt the end of Parental Guidance, Misbehaviour and Ela e Eu, the print logo is shown.\n\nAt the end of the majority of Fox films starting in 2012, a disclaimer (usually in white) appears on a black background following the end credits, reading \"The making and authorized distribution of the film supported over (number) jobs and involved hundreds of thousands of/over one million work hours.\" The font varies depending on the film.\n\nTechnique: CGI designed by Chris Wedge and Carlos Saldanha and animated at Twentieth Century Fox's now-defunct sibling company Blue Sky Studios. This was made using Autodesk Maya.\n\nAudio: The 1997 Fox fanfare composed and conducted by David Newman.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nThe 2005 recording of the 1989 20th Century Fox Television fanfare is heard at the end of Ice Age: A Mammoth Christmas.\n\nThe 1999 recording of the 1980 fanfare arrangement was retained at the beginning of Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace 3D, with only the final shot of this logo seen, followed by the Lucasfilm logo (similar to what was done for the original prequel trilogy).\n\nStarting with the 3D re-release, the 1994 fanfare is heard on international prints of Titanic. This is also heard on the films Klitschko (2011; German prints only), Ausgerechnet Sibirien (2012), Rico, Oskar und die Tieferschatten (2014) and Rico, Oskar und das Herzgebreche (2015), but not Rico, Oskar und der Diebstahlstein (2016), as the 1998 fanfare was used instead.\n\nThe 1981 fanfare is heard on the 3D version of Predator.\n\nIn rare cases, such as The Monuments Men (U.S. release), The Greatest Showman, Gone Girl, Ad Astra, the Russian film The Balkan Line, and Terminator: Dark Fate (both U.S. and international versions), the film's opening theme is used instead.\n\nIn rarer instances, such as U.S. prints of Bridge of Spies, the logo is silent.\n\nThe 2012 recording of the 1989 20th Century Fox Television fanfare is heard at the end of Ice Age: The Great Egg-scapade, albeit quieter.\n\nFor the short version, none, the movie's closing theme, or the trailer's opening theme.\n\nOn most dubbed international prints of Ford v. Ferrari, the music is in a lower pitch, along with those of TSG's and Chernin's logos.\n\nOn a 2020 ABC broadcast of The Greatest Showman, the opening theme of the second half of the movie's logo variant (including the 1953 logo variant in the first half and the broadcast itself) is higher-pitched, due to the usage of a PAL print.\n\nAvailability: Seen on nearly every film from the company until the renaming in 2020, starting with Avatar (released on December 10, 2009) and ending with Underwater (released on January 10, 2020).\n\nThe prototype versions are found on trailers and TV spots for Avatar, as well as various newer 20th Century Fox games.\n\nThe 75 Years variant made its debut on Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief (released on February 12, 2010), and made its last appearance on Gulliver's Travels (released on December 25, 2010). Outside North America, this continued use until Love Carrot 3 (released on March 3, 2011).\n\nThis logo is seen on some international theatrical release prints of Hot Tub Time Machine.\n\nIt can also be found on some video games based on 20th Century Fox films, such as the Alien vs. Predator game, Rio, Ice Age: Continental Drift - Arctic Games, and Snoopy's Grand Adventure.\n\nThe logo with the News Corporation byline was last used on DVD, Blu-ray, and the DigitalHD trailer of Turbo (released on November 5, 2013).\n\nFrom March 22, 2013 to June 2, 2017, this logo was seen at both the start and end of DreamWorks Animation films, right before that company's logo, beginning with The Croods and ending with Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie. On post-2018 prints of most of these movies, this is plastered by the 2013 Universal Pictures logo, although some prints after 2018 may retain it, such as current prints of Trolls as Universal kept the logo intact on those film's current prints.\n\nHowever, on BBC prints of How to Train Your Dragon 2, Penguins of Madagascar, Home, Kung Fu Panda 3, and Trolls, this logo is instead plastered by the 2011 Paramount Pictures logo, even though Paramount ended its distribution deal with DreamWorks in 2012. In the case of HTTYD 2, Penguins of Madagascar and Kung Fu Panda 3, it's possible that this was done to maintain consistency with each film's predecessor, which were all distributed by Paramount.\n\nIn addition, this logo was also plastered with the Oriental DreamWorks and CJ Entertainment logo on Chinese and Korean releases of DWA films respectively.\n\nAdditionally, Kung Fu Panda 3 has the China Film Co., Ltd. logo precede the former on Chinese prints.\n\nThis logo also precedes the STXfilms logo on Malaysian theatrical prints of UglyDolls, similar to VVS Films on Canadian prints.\n\nThis logo also additionally plasters the previous logo on Star Wars I: The Phantom Menace (3D prints only) and international prints of Titanic since 2012, and the 1981 logo on Predator (3D prints only) since 2013.\n\nSimilar to current prints of Titanic as stated above, this logo plasters the 2012 Paramount logo on older British prints of Selma (on newer prints of the latter, however, it is plastered by the Pathe logo).\n\nDespite the company's renaming in early 2020, the \"20th Century Fox\" name still sporadically appears on some newer productions. For example, despite using the next logo in trailers and promotional material, The Empty Man (released on October 23, 2020) likely used this logo due to having been shelved for three years after being shot in 2017. It is also still in use on Brazilian films since Alice & Só. Examples include Amarração do Amor and Ela e Eu, released on October 14, 2021 and July 21, 2022, respectively.\n\nOccasionally, this logo is seen at the end of some international prints of old Warner Bros.-produced Regency titles (which 20th Century Studios owns as of today, unless WB ever gets the rights back), including Under Siege 2: Dark Territory and The Negotiator. With 20th Century Studios' deal with Regency being extended in late 2021, it's unknown if Regency will ever find a new distributor. Unlike WB and especially TCF's parent company Disney, Fox does not have a closing logo, so the animated closing variant is used.\n\nLegacy: Many consider this logo as a suitable successor to the original CGI logo.\n\nUnused\n\nLogo (1992)\n\nVisuals: The logo is similar to the 4th logo, but now in CGI and with some differences, those being a lighter background and darker lighting.\n\nTechnique: CGI by Novocom.\n\nAvailability: The only known appearance of this logo is an image found on Novocom's website, which has since been shut down. An archived version of the site can be found here. It is currently unknown if video footage of this logo exists.\n\n20th Century Studios\n\nLogo (February 21, 2020-)\n\nVisuals: A reworking of the final 20th Century Fox logo, with the word \"STUDIOS\" replacing \"FOX\" and \"CENTURY\" being largely taller to accommodate for it. Shading, modelling and texturing also largely differ from the previous logo, including an enhanced finish on the structure, shinier and sleeker searchlights with wider light beams, a different sky backdrop, different palm trees, and a larger and more detailed Los Angeles landscape.\n\nAlternate Descriptive Video Description: Searchlights sweep an evening sky, piercing clouds, and illuminating a towering edifice in the form of \"20th Century Studios\", with the lights of Hollywood, palm trees, and the hills beyond.\n\nVariants:\n\nAs a de-facto home video logo on current 20th Century Studios home media releases, the logo is cut short to the middle, similar to the variant seen on the 3D re-release of The Phantom Menace.\n\nOn Picturemill's Spring 2020 reel and on movies starting with Free Guy, an enhanced version of the sky backdrop from the final 20th Century Fox logo is used.\n\nStarting with Vacation Friends (except for Death on the Nile), the \"®\" symbol is removed.\n\nAn open matte version exists.\n\nA 48fps version exists, which is seen on Avatar (plastering the final TCF logo on the 2022 re-release), the international prints of the 25th Anniversary re-release of Titanic (plastering the 1994 and 2009 TCF logos), and on films starting with Avatar: The Way of Water, for both 2D and 3D versions.\n\nClosing Title: Usually, it's the same closing text from the previous logo.\n\nTechnique: CGI by Picturemill (based on Blue Sky's design), who also animated the 1997 Universal Pictures logo, the enhanced/New Line Cinema versions of the Warner Bros. Pictures logo, and the 2008 Nickelodeon Movies logo.\n\nAudio: The 1997 Fox fanfare composed and conducted by David Newman.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nThe short version has the same short version as the final 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment logo.\n\nOn the international prints of the 25th Anniversary re-release of Titanic, the 1994 fanfare is heard, just like with the 2012 3D and 2017 Dolby Vision re-releases with the final TCF logo.\n\nAvailability: This logo can be seen on the majority of its films released since February 21, 2020.\n\nThis logo was first seen on a TV spot for The Call of the Wild (2020) on February 3, before debuting on the film itself 18 days later.\n\nThis logo does not appear on Everybody's Talking About Jamie, as Disney sold the distribution rights to the film to Amazon Studios. However, the trailer does feature this logo.\n\nThis logo also does not appear on The Empty Man, and on Brazilian films since Alice & Só, which all feature the final 20th Century Fox logo instead (as mentioned above), nor does it appear on some films produced for the Disney+ service, such as Better Nate Than Ever, Diary of a Wimpy Kid (2021), Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules (2022), The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild, Cheaper by the Dozen (2022), Night at the Museum: Kahmunrah Rises Again, Crater, and Diary of a Wimpy Kid Christmas: Cabin Fever, which all use the 2011 version of the 2006 Walt Disney Pictures logo, and the latter using the 2022 logo, because they were moved from the company during production.\n\nIt also additionally does not appear on Deep Water and Deadpool & Wolverine, despite the company producing the latter film and its print logo appearing on the marketing.\n\nThe short version is also used as a de-facto home video logo on post-2020 20th Century Studios DVD and Blu-ray releases (not counting 2020s reprints of all pre-2020 movies, retaining their old logos until then), after the final TCFHE logo retired. It does not appear on 4K Ultra HD releases, as they all skip it. It is still unknown whenever the 20th Century Home Entertainment logo will appear in future 4K releases.\n\nMovies that do not use the closing text include The Call of the Wild (the first film under the 20th Century Studios name), Ron's Gone Wrong (this logo's animated debut), Home Sweet Home Alone (the first Disney+ original film released by the company), No Exit, The Bob's Burgers Movie, The Princess, Rosaline, Avatar: The Way of Water, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, etc.\n\nThe last film to use the original version was the Netflix film The Woman in the Window, released on May 14, 2021. However, it makes an appearance on the first two trailers of Prey (2022), trailers for White Men Can't Jump (2023), and is still being used as a de-facto home video logo.\n\nThis logo does not appear on the 20th Century Home Entertainment 4K release of the Regency film Heat; only the aforementioned logo appears,\n\nAs stated above, this logo plasters the final 20th Century Fox logo on the remastered re-release of Avatar, though the ABC premiere in December 2022 retains the final 20th Century Fox logo, and it also plasters said logo on the 25th Anniversary re-release of Titanic. It is currently unknown that any other plastering will happen as of now.\n\nThis logo is seen at the end of each episode of the miniseries Faraway Downs, likely because that series is a TV adaptation of the 2008 film Australia.\n\nAs of today, despite the acquisition of 21st Century Fox's properties (including 20th Century Studios; formerly 20th Century Fox at the time) by Disney in 2019, it is currently unknown whether 20th Century Studios films would feature the credit \"Distributed by WALT DISNEY STUDIOS MOTION PICTURES\", at the end as they currently instead use either a closing title, none, or on international prints, the Buena Vista International (BVI) logo (theatrical prints only; omitted on home video and streaming releases).\n\nLegacy: Some consider this a suitable update to the previous logo, although the name change at first was not as well-received.\n\nCopyright stamps\n\n1935-1984: Copyright © [YEAR] Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corporation.\n\n1984-2020: Copyright © [YEAR] Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation.\n\n2020-: Copyright © [YEAR] 20th Century Studios, Inc.\n\nReferences\n\n20th Century Studios article on Wikipedia\n\nOfficial Website for 20th Century Studios\n\n20th Century Studios credits on IMDb\n\n20th Century Fox credits on IMDb\n\n20th Century Studios article on Logopedia"
