Spielberger's State-trait anger expression inventory].\n\nPubMed\n\nBorteyrou, X; Bruchon-Schweitzer, M; Spielberger, C D\n\n2008-06-01\n\n(principal axis analysis, followed by promax rotations). For the first part of the questionnaire (SAS), factor analysis suggested the presence of three factors with eigenvalues >1.0; but the factor structure obtained for males and females differed and was difficult to interpret. Moreover, the explained variance of Factors 2 and 3 was low. Velicer's MAP criteria and screen test established that one solution factor was more relevant. Confirmatory factor analysis suggested that the three factor solution was acceptable, but the unifactorial solution adjusted better to the data. For the second part of the questionnaire (TAS) factor analysis was conducted following the same procedure, and two factors were extracted. The explained variance of Factor 2 was very low. Velicer's MAP criteria and screen test suggested that the solution factor was more relevant. Moreover, the adjustment parameters of the original two-factor structure were not satisfactory. Finally, the analyses of the 32 items of anger expression and control yielded four factors with eigenvalues >1.0. All items loaded higher than 0.38 on the corresponding factor and lower than 0.30 in other factor. The factor structure of the AX scale was fairly robust, both for males and females. Internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the subscales were acceptable except for the SAS. The correlations of the six subscales with four criterion variables (Buss Durkee hostility inventory, Cook and Medley Ho scale, NEO PI-R Ho scale and Courtauld emotions control scale) were in the expected direction, establishing their convergent validity. In summary, the analysis reported in this study checked the factor structure of the STAXI-2 translated into French. The state anger dimension was also essentially confirmed, but no distinction was found between the three components: feeling angry, feeling like expressing anger verbally, and feeling like expressing anger physically. Moreover, the distinction between angry temperament and angry\n\nAnger Assessment in Clinical and Nonclinical Populations: Further Validation of the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2.\n\nPubMed\n\nLievaart, Marien; Franken, Ingmar H A; Hovens, Johannes E\n\n2016-03-01\n\nThe most commonly used instrument for measuring anger is the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2 (STAXI-2; Spielberger, 1999). This study further examines the validity of the STAXI-2 and compares anger scores between several clinical and nonclinical samples. Reliability, concurrent, and construct validity were investigated in Dutch undergraduate students (N = 764), a general population sample (N = 1211), and psychiatric outpatients (N = 226). The results support the reliability and validity of the STAXI-2. Concurrent validity was strong, with meaningful correlations between the STAXI-2 scales and anger-related constructs in both clinical and nonclinical samples. Importantly, patients showed higher experience and expression of anger than the general population sample. Additionally, forensic outpatients with addiction problems reported higher Anger Expression-Out than general psychiatric outpatients. Our conclusion is that the STAXI-2 is a suitable instrument to measure both the experience and the expression of anger in both general and clinical populations.

Although the STAXI-II is extensively used and its psychometric properties supported, no psychometric critique has yet specifically assessed its utility with forensic populations. The aim of this critique was to explore the validity and reliability of the STAXI-II when used with forensic samples. It was found that the psychometric properties of the STAXI-II, when used with forensic populations, are satisfactory. However, gaps in research and issues that need to be addressed in practice have been highlighted. Although STAXI-II provides a comprehensive measure of anger, it does not capture all aspects of the construct. In addition, the tool does not contain an inherent validity scale, indicating the need to control for social desirability responding when administering the STAXI-II. Practical implications, limitations, and future research will be discussed.

Secondly, we wanted to examine possible differences in driving anger experience and expression between professional German taxi drivers and nonprofessional German drivers. We applied German versions of the DAS, the DAX, and the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) to a sample of 138 professional German taxi drivers. We then compared their ratings to the ratings of a sample of 1,136 nonprofessional German drivers (Oehl and Brandenburg n.d. ). Regarding our first objective, confirmatory factor analysis shows that the model fit of the DAS is better for nonprofessional drivers than for professional drivers. The DAX applies neither to professional nor to nonprofessional German drivers properly. Consequently, we suggest modified shorter versions of both scales for professional drivers. The STAXI applies to both professional and nonprofessional drivers. With respect to our second objective, we show that professional drivers experience significantly less driving anger than nonprofessional drivers, but they express more driving anger. We conclude that the STAXI can be applied to professional German taxi drivers. In contrast, for the DAS and the DAX we found particular shorter versions for professional taxi drivers. Especially for the DAX, most statements were too strong for German drivers to agree to. They do not show behaviors related to driving anger expression as they are described in the DAX. These problems with the original American DAX items are in line with several other studies in different countries. Future investigations should examine whether (professional) drivers from further countries express their anger\n\nAnger in health, benign breast disease and breast cancer: a prospective case-control study.\n\nPubMed\n\nBruno, Antonio; Pandolfo, Gianluca; Scimeca, Giuseppe; Leonardi, Valentina; Cedro, Clemente; Racchiusa, Sergio; Zoccali, Rocco Antonio; Muscatello, Maria Rosaria A\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory 2 (STAXI-2) is a psychometric instrument measuring anger experience and expression. Associations between the STAXI-2 and risk of breast cancer (BC) are rarely considered together in a prospective study. A total of 117 women with breast symptoms referred for breast examination were selected and assessed before any diagnostic procedures. Twenty-four patients with BC, 44 with benign breast disease (BBD) and 49 healthy individuals (HHS) were included. Scores for parameters state anger/feel like expressing anger physically (SANGP) were significantly higher in the HHS group (HHS vs. BBD: p=0.027; HHS vs. BC: p=0.025). BC patients showed a trend to lower scores in almost all scales of STAXI-2, except for the scales trait anger/angry temperament (TANGT), anger expression-in (AX-I), and anger control-out (AC-O), that were higher than the two other groups' scores. The results of this study do not support a specific link between STAXI-2 and breast cancer risk. Copyright Â© 2014 International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. John G.

Its core is comprised of four questions and turnarounds that enable the participant to experience a different interpretation of reality. We assessed the effect of \"The Work\" meditation on quality of life and psychological symptoms in a non-clinical sample. This study was designed as a single-group pilot clinical trial (open label). Participants (n = 197) enrolled in a nine-day training course (\"The School for The Work\") and completed a set of self-administered measures on three occasions: before the course (n = 197), after the course (n = 164), and six months after course completion (n = 102). Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS), Quality of Life Inventory (QOLI), Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (QIDS-SR16), Outcome Questionnaire 45.2 (OQ-45.2), State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2 (STAXI-2), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). A mixed models analysis revealed significant positive changes between baseline compared to the end of the intervention and six-month follow-up in all measures: BDI-II (t = 10.24, P < .0001), SHS (t = -9.07, P <.0001), QOLI (t = -5.69, P < .0001), QIDS-SR16 (t = 9.35, P < .0001), OQ-45.2 (t = 11.74, P < .0001), STAXI-2 (State) (t = 3.69, P = .0003), STAXI-2 (Trait) (t = 7.8, P < .0001), STAI (State) (t = 11.46, P < .0001), and STAI (Trait) (t = 10.75, P < .0001). The promising results of this pilot study warrant randomized clinical trials to validate \"The Work\" meditation technique as an effective intervention for improvement in psychological state and quality of life in the general population.

However, little attention has been focused on other negative emotions, such as anger. Our purpose was to evaluate whether trait anger (a predisposition to experience frequent and intense episodes of anger over time) is different between persons with and without MS after controlling for depression, anxiety, and other socio-demographic variables. 157 consecutive MS patients were enrolled in the study and compared to eighty age, gender, and education-matched healthy controls. Participants were administered affective trait measures (Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory) and the trait anger measure (the Spanish adapted version of the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2 [STAXI-2]). MS patients had significantly higher scores on anger intensity (state anger) and trait anger than did controls. They also had a trend to experience direct anger toward other persons or objects in the environment (higher anger expression-out score) and to hold in or suppress angry feelings (higher anger expression-in score). However, in a regression analysis that adjusted for different demographic and clinical variables, we found that diagnosis category (MS patient vs. control) was associated with none of the highest quartiles of STAXI-2 scores, except for the Trait Anger scale (odds ratios between 2.35 and 3.50). The present study provides further evidence that MS is independently associated with high trait anger. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We designed this study in order to evaluate the predictor effect of depression, loneliness, anger and interpersonal relationship styles for internet addiction as well as develop a model. Forty (40) male internet addicted patients were selected from our hospital's internet Addiction Outpatient Clinic. During the study, the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the State Trait Anger Expression Scale (STAXI), the UCLA-Loneliness Scale (UCLA-LS), and the Interpersonal Relationship Styles Scale (IRSS) were used for the evaluation of the patients. The results of this study showed that the 'duration of internet use' (B=2.353, p=0.01) and STAXI 'anger in' subscale (B=1.487, p=0.01) were the predictors of internet addiction. When the clinicians suspect for the internet overuse, regulation of internet usage might be helpful. Psychiatric treatments for expressing anger and therapies that focus on validation of the feelings may be useful.\n\nThe associations of morningness-eveningness with anger and impulsivity in the general population.\n\nPubMed\n\nHwang, Jeong Yeon; Kang, Seung-Gul; Gwak, Ah Reum; Park, Juhyun; Lee, Yu Jin\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the relationships among morningness-eveningness, impulsivity and anger in the general population. A total of 1000 community-dwelling subjects (500 males) aged 20-77 years (meanÂ± SD age: 39.6 Â± 11.6 years) completed the morningness-eveningness questionnaire (MEQ), Barratt impulsiveness scale (BIS), Spielberger State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. Moderation and mediation analyses were performed to determine whether the relationship between two variables depended on the third variable, referred to as a moderator, and whether the third variable, known as a mediator, was associated with the other two variables establishing causation. The MEQ scores exhibited significant negative associations with BIS (p < 0.001) and STAXI (p < 0.001) scores, and high scores on the BIS were associated with high scores on the STAXI (p < 0.001). Impulsivity, as measured by the BIS, played a role as a moderator (p < 0.001) in the relationship between MEQ and STAXI, and anger, as measured by the STAXI, acted as moderator (p = 0.030) in the association between MEQ and BIS. However, after controlling for the interaction of the BIS and MEQ, the MEQ scores did not significantly predict STAXI scores (p = 0.070). Additionally, the effect size of the mediating effect of the BIS scores on the relationship between the MEQ and STAXI (percent mediation: 53.2%) was larger than that of the STAXI scores on the association between the MEQ and BIS (percent mediation: 31.8%). The present results demonstrate that morningness-eveningness was closely related with both impulsivity and anger in the general population. Furthermore, these findings suggest that impulsivity may exercise a great influence on the association between morningness-eveningness and anger in two ways: as a moderator by modulating this relationship based on the level of impulsivity and as a mediator by acting as an intermediary factor.\n\n[Depression, anxiety and anger in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus.\n\nPubMed\n\nMuscatello, Maria Rosaria Anna; Troili, Giulia Maria; Pandolfo, Gianluca; Mento, Carmela; Gallo, Giuseppa; Lanza, Giulia; Pintaudi, Basilio; Di Vieste, Giacoma; Di Benedetto, Antonino; Zoccali, Rocco Antonio; Bruno, Antonio\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the influence of negative emotions such as depression, anxiety and anger on clinical expression of type 1 diabetes, also assessing possible gender differences. 75 subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus afferent to Diabetology Unit of the University Hospital in Messina underwent the following psychodiagnostic tests: Hamilton Rating Scale For Depression (HDRS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory form Y (STAI-Y), State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2 (STAXI-2). Continuous data were expressed as mean Â± standard deviation, and the comparison between groups was performed using T Student test; the data not continuous were expressed as a percentage and the differences between groups were evaluated using Chi-square test. We considered the results for values of p<0.05. The mean age of 75 subjects (49.3% males) was 41.0Â±11.4 years, age of disease onset was 21.1 Â± 11.8 years and mean duration of disease was 19.9Â±11.9 years; 30.7% of subjects were treated with CSII (Subcutaneus Insulin Infusion). Mild levels of depression (HDRS= 10.71Â±7.9) and anxiety (STAI-Y= 52.37Â±6.11) were found, whereas STAXI-2 subscales scores were within the normal range. Statistical analysis did not show significant gender differences. Our results, according to data from literature, confirm the association between negative emotions, particularly anxiety, and diabetes. No gender differences were found. Our results suggest the importance of investigating the association between diabetes and negative emotional states and the psychological and psychopathological dimensions which may have a potential role in the therapeutic management of diabetes.\n\n43 CFR 4710.2 - Inventory and monitoring.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2012 CFR\n\n2012-10-01\n\n...

A total of 1,116 adults were sampled with randomization in an urban area. After excluding 116 participants due to incomplete answer, 1,000 participants (500 males; mean age 39.6 Â± 11.6) completed self-report questionnaire including the Center for Epidemiologic Study Depression Scale (CES-D), the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSI), the Spielberger State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI), the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS), and questions on weekday sleep duration. Results showed higher scores on the BSI were related with higher scores on the STAXI, CES-D, a family history of psychiatric illness, and short or long sleep duration (â¤ 5 or â¥ 10 hr) (adjusted R (2) = 0.151, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P = 0.001, and P = 0.008, respectively). The predictive power of the STAXI scores, the presence of psychiatric family history and short or long sleep duration was stronger in the high CES-D group with scores of 16 or higher (adjusted R (2) = 0.275, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively). These findings suggest that suicide idea in general population may be related with the presence of family history for psychiatric illness, depressive mood, high anger and short or long sleep duration.\n\nDoes anger mediate between personality and eating symptoms in bulimia nervosa?\n\nPubMed\n\nAmianto, Federico; Siccardi, Sara; Abbate-Daga, Giovanni; Marech, Lucrezia; Barosio, Marta; Fassino, Secondo\n\n2012-12-30\n\nThe goals of the study were to explore anger correlation with bulimic symptoms and to test the mediation power of anger between personality and eating psychopathology. A total of 242 bulimia nervosa (BN) outpatients and 121 healthy controls were recruited. Assessment was performed using Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI); State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory 2 (STAXI-2); Eating Disorder Inventory-2 (EDI-2); Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ); Binge Eating Scale (BES); and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Mediation was tested on the whole BN group, on controls and on two BN subgroups based on a previous history of anorexia nervosa. Self-Directedness and Cooperativeness extensively relate to anger and psychopathology in bulimic group. Bulimic symptoms are related to Trait Reactive Anger. Trait Anger and Anger Expression fully mediate Cooperativeness effects on binge eating and Impulsiveness in the BN subjects. Anger Expression-In partially mediates between Harm Avoidance and Social Insecurity/Interpersonal Distrust in BN subjects. The comparison with controls and the analysis of subgroups underlines that these patterns are specific for BN. Anger mediation between Cooperativeness, and binge eating and impulsive behaviours confirm the relevance of relational dynamics in the expression of these core eating symptoms. Relational skills may represent a relevant target for the treatment of BN. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Analysis of anger, aggression and impulsivity.\n\nPubMed\n\nGiegling, Ina; Olgiati, Paolo; Hartmann, Annette M; Calati, Raffaella; MÃ¶ller, Hans-JÃ¼rgen; Rujescu, Dan; Serretti, Alessandro\n\n2009-12-01\n\nSuicide is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, mortality from suicide being approximately 2%. Attempted suicide appears to be a major risk factor for suicide completion. Anger, aggression and impulsivity are personality traits associated with suicide attempt. In this study we analysed a part of a previously reported sample in order to test anger, impulsivity and temperament/character scales as predictors of aggression and self-aggression in suicide attempters and to compare anger- and aggression-related traits between impulsive and premeditated suicide attempts as well as between violent and non-violent suicide methods. One-hundred-eleven consecutively admitted inpatients with a lifetime history of attempted suicide were assessed for anger (State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory, STAXI), aggression (Questionnaire for Measuring Factors of Aggression, FAF) and temperament/character (Temperament and Character Inventory, TCI). Higher aggression scores, as measured by FAF, were predicted by being male, meeting criteria for borderline personality disorder and having higher angry temperament scores as assessed by STAXI; low cooperativeness was also associated with aggression but not after controlling for STAXI scales. TCI dimensions associated with self-aggression were high harm avoidance, high impulsivity and low self-directedness; state anger, inwardly directed anger and inhibition of aggression were also predictors of self-aggression. In conclusion, impulsivity and harm avoidance have emerged as temperament dimensions independently associated with self-aggressive tendencies in personality. Such interactions could explain the correlation between temperament and suicidality but further research is needed. Anger and self-directedness appear to have some effects on suicide attempt.\n\nAnger in women treated with assisted reproductive technology (ART): effects on mother and newborn.\n\nPubMed\n\nMuscatello, Maria Rosaria Anna; Lorusso, Simona; Bruno, Antonio; Reale, Rosa; Ciura, Giulia La; LaganÃ , Antonio Simone; Retto, Giovanni; Sturlese, Emanuele; Zoccali, Rocco Antonio\n\n2016-03-01\n\nTo assess anger, as well as other negative emotions, in women who underwent assisted reproductive technology (ART) respect to women who conceived naturally, and explore the effect of anger on neonatal outcomes.

We performed Structural Clinical Interview for DSM-SCID I and II in order to assess the DSM IV axis I and axis II, State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory 2 (STAXI-2), the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Self-rating Anxiety scale (SAS). On the STAXI-2 scale, the ART group scored higher than the natural conception group on measures of general tendency and personality disposition to get angry. Moreover, the ART group women showed quite low levels of tolerance to negative environmental feedback. Our results further suggest that trait anger provides the most meaningful contribution as predictor of weight at birth. No significant differences were found for anxiety and depression between the two groups. Our study highlights the important role of anger during pregnancy, and suggests the need for further studies on both biochemical and behavioural patterns in larger samples of women who became pregnant by ART.\n\nThe Relationship between Anger Expression and Its Indices and Oral Lichen Planus.\n\nPubMed\n\nMehdipour, Masoumeh; Taghavi Zenouz, Ali; Farnam, Alireza; Attaran, Rana; Farhang, Sara; Safarnavadeh, Maryam; Gholizadeh, Narges; Azari-Marhabi, Saranaz\n\n2016-05-01\n\nOral lichen planus (OLP) is a common inflammatory disease with unknown etiology. Depression, stress and anxiety are psychological factors that their influence on the expression of lichen planus by affecting the immune system's function has been confirmed. There is a probable relationship between anger and OLP expression. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the association of \"anger\" and OLP. In this descriptive study 95 subjects were included in 3 groups. A: patients with oral lichen planus, B: positive control, C: negative control. Anger and its indices were assessed by the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2 (STAXI-2) questionnaire, and pain was measured via the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The collected data were analyzed statistically using SPSS 18 software. The lichen planus and positive control groups bore higher total anger index (AX index) values compared with the negative control. Comparing anger expression-in (AXI) among the lichen planus and negative control groups revealed higher grades in lichen planus group. Evaluating the pain severity index (VAS) data and anger indices in lichen planus group, Spearman's Rank Correlation Test revealed a significant correlation between TAngR (reactional anger traits) and pain severity. The findings of this study indicated that there was a significant correlation between anger control and suppression of lichen planus development. On the other hand, the patients with more severe pain mostly expressed their anger physically. Based on the findings, we can make the claim that anger suppression and its control-in (gathering tension) may play a role in the development of lichen planus as a known psychosomatic disorders.\n\nThe Relationship between Anger Expression and Its Indices and Oral Lichen Planus\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMehdipour, Masoumeh; Taghavi Zenouz, Ali; Farnam, Alireza; Attaran, Rana; Farhang, Sara; Safarnavadeh, Maryam; Gholizadeh, Narges\n\n2016-01-01\n\nOral lichen planus (OLP) is a common inflammatory disease with unknown etiology.

World Health Organization Quality of Life-Bref (WHOQOL-BREF), State Trait Anxiety Inventory-Y (STAI-Y), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), Prolonged Grief Disorder Questionnaire, Coping Orientations to Problem Experiences, State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory-2 (STAXI-2), and the Medical Outcome Study Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS) were administered. One-sample t-tests were performed to compare WHOQOL-BREF, STAI-Y and STAXI-2 mean scores to the respective normative sample (NS). Pearson correlation was calculated between time dedicated to patient's care, WHOQOL-BREF, BDI-II, STAI-Y and MOS-SSS scores. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were performed to evaluate which variables have predictive power on QoL. A total of 129 caregivers, 68.2% female, mean age 52.8 years, were enrolled. Three WHOQOL-BREF domains were significantly lower. Anxiety and anger were in line with NS. 28.7% of the sample reported high level of depressive symptoms; 20.9% satisfied the prolonged grief disorder criteria. No differences emerged between caregivers and chronic ill patients' scores at MOS-SSS. STAI-Y, BDI-II and WHOQOL-BREF scores positively correlated. MOS-SSS domains inversely correlate with BDI-II scores. BDI-II results the most relevant predictor of QoL. Study results provided innovative information about caregivers' poor QoL, difficulties in social support and high levels of burden. Time dedicated to care is not strictly related to burden, while social support perceived is highly associated with caregivers' depressive symptoms that are strong predictor of poor QoL. Supportive intervention able to integrate psychological, social and environmental levels is needed. Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of behavioural/psycho-educational group training in men who are chronically stressed from overworking. Of 72 male subjects, 36 were randomly assigned to training for 8 weeks and another 36 formed the control group, which received a placebo intervention. Primary outcome measures were systolic blood pressure, salivary cortisol concentration upon awakening, and self-reported changes on the scales of the Trier Inventory for the Assessment of Chronic Stress (TICS), the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI) and the 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). A significant reduction in mean values was observed in daily systolic blood pressure and salivary cortisol concentration on all the TICS and most of the STAXI and SF-36 scales. Behavioural/psycho-educational group training appears to be effective in the treatment of men suffering from chronic stress due to overworking.\n\n48 CFR 49.303-2 - Submission of inventory disposal schedules.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2010 CFR\n\n2010-10-01\n\n... 48 Federal Acquisition Regulations System 1 2010-10-01 2010-10-01 false Submission of inventory disposal schedules. 49.303-2 Section 49.303-2 Federal Acquisition Regulations System FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATION CONTRACT MANAGEMENT TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS Additional Principles for Cost-Reimbursement...\n\nAnger experience, styles of anger expression, sadistic personality disorder, and psychopathy in juvenile sexual homicide offenders.\n\nPubMed\n\nMyers, W C; Monaco, L\n\n2000-05-01\n\nSexual homicide by juveniles is a rare phenomenon, and information regarding the psychological and behavioral characteristics of this group is limited. No studies exist which have investigated anger experience and styles of anger expression, and the relationship between anger, sadistic personality disorder, and psychopathy, in this type of youthful offender. These areas were explored by evaluating 14 juvenile sexual homicide offenders through clinical assessment, the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI), the Schedule for Nonadaptive and Adaptive Personality (SNAP), the Revised Psychopathy Checklist (PCL-R), and review of correctional records. Descriptive information for the STAXI scales and internal consistency data are presented. Trait Anger was significantly higher than State Anger for the youth, but still comparable to adolescent norms. The difference between Anger-In and Anger-Out scale scores was not significant. Unexpectedly, Anger Control scale scores were significantly higher than Anger Out scale scores, clinically consistent with efforts by some of these boys to resist sadistic impulses. Those four (31%) participants who met criteria for sadistic personality had significantly higher Anger-Out scale scores than those without the disorder, and were also higher on Trait Anger to a marginally significant degree. Psychopathy was significantly negatively associated with Anger Control. This study is intended to contribute to the scant literature on juvenile sexual homicide, and lends some support to the validity and utility of sadistic personality disorder as a diagnosis in younger forensic populations. The findings did not support the contention that this form of violence is necessarily an outgrowth of excessive anger.\n\nTest Review: Kovacs, M. \"Children's Depression Inventory 2 (CDI 2)\" (2nd ed.).

Numerous studies have already demonstrated the utility of very-high resolution satellite and aerial images for the elaboration of inventories based on semi-automatic methods or visual image interpretation. Nevertheless, such semi-automatic methods are rarely used in an operational context after major triggering events; this is partly due to access limitations on the required input datasets (i.e. VHR satellite images) and to the absence of dedicated services (i.e. processing chain) available for the landslide community. Several on-going initiatives allow to overcome these limitations. First, from a data perspective, the launch of the Sentinel-2 mission offers opportunities for the design of an operational service that can be deployed for landslide inventory mapping at any time and everywhere on the globe. Second, from an implementation perspective, the Geohazards Exploitation Platform (GEP) of the European Space Agency (ESA) allows the integration and diffusion of on-line processing algorithms in a high computing performance environment. Third, from a community perspective, the recently launched Landslide Pilot of the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS), has targeted the take-off of such service as a main objective for the landslide community. Within this context, this study targets the development of a largely automatic, supervised image processing chain for landslide inventory mapping from bi-temporal (before and after a given event) Sentinel-2 optical images. The processing chain combines change detection methods, image segmentation, higher-level image features (e.g. texture, shape) and topographic variables. Based on a few representative examples provided by a human operator, a machine learning model is trained and\n\nSelf-talk and affective problems in college students: valence of thinking and cognitive content specificity.\n\nPubMed\n\nCalvete, Esther; EstÃ©vez, Ana; LandÃ­n, Covadonga; MartÃ­nez, Yolanda; CardeÃ±oso, Olga; VillardÃ³n, Lourdes; Villa, Aurelio\n\n2005-05-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to develop a Self-Talk Inventory for young adults. This inventory consisted of two scales. The Negative Self-Talk Scale included three categories of self-talk (depressive, anxious, and angry thoughts) and the Positive Self-Talk Scale, three categories (minimization, positive orientation, and coping self-instructions). Participants were 982 undergraduate students (Mean age = 20.35 years, SD = 2.16). They completed the self-talk scales together with the following scales to measure symptoms of affective disorders: the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), and the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI-T). Factor analyses confirmed the hypothesized structure for the Self-Talk Inventory. The relations between self-talk and symptoms of affective disorders (depression, anxiety, and anger) were also evaluated. In general, states-of-mind -SOM- ratios and negative cognitions showed a greater association with psychological symptoms than did positive cognitions. Results concerning the cognitive characteristics of depression, anxiety, and anger were mixed and partially supported the cognitive content specificity theory.\n\n[County-scale N2O emission inventory of China's manure management system].\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Chuan; Gao, Wei; Zhou, Feng; Chen, Qing; Ying, Na; Xu, Peng; Hou, Xi-Kang\n\n2013-10-01\n\nManure is one of the two largest contributors to China's N2O emission. By using the county-scale activity data and the regional emission factors and related parameters with spatial differentiation in China in 2008, this paper assessed the N2O emission loading, sources profile, spatial pattern, and uncertainty, aimed to establish a high-resolution N2O emission inventory of China's manure management system in 2008. As compared with the research results based on the IPCC, EDGAR, and other works, the proposed emission inventory was more reliable and comprehensive. The total China' s N2O emission from manure in 2008 was estimated as 572 Gg, among which, the emission from the manure except pasture/range/paddock was 322 Gg (56.3%), from the manure in pasture/range/paddock was 180 Gg (31.5%), and the indirect emission from atmospheric volatilized N deposition and leaching/runoff was 45.8 Gg (8.0%) and 1.23 Gg (0.2%), respectively. The spatial pattern of China's N2O emission from manure was more centralized, and mainly concentrated in Jilin, Shandong, Sichuan, Hunan, Henan, Heilongjiang, and Liaoning provinces, contributing 52.4% of the total emission, and more than 25% being from 84 counties (only < 3% of the whole counties). The proposed emission inventory had a higher spatial resolution and accuracy. Different with this inventory, the IPCC underestimated the direct emission while overestimated the indirect emission, with the regions of higher emission rate being underestimated by -1.5%-6.0% and those of lower emission rate being overestimated by 1.6%-13%. As for the EDGAR, the regions of higher emission rate were underestimated by -18. 8--50.0%, and those of lower emission rate were mostly overestimated by 25%-54.1%.\n\nRandomized comparison of the Personality Assessment Inventory and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 in the epilepsy monitoring unit.\n\nPubMed\n\nLocke, Dona E C; Kirlin, Kristin A; Wershba, Rebecca; Osborne, David; Drazkowski, Joseph F; Sirven, Joseph I; Noe, Katherine H\n\n2011-08-01\n\nThe two most common personality measures used in evaluation of patients on epilepsy monitoring units (EMUs) are the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI) and the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (MMPI-2). Both have been evaluated separately for their ability to distinguish patients with epilepsy from patients with psychogenic events, but they have never been compared directly. The primary aim of this study was to provide comparison data in an EMU population between the PAI, MMPI-2, and the MMPI-2-RF (MMPI-2 Restructured Form). Results show that the PAI Somatic Complaints (SOM) scale and the Conversion subscale (SOM-C), with classification rates of 79%, outperform other indicators from the PAI and indicators from the MMPI-2 and the MMPI-2-RF. Given its other strengths combined with better diagnostic validity performance, the PAI may be the better personality assessment measure for use in distinguishing patients with epilepsy from those with psychogenic seizures in the EMU.

An independent argument is presented here in support of this prediction based on observational evidence of the ocean's biogeochemical response to natural warming. On time scales from seasonal to centennial, natural O2 flux/heat flux ratios are shown to occur in a range of 2 to 10 nmol O2 per Joule of warming, with larger ratios typically occurring at higher latitudes and over longer time scales. The ratios are several times larger than would be expected solely from the effect of heating on the O2 solubility, indicating that most of the O2 exchange is biologically mediated through links between heating and stratification. The change in oceanic O2 inventory through the 1990's is estimated to be 0.3 - 0.4 x 10(exp 14) mol O2 per year based on scaling the observed anomalous long-term ocean warming by natural O2 flux/heating ratios and allowing for uncertainty due to decadal variability. Implications are discussed for carbon budgets based on observed changes in atmospheric O2/N2 ratio and based on observed changes in ocean dissolved inorganic carbon.\n\nAspergillus fumigatus Increased PAR-2 Expression and Elevated Proinflammatory Cytokines Expression Through the Pathway of PAR-2/ERK1/2 in Cornea.\n\nPubMed\n\nNiu, Yawen; Zhao, Guiqiu; Li, Cui; Lin, Jing; Jiang, Nan; Che, Chengye; Zhang, Jie; Xu, Qiang\n\n2018-01-01\n\nTo determine the role of protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR-2) in cornea infected by Aspergillus fumigatus. PAR-2 was tested in normal and infected corneas of C57BL/6 mice. Mice corneas were infected with A. fumigatus with or without pretreatment of PAR-2 antagonist (FSLLRY-NH2). Polymorphonuclear neutrophilic leukocytes (PMNs) were stimulated with 75% ethanol-killed A. fumigatus with or without pretreatment of FSLLRY-NH2. Disease severity was documented by clinical score and photographs with a slit lamp. PCR, Western blot, and ELISA tested expression of PAR-2, IL-1Î², TNF-Î±, IFN-Î³, MIP-2, and p-ERK1/2. PMN infiltration was assessed by myeloperoxidase assay and immunofluorescent staining. PAR-2 expression was significantly elevated by A. fumigatus, whereas the upregulation was significantly inhibited by FSLLRY-NH2 in mice corneas. FSLLRY-NH2 decreased disease response, PMN infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokine expression compared with infected control. In PMNs, PAR-2 expression was also significantly increased by A. fumigatus, which was significantly inhibited by FSLLRY-NH2. FSLLRY-NH2 significantly inhibited proinflammatory cytokine protein expression, as compared with that in infected control cells, which may be modified by p-ERK1/2. These data provide evidence that A. fumigatus increased PAR-2 expression and elevated disease, PMN infiltration, and proinflammatory cytokine expression through PAR-2, which may be modified by p-ERK1/2.\n\n\"The Incorporation of National Emission Inventories into Version 2 of the Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollutants Inventory\"\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nEPAâs National Emission Inventory has been incorporated into the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research-Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollutants (EDGAR-HTAP) version 2.

X2K first computes enrichment for transcription factors likely to regulate the expression of the differentially expressed genes. The next step of X2K connects these enriched transcription factors through known protein-protein interactions (PPIs) to construct a subnetwork. The final step performs kinase enrichment analysis on the members of the subnetwork. X2K Web is a new implementation of the original eXpression2Kinases algorithm with important enhancements. X2K Web includes many new transcription factor and kinase libraries, and PPI networks. For demonstration, thousands of gene expression signatures induced by kinase inhibitors, applied to six breast cancer cell lines, are provided for fetching directly into X2K Web. The results are displayed as interactive downloadable vector graphic network images and bar graphs. Benchmarking various settings via random permutations enabled the identification of an optimal set of parameters to be used as the default settings in X2K Web.

However, the MMPI-2-RF normative sample is intended to represent the general population of the United States, 26.2% of which met criteria for a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV (APA, 1994 ) disorder in a 12-month period (Kessler, Chiu, Demler, & Walters, 2005 ). In the current study we compare scale elevation rates in the MMPI-2-RF normative sample to prevalence rates of mental disorders primarily drawn from the National Comorbidity Study Replication (Kessler et al., 2005 ). Our objective was to evaluate MMPI-2-RF elevation rates in an epidemiological context. Results indicate that MMPI-2-RF scale elevation rates were generally consistent with epidemiological data when examined in the context of standard interpretation guidelines for the inventory. We also reiterate Ben-Porath and Tellegen's (2008/2011) caution that MMPI-2-RF scale elevations alone are not sufficient to indicate the presence of psychiatric disorder. Rather they are best viewed as indications of the need to evaluate the individual for possible disorder(s). Implications of these results, limitations of this study, and future directions in research are discussed.\n\nHER2 over-expressing high grade endometrial cancer expresses high levels of p95HER2 variant.\n\nPubMed\n\nGrowdon, Whitfield B; Groeneweg, Jolijn; Byron, Virginia; DiGloria, Celeste; Borger, Darrell R; Tambouret, Rosemary; Foster, Rosemary; Chenna, Ahmed; Sperinde, Jeff; Winslow, John; Rueda, Bo R\n\n2015-04-01\n\nSubsets of high grade endometrial cancer (EnCa) over-express HER2 (ERBB2), yet clinical trials have failed to demonstrate any anti-tumor activity utilizing trastuzumab, an approved platform for HER2 positive breast cancer (BrCa). A truncated p95HER2 variant lacking the trastuzumab binding site may confer resistance. The objective of this investigation was to characterize the expression of the p95HER2 truncated variant in EnCa. With institutional approval, 86 high grade EnCa tumors were identified with tumor specimens from surgeries performed between 2000 and 2011. Clinical data were collected and all specimens underwent tumor genotyping, HER2 immunohistochemistry (IHC, HercepTestÂ®), HER2 fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), along with total HER2 (H2T) and p95HER2 assessment with VeraTagÂ® testing. Regression models were used to compare a cohort of 86 breast tumors selected for equivalent HER2 protein expression. We identified 44 high grade endometrioid and 42 uterine serous carcinomas (USC). IHC identified high HER2 expression (2+ or 3+) in 59% of the tumors. HER2 gene amplification was observed in 16 tumors (12 USC, 4 endometrioid). Both HER2 gene amplification and protein expression correlated with H2T values. High p95HER2 expression above 2.8RF/mm2 was observed in 53% (n=54) with significant correlation with H2T levels. When matched to a cohort of 107 breast tumors based on HercepTest HER2 expression, high grade EnCa presented with higher p95 levels (p<0.001). These data demonstrate that compared to BrCa, high grade EnCa expresses higher levels of p95HER2 possibly providing rationale for the trastuzumab resistance observed in EnCa.

The data basis was an online survey of 2000 inhabitants of Denmark. A principle component analysis on the translated DAX-short confirmed the 4-factor solution of the original study differentiating between (1) personal physical aggressive expression, (2) use of a vehicle to express anger, (3) verbal aggressive expression and (4) adaptive/constructive expression. In case of cycling, the factor \"use of a vehicle to express anger\" only included one item and was left out. Based on the results, reliable subscales were developed. Drivers scored higher in verbal aggressive expression than cyclists, while there was no significant difference in constructive expression. The subscales for drivers and cyclists showed significant relations to age, gender, self-reported aggressive behaviours and traffic fines: Women scored for instance lower in physical expression, while older people scored higher in constructive expression. The effect of age and gender on anger expression among drivers and cyclists remained significant when controlling for exposure and other factors in linear regression analyses.

In this study, we evaluated HIG2 protein expression in 332 uterine cancers (186 UCCs and 146 EMCs) and examined the relationship between HIG2 protein expression and clinical factors, including prognosis. Totally, HIG2 expression was detected in 58% of UCC and 66% of EMC. However, there was no significant relationship between HIG2 expression and age, clinical stage and histology in either UCC or EMC. In addition, HIG2 protein expression was not related to prognosis of UCC or EMC. The positivity rate of HIG2 protein was 56% and 61% in early-stage UCC and EMC, respectively and 67% in non-squamous cell carcinoma of UCC. The positivity rate of HIG2 protein was high even in early-stage UCC and EMC\n\nThe Hispanic Stress Inventory Version 2: Improving the assessment of acculturation stress.\n\nPubMed\n\nCervantes, Richard C; Fisher, Dennis G; Padilla, Amado M; Napper, Lucy E\n\n2016-05-01\n\nThis article reports on a 2-phase study to revise the Hispanic Stress Inventory (HSI; Cervantes, Padilla, & Salgado de Snyder, 1991). The necessity for a revised stress-assessment instrument was determined by demographic and political shifts affecting Latin American immigrants and later-generation Hispanics in the United States in the 2 decades since the development of the HSI. The data for the revision of the HSI (termed the HSI2) was collected at 4 sites: Los Angeles, El Paso, Miami, and Boston, and included 941 immigrants and 575 U.S.-born Hispanics and a diverse population of Hispanic subgroups. The immigrant version of the HSI2 includes 10 stress subscales, whereas the U.S.-born version includes 6 stress subscales. Both versions of the HSI2 are shown to possess satisfactory Cronbach's alpha reliabilities and demonstrate expert-based content validity, as well as concurrent validity when correlated with subscales of the Brief Symptom Inventory (Derogatis, 1993) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (Kroenke, Spitzer, & Williams, 2001). The new HSI2 instruments are recommended for use by clinicians and researchers interested in assessing psychosocial stress among diverse Hispanic populations of various ethnic subgroups, age groups, and geographic location.

Several factors appear to influence the patient's ability to adjust to the postoperative condition, but reliable predictors are lacking. The aim of this study was to assess whether psychological presurgical variables can predict outcome of vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) in the short term. 38 severely obese patients (6 men and 32 women) underwent laparoscopic VBG. All were assessed prospectively at TO (before surgery) and at T6 (6 months after surgery) with a semi-structured interview and a battery of psychological tests: State Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI), Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI-2), Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Binge Eating Scale (BES), Body Shape Questionnaire (BSQ), and (only at TO) the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI). The comparison between TO and T6 found a significant weight loss and an improvement in several dimensions of EDI-2, BDI, and BSQ, together with an increase in the frequency of vomiting. Self-directedness (TCI) and Body Dissatisfaction (EDI-2) appear to be predictors of short-term outcome regarding weight loss. Self-transcendence (TCI) is associated with emerging side-effects. Although larger and longer studies are necessary to confirm these data, Self directedness and Self trascendence emerge as predictors of 6 months clinical and psychological outcome of VBG.\n\nThe Hispanic Stress Inventory Version 2: Improving the Assessment of Acculturation Stress\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCervantes, Richard C.; Fisher, Dennis G.; Padilla, Amado M.; Napper, Lucy E.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis paper reports on a two-phase study to revise the Hispanic Stress Inventory (HSI) (Cervantes, Padilla, & Salgado de Snyder, 1991).

We utilized a sample of 712 police officer candidates (82.6% male) from 2 Midwestern police departments. The sample included 426 hired officers, most of whom had supervisor ratings of problem behaviors and human resource records of civilian complaints. With the full sample, we calculated zero-order correlations between MMPI-2-RF scale scores and scale scores from the California Psychological Inventory (Gough, 1956) and Inwald Personality Inventory (Inwald, 2006) by gender. In the hired sample, we correlated MMPI-2-RF scale scores with the outcome data for males only, owing to the relatively small number of hired women. Several scales demonstrated meaningful correlations with the criteria, particularly in the thought dysfunction and behavioral/externalizing dysfunction domains. After applying a correction for range restriction, the correlation coefficient magnitudes were generally in the moderate to large range. The practical implications of these findings were explored by means of risk ratio analyses, which indicated that officers who produced elevations at cutscores lower than the traditionally used 65 T-score level were as much as 10 times more likely than those scoring below the cutoff to exhibit problem behaviors. Overall, the results supported the validity of the MMPI-2-RF in this setting. Implications and limitations of this study are discussed. 2015 APA, all rights reserved\n\nRadionuclide inventories : ORIGEN2.2 isotopic depletion calculation for high burnup low-enriched uranium and weapons-grade mixed-oxide pressurized-water reactor fuel assemblies.\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nGauntt, Randall O.; Ross, Kyle W.; Smith, James Dean\n\n2010-04-01\n\nThe Oak Ridge National Laboratory computer code, ORIGEN2.2 (CCC-371, 2002), was used to obtain the elemental composition of irradiated low-enriched uranium (LEU)/mixed-oxide (MOX) pressurized-water reactor fuel assemblies. Described in this report are the input parameters for the ORIGEN2.2 calculations. The rationale for performing the ORIGEN2.2 calculation was to generate inventories to be used to populate MELCOR radionuclide classes. Therefore the ORIGEN2.2 output was subsequently manipulated. The procedures performed in this data reduction process are also described herein. A listing of the ORIGEN2.2 input deck for two-cycle MOX is provided in the appendix. The final output from this data reduction processmoreÂ Â» was three tables containing the radionuclide inventories for LEU/MOX in elemental form.

Its protein is overexpressed in many human cancers. SLP-2 can contribute to the promotion of cell growth, cell adhesion, and tumorigenesis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and lymph node metastasis in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical detection of SLP-2, estrogen and progesterone receptors, and HER-2/neu were performed on 263 cases of primary invasive breast cancer with a tissue microarray. Of 263 cases, 138 (52.5%) showed high expression of SLP-2 protein, and 125 (47.5%) showed low or absent expression. In addition, there were significant positive associations between tumor stage and size (P = .020), lymph node metastasis (P < .001), clinical stage (P < .001), distant metastasis (P = .002), and HER-2/neu protein expression (P = .037) and high-level SLP-2 expression. High-level SLP-2 expression was associated with decreased overall survival (P = .011) and was more often found in patients with tumors larger than 20 mm, lymph node metastasis, advanced clinical stage, distant metastasis, and HER-2/neu protein-positive expression. More important, lymph node metastasis, HER-2/neu-positive expression, and high-level SLP-2 expression were associated with significantly decreased survival.\n\nA New Global Anthropogenic SO2 Emission Inventory for the Last Decade: A Mosaic of Satellite-derived and Bottom-up Emissions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLiu, F.; Joiner, J.; Choi, S.; Krotkov, N. A.; Li, C.; Fioletov, V. E.; McLinden, C. A.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nSulfur dioxide (SO2) measurements from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite sensor have been used to detect emissions from large point sources using an innovative estimation technique. Emissions from about 500 sources have been quantified individually based on OMI observations, accounting for about a half of total reported anthropogenic SO2 emissions. We developed a new emission inventory, OMI-HTAP, by combining these OMI-based emission estimates and the conventional bottom-up inventory. OMI-HTAP includes OMI-based estimates for over 400 point sources and is gap-filled with the emission grid map of the latest available global bottom-up emission inventory (HTAP v2.2) for the rest of sources. We have evaluated the OMI-HTAP inventory by performing simulations with the Goddard Earth Observing System version 5 (GEOS-5) model. The GEOS-5 simulated SO2 concentrations driven by both the HTAP and the OMI-HTAP inventory were compared against in-situ and satellite measurements. Results show that the OMI-HTAP inventory improves the model agreement with observations, in particular over the US, India and the Middle East. Additionally, simulations with the OMI-HTAP inventory capture the major trends of anthropogenic SO2 emissions over the world and highlight the influence of missing sources in the bottom-up inventory.\n\nAstrocytes express functional TRPV2 ion channels.\n\nPubMed\n\nShibasaki, Koji; Ishizaki, Yasuki; Mandadi, Sravan\n\n2013-11-15\n\nThermosensitive transient receptor potential (thermo TRP) channels are important for sensory transduction. Among them, TRPV2 has an interesting characteristic of being activated by very high temperature (>52 Â°C). In addition to the heat sensor function, TRPV2 also acts as a mechanosensor, an osomosensor and a lipid sensor. It has been reported that TRPV2 is expressed in heart, intestine, pancreas and sensory nerves. In the central nervous system, neuronal TRPV2 expression was reported, however, glial expression and the precise roles of TRPV2 have not been determined. To explore the functional expression of TRPV2 in astrocytes, the expression was determined by histological and physiological methods. Interestingly, TRPV2 expression was detected in plasma membrane of astrocytes, and the astrocytic TRPV2 was activated by very high temperature (>50 Â°C) consistent with the reported characteristic. We revealed that the astrocytic TRPV2 was also activated by lysophosphatidylcholine, a known endogenous lipid ligand for TRPV2, suggesting that astrocytic TRPV2 might regulate neuronal activities in response to lipid metabolism. Thus, for the first time we revealed that TRPV2 is functionally expressed in astrocytes in addition to neurons. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

P450 expression was monitored using metabolic activity, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot analyses, and the identity of the proteins was confirmed through N-terminus microsequence analysis. PY caused a dose-dependent elevation of hepatic CYP2B1/B2B levels in rats, which ranged from 4- to 22-fold over the dosing regimen of 100 to 400 mg PY/kg/day, for 3 days, respectively. PY at low dose failed to induce CYP2B in rabbit hepatic tissue, suggesting a species-dependent response in 2B expression. Anti-2B1 IgG addition to PY-induced microsomes inhibited benzphetamine N-demethylase activity by only approximately 15%, in sharp contrast to the approximately 73% inhibition observed for phenobarbital-induced microsomes, suggesting the induction of other form(s) of P450 having benzphetamine N-demethylase activity. Northern blot analysis revealed that PY treatment increased 2B1 and 2B2 poly(A)+ RNA levels approximately 69- and approximately 34-fold, respectively, whereas the 2E1 poly(A)+ RNA levels failed to increase. The results of this study show that PY induces CYP2B1/2B2 and that induction is species-dependent and kinetically distinguishable from 2E1 induction. Moreover, 2B1/2B2 induction occurs as a result of elevated mRNA levels associated with either transcriptional activation or mRNA stabilization, and it differs from the mechanism of hepatic 2E1 induction by PY.\n\nPharmacologic modulation of ACE2 expression.\n\nPubMed\n\nSoler, MarÃ­a JosÃ©; Barrios, Clara; Oliva, Raymond; Batlle, Daniel\n\n2008-10-01\n\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzymatically active homologue of angiotensin-converting enzyme that degrades angiotensin I, angiotensin II, and other peptides. Recent studies have shown that under pathologic conditions, ACE2 expression in the kidney is altered. In this review, we briefly summarize recent studies dealing with pharmacologic interventions that modulate ACE2 expression. ACE2 amplification may have a potential therapeutic role for kidney disease and hypertension.\n\nTransgenic expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) causes premature aging phenotypes in mice.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Joohwee; Vaish, Vivek; Feng, Mingxiao; Field, Kevin; Chatzistamou, Ioulia; Shim, Minsub\n\n2016-10-07\n\nCyclooxygenase (COX) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of prostanoids, lipid signaling molecules that regulate various physiological processes. COX2, one of the isoforms of COX, is highly inducible in response to a wide variety of cellular and environmental stresses. Increased COX2 expression is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of many age-related diseases. COX2 expression is also reported to be increased in the tissues of aged humans and mice, which suggests the involvement of COX2 in the aging process. However, it is not clear whether the increased COX2 expression is causal to or a result of aging. We have now addressed this question by creating an inducible COX2 transgenic mouse model. Here we show that post-natal expression of COX2 led to a panel of aging-related phenotypes. The expression of p16, p53, and phospho-H2AX was increased in the tissues of COX2 transgenic mice. Additionally, adult mouse lung fibroblasts from COX2 transgenic mice exhibited increased expression of the senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase. Our study reveals that the increased COX2 expression has an impact on the aging process and suggests that modulation of COX2 and its downstream signaling may be an approach for intervention of age-related disorders.\n\nEmissions inventory of PM2.5 trace elements across the United States\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAdam Reff; Prakash V. Bhave; Heather Simon\n\n2009-08-15\n\nThis paper presents the first National Emissions Inventory (NEI) of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) that includes the full suite of PM2.5 trace elements (atomic number >10) measured at ambient monitoring sites across the U.S. PM2.5 emissions in the NEI were organized and aggregated into a set of 84 source categories for which chemical speciation profiles are available (e.g., Unpaved Road Dust, Agricultural Soil, Wildfires). Emission estimates for ten metals classified as Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAP) were refined using data from a recent HAP NEI. All emissions were spatially gridded, and U.S. emissions maps for dozens of trace elements (e.g., Fe,moreÂ Â» Ti) are presented for the first time. Nationally, the trace elements emitted in the highest quantities are silicon (3.8 x 10{sup 5} ton/yr), aluminium (1.4 x 10{sup 5} ton/yr), and calcium (1.3 x 10{sup 5} ton/yr). Our chemical characterization of the PM2.5 inventory shows that most of the previously unspeciated emissions are comprised of crustal elements, potassium, sodium, chlorine, and metal-bound oxygen. Coal combustion is the largest source of S, Se, Sr, Hg and primary sulfates. This work also reveals that the largest PM2.5 sources lacking specific speciation data are off-road diesel-powered mobile equipment, road construction dust, marine vessels, gasoline-powered boats, and railroad locomotives. 28 refs., 4 figs.Â«Â less\n\nDifferential expression of homeobox-containing genes Msx-1 and Msx-2 and homeoprotein Msx-2 expression during chick craniofacial development.\n\nPubMed\n\nNishikawa, K; Nakanishi, T; Aoki, C; Hattori, T; Takahashi, K; Taniguchi, S\n\n1994-03-01\n\nThe expression pattern of chick Msx-1 and Msx-2 homeobox genes in craniofacial primordia was examined by in situ hybridization using cRNA probes. Both genes were expressed in the distal region of the facial primordia, where the distribution of Msx-2 expression was restricted distally within the Msx-1 expression domain. On the contrary, Msx-2 expression in the lateral choroid plexus and cranial skull was broader and more intensive than Msx-1 expression. Our findings suggest that these two genes cooperate to play differential roles in craniofacial development. Msx-2 protein was detected immunohistochemically, and its localization essentially corresponded to the mRNA expression pattern, substantiating the involvement of Msx-2 protein as a transcriptional regulator in developing limb and face.\n\nWW LCI v2: A second-generation life cycle inventory model for chemicals discharged to wastewater systems.\n\nPubMed\n\nKalbar, Pradip P; MuÃ±oz, Ivan; Birkved, Morten\n\n2018-05-01\n\nWe present a second-generation wastewater treatment inventory model, WW LCI 2.0, which on many fronts represents considerable advances compared to its previous version WW LCI 1.0. WW LCI 2.0 is a novel and complete wastewater inventory model integrating WW LCI 1.0, i.e. a complete life cycle inventory, including infrastructure requirement, energy consumption and auxiliary materials applied for the treatment of wastewater and disposal of sludge and SewageLCI, i.e. fate modelling of chemicals released to the sewer. The model is expanded to account for different wastewater treatment levels, i.e. primary, secondary and tertiary treatment, independent treatment by septic tanks and also direct discharge to natural waters. Sludge disposal by means of composting is added as a new option. The model also includes a database containing statistics on wastewater treatment levels and sludge disposal patterns in 56 countries. The application of the new model is demonstrated using five chemicals assumed discharged to wastewater systems in four different countries. WW LCI 2.0 model results shows that chemicals such as diethylenetriamine penta (methylene phosphonic acid) (DTPMP) and Diclofenac, exhibit lower climate change (CC) and freshwater ecotoxicity (FET) burdens upon wastewater treatment compared to direct discharge in all country scenarios. Results for Ibuprofen and Acetaminophen (more readily degradable) show that the CC burden depends on the country-specific levels of wastewater treatment. Higher treatment levels lead to lower CC and FET burden compared to direct discharge. WW LCI 2.0 makes it possible to generate complete detailed life cycle inventories and fate analyses for chemicals released to wastewater systems. Our test of the WW LCI 2.0 model with five chemicals illustrates how the model can provide substantially different outcomes, compared to conventional wastewater inventory models, making the inventory dependent upon the atomic composition of the molecules\n\nExpression and Functional Pathway Analysis of Nuclear Receptor NR2F2 in Ovarian Cancer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHawkins, Shannon M.; Loomans, Holli A.; Wan, Ying-Wooi; Ghosh-Choudhury, Triparna; Coffey, Donna; Xiao, Weimin; Liu, Zhandong; Sangi-Haghpeykar, Haleh\n\n2013-01-01\n\nContext: Recent evidence implicates the orphan nuclear receptor, nuclear receptor subfamily 2, group F, member 2 (NR2F2; chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II) as both a master regulator of angiogenesis and an oncogene in prostate and other human cancers. Objective: The objective of the study was to determine whether NR2F2 plays a role in ovarian cancer and dissect its potential mechanisms of action. Design, Setting, and Patients: We examined NR2F2 expression in healthy ovary and ovarian cancers using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. NR2F2 expression was targeted in established ovarian cancer cell lines to assess the impact of dysregulated NR2F2 expression in the epithelial compartment of ovarian cancers. Results: Our results indicate that NR2F2 is robustly expressed in the stroma of healthy ovary with little or no expression in epithelia lining the ovarian surface, clefts, or crypts. This pattern of NR2F2 expression was markedly disrupted in ovarian cancers, in which decreased levels of stromal expression and ectopic epithelial expression were frequently observed. Ovarian cancers with the most disrupted patterns of NR2F2 were associated with significantly shorter disease-free interval by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Targeting NR2F2 expression in established ovarian cancer cell lines enhanced apoptosis and increased proliferation. In addition, we found that NR2F2 regulates the expression of NEK2, RAI14, and multiple other genes involved in the cell cycle, suggesting potential pathways by which dysregulated expression of NR2F2 impacts ovarian cancer. Conclusions: These results uncover novel roles for NR2F2 in ovarian cancer and point to a unique scenario in which a single nuclear receptor plays potentially distinct roles in the stromal and epithelial compartments of the same tissue.

MMPI-2-RF scores were collected from preemployment psychological evaluations of 136 male police officers, and supervisor ratings of performance and problem behavior were subsequently obtained during the initial probationary period. The sample produced meaningfully lower and less variant substantive scale scores than the general population and the MMPI-2-RF Police Candidate comparison group, which significantly affected effect sizes for the zero-order correlations. After applying a correction for range restriction, MMPI-2-RF substantive scales demonstrated moderate to strong associations with criteria, particularly in the Emotional Dysfunction and Interpersonal Functioning domains. Relative risk ratio analyses showed that cutoffs of 45T and 50T maintained reasonable selection ratios because of the exceptionally low scores in this sample and were associated with significantly increased risk for problematic behavior. These results provide support for the predictive validity of the MMPI-2-RF substantive scales in this setting. Implications of these findings and limitations of these results are discussed.

N2O is emitted from a variety of sources, predominantly from agriculture. Annual UK emission estimates are reported, to comply with government commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The UK N2O inventory follows internationally agreed protocols and emission estimates are derived by applying emission factors to estimates of (anthropogenic) emission sources. This approach is useful for comparing anthropogenic emissions from different countries, but does not capture regional differences and inter-annual variability associated with environmental factors (such as climate and soils) and agricultural management. In recent years, the UK inventory approach has been refined to include regional information into its emissions estimates (e.g. agricultural management data), in an attempt to reduce uncertainty. This study attempts to assess the difference between current published inventory methodology (default IPCC methodology) and a revised approach, which incorporates the latest thinking, using data from recent work. For 2013, emission estimates made using the revised approach were 30 % lower than those made using default IPCC methodology, due to the use of lower emission factors suggested by recent projects (www.ghgplatform.org.uk, Defra projects: AC0116, AC0213 and MinNO). The 2013 emissions estimates were disaggregated on a monthly basis using agricultural management (e.g. sowing dates), climate data and soil properties. The temporally disaggregated emission maps were used as input to the Met Office atmospheric dispersion model NAME, for comparison with measured N2O concentrations, at three observation stations (Tacolneston, E England; Ridge Hill, W England; Mace Head, W Ireland) in the UK DECC network (Deriving Emissions linked to Climate Change). The Mace Head site, situated on the west coast of Ireland, was\n\n[Psychometric properties of the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI-2) in adolescents].\n\nPubMed\n\nSalbach-Andrae, Harriet; Schneider, Nora; BÃ¼rger, Arne; Pfeiffer, Ernst; Lehmkuhl, Ulrike; Holzhausen, Martin\n\n2010-05-01\n\nThe present study examines the psychometric properties of the German version of the Eating Disorder Inventory EDI-2 (1997) in 371 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years. Internal consistency, convergent and divergent validity were examined and a confirmatory factor analysis was conducted. Internal consistency was high for the group of patients and satisfactory for both control groups. Associations with other clinical instruments point in the expected direction and support the external validity of the EDI-2. The EDI-2 differentiated very well between the group of eating disorder patients (n=71) and the female (n=150) and male control groups (n=150). A discriminant analysis demonstrated that 86.0% of the cases were correctly classified, and a confirmatory factor analysis largely supported the six-factor structure generated by the German version of the EDI-2 (Thiel et al., 1997).\n\nA Russian version of the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory: preliminary data.\n\nPubMed\n\nEckhardt, C I; Kassinove, H; Tsytsarev, S V; Sukhodolsky, D G\n\n1995-06-01\n\nSpielberger's (1988) State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory represents a conceptual advance over previous anger measures. It measures both immediate anger experiences and longer term dispositions to experience anger, as well as modes of anger expression. In American samples, the inventory has been shown to be both internally consistent and conceptually valid. This study presents initial data on a Russian version of the inventory. Our subjects were 120 students from St. Petersburg University and 31 psychiatric patients from the St. Petersburg Top Security Hospital. The results provide initial support for Spielberger's factorial model of anger in a Russian sample. All of the scales, with the exception of Anger-In, showed good alpha coefficients, and the means were generally similar to those found in American subgroups. Russian men scored higher on Anger-Out than did Russian women. Determination of subgroup norms in larger samples will allow us to explore further the cross-national similarity of anger in Russia and America.\n\nTemporal comparison of global inventories of CO2 emissions from biomass burning during 2002-2011 derived from remotely sensed data.\n\nPubMed\n\nShi, Yusheng; Matsunaga, Tsuneo\n\n2017-07-01\n\nBiomass burning is a large important source of greenhouse gases and atmospheric aerosols, and can contribute greatly to the temporal variations of CO 2 emissions at regional and global scales. In this study, we compared four globally gridded CO 2 emission inventories from biomass burning during the period of 2002-2011, highlighting the similarities and differences in seasonality and interannual variability of the CO 2 emissions both at regional and global scales. The four datasets included Global Fire Emissions Database 4s with small fires (GFED4s), Global Fire Assimilation System 1.0 (GFAS1.0), Fire INventory from NCAR 1.0 (FINN1.0), and Global Inventory for Chemistry-Climate studies-GFED4s (G-G). The results showed that in general, the four inventories presented consistent temporal trend but with large differences as well. Globally, CO 2 emissions of GFED4s, GFAS1.0, and G-G all peaked in August with the exception in FINN1.0, which recorded another peak in annual March. The interannual trend of all datasets displayed an overall decrease in CO 2 emissions during 2002-2011, except for the inconsistent FINN1.0, which showed a tendency to increase during the considered period. Meanwhile, GFED4s and GFAS1.0 noted consistent agreement from 2002 to 2011 at both global (R 2 Â >Â 0.8) and continental levels (R 2 Â >Â 0.7). FINN1.0 was found to have the poorest temporal correlations with the other three inventories globally (R 2 Â <Â 0.6). The lower estimation in savanna CO 2 emissions and higher calculation in cropland CO 2 emissions by FINN1.0 from 2002 to 2011 was the primary reason for the temporal differences of the four inventories. Besides, the contributions of the three land covers (forest, savanna, and cropland) on CO 2 emissions in each region varied greatly within the year (>80%) but showed small variations through the years (<40%).\n\nAntipsychotics increase vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2) expression in thalamolimbic pathways.\n\nPubMed\n\nMoutsimilli, Larissa; Farley, Severine; El Khoury, Marie-Anne; Chamot, Christophe; Sibarita, Jean-Baptiste; Racine, Victor; El Mestikawy, Salah; Mathieu, Flavie; Dumas, Sylvie; Giros, Bruno; Tzavara, Eleni T\n\n2008-03-01\n\nRecently the two vesicular-glutamate-transporters VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 have been cloned and characterized. VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 together label all glutamatergic neurons, but because of their distinct expression patterns in the brain they facilitate our ability to define between a VGLUT1-positive cortical and a VGLUT2-positive subcortical glutamatergic systems. We have previously demonstrated an increased cortical VGLUT1 expression as marker of antidepressant activity. Here, we assessed the effects of different psychotropic drugs on brain VGLUT2 mRNA and protein expression. The typical antipsychotic haloperidol, and the atypicals clozapine and risperidone increased VGLUT2 mRNA selectively in the central medial/medial parafascicular, paraventricular and intermediodorsal thalamic nuclei; VGLUT2 protein was accordingly amplified in paraventricular and ventral striatum and in prefrontal cortex. The antidepressants fluoxetine and desipramine and the sedative anxiolytic diazepam had no effect. These results highlight the implication of thalamo-limbic glutamatergic pathways in the action of antipsychotics. Increased VGLUT2 expression in these neurons might constitute a marker for antipsychotic activity and subcortical glutamate neurotransmission might be a possible novel target for future generation antipsychotics.\n\nA Serious Videogame as an Additional Therapy Tool for Training Emotional Regulation and Impulsivity Control in Severe Gambling Disorder\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTÃ¡rrega, SalomÃ©; Castro-Carreras, Laia; FernÃ¡ndez-Aranda, Fernando; Granero, Roser; Giner-BartolomÃ©, Cristina; AymamÃ­, Neus; GÃ³mez-PeÃ±a, MÃ³nica; SantamarÃ­a, Juan J.; Forcano, Laura; Steward, Trevor; MenchÃ³n, JosÃ© M.; JimÃ©nez-Murcia, Susana\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground: Gambling disorder (GD) is characterized by a significant lack of self-control and is associated with impulsivity-related personality traits. It is also linked to deficits in emotional regulation and frequently co-occurs with anxiety and depression symptoms. There is also evidence that emotional dysregulation may play a mediatory role between GD and psychopathological symptomatology. Few studies have reported the outcomes of psychological interventions that specifically address these underlying processes. Objectives: To assess the utility of the Playmancer platform, a serious video game, as an additional therapy tool in a CBT intervention for GD, and to estimate pre-post changes in measures of impulsivity, anger expression and psychopathological symptomatology. Method: The sample comprised a single group of 16 male treatment-seeking individuals with severe GD diagnosis. Therapy intervention consisted of 16 group weekly CBT sessions and, concurrently, 10 additional weekly sessions of a serious video game. Pre-post treatment scores on South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11), I7 Impulsiveness Questionnaire (I7), State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory 2 (STAXI-2), Symptom Checklist-Revised (SCL-90-R), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S-T), and Novelty Seeking from the Temperament and Character Inventory-Revised (TCI-R) were compared. Results: After the intervention, significant changes were observed in several measures of impulsivity, anger expression and other psychopathological symptoms. Dropout and relapse rates during treatment were similar to those described in the literature for CBT. Conclusion: Complementing CBT interventions for GD with a specific therapy approach like a serious video game might be helpful in addressing certain underlying factors which are usually difficult to change, including impulsivity and anger expression.
