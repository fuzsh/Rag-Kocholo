        "text": "This review paper contains the control strategies used for the working of distillation and how they are applied using various formulae. It will also give a brief idea of what points a process engineer should keep in mind while deciding the control strategy. Through this paper, one would get to know the basic process control strategies and how to select a suitable strategy for the distillation column to work in the desired way.\n\nFor distillation column design it is necessary to define all the variable parameters such as component concentrations in different streams temperatures, pressures, mass and energy flow, which are used to represent the separation process of some specific system. They are related to each other according to specific laws, and if the number of such parameters exceeds the number of their relationships, in order to solve a problem some of them must be specified in advance or some constraints assumed for the mass balance, the balance of energy, phase equilibria or chemical equilibria. Knowledge of specific elements which are the constituents of a distillation unit must be known to define the number of design parameters as well as some additional apparati also necessary to realize the distilation. Each separate apparatus might be designed and constructed only if all the necessary and variable parameters for such a unit are defined. This is the right route to solve a distilation unit in many..."
