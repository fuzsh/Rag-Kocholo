        "text": "C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase reactant which increases in concentration during inflammation, has been found to bind to human T cells and to inhibit certain of their functions. In the present study CRP was found to display a binding specificity for Ï‘-bearing cells from mouse peripheral lymphoid tissue but not for thymus cells. CRP inhibited the proliferative response in a similar manner in both murine and human mixed lymphocyte reactions. This inhibition was prevented by the addition of the CRP substrate, pneumococcal C-polysaccharide (CPS), and was not a result of toxicity of CRP for lymphocytes. By contrast the response of spleen lymphocytes to mitogenic Con A concentrations was not altered by CRP. CRP also exerted an inhibitory effect on the in vitro generation of cytolytic T lymphocytes (CL) in mixed lymphocyte reactions of mouse spleen cells. The expression of the cytolytic process by T cells sensitized either in vivo or in mixed lymphocyte cultures was not altered in...\n\nAlmost every kind of inflammation in the human body is accompanied by rising C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. This can include bacterial and viral infection, chronic inflammation and so-called sterile inflammation triggered by (internal) acute tissue injury. CRP is part of the ancient humoral immune response and secreted into the circulation by the liver upon respective stimuli. Its main immunological functions are the opsonization of biological particles (bacteria and dead or dying cells) for their clearance by macrophages and the activation of the classical complement pathway. This not only helps to eliminate pathogens and dead cells, which is very useful in any case, but unfortunately also to remove only slightly damaged or inactive human cells that may potentially regenerate with more CRP-free time. CRP action severely aggravates the extent of tissue damage during the acute phase response after an acute injury and therefore negatively affects clinical outcome. CRP is the..."
