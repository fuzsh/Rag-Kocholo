        "text": "DEAR ABBY: I’m sure I am not alone on this subject. Occasionally, when I’m in a restaurant, the mall, the grocery store, etc., I’ll run into a former co-worker, former classmate, someone I met at a past gathering, etc., and in the moment, I cannot recall their name. This is especially embarrassing when my spouse or a friend is with me and I can’t introduce the person.\n\nSometimes, when someone is with me and I see an acquaintance before they see me, I’ll make a detour to avoid the embarrassment of blanking on their names. If I’m alone, I have no problem conversing with the individual even if I can’t recall a name. My problem is those embarrassing introductions. Any suggestions? -- FORGETFUL IN HAWAII\n\nStories by Abigail Van Buren\n\nDear Abby: My cheating husband told our entire church that I was the one having affairs\n\nDear Abby: My boyfriend never wants to do fun things with me. I feel like he's only in this for sex\n\nDear Abby: It’s been 10 years since my divorce and my ex-husband still haunts my dreams\n\nDEAR FORGETFUL: I agree, it IS embarrassing, and it happens to everyone. It happened to me occasionally when I was in my 20s and needed to introduce my date to someone.\n\nThere IS a way to get around it, provided you are fast enough. If a “senior moment” isn’t something you are willing to admit, then greet your old co-worker, friend, etc., and say something like, “Hi! How NICE to see you!” Then turn to your spouse (or friend) and say, “We used to work together,” and let them introduce THEMSELVES."
