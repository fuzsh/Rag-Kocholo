        "text": "DEAR ABBY: I’m sure I am not alone on this subject. Occasionally, when I’m in a restaurant, the mall, the grocery store, etc., I’ll run into a former co-worker, former classmate, someone I met at a past gathering, etc., and in the moment, I cannot recall their name. This is especially embarrassing when my spouse or a friend is with me and I can’t introduce the person.\n\nSometimes, when someone is with me and I see an acquaintance before they see me, I’ll make a detour to avoid the embarrassment of blanking on their names. If I’m alone, I have no problem conversing with the individual even if I can’t recall a name. My problem is those embarrassing introductions. Any suggestions? -- FORGETFUL IN HAWAII\n\nDEAR FORGETFUL: I agree, it IS embarrassing, and it happens to everyone. It happened to me occasionally when I was in my 20s and needed to introduce my date to someone. There IS a way to get around it, provided you are fast enough. If a “senior moment” isn’t something you are willing to admit, then greet your old co-worker, friend, etc., and say something like, “Hi! How NICE to see you!” Then turn to your spouse (or friend) and say, “We used to work together,” and let them introduce THEMSELVES.\n\nStories by Abigail Van Buren\n\nDear Abby: It is very clear that boyfriend only wants one thing\n\nDear Abby: Church deacon is anything but godly\n\nDear Abby: I need my husband to help with this one thing, but he refuses\n\nDear Abby: How do I get over my ex-husband?\n\nDear Abby: I keep setting up friends, and then getting ghosted by both\n\n** ** **\n\nDear Abby is written by Abigail Van Buren, also known as Jeanne Phillips, and was founded by her mother, Pauline Phillips.
