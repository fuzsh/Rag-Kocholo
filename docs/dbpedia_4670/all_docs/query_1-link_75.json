        "text": "Dear Abby: I’m sure I am not alone on this subject. Occasionally, when I’m in a restaurant, the mall, the grocery store, etc., I’ll run into a former co-worker, former classmate, someone I met at a past gathering, etc., and in the moment, I cannot recall their name. This is especially embarrassing when my spouse or a friend is with me and I can’t introduce the person.\n\nSometimes, when someone is with me and I see an acquaintance before they see me, I’ll make a detour to avoid the embarrassment of blanking on their names. If I’m alone, I have no problem conversing with the individual even if I can’t recall a name. My problem is those embarrassing introductions. Any suggestions?\n\n-- Forgetful in Hawaii\n\nDear Forgetful: I agree, it IS embarrassing, and it happens to everyone. It happened to me occasionally when I was in my 20s and needed to introduce my date to someone. There IS a way to get around it, provided you are fast enough. If a “senior moment” isn’t something you are willing to admit, then greet your old co-worker, friend, etc., and say something like, “Hi! How NICE to see you!” Then turn to your spouse (or friend) and say, “We used to work together,” and let them introduce THEMSELVES.\n\nPreviously\n\nDear Abby: I couldn’t handle care of my sister’s big dog, and now she won’t speak to me\n\nDear Abby: My house, I pay the bills, so shouldn’t I get a say in the menu so we don’t waste food?\n\nDear Abby: I suggested to my father that we get counseling; He blew up, got my family to shun me\n\nSee all “Dear Abby” columns"
