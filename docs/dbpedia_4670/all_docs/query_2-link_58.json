        "text": "Whatâs the Difference Between Shame and Guilt?\n\nThese two emotions are often confused with one another. You feel guilt when you know that you did something wrong. It can be a helpful emotion when maintaining relationships. Guilt can keep you on track when youâve drifted from your moral standards.\n\nBut you feel shame when you believe youâre not enough, usually because parents or peers keep telling you so. Your confidence suffers from this deep-seated emotion that affects the way you see yourself.Â\n\nGuilt tells you, âThat thing you did was wrong.â Shame tells you, âBecause you did that thing, youâre a bad person.â\n\nHow Does Shame Become Toxic?\n\nYou probably have felt and will continue to feel shame at various times in your life. Shame can last a few hours or even a few days.\n\nToxic shame, though, comes from constantly being told youâre not enough. It results in negative self-talk that stays with you.\n\nToxic shame can start in the way you were given feedback for certain incidents as a child, usually by a parent. For example, if you wet the bed, your parent might have reacted in one of two ways:â\n\nThey reassured you that it was all right and cleaned up without making a fuss.\n\nThey lashed out at you and said things like, âWhy do you always do this? Whatâs wrong with you?\"\n\nThe second reaction would probably have led you to believe that there was something wrong with you. Your feeling of shame can turn into toxic shame when the second scene keeps repeating. Other repeated phrases that can cause toxic shame, depending on the incident, are:\n\nâWhy are you doing it like that? Youâre wrong.â\n\nâWhat were you thinking?â\n\nâYouâll never be as good as them.â\n\nIf youâre told these things often enough, you might start to tell yourself, for example, âIâm not worthy of love.â And holding onto feelings of unworthiness can be very damaging to your mental and physical health.\n\nBecome aware of how you talk to yourself. Try to observe your own thoughts but not react to them.\n\nHave compassion for yourself. Everyone has flaws and makes mistakes. Even if it seems like your mistakes were huge, accept that youâre only human. Learn from the past, but donât get stuck in it.\n\nPractice mindfulness. Mindfulness and meditation can work wonders as you learn to observe your thoughts. Feeling shame forces you to react, so it can be very powerful to just notice your thoughts and question them.\n\nRecognize when youâre feeling shame. Mindfulness can help alert you to when youâre feeling shame. If you are, mention it to a friend or partner. Shame thrives in dark places, so shine a light on it and watch its power fade away.\n\nâSeek support. A support network can give you an outlet to talk things out when necessary and boost your sense of belonging."
