        "text": "âWhat's in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other name would smell as sweet.â\n\nIn the classic Shakespeare play, Juliet makes the point to Romeo that the convention of naming things holds no real relevance.\n\nBut the choice of name for a child truly does matter as theyâre likely to be stuck with it for the rest of their lives. And in some countries, there are certain names that are outright banned for being embarrassing, offensive or even unpatriotic.\n\nBBC Bitesize takes a look at some of the forbidden baby names that werenât allowed.\n\nFrance: No embarrassing names\n\nItâs fairly normal for parents to want to choose a name with meaning â but less common for that name to be based on a favourite snack.\n\nBut a family in France attempted to name their child Nutella.\n\nIn 2015, a judge in Valenciennes in northern France refused to allow a child to be named after the spread. They expressed concerns over the use of a trademark, but ultimately decided the child couldnât be given that name because of the risk of humiliation.\n\nWhen the parents refused to attend the court hearing, the judge ordered the child be named Ella instead.\n\nWhile the choice of a name that is a trademarked brand wasnât the main concern in this case, other countries have banned similar attempts â with names such as Mercedes or Chanel banned in Switzerland.\n\nSweden: No names which are obviously not names\n\nIn Sweden, there are strict guidelines around what you can or canât call your child â again with the aim of preventing any embarrassment for the child.\n\nSo, itâs not surprising to learn that the name Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssqlbb11116 was not approved.\n\nIn 1996, a Swedish family chose this unusual, 43-character name for their son â to be pronounced, Albin â in protest after they were fined for not registering his name before his fifth birthday. When that was rejected, they then tried to register the name A â again pronounced Albin â which was also turned down. In the end, they relented and named him Albin.\n\nThe names Metallica, Superman, Veranda and Ikea have also fallen foul of the Swedish naming laws.\n\nNew Zealand: No official titles as names\n\nIn New Zealand, the embarrassment rule comes into play again, but there are several other considerations when it comes to approving names.\n\nAny name that might include or resemble an official title or rank is forbidden â and one of the most common of these is Justice.\n\nAs a formal title for a judge, that name is banned, alongside Saint, Bishop, Knight and Mr.\n\nThe other rule for names is that they mustnât be unreasonably long or without justification. So a case in 2008 prompted some surprise that it had slipped through the net.\n\nDuring a custody case for a then nine-year-old girl, a judge discovered that she had been named Talula Does the Hula From Hawaii â a name that, quite reasonably, she hated so much that she never told anybody what she was really called.\n\nThe judge allowed her to change her name â with a severe admonishing for her parents.\n\nJapan: No names that might humiliate\n\nOne name choice in Japan in 1994 was so controversial, it led to a heated debate in a Japanese Cabinet meeting.\n\nA family decided they wanted to call their baby boy Akuma - which literally means devil. The father said he chose the name because he wanted his son to stand out with an unforgettable and completely unique name.\n\nInitially, the name was accepted before officials challenged it, feeling that the name would lead to discrimination."
