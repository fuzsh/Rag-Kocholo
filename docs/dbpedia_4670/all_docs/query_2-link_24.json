        "text": "Introduction\n\nMost human affect is rooted in the social ties with the environment that we are living in. This applies for the pain we feel at others’ injuries (Singer et al., 2004), the joy when witnessing the success of a colleague (Mobbs et al., 2009), the disgust when listening to others’ nauseating stories (Wicker et al., 2003; Jabbi et al., 2008) and the embarrassment we feel on behalf of others’ blunders and pratfalls (Krach et al., 2011; Paulus et al., 2015). The social relation to the target person thereby is an important modulator of such vicarious responses to the emotional events in the environment (Singer et al., 2006; Cheng et al., 2010). This is particularly true for vicarious embarrassment as can be illustrated in everyday life situations. For example, parents cringe only if their children, but not others’ children, act out in public or one flushes only to a fellow student’s blatant ignorance while a similar incident happening to an unrelated other rather evokes amusement (see e.g. Fortune and Newby-Clark, 2008). In this study, we investigate how our social ties and friendship in particular affect the experience of vicarious embarrassment and propose novel neural pathways for how vicarious affect is modulated by social relation.\n\nEarlier studies showed that vicarious embarrassment on behalf of unrelated others’ public flaws, blunders or norm violations is a form of vicarious social pain (Krach et al., 2011, 2015; Müller-Pinzler et al., 2012; Paulus et al., 2015; Melchers et al., 2015). Similar to how physical pain signals injuries of the bodily integrity, social pain signals threats to the social integrity—which undoubtedly is in danger in embarrassing moments (Macdonald and Leary, 2005; Eisenberger, 2012; Paulus et al., 2013, 2015). In the case of embarrassment, the integrity threat results from the expected negative evaluations in the eyes of others (Keltner and Buswell, 1997; Müller-Pinzler et al., 2015) and can also be experienced vicariously (Krach et al., 2011; Müller-Pinzler et al., 2012). The vicarious experience of embarrassment is associated with neural activation of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), the anterior insula (AI) and, if induced strong enough, higher-order somatosensory cortex areas (Paulus et al., 2015). This network of brain regions is also linked to the experience of vicarious physical pain (De Vignemont and Singer, 2006; Lamm et al., 2011) and other forms of vicarious social pain (Immordino-Yang et al., 2009; Masten et al., 2011). These neural pathways are also fundamentally involved in the first-hand experiences of social and physical pain (Eisenberger et al., 2003; Kross et al., 2011; Wager et al., 2013; Müller-Pinzler et al., 2015), supporting the notion that activity of the AI and ACC network represents consciously accessible bodily affect in shared circuits (Keysers and Gazzola, 2006) that can then somehow be articulated in the course of social interactions (Hein et al., 2010).\n\nBesides the involvement of these shared circuits in vicarious embarrassment, one needs to have the capacity to read and understand the potentially negative evaluations of bystanders. Only then one will be able to understand the threats to another’s social integrity. This process of so-called ‘mentalizing’ about others’ evaluations, thoughts and intentions refers to a rather reflective process of perspective taking (Frith and Frith, 2003). The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the temporal poles (TP) thereby are part of a well-defined neural pathway that is engaged when we construct internal models about another person’s mental state (Lieberman, 2007; Hein and Singer, 2008) or experience embarrassment on behalf of another’s public flaws, blunders or norm violations (Paulus et al., 2015).\n\nAs outlined above, the perceived relation to the social target is a highly potent moderator for one’s vicarious emotional responses (Singer et al., 2006; Cheng et al., 2010). Negative experiences of physical or social pain (Singer et al., 2006; Meyer et al., 2012) as well as positive experiences like vicarious reward are modulated by the relations to the social target (Mobbs et al., 2009; Leng and Zhou, 2010). Behavioral data demonstrated that with increasing closeness to a social target participants showed more intense vicarious experiences of physical (Cheng et al., 2010) and social pain (Meyer et al., 2012) and also embarrassment (Fortune and Newby-Clark, 2008; Chekroun and Nugier, 2011). On the level of neural systems, the effect of social closeness on physical and social pain was accordingly accompanied by increased shared circuit activity within the ACC and AI (Cheng et al., 2010; Beeney et al., 2011; Meyer et al., 2012) and increased mPFC engagement (Meyer et al., 2012). It has been argued that the perceived social closeness strengthens the affective link to the other person, which results in the more intense caring for the other’s affect (Cheng et al., 2010). Further, the mental representations of close others are considered to be more vivid and rich and might therefore boost the affective consequences that follow a friend’s social deconstruction during embarrassing moments (Cheng et al., 2010; Meyer et al., 2012).\n\nAnother rationale for the increase of vicarious embarrassment by the perceived social closeness to the target is that observers might be particularly concerned about their own social image. This notion is supported by behavioral studies on vicarious embarrassment, which indicated that social closeness increases the observers’ concerns about their own images while observing inappropriate behaviors of e.g. friends (Fortune and Newby-Clark, 2008). The psychological literature on social identity and group processes has recently characterized comparable effects. There, wrongdoings or inadequate behaviors (e.g. racist attitudes or behaviors) of in-group members pose a threat to one’s own group’s social integrity and yield vicarious shame or guilt to in-group members even in case one is neither involved nor responsible for the other’s norm transgressions (Chekroun and Nugier, 2011; Lickel et al., 2005, 2011). The increased concerns about one’s own social image and the degree of overlap between cognitive representations of self and others (Aron et al., 1991) should thereby enhance self-related thoughts when observing a close other. On the neural systems level, this notion should manifest in greater involvement of the precuneus, a structure known to be involved in self-related thoughts, self-referential processing, representation of the self, as well as the assessment of self-relevant sensations (Cavanna and Trimble, 2006; Northoff et al., 2006; Mazzola et al., 2010). Accordingly, if perceivers are concerned about their friend’s actions to reflect negatively upon themselves, the integration of the precuneus in the neural systems’ pathways that convey vicarious embarrassment should increase.\n\nAccording to this there are two potential models for how social closeness modulates vicarious embarrassment. In the first model, social closeness strengthens the affective link to the other person leading to richer mental representations of close others and a potential increase in mentalizing about the other person’s mind. In the second model, the perceived social closeness to the target might induce concerns about one’s own social image. Based on the above outlined research and theoretical considerations we hypothesized a greater response within the shared circuits of the AI and ACC when cringing in response to the wrongdoings of friends compared with strangers. Second, as one’s friend’s wrongdoings more strongly reflect on oneself compared with those of a stranger we expected the precuneus, a brain region that is involved in the processing of self-related thoughts, to show greater activity while observing your friends’ misbehaviors.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIs it always favorable to keep your friends close? In the present study we examined how the social ties with others affect the vicarious embarrassment on behalf of their flaws, failures or norm violations and unravel pathways that help to understand vicarious embarrassment on the neural systems level. We predicted that vicarious embarrassment would trigger activity within shared circuits as a measure for an empathic sharing of others’ unbearable moments and that this activation would be modulated by the social closeness to the target person. Further, as humans are concerned about their social images, we expected that the cringe worthy behaviors of close friends would trigger precuneus activity as a neural measure of increased self-referential processing.\n\nEmpathizing with others’ predicaments\n\nConfirming earlier studies on the unpleasant emotional experience of vicarious embarrassment (Krach et al., 2011; Paulus et al., 2015), the shared circuits within the AI and ACC (Keysers and Gazzola, 2006), were involved either if participants observed their friends or unrelated strangers in embarrassing conditions. Similarly, activations within the brainstem and thalamus were increased when participants observed a friend or stranger. These activations might reflect how information of bodily arousal going along with vicarious embarrassment is relayed. However, activity within the shared circuits of the AI and ACC was specifically increased if participants observed threats to their friends’ social integrity, supporting the notion that social closeness modulates empathic processes on the level of shared circuits. Further, we corroborated earlier findings that the subjective experience of vicarious embarrassment is indeed linked to AI and ACC activation (Krach et al., 2015; Paulus et al., 2015). However, in the friend condition, the link between neural response and behavior was lower compared with the stranger condition.\n\nIn a classic study, Shearn et al. (1999) could nicely demonstrate that participants showed stronger blushing when observing a friend as compared with a stranger in an embarrassing situation and argued that empathic blushing, such as proper empathy (Davis, 1996), would be particularly influenced by the increased empathic accuracy within friendship and kinship relations (Ickes et al., 1990; Ickes, 1997; Zaki et al., 2009). Our findings are also in line with recent studies on the effect of social closeness on vicarious physical (Cheng et al., 2010) and social pain (Beeney et al., 2011; Meyer et al., 2012) that reported increased shared circuit activity within the ACC and AI if friends compared with strangers were observed. Meyer et al. (2012) made participants observe friends and strangers during social exclusion as a form of social pain, which likewise activated affective pain regions in the ACC and AI—the very same regions that were previously shown to be associated with the direct and firsthand experience of social exclusion (Eisenberger et al., 2003; Eisenberger, 2012). In line with the present findings of an upregulation within shared circuits during the observation of friends vs strangers in embarrassing predicaments, Meyer et al. reported a ‘social closeness effect’ on the experience of social exclusion. Similarly, Cheng et al. (2010) found a comparable ‘social closeness effect’ in the ACC and AI for sharing the physical pain of loved ones compared with strangers. Independent of the (social) pain of others being observed the fact that we have more vivid and rich mental representations of our close friends’ feelings compared with unrelated others eases sharing their affect and accordingly could lead to increased activity in empathy networks. This should be particularly true for sharing a close friend’s embarrassing moments, which are triggered by deviations from social norms. Gaining access to a stranger’s emotionality during such moments is much more effortful compared with sharing a close friend’s thoughts and feelings with whom we spend time on a daily basis and where we thus have more intuitive access to the other’s mind (Ickes, 1997; Zaki et al., 2009; Zaki and Ochsner, 2011). Shared past emotional moments or experiences (e.g. shared grief upon the death of a friend or joint cheering in a sports event) as well as common norms or attitudes (e.g. shared rejection of racism) contribute to a better and more accurate mental representation of close others and accordingly ease empathizing with their situations.\n\nRole of mentalizing\n\nTo gain access to another person’s affect, participants need to form a representation of the other’s mental states (Frith and Frith, 2006). Thus, apart from the direct sharing of the other person’s affective state through mirroring, participants engage in perspective taking to build a model of another’s mind, a process that is associated with neural activity of the mPFC and the TP. Accordingly, in the present study we could show that the mPFC and TP were consistently involved during vicarious embarrassment, also while witnessing friends. This involvement, however, was not modulated by social closeness. We have previously argued that mentalizing should be viewed as a general underlying process to understand vicarious embarrassment. Without mentalizing on others’ minds it is not possible to discern the evaluations in the eyes of bystanders that constitute the threat to the social integrity of the target (Paulus et al., 2015) and to experience this complex social emotion. This is why it was not surprising that we found an upregulation in the mentalizing network independent of the social relation to the humiliated social target.\n\nRole of self-referential processing\n\nA large body of literature in social psychology has shown that people have a strong motivation to feel good about themselves (Tesser, 1988; Baumeister, 1994) and accordingly are concerned about the portrayal of their social images (Mead, 1934; Leary and Kowalski, 1990). Importantly, the own social images are not only fixed and stable across time, but are also continuously (re)constructed and adjusted to the social context. Self-portrayals can thus be highly heterogeneous and incorporate past, present and future selves (Markus and Nurius, 1986; Wilson and Ross, 2001) or differentiate between private (personal) and public (relational, social, and collective) aspects of the self (Robins et al., 1999) which in total constitute a person’s identity. One component that is continuously shaping our social images is the feedback of others (Leary et al., 1995). People give feedback for one’s behaviors and attitudes and their acceptance or rebuttal shapes the social image that one aims to represent. However, also one’s close friends’ (mis)behaviors can impact and endanger our own social images as the social ties to a person may communicate a sharing of certain attitudes, norms and values (Fortune and Newby-Clark, 2008). Observing a friend’s norm violating behavior in a public context (e.g. yelling at the restaurant waiter) thereby may elicit concerns about one’s own social image (Fortune and Newby-Clark, 2008; Chekroun and Nugier, 2011), however, only if one disagrees with the friend’s behavior in that particular moment. Such concerns about one’s own portrayed social image elicit the emotional reaction of embarrassment (Eisenberg, 2000; Tangney and Dearing, 2002; Macdonald and Leary, 2005). Previous research could show that people react to others’ embarrassing circumstances, which also constituted a threat to their own social integrity, by showing signs of appeasement gestures and restitution behavior with the aim to restore their own social image (Semin and Manstead, 1982; Keltner and Buswell, 1997). Interestingly, concerns about the social image evolve relatively early in the human development. Children have a concept of an extended identity from around 8 years onwards and spontaneously report feeling embarrassed on behalf of another child or toddler in their care who commits a faux pas (Bennett et al., 1998). With increasing age children even appear to have a greater preoccupation with their social images and increasingly make judgments concerning others’ evaluations. Around that time a passive audience is already sufficient to induce first-person experiences of embarrassment following rule violations (Bennett et al., 1998). Interestingly, opposed to vicarious embarrassment, first-person experiences of embarrassment are experienced as less devastating in front family members and friends compared with strangers (Macdonald and Davies, 1983; Lewis et al., 1991; Keltner and Buswell, 1997). Likewise, young children were more likely to show displays of embarrassment when dancing in front of strangers as compared with dancing in front of their mothers (Lewis et al., 1991).\n\nIn a similar way, people tend to exert social control over deviant in-group members in order to avoid embarrassment and damage to their own and the group’s social integrity (Chekroun and Nugier, 2011). Studies in the field of group-based emotions have brought up the concept of identity threat which could also mediate the effect of others’ wrongdoings on the personal experience of vicarious embarrassment. Lickel et al. (2004, 2005) showed that group-based emotions such as shame or guilt were elicited when people were afraid of maintaining a positive group identity. Hence, people felt ashamed for another’s wrongdoing when that person’s behavior was relevant to their own social identity and when they feared that the other person’s behavior would negatively reflect upon themselves (Lickel et al., 2005).\n\nTaken together, concerns about one’s own social image might pose a potent additional factor increasing embarrassment-related activation of the ACC and AI in response to a friend’s public failures. The increased activity within the precuneus, which is considered to be a neural correlate of ongoing self-related thoughts and representation of the self (Cavanna and Trimble, 2006; Northoff et al., 2006; Mazzola et al., 2010), might indicate the greater overlap between the cognitive representations of self and others, increased social image concerns and engagement in self-referential processing, while observing a friend’s norm violating behaviors. The increased functional coupling of the precuneus with the ACC could thus represent a neural pathway that further explains, how the affective response in shared circuits is modulated the social relation by own image concerns.\n\nLimitations\n\nOne limitation of the present study is the lack of the expected significant differences on the behavioral level, while finding coherent differences on neural activation and connectivity measures. Several factors could explain this observation. First, the lack of findings on the behavioral level might be explained by diminished statistical power for the behavioral effects. The level of neural activation is closer to the actual psycho-physiological process that we are interested in, e.g. the affective arousal of vicarious embarrassment that is mapped in the AI and ACC activation. Second, social desirability might influence the validity of the participants’ self-report on their emotional experiences during the fMRI study. Specifically when it comes to emotions, which are related to judgments of another person’s condition, people tend to adjust their explicit rating, to correspond to societal norms, standards and the expectations of the experimenter. This specifically could have affected the ratings in the friend condition, as participants might rather support friends than strangers and defend their social integrity in front of others in order to decrease negative affect (Cohen and Wills, 1985), maintain self-esteem (Major et al., 1991) and enhance well-being (Cohen and Hoberman, 1983). In case of strangers, it might be easier and more socially accepted to explicitly express negative emotions such as vicarious embarrassment. These thoughts are supported by the correspondence between the behavioral report and the neural activation measures in the AI and ACC. Importantly, the association was not as strong for observing friends compared with strangers. The reduced coupling in the friend condition could be explained by effects of social desirability and adjustments of the behavioral report to align with the expectations of the environment."
