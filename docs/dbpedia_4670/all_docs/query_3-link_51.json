        "text": "Internal Vs External Anger – How to Manage Both Effectively When you think of anger what comes to mind? Perhaps a shouting, red-faced person hurling insults? How about a quiet, anxious person hiding in their home? This second example isn’t what most people commonly associate with anger but, as a therapist, I know how complex anger can be. Anger is responsible for many different issues. You might not always realise that unresolved anger is to blame. So, what are the two sides of anger? The Two Faces of Anger When a person struggles with anger there are many ways it can affect them. Anger isn’t unhealthy – it’s a normal human emotion. But it can be difficult to deal with effectively. Firstly, because it’s such a strong emotion and, secondly, because there’s a lot of social stigmas associated with anger. There are many unhelpful ways we try to process our anger. This leads to more problems. Anger causes both an emotional and physical reaction. Anger is often a response to feeling threatened. As such, it makes sense that our body responds with an increased ability to defend itself – ‘fight or flight’. However, we cannot lash out at everything or everyone that makes us angry. Consequently, people develop a variety of conscious and subconscious ways to deal with these feelings. Anger Turned Outwards Anger turned outwards and expressed inappropriately is probably what most of us think of when we think of anger issues. Explosive Anger Some people feel like they have very little control over their anger. It explodes, often without warning, and they experience rage. This can result in aggression, shouting, abuse (towards themselves, others, or objects), violence, property damage and dangerous behaviour. It’s obviously not ideal for several reasons. It will isolate you from other people, can be dangerous and can get you into trouble. It’s very important that people who experience this should seek help with anger management. Anger & Destructive Behaviour When anger elicits a feeling of shame or lack of control some people turn to unhealthy behaviours to try and negate this. They try to combat the feeling with coping behaviours that help them feel in control or as a way of punishing themselves. Self-harm is associated with anger. It is something some people use to process the feelings or to punish themselves for feeling angry in the first place. Not all self-harm is immediately obvious. Consider dangerous activities and sports, recklessness, excessive alcohol consumption, drug misuse and over/under eating. These might distract from negative emotions for a while, but at the end of the day you are actually punishing and harming yourself. Anger Turned Inwards Another way people deal with unresolved anger is to suppress or redirect it. They push it down, turn it inward, or try and convert it to something else. Distraction and forced positivity can work for a while, but eventually they lead to greater problems. Internalised anger can cause physical symptoms such as high blood pressure, depression, headaches and tension. It can also lead to passive aggressive behaviour which is not good for relationships. People who tend to focus anger inwards may be socially withdrawn, sulky, irritable and grumpy. A lot of my clients come to me about things other than anger. They don’t realise that anger is actually the root cause. That’s why hypnotherapy is so valuable. For effective change and relief, you need to treat the cause, not just the symptoms. Pent up anger can cause a general feeling of being ‘on-edge’ and ill at ease. It simmers away under the surface and may present as anxiety or depression. Controlling such a strong emotion takes a toll both physically and mentally. Many people suffer with chronic fatigue as a result. Anger & Low Self Esteem There’s also a link between low self esteem and anger. Feeling angry all the time can really damage someone’s self-esteem. Some people who are anger avoidant do not want to experience or express anger at all. They feel it makes them a bad person and this triggers shame. It’s completely healthy and normal to feel anger but some people find experiencing this powerful emotion extremely distressing. This is often seen in those whose upbringing discouraged these kind of emotions or those who have been exposed to violence or abuse. People who have deep shame attached to anger may become isolated and avoid socialising. They may feel depressed or have social anxiety. When they experience anger or the related shame, they may display physical signs such as sweating, blushing, or shaking, which makes them feel even worse. Conversely, sometimes anger is caused by confidence and self esteem issues. When we learn to recognise, allow and use anger positively, we feel validated and more competent. Anger & Anxiety Some families, particularly in previous generations, did not allow children to feel angry. They saw this as bad behaviour and would attempt to deny or control these emotions in their children rather than help them acknowledge and manage them. If you were raised in a family where your feelings of anger were rarely acknowledged, you may not recognise them now. You might mistake them for fear, anxiety or panic. Anger can be a very strong emotion and this in itself can make us anxious if we don’t understand it. However, this is especially true if we are programmed to fear anger as something destructive. Learning to recognise anger, accepting it, and using it to understand ourselves can give us a new sense of power and peace. How to Express Anger Healthily The best way to deal with anger is to express it in a constructive and safe way. Effective and assertive communication can be a good way to do this. The key is to express your needs, boundaries and feelings whilst being respectful and not aggressive. If expressing your anger isn’t possible or appropriate, you may be able to calm the anger. To do this effectively you will need to control your internal thoughts and responses, […]\n\nWhat is a Highly Sensitive Person? A highly sensitive person or HSP is someone who has a very high sensitivity to external stimuli. This can be physical, social or emotional. The term was introduced by psychologists Elaine Aron and Arthur Aron in the mid-1990s but it describes something that has been known of for a lot longer. Illustration / Victoria Eve HSP is not the same as SPD (Sensory Processing Disorder) which is a diagnosable condition. It is also not the same as being introverted, although there may be some overlap. Being a highly sensitive person involves a set of common personality traits or characteristics. It is thought that around 20% of the general population are highly sensitive people. Is there a Test for a Highly Sensitive Person? If you aren’t sure if you are a HSP you can look at the Aron’s Highly Sensitive Persons Scale (HSPS). Highly Sensitive Person Traits Avoiding high conflict or violence in TV shows and moviesParticularly sensitive to pain, caffeine or other drugsBeing deeply moved by arts or musicSeen as a very shy or sensitive childGet very nervous in high pressure situationsFeeling easily overwhelmed by loud noises, crowds, bright lights or uncomfortable clothingA strong need for downtime or alone time especially after social eventsDeep empathy and upset at others’ situationsEasily startledA rich and complex inner dialogue with deep thoughts and strong emotionsFeeling hunger very strongly and becoming easily ‘hangry’ Benefits of Being a HSP For sensitive people the lows in life may be felt very keenly but equally the highs are too. HSPs are generally very grateful for what they have in life and this strong sense of gratitude can greatly increase happiness. Dangers of Being a HSP Being a HSP brings both benefits and challenges. Stress HSPs can be more susceptible to stress. This includes work stress, personal stress and social stress. HSPs are very socially astute and can perceive many different ways in which things can go wrong. They are sensitive to conflict and can perceive tensions and hostility when others may not. Sensitive people can also struggle with high demands and hectic schedules. Plus, things we all tolerate during our days such as noises, smells and hunger may take more out of a HSP. Self –Doubt HSPs tend to be their own worst critics and can be very prone to self-doubt, embarrassment and blushing. They may ruminate on mistakes for a lot longer than a non HSP. They can often struggle in situations where they are required to perform under a watchful eye such as tests, public speaking or job interviews. It’s not that they are less capable, but they are very aware of the things that can go wrong and also of how their stress is affecting their performance. Relationships A highly sensitive person is capable of building very deep relationships but may struggle with some aspects. They may take things to heart and be very easily offended. If they are feeling overwhelmed they can lash out or become emotionally aggressive. They may be very deeply affected by their partner’s moods, both negative and positive, meaning they try very hard to make them happy. HSPs can feel other people’s disappointment and troubles very keenly so can get stuck in the trap of people pleasing. Because highly sensitive people can sense when things are ‘a little off’ they tend to do better with open people who are good communicators. People who keep things pent up can trigger great stress for them. They may also be more upset when a relationship ends. Highly Sensitive Person Coping Strategies Learn to say no when you need toBuild resilienceCreate a calm space for yourselfSchedule regular breaks and positive experiencesAvoid known stressors if possiblePrioritise communication in relationshipsLearn to control thoughts and behaviour in highly stressed situationsAvoid negativity spiralsEnjoy the small thingsAvoid tiredness, hunger and excessive caffeineSpend time in nature What Hypnotherapy Can Do For You If you feel like you might be an HSP there a number of ways in which I might be able to help you.

There is no doubt that for many the stresses and strains of the recent crisis have created an overpowering range of emotions, which can often display themselves as anger. In addition, early life experiences from childhood or teenage years may well have inadvertently caused issues that now cause anger. In reality, the problem arises when anger erupts in an uncontrollable manner. Causes of Anger There can be many reasons why you may feel angry in the course of a day and this is normal. However, for some people, anger is a dominant emotion and can become a serious issue when it becomes uncontrollable on a regular basis. The cause of uncontrollable anger lies in the individual’s emotional intelligence and their inability to manage their emotions appropriately, Ideally we want to defuse an emotive situation before anger takes over. What Does Anger Look Like? Anger can display itself in a wide variety of ways as testified by media imagery describing road rage, domestic violence and other forms of aggressive behaviours. For people with this emotional issue, outbursts of anger can have significantly detrimental long term effects on their health and welfare and those who are closest to that person. The problem is how to bring the anger under control so that it is no longer such a destructive form of expression. This is where anger management comes into its own. How Does Anger Management Work? Anger management works on several levels. Firstly, it looks to find the root cause of the problem – why is anger such a common emotional state for you? Then, what triggers the anger? I help the individual learn how to recognise the triggers and how to manage them. This can be achieved with hypnotherapy, which, if conducted by an experienced hypnotherapist, can have a hugely beneficial impact on the individual and the family as a whole. It does this by enabling the individual to access and understand the reasons for their anger and also methods which can be utilised to manage their anger.

Sometimes obsessive thoughts stem from conditions like OCD. Whilst others come from unfulfilled desires or a strong attachment to someone. This can be distressing when the feelings are directed at someone unavailable or inaccessible. What is an Obsession? How do you know if you’re obsessed with someone? Warning signs include: constantly thinking about them feeling unhappy and out of control starting to lose your own identity changes in your behaviour or moods revolving your life around them your happiness depends on them Ways to stop obsessing over someone you can’t have Get some distance Firstly, put some distance between you and the person you’re obsessing over. In this way, you can achieve a healthy mental separation. This can be challenging at first. However, being too close to someone you can’t have will only fuel this unhealthy relationship. As time goes by you’ll find it becoming easier. Stop feeding the obsession Secondly, an obsession needs to be fed to remain strong. Thinking of or seeing that person may be giving you a burst of pleasure as it temporarily feeds the desire. However, you’re only fuelling something which is damaging to your own life. Try to stop obsessing about them, talking about them and seeing them whenever possible. If they pop into your head, which they inevitably will, acknowledge the thought and gently tell yourself you’ve decided not to indulge this right now, and distract yourself with other things until the thoughts pass. Distraction In the midst of a strong obsession you might find that you let all other aspects of your life go unattended. Friends, family and work might all benefit from a bit of extra attention. So try using these as distractions as well as finding happiness in other areas of your life. Many people find that a new job, moving house or going travelling is a helpful new start and aids them in moving on from harmful obsessions. Living in the moment Meditation is an extremely helpful practice for people who struggle with obsessions, as it teaches them to live in the moment, engage their senses and enjoy the world around them rather than in their head. It also helps people learn to deal with unwanted thoughts – acknowledging their presence but gently moving them aside and refusing to feed them. This is useful because the chances are if you tell yourself not to think about something at all, it’s likely that’s all you will think about – just like chocolate when on a diet! New habits Try encouraging yourself to change your routine and give your mind something new to focus on. Whether it’s a new hobby, new look, new people or new places. This signals to your brain that this is a time of change. Moreover, encouraging you to look to the future rather than the past. Obsessing over yourself When we put all our energy into obsessing over a relationship or another person we tend not to have any energy left for ourselves. Try instead, becoming obsessed with yourself for a bit. Build your self-esteem, try new looks, focus on what you love, try new passions and do all you can to make yourself happy outside of the obsession. Don’t let your happiness depend on someone who doesn’t love you back. Learn to love yourself instead. Therapy for Obsessions I help many clients deal with obsessive thoughts and behaviours. When you’re obsessed with a person you can’t have, it can be extremely upsetting and damaging to your life. Hypnotherapy can weaken the unhealthy thought and behaviours patterns. As well as stopping the obsessing over the person you can’t have. In doing so, you can enjoy life again feeling free and happy. I can help you explore the reasons for the obsession and create an action plan to help you move on. Whatever your individual circumstances, hypnotherapy is proven to be fast acting and effective with this type of problem.
