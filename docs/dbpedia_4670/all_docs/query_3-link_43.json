(A Definition)​\n\nEmbarrassment is an emotional state characterized by feelings of discomfort, self-consciousness, and awkwardness resulting from a perceived misstep or mistake, or from unwanted exposure of sensitive or private information about yourself. It typically arises when an individual believes that their actions, appearance, or behavior have fallen short of societal norms, expectations, or personal standards, leading to a sense of humiliation.\n\nEmbarrassment is a universal emotion, experienced by people of all ages and in all cultures. And, as most of us have experienced, it can range in intensity from mild to severe.\n\nOpposite of Embarrassment​\n\nThe opposite of embarrassment is self-confidence or self-assurance. It’s a state of mind that’s characterized by a sense of poise, composure, and a lack of self-consciousness. When someone is confident, they feel secure in themselves and their abilities and aren’t easily flustered or humiliated in social situations.\n\nBy contrast, embarrassment indicates a focus on how you’re appearing to others and a perception that you’re being judged poorly. Also, embarrassment often goes along with feelings of worthlessness. But when you’re confident, your sense of self-worth is not easily shaken, even when you make a mistake.\n\nWhy Is Embarrassment Important?\n\nAlthough embarrassment is emotionally painful, it does serve important social and psychological functions.\n\n​\n\nSocial function: The desire to avoid embarrassment inhibits us from acting in ways that violate social norms and morality. Embarrassment shows we care about what others think, prompting us to behave in a way that promotes bonding with others (Nikolić et al., 2020).\n\nCommunication: Embarrassment is typically accompanied by outward behaviors such as blushing, fidgeting, and avoiding eye contact. This nonverbal communication signals to others that we regret our actions and that our behavior wasn’t intentional (Robbins & Parlavecchio, 2006).\n\nAvoiding conflict: Signaling that our behavior wasn’t intentional or that we feel regretful helps us to avoid conflict with others.\n\nSelf-reflection and learning: Because embarrassment is unpleasant (to say the least), it teaches us to avoid the behavior that triggered it and to learn from our mistakes. It prompts us to consider how we might do things differently in the future.\n\nPromoting accountability: When we feel embarrassed about something we’ve done, it prompts us to take responsibility for our actions and to make amends.\n\nImproving cooperation: Not wanting to feel embarrassed keeps us from behaving solely out of self-interest. Most of us don’t want to be viewed as that selfish person who doesn’t care about others.\n\nEmpathy: Have you ever felt embarrassed for someone else? In this way, embarrassment fosters empathy, leading to more pro-social behavior.\n\nSocial bonding: Expressing embarrassment can create a sense of vulnerability and openness, which can strengthen social bonds. When we share embarrassing experiences with others, it can foster a sense of camaraderie and trust, as it demonstrates a willingness to be authentic and reveal our shortcomings.\n\nCauses of Embarrassment\n\nResearchers believe two factors are required to evoke embarrassment. The first is that you perceive you’ve failed to live up to your personal standards or to behave appropriately. The second is the presence of other people and believing that you are being judged negatively. In other words, it feels like a public misstep (Müller-Pinzler et al., 2015).\n\nWhen it comes to embarrassment, “failing” usually means behaving in a way that doesn’t align with the image you have of yourself or violating a social expectation. It includes things like making a mistake in public, feeling like you look unintelligent, showing a lack of poise (looking clumsy, falling, having an awkward conversation), or accidentally revealing personal information. But you won’t feel embarrassed unless you also have the desire to meet others’ expectations and the need to be socially accepted (Withers, 2016).\n\nBut what are the physiological causes of embarrassment? What’s going on in your brain?\n\nOne area of the brain, the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC), is particularly active when we feel self-conscious emotions like embarrassment. It’s a small, boomerang-shaped structure located behind your eyes (Sturm et al., 2013).\n\nThe pACC is affected by diseases of the brain’s frontal and temporal lobes. A study showed that the pACC is smaller in people with a form of dementia called frontotemporal dementia. Interestingly, people suffering from this form of dementia say and do socially inappropriate things without any signs of embarrassment. And even in healthy people, those who aren’t easily embarrassed have a smaller than average pACC (Weir, 2012).\n\nThis video does a great job of explaining this and gives some practical strategies for getting over embarrassment:​\n\nVideo: How to Deal with Embarrassment\n\nExamples of Embarrassment​\n\nThis sounds like a scene out of a cheesy movie.\n\nWhen I was working at a restaurant years ago, one of my coworkers spilled a rather large amount of red wine on a customer. As if that wasn’t bad enough, he was wearing—you guessed it—an expensive all-white suit. Talk about embarrassing!\n\nHere are some other common examples:\n\n​\n\nTripping or falling in front of a group of people.\n\nForgetting someone’s name that you should know.\n\nMispronouncing or misusing a word—believing that you looked stupid.\n\nAnswering incorrectly in a classroom setting—again, believing you looked stupid.\n\nBeing caught in a lie or an awkward situation.\n\nBeing caught daydreaming or not paying attention.\n\nMaking bodily noises in public—burps, loud sneezes, gas.\n\nUnintentionally saying something inappropriate or offensive.\n\nHaving your phone ring loudly in a quiet meeting.\n\nSending a text or email to the wrong person, especially if it has sensitive or personal information.\n\nExperiencing a wardrobe malfunction such as a zipper down or a button popping open. (Anyone remember the Janet Jackson Superbowl incident in 2004? Imagine 90 million people watching!)\n\nPsychology of Embarrassment\n\nEmbarrassment is considered a self-conscious emotion, along with shame, guilt, and pride. You’re very aware of what others may think of you. Because of the self-conscious element, it requires more mental processing than more basic emotions like anger or fear and thus is considered more complex. You have to put yourself into the mind of another (Weir, 2012).\n\nThe presence of others has a huge effect on our psychology and our emotional reactions to our own behavior. Studies suggest that most of us are motivated to maintain a positive social image whenever we act in public and feel extreme discomfort if our social integrity is threatened (Müller-Pinzler, 2015). An interesting example of adhering to social norms can be seen in a nudist camp. In this situation, people may find it more embarrassing to keep their clothes on (Edelmann, 1981).\n\nAnother interesting aspect of embarrassment is that we can feel embarrassed for others. For example, have you ever felt embarrassed for a comedian or musician who gives a particularly poor performance? This is likely due to our capacity for empathy. Our brains are wired to internally simulate others’ experiences. So when we see someone in a potentially embarrassing situation, the ability to understand and share their feelings automatically kicks in.\n\nAlthough embarrassment is seen in people of all ages past the age of two, the situations that trigger it change over your lifetime. As you mature and grow into adulthood, your sense of social norms changes along with what you find embarrassing (Kill & Toprakbasti, 2021). For example, like most teens, I was extremely embarrassed when my mother did something I found inappropriate or uncool. As an adult, I began to see it more like, “Well, that’s her; it’s no reflection on me.”\n\nAs you age, what you find embarrassing may change as well. One study suggests that older adults are less likely to find situations or our behavior embarrassing (Henry et al., 2018). I think this is because most of us feel more confident and secure in ourselves later in life. One good thing about getting older!\n\nJust as embarrassment is experienced by all age groups, it also occurs across cultures. But again, what triggers it can vary. For example, in some cultures, it’s perfectly acceptable to speak loudly, so someone who grew up in a culture where this is the norm will not feel embarrassed doing so. But someone from a culture where speaking loudly is frowned upon will find this behavior embarrassing.\n\nSymptoms of Embarrassment\n\nSymptoms of embarrassment vary from person to person, but these are some of the most common:\n\n​\n\nIncreased heart rate and blood pressure: Along with emotions like fear and anger, embarrassment activates the sympathetic nervous system (the “fight or flight” response), triggering an increased heart rate and blood pressure. However, during embarrassment, after the initial spike the heart rate slows while blood pressure continues to rise. This is considered a unique characteristic of embarrassment (Weir, 2012).\n\nBlushing: One of the most visible signs of embarrassment, blushing is due to increased blood flow to the face. But this doesn’t happen to everyone, and some of us are more prone to blushing than others. Research suggests blushing is a physiological response to unwanted exposure (Robbins & Parlavecchio, 2006).\n\nFeeling hot or flushed and sweating: This may accompany blushing as the blood rushing to your face makes you feel warm.\n\nLoss of confidence: Embarrassment can erode self-confidence, causing us to feel insecure or inadequate.\n\nVerbal stumbling: This is caused by self-consciousness and the reduced confidence that comes with embarrassment. The heightened self-monitoring can create a self-imposed pressure to speak flawlessly, which ironically can lead to more stumbling.\n\nWithdrawal: Embarrassment can cause us to become quiet and attempt to escape from the situation.\n\nEmbarrassment Body Language\n\nAvoiding eye contact: Charles Darwin was the first to note that when we’re embarrassed we gaze downward (Edelmann, 1981). This may be a coping mechanism that helps us avoid the feeling of being judged.\n\nFidgeting: This can include shuffling your feet, touching your hair or face, or fidgeting with objects. This can help to dissipate the nervous energy that comes with embarrassment.\n\nSmiling and nervous laughter: This is likely a defense mechanism due to feeling uncomfortable. It’s an attempt to take the edge off.\n\nApologizing: Not really body language, but this is a common behavior that comes with embarrassment. ​\n\nEmbarrassment vs. Shame\n\nThese two words are sometimes used interchangeably, with shame being considered a more intense version of embarrassment. Both are self-conscious emotions, indicating a focus on yourself and others’ perceptions of you (Robbins & Parlavecchio, 2006). However, studies show that they are distinctive emotions (Tangney et al., 1996; Edelman, 1981).\n\n​\n\nPrivate vs. public: This is probably the most distinctive difference. Shame can happen without the presence of others while embarrassment can’t. Shame can occur even if nobody else knows about your behavior, but embarrassment is a reaction to feeling judged by others. If you feel embarrassed when alone, it’s usually because of an especially vivid memory where you imagine others judging you.\n\nMorality: With embarrassment, we’re typically upset about the public image we presented. It may involve feeling foolish or silly, and we’re often able to find humor in it. But shame usually involves a feeling that we’ve done something immoral or that we have a personal defect, and we don’t see anything funny about it (Edelman, 1981; Weir, 2012).\n\nLength and intensity: Shame is intense and long-lasting and involves a negative evaluation of yourself as a whole. By contrast, embarrassment usually (but not always) passes more quickly and is more situational.\n\nBehavior: Shame doesn’t involve the behaviors associated with embarrassment like blushing or nervous laughter.\n\nOne similarity—it’s probably not as bad as you think: On a positive note, in the case of both shame and guilt, studies show that we evaluate ourselves more harshly than others do. We tend to believe we’ve made a worse impression or committed a worse moral transgression than we actually have. So we’re harder on ourselves than we should be (Tangney et al., 1996). Reminding yourself of this fact can help mitigate the effects of embarrassment. I find this helpful because I’m definitely my own worst critic! ​\n\nEmbarrassment & Anxiety\n\nAlmost everyone has some fear of embarrassment and occasional social anxiety. This is normal if you care at all about what others think of you. But for some, this fear becomes so intense that it’s debilitating and can lead to social withdrawal and depression. When it reaches that level, the person may be diagnosed with social anxiety disorder (SAD) (Müller-Pinzler et al., 2015).\n\nOne study showed that people with high levels of social anxiety view situations where someone behaved inappropriately as more embarrassing than those without social anxiety. This shows a connection between worry about being embarrassed and the level of social anxiety you experience. The study participants also viewed unintentional inappropriate behavior as more embarrassing than intentional inappropriateness, showing they overestimate the social consequences of embarrassing situations. This indicates they experience embarrassment more often and more intensely, which could contribute to the development of SAD (Bas-Hoogendam et al., 2018). ​\n\nEmbarrassment & Blushing\n\nAs mentioned above, blushing is a common, but not universal, response to embarrassment. It’s an involuntary reaction to embarrassment triggered by the nervous system. The red color is caused by the veins in the face dilating (becoming larger) and increasing blood flow to the face.\n\nWhile the awareness that you’re blushing may increase your level of embarrassment, it serves a purpose. When other people see you blushing, it shows them you genuinely regret something you’ve done, so they’re more likely to feel empathy or forgive you. It serves as a nonverbal apology and can even make you seem more likable.\n\nBut on the downside, blushing can contribute to the development of SAD (Nikolić et al., 2020). People with SAD report that they blush frequently and worry about blushing in social situations. Sometimes people who blush easily find it so disconcerting that they avoid social situations to the point that it can interfere with everyday functioning (aan het Rot et al., 2015).\n\nIf this is you, here are some things that can help. In fact, many of these can help quell embarrassment in general:\n\n​\n\nRelaxation techniques: Practicing deep breathing exercises or mindfulness meditation can help you remain calm and reduce the physiological response that triggers blushing.\n\nPositive self-talk: Remind yourself that blushing is a natural reaction and that everyone experiences embarrassment from time to time. Being kind and understanding toward yourself can help reduce self-consciousness.\n\nExposure therapy: Gradual exposure to situations that trigger embarrassment can help desensitize your body's response over time, leading to reduced blushing.\n\nVisualizations: Imagine yourself in embarrassing situations while remaining calm and composed. This mental rehearsal can help train your mind to respond differently in real-life situations.\n\nFocusing on others: When feeling embarrassed, shift your focus from yourself to others in the room. Engage in active listening and show genuine interest in what they are saying. This can help divert attention away from yourself.\n\nHumor: Learn to laugh at yourself and embrace your imperfections. A good sense of humor can help diffuse embarrassing situations and make them less intense.\n\nDistracting yourself: Engage in mental or physical activities that can divert your focus from the situation, reducing the intensity of your embarrassment.\n\nCooling down: If you feel a blush coming on, try to cool down your face by gently fanning yourself or applying a cold compress to your cheeks.\n\nProfessional help: If blushing due to embarrassment significantly affects your daily life or causes severe distress, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in anxiety or social discomfort.\n\nQuotes on Embarrassment\n\n“If embarrassment were a muscle, I’d be huge.” — Brent Weeks\n\n“How embarrassing to be human.” — Kurt Vonnegut\n\n\"Embarrassment is like a garment we all wear from time to time, but it doesn't define who we are.\" — Cynthia Lewis\n\n\"The only thing worse than being embarrassed is being embarrassed about being embarrassed.\" — Mokokoma Mokhonoana\n\n\"Embarrassment is the echo of our imperfections.\" — Unknown\n\n\"The most profound lessons often come from moments of embarrassment and vulnerability.\" — Brene Brown\n\nArticles Related to Embarrassment\n\nBooks Related to Embarrassment\n\nFinal Thoughts on Embarrassment​\n\nAs human beings, embarrassment is part of our nature, occurring across cultures and ages. It’s a tough emotion that’s easily triggered and difficult to control.\n\nBut there are ways to soften its effects. First, remember it’s something we all experience. Second, remember it’s probably not as bad as you think. Science shows that we judge ourselves more harshly than anyone else. (Nobody’s focusing on you that much.) Also, try not to dwell on it. Do something you enjoy or feel skilled at. I also find meditation can help quiet those recurring thoughts, the ones that keep replaying the incident.\n\nMost importantly, look at embarrassment as a reason to self-reflect and learn instead of letting it define you. Don’t let an embarrassing moment overshadow your positive experiences and accomplishments.\n\nDon't Forget to Grab Our Free eBook to Learn How to\n\nGrow Your Wellness Business Exponentially!\n\nReferences"
