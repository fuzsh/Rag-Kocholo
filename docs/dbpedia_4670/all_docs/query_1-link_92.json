        "text": "I'd suggest:\n\nthick-skinned\n\nadjective\n\ninsensitive or hardened to criticism, reproach, rebuff, etc\n\ndictionary.com\n\nIt may be because I come from East Asia but this is the phrase I most often hear (the phrase also exist in Malay and I believe Mandarin).\n\nIt does have a slight negative connotation but I honestly don't believe there can be any word or phrase about the concept of someone not listening to criticism that can get away from any negative connotation. Even words like \"brazen\" imply that the person is overconfident.\n\nBrazen and cocksure (suggested earlier) are good words to use if the subject is possibly too insensitive to their circumstances. That is, a brazen person may not mind being embarrassed, but they generally also wouldn't mind embarrassing others just as easily.\n\nI would use confident or self-assured if you want to avoid a negative connotation as much as possible. Dictionary.com:\n\nConfident\n\n2. sure of oneself; having no uncertainty about one's own abilities, correctness, successfulness, etc.; self-confident; bold: a confident speaker.\n\nSelf-assured\n\n['Self-assurance' is called an exact synonym with 'self-confidence', which is defined as]\n\n1. realistic confidence in one's own judgment, ability, power, etc.\n\n2. excessive or inflated confidence in one's own judgment, ability, etc.\n\nThe second definition here could be a negative trait, but judging from my familiarity with its usage, over-confidence is not the main thrust of the word self-confident/self-assured.\n\npoised The Free Dictionary\n\nself-possessed; dignified; exhibiting composure....self assured\n\nSomeone who is immune to embarrassment is poised, or has poise. Example, from The House of Seven Gables by Nathaniel Hawthorne:\n\nBut what was most remarkable, and, perhaps, showed a more than common poise in the young man, was the fact that, amid all these personal vicissitudes, he had never lost his identity.\n\nThe meaning of poise that I am using in this answer dates from the 1640s, according to Etymonline; the ballerina's poise on-stage (mentioned in one of the comments, below) is more than 100 years later.\n\nThe sense of \"steadiness, composure\" first recorded 1640s, from notion of being equally weighted on either side (1550s). Meaning \"balance\" is from 1711; meaning \"way in which the body is carried\" is from 1770.\n\n\"impassive\" sounds like a good fit. Such a person isn't exactly immune to embarrassment but they are immune to letting it show. \"poker-faced\" refers to being deliberately impassive and might fit too. An \"imperturbable\" character (already mentioned in an answer by dangph) is unlikely to show any embarrassment in the situations you've mentioned.\n\n\"impassive\" - not revealing or affected by emotion, reserved\n\n\"poker-faced\" - refers to being deliberately impassive.\n\n\"imperturbable\" - not easily perturbed; calm; unruffled\n\nThe word Resilient might be a good fit. A person who is resilient has earned this status through demonstration of their ability to endure hardship or otherwise adverse situations in a similar way to a person who has earned the status of being successful.\n\nResilience is an inner strength that is cultivated through being receptive of the negative situation(s) and subsequently overcoming it by undergoing internal change. It is not a strength derived at the expense of others or due necessarily to having boldness of character.\n\nA lot of the other words I can see here could also be used to describe those who are unable to empathise or feel shame/remorse for their actions. Hence, these words may imply the kind of strength that come from a person who chooses to be, or is naturally ignorant of the full dynamics of a situation.\n\n“Teflon is a nickname given to persons, particularly in politics, to whom criticism does not seem to stick. (...)\n\n“Ronald Reagan, the President of the United States, was called by his detractors ‘the Teflon president’. The nickname was coined by Patricia Schroeder, a Congresswoman, and reflected on how a plethora of scandals surrounding his presidency seemed to have no effect on his individual popularity with the public.”\n\n– “Teflon (nickname)”, Wikipedia\n\nSee all 436 instances of Donald Trump being described as “teflon” by the media.\n\nOther words:\n\nNegative: arrogant, obnoxious, shameless, impertinent, rude, uncouth, dumb, insensitive, inconsiderate, disrespectful, brash, self-congratulatory, “without respect, humility and dignity”.\n\nPositive: confident, self-confident, unapolegetic.\n\nNeutral: audacious, brazen, unembarrassed, defiant.\n\n“The Teflon Don: Donald Trump appears to be bullet-proof. Despite being challenged by Republicans, Democrats and the media, he continues to stay ahead in the polls.”\n\n– cartoonist Gary Varvel (The Indianapolis Star)\n\n“For months now, Republican presidential candidates have been trying to figure out how to disparage Donald Trump effectively.”\n\n– “Teflon Don” (The Washington Post)\n\nAt the risk of stating the obvious, unembarrassable says pretty much exactly what you’re asking for.\n\nIt’s a long and uncommon word, but it won’t confuse anyone or come across as awkward or fancy, because it’s built just from a couple of standard constructions (the suffix -able and the prefix un-) on top of the root embarrass. And it’s reasonably well-established in both colloquial and formal use: for an example in high-quality edited writing, see The perks of being unembarrassable, in The Cut (the fashion arm of New York magazine), which paints a picture very close to the examples in your question."
