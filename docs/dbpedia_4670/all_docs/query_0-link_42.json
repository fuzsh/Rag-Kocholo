        "text": "By Brenda Shaughnessy\n\nIt’s a wave, isn’t it? Not a particle.\n\nA fresh, cool wave, so why am I flushed\n\nand not washed? Why dirtier than before?\n\n1. Etymology\n\nOn the subject of our names.\n\nThey’re so embracing,\n\nthinking they’re all us\n\nand swallowing themselves\n\ninto our nausea.\n\nYet we never quite die on the spot.\n\nWe put off being what we’re called,\n\nwe take the hint.\n\nTime is never wasted.\n\nIt is always spent.\n\n2. Teleology\n\nSheer fabric trailing through 4 a.m.\n\nI thought it was opaque and earlier.\n\n3. Mathematics\n\nI know you know I know.\n\nAnd the mirror multiplies inside.\n\nThe world is no bigger, but next time\n\ndo the math,\n\nbecause I wanted to know none\n\nof what I now know twice.\n\n4. The Principle of the Borg\n\nSaying “There’s no one like me”\n\naccomplishes the exact opposite\n\nof what you mean.\n\nIt is true only insofar as it is true\n\nfor everyone equally.\n\nSo it means you are not special\n\nin any way. Which should be enough for you.\n\n5. Documentary\n\nThis clothing, a maladaptive wrapping,\n\ncuts me up. I am a vignette,\n\nfloated knowingly\n\nsince I pulled myself through myself,\n\nlike a unitard. Too many eyeholes\n\nhave been cut and pieced together\n\nto make flesh less various with others.\n\n6. Medicine\n\nThe cure for embarrassment\n\nis substitution.\n\nStrap, don’t pluck.\n\nBaldness makes headlines.\n\nUse grass. Use less.\n\nShorts under your skirt for recess.\n\nRedo the surfaces of your wrong turns to make\n\ntaking them smoother in the future.\n\n7. Cosmology\n\nThings are less embarrassing\n\nat the cellular level. Remember?\n\nWe were a whole part of the universe\n\nbefore Mother busted the party.\n\nBefore we were ourselves.\n\nNow, like dirty soap, we\n\nattract what we repel.\n\n8. Apology\n\nEven the clumsiest fate is perfectly shaped,\n\nso the view took over looking\n\nbut the sweetest thing I’ve ever known\n\nis obscene with a beautiful\n\nsugar rotted down to its truth.\n\nLoving you a serious accidental shame\n\nand day flatulates into night,\n\ntrips and falls in front of millions\n\ninto morning.\n\nIn thrall to this pocus:\n\nthe end of fear starts\n\nwith such an annihilating blush,\n\nwith such a stutter.\n\nBrenda Shaughnessy, \"Embarrassment\" from Human Dark with Sugar.
