        "text": "Meghan Markle’s brand “embarrassment” could have been avoided after the name is already in use, a PR expert has claimed.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex was left red-faced when it emerged that another company is using her lifestyle brand name, American Riviera Orchard, to sell adult colouring books online. Meghan announced her new business venture back in March, as it was revealed she would be creating a collection of preserves, jams and nut butters to sell, as well as homeware, home fragrance, pet products and cookware.\n\nAccording to The Independent, a Shopify page started by a mystery seller in America is selling colouring books for grown ups - with one named ‘Working Class Royalty’ - and priced between £8 and £16. One colouring book is currently sold out, while there are two financial planners available, priced at either £8 or £16 depending on size.\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Paul Burrell slams 'sideshow' Sussexes amid claims celebrities are avoiding the pair\n\nJane Owen, celebrity PR expert, told The Mirror that Meghan and her team should have been more careful with their “overall brand strategy”, and blamed them for the awkward blunder. “I think this is an embarrassment to the people running her company for sure. They should have been more careful to tie up all uses of the name legally so this could have been avoided,” she explained.\n\n“It shows a glaring lack of overall brand strategy which should have encompassed everything and predicted this kind of thing happening and prevented it,” Jane continued. “What I recommend they do is make every legal action to get this person to cease and desist. Then they buy up everything remotely connected to the name and put their marketing and advertising in to overdrive to compensate for this and do damage control on the brand name.”\n\nWhile the Shopify page states that it has no connection to Meghan’s brand, the description on the website suggests they have an anti-monarchy stance suggesting that they have used the name to take a stand against the Royal Family. A blog on the Shopify page claims that royal titles have “no significance” and said their “RoyalWealth Reign™ line was established to recognise and celebrate the working class who are the true heart of our country.” Revealing that they are a US brand, they continued: “In America, we do not recognize a royal title by someone’s name. In America, we believe ALL are created EQUAL.”"
