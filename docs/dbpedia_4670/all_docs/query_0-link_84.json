        "text": "By Darren White\n\nAs parents, we have all at some time thought long and hard about what name we will give our child.\n\nSome people spend hours and hours on end reading Baby Name Books, arguing that you cannot use a particular name because your friend’s sister is called that and she is not a very likeable person.However, when choosing a name, it is important to know that as parents we do not have a completely free choice in what to call our children. Some parents may want a unique name for their child so that they stand out from the crowd, however, as has been demonstrated recently by a reported case, that might not always be a good idea.\n\nLast week The Court of Appeal went as far as to prevent a mother from South Wales giving her daughter the name Cyanide, which is, of course, the name of a poison! The mother’s legal team argued that stopping her from naming her daughter this breached her Right to a family life. One of the mother’s arguments was even that the name she had chosen must be a good one, because it was the name of the poison that killed Adolf Hitler. The Court disagreed, saying that it was unreasonable and that the child faced mockery in later life. This is of course not the first time a name has been banned. You may recall the French cases in which couples were banned from naming their children “Nutella” and “Fraise” the French name for strawberry. And you might even recall that back in 2008 a child was placed in state care in New Zealand as a result of her parents naming her “Talulah does the hula from Hawaii”!\n\nWhilst on the whole in the UK there is a liberal approach when it comes to what we can call our children, names such as “God”, “Satan” and “Pope” are examples of names that are not permitted to be used, on the grounds of bad taste.\n\nAny name should carefully be considered and always take into account the ‘embarrassment factor’, as our children have tough enough lives without having to face mockery at school. In any event if at a later stage the child wishes to change their names and, either he or she is over the age of 16 or, if both parents consent, this can be done quickly, cheaply and effectively with the assistance of a qualified solicitor."
