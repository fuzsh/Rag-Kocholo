        "meta_description": "Embarrassment is a painful but important emotional state. Most researchers believe that the purpose of embarrassment is to make people feel badly about their social or personal mistakes as a form of internal (or societal) feedback, so that they learn not to repeat the error. The accompanying physiological changes, including blushing, sweating, or stammering, may signal to others that a person recognizes their own error, and so is not cold-hearted or oblivious.",

        "text": "Frequently grouped with shame and guilt, embarrassment is considered a “self-conscious emotion,” and it can have a profoundly negative impact on a person’s thoughts or behavior. The embarrassed individual becomes conscious of a real (or imagined) failure to comply with social norms and fears that others won’t view them as highly as a result. The ensuing embarrassment may be accompanied by feelings of awkwardness, exposure, shame, guilt, or regret.\n\nIt’s notable that the inciting event may be either positive or negative. For example, someone may feel just as embarrassed by being called beautiful in front of a group of people as they are by forgetting someone’s name or falling in public. A person can feel embarrassed for themselves or on behalf of someone else (if they are particularly empathic, or if they are secretly concerned that the other person’s supposed failings will also reflect negatively on them). Embarrassment is a highly individual experience and is often intensified by the fear that everyone is watching (and judging) when most of the time, almost no one will even notice."
