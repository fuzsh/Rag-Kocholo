        "text": "Getting help for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD)\n\nYou should see a GP if you think you might have BDD.\n\nThey'll probably ask a number of questions about your symptoms and how they affect your life.\n\nThey may also ask if you've had any thoughts about harming yourself.\n\nYou may be treated by the GP, or they may refer you to a mental health specialist for further assessment and treatment.\n\nIt can be very difficult to seek help for BDD, but it's important to remember that you have nothing to feel ashamed or embarrassed about.\n\nGetting help is important because your symptoms probably will not go away without treatment and may get worse.\n\nYou can also refer yourself directly to an NHS talking therapies service without a referral from a GP.\n\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)\n\nCBT can help you manage your BDD symptoms by changing the way you think and behave.\n\nIt helps you learn what triggers your symptoms, and teaches you different ways of thinking about and dealing with your habits.\n\nYou and your therapist will agree on goals for the therapy and work together to try to reach them.\n\nCBT for treating BDD will usually include a technique known as exposure and response prevention (ERP).\n\nThis involves gradually facing situations that would normally make you think obsessively about your appearance and feel anxious.\n\nYour therapist will help you to find other ways of dealing with your feelings in these situations so that, over time, you become able to deal with them without feeling self-conscious or afraid.\n\nYou may also be given some self-help information to read at home and your CBT might involve group work, depending on your symptoms.\n\nCBT for children and young people will usually also involve their family members or carers.\n\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)\n\nSSRIs are a type of antidepressant.\n\nThere are a number of different SSRIs, but fluoxetine is most commonly used to treat BDD.\n\nIt may take up to 12 weeks for SSRIs to have an effect on your BDD symptoms.\n\nIf they work for you, you'll probably be asked to keep taking them for several months to improve your symptoms further and stop them coming back.\n\nThere are some common side effects of taking SSRIs, but these will often pass within a few weeks.\n\nYour doctor will keep a close eye on you over the first few weeks. It's important to tell them if you're feeling particularly anxious or emotional, or are having thoughts of harming yourself.\n\nIf you've not had symptoms for 6 to 12 months, you'll probably be taken off SSRIs.\n\nThis will be done by slowly reducing your dose over time to help make sure your symptoms do not come back (relapse) and to avoid any side effects of coming off the drug (withdrawal symptoms), such as anxiety.\n\nChildren, adults younger than 30, and all people with a history of suicidal behaviour will need to be carefully monitored when taking SSRIs. This is because they may have a higher chance of developing suicidal thoughts or trying to hurt themselves in the early stages of treatment.\n\nChildren and young people may be offered an SSRI if they're having severe symptoms of BDD.\n\nMedicine should only be suggested after they have seen a psychiatrist and been offered talking therapies.\n\nFurther treatment\n\nIf treatment with both CBT and an SSRI has not improved your BDD symptoms after 12 weeks, you may be prescribed a different type of SSRI or another antidepressant called clomipramine.\n\nIf you do not see any improvements in your symptoms, you may be referred to a mental health clinic or hospital that specialises in BDD, such as the National OCD/BDD Service in London.\n\nThese services will probably do a more in-depth assessment of your BDD.\n\nThey may offer you more CBT or a different kind of therapy, as well as a different kind of antidepressant."
