        "text": "The teenage years can be more than tricky; they can be bewildering and painful. One of the biggest challenges faced by parents I work with is figuring out, \"Is this normal teenage stuff, or something more?\" There's a wide range of \"normal\" with teens, as their bodies and brains change at lightning speed, and they go through so many critical stages of their development in a short amount of time.\n\nOne of the most \"normal\" things teens experience is being embarrassed by their parents, and they often try to separate who they are in public from who they are at home. They may choose to spend time away from home and hang out with their friends as much as possible, or avoid family when they are home and hibernate in their rooms. What does not need to be a normal part of this stage, however, is being mean to everyone in the process.\n\nHere's how to deal with this challenging time.\n\nRemember the Toddler Days\n\nTeenagers are famous for regressing back to their toddler ways, probably because of neural changes that cause intense activity in the emotion centers of their brains. They can erupt unpredictably and swing between extremes, much like a toddler throwing a tantrum. It's helpful to make that comparison because we can use the skills we honed back then: Practice empathy first, but then put boundaries around the behavior.\n\nTeens are allowed to have whatever feelings they have, and they need to know that their emotions are acceptable, but they cannot act however they want. As with toddlers, however, they will be more likely to listen to you if your relationship is already solid.\n\nStrengthen Your Relationship\n\nA teenager intent on asserting their independence can seem difficult to reach, and it does take some creativity. You may get shot down when you ask to spend more time with them, especially if that's not something you normally do.\n\nTeens often reject their parents' attempts at seeking closeness, but two years is a long time to do that. I have no idea if your sister's description of you as \"overbearing\" is accurate, but the fact that your child has become distant may spur you to try harder. Unfortunately, that extra effort can drive them further away, frustrating you both and weakening your connection.\n\nIf there's one thing that all teens have in common, it's that they want to be in charge (something that's also true of toddlers!). When they feel like connecting with you, and know they can do it on their own terms, they will work harder to make it happen.\n\nYou can let them know you're interested in hanging out with them, then let them decide when and where. Or if you know your child loves going to Starbucks, for example, you might say, \"Hey, I was thinking of running to Starbucks this morning. Want to come?\" Keeping your time together short and sweet can lessen the pressure for both of you.\n\nThe next level of connection will require having the kind of deep talks that can bring you closer. In your situation, it sounds like you both need to work up to that and get more comfortable spending time together. Don't push too hard too fast! Interrogating your daughter about why she described you as \"such a mess\" (which I agree is quite hurtful!) may put both of you on the defensive, and not get you where you want to go—which is ultimately feeling more connected.\n\nWhen it seems like things are easing a little between you two, you can start to leave \"breadcrumb signals,\" slowly and subtly. The surest way to get a teenager to shut down is to pepper them with questions! Let them know you care, and that you will listen and support them, and leave it at that.\n\nWhen your teen seems ready and starts to leave their own breadcrumbs for you, proceed cautiously! Keep in mind that the less pressure you apply, the better. You might try having a conversation in the car, which can prove surprisingly fruitful. While driving, you two can talk without making direct eye contact, and there's a natural endpoint to the conversation once you reach your destination.\n\nAlso try to meet your child where they are most comfortable, like over text. I recently started an important conversation with my daughter by texting her an opening question (we were two floors away from each other at the time). She responded by text, then an hour later continued the discussion in person.\n\nSeek More Support\n\nIf you try these approaches with your teenager and get nowhere, there may be more going on than you think. Arranging your own visit with a therapist who specializes in family relationships could help you develop more insight and self-awareness, allowing you to respond to the situation in a way that better serves your relationship. Involving your teen in family therapy can be helpful, but teens do not respond well to feeling forced, so it's better to work on just supporting them first.\n\nThe Bottom Line"
