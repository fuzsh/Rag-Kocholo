        "text": "What you are describing sounds like vicarious embarrassment. Apparently, like Schadenfreude (German, meaning satisfaction or pleasure felt at someone else's misfortune), it has no English equivalent.\n\nHere is a summary article, 14 More Wonderful Words With No English Equivalent from the site Mental Floss, that give a couple of words that can be borrowed (just like schadenfreude):\n\nGerman: Fremdschämen\n\nFinnish: Myötähäpeä\n\nboth described this way:\n\nThe kindler, gentler cousins of Schadenfreude, both these words mean something akin to \"vicarious embarrassment.” Or, in other words, that-feeling-you-get-when-you-watch-Meet the Parents.\n\nI would say, \"I am repulsed by what I just witnessed.\"\n\nThe Macmillan Dictionary has two definitions for repulsion, both of which could be how your examples make you feel:\n\n1) a strong feeling of disliking someone or something that is so unpleasant that you feel slightly sick when you see them or think about them\n\n2) physics an electrical or magnetic force that makes things move away from each other\n\nThe word cringe might be useful here. It is to have a physical reaction to something that triggers your senses in a disruptive way. It doesn't necessarily mean you are revolted by it or think it intrinsically malicious or morally bad. But unlike just saying you are \"embarrassed\" it points the source of the reaction as coming from something outside yourself.\n\nYou could also describe the material itself as being cringeworthy (oxforddictionaries.com lists it as a single-word.)\n\n-TRIGGERED- From a future stance to your question, it's sounds like you were \"triggered.\" Maybe certain events that you witness would be, to you, considered socially unacceptable, and can cause you stress Emotional stress can cause physical pain. And, hypothetically, bottling up your unhappiness could be enough to cause this stress when you hear people joking about something or having a good time As far as the mannerisms doing this, that's some DEEP psychological attachments. Subconsciously you could have certain actions linked to certain emotions, linked to physical responses. I wouldn't say suffering or revolted because they seem too broad to define what your after. Especially with the amount of detail you give. \"Cringe\" was probably closest to the action, but I would say you were triggered or repulsed Another word to look at is Psychalgia."
