        "text": "What is pseudobulbar affect (PBA)?\n\nPseudobulbar affect (PBA) is a neurological condition that causes outbursts of uncontrolled or inappropriate laughing or crying. These episodes don’t match your internal emotional state. PBA develops as the result of a brain injury or underlying neurological condition, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\nAlthough episodes of laughing or crying may seem appropriate for the triggering event (such as seeing or hearing something funny or sad), they tend to be more difficult to restrain. They can also be more intense and last longer than you would ordinarily expect.\n\nPBA may be called several other names, including:\n\nEmotional lability.\n\nPathological laughing and crying.\n\nInvoluntary emotional expression disorder.\n\nCompulsive laughing or weeping.\n\nEmotional incontinence.\n\nPBA can have a substantial impact on your life and the lives of your family members and caregivers. It can cause embarrassment and anxiety, leading to withdrawal and social isolation.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n\nHow common is pseudobulbar affect?\n\nResearchers estimate that 2 million to 7 million people in the United States have PBA. This range is large because PBA can vary in severity, and it’s often misdiagnosed.\n\nWho does PBA affect?\n\nPseudobulbar affect (PBA) affects children and adults who have an underlying neurological condition.\n\nStudies estimate that PBA affects:\n\nUp to 50% of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).\n\nUp to 48% of people with traumatic brain injury.\n\nUp to 46% of people with multiple sclerosis (MS).\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIs the pseudobulbar affect a mental illness?\n\nSome people consider PBA a psychiatric disorder (mental illness) since the observable emotional changes (laughing or crying) are associated with mood. However, since PBA results from damaged neurological circuitry in your brain, PBA is best classified as a neuropsychiatric syndrome. In other words, PBA is a brain condition accompanied by dysfunctional emotional expression.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of pseudobulbar affect (PBA)?\n\nIt’s important to know the difference between mood and affect when understanding PBA. Mood is your subjective experience of an emotion. It’s your inner feelings, such as sadness, anger or happiness. Affect is the visible display of emotion that others can see, such as smiling, laughing or crying.\n\nBased on this, the main symptom of pseudobulbar affect is affects — often crying or laughing — that don’t match your mood or the intensity of your mood.\n\nThe laughing and/or crying can:\n\nBe unpredictable, sudden and involuntary.\n\nBe out of proportion to the trigger.\n\nHappen for no apparent reason.\n\nInvoluntary outbursts of anger or frustration may also occur.\n\nSince PBA is often associated with underlying neurological conditions, such as a brain injury or ALS, people with PBA will likely have other symptoms that correspond with the underlying condition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat causes pseudobulbar affect (PBA)?\n\nResearchers don’t know the exact cause of pseudobulbar affect. They think it happens as the result of disruption to the neurological pathways in your brain that regulate emotional expression.\n\nSeveral neurological conditions can cause this disruption and are associated with PBA, including:\n\nTraumatic brain injury.\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.\n\nMultiple sclerosis (MS).\n\nAlzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia.\n\nStroke.\n\nParkinson’s disease.\n\nBrain tumors.\n\nEpilepsy.\n\nWilson’s disease.\n\nWhat part of the brain does PBA affect?\n\nPBA likely affects various brain regions along a cerebro-ponto-cerebellar pathway.\n\nPart of this pathway includes your cerebellum, which plays a key role in monitoring emotional responses and ensuring they’re appropriate to the social situation. Disruption of the neural (nerve) pathways from certain areas of your brain to your cerebellum may lead to a loss or lack of control over emotional expression.\n\nThe following neurotransmitters may also play a role in PBA:\n\nSerotonin.\n\nNorepinephrine.\n\nDopamine.\n\nGlutamate.\n\nAcetylcholine.\n\nHow is pseudobulbar affect diagnosed?\n\nPseudobulbar affect (PBA) can be difficult to diagnose. Healthcare providers often misdiagnose it as a mood disorder — especially depression or bipolar disorder.\n\nCurrently, there’s no definitive test to diagnose PBA. Healthcare providers base a diagnosis on a thorough understanding of your:\n\nSymptoms.\n\nMedical history, especially neurological conditions.\n\nMental health history.\n\nFinding from a physical exam.\n\nWhy is pseudobulbar affect misdiagnosed as depression?\n\nPseudobulbar affect (PBA) tends to be misdiagnosed as a type of mood disorder, especially depression.\n\nThis often happens when crying is the affect you more commonly experience in PBA. People with PBA may also have depression, either due to other causes or as a result of PBA. However, compared to depression, PBA leads to crying episodes that:\n\nAre more explosive in onset.\n\nAre of shorter duration.\n\nUsually aren’t associated with longstanding internal sadness.\n\nEven though people with depression have a persistent mood of sadness, they don’t tend to have frequent crying episodes. If they do, they last much longer than PBA episodes. In addition, other symptoms of depression, such as sleep disturbances or eating changes, don’t occur in PBA."
