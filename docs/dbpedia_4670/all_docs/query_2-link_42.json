        "text": "What is excessive sweating?\n\nExcessive or uncontrollable sweating (hyperhidrosis) can be distressing and embarrassing. But it's also quite common. Around 4 in every 100 Australians have excessive sweating. This means they sweat a lot for no apparent reason, even when they are not hot or doing physical activity.\n\nIf you have excessive sweating, you might sweat so much it soaks through your clothes. Treatments can help lessen the impact of excessive sweating on your life.\n\nThere are 2 main types of excessive sweating that can affect different areas of your body:\n\nFocal hyperhidrosis: excessive sweating with no apparent cause in certain areas of the body, usually the armpits, hands, feet or face.\n\nGeneralised hyperhidrosis: excessive sweating that affects the entire body, usually due to an underlying medical problem.\n\nWhat symptoms are related to excessive sweating?\n\nYou may have excessive sweating if you:\n\nhave visible droplets of sweat that drip off your fingertips or palms\n\nhave sweat that makes your socks and shoes moist\n\nsweat from your armpits that drips down your body\n\nWhat causes sweating?\n\nNormally, when you get very hot or exercise, your nervous system causes your sweat glands to produce fluid that evaporates and cools your body. You may also sweat if you're feeling nervous or stressed.\n\nWhat causes excessive sweating?\n\nMost people with excessive sweating have a condition called 'idiopathic hyperhidrosis'. This means that the cause is unknown. It's possible that the nerves that usually make you sweat become overactive and start the sweat glands even without heat or physical activity.\n\nThis type of hyperhidrosis often runs in families. It often affects your armpits, then your palms and feet and least commonly your face.\n\nFor some people, excessive sweating is caused by a medical condition.\n\nSome medicines can also cause excessive sweating.\n\nHow is the cause of excessive sweating diagnosed?\n\nTo diagnose hyperhidrosis, your doctor will examine you and may do some tests to rule out a medical cause of your excessive sweating.\n\nYour doctor may arrange tests to rule out a medical cause of your excessive sweating such as:\n\ndiabetes\n\nmenopause\n\nthyroid problems\n\nlow blood sugar\n\nsome types of cancer\n\nheart attack\n\nnervous system disorders\n\ninfections\n\nWhen should I see my doctor?\n\nSee your doctor if:\n\nyou suddenly start to sweat more than usual\n\nsweating impacts your daily life\n\nyou have night sweats without a known reason\n\nexcessive sweating makes you feel anxious and unhappy\n\nWhen to seek urgent care\n\nGo to an emergency department or call an ambulance on triple zero (000) if you have excessive sweating together with:\n\nchest pain\n\nfeeling lightheaded\n\nnausea\n\nThese could be a sign of something more serious.\n\nFIND A HEALTH SERVICE — The Service Finder can help you find doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and other health services.\n\nHow is excessive sweating treated?\n\nTreatment depends on the type of hyperhidrosis you have and where the excessive sweating occurs on your body.\n\nSelf-care\n\nIf you suffer from excessive sweating, it's important to keep the affected areas as clean and dry as possible.\n\nYou could use absorbent pads, under your arms to stop the sweat from soaking through your clothes. You may also want to try a strong antiperspirant (containing aluminium).\n\nChoose clothes made from natural fibres such as silk or cotton that allow your skin to breathe. Make sure you carry a spare set of clothes with you.\n\nIf the sweating affects your palms, wearing gloves may help you with day-to-day tasks. If it affects your feet, take your shoes and socks off to air your feet when you can. Consider changing your socks at least 2 times each day.\n\nIt's important to drink plenty of water to replace fluid lost when you sweat.\n\nIf you are upset or embarrassed, it can help to talk to a counsellor or psychologist.\n\nMedicines for excessive sweating\n\nIf you have excessive sweating your doctor may prescribe:\n\nnerve-blocking medicines\n\nantidepressant medicines\n\nbotulinum toxin type A (Botox) — works by reducing the amount of sweat produced by your sweat glands\n\nThese treatments tend to provide temporary relief and they don't work for everyone.\n\nOther treatment options\n\nYou can also speak to your doctor about other treatment options, such as:\n\ntherapy\n\niontophoresis\n\nsurgery\n\nIontophoresis involves a mild electrical current being delivered through water to areas of affected skin. This causes a temporary blockage of your sweat ducts.\n\nIf your hyperhidrosis is severe, or doesn't respond to other treatments your doctor may recommend surgery. This can be a more permanent solution, which removes your sweat glands or severs the nerves. Side effects can include damage to other organs and sweating in other areas after surgery.\n\nPsychotherapy, behaviour therapy and relaxation techniques can help reduce anxiety and improve your quality of life.\n\nCan excessive sweating be prevented?\n\nExcessive sweating may get better with age.\n\nTreatments are also available to help reduce sweating. Surgery can help some people however this has side effects.\n\nComplications of excessive sweating\n\nExcessive sweating doesn't affect your health, but it can affect your quality of life. Many people with this condition can find it makes them unhappy, depressed, anxious or embarrassed. It can affect your social life, work, relationships and confidence.\n\nIt can also lead to complications such as dermatitis, and physical discomfort.\n\nResources and support\n\nThe Australasian College of Dermatologists has information on the main types of excessive sweating."
