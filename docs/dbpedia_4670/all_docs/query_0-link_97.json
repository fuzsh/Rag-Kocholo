        "text": "Let’s start with a dictionary definition of shame. Shame is the painful emotion caused by a consciousness of guilt or shortcoming or impropriety. Let me illustrate each of those causes.\n\nFirst, the cause of guilt. Suppose you act against your conscience and withhold information on your tax returns. For a couple years you feel nothing because it has been put out of your mind, and you weren’t caught. Then you are called to account by the IRS and it becomes public knowledge that you lied and you stole. Your guilt is known. Now in the light of public censure you feel the pain of shame.\n\nOr take the cause of shortcoming. In the Olympics suppose you come from a little country where you are quite good in the 3,000-meter race. Then you compete before thousands of people in Seoul, and the competition is so tough that by the time the last lap comes up, you are a whole lap behind everyone else, and you must keep running all by yourself while everyone watches. There’s no guilt here. But the humiliation and shame could be intense.\n\nOr take the cause of impropriety. You are invited to a party and you find out when you get there that you dressed all wrong. Again, no evil or guilt. Just a social blunder, an impropriety that makes you feel foolish and embarrassed.\n\nWell-Placed Versus Misplaced Shame\n\nOne of the things that jumps right out at you from this definition of shame is that there is some shame that is justified and some that isn’t. There are some situations where shame is exactly what we should feel. And there are some situations where we shouldn’t. Most people would say that the liar ought to be ashamed. And most people would probably say that the long distance runner who gave it his best shot ought not to feel ashamed. Disappointment would be healthy, but not shame.\n\nLet me illustrate from Scripture these two kinds of shame. The Bible makes very clear that there is a shame we ought to have and a shame we ought not to have. I’m going to call the one kind, “misplaced shame” and the other kind “well-placed shame.”\n\nMisplaced shame (the kind we ought not to have) is the shame you feel when there is no good reason to feel it. Biblically, that means the thing you feel ashamed of is not dishonoring to God; or that it is dishonoring to God, but you didn’t have a hand in it. In other words, misplaced shame is shame for something that’s good — something that doesn’t dishonor God. Or it’s shame for something bad but which you didn’t have any sinful hand in. That’s the kind of shame we ought not have.\n\nWell-placed shame (the kind you ought to have) is the shame you feel when there is good reason to feel it. Biblically, that means we feel ashamed of something because our involvement in it was dishonoring to God. We ought to feel shame when we have a hand in bringing dishonor upon God by our attitudes or actions.\n\n“If we want to battle shame at the root, we have to know how it relates to God.”\n\nI want to be sure you see how important God is in this distinction between misplaced shame and well-placed shame. Whether we have a hand in honoring God or dishonoring God makes all the difference. If we want to battle shame at the root, we have to know how it relates to God. And we do need to battle shame at the root — all shame. Because both misplaced shame and well-placed shame can cripple us if we don’t know how to deal with them at the root.\n\nMisplaced Shame\n\nSo let’s look at some Scriptures that illustrate misplaced shame and some that illustrate well-placed shame.\n\nSecond Timothy 1:8\n\nDo not be ashamed then of testifying to our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but take your share of suffering for the gospel in the power of God.\n\nWhat this text says is that if you feel shame for testifying about Jesus, you have a misplaced shame. We ought not to feel shame for this. Christ is honored when we speak well of him. And he is dishonored by fearful silence. So it is not a shameful thing to testify, but a shameful thing not to.\n\nSecondly, the text says that if you feel shame that a friend of yours is in trouble (in this case: prison) for Jesus’s sake, then your shame is misplaced. The world may see this as a sign of weakness and defeat. But Christians know better. God is honored by the courage of his servants to go to prison for his name. We ought not to feel shame that we are associated with something that honors God in this way, no matter how much scorn the world heaps on.\n\nMark 8:38\n\nWhoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.\n\nShame is misplaced when we feel it because of the person or the words of Jesus. If Jesus says, “Love your enemies,” and others laugh and call it unrealistic, we should not feel ashamed. If Jesus says, “Fornication is evil,” and liberated yuppies label it out of date, we should not feel shame to stand with Jesus. That would be misplaced shame because the words of Jesus are true and God-honoring, no matter how foolish the world may try to make them look.\n\nFirst Peter 4:16\n\nIf one suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but under that name let him glorify God.\n\nSuffering and being reproached and made fun of as a Christian is not an occasion for shame, because it is an occasion for glorifying God. In other words, in the Bible the criterion for what is well-placed shame and what is misplaced shame is not how foolish or how bad you look to men, but whether you in fact bring honor to God.\n\nThis is so important to grasp, because much of what makes us feel shame is not that we have brought dishonor on God by our actions, but that we have failed to give the appearance that other people admire. Much of our shame is not God-centered, but self-centered. Until we get a good handle on this, we will not be able to battle the problem of shame at its root.\n\nRomans 1:16\n\nI am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes.\n\nThe reason shame in the gospel would be a misplaced shame is that the gospel is the very power of God unto salvation. The gospel magnifies God and humbles man. And so to the world the gospel doesn’t look like power at all. It looks like weakness (asking people to be like children and depend on Jesus, instead of standing on their own two feet). But for those who believe it is the power of almighty God to save sinners.\n\nSecond Corinthians 12:9–10\n\nJesus said [to Paul], “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” I will all the more gladly exult in my weakness, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities; for when I am weak, then I am strong.\n\nNow ordinarily weaknesses and insults are occasions for shame. But for Paul they are occasions for exultation. Paul thinks that shame in his weaknesses and shame at insults and persecutions would be misplaced shame. Why? Because the power of Christ is perfected in Paul’s weakness.\n\nI conclude from all these texts that the biblical criterion for misplaced shame is radically God-centered. The biblical criterion says, don’t feel shame for something that honors God no matter how weak or foolish it makes you look in the eyes of unbelievers.\n\nWell-Placed Shame\n\nThe same God-centeredness will be seen if we look at some texts that illustrate well-placed shame.\n\nFirst Corinthians 15:34\n\nCome to your right mind, and sin no more. For some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.\n\nHere, Paul says that these people ought to feel shame. “I say this to your shame.” Their shame would be well-placed if they saw their deplorable ignorance of God and how it was leading to false doctrine (no resurrection) and sin in the church. In other words, well-placed shame is shame for what dishonors God — ignorance of God, sin against God, false beliefs about God.\n\nFirst Corinthians 6:5\n\nThe Christians were going to secular courts to settle disputes among themselves. Paul rebukes them.\n\nI say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no man among you wise enough to decide between members of the brotherhood? Again he says they should feel shame: “I say this to your shame.” Their shame would be well-placed because their behavior is bringing such disrepute upon their God as they fight one another and seek help from the godless to settle their disputes. A well-placed shame is the shame you feel because you are involved in dishonoring God.\n\nAnd let’s not miss this implication: these people were trying their best to appear strong and right. They wanted to be vindicated by men. They wanted to be winners in court. They didn’t want anyone to run over them as though they had no rights. That would look weak and shameful. So in the very act of wanting to avoid shame as the world sees it, they fell into the very behavior that God counts shameful.\n\nThe point is: when you are dishonoring God, you ought to feel shame, no matter how strong or wise or right you are in the eyes of men.\n\nEzekiel 43:10\n\nAnd you, son of man, describe to the house of Israel the temple and its appearance and plan, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities.\n\n“Sin is always a proper cause for shame because sin is behavior that dishonors God.”\n\nGod says Israel ought to feel shame for its iniquities. Sin is always a proper cause for shame because sin is behavior that dishonors God. (See also Romans 6:21; 2 Thessalonians 3:14 for more instances of well-placed shame.)\n\nWe can conclude from all these texts that the biblical criterion for misplaced shame and for well-placed shame is radically God-centered.\n\nThe biblical criterion for misplaced shame says, “Don’t feel shame for something that honors God, no matter how weak or foolish or wrong it makes you look in the eyes of men. And don’t feel shame for bad circumstances where you don’t share in dishonoring God.”\n\nThe biblical criterion for well-placed shame says, “Do feel shame for having a hand in anything that dishonors God, no matter how strong or wise or right it makes you look in the eyes of men.”\n\nThree Instances of Battling Misplaced Shame\n\nNow how do you battle this painful emotion called shame? The answer is that we battle it by battling the unbelief that feeds its life. And we fight for faith in the promises of God that overcome shame and relieve us from its pain. Let me illustrate with three instances.\n\n1. When Well-Placed Shame Lingers Too Long\n\nIn the case of well-placed shame for sin the pain ought to be there but it ought not to stay there. If it does, it’s owing to unbelief in the promises of God.\n\nFor example, a woman comes to Jesus in a Pharisee’s house weeping and washing his feet. No doubt she felt shame as the eyes of Simon communicated to everyone present that this woman was a sinner and that Jesus had no business letting her touch him. Indeed she was a sinner. There was a place for true shame, but not for too long. Jesus said, “Your sins are forgiven” (Luke 7:48). And when the guests murmured about this, he helped her faith again by saying, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace” (verse 50).\n\nHow did Jesus help her battle the crippling effects of shame? He gave her a promise: “Your sins are forgiven! Your faith has saved you. Your future will be one of peace.” So the issue for her was belief. Would she believe the glowering condemnation of the guests? Or would she believe the reassuring words of Jesus that her shame was enough? She’s forgiven. She’s saved. She may go in peace.\n\nAnd that is the way every one of us must battle the effects of a well-placed shame that threatens to linger too long and cripple us. We must battle unbelief by taking hold of promises like,\n\nThere is forgiveness with thee that thou mayest be feared. (Psalm 130:4)\n\nSeek the Lord while he may be found. Call upon him while he is near. Let the wicked man forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts. Let him return to the Lord that he may have mercy on him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon. (Isaiah 55:6)\n\nIf we confess our sins he is faithful and just and will forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. (1 John 1:9)\n\nJesus Christ came into the world to save sinners of whom I am chief. (1 Timothy 1:15)\n\nEvery one who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name. (Acts 10:43; 13:39)\n\n2. Feeling Shame for Something That Glorifies God\n\nThe second instance of battling shame is the instance of feeling shame for something that is not even bad but in fact glorifies God — like Jesus or the gospel.\n\nOur text shows how Paul battled against this misplaced shame. In verse 12 he says, “Therefore I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, I am sure that he is able to guard until that Day what has been entrusted to me.”\n\nPaul makes very clear here that the battle against misplaced shame is a battle against unbelief. “I am not ashamed for I know whom I have believed and I am sure of his keeping power.” We fight against feelings of shame in Christ and the gospel and the Christian ethic by battling unbelief in the promises of God. Do we believe that the gospel is the power of God unto salvation? Do we believe that Christ’s power is made perfect in our weakness? The battle against misplaced shame is the battle against unbelief in the promises of God.\n\n3. Feeling Shame for Something We Didn’t Do\n\nFinally, the last instance of battling shame is the instance where others try to load us with shame for evil circumstances when in fact we had no part in dishonoring God.\n\nIt happened to Jesus. They called him a winebibber and a glutton. They called him a temple destroyer. They called him a hypocrite: He healed others, but he can’t heal himself. In all this the goal was to load Jesus with a shame that was not his to bear.\n\nThe same with Paul. They called him mad when he defended himself in court. They called him an enemy of the Jewish customs and a breaker of the Mosaic law. They said he taught that you should sin that grace may abound. All this to load him with a shame that it was not his to bear.\n\n“No one who banks his hope on the promises of God will be put to shame.”\n\nAnd it has happened to you. And will happen again. How do you battle this misplaced shame? By believing the promises of God that in the end all the efforts to put us to shame will fail. We may struggle now to know what is our shame to bear and what is not. But God has a promise for us in either case:\n\nIsrael is saved by the Lord with everlasting salvation; you shall not be put to shame or confounded to all eternity. (Isaiah 45:17; 49:23)\n\nNo one who believes in the Lord will be put to shame. (Romans 10:11; 9:33)\n\nIn other words, for all the evil and deceit judgment and criticism that others may use to heap on us a shame that is not ours to bear, and for all the distress and spiritual warfare it brings, the promise stands sure that they will not succeed in the end. All the children of God will be vindicated. The truth will be known. And no one who banks his hope on the promises of God will be put to shame."
