        "text": "Overview\n\nIt's normal to feel nervous in some social situations. For example, going on a date or giving a presentation may cause that feeling of butterflies in your stomach. But in social anxiety disorder, also called social phobia, everyday interactions cause significant anxiety, self-consciousness and embarrassment because you fear being scrutinized or judged negatively by others.\n\nIn social anxiety disorder, fear and anxiety lead to avoidance that can disrupt your life. Severe stress can affect your relationships, daily routines, work, school or other activities.\n\nSocial anxiety disorder can be a chronic mental health condition, but learning coping skills in psychotherapy and taking medications can help you gain confidence and improve your ability to interact with others.\n\nSocial anxiety disorder care at Mayo Clinic\n\nSymptoms\n\nFeelings of shyness or discomfort in certain situations aren't necessarily signs of social anxiety disorder, particularly in children. Comfort levels in social situations vary, depending on personality traits and life experiences. Some people are naturally reserved and others are more outgoing.\n\nIn contrast to everyday nervousness, social anxiety disorder includes fear, anxiety and avoidance that interfere with relationships, daily routines, work, school or other activities. Social anxiety disorder typically begins in the early to mid-teens, though it can sometimes start in younger children or in adults.\n\nEmotional and behavioral symptoms\n\nSigns and symptoms of social anxiety disorder can include constant:\n\nFear of situations in which you may be judged negatively\n\nWorry about embarrassing or humiliating yourself\n\nIntense fear of interacting or talking with strangers\n\nFear that others will notice that you look anxious\n\nFear of physical symptoms that may cause you embarrassment, such as blushing, sweating, trembling or having a shaky voice\n\nAvoidance of doing things or speaking to people out of fear of embarrassment\n\nAvoidance of situations where you might be the center of attention\n\nAnxiety in anticipation of a feared activity or event\n\nIntense fear or anxiety during social situations\n\nAnalysis of your performance and identification of flaws in your interactions after a social situation\n\nExpectation of the worst possible consequences from a negative experience during a social situation\n\nFor children, anxiety about interacting with adults or peers may be shown by crying, having temper tantrums, clinging to parents or refusing to speak in social situations.\n\nPerformance type of social anxiety disorder is when you experience intense fear and anxiety during speaking or performing in public but not in other types of more general social situations.\n\nPhysical symptoms\n\nPhysical signs and symptoms can sometimes accompany social anxiety disorder and may include:\n\nBlushing\n\nFast heartbeat\n\nTrembling\n\nSweating\n\nUpset stomach or nausea\n\nTrouble catching your breath\n\nDizziness or lightheadedness\n\nFeeling that your mind has gone blank\n\nMuscle tension\n\nAvoiding common social situations\n\nCommon, everyday experiences may be hard to endure when you have social anxiety disorder, including:\n\nInteracting with unfamiliar people or strangers\n\nAttending parties or social gatherings\n\nGoing to work or school\n\nStarting conversations\n\nMaking eye contact\n\nDating\n\nEntering a room in which people are already seated\n\nReturning items to a store\n\nEating in front of others\n\nUsing a public restroom\n\nSocial anxiety disorder symptoms can change over time. They may flare up if you're facing a lot of changes, stress or demands in your life. Although avoiding situations that produce anxiety may make you feel better in the short term, your anxiety is likely to continue over the long term if you don't get treatment.\n\nWhen to see a doctor\n\nSee your doctor or a mental health professional if you fear and avoid normal social situations because they cause embarrassment, worry or panic.\n\nThere is a problem with information submitted for this request.

Possible causes include:\n\nInherited traits. Anxiety disorders tend to run in families. However, it isn't entirely clear how much of this may be due to genetics and how much is due to learned behavior.\n\nBrain structure. A structure in the brain called the amygdala (uh-MIG-duh-luh) may play a role in controlling the fear response. People who have an overactive amygdala may have a heightened fear response, causing increased anxiety in social situations.\n\nEnvironment. Social anxiety disorder may be a learned behavior â€” some people may develop significant anxiety after an unpleasant or embarrassing social situation. Also, there may be an association between social anxiety disorder and parents who either model anxious behavior in social situations or are more controlling or overprotective of their children.\n\nRisk factors\n\nSeveral factors can increase the risk of developing social anxiety disorder, including:\n\nFamily history. You're more likely to develop social anxiety disorder if your biological parents or siblings have the condition.\n\nNegative experiences. Children who experience teasing, bullying, rejection, ridicule or humiliation may be more prone to social anxiety disorder. In addition, other negative events in life, such as family conflict, trauma or abuse, may be associated with this disorder.\n\nTemperament. Children who are shy, timid, withdrawn or restrained when facing new situations or people may be at greater risk.\n\nNew social or work demands. Social anxiety disorder symptoms typically start in the teenage years, but meeting new people, giving a speech in public or making an important work presentation may trigger symptoms for the first time.\n\nHaving an appearance or condition that draws attention. For example, facial disfigurement, stuttering or tremors due to Parkinson's disease can increase feelings of self-consciousness and may trigger social anxiety disorder in some people.\n\nComplications\n\nLeft untreated, social anxiety disorder can control your life. Anxieties can interfere with work, school, relationships or enjoyment of life. This disorder can cause:\n\nLow self-esteem\n\nTrouble being assertive\n\nNegative self-talk\n\nHypersensitivity to criticism\n\nPoor social skills\n\nIsolation and difficult social relationships\n\nLow academic and employment achievement\n\nSubstance abuse, such as drinking too much alcohol\n\nSuicide or suicide attempts\n\nOther anxiety disorders and certain other mental health disorders, particularly major depressive disorder and substance abuse problems, often occur with social anxiety disorder.\n\nPrevention\n\nThere's no way to predict what will cause someone to develop an anxiety disorder, but you can take steps to reduce the impact of symptoms if you're anxious:\n\nGet help early. Anxiety, like many other mental health conditions, can be harder to treat if you wait.\n\nKeep a journal. Keeping track of your personal life can help you and your mental health professional identify what's causing you stress and what seems to help you feel better.\n\nSet priorities in your life. You can reduce anxiety by carefully managing your time and energy. Make sure that you spend time doing things you enjoy.\n\nAvoid unhealthy substance use. Alcohol and drug use and even caffeine or nicotine use can cause or worsen anxiety. If you're addicted to any of these substances, quitting can make you anxious. If you can't quit on your own, see your health care provider or find a treatment program or support group to help you.\n\nSocial anxiety disorder (social phobia) care at Mayo Clinic\n\nSocial anxiety disorder (social phobia).
