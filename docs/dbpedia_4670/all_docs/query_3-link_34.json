        "text": "A: I’m sorry I did that.\n\nB: It’s okay. It’s not your fault. It’s a disease.\n\nA: No, but I embarrassed you. I embarrassed you, and I…\n\nB: I’m not embarrassed of you.\n\nA: It was so wrong. And then your dad…\n\nB: My father loves you, it’s okay.\n\nQuestion: The preposition in the sentence “I’m not embarrassed of you” is correct, right? How about “I’m not embarrassed BY you”? Is it still okay?\n\nThank you!!!\n\nI (middle America) think that “embarrassed by” sounds more natural and common. The phrase as given in the subtitle isn’t too bad, though. My common usage is “embarrassed by” but “ashamed of”.\n\nWhat is bad, in my opinion (don’t try to convince me otherwise!), is “I embarrassed you and I”. Both pronouns are direct objects, and the objective form of “I” is “me”. The proper phrase is “I embarrassed you and me.” However, the wording shown in the subtitle is becoming very common, and I believe I know why. When I was young kids would often say something like “Me and Joey are going to play”, and Mother would correct them with “Joey and I”, which is correct for the subject of a sentence. But the stupid kids over-corrected and grew up using \"Joey and I’ even in the objective when the correct wording is “Joey and me”.\n\nThis happened so much in my experience that my mother also overcorrected herself and now she often wrongly corrects me when I correctly use me instead of I!\n\nBut the comma and ellipsis in the subtitle mean that this is not an example of that. The speaker is saying, ‘I embarrassed you [pause] [different thought] and I [interrupted, thought incomplete].’\n\nIt’s simply a matter of grammar:\n\nembarrassed about: He’s embarrassed about his weight.\n\nembarrassed at: He felt acutely embarrassed at being the centre of attention.\n\nembarrassed by: He seemed somewhat embarrassed by his own outburst.\n\nembarrassed for: His face flushed red and she felt embarrassed for him.\n\nembarrassed about, embarrassed at, embarrassed for, embarrassed by are all correct, whilst “embarrassed of” is wrong.\n\nIf you were taking an exam in English and you wrote “embarrassed of” you’d be taking an unnecessary risk of being marked down.\n\nSure, language is always changing and morphology develops or decays, you can find examples of incorrect usage everywhere.\n\n[Check out “alright” vs “all right” Merriam-Webster 2010, hardcopy edition]"
