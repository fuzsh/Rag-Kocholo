If you do not, the registrar will choose your child’s given name for you. If you do not agree, you can request the courts to change the given name within six weeks. You will need a lawyer to arrange this for you.\n\nGiven name of a child with foreign or dual nationality\n\nYou can give your child a Dutch given name even if he or she has foreign or dual nationality. Please be aware that some countries will not accept a Dutch given name. For more information ask the consulate.\n\nLaw on names"
