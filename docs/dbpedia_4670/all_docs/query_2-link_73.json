        "text": "If the fear of embarrassment is interrupting your life or keeping you from socializing with your friends, there are things you can do to help overcome embarrassment.\n\n1. Focus on the future\n\nTo put your problems into perspective, Dr. Holly Schiff, a licensed clinical psychologist based in Greenwich, Connecticut, suggests using the 5×5 rule.\n\nThe 5×5 rule is when you take a moment to think about whether this will matter to you in five years. If it won’t matter in 5 years, you shouldn’t spend more than 5 minutes stressing about it.\n\nBy thinking long term, you’re putting the experience in context and giving yourself perspective and permission to let it go, says Schiff.\n\n2. Reroute your energies\n\nIf you tend to dwell on embarrassment, consider refocusing your energy on something more positive. For instance, instead of replaying your mistake over and over in your mind, try to refocus your thoughts on what you can learn from your misstep.\n\nIf you find the situation still ruminates in your mind hours later, you could refocus your energy on a task you haven’t had time to do, like grocery shopping or paying the bills.\n\n3. Calm the body\n\nWhen you’re dealing with embarrassing thoughts, you may find it hard to cultivate a calm state in your mind and body. A simple breathing exercise can work wonders, bring you back into your body, and make you more mindful of everything around you, says Schiff.\n\nCombining deep belly breathing, holding breath, and long exhales is a great way to regulate your emotions and bring a calming response to your body.\n\n4. Rethink the situation\n\nYou can use a technique from cognitive behavioral therapy to address any intrusive negative thoughts about your embarrassing situation: jotting down your thoughts and feelings during the situation. Then try creating a healthier perspective.\n\nFor example, say you blanked during a presentation and abruptly left the room. You might feel embarrassed and think you’ll get fired.\n\nInstead, a healthy alternative perspective of this situation might be to:\n\nremind yourself no one is perfect and everybody makes mistakes\n\ntake responsibility for leaving and apologize to your boss\n\ncommunicate you’d like more presentation training and possibly acquire a speaking coach\n\n5. Look on the positive side\n\nGetting embarrassed does have some upsides. For starters, all emotions have purpose.\n\nBeing embarrassed also helps us to relate to others. It helps us to self-reflect and correct our mistakes. “It can also help us fit into social circles, which is part of our survival.”\n\nYou are not alone. Feeling embarrassed is a universal experience. You can learn from your mistakes, and if you find through self-reflection that other issues are swimming beneath the surface, you can reach out to a friend or therapist to seek additional support.\n\nThere are unlimited causes of embarrassment, but it usually happens when you’re in front of people and feels like you haven’t performed or responded well.\n\nFor example, findings from a 2015 study suggest people tend to feel embarrassed when they think they’ve failed at something in the public eye.\n\nEmbarrassment can also come from unwanted attention to a personal flaw or mistake, which then triggers guilt and shame, says Schiff.\n\nBrooklyn-based psychotherapist Emmy Kleine, a licensed mental health counselor, says clients tend to feel embarrassed about three things:\n\ntheir finances\n\ntheir sexual activity\n\ntheir physique\n\nAnd they assume these issues are unique to them. They assume their behavior isn’t natural.\n\nWashington, D.C.-licensed psychotherapist, Lena Derhally says her clients tend to feel most embarrassed at work or in social situations. She says this is where they feel most judged by their peers.\n\nFolks feel embarrassed about making mistakes and wonder if they said the wrong thing at a get-together, for example.\n\nReasons you might become frequently embarrassed\n\nEmbarrassment is an individual experience. You may feel embarrassed of yourself or on the behalf of others. This may be due to having:\n\na highly sensitive persona\n\nsocial anxiety\n\nlow self-worth\n\nworrying about past mistakes\n\nKleine believes that embarrassment is a learned response. Whether certain behaviors are acceptable or not, she says we learn from:\n\nsociety\n\nour caregivers\n\nour teachers\n\nothers\n\nSometimes we learn these lessons because someone shamed us.\n\nDerhally believes some people are more easily embarrassed than others because they have a louder, harsher inner critic.\n\n“If someone has a strong inner critic, the feelings of embarrassment and shame are quite pervasive and constant. Someone with less of an inner critic can laugh and shrug things off much easier.”\n\nWhere the inner critic stems from is more complex, explains Derhally. It might be a combination of personality traits:\n\nuptight\n\nrigid\n\nperfectionist\n\nenvironmental\n\nMaybe you had critical or emotionally unavailable caregivers. Maybe you were bullied. Derhally has worked with clients whose inner critics were shaped by their experiences with bullies in junior high and high school.\n\nKleine said other deeper issues may underlie our embarrassment, such as:\n\nstress from work\n\nworry or concern\n\nyour ego\n\nFor instance, if you work in a toxic environment, where you feel you have to walk on eggshells. Any time you make an error, it can easily become a source of shame for your. If you’re a highly sensitive person, it wouldn’t take much to make you feel self-conscious in this type of environment."
