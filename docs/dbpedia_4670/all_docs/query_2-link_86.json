        "text": "'Cringy' is an informal word that's used to say that something is pathetic, cheesy or embarrassing.\n\nOrigins of the word\n\nThe word 'cringy' is related to the word 'cringe', which means to grimace or feel embarrassment on behalf of someone else (when someone else does something embarrassing, you might cringe because their embarrassing action makes you feel uncomfortable).\n\nSo then, 'cringy' is the adjective used to describe the embarrassing action or thing which makes you cringe.\n\nVariations and word building\n\nThis word can also be written as 'cringey'.\n\nBeing an adjective, we can also write it in its comparative and superlative forms, 'cringier' and 'cringiest'.\n\nExamples\n\nThe park was full of pre-teen girls recording cringy dance videos.\n\nWill Dad ever realise just how cringy that cowboy hat is?\n\nIt was as if he'd collected all the cringiest songs ever written into one playlist.\n\nThe class party was lame enough, but when the teacher decided to put on karaoke from the 2000's it got even cringier.\n\nCRINGY - A difficult word to define, but I will try. Let's start with the definition:\n\nCringy - Adjective - something that makes you feel awkward.\n\nAnd also...\n\nAwkward - Adjective - something which causes a feeling of unease and makes you feel uncomfortable, maybe even embarrassed.\n\nEmbarrassed - Adjective - ashamed of something and worried about what other people will think of you.\n\nAshamed - Adjective - a feeling that you did something wrong and that you have not reached the standard that people expect.\n\n(I think it is useful to learn words in groups, what do you think?)\n\nNow let's look at a couple of examples (a couple of = 2)\n\n1) \"Urgh, he told a bad joke and nobody laughed at all. It was so cringy!\"\n\nSimple English - Oh my god, he told a joke and it was not funny at all. It made me feel uncomfortable, I did't know what to do - it was \"cringy\"\n\nUrgh - expletive - meaning, oh no.\n\n2) \"Dude, that Star Wars t-shirt is so cringy, you can't wear that for your date tonight, she will think you're sad!\"\n\nSimple English - My friend, that Star Wars t-shirt is not cool at all, in fact, it is uncool. Don't wear it because the girl you are meeting tonight will think you are a loser (sad)\n\nDude - noun - man/friend (US English, but also sometimes used in British English)\n\nSo there you go, that is what \"cringy\" means. I hope you found my explanation and examples useful, thanks for reading :)\n\nIntroduction:\n\nCringy is a descriptive adjective which means: to make someone feel uneasy, nervous, awkward, or timid. Cringy was first used in 1986 and added to the dictionary soon after.\n\nSynonyms: draw back, recoil, flinch, wince, cower\n\nAntonyms: Advance, Approach, Go in the direction of, Stand up to\n\nSentence Examples\n\nThe gruesome crime scene photos caused the police to cringe.\n\nThe cringy music caused my ears to bleed.\n\nA cringy moment of embarrassment brough shame to the child.\n\nConclusion\n\nUsing cringy in writing can bring stories to life as you add depth to your characters. Cringy is another word to add to your growing vocabulary list.\n\n“Cringy” is when something is so unpleasant that it makes you literally cringe.\n\n\"Cringe\" means to feel disgust or embarrassment and often to show the feeling by a movement of your face or body.\n\nPreferred Spelling\n\nThe preferred spelling is “Cringey” with “Cringy” being less common. Both are the informal adjective form of the noun “cringe.”\n\nExample\n\nPerson A: I always cringe when I hear that song.\n\nPerson B: If only their lyrics weren't so cringey.\n\nDictionaries\n\nhttps://www.dictionary.com/\n\nhttps://dictionary.cambridge.org/\n\nhttps://www.collinsdictionary.com/"
