        "text": "If thereâs one essential thing you need to pack on your trip to the UK this year, itâs knowledge of the slang words Brits canât stop using. Just imagine arriving in London and looking super strange because you canât communicate with the locals. IMAGINE! Luckily, Iâm here to teach you nine common British terms you canât live without.\n\n1. Bagsy\n\nThe equivalent to shotgun in US English, this is what you say when youâre claiming something before everyone else, like the front seat of the car or the last scone (if you donât know what a scone is, Google it and then sit in shame for a while. Then find a recipe for scones and make some).\n\n2. Chips\n\nThink you know how to order French fries in Britain? Youâre wrong! In the UK we have a worryingly high number of words for different types of potato foods. We call French fries just fries, and thicker-cut fries that come from a chip shop are called chips. Then youâve got thick, triangular chunks which we call potato wedges, which arenât the same as circular fried slices (otherwise known as chips in other countries) which we call crisps. Thatâs all before you move onto the more complex crisp types, like Tortilla Chips (which count as crisps but are called chips, but arenât chips like actual chips). Maybe just stick to healthy foods to avoid confusion?\n\n3. Chuffed\n\nIf youâre really pleased or delighted about something, youâre chuffed. If youâre really delighted about something you can even be chuffed to bits. Chuffed used to mean âplumpâ, so Iâm not sure why or how it now means delighted. Just roll with it.\n\n4. Dodgy\n\nWhen somethingâs questionable for suspicious, we call it dodgy. Itâs a funky throwback to 1990s street slang and just fun to say.\n\n5. Miffed\n\nWhen somethingâs made you unhappy or annoyed, you could say youâre miffed. This one might not be the coolest slang to use with the younger crowd, but theyâd probably use something much more NSFW. Best to stay as polite as you can and use the PG13 version.\n\n6. Quid\n\nThis oneâs so common you canât get by without knowing it. In the UK quid is slang for a one pound coin. Be careful to clearly pronounce any words before this that end in an âsâ because otherwise itâll sound like youâre saying squid, which hilarious but inaccurate.\n\n7. Uni\n\nWant to study at aÂ university in the UK? Make sure youâre calling it by the right name. In Britain, college means something totally different to what it means in the US, where itâs another word for university. UK colleges are for students aged between 16 and 18, who graduate from there to go to university, which is shortened to just uni. If you donât get it right, you might end up studying in the wrong place and with people 2 years younger than you. How embarrassing!\n\n8. Gutted\n\nDidnât get into the uni you wanted to go to? Youâre probably really disappointed and upset â otherwise known as gutted. Where this comes from is anyoneâs guess, but it probably has something to do with the sad feeling you get in your gut when youâre upset.\n\n9. Skive\n\nMaybe you did get into your favorite uni, but you keep faking illness to get out of classes. Firstly, shame on you. Secondly, thereâs a word for this and itâs called to skive. The âskiâ part is pronounced like sky not ski. Now get back to class!"
