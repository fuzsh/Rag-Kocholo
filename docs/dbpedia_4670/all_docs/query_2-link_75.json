        "text": "Stigma toward embarrassing diseases can decrease the quality of life.\n\nFirst, no illness is embarrassing. Scientifically, every illness results from disturbances in the body's physiology and requires prompt diagnosis and treatment.\n\nEmbarrassment due to symptoms or illness will only make your suffering worse and symptoms deadlier and may even cause further spread of the disease. There is a vast list of unpleasant health issues that people in the United States face, but most people will not disclose them because they feel humiliated.\n\nWhen a person is diagnosed with a condition, they fear that other people may develop negative attitudes and opinions about their behavior, lifestyle, or living circumstances. These unfavorable connections combine to generate what is known as stigma. However, health and mental peace rank above everything else, and this must never be forgotten.\n\n8 common embarrassing signs and symptoms\n\nEight common embarrassing signs and symptoms include:\n\nExcessive sweating\n\nConstipation\n\nBad breath\n\nFlatulence\n\nRectal itch\n\nSmelly feet\n\nBody odor\n\nVaginal odor\n\nWhat are the potential risks of stigma?\n\nStigma toward embarrassing diseases or illnesses can decrease quality of life because it includes:\n\nJudging\n\nLabeling\n\nIsolation\n\nPrejudice\n\nStereotyping\n\nDiscrimination\n\nThese types of reactions to people living with diseases are based on misinformation about the infection. Stigma remains one of the greatest barriers for the United States in accessing:\n\nPrevention\n\nTesting\n\nTreatment\n\nSupport\n\nHow can we end stigma?\n\nEfforts to end stigma will help:\n\nPrevent new infections.\n\nReach the undiagnosed.\n\nEnsure that people receive the care, treatment, and support they need.\n\nYour doctor has heard it all and is here to help you. Inform your doctor about any current or previous healthcare difficulties or concerns. Even if you're embarrassed, it's critical to disclose whatever information you have.\n\nA diagnosis or symptoms may be humiliating at times, but they may indicate a dangerous problem. Doctors are well-versed in such topics, so there's no need to be embarrassed about describing your problems."
