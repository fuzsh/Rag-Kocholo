Wedding of King Farouk of Egypt and the 17 year-old Narriman Sadek at the Abdeen Palace in Cairo on this day in 1951. The lavish wedding was held at a tumultous time for the Egyptian Monarchy, and this was the Kingâ€™s second marriage, after he divorced his first Queen when the match failed to produce a son. Queen Narriman gave birth to a son the following year, who succeeded to the Throne just months later, after the forced abdication of King Farouk, ruling for a a year before the abolition of the Monarchy. King Farouk and Queen Narriman divorced in 1954.
