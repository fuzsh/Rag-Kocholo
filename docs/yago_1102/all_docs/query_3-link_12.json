        "text": "922F, Many thanks for this additional information about hallmarks for monarchy in exile Orders. I can find a website for Royal Insignia out of Singapore and Brunei, but are you able to provide some information where I can learn something about Worth? Do you have any images of the hallmarks for any of these manufacturers?\n\nI have a couple variants of hallmarks to add here. Below are a few images of hallmarks on a cased set of the Grand Cordon Class of the Order of Ismail from an April 2018 auction by La Galerie Numismatique archived on the live auctioneer.com website (https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/60483636_order-of-ismail). This is a set made by Lattes. The sash badge is identified as measuring 62 mm wide x 82 mm high (the height must include the entire suspension loop) and the breast star measures 82 mm in diameter. This example has a couple of interesting aspects to its hallmarks. The hallmarks on the reverse of the suspension loop of the sash badge include only 2 of the 3 potential hallmarks. Although difficult to see in the lower-resolution of the images of the reverse the sash badge, the date mark (\"B\"=) can be seen but the other hallmark is likely to be the fineness mark of 18 carats. The hallmarks I illustrated previously include all 3 hallmarks on the reverse of the suspension loop of the two examples of the 3rd Class Commander's neck badge made by Lattes (last photo in my post here of 13 December, 2018; the 10th photo from the first showing hallmarks on examples of the Order of Ismail in my post of 11 January, 2019 which also includes what is the 14 carat European assay mark of \"585\"). On 11 January I also illustrated the reverse of the the suspension loop on the neck badge of a 2nd Class Grand Officer example belonging to Dr. Quirico (6th photo in the group of hallmarks on Order of Ismail insignia) made by Lattes that has only 2 hallmarks: the 18 carat fineness mark and the \"Z\" date mark for 1924-25. My 11 January post also shows another example of a Grand Cordon Class of the Order of Ismail made by Tewfik Bichay that is marked with only 2 hallmarks on the reverse of the suspension loop (the Cairo assay mark of 18 carats and the date hallmark), and that example also has only the same 2 hallmarks (both lacking the ibis denoting Egyptian gold manufacture) on the reverse of the central boss of the sash badge below Bichay's hallmark. The other interesting aspect of the Grand Cordon set from the April 2018 La Galerie Numismatique auction is that the date hallmarks on the sash badge and breast star are slightly different. The sash badge is marked \"B\"=1927-28 and the breast star is marked \"C\"=1928-29. Although overlapping, it is unclear why a probably matched set might have languished in the Cairo assay office so that each component of this set received different date hallmarks. I have included some additional images of this set as the auction listing has a pretty good photo documentation (moderately good resolution, they can be zoomed) of the sash badge and breast star.\n\nThe Grand Cordon Order of Ismail cased set in the case marked J. Lattes from the April 2018 auction by La Galerie Numismatique and archived on the liveauctionees.com website (https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/60483636_order-of-ismail#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=1).\n\nThe same Grand Cordon set displayed on the sash (https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/60483636_order-of-ismail#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=3).\n\nThe sash badge of the same Grand Cordon set (https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/60483636_order-of-ismail#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=4). Note the placement of the hallmarks on the right side of the attachments of the superior star ray to the royal crown, consistent with those seen on the examples I illustrated on 11 January.\n\nReverse of the same sash badge (https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/60483636_order-of-ismail#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=5)\n\nClose-up of the reverse of the suspension loop of the same sash badge (cropped from https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/60483636_order-of-ismail#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=6) showing the presence of only the gold fineness hallmark (18 carat) and the date hallmark (\"B\"). This photo also shows the single 18 carat fineness mark on the reverse of the crown, as shown on the Lattes' examples of the Commanders' neck badges in my 11 January post and on the the Tewfik Bichay example of the Grand Cordon Class from Fall 2014 auction of Künker Münzauktionen und Goldhandelin in that same post.\n\nClose-up of the 3 hallmarks on the obverse right connecting link between the sash badge star and the crown suspension device on the same Grand Cordon sash badge (https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/60483636_order-of-ismail#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=6). They show the worn condition of the Cairo assay mark for 18 carat gold, a worn ibis, and the date hallmark \"B\" for 1927-1928. The placement is identical to those shown in my 11 January post.\n\nReverse of the central boss of the same sash badge showing the Latttes hallmark and the worn gold hallmarks: the Cairo assay mark of 18 carat gold, the ibis for Egyptian gold, and the date hallmark of \"B\" (https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/60483636_order-of-ismail#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=7).\n\nObverse of the breast star of this same set of the Grand Cordon Order of Ismail from the April 2018 auction by La Galerie Numismatique that is archived on the liveauctionees.com website (https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/60483636_order-of-ismail#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=8).\n\nReverse of one of the rays of the gold star of the breast star of the same Grand Cordon Order of Ismail showing the 3 hallmarks: the Cairo assay office mark for 18 carat gold, the ibis for Egyptian gold, and the date hallmark of \"C\"= 1928-1929. (https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/60483636_order-of-ismail#&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=9). As noted above, although the date hallmark overlaps with the \"B\" of the sash badge, it is interesting to see that (as long as these are part of the same Grand Cordon set) the hallmarking of this set occurred across the period that the date hallmark was being changed. I do not know which ray of the gold star is hallmarked on this example, as no image of a complete reverse view of this breast badge is provided in the auction listing. For the same reason, I cannot determine the location of the silver hallmarks on the rayed and facetted silver embellishment of this piece compared with examples I illustrated on 11 January.\n\nBelow is a high resolution image of the crown suspension device on a 3rd Class Commander's neck badge from an April 2017 auction by Bukowskis (https://www.bukowskis.com/en/lots/906427-the-order-of-ismail-nischan-al-ismail-22k-gold-lattes-in-kairo-1928-1928-weight-ca-47-g). In this photo only the Cairo assay office hallmark for 18 carat gold and the ibis mark for Egyptian gold are visible on the right connecting link between the superior star ray and the crown suspension device. I've included this image mainly because the lighting in this particular photo provides excellent detail on the royal crown suspension device, despite either some damage or manufacturing flaws seen in the lower right \"interior\" of the crown, in addition to normal wear.\n\nHigh resolution close-up image of the \"royal crown\" design of the suspension device from an April 2017 Bukowskis auction of a 3rd Class Commander's neck badge of the Order of Ismail made by Lattes. The auction description gives the dimensions of the badge as 8.5 cm high (including the suspension loop) x 6 cm wide, and a weight of 47 g, consistent with other data on measurements and roughly similar to other given weights. It incorrectly identifies this piece as 22 carat gold, and mistakenly gives a date for the \"D\" hallmark visible on a picture of the reverse of the neck badge as 1928 (\"1928-1928\", so likely just a clerical error). The \"D\" data hallmarks indicates a date of 1929-1930. From my research on the Egyptian Mixed Courts judicial badges, my understanding is that the \"princely crown\" was used in royal Egyptian iconography, principally on royal shields and coats of arms, from 1854 until ~1922, and the \"royal crown\" form was used form 1923-1952. Obviously, these date distinctions are not strictly adhered to on the designs of several Egyptian Orders and medals\n\nLeft=a form of the \"princely crown\", used from 1854-~1922; Right=design of the \"royal crown\" used from 1923-1952 (http://www.hubert-herald.nl/EgyptKingdom.htm). The royal crown form appears to be the basis for the design of the crown suspension device on the Order of Ismail.\n\nI noted on my 11 January, 2018 post under the 5th set of illustrations that there are some silver hallmarks showing 2 dots, rather than just 1, to the right of the Arabic \"9\" on some Egyptian silver indicating 900 silver rather than 90% as the fineness mark (both designations identifying the same silver content). Although I have only seen the \"90\" mark used as the silver fineness mark on the Order of Ismail, I found an illustration of the 900 silver mark that is illustrated below.\n\nHallmarks on an Egyptian silver scalloped and footed bowl, identified in the auction description as from c.1982 (correctly). The hallmarks are the Cairo assay office 900 silver mark, the lotus for post-1946 Egyptian silver manufacture (? see below), and the Arabic date letter for 1982. From a 2013 auction by Seized Assets Auctioneers, archived on the liveaucitoneers.com website (https://www.liveauctioneers.com/item/22604908_vintage-egyptian-silver-scalloped-footed-bowl-ciaro).\n\nAn additional wrinkle in dating the use of the silver hallmark of the cat or lotus is shown in an illustration below from a commemorative medal struck in October 1949 to mark the termination of the Egyptian Mixed Courts and the unification of the Egyptian court system. The termination date of the Mixed Courts was 14 October, 1949. This King Farouk medal was issued in bronze and in silver. The silver hallmarks I have seen on images of this medal all show the cat mark (tail raised), that several sources indicate was in use only until 1946.\n\nAn example of the silver King Farouk medal commemorating the end of the Mixed Courts system on 14 October 1949. The obverse of the medal is on the L and the reverse is on the R. From a May 2018 auction by Stephen Album Rare Coins (http://www.icollector.com/EGYPT-Farouk-1936-1952-AR-medal-32-27g-1949-EF_i29825948).\n\nReverse of the same King Farouk I commemorative medal. The design overlapping the Scales of justice and extending to the right side of the medal is based on an Egyptian stamp issued on 14 October, 1949 commemorating this same event (if interested, please see my posts of 3 May, 2018 and 17 October, 2018 on the thread \"Egypt Khedivate Judges Badge Question\" started on 17 November, 2016 here in the Middle East and Arab States section). The silver hallmarks in the lower left show: (L-R) the Cairo assay office mark for 900 silver (90%), the cat hallmark identifying Egyptian silver, and the date letter that is very difficult to read (see the image of a different medal below with a readable date hallmark). The S.T.B. medallist signature mark on the lower right are for Sadek Tewfik Bichay, brother of Fahmy Tewfik Bichay.\n\nA close-up of a different example of the silver King Farouk I medal with better detail of the date hallmark for this medal, indicating a hallmark date of 1948-1949. This comes from a September 2017 auction by Stephen Album Rare Coins, formerly (but no longer) archived on the coinarchives.com website (https://www.coinarchives.com/w/lotviewer.php?LotID=3018794&amp;AucID=3079&amp;Lot=1776&amp;Val=7022a8a05524ba0ccff62c071a37a509&amp;Match=1#match1).\n\nEdited February 23, 2019 by Rusty Greaves\n\n922F, I am always most grateful for your profound knowledge about these Egyptian Orders I am trying to learn more about, as well as your information about a wide range of issues touching on my research. I'm interested to see they Worth hallmark and the form of their silver fineness hallmarks as well. Thanks for providing this information and the image!\n\nI have found a photo of a named example of a 4th Class Order of Ismail Knight's breast badge with some odd variation in the form of the royal crown suspension device compared with all other examples I have seen on the Knight's insignia, and with the form of the same crown suspension on sash badges of the Grand Cordon (1st Class), the neck badge of the Grand Officer (2nd Class), and the Commander's neck badge (3rd Class). This example belongs to a set of 13 medals awarded to Colonel B.H.S. Romilly, of the Scots Guard and the Egyptian Army Camel Corps, from an auction in a December 1991 sale by Buckland Dix & Wood, Auctioneers and Valuers, from the Uphill-Brown Collection (lot 219). He was Winston Churchill's brother-in-law. Among the medals in this lot are a 3rd Class neck badge of the Egyptian Order of the Nile, a 4th Class breast badge of the Ottoman Order of Osmanieh, 2 Sudan Campaign medals, and this 4th Class Order of Ismail. (From: https://archive.org/details/auctionofordersd00buck_1/page/8)\n\nDetail of the crown suspension device from the April 2017 Bukowskis auction of a 3rd Class Commander's neck badge for comparison with the Buckland Dix & Wood example below (from: ttps://www.bukowskis.com/en/lots/906427-the-order-of-ismail-nischan-al-ismail-22k-gold-lattes-in-kairo-1928-1928-weight-ca-47-g)\n\nThis is unfortunately a low-resolution image of the Knight's breast badge from the Buckland Dix & Wood 1991 auction. No dimensions, manufacturer, or materials are identified for this badge. The ribbon on this example lacks its rosette, but the reason to include this illustration is the anomalous design on the royal crown suspension device. I have not seen an example like this on any other photos I have come across. Beginning at the inferior portion of the Buckland Dix & Wood crown: although it is not completely clear, the \"interior\" of the crown appears to lack the vertical relief lines normally present in this portion of the crown. The base of the crown above that has only 5 round red enamel ornamentations (quite uneven), not the blue (3) diamonds and red (4) ovals that normally alternate in this position, and it appears to lack the superior line on this band that forms the gold borders around the blue enamel diamond ornamentations. The line of gold bosses above this first band also is anomalous. The 4 red enamel triangles and central red diamond above the lowest band have 6 irregular green enamel ornaments superior to them in this BDW example. This entire panel of the crown contrasts markedly with the band of floral ornamentation relief surmounted by 5 blue & red stylized lotus blossoms with background red enamel creating contrast with the gold floral flourishes and the lotus blossoms, as seen in the uppermost comparison photos. The arches of the Buckland Dix & Wood crown are longer, than on all other examples, less curved, and have a greater number of gold bosses along some of the arches. Rather than exhibit a single boss on the central arch, the example above has at least 3. The \"bulb\" below the crescent and star also appears to be missing on the Buckland Dix & Wood Knight's badge. Overall, the crown shown above is much less well-executed with significant variation in the design elements and details of its ornamentation than any other genuine examples I have seen. The linkage between the superior central ray and the crown suspension device is quite different from other photos I have seen, however, there is some slight variation in the form of these linkages among some Knights' badges. The other elements of the badge appear within normal variation seen for the Knight's badge, but the quality of the photo makes it hard to determine whether the rayed & facetted silver embellishment may be less detailed than some of the Knights' badges I have illustrated on this thread (see the 2 illustrations on my post of 7 December, 2017;the 2 images on my post of 12 September, 2018; the 3rd photo of my 31 October 2018 post; the 4th photo of my 13 December, 2018 post; the 12th from last image of my post of 11 January, 2019; and the 1st image of my 21 February, 2019 post), or whether some of the gold work of the medallion margins may be less well-executed than the photos I've referenced here on this thread. The poorer workmanship and significant design differences in the crown suspension of this piece suggests a later addition or replacement with a less-skilled manufacture of the crown device.\n\nEdited February 26, 2019 by Rusty Greaves\n\nThanks 922F, I was unsure whether the Belgian Order of the Crown Teymour Pasha is wearing was a neck badge (3rd Class, Commander) or if there was a ribbon without rosette (5th Class, Knight) hiding under the Italian Order of the Crown. The position of the Belgian Crown would also make more sense if it was a neck badge rather than a chest badge. Thanks for your additional identifications of the other decorations as well.\n\nI thought that above individual might have a naval uniform, but with the complexity of dress military uniforms, palace protocols, and the different Bey grade distinctions, etc. I doubt I will become familiar with these uniform variations any time soon. I've attached an Image of King Farouk I in the costume I believe you mentioned. He is wearing the Collar of the Order of Muhammad Ali with the sash and chest star of that Order. It looks as though he is wearing the Order of Ismail breast star below that. The color version does not show the blue enamel of the star's arms, but the black & white image does make this look like the Order of Ismail. This image comes probably comes from a banquet reception King Farouk I had at Abdine Palace in 1939 for the Crown Prince Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran during his first meeting with his fiancée Princess Fawzia of Egypt. There are several other images of King Fuad in other versions of similar uniform, among them his January 1946 meeting with King Adulaziz Ibn Saud of Arabia (shown below).\n\nFrom: https://www.pinterest.com/pin/547680004682337198/\n\nFrom: https://petercrawford1947.wordpress.com/2011/02/03/royal-egypt/king_farouk2/\n\nOne of the most common official portraits of King Farouk I (c.1948) showing him with the Collar of the Order of Muhammad Ali, along with the sash and breast star for that Order, the breast Star of the Order of Ismail, and the breast star for the Order of the Nile, all in correct order of precedence. This photo is the basis of several painted portraits, including the one I included as the final photo in my post on this thread of 13 November, 2017. This is the basis of the most well-know painted portrait of Farouk I, shown in the background of the upper & middle right photos behind King Fuad II at his home in Switzerland in the montage by ROYAL WORLD THAILAND's commemoration of Fuad II's 66th birthday shown in my 22 April, 2018 post on this thread (those 2 photos appear reversed so that the sash and breast stars are not in the correct configuration, the middle left photo in that montage with King Fuad II wearing the Order of Mohammed Ali sash incorrectly from his left shoulder is not reversed, he apparently did wear it that way at HRH Prince Mohamed Ali's wedding).

Farouk is wearing the same uniform shown in the first 2 banquet photos here, the Collar and breast star of the Order of Muhammad Ali, with the Order of Ismail breast star partially visible under the breast star of the Muhammad Ali award. The individual 3rd form L is Abdul Rahman Azzam Pasha, serving as a Egyptian protocol officer in chamberlain's uniform. At the R is the illustrious Ahmed Hassanein Pasha who was Chief of the Diwan and Chamberlain to Farouk I. He wears his Chamberlain's uniform and a number of decorations I cannot distinguish in this image, but clearly is wearing the breast star of the Order of Ismail on his left chest (1st or 2nd Class, the star appears to be the same size as King Farouk I's, suggesting it may be the Grand Cordon rather than Grand Officer Class). He may be wearing a sash of the 1st Class Grand Cordon of the Order of the Nile. The intrepid adventurer, olympic fencing athlete, and politically important Hassanein (also shown in the 2 photos of my 14 September, 2018 post of on this thread wearing an even greater assortment of decorations) died just about 1 month after this photo was taken in a car accident, hit by a British truck skidding on a rainy bridge.

This example is made by Lattes of Cairo. The dimensions of this example are given as 83 mm high X 61 mm wide, and it weighs 49.0 g. The description identifies this piece as 750 gold, correctly as 14 k gold. These are not high resolution images, but they confirm the hallmark placements on the Lattes-made Order of Ismail as seen in other examples I have illustrated on this thread.\n\nObverse of this Commander Class Order of Ismail in its case.\n\nOblique view of the obverse of this 3rd Class Order of Ismail in its case.\n\nReverse of this 3rd Class Order of Ismail showing the full set of 3 hallmarks on the suspension clip to the ribbon, the single hallmark for Cairo manufacture of 18 k gold, and the full set of 3 hallmarks on the reverse boss of the central medallion. The resolution is low, but all appear to match the close-up image of the hallmarks on the suspension clip (shown below).\n\nDetail of the obverse of the crown suspension device, showing the placement of the 3 hallmarks on the right side of the suspension device arm connecting the superior ray of the star with the crown suspension device.\n\nClose-up detail of the reverse of the crown suspension and suspension clip showing the only good resolution image of the hallmarks on this example of a Commander Class of the Order off Ismail. The 3 hallmarks on the suspension clip indicate the Cairo assay office identification of 18 k gold, the ibis for Egyptian manufacture, and the letter \"A\" indicating manufacture in 1925-1926. The single hallmark on the reverse the crown device shows the Cairo assay office designation of 18 k gold.\n\nInside of the superior lid of the case associated with this Commander Class Order of Ismail showing the inscriptions.\n\nView of the exterior upper lid of the case for this Order of Ismail.\n\nLot 1028 from the same April 2019 auction by Very Important Lot also included the example below that is erroneously listed as a miniature of the Order of Ismail (https://veryimportantlot.com/en/lot/view/egypt-ismail-order-nischan-al-ismail-and-the-m-175086). This is the same design as an item from a December 2017 auction by Spink & Son, archived on the Salesroom website (https://www.the-saleroom.com/en-us/auction-catalogues/spink/catalogue-id-srspi10156/lot-bd1c4e4c-7dc1-4560-a3c7-a83200ba36e7) that I previously illustrated in the 2nd photo of my first post on 6 December, 2017 on this thread (also identified by Spink & Son as a miniature of the Order of Ismail). Owain identified this as the Order of the Star of Ethiopia in his post here of 6 December, 2017. See his comments in that post on the poor workmanship of this particular design (probably the same Spink & Son example).\n\nObverse of this Order of the Star of Ethiopia that is misidentified in the Lot 1028 description on the Very Important Lot website as a miniature of the Order of Ismail. The ribbon is that for the Order of Ismail, rather than the red, yellow, & green appropriate for this Ethiopian medal. There are several significant similarities in this example to the one I illustrated on 6 December 2017 indicating it is probably the same piece from the Spink & Son December, 2017 auction. That auction description by Spink & Son identified what may be this exact piece as 25 mm high including the crown suspension X 16 mm wide.\n\nReverse of this same Order of the Star of Ethiopia misidentified as a miniature Order of Ismail on the Very Important Lot auction site for Lot 1028. The description states that the silver purity mark on the reverse reads \"935\", however, it is probably \"925\", as identified in the Spink & Son auction description.\n\nEdited April 18, 2019 by Rusty Greaves\n\nI recently came across some interesting recycled use of design elements of the Order of Ismail in the Order of Saba'a (Nishan Wissam) of Yemen. I am not very familiar with this Order, so any comments by other learned members of GMIC would be greatly appreciated. The award appears to be part of a couple that were \"sponsored\" by Egypt during the first period of the Yemen Arab Republic (YAR) from ~1962-1967. Owain notes in a post of March 26, 2011 in \"ARAB MEDALS-Yemen\" (started February 7, 2007 by Antonio Preto in this section of Middle East & Arab States) that: \"I would surmise that following the overthrow of Sallal in 1967 [Abdullah al-Sallal, the first president of the YAR from September 1962-November 1967] the Egyptian sponsored awards of Saba, Marib and medals of Bravery and Liberation became obsolete and the ruling Republican Council instituted a new award of Marib to replace the previous series and thereby make a break with the Sallall (Nasser supported) regime.\" As can be seen in the illustrations below, this award combines a couple elements form past royal Egyptian Orders. The rayed backing embellishment appears to be from the Egyptian Order of the Nile. Hallmarks illustrated on these clearly indicate Egyptian manufacture, and the couple of examples I have seen with readable date hallmarks were manufactured within the first few years of the founding of the YAR. The central arms of the blue & gold star are those of the Order of Ismail design, lacking gold & enameled finals at the distal end of each arm of the star. The photographs show clearly that the gold floral designs within the arms are not in relief, something that is seen only on examples of the Order of Ismail made by Fahmy Tewfik Bichay, and possibly on some examples by his father Tewfik Bichay.\n\nObverse of the YAR period Order of Saba'a, Grand Cordon sash badge, sash (replacement sash, the Order Saba'a uses the same colors as the Order of Ismail sash or ribbon, but there is a single central red strip on the Order of Saba'a in contrast with the edge stripes on each margin for the Egyptian award), and breast star, from a current auction on The Treasures of the Orient website (https://www.theorienttreasures.com/shop-now/orders-medals-decorations/yemen-order-of-saba-a-grand-cross-set-sash-breast-star-badge-medal-nichan-wissam). Note the lack of any engraving on the gold floral designs on each of the arms of the central star. The suspension device on the sash badge is made from another piece of the same design as each of the arms of the blue & gold star. The rayed embellishment is identical to many seen on the royal award version of the Order of the Nile. The gold margin of the central boss is quite similar to the form of this feature on the Order of the Nile, lacking an inner band seen on both the sash badges (& the 2nd & 3rd Class neck badges) and breast stars of the Order of Ismail. The gold line where the crotch of each blue & gold arm of the star meet also is not an aspect of the design seen in the Order of Ismail. The sash badge of this example is identified as being 70 mm in diameter and the breast star is 90 mm in diameter. This set is identified as allegedly coming from the 1950s, however, it appears most likely that this award was only created after 1962 when the Egyptian-backed revolutionary YAR troops took over North Yemen and deposed Crown Prince Muhammad al-Badr (and consistent with the date hallmark, see the discussion of the photo of the reverse of this set below).\n\nReverse view of the same Grand Cordon set of the Order of Saba'a from the current The Treasures of the Orient auction showing the Egyptian hallmarks. The sash badge on the L exhibits Tewfik Bichay's hallmark, in addition to a silver hallmark at the far right on the central silver boss on the reverse (a purity hallmark, but I cannot read it), and a mark on the 10th ray (counterclockwise from the 12:00 position where the suspension device is attached) that is a purity hallmark identifying the Cairo assay office determination of 900 silver (90% pure). On the R, the breast star has 2 hallmarks on the tunic pin, that are a Cairo office assay mark of 900 silver and an Arabic letter date of 1962-1965. Just below and to the left of those hallmarks on the tunic pin, a hallmark on the central boss is a Cairo assay office mark for 900 silver. The 2 hallmarks on the 6th ray from the 12:00 position( again following counterclockwise) include the Cairo assay office identification of 900 silver and the Arabic date letter for1962-1965. Note the the suspension device (an arm element of the 5-pointed star) of the sash badge is gold, as in the construction the blue & gold star of the Order of Ismail. The reverse morphology of the silver embellishment looks identical to those seen on pre-egyptian Revolution versions of the Order of the Nile.\n\nObverse of a set of the sash badge and breast star of the Grand Cordon Class of the Order of Saba'a, showing the same design similarities to pre-revolutionary Egyptian awards in the arms of the blue & gold star (to the Order of Ismail) and the rayed backing embellishment (to the Order of the Nile). This example comes from a March 2019 auction (Auction XLIV, Lot 3461) by La Galerie Numismatic, archived onto Sixbid.com website (https://www.sixbid.com/en/la-galerie-numismatique/5835/yemen/4879721/order-of-saba-a?term&orderCol=lot_number&orderDirection=asc&priceFrom&displayMode=large&auctionSessions=). The sash badge is identified as 79 mm X 62 mm, and the breast star is 91 mm in diameter. The maker's hallmark shown in the lower left of the photo montage is that of Tewfik Bichay, oriented incorrectly, ~90 deg counterclockwise from the correct position. The illustration above of The Treasures of the Orient example also shows this same orientation of the maker's hallmark in relation to the orientation of the suspension device. All of the examples of the Order of Ismail with the Tewfik Bichay hallmark show a correct orientation, but I am unsure if this is generally true of the Order of the Nile awards. The 2 hallmarks shown on the far R in the lower right of the photo montage include (L-R): the Cairo assay office mark for 900 silver, and the Arabic date letter for 1962-1965.\n\nEdited July 13, 2019 by Rusty Greaves\n\nI hope someone loves the above Yemeni Order of Saba'a medals, but given my interest in the Order of Ismail, their design looks like scary chimera of Frankensteined leftovers from defunct Egyptian orders. I have an identification of an individual I have shown wearing an Order of Ismail that I am putting together for a future post, but I just want to add another few photos of the Nishan al-Ismail to chase away how these Order of Saba'a images look like disarticulated insects to me.\n\nBelow are some moderate-low resolution images of what is identified as a 3rd Class Commander's neck badge of the Order of Ismail. These come from a July 2019 auction on the eMedals website(https://www.emedals.com/egypt-kingdom-an-order-of-ismail-in-gold-i-class-commander-by-j-lattes-c-1924). The badge was made by Lattes of Cairo and lacks the neck ribbon. The auction description calls it a \"1st Class Commander\" version of this award. The suspension loop on this example does appear to be that seen on the 3rd Class Commander configuration (but also see the variant shown in Owain's example made by Fahmy Tewfik Bichay in his post of 5 April, 2018 on this thread that clearly shows a circular loop attached to the crown suspension device attached that encircles the ribbon). However, that same form of suspension loop also was used for the neck badge of the 2nd Class Grand Officer Class and may be the most common form on the 1st Class Grand Cordon sash badge as well. Most examples of the 1st Class Grand Cordon sash badge seems to be attached with the same suspension loop, but they may be attached to the decorative knot of the sash slightly differently on some, although good images of this configuration are not common on auction sites, probably as fewer Grand Cordon sets are available. The Grand Cordon Order of Ismail in the photo of my post of 6 December, 2017 on this thread (by Lattes) is ambiguous in what kind of gold suspension loop is used to attach the sash badge to a cloth loop in the decorative knot of the sash. The example shown in the 4th photo of my post of 13 November, 2017 that also was made by Lattes exhibits the same suspension loop attachment of the sash badge, and the 3rd photo shows in that post shows it attached to a cloth loop on the sash's decorative bow. The Grand Cordon sash badge shown in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th photos of my post of 22 February, 2019 on this thread (made by Lattes) are the identical suspension loop to that used for the 2nd and 3rd Classes. The Grand Cordon set made by Tewfik Bichay illustrated in my post of 30 April, 2018 shows the same style of suspension loop as can be seen in the many available auction images of the 2nd and 3rd class badges of this award. The 28th and 29th photos (the 4th and 3rd from final images) in my post of 11 January, 2019 show the sash badge suspension loops for a Grand Cordon Grand Cordon sash badge made by Tewfik Bichay that also has the same style of suspension loop as the Lattes examples of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Class badges. The only clear suggestion of a different style of suspension loop unfortunately comes from an example of the Grand Cordon sash that lacks the sash badge. The last illustration in this post shows a suspension device attached to the cloth loop of the decorative sash knot from a past eMedals auction. I obviously cannot determine whether the normal suspension loop attached to the crown suspension device would have attached to this apparently brass (indicated by the green corrosion?) clip attached to the cloth loop on the sash bow by a circular loop.\n\nThe auction description states that this badge measures 59.38 mm wide X 81.77 mm high (including the suspension device and loop). The weight is given as 40.1 g. Although the photo resolution is not good enough to see any of the hallmarks in any of the photos of this piece (or other details of interest) other than those visible on the close-up of the reverse of the central boss, the eMedals description states that it is \"...hallmarked on the reverse, suspension, suspension loop, crown reverse...\", indicting all the normal locations for hallmarks as shown in several of my previous posts on this thread. As discussed in my post of 13 December, 2018, the dimensions of the Grand Cordon sash badge, the Grand Officer neck badge, and the Commander neck badge all show overlapping size ranges. Unlike the breast star that is consistency larger for the 1st Class of this award (mostly 80 mm in diameter, with reported variance of 81 or 82 mm on a few examples) compared with that of the 2nd Class (70 mm in diameter), where size alone can distinguish which class a breast star represents, other elements are needed to securely identify the Grand Cordon sash badge and the Grand Officer neck badge from the Commander neck badge. The 40.1 g weight of this eMedals example is quite a bit less heavy than the range reported for other 1st Class sash badges, 2nd Class neck badges, or the 3rd Class neck badges that vary from ~47-49 g.\n\nObverse of the July 2019 eMedlas auction example identified as a 3rd Class Commander's neck badge.

The auction description correctly identifies all of these hallmarks.\n\nHigh-resolution image of the suspension clip attached by a circular loop to a cloth loop on a 1st Class Grand Cordon Order of Ismail sash from a past eMedals auction (https://www.emedals.com/order-of-ismail-1915-a-sash-w01278). The material the clip his made from is not identified in the auction description. This example of the sash did not have the sash badge nor a breast badge associated with it. No probable manufacturer for this sash is identified in the eMedals description. This is the only image I have found showing such an attachment clip. As noted in the text above, I still have several questions about the attachment configuration (and potential variation) that is represented for the sash badge of the Grand Cordon Class of this award compared with the attachment of the Grand Officer's or Commander's neck badges.\n\nEdited August 23, 2019 by Rusty Greaves\n\nI believe that I have found identifications for 2 individuals I have previously illustrated on this thread wearing the Order of Ismail. On 31 October, 2018 the first photo of my post shows an individual identified only as a Royal Guard wearing the 4th Class Knight Order of Ismail. In a post of 23 March, 2019 I was unable to identify the man in the 2nd photo showing another uniformed individual wearing the 3rd Class Commander's neck badge of the Order of Ismail. I am including those previous photographs below with my probable identifications, along with a couple of additional images showing both men at different ages, if these identifications are correct. Except for the first image, all of the other photos can be zoomed for greater details.\n\nThis above image (from: https://www.pinterest.com/pin/107945722297247055/) is one of these \"unidentified\" men that I posted on 23 March, 2019 without an information about who he was, nor the date of the photograph. This same photograph appears on several Arabic language websites with an apparent identification. This individual wearing a military uniform and a neck badge of the Commander Class (3rd) of the Order of Ismail (in addition to 6 other decorations) appears to be a well-known person. Most of the information I have been able to find is in awkward translations from Arabic websites, but I will try to outline what seems relatively secure bit of information about this person. I believe this is Abdullah Al-Nagoumi Pasha (\"Nagoumi\" is the preferred spelling among many appearing in English language texts), dressed in a uniform that 922F commented on 23 March, 2019 as likely being that of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudanese Condominium military services. I have been informed by an Egyptian friend whose grandfather served with Nagoumi Pasha in the Sudan that the uniform is actually similar to a Field Marshall uniform that the king wore, except that it has only 1 star on the sleeve instead of 3, as did the king's. He stated this is a uniform worn by high officials of the state to be worn on official state occasions (i.e., the opening of Parliament). My friend indicated this is the highest class of dress uniform, aside form the mess dress of evening wear. To the viewer's right of the Order of Ismail is an Order of the Nile (the 3rd Class, Commander's neck badge). 922F also identified the medals I am unfamiliar with in that same post as: \"Jordan Independence, and Iran Taj [Crown]. Two breast medals appear to be UK Sudan & Khedive's Sudan. Star too washed out for me - maybe Jordan Independence\". I also was told by the same Egyptian friend cited above that Nagoumi Pasha was certainly invested with the neck badge of the Order of the Crown of Iran (Nishan i-Taj-i-Iran) by Prince Reza Pahlavi, during his visit to Egypt to marry Princess Fawzia (see the 2nd photo, and the last image of the banquet in my post of 2 April, 2019 on this thread for an images of this event). Both of the first 2 websites cited below include the above photo and identify it as Abdullah Al-Nagoumi (there are probably addition Arabic language sites with this photo, but I am having trouble accessing them a second time to check through Google image search). A translation of the information on the website http://egyhistory.com/الحملة-العسكرية-على-السودان-1820م/ identifies him with the title “Major General”, however, it appears likely that he served in a brigade under Major General Muhammed Naguib, rather than holding this rank himself. The egyhistory.com website states that he served as the head of the Royal Guard until 1952, and then held a post as a board member on the first Fuad Institute for Desert Research. At least two additional Arabic language websites feature this same photo and contain apparently identical biographical texts with other details about Abdullah Al-Nagoumi Pasha: http://www.ahram.org.eg/News/51466/121/362829/تراث-و-حضارة/«عبد-الله-باشا-النجومى»-المثقف-الموسوعى.aspx. Both of these texts, and other sources, provide a range for his birth between 1880-1885 and identify his father as an Emir in the Madhi revolution, Abdul Rahman Al Nagoumi , who was killed in the Battle of Toshka on 3 August, 1889 (http://sudapedia.sd/en/content/399). Allegedly, young Abdullah was discovered asleep in the vicinity of the battlefield, taken by the army and handed over to Khadio Tawfiq. Abdullah was educated in the royal palaces and graduated from the military academy in 1918. He subsequently served with the brigade of Major General Muhammed Naguib. The translation available to me for this text is unclear about his subsequent career. However, it appears he may have had a role in relation to King Farouk I’s interest in hunting and a later association with animal conservation after the 1952 revolution. A couple of additional photos have turned up in my searches, both attached below, that may show what appears to be Abdullah Al-Nagoumi Pasha as an older man in a military uniform with King Farouk I. The facial features in these images of an older man to the viewer’s left of King Farouk I (shown below) are very similar to the earlier image above I previously posted. One other image from the news magazine Life also appears to show Abdullah Al-Nagoumi with other members of the Royal Guard in one of the Royal Palaces (Abdine Palace?)\n\nThe above undated images shows the individual to the viewer's left of King Farouk I that I believe may be an older Abdullah Al-Nagoumi Pasha than shown in the above photo I previously posted of him. However, I would be interested if other individuals have a different identification of this man in a military uniform. I do not know the date of this photo and the next one below. A dated photo of King Farouk I attending the 25th anniversary of King Fuad I University in 1950 shows him in a darker suit than this one, although his mustaches and the dark glasses are identical. It is possible this is a different event associated with that jubilee celebration, but I currently cannot date this image. King Farouk I is wearing the ceremonial academic robes associated with his role as President of King Fuad I University (originally named as Egyptian University from its founding in 1908 until 1940, renamed as King Fuad I University from 1940 until 1952, and then renamed as Cario University [Gām‘et El Qāhira] after 1952 to the present). I illustrated a commemorative medal celebrating the 25th jubilee anniversary of King Fuad I University (1925-1950) showing busts of both Fuad I and Farouk I on the obverse face in my post of 22 July, 2018 on the GMIC thread \"Egypt Khediveate Judge's Badge question\" that I started on 17 November, 2016 here in the Middle East & Arab States section. Several other photos of King Farouk I's attendance of this jubilee also show him in the same Presidential academic robe.

I do not know if the Arabic provides any additional information about the photo. (From: https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2d/72/e4/2d72e40ee2bbe5a708ee6febde96fb2d.jpg)\n\nPhotograph from the American magazine Life, showing an image of a younger Abdullah Al-Nagoumi Pasha at the far left on the couch, wearing the same dress uniform as in the first photo above. Nagoumi Pasha is not wearing his Order of Ismail (probably indicating this is prior to the award of the Order of Ismai), and appears younger than in the 1st photo above. He is wearing 4 of the same medals seen in the first image posted here: the 3rd Class Order of the Nile, the Order of the Crown of Iran (Nishan i-Taj-i-Iran), the Egyptian Khedive's Sudan medal, and what I believe is the the British Sudan Defense Force General Service medal (indicated by the ribbon configuration, exhibiting the wider central blue stripe than seen in some examples, bordered by yellow stripes and the outer black stripes are not visible in this and the above photo of Nagoumi Pasha). Hassan Kamel-Kelisi-Morali has identified the 3 men on the left in this image on Zeinab Mohamed's Flickr photostream as (L-R): HE Abdullah Al-Nagoumi Pasha, HE Omar Fati Pasha (and a contributor, Metro50, identified him as the King’s aide-de-camp); and Osman El Mahdi Pasha. The man on the far right is unidentified. Of additional interest in this photo, Osman el Mahdi is wearing on the viewer's left center of his uniform the 4th class Order of Ismail (with a ribbon bearing the rosette) and the 4th Class Order of the Nile (also showing the ribbon with its rosette). I cannot distinguish the other medals he is wearing. I believe that the photo I posted on 31 October, 2018 of an individual identified only as a Royal Guard may be a younger image of Osman El Mahdi Pasha. I do not yet know whether this photo was published in Life magazine, if it is part of photography taken by Life staff but not included in magazine publication, or used in some other Life publication. An article in the edition of Life from 10 April, 1944 of a unique set of photos from Abdine Palace (pp 85-93) shows various behind-the-scenes with service staff, but principally features the kitchen and dining room staff. 1944 is the most probable date for the above photograph. Several images of Abdine Palace with attributions to Life (as in the lower left of the above photo) appear to be associated with a date of 1933, but Najumi Pasha and El Mahdi Pasha only worked for King Farouk I, and were never in the service of King Fuad I. I cannot yet locate the publication or other reference for those 1933 images either . (From: Zeinab Mohamed's Flickr photostream: https://www.flickr.com/photos/96884693@N00/3086912058/)\n\nAbove is the image I posted on 31 October, 2018 in this thread showing an unidentified man in a photo offered on an eBay auction. This photo is from the Riad Shehata Studio in Cairo, the official photographer to King Fuad I and King Farouk I. I do not know the founding date of the studio, but it did continue under that name for an unspecified time after Riad Shehata's death in 1942. I currently feel that this may be an photo of a younger Osman El Mahdi, shown in a somewhat later photo in the Life magazine image above. Although his mustaches are smaller in this eBay photo, several aspects of his facial features (especially his chin) are extremely similar. The individuals in both photos are wearing identical uniforms (this is Royal Guard uniform design was created by King Fuad I when Egypt became a Kingdom in 1922), and this earlier image shows several medals that also appear in the Life photo, although the low resolution of that photo makes identification of the additional awards very difficult. The Life photo clearly shows the rosettes on the ribbons for the Order of Ismail and the Order of the Nile that are partially obscured in this photo. 922F identified a couple of the medals in this photo that I did not know in his post on this thread of 31 October, 2018. He identified the 3rd medal (to the viewer's right of the Order of the Nile) as either the Egyptian Medal for Meritorious Actions or the Medal of Devotion; we both identified the 4th as the Khedive's Sudan Medal; 922F id'd the 5th as the Iranian Order of Homayoun [Humayun]; the 6th as the Belgian Order of Leopold II; and we both identified the 7th as an Italian Crown.
