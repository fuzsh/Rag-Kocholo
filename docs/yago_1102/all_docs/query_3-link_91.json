        "text": "King Farouk 1 of Egypt only begins to be really interesting after he was overthrown by Gamal Abdel Nasser who staged a military coup in 1952 so lets take it from there, shall we.\n\nExile and death\n\nOn his exile from Egypt, Farouk settled first in Monaco, and later in Rome, Italy. On 29 April 1958, the United Arab Republic issued rulings revoking the Egyptian citizenship of Farouk. He was granted Monegasque citizenship in 1959 by his close friend Prince Rainier III.\n\nThe blue-eyed Farouk was thin early in his reign, but later gained enormous weight. His taste for fine cuisine made him dangerously obese, weighing nearly 300 pounds (136 kg)—an acquaintance described him as \"a stomach with a head\". He died in the Ile de France restaurant in Rome, Italy on 18 March 1965. He collapsed and died at his dinner table following a characteristically heavy meal. While some claim he was poisoned by Egyptian Intelligence, no official autopsy was conducted on his body. His will stated that his burial place should be in the Al Rifa’i Mosque in Cairo, but the request was denied by the Egyptian government under Gamal Abdel Nasser, and he was going to be buried in Italy. King Faisal of Saudi Arabia stated he would be willing to have King Farouk buried in Saudi Arabia, upon which President Nasser agreed for the former monarch to be buried in Egypt, not in the Mosque of Al Rifai’ but in the Ibrahim Pasha Burial Site.\n\nMarriages, affairs & dating\n\nIn addition to an affair with the British writer Barbara Skelton, among numerous others, Farouk was married twice, with a claim of a third marriage (see below). His first wife was Safinaz Zulficar (1921–1988), the daughter of Youssef Zulficar Pasha. Safinaz was renamed Farida upon her marriage. They were married in 1938, and divorced in 1948, producing three daughters.\n\nFarouk’s second wife was a commoner, Narriman Sadek (1934–2005). They were married in 1951, and divorced in 1954, having only one child, the future King Fuad II.\n\nWhile in exile in Italy, Farouk met Irma Capece Minutolo, an opera singer, who became his companion. In 2005, she claimed that she married the former King in 1957.\n\nBelinda Lee and Peggy Maley were also among the women Fat Freddy liked to spend time with, the lucky bastard.\n\nJet Magazine, October 29, 1953\n\nEgyptian King Farouk and an Italian Prince exchanged cold glances and hot words over the attention of Jamaica-born Tessa Prendergast in Rome, where the curvaceous dancer is working on a film. According to reports the two scions of ancient Mediterranean Royalty clashed when King Farouk attempted to persuade Miss Pendergast to leave the company of an Italian Prince who had been her constant escort in Italy. The Italian Prince called Farouk’s unwelcomed rivalry a personal affront an engaged in such heated verbal clash with him that it was necessary for police to intervene.\n\nH igh living and sticky fingers\n\nA likely apocryphal story about Farouk’s lavish living in exile was that he refused to donate money to relieve poverty on the basis that \"If I donate my fortune to buy food, all of Egypt eats today, eats tomorrow, and the day after that they are starving once again\", thus rationalizing his high living.\n\nWhen he started becoming old he began shoplifting things and artifacts when he used to go abroad, he even stole a ceremonial sword from the Shah of Iran and a priceless pocket watch from Winston Churchill. Because of his steeling habit he was called \"The Thief of Cairo\"."
