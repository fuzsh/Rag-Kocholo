        "text": "Rising Nakshatra\n\nMasculine Public-Figure Examples\n\nJyeṣṭha\n\nKita - Thrikketta\n\nBPL COMMENTARY\n\nFor Jyeṣṭha births of a masculine valence, the condition of conversational, discursive, explanatory, instructional, argumentative, commercializing, evangelical Kumara may considerably affect the outcome.\n\nFor those born into the Budha-ruled paradigm of Varta, siblings, cousins, schoolmates, bandmates, team-mates, castmates, classmates, entourage, ensemble, neighbors, managers, cohort, coterie, collaborative group, publishers, messengers, merchants, commercial agents, reporters, writers, scripts, plans, schedules, instructions, radio-television-internet, news-media, conferences, committees, discussions, travel itineraries, and texts may be especially influential.\n\nInstructional guidance is provided by emissaries from the civilizations of Antares. Their purpose is to communicate a forceful, dynamic, healing regeneration cycle via sexual energy transfer and discovery of secrets.\n\nPenetrating Communications\n\n[Busy Bantering Budha] -ruled Jyeṣṭha gentlemen are typically outspoken, incisive and decisive, competitive, descriptive, and energetic communicators. Thrikketta-born maintain a deep sense of mental seniority. Capable writers, Ketta men are quick-witted and skilled in handcraft. Articulate and pro-active to the point of verbal aggression, they find a ready audience on topics of a mysterious, apocryphal, hidden, or forbidden nature.\n\nThriketta fellows may be handlers of secrets of a sexual, psychological, political, military, engineering, or financial nature.\n\nMasters of verbal control and manipulation, Zakra chaps are often found in politics. Due to the influence of nakshatra-pati Budha, often Jyeṣṭha -born use words to manage an ever-transforming experience of power.\n\nIn the process of channeling these mysterious and compelling kinetic energies, thriketta men may engage in sexual intrigue and dangerous liaisons. Ketta-born are natural psychologists. Jyestha can become transformative healers when their sexual energy consciousness evolves.\n\nThemes of verbal contest, sexual energy transfer, and healing discovery may contextualize Jyeṣṭha 's terrestrial experience.

Although his Koranic style was extremely formal [Shani] and not suited for conversation [3] it was praised as beautiful and seemly for a divinely inspired figure [super-powered [uchcha] Guru-9] .\n\nHowever, the keepers of the power in Egypt [Shani-10] felt threatened by any effort to close the massive wealth gap which kept most Egyptians in a state of crushing poverty and ignorance. The radio addresses were stopped [Shani].\n\nSadly, as with most parts of his engagement with governance, the radio programming [3] ceased [Shani]. FA's leadership capacity waned, due mainly to the oppressive role of the monied aristocracy.
