        "text": "Queen\n\nKnown as the \"Cinderella of the Nile\" for her middle-class background, Narriman was selected [by whom?] in part as a populist gesture to prop up public opinion of the monarchy. She broke off her previous engagement to a Harvard doctoral student named Zaki Hashem and was sent to Egypt's embassy in Rome to learn how to perform her royal duties. While in Rome she assumed the identity of the ambassador's niece in order to hide the purpose of her presence. At the embassy she studied history, etiquette, and four European languages. Countess Layla Martly, one of the most cultured and experienced ladies in Europe, accompanied Narriman to teach her history, the general behavior, and etiquette of the Royal cortege. Narriman lived in Rome at the Egyptian embassy in villa Savoy, which was the previous house of the Italian Royal family that was living at that time in Alexandria. Also, as a consequence of the king's order that she return to Egypt weighing at most 50 kilograms (110 lb), she was put on a strict weight-loss program. In May 1951, at the age of 17, she married Farouk, thus becoming Egypt's queen. The couple's wedding was lavish and extravagant. Narriman wore a bridal gown embroidered with 20,000 diamonds, and the two received many expensive presents. Those presents that were made of gold were subsequently secretly melted down into ingots.[1]"
