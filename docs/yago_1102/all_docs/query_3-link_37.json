        "text": "Married. King Farouk of Egypt, 31; and Narriman Sadek, 17, commoner daughter of one of the groom’s civil servants; he for the second time, she for the first; in a suburb of Cairo (see FOREIGN NEWS).\n\nMarried. Patricia (“Honeychile”) Wilder Cernadas, 32, Georgia-born playgirl of the International Set, who claimed she once almost shot Egypt’s King Farouk, “thinkin’ he was a duck”; and Prince Alexander Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsfurst, 33, who fled Poland just before the German invasion in 1939; she for the third time, he for the second; in Greenwich, Conn.\n\nDied. Prince Mansour Ibn Abdul Aziz, 29, Defense Minister of Saudi Arabia, a favorite son of King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud; of uremia; in Neuilly, France. In 1945, with his father, he was entertained by Franklin Roosevelt aboard the U.S.S. Quincy in the Red Sea, was long considered the likely successor to Saudi Arabia’s throne.\n\nDied. Dr. Takashi Nagai, 43, X-ray scientist, objective chronicler of A-bomb effects on himself and his townsmen; of chronic leukemia; in the one-room cabin he called “Love-Thy-Neighbor-as-Thyself-House” in Nagasaki, Japan. For years a hopeless invalid, given the last rites (he was a Roman Catholic) in 1948, he nonetheless kept on writing impassioned pleas for a peaceful, A-bombless world, moving descriptions of his devastated city’s “society of spiritual bankrupts” (We of Nagasaki). Soon to be published: his final bequest to the world, Atomic Battleground Psychology.\n\nDied. Osman Bator, 53, anti-Communist Kazakh guerrilla leader, who once declared himself “at war with the Soviet Union,” was reported captured in February and accused of being an “armed agent of American imperialism”; by unspecified means of execution; in Urumchi, Sinkiang, China."
