        "text": "On 11 February 1920, His Sultanic Higness Farouk bin Fuad, the Hereditary\n\nPrince of Egypt and Sudan was born at the Abdeen Palace in Cairo, Egypt.\n\nFamily\n\nHis parents were King Fouad I of Egypt and Nazli Sabri. He was a member\n\nof the Muhammad Ali Dynasty. King Fouad I gave all of his children names\n\nstarting with F after an Indian fortune-teller told him names starting with F\n\nwould bring him good luck.\n\nEarly years\n\nFarouk was only allowed to see his mother once every day for one hour. He\n\ngrew up in the very closeted world of the royal palaces and he never visited\n\nthe Great Pyramids of Giza until he became a King.\n\nFarouk however had a very spoiled upbringing with the servants when meeting\n\nhim always getting down on their knees to first kiss the ground and then his\n\nhand.\n\nAside from his sisters, Farouk had no friends when growing up as Fuad would\n\nnot allow any outsiders to meet him.\n\nEngland\n\nIn October 1935, Farouk left Egypt to settle at Kenry House in the countryside\n\nof Surry to attend the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich as an\n\nextramural student. Farouk stayed at Kenry House and twice a week was driven\n\nin a Rolls-Royce to the Royal Military Academy to attend classes, but he still\n\nfailed the entrance exam. Instead of studying Farouk spent his time in London\n\nwhere he went shopping, attended football matches with the Prince of Wales\n\nand visited restaurants and brothels.\n\nOn 28 April 1936, King Fouad died of a heart attack and Farouk left England\n\nto return to Egypt as a King, but before leaving he visited Buckingham Palace\n\nto accept the condolences of King Edward VIII.\n\nKing of Egypt\n\nUpon his coronation the 16-year-old-King Farouk made a public radio\n\naddress to the nation:\n\n\"And if it is God's will to lay on my shoulders at such an early age the\n\nresponsibility of kingship, I on my part appreciate the duties that will be\n\nmine, and I am prepared for all sacrifices in the cause of my duty. My\n\nnoble people, I am proud of you and your loyalty and I am confident in\n\nthe future as I am in God. Let us work together. We shall succeed and be\n\nhappy. Long live the Motherland.\n\nAt that time Farouk was extremely popular by the Egyptian people, so it\n\nwas decided by the Prime Minister that Farouk should not return to Britain.\n\nHowever Farouk's cousin Prince Mohammad Ali was next in line to the\n\nthrone and he tried to depose Farouk so he could become king.\n\nPolitics (1)\n\nThe Wafd party, led by Nahas Pasha, had been the most popular party\n\nin Egypt since it had been founded in 1919. The Wafd leaders felt\n\nthreatened by Farouk's popularity with ordinary Egyptians.\n\nCoronation\n\nOn 20 July 1937, the coronation of Farouk took place. He outdid the\n\ncoronation of King Georg VI of the United Kingdom which just had\n\ntaken place in London.\n\nLove and Marriage (1)\n\nOn 20 January 1938 he married to Farida, born Safinaz Zulficar, the\n\ndaughter of a judge from Alexandria. This decision - to marry a\n\ncommoner instead of a member of the aristocracy increased his\n\npopularity.\n\nFarouk broke with Muslim tradition by taking Queen Farida\n\neverywhere with him and letting her go unveiled.\n\nRelations with Germany & World War II\n\nIn April 1939, the German Propaganda minister, Dr. Josef Goebbels\n\nvisited Cairo and received a warm welcome from the King. At the\n\nbeginning of World War II, Egypt tried to be neutral, but Farouk broke\n\ndiplomatic relations with Germany.\n\nOn 10 June 1940, Italy declared war on Britain and invaded Egypt.\n\nUnder a treaty dated from 1936, Egypt was forced to assist the\n\nBritish with logical services.\n\nOn 9 December 1940, the British launched an offensive that drove the\n\nItalians back into Libya.\n\nIn January 1941, German forces were dispatched to the Mediterranean\n\nto assist the Italians.\n\nOn 12 February 1941, the Afrika korps under the command of Erwin\n\nRommel arrived in Libya.\n\nOn 31 March 1941, the Wehrmacht drove the British out of Libya into\n\nEgypt.\n\nFarouk met various allied leaders such as the South African Prime\n\nMinister Jan Christian Smuts and Winston Churchill in August 1942.\n\nOn 13 February 1945, Farouk met President D. Roosevelt of\n\nThe United States.\n\nEgypt ended the Second World War as the richest country in the\n\nMiddle East, owing largely to the high prices of cotton. Egypt was\n\na creditor nation to the United Kingdom.\n\nAsylum to the King of Italy\n\nIn May 1946, King Farouk granted asylum to former King of Italy,\n\nVictor Emmanuel III who had abdicated on 9 May 1946. Farouk was\n\nrepaying a family debt as Victor Emmanuel's father, King Umberto I\n\nhad granted asylum to Farouk's grandfather Ismail the Magnificent.\n\nHowever Victor Emmanuel had supported the Fascist regime, his\n\narrival in Egypt did much damage to Farouk's image.\n\nStrained relations with Great Britain\n\nIn 1946, Farouk continued to press the British to leave Egypt altogether\n\nbut the question of who would control the Sudan led to the collapse of\n\nthe talks in December 1946. Farouk considered the Sudan to be a part\n\nof Egypt.\n\nPolitics (2)\n\nIn June 1946, Farouk granted asylum to Amin al-Husseini, the Grand\n\nMufti of Jerusalem, who escaped from France. al-Husseini made an\n\nalliance with Hassan al-Banna, the Supreme Guide of the Muslim\n\nBrotherhood, which was rapidly becoming the most powerful mass\n\nmovement in Egypt.\n\nA divorce\n\nOn 19 November 1948, after the birth of a third daughter, King\n\nFarouk divorced his Queen. He cared for his first two oldest\n\ndaughters, while she took care for her youngest child.\n\nA lavish Bachelor party\n\nAfter his divorce and the wars, the popularity of King Farouk\n\ndeclined.\n\nHis advisors told that he should marry again. Egyptian people\n\nloved royal weddings and marrying a commoner again would\n\nshow his populist side.\n\nNarriman Sadek was selected to become the new bride of the\n\nKing. After Farouk announced his engagement to Sadek he\n\nsent her off to Rome to be taught how to be a proper cultured\n\nlady to make her fit to be a queen.\n\nIn August 1950, Farouk visited France to stay at the casino of\n\nDeaville for his bachelor party. Upon the King arriving in\n\nEurope a media circus began as hundreds of journalists reports\n\nFarouks every doing.\n\nAs Farouk spent extravagant sums of money during his visit\n\nto Deauville staying at the casino every night until 5am, he\n\nearned himself a reputation for flamboyant high living.\n\nFrom Deauville Farouk went to Biarritz, where he stayed at\n\nthe Hotel du Palais and he resumed his friendship with the\n\nDuke of Windsor (the former King Edward VIII).\n\nFarouk then crossed to San Sebastian in Spain to attend a\n\nfilm Festival with four of his ladies of the moment.\n\nFarouk's next stop was Cannes, where he went to the Palm\n\nBeach Casino.\n\nUpon his return, Farouk received an anonymous public letter\n\nfrom the opposition which warned a revolt was near.\n\nPolitics (3)\n\nPrime Minister Nahas announced on the opening of the Parliament\n\non 6 November 1950 that the government's chief priority for this\n\nterm would be seeking the removal of all British forces from Egypt\n\nand the end of the Anglo-Egyptian condominium of the Sudan,\n\nasserting the Sudan was rightfully part of Egypt.\n\nLove and Marriage (2)\n\nOn 6 May 1951, King Farouk married to Narriman Sadek in a\n\nlavish style. After his wedding the King went on a three-month\n\nhoneymoon in Europe, where he and his new queen spent vast\n\namounts of money.\n\nPolitics (4)\n\nOn 17 October 1951, the Egyptian government got Parliament approval\n\nto cancel the 1936 Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. As the result the British forces\n\nin the Suez Canal were considered enemy forces and King Farouk was\n\ndeclared King of Egypt and Sudan. This title was not recognised by many\n\ncountries.\n\nA son\n\nOn 16 January 1952, Queen Narriman gave birth to Crown Prince Fouad.\n\nFinally Farouk had a son. The King and the Queen divorced in 1954.\n\nRevolution\n\nOn the night of 23 July 1952, the Free Officers led by Muhammad Naguib\n\nand Gamal Abdel Nasser started a military coup that launched the\n\nEgyptian Revolution of 1952. Cairo was under their control.\n\nOn 26 July 1952, at about 12:30 pm, Farouk cried as he signed his\n\nabdication. He boarded the royal yacht to leave Egypt for the last time.\n\nExile\n\nFarouk went into exile in Monaco and Italy, where he lived for the\n\nrest of his life. Farouk's baby son Fouad was proclaimed King Fouad II.\n\nOn 18 June 1953, the revolutionary government formally abolished the\n\nmonarchy. This ended the 150 years of the Muhammad Ali dynasty's rule.\n\nEgypt was declared a republic.\n\nDeath\n\nIn 1959, King Farouk was granted Monegasque citizenship by his close\n\nfriends Prince Rainier III. In his last years Farouk continued to visit\n\nnightclubs to gamble and socialise. He spent his days in Rome, drinking\n\ncoffee, smoking cigars and talking to anybody who approached him.\n\nKing Farouk collapsed at the ile de France restaurant in Rome. He was\n\nbrought to the San Camilo Hospital and he died immediately thereafter on\n\n18 March 1965.\n\nHis image\n\nKing Farouk was known for his lavish lifestyle. When he became a King,\n\nhe already had thousands of acres of lands, dozens of palaces and\n\nhundreds of car. Nevertheless the young King often travelled to Europe\n\nfor big shopping sprees.\n\nHis personal vehicle was a red 1947 Bentley Mark VI. In 1951 he\n\nbought the pear shaped 94 carat Star of the East Diamond and a fancy-\n\ncoloured oval-cut diamond from jeweller Harry Winston.\n\nIn 1950 Farouk's fortune was estimated to be about 50 million pounds\n\nsterling, this made him then one of the richest men of the world.\n\nHe had many affairs and he was seen frequently womanizing at the\n\nhottest night spots in Cairo and Alexandria. He also had many affairs.\n\nFarouk's daughter, Princess Ferial recalled that in exile, Farouk was\n\na loving father whose only rules for her as a teenager were that she\n\nnever wear a dress that exposed any décolletage or dance to\n\nrock 'n roll music which he hated.\n\nSource pictures: Wikipedia"
