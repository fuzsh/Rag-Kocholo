        "text": "Narriman Sadek, who has died in Cairo aged 70, was the former wife of the late King Farouk of Egypt, and the mother of the heir to a now abolished throne.\n\nFarouk's second wife, she was chosen from the ranks of Egypt's non-royal upper middle class to restore popular support for a monarchy on its last legs. Newspapers dubbed her the \"Cinderella of the Nile\", a commoner plucked from obscurity for a life of extravagant luxury in the royal palaces of Cairo and Alexandria, reluctantly accompanying her playboy husband in the casinos and grand hotels of Europe. She stood it for just more than a year, having produced the desired male heir, and then bolted, divorcing the king at the age of 19.\n\nNarriman Sadek was the only child of a comfortably off Cairo family. Her father was a high-ranking government official; her mother had keen social ambitions for her daughter.\n\nAt 16 she became engaged to a young man who worked for the United Nations secretariat and had studied at Harvard; but her plans changed after the couple visited a Cairo jeweller to shop for an engagement ring.\n\nFarouk's wily information minister had let it be known the king was on the lookout for a new bride to replace his first wife, Queen Farida, who had produced three daughters but no son, and whom he had recently divorced. The jeweller informed the palace that he had just met the ideal candidate in his shop: she was young and good-looking, just the kind of girl the king was known to like. Farouk's courtiers contrived for the girl to return to the shop - ostensibly to look at a special ring, at a very good price - so that the king could have a look at her.\n\nRather than observing her through a peephole in the door, as had been arranged, the king unexpectedly met her face to face. After a brief exploratory interview, he announced to her that he intended to marry her.\n\nHer parents were persuaded to cancel the original marriage plans, which were at an advanced stage. Narriman's humiliated fiance returned to Harvard to complete his doctorate.\n\nShe wrote of this meeting in the jewellery shop: \"I could not help thinking of Zaki Hachem [her original fiance] who, compared with the king, seemed like a little absent-minded insignificant schoolteacher.\"\n\nAt first the engagement was kept secret. Narriman was sent to Rome to learn the duties of queen. She lived at the Egyptian embassy, where she was given a new identity as a \"niece\" of the Egyptian ambassador. Tutors and ladies-in-waiting taught her history, etiquette, music and four European languages. Her weight was carefully monitored and controlled, to conform to Farouk's order that she return to Egypt weighing no more than 50 kilograms.\n\nA flamboyant wedding was held. Narriman wore a white satin gown decorated with 20,000 diamonds, and was driven to the ceremony in a convoy of Rolls-Royces and Cadillacs through heart-shaped triumphal arches of pink neon emblazoned with the initials \"F\" and \"N\". All the wedding presents that were in gold were later secretly melted into ingots.\n\nThen came a four-month honeymoon in Europe that, in its excesses, eradicated whatever goodwill had been achieved by the marriage to a commoner. For their departure on the royal yacht, Farouk dressed the entire honeymoon party of 60 in identical blue blazers, white ducks and yachting caps. He showered Narriman with expensive presents, and by night lost vast sums at the baccarat table.\n\nNarriman began a life of boredom and luxury. She gave birth to a son, Ahmed Fuad, in January 1952. Ten days later, there was an outbreak of rioting and destruction in the Egyptian capital. The mob chanted: \"Narriman, Narriman, why does your baby have teeth?\"\n\nThe king, whose philandering continued unabated after his marriage, grew even more distant from the young queen as the threat to his crown intensified.\n\nHe was forced to abdicate that summer, after an ultimatum by the committee of military officers that later seized power. The royal family left Egypt on the royal yacht for Capri, and began a life of nomadic exile in Europe.\n\nNarriman quickly tired of accompanying her husband on his nightly round of nightclubs and casinos, and in March 1953, accompanied by her mother, she returned to Egypt, where the new government gave her a new passport in her maiden name."
