        "text": "Binghamton University Style Guide\n\nUniversity publications perform most effectively when they reflect consistency and clarity in their messages. Since many of our audiences overlap, it's important that nonacademic publications coming from the University treat the English language in the same manner, using a clear, consistent, contemporary style of writing.\n\nThis style guide is based in part on the Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law, The Chicago Manual of Style and Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary.\n\nUniversity writers who would like to suggest an addition, deletion or change should email Natalie Blando-George in Communications and Marketing at ngeorge@binghamton.edu.\n\nIF YOU DON'T FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR HERE, review the University's preferred word list for information pertaining to specific word usage.\n\nStyle Guide\n\nA | B | C | D | E/F/G | H/I | J/K/L | M | N | O/P | Q/R | S | T | U/V/W | X/Y/Z\n\nA\n\na.m. / p.m. / time\n\nNote use of lowercase and periods.\n\nUse noon instead of 12 p.m.; use midnight instead of 12 a.m.\n\nThe correct abbreviation for morning times is a.m.\n\nThe correct abbreviation for afternoon and evening times is p.m.\n\nUse a colon to separate hours from minutes [3:45 p.m., 11:15 a.m.]\n\nDon't use zeros for even hours [7 a.m. not 7:00 a.m.]\n\nThe order when combining time with date and place is: time, date, place. [6 p.m. Friday, June 8, at the Mandela Room]\n\nabbreviations and acronyms\n\nDon't use abbreviations or acronyms the reader won't quickly recognize. Avoid overuse of abbreviations and acronyms.\n\nDon't use periods in University abbreviations and acronyms. [SOM, CCPA, ITC]\n\nDon't use periods with ID, TV, TA (teaching assistant), RA (resident assistant) and RD (resident director). [ID cards, there is a TV in the lounge, see your RA for details]\n\nUnless the abbreviation is part of a proper name that doesn't use periods, use periods for two-letter acronyms. [U.N., B.C. Open]\n\nDon't use periods for large acronyms. [USPS, NASA, FEMA]\n\nNOTE: Some entities are widely known by their initials and may not need to be spelled out on first reference (i.e., FBI, CIA, NSA); let context guide you.\n\nAcademic A Building (AA); Academic B Building (AB)\n\nAcademic Complex is the correct term to use when referring collectively to AA and AB.\n\nacademic and administrative titles\n\nCapitalize the principal words in a title that appears before an individual's name, but don't capitalize a title elsewhere (including when the title follows the person's name). [Provost Donald G. Nieman, but Donald G. Nieman, provost]\n\nDon't capitalize titles when used without a name. [the vice president is calling for nominations]\n\nDon't use Dr. for those with PhDs. Use their academic title instead. [Professor John Doe, not Dr. John Doe.]\n\nacademic degrees\n\nWith the exception of the alumni section of campus publications, spell out names of degrees. [Alexis Greenman, who received her bachelor's degree in computer science]\n\nUse an apostrophe in bachelor's degree and master's degree, but there is no possessive in associate degree, nor is there a possessive when using Bachelor of Arts, Master of Science, etc.\n\nNames of degrees are lowercased when referring to them generically [master's degree in chemistry, bachelor's degree in art history] and capitalized when referring to a specific, formal degree/degree program. [Bachelor of Arts in English, Master of Science in Nursing, Master of Business Administration degree program]\n\nUse abbreviations such as MA, MS, PhD only when spelling out the names of the degrees would be cumbersome. When used after a name, set off these abbreviations with commas and do not use periods within the degree abbreviation itself. [Emily Michaels, PhD, is coordinating the reunion; Philip Chen, MS ’17, is receiving an award; Andrew Dawson, MA ’20, chairs the committee]\n\nFor baccalaureate graduates, list only the graduation year, not the degree earned. Note the absence of a comma after the name. [Jose Rodriguez ’15 is our guest speaker or Keisha Taylor ’16 went on to graduate school]\n\nTreat graduate certificates as you would graduate degrees [Janice Hopper, FNP certificate '15, PhD '17]; if an individual earns both a certificate and a degree in the same year, list the graduate degree only, not both.\n\nSee graduation years and honorary degrees for additional information\n\nacademic departments\n\nCapitalize official department names in running text. References using shortened or unofficial names should be lowercase. For example:\n\nThe Department of Human Development publishes an annual newsletter.\n\nMany students pursue master's of science degrees through our Department of Accounting at the School of Management.\n\nGraduate students from bioengineering traveled to China.\n\nFaculty members from the cinema and history departments are cooperating on this project.\n\nacademic honors\n\nUse cum laude, magna cum laude and summa cum laude. These should not be italicized.\n\nacademic majors and minors\n\nLowercase all majors and minors, except those incorporating proper nouns. [She has a major in Hebrew studies and a minor in philosophy.]\n\naccelerated/fast-track/4+1 programs\n\nUse 4+1 to describe all accelerated programs.\n\nYou may use fast-track only when writing about program code 31945, Fast-Track Professional MBA (NYC). This is the University's only official fast-track program.\n\nYou may use accelerated only when writing about the programs listed below, which are the only officially designated \"accelerated\" programs.\n\n29703 ECONOMICS BS-MA\n\n38914 NURSING BS\n\n31292 NURSING BS, Adult-Gerontological Nurse Practitioner MS\n\n31289 NURSING BS, Community Health Nursing MS\n\n31291 NURSING BS, Family Nursing MS\n\n31290 NURSING BS, Community Health Nurse Practitioner MS\n\nacting/interim\n\nWhen someone is filling in for an administrator who is temporarily on leave, the correct title is acting.\n\nWhen someone is filling in while a permanent replacement is being sought, the correct title is interim.\n\nadmission/admissions\n\nUse the plural form in the titles of our University offices (Undergraduate Admissions and Graduate Admissions), as well as when referring to our admissions process.\n\nUse the singular form in constructs such as: he applied for admission to the University or she filed an application for admission.\n\nAdmissions Center (AM)\n\nalumni/ae/us/a\n\nAlumni is considered to be gender-neutral when referring to more than one person.\n\nAvoid alumna/us and alumni/ae.\n\nUse alum sparingly and only in informal communications.\n\nampersand/&\n\nDon't use an ampersand (&) to replace and except in proper names of off-campus entities that include an ampersand.\n\nAnderson Center for the Performing Arts (Anderson Center)\n\nComposed of the Osterhout Concert Theater, the Chamber Hall and Watters Theater\n\napostrophes\n\nUse an apostrophe when referring to a class year; make sure the apostrophe is facing in the correct direction (it shouldn't look like a backward apostrophe).\n\n[Class of ’23]\n\nUse curly apostrophes (“), not straight up-and-down ones (', called primes) whenever possible.\n\nDon't use an apostrophe to make the plural of figures and letters unless confusion would result without the apostrophe. [three PhDs, five DVDs, there are two 5s in that number, but there are four s's in that word]\n\nassociate/assistant\n\nDon't abbreviate assistant or associate when used in a title.\n\nat/@\n\nUse @ as a substitute for at in text only in athletics schedules to denote away games.\n\nathletics\n\nUse athletics when referring to this University division.\n\nB\n\nB-ALERT\n\nThe University's emergency alert messaging system; formerly called RAVE Alert.\n\nBearcats\n\nBinghamton University's athletics teams (regardless of gender) are called the Bearcats (plural).\n\nBaxter the Bearcat is Binghamton University's mascot.\n\nBingflex\n\nBingflex courses combine in-person instruction with real-time (synchronous) video-conferencing.\n\nNote that the f isn't capitalized.\n\nBinghamton University's name\n\nBinghamton University\n\nUse this in all written communications, particularly those intended for an off-campus audience and materials written for prospective students.\n\nBinghamton\n\nThis is acceptable as a secondary reference, but it must be clear that Binghamton refers to the University, not the city.\n\nBU\n\nAvoid this abbreviation in all communications.\n\nState University of New York at Binghamton\n\nThis remains the official and legal name of the University and is used on all legal documents, but not on the cover or in the text of most publications. Our state affiliation should be included when identifying University offices, academic units, people or places for external audiences.\n\nSUNY\n\nThis abbreviation for State University of New York should be spelled out for external publications on first reference, but is acceptable on second reference. Don't use periods or spaces.\n\nSUNY-B/SUNY-Binghamton\n\nThese abbreviations are no longer used.\n\nUniversity\n\nThis is acceptable as a secondary reference to Binghamton University. Note the capital U.\n\nBinghamton University website address\n\nThe University's main website address, www.binghamton.edu, should appear on all publications; most often, it is presented as binghamton.edu (without the www).\n\nOnly use http:// (or https://) if the URL won't work without it.\n\nBiotechnology Building (BI)\n\nThis building is part of the Innovative Technologies Complex (ITC) on Murray Hill Road, across from the Vestal campus.\n\nBlack\n\nCapitalize Black when referring to people in a racial, ethnic or cultural context.\n\nLowercase black refers only to the color, not to people.\n\nAfrican American is acceptable for an American Black person of African descent.\n\nDon't capitalize person of color or students of color.\n\nBrain, the\n\nThe Brain refers to the main road that surrounds the inner Vestal campus, which seen from above resembles a human brain.\n\nOnly use in communications intended for an internal audience.\n\nOne loop around the Brain is 1.3 miles.\n\nBU BRAIN (note capitals)\n\nbulleted lists\n\nLists should present items in a consistent manner throughout a publication.\n\nMaintain consistency for all items in a list. For example, don't mix sentence and nonsentence items, begin all items the same way (e.g., with a verb or gerund), use or don't use end punctuation, etc.\n\nC\n\ncampus buildings\n\nCampus/school building names and their abbreviations should match the listings on the Buildings page of the University Directory.\n\nTo specify locations, give the building abbreviation and room number with a hyphen in between.

For example, don't indicate that an event is being held at the ITC (there is one exception, see next bullet); indicate the specific building within the complex. This is particularly important when giving room numbers because more than one building has a Room 1201, for example.\n\nSince the Rotunda, where many events are held, is not part of a specific building at the ITC, it is accurate to refer to the \"Rotunda at the Innovative Technologies Complex.\" [registration for the lecture will begin at 7 a.m. Saturday in the Rotunda at the Innovative Technologies Complext on Murray Hill Road in Vestal]\n\nInnovative Technologies Complex Start-Up Suite\n\nNote use of hyphen in start-up.

[thirty-one, sixty-eight]\n\nUse a comma for most numbers higher than 999, except with street addresses, ZIP codes, broadcast frequencies, SAT scores, room numbers, serial numbers, telephone numbers and years.\n\nAlways use numerals with the percent symbol (%).\n\nAlways spell out the word million.\n\nIf a sentence includes multiple numbers that apply to the same category of thing, and if one of the numbers must use a numeral, use numerals for all the quantities of that category.\n\nWhen a sentence has two numerals adjacent to each other, using a combination of numerals and spelled out numbers can help avoid confusion. If one of the numbers is a unit of measurement, leave that number a numeral. In other cases, spell out the shorter of the two numbers.\n\n[she bought five 8-foot beams, he turns 21 two days before I do]\n\nSpell out first through ninth when they indicate sequence in time or location.
