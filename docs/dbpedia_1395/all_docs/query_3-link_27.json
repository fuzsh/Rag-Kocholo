Those individuals who have responsibilities at the A-State System level and report to the system president are vice presidents.\n\nW\n\nwebsite and social media\n\nThe goal of our online presence is to make Arkansas State a university that is easy to locate and with which to interact. For the growing impact of search engines, having a unique identifier is important. At the start of the internet era, Arkansas State took the domain name of “astate” as Arizona State claimed “asu.” While we recognize that within the Arkansas State family we always will be ASU, in a global world it becomes important to emphasize the difference between us and our similarly named western colleague.\n\nTo be consistent with the guidelines for A-State, we ask that when referring to our main university website that we write AState.edu. This is in prose or in design work.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press Stylebook: “Website addresses are also known as Uniform Resource Locators, or URLs. Follow the spelling and capitalization of the website owner.” (our emphasis added). As we have now expressed as the website owner that AState.edu is our form of spelling and capitalization, we ask that media as well as our university community utilize our style.\n\nSince URLs and most social media services do not recognize a dash, do not add a dash as this will cause end users to be unable to locate the address (A-State.edu is NOT correct). While capitalization will not matter to browsers, we also do not allow astAte.edu, ASTATE.EDU, ASTATE.edu or AState.EDU.\n\nIn variation from AP style, all website addresses in prose or design will not utilize “http://” or “www.” These are legacy items from a time where they were necessary to locate the URL, and we want to put the focus on the location of our institution. This is also for brevity. Consider that “http://www.” is as many characters (11) as the domain level name of “AState.edu” (11).\n\nFor purposes of visual clarity, all social media should include similar constructions. Since the majority of online services are not case sensitive, making our handles, hashtags and unique identifiers easier to read will increase the ability of our followers to remember us and differentiate from similar names.\n\nFacebook.com/ArkansasState\n\nTwitter.com/ArkansasState\n\nInstagram.com/ArkansasState\n\nVimeo.com/ArkansasState\n\nYouTube.com/ArkansasState\n\nThe ability to help “visual search” is particularly apparent in longer social labels and those for individuals.\n\nTwitter.com/CoachSCaldwell\n\nFacebook.com/BlakeAnderson\n\nWhen written in prose, the social network’s preferred name and capitalization is followed by a slash and our designation.\n\nWhen expressed visually, the preference is for the icon logo of the service followed by a slash and our designation.\n\nAs an institution, our default hash tag is: #AState\n\nAll advertising and marketing materials for the university include social media references to promote our social media accounts.\n\nweekdays\n\nSpell out days of the week. Do NOT abbreviate.\n\nwinter semester\n\nDo not use. See semesters.\n\nR.M. “Bob” Wood Sales Leadership Center\n\nCenter in the Neil Griffin College of Business.\n\nY\n\nyear\n\nThere is rarely a need to use the year in campus publication texts, as long as the document is dated. (One exception would be those instances where several events that encompass both the current year and the next year are listed.)\n\nAPPENDIX A\n\nArkansas State University System Style Guide\n\nThe Arkansas State University System Style Guide is incorporated here in full. Questions about the ASU System Style Guide may be directed to the Vice President for Strategic Communications.\n\n• Arkansas State University System should be used on first reference, then ASU System on second and subsequent references. \"A-State System” is incorrect.\n\n• Arkansas State University Board of Trustees on first reference, then board or trustees on second and subsequent reference. “A-State Board of Trustees” is incorrect. It's a system board and not a Jonesboro campus board.\n\n• Arkansas State University, A-State, Arkansas State and the Red Wolves mascot refer ONLY to the Jonesboro university campus. Neither the system nor the two-year colleges use the A-State or Arkansas State name or logo. Use Arkansas State University on first reference, then A-State or Arkansas State on second and subsequent references. “ASU” and “ASU-Jonesboro” are no longer used to refer to the Jonesboro university campus except informally or in state government reporting (e.g. ADHE).\n\n• When written in prose or headlines, capitalize the “A” and “S” with a hyphen for A-State. Do not use “AState”, “Astate,” “stAte,” or “ASTATE” for this type of second reference. Only when social media or other computer applications do not allow for a hyphen is “AState” the acceptable alternative. Again, please note the capital “A” and “S”.\n\n• Use Arkansas State University-Beebe, Arkansas State University-Mountain Home, Arkansas State University-Newport or Arkansas State University Mid-South on first reference, then ASU-Beebe, ASU-Mountain Home, ASU-Newport or ASU Mid-South on second and subsequent references. ASUN, ASUB, ASUMH and ASU Mid-South are acceptable for headlines. Again, Arkansas State University-Jonesboro and ASU-Jonesboro are not correct usage.\n\n• The Arkansas State University System includes Arkansas State University, in Jonesboro; five two-year institutions: ASU-Beebe, ASU-Newport, ASU-Mountain Home, ASU Mid-South, in West Memphis, and ASU Three Rivers, in Malvern; Arkansas State University Campus Queretaro in the State of Queretaro, Mexico; and the newest addition, Henderson State University, a four-year institution in Arkadelphia. ASU-Beebe also has campuses in Heber Springs and Searcy and an instructional site at Little Rock Air Force Base. ASU-Newport also has campuses in Jonesboro and Marked Tree.\n\n• The following are subsidiary campus names along with second reference options:\n\n-- We no longer use ASU-Heber Springs, ASU-Searcy or ASU-Little Rock Air Force Base to refer to ASU-Beebe affiliated campuses. Apply names of those campuses using this style: Arkansas State University-Beebe at Heber Springs on first reference, then ASU-Beebe at Heber Springs on second and subsequent references. Also, use Arkansas State University-Beebe Online and then ASU-Beebe Online to refer to online classes and enrollment.\n\n-- For Arkansas State University-Newport campuses in Jonesboro and Marked Tree, use Arkansas State University-Newport at Jonesboro or Arkansas State University-Newport at Marked Tree on first reference. On second reference, acceptable uses are ASU-Newport at Jonesboro, ASU-Newport at Marked Tree, ASUN at Jonesboro and ASUN at Marked Tree.\n\n-- Use Arkansas State University Campus Queretaro for the campus in Mexico. Use A-State Campus Queretaro or A-State CQ on second and subsequent references. ASU-Queretaro, ASUCQ and ASUQ are not acceptable uses. In Mexico only, the style is Arkansas State University Campus Querétaro, México.\n\n-- For guidance on references to New York Institute of Technology at A-State, see the NYIT entry in the A-State Style Guide.\n\n# # #"
