The confusion comes from usages such as: “Martin Gomez is in his first year as editor of a major university journal. That journal, ABC, has existed for more than 50 years.” There, ABC is a nonessential part of the sentence and is therefore set off by commas. So:\n\nWRONG: ABC editor, Martin Gomez is here.\n\nRIGHT: ABC editor Martin Gomez is here. The editor of ABC, Martin Gomez, is here.\n\ncommencement\n\nCapitalize when referring to a specific commencement and precede with “General.”\n\nThe 2021 General Commencement will begin at 6 p.m. Thursday, May 5.\n\nLowercase when writing generally about commencements.\n\ncommittees\n\nCapitalize titles of official or formal committees; lowercase unofficial or informal ones.\n\nCampus Health and Safety Committee\n\nUndergraduate Scholarship Committee\n\nHer courses must be preapproved by her graduate committee.\n\nContinuum magazine\n\nSee University of Utah Magazine entry.\n\nconvocation\n\nCapitalize when referring to a specific convocation and precede with the college name.\n\nCandidates attending a College of Humanities Convocation ceremony can request accommodations.\n\nLowercase when writing generally about college convocations.\n\ncourse/class titles\n\nProper nouns (e.g., languages) should be initial caps in all instances.

My favorite class was History of American Novelists.\n\ncoursework\n\nOne word\n\ncurriculum\n\nCurriculum (n. sing) means the subjects, materials and plan of study for an academic course.\n\nTo pluralize, use curricula (not curriculums).\n\nD\n\ndash (em)\n\nUse the em dash (—) without space on either side.\n\nStudents enrolled in the most popular course—Ceramics 150—within the first hour of registration.\n\ndatabase\n\nOne word\n\ndates\n\nIn text, a date including a year should be set off with commas.\n\nOn January 12, 2017, the class met in the law building.\n\nWhen a month is used with a specific date, abbreviate only Jan., Feb., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov. and Dec.

Per Utah House Bill 261 passed in January 2024, the university no longer has an EDI division.
