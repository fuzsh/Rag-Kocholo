        "text": "Transfer Orientation\n\nDo transfer students have to attend orientation?\n\nYes! All transfer students are required to complete both FIUs Virtual Orientation and an in person Transfer Orientation. You will not be eligible to enroll in courses until both orientations are completed.\n\nVirtual Orientation (fully online) covers important information about your transition to FIU, including key resources you may need during your first term. To access the Virtual Orientation, log into your myFIU account, and scroll down to the “Orientation” tile of your Student Center. Complete the Virtual Orientation by following the activity guide within the “Orientation” tile.\n\nTransfer Orientation (in person) focuses on transfer credits, financial aid, advising, and registration. You will be eligible to attend this orientation once you complete Virtual Orientation.\n\nFor more information or questions about Virtual or Transfer Orientation, visit Orientation and Family Programs.\n\nAre family members/friends allowed to attend the academic advising session with me during orientation?\n\nNo. Guests are welcomed to attend orientation, however, only students and academic advisors are present in the academic advising session.\n\nAfter I pay my enrollment deposit, how do I know what classes to take?\n\nOnce you pay your $200 enrollment deposit, you will need to complete FIUs Virtual Orientation. As soon as you complete Virtual Orientation, you will be ready to register and attend the in-person Transfer Orientation. Here, you will learn more about how transfer credits are evaluated and applied to your degree program, meet with an academic advisor, and register for classes on site.\n\nTransfer Credits\n\nCan I have my transfer courses evaluated by my academic advisor?\n\nYes. Your academic advisor can facilitate the evaluation of upper-division courses (3000-4000/junior-senior level) since these are evaluated by faculty members in the academic unit. Your advisor can also work with Transfer & Transition Services staff to facilitate the evaluation of transfer courses that may satisfy FIU’s University Core Curriculum (UCC).\n\nI see abbreviations in the Transfer Equivalency Database (TED) and Panther Degree Audit (PDA). What do these mean?\n\nTED is a searchable transfer equivalency database that includes transfer rules from institutions in the U.S., as well as Puerto Rico and Guam. TED shows direct equivalencies to FIU courses, as well as equivalencies to pseudo or “fake” UCC courses that may still be used to satisfy FIU’s University Core Curriculum (UCC) or other requirements. For example, let’s suppose you transfer an art course that FIU does not teach. In this case, you may be awarded ART UCC1, which will satisfy the UCC Arts section. Other abbreviations we use in the UCC include:\n\nENC:English Composition\n\nHUM: Humanities\n\nMAC:Mathematics\n\nMGF:Mathematics\n\nSTA:Statistics\n\nNPM:Non-Pure/Mathematics (computer programming/logic)\n\nSOC: Social Science\n\nGLS:General Life Science/Natural Science\n\nBSC:Biological Science/Natural Science\n\nGPS: General Physical Science/Natural Science\n\nCHM: Chemistry/Natural Science\n\nART: Arts\n\nGRW: Gordon Rule Writing\n\nFFL: Foreign Language\n\nTRF: Transfer Course\n\nELE:Elective\n\nUCC1: University Core Curriculum Category 1\n\nUCC2: University Core Curriculum Category 2\n\nSome of the courses I completed at my transfer institution are not in your Transfer Equivalency Database (TED). Will these courses be evaluated?\n\nYes. As soon as you are admitted to FIU and pay the $200 enrollment deposit, Transfer & Transition Services (TTS) begins evaluating transfer courses that do not have existing transfer rules and that may satisfy FIU’s University Core Curriculum (UCC). We use the most updated transcript we have on record to do this work. Therefore, it is critical that you send your most recent official transcript to FIU.\n\nWhen you sign up to attend Transfer Orientation, TTS reviews any pending courses using updated transcripts. If at the point of orientation, you still do not see these courses evaluated, meet with your academic advisor or a Transfer & Transition Services staff member. You will likely need to submit a course equivalency request. For more details, refer to our Transfer Course Equivalency Process.\n\nIf you transfer upper-division courses (3000-4000/junior-senior level) in the major, those courses are evaluated in the academic unit, and your academic advisor is the primary point of contact.\n\nWhat is TED (Transfer Equivalency Database)?\n\nTED is FIUs Transfer Equivalency Database, which includes transfer rules from institutions in the U.S., as well as Puerto Rico and Guam. TED is a fantastic resource exactly because it shows which courses have already been evaluated for transfer.\n\nWhere do I go if I have a question about my transfer credits, specifically, my transfer credit evaluation?\n\nYou can meet with your academic advisor or a staff member in Transfer & Transition Services.\n\nHow will my transfer courses be applied to an FIU degree?\n\nTransfer & Transition Services evaluates courses that satisfy FIU’s University Core Curriculum (UCC) and apply those courses accordingly. Transfer courses that are upper-division (3000-4000/junior-senior level) and may meet major/program requirements are evaluated by the academic unit and applied accordingly.\n\nHow do I know what transfer credits FIU will accept?\n\nFIU accepts transfer courses from accredited institutions (see accreditation FAQ below for details), including institutions that participate in Florida’s Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS). A grade of ‘D’ will be accepted for transfer, although it may not satisfy specific requirements.\n\nWhat is the lowest acceptable grade I can transfer to FIU?\n\nA course with a grade of “D” will transfer to FIU. It is important to note, however, that a grade of “C” or better is required in some FIU University Core Curriculum (UCC) courses, and may be required in courses in the major, including prerequisites. Therefore, even though a course may be accepted and transferred with a grade of “C-,” a student will need to repeat that course to earn the required passing grade.\n\nHow many transfer credits does FIU accept?\n\nA maximum of 60 lower-division credits and 30 upper-division credits can be counted toward the bachelor’s degree. These credits must be from institutions that are nationally accredited (see accreditation FAQ below for details), including those that participate in Florida’s Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS).\n\nWill FIU accept my military credits?\n\nYes. Credit earned for military experience/education is evaluated based on credit recommendations by the American Council on Education (ACE) included in the Joint Services Transcript (JST). Military credit from the Air Force is reviewed using transcripts from the Community College of the Air Force/Air University.\n\nIf I have university-level transfer courses from an institution outside the U.S., will FIU award credit?\n\nYes. The Office of International Admissions staff evaluates transfer credits from institutions outside the U.S. These institutions must be comparable to an accredited institution in the U.S. To learn more about the admission requirements for transfer students, including the evaluation of foreign credentials, visit International Admissions.\n\nI attend college outside the U.S. How can I get my transfer credits evaluated?\n\nMuch like domestic institutions, FIU has transfer rules for courses from institutions outside the U.S. If you need courses evaluated, please refer to our Transfer Equivalency Process.\n\nI was told that FIU accepts transfer credits from colleges/universities that are accredited? What does that mean?\n\nAccreditation is a designation given to colleges/universities that have voluntarily engaged in meeting minimum standards as part of a self-regulation process.\n\nFIU accepts transfer credit from institutions whose institutional accreditor is recognized by the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Postsecondary Education.\n\nIn Florida, some accredited institutions participate in Florida’s Statewide Course Numbering System (SCNS), which guarantees the transfer of credit. FIU is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC).\n\nIf you are unsure about your transfer institution’s accreditation, check your institution’s website, catalog, or ask a staff member in your institution’s admissions or registrar’s office.\n\nI'm transferring from an institution that is in the quarter system. How will my credits transfer to FIU's semester system?\n\nCredits from a quarter system will be divided by 1.5. Therefore, if you completed a course at your previous institution that was 3 quarter credits, FIU will award 2 credits. For FIU’s University Core Curriculum (UCC), Transfer & Transition Services can waive the 1 pending credit to meet a requirement, however, because waivers do not award credit, you may need to complete additional credits at FIU to meet your 120 credits (or more) to graduate.\n\nFIU semesters (or terms) include Fall and Spring, each over a 15-week period (plus a final exam week). There is also a summer term consisting of three sessions: Summer A (6 weeks), Summer B (6 weeks), and Summer C (12 weeks running from the beginning of Summer A through the end of Summer B). Additional sessions, which have a variety of start and end dates within the Fall, Spring, and Summer terms, are offered for continuing students. Consult the Academic Calendar for registration and enrollment dates and deadlines.\n\nIf I transfer to FIU with my Associate in Arts (AA) degree, will FIU's University Core Curriculum (UCC) be satisfied?\n\nYes. An AA degree from a Florida public institution automatically satisfies the FIU’s University Core Curriculum.\n\nDoes FIU accept AA degrees from colleges outside of Florida?\n\nNo. However, if the AA is from an accredited institution, FIU accepts up to 60 lower-division transfer credits once we have evaluated those courses. The primary difference between the FL AA and others is this:\n\nStudents who earn the AA from a public college or university in Florida are guaranteed the full 60 lower-division credits and automatic completion of FIU’s University Core Curriculum (UCC) requirements, while all others require Transfer & Transition Services to evaluate their transfer courses one by one.\n\nBecause most AA degrees (General Education requirements) are similar, students generally receive 60 lower-division credits even when the AA is outside Florida. What tends to happen more often is that students may still be missing 1-2 courses from FIU’s University Core Curriculum (UCC) due to differences in requirements.\n\nCan I take classes at MDC or BC?\n\nWhen FIU is your “home” institution and you wish to complete a course at MDC, BC, or any other college/university, you are considered a Transient Student. Before you decide to enroll in a course at another institution, you must meet with your academic advisor who will review the course(s) you wish to complete at the other institution and determine if it is transferable to your major. You do not want to go through the process and complete a course only to learn that your major will not accept it.\n\nIf you wish to complete courses at another Florida public college/university, you must complete the Florida Shines Transient Student Admission Application. This process includes a review of the course by your academic advisor. If you wish to complete courses at a Florida private college/university or a college/university outside Florida, meet with your academic advisor to secure a memo or email approval of course transferability.\n\nIf you happened to perform poorly in a course at MDC or BC (or other Florida public college) during your last term, you may return to the state college to repeat that course while also attending FIU. If you are receiving financial aid, make sure to discuss your Transient Student status to determine any impact on your aid, as well as the process to secure aid at the visiting institution. Once you complete the course, submit a final transcript to FIU so that we can include the course on your academic record.\n\nWhat services are available to transfer students?\n\nAll student services at FIU are inclusive, and therefore, can be used by transfer students.\n\nWill my transfer GPA be used at FIU?\n\nFIU considers the transfer GPA in the admissions process. The GPA you earn at FIU is calculated only for grades earned at FIU, including those earned through Dual Enrollment at FIU. If you plan to attend graduate or professional school, you will be asked to submit transcripts from all institutions attended.\n\nACE-Evaluated Courses\n\nDoes FIU accept transfer credits from Saylor Academy?\n\nYes, see ACE-Evaluated Courses for accepted credits.\n\nDoes FIU accept transfer credits from StraighterLine?\n\nYes, see ACE-Evaluated Courses for accepted credits.\n\nI am considering taking courses through ACE-evaluated providers such as Study.com or Sophia Learning. Will these courses transfer to FIU?\n\nNo, FIU accepts a limited number of courses from Saylor Academy and StraighterLine. To review course equivalencies and learn how to transfer these credits to FIU, see ACE-Evaluated Courses.\n\nTest Credits/Credit-by-Exam\n\nWhat credits does FIU award for passing scores in AP, IB, CLEP?\n\nVisit our Credit-by-Exam page to review equivalency tables.\n\nWhere should I send my official scores for AP, IB, CLEP?\n\nMost official scores are sent electronically. If this is not possible, please send official scores to:\n\nFlorida International University\n\nUndergraduate Admissions\n\nP.O. Box 659003\n\nMiami, FL 33265-9003\n\nCivic Literacy\n\nWhat is the Civic Literacy requirement?\n\nThe Civic Literacy requirement is a new (FL) legislative mandate requiring undergraduate degree-seeking students, initially entering a Florida public college or university in the 2018-19 academic year and thereafter, to demonstrate civic literacy prior to graduation. The requirement was updated for students initially entering a Florida public college or university in the 2021-22 academic year. Visit Graduation Requirements (see Civic Literacy) for more information.\n\nWho needs to satisfy the Civic Literacy requirement?\n\nThe Civic Literacy requirement applies to all undergraduate degree-seeking students initially entering a Florida public college or university in the 2018-19 academic year, and thereafter. The requirement was updated for students initially entering a Florida public college or university in the 2021-22 academic year. Visit Graduation Requirements (see Civic Literacy) for more information.\n\nHow long do I have to satisfy the Civic Literacy requirement?\n\nStudents must satisfy the Civic Literacy requirement prior to graduation. We strongly encourage students who have not satisfied this requirement after transferring to FIU to do so during their 1st or 2nd term.\n\nDoes the Civic Literacy requirement apply to transfer students?\n\nThe Civic Literacy requirement applies to transfer students who are initially entering a Florida public college or university starting in the 2018-19 academic year. All degree-seeking students who transfer to FIU from an institution outside a Florida public college or university starting in the 2018-19 academic year, and who have not satisfied this requirement, must do so prior to graduation.\n\nIf I earned an Associate in Arts (AA) degree from a Florida public college/university prior to the 2018-19 academic year, and am enrolled in a bachelor's program at FIU beginning Fall 2018 or after, does the Civic Literacy requirement apply to me?\n\nNo. Students who earned an Associate in Arts (AA) degree from a Florida public college or university prior to the 2018-19 academic year are not required to satisfy the Civic Literacy requirement because they are not initially entering a Florida public college/university in the 2018-19 academic year.\n\nCan transfer courses be used to satisfy the Civic Literacy requirement?\n\nStudents who initially entered the SUS or FCS in the 2018-19 academic year through the 2020-21 academic year may not ;use transfer courses to satisfy this requirement.\n\nBeginning academic year 2021-22 and thereafter, students transferring from out-of-state or private institutions with approved equivalents to POS 2041 or AMH 2020 (reviewed by Transfer and Transition Services) may use these courses to satisfy the Civic Literacy requirement. Transfer courses must include the competencies outlined in Board Regulation 8.006.\n\nDoes FIU offer the approved courses to satisfy the Civic Literacy requirement?\n\nYes. FIU offers the two approved courses, POS 2041 and AMH 2020. Should you be attending an institution that does not offer these courses, you may complete approved accelerated mechanisms or credit-by-exam, which can be found in Graduation Requirements (see Civic Literacy). Students in Florida also have the option of taking POS 2041 and AMH 2020 at another Florida public college or university outside their home institution through the Transient Student Admission Application on Florida Shines. We encourage students to work with their home institutions and academic advisors for additional information about the transient student process.\n\nWhat if POS 2041 or AMH 2020 are not required in my major?\n\nAll students, regardless of their major, must satisfy the Civic Literacy requirement. Both POS 2041 and AMH 2020 satisfy FIU’s University Core Curriculum (UCC) Social Science Group 1. If you are transferring to FIU and still need to satisfy Social Science Group 1, one option is to complete one of the approved courses. If, however, your major requires a different course as part of Social Science Group 1, then you can consider demonstrating competency through one of the approved accelerated mechanisms.\n\nWhat are the approved accelerated mechanisms to satisfy the Civic Literacy requirement?\n\nVisit Graduation Requirements (see Civic Literacy) to view options.\n\nDoes FIU offer the AP exam to satisfy the Civic Literacy requirement?\n\nNo. AP exams are only available to high school students. If you are in high school, please ask your teacher or guidance counselor about AP options.\n\nDoes FIU offer the CLEP exam and Florida Civic Literacy Test (FCLT) to satisfy the Civic Literacy requirement?\n\nYes. FIU offers the CLEP exam and FCLT. Please visit FIU’s Center for Testing and Career Certification for information about registration, fees, and to access study material.\n\nIf I received credit for POS 2041 and/or AMH 2020 through A/AS Level, IB, or other credit-by-exams, do these satisfy the Civic Literacy requirement?\n\nYes. Visit Graduation Requirements (see Civic Literacy) to view options and passing scores.\n\nAcademic Advising\n\nWho provides academic advising?\n\nAll transfer students have an assigned academic advisor in their chosen major. You can find your advisor’s contact information and advising schedule on your Student Dashboard. Go to myFIU, followed by PSN (Panther Success Network).\n\nWhat is included in my Student Dashboard?\n\nYour Student Dashboard includes the Panther Success Network (PSN), which is a set of resources and tools to help keep you on track to earning your degree.\n\nAdvisor contact information & appointment scheduling\n\nAdvisor Notes: Notes from every advising session\n\nAlerts: Notifications if you are not making progress toward your degree\n\nMessages: Send and respond to messages with your assigned advisor<\n\nResources: MyMajorMatch (Career Assessment) and Panther Degree Audit (PDA) [/su_spoiler]"
