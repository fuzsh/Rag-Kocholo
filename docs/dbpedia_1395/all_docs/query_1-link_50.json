        "text": "Presenter: John Seibyl, M.D. | Distinguished Scientist, Invicro\n\nTau PET imaging is now commonly incorporated as an imaging biomarker in clinical research trials in Alzheimerâ€™s and other tauopathies, particularly regarding serial longitudinal change in the evaluation of therapeutics designed to slow the course of disease. Both qualitative and quantitative assessments provide useful corroborative reporting endpoints.\n\nThe methods which operationalize these outcome measures, based on an understanding of the dynamic pathophysiology of brain tau deposition and its phenomenological manifestations on the PET scan are described for different tau radiopharmaceuticals, along with implications for future clinical and clinical research applications.\n\nIn this webinar, the presenter will:\n\nDescribe the differences between Amyloid and Tau PET with regard to pathophysiology and differing roles in clinical research trials\n\nDescribe the methodology and its validation for performing the visual interpretation of different Tau PET imaging agents\n\nExplain the advantages and disadvantages of quantitative versus qualitative Tau PET assessments for questions posed in clinical research\n\nDr. Seibyl is an international expert on PET and SPECT imaging for neurodegenerative disorders. He is past President of the Brain Imaging Council of the Society of Nuclear Medicine. Dr. Seibyl is dually-boarded in Nuclear Medicine and Psychiatry and has twenty years of experience in clinical studies. He has made significant contributions to development of visual and quantitative analysis for PET imaging in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Along with Dr. Marek, he has directed and continues to direct several international multicenter imaging studies. Dr. Seibyl is an author on over hundred publications on CNS imaging."
