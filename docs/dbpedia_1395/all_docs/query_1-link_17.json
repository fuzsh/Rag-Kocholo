        "text": "Artist: Tau Lewis\n\nExhibition title: Making it work to be together while we can\n\nVenue: Jeffrey Stark, New York, US\n\nDate: May 4 – June 1, 2018\n\nPhotography: all images copyright and courtesy of the artist, COOPER COLE, Toronto and Jeffrey Stark, New York\n\n‘Us the broad communion of the mermaid people\n\nwho travel between earthly and aquatic territories\n\nlooking for mermaid congregations\n\nand making it work to be together while we can\n\nus mermaids want appreciation\n\nus mermaids who walk around on big broad feet\n\nand who were made to swim well\n\nbecause of mermaid blood in our DNA\n\nand us who live underwater preserving\n\nnegros historical information systems\n\nlet this room be meeting place for us\n\nthe communion of the mermaid people\n\nand any peoples who are making it work to be together while they can.’\n\nJeffrey Stark is pleased to announce an exhibition of new work by Tau Lewis entitled making it work to be together while we can.\n\nTau Lewis’ self-taught practice is rooted in healing personal, collective and historical traumas through labour. She employs methods of construction such as hand sewing, carving and assemblage of found and repurposed materials to build portraits. Lewis’ conceptual framework investigates black identity and agency, memory and recovery.\n\nLewis’ recent works consider the undocumented, sometimes inaccessible historical information centers of black life such as the oceans, forests, and deep underground spaces. Her figures are often colored and textured to mimic the oceans, earth, and cosmos. Lewis uses animal and insect imagery as playful and ironic references to the demarcation of black bodies as separate from other genres of being human, and the usefully confined and unfree existence of black people. Infused with personal belongings, found objects and material markers of time, each portrait is an energetically charged microcosm of memory. The unreal, unbelonging and bulletproof characters of an imaginary landscape, joyfully realized through sculpture.\n\nAt Jeffrey Stark, Lewis will present a series of three new works comprising a human scale plaster sculpture, a soft sculpture, and a quilt that together address the conditions of the black body’s inextricable ties to nature and the histories of erasure and replacement at the heart of those relationships.\n\nDescribing the show as portraits of landscapes, Lewis considers what an undocumented or inaccessible landscape might hold and how we can re-access these spaces through storytelling and imagination. The works on view contemplate the role of water as a central medium within the transatlantic slave trade and in an act of invented remembrance, Lewis employs the mythological creature of the mermaid to reanimate a history of loss.\n\n‘I’m considering the millions of black people who died at sea during the transatlantic slave trade and looking at the water as holding all of these secrets that belonged to those communities/ learning systems, spiritual traditions, stories, information systems. And what if those things all existed still underwater, and what if those people all became mermaids. I think of ancestors as mermaids because there are so many of them whose spirits live underwater or travel back to the water.’\n\n-Tau Lewis\n\nTau Lewis, Making it work to be together while we can, 2018, exhibition view, Jefrrey Stark, New York\n\nTau Lewis, Making it work to be together while we can, 2018, exhibition view, Jefrrey Stark, New York\n\nTau Lewis, Making it work to be together while we can, 2018, exhibition view, Jefrrey Stark, New York\n\nTau Lewis, Making it work to be together while we can, 2018, exhibition view, Jefrrey Stark, New York\n\nTau Lewis, Making it work to be together while we can, 2018, exhibition view, Jefrrey Stark, New York\n\nTau Lewis, Making it work to be together while we can, 2018, exhibition view, Jefrrey Stark, New York\n\nTau Lewis, Making it work to be together while we can, 2018, exhibition view, Jefrrey Stark, New York\n\nTau Lewis, Making it work to be together while we can, 2018, Found furs, leathers and fabrics (hand sewn), seashells, sea stones, 96 x 84 x 4 in (243.8 x 213.4 x 10.2 cm)\n\nTau Lewis, Making it work to be together while we can, 2018, Found furs, leathers and fabrics (hand sewn), seashells, sea stones, 96 x 84 x 4 in (243.8 x 213.4 x 10.2 cm)\n\nTau Lewis, Making it work to be together while we can, 2018, Found furs, leathers and fabrics (hand sewn), seashells, sea stones, 96 x 84 x 4 in (243.8 x 213.4 x 10.2 cm)\n\nTau Lewis, Making it work to be together while we can, 2018, Found furs, leathers and fabrics (hand sewn), seashells, sea stones, 96 x 84 x 4 in (243.8 x 213.4 x 10.2 cm)\n\nTau Lewis, Making it work to be together while we can, 2018, Found furs, leathers and fabrics (hand sewn), seashells, sea stones, 96 x 84 x 4 in (243.8 x 213.4 x 10.2 cm)\n\nTau Lewis, Making it work to be together while we can, 2018, Found furs, leathers and fabrics (hand sewn), seashells, sea stones, 96 x 84 x 4 in (243.8 x 213.4 x 10.2 cm)\n\nTau Lewis, Making it work to be together while we can, 2018, Found furs, leathers and fabrics (hand sewn), seashells, sea stones, 96 x 84 x 4 in (243.8 x 213.4 x 10.2 cm)\n\nTau Lewis, Making it work to be together while we can, 2018, Found furs, leathers and fabrics (hand sewn), seashells, sea stones, 96 x 84 x 4 in (243.8 x 213.4 x 10.2 cm)\n\nTau Lewis, Making it work to be together while we can, 2018, Found furs, leathers and fabrics (hand sewn), seashells, sea stones, 96 x 84 x 4 in (243.8 x 213.4 x 10.2 cm)\n\nTau Lewis, Making it work to be together while we can, 2018, Found furs, leathers and fabrics (hand sewn), seashells, sea stones, 96 x 84 x 4 in (243.8 x 213.4 x 10.2 cm)\n\nTau Lewis, Making it work to be together while we can, 2018, Found furs, leathers and fabrics (hand sewn), seashells, sea stones, 96 x 84 x 4 in (243.8 x 213.4 x 10.2 cm)\n\nTau Lewis, Seashell, 2018, Hand sewn fabrics, furs and leathers, hand carved plaster, acrylic paint, wire, stones, jute, hardware, sea shells, sea stones, 25 x 16 x 20 in (63.5 x 40.6 x 50.8 cm)\n\nTau Lewis, Seashell, 2018, Hand sewn fabrics, furs and leathers, hand carved plaster, acrylic paint, wire, stones, jute, hardware, sea shells, sea stones, 25 x 16 x 20 in (63.5 x 40.6 x 50.8 cm)\n\nTau Lewis, Seashell, 2018, Hand sewn fabrics, furs and leathers, hand carved plaster, acrylic paint, wire, stones, jute, hardware, sea shells, sea stones, 25 x 16 x 20 in (63.5 x 40.6 x 50.8 cm)\n\nTau Lewis, Seashell, 2018, Hand sewn fabrics, furs and leathers, hand carved plaster, acrylic paint, wire, stones, jute, hardware, sea shells, sea stones, 25 x 16 x 20 in (63.5 x 40.6 x 50.8 cm)\n\nTau Lewis, Seashell, 2018, Hand sewn fabrics, furs and leathers, hand carved plaster, acrylic paint, wire, stones, jute, hardware, sea shells, sea stones, 25 x 16 x 20 in (63.5 x 40.6 x 50.8 cm)\n\nTau Lewis, Seashell, 2018, Hand sewn fabrics, furs and leathers, hand carved plaster, acrylic paint, wire, stones, jute, hardware, sea shells, sea stones, 25 x 16 x 20 in (63.5 x 40.6 x 50.8 cm)\n\nTau Lewis, What in the water?
