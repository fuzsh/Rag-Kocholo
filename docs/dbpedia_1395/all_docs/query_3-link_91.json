        "text": "Wendy Post is a seasoned nursing professional and a passionate advocate for maternal health with over 25 years of experience. She holds a Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) and is currently pursuing a PhD at George Washington University School of Nursing. Her extensive career in nursing has been dedicated to addressing maternal morbidity and mortality, particularly in underserved communities impacted by maternal health deserts and maternal morbidity and mortality.\n\nIn addition to her academic pursuits, Wendy has taken on the role of a forensic nurse examiner in Maryland, enhancing her ability to support populations impacted by trauma. She is the founder of “The Birth Mark,” an organization committed to improving maternal health outcomes globally. Her organization has a specific branch dedicated to supporting women affected by maternal mortality, reflecting her deep commitment to advocacy and support for bereaved families.\n\nWendy’s current research involves a pilot study that explores the experiences of eyewitnesses and medical examiners involved in maternal deaths. This study employs verbal and social autopsy frameworks to gather comprehensive insights into the factors leading to maternal mortality. By interviewing bereaved family members and medical examiners, she aims to identify critical areas for improvement in maternal healthcare practices and inform policy changes that can reduce maternal deaths and address disparities in healthcare.\n\nHer dedication to maternal health extends beyond research as she actively engages in community outreach, education, and advocacy. Wendy has begun to present her work at various national and international conferences. Her contributions to the field of maternal health are driven by a profound commitment to closing the gaps in healthcare disparities and improving outcomes for all women.\n\nDr. Nikia Grayson, DNP, MSN, MPH, MA, CNM, FNP-C, FACNM (she/her) is a trailblazing force in reproductive justice, blending her expertise as a public health activist, anthropologist, and family nurse-midwife to champion the rights and health of underserved communities. Graduating with distinction from Howard University, Nikia holds a bachelor’s degree in communications and a master’s degree in public health. Her academic journey also led her to the University of Memphis, where she earned a master’s in medical anthropology, and the University of Tennessee, where she achieved both a master’s in nursing and a doctorate in nursing practice. Complementing her extensive education, she completed a post-master’s certificate in midwifery at Frontier Nursing University.\n\nWith over 15 years of experience in public health and nursing, Nikia has dedicated herself to advancing reproductive rights and justice, birth justice, and midwifery. Her passion for midwifery shines through in her commitment to diversifying the workforce of midwives and birth workers, especially in the southern United States. As a fervent disruptor of the current healthcare system, Nikia is pioneering new models of care that prioritize midwifery and center the needs of Black and brown communities. Every day, she works Tirelessly to ensure that all individuals have the agency and resources to make informed decisions about their sexual and reproductive health.\n\nAt CHOICES Center for Reproductive Health, Nikia serves as the Chief Clinical Officer, spearheading interfaces that have led to the establishment of the first nonprofit comprehensive reproductive health care center, the first Black midwifery fellowship program and the city’s inaugural birth center. Beyond her clinical leadership, Nikia sits on the Board of Directors for both the American College of Nurse Midwives and SisterReach, Tennessee’s foremost Reproductive Justice organization.\n\nDriven by a profound sense of purpose, Nikia Grayson is transforming the landscape of reproductive healthcare, leaving an indelible mark on the lives of those she serves and the communities she uplifts.\n\nDr. Robert White is the recipient of a Mentored Research Training Grant (MRTG) from the Foundation for Anesthesia Education and Research (FAER) for his project titled “Health Disparities in Obstetrical Care and Delivery Outcomes Before and After Implementation of an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery Protocol.”\n\nObstetrical healthcare disparities have been extensively reported, with Black women experiencing disproportionate mortality and severe maternal morbidity, explained Dr. White. The two-year, $250,000 grant will support Dr. White’s research into the effect of implementing Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols on delivery outcomes, and the development of a data-driven dashboard for clinicians. The support will further Dr. White’s research into interventions that promote patient equality and equity. Dr. Kane Pryor is the primary faculty mentor.\n\nIn the first phase of the project, Dr. White and researchers from the Center for Perioperative Outcomes will investigate obstetrical healthcare disparities on a national scale using databases from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). In the second phase, they will study the impact of the evidence-based ERAS protocols.\n\n“We’re looking at pre- and post-implementation of ERAS protocols in terms of outcomes for white, Black, Hispanic and Asian patients to see if these new care processes attenuate or eliminate disparities that exist,” said Dr. White.\n\nDr. White’s goal is to apply the research from the first two research questions to the development of a data-driven dashboard for clinicians that will help provide patient care recommendations and data visualizations.\n\n“Maternal mortality and morbidity is a major crisis afflicting our nation,” said Dr. White. “It’s exciting that healthcare disparities projects are getting an increased level of funding and that solutions to these national crises are being investigated.”\n\nDr. Robert White is an assistant professor of anesthesiology and was a Van Poznak Research Scholar in the Department of Anesthesiology. He obtained his undergraduate degree from Cornell University, his medical degree and a master’s in clinical research from Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and completed his anesthesia residency and obstetric anesthesia fellowship training at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. He has authored numerous manuscripts exploring healthcare disparities in perioperative outcomes and quality of care.\n\nThe FAER MRTG grant provides support for early-career training of anesthesiologist-scientists to achieve independence as scientific investigators.\n\nKarlie Porter Masaga is a Certified Nurse Midwife and Womens Health Nurse Practitioner providing care to women across their lifespan.

PhD, MPH, RN, FAAN\n\nAssociate Dean for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\n\nProfessor of Nursing, and Audrienne H. Moseley Endowed Chair in Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\n\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles, School of Nursing\n\nMy research program focuses on improving health outcomes of vulnerable populations using innovative health systems and informatics approaches. Two prominent themes of my work are: enhancing the quality of care for hospitalized older adults and improving self-management of chronic health conditions among Hispanic, African-American, and LGBTQ+ populations. My research is distinguished by interdisciplinary team science, which bridges nursing, medicine, psychology, computer science, and engineering, health systems, communities, and other academic institutions.\n\nMy research is leading the way to inform infrastructure development for data-driven knowledge generation that serves as a model for organizations across the United States (US) to improve the quality of care for hospitalized older adults. I am leveraging electronic patient, clinical, and administrative data and data science methods to identify valid, modifiable factors that predict hospital-acquired falls (HAF), which affect annually approximately one million US hospitalized patients. Studies I have published show that, in 168 US hospitals, poor nursing care quality was associated with more adverse patient events, including HAF. Using artificial intelligence approaches with electronic health record (EHR) data, I have discovered a set of six new clinical and organizational factors that can predict HAF. These findings were among the most downloaded in 2019, and have widespread implications since hospital patient falls continue to be a significant clinical concern internationally in healthcare systems. My lab also explores the use of registered nurses’ (RNs’) progress notes, or text data on patient observations, to predict HAF. We were the first to publish that RNs’ notes contain information about clinical, environmental, and organizational factors that can predict fall risk. I am Principal Investigator (PI) of a 5-year $2.57 million award from the National Institute on Aging. This cutting-edge health systems project is exploiting the use of text and structured EHR data to validate predictors of HAF and hospital-induced delirium. This study will expand the University of Florida Health EHR research infrastructure for data-driven knowledge generation.\n\nThe other cornerstone of my research program is developing health information technology (HIT) to promote chronic disease self-management. I pioneered and published a HIT design approach, known as Consumer-centered Participatory Design (C2 PD). Unlike other design approaches, C2 PD provides public health and community-based organizations, academic researchers, and commercial designers with a theoretically informed approach that engages consumers throughout the development and evaluation of HIT. C2 PD builds on the strengths and resources within a community, promotes a collaborative learning and empowering process, facilitates collaborative partnerships, and incorporates four components of HIT design, namely; user preferences, functions, tasks, and representational requirements, to develop highly usable systems. We introduced this innovative approach and presented our findings to informaticians at the International Medical Informatics Association Nursing Informatics Congress in 2012. We demonstrated that using the C2 PD approach resulted in a highly useful and usable fall prevention self-management system for English- and Spanish-speaking older adults. Since then, multiple investigators of HIT development and systematic review articles have referenced the use of the C2 PD approach. The C2 PD approach has been the basis of my other funded studies, including a $2.8 million National Institute of Nursing Research and $1.0 million Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality award. I have disseminated further wide-ranging use of the C2 PD method, including creating a mobile Health (mHealth) application (app) interface for Hispanic caregivers of persons with dementia to self-manage chronic stress and burden and an mHealth app to support African American caregivers of children with chronic asthma and obesity. The lessons I learned developing the C2 PD approach are represented in a paper I co-authored that focuses on using HIT to engage communities to improve health and reduce health disparities in populations. This is significant to the work I am conducting among people living with HIV. A study I published showed that a large proportion (85.5%) of people living with HIV are interested in using a mHealth app that supports HIV self-management, including functions to identify health services, provide health tips and medication reminders, communicate with healthcare providers, track their mood and emotions, and engage in social networking. My lab is expanding this research with funding from the Health Services and Resources Administration (HRSA) and the Florida Department of Public Health to inform creating and testing a technology-enabled self-management intervention.\n\nI have developed an independent and externally funded health services and informatics research program of over $8.85 million as PI. I publish in high impact journals and researchers and scholars in nursing, health services, and informatics cite my research regularly according to citation analytics (>1024, h-index:14, i10-index:18). Additionally, federal government agencies have recognized my research. I was a standing member of the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality HIT Research review panel from 2016-2020, and served on multiple NIH Special Emphasis Review Panels. My peers have recognized the impact of my research nationally, and I am disseminating my research program internationally. I am a Fellow of the American Academy of Nursing and the New York Academy of Medicine. In 2019, I received a 3-year UF Term Professorship that acknowledged my academic accomplishments in shaping the UF College of Nursing and the nursing discipline. I am currently the Associate Dean for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion; Professor of Nursing (with tenure); and, the Adrienne H. Mosely Endowed Chair in Diversity, Equity and Inclusion at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Nursing.\n\nBorn in Orange, California and raised in the beautiful state of Oregon, Rebekka Eshler has had an adventurous life.
