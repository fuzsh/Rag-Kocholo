        "text": "Author Guidelines for Journal of Management Leadership Submission\n\nManuscripts Submission:\n\nThe Full Text Manuscripts should be submitted by one of the authors of the manuscript through email at jml@tau.ac.id. Regardless of the source of the word-processing tool, preferably Word (.doc) files can be submitted through the system. The submitting author takes responsibility for the manuscript during submission and peer review.\n\nArticle Types for Submission:\n\nAll submitted formatted full-text articles should report original, previously unpublished research results, experimental or theoretical. Articles submitted to the JML should meet these criteria and must not be under consideration for publication elsewhere.\n\nThese articles should describe new and carefully confirmed findings, and experimental procedures should be given in sufficient detail for others to verify the work. The length of a full text article should be the minimum required to describe and interpret the work clearly. Regular Research Articles are 5 to 10 printed pages in length\n\nTerms of Submission:\n\nManuscripts must be submitted on the understanding that they have not been published elsewhere. The submitting author is responsible for ensuring that the article's publication has been approved by all the other co-authors. It is also the authors' responsibility to ensure that the articles emanating from a particular institution are submitted with the approval of the necessary institution. Only an acknowledgment from the editorial office officially establishes the date of receipt. Further correspondence and proofs will be sent to the author(s) before publication unless otherwise indicated. It is a condition of submission of a paper that the authors permit editing of the paper for readability.\n\nPeer Review Process:\n\nAll manuscripts are subject to peer-review and are expected to meet the scientific criteria of significance and academic excellence. Submissions will be considered by the editors and—if not rejected right away—by peer-reviewers, whose identities will remain anonymous to the authors.\n\nUnits of Measurement: In general, non-standard abbreviations should be used only when the full term is very long and used often. Each abbreviation should be spelled out and introduced in parentheses the first time it is used in the text.\n\nThe Structure of Manuscript\n\nTitle: Title should be short, dense and clear.\n\nAbstract: The manuscript should contain an abstract. The abstract should be self-contained and citation-free and should not exceed 150 words.\n\nKeywords: Add about four key words or phrases in alphabetical order, separated by commas.\n\nIntroduction: Introduction contains the background, state of the art that contains brief literature review, research gap, result expectations and motivation of the research.\n\nLiterature Review: Literature review describes the full explanation of the theories and previous related studies. Hypothesis development and theoretical framework (if any) also included in this section.\n\nResearch Method: It comprises the procedures of the research. It consists of the research designs, data types, sampling methods, operational variable definition and how to test the hypothesis (if any).\n\nResult and Discussion: The result section contains data that has been processed either by using tables or figures. After that, the findings has to be discussed clearly related to the underlying theories, hypothesis (if any), and supporting and/or non-supporting researches. Eventually, the implication of research findings has to be mentioned clearly both for academics and practitioners.\n\nConclusion: It reflects the logic and sincere findings of the research that answer the research problems (if any) or research purposes without any complete discussions anymore. Conclusion should be written in paragraph, not item list/numbering.\n\nReferences: Primary sources are preferably high valued by using the last ten (10) years references. The reference format is by using APA format.\n\nPreparation of Figures: Each figure should be embedded in the electronic manuscript file. All figures should be cited in the manuscript in a consecutive order. Each figure is subject to resizing to fit into the column's width of or the full text width for consistency and clarity. The labels of the figures are also subject to resizing to be of minimum 9pt according to conferences in-house specifications.\n\nPreparation of Tables: Tables should be cited consecutively in the text. Every table must have a descriptive title and if numerical measurements are given, the units should be included in the column heading. Vertical rules should not be used.\n\nProofs and Reprints: Corrected proofs must be returned to the publisher within 2-3 days of receipt. The publisher will do everything possible to ensure prompt publication. It will therefore be appreciated if the manuscripts and figures conform from the outset to the style of the conference.\n\nCopyright Transfer: One of the authors of the manuscript should sign the copyrights of their manuscripts, and all open access articles are distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution license, which permits unrestricted use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided that the original work is properly cited.\n\nThe use of general descriptive names, trade names, trademarks, and so forth in this publication, even if not specifically identified, does not imply that these names are not protected by the relevant laws and regulations.\n\nMailing Address\n\nJln.
