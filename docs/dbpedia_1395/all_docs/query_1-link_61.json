        "text": "BEACON. N.Y. — Minimalism was the late 20th century’s great hope for a heroic American art on the Abstract Expressionism model. Even after an upstart movement, Conceptualism — “idea art” — wafted in and blew old notions of “heroic” and “art” to bits, tradition-minded art lovers stayed loyal, and still do, to the Minimalist paradigm of greatness: abstract work that’s commanding in scale, cleanly made and destined for expensive rooms.\n\nCarl Andre was one of Minimalism’s founders. And his art looks terrific in the sonorous sunlight-washed spaces of Dia:Beacon here, where a career retrospective, “Carl Andre: Sculpture as Place, 1958-2010,” is making its debut. A half-century’s worth of his low-to-the-ground work turns Dia’s immense main galleries into what look, from afar, like sparsely settled lunar landscapes, though whether we’re looking at cities in formation or cemeteries in ruins is a question.\n\nA second question arises, this one about scale: How can such obviously monument-minded art feel so modest, even delicate? And there’s a third: Why has the maker of such companionable and intriguing work remained on the shadowed fringes of the New York art world spotlight for the past 30 years and more?\n\nMr. Andre has always said that his art is, in essential ways, a product of his history. And that history, like most, is shot through with contradictions. He was born in 1935 in Quincy, Mass., a Boston suburb notable for its Colonial roots, granite quarries and shipbuilding industry. His father, a Swedish immigrant who came from a line of blacksmiths and bricklayers, was a marine draftsman. His mother was an avid amateur poet."
