        "text": "üìç Pan American Recreation Center, 2100 E. Third St., Austin TX 78702\n\nRa√∫l Valdez\n\nRestored in 2011\n\nDescription from Black History Bike Ride‚Äôs website: The 4,000-square-foot Hillside Theater mural at the Oswaldo A.B. Cantu/Pan American Recreation Center is one of many murals Ra√∫l Valdez created in the 1970s. The story told in the mural spans different eras, including the Aztecs, Spanish conquistadors, the Chicano civil rights movement, and contemporary life. In 2011, the city spent $52,000 restoring the mural. At the time, Valdez told the Austin American-Statesman, ‚ÄúIt belongs to the people of East Austin. It‚Äôs a representation of what the people who lived there wanted to see.‚Äù\n\nüìç The Contemporary Austin ‚Äì Jones Center, 700 Congress Ave., Austin, TX 78701\n\nManik Raj Nakra\n\n2023\n\nIn Man Who Fell to Earth, Nakra finds inspiration in the Greek myth of Icarus, whose hubris led him to dismiss warnings that his manmade, wax wings would melt if he flew too close to the sun. The mural‚Äôs title also pays homage to the 1976 film ‚ÄúThe Man Who Fell to Earth,‚Äù in which David Bowie portrays an alien seeking water for his home planet, suffering from severe drought. In this panoramic scene, viewers are positioned amongst a group of animals, including a snake, a rat, and, at the center, a leopard, who watch the events transpire from afar. Nakra often uses exotic animals, particularly jungle cats, as stand-ins for the violence and greed of human history, colonial domination, and the exploitation of natural resources. Whether this scene is read as a commentary on imperialism‚Äôs effects on the environment or a hopeful vision of a landscape on the precipice of returning to nature remains up for interpretation.\n\nüìç Old Bakery & Artisan Emporium, 1006 Congress Ave., Austin, TX 78701\n\nRuben Esquivel\n\nFuture Mural, Estimated 2024\n\nOld Bakery & Artisan Emporium is a beloved historic site in Downtown Austin that is going through an extensive community engagement process to revitalize its park space with a new mural honoring Downtown Austin‚Äôs history. Old Bakery is home to a rich past of local entrepreneurship, stories of immigrants and movements for social change, and this future mural will pay homage to those stories. Through an artist selection process, Ruben Esquivel has been selected as the first to paint a mural at this site. After community engagement on proposed mural designs is concluded, he will begin painting in the space.\n\nüìç Republic Square, 422 Guadalupe St, Austin, TX 78701\n\nPOP! by Gentilhomme\n\nOn view from March 8, 2024 to March 22, 2024\n\nSet up in the heart of Republic Square as part of the Downtown Austin Alliance Foundation‚Äôs Writing on the Walls program, POP! brings you surprises, music and dance! POPO, POPUP, POPLI, POPETTE and POPOTIN are waiting for you to entice them to leave their mysterious luminous monoliths for an electrifying fiesta. There are five enigmatic monoliths where the POP! creatures live. Set them free by calling out to them, talking to them, or even by singing. As you encourage one to show itself, watch the monolith get brighter and brighter until it opens to release a creature who‚Äôs ready to put on a show. Get five people together to free the whole POP! gang at once, and you‚Äôll get a very special surprise!\n\nPhoto credit: POP! by Gentilhomme, a production of Quartier des Spectacles Partnership in partnership with Jack World ‚Äì 2023 ¬© Ulysse Lemerise\n\nüìçE 2nd St &, Brazos St, Austin, TX 78701\n\nJosef Kristofoletti\n\n2018\n\nLooming over the corner of Brazos and 2nd Street and reaching 10- stories tall, you can find Austin‚Äôs vibrant tower of color, Tau Ceti. Completed in November 2018 by artist Josef Kristofoletti, this piece transforms a previously blank parking garage corner into a stunning optic experience. Sunlight from surrounding buildings refracts and corresponds with the painted gradient color spectrum throughout the day. Tau Ceti references a single star in the constellation Cetus that is spectrally similar to our own sun and uses a bold color spectrum that represents unity and diversity. This piece was honored in 2018 with national recognition for excellence by the Americans for The Arts Public Art Network (PAN) Year in Review.\n\nüìç Pease Park Conservancy, 1100 Kingsbury St, Austin, TX 78703\n\nMell Lawrence Architects\n\n2021\n\nWith Pease Park‚Äôs Kingsbury Commons redesign led by Ten Eyck Landscape Architects came the debut of the ‚ÄùTree House‚Äù by Mell Lawrence Architects. The ‚ÄúTree House‚Äù gives visitors an immersive tree canopy experience in the heart of Texas. On the upper level, visitors can lie down on a suspended net and look up at the flora and fauna surrounding. As the foliage around the ‚ÄúTree House‚Äù matures, the structure will begin to blend in more and more with the area, blurring the line between steel and nature.\n\nüìçPease Park Conservancy, 1100 Kingsbury St, Austin, TX 78703\n\nThomas Dambo\n\nFuture Sculpture Coming Spring 2024\n\nDambo‚Äôs mission is to teach the world to ‚Äúwaste no more.‚Äù Around the world, people are drowning in trash, and the planet is running out of resources. Thomas Dambo creates all his sculptures with trash, scraps, and, in other ways, recycled or repurposed materials. Austin‚Äôs troll is made mainly from wood from an old Austin water tower, has a story about the dry weather, and teaches us to share the water with the animals we share the land with.\n\nüìç301 Congress Ave, Austin, TX 78701\n\nDAAS\n\n2022\n\n‚ÄúWhere the Wildflowers Grow‚Äù touches on themes of resiliency through community in an uplifting and beautiful way. This piece by DAAS inspires people to go outside and be in a space where they can root themselves with others. ‚ÄúWhere the Wildflowers Grow‚Äù was inspired by the following quote by Micheline Ryckman in her novel, ‚ÄúThe Maiden Ship‚Äù: ‚ÄúWildflowers are the loveliest of all because they grow in uncultivated soil, in those hard, rugged places where no one expects them to flourish. They are resilient in ways a garden bloom could never be. People are the same, son ‚Äì the most exquisite souls are those who survive where others cannot. They root themselves, along with their companions, wherever they are, and they thrive.‚Äù"
