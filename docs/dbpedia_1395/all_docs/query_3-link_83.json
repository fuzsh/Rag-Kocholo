        "text": "A\n\nacademic degrees\n\nIf mention of degrees is necessary to establish someone's credentials, the preferred form is to avoid an abbreviation and use instead a phrase such as: John Jones, who has a doctorate in psychology. or Sally has a master's degree in psychology. One exception is a terminal master's degree such a Master of Fine Arts, which must be distinguished from a regular master's degree. Example: She has a Master of Fine Arts in design. Use an apostrophe in bachelor's degree, a master's, etc., but there is no possessive in Bachelor of Arts or Master of Science. Also: an associate degree or associate degrees (no possessive). Use such abbreviations as BA, MA and PhD only when the need to identify many individuals by degree on first reference would make the preferred form cumbersome. For those with a PhD use Dr. preceding the name only on first reference.\n\nacademic semesters\n\nUpper case: Fall Semester, Spring 2020, Second Summer Session.\n\nacademic subjects and departments\n\nUse lower case for general subjects: mathematics, psychology; except foreign languages which are always capitalized. Capitalize formal department names: Provost's Office, History Department. USI style preference is to use Department or Office after the name and not \"Department of...\" or \"Office of...\"\n\nacronyms\n\nSpell out the full name first followed by the abbreviation in parentheses, then abbreviate throughout the rest of the text: Her grade point average (GPA) was consistent the first two years. However, her GPA dropped considerably her junior year. (This differs from AP Style.)\n\nadvisor\n\nAdvisor is the preferred spelling as opposed to adviser. (This differs from AP Style.)\n\naffirmative action statement\n\nThis statement of principle is used on USI printed publications: It is the policy of the University of Southern Indiana to be in full compliance with all federal and state non-discrimination and equal opportunity laws, orders and regulations relating to race, color, religion, sex (including pregnancy), national origin, age, disability, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, or veteran status. Questions or concerns should be directed to the Affirmative Action Officer, USI Human Resources Department, University of Southern Indiana, 8600 University Boulevard, Evansville, Indiana 47712.\n\nages\n\nAlways use numerals when referring to age. A 6-year-old girl; an 8-year-old law; the 7-year-old house. Use hyphens for ages expressed as adjectives before a noun or as substitutes for a noun. A 5-year-old boy, but the boy is 5 years old. The boy, 5, has a sister, 10. The race is for 3-year-olds. The woman is in her 30s. Thirty-something starts a sentence; otherwise, use 30-something.\n\nalma mater\n\nUSI's official alma mater, or school hymn, is entitled \"Constant, Faithful and True,\" and should be referred to as such in all references. \"Alma mater\" is acceptable on second and all following references. When listed in programs, the following should always be included: \"Text by David G. O’Neil. Music by Daniel R. Craig.\"\n\nalumni designation\n\nFor alumni designations use an apostrophe followed by the year of graduation for undergraduate degrees (ex. '99). For master's degrees use an M followed by an apostrophe and year of graduation (ex. M'15). For a doctorate, use a D followed by an apostrophe and year of graduation (ex. D'98). No commas before, after or between designations when using in a sentence. (ex. John Smith '99 M'15 led the charge...).\n\nalumnus, alumna, alumni\n\nAlumnus - singular male; alumna - singular female; alumni - generic plural\n\nampersands\n\nAmpersands (&) should not be used in place of the word \"and\" in department names. For example, Marketing and Communication is correct, not Marketing & Communication.\n\nassistant and associate\n\nIn titles, never abbreviate.\n\nB\n\nbaccalaureate\n\nThe generic term to describe all degree programs which culminate in a bachelor's degree.\n\nblack\n\nSee “race”.\n\nBoard of Trustees\n\nRefers to the University's governing body; individual members are trustees.\n\nbuilding names at USI\n\nThe use of correct names and consistent references helps maintain a strong institutional identity.

No comma is needed in September 1993, but two are needed in: He was born on February 11, 1945, in Charleston. Similarly, it is: He was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1935. Except for years, use a comma in all numbers exceeding three digits: 1,200 and 5,280. No comma is necessary to set off someone's graduating class: Sue Smith '81.\n\nD\n\ndates\n\nIt is December 8, not December 8th or December eighth. Avoid abbreviating, as in Feb. 3. (This differs from AP Style.) To specify a period of time: October 15-17, 1945-56. If \"from\" is used \"to\" must follow: He was a class agent from 1978 to 1986.

A ellipsis in the middle of a sentence should have a space on each side. (Ex. We went to the city … and arrived home after midnight.)

We went to the city and arrived home … .)\n\nemail\n\nEmail is not capitalized (unless at the beginning of a sentence) or hyphenated.\n\nemeritus, emerita, emeriti\n\nDescribes an individual retired from professional life but permitted to retain as an honorary title, the rank of the last office held -- professor emeritus; dean emeritus; female - emerita; female plural - emeritae; male or male and female plural - emeriti; professors emeriti\n\nF\n\nfraternities\n\nUnless circumstances rule otherwise, you can usually drop the word fraternity, sorority, or honorary after one is specified: Dan was a member of Sigma Tau.\n\nG\n\nH\n\nHarlaxton College\n\nOne of the study-abroad experiences for USI is in England at Harlaxton College.
