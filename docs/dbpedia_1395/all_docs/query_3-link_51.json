        "text": "Consult the Associated Press Stylebook for punctuation rules not outlined below.\n\napostrophe. No apostrophe in uppercase abbreviations (POWs, GEs, MAs, As and Bs. Use ’70s, not 70’s). Note direction of apostrophe when it precedes numerals such as a year or decade; to achieve ’ before\n\nnumerals, on a Mac, type shift/option/closed bracket (]), and on a PC, type Alt + 0146 (use the numeric keypad and not the top number row, which will not work for this command).\n\nPLURALS AND POSSESSIVES. In general, the possessive of most singular nouns is formed by adding an apostrophe and an s, and the possessive of most plural nouns by adding an apostrophe only.\n\nThe general rule applies to proper nouns (including names ending in x, z, or ce) as well as letters and numbers (Marx’s comedy, Gutierrez’s house, 2004’s rainfall record).\n\nFor singular proper names ending in s, add only an apostrophe (e.g., Achilles’ heel).\n\nExceptions to the general rule include nouns that are plural in form but singular in meaning, including place or organization names that are in plural form ending in s whose entity is singular (politics’ ultimate impact, the United States’ economy after World War II); words ending in an eez sound, and words and names ending in an unpronounced s (Descartes’ philosophy); and for . . . sake expressions when the noun ends in an s or an s sound (for goodness’ sake, for righteousness’ sake).\n\nTo indicate joint possession or closely linked proper names treated as a unit, use an apostrophe with the last noun only (Joe and Mary’s house). To show individual possession, make each noun possessive (Joe’s and Mary’s clothes were hung on the clothesline.). Apostrophes also imply of in the genitive case (an hour’s delay, in three days’ time). Consult the Associated Press Stylebook for other exceptions and guidelines.\n\nbrackets. Corrections, explanations, or comments within quoted material, or editor’s notes, should be bracketed (“People [here in Iraq] have the right to express themselves. That’s why I’m here.”). Brackets are also used as parentheses within parentheses: Writing courses (both in the humanities [four] and social sciences [three]) will be offered next year.\n\nbullets. Bulleted items that conclude an introductory sentence should be lowercased and punctuated with a comma or semicolon at the end of each item except for the last. Use the word and before the last bulleted item, and end the sentence with a period.\n\nExample:\n\nOn “extended studies” of three to four weeks, students and faculty members have:\n\n• studied the interaction of family, work, and public policy in Denmark;\n\n• examined the material culture of Rome and Pompeii; and\n\n• immersed themselves in New York City theater.\n\nBulleted items that are not part of an introductory sentence may be upper- or lowercase and may end with either periods or no punctuation. Format should be consistent within given context and within the publication.\n\nExample:\n\nColgate offers six cultural studies minors:\n\n• African studies\n\n• African American studies\n\n• Caribbean studies\n\n• Jewish studies\n\n• Middle Eastern and Islamic studies\n\n• Southeast Asian studies\n\nUsually there is a space between the bullet and the first word of each item.\n\ncolon. Introduces elements or a series of elements illustrating or amplifying what precedes the colon (Colgate has four divisions: humanities, natural sciences and mathematics, social sciences, and university studies.). The first word after a colon is lowercased, unless it is a proper name, it introduces a quotation, or the colon introduces two or more sentences (The program offers three things: training, counseling, and financial support. We hope to accomplish two goals: We need to get the word out about our program. We also have to raise enough money to cover two years’ worth of events. Joe had this to say: “He has had enough.”).\n\ncomma. Always use the serial comma; it prevents ambiguity. (We ate peas, ham, and macaroni and cheese.).\n\nUse a comma to separate independent clauses that are joined by and, but, for, or, nor, because, or so (The taxi never showed up, so we took a bus.).\n\nA dependent clause that precedes a main clause should be separated by a comma (If you don’t let go, I’m going to scream.).\n\nNonrestrictive words, abbreviations, phrases, or clauses in apposition to nouns (i.e., omittable, supplementary rather than essential) are set off by commas; if restrictive (i.e., essential to the noun), no commas should appear (He met his second wife, Mary, and her son John in Albuquerque [she has two sons]. They performed Neil Simon’s play Brighton Beach Memoirs last semester [Simon wrote several plays].).\n\nUsed in introductory words and phrases such as adverbial or participial phrases, especially if a slight pause is intended; a single word or very short phrase may not require a comma unless to avoid misreading (In June they established the new center. Before eating, the cat circled the dish. On the other hand, I didn’t care for that film. After the semester was over, they went home for a break. To Professor Hughes, teaching was the most enjoyable pastime.).\n\nA comma introduces brief quoted material (colons introduce long quotations). (He said, “Oh, my gosh, it’s great to see you!”)\n\ndash. There are two types of dashes. Neither is to be substituted with hyphens.\n\nem dash. Used either singly or in pairs, to set off an amplifying or explanatory element (Colgate’s four divisions — humanities, natural sciences and mathematics, social sciences, and university studies — work together to offer many interdisciplinary courses.). Type option-shift-hyphen or use the Symbol table under Insert in Microsoft Word. Surround em dashes with single spaces.\n\nen dash. Used in place of to, indicating continuing or inclusive numbers, such as dates, times, or reference numbers (1944–52, June–January, 9 a.m.–5 p.m. Jane Doe [1980–]). Type option-hyphen or use the Symbol table under Insert in Microsoft Word.\n\nIf the word from precedes the first element, use the word to instead of the en dash; similarly, if between precedes the first element, use and instead of the en dash. No spaces around en dashes.\n\nAlso used to link a city to a university with more than one campus or if one-half of a hyphenated term is a compound (University of California–Los Angeles; the small-animal–hospital emergency room; New York–area restaurants).\n\nellipses. Use three periods, surrounded by spaces (His voice trailed off . . . until he regained his composure.). If a sentence is broken across two pages, the ellipsis accompanies the first portion; do not add a second ellipsis. See the Associated Press Stylebook for other guidelines.\n\nIf an ellipsis precedes a period or other punctuation, attach the mark without leaving a space (He yelled, and then his voice trailed off . . ..).\n\nexclamation point. Should be avoided; rewrite a sentence to reflect emphasis. If used, exclamation points are placed inside quotation marks only when they are part of the quoted matter (“Put that down!”).\n\nhyphen, hyphenated words. The trend is away from hyphenation in current usage. Although hyphens can often be omitted in commonly used words, they should be used to prevent ambiguity (He recovered from illness. She re-covered the upholstered chair.).\n\nCompound nouns. Many compound nouns are hyphenated (sister-in-law, follow-up, one-half, well-being, 3-year-old, student-athlete).\n\nSome noun compounds are NOT hyphenated (day care, vice president).\n\nSome noun compounds are written as one word (campuswide, coursework, database, fundraising, horseback, lifelong, nationwide, online).\n\nCompound adjectives. Some compound adjectives are hyphenated (10-foot pole, 5-foot-3 inch–tall person, 18th-century poets, 250-pound foot locker, all-inclusive measures, blue-green water, cost-effective spending, low-level toxic waste, long-lived ancestors, matter-of-fact comment, problem-solving skills).\n\nSome compound adjectives are not hyphenated (eastern European countries, food service industry, health care plan).\n\nSome compound adjectives are written as one word (fivefold decrease, nonprofit agency, statewide budget cuts).\n\nAdverb-verb compounds. Hyphenated, but not when the adverb ends in ly (an ill-fated attempt, a thinly veiled disguise, a well-marked road).\n\nPrefixes. Words with prefixes carry a hyphen when the prefix stands alone (over- and understated, macro- and microeconomics). Words beginning with “co”: Retain the hyphen when forming nouns, adjectives, and verbs that indicate occupation or status. For example, co-founder, co-author, co-host, co-chair, co-owner, co-pilot, co-sponsor, co-signer, co-worker. Use no hyphen in other combinations: coeducation, cooperative, coordinate, coexist, copay.\n\nUse a hyphen between a prefix and a proper name (mid-Atlantic, pre-Colgate, pro-Kmart).\n\nCapitalization. When hyphenated words appear in titles, capitalize both words (Fifteenth-Century Dynasty, High-Level Meetings).\n\nparentheses. Use parentheses to include useful information for the reader: James began his run up High Street (he liked to warm up with a steep incline) and headed out toward the boardwalk.\n\nUse parentheses to enclose numbers or letters that denote items in a list: The agenda will include (1) brainstorming, (2) ice-breaker exercises, and (3) lunch.\n\nPunctuation: Place the period outside the closing parenthesis if the material inside is not a complete sentence (such as this fragment).\n\nA complete sentence within parentheses that does not stand within another sentence has the end punctuation before the closing parenthesis: And then he ate. (He was famished.)\n\nperiod. Single space, not double space, after periods (likewise with colons and semicolons).\n\nWhen a URL or an email address ends the sentence, use a period.\n\nquotation marks. Quotation marks are used to enclose a direct quotation and titles of short works such as articles, songs, poems, and lectures (see titles [of original works or similar] for more).\n\nWhether single or double, closing quotation marks follow a period or comma, and precede a colon or semicolon (“Let’s go,” he said. She sang “America”; he applauded.).\n\nA dash, question mark, or exclamation point falls within the quotation marks when they refer only to the quoted matter; they fall outside when they refer to the whole sentence (“You’ve got to be kidding!” he exclaimed. How many times are you going to say “I don’t know”?).\n\nUse single quotes within double quotes (The man said, “I heard her say, ‘Don’t do it!’ and then I left.”)\n\nWhen a quotation is longer than one paragraph, use quotation marks at the beginning of each paragraph but only at the end of the last paragraph.\n\nWhen preparing a manuscript in Microsoft Word, take care to note that the “smart quotes” function is turned on in order to enable “curly quotes.”\n\nsemicolon. Use a semicolon when you want to tie together two main clauses rather than keeping them as two sentences (It was really hot today; we ate ice cream.).\n\nUse when element(s) in a series involves internal commas (Always consult a doctor when you have a fever, blisters, or severe headache; have a history of high blood pressure in your family; or if the pain persists for more than two days.).\n\nUse a semicolon to link independent clauses connected by consequently, however, moreover, nevertheless, otherwise, and therefore (I would like to leave at 3 p.m. today; therefore, I plan to work through my lunch hour to make up the time. He planned to go to the concert; however, he had a flat tire and missed it entirely.).\n\nspecial formatting/typographic matters. Use one space, not two, following any mark of punctuation that ends a sentence, whether a period, question mark, exclamation point, or closing quotation marks.\n\nAll punctuation marks should appear in the same font (roman or italic) as the main or surrounding text, except for punctuation that belongs to a title or an exclamation in a different font (The book is titled The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, but everyone knows it as just Huckleberry Finn. Willa Cather’s O Pioneers! was a favorite in my class.).\n\nacademic degrees. Use apostrophes in bachelor’s degree, master’s, etc., but no apostrophe with bachelor of arts or master of arts in teaching. Lowercase degrees, including disciplines, except for proper nouns (master’s degree in English literature, master of arts in teaching degree). Simply master’s or bachelor’s (without degree) is acceptable.\n\nNo periods in abbreviations MAT, MA, MS, AB, PhD, etc. Avoid redundancies such as Dr. John Smith, MD.\n\nThe undergraduate degree awarded by Colgate is officially an artium baccalaureus. For editorial purposes, the communications office uses the vernacular: bachelor’s degree, bachelor of arts, or BA.\n\nacademic leave of absence (lowercase)\n\nacademic titles. See titles (of persons).\n\naccessibility. Use the terms “accessible parking” and “accessible elevators” rather than handicapped. See also disabilities.\n\nacronyms. Well-known acronyms (NFL, NASA) can be used on first reference, and periods are not necessary. On first reference, spell out institutional acronyms that may be unfamiliar to the audience (the Center for Outreach, Volunteerism, and Education, rather than the COVE), put the acronym in parentheses, and then use the acronym throughout.\n\nadministrative titles. See titles (of persons).\n\nadmission(s). At Colgate, the department is referred to in the singular case (admission office), but use “college admissions” when talking about the concept in general.\n\nadviser. Not advisor, unless it is spelled that way as part of a person’s official title.\n\naffect, effect. Affect is a verb meaning “to influence” or “to make an impact upon” (Exposure to sun affects your skin.). Effect is a noun; otherwise, as a verb, it means “to bring about or to execute” (We measured the effects of sun on skin. He was hired to effect change in the department.).\n\nAfrican American. No hyphen for either the noun or the adjective.\n\nages. Always use numerals.\n\nalma mater. Lowercase, no italics, both when referring to Colgate as the school from which one has graduated or the song.\n\nalumni. Use alumnus for an individual who identifies as male, alumna for an individual who identifies as female, alumni for a group of male-identifying people, alumnae for a group of female-identifying people. Use alumni when referring to a group composed of men and women (never “alumni/ae”). The gender-neutral term is graduate.\n\nYou should not use alum or alums in writing because they are colloquial terms; use only in informal direct quotations and when the meaning is clear (because alum is also a type of chemical compound).\n\nWhen appropriate, consider using the alternative graduate to reduce repetition.\n\nNote: It is preferable to always identify alumni with the class year in publications. Anyone who has attended Colgate for at least one semester is considered an alumna or alumnus, regardless of whether or not the individual actually graduated from Colgate.\n\nAlumni Council. Formally called the Alumni Corporation Board of Directors in its bylaws and tax filings, but more commonly referred to as the Alumni Council. The acronym ACBOD is no longer used.\n\nAlumni Memorial Scholars program\n\nalumni names and class years. See class years.\n\nAlumni of Color organization (can be abbreviated as AOC after first reference)\n\na.m. TIME: Lowercase, with periods (not AM or am). For more on time style, see time. RADIO: Use FM and AM (WRCU 90.1 FM).\n\nAmerican Indian. No hyphen. Native American is also acceptable; however, while some use the terms interchangeably, others prefer one over the other. In many cases, the tribal affiliation is the most appropriate term.\n\nampersand. Use only when it is an official part of a name or title (AT&T, Simon & Schuster). Never use in body copy in place of and.\n\nand/or. Avoid this construction; rephrase instead.\n\nannual. An event cannot be described as annual until it has been held for at least two successive years (RIGHT: We held the first Colgate Arts! Festival in 2005 and hope it becomes an annual event. WRONG: He attended the first annual Madison County Hopfest.).\n\nannual fund. Lowercase in general references; the University’s official program name is the Colgate Annual Fund. (The campaign will boost contributions to the annual fund. He gave a gift to the Colgate Annual Fund.)\n\nanti-racism. Hyphenated and lowercase, per AP style.\n\napostrophe. See punctuation section.\n\narchaeology/archaeologist. Not archeology/archeologist.\n\nartist-in-residence. Hyphenate before a name and when part of a formal title. (Kenny Barron served as the Christian A. Johnson Endeavor Foundation artist-in-residence. We talked to artist-in-residence Jean Smith.) After a name or in generic references, no hyphen. (Colgate sponsors several artists in residence each year.)\n\nas/like. As is a conjunction linking two clauses (Do as I do.); like is a preposition introducing a comparison (My house is like a barn.). “As” is not a substitute for “because” or “for example” (RIGHT: I missed the dinner dance because I was sick. WRONG: I missed the dinner dance, as I was sick.).\n\nAsian American. No hyphen for either the noun or the adjective.\n\nAsian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The acronym AAPI is widely used by people within these communities. Spell out the full term on first reference and abbreviate on subsequent references.\n\nassure, ensure, insure. Assure means “to inform with the intent of removing doubt.” Ensure means “to guarantee.” Insure means “to establish a contract for insurance.”\n\nathletics. Colgate athletics teams are known as Raiders; athletes who identify as female are not called Lady Raiders. It is the Department of Athletics or athletics department, not the athletic department. Also see sports.\n\nathletics facilities. See buildings and sites.\n\nAthletics Hall of Honor. Recognizes extraordinary alumni athletes.\n\nattribution. Attribute statements that are not widely known or that are a matter of opinion and subject to disagreement (Twenty-five percent of Colgate’s annual expenditure on financial aid is drawn from the endowment, according to a recent report.). Also see “said, says.”\n\ncampuswide\n\ncapitalization. When in doubt, use lowercase. In addition to grammatical correctness and style, the idea is to make text easy on the eyes for your reader. Capitalize proper nouns, not generic words that refer to proper nouns. In specific instances, the communications office publication designers might employ all capital letters or initial caps for typographical reasons at their discretion.\n\nFor a particular word or phrase, if there is no listing in this style guide, consult the Associated Press Stylebook or the Merriam-Webster dictionary.\n\nDo not capitalize Colgate majors, minors, divisions, departments, or offices unless as a typographic style in list copy or when referring to an official title (He is a biology major. Division of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, Office of Admission, Department of English and Creative Writing; but natural sciences division, admission office, English and creative writing department).\n\nNames of formal committees are capitalized, but general references to committees are not (He is a member of the Alumni Council Nominations Committee. I am on the marketing committee to advertise that program.).\n\nLowercase common words such as college, university, or state when listing several institutions with the same designation (We visited Colgate, Bucknell, and Lehigh universities. Both New York and Washington states passed an increased budget this year.).\n\ncaptions (photo). Requires a period if caption is a full sentence, no period if a sentence fragment (Katy Graf ’06 wanders through the rooms in a residential dwelling in Pompeii. Selling organic produce at the Hamilton Farmer’s Market).\n\nA good caption will enhance and clarify that which is not immediately apparent in the photo. In some cases, simply the name of the individual shown will suffice; use no period after a name line.\n\nCareer Services\n\ncatalog. This is the preferred spelling in American English. Do not use “catalogue.”\n\nCenter for Freedom and Western Civilization\n\nCenter for Language and Brain\n\nCenter for Learning, Teaching, and Research\n\nCenter for Outreach, Volunteerism, and Education (COVE). Formally called the Max A. Shacknai Center for Outreach, Volunteerism, and Education.\n\nCenter for Women’s Studies\n\ncentral New York (note lowercase c)\n\ncentury, centuries. See numbers.\n\nchair, chairman, chairperson. Chair is used both as a verb and a noun and is widely regarded as the best gender-neutral choice (He chaired the meeting. The chair recognizes the legislator. Susan Jones, chair of the admission committee.).\n\nYou may, however, use chairman or chairwoman with specific references when the gender of the person is clear, or according to the preference of the person to whom you are referring. For an explanation of proper usage of chair in vs. professor of, see ACADEMIC TITLES under titles (of persons).\n\nchapel. Lowercase unless using the official name of the building, Colgate Memorial Chapel.\n\ncity, state. Place one comma between the city and state name, and another comma after the state name, unless ending a sentence or indicating a dateline (He traveled to Nashville, Tenn., from Syracuse, N.Y.).\n\ncivil rights, civil rights movement (lowercase)\n\nClass of. When referring to a specific class, capitalize (He is a member of the Class of 1999.). Lowercase when using multiple years (the classes of 1970, 1975, and 1980).\n\nclass years. To denote class year on a graduate’s name, use John Jones ’89 (no comma between name and year).\n\nKeyboard command: To achieve an outward-facing apostrophe before class year numerals, on a Mac, use shift/option/apostrophe; on a PC, use control/shift/apostrophe.\n\nIf someone graduated from a class year for which the first two numbers need to be specified in order to eliminate confusion about the century (1925 vs. 2025), use the full year and add “Class of” beforehand. (RIGHT: John Smith, Class of 1925; Sam Jones ’25 [for the Class of 2025]).\n\nFor Colgate couples, place the class years adjacent to the names: Sam ’01 and Amy (Smith) ’03 Jones came to the reunion.\n\nFor Colgate couples who are parents, put their class years after their first names and their parental designations after their last name: Bob ’80 and Sylvia ’81 Smith P’11,’20.\n\nFor grandparents, add GP and the student(s) class year(s) (Bob Smith GP’17, Bob Smith GP’17,’19).\n\nFor honorary degree recipients, use James Jones H’95 (no space between H and the apostrophe).\n\nFor master’s degree recipients, use Eric Brown MA’88, Jenny Jones MAT’99 (no space between degree and the apostrophe).\n\nFor parental designation, add a P with the student(s) class year(s). Separate multiple student class years with commas (Bob Smith ’79, P’08,’09,’12).\n\nIf a person has a Colgate degree, an honorary degree, and is a parent, keep the person’s degrees together and then list parental designation (Bob Smith ’80, H’07, P’10).\n\nPossessives: Find a way to rephrase to avoid making the class year possessive (RIGHT: We found the dog belonging to John Jones ’89 running around. WRONG: We found John Smith ’89’s dog running around.).\n\nclassics, classical. See also historical periods.\n\nco-author, co-chair, co-wrote See more in punctuation section.\n\ncoed (coeducational). Don’t use coed as a noun (use female student); coed may be used as an adjective (He chose to live in coed housing.).\n\nColgate Magazine, the. The official magazine of Colgate University.\n\nColgate Maroon-News, the. Colgate’s student newspaper. Use the Maroon-News on second reference. For those composing obituaries, note the following in order to accurately specify a person’s involvement: From 1968 to 1991, there were two student papers, the Colgate Maroon (founded 1916) and the Colgate News; the two merged in 1992.\n\nColgate University. Use Colgate or the University on second reference. It is preferable on second reference to refer to Colgate as “the University” rather than “the college.”\n\nColgate University Catalog\n\ncommas. Use the serial (Oxford) comma before “and” as well as “or” in a series to ensure clarity (Joe ate peas, ham, and bread. Jen went swimming with the divers, Sam, and Ed [to make clear that Sam and Ed are not the divers, but rather, joined Jen and a group of divers]). Likewise, for the final in a series separated by semicolons, the last two elements should be separated by a semicolon (Carmella, Meadow, and AJ Soprano; Oscar, Lucille, and Buster Bluth; and Michael, Kay, and Don Corleone met at the restaurant.). See also thepunctuation section.\n\ncommencement. Lowercase, except when referring to a specific event (He celebrated his commencement in 1988. We attended Commencement 2003.).\n\ncommittees. Names of formal committees are capitalized, but general references to committees are not (He is a member of the Alumni Council Nominations Committee. I am on the marketing committee to advertise that program.).\n\ncommons, the. See Residential Commons.\n\ncommunity leader. On second reference, abbreviate to CL. This is a student residential life position; serves as a mentor and resource in student residences (akin to an RA).\n\ncompose, comprise, constitute. These terms are not interchangeable. Compose means to create or put together. It can be used in both the active and passive voice. (Johnny Marks ’31 composed “Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.” That yarn is composed of merino wool, silk, and linen.) Comprise means “to contain, include all, or embrace” and is best used only in the active voice; the whole comprises its parts. Not to be used with of (This nation comprises 50 states.). Constitute is often the best choice when neither compose nor comprise seems to fit (Six girls and five boys constitute the soccer team.).\n\ncomputer terms\n\nblog\n\ndatabase\n\ndot-com\n\nemail\n\nhomepage\n\ninbox\n\ninternet\n\nListserv. Capitalize this trademarked name.\n\nlogin, logon, logoff. As a verb, use two-word form (log in to a network, log on to a computer).\n\noffline, online\n\npodcast\n\nportal\n\nweb, website, webcam, webcast, webpage\n\nWhen listing web addresses in print materials, it is not necessary to include http and/or www. (e.g., Colgate.edu).\n\nconcentration. The official term is major at Colgate (Colgate offers a range of majors. He is an English major.). For a complete list, see colgate.edu/majors.\n\nLowercase the names of majors except for proper nouns and where initial caps are used for design/typographical convention in list form (environmental biology, English, Romance languages and literatures).\n\nconference titles. Full official names of conferences and symposia should be capitalized (1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development). Don’t treat appendages such as “annual meeting” as part of titles; lowercase them (27th annual Alumni Council meeting).\n\nCore. When referring to the Liberal Arts Core Curriculum, capitalize both Core and Core Curriculum.\n\ncourse titles. Use roman type with initial caps; no quotation marks or italics necessary (As a junior, he took Religion 332: Contemporary Religious Thought.).\n\ncoursework\n\nCOVID-19. All uppercase as indicated; variants are lowercase (e.g., delta, omicron). See also endemic, epidemic, pandemic.\n\ncredits (academic). The term credit hours is redundant; use credits.\n\ncredits (photo). If supplying photographs to the Office of University Communications for a publication or webpage, please be sure to supply the name of the photographer.\n\ncum laude. Italicized but lowercased.\n\nnames. In general, follow the Associated Press Stylebook guidelines unless otherwise indicated.\n\nALUMNI NAMES. Always list the year of graduation with alumni names (John Jones ’89). See also MAIDEN NAMES in this entry.\n\nDIVISIONS, DEPARTMENTS, OFFICES, AND PROGRAMS. Uppercase when using the formal name (the Division of Natural Sciences and Mathematics). Lowercase informal names (natural sciences division).\n\nFACULTY NAMES: Use Professor, not Doctor, when preceding a faculty member’s name. Dr. is meant only for individuals who hold a medical degree; drop Dr. after the first reference. Also, drop Dr. if the degree is used (Dr. John Smith; John Smith, MD).\n\nINDIVIDUALS. Use the last name only without a modifier on second reference (Provost and Dean of the Faculty Jane Smith announced a new plan on Tuesday. The plan, Smith says, would be implemented in June.). Look up names (and professional titles) of faculty and staff members at colgate.edu/directory; however, academic or professional titles should always be verified with the person or department.\n\nINITIALS. No space between two initials (H.L. Mencken).\n\nJR., II, ETC. Not preceded or followed by a comma (John Jones Jr.; Eric Brown II).\n\nMAIDEN NAMES. Use of maiden names to identify married women can take several different forms, depending upon individual preferences. For a Colgate alumna who has taken her husband’s name, insert the name under which she was known as a student in parentheses: known as Colleen Jones as a student, and now married, refer to her as Colleen (Jones) ’92 Batcher.\n\nA married woman who retains her maiden name should always be identified as such: Kyra Sedgwick (whose husband is Kevin Bacon) is not referred to as Mrs. Kyra Bacon or Mrs. Kevin Bacon.\n\nNICKNAMES. Should be contained within quotation marks (Joe “Bubba” Smith). A nickname should only be used in place of a person’s name when it is the way the individual prefers to be known (Jimmy Carter).\n\nSTATE NAMES. The names of states, territories, and possessions of the United States should always be given in full when standing alone or on first reference. With city-state constructions, use standard abbreviations as in states.\n\nNative American. No hyphen.
