        "text": "Use Associated Press (AP) Style when writing for all university publicity and materials. These include, but are not limited to:\n\nBusiness cards and letterhead\n\nNews releases\n\nNews and feature stories\n\nMagazines, brochures and newsletters\n\nPosters, flyers, postcards and other mailers\n\nThe ASU website and other digital media\n\nThis complies with the Texas Tech University System’s official writing guidelines and differs from the academic writing styles.\n\nFor your convenience, we created this abbreviated AP Style guide. The economy of space and ease of reading make AP Style ideal for university publications.\n\nWhen Not To Use This Style Guide\n\nIn certain instances, however, the journalistic qualities of AP Style may not be appropriate. Correspondence may follow a different style as long as it is consistent within the document. When writing for a specific discipline or journal, it is appropriate to use that discipline’s preferred style manual.\n\nOne Final Note\n\nBefore submitting copy for publication, writers and editors should read copy for accuracy and check thoroughly for errors in spelling, grammar, syntax and punctuation. Remember, spell-check options will check only for correct spelling of a word; the program does not check for proper use of a word. It is expensive to correct errors in later stages of production.\n\nAcademic Degrees\n\n“Dr.” is an appropriate title for the holder of a doctoral degree. Degrees are not commonly used after a person’s name in text but may be used in printed and web listings, directories, bulletins or catalogs at the discretion of the editor. The person’s specialty should be stated in the first or second reference. Using the last name alone is acceptable after the first reference. For example:\n\nDr. Howard Small will lecture to the class. Small is an associate professor in the Department of English at the University of Tulsa.\n\nDr. Keith Edwards, a professor of genetics, will lecture on the Angelo State University campus tonight. Edwards will answer questions after his lecture.\n\nHolders of honorary degrees do not receive the title.\n\nFaculty in Healthcare Fields\n\nYou may use initials after a health professional’s full name to designate the appropriate degree and/or certification, such as Ph.D., RN, M.S.N., Ed.D., etc. The person’s title should follow on the first reference. Using the last name alone is acceptable after the first reference. For example:\n\nShelly Weise, Ed.D., PT, professor of physical therapy, said the appointment reflects the excellence of the Angelo State faculty.\n\nThe Texas Nurses Association has named Susan Wilkinson, Ph.D., RN, professor of nursing, as its Nurse of the Year.\n\nCertifications\n\nAvoid certifications following a name, particularly if they are vague to the general public. “While Jim Smith, RN,” is acceptable for instance, “Jane Sims, FNC,” is not because the certification is not generally recognized outside the healthcare profession. However, if the certification is a pertinent part of the information, then include it by writing out the certification. For example, instead of writing Alexia Green, RN, Ph.D., FAAN, write Alexia Green, PH.D., RN, is also a fellow in the American Academy of Nursing.\n\nNo more than two titles should be used after a name.\n\nInstitutional Titles\n\nCapitalize a formal title when it precedes a name, but do not capitalize when it follows a name. For example:\n\nPresident Ronnie Hawkins Jr.\n\nRonnie Hawkins Jr., president\n\n“Professor” may be used as a formal title when a person holds that distinction. When the title precedes a proper name, it is capitalized and never abbreviated. When “professor” follows a proper name, it is preceded by appropriate rank, i.e., “assistant” or “associate” and is not capitalized.\n\nCourtesy Titles\n\nAvoid social or courtesy titles, such as “Mr., “Mrs.,” “Miss” and “Ms.” On second reference, refer to people, men and women, by their last names only.\n\nIn cases of sensitive development publications, if a courtesy title is used, always use the individual’s preference. Avoiding social titles can help lessen chances for sexism in writing. You may use courtesy titles for clarification in text referring to both spouses or to parents and their children.\n\nGroup Designation\n\n“Faculty” and “staff” are collective nouns that may be used in the singular or in the plural. Whether the writer chooses singular or plural, antecedents should agree.\n\nAvoid abbreviations in publications wherever possible. Do not abbreviate the name of a school, college, department or office.\n\nYou may abbreviate the name of a center, institute or organization if the abbreviation or acronym follows in parentheses after the first or second reference.\n\nYou may use abbreviations in news releases, catalogs and bulletins as long as the abbreviations are understood by the general public or listed in parenthesis after the first or second reference.\n\nNames of States\n\nIn press releases and most other text, use the following style when state names follow a city name:\n\nAla.\n\nAlaska\n\nAriz.\n\nArk.\n\nCalif.\n\nColo.\n\nConn.\n\nDel.\n\nFla.\n\nGa.\n\nHawaii\n\nIdaho\n\nIll.\n\nInd.\n\nIowa\n\nKan.\n\nKy.\n\nLa.\n\nMaine\n\nMass.\n\nMd.\n\nMich.\n\nMinn.\n\nMiss.\n\nMo.\n\nMont.\n\nN.C.\n\nN.D.\n\nN.H.\n\nN.J.\n\nN.M.\n\nN.Y.\n\nNeb.\n\nNev.\n\nOhio\n\nOkla.\n\nOre.\n\nPa.\n\nR.I.\n\nS.C.\n\nS.D.\n\nTenn.\n\nTexas\n\nUtah\n\nVa.\n\nVt.\n\nW.Va.\n\nWash.\n\nWis.\n\nWyo.\n\nUse the two-letter Postal Service abbreviation when providing a full mailing address in text or in a press release.\n\nAddresses\n\nUse the abbreviations “Ave.,” “Blvd.” and “St.” only with a numbered address. Spell out when part of the formal name of the street.\n\n1620 University Ave.\n\n2602 W. Avenue N\n\nUniversity Avenue\n\nAlways completely spell out similar street names, such as “alley,” “drive,” “road,” “circle,” etc. Capitalize when part of a formal street name and lowercase when used alone or with more than one street name.\n\n2602 Dena Drive\n\nDena Drive\n\nintersection of Dena and Varsity drives\n\nAbbreviate compass points used to indicate direction in a numbered address. Do not abbreviate if the number is omitted.\n\n222 E. 42nd St.\n\n2025 S. Johnson St.\n\nEast 42nd Street\n\nSouth Johnson Street\n\nUse periods in the abbreviation P.O. for post office box numbers.\n\nMonths\n\nSpell out the names of months in text material when they stand alone.\n\nUse these abbreviations when providing a date, as in Jan. 13.\n\nJan.\n\nFeb.\n\nMarch\n\nApril\n\nMay\n\nJune\n\nJuly\n\nAug.\n\nSept.\n\nOct.\n\nNov.\n\nDec.\n\nBusinesses\n\nUse “Co.,” “Cos.,” “Corp.” or “Inc.” for businesses that use “Company,” “Companies,” “Corporation” or “Incorporated” after their names.\n\nSpell out the word if it falls within a business name, for example, “Aluminum Company of America.”\n\nTime of Day\n\nFor times, use “a.m.” and “p.m.” with the hour.\n\nUse “noon” instead of “12 p.m.”\n\nUse “midnight” instead of “12 a.m.”\n\nDo not use “12 noon” or “12 midnight” as these terms are redundant.\n\nTitles\n\nUse lower case for professional titles unless they immediately precede a name. When a person is identified strictly by title on second or subsequent references, the title is not capitalized. For example,\n\nRonnie Hawkins, president, spoke Friday.\n\nPresident Ronnie Hawkins awarded staff excellence awards Monday.\n\nThe president spoke to the Belles after the team’s win.\n\nDegrees\n\nCapitalize academic degrees as follows:\n\nMBA, M.S., M.A., M.S.N., B.S., B.A.\n\nInclude the periods except for MBA.\n\nUse these abbreviations only after a complete name. Do not use with only a last name.\n\nIn news releases, limit designations to only two degrees.\n\nDo not capitalize generic terms for degrees, for example: “doctoral degree” or “doctorate,” “master’s degree,” “bachelor’s degree.” If you are using the formal name of a degree, it is capitalized, for example: he earned a Master of Science degree from Angelo State University.\n\nAcademic Subjects\n\nAvoid capitalizing an academic subject when it is used as a general field of study. Capitalize academic subjects when they are part of the official title of a university entity, when they are the name of a language, and when they are the official title of a course or a short title that includes the course number. For example:\n\n“The College of Science and Engineering offers programs in agriculture, biology, chemistry and biochemistry, computer science, engineering, geoscience, mathematics and physics.”\n\nShe majored in physics and minored in Russian.\n\nDepartment of Physics and Geosciences\n\nDepartment of English\n\nGender Studies Program\n\nHe teaches Sociology 3350.\n\nBuildings, Rooms and Room Numbers\n\nCapitalize “building” if it is an integral part of the building’s name. Do not abbreviate.\n\nMayer Administration Building\n\nVincent Building\n\nCapitalize the names of specially designated rooms. Capitalize the word “room” when used in conjunction with a room number.\n\nNasworthy Suite\n\nTucker Room\n\nRassman Building, Room 205\n\nWhen promoting an event, the preferred order to refer to the details is time, date and place. For example:\n\nThe barbecue will be at noon Oct. 20 at the Super Slab.\n\nOther University-Related Uses\n\nCapitalize “institute,” “center,” “program,” “division” or “office” when it is part of the formal name, but not when used alone or informally. For example:\n\nThe Center for Cyber Intelligence, Innovation, and Security Studies is a sponsor.\n\nThe center is named for former U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison.\n\nIt is appropriate to refer to a center, institute, program, division or office by the appropriate designation, in lower case letters, on subsequent references. For example:\n\nThe Management, Instruction and Research Center received a major grant today. The center will use the money for a new project.\n\nAvoid capitalizing such words as “freshman,” “senior” or “graduate” when the words refer to a stage of study or the classification of a student rather than to the group. For example:\n\nShe was a freshman, majoring in agricultural communications.\n\nAP style does not require capital letters when referring to a website, but references to the World Wide Web still require capitalization.\n\nwebsite\n\nthe web\n\nwebpage\n\nGovernment\n\nAvoid capitalizing the words “city,” “government,” “federal” or “state.” For example:\n\nUnited States government\n\nfederal government\n\nthe state legislature\n\nTexas Legislature\n\nthe state of Texas, unless referring to the state government, then State is capitalized\n\nthe city of San Angelo, unless referring to the city government, then City is capitalized\n\nCapitalize the formal names of federal or state agencies. For example:\n\nU.S. Department of Defense\n\nTexas Department of Agriculture\n\nSeasons and Location\n\nUse lower case for seasons. For example:\n\nTransfer students may begin studies in the spring, summer or fall.\n\nThe spring semester begins Wednesday.\n\nCapitalize “west” and other compass points when referring to a region: For example:\n\nIn architecture and lifestyle, Angelo State University reflects the American West.\n\nThe people of West Texas were determined to have their own university.\n\nUse lower case for compass points when indicating a direction. For example:\n\nMany students travel west to the recreation areas of New Mexico.\n\nRacial and Ethnic\n\nCapitalize the proper names of nationalities, peoples, races and tribes. For example:\n\nAfrican American\n\nArab\n\nArabic\n\nAsian\n\nCaucasian\n\nCherokee\n\nChinese Eskimo\n\nHispanic\n\nJapanese\n\nJewish\n\nLakota\n\nLatin American\n\nNative American\n\nGeneral Use\n\nSpell out numbers one through nine and first through ninth. Use figures for numbers 10 and greater. Also use figures to refer to a numerical ranking, a unit of scientific measurement, a percentage or a unit of money. For example:\n\nTwo\n\n300\n\nNo. 1\n\n10\n\n5%\n\n10th\n\n1,040\n\n45 kg\n\n$5 million\n\n7 degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit\n\nTreat numbers consistently within a category. For example:\n\n“Angelo State awarded 352 bachelor’s degrees, 57 master’s degrees and 2 honorary degrees.”\n\nAddresses\n\nAlways use figures for an address number.\n\n1310 Cherrywood Terrace\n\nSpell out and capitalize First through Ninth when used as street names. Use figures with two letters for 10th and above.\n\n1435 Fifth Ave.\n\nFirst Street\n\nTelephone Numbers\n\nHyphens should be used between numbers. Parentheses should not be used around area codes or for international numbers.\n\n325-942-2248\n\n44-22-7353-2545\n\n1-800-555-1212\n\nIf extension numbers are given, use a comma to separate the main number from the extension.\n\n325-942-2385, ext. 504.\n\nStarting a Sentence\n\nAlways spell out a number at the beginning of a sentence. A better approach is to rewrite the sentence to avoid using a number at the beginning. For example:\n\nINSTEAD OF: One hundred and eighty five marketing majors are included in Angelo State University’s total enrollment of 6,000.\n\nTRY: Of Angelo State’s total enrollment of 6,000 students, 185 are marketing majors.\n\nPercentages, Fractions, Large Numbers\n\nUse numerals for percentages and the percent symbol. For example:\n\n90%\n\n3%\n\nSpell out fractions in text material. Hyphenate fractions when they are used as adjectives or adverbs. For example:\n\nThe book is three-fourths complete.\n\nHowever, use figures to express mixed numbers. Include a space between the whole number and the fraction. For example:\n\n2 3/4\n\n5 3/8\n\nUse a comma in numerals of 1,000 and above except for temperatures, years, street addresses, broadcast frequencies, room numbers, serial numbers and telephone numbers.\n\n2,354\n\n3818 degrees Celsius\n\n2000 B.C.\n\n325-942-2248\n\nPhone Numbers\n\nUse hyphens, not parentheses or periods, to separate area code, prefix and the last four digits. Example: 325-942-2555\n\nSerial Comma\n\nA comma is not required before “and” or “or” in a series of three or more items unless it improves clarity. For example:\n\nRequired courses include English, history and economics.\n\nWomen’s sports now include basketball, softball, golf, track and soccer.\n\nWill you take your tests on Monday, Tuesday or Thursday?\n\nThe departments of Physics, Biology, Chemistry and Biochemistry, and Physical Therapy will have representatives at the job fair.\n\nCommas and Multiple Adjectives\n\nUse a comma to separate two or more adjectives equal in rank preceding a noun. For example:\n\nThe summer was a long, hot season. (equal)\n\nShe wore a cheap wool coat. (unequal)\n\nCommas in Dates\n\nUse commas in full dates, but not between month and year or season and year. A comma also should follow the year when used with a month and day in the middle of a sentence. For example:\n\nThe building was completed in July 2004.\n\nHe was on sabbatical during summer 2001.\n\nNov. 22, 1963\n\nJune 6, 1944, was D-Day.\n\nCommas in Names\n\nAssociated Press style eliminates a comma after a name and before “Jr.” or “Sr.” or a name and a numeral. For example:\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller III\n\nIn addition, eliminate a comma before Inc. or Ltd., even if it is included in a company’s formal name. For example:\n\nAT&T Inc.\n\nBHP Billiton Ltd.\n\nSemicolons in a Series\n\nUse semicolons for clarity in long lists. The semicolon is used before “and” or “or” in a series.\n\nThe Norris-Vincent College of Business includes the Departments of Accounting, Economics and Finance; Aerospace Studies; Computer Science; and Management and Marketing.\n\nHyphenation\n\nHyphenate compound words used as adjectives, but not those that include an adverb ending in –ly. For example:\n\nASU’s student-athlete participation in community events has always been a priority.\n\nStudents need high-tech skills.\n\nApostrophe for Possession\n\nUse the apostrophe to indicate possession. Note, however, that “its” is a possessive pronoun that lacks an apostrophe. “It’s” is a contraction of “it is.”\n\nApostrophe for Plurals\n\nWhen words designate a word, do not use ’s (apostrophe s) to indicate plural. For example:\n\nNo ‘ifs,’ ‘ands’ or ‘buts.’\n\nPlurals of figures add an s not an ’s (apostrophe s). For example:\n\n1920s\n\n727s\n\nlow 20s\n\nFor plurals of single letters, use ’s: For example:\n\nMind your p’s and q’s\n\nThree R’s\n\nFour A’s and a B\n\nFor plurals of multiple letters, including acronyms, add s. For example:\n\nABCs\n\nIOUs\n\nVIPs\n\nComposition Titles\n\nEnclose composition titles in quotation marks rather than italicizing, according to Associated Press style. Composition titles are: the names of books, movies, operas, plays, poems, songs, television programs, lectures, speeches, works of art, etc.\n\nQuotation Marks\n\nDo not use quotation marks, bold font or italics casually and only rarely for emphasis. Commas, periods, question marks, bold font, underline or italics and exclamation points always go within quotation marks.\n\nExclamation Marks\n\nAvoid exclamation marks for emphasis. Use them only sparingly for emotion or a strong feeling.\n\nThe following words have more than one spelling. These are preferred versions:\n\nacknowledgment\n\njudgment\n\npercent\n\ncounselor\n\ncatalog\n\nemail\n\nFor publications, the names of companies and corporations that support Angelo State programs should be spelled and punctuated as they appear on their letterhead or corporate statements. For example:\n\nE.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. Inc.\n\nAvoid redundancies. For example:\n\nINSTEAD OF: most unique.\n\nUSE: unique\n\nAvoid passive voice. For example:\n\nINSTEAD OF: The increase in salaries was approved by the regents.\n\nTRY: The regents approved the increase in salaries.\n\nAvoid beginning sentences with “There are” and “It is.”\n\nIn formal writing, avoid first person (I, we) and second person (you).\n\nIn less formal documents, first and second person sometimes may be used to create a more personal tone.\n\nAlumni\n\nThe word “alumni” is plural and should be used when referring to multiple men or a group of men and women who have attended a school or university. The singular form of the word is “alumnus” when referring to a man and “alumna” when referring to a woman. If referring to a group of women, use the plural form “alumnae.”\n\nLocations in Texas\n\nWhen referring to a city within Texas, it is unnecessary to list the state after the city unless it is important for clarification. Cities outside the state of Texas should be followed by the state name unless the city is so well known as to be identifiable in its own right: Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Miami, St. Louis, Minneapolis, etc.\n\nThe residents of Athens, Texas, claim their town as the birthplace of the hamburger.\n\nThe conference will be held at the University of North Texas in Denton.\n\nThe Rams and Belles will be traveling to Durant, Okla., next weekend.\n\nASU students traveled to New Orleans last week to join in the relief efforts.\n\nEqual Opportunity/Affirmative Action Language\n\nIt is recommended that letterhead and publications, where appropriate, from Angelo State University should include some form of Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action statement.\n\nAt a minimum, letterhead should use: “Equal Opportunity Employer.”\n\nTerminology\n\nRe-read copy carefully to avoid racist, sexist or insensitive implications.\n\n“Handicapped,” “disabled” and “impaired” should be used carefully and only when clearly pertinent and appropriate for your material. Keep in mind the following meanings and choices:\n\nDisabled is a term describing an individual’s ability to do something independently.\n\nImpaired implies difficulties in handling certain tasks.\n\nHandicapped should be avoided to describe a disability. The best way to describe disabled individuals is “persons with disabilities.”\n\nGender-specific language\n\nWriters of Angelo State publications should avoid suggestions that programs and aspects of general university life are limited to or directed at a specific gender.\n\nDo not use “he” when the intent is “he or she” or “she or he.” For example:\n\nINSTEAD OF: A student applying for financial aid should file his application for admission by Jan. 1.\n\nTRY: Students applying for financial aid should file their applications for admission by Jan. 1.\n\nINSTEAD OF: The student must have an overall grade-point-average of at least 3.0 to satisfy the requirements of his school.\n\nTRY: A 3.0 grade-point-average is required to satisfy the requirements of the school.\n\nThough “he or she” or “he/she” may be used occasionally, careful attention to writing will avoid awkward language and the over-use of these terms.\n\nIn some cases, the male and female references can be alternated. In other cases, no gender-specific word need be used at all.\n\nProper Gender Use\n\nWhen reference to a specific gender is necessary, “men” and “women” generally are the preferred titles. For example:\n\nAngelo State University men may belong to several Greek and service organizations.\n\nAngelo State University women have built an enviable reputation on the basketball court.\n\nSigma Theta Tau is the international honor society for nursing. Membership is open to men and women, by invitation, based on high academic achievement.\n\nSometimes “male” and “female” may be appropriate. For example:\n\nMale students can be housed in any residence hall except Carr Hall.\n\nNumbers of female faculty are increasing.\n\n“Boys” and “girls” properly refer to children.\n\n“Alumnus” (“alumni” in the plural) refers to a man who has attended a college or university. “Alumna” (“alumnae” in the plural) refers to a woman who has attended a school. “Alumni” is the correct Latin plural for use when referring to both men and women who have attended a school."
