Instead use women or men.\n\nIt is important to note that many people whose gender identity does not match their biological sex may not be open about their identity to everyone. It is crucial to take extreme precaution not to endanger an individual by inadvertently outing them in a story — always ask the individual’s preference. Only identify a person’s gender identity unless it is pertinent to a story: Danica Roem is Virginia’s first openly transgender elected official.\n\nagender A person who identifies as genderless or lacking gender.\n\nbigender A person who identifies with a combination of two genders.\n\ncisgender A person whose gender identity matches their biological sex.

Trans is acceptable in headlines and on second reference. Transgender and trans are adjectives, not nouns. Transgender is not synonymous with terms like cross-dresser, drag queen, or drag performer. Do not use the outdated term transsexual or the derogatory terms tranny or transvestite. Always use the names and pronouns preferred by transgender individuals.\n\ndead name The name given at birth to a transgender individual who no longer goes by that name. Never use anyone’s dead name unless it is pertinent to the story: Caitlyn Jenner won a 1976 Olympic gold medal in decathlon, at which time she went by Bruce Jenner.\n\nSee 2SLGBTQ+.\n\nGender + Equality Center Spell out as shown on first reference, per OU's site and common usage on social media.
