        "text": "There is no alternative to correct punctuation. Incorrect punctuation can change the meaning of a sentence with the result being an ill-informed reader. Even if the meaning of a sentence is not altered by poor punctuation, it can cause a reader to lose track of what is being said, leading to confusion.\n\nPossessives\n\n“It’s” vs. “Its,” “Its” vs. “Their,” and Other Possessives\n\nIf you are talking about a contraction of the phrase “it is,” use “it’s.” If you are talking about a possessive situation—“the thing belonging to it”—use “its.”\n\nIt’s no secret that the university encourages diversity.\n\nUse “it” and “its” when referring to possessive situations involving groups, schools, corporations, etc.; they are entities. Do not use “their.”\n\nThe College of Science has increased the number of its (not “their”) faculty. Xerox follows the progress of its (not “their”) co-op students carefully.\n\nSingular possessives and plural possessives confuse a lot of folks. Here are some examples of words in singular possessive, plural, and plural possessive forms.\n\nPossessive Plural Plural Possessive child’s toy children children’s toy boy’s hats boys boys’ hats Santa’s nose many Santas many Santas’ noses its own their own their own\n\nPluralizing\n\nNever, absolutely never, use apostrophes to pluralize (“raining cat’s and dog’s,” etc.). Not even for proper names ending in “s.” In that case, either end the name in “es” or leave it singular as appropriate to the name; usually it’s “es.” (“The Myerses say they love teaching.”) For acronyms, don’t use an apostrophe unless the acronym ends in “S.” (CODs, IOUs, but MS’s, BS’s). When in doubt, consult the Associated Press Stylebook.\n\nCommas\n\nUse commas or semicolons to separate items in a series. Which to use? Here’s how to tell: If you have a series of three or more elements that are simple and similar, use commas.\n\napples, peaches, and pumpkin pie\n\nJoe Smith, Mary Jones, and Susan Stacy received scholarships.\n\nIf you are listing many different elements to describe something, and the descriptions are wordy (especially if they also contain internal commas), separate with semicolons.\n\nHe is a 2016 graduate of RIT; a renowned illustrator for Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, and The Atlantic; and a talented tenor.\n\nIf you need to set off individual elements in a long list (such as a series of students’ names and their colleges), use a combination of the two, with a comma following the last item in the series.\n\nJoe Smith, College of Science; Mary Jones, NTID; and Susan Stacy, College of Engineering, received scholarships.\n\nUse an internal comma after the date and year when a specific date is given. Do not use internal commas when a specific date is not given.\n\nOn Sept. 28, 2018, we went to Toronto.\n\nIn September 2018 we went on vacation.\n\nAt 3 p.m., Sept. 28, we will hold a meeting.\n\nAlso use commas to separate the elements in addresses and places:\n\nColleen Clarke is originally from Ithaca, N.Y., but now lives in Hilton.\n\nAnd use them to set off appositive (nonrestrictive) clauses:\n\nJohn Doe, senior vice president of Enrollment Management, came to RIT from Eisenhower College.\n\nDitto for appositive words:\n\nNeil’s wife, Barbara, is a teacher. (Her name is not essential; Neil has only one wife, so the reader knows who is the teacher.)\n\nBut restrictive words and phrases do not use commas:\n\nKaren’s son Scott is excited about the Lions this year. (There could be more than one son, and the name is necessary to identify which one is a Lions fan.)\n\nUse commas between the clauses in a compound sentence unless they are very short and closely related. Do not use commas with a compound predicate.\n\nThe client asked if the job could be delivered the next day, and the printer jumped out the window.\n\nThe student studied all night and took the test in the morning.\n\nUse a comma before “including” and “such as” when followed by a nonrestrictive, nonessential phrase or clause.\n\nThe new policy applies to everyone, including faculty.\n\nSome students make silly excuses, such as “My dog ate my homework.”\n\nDo not use a comma when using a phrase like “as well as,” in which the clause is essential and restrictive.\n\nThe new policy applies to faculty as well as staff.\n\nDo not use commas after a man’s name if he is a “Jr.,” “Sr.” “II,” “III,” etc.\n\nWrong: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nRight: Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nWrong: The Mod Squad featured Clarence Williams, III.\n\nRight: The Mod Squad featured Clarence Williams III.\n\nPeriods\n\nUse a single space after a period at the end of a sentence. Don’t use periods at the end of incomplete sentences or lists:\n\nCourses include:\n\nMicroelectronic Feats\n\nHydroelectricity and Sound\n\nTransformer Conversions\n\nUse an ellipsis (…) to indicate omitted words within a sentence or quote. In general, treat an ellipsis as a three-letter word, constructed with three periods and two spaces (that is, leave one regular space on both sides of an ellipsis).\n\n“I’m sure the aftereffects will … be with people for a while,” he said.\n\nIf the words that precede an ellipsis constitute a grammatically complete sentence in the original (or if quote is condensed), place a period at the end of the last word before the ellipsis. Follow it with a regular space and an ellipsis:\n\nAbraham Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address speaks of the need to preserve “… government of the people, by the people and for the people. …”\n\nQuotation Marks and Italics\n\nUse quotation marks for titles of articles; chapters in books; academic papers; radio and TV programs that are not part of a regularly scheduled series; songs; seminars for which the name is descriptive; and workshops. Also use them for comments made by interviewed people, of course.\n\nShe thought, “The MTV Video Music Awards” wasn’t as good this year as last.\n\nSnow White sang “Someday My Prince Will Come.”\n\nDon’t you want to go to the “Learning the Internet” seminar?\n\nThey hadn’t heard of the “Getting Along with Your Adult Kids” workshop.\n\nRemember to put single quotes inside double quotes when quoting a person quoting someone else or quoting a title of the above:\n\n\"Everyone in Belgrade is singing ‘We Live Again,’” he reported.\n\n“My article, ‘The Reproductive Cycle of Female Brown Shrimp in the North Sea,’ will be published soon,” she said.\n\nUse italics (not underlines) for titles of books, magazines, newspapers, TV series, plays, and movies.\n\nTitanic was as over-rated as the ship itself but stayed afloat nevertheless.\n\nAl Pacino was featured in The Insider.\n\nHe wants to be published in The New York Times.\n\nEveryone knows that appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated is a jinx.\n\nThe line was so long, I could have finished reading War and Peace before I got service.\n\nPunctuation should always appear inside quotation marks, except when using semicolons and colons, and in the case of question marks and exclamation points that apply to the entire sentence, not just the quoted material:\n\nHave you heard the song “Steamroller”?\n\n“I can’t believe they actually sang ‘Why Don’t We Do It in the Road?’!”\n\nURLs\n\nWhen URLs must be broken at the end of a line of type, break the URL at a slash.\n\nhttps://www.rit.edu/\n\nbusiness\n\nApostrophe\n\nLetter Grades\n\nPlurals of letter grades do not use an apostrophe before the s.\n\nShe gave out more As than Bs this semester.\n\nQuotation Marks\n\nDo not use quotations around letter grades.\n\nHe earned a B in Introduction to Chemistry."
