        "text": "The Chico State University Writing Style Guide provides language usage guidelines for campus publications. It ensures that all University communications—including websites, newsletters, flyers, and magazines—reflect the unity of Chico State and meet standards of writing and grammar worthy of an institution of higher education.\n\nEM 02-96 requires university communicators adhere to the University Writing Style Guide. Publications intended for external or broad audiences must be reviewed by the Campus Editing team. Learn more about Campus Editing.\n\nIf an item is not listed below, defer to the Chicago Manual of Style or the Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary for usage or spelling, respectively.\n\nAlphabetical Index\n\nA | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z\n\nabbreviations and acronyms\n\nIn general, and especially for off-campus audiences, avoid acronyms. Explain or spell out an acronym on first use for any audience that may not be familiar with the acronym. Periods are not necessary after the letters that form an acronym.\n\nUse only official university abbreviations. See building names/abbreviations, colleges, course listings/titles, degrees and majors, and plurals.\n\nThe Campus Alcohol and Drug Education Center (CADEC) is located in the Student Services Center. CADEC's services are available to all campus members.\n\naccessibility information\n\nEqual opportunity cannot be achieved unless individuals with disabilities are aware that accommodations are available on campus. It is recommended that accommodation statements be included when writing about an upcoming event or on websites, web apps, and social media where content has known issues (for example, a link to external, uncaptions YouTube videos). See Accommodation Statements for sample statements and more about the campus web exemption process.\n\naddresses\n\nIn text (as opposed to mailing labels), use full official names of offices, departments, and buildings in university addresses. Spell out names of buildings and Street, Avenue, and other similar words.\n\nThe University's address is 400 West First Street, Chico, CA 95929-0560.\n\nFor mailing labels, use the following format:\n\nDepartment of Construction Management\n\nCalifornia State University, Chico\n\n400 W. First Street\n\nChico, CA 95929-0560\n\nUse the correct nine-digit zip code whenever possible. Note that just one space separates the state from the zip code.\n\nDirecting readers to campus offices\n\nFor off-campus readers, use full official name of the office and office location.\n\nFinancial Aid and Scholarship Office, Student Services Center 250\n\nDepartment of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Physical Sciences Building 210\n\nFor on-campus readers, the short form is acceptable.\n\nFinancial Aid and Scholarship, SSC 250\n\nmath department, Holt 181\n\nadvisor\n\nUse the -or ending.\n\nAfrican American, Black\n\nBoth terms are acceptable but not always interchangeable. For example, Black individuals from a Caribbean nation may refer to themselves as Caribbean American. If the individual or group about which you are writing expresses a preference, use that term. Do not hyphenate African American (or other compound nationalities, even when used as an adjective: \"an honored African American novelist\"). Hyphenate compounds with name fragments: Afro-American, Indo-European.\n\nSee Black.\n\nagriculture/agricultural\n\nAdd the -al when used as an adjective.\n\nHe is majoring in sustainable agriculture.\n\nShe is majoring in agricultural business.\n\nalumni\n\nUse alumnus for an individual male, alumna for an individual female; alumni for a group of males, alumnae for a group of females; use of alumni when referring to a group composed of men and women is commonly accepted. Any individual who attended Chico State is considered an alumna/us. Use of alum and alums is acceptable in informal text.\n\nAmerican Indian, Indian\n\nSee Native American.\n\nand/or\n\nAvoid this shortcut. Instead of writing \"You may file change of major forms on Monday and/or Tuesday,\" write \" . . . on Monday or Tuesday.\"\n\nAS\n\nUse AS on second reference as the abbreviation for the Associated Students at Chico State.\n\nThe AS should be referred to in the singular, as an entity.\n\nThe Associated Students is committed to serving students.\n\nAsian American\n\nNo hyphen is used for either the noun or the adjective.\n\nBlack\n\nCapitalize the adjective Black when it refers to people, culture, or race. Black is a broader term than African American as it may include people from Africa, the Caribbean, and elsewhere. When ethnicity is relevant, ask the individual or group which identifier they use.\n\nbiased language\n\nSexist language\n\nThe use of the they or their is acceptable as both a singular and plural pronoun. If necessary, use he or she or his and hers, but avoid he/she, him/her, and s/he. In general, clarify with your subject what pronouns you should use to refer to them in your writing rather than assume based on their appearance or gender expression.\n\nUse inclusive references such as humankind and human-made rather than mankind and man-made; use inclusive verbs such as to staff a table rather than to man a table.\n\nUse generic nouns such as photographer not cameraman; Representatives not Congressmen; supervisor not foreman; chair not chairman.\n\nReplace stereotyped titles: professor not career woman; student not coed; doctor not lady/female doctor; nurse not male nurse; actor not actress.\n\nWriting about people with disabilities\n\nIn general, only refer to a disability if it is relevant to the story. When necessary, refer to disabilities with an active voice, giving the person ownership over their disability. The term disability is always preferable to the term handicap.\n\nDos\n\nPeople with disabilities . . .\n\nHe has muscular dystrophy.\n\nShe uses a wheelchair and he walks with crutches.\n\nHe has a mental disability.\n\nDon'ts\n\nDisabled people . . .\n\nHe suffers from muscular dystrophy.\n\nShe is wheelchair-bound and he is confined to crutches.\n\nHe is mentally retarded.\n\nBlue Light Emergency Phones\n\nUse as the official name for blue light phones on campus. Other names—blue light phones, emergency phones, blue lights, etc.—should be considered unofficial and left uncapitalized.\n\nbuilding names/abbreviations\n\nUse these official building names and abbreviations.\n\n25MST 25 Main Street\n\n35MST 35 Main Street\n\nAEWC Albert E.

It is also used to introduce a clause relating to the preceding clause.

(not The committee is comprised of. . . )\n\nConstitute means to make up the elements of the whole:\n\nFaculty and staff constitute the committee.\n\ncontractions\n\nMost readers consider contractions informal, so for most university publications, it's best to avoid them. But for newsletters and other documents or publications that you want to have an informal and friendly tone, contractions are fine if used sparingly.\n\ncourse listings/titles\n\nIn academic planning guides and program requirement documents, refer to specific courses by their official identification, using the abbreviation and course number. Capitalize, no quotation marks.\n\nENGL 130, POLS 055, BLAW 090 (not English 130, Poli Sci 55, or Bus Law 90)\n\nWhen referring to a course by its subtitle, enclose in quotes.\n\nThis semester, she will be taking \"The History of Women in America.\"\n\ncoursework\n\nSet as one word.\n\ncross country\n\nThe sport's name, whether it is being used as a noun or an adjective, should be spelled out without a hyphen.\n\ncross country\n\ncross country runner\n\ndashes\n\nAn em dash (—) is used to set off a parenthetical element that is very abrupt, that denotes a sudden break in thought, or that has commas within it. Em dashes tend to emphasize the elements being set off. They can also be used as punctuation to attribute a quote.\n\nThe dean—small, old, and frail—addressed the assembly before his retirement.\n\nOn a PC, use the alt code Alt+0151 or the shortcut Ctrl+Alt+(hyphen) to make an em dash. On a mac, use the shortcut Option/Alt+Shift+(hyphen) to make an em dash.\n\nThe other specialized dash is the en dash. It is primarily used for number and date ranges, as well as denoting the minus sign in grades (see grades). It is slightly longer than a hyphen but shorter than an em dash.\n\n2012–2013\n\nchapters 12–14\n\npages 3–15\n\nOn a PC, use the alt code Alt+0150 or the shortcut Ctrl+(hyphen) to make an en dash. On a mac, use the shortcut Option/Alt+(hyphen) to make an en dash.\n\ndata\n\nAlthough datum is technically the proper singular form of data, common usage prefers to us data for both singular and plural forms.\n\ndates\n\nSpell out months and days of the week. If necessary for space, you can abbreviate Jan., Feb., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., and Dec. Use no punctuation if listing only the month and the year, but set the year off with commas if listing the day of the month as well. Do not use superscript ordinals, as in 1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.\n\nDecember 4, 2011, was . . .\n\nOct. 24, 2012 (abbreviated for space)\n\nOctober 2012\n\nthe class of '09\n\nthe sixties (or the 1990s—just be consistent)\n\nNote: When abbreviating a specific year (class of '09), the apostrophe faces away from the visible numbers, toward those that are implied.\n\ndegrees and majors\n\nFor a complete list of Chico State's programs and majors, visit the Academic Programs page(opens in new window).\n\nCapitalize the full degree title; lowercase the shorter form.\n\nBachelor of Arts degree (BA)\n\nbachelor's degree\n\nbaccalaureate or baccalaureate degree\n\nMaster of Arts degree (MA)\n\nmaster's degree\n\nMaster of Public Administration (but master's program in public administration)\n\ndoctorate in education (EdD) [descriptive, not formal title]\n\nDoctorate of Philosophy (PhD) [formal title]\n\nIn general, do not use abbreviations for degrees after a person's name (e.g., Joel Stein, PhD), unless necessary to establish her or his credentials.\n\nNo periods in abbreviations of academic degrees.\n\nBA, BS, BFA, EdD, MA, MS, MBA, MFA, MPA, MSW, PhD\n\nWhen referring to degrees in general, lowercase the first letter of the degree and use 's.

In 1972, it became 'California State University, Chico.'\"\n\nemail\n\nSee also Chico State email or URLs and email addresses.\n\nemerita/emeritus\n\nEmerita, in the title \"professor emerita,\" means a female retired from the faculty but permitted to retain as an honorary title the rank of the last academic appointment held.\n\nEmeritus in the title \"professor emeritus,\" means a male retired from the faculty but permitted to retain as an honorary title the rank of the last academic appointment held.\n\nSee titles of people.\n\nemphasis\n\nChoose only one type style, italics or bold with lowercase, to indicate emphasis. Using various styles to indicate emphasis can be distracting (and may leave readers feeling like you're shouting at them). Always avoid using all caps.\n\nYou must meet the deadline or your registration will be canceled.\n\nAvoid: You must meet the deadline or YOUR REGISTRATION WILL BE CANCELED!\n\nWherever possible give directions in courteous, positive terms.\n\nPlease turn out the lights, not DON'T LEAVE LIGHTS ON!\n\nNote: Never underline text to add emphasis, especially in online publications. Underlined text signifies a hyperlink.\n\netc.\n\nEtc. sometimes masks an imprecise or incomplete thought.

When items are numbered or lettered in a vertical list, follow each number or letter with a period. Otherwise, if the items in a vertical list need to be set off, use bullets.

For additional guidance, consult the Office of Diversity and Inclusion.\n\nThe use of the they or their is acceptable as both a singular and plural pronoun. (See biased language)\n\nprofessor/doctor\n\nUse of professor is preferred. Professor is an academic rank or title. All faculty can be referred to as “Professor” as a title, regardless of whether they are lecturers, assistant professors, associate professors, or full professors. A doctor (in academics) is one who has earned the highest academic degree (e.g., PhD). Not all professors have doctorates, nor are all holders of doctorates professors. See titles of people.\n\npunctuation\n\n(See colons, commas, dashes, ellipses, hyphens, and quotation marks)\n\nquotation marks\n\nUse quotation marks to indicate a citation or direct quotation. Place commas and periods inside the closing quotation mark; colons and semicolons outside. Placement of a question mark depends on the meaning: Does it apply to the part quoted or to the whole sentence? Question marks that are part of a title go inside quotation marks.\n\nThe University Catalog says this about our satellite technology: \"In 1983, the University installed a 10-meter Scientific Atlanta earth station on campus.\"\n\n\"I can't attend,\" she said.\n\nWas she called \"President\"?\n\nHe asked, \"Is it time to go?\"\n\nRead chapter 2, \"Where from Here?\"\n\nsalutations for form letters\n\nForm letters are addressed to groups.

If it is addressed exclusively to men or to men and women who are alumni, you may use Dear Alumni or Dear Alumni/ae for the salutation.\n\nseasons\n\nUse lowercase, even when referring to an issue of a publication (capitalize only if the season is part of the official title, as in The Fall Update).\n\nthe fall 2012 issue of Chico Statements\n\nsexism\n\nSee biased language.\n\nsingular/plural words\n\nSingular: Criterion, parenthesis, phenomenon, medium, and memorandum\n\nPlural: Criteria, parentheses, phenomena, media, and memorandums\n\nCollective nouns such as committee, faculty, and staff name a group.

Never use AM with \"morning\" or PM with \"evening,\" and never use \"o'clock\" with either AM or PM or with numerals. Avoid the redundancy of \"The game is at 8 PM tonight.\"\n\nOffice hours are 8 AM to 5 PM (or 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.)\n\n(8–9 PM is acceptable in tables and lists.)\n\nRegistration will occur 9:30 to 11 AM.\n\neight o'clock; noon/midnight\n\ntitles of people\n\nOfficial personal titles immediately preceding a name are capitalized; those following a name or set off by commas are not. This rule applies to both academic and administrative titles. Distinguish between official titles and purely descriptive titles (e.g., Maintenance Supervisor Susan Smith; maintenance employee Susan Smith). For academic titles, use \"Professor Jones\" rather than \"Dr. Jones\" in most contexts; with rare exception, the University does not use “Dr.” as a title except for medical professionals—including in reference to faculty with PhDs. All faculty can be referred to as “Professor” as a title, regardless of whether they are lecturers, assistant professors, associate professors, or full professors.\n\nThe latest discovery by Professor Anne Fisher . . .\n\nJames Allen, assistant professor of anthropology, has discovered . . .\n\nA professor of engineering at Chico State since 2010, Mary Roth studies . . .\n\nVice Provost Juan Garcia . . .\n\nJuan Garcia, vice provost since 2011, . . .; but note that campus convention is \"Susan Dolan, vice president for Student Affairs\"\n\nProfessor Emerita Joan Levy . . .\n\nDavid Sachs, professor emeritus of art . . .\n\ntitles of works\n\nThe following titles are set in italics:\n\ntitles and subtitles of published books, pamphlets, proceedings and collections, periodicals, and newspapers and sections of newspapers published separately\n\ntitles of collections of poetry and long poems\n\ntitles of plays\n\ntitles of motion pictures\n\ntitles of websites (\"visit the Class Schedule online at…\")\n\ntitles of operas, oratorios, and other long musical compositions\n\ntitles of paintings, drawings, statues, photography, and other works of art\n\ntitles of art shows and exhibitions\n\nThe following works are set in roman (regular/plain) type and enclosed in quotation marks:\n\ntitles of articles and features in periodicals and newspapers\n\ntitles of short stories, essays, chapter titles, and individual\n\nselections in books\n\ntitles of dissertations and theses, manuscripts in collections, and lectures and papers read at meetings\n\ntitles of television and radio programs (unless it's a series; then italicize the program title and put the episode title in quotation marks—The X-Files, \"Trust No One\")\n\ntitles of songs and short compositions\n\nExact titles of campus publications should be italicized.\n\nThe 2009–20011 University Catalog or The University Catalog but the catalog\n\nNote: Infinitives (\"to\" + verb) should be capitalized in headlines and titles of works (ex: the Time To Be Growing fundraising campaign), as an infinitive functions as a noun.\n\nunder-\n\nIn general, don't hyphenate words with under as a prefix (understaffed).\n\nunderrepresented minorities\n\nThis term should only be used in data reporting. For all other purposes, use \"underserved\" or \"historically underserved\" when referring to student populations that have been historically excluded from opportunities in higher education.\n\n\"Underrepresented\" refers to racial and ethnic populations that are represented at disproportionately low levels in higher education. \"Historically\" means that this is a 10-year or longer trend at a given school.\n\nWhile the term underrepresented minority (URM) is not one preferred by the CSU, it is a California legislatively mandated reporting category for monitoring progress on closing gaps on four-year freshman and two-year transfer graduation rates. Underrepresented minorities (URMs) are African Americans, American Indians/Alaska Natives, and Latinos, who have historically comprised a minority of the U.S. population.\n\nunderserved populations\n\nUnderserved students are defined as those who do not receive equitable resources as other students in the academic pipeline. Typically, these groups of students include low-income, racial/ethnic minorities (\"people of color\" or \"students of color\" is the preferred use, not \"minorities\"), and first-generation students, among others.\n\nRaces and ethnicities that are included: African American, American Indian/Alaska Native, Hispanic/Latino, and Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander.\n\n\"Historically underserved\" students are defined as low-income students, those who are first in their families to attend college, and students of color. This term is preferred because it reflects institutional injustice rather than implying individual failure.\n\nunique\n\nUnique means \"without like or equal.\" Logically, there can be no degrees of uniqueness, as in \"the most unique.\" So, even though it is a commonly used term, in formal writing it's best to avoid this usage.\n\nuniversity\n\nUppercase \"the University\" when referring to Chico State. For example, \"The University prides itself on being a top-value school\" or \"The University flag will be lowered Tuesday.\" (See California State University, Chico.)\n\nUniversity Foundation, The\n\nUse to refer to the university auxiliary that manages gifts and endowments to the campus.\n\nNote: the capital T in The. After first reference, the Foundation is acceptable as an informal name.\n\nUniversity Farm\n\nFor first reference, use the official name, the Paul L. Byrne University Farm. You may wish to indicate that its common name is the \"University Farm.\" The official abbreviation is FARM.\n\nupper-division\n\nSet with a hyphen when used as an adjective.\n\nupper-division classes\n\nURLs and email addresses\n\nIn digital text, avoid writing out URLs. Instead, use descriptive words and a hyperlink. For example, \"University Communications(opens in new window) provides more details\" is better than \"For more information, click here.\" For email, use the person’s name and write out and link the address. For example, “email Ashley Gebb at agebb@csuchico.edu.”\n\nIn print publications, URLs and email addresses should be italicized. Use parentheses to enclose a URL, or a colon to introduce it, and italics to highlight it. If an address won't fit on one line, break the address after a forward slash or before a period. Do not hyphenate. The “www” is not necessary as part of the URL, unless the URL begins with “www.csuchico.edu,” then the “www” is necessary. For example, “For more information, visit www.csuchico.edu/ucomm or contact Ashley Gebb at agebb@csuchico.edu.”\n\nvoicemail\n\nSet as one word when used as a noun (my voicemail) or as an adjective (the voicemail system).\n\nweb\n\nLowercase web, website, web manager, web page\n\nWildcat ID\n\nPreferred over \"Wildcat Card\" or \"Wildcat ID Card\" when referring to the student/employee ID card.\n\nwordiness\n\nUse the simple and direct word or phrase. Consider the following substitutes:\n\nWordy\n\nowing to the fact that\n\nin order to\n\nthere is no doubt that\n\ndeadline date\n\nstudent body\n\nPreferred Usage\n\nsince\n\nto\n\nno doubt\n\ndeadline\n\nstudents\n\nwork-study\n\nWork-study is always hyphenated."
