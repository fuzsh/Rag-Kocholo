        "text": "Nineteenth letter in the Greek alphabet\n\nThis article is about the letter of the Greek alphabet. For the mathematical constant, see Tau (mathematical constant). For other uses, see Tau (disambiguation).\n\nNot to be confused with Tao or the Latin letter T.\n\nTau ( ;[1] uppercase Œ§, lowercase œÑ or œÑ {\\displaystyle {\\boldsymbol {\\tau }}} ; Greek: œÑŒ±œÖ [taf]) is the nineteenth letter of the Greek alphabet, representing the voiceless dental or alveolar plosive IPA: [t]. In the system of Greek numerals, it has a value of 300.\n\nThe name in English is pronounced or ,[2] but in Greek it is [taf].[3][4] This is because the pronunciation of the combination of Greek letters Œ±œÖ can have the pronunciation of either [ai], [av] or [af], depending on what follows and if a diaeresis is present on the second vowel (see Greek orthography).\n\nTau was derived from the Phoenician letter taw (ê§ï).[5] Letters that arose from tau include Roman T and Cyrillic Te (–¢, —Ç).\n\nThe letter occupies the Unicode slots U+03C4 (lowercase) and U+03A4 (uppercase). In HTML, they can be produced with named entities (&tau; and &Tau;), decimal references (&#964; and &#932;), or hexadecimal references (&#x3C4; and &#x3A4;).\n\nModern usage\n\n[edit]\n\nThe lower-case letter œÑ is used as a symbol for:\n\nSpecific tax amount[6]\n\nBiology\n\n[edit]\n\nThe expressed period of the freerunning rhythm of an animal, i.e., the length of the daily cycle of an animal when kept in constant light or constant darkness\n\nThe dose interval in pharmacokinetics[7]\n\nThe core variable in general tau theory\n\nTau in biochemistry, a protein associated with microtubules and implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, some forms of frontotemporal lobar degeneration, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy[8][9]\n\nMathematics\n\n[edit]\n\nDivisor function in number theory, also denoted d or œÉ0[10][note 1]\n\nGolden ratio (1.618...), although œÜ (phi) is more common[11][note 1]\n\nKendall tau rank correlation coefficient in statistics[12]\n\nStopping time in stochastic processes.[13][note 2]\n\nTau, the ratio of the circumference to the radius of a circle, which is equal to 2œÄ (6.28318...)[14][15]\n\nTau functions, several\n\nTorsion of a curve in differential geometry[16][note 1]\n\nTranslation in Euclidean geometry (although the Latin letter T is used more often)\n\nThe Prouhet‚ÄìThue‚ÄìMorse constant\n\nPhysics\n\n[edit]\n\nProper time in relativity\n\nShear stress in continuum mechanics\n\nThe lifetime of a spontaneous emission process\n\nTau, an elementary particle in particle physics\n\nTau in astronomy is a measure of optical depth, or how much sunlight cannot penetrate the atmosphere\n\nIn the physical sciences, tau is sometimes used as time variable, to avoid confusing t as temperature\n\nTime constant (also relaxation time) of any system, such as an RC circuit\n\nTorque, the rotational force in mechanics\n\nThe symbol for tortuosity in hydrogeology\n\nIn thermal physics, the symbol for the fundamental temperature œÑ = k B T {\\displaystyle \\tau =k_{B}T}\n\nSymbolism\n\n[edit]\n\nIn ancient times, tau was used as a symbol for life or resurrection, whereas the eighth letter of the Greek alphabet, theta, was considered the symbol of death.[citation needed]\n\nIn Biblical times, the taw was put on men to distinguish those who lamented sin, although newer versions of the Bible have replaced the ancient term taw with mark (Ezekiel 9:4) or signature (Job 31:35). Its original sound value is a voiceless alveolar plosive, IPA /t/[citation needed]\n\nThe symbolism of the cross was connected not only to the letter chi but also to tau, the equivalent of the last letter in the Phoenician and Old Hebrew alphabets, and which was originally cruciform in shape; see Cross of Tau.[citation needed]\n\nAn essay written around 160 AD, attributed to Lucian, a mock legal prosecution called The Consonants at Law - Sigma vs. Tau, in the Court of the Seven Vowels, contains a reference to the cross attribution. Sigma petitions the court to sentence Tau to death by crucifixion, saying:\n\nMen weep, and bewail their lot, and curse Cadmus with many curses for introducing Tau into the family of letters; they say it was his body that tyrants took for a model, his shape that they imitated, when they set up structures on which men are crucified. Stauros (cross) the vile engine is called, and it derives its vile name from him. Now, with all these crimes upon him, does he not deserve death, nay, many deaths? For my part I know none bad enough but that supplied by his own shape ‚Äî that shape which he gave to the gibbet named stauros after him by men\n\nTau is usually considered as the symbol of Franciscan orders due to St. Francis' love for it, symbol of the redemption and of the Cross. Almost all Franciscan churches have painted a tau with two crossing arms, both with stigmata, the one of Jesus and the other of Francis; members of the Secular Franciscan Order usually wear a wooden œÑ in a string with three knots around the neck\n\nThe title and symbol of \"Tau\" is used by neo-Gnostic bishops as it has some symbolism in many of the modern branches of Gnosticism.\n\nCharacter encodings\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the Greek and Coptic letter tau:[17]\n\nCharacter information Preview Œ§ œÑ ‚≤¶ ‚≤ß Unicode name GREEK CAPITAL LETTER TAU GREEK SMALL LETTER TAU COPTIC CAPITAL LETTER TAU COPTIC SMALL LETTER TAU Encodings decimal hex dec hex dec hex dec hex Unicode 932 U+03A4 964 U+03C4 11430 U+2CA6 11431 U+2CA7 UTF-8 206 164 CE A4 207 132 CF 84 226 178 166 E2 B2 A6 226 178 167 E2 B2 A7 Numeric character reference &#932; &#x3A4; &#964; &#x3C4; &#11430; &#x2CA6; &#11431; &#x2CA7; Named character reference &Tau; &tau; DOS Greek 147 93 171 AB DOS Greek-2 208 D0 238 EE Windows 1253 212 D4 244 F4 TeX \\tau\n\nFor the mathematical letter tau:[18][19][20][21][22][23][24][25][26][27]\n\nCharacter information Preview ùöª ùõï ùõµ ùúè ùúØ ùùâ Unicode name MATHEMATICAL BOLD\n\nCAPITAL TAU MATHEMATICAL BOLD\n\nSMALL TAU MATHEMATICAL ITALIC\n\nCAPITAL TAU MATHEMATICAL ITALIC\n\nSMALL TAU MATHEMATICAL BOLD ITALIC\n\nCAPITAL TAU MATHEMATICAL BOLD ITALIC\n\nSMALL TAU Encodings decimal hex dec hex dec hex dec hex dec hex dec hex Unicode 120507 U+1D6BB 120533 U+1D6D5 120565 U+1D6F5 120591 U+1D70F 120623 U+1D72F 120649 U+1D749 UTF-8 240 157 154 187 F0 9D 9A BB 240 157 155 149 F0 9D 9B 95 240 157 155 181 F0 9D 9B B5 240 157 156 143 F0 9D 9C 8F 240 157 156 175 F0 9D 9C AF 240 157 157 137 F0 9D 9D 89 UTF-16 55349 57019 D835 DEBB 55349 57045 D835 DED5 55349 57077 D835 DEF5 55349 57103 D835 DF0F 55349 57135 D835 DF2F 55349 57161 D835 DF49 Numeric character reference &#120507; &#x1D6BB; &#120533; &#x1D6D5; &#120565; &#x1D6F5; &#120591; &#x1D70F; &#120623; &#x1D72F; &#120649; &#x1D749;\n\nCharacter information Preview ùù© ùûÉ ùû£ ùûΩ Unicode name MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF\n\nBOLD CAPITAL TAU MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF\n\nBOLD SMALL TAU MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF\n\nBOLD ITALIC CAPITAL TAU MATHEMATICAL SANS-SERIF\n\nBOLD ITALIC SMALL TAU Encodings decimal hex dec hex dec hex dec hex Unicode 120681 U+1D769 120707 U+1D783 120739 U+1D7A3 120765 U+1D7BD UTF-8 240 157 157 169 F0 9D 9D A9 240 157 158 131 F0 9D 9E 83 240 157 158 163 F0 9D 9E A3 240 157 158 189 F0 9D 9E BD UTF-16 55349 57193 D835 DF69 55349 57219 D835 DF83 55349 57251 D835 DFA3 55349 57277 D835 DFBD Numeric character reference &#120681; &#x1D769; &#120707; &#x1D783; &#120739; &#x1D7A3; &#120765; &#x1D7BD;\n\nThese characters are used only as mathematical symbols.
