Members are nursing scholars and students committed to the pursuit of excellence in clinical practice, education, research and leadership.\n\nBelmont's College of Nursing has always committed to excellence in nursing scholarship and practice. Belmont's chapter of STTI, Omicron Phi, was chartered on May 2, 1998. Invitations to join STTI are awarded to undergraduate students who rank in the top 35 percent of their class (after completing half of the nursing curriculum) and graduate students who have completed one-quarter of their curriculum and have demonstrated excellence in nursing.\n\nOmicron Phi holds several events to promote the recognition of excellence and the dissemination of scholarship and participates in service projects throughout the academic year.\n\nStudent Nurses Association\n\nThe Belmont Student Nurses Association (SNA) is open to all nursing students and is an affiliate of the National Student Nurses Association. SNA provides the first opportunity for students to get involved with a professional nursing organization which is vital for nurses.\n\nSNA sponsors events that promote healthy living or show the scope of nursing practice and provides opportunities for nursing students to participate in community service events, business meetings and social events. Members also get the benefits of a Barnes and Noble book discount and a mentorship program.\n\nTo find out more information about the Belmont SNA:\n\nEmail sna@bruins.belmont.edu\n\nBelmont University offers a variety of scholarships to incoming first-year students.
