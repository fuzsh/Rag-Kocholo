        "text": "John Inglis permalink\n\n“So (unlike the chi-rho), the tau-rho isn’t really a monogram, for it isn’t the initials of a name or title.”\n\nLogic issue: if tau-rho isn’t really a monogram, then doesn’t that conclusion make the chi-rho the first real monogram? In which case the website is correct on at least that issue. I realize you use “monogram type device” in your first bullet, but there seems to be at least some equivocation because you then drop that qualifier in refering to tau-rho, and don’t clearly indicate whether the poorly informed website was refering to “monograms” per se, or to “monogram type devices”. Also, the website seems to combine all three (tau, rho, chi), so is that the issue? (i.e., were the 3 never combined? or at least that the chi-rho preceded the triple combination?). I get that you are correct, it’s just that it’s not clear how wrong the other site was, and for what reasons it was wrong.\n\nAnyway, I always find your blog enjoyable and informative.\n\nJ.\n\nBruce permalink\n\nThanks for that helpful post, Larry. Do you know anything about the proposed CHI RHO lamp from Pompeii (so, obviously, prior to 79 CE, if authentic and if it has Christian significance)? One or two websites (uh oh) refer to it, but I haven’t been able to track down any scholarly discussion about it. Here’s what one rather dubious website says, while posting a drawing of the artifact from an unmentioned book:\n\n“Among the unearthed archaeological artifacts discovered near the shoreline of the Bay of Naples in the city of Pompeii is a curious clay lamp of a distinctive design… This beautiful print from an old book dating before 1921 [see the website] depicts an ancient-style pottery oil-burning lamp with the PAX CHI RHO insignia on the handle. In Latin the P and the X are read as “PAX” – “Peace”, the design also contains the Greek Alpha and Omega at the sides of the X. Chi and Rho (X and P) are the first two letters in the Greek spelling of “Christ”. They were used as the sign of the early church along with the very early symbol of the fish before the use of the Latin cross became the standard… The Pompeii CHI RHO lamp is a much earlier use of the design. Does the evidence of this lamp in Pompeii denote the presence of a Christian group in the doomed city?”\n\nHere’s the website: http://www.ufodigest.com/article/more-poussin-code-treasures-pompeii-mystery-lamp\n\nIf you or any of your readers have any further (and more reliable) information on this, I’d be very curious.\n\nThanks for your very helpful blog.\n\nBruce.\n\nJohn Stackhouse permalink\n\nThis is the kind of sloppy, slip-shod shilly-shallying for which Hurtado is justly vilified, scorned, mocked, and, yes, derided in all the better pubs. For in his penultimate paragraph he speaks of “iota” as being the “second letter of the Greek word for ‘Christ.'” Not the third letter, after the “chi” and the “rho” he’s been going on and on about, but the second.\n\nI don’t mean to pick on this one site or its obviously sincere and dedicated creator–oh, wait! Yes, I do! Shape up, LWH, or I will not read your blogs as carefully–nay, pedantically–as I have this one. And then where would you be? Incontinently making gross mistakes like this one all over the place, that’s where."
