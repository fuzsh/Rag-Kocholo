There are all of the go-to films that everyone talks about, but today I want to review and share a romantic movie that would be absolutely perfect for this holiday. The Clock is one of the forgotten Valentine's Day films that will warm your heart!\n\n\n\nI do not own these images.\n\n\n\nI do not own these images.\n\n\n\nNormally, I would not count myself as a fan of Judy Garland. Sure the Wizard of Oz was a favorite of Sarah when she was younger and it still is one of the best musicals, in my opinion. But films like A Star is Born or other Garland movies were never at the top of my list of movies to watch. The Clock was the exception to that rule. \n\n\n\nFrom the moment this movie began, I was absolutely mesmerized. The dynamic between Judy Garland and her leading man Robert Walker was enthralling. These two are the perfect on-screen couple, their chemistry is the rare kind that is hard to find among actors.\n\n\n\nI do not own these images.\n\n\n\nI do not own these images.\n\n\n\nI think more than even the interactions between the two leading actors in this movie is the very telling moment in history it captures. The Clock is set during the World War II time era and it shows a unique aspect of what was life was like during the war. We see a soldier who is home in the United States only for a few days, falls in love with and marries a woman (Judy Garland), and then has to leave again. Now, there are several things in between that makes you wonder if they will be able to make it to the alter, but in the end The Clock is about capturing a specific time in history. \n\n\n\nDuring World War II, it was common for soldiers to rush into a marriage and end up leaving to fight in the war. In modern times it is strange to think about how people would run to the alter to wed because they were afraid of war, but we also do not have a world war currently going on and we are not faced with the same threats. We also have technology that makes it feel like a person is in the same room as us even if they are halfway across the world. Yet, The Clock is still heartwarming because it is a film about two people who fall in love. \n\n\n\nI personally love history so maybe that is why The Clock means a little more to me. However, I think this is also a timeless pick for a night of watching romantic films. Isn't that what Valentine's Day is all about?\n\n\n\nMuch Love,\n\n\n\nSarah",
