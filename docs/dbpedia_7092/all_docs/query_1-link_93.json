        "text": "Minnelli then directed Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), regarded by many as one of the greatest film musicals and as Minnelli’s greatest film. It was a lavish adaptation of Sally Benson’s autobiographical stories about a St. Louis, Missouri, family in 1903–04. Judy Garland starred as Esther Smith, the teenaged daughter whose romance with the boy next door (Tom Drake) serves as the fulcrum for a sentimental but lovingly rendered tale of family togetherness that, in the midst of World War II, was embraced by moviegoers. The sprightly “The Trolley Song” was nominated for an Academy Award, but it was the heartbreaking “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” that best captured the film’s bittersweet nostalgia. Meet Me in St. Louis smoothed Garland’s transition to adult roles, and an on-set romance bloomed between her and Minnelli.\n\nZiegfeld Follies (1945) was a $3 million all-star revue—with Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Lucille Ball, Garland, Horne, and Skelton—for which Minnelli directed five production numbers, including the Astaire-Lucille Bremer showstopper “Limehouse Blues” and “A Great Lady Has an Interview,” in which Garland did a witty parody of MGM grande dame Greer Garson. This was the closest Minnelli ever came to re-creating one of his 1930s Broadway revues on film.\n\nMinnelli was then asked to take over The Clock (1945), his first nonmusical picture. This wartime homefront romance originally was to have been directed by Jack Conway and then, when Conway took ill, Fred Zinnemann. But Garland insisted that Minnelli—who was not dating her at that moment—replace Zinnemann. A corporal (Robert Walker) from a small town is on a two-day leave in New York City before shipping out to fight in the war, and he meets a wised-up New Yorker (Garland) and falls desperately in love with her. The Clock remains one of the most charming of Hollywood’s World War II romances and one of Garland’s most enduring dramatic vehicles. Minnelli and Garland married after the picture wrapped.\n\nDespite such unusual touches as a 16-minute dream ballet inspired by the paintings of Salvador Dalí, Yolanda and the Thief (1945) is generally considered one of Minnelli’s lesser musicals. Astaire played an American con man visiting the mythical Latin American country of Patria, with an eye to fleecing a convent-raised heiress (Bremer) by posing as the guardian angel to whom she has been praying for guidance. Yolanda did not work for audiences of the day and became Minnelli’s first flop.\n\nUndercurrent (1946) was a melodrama starring Katharine Hepburn as a New England spinster who marries a suave wealthy industrialist (Robert Taylor) only to learn that he is mentally unbalanced and jealous of his black-sheep brother (Robert Mitchum). Till the Clouds Roll By (1946) was a biopic about songwriter Jerome Kern, for which Minnelli directed the three numbers that featured Garland (now four months pregnant with Liza Minnelli) as 1920s Broadway star Marilyn Miller.\n\nMinnelli’s next project was an adaptation of the 1942 Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne stage success The Pirate (1948), set in the 1830s Caribbean. The Pirate starred Kelly as the dashing Serafin, a not-so-humble minstrel, and Garland as the wide-eyed Manuela, who believes Serafin to be Macoco, the scourge of the Caribbean and the lusty rogue of her dreams. After six months the film was finished but was far from ready for release. Garland had backslid into dependency on barbiturates, a problem that had long plagued her, and the combination of Minnelli’s complex vision and her own inability (and, at times, simple reluctance) to go back to work proved disastrous. Minnelli tinkered with the picture for another six months, running its cost up to more than $3.7 million—almost what Gone with the Wind (1939) had cost. But The Pirate was not as successful; it lost over $1.5 million, the biggest flop of Garland’s and Minnelli’s career. She had Minnelli taken off what would have been their next film collaboration, Easter Parade (1948).\n\nWith his marriage crumbling, Minnelli spent a year directing screen tests before taking on the challenging assignment of adapting Gustave Flaubert’s novel Madame Bovary. The result, released in 1949, featured Jennifer Jones as the pretentious, adulterous Emma Bovary, Van Heflin as her cuckolded husband, Charles, and Louis Jourdan as her seducer, Rodolphe; James Mason played Flaubert himself, on trial on obscenity charges, in a framing sequence. The erotically charged ballroom sequence was Minnelli at his expressive best, but many complained that the tale had been hopelessly gutted. Shot quickly and cheaply, Madame Bovary turned a profit and restored MGM’s faith in Minnelli.\n\nFilms of the early 1950s: Father of the Bride, An American in Paris, and The Bad and the Beautiful\n\nFather of the Bride (1950) was a departure for Minnelli in its contemporary domestic setting. Spencer Tracy gave one of his great comic performances as the shell-shocked dad who finds the impending nuptials of his daughter (Elizabeth Taylor) spiraling out of control, and Joan Bennett as the mother delivered her dry antidotes to his hysteria with superb timing. One of 1950’s biggest hits, Father of the Bride remains Minnelli’s funniest movie, and a sequel, Father’s Little Dividend (1951), also directed by Minnelli, followed.\n\nAn American in Paris (1951) was developed by Freed from George Gershwin’s orchestral suite. Kelly, who also choreographed the film, exhibited his trademark exuberance as Jerry Mulligan, an American artist studying in Paris who allows himself to be supported by a wealthy patron (Nina Foch) only to fall in love with a young perfume-shop clerk (Leslie Caron). An American in Paris offered such Gershwin gems as “ ’S Wonderful” and “I Got Rhythm.” But it was the film’s spectacular concluding number, a 17-minute ballet with sets designed in the style of French Impressionist paintings that cost a half million dollars and took four weeks to film, that ultimately transported moviegoers. It was one of Minnelli’s biggest hits, and the film received wide acclaim, culminating in six Oscars, including one for best picture. Minnelli garnered his first Oscar nomination for best director.\n\nThe newly divorced Minnelli devoted himself to The Bad and the Beautiful (1952), an exposé of Hollywood’s peculiar dreams and nightmares. Kirk Douglas starred as a manipulative movie producer (based rather obviously on David O. Selznick) who abuses those around him in his quest for screen perfection; he has an affair with the unproven star (Lana Turner) of his film to give her confidence and then dumps her as soon as shooting has finished. Minnelli indulged himself with a florid, expressionistic camera style that mirrored the violent emotions of the characters.\n\nMinnelli made the short film “Mademoiselle,” the central segment of The Story of Three Loves (1953), an anthology about the varied miseries of romance. Caron played the pretentious governess of a young American (Ricky Nelson) visiting Rome; under the spell of a sorceress (Ethel Barrymore), he is transformed into a handsome adult (Farley Granger) who immediately falls in love with the governess.\n\nMinnelli capped this fruitful period with the classic musical The Band Wagon (1953), a hilarious skewering of Broadway’s pretensions. Astaire starred as Tony Hunter, a washed-up movie-musical star whose desperation reluctantly lands him in a ridiculously overstuffed musical about Faust, engineered by pompous theatrical “genius” Jeffrey Cordova (Jack Buchanan). Michael Kidd’s choreography illuminates the production numbers—“That’s Entertainment,” “Dancing in the Dark,” and a clever parody of Mickey Spillane’s hard-boiled detective novels, “The Girl Hunt.” The Band Wagon received only three Oscar nominations, but over the years its reputation has soared, and it is considered one of the best screen musicals.\n\nThe Long, Long Trailer (1954) was a descent from the artistic height of The Band Wagon, but it became one of Minnelli’s biggest commercial successes. The film was a slapstick vehicle crafted for television superstars Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz (on summer hiatus from I Love Lucy), who play a husband and wife traveling across America in their 40-foot trailer.\n\nBrigadoon (1954) was much more of a challenge for Minnelli. This Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe musical about a mythical land that materializes once every hundred years in the Scottish highlands was originally scheduled to be filmed on location, but MGM made Minnelli shoot it in the studio. Gene Kelly starred as the visiting New Yorker who falls in love with one of Brigadoon’s time-traveling residents (Cyd Charisse). Although it has its moments, Brigadoon failed to re-create the magic of the original, with Kelly’s decision to drop Agnes de Mille’s stage choreography proving particularly controversial. Minnelli would never again attempt a dance-oriented musical film."
