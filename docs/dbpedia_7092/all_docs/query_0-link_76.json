The Domestic Market is defined as the North American movie territory (consisting of the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and Guam).\n\nThe yearly amounts on our Theatrical Market pages are based on box office years. Each box office year starts on the first Monday of the year, so the previous year ends on the Sunday before the first Monday.
