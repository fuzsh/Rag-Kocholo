        "text": "Overview of the events of 1945 in film\n\nList of years in film\n\n+...\n\nThe year 1945 in film involved some significant events. With 1945 being the last year of World War II, the many films released this year had themes of patriotism, sacrifices, and peace.[1] In the United States, there were more than eighteen thousand movie theatres operating in 1945, a figure that grew by a third from a decade earlier.[2]\n\nTop-grossing films (U.S.)\n\n[edit]\n\nThe top ten 1945 released films by box office gross in North America are as follows:\n\nHighest-grossing films of 1945 Rank Title Distributor Domestic rentals 1 The Bells of St. Mary's RKO $8,000,000[3] 2 Leave Her to Heaven 20th Century Fox $5,550,000[3] 3 Spellbound United Artists $4,975,000[4] 4 The Valley of Decision MGM $4,566,000[5] 5 Anchors Aweigh $4,498,000[5] 6 Week-End at the Waldorf $4,364,000[5] 7 Thrill of a Romance $4,338,000[5] 8 The Lost Weekend Paramount $4,300,000[4] 9 State Fair 20th Century Fox $4,050,000[4] 10 National Velvet MGM $3,678,000[5]\n\nEvents\n\n[edit]\n\nJanuary 26 – The film National Velvet, starring Mickey Rooney, Elizabeth Taylor, Donald Crisp and Anne Revere, is released nationally in the United States.

Given its cast of 187,000 (including serving military personnel), probably fewer people watched it than appeared in it.\n\nApril 20 – Release of Son of Lassie, the 2nd Lassie film and the first film ever to be filmed using the Technicolor monopack method, where a single magazine of film is used to record all of the primary colors.
