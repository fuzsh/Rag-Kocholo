        "text": "The readers of Marcia Davenport's novel, \"The Valley of Decision,\" should not expect to find in the film that is based upon it anything like the monumental scope and pageant of human destinies that distinguished the memorable book. Nor should they anticipate a telling of even that part of the tale used in a pattern resembling the original form. A great many liberties have been taken which alter the conceptions of the book. But the general movie audience should find the screen version to its taste, for this picture, now showing at the Music Hall, has many elements of dramatic appeal.It is the story of a pretty little colleen who enters, back in 1873, the home of a Pittsburgh steel baron to serve as a \"between maid\" and eventually saves, through her devotion, the family heritage and is married to the eldest son. It is the story of this noble girl's influence upon two generations of the family Scott and of her loyalty to a tradition of which she makes herself a part.Although the early phases of the picture are rather studiously on the \"cute\" side, with Greer Garson playing the young domestic with an abundance of her familiar charm, and although the Cinderella aspects are most obvious, they do have romantic pull. The middle phases are also somewhat artificially contrived—again in a popular idiom which leaps broad psychological gaps. But the final phase, in which the ex-maid brings her great influence to bear upon the wavering second generation, does have authority and depth.Miss Garson's performance is generally one of fine attitudes, more photogenic than incisive, but that's what her audiences like. Gregory Peck is quietly commanding as the best of the Scott boys, whom she loves, and Donald Crisp makes a pleasantly imposing Pittsburgh patriarch. Gladys Cooper, Marsha Hunt and Preston Foster are attractive in other roles, while Jessica Tandy, Dan Duryea and Lional Barrymore play various villains heavily.Miss Davenport's fine American saga is barely perceived in this film, produced most extravagantly by Metro. But there is here a full romantic show.\n\nTHE VALLEY OF DECISION, screen play by John Meehan and Sonya Levien, based on the novel by Marcia Davenport: directed by Tay Garnett and produced by Edwin H.

Marshall ThompsonA tender and refreshingly simple romantic drama has been woven around a soldier on a forty-eight-hour furlough in Manhattan and his chance meeting with a lonely girl, in the new Metro film, \"The Clock,\" which opened yesterday at the Capitol. The atmosphere of the big town has seldom been conveyed more realistically upon the screen than in this picture. Much of the background footage actually was made here, and the director, Vincente Minnelli, has recorded the pulse beats of Manhattan—the roaring elevators, the screeching police sirens, the basso whistling of big boats in the Hudson, the crashing of garbage cans on the midnight pavements and all the other voices of cosmopolitan life—with electrifying effect. The sound track of this film is a composition in itself, not just a mechanical device.Robert Walker and Judy Garland, who, by the way, doesn't sing a note, are the principals. While they make a very likable pair, this corner could not help feeling that Mr. Walker, the lad from Indiana on a final leave before shipping for England, plays the country bumpkin with an overabundance of juvenile bewilderment. But the chances arc this is a reaction few of the Capitol's feminine patrons will experience. Though the boy and girl are the objects of attention, several equally arresting characters pass by from time to time. For instance, there is the soap-box type drunk in an all-night beanery, who is played to perfection by Keenan Wynn, and then there is the affectionate milkman interpreted unerringly by James Gleason.From the young couple's humorous meeting in Pennsylvania Station on a Sunday afternoon, the scenarists develop their growing attachment with a lightly sentimental touch as they whisk around the town, visiting the zoo in Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum, and meet for a dinner date under the timepiece in the Hotel Astor. New Yorkers will no doubt be amused by the ride on an open-top bus which, miraculously, zips up Fifth Avenue to the park without stopping! Mr. Minnelli has staged several passages of the film in pantomime, a technique which is not carried off too well in this instance.\"The Clock\" is the kind of picture that leaves one with a warm feeling toward his fellow-man, especially toward the young folks who today are trying to crowd a lifetime of happiness into a few fleeting hours.\n\nAt the CapitolTHE CLOCK, screen play by Robert Nathan and Joseph Schrank; based on a story by Paul Gallico and Pauline Gallico; directed by Vincente Minnelli; produced by Arthur Freed for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.Alice Maybery . . . . .

Ruth BradyWith the weather reaching the stage where anything on ice will look refreshing, the arrival at the Palace yesterday of \"It's a Pleasure!\" might indeed be welcome. But the facts don't quite fit the case. This Sonja Henie ice show is refreshing only because that pirouetting ballerina of the blades appears in Technicolor, thereby setting a precedent. And, to set another precedent and further | prove her versatility, she even sheds her skates to very fetchingly glide through a waltz with Don Loper. But there the attraction ends, for this yarn about the romantic tribuations of an exhibition skater and a pugnacious ice-hockey star is feeble and uninspired.This flaccid fable has Miss Henie worshiping Michael O'Shea, hockey star, from afar. When the latter, who, it seems, gets all his exercise bending elbows and punching the wrong people, is banned from professional hockey after a brawl with a referee, the pair team both in marriage and in an ice extravaganza. That holy union is disrupted by a combination of misunderstandings and all the standard evils from the demon rum to a designing woman. But Mr. O'Shea, a man of great moral courage, leaves his lady, who goes on to become a star. Need it be pointed out that our hero is regenerated and finally returns to his famous mate?Michael O'Shea's acting contribution is fairly elementary, but it must be said in his favor that the dialogue accorded him is hardly brilliant. And, as the hockey luminary-erring husband, his great moments are those devoted to exciting hockey sequences. Marie McDonald is beautiful and competent in the role of the other woman, while Bill Johnson, in his film debut as skating entrepreneur and her distraught husband, makes the most of a meager assignment. Miss Henie, it must be noted, takes to Technicolor as easily as she does to skates. And her whirling capers were never more varied or dazzling, especially one in which she skates to the sizzling strains of a Samba. \"It's a Pleasure!\" in short, is correct as to title only when it is ice-bound. Once it leaves the rinks, it develops weak ankles.\n\nAt the PalaceIT'S A PLEASURE: original screen play by Lynn Starling and Elliot Paul; directed by William A.

Don LoperThose zany, slap-stickers, Olsen and Johnson, are back at the same old pie-slinging, seltzer-squirting routines in \"See My Lawyer,\" which opened at Loew's State yesterday. Aided by a bevy of hapless stooges, a bucket of mud (guess what for!) and a playful pachyderm, they smear up each scene in the prescribed manner, not failing to trail a set of antediluvian gags in their wake.The plot, like the rest of the film, has a pot-luck quality which definitely is strained. It has something to do with three clientless lawyers and two comedians in need of legal advice about breaking their eleven-year night-club contract. Contact is made, pies start flying, several vaudeville acts are rung in and suddenly there is a grand finale, with Carmen Amaya, the King Cole Trio, Yvette and a group of tumblers called the Cristianis, appearing in violent and rather disjointed succession. If one of the numerous, sparkless tunes survives this mad melée, it probably will be \"Penny Arcade,\" but the most appropriate song on the list is a little ditty titled \"Take It Away.\""
