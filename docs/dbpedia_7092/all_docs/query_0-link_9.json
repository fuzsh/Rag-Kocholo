Academy Award winner Judy Garland stars with Robert Walker as a New Yorker and a GI on a 48-hour leave who meet in New York's Pennsylvania train station--under The Clock. New York, World War II. Over two whirlwind days, the impossible happens: Two strangers meet and fall in love with each other, with the City--and with its iconoclastic, eccentric inhabitants in this delightful romance.",

        "text": "A musical in spirit, if not execution. Judy Garland doesnâ€™t sing, but she might as well.\n\nJune 23, 2022\n\nAs the couple spend time together and we spend time with the couple, the film blossoms into a touching romance.\n\nJune 12, 2022\n\nIt is strictly a romance, and in every -- essential respect a safe one, safely ae disappointing and angering in the thought of the great film it might have been.\n\nJune 24, 2021\n\nThis rapturous wartime romance, starring Judy Garland and Robert Walker, is also a rowdy and tender paean to the liberating vitality of New York's public life and its chance encounters.\n\nApril 14, 2020\n\nLike all the best melodramas, it shows us how society is set up to keep our hopelessly ambiguous interior worlds in check. But all you have to do is look at Garland to feel that racing pulse beneath the skin...she knew that love is anxiety.\n\nApril 10, 2020\n\nDirector Vincente Minnelli's talents are so many-sided and generous that he turns even the most over-contrived romanticism into something memorable.\n\nFebruary 28, 2018\n\nBilled in some circles as the original Before Sunrise, Vincente Minnelli's The Clock doesn't come particularly close to reaching those hallowed grounds, but its structure and conclusion certainly make the comparison understandable.\n\nJune 22, 2017"
