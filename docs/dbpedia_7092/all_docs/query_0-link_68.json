        "text": "During Judy’s tenure at MGM, the following films were allegedly planned for her and/or she was on the filmmakers’ “wish lists.” Some of this information could be apocryphal and based solely on recollections decades later, rumors, and legends. As noted above, Judy was MGM’s top female musical star, so it stands to reason that she would be first in line for most musical roles. For instance, Judy fan Joe Pasternak was head of his own musical unit at MGM that had a friendly rivalry with the famed Arthur Freed Unit. Pasternak always wanted Judy in his films, but as she was the “property” of the Freed Unit, he rarely got that chance. It’s safe to assume that unless a film was created specifically for another star, Judy would have been his first choice.\n\nJudy’s involvement in many of the titles goes no further than simple mentions in fan magazines, usually provided by the massive MGM publicity department as part of their attempts to keep the star’s names (including Judy) in the public’s consciousness as much as possible. Many other titles (mostly in the early 1940s) were no more than ideas thrown out as possible projects for Judy and Mickey. Producer Arthur Freed was always on the lookout for ideas and stories that would make great film musicals. The result is that most of the titles listed below didn’t get past the idea stage while others actually had story outlines or screenplays written and some were made without Judy.\n\nImage: Judy with Perry Como and MGM producer Arthur Freed, April 18, 1948.\n\nBabes in Hollywood (1934) – Not to be confused with the proposed MGM film of the same name as noted below, this earlier MGM version allegedly would have included Judy and her sisters.\n\nRosalie (1937) – The MGM Music Department records show that Judy recorded “Who Knows?” for the film on August 27, 1937. The recording has not survived. The final film starred Eleanor Powell and Nelson Eddy.\n\nNational Velvet (1937) – The all-time classic 1944 Elizabeth Taylor hit was allegedly suggested for Judy around 1940.\n\nThe Sarah Bernhardt Story (circa 1937/38) – Judy would have played the young Sarah.\n\nThe Fanny Brice Story (circa 1937/38) – Not to be confused with the proposed project of the same working title in the 1950s. At this point, Judy would have played the young Brice.\n\nMolly, Bless Her ( circa 1938) – Another biopic, this time about the late, great actress Marie Dressler.\n\nThe Captured Shadow (circa 1938) – Another film for Judy, Mickey Rooney, & Freddie Bartholomew from a screenplay by F. Scott Fitzgerald based on his 1929 “Saturday Evening Post” story.\n\nAmerican Symphony & Wonder Child (both circa 1938) – Two possible titles, no other information is known aside from this blurb about Wonder Child.\n\nTopsy & Eva (circa 1938/39) – This title had a lot of mileage. The film version of the Duncan Sisters’ stage hit of the same name (a musical comedy based on “Uncle Tom’s Cabin”) was allegedly first brought to MGM by Mervyn LeRoy in the late 1930s. It was first planned to star Judy and Betty Jaynes, then in 1941 for Shirley Temple and Judy (Temple had just signed with MGM). The project was again planned to be made in the late 40s and early 50s but never was.\n\nLooking After Sandy (1939) – Another co-starring possibility for Judy and Freddie Bartholomew based on Scottish playwright Margaret Trunbull’s 1914 novel. The story centers on a girl orphan whose charms win over a rich American family (sounds similar to MGM’s 1957 Debbie Reynolds hit film Tammy And The Bachelor).\n\nValedictory (circa 1939) – In the July 1, 1939, “Independent Film Exhibitors Bulletin” magazine’s section titled “Production Section – Studio Size-Ups” it notes: An American ‘Mr. Chips’ has been gathering dust on MGM’s story shelves in the form of a yarn called ‘Valedictory,’ now being dusted as a vehicle for Lionel Barrymore, Judy Garland, and Freddie Bartholomew. This was most likely another example of the studio getting Judy’s name in the press as part of their big star build-up just before the premiere of The Wizard of Oz a month later. This title was never made into a film.\n\nSusan And God (1939) – The film adaptation of Rachel Crothers’ 1937 Broadway hit was originally going to star Greer Garson as “Susan” co-starring Fredric March with Judy playing Susan’s daughter. The film was made with Joan Crawford, March, and Rita Quigley in the daughter role.\n\nHigh School (1939) – A title suggested for a possible Judy and Mickey film.\n\nDear Old Broadway (1939) – Another title suggested for Judy and Mickey.\n\nBroadway Melody Of 1940 (1940) – Judy’s name naturally came up as this was the first entry in the “Broadway Melody” series after she had stolen the show in Broadway Melody Of 1938 with her star-making rendition of “(Dear Mr. Gable) You Made Me Love You.”\n\nThe Youngest Profession (1940) – A proposed re-teaming of Judy with Walter Pidgeon, this project about teenagers who collect autographs (and the ensuing situations they find themselves in) was made with Virginia Weidler in the lead role opposite Edward Arnold.\n\nThere They Grow (1940) – Another title suggested for a possible Judy and Mickey film, similar in theme to Babes In Hollywood (noted above).\n\nNo, No, Nanette (1940) – The 1925 Broadway hit that gave us such songs as “Tea for Two” and “I Want To Be Happy” was another title suggested for Judy and Mickey. Warner Bros. released it in 1950 as Tea For Two starring Doris Day and Gordon MacRae. It was originally adapted for the screen in 1930 and released by First National. Only the soundtrack of that early talkie survives. First National was a subsidiary of Warner Bros. making it doubtful that the rights to the property ever left the Warner lot, meaning it was just another title idea for MGM’s hot teen duo “Mickey & Judy.”\n\nFunny Face (1940) – Yet another title suggested for Judy and Mickey. The original Gershwin musical was a big hit on Broadway in 1927 starring Fred Astaire and his sister Adele. Astaire finally got to make a film version in 1957 co-starring Audrey Hepburn and featuring Judy’s great friend (and Liza’s godmother) Kay Thompson stealing the show. The 1957 Stanley Donen project was originally planned as an MGM musical but when the studio wouldn’t finance it, the cast and crew went to Paramount, producing the only “MGM Musical” made at a different studio. A sign of the times for film musicals in the late 1950s.\n\nLady Be Good (1940) – Yet another title suggested for Judy and Mickey. It made it to the screen starring Ann Sothern, Robert Young, and Eleanor Powell.\n\nThousands Cheer (1940) – Judy appeared as a guest star in the all-star finale of the 1943 version starring Kathryn Grayson, but the project was originally touted as Judy’s “first glamour role” in 1940.\n\nKathleen (1940) – Another role allegedly suggested for Judy that went to someone else, this time to Shirley Temple in 1941.\n\nThe Big Time (1940) – No relation to the working title of Judy and Gene Kelly’s 1942 hit For Me And My Gal, this project was to star Judy with Lana Turner, James Stewart, Walter Pidgeon, and Rags Ragland.\n\nStrange Things Happen in Brooklyn (1940/41) – In late 1940 and early 1941, press was sent out by MGM that they had purchased this title, written by Daniel Fuchs, as a project for Judy. One blurb said they were “negotiating” a purchase and two others said it had been purchased. All of the blurbs noted that the project was to star Judy. The project never went any further than this.\n\nThe Corporal’s Cousin Katie (1941) – Based on the title and the fact that George Murphy was planned as Judy’s costar, this title was most likely suggested as a follow-up to their 1940 teaming in the Irish-themed Little Nellie Kelly.\n\nEight Girls And A Horse (1941) – An idea to star Judy and Kathryn Grayson.\n\nPanama Hattie (1941) – RKO Studios wanted to film Cole Porter’s stage smash as Ginger Rogers’ follow-up to her Oscar-winning role in 1940s Kitty Foyle. MGM producer Arthur Freed convinced MGM studio chief Louis B. Mayer to offer a deal for both “Panama Hattie” and Porter’s other recent stage hit “DuBarry Was A Lady.” The Freed version was released in 1942 starring Ann Sothern, Red Skelton, and (briefly) Lena Horne. Panama Hattie was in production at the same time as Judy and Mickey’s Babes on Broadway, so it’s unlikely that there was any serious thought to having either star appear in the film. There were some early ideas to star the Judy and Mickey with Shirley Temple, which may have been the bait Freed used to get Mayer to purchase the property.\n\nFeeling Like A Million (1941) – A title suggested for Judy and Tony Martin. In 1937, Judy recorded a test of the song “I’m Feelin’ Like A Million” with Roger Edens at the piano, for Broadway Melody Of 1938, but the song ended up being performed by George Murphy and Eleanor Powell in the final film. It’s likely that if this film were ever made, Judy would have reprised the song.\n\nDragon Seed (1942) – Judy wanted to be in the film adaptation of Pearl S. Buck’s novel. It was made by MGM in 1944 starring Katherine Hepburn.\n\nBabes In Hollywood (1942) – Sid Silvers produced a story outline dated February 16, 1942, which places any production schedule for this project after Babes On Broadway. It was a logical next step after “the kids” conquered the barn, then the high school gym, and then the Broadway stage. Producer Arthur Freed probably didn’t give the film the green light for the same reasons he didn’t make “Very Warm For May” as noted below. This project is not to be confused with the 1934 project of the same name noted above.\n\nJumbo – This was another project that Freed wanted to make from the late 1930s into the 1950s. It was based on the 1935 stage hit “Billy Rose’s Jumbo.” Freed planned to star Judy and Mickey, then in 1948 and 1951, he planned to pair Judy with Frank Sinatra (Joseph Fields turned in a screenplay dated October 2, 1951). MGM made the film in 1962, produced by Joe Pasternak starring Doris Day, Stephen Boyd, and Jimmy Durante. Durante was in the original 1935 stage version. The 1962 film recreates his famously hysterical comedy bit of attempting to sneak Jumbo the elephant off the circus grounds. He’s stopped by a sheriff who asks “Where are you going with that elephant?” and Durante delivers the punch line as only he could: “What elephant?”\n\nThe Story of Gaby Des Lys (1943) – Freed had the idea to star Judy in a biopic of the famous French actress and dancer. Screenwriter Irving Guttman turned in a script treatment on March 12, 1943, which was followed by another treatment dated May 2, 1948, by screenwriter Robert Thoren.\n\nThe Moon Vine (1943) – Another Freed idea, based on the 1943 Broadway show written by Patricia Coleman.\n\nAnchors Aweigh (1943) – The film was produced by Joe Pasternak and released in 1945 starring Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, and Kathryn Grayson. In 1943 it was on the list of possible projects for Judy and Gene Kelly.\n\nValley Of Decision (circa 1944) – Another idea for a young Judy. It was made in 1945 starring Greer Garson and Gregory Peck.\n\nYoung Bess (circa the mid-1940s) – Judy and James Mason were early ideas to co-star in this biopic of the early life of Elizabeth I of England. MGM released an all-star version in 1953 featuring Jean Simmons (as Elizabeth), Stewart Granger, Deborah Kerr, and Charles Laughton.\n\nWeekend At The Waldorf (1944) – Judy was on an early list of possible stars for this remake of the studio’s 1932 classic Grand Hotel. This version was released in 1945 starring Ginger Rogers, Van Johnson, and Lana Turner.\n\nForever (1946) – Judy would have starred opposite her former lover Tyrone Power. On October 12, 1946, screenwriters Miriam Stuart and Robert McElwaine turned in a script for the project. It was later slated for Judy and Gregory Peck featuring songs by Rodgers & Hammerstein (this could have been connected to their interest in Judy for South Pacific as noted above).\n\nCimarron (1946) – Another Freed idea, this time a musical version of the 1931 Oscar winner for Best Picture, to co-star Judy and Gene Kelly. This version never got past the idea phase but the film was finally remade in 1960 by MGM as a straight dramatic film starring Glenn Ford, Maria Schell, and Anne Baxter.\n\nFinian’s Rainbow (1947) – The stage version opened on Broadway on January 10, 1947, and Freed immediately wanted to produce the film version starring Judy with Gene Kelly, Mickey Rooney as the leprechaun “Og” and Barry Fitzgerald as “Finian.” Later rumors claimed that Judy and Frank Sinatra would lend their voices to an animated version. Sinatra even recorded a few songs for an unrelated and ultimately aborted animation project. It was finally made as a live-action musical by Warner Bros. in 1968 starring Fred Astaire (as “Finian”), Petula Clark, and Tommy Steele (as “Og”).\n\nPride And Prejudice (1947) – Freed had the idea to make a musical version of the classic Jane Austen novel, to star Judy with Peter Lawford, Kathryn Grayson, June Allyson, and Lucille Bremer. Sally Benson (author of the Meet Me In St. Louis stories) turned in a screenplay on April 2, 1947, followed by another screenplay that was written by Sidney Sheldon dated August 12, 1947.\n\nRoberta (1948/49) – Freed wanted to produce a remake of the 1935 RKO Fred Astaire & Ginger Rogers musical. Judy would have starred with Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, and Betty Garrett. It was later produced by Jack Cummings in 1952 as Lovely to Look At starring Howard Keel, Kathryn Grayson, Red Skelton, Ann Miller, and Marge & Gower Champion.\n\nAs noted above, any filmmaker or studio preparing a musical film usually wanted Judy as a star or guest star. Even in the years when Judy’s reputation for unreliability was at its worst, filmmakers still (if only wistfully) considered her for various projects. After she left MGM and found triumph on the stage and with her Oscar-nominated 1954 film comeback in A Star Is Born, producers and directors of dramas increasingly wanted Judy for her acting abilities, and not just her singing. Her subsequent Oscar-nominated supporting role in Judgment At Nuremberg and triumph at New York’s Carnegie Hall, both in 1961, made Judy Garland a hot property, again.\n\nAs with many of the other titles listed here, some are merely rumors or conjecture – or a result of creative PR people attempting to get print space for various projects.\n\nThe following are films that Judy was allegedly in the running for at other studios/production companies before, during, and after her tenure with MGM.\n\nPhoto: Snapshot of Judy in 1952.\n\nThe Unexpected Father (Universal – 1932) – This Universal film starring Zasu Pitts is the earliest known feature film that Judy (then still Frances Gumm) was considered for. Her role was played in the finished film by Cora Sue Collins.\n\nPigskin Parade Sequel (20th Century-Fox, circa 1937) – A sequel to Judy’s feature film debut was suggested, but never made.\n\nPot O’ Gold (United Artists, 1940) – It’s reported that director George Marshall wanted to borrow Judy from MGM and co-star her with James Stewart. The film was released in 1941 starring Stewart and Paulette Goddard.\n\nClaudia (David O. Selznick, 1941) – Judy expressed interest in starring in the film version of the 1939 book “Claudia: The Story of A Marriage” and its subsequent Broadway play. The play ran from 1941 – 1943 and starred Dorothy McGuire, who recreated the title role for her film debut in the 1943 film version made by 20th Century-Fox.\n\nSaratoga Trunk (Warner Bros., 1944) – Warner Bros. supposedly wanted Judy for the lead. The film was released in 1946 starring Gary Cooper and Ingrid Bergman.\n\nThe Shocking Miss Pilgrim (20th Century-Fox, 1946) – Fox wanted Judy for the lead, eventually played by Betty Grable in 1947.\n\nThe USO Story (RKO – 1950) – Another patriotic all-star salute to the Armed Forces, this time featuring stars entertaining troops for the U.S.O. (United Service Organization). The film was never made.\n\nThe King And I (20th Century-Fox – 1950) – Fox had an exclusive agreement with Rodgers & Hammerstein as their studio of choice for any film project, especially adaptations of their stage successes. The team supposedly first came to Fox with the idea for an original musical film version of “Anna & The King Of Siam” in 1950. The project never materialized, and it’s possible this is just rumor or wishful thinking on the part of Rodgers & Hammerstein. A short while later “Rodgers & Hammerstein’s The King and I” opened on Broadway in 1951 with Yul Brynner and Gertrude Lawrence. Too quick of a turnaround to ax a Garland project in 1950 and have it reformatted for the stage, ready to open on Broadway in 1951 with a new cast, songs, and rehearsal/tryout period.\n\nJudy’s colossal success at the London Palladium in 1951 followed by even greater success at New York’s Palace Theatre in 1951/52 prompted Hollywood to consider her for several film roles that never materialized:\n\nJust For You (aka Famous) (with Bing Crosby) – The film was made with Crosby and Jane Wyman in 1952.\n\nMeet Me In New York – Sally Benson’s sequel to Meet Me In St. Louis. It’s speculated that this is the same as her 1952 screenplay titled 14 Fifth Avenue. In 1951, columnist Sheilah Graham noted that Judy would star in the Broadway version of the story.\n\nA film biography of Buddy DeSylva (with Bing Crosby)\n\nParamount wanted Judy to co-star with Bing Crosby and “Hopalong Cassidy” in a western.\n\nKiss Me Kate – made by MGM in 1953.\n\nThe Jane Froman Story – Eventually released in 1953 as With A Song In My Heart starring Susan Hayward\n\nThe Stubborn Wood (1951/1953) – Paul Henried wanted to make this film, based on the 1948 Emily Harvin novel about a husband who has his wife put in an insane asylum just to get her out of his life. That would have been interesting.\n\nDo Re Mi (1952) – Universal planned to film this at the suggestion of Garson Kanin. Kanin’s idea was to surround Judy with “passe mugs” like Edward G. Robinson and George Raft, with the added feature of guest spots by the pop stars of the day such as Peggy Lee and Jo Stafford. Kanin is quoted as listing Eddie Fisher among these names, although at the time this project was proposed Fisher was in the U.S. Army and by 1953 was making TV appearances, in uniform, as a vocalist for the U.S. Army Band. Kanin may have seen him on TV, but it’s doubtful that Fisher would have made a list of top pop stars to be featured in a film in 1952. This sounds more like a rumor, no factual documents have surfaced to verify the validity of this claim.\n\nBloodhounds Of Broadway (1952) – George Jessel wanted Judy for this 1952 20th Century-Fox musical. Mitzi Gaynor was given the role.\n\nPaint Your Wagon (1952) – Louis B. Mayer was fired from MGM not long after Judy. He attempted to make independent films, and on his list was a film version of this Lerner & Lowe musical to star Judy. That never happened, and the musical was finally made in 1969 starring Lee Marvin and Clint Eastwood. Yes, they both “sing” in this colossal film musical flop. Mayer also wanted to make The Judy Garland Story at this same time.\n\nThe Road To Bali (1952) – After Judy’s big success at the London Palladium, Paramount reportedly made an offer to Sid Luft for Judy to star with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope in the latest Road picture. Sid turned the offer down.\n\nPygmalion/My Fair Lady (Stage 1952) – In a 1952 interview, Judy mentioned that she was wanted for a proposed Broadway musical version of “Pygmalion.” That became Lerner & Lowe’s 1956 Broadway mega-hit “My Fair Lady” starring Julie Andrews and Rex Harrison.\n\nThe Fanny Brice Story (aka The Fabulous Fanny) (early 1950s) – Not to be confused with the late 1930’s MGM project title “The Fanny Brice Story.” This is the version that eventually became “Funny Girl” starring Barbra Streisand on Broadway in 1964 (and the 1968 film version). It was originally a film musical idea for Judy from producer Ray Stark, who was the late Brice’s son-in-law. The screenplay for that version was by Isobel Lennart who later adapted it for the stage musical. The project was based on the 1953 biography, “The Fabulous Fanny.” Judy’s loss was Barbara’s gain.\n\nButterfield 8 (the mid-1950s) – Judy was supposedly considered for the role eventually played in the 1960 film by Elizabeth Taylor. Taylor won the first of her two Best Actress Oscars for this film.\n\nCareless Love (mid-1950s) – A project based around the song “Frankie & Johnny.”\n\nManhattan Tower (circa 1956) – Possibly a Paramount project, based on Gordon Jenkins’ concept album, starring Judy with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope. In 1959 Jenkins and Judy would create another concept album “The Letter.”\n\nAll About Eve (20th Century-Fox – 1957) – There was talk of making a film musical version of the 1950 Oscar winner for Best Picture that starred Bette Davis and Anne Baxter. Judy would have played the role made famous by Davis; Margo Channing. “Eve” was to be played by Peggy King. Another idea consisted of having Cole Porter write the songs. All About Eve the musical made it to Broadway in 1970 as “Applause” starring Lauren Bacall, who won the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical. The book for the new show was written by previous Freed Unit wunderkinds Betty Comden and Adolph Green, with music and lyrics by Charles Strouse and Lee Adams. The show also won the Tony for Best Musical of the year.\n\nSpring Reunion (1957) – United Artists had Judy on their wish list for this project. The final film was released in 1957 with Betty Hutton playing the role of Margaret “Maggie” Brewster.\n\nThe Unsinkable Molly Brown (stage 1960) – While in London in 1960 Judy’s agents were in talks for her to possibly star in the London production of the popular musical. People have assumed that Judy was in the running for the film version, but in reality, it was this London project. Debbie Reynolds would receive an Oscar nomination for “Best Actress” for her performance in the 1964 musical (made at MGM, partly on the “St. Louis” street created for Judy’s 1944 Meet Me In St. Louis, and directed by Easter Parade director Charles Walters).\n\nA Tree Grows In Brooklyn (20th Century-Fox – 1961) – Judy was always mentioned in various talks about bringing the 1951 musical version of the famous book by Betty Smith to the screen. Judy would have played “Aunt Cissy,” played on Broadway by Shirley Booth. The musical never made it to the screen.\n\nHold Back the Dawn (stage 1961) – On March 6, 1961, Hedda Hopper reported that Judy was considering three plays: One with Dorothy Fields writing lyrics to the late Jerome Kern’s scores; a musical version of the play “Hold Back the Dawn”, and a show reportedly being written by Roger Edens. None of these were ever made.\n\nBy the Beautiful Sea (stage 1961) – On May 5, 1961, Hedda Hopper reported that Chuck Walters intended to direct Judy in the film version of the 1954 Dorothy Fields Broadway musical (not to be confused with the Fields/Kern project listed above) about a Coney Island boarding house owner in the early 1900s that had starred Shirley Booth. No film of this show has ever been made.\n\nGypsy (1962) – Judy was one of several stars mentioned for the pivotal role of “Mama Rose” the film version of Ethel Merman’s Broadway triumph. Other actresses mentioned: Merman, Judy Holliday, Ann-Margaret (as “Gypsy”). Rosalind Russell got the role.\n\nIrma la Douce (1961) – Judy was supposedly in the running for the film version of the 1960 Broadway musical. The show made it to the screen in 1963 without the songs and co-starring Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine.\n\nIt’s A Mad Mad Mad Mad World (United Artists, 1963) – Director Stanley Kramer wanted Judy to be one of the many cameos in this star-studded comedy.\n\nA Handful Of Dust (circa 1962/1963) – An alleged British independent production based on the 1934 Evelyn Waugh novel, to co-star Judy with David Niven. The book was finally adapted for the screen in 1988, featuring Judi Dench, Kristin Scott Thomas, Rupert Graves, Angelica Huston, and James Wilby.\n\nLaurette (circa, 1962) – Judy would have been amazing as the loved and respected, legendary stage actress Laurette Taylor. Director George Cukor and even the late Taylor’s daughter, Marguerite Courtney, wanted Judy for the role. The film was never made.\n\nLittle Me (Embassy Pictures – circa, 1963/64) – It was reported in contemporary papers that Judy was considered for the lead in the film version of the popular 162 musical. To date, no film of the show has been made.\n\nNew York Town (1963) – Judy was penciled in to make a guest appearance and sing “Why Was I Born” and “Chicago Can’t Touch New York” for this eventually unproduced project for Rosalind Russell, Jane Wyman, Troy Donahue, and Sandra Dee.\n\nLittle Big Man (circa, 1965/66) – Columnists listed Judy as one of the potential stars for the film version of Thomas Berger’s 1964 novel. The film was made and released in 1970 starring Dustin Hoffman and Faye Dunaway and directed by Arthur Penn.\n\nThe Night Of Generals (circa, 1965/66) – Judy was considered for a cameo in this World War II film, released by Columbia in 1967.\n\nThis Property Is Condemned (Paramount – 1966) – Judy was considered to play Natalie Wood’s mother in this film version of the Tennessee Williams play. Kate Reid played the role in the final version, released in 1966 co-starring Wood, Robert Redford, and Charles Bronson.\n\nOur Mother’s House (1967) – Jim Johnson’s website The Judy Garland Database features a promotional photo of Judy from the 1940s used in connection with this film, but nothing else is known.\n\nThe Graduate (1967) – Judy was considered for the role of “Mrs. Robinson,” played in the finished film by Anne Bancroft.\n\nBiographies of Aimee Semple McPherson & Edith Piaf (1967 & 1968) – In a March 1967 interview with Radie Harris, Judy said she wanted to play McPherson’s mother in a biopic about the evangelist. Meanwhile, George Cukor allegedly wanted Judy for a biopic of French singer Edith Piaf who was sometimes referred to as “The French Judy Garland.” Cukor intended to film Judy in concert singing songs Piaf made famous.\n\nMame (1967) – The title role of “Mame” and the role of “Mama Rose” in “Gypsy” are two roles that to this day Garland fans still talk about as being potential crowning achievements to Judy’s film career. Songwriter Jerry Herman had always wanted Judy for “Mame,” but in the late 1960s, Judy was considered too high of a liability risk due to the perception of her inability to sustain the grueling weekly schedule of a big Broadway musical. Judy had stated on a few occasions that she wanted to replace Angela Lansbury on Broadway. Judy was never seriously considered for the film adaptation, made after Judy’s death in 1974 with Lucille Ball.\n\nThe Wonderful Land Of Oz (1969) – In their January 1, 1969 issue, “Variety” reported that director Barry Mahon was negotiating to have Judy provide the narration for this film. The deal fell through, but the film was made – without narration.\n\nThe Judy Garland Story (1969) – Boston newspaper executive Ken Mayer reportedly presented his idea for a Judy Garland biopic to producer Joseph E. Levine around this time, with the intent to have Judy make an appearance in it. It’s unclear if her appearance would be as herself later in her life or as a narrator/host.\n\nA Day In The Life Of Judy Garland (1969) – A controversial project and a part of the Garland legend from Day One. In March 1969, Judy’s husband Mickey Deans entered into an agreement with European concert promoter Arne Stivell and his Music Artists of Europe company to film a documentary about Judy titled A Day In The Life Of Judy Garland. Deans would co-produce the film with Stivell. They filmed footage of Judy in concert at The King Kroner Club in Malmo, Sweden on March 23rd. Black & white footage was also filmed two days later in Copenhagen of Judy and Deans walking around town, Judy putting on make-up for her show, and other random things. Also rumored to be filmed some footage of Judy nude in her bathroom, shot with a hidden camera. After that final concert (the final concert of Judy’s life) in Copenhagen on March 25, 1969, Stivell and the footage disappeared. Legal action was taken to prevent the film from being shown (Judy and Deans owned 25% each, while Stivell owned the remaining 50%). In 1970, thirty minutes of the footage appeared on British television under the title The Last Performance. The program included color concert footage from the March 23rd concert with audio poorly replaced with the audio of the March 25th concert. Also included in the film was some of the black and white footage of Judy and Dean as noted above. After that brief appearance, the program wasn’t seen again (although it circulated among Garland collectors) until 1995 when the American show “Entertainment Tonight” aired some of the footage as part of a story about the “recently uncovered film” coming up for auction. Allegedly Judy’s daughter Lorna Luft had lawyers for Judy’s estate stop the auction. To date, the footage has not been seen since, aside from copies of some of the footage being traded among collectors over the years. Thankfully, none of that rumored nude footage has seen the light of day.\n\nIn the years since, there have been several major television documentaries and two made-for-TV movies chronicling various aspects of Judy’s life and career, with varying degrees of success. The most successful was the 2001 miniseries Life with Judy Garland featuring Emmy award-winning performances by Tammy Blanchard and Judy Davis as the young and adult Judy, respectively. To date, it’s still the best biopic ever made about the life and career of Judy Garland.\n\nThese include the 1985 PBS documentary The Concert Years which focused mainly on Judy’s post-MGM career and brought many of her 1963/64 TV series performances to the public for the first time; the two hour documentary from the Arts & Entertainment channel (highly recommended) and the 2004 PBS documentary Judy Garland – By Myself (also highly recommended and included in the extras on the Easter Parade special edition DVD). In 2011 a film project about Judy’s life, based on the 2000 biography “Get Happy” by Gerald Clarke and possibly starring Anne Hathaway as Judy was in and out of the press. Nothing has come of it yet, although it’s still mentioned from time to time. In 2019, Renee Zellweger played Judy in the film, Judy, for which her anemic performance was lauded by many and she won multiple acting awards including the Oscar for Best Actress of 2019. Read my review of this tepid film here. Hopefully, in the future, a truly great theatrical film will be made about all of Judy’s amazing career and not just one small period."
