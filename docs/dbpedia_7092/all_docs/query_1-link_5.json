        "text": "By THE NEW YORK TIMES\n\nTHE CLOCK\n\nStarring Judy Garland.\n\ntender and refreshingly simple romantic drama has been woven around a soldier on a forty-eight-hour furlough in Manhattan and his chance meeting with a lonely girl, in the new Metro film, \"The Clock,\" which opened yesterday at the Capitol. The atmosphere of the big town has seldom been conveyed more realistically upon the screen than in this picture. Much of the background footage was actually made here, and the director, Vincente Minnelli, has recorded the pulse beats of Manhattan- the roaring elevators, the screeching police sirens, the basso whistling of big boats in the Hudson, the crashing of garbage cans on the midnight pavements and all the other voices of cosmopolitan life- with electrifying effect. The sound track of this film is a composition in itself, not just a mechanical device.\n\nRobert Walker and Judy Garland, who, by the way, doesn't sing a note, are the principals. While they make a very likable pair, this corner could not help feeling that Mr. Walker, the lad from Indiana in a final leave before shipping for England, plays the country bumpkin with an overabundance of juvenile bewilderment. But the chances are this is a reaction few of the Capitol's feminine patrons will experience. Though the boy and girl are the objects of attention, several equally arresting characters pass by from time to time. For instance, there is the soap-box type drunk in an all-night beanery, who is played to perfection by Keenan Wynn, and then there is the affectionate milk-man interpreted unerringly by James Gleason.\n\nFrom the young couple's humorous meeting in Pennsylvania Station on a Sunday afternoon, the scenarists develop their growing attachment with a lightly sentimental touch as they whisk around the town, visiting the zoo in Central Park and the Metropolitan Museum, and meet for a dinner date under the timepiece in the Hotel Astor. New Yorkers will no doubt be amused by the ride on an open-top bus which, miraculously, zips up Fifth Avenue to the park without stopping. Mr. Minnelli has staged several passages of the film in pantomime, a technique which is not carried off too well in this instance.\n\n\"The Clock\" is the kind of picture that leaves one with a warm feeling toward his fellow-man, especially toward the young folks who today are trying to crowd a lifetime of happiness into a few fleeting hours."
