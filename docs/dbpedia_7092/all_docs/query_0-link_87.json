        "text": "Longines also produced a navigation watch used early in the war called the Weems,[4] named after Lieutenant Commander Philip Van Horn Weems (1889–1979). A 1912 graduate of the Naval Academy, he eventually served as a navigation instructor at Annapolis. He invented the Weems watch, which had a rotating bezel, or outer ring, calibrated from 0 to 60 seconds and could be set to a highly accurate time signal (usually by radio). A careful observer can spot Tom Hardy’s Royal Air Force pilot in the movie Dunkirk wearing a beautiful example of an Omega version of the Weems\n\nOne thing that will strike the modern viewer of WWII-era US military watches is their small size compared to later watches. The A-11 measures 30mm, whereas by the 1960s, 36mm to 38mm was the more common size for the average watch for men. Today, many wristwatches are as large as 40mm.\n\nBecause of their cost in the 1940s, watches were prized possessions. Captured enemy watches were also popular souvenirs. In Europe, the prevalence of Swiss watches due to that nation’s neutrality resulted in their introduction into the Americans military; this was to be the downfall of the American watch industry. Elgin, Waltham, and Hamilton began the shift back to manufacturing watches for the civilian market in late 1945 and early 1946. But the Swiss had a tremendous head start, and Rolex, Longines, and Omega in particular had an established reputation as precision timepieces. The expression “running like a Swiss watch” came to mean in the postwar years that a plan or event, especially a complex one, was running smoothly.\n\nWaltham was the first casualty, with the company declaring bankruptcy in 1949. Attempts to keep the company afloat and expand into other areas of manufacturing dragged on until 1957. Elgin was somewhat more successful, but by 1968, it too was closed, and the “Elgin” name was sold to different companies.\n\nHamilton was still a highly respected name among watch buyers and received military contracts to produce military watches well into 1970. Hamilton showed innovation when it introduced an electric watch powered by a battery in 1957. This model, the Ventura, had a futuristic look that captured the imagination of consumers after Elvis Presley wore one in the movie Blue Hawaii. (A reissue in quartz featured prominently in the movie Men in Black.) But this was the last great moment for Hamilton. It merged with Swiss manufacturer Buren (makers of British Army WWW as mentioned above) and in 1969 closed its plant in Lancaster. By 1974, Hamilton had been acquired by the Swatch Group, the largest watch company in the world.\n\nHamilton watches are still available today, but they are made in Switzerland. They have an entire line that strongly resembles the military watches of World War II called the Khaki Field watches. Additional Hamilton models are the Ventura and the “pilot” watch, a reproduction of a military watch Hamilton made in the early 1970s before being absorbed by Swatch.\n\nThe Swiss faced their own moment of near extinction with two separate challenges: first was the “quartz crisis” of the 1970s and early 1980s when quartz movement watches began to widely replace mechanical movements. Japanese watches rapidly displaced the Swiss in the watch field and become more popular globally. The second challenge was the rise of the mobile phone. Younger people tended to rely on the ubiquitous cellphone over watches. Given the popularity of the cellphone, watches are considered by some to be obsolete. Militaries around the world are among the last holdouts using wristwatches.\n\nWatches, once an essential part of a person’s possessions, are now chosen for fashion purposes as opposed to the functionality they provided in earlier eras. Much like other daily requirements of previous eras—fountain pens, cuff links, cigarette holders, and detachable collars—the mechanical watch still exists more out of nostalgia than need."
