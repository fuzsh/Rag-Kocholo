        "meta_description": "The Clock is a perfect film with which to celebrate Valentine’s Day. Vincente Minnelli's first nonmusical directorial effort and his fiancée Judy Garland’s first straight dramatic role grace this stylish love story about a soldier on  a two day leave who meets the girl of his dreams at Grand Central Station. The two days’ duration of the story is an adventure for both of the young lovers. Though filmed totally on Hollywood sound stages and with an excellent use of rear-projection, the film looks authentically New York.\n\n\"Vincente Minnelli has recorded the pulse beats of Manhattan — the roaring elevators, the screeching police sirens, the basso whistling of big boats in the Hudson, the crashing of garbage cans on the midnight pavements and all the other voices of cosmopolitan life — with electrifying effect. The sound track of this film is a composition in itself, not just a mechanical device.\"  Bosley  Crowther, New York Times, May 4, 1945\n\nDirected by Vincente Minnelli, United States, 1945, 90 min., b & W, Unrated\n\nFor more information:\n\nInternet Movie Database:\n\nTurner Movie Classics:\n\nTrailer:, powered by Concept3D Event Calendar Software",
