Well, is that far?\n\nNo, not very. It's only about...\n\nLook, I don't suppose you...\n\nWell, you see, I'm so new around here.\n\nI wonder, do you mind if I go a little ways\n\nwith you and sort of look around?\n\n- No. Not if you want to.\n\n- Thank you.\n\n- Say, this is a city.\n\n- Isn't it?\n\nThese buildings, the way they go right up.\n\nCloud-catchers.\n\n- Is it all like this?\n\n- More or less.\n\nFares, please.\n\nI'll bet you get a cold down-wind\n\nthrough here in the winter,\n\npile up a lot of snow, too.\n\nWe got a little gully out home and\n\nthe wind comes down there 80 miles an...\n\nFares, please!\n\n- How much is it?\n\n- Two dimes. Put them in there.\n\nI guess he thought I was trying\n\nto get away with something.\n\n- This city must seem very strange to you.\n\n- Yes, ma'am. I'm green as grass.\n\n- I suppose you've lived here all your life?\n\n- No.\n\nYou mean you're a stranger here yourself?\n\nNo, not exactly. I work here.\n\nI came here three years ago.\n\n- You got folks here, then?\n\n- No. There's Radio City up ahead.\n\nAnd Saks Fifth Avenue.\n\n- You mean you live all alone?\n\n- No. There's Saint Patrick's Cathedral.\n\n- You're not married, are you?\n\n- No. I live with another girl.\n\nWhat do you do,\n\nif you don't mind my asking?\n\n- I'm a secretary in an office.\n\n- I see.\n\nWhat kind of an office\n\ndo you work in, Miss Alice?\n\n- Gesundheit.\n\n- Thank you.\n\n- What kind of an office do you work in?\n\n- Just an office.\n\n- I guess you think I'm pretty nosey.\n\n- Yes, you are.\n\n- And I guess... I'm sorry.\n\n- Well, it doesn't really matter.\n\nGesundheit.\n\nYou're not catching cold, are you?\n\nNo. No. It's the sun.\n\nIt always does this to me.\n\nI always sneeze exactly twice,\n\nand then I'm all through.\n\n- There you are.\n\n- Hadn't you better keep it?\n\n- No. I'm all finished. Thank you very much.\n\n- All right.\n\nDon't you think you ought to get off here?\n\n- I mean, we're almost to the park.\n\n- I didn't have anywhere to go.\n\nI was just going along with you.\n\n- But if I bother you, I...\n\n- Oh, no, of course you don't bother me.\n\n- I didn't mean that.\n\n- Are you sure? Good.\n\nI just mean that this bus\n\ndoesn't go very far...\n\n- Did you say it went to the park?\n\n- Yes.\n\nYou mean they've got a park\n\nright in the middle of all this?\n\nWith trees and grass and everything?\n\nYes. I think you'd enjoy it there.\n\nThere's a lake and there's a children's...\n\nYou wouldn't care to walk just a little\n\nwith me in the park, would you?\n\nNo, that's out of the question.\n\nI can't. I've got to get home.\n\n- You mean you're in a hurry?\n\n- Yes, I'm...\n\n- Gesundheit!\n\n- Thank you.\n\nI never get tired of watching them.\n\nThey're such comedians.\n\nDid you ever stop to think\n\nhow some animals remind you\n\nso much of people you know?\n\nYes, I know exactly what you mean.\n\nWell, you take that one,\n\nthe one that just got up on the rock.\n\nI've got an aunt looks just like that.\n\nShe lives in Minnesota.\n\nYou know, it's funny.\n\nWhen I was in school, they always used to\n\ntell me I looked exactly like an owl.\n\nThat's ridiculous.\n\nYou don't look like... You do.\n\nYou look exactly like an owl.\n\nNow, let me see.\n\nWhat is it you remind me of?\n\nNever mind. I don't want to know.\n\nLook at that.\n\nThe boat's bigger than he is.\n\nKids are a great study\n\nwhen you get to know them.\n\nLive in a world all their own.\n\nHiya, Skipper.\n\nWhere did you get that boat?\n\nHey, take your hands off that boat!\n\nWho do you think you are?\n\nI don't get it. Kids usually like me.\n\nWhat a rude little boy.\n\nI don't understand.\n\nI usually get along great with kids.\n\nOut home they follow me around.\n\n- Well, I've really got to go home now.\n\n- Yeah. Well, you've been awfully nice.\n\nI've liked it.\n\nWell, I suppose I really shouldn't\n\nkeep you any longer, so, goodbye.\n\nGoodbye.\n\nIt certainly made an awful lot of difference\n\nhaving someone to talk to like this.\n\nWhat are you going to do?\n\nWell, I don't know.\n\nLet's see, what is this? 79th Street.\n\nThere's the museum over there.\n\nIt's open on Sundays.\n\nMuseum, huh?\n\nI think maybe that's something\n\nyou ought to see.\n\nYeah. Well, that's an idea.\n\nI've only been there once or twice myself.\n\nIt's a shame.\n\nI ought to go there more often.\n\nReally? Museum, huh?\n\nWe had a picture of that on the wall\n\nat school.\n\nDid you? So did we.\n\nGee, those long afternoons\n\nlooking at that thing,\n\nwishing that it were 3:00\n\nand I could get out the old bat.\n\nI know what you mean.\n\n- You know, I was just thinking.\n\n- What?\n\nI was just thinking how lucky I am.\n\n- Shall we go up and see the paintings?\n\n- Sure.\n\n- There's a bully like that in every school.\n\n- Yeah.\n\nWell, this one was tough\n\nand a lot bigger than me, too.\n\n- Were you afraid?\n\n- Well, sure.\n\nAnd half the school was watching. I had to\n\nmake up my mind in an awful hurry.\n\n- I guess so. What did you do?\n\n- What did I do?\n\nWhy, I punched that guy right in the nose.\n\nWhat's the matter, fella?\n\nHe's frightened.\n\nHe wouldn't hurt you. Would you?\n\nOh, no.\n\nNo, children usually love him.\n\nThey follow him around.\n\n- Well...\n\n- Like the Pied Piper.\n\nTo resume...\n\n- We must have walked 150 miles already.\n\n- Yes.\n\nI don't think\n\nI could ever get used to this city.\n\nAnyhow, this isn't what I want.\n\n- How do you know?\n\n- I know what I want.\n\nYou do?\n\nI want a little business of my own\n\nout home in Mapleton.\n\n- You mean you want to live there always?\n\n- That's right.\n\n- Why?\n\n- Because it's my home.\n\nI was never away from home\n\nvery much before.\n\nNot that I don't want to get around\n\nand see things,\n\nbut I don't know,\n\nI get to thinking sometimes...\n\nLike in the spring in the evenings,\n\nI can almost smell the grass\n\noutside the house.\n\nDad used to mow the lawn before dinner.\n\nHe'd never let us kids do it.\n\n- Did you have a dog?\n\n- A dog? No. Did you?\n\n- No.\n\n- Why'd you ask that?\n\n- I just wondered.\n\n- No, I didn't have a dog.\n\nI got it all figured out.\n\nAfter the war, I'm gonna be a builder.\n\n- You mean a contractor?\n\n- No. You know, like, more like a carpenter.\n\nI want to put up houses myself.\n\nThey say that houses are all\n\ngoing to be alike, made out of plastics\n\nand things like boxes you buy in a store.\n\nNot in Mapleton, they won't.\n\nWhy do you want to be a contractor, Joe,\n\nor a carpenter?\n\nI like working with wood.\n\nI like the grain and I like the feel of it.\n\nI like the idea of building things\n\nwith my own hands.\n\n- You know what I mean?\n\n- Yes, I do, I think.\n\nSome day, I'd like to build my own house.\n\nI've got a few ideas about it.\n\nAnd I've got a wonderful location\n\npicked out for it, too.\n\nThere's a piece of ground\n\nthat runs down to the creek\n\nwith two giant black walnut trees on it.\n\nI could put the house\n\nright in between those two...\n\nI know what you mean.\n\nWe've got a house like that back home.\n\nIt sits way up on a hill and you can see\n\nway out across the valley.\n\nYeah. Well, this place I've got in mind...\n\n- Is that the closing bell? What time is it?\n\n-5:00.\n\nIt's late. I've got to go.\n\nLook, Ethel, this is the one I meant.\n\n\"Sphinx of Queen Hatshepsut,\n\n\"from her Mortuary Temple\n\nat Deir el-Bahri, Thebes. Circa 1480, B.C.\n\n\"18th dynasty. Partly restored. \"\n\n- Very interesting.\n\n- Partly restored.\n\nCleopatra's Needle is restored, too.\n\nYou can see where they restored it.\n\n- Say, have we time for a soda?\n\n- Yeah, sure we have.\n\n- Come on, you guys. Get going.\n\n- Come on. Come on.\n\nYou know, you can learn a lot\n\nin a museum.\n\nIt's been a nice afternoon.\n\n- Well, I guess this is goodbye?\n\n- Yes, I guess so.\n\n- I suppose you're probably busy tonight?\n\n- Yes, I am.\n\nWell, thanks a lot for being so nice.\n\n- Would you like a cigarette?\n\n- No, thanks.\n\nThat's one of those things\n\nthat light anywhere, isn't it?\n\nIt has a shield.\n\n- Would you like it?\n\n- Oh, no. You keep it. I don't smoke.\n\n- Well, take it anyway.\n\n- I really wouldn't have any use for it.\n\nWell, I just wanted you to have it.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nWell, here comes my bus.\n\n- Maybe...\n\n- Yes?\n\n- Maybe we'll meet again sometime.\n\n- Maybe.\n\n- Well, goodbye.\n\n- Goodbye.\n\n- And thank you for the lighter.\n\n- That's all right.\n\nMy bag. Goodbye.\n\nAlice!\n\n- Alice!\n\n- Joe.\n\nWill you...\n\nJoe?\n\nAlice...\n\n- Look, will you break that date tonight?\n\n- Yes!\n\nLook, where'll I meet you?\n\nUnder the clock at the Astor at 7:00.\n\nWhere?\n\nUnder the clock at the Astor at 7:00.\n\nWhat?\n\nUnder the clock at the Astor at 7:00.\n\nI can't imagine what could have\n\nhappened to Alice. Really!\n\nShe was supposed to be home hours ago.\n\nWhat do you think\n\ncould have happened to her, Bill?\n\nI wouldn't worry.\n\nOnly she spoke to me herself\n\nfrom the station.\n\nThis isn't like Alice at all.\n\nYou get to know a person pretty well\n\nwhen you live with them.\n\nAnd there's one kid that's really got\n\nher head on her shoulders.\n\nOf course, I always feel\n\nshe's still a hick in a big town.\n\nShe's only been here three years,\n\nyou know.\n\nSay, Bill, do you think she could have\n\nstepped in to see a movie?\n\nNo. No, I think if she were gonna do that,\n\nshe'd come home first.\n\nWant to get yourself a Coke, Bill?\n\nI know. She took a couple of books\n\nto the country with her.\n\nMaybe she stopped off at the library\n\nto change them.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nBut that wouldn't take her three hours.\n\nBesides, what am I thinking of?\n\nToday is Sunday.\n\nWell, she must be somewhere, but where?\n\n- Hello, Bill.\n\n- Who's that? Alice?\n\nMy gosh, Al, where have you been?\n\nI thought you were coming right home.\n\nFreddie called up three times.\n\n- He's gonna call again in a half an hour.\n\n- I'm a little late, I guess.\n\nA little late. What happened to you?\n\nI met a soldier.\n\nWhat do you mean, you met a soldier?\n\nWell, I tripped over him at Penn Station,\n\nlost the heel on my shoe,\n\nand he helped me.\n\nAl, you're not trying to tell me\n\nyou got picked up by a uniform.\n\nPicked up!\n\nReally, Helen.\n\n- What's that you've got?\n\n- That is a lighter.\n\n- Where did you get it?\n\n- He gave it to me.\n\n- What did he do that for?\n\n- I don't know.\n\nI guess he just wanted to.\n\n- What else happened?\n\n- Nothing.\n\nWell, I guess it's all right,\n\nas long as you finally got rid of him.\n\nWell, I didn't exactly get rid of him.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nI've got a date with him tonight.\n\nGood grief, Al. I thought you had\n\nmore sense than to do a thing like that.\n\nWell, don't you know you're just\n\nheading for trouble?\n\nYou don't even know the man.\n\nAs far as he's concerned,\n\nthis is just a pickup.\n\nHelen, I wish you wouldn't keep\n\nsaying that.\n\n- Don't you think I could tell the difference?\n\n- Difference.\n\nIt's ways different.\n\nJoe's a nice boy. He's just lonesome,\n\nthat's all. He's never been to New York.\n\nSo it's \"Joe\" already. Joe what?\n\nJoe...\n\nYou don't know.\n\nLook, Al, I know you're old enough\n\nto take care of yourself,\n\nand I don't want to butt into your affairs,\n\nbut it just doesn't make sense to pick up\n\na... To make friends with a stray soldier.\n\nI know they're all swell kids,\n\nbut a girl has got to look out for herself.\n\n- Al, are you going to use that little...\n\n- No, here, you can have it.\n\nThanks. They leave you in a few days,\n\nand then what have you got?\n\nI know. It's...\n\nIt's different when you meet a serviceman\n\nthrough friends and know who he is.\n\nI'll leave it up to Bill. Am I right, Bill?\n\nListen, Alice, I've looked after you\n\nfor almost three years.\n\nYou've never done anything like this\n\nbefore, and I won't let you do it now.\n\nI just won't let you do it.\n\nHe'll be waiting.\n\nHe's gonna be awfully disappointed.\n\nHoney, he won't feel\n\nhalf as bad as you'll feel\n\nafter his leave is over\n\nand he goes back to camp.\n\n- I suppose you're right.\n\n- I am right, Alice.\n\nNow, you forget this Joe.\n\n- Freddie will be phoning in a few minutes.\n\n- Freddie.\n\nFreddie's a nice boy. He's all right.\n\nAnyway, you know his last name.\n\nWe've got to go if we want to get there,\n\nget the feature.\n\nWhere are we eating? I feel like a steak.\n\nLet's go to that little steak house\n\non 46th Street.\n\nGive my regards to Freddie.\n\nAnd remember, don't you weaken.\n\nBill, we could take the IRT and then take...\n\n- Goodbye.\n\n- Goodbye, Bill.\n\nHello?\n\nHello, Freddie.\n\nI'm sorry. Yes, Helen told me you'd called.\n\nWell, I'm almost ready. What time?\n\n- Darling!\n\n- Hello, darling. You're looking mighty cute.\n\nHere's something to top you off.\n\n- It's lovely.\n\n- How do you like that?\n\n- Here hold this.\n\n- All right.\n\n- How's that?\n\n- Down a little.\n\nNow, how do you like it?\n\n- Joe!\n\n- Alice!\n\n- Am I late?\n\n- Oh, no, no, you're not late.\n\nI was just worried about you.\n\nHere's something for your hair\n\nto top it off.\n\n- Joe.\n\n- Want me to hold your mirror for you?\n\nYes. Here.\n\nIt's beautiful.\n\nI've lived with Helen almost\n\never since I got here.\n\nWe work in the same office.\n\nShe's in the sales division.\n\nI'm in the traffic department.\n\nI have to know all about shipping\n\nand railroads and rates and everything.\n\n- Really? All that?\n\n- Yes, I do.\n\nBut you take Helen. Now, she practically\n\nruns the sales department.\n\nBill says she's practically an executive.\n\nWho's Bill?\n\nHe's a friend of Helen's.\n\nSometimes Freddie and I\n\ngo out with them.\n\nDancing and things.\n\nIt's our very best wine, Madame.\n\n- We didn't order it.\n\n- No, we...\n\nCompliments to the Corporal and his\n\ncharming companion, from the gentleman.\n\nWasn't that nice of him?\n\nYou like it, don't you?\n\nThe city and the office and everything?\n\nI love it. I never want it different.\n\n- Never?\n\n- Never.\n\nDon't you want to get married\n\nsomeday maybe?\n\nOh, that. Not for a long time, anyway.\n\nWell, what about this Freddie\n\nthat you mentioned?\n\n- Freddie?\n\n- What about him?\n\n- What about him?\n\n- Well, does that suit Freddie?\n\n- I don't know what you mean.\n\n- I mean not getting married.\n\n- I don't think I care to answer that.\n\n- I was only asking.\n\nMy goodness, I hardly know you.\n\nI don't have to answer anybody's\n\nquestions about Freddie or anything else.\n\nWell, wait a minute, now,\n\nthis Freddie doesn't mean anything to me\n\none way or the other.\n\nAll right, then, let's leave him out of this.\n\nWell, that suits me. I was only asking...\n\nI don't know why\n\nyou had to bring him up at all.\n\nLook, you brought him up.\n\nI never even heard of the guy.\n\nI think maybe I'd better go.\n\n- Look, I'm sorry if I said anything.\n\n- Helen was right.\n\nShe told me what would happen.\n\nI should have listened to her.\n\nBut I suppose I haven't got any sense.\n\nIf I had any sense, I'd have listened to her.\n\nIt's different when you meet a serviceman\n\nthrough friends and know who he is.\n\nThen you know who he is.\n\nOnly sometimes when a girl dates with\n\na soldier, she isn't thinking only of herself.\n\nShe knows he's far away from home\n\nand alone and no one to talk to and...\n\n- What are you staring at?\n\n- You've got brown eyes.\n\nThink of all the people in this city,\n\nall around us.\n\nAll the people in the country,\n\nall the people in the world.\n\nAnd out of all that, just those stars.\n\nVega and what you said.\n\nAnd you and me down here together.\n\n- That's strange, isn't it?\n\n- I don't know.\n\nIt doesn't seem strange anymore.\n\nSuppose we hadn't met.\n\nWe couldn't not have met.\n\nI know.\n\nIt's strange, though.\n\nMy coming home early from the country.\n\nThat was only a little part of it.\n\nAnd your being there in the station\n\nwhen I was.\n\nThat was part of it, too.\n\nThere were other things.\n\nLike your leaving home,\n\nmy being in the Army.\n\nGetting leave just when I did,\n\nthat's all part of it.\n\n- Even those ships in the river.\n\n- The ships?\n\nThat's part of a convoy.\n\nThat's why I got this leave.\n\nI guess it'll be the last one I'll get.\n\nI see.\n\nIt's a lot of things, isn't it?\n\nAnd some don't matter, others do.\n\nThey all matter,\n\nthis night and being together.\n\n- Yes?\n\n- They matter, don't they?\n\n- I don't know.\n\n- Alice...\n\nJoe, I don't know.\n\nIt's quiet here,\n\nalmost as quiet as it is out home.\n\nIt's never quiet, really.\n\nThe city's full of sounds.\n\nAlways underneath.\n\nListen.\n\nWe have to go.\n\nWe take the bus here.\n\nAlice, could I see you again tomorrow?\n\n- I don't know, Joe.\n\n- It's my last night.\n\nI don't know whether we ought to\n\nsee each other again at all.\n\nI thought maybe you'd want to.\n\nWell, I do but I just can't think right now.\n\n- I'm sorry, Joe. Please.\n\n- That's all right.\n\nWhere is that bus?\n\nWhat time is it?\n\n12:07.\n\n- The buses stop running after midnight.\n\n- Well, couldn't we take a taxi?\n\n- It'd be awfully expensive.\n\n- Oh, no. That's all right.\n\nHere comes something.\n\nBut that's not a taxi.\n\nSomething I can do for you?\n\nI'm sorry, mister,\n\nwe thought you were a taxi.\n\n- That's all right, Mac. You want a lift?\n\n- A lift? In that?\n\n- Sure. Why not?\n\n- Well, I don't know.\n\nThere's plenty of room.\n\nThe whole wagon's empty.\n\n- That's awfully nice of you.\n\n- Come on. Hop in. Hop in.\n\nHere, sit right here.\n\nCome on. Sit down.\n\n- Got plenty of room?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nYes, I'm afraid\n\nwe're crowding you, though.\n\nNot at all.

It was my cousin.\n\n- Oh, well...\n\n- Yeah, it was my cousin, Michael Henry.\n\nHe's clerk of the court for Judge Forbes.\n\nI was pretty sure of myself, but I thought,\n\nyou know, bringing a clerk of the court in,\n\nI'd make an impression.\n\nI don't know, though. I...\n\nI don't think it's fair to the girl,\n\na soldier getting married.\n\n'Cause he doesn't know\n\nwhat condition he's gonna come back in.\n\nHe may not even come back at all.\n\nLook, Joe, if people thought about\n\nall the things that could happen,\n\nthey'd never do anything.\n\nAin't I right, Em?\n\nWell, I think if a girl and boy love\n\neach other and want to get married,\n\nall the talk in the world\n\nain't gonna stop them.\n\nNever has yet.\n\nHey!\n\n- Well, what's the matter?\n\n- Company first.
