Wallek-Walewski Bolesław, *23 January 1885 Lviv, †9 April 1944 Krakow, Polish composer, conductor, and teacher. From 1894, at the conservatory of the Galician Music Society in Lviv, he studied piano with W. Maliszowa and W. Zellinger, and music theory and composition with S. Niewiadomski. From 1900, at the conservatory in Kraków, he studied harmony and counterpoint with W. Żeleński, piano under W. Barabasz and singing under J. Marso. Furthermore, he studied from 1903 Polish literature at the Faculty of Philosophy of the Jagiellonian University and in 1906–1907 musicology in Leipzig under H. Riemann and A. Prüfer. From 1903 Wallek-Walewski was the first conductor of the Academic Choir in Krakow. In 1915 he founded the Kraków Opera Society (active in the years 1915–1938, with a break in the years 1924 to 1930) and conducted many opera performances. From 1917 to 1919 he was conductor at the Teatr Wielki in Warsaw, from 1925 the artistic conductor of the Music Society in Kraków, in the years 1919 to 1938 the artistic director of the Kraków Singing Society “Echo.” In the years 1910 to 1917 Wallek-Walewski taught music theory at the Conservatory in Kraków, from 1930 to 1934 he led the composition class there, and in the academic year 1938–1939 he held the post of director.

Wallek-Walewski’s versatile activities as a conductor of choral ensembles, organiser of cultural institutions, composer and music critic were of great importance for the development of musical life in pre-war Krakow. He was a successful conductor, and the “Echo” men’s choir under his direction, with which he performed at numerous concerts in Poland and abroad, was one of the best amateur vocal ensembles in the country. An important cultural initiative was the founding of the Kraków Opera Society, which organized performances with the participation of outstanding singers, including A. Sari, J. Kiepura, and A. Didur. Compositional works by Wallek-Walewski primarily include vocal works, including numerous works for male choir. His compositions demonstrate a reference to impressionist music (an increased importance of instrumental colour and timbre), as well as the use of illustrative effects. reached for arrangements of folk melodies (e.g., Krakowiak. Floriańska brama). In choral or orchestral compositions there is sometimes a humorous and playful tone (Bajeczka o chorym kotku, Paweł i Gaweł). The most popular of the operas was Pomsta Jontkowa, whose libretto was a continuation of S. Moniuszko’s Halka. In the musical layer of this opera, the composer drew on highland folklore and also used short motifs from Halka.
