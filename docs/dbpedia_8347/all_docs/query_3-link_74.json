        "text": "The national awakening after the revolutions of 1848, and the related phenomenon of new operatic grammar disseminated from Russia and Bohemia to other countries of Central Europe, were the main factors in promoting a quest of musical autonomy either in Slovenia or in Croatia. In the light of the Southern Slavic people revival, the criticisms on the Italian opera and the Wagnerian Musikdrama, written by the prominent musicologist Franjo Kuhač (1834-1911), and the composer Josip Mandić (1883-1959), reveal two parallel points of view, which have not been taken into account until today. The negative judgement of Kuhač on the last works of Verdi, influenced by Wagner formulae, and the praise of Mascagni’s “Cavalleria rusticana”, are due to his ideological ‘Credo’ on folk music, as the main source in view of creating a national style for opera. However, the lack of knowledge of the true traditional music of the Italian people mislead Kuhač, who believed that popular music in Italy largely depended on opera. Nevertheless, the writing “Nova glazbena struja njemačka i sadašnji talijanski kompozitori” (New Musical Trends in Germany and Contemporary Italian Composers) is a remarkable analysis of Verdi’s and Mascagni’s oeuvres. Josip Mandić, a Croatian lawyer and musician, worked within the frame of Slovene and Pan-Slavic revival in Trieste until World War I. His opera “Petar Svačić” was played first in Trieste (1902), and then in Ljubljana (1904). He collaborated with the Triestine newspaper “Jadran”, and in 1903 he published a detailed article on Wagnerian influence on Puccini’s “Tosca”. Alike Kuhač he was attracted by the idea that a renewed national opera would have been the mainstream to affirm a South Slavic culture, no more involved with the Italian and German civilizations. In his short essay “Glazba: nekoliko refleksija” (“Music: some reflexions”), the young composer explains his personal viewpoint on the Hegelian ‘Zeitgeist’, imagined as a dialectical contrast between the spirit insight the composer, and the external driving force of styles and shapes of music. Within this frame, not only he defines the causes of the end of opera by numbers, but also the fall of “Tosca”, attributing to Puccini the bad choice of a bizarre libretto, that led him towards his own intimate style of romanza, flourished in a brilliant way in the previous opera “Bohème”. Although the reliance on the topic of Slavic national myth, readable in the libretto of the contemporary Petar Svačić, the review written by Mandić is free from ideological bias. At the same time, the author outlines the negative role of unprofessional critics in Trieste that contributed to the fiasco of Puccini’s “Tosca”.\n\nThe article discusses the notion of Polish music, the possibilities of defining that notion, establishing its scope and listing specific problems related to it. For about 150 years, writers on Polish music have expressed the conviction that it has its own distinctive stylistic and expressive character. Studies concerning the specific qualities of Polish national style after WWII have naturally linked up to Polish music history, mainly that of the 19th century. The new political and cultural situation in Poland after 1989 calls, however, for a change of perspective. We must take into account the present-day cultural situation, in which boundaries are blurred, while supra-national structures and global thinking are beginning to dominate. The paper attempts to define Polish music as a notion in contemporary discourse on history, to examine the resonance of that category, and to point to artistic phenomena which this notion may be said to describe. I will list and analyse the criteria t...\n\nIn 1830, a new theater building was opened in the Olomouc Upper square. The stable theatrical life enriched enormously the cultural life of the city and encouraged the development of publishing activities in the field of music journalism and publishing. The public debates on the artistic value of theater performances, on abilities of particular artists and on other subjects gained new quality after the 1860 October diploma because Czechs living in and around the traditional German town put pressure on theater directors and demanded Czech plays on the stage. The fights for the national repertoire on the stage of the Olomouc Provincial Theater are demonstrated in this essay in two contrary ways: at first, the introduction of Czech dramas into the German scene during the 1860s is discussed, then the intensive promotion of German operas during the 1880s and 1890s when internationally played Slavonic operas were performed in all theaters. The director Carl König (1862–1868) offered a con...\n\nAmong the wealth of German operettas, an important place is occupied by works referring to Polish subjects in their plots, or featuring Polish characters. The moral judgments passed on the persons of the drama frequently reveal generalisations concerning large communities or even entire nations. At the present stage of research, I can confirm the existence of about a dozen German operettas containing Polish motives. For my analysis, I have selected three operettas: Polnische Wirtschaft, Polenblut and Die blaue Mazur, composed in more or less the same period – the 1910s. An analysis of characters and topics recurring in these operettas proves that certain prejudices and stereotypes play a major role in the construction of events and the characterisation of dramatis personae. An important role in the creation of national stereotypes is also played by musical categories associated with Polish culture, mainly national dances – the krakowiak and the mazur. The three stage works discussed...\n\nIn the early twentieth century, New York’s Metropolitan Opera produced four works by Czech composers: Bedřich Smetana’s The Bartered Bride in 1909, Karel Weis’s The Polish Jew in 1921, Leoš Janáček’s Jenůfa in 1924, and Jaromír Weinberger’s Schwanda the Bagpiper in 1931. American critics associated these productions with exoticized notions of Czech culture and Czech nationalism. Yet, as this article shows, the four American productions also illuminate the multiethnic and multicultural environment of the Czech lands in the late Habsburg and early Czechoslovak eras. The 1909 Bartered Bride featured the famous Czech soprano Ema Destinnová and was choreographed by Czech dancer Otakar Bartík, but it was also prepared by Gustav Mahler, who presented himself as a Bohemian national in connection with the production. Weis’s The Polish Jew held an ambiguous status as a national work in Prague because it was written to a German libretto and first performed at Prague’s German Theater. The Barte..."
