        "text": "At the 5th International Contemporary Music Festival of H.M. Górecki in Kraków the lauded LutosAir Quintet together with Piotr Sleczek premiered his work \"A Song of the New Order\". The concert took place at the Manggha Museum of Japanese Art and Technology on October 24th, 2015.\n\nA Song of the New Order is an experimental piece for woodwind quintet and tape. It relates to the sonoristic works of the 20th century. The composition explores the illusory nature of the world, which manifests through constant change. The composer points to the changes that have recently happened in the world, and the consequences that will follow as a result.\n\nThe purpose of the composition is to elicit our cultural and social polarization which reflects the tendencies around the world today.\n\nThe LutosAir Quintet was born from the association of five musicians brought together by their common love for music and vision of the arts. The ensemble consists of the soloists of the Wrocław Philharmonic Orchestra: Jan Krzeszowiec, Wojciech Merena, Maciej Dobosz, Alicja Kieruzalska and Mateusz Feliński. They have been playing together in various chamber ensembles and orchestras for years. At the invitation of the Polish Institute in Leipzig, LutosAir Quintet played a concert for over a thousand listeners. In 2014 years had the honor to represent Poland in the international project MusMA (The Music Masters on Air) and during the festival Vratislavia Cantans he played polish premiers of 4 woodwind quintets from different countries. LAQ also appeared on the international festival Szalone Dni Muzyki/La Journee Follee in Warsaw, during its American edition.LutosAir Quintet is one of the ensembles of the National Forum of Music.\n\nHamlet poses the problem of whether to commit suicide as a logical question: “To be, or not to be,” that is, to live or not to live. He then weighs the moral ramifications of living and dying. Is it nobler to suffer life, “[t]he slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,” passively or to actively seek to end one’s suffering? He compares death to sleep and thinks of the end to suffering, pain, and uncertainty it might bring, “[t]he heartache, and the thousand natural shocks / That flesh is heir to.” Based on this metaphor, he decides that suicide is a desirable course of action, “a consummation / Devoutly to be wished.” But, as the religious word “devoutly” signifies, there is more to the question, namely, what will happen in the afterlife. Hamlet immediately realizes as much, and he reconfigures his metaphor of sleep to include the possibility of dreaming; he says that the dreams that may come in the sleep of death are daunting, that they “must give us pause.”\n\nThe concert will take place in the Gallery of 19th-Century Polish Art at Sukiennice, the oldest department of the National Museum. It is located in the center of the Main Market Square in Old Town Kraków. The gallery features paintings of artists such as Jan Matejko and Jacek Malczewski.\n\nAgata Zubel was born in Wroclaw. She graduated with a distinction (the medal Music Primus Inter Pares) from the Karol Lipinski Academy of Music in Wrocław after composition studies with Jan Wichrowski and voice studies with Danuta Paziuk-Zipser. In 2004 she obtained a doctorate and in 2014 post-doctorate in musical arts. She also studied in the Netherlands and took numerous courses. She is currently a lecturer on the faculty of the Academy of Music in Wroclaw.

She is also a member of the Polish Composers’ Union.\n\nAwards\n\n2014 - “Polonica Nova” Prize for the composition Not I;\n\n2014 - honourable medal “Deserved for Polish Culture”;\n\n2013 - winner of the UNESCO International Rostrum of Composers for the composition Not I;\n\n2010 - “Fryderyk” Award of the Polish music record industry in the category of Contemporary Music for the album Cascando;\n\n2009 - “Orpheus” Award of the Association of Polish Artists-Musicians;\n\n2008 - Wroclaw Music Award for the duo ElettroVoce;\n\n2005 - Wroclaw Music Award;\n\n2005 – “Passport” Award of the “Polityka” weekly for classical music for the year 2004;\n\n2005 - Special Award for the duo ElettroVoce in the International Gaudeamus Interpreters Competition in Amsterdam;\n\n2003 – 2nd Prize in the International P.J.Jurgenson Competition for Young Composers in Moscow;\n\n2003 – 3rd Prize in the International Competition for Interpreters of Contemporary Music for Professional Soloists in Nicati, Switzerland;\n\n2003 – Grand Prix of Leopold Kronenberg’s Bank Foundation in the 20th and 21th Century Music Competition for Young Performers;\n\n2002 – 1st Prize in the Krzysztof Penderecki International Competition of Contemporary Chamber Music;\n\n2002 - Special Award in the 7.Concours Moderne, Chain;\n\n2000 – 1st Prize and a Special Polish Radio Award in the National Adam Didur Competition for Composers;\n\n2000 - 3rd prize at the Competition for Composers for Classical Guitar;\n\n1999 – 1st Prize and a Special PWM Edition Award in the Andrzej Panufnik Competition for Composers;\n\nWarsaw-born Maciej Grzybowski played with Poland's distinguished Sinfonia Varsovia in 1991-92 under such master conductors as Jan Krenz, Witold Lutoslawski, Krzysztof Penderecki, and Grzegorz Nowak.
