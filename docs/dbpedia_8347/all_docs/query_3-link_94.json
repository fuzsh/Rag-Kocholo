        "meta_description": "In the 1960s, Wojciech Kilar wrote works that are part of the Polish compositional school canon, while at the same being a sought-after creator of film music. Over successive decades, he combined the two sides of his musical personality in his concert and religious music, combining symphonic panache with cinematic suggestiveness, lyricism with predatory repetitivism derived from Polish folklore, especially that of the Podhale region.",
