        "text": "The article discusses the notion of Polish music, the possibilities of defining that notion, establishing its scope and listing specific problems related to it. For about 150 years, writers on Polish music have expressed the conviction that it has its own distinctive stylistic and expressive character. Studies concerning the specific qualities of Polish national style after WWII have naturally linked up to Polish music history, mainly that of the 19th century. The new political and cultural situation in Poland after 1989 calls, however, for a change of perspective. We must take into account the present-day cultural situation, in which boundaries are blurred, while supra-national structures and global thinking are beginning to dominate. The paper attempts to define Polish music as a notion in contemporary discourse on history, to examine the resonance of that category, and to point to artistic phenomena which this notion may be said to describe. I will list and analyse the criteria t...\n\nHeld during the spring of 1927, the Beethoven Congress in Vienna was marked by the revival of the In- ternationale Musikgesellschaft, soon renamed Internationale Gesellschaft für Musikwissenshaft, today typi- cally referred to by its English name, the International Musicological Society (IMS). In 1928 Polish mu- sicologists established the Polish Musicological Society. Its objective was to integrate scholars active in Poland’s major musicological centres (such as the universities in Kraków, Poznań and Lviv), independ- ent scholars, and Polish musicologists living abroad. The enterprise was enthusiastically welcomed by the musical community, but there soon emerged difficulties in launching the planned initiative. This ar- ticle provides a concise analysis of the formation and early activities of the Polish Musicological Socie- ty in the inter-war period within the broader context of the development of musicology as an academic discipline in Poland and the founding of the IMS.\n\nThe paper provides a concise insight into the activity of Slovenian musicians residing in Sarajevo during the Austro-Hungarian administration. Besides the Slovenian musicians’ activities at the collective level, the paper discusses their individual endeavours and also endeavours from perspective of guest artists. Guest Slovenian artists such as Slovenian opera, was one of the most renowned ensemble that visited Austro-Hungarian Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nDuring periods of Austrian or Hungarian attempts to limit Croatian independence and suppress its national culture, the criteria used to evaluate arts were unconventional. For audiences, a political message of a piece was more important than its aesthetic values. A piece of music usually achieved acceptance if its subject matter was based on a patriotic theme or carried a patriotic message in the text. Periods of liberal tendencies in politics created social circumstances in which dysfunctionalization of the arts prevailed. Artists had a freedom of expression that gave the arts an autonomous life. Since Croatian patriotic expression in music was not banned during these periods, it lost its appeal to audiences.\n\nSlovenia has had a rich and varied musical histoiy, despite the fact that it was part of the Habsburg Empire and then a constituent part of Yugoslavia. Its recent smooth transition to independence and its realignment with Central Europe have been noteworthy. In the past, Slovene or part-Slovene composers such as Gallus, Tartini and Wolf worked abroad, while in the 20th century composers normally returned to Slovenia after studying abroad. For example, Marij Kogoj and Slavko Osterc studied in Central Europe and maintained a strong musical connection with Central European modernism in the 1920s and 1930s. Kogoj&#39;s strong links with Viennese expressionism were well expressed in the opera Črne maskeof 1927, while Osterc&#39;s connections with Hindemith, Honegger and others is evident in the opera Krog s kredo and orchestral works such as Mouvement symphonique. On the other hand, Kozina, Arnič and Škerjanc developed a less advanced style and kept less contact with the rest of Europe. ..."
