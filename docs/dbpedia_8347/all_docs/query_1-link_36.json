The choir prides itself on world premières of works by the most outstanding Polish contemporary composers, including Witold Lutosławski, Henryk Mikołaj Górecki, Krzysztof Penderecki and Wojciech Kilar. The choir has participated in numerous national and international festivals. The Polish Radio Choir has been permanently co-operating with the Polish Radio National Symphony Orchestra and the Polish Radio Symphony Orchestra. The management board of Polskie Radio S.A. provided the Polish Radio Choir with the long-term support for the attainment of the radio’s public mission of cultivating and popularising the musical culture of Poland as part of the world’s cultural heritage."
