        "text": "by Thomas Gablenz\n\nBiography\n\nJerzy Gablenz was born on January 23, 1888 in Cracow, an historic city and the former capital of Poland. Jerzy’s mother came from a family with roots back to the days of the Swedish invasions (1640-1660). His mother’s father earned his degree in violin performance at the Vienna Conservatory, and went on to become one of the directors of Cracow’s Conservatory of music, while at the same time his mother’s brother was becoming an accomplished violist. Jerzy’s father, an excellent pianist himself, was descended from ancestors who had emigrated from what is now Czechoslovakia and settled in the city of Lwów. At an early age a seed had been planted by his musical family. He began studying piano, then the flute, with which he reached a virtuosic level, later he learned to play the organ, and eventually the cello.\n\nAfter graduating from high school his intentions were to continue with his musical studies in Berlin, Vienna, or Paris, where the caliber of teaching was much higher at that time than in Cracow or Warsaw. Unfortunately his mother would not hear about her son leaving home at such a young age; she was afraid of bad influences and the temptations associated with big cities. It was decided that he would enroll at Cracow’s Jagiellonian University to study law – for him a very dry and unimaginative subject compared to the untamed world of music. However, alongside his university studies he continued to practice his instruments, to compose, and to engage in music history research under the guidance of many prominent people in Cracow at that time.\n\nAround 1907 he met Margaret Schoen, his future wife, whom a few years later obtained a diploma to teach piano. From this period in Jerzy’s work we have numerous compositions such as short pieces for solo piano, songs for voice and piano, a three movement suite for a string orchestra, and also attempts to experiment with more varied possibilities of sound which employed more than one instrument. It was around this time that Jerzy’s father aquired a small industrial enterprise, his aim being twofold: to invest his money in a way that would assure a source of income for his only son, and at the same time, to familiarize Jerzy with the intricacies and ways of running a business. This is an important aspect of Jerzy’s life to keep in mind because on several occasions, and in later years especially, the problems and worries concerning the factory hindered the his musical inspiration and his ability to compose. A second point of interest is that Jerzy had never prepared a list of these early compositions, possibly considering them immature. We did eventually come across a detailed record of his creations, but he had started it only after the end of World War I, and in the list he did not include every piece.\n\nEven at a reletively young age the burden of the unwelcomed university studies had already effected Jerzy’s creative powers and imagination, about which we read in his letter:\n\nI would love to improvise and write music, but my head is not free, I do not succeed in these matters. At times I sit at the piano for a moment, but all told it is very difficult since my thoughts constantly and subconsciously return to my books, my studies. Therefore, to break away from the day’s monotony I play without much sense, the consequence, I talk nonsense through the piano’s keys.\n\nRegardless of the fact that Jerzy’s father kept burdening his son with more and more responsibilities at the factory, our young musician found time to participate in many performances as a flautist with the orchestra. He regularly played the organ at Cracow’s cathedral (on many occasions four hands with his fiancee). Soon after the outbreak of World War I his father, mother and two sisters left for Vienna, leaving him in charge of everything. Since many employees had been conscripted for the war effort, Jerzy’s duties multiplied. There was less and less time for music. Nevertheless he managed to come up with a symphony in four movements, consisting of eighty-six pages of pencil sketch. The composition was never orchestrated, nor was it included in his list of his approved works. On May 5, 1917, Jerzy married Margaret. It was towards the end of that same year he composed Symphony No. 2, also in four movements, this time orchestrating it as well. Unusual is the fact that the individual movements were not separated. This work is not recorded in his list either.\n\nThe First World War ended and in the field of music the Polish public was demanding that operatic works by the traditional and nationalistic composer Moniuszko, in particular that of The Haunted Manor, be restored. Since the score was not to be found anywhere, Jerzy Gablenz was asked to reconstruct it. This he did, probably using a reduced piano version, and the opera was presented on July 2, 1919. Many years later mother wrote to me, that “the choral part of the weaving girls was so beautifully orchestrated, it was so light, a real gem. The public made such an ovation that this fragment had to be repeated.”\n\nThe critics were emphasizing his musical knowledge and experience in the field of orchestration, counterpoint entanglements, his ingenuousness in grouping instrumental sections, his obvious talent in adapting the style of instrumentation to the action on the stage. On the other hand they were questioning certain modernism, at times the orchestration was overpowering the actor’s voices, certain passages requiring more simplicity in the orchestral score. I am positive that the directors of the Opera House had underlined and approved the artistic values of their Cracovian colleague and musician, Jerzy Gablenz, prior to the performance.\n\nWe can be sure that Jerzy’s participation as a flautist in numerous opera presentations, his presence at many opera performances both in Cracow and Vienna and his success and acceptance of Moniuszko’s work prompted him to create his own opera. Bewitched Circle Opus 6, based on a stage drama by the Polish poet Lucjan Rydel, was qualified many years later by some outstanding conductors and well-known music reviewers as one of Poland’s best. It is with this four-act composition that the composer started compiling his list of approved creations. In April of 1955 “Bewitched Circle” received its world premiere, followed by approximately eighty performances throughout the following two years. The main focus in the opinions of the critics was placed on the part and employment of the orchestra, which was treated in a very symphonical manner. It was up to the orchestra to create the climate of the work, and more than often the orchestra was the factor developing action on the stage.\n\nThe creation of his opera (1919 – 1920) marked the beginning of a very prolific period during the next several years. His next large work was a suite called “Sunny Fields”, for orchestra, choir and soloists, Opus 8 and dated February 20, 1923. Unfortunately the composer never finished this work – apart from his pencil manuscript there are only sixteen pages of a finished orchestral score, corresponding to the Introduction. On July 1 of the same year he finished the tone poem The Pilgrim;, Opus 12, which requires a large orchestra, including two harps. The composition has never been performed.\n\nThe next orchestral work, left as a pencil sketch only, is “Concert Waltz”, Opus 14, dated December 1923. Three months later (March 1924) Jerzy Gablenz had completed another tone poem “In the Mountains”, Opus 17, written for orchestra and male choir. After many unsuccessful attempts this large composition was finally performed, only once, at a concert in the Dominican Republic in November of 1977. Subsequently the tape of the choral part has been utilized on several occasions during lectures and radio programs in Poland, Canada, the United States and the Dominican Republic.\n\nOn the 31st of January of 1925 the text manuscript for instrumentation of the tone poem ” Wastelands”, Opus 20 was ready. Of the pencil sketch there are about 250 final bars left to be orchestrated. The next composition in succession is the tone poem “The Legend of Turbacz”, Opus 22, dated November 1, 1925. This composition, greatly influenced by the composers’ hikes in the Carpathian mountains, was performed once during his lifetime, in 1936, and then again in 1947. In 1990 an archive recording was made by the Polish Radio, Warsaw. Precisely twenty one days after the conception of “The Legend of Turbacz”, Jerzy Gablenz had another orchestral composition ready, this time a suite entitled “To My Children – Five Miniatures”, Opus 23, consisting of five individual movements which represent in music a day in the life of small children. By then there were three of us (children) at home. This suite was performed publicly in February of the following year and conducted by the composer. An enthusiastic critic wrote: “Based on the illustrative program the individual movements show the mastery of the orchestral palette and penetration of its secrets, which the composer handles with complete knowledge and wit.”\n\nLess than six months later, on May 11, 1926, Jerzy Gablenz had his 1st Symphony (Opus 24) ready. One word of caution: this composition has nothing in common with the two symphonies mentioned previously. The performance scheduled for 1928 was canceled because of “its dissonance and technical difficulties”, plus the poor standards of Cracow’s symphony orchestra (at that time). The piano concerto in D-flat Major, Opus 25, is dated September 20, 1926. This composition received its world premiere at a concert in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic in 1977. To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the composer’s birth, the piano concerto was performed several times in Poland in 1988. Moreover, an archive recording was made by the Polish Radio in Cracow. Following the sequence of dates quoted up to now we realize how fertile was his invention to produce so much in so little time.\n\nOpus 26 was assigned to the symphonic prelude “Rosary of St. Salome”, its pencil sketch finished on January 9, 1927. Interestingly enough Jerzy started orchestrating it in the fall of the following year, complaining to his wife: “Lots of work because the strings are divided into eleven parts, everywhere plenty of figures. So far I have completed six pages.” To this day this composition has never been performed in public, however in 1991 the Polish Radio in Warsaw made an archival recording. While Jerzy was composing his large orchestral compositions he wrote sixty-nine songs for voice and piano accompaniment, a sonata for cello and piano, three tercets for female voices and piano, and other miscellaneous works.\n\nBetween the years of 1928 and 1936 Jerzy Gablenz did not compose at all. It is known from existing correspondence that around that time the factory was undergoing substantial improvements to its facilities, causing great stress and anxiety well expressed in one of his letters: “At times I sit in the evenings at the piano for a few minutes, however without any desire whatsoever to compose, because it simply does not work. I think all of this is due to hard\n\nwork and preoccupation’s at the factory, particularly with its projected enlargement.” This prolonged impasse came to its end in the first month of 1936 when “Symphonic Variations”, Opus 27 were created. It is a large work consisting of an Introduction and ten Variations. Early in 1937, and after two or three rehearsals, the composition was abandoned due to the poor quality of Cracow’s Symphony Orchestra. Two fragments, the Introduction and Variation IV, were performed in November of 1977 in Santo Domingo. In 1987, and also in Santo Domingo, the public heard the Introduction, Variations IV, VIII and X. The pencil manuscript of his symphonic prelude “Enchanted Lake”, Opus 29, carries the date of June 1937 and would become his last composition fully orchestrated, unfortunately all seven performances taking place only after his death. Once again, the Polish Radio in Warsaw made an archive recording of this composition in 1991.\n\nThere was still time for Jerzy Gablenz to write a complete pencil sketch of his next tone poem, Opus 30, although he did not leave any suggestion or hint as to what its title would be. It was the young conductor, Christopher Dziewiecki, who in 1992 undertook the instrumentation of this work. I have decided to entitle this composition “Autumn Dreams”, prompted by the fact that it was conceived in the autumn period of the composer’s life, written in November. Probably, in his sub-consciousness he felt this to be his last composition… And yet, he did not hesitate to include in it a beautiful waltz (starts on cue “K”) as if to recall in his memory so many autumnal balls, dancing with his fiancee. The persistent beating of a kettle drum at the end of the composition makes the listener realize that the beauty and glory of Summer days are gone, the Autumn is here in its sadness, the Autumn of life is approaching. “Autumn Dreams” is waiting to be performed, like several other worthy compositions of Jerzy Gablenz. On November 11, 1937, while flying from Cracow to Warsaw he lost his life when the aircraft, engulfed in low hanging clouds, hit a high tension post and crashed.\n\nSelected Works\n\nRecordings\n\nApril 1986 “Polski Nagrania” (Polish Recordings) released an LP recording (#SX1745) which included twelve songs performed by Wieslaw Ochman (tenor) and Jerzy Gaczek (piano).
