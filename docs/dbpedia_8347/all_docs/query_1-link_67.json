His compositions, including a number of operas, are not Wagnerian in subject or treatment, although he acknowledged his technical debt to his father in some respects. A number of his operas explore German fairy-story and legend, the world of the Brothers Grimm rather than that of the Nibelungen.

He began with the fiddle last year, he now plays every thing at sight; he understands fortification, building of ships and has more knowledge than I ever met with in one so young.\" He also played the organ and harpsichord. He was self-taught as a composer and when he approached Francesco Geminiani and Thomas Roseingrave for lessons they told him that he already knew all that they could teach him. He became the first professor of music at Trinity College, Dublin in 1764. Among his pupils there was Richard Woodward.

Richard (senior) outlived his son by 18 years. Richard (Junior) was presumably brought up in the Choir School and Choir of Christ Church Cathedral under George Walsh his predecessor as organist there. On Walsh's death in 1765, Woodward (at the age of 22) was appointed organist of Christ Church. He was made a Lay Vicar Choral there at the same time He was also made Master of the choristers at both Cathedrals or as his memorial at Christ Church Cathedral has it: \"Preceptor to the Children of the two Choirs, Dublin.\" . In 1770 he was appointed as a Lay Vicar Choral at St. Patricks. In 1771 at the age of 28, Woodward received the degree of Mus.D. from Dublin University; this was during the Earl of Mornington's tenure as Professor of Music there. Woodward's Op. 3, \"Cathedral Music\", is his most important publication and contains much fine music; including anthems and a Service in B flat Wooldridge, David (Humphry Michael)24 Aug. 1927\n\nDeal, Kent, EnglandEnglish composer Wooldridge, John de Lacey19191958English composer, a pupil of Sibelius and contemporary and friend of William Walton.

Earlier that year, visiting the city, the 33-year-old British officer had met the Philharmonic's music director and presented him with the score. Given the spirit of the times, Rodzinski promised the flier a performance  if he got five German kills. In August, Wooldridge cabled that the deed was done. Rodzinski cheerfully kept his end of the bargain. The war hero's work was grafted onto an all-British program featuring his more senior and accomplished countrymen Ralph Vaughan Williams and William Walton. After the War he wrote a number of film scores, His promising career ended in a fatal car accident at the age of 39 Woolf, (Sophia) Julia1831\n\nEngland1893won some fame through her piano pieces, an opera Carina (1888), and songs.
