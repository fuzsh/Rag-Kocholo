        "meta_description": "That form-creating idea led Kazimierz Serocki to invent a peculiar ‘polyphony of colors of variable density, tempo and dynamics’, which he obtained via such procedures as, among others, usage of atypical ensembles and ingenious expansion of performance techniques (especially among wind and percussion instruments).
