        "text": "SUMMARY. The marionette operas are closely connected with the Esterházy court of the 18th century as well as the work of Joseph Haydn; nevertheless they hold values for the audience of the 21st century as well. This study presents the history of marionette operas in Esterház. The focal point of the essay is an analysis of the functioning of the marionette theatre based on date, authors and works. The increasing numbers of marionette operas staged today in Hungary and the on-going explorations of the marionette theatre in Fertőd confirm the relevance of this matter. Since the genre of marionette opera lacks Hungarian academic literature, English and German publications provide the background for this study; archives, illustrated materials and musical resources of that period are further examined as well. With the use of these materials we can have an insight not only into a marionette theatre which was extraordinary in its age but an exceptional repertoire as well, for accomplished composers of the 18th century had produced works for the marionette theatre of Esterház. Keywords: Esterház, marionette operas, history of opera, Joseph Haydn, repertoire\n\nThis speech is to present the history of the first institutional and repertoire theater in Italy against the background of developments that have taken place in the italian culture after the IInd World War. Piccolo Theatro di Milano, which become established in 1947 is a great example to show how this cultural changes were influent for thinking about an artist’s need of looking for the new ways to express themselves and toughing the most important social problems in these times. It will be attempt to discuss figures of two of the most important persons for this innovational project - italian director Giorgio Strehler and italian “il dottore di teatro”, impresario Paolo Grassi. Also I would like to discuss their ideas for the new theater as for example concepts of the first national, communal and popular theatre and oppositions of a new repertoire for this institution in opposite to Carlo Goldoni’s ideas of theater. Important in this context turns out the theory of „theater du peuple” proposed in 1903 by french writer Romain Rolland, which they have developed. Phenomena of this Piccolo Teatro is a great opportunity to discuss about the role of theater in XX century and today.\n\nPolish Theatre Revisited explores nineteenth-century Polish theatre through the lens of theatre audiences. I place special emphasis on the most engaged spectators, known as “theatremaniacs” — from what they wore, to what they bought, to what they ate. My source material is elusive ephemera from fans’ lives, such as notes scribbled on a weekly list of shows in the Warsaw theatres, collections of theatre postcards, and recipes for sweets named after famous actors. The fannish behavior of theatremaniacs was usually deemed excessive or in poor taste by people in positions of power, as it clashed with the ongoing embourgeoisement of the theatre and the disciplining of audiences. Nevertheless, the theatre was one of the key areas where early fan cultures emerged, and theatremaniacs indulged in diverse fan practices in opposition to the forces reforming the theatre and its spectatorship. (publisher's description)\n\nThe following contribution aims to analyse two adaptations of Pier Paolo Pasolini’s \"Teorema\", written and directed by, respectively, Grzegorz Jarzyna and Mikołaj Mikołajczyk. In the first, \"T.E.O.R.E.M.A.T.\", Jarzyna works both on Pasolini’s novel and film, creating a performance composed of the distorted use of the voice, silent dialogues and proximity games, producing a highly conceptual effect. In his \"Wszystko jutro, czyli lalki wybawione\", Mikołajczyk, on the other hand, recreates Pasolini’s story as a choreographed drama, which examines the dilemmas posed by the Italian author."
