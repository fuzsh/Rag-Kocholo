His father was the Roman prefect in Gaul. Ambrose began his career as a political figure, becoming governor of Liguria and Aemilia about 370. On Dec. 7, 374, he was elected Bishop of Milan. One of the 4 Doctors of the Roman Catholic church, he was also canonized. Ambrose has long been credited with developing Ambrosian or Milanese chant, the introduction of hymns and antiphonal singing in the Roman Catholic Church, the authorship of the Te Deum, and the composition of hymns. However, only his composition of hymns can be verified, and he may have written only the words to the hymns attributed to him. - Born at Tier, c.339.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1662 - Davis Mell, composer, dies at 57\n\nin 1716 - John Evangelist Schreiber, composer is born.\n\nin 1731 - Francisco Morera, composer is born.\n\nin 1740 - Wolfgang Nicolaus Haueisen, composer is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1741 – Hyacinthe Azais, French composer, is born at Ladernsur- Lauquet, near Carcassonne.

[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]His career had two distinct phases: in the 1940s and 1950s he dominated the Chicago blues scene and recorded a string of R&B hits that included such boastful songs as \"I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man,\" \"Just Make Love to Me\" (aka \"I Just Want to Make Love to You\"), and \"I'm Ready\" and, from the 1960s to the 1980s,as his music was discovered by rock 'n' roll fans, he became increasingly successful as a national and international touring act while making a series of albums that either attempted to update his style or to re-create his earlier work. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Waters was the son of Ollie Morganfield, a farmer who also sang and played guitar. His mother, Berta Jones, died when he was three, after which he was raised by his maternal grandmother, Della Jones, a sharecropper, on a plantation near Clarksdale, Miss. He had a few years of grade school but was doing farm work by about the age of ten. He began playing the harmonica at seven, and he took up the guitar around the age of 17. On Nov. 20, 1932, he married Mabel Berry, but he fathered a child by another woman two years later; they separated in 1940 when he began to live with Sally Ann Adams, whom he married on Dec. 23, 1942. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]For the rest of the 1930s and into the 1940s he worked as a sharecropper, augmenting his income by playing music. In August 1941 folklorist Alan Lomax, doing field recordings for the Library of Congress, was in Miss. looking for Robert Johnson, who had died three years earlier. Instead he was directed to Waters and recorded the singer/guitarist then and on a second trip in July 1942. In May 1943, Waters moved to Chicago, where he worked at menial jobs while building up his reputation as a musician. In 1947 he made his first recordings to be commercially released under his name, the original songs \"Gypsy Woman\" and \"Little Anna Mae,\" issued as a single that spring on the Aristocrat label. In April 1948, at a second Aristocrat recording session, he recorded his compositions \"I Can't Be Satisfied\" and \"I Feel Like Going Home.\" These too were released as a single, and in September \"I Feel Like Going Home\" reached the national R&B charts. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In the late 1940s he married Geneva Wade; they remained married until her death in May 1973, although Waters had liaisons with many women and he acknowledged fathering three more illegitimate children. In June 1950, Aristocrat became Chess Records. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In January 1951, Waters scored the first of 14 R&BTop Ten hits with \"Louisiana Blues,\" his first record made with a full band. This was followed by \"Long Distance Call\" (April 1951); \"Honey Bee\" (July 1951); \"Still a Fool\" (November 1951); \"She Moves Me\" (February 1952); \"Mad Love\" (November 1953); \"I'm Your Hoochie Coochie Man\" (music and lyrics by Willie Dixon; March 1954); \"Just Make Love to Me\" (music and lyrics by Dixon; June 1954); \"I'm Ready\" (music and lyrics by Dixon; October 1954);\"Mannish Boy\" (music and lyrics by Waters, Mel London, and ElIas McDaniel [Bo Diddley]; July 1955); \"Trouble No More\" (January 1956); \"Forty Days & Forty Nights\" (music and lyrics by Bernard Roth; May 1956);\"Don't Go No Farther\" (music and lyrics by Dixon; September 1956); and \"Close to You\" (music and lyrics by Dixon; October 1958). (Music and lyrics are credited to Waters unless otherwise noted.) With his recording success, by the mid-1950s Waters was touring nationally, albeit still in clubs. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]By the late 1950s his opportunities to play had expanded further: in October 1958 he performed in England; in April 1959 he was part of a folk music concert at Carnegie Hall in N.Y.; and in July 1960 he appeared at the Newport Jazz Festival. The last resulted in an album, Muddy Waters at Newport 1960, from which \"Got My Mojo Working\" (music and lyrics by Preston Foster) was nominated for the 1960 Grammy Award for Best Rhythm & Blues Performance. Waters returned to Europe in 1962, 1963,and 1964 as part of package tours of U.S. blues performers, helping to fuel a blues revival that led to the formation of such groups as The Rolling Stones, who in turn brought his music back to the U.S.: their version of \"I Just Want to Make Love to You\" appeared on their debut album in 1964. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Meanwhile, Chess Records attempted to position Waters to take advantage of the folk music revival, and he returned to playing the acoustic guitar for the album Folk Singer, released in January 1964. With the onset of The Beatles-led British Invasion, however, he began to perform more frequently at rock 'n' roll concerts attended by young white fans than at blues venues attended by older black fans. In 1968, Chess released Electric Mud, an album on which Waters rerecorded many of his songs in a psychedelic style heavily influenced by guitar virtuosos like [imi Hendrix. Blues fans were dismayed but the album spent several months in the charts. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Abetter compromise with contemporary styles was achieved on 1969's Fathers and Sons, which found Waters accompanied by such disciples as Paul Butterfield and Mike Bloomfield and which also spent months in the charts. On Oct. 27, 1969, Waters was involved in an automobile accident that sidelined him for several months. In 1970 he earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Ethnic or Traditional Recording for his album Sail On, a resequenced reissue of his first album, the compilation The Best of Muddy Waters, originally released in 1958 and consisting of recordings made between 1948 and 1954. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]For the next ten years he was nominated for the same award nearly every year and frequently won. His first victory came in 1971 for the album TheyCall Me Muddy Waters, which contained recordings made between 1951 and 1967. He won a second time in 1972 for the newly recorded The London Muddy Waters Sessions, on which he was accompanied by such British musicians as Steve Winwood and drummer Mitch Mitchell, formerly of The [imi Hendrix Experience, and was nominated for his 1973 album Can't Get No Grindin' as well as for the 1974 album London Revisited, which also featured recordings by Howlin' Wolf. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He won for the third time for the 1975 album The Muddy Waters WoodstockAlbum, featuring members of The Band, which also reached the charts and was his final album for Chess before the company ceased to be an active label. In 1976, Waters signed to Blue Sky, a label run by Johnny Winter's manager and distributed by CBS Records. Winter oversaw his Blue Sky recordings, starting with Hard Again, which reached the charts in 1977 and earned his fourth Grammy Award. I'm Ready(1978) repeated this success, as did 1979's Muddy \"Mississippi\" Waters Live. Waters married Marva Jean Brooks on June 5,1979. His fourth and final Blue Sky album, King Bee, reached the charts in May 1981. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He earned another Grammy nomination for Best Ethnic or Traditional Recording in 1981 as part of the various artists album Blues Deluxe. He gave his final performance as a guest of Eric Clapton at a concert in Miami on June 30, 1982. After suffering from cancer in his final year, he died of a heart attack at 68 in 1983. - Died at Westmont, Ill., April 30, 1983.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1919 - Antony Tudor, England, choreographer (Metropolitan Opera 1957) is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1925 - Erna Spoorenberg[/FONT][FONT=&quot], Dutch singer is born.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1929 - \"New Moon\" musical opens in London.\n\nin 1931 - George Whitefield Chadwick, composer, dies at 76.\n\nChadwick along with Horatio Parker, Amy Beach, Arthur Foote, and Edward MacDowell, was a representative composer of what can be called the New England School of American composers of the late 19th century—the generation before Charles Ives. Chadwick's works are influenced by the Realist movement in the arts, characterized by a down-to-earth depiction of people's lives. Many consider his music to portray a distinctively American style. His works included several operas, three symphonies, five string quartets, tone poems, incidental music, songs and choral anthems. Along with a group of other composers collectively known as the Boston Six, Chadwick was one of those responsible for the first significant body of concert music by composers from the United States. The other five were Amy Beach, Arthur Foote, Edward MacDowell, John Knowles Paine, and Horatio Parker.\n\nBorn in a rural part of Lowell, Massachusetts, Chadwick received some early musical training from organ lessons given by his older brother, Fitz Henry. He developed an independent, self-reliant character early in his life. Dropping out of high school in 1871, Chadwick assisted briefly in his father's insurance business. The experience enabled him to travel to Boston and other cities, where he attended concerts and cultural events that might have initiated his lifelong interest in the arts.\n\nChadwick entered New England Conservatory as a \"special student\" in 1872, where he could study with the faculty without satisfying the rigorous entrance or degree requirements. However, he approached his studies more seriously and took advantage of what NEC offered. Chadwick studied organ with George E. Whiting (1840–1923), piano with Carlyle Petersilea (1844–1903), and theory with Stephen A. Emery (1841–1891), each of whom was well respected in the Boston music scene.\n\nIn 1876, Chadwick accepted a faculty position within the music program at Olivet College and was a valued instructor as well as administrator. While at Olivet, Chadwick founded the Music Teachers National Association. The first evidence of his interest in composing appeared during this time, from a performance of his Canon in E-flat dated 6 November 1876.\n\nRealizing that his musical career in the U.S. would be limited without further studies in Europe, Chadwick headed to Germany like many other composers of his generation. He studied in Leipzig at the Royal Conservatory of Music under Carl Reinecke (1824–1910) and Salomon Jadassohn (1830–1902). Chadwick's most significant compositions as a student there include two string quartets (no. 1 1877-8, no. 2 premiered 1879)[1] and the concert overture Rip Van Winkle. They helped confirm his position as a promising young American composer among his German contemporaries, from whom he received favorable critiques.\n\nAfter his two-year stay in Leipzig, Chadwick traveled around Europe with a group of artists who called themselves the \"Duveneck Boys\". They were led by the young and charismatic Frank Duveneck, who was well-known for his portrait works in the style of Velázquez. The group was based in Munich, then major culture center second to Paris. Chadwick also stayed in France with the group, where he was taken with the French lifestyle and influenced by the emerging Impressionist movement.\n\nChadwick resumed his compositional studies with Josef Rheinberger (1839–1901) at the Hochschule für Musik in Munich. Rheinberger was known as a skilled musical craftsman who incorporated polyphony with creativity and clarity. Thus Chadwick benefited from Rheinberger's extensive knowledge of the classics, both instrumental and choral.\n\nChadwick returned to Boston in March 1880 and soon began establishing a career in the U.S. He opened a teaching studio and secured two performances of Rip Van Winkle. Chadwick also completed his First Symphony, which although not particularly inspired was a significant early contribution by an American composer. In addition to his compositional activities, Chadwick was also a performing organist and avid conductor. He served as the Music Director of the Springfield Festival from 1890 to 1899, and of the Worcester Music Festival from 1899 to 1901.\n\nIn 1897, Chadwick was appointed Director of New England Conservatory. Known in the Boston arts circle as talented, personable, and energetic, he was crucial in transforming NEC into a respectable school of music. Chadwick implemented features that resembled those of the German conservatories of his experience. He established a variety of performing ensembles, and students were required to take more music theory and history classes. He also invited members of the Boston Symphony Orchestra as private teachers to the students, along with being an inspiring teacher himself. His students described him as \"demanding, though fair-minded and witty\".\n\nHe had some influence in the establishment of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity, which was established at the conservatory in the fall of 1898, primarily through the recommendation of the name \"Sinfonia\" after a student organization to which he belonged in Liepzig. He was named an honorary member of the Alpha Chapter at the conservatory, and was later named a national honorary member of the Fraternity in 1909.\n\n[edit] Works summary and analysis\n\nChadwick composed in almost every genre, including opera, chamber music, choral works, and songs, though he had a particular affinity for orchestral music. His music can be categorized into four style periods: (1) The Formative Period, 1879–1894; (2) The Americanism/Modernism Period, 1895–1909; (3) The Dramatic Period, 1910–1918; and (4) The Reflective Years, 1919-1931.)\n\nDuring this time, Chadwick utilized his training as a student in Leipzig, favoring sonata form, diatonic harmony, and regular phrasing and rhythms. The Symphony No. 1 in C major, Symphony No. 2 in B-flat major, and Symphony in F (No. 3) followed the four-movement outline, model after composers like Ludwig van Beethoven, Felix Mendelssohn, Robert Schumann, Johannes Brahms, and Antonin Dvořák. Nonetheless, the Second and Third Symphonies exhibit original aspects such as pentatonic scales, along with the Scots-Irish folk style in the Second Symphony.\n\nHis important early overtures are Rip Van Winkle, Melpomene, and Thalia. Set around Washington Irving's tale of the same name, Rip Van Winkle was his first orchestral work that established his claim to fame in Europe and America. Melpomene is a rich and lush work reminiscent of Wagner, and the comedy overture Thalia is imitative of Mendelssohn's light and lively style. A choral/orchestral piece, The Lily Nymph, presents a mixture of techniques borrowed from Mendelssohn and Impressionism.\n\nAmong his chamber works, the First String Quartet and Second String Quartet demonstrate a solid knowledge of developmental procedures as well as inventiveness, while the Third String Quartet (1882?-1886) displays more mastery in instrumentation. The Quintet for Piano and Strings is a lyrical work that show a melodic gift despite some awkward moments.\n\nChadwick's first work for the theatre was The Peer and the Pauper, an imitation of Gilbert and Sullivan operas which were then popular in the U.S. His \"burlesque opera\" Tabasco was an outlet for his own wry wit, featuring a humorous plot, comically-named characters, and popular-style music. It opened in New York 1894 and toured the United States for a year. The Grove Encyclopedia says it offered:\n\n\"…a veritable anthology of popular styles, including a 'Plantation Ballad', a Spanish 'Bolero', an Irish 'Ditty' and a French 'Rigaudon', most of them designed as set pieces to show off the talents of the first performers. But Chadwick also composed complex musical numbers that advance the plot and demonstrate his command of the extended finale as employed by Sullivan….\"\n\nHere Chadwick is asserting his own musical style more than previously, as in the concert overture Adonais. It includes multiple sections, muted strings, and harps to generate an ethereal quality, unconventional rhythms, and occasional chromaticism. The critic William Foster Apthorp stated, \"It is the most modern in spirit of anything I know from his pen… He has outgrown the classic idea… The very character of the thematic material in Adonais is modern, in sharp contrast to the classic reserve shown in the Melpomene overture; the expression is more outspoken, more purely emotional and dramatic.\"\n\nChadwick further delved into the symphonic genre with his Symphonic Sketches, Sinfonietta, and Suite Symphonique. All have the conventional four-movement pattern, but he created a gossamer atmosphere with humorous themes, programmaticism, modality (pentatonic melodies), and Impressionism. The orchestration contains unexpected elements such as bass clarinet cadenzas, saxophone solos, extended brass solos, and large percussion batteries.\n\nHis Fourth String Quartet, composed around the same time as Antonín Dvořák's String Quartet in F (op. 96, \"American\"), displays a more American folk style than his Fifth String Quartet, with catchy tunes and pentatonic third-movement fiddle melodies.\n\nChadwick composed more stage works, notably Judith, based on the tale from the Aprocrypha of Judith and Holofernes. The piece is melodic and exotic, much like Camille Saint-Saëns's Samson et Delilah.\n\nIn his Ecce jam noctis for chorus and orchestra composed for Yale University's 1897 commencement ceremony, Chadwick weaved in rhythmic twists like triple-meter strings against the static and homophonical chorus. Lochinvar is another distinctive choral piece with a Celtic flavor, featuring a baritone voice with a violin solo just before the \"Introduction of Strathspey\" section.\n\nDuring this period, Chadwick shifted from overtures and symphonies to a more dramatic and programmatic style. At this point, he was more interested in musical effects than in form and construction.\n\nHis two representative works are the tone poems Aphrodite and Tam O'Shanter, both for large orchestra. The compositions are both highly episodic, programmatic and well-orchestrated. Aphrodite evokes a majestic image of the sea, and Tam O'Shanter (based on the tale by Robert Burns) is a work of musical story-telling of similar caliber as some of Richard Strauss's pieces, such as the latter's Don Quixote.\n\nChadwick's most important stage work from this period is The Padrone, based on the realistic plight of Italian immigrants in the North End of Boston. It has a distinctive verismo style (realistic action integrated with a lyrical score). Although Chadwick considered this to be one of his finer works, it was not performed until 1995, when it was premiered by the Waterbury Symphony at the Thomaston Opera House.\n\nHe wrote a number of patriotic songs during World War I, including These to the Front, The Fighting Men, and perhaps his best known, Land of Our Hearts, first performed in the Norfolk Festival in June 1918, featuring a fluid syllabic setting of a poem by John Hall Ingram.\n\nBy this time, Chadwick was a highly-regarded elder musician who was no longer writing as the energetically creative artist. The Anniversary Overture to celebrate his 25th anniversary as the director of New England Conservatory was considered \"scholarly\" but warm and congenial. His output significantly declined during these years, and he was more of a musical administrator and socialite among the elite Bostonians. He remained well respected until his death in 1931, after which his works became more obscure but nonetheless considered important contributions to the American music repertoire.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]4 APRIL[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\npage 1 of 2[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]4 APRIL[/FONT][FONT=&quot]\n\npage 2 of 2[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\n[/FONT][FONT=&quot]in 1931 - Arthur Weisberg, American bassoonist and conductor, is born.

As the masterful lead vocalist of The Platters, Tony Williams merged R&B with traditional balladry on a string of elegant crossover hits in the last half of the Fifties. Trained on the gospel music of his Baptist church in Elizabeth, New Jersey, Williams later received classical voice lessons. Part American-Indian, Williams entered a series of New Jersey talent shows before winning first place at The Apollo Theater amateur night. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After a stint in the US Airforce in the Forties, Williams struggled to find work as a singer. Taking the advice of his sister Linda Hayes (who had scored an R&B hit with 'Yet I Know'), Williams relocated to Los Angeles. Arriving in 1952, Williams replaced Cornell Gunter in a struggling R&B group called The Platters. Recording at the King Records subsidiary Federal, the group fared poorly with its rough, R&B-flavoured material. Hiring manager Buck Ram, The Platters left Federal.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot] Heavily tutored by Ram, The Platters adopted a smoother, doo-... harmony sound. Also managing The Penguins (who had just scored a major hit with 'Earth Angel'), Ram convinced Mercury Records to sign both groups. Recording a new, polished version of their earlier Federal release 'Only You (And You Alone)' (1955), The Platters landed in the Top 10 and appeared in the Alan Freed film, Rock Around The Clock. Initially unhappy with Ward's choice of ballad material, Williams and his bandmates wanted to record upbeat material; hating 'The Great Pretender' (1955), Williams and The Platters were pleasantly surprised when the single became their first pop chart-topper. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The most successful R&B group of the decade, The Platters continued their strong run of enchanting ballad hits with '(You've Got) The Magic Touch', 'My Prayer', 'Twilight Time', and a definitive 'Smoke Gets In Your Eyes'. Uncredited by Buck Ram, Williams often aided in the composition of much of the group's material. The Platters' career was irrevocably harmed when on August 10, 1959, the four male members were arrested in a Cincinnati motel for having ... with women who were under 21. Although Lynch and the others were acquitted of the charges, the group never truly recovered from the scandal. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The Platters scored their final Top 10 hit in 1960 with a cover of the standard, 'Harbor Lights'. While still a member of The Platters, Williams recorded his first solo record, 'A .... Is A .... Is A .... Is A ....' (1959); surprisingly, it bombed. Beginning with the single 'Red Sails In The Sunset', Williams received additional prominence in the group which was renamed The Platters Featuring Tony Williams. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Leaving The Platters in June 1960 after multiple personality clashes with back-up singer Herb Reed, Williams was replaced in the group by Johnny Barnes, and then, Sonny Turner. With Williams' sudden departure, Ram and The Platters were sued by Mercury Records. Pursuing a solo career, Williams fared poorly with his Reprise and Philips releases. Abusing alcohol and near financial ruin, Williams rebounded after his new wife/manager regained his past royalties. Forming a competing version of The Platters, Williams spent years on the road and was especially popular in Japan. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]But after years of litigation, in July 1982 the New York Supreme Court ruled against Williams and barred him from using \"The Platters\" name. Williams eventually joined an authorised Platters group. In 1990, an appeals court cancelled Buck Ram's trademark registration of The Platters name. Though severely ill, Williams was forced by financial necessity to tour until several months before his death. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]A heavy smoker who also suffered from diabetes and emphysema, he died in his sleep at his Manhattan apartment, August 14, 1992.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1929 - Joe Meek, is born. A pioneering independent British record producer, Joe Meek is best remembered for the instrumental 'Telstar' by The Tornados. Born in Newent, close to England's border with Wales, Meek was mesmerised by electronics in his youth. After a stint as a radio technician in the Royal Air Force, he worked as a sound engineer at Britain's leading independent recording studio, IBC; here he worked on Frankie Vaughan's 1956 hit 'Green Door'. Experimenting with reverb and other innovative studio techniques, he quit the company in 1957 to launch Lansdowne Studios along with jazz producer Denis Preston. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Here Meek worked as an independent producer (a then unheard of practice in Britain) with acts such as Lonnie Donegan, Acker Bilk and Chris Barber. Leaving the studio after an argument, Meek established Triumph Records and worked at various London studios recording a series of acts, landing his first Top 10 hit in 1960 with 'Angela Jones' by Michael Cox. Utilising the money he earned from the proceeds of a Tommy Steele hit, Meek built RGM Sound studios in his North London flat. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Employing primitive, often home-made equipment in his makeshift studio, Meek worked alongside a young, prolific songwriter named Geoff Goddard and leased out master recordings to record companies. Through RGM, Meek produced two 1961 UK hits, 'Johnny Remember Me' and 'Wild Wind', for stage actor John Leyton, as well as 'Tribute To Buddy Holly' by Mike Berry & The Outlaws. Meek then transformed two of Johnny Kidd's former backing band The Pirates, and three others, into The Tornados. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The group became Meek's studio band, working behind various acts including John Leyton, Don Charles, Glenda Collins and Andy Cavell. But Meek's greatest accomplishment came with 'Telstar' (1962), a chart topper in the UK and the first ever single by a British group to top the US charts. Named after an early communications satellite, 'Telstar' was the first successful incorporation of synthesized sound into a pop hit; its melody performed on an early electronic organ, its powerful sound effects remain striking to this day. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]The Tornados would score further British hits in 1963, including the Meek composition 'Globetrotter'. Meek's other great success came with Tornados' member Heinz (Burt), who scored a number of solo British hits, including the Eddie Cochran tribute 'Just Like Eddie' (1963) and 'You Were There' (1964). Among the musicians who played on various Meek-produced records were Ritchie Blackmore, later of Deep Purple, Steve Howe, later of Yes, and bass player Chas Hodges, later one half of Chas & Dave. Meek's final major success came with The Honeycombs, whose 'Have I The Right' was a hit around the world. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Ironically, the beat boom would finish Meek who found himself unable to compete with the post-Beatle rush of British groups. Losing his key songwriter Geoff Goddard, the temperamental, homosexual Meek was beset with financial problems and he drifted into severe depression during the last two years of his life. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]He was found shot dead in his London recording studio, with his landlady, 52-year-old Violet Shenton, found nearby (though still alive, she died after reaching hospital). He had summoned her to his room and killed her with a shotgun after an argument. After shooting her, he then shot himself. Police at first charged Meek's assistant, and then singer Heinz Burt, whose fingerprints were found all over the gun. It was later learned that the gun had belonged to Heinz who had left it at Meek's studio. - Died February 3, 1967.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1934 - Stanley William Turrentine, also known as \"Mr. T\" or \"The Sugar Man\", jazz saxophonist (Wonderland) is born.\n\nTurrentine was born in Pittsburgh's Hill District into a musical family. His father, Thomas Turrentine, Sr., was a saxophonist with Al Cooper's Savoy Sultans, his mother played stride piano, and his older brother Tommy Turrentine also became a professional trumpet player.\n\nHe began his prolific career with blues and rhythm and blues bands, and was at first greatly influenced by Illinois Jacquet. In the 1950s, he went on to play with the groups of Lowell Fulson, Earl Bostic, and at the turn of the decade, Max Roach.\n\nTurrentine received his only formal musical training during his military stint in the mid-'50s. In 1959, he jumped from the frying pan into the fire when he left the military and went straight into the band of the great drummer Max Roach.\n\nHe married the organist Shirley Scott in 1960 and the two frequently played and recorded together. In the 1960s, he started working with organist Jimmy Smith, and made many soul jazz recordings both with Smith and as a leader.\n\nIn the 1970s, after his professional split and divorce from Scott, Turrentine turned to jazz fusion and signed for Creed Taylor's CTI label. His first album for CTI, \"Sugar\" proved one of his biggest successes and a seminal recording for the label. He worked with Freddie Hubbard, Milt Jackson, George Benson, Bob James, Richard Tee, Idris Muhammad, Ron Carter, Grant Green and Eric Gale, to name a few. He returned to soul jazz in the 1980s and into the 1990s.\n\nTurrentine lived in Ft. Washington, Maryland from the early 90s until his death. He died of a stroke in New York City on September 12, 2000 and is buried in Pittsburgh's Allegheny Cemetery.[/FONT]\n\n[ame=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e21Nd58LrNQ\"][FONT=&quot]YouTube - Stanley Turrentine - Sunny[/FONT][/ame]​\n\n​\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1934 - Salvatore Di Giacomo, composer, dies at 74.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1934 – Leroy Griffin, Leader of the doo-... group The Nutmegs, is born. Leroy Griffin had previously formed a series of vocal outfits in his native New Haven, Connecticut. After recording an obscure single for the tiny J&G label with The Four Haven Knights, Griffin organized The Lyres; renamed The Nutmegs, the group signed with Herald Records where they would score a pair of Griffin-penned hits in 1955 with 'Story Untold' and 'Ship Of Love'. Following Griffin's untimely death in 1966, the group continued with his nephew Harold James at the helm. While working at a steel mill, he either fell or was pushed into a blast furnace. - Died September 1966.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1935 - Emil Mlynarski, composer, dies at 64.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1935 – Peter Grant, is born. Defiant wrestler turned legendary rock manager, the gruff Peter Grant made his name as the manager of Led Zeppelin, helping to turn them into rock's biggest attraction by the mid Seventies. Grant came from a very poor background and was hardened as a child during the Nazi bombings of London. Receiving little schooling, by 13 he was working as a stagehand at the Croydon Empire Theatre, and he later took a job as a messenger boy in Fleet Street. Through his connections, Grant also appeared as an extra in the film The Guns Of Navarone, and as a body double for actor Robert Morley. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Bulking up to 250 pounds, Grant worked as a bouncer and doorman at London's earliest rock'n'roll venue, the 2Is coffee bar in Soho's Old Compton Street, and as a wrestler under the name of Prince Mario Alassio. Drawn to the music industry, the intimidating Grant then became a tour manager for visiting American rock acts such as Chuck Berry, The Everly Brothers and Gene Vincent. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Grant first visited the US as the tour manager for British Invasion act, The Animals, in whose employ he allegedly displayed extraordinary personal bravery by facing down a gunman in Arizona. By 1967 Grant had acquired a thorough grounding in the way the music industry worked and an instinctive feeling for the way cash flowed, and that year he joined forces with pop producer Mickie Most to buy out the contract of the rock group The Yardbirds from their manager Simon Napier-Bell. While Most was content to work with the group in the studio, Grant joined The Yardbirds on the road as their tour manager. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]With Grant threatening and bullying unscrupulous nightclub owners and promoters alike, The Yardbirds were finally earning good wages, a fact not lost on guitarist Jimmy Page. When The Yardbirds disbanded in July of 1968, Page recruited three others to fulfil contracted tour dates, and Grant became the manager of the new group. Originally calling themselves The New Yardbirds, Page, John Paul Jones, Robert Plant and John Bonham soon evolved into the all conquering blues rock supergroup Led Zeppelin. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After the group recorded tracks for what would be their first album, Grant flew to the US and negotiated a lucrative contract with Atlantic Records. With the fearless, intimidating and massively built Grant at the helm, Led Zeppelin were always paid in full, in cash, and stories about their legendary manager became common currency in rock circles. Once, in New Orleans, Grant spotted two US Marines making fun of Page and Plant for their long hair. \"What's your problem Popeye?\" Grant allegedly growled, picking up both Marines by the collars of their uniforms and repeatedly knocking their heads together. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Making both himself and the group rich through hit albums and constant tours, Grant alienated rock promoters in 1972 when he demanded 90 per cent of the gate receipts at all of the group's concerts. Thereafter he maintained Led Zeppelin's legendary and somewhat mystical status by shrewdly distancing them from their fans, and touring selectively as the Seventies progressed. Grant's policy of never allowing Atlantic to release a Led Zeppelin single in the UK and refusing all requests to appear on television further enhanced his and the group's uncompromising status. With Led Zeppelin given its own Swan Song subsidiary by Atlantic in 1974, Grant headed the label, signing Bad Company, whom he also managed, The Pretty Things, and former Stone The Crows vocalist, Maggie Bell. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Now weighing in at 300 pounds, Grant was joined by others in attacking an employee of promoter Bill Graham at the Oakland Coliseum in 1977. Grant and the others had beaten Jim Matzorkis to a pulp. Though arrested and later found guilty, Grant received a suspended sentence. Following the sudden death of Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham in 1980, the group disbanded and a devastated Grant, rumoured to be addicted to heroin, left the music industry. A subsequent dispute over royalties between Led Zeppelin and Grant was quietly settled. Retiring to the South Coast resort of Eastbourne, Grant became something of a recluse but he remained a legendary figure from an era when the music industry was run by trailblazing pioneers as opposed to lawyers and accountants. Towards the end of his life Grant re-emerged into the public eye, much slimmed down, and appeared at music industry functions as a benign father figure, much respected by younger managers. He suffered a heart attack in the back of a car on the way to his home in Eastbourne. - Died November 21, 1995.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1936 - John White, composer is born.\n\n[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]in 1939 – Ronnie White, is born. A founding member of The Miracles, Ronnie White was once Smokey Robinson's paperboy and had a crush on one of his sisters. A fan of jazz and doo-... music in his youth, White had first formed an informal vocal group with Smokey Robinson and Pete Moore at age 11. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]While attending Detroit's Northern High School, White joined Robinson and three others to form The Five Chimes. Renamed The Matadors, the group auditioned for Jackie Wilson's manager, Nat Tarnapol, and a budding songwriter named Berry Gordy Jr. Impressed with Robinson's original compositions, Gordy became manager of the renamed Miracles. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]With The Miracles landing local airplay with 'Got A Job' (an answer song to The Silhouettes hit 'Get A Job') and hitting the national charts with 'Bad ....', Gordy ended his practice of leasing records to other labels. The Miracles soon gave Gordy's Motown Records its first Top Five smash with the Robinson-penned 'Shop Around' (the song was initially intended for Barrett Strong). [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]After a disastrous performance at The Apollo Theater, The Miracles were one of the first recipients of Motown's artists development department. As Motown's first superstar act, The Miracles unleashed a string of usually romantic hits with 'You've Really Got A Hold On Me' (1963), 'Mickey's Monkey' (1963), a song impromptly written on stage, 'Ooh Baby Baby' (1965), and 'Going To A Go-Go' (1966). [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Also a songwriter, White usually collaborated with Robinson on the hits, 'My ....' (The Temptations), 'Don't Look Back' (The Temptations, Peter Tosh), 'One More Heartache' (Marvin Gaye), and 'You Beat Me To The Punch' (Mary Wells). Renamed Smokey Robinson & The Miracles in 1966, the group continued its run with 'More Love' (1967) and 'I Second That Emotion' (1967). Tiring of his squabbles with White, Robinson briefly disbanded the group in 1968.\n\n[/FONT] [FONT=&quot]Later announcing his retirement from The Miracles, Robinson repeatedly postponed his departure for four years, during which time the group landed on the charts with 'Tears Of A Clown' (1970) and 'I Don't Blame You At All' (1971). Replacing Robinson in 1972 with Billy Griffin (and later, his brother Donald Griffin), The Miracles managed only two more Top 40 hits including the chart-topping 'Love Machine (Part 1)'. Leaving Motown for CBS, The Miracles released two poor-selling albums before disbanding in 1978. - Died of Leukaemia in Detroit, August 26, 1995.[/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]\n\nin 1941 - Eric Burdon, England, rocker (Animals-House of the Rising Sun) is born.\n\nin 1941 - David LaFlamme, Utah, electric violinist (It's a Beautiful Day) is born.\n\nin 1941 - Dave Swarbrick, rocker (Fairport Convention) is born.\n\nin 1942 - Allan Clarke, rock vocalist (Hollies-Air That I Breathe) is born.\n\nin 1944 - Nicholas Caldwell, rocker (Whispers) is born.\n\nin 1944 - Dave Holland, heavy metal rocker (Judas Priest-Breakin' the Law) is born.\n\nin 1944 - Crispian St Peters, rocker is born.\n\nin 1944 - Willy Derby, [Dieben], singer (Hello Bandoeng), dies.\n\nin 1945 - Huldreich Georg Fruh, composer, dies at 41\n\nin 1946 - Vincent Youmans dies at age 47.

He toured Australia in 1914, after which the Elman family moved to America, and became a citizen in 1923. In 1917, he was elected to honorary membership in Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity. He sometimes performed in as many as 107 concerts in a 29-week season. In 1943, he gave the premiere of Bohuslav Martinu's second concerto, which was written for him.

Bob Hite was the co-founder of pioneering blues-rock band Canned Heat. Nicknamed \"Big Bear\" because of his 300-pound girth, Hite was a blues scholar, amassing a wealth of rare 78s during his stint as the manager of Rancho Music, a Los Angeles record shop. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Hite co-founded Canned Heat in 1966 from the remnants of an acoustic California jug band, along with guitarist, harmonica player and singer Al Wilson. Electrifying its sound, the unsigned group delivered a solid set at the Monterey Pop Festival in June 1967, and as a result of this exposure, the group was signed by Liberty Records. Their début album Canned Heat (1967) was a critical success and a moderate seller, containing blues standards such as Elmore James' 'Dust My Broom'. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]Breaking through with the follow-up release, Boogie With Canned Heat (1968), the band enjoyed their début hit single with a reworking of an old Floyd James song, 'On The Road Again', a jug-flavoured, hippy anthem. Combining psychedelic textures over a folk and blues foundation, the group became a favourite of the late Sixties flower power crowd. Their next album, Living The Blues, featured their hit single 'Going Up The Country', which borrowed the melody of Henry Thomas' blues standard, 'Bulldoze Blues'. [/FONT]\n\n[FONT=&quot]In August of 1969, a revamped Canned Heat nearly stole the show at the Woodstock festival.
