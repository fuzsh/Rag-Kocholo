        "text": "Before buying the New Grove Dictionary of Opera, make sure your back is sound enough to lift it. Next, check the sag factor in your bookcase. These are four bruising volumes, not a row of paperbacks.\n\nIf you already own the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians (20 volumes), the New Grove Dictionary of American Music (four volumes), the New Grove Dictionary of Jazz (two volumes) and the New Grove Dictionary of Musical Instruments (three volumes), I suggest you look for a bigger apartment. But if you have the room and the appetite, this newest New Grove is a feast: meat and potatoes for the serious student, dessert for the dilettante.\n\nThere is the matter of $850 to pay for it, but this latest spinoff from what has become in its minor way a major industry may be the best of the lot. It will decide arguments (and start a few), rescue the harried researcher and make critics who own a copy look as if they know what they're talking about.\n\nOpera fans are a wild and querulous bunch, and the New Grove's editor, Stanley Sadie, seems to have wracked his and other brains to avoid wrath-invoking sins of omission. From Opera Delaware to opera seria (with a chat about opera glasses somewhere in between), the latest New Grove takes on works big and small. Major ones are treated to act-by-act synopses, deposited into historical contexts and fluffed out with scholarly commentary.\n\nThere is opera in particular: one example, the history of stage machinery. The Greeks invented four kinds, and only the technology that moves them around has been improved upon. And there is opera in general: casting through the ages. Composers once wrote for particular singers; now singers stretch their talents to fit the music given them.\n\nFor the opera antiquarian, there are hundreds of short biographies of 18th- and 19th-century singers, composers, librettists, stage builders and impresarios. Age-conscious divas and divos of our own time will no longer have a place to hide. Dyed hair and girded-up loins notwithstanding, the New Grove knows when they were born, and tells all. Two appendices offer a generosity almost beyond the call of duty. One lists operatic characters and matches them to the work; another gives the first lines of arias and ensembles.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
