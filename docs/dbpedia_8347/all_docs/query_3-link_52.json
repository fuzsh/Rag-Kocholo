He gives concerts all over the world, giving dozens of solo recitals every year. He has published a number of solo CDs for Polish, German and Dutch publishers, and his recordings have been nominated, among others. to the Preis der Deutschen Schallplattenkritik. In the years 2013-2016 he was an artist in residence of the Łódź Philharmonic. Arthur Rubinstein. He serves as an appraiser for historic organs at the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage of the Republic of Poland, and also works in the Team for Historical Organs at the National Heritage Institute. Author of several dozen publications on organ music performance and organology. He is also the artistic director of the International Festival of Organ and Chamber Music in Pasłęk, the International Organ Music Days in Olkusz and the curator of the organs of the Łódź Philharmonic Hall.\n\nMartin Gester\n\nFrench conductor, organist and harpsichordist. His first musical experience was in choral singing. He then studied organ and harpsichord, receiving diplomas from the Conservatory and the University of Strasbourg in both the literature and practice of both instruments. He currently conducts musicological research and is active as a concert organist and harpsichordist. He also conducts vocal and instrumental ensembles and is active in teaching. He is particularly interested in music of the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nIn 1990, Martin Gester set up Le Parlement de Musique to bring the fruits of his research to life. This vocal and instrumental ensemble with a flexible line-up quickly won international acclaim. In addition to working with the ensemble to faithfully reproduce ancient performance practices, Martin Gester gives concerts as a soloist and, increasingly as a guest conductor, with outstanding ensembles such as The New York Collegium (concerts of French music in New York and Boston), the Nederlandse Bach Vereniging, Collegium Vocale Gent, La Chapelle Royale (in Paris), Musica Aeterna Bratislava, and the Orchestra of Savoy. As a conductor, he is a regular guest of the Polish baroque orchestra Arte dei Suonatori, with which he performs concertos and oratorios by composers from Muffat to Mozart, as well as making radio and CD recordings (for the BIS label: George Frideric Handel: 12 Concerti grossi Op. 6).\n\n. Recently, Martin Gester began a long-term collaboration with the two vocal ensembles Les Pages et les Chantres de la Chapelle Royale de Versailles (Musicians of the Royal Chapel of Versailles) and Maitrise de Bretagne (Cantors of Brittany), with whom Le Parlement de Musique performs concerts performing great French motets and other baroque choral works (Charpentier, Brossard, Gilles, Lalande, G. F. Handel, J. S. Bach) in France and around the world. Many of these concertos have been recorded for the Opus 111 label and for European radio and television channels.\n\nMartin Gester performs as soloist and conductor in Europe as well as on the American and Asian continents. He has made around 35 ensemble and soloist recordings, mainly for Opus 111, Accord, Assai and Tempéraments-Radio France. Often these are pioneering interpretations of little-known works or innovative conceptions of well-known ones. Most of the recordings have received critical acclaim. Among others, Office de Ténèbres, Pastorale, and Te Deum & Motets for Louis XIV by Charpentier, Great Motets by M. R. de Lalande, Lamentations by Alessandro Scarlatti, Organ Concertos and Tilge Höchster BWV 1083 (transcription of GB Pergolesi's Stabat Mater) by J. E. Bach, Antonio Caldara's La Conversione di Clodoveo, G. B. Bassani's Vespers, the recently discovered Froberger manuscript and the most spectacularly anonymous Uppsala Passion of 1667, which has broken the record for the number of awards in France in the last decade.\n\nMartin Gester teaches Baroque repertoire to instrumentalists and vocalists at the Strasbourg Conservatory.\n\nHe regularly gives masterclasses in France and abroad (Studio Baroque de Versailles, Jeunes Voix du Rhin, Stanford University, Academia Mexicana de Musica Antigua, etc.) His interpretations and musical visions highlight the connections between music and spaces such as rhetoric, movement, dance, theatre, declamation and oral tradition.\n\nIn 2001, the French Minister of Culture awarded Martin Gester the Order of Chevalier of Arts and Letters.\n\nArte dei Suonatori\n\n30 years ago, the musicians of the Arte dei Suonatori orchestra, founded by Ewa and Aureliusz Goliński, initiated the practice of performing music of old eras on historical instruments in Poland, becoming one of the leading Polish bands on the European music scene. After years of joint and individual experiences, the musicians' artistic searches focus on constantly exploring the essence of the musical language of composers of past eras, which, combined with historical instruments, has led to the creation of a style that is both historical, modern and thoroughly individual. The huge repertoire of Arte dei Suonatori is a collection of approximately 700 compositions, including works created from the development of baroque music to early romanticism, as well as works written contemporaneously and dedicated to him. Arte dei Suonatori has recorded and released 18 albums by renowned record companies (including BIS Records, Alpha, Channel Classics, Pentatone), distinguished by international music critics with awards such as the Gramophone Award (\"Recording of the Year: Concerto\" for Violin Concertos \"La Stravaganza\" by Vivaldi, 2003), Diapason d'Or (Harpsichord Concertos by Johann Go`ried Müthel), Diapason 5 and Choc du Monde de la Musique (multiple times), Luister 10, 10 de Répertoire, Classics Today, Classic CD , CD des Monats of the magazine \"TOCCATA-Alte Musikaktuell\" (multiple times), Monthly Choice and Editor's Choice of \"BBC Music Magazine\" (multiple times), \"Classic FM Magazine\" awards, Prelude Classical Music Awards 2009 (The Best Orchestral CD for 12 Concerj grossi op. 6 by Handel), Télérama ffff. The band performs intensively in the country, Europe, North America and Asia. He also made numerous recordings for many radio stations, including: for the BBC, Danmarks Radio (DR), SWR, Program 2 of the Polish Radio and made television recordings for the French station Mezzo, as well as TVP3, TVP Kultura, TVP1. From the beginning of its activity, the orchestra gave concerts with many of the most important figures of the world's early music scene. For several years, the ensemble has been developing a particularly satisfying and fruitful cooperation with Marcin Świątkiewicz as a soloist and conductor. In the 2023-2024 concert season, Arte dei Suonatori celebrates its 30th anniversary.\n\nTHE ORCHESTRA'S WEBSITE\n\nYOUTUBE CHANNEL\n\nPROFIL FACEBOOK\n\nArte dei Suonatori\n\n30 years ago, the musicians of the Arte dei Suonatori orchestra, founded by Ewa and Aureliusz Goliński, initiated the practice of performing music of old eras on historical instruments in Poland, becoming one of the leading Polish bands on the European music scene.

The synagogue, which has survived to this day, was built a century later. Initially it consisted of only the main hall, and later a vestibule and women's space were added. The synagogue was decorated with polychromes from the 17th and 18th centuries, but these were destroyed by a fire in the late 19th century. During World War II, the synagogue was destroyed, sharing the tragic fate of the local Jewish community. After the war, the building was transformed into a warehouse and cinema, and then renovated between 1978 and 1981, adapting it to the function of a community centre. Today, after extensive revitalisation, the synagogue houses an exhibition on the history of the local Jewish community."
