        "text": "This thesis deals with the evolution of party-based Euroscepticism in the Czech Republic. It will be investigated whether the four main Czech political parties (ODS, ČSSD, KSČM and KDU-ČSL) have evolved towards more Eurosceptic parties since 1989. The main question is as follows: How did the attitudes of the main Czech political parties towards the European Union evolve? Was there an evolution towards Euroscepticism? The aim of this investigation is to describe and understand the attitudes towards the EU in the Czech Republic from 1989 on. It has to be seen whether Czech Euroscepticism differs significantly from the main conceptualisation of Euroscepticism. Furthermore, the aim is to investigate whether Czech Euroscepticism is a fact or a myth. The question which is connected to this, is: “is it justified to see the Czech Republic as one of the most Eurosceptic countries?” The aim is also to observe in how far Communist legacy plays a part in the attitudes towards the EU. With other words: do the main political parties, and especially the Eurosceptic ones, compare the EU with the Communist regime of 1948-1989? It will be also seen what the possible explanatory factors are of party-based Euroscepticism. Although this is almost an investigation in itself, I tried to assess and discover the explanatory factors. The investigation is based on analyses of the political party programs for the parliamentary elections and manifestos from 1989 until 2010. Furthermore, interviews have been taken with Czech politicians. Based on this information, it will be concluded whether an evolution towards Euroscepticism has taken place among the political parties. Suggestions for further investigation and my own criticisms on my investigations are also mentioned in the Conclusion."
