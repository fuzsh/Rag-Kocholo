        "text": "2.1. Characteristics of innovation\n\nAccording to broad approach, innovation means any change in social life (Valenta, 2001). Innovation can be represented by a new way of working, which results in a positive change (Gallo, 2011). Therefore, innovation in business practice is a narrow segment. According to OECD innovation goes far beyond R&D. It goes far beyond the confines of research labs to users, suppliers, and consumers everywhere—in government, business, and nonprofit organizations, across borders, across sectors, and across institutions. Scholars define innovation as a creative process of devising a useful product, service, or mode of action from a pure concept located within a company (Bogdanienko et al., 2004; Amabile et al., 1996). Anything new may be perceived as innovation, if its qualities or attributes distinguish it from its existing counterparts (Burnett, 1953; Damanpour, 1991). Drucker (1993) claims that innovation is a specific tool of entrepreneurs, the means by which they exploit change as an opportunity for a different business or a different service. Entrepreneurs need to search purposefully for the sources of innovation, the changes, and their symptoms that indicate opportunities for successful innovation. The innovation equation model considers creativity as generating an idea and risk-taking as taking action on the idea, innovation = creativity + risk-taking (Pearl, 2011). Innovations are beneficial for enterprises as well as for customers in terms of value for customer.\n\n2.2. Different classification models used for discussing innovation types\n\nThe Oslo Manual, developed jointly by Eurostat and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), provides a framework to enable innovation measurement. The manual proposes innovation types of:\n\nproduct (good or service that is new or significantly improved; this includes significant improvements in technical specifications, components and materials, software in the product, user friendliness, or other functional characteristics);\n\nprocess (a new or significantly improved production or delivery method. This includes significant changes in techniques, equipment, and/or software);\n\nmarketing methods (a new marketing method involving significant changes in product design or packaging, product placement, product promotion, or pricing);\n\na new organizational method in business practices, workplace organization, or external relations.\n\nInnovations may also be classified according to “type.” Schumpeter (1934) distinguished between five different types: new products, new methods of production, new sources of supply, the exploitation of new markets, and new ways to organize business. In economics, most of the focus has been on the first two types. The terms “product innovation”’ and “process innovation” have been used to characterize the occurrence of new or improved goods and services and improvements in the ways to produce these good and services, respectively. However, the focus on product and process innovations, although useful for the analysis of some issues, should not lead us to ignore other important aspects of innovation.\n\nConsidering originality Kuratko (2009) distinguishes four types of innovations: invention (a totally new product, service or process), extension (new use of or different application of an already existing product, service, or process), duplication (creative replication of an existing concept), and synthesis (combination of existing concepts and factors into a new formulation or use).\n\nClassification of the Slovak researcher Valenta (2001) introduced eight types of innovations from the zero level to the seventh level:\n\ninnovations of the zero level: generation of initial properties,\n\ninnovations of the first level: the simple target adaptation to quantitative requirements while preserving the functions of a business system or its parts,\n\ninnovations of the second level: regrouping or organizational change,\n\ninnovations of the third level: adaptation changes,\n\ninnovations of the fourth level: the elementary qualitative change\n\ninnovations of the fifth level: higher qualitative change of functional properties of system or its parts,\n\ninnovations of the sixth level: qualitative change of functional properties of a business system or its part.\n\ninnovations of the seventh level: the highest radical change of functional properties of a business system or its part changing its basic functional principle.\n\nAccording to Albury (2005), successful innovation is the creation and implementation of new process, products, services, and methods of delivery which result in significant improvements in outcomes, efficiency, effectiveness, or quality. However, current experts suggest that in order to gain competitive success, business needs to be able to effectively implement, monitor, and measure the innovation process (Hassanien and Dale, 2013).\n\n3.1. Innovation measurement at the enterprise level\n\nWhile measuring innovation at the enterprise level it is necessary to distinguish two other levels. One measurement of business innovations is realized by the Czech Statistical Office and the second one is worked out by enterprises alone. Czech Statistical Office monitors innovations according to the Oslo Manual 2005. The manual was developed on the basis of OECD initiative. The same method of measurement has been used in all the EU member states. The main sense of using identical statistical data gathering lies in obtaining comparable data about innovation environment and innovation activities in businesses with the whole European Union. According to Oslo Manual 2005, innovations are divided into technical and nontechnical innovations—see according to actualized methodology of EUROSTAT, in 2010 enterprise that introduced product or process innovation or had continuing or had interrupted innovation activities (technical innovations), or introduced marketing, or organizational innovation (nontechnical innovation) is considered to be innovative enterprise. The Czech Statistical Office that realizes statistical gathering in two years’ cycles found out that between 2004 and 2012 the share of innovative enterprises in the whole group of enterprises was around 50% which means that each second enterprise innovated, see Figure 1 and Table 1.\n\nBlocks Dimensions Indicators Technical innovations Product innovations Introduction of a good or service that is new or significantly improved with respect to its characteristics or intended uses. This includes significant improvements in technical specifications, components and materials, incorporated software, user friendliness, or other functional characteristics. Product innovations can utilize new knowledge or technologies, or can be based on new uses or combinations of existing knowledge and technologies. Process innovation Implementation of a new or significantly improved production or delivery method. This includes significant changes in techniques, equipment and/or software. Process innovations can be intended to decrease unit costs of production or delivery, to increase quality, or to produce or deliver new or significantly improved products. Nontechnical innovation Organizational innovation Implementation of a new organizational method in the firm&#0x2019;s business practices, workplace organization, or external relations. Marketing innovation Implementation of a new marketing method involving significant changes in product design or packaging, product placement, product promotion, or pricing.\n\nThe Czech Republic first worked out statistical innovation survey in 2002 in the framework of being a new member of European Union. In European Union, the first statistical survey focused on innovations was worked out in 1993. In the Czech Republic, seven surveys about innovations were carried out, while some changes in methodology of gathering the data appeared. Last survey covered period 2010–2012. The period of 2008–2010 seems to be favorable for innovations (51.7%), on the other hand the period of 2010–2012 seems to be less favorable, as the share of innovative enterprises is 43.9% from the whole number of economically active enterprises. In the period of 2004–2008, technical innovations dominated (35.6%) over nontechnical innovations (31.6%). According to statistical survey in 2010–2012, the biggest number of innovative enterprises appears in information and communication technologies (64.8%), while technical innovations were introduced mostly (57%), and were followed by nontechnical innovations (45.7%). The second most innovative branch is finance and insurance (55.9%) followed by manufacturing (48.3%) with predominance of technical innovations over nontechnical ones. The last place belongs to mining and quarrying branch (23.2%) and enterprises in transportation and storage (10.8%). In all branches with the exception of wholesale, technical innovations predominated over nontechnical. Measurement of innovations at enterprise level belongs to managers’ and owners’ competencies. They use their own innovation techniques. Managers use hard metrics which are available without any additional costs and are transferrable to financial expressions, or soft metrics which are used for evaluation of the rate of meeting internal targets in the area. One-third of all companies appeared at the list of top-ranked companies Fortune 1000 uses innovation metrics published by Innovation Point, see Table 2.\n\nInnovation metrics Annual R&D budget as a percentage of annual sales Number of patents filed in the past year Total R&D headcount or budget as a percentage of sales Number of active projects Number of ideas submitted by employees Percentage of sales from products introduced in the past X year(s)\n\n3.2. Innovation measurement at the state level in the Czech Republic\n\nIn order to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy with sustainable growth, the European Union established European Innovation Scoreboard. The first scoreboard was proposed of 17 countries increased to about 30 and the number of indicators increased to 29. Scoreboard is divided into three parts: enablers, firm activities, and outputs. Enablers are the main drivers of innovations such as new doctorate graduates, finance support, or venture capital. Firm activities contain firm investments, collaborating enterprises, or intellectual assets. Outputs include innovators such as SMEs with product and process innovations or with marketing or organizational innovations and economic effects such as license and patent revenues from abroad (Gupta and Trusko, 2014).\n\nThis scoreboard was later renamed innovation union scorecard that helps to provide benchmarking among 27 member states in the sphere of innovation implementation. The aim of the benchmarking based on innovation union scorecard is to strengthen research and innovation. The structure of the scorecard has three blocks, eight dimensions, and 25 indicators, see Table 3.\n\nBlocksDimensionsIndicatorsEnablersHuman resourcesNew doctorate graduates\n\nPopulation aged 30#0x2013;34 when tertiary education\n\nYouth with at least upper secondary educationOpen, excellent, attractive research systemsInternational scientific co-publications\n\ntop 10% most cited scientific co-publications\n\nNon-EU doctorate studentsFinance and supportR&D expenditures in the public sector\n\nVenture capitalFirm activitiesFirm investmentsR&D expenditures in the business sector\n\nNon-R&D innovation expenditureLinkages and entrepreneurshipSMEs innovating in-house\n\nInnovating SMEs collaborating with others\n\nPublic-private co-publicationsIntellectual assetsPCT patent applications\n\nPCT patent applications in societal challenges\n\nCommunity trademarks\n\nCommunity designsOutputsInnovatorsSMEs with product and process innovations\n\nSMEs with marketing or organizational innovations\n\nHigh-growth innovative firmsEconomic effectsEmployment in knowledge-intensive activities\n\nMedium and high-tech product exports\n\nKnowledge-intensive services exports\n\nSales and new-to-market and new-to-firm innovations\n\nLicense and patent revenues from abroad\n\nAccording to average innovation performance, the member states are grouped into four performance groups: innovation leaders, innovation followers, moderate innovators, and modest innovators. To be an innovation leader, the member state has to demonstrate a balanced innovation system.\n\nIn comparative assessment of the research and innovation performance of the EU member states was found following findings: Sweden has confirmed its innovation leadership. It is followed by Denmark, Finland, and Germany as European innovation leaders. Compared to 2014, innovation performance has increased in 15 EU countries, while it declined in 13 others. Latest results showed that (Innovation Union Scoreboard, 2015):\n\nSweden, Denmark, Finland, and Germany are “innovation leaders” with innovation performance well above that of the EU average;\n\nAustria, Belgium, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Slovenia, and the United Kingdom are “innovation followers” with innovation performance above or close to that of the EU average;\n\nThe performance of Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, and Spain is below that of the EU average. These countries are “moderate innovators”;\n\nBulgaria, Latvia, and Romania are “modest innovators” with innovation performance well below that of the EU average (Innovation Union Scoreboard, 2015).\n\nSweden’s innovation system is once more in the first position in the EU with the overall ranking remaining relatively stable. The performance group memberships have remained relatively stable compared to the previous IUS edition, with Cyprus and Estonia being the only countries that changed group membership, in their case changing from the innovation followers to the moderate innovators. Within the moderate innovators, Estonia is the top performer followed by the Czech Republic that has overtaken Italy and Cyprus. The most innovative countries have balanced innovation systems with strengths in all dimensions, but some other countries reach top scores in individual dimensions. Sweden, Ireland, Finland, and the United Kingdom score the best in human resources; the Netherlands, Sweden, and Denmark reach top positions in open, excellent, and attractive research systems; Estonia, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden perform best in finance and support; Germany, Sweden, Estonia, and Finland are the best performers in firm investments; Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Denmark are top performers in linkages and entrepreneurship; Sweden, Denmark, Finland, and Germany reach the top positions in intellectual assets; Ireland, Luxembourg, and Germany are the best performers in the innovators dimension; and Ireland, Denmark, and Luxembourg reach the highest results in economic effects. Over a longer time period of 8 years, the EU has been improving its innovation performance, with Latvia, Bulgaria, and Malta being the innovation growth leaders but innovation growth differences exist also within the groups and the innovation gap between the member states closes slowly. However, compared to the last year, innovation has not been improving. A direct comparison with the results of last year’s edition is not possible as there have been some changes in the measurement framework, but a comparison with innovation performance as it would have been last year using the same measurement framework shows that innovation performance has declined for 13 member states, in particular for Romania, Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, and Spain. For the EU at large innovation performance has not changed and for 15 member states it has improved, most notably for Malta, Latvia, and Bulgaria (Innovation Union Scoreboard, 2015).\n\nAt a wider European level, Switzerland confirms its top position outperforming all EU member state. Taking into account European countries outside the EU, also this year Switzerland confirms its position as the overall innovation leader by continuously outperforming all EU member states and by being the best performer in as many as six indicators. Internationally, South Korea and the US defend their positions as the top global innovators.\n\n4.1. China’s national innovation system\n\nMeasurement innovation in China has been more focused on assessing intellectual capital in terms of patents, literature citations, and growth in research and development in terms of addition of R&D functions in corporations, R&D expenditures, and R&D personnel as a percentage of total employment (Gupta and Trusko, 2014). Literature citations are based on published total and joined Chinese science and technology papers. The measures are shown in Table 5.\n\nBlocksDimensionsIndicatorsTotal and joined Chinese science and technology papersUniversitiesTotal university papers\n\nUniversity papers as % total\n\nJoint papers with universities (%)\n\nJoint papers with R&D institutes (%)\n\nJoint papers with firms (%)R&D institutesTotal R&D institute papers\n\nR&D institute papers as % total\n\nJoint papers with universities (%)\n\nJoint papers with R&D institutes (%)\n\nJoint papers with firms (%)FirmsTotal firm papers\n\nFirm papers as % total\n\nJoint papers with universities (%)\n\nJoint papers with R&D institutes (%)\n\nJoint papers with firms (%)Technology-based spin-offs from universities and research institutesUniversitiesNumber\n\nProfit (RMB)Research institutesNumber\n\nProfit (RMB)Patenting activity by organization type and patent typeInvention patentsR&D (% total)\n\nUniversities (% total)\n\nFirms (% total)Utility patentsR&D (% total)\n\nUniversities (% total)\n\nFirms (% total)Design patentsR&D (% total)\n\nUniversities (% total)\n\nFirms (% total)Sources of R&D fundingGovernmentShare of total (%)\n\nIncrease (%)\n\nAmount (RMB billion)EnterprisesShare of total (%)\n\nIncrease (%)\n\nAmount (RMB billion)BanksShare of total (%)\n\nIncrease (%)\n\nAmount (RMB billion)OtherShare of total (%)\n\nIncrease (%)\n\nAmount (RMB billion)Total and joint patenting activityUniversitiesTotal university patents\n\nUniversity patents as % total\n\nJoint patents with universities (%)\n\nJoint patents with R&D institutes (%)\n\nJoint patents with firms (%)R&D institutesTotal R&D institute patents\n\nR&D institute patents as % total\n\nJoint patents with universities (%)\n\nJoint patents with R&D institutes (%)\n\nJoint patents with firms (%)FirmsTotal firm patents\n\nFirm patents as % total\n\nJoint patents with universities (%)\n\nJoint patents with R&D institutes (%)\n\nJoint patents with firms (%)Share of national R&D expenditure by sectorResearch institutesShare (%)UniversitiesShare (%)EnterprisesShare (%)Regional variation in innovation inputs and outputsEastern RegionInvention patents (number and % China)\n\nRegional GDP (RMB billions and % China)\n\nRRD&E Personnel (thousands and % China)\n\nR&D expenditure (RMB millions and % China)ZhejiangInvention patents (number and % China)\n\nRegional GDP (RMB billions and % China)\n\nRRD&E Personnel (thousands and % China)\n\nR&D expenditure (RMB millions and % China)Central regionInvention patents (number and % China)\n\nRegional GDP (RMB billions and % China)\n\nRRD&E Personnel (thousands and % China)\n\nR&D expenditure (RMB millions and % China)Western regionInvention patents (number and % China)\n\nRegional GDP (RMB billions and % China)\n\nRRD&E personnel (thousands and % China)\n\nR&D expenditure (RMB millions and % China)\n\nChinese system of innovation measurement at the state level points out that the most important institutions in the area of innovation are universities, firms, and research institutes. Significant attention is paid to design, utility, and invention patents. Sources of research and development funding are divided into three main groups: enterprises, banks, and others. Funding of innovation activities is also monitored in connection with sectors or branches as source acceptors. Total and joined Chinese science and technology papers are also evaluated.\n\nFrom historical point of view although the Chinese government has made dramatic progress toward a more effective and efficient national innovation system compared to its performance under central planning, a number of important issues remain such as an inadequate legal environment that cannot yet provide a reliable environment for inter-organizational relationships that are crucial in the innovation process. This issue is the biggest and growing discrepancy among regions in terms of innovative activity, which the Chinese government has recognized but has been largely ineffective in addressing (Liu and White, 2001).\n\nBeijing has a strong science base, including the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), and top universities; these are national R&D centers with global connections. Shanghai has a large-scale, R&D-intensive industry base. Guangdong province has a foreign (manufacturing) firm-based innovation system and accounts for more than half of China's PCT patent applications (almost two-thirds in ICT). In contrast, China's western regions lack the absorptive capacity needed to capture knowledge flows from coastal areas and abroad. Collaboration, as shown in patent data, is weak across regions."
