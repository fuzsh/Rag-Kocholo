        "text": "In Loving Memory of XCO Group Founder Dear Valued Clients, It is with a heavy heart and deep sadness that we share the devastating news of the passing of our beloved founder, Hugo Maree, who tragically passed away in a plane accident yesterday. His departure leaves a void that can never be filled, and our thoughts are with his family, friends and all who knew him. Hugo was not just the founder of XCO Group; he was the heart and soul of our organisation. His visionary leadership, unwavering commitment and passion for excellence were the driving forces behind the success and growth of our company for the past 36 years. As we navigate through this difficult time, we want to express how greatly Hugo will be missed by all who had the privilege of working with him. He was not only a leader but also a husband, father, brother, business partner, colleague, confidant, mentor and much more to those fortunate enough to know him. The incredible success and reputation of XCO Group today are a testament to Hugo's dedication and leadership. He built not only a company but a family, and his impact on our corporate culture will be felt for years to come. While we mourn the loss of a visionary leader, we want to assure you that XCO Group is in good hands. We are committed to maintaining the same level of excellence, innovation, and service that Hugo instilled in our company. We understand the importance of the relationships we have built with each of you, and we want to express our gratitude for your continued trust and partnership. As we move forward, we will honour Hugo's memory by continuing to deliver the high standards he set for XCO Group. In this challenging time, we appreciate your understanding and support. If you have any concerns or questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to us. We are here for you, just as Hugo would have wanted. Thank you for being a valued part of the XCO Group family."
