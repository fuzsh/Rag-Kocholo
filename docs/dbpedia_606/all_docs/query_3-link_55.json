It was founded in 1849 for technical, agricultural and commercial specialisations. The languages of instruction were Czech and German. However, in consequence of political and national disputes, Czech gradually ceased to be used as a language of instruction until in 1899 the Czech Technical High School was established in Brno. After World War I and the founding of Czechoslovakia this school merged with the German Technical School (originally bilingual) to form the High Technical School in Brno (later bearing the name of Dr. Edvard Beneš, the second President of Czechoslovakia). In the period between World War I and World War II the school was among the best technical high schools in Europe. During World War II the school was, as all other Czech high schools were, closed and the premises were used by German military institutions, and most equipment was destroyed. Immediately after the end of World War II the activities of the school were resumed. In 1951 at the beginning of Cold War, the Technical High School was closed and some departments were incorporated in the newly established Military Academy. Tuition for civilians continued at the former Faculty of Civil Engineering only. Electrotechnical disciplines were first taught at the university in Since the Faculty of Power Engineering was founded in 1959, and subsequently transformed into Electrotechnical Faculty, more than 26,000 students have graduated from the faculty. In 1993 the structure of the faculty was changed. It received a new name Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (FEECS) and was the third largest amongthe then existing seven faculties of Brno University of Technology after, at the beginning of 2000, the Faculty of Technology and the Faculty of Management joined to establish Tomáš Baťa University in Zlín. A number of historical decisions were taken in 2001 in connection with the founding of a new faculty in Faculty of Information Technology (FIT) and transformation of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (FEECS) into the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communication (FEEC). A significant milestone in the faculty history was the year 2013 when construction of new faculty premises was completed. After more than fifty years of its existence, the whole faculty, all departments and workplaces, moved to one locationin the BUT campus Pod Palackého vrchem. The Faculty in 2016 The Rector was Professor Petr Štěpánek and his Vice-Rector for Creative Activities was Professor Lubomír Grmela from the Department of Physics, Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Communciation. The Dean of FEEC in 2016 was Professor Jarmila Dědková, and the four vice-deans were Professor Vladimír Aubrecht (research and doctoral study programme, acting dean), Associate Professor Jiří Háze (external relations and international affairs), Associate Professor Petr Fiedler (Bachelor study programme), Professor Stanislav Hanus (Master study programme), and Miloslav Morda was faculty bursar. At the end of 2016 there were academic loads at the faculty (professors, associate professors, senior lecturers, lecturers and other pedagogical and research staff) and 3,678 students in all forms of government supported programmes. Moreover, inter-faculty instruction was provided to 230 students of the Faculty of Information Technology, 33 students of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, 78 students of the Faculty of Management and 4 students from Institute of Forensic Engineering. On the other hand, the faculty purchased instruction for 8 students from the Faculty of Management and for 4 students fromthe Faculty of Information Technology. Then the number of students educated at the faculty totalled 3, 770. In 2016 education was provided in study programmes Electrical Engineering, Electronics, Communication and Control Technology (EECR, accredited in 2001) and Biomedical Technology and Bioinformatics (BTBIO-A, reaccredited in 2013), Biomedical Engineering and Bioinformatics (BTBIO-F, accredited in 2010), English in Electrical Engineering and Information Technology (AJEI-H, accredited in 2012) and Audio Engineering (AUDIO, accredited in 2012) in the Bologna system.the study programmes at FEEC are now fully compatible with the European education system, and student mobility has been facilitated. Among the FEEC graduates in 2016 there were 415 students who completed the Bachelor degree programme, 403 follow-up Master programme graduates and 29 doctoral students completed the Ph.D. programme. There were 1,238 admissions to Bachelor programmes, 596 admissions to follow-up Master programmes, and 83 students started their Ph.D. studies. Instruction in English was provided to 2 international students paying their fees. One academic received the title of professor and eight academics were appointed associate professors. 3\n\n4 Events and Activities operationof the interactive playroom Elektrikárium awarding of the QMS (ISO 9001) certificate Open Days (January, November, December 2016), visits by students to secondary schools, secondary school advisors visiting FEEC, Night of Scientists faculty presentation at European trade fair of higher and lifelong education GAUDEAMUS 2016, 1-4 November 2016, trade fairs in Bratislava, Nitra and Prague development of programmes leading to habilitation and appointment of professors meeting of the leaderships of Czech and Slovak faculties of electrical engineering and associated facultiesin Nové Město na Moravě, May STUDENT EEICT Conference and Competition 2016 with 35 Bachelor, 52 Master, 102 Ph.D. and 5 papers by secondary school students, sponsored by Honeywell, ABB, ON Semiconductor etc. creative competition for secondary school students Merkur perfekt Challenge with more than 200 participants from all parts of the Czech Republic Programme Erasmus+ and other European programmes continuation of the project Energy in Conditions of Sustainable Development (EN-PUR) of the regional centre CVVOZE (Centre for Renewable Electric Energy Sources) funded from NPU I, investigator Vladimír Aubrecht continuation of the project Interdisciplinary Research of Wireless Technologies (INWITE) of the regional centre SIX (Centre for Sensor, Information and Communication Systems) funded from NPU I, investigator Martin Slanina operation of the mini nursery Edisonka supported by BUT faculties activities of Academic Senate member Ivana Jakubová in her capacity as a member of the Higher Education Council activities of Academic Senate, namely Chairman Miloslav Steinbauer, focused on organisationalissues and economic interests of FEEC courses for secondary school students interested in study at FEEC organised by Department of Mathematics to help them prepare for entrance examination and Summer School of Electrical Engineering organised by Department of Theoretical and Experimental Electrical Engineering activities of Advisor for Equal Opportunities Vlasta Sedláková focused on consultancy for female students and study opportunities for handicapped students faculty ball at the Voroněž hotel Achievements Economic situation of the faculty in 2016 was satisfactory.it can be said that income for education slightly increased, however, higher write-offshad to be covered from allocated funds. Research and development institutional support substantially increased. The trend in salaries and material supply was favourable due to outstanding pedagogical and research achievements of academic staff and minimisation of faculty expenditure. The funds received for project solutionhave slightly decreased. The balance for 2016 that can be used to finance faculty activities only to a limited extent was transferred to wages and salaries to be paid as an extra pay at the end of theyear. Faculty funds are generated and used to support faculty development and provide funding for research projectswhen necessary. Economic stability of departments was mainly due to involvement in research projects of the Czech Science Foundation, Czech Technology Agency, Ministry of Trade and Industry, European Commission (FP7), and efforts of those who under the leadership of chief investigators participated in OP VK, EN-PUR, INWITE and NPU projects. For three subsequent years income from economic activity has been rising, owing to the results of the centre CVVOZE.Also in 2016 the faculty achieved positive economic result that will be used tofinance faculty activites in the following period. All staff members and Ph.D. students deserve high appreciation and my gratitude.

All CVVOZE laboratories form a unique infrastructure that will undoubtedly attract important industrial partners whose areas of interest are closely connected with research carried out in the centre. 19\n\n20 The leading workplaces are Laboratory of Switching Devices and Ultra High Voltage Laboratory located in Professor List Technology Park. These strategic laboratories are used for research and development of various power and high voltage electrical devices and systems. Equipment can be used to simulate extreme short-circuit grid conditions, lightning strike on lines etc. The unique laboratory equipment draws attention of many industrial companies. We have been offered contracts from SIEMENS, ABB, EATON, and from smaller Czech firms (DRI- BO) and foreign companies (SEZ Krompachy - Slovakia, Techna Ltd. Great Britain, Schaltbau - Austria). Research contracts for these laboratories in 2016 amounted to more than 9 mil. CZK. For more information on CVVOZE visit Centre of Sensor, Information and Communication Systems (SIX) doc. Ing. Martin Slanina, Ph.D. Director Research centre SIX was established in 2010 as a joint initiative of FEEC departments involved in research and development of sensor systems, information and communication technologies. The aim was to interconnect research interests and utilise achieved synergy in work on extensive and complex research projects. The centre s own LTE network infrastructure The involved departments offered their laboratories that were upgraded and extended in the period owing to support from the operational programme Research and Development for Innovations. In 2014 the centre started full operation without direct financial support from public sources. The centre grew, not only in terms of numbers of involved researchers and their loads, but also results, grants and commercial contracts. And the growth continued in 2015 and\n\n21 Centre SIX is supported by the National Sustainability Programme Interdisciplinary Research of Wireless Technologies (INWITE), designed to increase the volume and quality of basic research and thus increase the centre s chances to make a good use of acquired knowledge in projects of applied and commercial research. The project is conducted by a team of five groups jointly led by professors from Vienna Technical University and Centre SIX. The groups involved in project INWITE focus on six specialisations (sensors, signals, radio frequency systems, mobile communication systems, antennas and high frequency circuits, advanced cyber security). Owing to close cooperation in international teams the centre succeeded in 2016 with several project proposals in the competition of the Czech Science Foundation. On international level, the centre became partner in two European projects.

Among our priorities is student and teacher mobility involving universities cooperating within the framework of European Commission programmes. FEEC is one of the most active faculties at Brno University of Technology. We have had good cooperation with the BUT Department of International Relations responsible for organisational and economic support of programme Erasmus. As a result there were 81 placements of students of 324 months last year, 15 lecture stays of 15 weeks and two two-week trainings of academic staff (see Table 6). There were 99 students coming for placements of 380 months. Mobility figures for incoming and outgoing students in individual programmes in 2016 are in Table 8. The list of partners cooperating with FEEC within the programme Erasmus+ is in Table 9. In 2016 funding was received for long-term international placements of students of all study programmes from the mobility development programme of Ministry of Education International Mobility Support for of BUT Students in the amount of 375 thous. CZK. Owing to this support 7 students could go for placements of 17 months. Mobility figures for outgoing and incoming students in all programmes are in Table 8. It is apparent that the number of placements in 2016 was substantially lower as compared with the previous year, only 236 months. The number of incoming students was nearly the same. The faculty supports cooperation of academics and departments with international institutions based on interfaculty and Erasmus+ agreements, as well as seeking new contacts. Last year 37 thous. CZK was provided in support of such activities. Targeted international relations were financed by departments through operational programmes. The funds were used to cover travel expenses of internationally recognised academics coming to short lecture stays at FEEC.

The newly structured websites, presentations and videopresentations as well as faculty profile on the social network Facebook are targeted at our future students, secondary school and technical secondary school students. In this respect, an important role was played by the so called Roadshow FEEC students popularising technical science at secondary schools. Very popular is the recently launched competition of four-person secondary-school teams Merkur perfekt Challenge. The competition offered 9 topics, selected by the teams at registration. For capacity reasons only the first 54 applications could be accepted. This number was reached only one month after the call. Secondary schools from all over Moravia and part of Bohemia registered 200 students, including several girls. The competition was conducted in an atmosphere of fair-play, and generally the performance and knowledge of students in areas such as electrical engineering, robotics, programming, etc. must be appreciated. In February 2016 the winners of individual areas competed in the superfinals, where the winner was the team MMPD crew representing the Technical Secondary School from Zlín. This year they are owners of the challenge cup for the overall winner. Increased attention was paid to the media, presentation of FEEC achievements in basic and applied research, development and cooperation with the industrial sector. On FEEC websites, BUT portals and other subjects, information is given on research and education at FEEC departments and workplaces, habilitations and appointments to professorship, research and development projects of the Czech Science Foundation, Ministry of Trade and Industry, Ministry of Education and other projects including EU framework programmes. The websites are available in Czech and English. The faculty organised the annual meeting of the Czech and Slovak faculties of electrical engineering and associated faculties in Nové Město na Moravě, May Exchange of experience and discussions on the current situation in education and research, solution of research projects, participation in European programmes and coordination of activities, research plans and centres and cooperation withforeign universities were on the agenda. The Faculty commemorated the tragic event on Kubínská Hola in 1968 when an avalanche killed 6 students of the then Electrotechnical Faculty. Contacts have been maintained with industrial companies in the Brno region and other parts of the Czech Republic. These contacts are mainly based on cooperation with FEEC departments in specific research, expert s reports and consultancy. The major cooperating companies are ABB s.r.o., Siemens A. G., Honeywell s.r.o., T-Mobile Czech Republic, a.s., ON Semiconductor Czech Republic, AT&T Czech, EATON Czech Republic, Rockwell/Allen Bradley, Škoda Volkswagen Mladá Boleslav, Motorola Solutions, National Semiconductor, ČEZ, a.s., Linet, s.r.o., BD Sensors, s.r.o., Buchlovice etc. Cooperation continued within the two regional centres CVVOZE and SIX, and was intensified during the preparation and launching of the project of research centre of excellence CEITEC - Central European Institute of Technology, a joint project of six partners four universities and two research institutes. Another recent and significant contribution to cooperation with industrial partners is the Partner Programme constituting a platform for presentation of industrial companies, increased cooperation with research teams and theses projects. Close cooperation of many years has been maintained with the Institute of Instrument Technology of Czech Academy of Sciences in Brno in research projects of joint interest. Members of the Institute's staff are part-time teachers at FEEC, in Master and Ph.D. programmes. Academy of Sciences can offer Ph.D. study based on a contract with the faculty. Academic staff, mainly departments of mathematics and physics, have cultivated long-term cooperation with secondary schools in the Brno region in preparing their students for studies at FEEC. 27\n\n28 Popularisation of science and technology - Night of Scientists Research achievements are regularly presented at the trade fair Ampér 28\n\n29 Academic Senate In 2016 the members of Academic Senate were (LK legislative committee, PK pedagogical committee, EK economic committee, KK - quality and represented department): Chair doc.

We are pleased that it arose interest of elementary and secondary schools as well the public. Elektrikárium or PerFEKT electro games is open to visitors from 5 years on and is free of charge. It is open to the public Tuesday to Thursday afternoon and the whole of Saturday. For more information go to Popularisation of technical sciences interactive playroom Elektrikárium Student Activities Active at FEEC are two student organisations the voluntary club Students for Students (SPS) and the Student Chamber of Academic Senate FEEC (SK AS FEKT), the student part of officially elected faculty body. Both organisations closely cooperate. The Student Chamber acts as an intermediary between faculty leadership and students, organises instruction quality assessmentto increase the quality of instruction and helps to tackle students problems. Activities of the club Students for Students are focused on leisure time. Its role is to enrich student life. The membership is voluntary, all those interested in student activities at FEEC and BUT can apply. Magazine e-fekt The student magazine is issued every second month. It offers information on current events at FEEC. Moreover, technical, entertaining and many other articles can be found there. Assistance The club helps first-year students to adapt to life in an unfamiliar environment of the faculty, halls of residence and the town of Brno. It offers information and help with getting to know people before the start of the winter semester in the so called Zaškolovák. To be able to find their way in the labyrinth of school corridors and get around the town, students are invited to the event PerFEKT start organised at a weekend before the start of the semester to meet each other, explore the premises and get some tips for places to go to in their free time. For students who wish to meet during the winter semester, there are sports, cultural and entertainment events every week within the programme PerFEKT assistance. Cultural events Social, cultural and education events are organised for students. The biggest event last year was the 9th open-air festival - Music from FEEC (Hudba z FEKTu) staged at the faculty car park on 21 September The festival 32\n\n33 offered a rich programme, student amateur groups performed and competed, over 5,500 spectators came to see Fast Food Orchestra and Pipes and Pints. Sport-loving students were invited to take part in the fun race Run to 53. The task was to run the distance from school to the 53 bus stop in the shortest possible time. There were several student categories and, as every year, VIP management relays. During the year several board games days were organised for students to spend free time and compete in tournaments.

Instruction and research are conducted by five specialised groups. The main interest of the group involved in automatic control was robust and predictive electrical drives control. Research of nonlinear estimators for sensor-free drives control continued. Research outcomes have been applied within the competence centre projects, namely TA ČR CAK3 Centre of Applied Cybernetics and CIDAM Centre of Intelligent Drives and Advanced Machine Control. In cooperation with the Centre of Excellence CEI- TEC, the group was involved in international projects H2020 3Ccar Integrated Components for Complexity Control in Affordable Electrified Cars and OSEM-EV Optimised and Systematic Energy Management in Electric Vehicles. Intensive research was carried out in the field of theoretical probability filtration of dynamical systems, automatic setting algorithms of filter parameters with possible suppression of system model vagueness. The group continued its cooperation with Freescale Semiconductor (now NXP) and Infineon Technologies) in the development of robust and predictive algortihms for alternating electrical drives. The group of measurement technology focuses on electrical and electronic measurements, virtual instruments in the LabView environment, sensors of non-electrical characteristics, measurements and evaluation of nonelectrical characteristics with focus on vibrodiagnostics, thermodiagnostics, acoustic emission, flux and noise measurement. The group involved in industrial automation deals with real-time embedded systems, wireless communication systems and industrial Ethernet with focus on operational safety and protection against external and internal errors, faults and attacks. Furthermore, the group is involved in research of decentralised and distributed control and communication systems. Research is also centred on control systems for buildings and complexunits. Instruction is focused on subjects dealing with control and automation industrial technology (embedded systems, programmable automatics, SCADA systems, Průmysl 4.0 technology, functionalsafety). The group closely cooperates with BD Sensors, Beta Control, ModemTec, Siemens, Rockwell Automation, Škoda Auto etc. The group of artificial intelligence and robotics is involved in research of service mobile robotics. Research is mainly concerned with telepresence control of mobile robots in difficult terrain, self-localisation in outer environment, in urban areas and interiors of buildings, design of highly reliable robotic systems for work under extreme conditions, and automatic map-making. Now we entered the third year of research on employment of elements of advanced optical scanning and virtual/extended reality in biomedical engineering, especially for cardio- and neuro-rehabilitation. Instruction encompasses introduction into stationary and mobile robotics and sections dealing with above mentioned research issues. A new subject Practical Robotics and Computer Vision has been introduced where the students can assemble their own robot and can earn credits for racing. The long-term prime interest in computer vision is applied research and development of industrial and transport visual systems. The group cooperates with a number of commercial companies and university departments. Academics are involved in research project solution and research contracts, and provide instruction in signal and image processing and analysis, localisation, recognition and reconstruction of 3D bodies. Part of the group deals with specialised hardware design on the basis of FPGA/DSP platforms for processing of extensive data files in real time. The staff is involved in more than ten subjects in Bachelor and Master programmes, and TAČR, MPO, MŠMT, UAMT and CEITEC research projects. One of the robots constituting the system ATEROS Research teams are engaged in the project of European Centre of Excellence OP VaVpI CEITEC Central European Technology Institute, group Cybernetics for Materials Science involved in cutting-edge research oncontrol, sensors, robotics and embedded systems. 35\n\n36 The department s two laboratories are part of the Centre for Research and Utilisation of Renewable Energy (CVVOZE). They focus on developing a smart grid model with different renewable sources to test grid stabilisation algorithms, operation of certified rooms for vibration and climate testing, and training and testing laboratories for safety control systems. Major Achievements The group focused on automatic control joined international projects H2020 3Ccar and OSEM-EV and cooperates with the Centre of Excellence CEITEC and major international partners. The group publishes in leading journals (e.g. IEEE Transaction on Industrial Electronics) and attends conferences on theory(e.g. IEEE Conference on Decision and Control) and applications(e.g. IECON Annual Conference of IEEE Industrial Electronics Society). The group of measurement technology involved in projects VaVPI invested in upgrading of the laboratories for measurement of noise, vibrations and temperature. The Climate and Vibration Test Laboratory was re-accredited, and a new Calibration Laboratory has been prepared for accreditation. The structure of instruction was completely re-organised, with introduction of new compulsory subjects. The group of industrial automation dealt with several significant projects, mainly Research and Development of a Filter Ventillation Unit for Protection from Chemical Substance, Dust and Biological Infection in Personal Protection Means and REVYT. The group of artificial intelligence and robotics focused on the system for visual telepresence with high resolution and option to combine data from TOF proximity scanners, CCD sensors and thermovision cameras. The reconnaissance robotic system Morpheus with a unique system of drives inside wheel discs was presented. And a system for precise self-localisation and navigation in outer environment was designed. The group of computer vision continued research in TAČR CK TE project Centre of Applied Cybernetics, as investigator of the package Camera systems and methods of image analysis for monitoring in transportation and industry. Research activities of CAK are centred on sophisticated computer vision problems in traffic applications, driving assistance systems and industrial camera inspection systems. Another important research objective is the development of our own systems for processing large volumes of data on the basis of FPGA/DSP platforms e.g. the high rate 4K camera with 10G Ethernet optical interface. The group is involved in several research and development projects, worked on transformation of a number of courses related to computer vision and launched the course Recognition and previously Computer Learning for the students to acquire complex and at the same time detailed knowledge.

The department is involved in basic and applied research on engineering principles in neuroscience, cardiology, physiology, electrochemistry, botany, genetics and molecular biology. The main areas of interest are digital processing and analysis of especially cardiological signals, including experimental cardiology in cooperation with Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University.Other research interests are analyses of polysomnographic data, EEG signals as related to temporal studies or fmri acquisition, digital processing and analysis of medical images for different imaging modalities, mainly ultrasonography, MRI, CT, microscopy and computer vision. The latest methods of processing large data volumes are applied including methods of deep learning or parallelisation of complex calculations on GPU. Research is also focused on cell biology. It is mainly utilisation of confocal microscopy or fast fluorescence microscopy for study of viability and proliferation of cells, impact of nanoparticles on cellular behaviour, measurement of intracellular calcium of cardiomyocites or using optical methods to study mechanical properties of cells. There has been rapid development in research on bioinformatics, proteomics, genomics, and lately metagenomics. Projects are centred on methods of evolutionaary and similarity analysis of genomic and proteomic data, methods for construction of bacterial genomes from de novo sequence data, search for genes in all genome data and analysis of pharmacofore of natural molecules of potentially healing substances. Research issues relate to education. The department supportsawider education of students. In 2016 they attended the largest world fair trade of biomedical technology Medica in Düsseldorf and visited a number of top institutions in the field (National Tissue Centre), Masaryk Oncological Institute, etc.). In research and instruction the department closely cooperateswithophtalmological Clinic of Friedrich-Alexander- University Erlangen (Germany), University of Bergen (Norway), the companies Philips Czech Republic, Philips Nederlands, MIKRO s.r.o., VUP Medical, a.s., MDT-Medical Data Transfer, s.r.o., Touchless Biometric Systems s.r.o., Smart Brain Sale, s.r.o., Institute of Instrument Technologyof Academy of Sciences, Faculty of Medicineof Masaryk University in Brno, Mendel University, Research Institute of Veterinary Medicine, University of Chemistry and Technology in Prague, Faculty Hospital Bohunice and Faculty Hospital u sv. Anny in Brno. One of the department s laboratories Major Achievements In 2016 members of the department published more than 20 papers, most of them in non-zero impact factor journals. Among the most notable achievements are papers in Current Opinion in Neurology, Biotechnology for Biofuels and IEEE Transactions on Terahertz Science and Technology. Scientific outcomes were presented at conferences such as Computing in Cardiology or International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging. Members of the department co-organise the World Congress on Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering, the major world conference on research in biomedical engineering. They also cooperate in preparation of the specialised section of the international conference on medical imaging and processing Computational Vision and Medical Image Processing. 41\n\n42 In December 2016 the department organised, in cooperation with Association of Medical Equipment Suppliers representing major industrial partners in the field of biomedical engineering, an educational event Window into the World of Production and Sales of Medical Equipment where a number of Czech companies were presented. The event was attended by our students and many secondary school students for whom we prepared a tour of our laboratories. In 2016 two grant projects were completed (GAČR and MŠMT COST CZ) as well as a standard project and two student projects of Internal Grant Agency of VUT.
