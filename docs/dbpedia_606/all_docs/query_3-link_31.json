All food-processing operations have common fundamental spheres of problems - wastewater polluted by organic substances, solid waste of biological origin and losses during source material processing. Beer production process is a representative of food-processing sphere. The brewing industry has an ancient tradition and is still a dynamic sector open to new developments in technology and scientific progress. A case study of beer production in Czech Republic has been performed. During the work on the project, there were utilized methodical procedures of Cleaner Production, best available technologies (BAT) utilization and hazard analysis critical control points (HACCP), optimization of final technology operation.\n\nKeywords: breweries, Cleaner Production, best available technology, critical points\n\nGrants and funding:\n\nThis study was supported by the Research plan No. MSM6215648905 \"Biological and technological aspects of sustainability of controlled ecosystems and their adaptability to climate change\", which is financed by the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Czech Republic."
