        "text": "This book examines the new anti-establishment parties electorally succeeding at the expense of their established counterparts and argues that party organization matters for their electoral success. It explores a relationship between these parties’ electoral success and their party organization. Using a framework to explain the role of organizational features such as local party branches, party membership, and party elites in this process, it reveals how they help parties to be more stable, cohesive, and legitimate; a state that facilitates better conditions for electoral success. It also shows that control over party organization is achieved partially by the existence of a corporate network associated with party leaders’ businesses. This book will be of key interest to scholars and students of party politics and political parties, anti-establishment politics, and Eastern European politics.\n\nThis exploratory paper analyzes the evolution of party organizations in 9 European democracies, in the past 40 years, by combining a new-institutional approach to organizational change with the research method of the Political Party Database Project. To this end, as the PPDB collection of data and information is focused on the present, we extend its approach and methodology to the database provided by the Party Organizations Data Handbook (Katz, Mair 1992). The aim of the contribution is to verify empirically, through a diachronic analysis, Katz and Mair's assumption about the ascendancy of the party in public office at the expenses of the other two faces of political parties (the central office and the party on the ground), as a consequence of party penetration of the State.\n\nThis paper represents part of an ongoing attempt to understand the nature of party formation and change in electoral democracies. The original goal was to account for the weakness of East European parties and party systems. This remains an important topic because weak parties are thought to be indicative of weaknesses in the democratic regimes themselves. Finding the theories of area specialists lacking, the author turned to traditional theories of party formation and change, which were created to explain these phenomena in the western setting. These theories, combined with the contextual insights provided by area specialists, provide considerable leverage on the question of party formation and change in Eastern Europe. In this paper, the author attempts to develop and provide evidence in support of a theory of party formation based on political choice in which actors operate not in a vacuum, but in a context that both constrains and provides resources for agency.\n\nDuring the years 1991-1992, according to the authors Albanian political parties coexist modern concepts of party politics and organization with the concepts of local tradition imposed by mentality, inheritance and local circumstances. Throughout 1992- 1998 we have an increase in the number of political parties, of which two were major in 1990 in 1996, we have 65 political parties, of which 12 had representation in the parliament of the time. This increase in the number of parties by authors has come as a result of problems and internal conflicts in political parties, leading to factions and the creation of new parties in both sides of the policy. At the end of the first decade of transition, the political parties SP and PD as the two most influential parties in Albanian political life, after holding their National Assemblies, and other parties began to look to improve the public image by reforming statutes and programs leaving room for greater transparency and greater critical space..."
