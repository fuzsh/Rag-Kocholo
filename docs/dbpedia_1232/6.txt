Fujimorism (in Spanish: Fujimorismo) is an authoritarian, neoliberal, conservative and anti-communist right-wing, both culturally, socially and economically ideology originating in Peru, based on the thought of Alberto Fujimori, president of Peru from 1990 to 2000.

History

It arose in 1989 with the creation of the political party "Cambio 90", created by the Peruvian-Japanese politician Alberto Fujimori. At that time, Peru was suffering an era of serious terrorism by far-left groups, being the main Shining Path, a group which followed an ideology called "Gonzalo Thought", which was an extremely radical fusion of , and .

It is in this climate of terror that Fujimorism, of a and anti-communist nature, easily wins the 1990 general elections against his rival, the Mario Vargas Llosa, making Fujimori president of Peru.

During his rule, Fujimorism practically destroyed the terrorist groups using unconventional means (repression, assassinations, death squads), and to remain in power, he decided to carry out a self-coup in 1992, turning Peru into an autocracy.

Fujimori won the elections on 1995 and on 2000, but, in the same year, due to unpopularity, accusations of corruption, and his health problems, Fujimorism was forced to leave power.

After this, Fujimorism became a political opposition force, and despite the fact that in the early 2000s it was not doing very well in electoral results, over time it took more and more power, with the party Fuerza Popular (Popular Force) until it almost dominated half of the Peruvian congress, although since then its results have dropped a bit.

Currently its main party is Popular Force, led by Keiko Fujimori (daughter of Alberto Fujimori), and continues to be one of the most important ideologies in Peru.

Personality and Behaviour

Fujimorism is quite greedy, since he always wants to monopolize all the political power, and he is commonly involved in corruption scandals. Due to his Japanese ancestry, Fujimorism has slanted eyes, and can speak both Spanish and Japanese perfectly. He hates left-wing ideologies very much, as he regards all leftists as terrorists or retrograde. He is capable of breaking democracy to obtain his goals.
