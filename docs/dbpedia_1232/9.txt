Susana Higuchi

Susana Shizuko Higuchi Miyagawa is a Peruvian politician and engineer, better known as the former wife of ex-president of Peru Alberto Fujimori. A member of the Peruvian Congress during the 2001-2006 period, she was elected as a member of the Frente Independiente Moralizador (FIM), a political party allied with then president Alejandro Toledo.

Higuchi was born in Peru of Japanese descent. She was formerly married to Alberto Fujimori, who was president of Peru from 1990 until November 2000, when he resigned from office and fled to Japan as allegations of far-reaching corruption in his administration began to emerge. She married Fujimori in 1974 and divorced him in 1998. They have four children: Keiko Sofia, Hiro Alberto, Sachi Marcela and Kenji Gerardo.

As First Lady during her husband's presidency, Higuchi was one of the first people in Peru to allege criminal misdoings on the part of her husband. As early as 1992, she denounced several of her Fujimori in-laws for corruption in connection with the sale of used clothing donated by Japan. In 1994, she publicly condemned her husband as a tyrant and his government as corrupt. Fujimori reacted by formally stripping her of the title First Lady in August 1994, appointing their elder daughter First Lady in her place.
