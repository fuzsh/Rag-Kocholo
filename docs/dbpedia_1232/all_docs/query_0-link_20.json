        "text": "The Incan Empire is a nation located west of the Empire of Brazil, North of the Kingdom of Araucanía and Patagonia and South of the People's Republic of Gran-Colombia.\n\nHistory[]\n\nBefore the Empire[]\n\nPeruvian territory was home to several ancient cultures. Ranging from the Norte Chico civilization starting in 3500 BCE, the oldest civilization in the Americas and one of the five cradles of civilization, to the Inca Empire, the largest state in the pre-Columbian Americas, the territory now including Peru has one of the longest histories of civilization of any country, tracing its heritage back to the 10th millennium BCE.\n\nThe Spanish Empire conquered the region in the 16th century and established a viceroyalty that encompassed most of its South American territories, with its capital in Lima. Higher education started in the Americas with the official establishment of the National University of San Marcos in Lima in 1551. Peru formally proclaimed independence in 1821, and following the foreign military campaigns of José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar, and the decisive battle of Ayacucho, Peru completed its independence in 1824. In the ensuing years, the country enjoyed relative economic and political stability, though the nation faced a sovereignty crisis in 1836, with the formation of the Peruvian–Bolivian Confederation, and later the War of the Pacific (1879–1884) with Chile. Throughout the 20th century, Peru endured armed territorial disputes, coups, social unrest, and internal conflicts, as well as periods of stability and economic upswing.\n\nRise of the Empire[]\n\nThe Success of Brazil as a Monarchy influenced the President of Peru, Albert Fujimori who who is frequently described as a dictator was paranoid of loosing power in elections to declare himself Emperor. His party rigged the elections to prevent a popular opposition party in taking power, however after the rigging of the elections, Fujimori's rival in the party had won, which angered Fujimori who killed him and purged the whole entire party and executed all of his opponents. Fujimori had declared himself Albert I, Tiatoque of the newly restored Inca Empire which caused anarchy in Peru.\n\nTiatoque Albert I had declared war on Imperial Brazil to get the Acre (state). Peru invaded and conquered the Acre (state) and the Amazonas to gain access to their rubber trees and add tires to the list of stuff they manufacture and make Peru an economic powerhouse in South America. Sadly Peru was massacring and skinning Brazilian natives in the Amazonas alive to use their skin to make rubber tires as it also rapidly chopped down rubber trees. Brazil hearing of the news then repelled the Peruvians out of the Amazonas and Acre state and back into Peru proper. The Peruvians then invaded Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay in which they have successfully conquered them and added them to Fujimori's Empire.\n\nSadly for them, Brazil had conquered Paraguay from Inca which angrily provoked Peru, but Peru which was suffering economic and political instability was not able to continue a fight.\n\nAfter the War[]\n\nThe Incan Empire after the war had suffered due to many violent rebellions against the Fujimori Dynasty. Albert I sent in the Army and Police to handle the protesters and have them deposed of. Many Bolivian Rebels took up arms and decided to oust the Tiatoque and create a Republic run by all the Liberal Parties of Bolivia and Peru. Sadly their rebellion was a failure as the Incan Army put down that rebellion, but the bad news was that the rebellion got the attention of Gran-Colombia who waged war on Inca and Gran-Colombia will not stop the war until their proxies take charge and Inca becomes a Socialist Satellite of Cuba and Brazil's ally Araucanía and Patagonia who wants to help Brazil as an ally protect it's native peoples from Peruvian Aggression.\n\nGovernment[]\n\nThe Inca Empire is an Absolute Monarchy ruled by the Fujimori Dynasty as autocratic monarchs. The Tiatoque has the rights to make any laws he wants or even declare war without approval of the Imperial Congress. The Tiatoque can even dissolve the Imperial Congress if he feels like it or if they put in people who are not members of the ruling party. The National Socialist Party of Peru (formerly the Change 90 party) is the ruling party of the Incan Empire, the Party is ideologically a Political Party that advicates to have Catholicism and Inca Religion of Huaca as the only two religions of Peru and exterminate non Catholics or Huaca Practices and have them executed.\n\nOrder of Succession[]\n\nThe Order of Succession of Peru is Semi-Saliac.\n\nAlberto I (b. 1938), married 2 wives\n\n(1) Keiko Fujimori, Crown Princess of Inca (b. 1975), married Miguel Gómez, Crown Prince of Inca (b. 1974)\n\n(2) Prince Miguel Fujimori-Gómez (b. 1997), married Flavia Laos (b. 1997)\n\n(3) Prince Mario Miguel Fujimori-Gómez (b. 2021)\n\n(4) Princess Keiko Maya Fujimori-Gómez (b. 1999)\n\n(5) Prince Albert Yamato Fujimori (b. 2001), married Isabela Merced (b. 2001)\n\n(6) Prince Kenji Fujimori (b. 1980), married Silvana Arias (b. 1982)\n\n(7) Prince Yamato Fujimori (b. 2003)\n\n(8) Prince Kenji Fujimori Jr. (b. 2005)\n\n(9) Princess Silvana Anna Fujimori (b. 2007)\n\nCabinet[]\n\nAlbert I - Tiatoque\n\nKeiko Fujimori - Crown Princess\n\nJuan Carrasco - Minister of the Armed Forces\n\nAlex Alexander huerta Avendaño - Minister of Intelligence\n\nGeneral Manuel Gómez de la Torre - Chief of Staff\n\nGeneral César Astudillo Salcedo - Chief of Army\n\nAdmiral Ricardo Menéndez Calle - Chief of Navy\n\nAir Marshall Dante Antonio Arévalo Abate - Chief of Air Force\n\nMilitary[]\n\nArmy[]\n\nThe Imperial Army is the branch of the Imperial Incan Armed Forces tasked with safeguarding the independence, sovereignty and integrity of national territory on land through military force. Additional missions include assistance in safeguarding internal security and annexing regions of land bordering the Empire that have plentiful resources. Operational units are assigned to one of the following military regions, which are directly subordinate to the Army General Command through the Ground Operations Command.\n\nNavy[]\n\nThe Imperial Navy is the branch of the Imperial Incan Armed Forces tasked with surveillance, patrol and defense on lakes, rivers and the Pacific Ocean up to 200 nautical miles (370 km; 230 mi) from the Peruvian littoral. Additional missions include assistance in safeguarding internal security, conducting disaster relief operations and participating in international peacekeeping operations. The Navy is only large enough to cover the entirety of the coast of the Empire that borders the Pacific Ocean and many of the ships are sadly outdated.\n\nAir Force[]\n\nThe Imperial Air Force is the branch of the Imperial Incan Armed Forces tasked with defending the nation and its interests through the use of air power. Additional missions include assistance in safeguarding internal security, conducting disaster relief operations and participating in international peacekeeping operations. The Air Force is the smallest branch of the armed forces and many of it's planes are outdated.\n\nEconomy[]\n\nThe Empire's economy is dependent on commodity exports, making the economy at risk due to price volatility in the international markets and the fact Inca is hated for they are responsible for Native Brazilian Genocide. Inca no thanks to these reasons is an isolated nation with a pretty crap economic situation."
