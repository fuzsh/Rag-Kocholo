        "text": "Kenji is the main protogonist of Way of the Samurai. Kenji's name, age and gender can be changed by the player.\n\nWay of the Samurai[]\n\nThe intro of the game shows three different samurai's which depending on the player can be chosen as Kenji. The first samurai is young and has long black hair and wears black robes. The second samurai is middle-aged with his face full of scars. He has shorter hair and wears green robes. the third Kenji is young with the shortest hair and wears yellow robes. All of these hairstyles, face skin and clothing can be worn on Kenji. In Battle mode Kenji's default skin is the one with black robes.\n\nKenji starts off arriving a Rokkotsu Pass where he encounters a group of Korou soldiers, led by Hachiro Tsubohachi threatening a young woman called Suzu. The player may choose wether to fight the soldiers, tell them to stop or simply ignore them. All three decisions made by the player will lead to a different turns of events like being invited to a restourant or being tied up on train rails.\n\nTrivia[]"
