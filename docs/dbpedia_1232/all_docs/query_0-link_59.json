That has to be clarified, because it's presented as important for understanding what we're seeing. I'm guessing the one female is trying to tell the other female to fly away. \"Permanence\" in English means \"lasting forever\" as opposed to \"temporariness\". -- Ikan Kekek\n\nI think the word is 'ownership'... the desc. in Portuguese has been machine translated. --Acabashi 10:18, 16 April 2019 (UTC) Comment Fixed. Yann\n\nThe photographer's description is nonsense. This photographer regularly gives anthropomorphic descriptions to his images on Facebook. Charlesjsharp\n\nI'll Support. Charles, please feel free to oppose and send this to CR for a discussion of appropriate descriptions, because I agree that the photographer doesn't know what the subject of the dispute is. -- Ikan Kekek\n\nYour image has been reviewed and promoted\n\nCongratulations!
