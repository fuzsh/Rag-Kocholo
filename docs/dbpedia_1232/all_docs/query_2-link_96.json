        "text": "Description\n\nTaking place a couple of years after \"Rain\", many changes have been made to the school. Not only is it no longer an all boys school, several of the former students are now working as teachers while others move onto other jobs. Sora, as one of the teachers, has been living a fairly normal life as he takes Minato's place as teacher. However, he realizes that it won't stay normal for long when he sees that Sunao, who he has not seen since the events in \"Rain\", reappears in one of the halls. This game finally wraps up the story between Sora and Sunao and ends their conflict with Professor Aizawa.\n\n[taken from Wikipedia]\n\nDescription\n\nSora is a student at an all-boys' high school, and a member of the school \"Nandemoya\" (Jack-of-All-Trades) team. He has lots of friends among the student body, but is also a target for rumors, especially after his mysterious fall though the upper-floor window of one of the school buildings, which left him hospitalized. He has no memories of his childhood, including his new roommate, Sunao, who he is told is his childhood friend. He decides he is going to find out why he mysteriously fell and has lost memories.\n\n[Edited from Boys' Love Game Headquarters]\n\nDescription\n\nSunao is a transfer student to the high school, who shows up as Sora's new roommate at the time that Sora is released from the hospital. He is a childhood friend of Sora and Matsuri, and also part of the school Nandemoya team with them. Since Sora has no recollection of who he is, Sunao turns very angry and cold against him. He also seems to have some strange quirks, such as hating medicine and having strange moments where his personality seems to change...\n\n[Edited from Boy's Love Game Headquarters]\n\nDescription\n\nMatsuri is the vice-president of the student body and superintendent of the dormitory, and also the one behind the school Nandemoya team. He is a friend from childhood of both Sora and Sunao. He has a very sunny personality and is also a bit playfully devious, enjoying playing tricks or teasing Sora and Sunao. He has a hobby for photography and one never knows when they could end up on his film.\n\n[Edited from Boys' Love Game Headquarters]\n\nDescription\n\nThe other personality in Sora who was created to protect both he and Ran. He seems to be able to manipulate Sora's emotions, memories, and even his five senses. He only shows up when teasing Sora, when he's in a pinch, or when he wants to take care of Ran.\n\nHis personality is inspired by Shin'ichirou, who Sora admired as a child. However, because he is an embodiment of Sora's admiration for him, he is more flawless than Shin'ichirou and has an unrealistic side to him.\n\nContrary to the simple Sora, he is always relaxed and does not show his true feelings. He is always smiling, playing games, and flirting with Sora. Ran is the most important person in his life, but he also seems to be very fond of Sora. After meeting Sora in the spirit world, he is able to communicate with him in his mind.\n\n[Translated from official bio]\n\nDescription\n\nA boy training to be a pastor at a church near Shin'ichirou's office. He attends the same school as Sora and believes the latter is possessed by an evil spirit, so he is looking for an opportunity to exorcise it.\n\nHe is a good source of information but is also just a natural klutz. He is polite, kind, pure, and tries his best in everything he does.\n\n[Translated from official website]\n\nDescription\n\nHe is an energetic boy who used to make requests to the sky. He loves sports and is always cheerful, frequently running around like a puppy. Although he does not belong to any clubs, he is a valued member of sports clubs as a helper.\n\nHe often breaks things because he can't stay still for even a few moments, but thanks to his easygoing personality, he doesn't get in trouble that much.\n\n<hidden by spoiler settings>\n\n[Translated from official website]\n\nDescription\n\nHe is a beautiful boy who transferred to Sei and Fuuta's class. He loves chemistry, and he transferred to this school because he admires Gaku, who is in the university club, but he is disappointed to find out that the chemistry club does not exist.\n\nHe is the most beautiful boy in the school, but he does not make a good impression on those around him because of his cold, inaccessible atmosphere. However, once he has gotten to know a person, he is very open and honest with them.\n\nHe is especially obedient to Gaku, whom he admires.\n\n[Translated from official website]"
