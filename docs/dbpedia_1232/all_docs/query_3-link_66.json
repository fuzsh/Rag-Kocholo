In the course of a series of conversations, we began to realize that scholars of Peru had not grappled in a systematic way with whether, how, or to what extent Peruvian politics should be viewed as post-conflict. We were also struck by the fact that the scholarship in political science on postconflict settings emphasized processes like international intervention, peace building, demobilization, and the creation of new institutions, none of which characterized the period after Peru’s internal confl ict came to a close. Finding ourselves struck by this gap in our understanding of contemporary Peruvian politics, we saw answering these questions as a crucial missing element in the national conversation about the violence of what we will call in the Introduction the “long eighties.” We therefore decided to draw on the community of scholars working on Peru to begin a conversation around these questions. In so doing, we thought it very important to bring together scholars, mostly but not exclusively in the discipline of political science, from the English-speaking academic community with those based in Peru, in the hope that our contribution to the academic literature on Peruvian politics would not be divorced from the national conversation about these issues in the country we all study. We are gratified by the willingness of so many excellent scholars to join our project; working with our authors has been not only a real pleasure but also an enlightening experience. We are not exaggerating in saying that we have learned a great deal in the\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb vii\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\nviii Preface\n\ncourse of reading drafts of these chapters and engaging in conversation with their authors. Our fi rst and most important thanks goes to the David Rockefeller Center for creating a vibrant intellectual community around Latin American politics. We are also grateful to the center and to Merilee Grindle, its director at the time, for supporting a conference that gathered most of the chapter authors for an initial conversation about these issues. Paola Ibarra played an especially important role in providing logistical support for the conference, and Steve Levitsky, generous in so many ways, also supported our application for funding. That initial conference provided us with the opportunity to begin developing our thinking about how to contextualize legacies of the violence Peru experienced in the “long eighties.” We did this by bringing together esteemed Peruvianists and experts on other Latin American countries marked by legacies of conflict to discuss early drafts of many of the chapters, and by bringing the chapters in dialogue with one another. In addition to the authors of the chapters in this volume, we thank Jorge Domínguez, Angelica Durán-Martínez, Richard Snyder, and Jocelyn Viterna for joining us and contributing so much to our discussion. We were also very lucky to benefit from the presence and comments of David Scott Palmer. We were saddened to hear of his passing as the production process concluded. We also thank Amanda Milena Alvarez for her careful note-taking, which freed us to actively participate in the lively conversations over two intellectually stimulating days. We are grateful to Kerry Webb for her interest in the project, and to her and Angelica Lopez-Torres for guiding it through the review process so smoothly. Two anonymous reviewers provided insight on each chapter and how to better tie them together to arrive at a holistic answer to the question with which we began: to what extent and in what ways are Peruvian politics post-confl ict? We are grateful to them for their comments. Finally, we would like to acknowledge the support of our family members, who kept us motivated when we needed it and distracted us when we needed a break. Hillel would like to thank Annie Stilz, who has lived with this project for so many years, compensated only by promises of more meals in Lima, and Rachel, who arrived partway through the long process of revisions. Alberto thanks Maria Ines Vasquez, who provided, as usual, invaluable doses of love and intelligence all along the way, and Ricardo Vergara and Lula Paniagua, his parents, with whom he started to discuss these issues back in the eighties.\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb viii\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nLeaving the Path Behind Hillel David Soifer and Alberto Vergara\n\nThis book explores how the Internal Armed Conflict (IAC) of the long decade of the 1980s has affected Peruvian politics thereafter.1 Although myriad consequences of the conflict are frequently mentioned in debates on contemporary Peruvian politics, this book constitutes an initial attempt to provide a unified and systematic assessment of the extent and nature of its effects. This is, of course, not the fi rst study of the conflict: as time has passed, bringing both more information and the critical distance that analysis requires, our understanding of the Shining Path’s violence and the Peruvian state’s reaction has grown steadily. Early in the 1980s the most important research on the confl ict was spurred by surprise about its outbreak and centered on the rural (and purportedly indigenous) character of the Shining Path insurrection (see McClintock 1984; Palmer 1986). The late 1980s saw scholarly debate about whether the movement was in essence modern or millenarian (Degregori 1991b). Early in the 1990s the duration of the conflict and the country’s general crisis generated a body of work in which scholars contemplated the abyss (Palmer 1992; Poole and Rénique 1992); in the second half of the decade researchers strove to respond both to the unexpected and sudden end of the confl ict and to its link to the emergence of the authoritarian regime of Alberto Fujimori (Stern 1998c); and in the 2000s the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Comisión de la Verdad y Reconciliación del Perú, or CVR) elaborated a comprehensive report (CVR 2003a) while Peru was reestablishing democracy. Since then, a new body of work has reinterpreted the emergence and development of the IAC and has started to ask about its consequences (Wilson 2013; Burt 2007; La Serna 2012; Heilman 2010; Theidon 2012; del Pino 2017).\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 1\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis volume adds to the previous body of scholarship by systematically exploring how the IAC has affected contemporary politics and institutions in Peru. As this introduction will make clear, our analysis diverges from diagnoses claiming that the IAC is the central factor shaping contemporary Peru, as well as from those that dismiss its impact. Instead, we argue that the IAC left important legacies, but that as time passes these coexist with, affect, and are affected by a variety of other variables and processes. Thus legacies from violence—and from other historical processes—inevitably mesh with new historical processes to shape contemporary politics. The past of brutal violence has not left Peruvians, but the country is not defined only by this past. Our main task in this book is therefore to disentangle the intricacies of legacies of violent conflict from other historical legacies, and from the autonomous political and institutional development of contemporary Peru. We believe we substantiate the claim that the IAC left important traces in the country, but that it also has had divergent and unequal consequences, ranging from a mild impact on some dimensions of contemporary politics to a fundamental influence on others. By disaggregating the concept of legacies and exploring in detail some distinct dimensions of recent politics, we show the extent, and also the limits, of the conflict’s impact on contemporary Peru. The following pages of this introduction lay out a theoretical framework that will allow our contributors to investigate the consequences of the IAC in contemporary Peruvian politics and institutions. We begin by describing basic elements of the conflict that Peru suffered in what we call the “long eighties.” The second section of the introduction provides an overview of the legacies that the comparative politics literature has attributed to the Peruvian conflict and highlights some points of departure for our reexamination of these issues. Third, we lay out an original theoretical framework to assess the consequences of the conflict for contemporary Peruvian politics. We close by briefly introducing the book’s chapters.\n\nThe “Long Eighties” In 1978, after ten years of military dictatorship, Peruvians elected a Constituent Assembly that would guide the country into a new democratic era. Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre, the long-standing leader of the Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana (APRA), received the\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 2\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nlargest number of votes, and after half a century of persecution he was elected president of the Constituent Assembly. Communist parties, allowed to participate, received a third of the vote and constituted a solid new political bloc. This assembly produced the 1979 constitution, which established universal franchise for the fi rst time in Peru’s history. Governed by this document, Peru held its fi rst genuinely democratic general elections in 1980: for the fi rst time in the nation’s history, there were no proscribed political parties, and no adult citizen was legally denied the right to vote (see Sanborn 1991). Yet even as a tide of democratization swept across Latin America in the next decade, the period came to be labeled as the “lost decade” because of the severe economic crisis that swept across the region. In Peru, however, the 1980s were a twofold loss, as economic disaster unfolded hand-in-hand with harsh political violence. The Partido Comunista del Perú-Sendero Luminoso (which we will call the Shining Path, Sendero Luminoso, or SL throughout the volume) launched what it termed its “popular war” against the Peruvian state in 1980. As chapter 1, by José Luis Rénique and Adrián Lerner, traces, this declaration of hostilities initially went unnoticed in the Peruvian public sphere. When news of its emergence spread early in the decade, political leaders and government agencies saw the insurrection as a bad joke. Thirteen years later, when the Shining Path was defeated and the confl ict came to an end, the country had suffered, according to the government-sponsored Truth and Reconciliation Report of 2003, more than sixty thousand conflict-related deaths (CVR 2003a). The report described the conflict as the longest and broadest in national history, while showing that it inflicted higher costs both in human and economic terms than did the war against Chile in the nineteenth century. In 1993, the same year that the Shining Path leader Abimael Guzmán asked for a halt to hostilities, Peru approved a new constitution pushed by the fujimorista majority that ended the shortlived democratic experiment embodied in the 1979 constitution. This period of democratic experiment, economic crisis, and insurgency from 1979 to 1993 is what we call the “long eighties.” The Shining Path was a Maoist faction initially situated within the highly fragmented Peruvian Left of the 1970s. Its aim, inspired by the ideology of Mao Zedong and Peruvian thinker José Carlos Mariátegui, was to trigger a bloody revolution that would tear apart the Peruvian state. The Shining Path was a peculiar insurgency from a Latin American perspective both in terms of the messianic cult of its leader,\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 3\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nAbimael Guzmán, also known as “Presidente Gonzalo,” and in terms of its indiscriminate use of violence (Gorriti 1990; Degregori 1991b; La Serna 2012; Heilman 2010; Hinojosa 1998; Portocarrero 2012). Between 1980 and 1982 violence began to escalate, especially in Ayacucho, where five provinces were placed under a state of emergency in October 1981. 2 In 1982 Shining Path actions increased in the central Andes, which resulted in the replacement of the ineffective police by the Peruvian armed forces. As a result of both of these shifts, the violence escalated at the end of 1982 and the insurrection achieved national scope. In 1983, the killing of eight journalists from important Lima media outlets in the highlands of Ayacucho brought national attention to the confl ict for perhaps the fi rst time, revealing the barbarous violence that had silently enveloped the central Andes. Between 1983 and 1986 several massacres took place in the southern and central highlands departments of Ayacucho, Huancavelica, Junín, and Apurímac.3 To make things worse, the Movimiento Revolucionario Túpac Amaru (MRTA), a Cuban-inspired urban group, launched its own armed uprising against the Peruvian state in 1984.4 The second half of the 1980s saw several important shifts in the conflict. The Alan García administration elected in 1985 tried to implement a new development-centered strategy against insurgents, but this approach quickly failed. In 1986 the state massacred hundreds of Shining Path members in several jails, and the MRTA opened a whole new front of violence in the Peruvian jungle. In 1988 a paramilitary group called Rodrigo Franco burst into the confl ict, perpetrating a few selected killings. By the end of the 1980s, the economy hit bottom, which favored a brutal Shining Path offensive especially targeted at the capital city of Lima. Simultaneously, as chapter 4, by Hillel David Soifer and Everett A. Vieira III, details, the army’s counterinsurgency strategy switched from broadly indiscriminate violence to more targeted attacks. After the election of Alberto Fujimori in 1990, Grupo Colina, a new paramilitary group, carried out several massacres and other acts of violence, and by 1991 around half of the Peruvian population was living under a state of emergency. The confl ict took a sharp turn in 1992, when Guzmán was captured and the Shining Path’s fortunes declined sharply. In 1993 all the main Shining Path leaders asked for a peace accord, though a marginal contingent formed a faction called Prosequir that continued the armed conflict in jungle areas. Heavily associated with drug-dealing, Prosequir’s impact was marginal. With these events, the decade of the long eighties came to a close in 1993 and the legacies of the IAC started to be identifiable.\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 4\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nIt was a long confl ict with traumatic effects on the country. The CVR report, using statistical techniques designed to account for the underreporting of civilian victimization, estimates that approximately sixty-nine thousand people died. Unlike in every other case of internal conflict in Latin America or most such confl icts around the world, in Peru the deadliest actor was not state forces, but the Shining Path, to which the CVR report attributed responsibility for 54 percent of all deaths. Adding to the trauma, the violence was widespread across Peru. Only two of the country’s twenty-five departments, Moquegua and Madre de Dios, had no reports in the CVR investigation of casualties related to the political violence. The CVR report found that the central Andean region was particularly affected by the violence, with Ayacucho alone containing 40 percent of the victims. Almost 40 percent of the casualties were suffered by the poorest quintile of the country’s population, mainly in rural areas, and 75 percent of all deaths were among speakers of an indigenous language, compared to some 25 percent of the total population. Hence, the demographic and territorial disparities in violence revealed deep and historical divisions within Peru. And yet all this destruction was only part of the Peruvian “lost decade.” The devastation of the IAC was accompanied by economic mismanagement that contributed to an unprecedented general crisis. Between 1980 and 1989, Peru’s gross domestic product (GDP) contracted by 4.8 percent as the productive capacity of the country plummeted (Llosa and Paniza 2015). The fiscal deficit reached 12 percent of GDP in 1989, and in the same year inflation rose by more than 3,000 percent. In 1990 inflation reached 7,500 percent, and the Peruvian GDP per capita fell to 1960 levels (Banco Central de Reserva del Perú 2005). Between 1985 and 1990 the rate of formal employment shrank from 53 percent to a mere 5 percent of the employed population (Parodi 2008). In addition to economic collapse, a cholera epidemic ravaged the country in 1991, affecting at least 700,000 citizens (MINSA 2011). In a nutshell, the IAC and other social and economic factors not only brought on a political and economic crisis but left the country on the verge of a crisis of stateness (Corrales 2003). A new phase in Peruvian history began in the mid-nineties with the 1993 constitution, which still rules the country today, as discussed in chapter 3, by Maxwell A. Cameron. This new institutional framework for Peruvian politics and society was followed in the new millennium by an exceptional cycle of economic growth that transformed much of the Peruvian society. This new phase has implied, in both ob-\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 5\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\njective and subjective terms, the onset of a post-conflict period. If we accept the objective quantitative threshold of one thousand casualties per year often used to defi ne a civil war (see, for example, Kalyvas and Balcells 2010), then Peru’s conflict ended in 1994. In more subjective terms, although a few remnants of the Shining Path have survived in the Peruvian jungle, for most Peruvians “the era of terrorism” is doubtless a matter of the past, though as Arturo Maldonado, Jennifer Merolla, and Elizabeth Zechmeister show in chapter 10, the fear of terrorism nonetheless remains highly salient. Based on this discussion and our reading of the broader literature, we use the term “post-confl ict” to refer to the aftermath of conflict within Peru that involved significant violence by multiple armed actors against both one another and the civilian population. Although we do not seek to pin down an exact moment when Peru became “postconflict,” we defi ne this period as encompassing the years from the mid-1990s to the present. This volume thus seeks to explore legacies of the conflict of the long 1980s that have affected and continue to affect Peruvian politics.\n\nLegacies in Comparative Perspective The literature on contemporary Peruvian politics is divided between scholarship attributing a decisive effect to the confl ict and giving it a central causal role in explaining outcomes of interest, and work that downplays its effects to focus instead on other features of the country’s history or more contemporary causal factors. This volume seeks to assess this surprising disjunction by evaluating which features of post-confl ict Peruvian politics have been decisively shaped by the IAC, which have been affected in less fundamental but still important ways, and which seem to be a product of other causal forces. A significant body of scholarship on Latin American and Andean politics has argued that the Peruvian case diverges from its counterparts in several important ways. Very often the political violence of the eighties is said to be the crucial variable that explains these anomalies. Arguments along these lines have been especially common in research on the development of civil society. In these accounts, social organization in Peru is said to be distinctively fragmented and weak as a result, at least partially, of the IAC. During the fi rst years of the new millennia, when indigenous movements successfully emerged in\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 6\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nAndean countries, Peru was an “anomaly” with no national indigenous movements (Yashar 2005, 240). Mallon (1998) largely attributed the absence of ethnic identification among Peru’s popular sectors to class-based conceptions of politics that dominated the Peruvian Left and Shining Path. Even more directly, Yashar (2005) compares Peru to Bolivia and Ecuador, and argues that in contrast to these neighboring countries, violence disrupted indigenous social organizations and networks in Peru, making it hard to politicize and mobilize ethnic divisions. And contrary to other cases in the Andean countries, ethnic parties also failed to emerge in Peru, which Van Cott (2005) claims was a consequence of the IAC. In essence, scholars have argued that the whole chain of ethnic politics, from identity to party representation passing through social organization, was severely impacted by the conflict. Scholars have also attributed the evolution of Peru’s political parties in the last decades to the IAC. The weakness of the Peruvian Left over recent decades is especially striking in comparative perspective (Levitsky and Roberts 2011). The IAC is said to have played a prominent role in this weakness: “If the Shining Path exacerbated social fragmentation, it also contributed to the polarization of the IU” (Roberts 1998, 260). One mechanism driving this outcome was the sense of fear that arose in Left-aligned civil society leaders during the confl ict, which had the effect of weakening social movements (Burt 2006). In the same vein, legacies of violence constituted a hurdle shared by the Peruvian and Colombian Left, two countries that did not join the socalled Left Turn (Cameron 2011, 394). On the opposite side of the contemporary political spectrum, the enduring presence of a fujimorista party has been attributed to the enormous popularity Alberto Fujimori gathered after his government defeated the Shining Path (Levitsky and Zavaleta 2016). Finally, the weakness of Peru’s regional parties and regional elites has also been traced back to the IAC (Vergara 2015a). In contrast, other studies of post-confl ict Peru have not granted the same causal importance to the IAC.5 Kenney (2004) provides an explanation of the breakdown of Peruvian democracy in 1992 that centers on the lack of cooperation between the executive and legislative branches. After the 1992 self-coup (autogolpe) that Fujimori carried out, several researchers focused on the politics and policies of the new political era. Many accounts of the neoliberal turn in Peru attribute no significant effect to the IAC in exploring either the introduction\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 7\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nof neoliberal policies or their effects (Wise 1994; Arce 2005). Nor do scholars explaining the implementation of new poverty alleviation programs (Schady 2000) or of decentralization (McNulty 2011) attribute a causal role to the violence of the 1980s. More recent research on democracy and technocracy in Peru has also given only marginal room to the IAC (Dargent 2015; Vergara and Encinas 2016). Similarly, work by scholars like Arce (2014) and Meléndez (2012) attributes the recent expansion of local conflicts and protest in Peru to contemporary political and economic factors and sets aside the causal role of the IAC, as do recent accounts of Peruvian “democracy without parties” (Levitsky 2013; Zavaleta 2014). Hence, as we see, the weight given to the IAC in scholarly explorations of contemporary Peruvian politics varies fundamentally, ranging from key explanatory piece to ignored process. By digging into the Peruvian case in detail, this book attempts to provide a systematic analysis of these issues. We seek not to challenge or confi rm any particular fi ndings cited in the preceding paragraphs, but rather to produce a synthetic account of the consequences of the IAC for contemporary Peruvian politics. To do so, we unpack several dimensions of contemporary Peruvian politics, society, and institutions to evaluate the extent to which they have and have not been shaped by the IAC. This systematic evaluation requires a framework that takes history seriously. As we explain in the next section, we need a careful temporal framework to distinguish causal chains that originated in the long eighties from factors that emerged thereafter, and also to distinguish the confl ict from the longer historical processes of a fragmented society, polarized politics, and weak institutions that long predate it, and that also shape contemporary Peru in fundamental ways.\n\nStudying Post-Conflict Peru In laying the groundwork for the chapters that follow, several thorny methodological challenges in the study of post-confl ict politics must be confronted. First, we cannot simply draw from the existing scholarship on post-confl ict settings, because it sheds only limited light on our case. Scholars of post-confl ict politics have tended to explore issues like peace negotiations and the implementation of the resulting accords (Walter 2002; Fortna 2003; Barnett 2006), the effects of in-\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 8\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nternational intervention in bringing an end to confl ict and securing peace (Paris 2004; Fortna 2008; Stanley 2013), the political integration of former combatants (Blattman 2009; Humphreys and Weinstein 2008), and the outcomes and impact of post-confl ict reconstruction projects (Baranyi 2008; Call and Wyeth 2008). Yet none of these processes unfolded in Peru. In the Latin American context, much has been written about how violence, defi ned broadly enough to include inequality and social exclusion, has marked societies. To take but one example, the collection edited by Koonings and Kruijt (1999) investigates the “long-term consequences of violence, repression, and arbitrariness” (p. 2). Tracing the roots of this violence to social inequality, especially in the rural realm, and to struggles over political incorporation and social inclusion, they see it as one of the crucial “recurrent features of the Latin American political landscape” (p. 2). In studying the “legacies of repressive dictatorships and civil wars” (p. 3) they seek to explore the origins and consequences of violence in contemporary Latin America. Yet in focusing on the legacies of the Sendero conflict, our collection takes a distinct approach. To understand why we focus on a specific confl ict rather than the broader phenomenon of violence, one need only note a striking irony of the Peruvian confl ict: Sendero Luminoso’s armed insurgency began on the very day that democracy returned to Peru in 1980, and the end of the conflict coincided not with democratization but with the consolidation of the authoritarian regime of Alberto Fujimori. It is reasonable to situate a specific internal confl ict as nothing more than part of a broader phenomenon of structural violence in a case like Guatemala, where armed opposition emerged due to the level of repression and political closure, and thus the civil war itself can be seen as a consequence of the nature of authoritarian rule (Wickham-Crowley 1992; Goodwin 2001). But for the Peruvian case, as chapter 1, by Rénique and Lerner, and chapter 2, by Livia Isabella Schubiger and David Sulmont, make clear, the internal conflict cannot be reduced to being only a reflection or a component of broader processes of repression and inequality. We do not deny that long structural patterns of exclusion might affect the conflict—and chapter 6, by Jelke Boesten, shows these in an especially vivid manner in exploring issues of gender violence in contemporary Peru. However, beyond these longterm continuities, the armed confl ict generated its own set of independent causal impacts on politics. This book is based on the presumption that these effects are worthy of exploration in their own right.\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 9\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\n10 Introduction\n\nTherefore, we deal with the political legacies of confl ict rather than post-confl ict peace and reconstruction processes (most of which did not unfold in the Peruvian case) or legacies of violence more generally. To do so, we develop a new approach to studying the impact of the conflict in Peru. We hope that our new approach might not only shed light on the political legacies of the IAC but also aid scholars of other post-confl ict settings as well, should they seek to shift their attention from the issues now central to that literature to the political impact of the conflict itself. Since our focus is the set of legacies of the IAC that shape post-confl ict politics, we need to begin by delineating the boundaries of what we mean by “political legacies.” In taking on this challenge, we seek to complement a rich body of recent work that has explored the aftermath of the conflict in ways that are distinct to the approach we seek to develop. Kimberly Theidon and others taking an anthropological approach have superbly analyzed relationships within and among local communities after the conflict (Theidon 2012; del Pino and Yezer 2013). Olga Gonzáles and Cynthia Milton, among others, have explored the traces the confl ict has left on artistic and cultural expression (Gonzalez 2011; Milton 2014; Faverón 2006). Other academics have peered into the memories of main actors (Milton 2018; Asencios 2017).6 Our book does not investigate the cultural dimensions of the confl ict’s aftermath or observe it from a micro level. Instead, we focus on the macropolitical and institutional consequences of the confl ict. In focusing on these consequences, we seek to respond to what Blattman and Miguel (2010, 43) describe as “perhaps the most pressing area for future empirical research” on post-conflict settings: the “social and institutional legacies” of confl ict. Understanding those legacies is exactly the goal of this book. However, we do not believe it is possible to generate analytically precise causal claims if we do not disaggregate the results beyond broad concepts like institutions or “democracy” (see Kier and Krebs 2010). In seeking causal precision, we explore how the legacies of the conflict shaped political institutions, civil society, and political attitudes and participation. That is, we unpack the macropolitical consequences, allowing us to provide a nuanced analysis of post-confl ict Peru disaggregated across distinct political, social, and institutional realms. But before turning to a description of these realms and introducing the chapters to follow, we need to defi ne the concept of post-confl ict legacies and identify a set of mechanisms by which the legacies of conflict can be produced.\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 10\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nDisaggregating the Legacies of Conflict To explore the legacies of Peru’s conflict, we distinguish three causal channels through which its effects are produced and reproduced, and by which it has impacted contemporary Peruvian politics: wartime mechanisms, post-confl ict legacies, and the political struggle over legacies. Wartime Mechanisms By wartime mechanisms we refer to those factors that were produced by the conflict, emerged during the confl ict period, and have persisted into the post-confl ict era. These are what Wittenberg (n.d.) calls “continuation legacies” in his typology. The most prominent set of wartime mechanisms discussed by our authors relate to the violence itself: the chapters by Eduardo Dargent and Noelia Chávez (chapter 5), Maritza Paredes (chapter 7), Paula Muñoz (chapter 8), and Alberto Vergara and Daniel Encinas (chapter 9), among others, show that violence impacted the social and political organization of many sectors of Peruvian society in ways that endured after the conflict ended. While in most cases the effects tended to weaken societal and political actors, Paredes shows that indigenous organization in the Amazon region was strengthened in response to violence, and Vergara and Encinas show that violence led to the growth of a more powerful and more conservative Catholic Church as a central actor. In chapter 3, Cameron explores how the broader sense of crisis engendered by the confl ict created the opportunity for Fujimori not only to carry out his autogolpe but also to craft a constitution that solidified authoritarian and neoliberal control. Like Cameron, Soifer and Vieira show in chapter 4 that institutional changes made during the confl ict— in this case, reforms of the security apparatus—persisted long after the conflict ended. Post-Conﬂict Legacies In contrast to wartime mechanisms, which refer to aspects of the political arena that were altered during the conflict, post-confl ict legacies refer to those factors that emerge in the post-confl ict era as the result of effects of the conflict era. We thus defi ne post-confl ict legacies as factors that emerge in the post-confl ict period as the result of the con-\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 11\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\n12\n\nIntroduction\n\nflict. Here, too, violence itself is an especially important mechanism. Maldonado, Merolla, and Zechmeister, for example, show in chapter 10 that worry about terrorism remains strikingly high in Peru by comparison to other Latin American countries, and that this fear is especially salient among the cohort of Peruvians who lived through the conflict. This fear not only persists over time but also has sizable and systematic effects on democratic attitudes. In a similar vein, Dargent and Chávez show in chapter 5 that the violence in public universities in the 1980s contributed to the weakening of student mobilization in the post-confl ict period, and Muñoz shows in chapter 8 that the Left’s inability to distance itself from Sendero’s actions during the conflict led it to “become associated in political discourse with terrorism.” Another set of post-confl ict legacies centers on civil society. Here, the effects are distinct in different sectors of society: while Vergara and Encinas show in chapter 9 that the weakening of those sectors of civil society that supported parties of the Right has empowered technocrats and therefore reinforced neoliberal continuity, Paredes shows in chapter 7 that the human rights groups and lawyer-activists that emerged during the confl ict and were strengthened by international support after the confl ict ended (and especially in the later years of the Fujimori regime) were important allies for indigenous actions in the post-confl ict period. A third set of legacies is highlighted in chapter 3 by Cameron, who seeks to explain neoliberal continuity. Cameron highlights the continuing resonance of neoliberal ideology that emerged during the conflict, and the ways it has been sustained by the kind of state built in the post-confl ict era. Struggle over Legacies Whereas both wartime mechanisms and post-conflict legacies are products of features of the conflict period, a third category of ways in which post-confl ict politics is shaped by the conflict results from the choices and struggles of political actors, who frame, shape, and manipulate features of the confl ict and its legacies for their own purposes (Krebs 2009, 255). We separate the discussion of legacies that take this form in order to highlight the agency of political actors in shaping them, and to label these constructed legacies. The most commonly echoed type of constructed legacy our authors highlight is the stigmatization of the Left (Muñoz, chapter 8), human rights issues (Paulo\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 12\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nDrinot, chapter 11), and collective mobilization more generally (Dargent and Chávez, chapter 5) as associated with terrorism. On the other side, activists have also at times sought to exploit acts committed by the state, especially ones that occurred under the Fujimori administration. Another use of constructed legacies appears in intra-state and intra-elite power struggles; Soifer and Vieira show in chapter 4 that memories of the conflict were used by actors seeking to strengthen the intelligence and surveillance apparatus in the Fujimori era, and Cameron shows more broadly in chapter 3 that pro-neoliberal actors have sought to frame the conflict in a way that justifies the neoliberal model as a central component of the defense against a recurrence of the unrest of the 1980s. Incorporating this type of legacy into our analysis allows us to trace both the direct and objective legacies of the confl ict, and the impact of the more subjective or constructed struggles on the legacies of the conflict. The confl ict left objective legacies, but the political struggle over the interpretation or construction of those legacies can be as important as the objective ones.\n\nDisaggregating Consequences In all, this volume aims to provide a nuanced account of the consequences of the IAC for politics in contemporary Peru. We do not presume or argue that the IAC is the most central factor shaping politics in contemporary Peru. Peru, to put it simply, is “post-too many things”: contemporary Peru might be described as not just postconflict, but also post-hyperinflation, post-party system collapse, and post-authoritarian. Instead of arguing that the post-conflict lens is the most useful frame for understanding Peruvian politics, we seek to evaluate the extent of its utility. The country is still shaped by the IAC of the long eighties, but as time goes on, it becomes harder to disentangle consequences of the IAC from all the other variables and processes that have also affected Peru in the two decades since the IAC was fi nished.7 These include a booming economy (Ghezzi and Gallardo 2013), the emergence of a new middle class (World Bank 2013), the deterioration of political representation (Levitsky and Zavaleta 2016), and the ever-increasing presence of informality (W. Mendoza 2017), among others. However, we do believe that the IAC unleashed some legacies that\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 13\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\n14\n\nIntroduction\n\nsignificantly shaped some areas of contemporary politics and institutions in Peru. In order to grasp them, we need to unpack the broad notion of “contemporary politics” into manageable realms and explore each in turn. The book divides contemporary politics into four realms in which we observe the consequences of the confl ict: state institutions, civil society, political parties, and public opinion, each of which is divided into specific dimensions that are the subject of individual chapters. This analytical approach allows us to make precise claims about the causal link between the IAC and each of those dimensions. Our framework distinguishing three types of legacies and the authors’ focus on case studies of the Peruvian experience rather than sustained and systematic comparisons with other Latin American countries allows us to construct a careful and detailed picture of the consequences of the IAC on contemporary Peru. The concluding chapter of this volume by Steven Levitsky synthesizes the earlier chapters’ fi ndings to establish the extent to which the country is and is not decisively shaped by the confl ict. The book’s fi rst section provides historical and theoretical background. Chapter 1 gives a detailed historical overview of the IAC in Peru, while chapter 2 places the Peruvian case in the context of the contemporary political science scholarship on internal confl icts. The next section deals with state institutions. Chapter 3 highlights how neoliberal ideology, enshrined in the 1993 constitution, both took hold in Peru in response to Sendero’s perceived threat to individual freedom and was sustained by the discrediting of other ideologies in the course of the long decade of conflict. Chapter 4 explores how the conflict shaped the state’s coercive capacity, emphasizing how reforms of the military and of policing and surveillance institutions, as well as the reach of the state over territory, were the product of all three of the types of mechanisms elaborated in this introduction. Chapter 5 investigates how the conflict deepened the crisis of Peru’s public university system in several important ways. The third section explores civil society and the impact of the IAC. Chapter 6 makes the case that both ineffectual state policies against gender violence and recent mass mobilization defending women’s rights can be traced to the IAC. Chapter 7 focuses on indigenous mobilization in the political context of the contemporary boom in extractive development in Peru, which provides a new setting for the study of indigenous movements and the responses they draw from the state. Both chapters show that the IAC had a decisive impact on contemporary Peruvian civil society, and that its effects continue to be felt.\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 14\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nIn the fourth section, on political parties, chapter 8 analyzes the link between the IAC and the leftist sectors of the political spectrum, while chapter 9 examines connections to the political right. In chapter 8, Muñoz contends that the end of political violence came with not only the military defeat of the Shining Path but also the political defeat of the legal Left. She argues that the prospects of the Left for effectively becoming an institutionalized and electorally appealing political party were undermined by the manner in which the confl ict ended. Vergara and Encinas describe in chapter 9 the transformation of the Right from organic political parties in the 1980s to a new condition they label as a “conservative archipelago.” Part of this transformation, they contend, was related to the IAC. The fifth section contains two chapters dealing with Peruvian public opinion, though from very different perspectives. Chapter 10 provides a statistical and experimental analysis of the attitudes of Peruvian citizens toward terrorism and their implications for democratic support. In contrast, chapter 11 takes a qualitative approach in exploring the comments of YouTube users on videos related to memorials of the conflict in order to document the collective struggle to construct the memory of the IAC in the absence of a collective memory project in the country. The volume’s conclusion places all of these in-depth chapters in a wider Latin American perspective, producing a synthetic evaluation of the ways in which contemporary Peruvian politics are decisively shaped by the IAC. In all, our aim in compiling this volume is to deepen the process of analytical inquiry into the legacies of violence for contemporary Peru. Yet we seek to go beyond that: for most of the contributors of the book, the Shining Path’s brutal actions, and the consequences they unleashed, were vivid, tragic, and major events. As Schubiger and Sulmont remind us in their chapter, the department of Ayacucho, where the conflict began and had the deadliest consequences, saw an absolute loss of population between the censuses of 1981 and 1993. The “long eighties” were, in other words, a national catastrophe. Regardless of where we stand politically or how we interpret such a history of violence, it is clear that the scars and legacies of the confl ict continue to trouble its heirs in ways that cannot be ignored. Recognizing and analyzing these effects in a systematic manner is an indispensable step on the path to developing a national conversation about the confl ict. Such a national dialogue, as Drinot’s chapter shows, has not emerged in a rational or inclusive way. Instead, a systematic understanding of the conflict and its legacies seems to remain elusive and opaque for\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 15\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\n16 Introduction\n\nmost Peruvians. Expanding on Dargent and Chavez’s insightful description of contemporary university students, what seems to prevail in the country is a “silent majority.” Our aim, then, beyond our academic purposes, is to help the country to recognize some of the ways in which it is shaped today by the savage violence of the long eighties, and also some of the ways in which contemporary politics is rooted in other historical factors. A clear understanding of these complex processes linking past and present will always be a necessary requirement for fi nding one’s way to a better future. Notes 1. “Internal Armed Confl ict” is the term used by the Peruvian Truth and Reconciliation Commission to characterize the violence between the Shining Path and other non-state armed groups and the Peruvian state. The notion of “long eighties” is explained below. 2. The following paragraphs rely on the CVR Final Report to constitute a brief historical reconstruction of the Peruvian Internal Armed Confl ict. For a detailed account of how the confl ict unfolded, see chapter 1 by José Luis Rénique and Adrián Lerner. 3. The army was responsible for, among others, the Sacos, Pucayacu, Accomarca, and Putis massacres; the Shining Path perpetrated, among others, the Lucanamarca and Huancasancos massacres. 4. Since the confl ict between the MRTA and the state was less bloody than that pitting Sendero against the state, and since public perception of the violence Peru suffered focused more heavily on the latter, we describe the violence from 1979 to 1993 as the Sendero confl ict throughout the volume. 5. To be fair, it is difficult to fi nd research on contemporary Peru that fully dismisses the IAC, since most of this work does attribute some role to the general turmoil of the eighties. Yet in contrast to the work discussed in the previous paragraph, the scholarship we discuss here does not grant the IAC a central role in its analyses. 6. In addition to the academic literature on cultural legacies of the conflict, a nonacademic but vivid and fruitful body of work both on the IAC and its legacies has boomed in several genres in contemporary Peru. Scholars and intellectuals personally involved in the confl ict have produced engaging and eclectic books that have resonated far beyond the academic realm (see, among others, A. Gálvez 2009; Gavilán 2012; Agüero 2015; Cisneros 2015). Fiction writers have peered into the period as well (see, among others, Roncagliolo 2006; Colchado 1997; Cueto 2005; Thays 2008; M. Vargas Llosa 1983; see also the notable graphic novel by Cossio, Rossell, and Villar 2008); and fi lmmakers have also successfully explored it (among others, see Lombardi 1988; E. Mendoza 2017; H. Gálvez 2015; del Solar 2015; C. Llosa 2009; Calero 2016). 7. On these methodological questions relating to temporality, see the analysis of the Mexican Revolution and its consequences in Knight 1985.\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 16\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\nCHAP T ER 1\n\nShining Path: The Last Peasant War in the Andes José Luis Rénique and Adrián Lerner\n\nThe process of modernization begins with peasant revolutions that fail. Ba r r i ngton Moor e , Soci a l Or igi ns of Dic tatorsh ip a n d De mocr ac y\n\nIn mid-1988 the hitherto mysterious leader of the Communist Party of Peru, better known as the Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso), broke his long silence. In his fi rst interview since the beginning of the insurrection, Abimael Guzmán Reynoso boasted of the successful progress of a rebellion whose central protagonists, he claimed, were “the poor peasants” of Peru. In Guzmán’s words, the poor played a primary role in the “People’s Guerrilla Army,” serving “as fighters and commanders.” Led by this organization, the “people’s war” spread through the highlands, “from one border to the other, from Ecuador to Bolivia,” along a region that was “the historic axis of Peruvian society and its most backward and poor area” (Guzmán Reynoso 1988). Eight years earlier, the start of the Shining Path uprising had been received with disbelief. Even as it continued to grow, leftist leaders had insisted that it was “infantile.” President Fernando Belaunde, during his second period in power (1980–1985), had labeled the insurgents “rustlers.” As late as 1983, military officers had declared that eliminating the Shining Path would take only a few weeks (CVR 2003a, 2:60). Was this, then, effectively a “peasant war”? If so, how was it possible in a country where one of the most radical agrarian reform efforts in contemporary Latin America had been recently enforced, and where more than 60 percent of the population had become urban? Why did other political and social actors seem to miss it? These questions lie at\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 17\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\n18 José Luis Rénique and Adrián Lerner\n\nthe center of the era of violence experienced by Peru during the 1980s and early 1990s: “the most intense, widespread, and prolonged period of violence in all of its republican history” according to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Comisión de la Verdad y Reconciliación del Perú, or CVR) created by the Peruvian government in 2001 to investigate it (CVR 2003a, 8:245). This chapter presents the most salient aspects and the chronology of the Internal Armed Conflict (as the CVR defi ned it) that ravaged Peru during these years. It pays particular attention to the roles attributed to the Andean peasantry as a historical subject and agent in the ideologies and practices of the two main armed sides of the confl ict, the Shining Path and the coercive forces of the Peruvian state, amid the shifting dynamics of the conflict and the broader societal transformations that characterized the period. It was a war predominantly fought and endured by peasants. Our chapter shows that the peasant character of the war was a central aspect of the revolutionary ideology and praxis of Abimael Guzmán and the Shining Path, and also of the different counterinsurgent strategies of the Peruvian state, but that the on-the-ground experiences and effects of “peasant war,” both at the local level and in broader strategic terms, were very different from the preconceptions and theoretical perspectives of these actors. We begin with an introduction to the radical tradition of which the Shining Path was a part, but from which it also departed, and to the counterinsurgent traditions of the Peruvian armed forces. The second section of the chapter focuses on Ayacucho and its place in Peruvian society and politics during the fi rst half of the 1980s, to describe and explain how a fringe Maoist group became a serious revolutionary challenge in the highlands, and then launched a war on the national scale. We then shift to an analysis of how both the Shining Path and the new Peruvian government, led by the Alianza Popular Revolucionaria Americana (APRA) and president Alan García (1985–1990), switched strategies as violence expanded its reach to new territories, and new actors emerged along with a sense of deepening national crisis. Finally, we describe the end of the war during the fi rst years of the government of Alberto Fujimori (1990–2000) and touch on some of the political uses and consequences of the confl ict’s aftermath during the 1990s. The perception of Sendero Luminoso as an alien infection that suddenly attacked Peruvian society with its dogmatic violence still looms large in the country’s collective memory. And yet, already in 1998 the historian Steve J. Stern had synthesized a generation’s worth of schol-\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 18\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\nThe Last Peasant War in the Andes\n\n19\n\narship to argue that Sendero’s origins and development were located within Peruvian history while also working against it. While the Shining Path was in many ways a logical episode in a century-old radical tradition, and part of a broader social and political process, in its extreme ideological rigidity it also defi ned itself explicitly as against other projects of change, as seen in its efforts to crush the velasquista reforms and other governmental efforts as well as all non-senderista leftist parties and initiatives emanating from civil society. A Marxist revolutionary party that advocated a peasant revolution provoked a war whose main victims were peasants and other Marxist activists, and whose immediate objective was the destruction of the Peruvian state (Stern 1998a). This paradoxical trajectory mirrored the singularities of postcolonial Peru, a society that the historian Paul Gootenberg has recently described as still carrying scars that seem to be a “perpetual obstacle” to “real horizontal bonds of nationhood, a legitimate state, real dynamic capitalism, even real modernity” (Gootenberg 2014). These were the scars of empires, wars, conquests, and revolutions past; of colonialism, liberalism, centralism, and peripheral capitalism; of the divisions and durable inequality that still defi ned the country (Tilly 1999). The other key armed actors of the conflict, the coercive forces of the Peruvian state, were also trapped by these paradoxes. The nation’s police and armed forces were marked by tense relationships with civilians in charge of political power, inter- and intra-institutional conflict and organizational dysfunction, and corruption. Pervasive rifts based on ethnicity, class, region, and gender status were exacerbated by the irregular warfare that characterized the conflict. Similarly, their participation was no less driven by ideological stances than those of Guzmán and his senderista comrades. Their strategies, their conceptions about what kind of conflict they were fighting, and their ideas about the roles they and other social actors played in the confl ict were all based on inherited diagnoses of Peruvian society, and on the application of dated Cold War counterinsurgent doctrines to the Andean countryside.\n\nPaths to War: The Radical Tradition, Maoism, and Counterinsurgency in Peru On May 17, 1980, the eve of the fi rst presidential elections in seventeen years and after more than a decade of military rule, a handful of\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 19\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\n20\n\nJosé Luis Rénique and Adrián Lerner\n\nhooded individuals ransacked an electoral center and burned the ballot boxes in the small village of Chuschi, Ayacucho. The event went largely unnoticed in the Peruvian media’s electoral coverage. In the following months, dogs were found hanging from lampposts in Lima, with signs that denounced Deng Xiaoping’s “betrayal” of Mao Zedong’s line at the helm of the People’s Republic of China. Mystery shrouded these actions. For those familiar with the intricacies of the Peruvian Left, however, there was no doubt about their senderista origins. The Shining Path was the most radical voice in a Maoist chorus derived from the moscovita–pekines (Sino–Soviet) split of the 1960s, which produced myriad “Communist Parties of Peru,” usually distinguishable by their surnames: Red Star, Red Flag, Pukallacta, Shining Path. Each claimed to be the legitimate nuclei for the “reconstruction” of Peru’s Communist Party founded in the 1920s by Jose Carlos Mariátegui. The Shining Path’s call to launch a “people’s war” was its distinctive feature. By 1980, however, few believed it was a realistic goal. The Peruvian Left had emerged in the 1920s in the symbolic space shaped by a radical tradition fi rst articulated by Manuel González Prada after the nation’s traumatic defeat in the War of the Pacific against Chile (1879–1884). A poet and essayist, González Prada penned fiery texts denouncing the Peruvian republican project as a mere continuation of colonialism, represented by the centralist power of coastal Lima, which had been founded by conquistadors as the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru to rule over the Andes and its peoples. He saw the conflict between coast and highlands as more than geographic: to craft a modern nation, radicals would have to end the dominance of costeños and criollos (those who lived on the coast and were of European descent) and fi nd a “true Peru” in the heart of the Andes, where the Indian masses still awaited redemption. The formula of a “long march” to redress the course taken since the Spanish conquest in 1532 would become a second skin for twentieth-century Peruvian leftists (Rénique 2015a). From then on, a range of “isms” (indigenismo, serranismo, incaísmo, telurismo) explored and illuminated the coast-highland gap, advocating for a Peruvian nationhood based on Andean roots. In the 1920s, two of them gained extraordinary traction. To varying degrees, the new revolutionary visions crafted by Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre and José Carlos Mariátegui, as well as the movements they founded, aprismo and comunismo, carried the imprint of this rhetorical arse-\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 20\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\nThe Last Peasant War in the Andes 21\n\nnal. While the former’s roots lay in the proletarian mixed-race (mestizo) urban and rural populations of the country’s coastal region, the latter persisted in the search for the Indians of the sierra as the main revolutionary actors. At least in theory, searching for the mobilizing myths of the Andean masses against Lima’s postcolonial domination continued to be the defi ning mark of the Peruvian Left after the defeat of the upheavals of the 1930s. Hopes for an effective long march from the countryside to the city then reappeared in the 1960s, as hundreds of peasant communities invaded haciendas throughout the highlands. Both the guerrillas of the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR) and National Liberation Army (ELN) of 1962–1966 and Juan Velasco’s Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces of 1968–1975 fell within the scope of the radical tradition. By the 1970s, Maoism was one of the three major branches of a Peruvian Left that was experiencing explosive growth. The “muscovite” Communists, together with the “reformist” groups, adopted a position of “critical support” to Velasco’s “revolution” and its agenda, which largely focused its efforts on a massive agrarian reform. However, as historian Jaymie Heilman has recently shown, it was not uncommon for grassroots actors to resent the implementation of the reforms as an outside intrusion. It could even derail some of the longstanding political struggles of increasingly dynamic peasant organizations and other activists—the men and women who in their everyday lives experienced, and indeed often successfully challenged, what generations of radicals, including the anti-oligarchic reformist generals, described as the quasi-static “true Peru” (Heilman 2017). Moreover, and despite the nationalist military regime’s atavistic, pro-peasant rhetoric, intensive demographic and socioeconomic transformations by then meant that the proverbial “true Peru” had in fact become something akin to a floating signifier. Following agrarian pressure and dislocation, massive immigration toward urban centers on the coast meant that the highlands were not the country’s demographic core anymore. Lima alone accounted for close to 30 percent of the nation’s inhabitants by the 1980s (Matos Mar 2004; Calderón Cockburn 2016). Under those circumstances, emerging groups and social movements could be the crucial targets for leftist expansion. The immigrants, the new limeños or informales, became the protagonists of the renewed revolutionary agenda drafted by a “new Left.” Inspired by the Cuban Revolution, the new Left consisted of a series of small organizations in a chronic state of atomization, all of which aspired to radicalize velas-\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 21\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\n22\n\nJosé Luis Rénique and Adrián Lerner\n\nquista reforms by riding the wave of popular mobilization triggered by the military government’s initiative. For them, José Carlos Mariátegui was still a guiding source, although now largely in conjunction with the likes of Antonio Gramsci, Alain Touraine, Ernesto Laclau, or José Aricó as part of an ideological reassessment in which democracy and the “bourgeois” culture of human rights were fundamental values. Rural scenarios, and the very idea of a long march from the countryside to the city, became secondary. For this increasingly sophisticated Left, the agrarian question no longer was at the center of Peru’s revolutionary transformation. That was clearly not the case with their Maoist comrades. They chose, instead, to wholly reject velasquismo, arguing that it was a “fascist” regime that had to be resisted through radical mobilization. The “people’s war” was their obvious next step. The senderistas were, as historian Iván Hinojosa explained, the “poor provincial cousins” of Lima’s more mainstream Left (Hinojosa 1998). While leftists in Lima were distancing themselves from the revolutionary paradigm of the 1920s, senderistas saw the reforms of the Velasco regime as an opportunity for ideological and organizational reaffi rmation. This conviction compelled them to take back the abandoned “shining path” of José Carlos Mariátegui, particularly his ideas about the peasantry as the only force capable of ending the semifeudal structures that were still the pillars of what they termed “bureaucratic capitalism” in Peru (Rénique 2003, 20–53; Rénique 2015b). In this narrative, Mariátegui remained the founding figure of a proletarian party whose legacy was at risk of being tarnished by the new Left’s “revisionism,” defi ned by Guzmán as the “complete negation of Marxism,” and usually embodied in the “long and putrid experience with frontism (frentismo).” The United Left was the latest Peruvian version of that experience; it was nothing less than “a cancer” to be “ruthlessly eliminated” (Guzmán Reynoso 1988). Mariátegui had introduced the “universal truths” of Marxism-Leninism to Peru, in a process that concluded with the emergence of the Shining Path. Their ability to initiate “popular war” was proof that they were Mariátegui’s legitimate children (Guzmán Reynoso 1989). The fusion of Mariátegui and Mao made such a fi nal step possible. In Peru, according to Guzmán, “we fi nd theses similar to those that Mao has made universal; today Mariátegui would be a Marxist-Leninist-Maoist” (Guzmán Reynoso 1988). Maoist practice, however, often contrasted with such combative rhetoric. According to a study based on the major public university\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 22\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\nThe Last Peasant War in the Andes\n\n23\n\nin Lima, Maoism captivated students of migrant backgrounds, who found it a useful tool for carving a place for themselves within a system that tended to marginalize them. A Peruvian brand of Maoism was forged largely through imagery—disseminated by Chinese propaganda—of the Great Cultural Revolution, such as Red Guards questioning the establishment at will, as well as through decontextualized quotations from Chairman Mao, which provided a veneer of ideological empowerment encouraged by the “Little Red Book” and the manuals of Marxism that originated in Beijing and Moscow (Lynch 1990). Under the influence of this Maoist campus culture, which compulsively encompassed all levels of the university community, public universities tended to enter into a self-destructive process of radicalization (Degregori 1990b). Whereas Lima’s leftist intellectuals tentatively hinted at the possibilities of formulas such as Cholo-comunismo (an Andean version of the “Eurocommunism” of those years), or even of Haya-leninismo (as the basis for a Left-APRA alliance), senderista identity seemed fi rmly poised to undertake the challenges to come. Its leader and ideologue Abimael Guzmán charted the route ahead in distinctively terse fashion: “The class gives birth to the Party and the Party rises and begins to walk, it is the child of the revolution. The Party can never be crushed or destroyed. The Party will inevitably triumph. This Party forged itself, Mariategui is its founder. It is done” (CC-PCP 1979). Closely following the Mao of the 1930s, Guzmán believed in the transformative power of peasant mobilization, “a hurricane so swift and violent that no power, however great, will be able to hold it back.” He framed the peasantry as a force capable of sweeping “all the imperialists, warlords, corrupt officials, local tyrants and evil gentry into their graves.” In the ideological-strategic scheme of the Shining Path’s leader, this massive, class-based mobilization would force every potential revolutionary to pick one of only three possible alternatives: to trail behind the peasant movement; to stand in its way and oppose it; or to march ahead and lead it toward the seizure of power (Mao 1927). By adopting the latter choice, Guzmán believed, his Communist Party of Peru– Shining Path would be forged as a party of “iron-clad cadres who dare to challenge death to snatch the laurels of victory” that was capable of unleashing a new era (Guzmán Reynoso 1988, CC-PCP 1986a). Sendero’s “people’s war” was, therefore, a fundamentally ideological product. The conviction and willpower that made it possible were based on the dissemination of a set of beliefs in which revolution was\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 23\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\n24 José Luis Rénique and Adrián Lerner\n\na precondition for true Peruvian nationhood (this was “the path” of Mariátegui and the radical tradition), and on a universal revolutionary doctrine (Marxism-Leninism-Maoism) which held that at the crucial moment of revolution, subjective “spiritual factors” could be more decisive than objective “material” ones (Cook 2014). This meant that the “Initiation of the Armed Struggle” (Inicio de la Lucha Armada— ILA), the launching of the war, was the key issue of revolution. Initiation would also solve the problem of leadership. It enthroned Abimael Guzmán as “President Gonzalo,” the supreme political chief and strategist of revolution. It turned him into the infallible creator of the theory of the people’s war in Peru—the so-called Pensamiento Gonzalo (“Gonzalo Thought”). In “Gonzalo’s” view, violence was a “suprahuman historical fact” that individuals would assume without any moral qualms. After the initiation of armed struggle, war itself would provide the elements for victory (Poole 1994). The rebellion would then start as a formidable act of will, carefully planned by its leader. Guzmán himself boasted that he was perfectly aware that “rivers of blood” would flow (Guzmán Reynoso 1988). The revolution would coincide with the recurrence of crisis in the country every ten years. Those relapses, he believed, expressed the inability of “bureaucratic capitalism” to acquire stability in a society still characterized as semi-feudal, despite the military regime’s much braggedabout agrarian reform (CC-PCP 1985). From this perspective, the crisis of the late 1970s, with its massive social mobilization that included the two largest strikes in the country’s history among its social and demographic transformations, announced itself as a particularly dramatic one. Moreover, it was combined with general elections and a regime transition from an increasingly conservative and repressive military dictatorship to electoral democracy. The candidate favored to win the presidential election was Fernando Belaunde. After having been ousted in 1968 by a coup carried out by armed forces emboldened by their anti-guerrilla campaigns of the 1960s, Belaunde could hardly have been expected to decisively deploy the military against a new revolutionary insurrection. That it also would likely take a new government some time to become fully operational would make “conditions riper for revolution.” It was “a very favorable juncture for initiating the people’s war.” This is why the Shining Path launched its war on the eve of the presidential elections (Lerner 2017; Lust 2013; Guzmán Reynoso 1988). Ideology provided the necessary cohesion. Mao’s quotations consti-\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 24\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\nThe Last Peasant War in the Andes\n\n25\n\ntuted the doctrinaire bedrock. Oral transmission was as important as the written word in filtering down the basic principles of the people’s war. Later, as combat progressed, “Gonzalo Thought,” based on the adaptation of Marxism-Leninism-Maoism to Peruvian reality, and on Guzmán’s interpretation of the ideas of José Carlos Mariátegui combined with those of Mao, became the blueprint for collective action. Mariátegui was portrayed as the discoverer of the revolutionary potential of Peru’s indigenous peasantry, who had synthesized a secular history of oppression into a class-based or “proletarian” view of what he termed “The Indian Problem” (Mariátegui 2007). Mao had inscribed peasant rebellion into a broader revolutionary tradition, going back to the “Paris commune” of 1871, and his was deemed the most advanced version of Marxism-Leninism because of its potential for success in peripheral countries. Guzmán made two visits to China during the 1960s, the second of which coincided with the early years of the Cultural Revolution and the doctrinaire debates of the Red Guard. During those trips, he took courses in politics, philosophy, and military strategy. He left a young cadre and obscure philosophy professor, originally schooled in the Stalinist bureaucratic ways of the local Communist Party, and returned fully converted and imbued with the prestige that contact with the Revolution provided. From then on, “Mao thought” was “the spiritual bomb of the poor” (Lin 1966), and “a single spark could start a prairie fi re” (Mao 1930). Guzmán thereafter oriented his political work to adapt the script of the Chinese peasant wars of the 1930s and the 1940s to the Peruvian scenario of the 1980s. His efforts coincided with an expansion of radical militancy (including Maoism) in Peru, particularly on university campuses (Rothwell 2013, 55–62). Some of the social and political fuel for the transformation of an organization that counted less than twenty members in 1970 into the juggernaut of the 1980s came from recent nationwide processes. The first was a unique cycle of agrarian mobilization. Peasants had been mobilizing, occupying lands, and generally eroding the traditional agrarian regime of the Peruvian highlands since the 1950s, but the process was decisively propelled by the state in support of its agrarian reform in the fi rst half of the 1970s. This led to the creation of a national network of organizations, from district leagues to departmental federations and a National Agrarian Confederation inaugurated in 1970 in the unused building of the Parliament. A heavily politicized and mobilized countryside was the result (Cant 2015). Although the turn to the\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 25\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\n26\n\nJosé Luis Rénique and Adrián Lerner\n\nright that followed the toppling of Velasco by the “Second Phase of the Revolution” led by General Francisco Morales Bermúdez (1975–1980) severely limited the scope of the agrarian reform, in reality its design and implementation had always proved extremely problematic. What effectively resulted was a truncated agrarian reform that left a host of unresolved problems, voids of power, and confl icts; a landscape of what Enrique Mayer has called “Ugly Stories,” many of which allowed senderista activists propitious opportunities to establish their presence locally (Mayer 2009). Finally, at the top, the unique political juncture was defi ned by a transition to democracy whereby the armed forces handed power back to the same civilian ruler they had ousted twelve years earlier. The Peruvian state was far from a unified entity as the country faced the insurgent challenge of the 1980s. In terms of the cleavage between civilian and military leaders, twelve years of a regime led by generals who constantly stressed the inability of civilians to rule had worsened lingering civilian-military distrust. As discussed in chapter 4 of this volume, the other main coercive force of the state, the police, faced numerous internal issues and also had strained relationships with both the armed forces and the civilian population. Policing was divided into three separate forces, the Civil Guard (Guardia Civil), the Republican Guard (Guardia Republicana), and the Investigative Police (Policía de Investigaciones del Perú), with different and sometimes competing and overlapping identities and functions. Recurring authoritarian regimes had used police forces for political surveillance and persecution, severely damaging their popular image. Chronic lack of funding further deteriorated police forces, marking them as unpopular, inefficient, and corrupt institutions. The military, furthermore, had tended to treat the police as their subalterns. Tensions reached a boiling point in the “Limazo” of February 5, 1975, during Velasco’s government, as a police strike in Lima was followed by widespread unrest and looting, to which the regime responded by unleashing military troops against the police and civilians. Moreover, the armed forces did not constitute a cohesive front either. The military regime of 1968–1980 had been marred by divides between “radicals” and “conservatives,” often intertwined with traditional rivalries between the army, the navy, and the air force on the one hand, and with ethnic and class differences on the other hand. Parallels between the early 1980s, with the guerrillas, and the 1960s, with counterinsurgent military interventions and Belaunde’s\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 26\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\nThe Last Peasant War in the Andes\n\n27\n\ndemise, did indeed seem ominous. As Guzmán hoped, this made what was already a delicate situation even more politically dangerous. The Belaunde government initially framed the Shining Path as common criminals and, as a consequence, opted for a police-based response, even after the fi rst State of Exception was declared in October 1981. The police intervention carried its own problems. Relations between police and local populations throughout Peru were already invariably strained and occasionally violent well before the onset of the confl ict. Local police officers were often in shameful material conditions and, particularly in rural settings, physically isolated. They were used to dealing with petty crime, not well-organized attacks by revolutionary groups. These conditions, along with broader issues affecting police forces, led to a mix of ineffectiveness and brutality in the immediate police response to the Shining Path in Ayacucho. The decision to grant the armed forces exceptional power over vast regions in January 1983 put them in an impossible position: the demands of the war were disproportionate to their capacities and to their constitutional mandate. They were expected to control a conflict that had already unfolded in decisive ways. They were sent to crush a fringe rebellion, only to fi nd themselves enmeshed in a surprisingly long, irregular, and bloody war, during which they became the second-greatest perpetrators of human rights violations and suffered substantial casualties. Significantly, many of their shortcomings can also be traced to their own ideas and actions, which were based on strategies unsuited to the challenge posed by the Shining Path in Ayacucho and beyond. The underlying ideology included an obsession with traditional geopolitics that led to massive spending sprees on airplanes and other ineffectual equipment. The strategy was initially based on anti-guerrilla experiences and field manuals from the 1960s, and on the leadership of high-ranking officers trained in the infamous United States Army School of the Americas. It initially framed the confl ict in the traditional military terms of regular counterinsurgency and territorial domination. The situation for Andean peasants deteriorated when the strategies and attitudes of state coercive forces encountered the everyday reality of the Shining Path’s war in Ayacucho. The quest for territorial control and for clearly identifiable sides clashed with the Maoists’ hit-andrun tactics, infiltration of the local population, and strategic exploitation of state violence to bolster their long-term claim for hegemony. Later during the confl ict, the Peruvian armed forces adopted a policy of military alliances with peasant communities, shifting to more inte-\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 27\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\n28 José Luis Rénique and Adrián Lerner\n\ngral forms of “political warfare” and to “low intensity” warfare and targeted attacks. The police, in the meantime, made significant progress in the realm of intelligence. These changes would eventually prove extremely successful in securing the defeat of the Shining Path, but also led to systematic human rights violations.\n\nSpark into Fire: The Onset of War in 1980s Ayacucho May 17, 1980, became the key date in the Shining Path’s revolutionary calendar. It was the so-called ILA, during which the party switched from “labor with unarmed hands” to a display of the “armed word.” The ILA implied a “red zone” in the north of Ayacucho, on an axis that linked Huanta and Huamanga (Guzmán’s original strongholds), based on the gradual penetration of villages and peasant communities. It also meant that the senderista leadership would rely on a network of cadres capable of articulating regional plans to be replicated throughout the country. Ultimately, the ILA would position the organization as the revolutionary vanguard, above a “revisionist” Left that increasingly embraced “bourgeois democracy.” The regional context of Ayacucho made the rise of Sendero possible. Ayacucho offered a microcosm of the contradictions of Andean modernization that had emerged in the two decades preceding the senderista uprising, in line with a post-oligarchic national transition that offered no clear break from the past. By the late 1970s, the contradictory effects of the velasquista agrarian reform had been added to stagnation, marginality, regional dismemberment, and other traditional negative effects of capitalist penetration in the region’s countryside. The anti-oligarchic reform had hit large landowners the hardest; it was the fi nal blow to the traditional hacendado departmental elite. But it allowed the survival of small landowners at the district level: gamonal power, in many ways the “heart of darkness” of the old agrarian regime in the Andes, remained in place. The reopening of the Universidad Nacional San Cristobal de Huamanga (UNSCH) in 1957 completed the unique regional picture. It became a sociopolitical laboratory in which radical professors like Guzmán established a direct connection with the offspring of peasant communities. The exceptional opportunity was, as senderistas would put it, “a gift from the reactionary establishment.” The UNSCH represented the longpursued promise of regional development based on scientific knowl-\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 28\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\nThe Last Peasant War in the Andes 29\n\nedge, but also aided the radical transformation proposed by the Maoist texts discussed in student circles and “popular schools.” Students went looking for the tools of modernization and returned as agents of revolutionary change. Their exuberance resulted in posters that showed Guzmán as a blend of Amauta (the traditional image of the Andean teacher, often associated with Mariátegui) and “Great Helmsman,” followed by a mass that recalled both the Chinese Red Guard and the immemorial image of Andean jacqueries or peasant revolts. Not by chance, Huamanga was described as an “Andean Yenan” (Degregori 2011, 23–51; Rénique 2013). Similar patterns of local politicization had been established in Ayacucho since the early twentieth century, but they had always been connected to national currents originating from the political center in Lima: aprismo, trotskismo, belaundismo, and velasquismo (Heilman 2010; La Serna 2012). The endogenous peripheral origin of the movement was unusual. Never in Peruvian political history had a party with defi ned revolutionary objectives emerged in the country’s periphery to challenge central power. This peripheral status allowed Sendero to shape an era of “enigma, exoticism, surprise.” The rise of the insurgency was as shocking as the crumbling of the state (Stern 1998a). But, as Steve Stern has recently asked, again: How could a small group of revolutionaries from one of Peru’s most backward regions, so out of step with the rest of the Left’s acceptance of electoral transition from military rule to democracy, redirect the course of national political life? (Stern 2013). The backwardness, isolation, and marginality that were associated with the senderistas became factors that helped the Shining Path become such a formidable challenge, a threat that was properly understood only when it was too late to be easily contained. From its Maoist ayacuchano perspective, the movement exploited the fissures of Peruvian society with surprising effectiveness. Claiming to represent the semi-feudal character of the country, they advocated the historical significance of a peasant-based war for Peru, knowing that their strategy would sink the country into a bloodbath. Carlos Iván Degregori witnessed fi rsthand, as a political rival, the transition of the Shining Path from university party to war machine. He later wrote that the process evoked a “dwarf star,” in which “matter gets so compressed that it acquires a great specific weight, disproportionate to its size.” An accumulation of willpower, discipline, and ideological cohesion evolved from a position of exceptional marginality, just when the “revisionist” Left was reaching its zenith, leading to the extreme\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 29\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\n30\n\nJosé Luis Rénique and Adrián Lerner\n\nunderestimation of the political acumen of senderismo (Degregori 1990a). Ayacucho offered the conditions to take this process of encapsulation to unexpected heights. There, Andean Maoism would achieve its purest form. Wearied by the vast waves of urban mobilization they had been forced to confront since 1976, which included two massive national strikes and several regional ones, the armed forces consistently disregarded intelligence reports about radical activities in Ayacucho. Even the army’s official history of the war cites early reports about Maoist organizations, and the violent struggles over free education in Huanta in 1969 had already revealed the leadership (and momentary imprisonment) of one Abimael Guzmán (Comisión Permanente de Historia del Ejército del Perú [hereafter CPHEP] 2010, 17; Degregori 2011). Furthermore, before handing over power to Belaunde, the military reportedly got rid of archives containing critical information on subversive activities in the rural districts of the south-central highlands (Gorriti 1990, 83). Blatant myopia about the enemy was an inevitable result. In April 1984 the minister of war still believed that Maoists in Ayacucho were getting support from Colombia’s M19 or Chile’s MIR guerrillas (Pease 1989, 582). In a memoir published in 1989, General Clemente Noel of the Peruvian army, who ruled Ayacucho with an iron fist as its fi rst political-military commander in 1983, still traced the roots of the conflict to the guerrillas of the 1960s, and described the strategy of the Shining Path in terms of their territorial gains (Noel Moral 1989, 25, 41). As stated in the introduction to this volume, scholarly disorientation added to the confusion of the early 1980s. Stuck in Cold War grand revolutionary equations, scholars of Peru had a hard time figuring out the singularities of provincial insurgents (McClintock 1998, 3; see also Poole and Rénique 1991; Starn 1995a; Starn 1991; Degregori 2012b, 37–70). During the fi rst years of the confl ict, the insurgents profited from their own effective strategy and organization as well as the fragility of the state in Ayacucho and poor decisions by the central government. While the attack on Chuschi’s voting center became the symbolic start of the armed struggle, the Shining Path had hit before, striking a mining camp in Cerro de Pasco in Peru’s central highlands and a police station in the lower-class suburb of San Martin de Porres in Lima. Still, the most important initial efforts were carried out by its Main Regional Committee (Comité Regional Principal) in Ayacucho, Apurímac, and Huancavelica, all poor, heavily indigenous rural regions of\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 30\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\nThe Last Peasant War in the Andes 31\n\nthe south-central highlands. This was Sendero’s stronghold. Trained groups known as “armed groups without arms” attacked police stations and mining centers in isolated towns. These raids were conducted to execute authorities and steal weapons, ammunition, and dynamite for future targets. They also reinforced the central role of ideology in the Shining Path’s strategy: they did not need weapons to launch the revolution. Conviction sufficed. By 1982, they had made important military progress, begun attacking larger towns, and transitioned toward more vicious, symbolically charged acts of violence against police officers and other local leaders (CVR 2003a, 2:32–33). Some of the most consequential landmarks of this process were the attack on the police station in Tambo (La Mar, Ayacucho), on October 11, 1981; the escape of Shining Path militants from Huamanga’s prison on March 2, 1982; the attack against a police outpost in Vilcashuamán near the end of that month; the death of Edith Lagos, one of the militants who had fled prison, on September 2, 1982, and the funeral that followed it; and the decision by President Belaunde to grant complete control of the “Emergency Zones” to the armed forces on the last day of that year. The attack against the police in Tambo led to the fi rst declaration of the state of exception in Ayacucho. It also brought the fi rst large contingent of antisubversive police forces, a paratrooper unit known as “Los Sinchis,” into the confl ict. Their recruits came mainly from Lima and other coastal cities, and they already were notorious in Ayacucho for their repression of the movement for free education in Huanta in 1969. Their return in late 1981 was a turning point in the confl ict. Early on, the Sinchis managed to push back against Sendero’s momentum after months of initial “easy” victories against ill-prepared police officers who often were repudiated by local residents due to patterns of abusive behavior. But the Sinchis also became a symbol of state brutality. Stationed for long periods under bad conditions in regions they did not know, and fighting an enemy that was indistinguishable from the local populations they were supposed to protect, the Sinchis were the beginning of a state-led “dirty war” that led to numerous episodes of deeply racist and gendered violence against local peasants, playing directly into the Shining Path’s long-term strategy of generating a wave of “reactionary violence” that would eventually feed their peasant army (CVR 2003a, 2:109). Sendero’s attack on the Huamanga prison in March 1982 created an aura of invincibility. A Shining Path detachment launched a coordinated attack that saw armed men free prisoners, while strategically\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 31\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\n32 José Luis Rénique and Adrián Lerner\n\nlocated sharpshooters made sure they all could leave the city. Sendero appeared to control the whole city. More than three hundred prisoners, including seventy senderistas, escaped. Days later, police officers kidnapped wounded members of the Shining Path from the city’s hospital and murdered them, in an episode that fed widespread perceptions of police ruthlessness. Less than a month later, a minor attack against the police station in Vilcashuamán resulted in an injury to a guard. President Belaunde traveled to the site to show support for the police. This marked a defi nitive step in the insurgency’s transformation into a national issue. One of the senderistas who had escaped Huamanga’s prison in March was nineteen-year-old Edith Lagos. In September, Lagos died in an armed confrontation in Apurímac. Her funeral in Huamanga was attended by a crowd calculated by some observers to have reached tens of thousands. Even the archbishop of Huamanga, a staunch antiCommunist, performed a special mass for Lagos (Guerrero 2006; Caro Cárdenas 2006). These events, along with an ever-increasing number of attacks, seemed to turn the tides of the war, and of part of the public sphere, in favor of the unknown band of Maoists from Ayacucho. A military witness described the period as “the golden years of senderismo” (Hidalgo Morey 2004, 112). Initial victories attracted militants who had distanced themselves from the electoral path taken by their “legal Left” organizations, which they saw as a betrayal of the principles of the new Left, originally born as a response to the “pacifism” of the “old left” (Pumaruna 1967; Béjar 1990; Flores Galindo 2007; Lust 2013).1 The government’s reluctance to send the armed forces to fight the insurgents unnerved the military and large segments of the population: by mid-1982, a poll revealed that 60 percent of Peruvians wanted the armed forces to take over in Ayacucho (CPHEP 2010, 42). At the same time, the electoral Left, a political force at the time, viewed military intervention with apprehension. The minister of war, General Luis Cisneros Vizquerra, warned that if the armed forces were sent to the Emergency Zones, they would inevitably kill lots of innocent peasants. Cisneros also repeatedly confronted the legal Left, accusing them of carrying out subversive acts themselves. In the meantime, legislation passed as early as 1981 helped frame the conflict in terms of “terrorism,” eventually allowing the armed forces great leeway in combating their enemies and helping to create a long-lasting narrative about the war (CVR 2003a, 2:45, 175).\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 32\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\nThe Last Peasant War in the Andes\n\n33\n\nAmid this ambivalent political climate and constant escalation of violence, the Shining Path proclaimed the formation of its “People’s Guerrilla Army” (Ejército Guerrillero Popular) on December 3, 1982, to celebrate Guzmán’s birthday. Weeks later, Belaunde gave in. In what was characterized as a true “abdication of democratic authority,” he opted for a purely military solution, giving the armed forces authority to control the Zones of Emergency, which expanded in the following years along with subversive activity to encompass vast territories (Barton 1984). Close to two thousand personnel from the army and navy were sent to Ayacucho. Military witnesses described a tremendously hostile atmosphere as the troops reached Huamanga and other cities, and, later in 1983, massive electoral absenteeism in local elections showed the degree to which Sendero swayed regional politics (CPHEP 2010, 48, 54–55). The armed forces immediately banned journalists and human rights activists from the Emergency Zones. Only days after their arrival in early January 1983, it was reported that peasants in Huaychao, a rural village in Huanta, had killed a column of senderistas. The military and the president publicly praised them and encouraged others to follow their example; others suspected it was a cover for state repression. When a group of journalists from Lima traveled to the region, despite the prohibition, to investigate, tragedy struck: Sinchis had told peasant communities to attack any newcomers, and the peasants of Uchuraccay did just that, murdering the journalists and their guide with stones and sticks. For many, the Uchuraccay massacre became the ultimate symbol of the conflict. It put Ayacucho at the center of media attention and further polarized all sides. It also led to myriad interpretations, all of which brought Andean peasants under scrutiny. Perhaps the most prominent interpretation, issued by the state-sponsored investigative commission led by the famed writer Mario Vargas Llosa, contained long-standing prejudices about “primitive” Andean peasants and reduced the problem to a clash of civilizations living in isolation from one another: a modern, coastal, urban Peru, and a “deep,” primitive, rural, Andean hinterland. As a scholarly critic later argued, these ideas, along with the violence itself, revealed that Peru was “in deep trouble” (M. Vargas Llosa 1983; Mayer 1991). Only very recently have scholars shed light on the “Uchuraccay tragedy” in all its historical and local depth, showing that it was marked by the memory of long struggles over community, land, and citizenship (del Pino 2017). The scars were the product of contact, not of isolation.\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 33\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\n34\n\nJosé Luis Rénique and Adrián Lerner\n\nWhen the armed forces entered the Shining Path’s “red zone,” the conflict acquired its full, bloody, face. The Andes had not seen such a degree of violence since the Chilean invasion in the central highlands in 1881–1884, or perhaps the Túpac Amaru rebellion of the 1780s. With no clear strategy, severely limited intelligence, and hindered by the influence of colonialist counterinsurgent formulas ranging from the French guerre révolutionnaire to the American counterinsurgency of the Vietnam era and Argentina’s “fight against subversion,” the military behaved as an occupation force (Cobas 1982; Masterson 1991; Rodríguez Beruff 1983; Villanueva 1973; Degregori and Rivera Paz 1993). The militarization of the state was an old idea among the Peruvian military, and it fueled both Belaunde’s and the Left’s misgivings and Guzmán’s boldness (Toche Medrano 2008, 3). From that perspective, the velasquista and the Southern Cone regimes had been two different modes of counterinsurgent politics: the fi rst was aimed at the cooptation of the popular sectors, while the second sought the elimination of the insurgency, expecting to obtain a quick victory regardless of social and political costs (Gorriti 2003, 97). According to a military source, “the nature of the enemy as well as the circumstances” often made “indiscriminate repression” the norm (Hidalgo Morey 2004, 211). Very few listened when the military claimed that, to achieve a lasting victory, the state would have to fulfill its role and take care of the structural socioeconomic and political problems of the country (Noel Moral 1989, 38). It took only two months for General Noel to be sued by a public attorney for the alleged murder of three Ayacucho peasants, and weeks later Belaunde told the press that he would throw human rights reports “directly into the trashcan” (CVR 2003a, 2:182–183). Army barracks like “Los Cabitos” in Huamanga became killing and torture grounds, and conflicts increased between the armed forces and the police, which had effectively become a subaltern force, trained in counterinsurgent tactics on the field by the military, frequently in brutal ways (CVR 2003a, 2:114–115). As a historian of the period put it, peasants by then often feared Sendero, but the police and armed forces were often hated (Taylor 1998, 94; CPHEP 2010, 50). Noel’s successor in 1984, General Adrián Huamán, had experience fighting the guerrillas of 1965. But he was also a native of Ayacucho, fluent in Quechua, and advocated a more “social” and developmental approach to the war that was based on efforts to gain the support of the local peasant communities. He was known for paternalistic gestures, from the traditional distribu-\n\nSoifer_6844-final.indb 34\n\n8/17/18 11:53 AM\n\nThe Last Peasant War in the Andes 35\n\ntion of bread to the organization of the harvests and control over social spending in the region. He also supported the notion of peasant self-defense organizations (comités de autodefensa, or CAD) to combat the insurgents, although he refused to arm or train them. Nevertheless, his approach clashed with civilian fears of a new military takeover of government functions and political life, and he did not last long. Crucially, moreover, human rights violations by the armed forces spiked under his leadership, and the fi rst mass graves were found in Ayacucho (CVR 2003a, 2:183). The military onslaught did see the armed forces inflict significant casualties on the rebels. The military increased its number of patrols and took back police stations and villages after a long period of absence. But they were fighting the wrong war, misreading their enemies’ strategies. The insurgents did not budge. They too chased victory regardless of human costs. The territorial approach to the war taken by the armed forces meant that they were susceptible to the Shining Path’s hit-and-run attacks, and whenever they took back a village, often brutally, they would then leave it at the mercy of senderista retaliation. It was the era of massacres and mass graves. Among many examples, the emblematic case of the Santiago d"
