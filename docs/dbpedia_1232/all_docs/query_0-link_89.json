He claims that he has come to take away something precious from Sora. Meanwhile, Sora and Sunao meet Chris, who works at the nearby church. While he seems harmless, he begins to spend more time with Sora. To top it all off, Sora begins to realize that there are times when he and Sunao are mysteriously in bed together. He already knows about Sunao's connection with his alternate personality Ran, but could that mean he has his own alternate personality as well?\n\n[taken from Wikipedia]\n\nDescription\n\nSora is a student at an all-boys' high school, and a member of the school \"Nandemoya\" (Jack-of-All-Trades) team.

He has no memories of his childhood, including his new roommate, Sunao, who he is told is his childhood friend. He decides he is going to find out why he mysteriously fell and has lost memories.\n\n[Edited from Boys' Love Game Headquarters]\n\nDescription\n\nA boy training to be a pastor at a church near Shin'ichirou's office.
