        "text": "Political group in Peru\n\nFor the Chilean newspaper, see Cambio 21.\n\nChange 21 (Spanish: Cambio 21) was a parliamentary group for the congressional term of 2016 to 2021 in the Congress of Peru. The group was introduced on 20 March 2018, led by then-congressman Kenji Fujimori, and was formally recognized on 19 December of the same year by the President of Congress Daniel Salaverry. Its members are former members of Popular Force.[1] The parliamentary group was disbanded following the dissolution of the Congress on 30 September 2019 by President Martin Vizcarra.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 21 December 2017, proposals to impeach President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski reached the floor of Congress.[2] Ultimately, the proposal to impeach the president failed as 10 members of the majority opposition party Popular Force voted against removing Kuczynski from the presidency.[3] On 31 December 2017, the party's Disciplinary Committee recommended dismissing the ten members from Popular Force.[4] On 1 March 2018, following dismissal from the party, Kenji Fujimori resigned from the leadership of the Fujimorist faction, changing moving towards a more progressive and liberal agenda.[5] Later in January, Fujimori informally nicknamed his group as the Avengers, a reference to the fictional film Avengers: Infinity War.[6][7] On 20 March, the informal group announced the creation of the political faction Cambio 21 with plans to become an official political party with the incarcerated former president Alberto Fujimori as leader.[8][9]\n\nOn 19 December, the President of Congress Daniel Salaverry formally recognized the faction.[10]\n\nCongressional members\n\n[edit]\n\nCurrent congressional members of Change 21 are former members of Popular Force: Estelita Bustos, Maritza García, Clayton Galván, Marvin Palma, Luis Yika, Yesenia Ponce, Roberto Vieira and Lizbeth Robles.[11]\n\nGuillermo Bocángel, Bienvenido Ramírez and Kenji Fujimori were suspended from Congress before the formal recognition of Change 21 as a congressional faction."
