        "text": "Japanese actor\n\nKōji Hashimoto (橋本 広司, Hashimoto Kōji, born 1 January 1956), known professionally as Kōji Yakusho (役所 広司, Yakusho Kōji), is a Japanese actor. He is known internationally for his starring roles in Shall We Dance? (1996), 13 Assassins (2010), The Third Murder (2017), The Blood of Wolves (2018), Under the Open Sky (2020) and The Days (2023). For his performance in Perfect Days (2023), he was awarded the Best Actor award in the 76th Cannes Film Festival.\n\nEarly life and education\n\n[edit]\n\nYakusho was born in Isahaya, Nagasaki, the youngest of five brothers. After graduation from Nagasaki Prefectural High School of Technology in 1974, he worked at the Chiyoda municipal ward office, or kuyakusho, in Tokyo, from which he later took his stage name.[1]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1976, he saw a production of Maxim Gorky's The Lower Depths (Played by Tatsuya Nakadai) and was inspired, first to watch, and then later to take part in, as many plays as possible.[1] In the spring of 1978 he auditioned for Tatsuya Nakadai's the Mumeijuku (Studio for Unknown Performers) acting studio, and was one of four chosen out of 800 applicants.[1]\n\nIn 1983, he landed the role of Oda Nobunaga in the year-long NHK drama Tokugawa Ieyasu and was catapulted to fame. He also appeared in a TV version of Miyamoto Musashi from 1984 to 1985. For several years, he played Kuji Shinnosuke (or \"Sengoku\"), one of the title characters in the jidaigeki Sambiki ga Kiru!. He played a major character in Juzo Itami's 1986 Tampopo.[1]\n\nIn 1988, he was given a special award for work in cinema by the Japanese Minister of Education, Science, Sports and Culture and continued to appear in films and in a number of TV shows through the '90s.[1]\n\nIn 1996 and 1997, Yakusho enjoyed several major successes. The Eel, directed by Shohei Imamura, in which he played the eel-loving lead, won the Palme d'Or at the 1997 Cannes Film Festival.[2] Lawrence Van Gelder in the New York Times called his performance \"unerring.\"[3] A Lost Paradise, about a double-suicide, was second only to Princess Mononoke at the Japanese box office.[4]\n\nInternational breakthrough: Shall We Dance?\n\n[edit]\n\nShall We Dance? was such a major hit in Japan that it inspired a domestic dance craze. Ballroom groups and dance schools multiplied in the country after the film's release, and people who previously would never admit to taking lessons announced that they did with pride.[5] Director Masayuki Suo said of his lead, who until that point was known mostly for playing good-looking samurai, \"we thought he could play this overworked, tired Japanese businessman, and he did.... [H]e pulled everything off and took his dance training so seriously.\"[5]\n\nThe film also was one of Japan's highest-grossing movies outside the country.[1][5] It earned $9.5 million in the US and inspired a remake starring Jennifer Lopez and Richard Gere, with Gere playing Yakusho's role.[6]\n\nYakusho next won the Hochi Film Award for Best Actor for Bounce Ko Gals, a film which dealt with high school prostitution specifically, and money worship in general. He collaborated with horror director Kiyoshi Kurosawa in Cure,[1] License to Live,[7] Seance, Charisma,[1] Pulse,[8] Doppelganger,[9] Retribution,[10] and Tokyo Sonata.[11] Yakusho found further recognition with international audiences to some extent with roles in such films as Memoirs of a Geisha and Babel. In the latter, directed by Alejandro González Iñárritu, he played the father of the deaf-mute played by Rinko Kikuchi.[12]\n\nContinued success\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2009, he debuted as director of Toad's Oil.[13] In 2010 and 2011 he was part of both ensemble casts in Takashi Miike's samurai films, 13 Assassins and Hara-Kiri: Death of a Samurai. The latter was in 3D and the first 3D film to be in competition at the Cannes Film Festival.[14]\n\nIn the 2011 war drama film Rengō Kantai Shirei Chōkan: Yamamoto Isoroku, Yakusho portrayed Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto. Yakusho was reportedly the only actor considered for the role; had he not accepted it, the film would have been canceled.[15]\n\nIn 2018 he was in The Blood of Wolves. For his performance in Perfect Days, directed by Wim Wenders, Yakusho won best actor at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival.[16] In the same year, he has been selected 2023 Taipei Golden Horse Film Festival’s filmmaker in focus.[17]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Director Notes 1979 Hunter in the Dark Kuwano Hideo Gosha [18] Eireitachi no oenka: saigo no sôkeisen Kihachi Okamoto [19] 1980 Twelve Months Young soldier (voice) Kimio Yabuki [20] 1981 Willful Murder Journalist Kei Kumai [21] 1982 Onimasa Kondō Hideo Gosha [22] Himeyuri no Tô Otaka Tadashi Imai [23] The Legend of Sayo Hatsutaro Tetsutaro Murano [24] 1985 Tampopo Man in White Suit Juzo Itami [25] 1987 The Great Department Store Robbery Cello player Azuma Morisaki [26] 1988 Another Way: D-Kikan Joho Naoto Sekiya Kōsaku Yamashita Lead role [27] 1990 Pod severnym siyaniyem Genzo Tamiya Toshio Gotō Lead role [28] 1993 Gurenbana Kenzo Nakada Mamoru Watanabe [29] Drug Connection Ryosuke Kano Shōkaku Baba Lead role [30] 1994 Osaka Gokudo Senso: Shinoidare Ippei Yoshikawa Tatsuoki Hosono [31] 1995 Kamikaze Taxi Kantake Masato Harada Lead role [32] 1996 Shall We Dance?
