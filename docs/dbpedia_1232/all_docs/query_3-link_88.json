GX Tag Force 3 is the third game in the Yu-Gi-Oh! Tag Force series. It is set in Duel Academy during the fourth season of the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX anime, and is the last installment of the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force series.\n\nFeatures[edit]\n\nThe game includes a total of 3501 cards, including cards from every set up to Crossroads of Chaos. Also included are cards from the first two Duel Terminal sets, as well as any Starter and Structure Decks that were released prior to July 2008.\n\nIncludes new Synchro Monsters from Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's.\n\nUses the Yu-Gi-Oh! Official Card Game Master Rules, and it uses an altered form of the March 2008 Banlist by default.\n\nRetains the Destiny Draw system from Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 2.\n\nIn addition to retaining the Free Mini Games from Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 2, a new Mini Game (\"Ball or Bread\") was added.\n\nUMD Recognition with the Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force 2 and Yu-Gi-Oh! GX Tag Force UMD will unlock new cards, special Booster Packs, a new storyline, and the ability to partner with Bastion Misawa from the very beginning of the game.\n\nUnlike previous games in the Tag Force series, this game's Story Mode only has four Heart Events, not eight. However, every Tier 1 character now has at least 2 different storylines to compensate.\n\nSome Monsters have also received Summon and Attack animations including \"Blue-Eyes White Dragon\", \"Elemental Hero Bladedge\" and \"Light and Darkness Dragon\".\n\nA Photo Gallery feature has been added, allowing the player to view all pictures of the characters' Story Endings, pictures from the previous Yu-Gi-Oh! Tag Force installments and watch any videos of Monsters' Summon and Attack animations they have seen during gameplay.\n\nStarting Deck[edit]\n\nAnime original cards[edit]\n\nAs with all the other Tag Force games, some anime-original cards are present in the game. Anime originals from the previous two games are also present, but not listed here.\n\nBolded cards have been printed in the OCG since this videogame was released.\n\nDownloadable content[edit]\n\nDownloadable cards[edit]\n\nThe following cards were available for download since their respective listed dates. \"Toon Kingdom\" and \"Miracle Contact\" were only available through download.\n\nToon Kingdom - November 27, 2008\n\nGladiator Beast Octavius - December 4, 2008\n\nGladiator Beast Torax - December 11, 2008\n\nGemini Summoner - December 18, 2008\n\nTest Tiger - December 25, 2008\n\nDefensive Tactics - January 8, 2009\n\nOcean's Keeper - January 15, 2009\n\nDragon Ice - January 22, 2009\n\nTongue Twister - January 29, 2009\n\nThousand-Eyes Jellyfish - February 5, 2009\n\nSkreech - February 12, 2009\n\nRoyal Firestorm Guards - February 19, 2009\n\nMiracle Contact - February 26, 2009\n\nVeil of Darkness - March 5, 2009\n\nSecurity Orb - March 12, 2009\n\nAbyssal Kingshark - March 19, 2009\n\nDark Grepher - March 26, 2009\n\nDarklord Zerato - April 2, 2009\n\nMormolith - April 9, 2009\n\nDarknight Parshath - April 16, 2009\n\nDeepsea Macrotrema - April 23, 2009\n\nFossil Tusker - April 30, 2009\n\nMetabo Globster - May 7, 2009\n\nGolden Flying Fish - May 14, 2009\n\nPhantom Dragonray Bronto - May 21, 2009\n\nPrime Material Dragon - May 28, 2009\n\nLonefire Blossom - June 4, 2009\n\nIl Blud - June 11, 2009\n\nAztekipede, the Worm Warrior - June 18, 2009\n\nAllure of Darkness - June 25, 2009\n\nBlazewing Butterfly - July 2, 2009\n\nElemental Hero Air Neos - July 9, 2009\n\nCranium Fish - July 16, 2009\n\nDownloadable recipes[edit]\n\nThere were two downloadable Deck Recipes for this game, which are no longer available to obtain.\n\nThe first recipe was available since February 5, 2009, and it is based on Georg's Decks.\n\nThe second recipe was made available in April 30th, 2009.\n\nCard converter[edit]\n\nCharacters[edit]\n\nWhen beginning a new save file, the player can only team up with Tier 1 characters. However, Bastion cannot be partnered without doing UMD Recognition with Tag Force or defeating him in duels at least 10 times.\n\nUnlike the previous game, partnering with any alternative version of the various characters has them using different Decks with different cards designated as favorites.\n\nCharacters\n\nSpecial animations[edit]\n\nSome characters have a special Summoning animation for their signature cards. The following cards cause the game to play a 3D animation when Summoned or when Attacking. All animations from the previous games return.\n\nCharacter storylines[edit]\n\nJaden's (Fused with Yubel or Neo Jaden) Story\n\nFirst Heart: Jaden has a flashback of him being the Supreme King, with you facing him in a Single Duel\n\nSecond Heart: Jaden has another flashback in which you duel with Jaden against Adrian Gecko and Yubel.\n\nThird Heart: As Jaden attempts to leave the Academy, Sheppard tells him and you to meet someone at the Volcano. Once there you discover Sartorius, but the meeting is interrupted by Trueman.\n\nFourth Heart: After a conversation with Jesse at the Harbor, you go to the main gate with him and Jaden as Atticus is defeated by Fujiwara in a duel. You and Jaden have to team up and take on both Fujiwara and a Nightshroud-possessed Atticus.\n\nJaden's (Normal) Story\n\nFirst Heart: Syrus plans to have a special class with the Slifer Red students and Bastion Misawa from Ra Yellow being their teacher. Syrus thinks he's going to repeat a year so he duels you and Jaden along with KENYoU, with Jaden's and the player's graduations on the line.\n\nSecond Heart: The professors do not want the third year students to graduate, so you and Jaden duel Wade and Dean with your graduation on the line.\n\nThird Heart: Jaden has a flashback of meeting Damon when Damon stole the eggwiches during the first year. Damon challenges you to a single duel to test his drawing ability.\n\nFourth Heart: The professors are still against the graduation, especially Dr. Crowler. You and Jaden must duel Blair and Hassleberry with all of the students' graduation on the line.\n\nSyrus' Story (Obelisk Blue) Syrus in this adventure focuses more upon dueling other students than his friends, reminding everyone about the need to respect the opponent, as Zane taught him.\n\nFirst Heart: Syrus interrupts a duel between two Slifer Red students (Nathan and Taku) and two Obelisk Blue students. You and Syrus duel against the Slifers.\n\nSecond Heart: Syrus interrupts a meeting between Jasmine and Mindy and two Obelisk Blue students - Seydina and Pablo. You and Syrus then duel the Obelisk Blue students.\n\nThird Heart: Syrus remembers the duel with the Psycho Style duelist Makoto Inotsume. Then you meet two Obelisk Blue students at the Cliff, Dante and Brown, who also use Psycho Style Decks and duel them.\n\nFourth Heart: At the Duel Field you and Syrus tag duel against Jaden and Dark Zane in the graduation duel.\n\nSyrus' Story (Ra Yellow and Slifer Red) This Syrus, in contrast to the one above, is one that never grew as a duelist or as a person; he lacks confidence, and has no respect either for himself or for others as duelists, childishly demanding the other party buying sandwiches for him and hiding behind the player character like a shield.\n\nFirst Heart: You and Syrus tag-duel against Chazz and Jesse.\n\nSecond Heart: You and Syrus tag-duel against Seydina and Pablo.\n\nThird Heart: You and Syrus tag-duel against Hassleberry and Chumley.\n\nFourth Heart: At the Duel Field you and Syrus tag duel against Jaden and Tyranno in the graduation duel.\n\nChazz' Story\n\nFirst Heart: In the Slifer Red dorm's dining room someone has stolen Chazz' fried shrimp. Chazz will challenge Syrus and Jaden to a duel with your assistance.\n\nSecond Heart: Apparently someone has stolen Alexis' dress, prompting you and Chazz to challenge The Gambler and Sartorius to a tag-duel.\n\nThird Heart: In Chancellor Sheppard's office during a conversation about the missing supply ship, Chazz challenges Aster and Jesse to a tag-duel with you as his partner.\n\nFourth Heart: Chazz believes he has discovered the thief's identity - Damon! However Damon's dueling partner Don Zaloog admits to being the real thief, prompting a tag duel with you and Chazz against Don Zaloog and Damon.\n\nChazz' Story (Obelisk Blue) This Chazz is who he was at the beginning of the first season — even more arrogant and elitist than usual. His goal throughout this adventure is to take over the school's administration and force out all underperforming students to make it an elite academy. It concludes with him successful, standing at the side of his two older brothers, while the rest of the campus despairs.\n\nFirst Heart: You and Chazz tag-duel against Syrus and Chumley.\n\nSecond Heart: You and Chazz tag-duel against Bastion and Tyranno.\n\nThird Heart: You and Chazz tag-duel against Alexis and Dr. Crowler.\n\nFourth Heart: You and Chazz tag-duel against Dark Zane and Aster.\n\nZane's (Underworld) Story\n\nFirst Heart: You and Zane tag-duel against Jaden and Syrus at the Academy.\n\nSecond Heart: You and Zane tag-duel against Anca and Simon at the Beach.\n\nThird Heart: You and Zane duel against Nightshroud and Alexis at the Volcano.\n\nFourth Heart: To graduate, you and Zane face off against Aster and his sidekick, Chazz.\n\nZane's (Obelisk Blue) Story\n\nFirst Heart: Zane has a flashback about his best friend, Atticus, starting the Duel Academy's most handsome guy contest. Zane wants to cancel the contest so he duels Atticus and Mindy along with you in a tag duel.\n\nSecond Heart: Zane has a flashback again about Atticus causing him trouble when he wants Zane to accept the fact that Blair has feelings for him, so Atticus and Blair duels you and Zane in a tag duel.\n\nThird Heart: As usual, Zane has a flashback about Atticus starting up a contest: \"The search for Zane Truesdale's date\". Zane is against it, so you and him duel Atticus and Jasmine in a tag duel.\n\nFourth Heart: You and Zane are tag dueling Atticus and Sarina for the graduation duel.\n\nBlair's Story\n\nFirst Heart: At the Obelisk Blue boys dorm Blair is after a \"Fortune favor\" from Sartorius, but first she must defeat Sartorius and Jesse in a tag-duel with your assistance.\n\nSecond Heart: Blair and you duel at the Harbor against Chazz and Alexis\n\nThird Heart: Blair duels with you against Tyranno and Bastion in order to claim their fish dinner as a present for a hungry Jaden.\n\nFourth Heart: Atticus and Jaden duel against you and Blair at the Harbour's lighthouse after Blair invites Jaden there to tell him something, but is interrupted by Atticus.\n\nBlair's Story (Obelisk Blue)\n\nFirst Heart: At the Obelisk Blue Boys Dorm Blair is after a yearbook photo from Alexis and Tyranno, but first she agrees to duel them in a Tag Duel with your assistance, because of nostalgia.\n\nSecond Heart: Blair duels with you against Chazz and Bastion in order to take a picture of the \"future Pro Duelist\". After the duel is over, she is sad that they fought each other so much.\n\nThird Heart: Blair and you duel at the Obelisk Blue dorm against Obelisk Blue Zane and Atticus.\n\nFourth Heart: Tyranno and Jaden duel against you and Blair at the Duel Field to graduate you. After this, Blair talks to you at the Obelisk Blue Girls Dorm.\n\nBlair's Story (Undisguised)\n\nFirst Heart: Zane is back! So in search of him, the \"Maiden in love\" duels two Obelisk students - Pablo and Bivin - in order to enter the Blue dorm.\n\nSecond Heart: Blair and you duel at the Harbor against Alexis and Jaden out of jealousy.\n\nThird Heart: Defeat Crowler and Georg to prove Blair worthy of being in Duel Academy.\n\nFourth Heart: Duel of the Pros: Aster and Jesse vs. Blair and you.\n\nBlair's Story (Disguised)\n\nFirst Heart: Surprise, she's a girl. But to prevent Chazz from finding out, you have to duel him and Syrus.\n\nSecond Heart: Now it is Jaden who wants to go to the pool with Blair. As her knight, you battle him and Tyranno to help her out.\n\nThird Heart: You have to duel Professor Wade to give her time to hide her girlish things.\n\nFourth Heart: Great duel against Crowler and Wade to prevent them from lifting your hats in public.\n\nAlexis' Story\n\nFirst Heart: Mindy and Jasmine approach Alexis and ask for a tag-duel with her and you for the graduation test.\n\nSecond Heart: Chazz tells Alexis that he has defeated Aster and will going to a pro league tournament. Chazz asks you and Alexis to duel them both.\n\nThird Heart: There is a Graduation Test at the Duel Field and Atticus and Jaden are your opponents.\n\nFourth Heart: Alexis will ask you to come to the lighthouse at the Harbor and then challenge you to a duel. After the duel she will tell you something important.\n\nAlexis' Story (Angry) -- This Alexis is much more hostile in general, and never fails to mention how she thinks the player character is a slacker at every opportunity, even when complimenting him. Her Deck is based around her Society of Light version's Ice Deck, and her goal is to shape up the player character and get rid of all the \"slackers\" at the school.\n\nFirst Heart: Atticus is at the root of the \"slacker problem\" in Duel Academy, and Alexis plans to shape him up. First, you have to beat his right wing: Jasmine and Mindy.\n\nSecond Heart: Now it's time for his left wing: You duel Fonda Fontaine, whose partner is a passerby Blair.\n\nThird Heart: The root is the Slifer Red dorm! So you duel Jaden and Tyranno to make Jaden leave.\n\nFourth Heart: The final fight: You duel Atticus and Chazz, with Atticus's future on the line.\n\nBastion's Story\n\nFirst Heart: You and Bastion tag-duel against Jim and Tyranno.\n\nSecond Heart: You and Bastion tag-duel against two Jinzos from the different dimension.\n\nThird Heart: You and Bastion tag-duel against Trueman.\n\nFourth Heart: You and Bastion tag-duel against Rune and Ray in the exam duel.\n\nBastion concludes the adventure with the statement that although he is often forgotten by others, he will continue to fight for what is right, and be an \"invisible protector\" of the world.\n\nBastion's Story (Excited) This adventure is a parody of Neo-Jaden's story arc above, with Bastion proclaiming himself to be a defender of truth and justice, hounded by fans at all times (in contrast to how things usually are, where most people keep forgetting he's there). In fact, at one point he expresses a wish that some people would forget him. The closing illustration for this adventure parodies Jaden's as well, with Bastion's Decks for this storyline being Fusion-based Elemental Heroes and builds focusing entirely on the constant and easy summoning of \"Elemental Hero Neos\".\n\nFirst Heart: Bastion has a flashback to his final duel against Kagemaru at the Special Finals Arena, parodying the final event in the first game. You and Bastion Tag Duel against Kagemaru and Titan.\n\nSecond Heart: Bastion has a flashback where he faces Sartorius and Sarina, parodying Aster's last story event in the previous game.\n\nThird Heart: You and Bastion Tag Duel against Professor Viper and Axel, parodying Jesse's last event in the previous game.\n\nFourth Heart: The last storypart is the same like Jaden's: You and Bastion Tag Duel against Fujiwara and Nightshroud.\n\nSecond & Third Tier Story\n\nFirst Heart: You and your partner tag-duel against Tyranno and Crowler. If you tag with Tyranno or Crowler, you'll fight against Andrea and Lily.\n\nSecond Heart: You and your partner tag-duel against Yasmin and Atticus (Hawaiian shirt). If you tag with Atticus (in any form), you'll fight against Yasmin and Tania. If you tag with Yasmin, you'll fight against Atticus (Hawaiian shirt) and Tania.\n\nThird Heart: You and your partner against Camula and Jesse. If you tag with Jesse, you'll fight against Camula and Atticus (Hawaiian shirt). If you tag with Camula, you'll fight against Atticus (Hawaiian shirt) and Jesse.\n\nFourth Heart: You and your partner duel against Amnael and Adrian.

This could be due to the revisions that have been made with regards to the decision-making processes of the AI, coupled with the fact that the amount of memory stored on the game's UMD is a colossal amount due to the large card pool. However, this lag is enough to really disrupt the flow of the game to the point of almost irritating, like when there is a large number of cards on the field. Despite all the lags, the game can be played normally.\n\nWhile the computer controls it, \"F.G.D\" makes all other Dragon-Type monsters on its controller's field able to inflict piercing damage against non-Token monsters, and the player cannot activate Spell or Trap Cards when they attack.\n\n\"Dragon's Rage\" makes Dragon-Type monsters under the player's control able to inflict piercing damage by being Set on the field without having to be activated.\n\nSelecting Jaden's alter ego The Supreme King in Story Mode makes the game crash, as the developers never got around to complete the game data that would make him accessible.\n\nWhen Jaden attacks with \"Elemental Hero Divine Neos\", he says \"Attack Rainbow Neos\" instead of \"Attack Divine Neos\".\n\nSometimes if Yubel activates \"Heavy Storm\" while you control \"Crystal Beast Cobalt Eagle\", the latter is destroyed even though it is in the Monster Card Zone.\n\n\"Plant Food Chain's\" second effect (Special Summon a Plant-Type monster from the Graveyard if the card is destroyed by a card effect when equipped) can be activated whether or not the Trap has been activated and equipped to an appropriate monster.\n\nYubel sometimes says \"Go Yubel - Terror Incarnate\", when summoning the normal \"Yubel\".\n\nIn events involving The Supreme King, he is often accidentally referred to as \"the The Supreme King\".\n\n\"Spirit of the Six Samurai\" misspells the word \"Six Samurai\" to \"Six Samuriai\".\n\n\"No Entry!!\" misspells the word \"monsters\" to \"montsers\".\n\nTrivia[edit]\n\nThis game is the first Tag Force game to feature a new monster card type from another Yu-Gi-Oh! series.\n\nA female player character seems to have been intended during development, but was ultimately scrapped.\n\n[edit]"
