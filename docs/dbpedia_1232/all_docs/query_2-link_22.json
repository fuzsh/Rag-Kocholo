        "text": "Way of the Samurai 3 is a PS3/XBOX 360 game released in 2009 in NA and 2008 in Japan. The game was also made available in March 2016 for Microsoft Windows.\n\nStory of Way of the Samurai 3[]\n\nSet during the Sengoku Era, the story of WOTS3 takes place in Amana, a fictional land ruled by a rising feudal lord, Fujimori Shuzen, who had overthown his former superior, Lord Sakurai, and became the new ruler. The Fujimori clan is an emerging force in Amana and has many enemies within its territory. In order to protect their domain, they force farmers and villagers to overwork and impose heavy taxes on them to strengthen their armed force. Because of this, people in Amana are beginning to feel discontent toward the Fujimori clan.\n\nThere are four main factions in Amana: Fujimori clan, Ouka clan, Omiki villagers and Takatane villagers. The Ouka clan consists of vassals of the Sakurai clan and assorted outcasts who desire power and seek to overthrow the Fujimori clan. The Takatane and Omiki villagers are harmonious people only wishing for peace.\n\nCharacters of Way of the Samurai 3[]\n\nProtagonist[]\n\nThe main character is a customizable rōnin whose default name is Nameless. Players can customize their samurai by combining several heads with some bodies. Non-Player Character (NPC) models are also available for use after this option is unlocked, any NPCs (including female characters) that you have knocked unconscious will become selectable.\n\nOriginally there were only male heads. The Plus version of the game added a female head (from Way of the Samurai 2), but even when playing with a female model, NPCs will still address the protagonist as \"he\".\n\nFujimori Clan[]\n\nFujimori Shuzen: Former vassal of the Sakurai clan, now the rising Lord who overthrew the Sakurai clan.

A new feature in the game is that players can draw their weapon anytime during cutscenes.\n\nThe number of events are three times more than the previous game and there are 22 endings as opposed to 14 in the last game. After completing the game, players will retain the weapons, items, parts they obtained, money, as well as physical stats, learned skills and techniques for future replays.\n\nBased on what they did in the game, players will receive an end-game title and Samurai Points. There are 50 different titles, ranging from \"Nobody\" to \"Samurai 4EvR!\". The total Samurai Points are used to unlock secrets, heads, clothes, and abilities.\n\nThe game, however, encourages players to be honorable, because they will lose their total Samurai Points for doing villainous acts, and will not be able to unlock secrets.\n\nMovement and Time[]\n\nPlayers can now either walk from place to place like in the first Way of the Samurai, or travel instantly (or warp) between areas by using the map like in Way of the Samurai 2. If you use the map, time will wind fast forward. There are 8 areas in Amana: Kuchihagahara, Guard Gate, Posting Station, Takatane Village, Omiki Town, Castle Amana, Castle Minori, and The Road. Areas which have events will be marked with an Inkling \"!\" to allow players to follow the storyline more easily.\n\nTime is displayed by a clock on the top right corner of the screen. One minute in the game is equal to one second in real life. Time progresses as the day advances; morning, noon, evening, night, midnight, and dawn. Certain events only occur at a certain time of the day. Unlike previous games, there is no day limit in this game.\n\nThe \"safe house\" first introduced in Way of the Samurai 2 returns, but this time you can actually walk around. A bed, weapon safe, money safe, item box, and weapon parts box can be found inside the house.\n\nCombat[]\n\nThe game focuses deeply (as in past games) on sword combat. There are 102 weapons in the game, including swords, spears, and even some joke weapons like sticks, green onion, tuna, brooms, and hoes. Players can now kneel down and beg for mercy (Dogeza) if they are losing the fight, this action is called Apologizing. NPCs will also do this.\n\nThe \"parry\" technique introduced in the last game was scrapped. Now the \"push and pull\" system like in the first game is used, as well as a new \"instant kill\" (hit satsu) technique called \"glimpse of death\", which is activated after a successful awase. After an instant kill, it is possible to perform a chain kill (ren satsu) just by approaching foes and hitting the right buttons.\n\nWith Blunt Attack mode ON the samurai will uses the blunt side of the blade instead of the sharp edge, and as the result, enemies will be knocked out instead. When using blunt attack, instant kill is disabled. As well as not being able to kill your enemies using Blunt Attack, you cannot Yen or weapons from the opponent when using blunt attack.\n\nWeapons will gain EXP and level up. New skills can be learned by leveling up weapons. At max level (50), the weapon will have infinite durability and become unbreakable. The player can learn unarmed fighting (bare hands stance) and dual ninja swords techniques by reading scrolls. Learned skills are now recorded with the main character and later can be assigned to new created weapons. Once you have learned all skills for a sword stance (like middle stance), a stance mastery trophy will be unlocked.\n\nSwords and Spears[]\n\nLike in previous games, you can enhance your swords' stats and value (like durability, attack/defense bonus) by visiting the blacksmiths (the Dojima brothers). In addition to that, the game will be the first installment in the series to allow players to create their own original katana or spears by collecting parts like blades (each blade comes with a certain scabbard), guards, grips, pommels, and bringing them to the blacksmiths. Players then can set a stance and assign moves to it, and can even name their new unique weapon. According to the official blog, there are around 200 original parts and more than 750 skills to choose from (skills must be learned first).\n\nThe swords are still divided into seven types: middle stance, upper stance, lower stance, side stance, single stance (one-handed), draw stance (Battōjutsu), and ninja stance. The \"dual stance\" swords introduced in Way of the Samurai 2 were removed. Instead, you can obtain the \"dual wielding\" ability (can equip any two swords at once) after earning a certain amount of Samurai Points. Spears are now treated as its own kind (spear stance), not \"side stance swords\" anymore.\n\nA new stat for weapons is \"weight\", ranging from 0 (light) to 8 (unmovable). Heavyweight weapons will be very slow.\n\nPartners[]\n\nAnother known newly introduced feature is the \"partner\" system. There are NPCs in Amana whom you can take along with you in your adventures. There will be some minigame jobs which require two people to complete, like making sticky rice cakes or performing a sword catching trick. Your partners might agree to live with you at your home if they become fond of you, but they will be jealous if you bring home another girl and will be angry if you do not come home for many days. When living together, each partner can have positive or negative effects, like increasing money in the safe or breaking swords.\n\nThere are 14 partners (4 more are added in Plus version, including Sensei) you can get in this game (anyone who has a green name tag is recruitable), from a spear-wielding widow to the ghost of a murdered woman to Donna (the afro samurai from the 1st game) to a cat girl called \"Nya-Nya\" (meow meow). Each of them has different abilities, from assisting in combat to holding weapons/items/parts. The max relationship point of each partner is 7.14%. To have 100%, player must raise relationship with all available partners.\n\nJobs And Mini Games[]\n\nPlayers can do jobs for any of the four factions. Working for one side will increase the main character's popularity with that side, and terrorizing them will make them hate him instead. Some of these jobs include babysitting a dog, finding runaway kids, punishing food thieves, rescuing kidnapped babies, or just killing someone.\n\nIn addition to various normal \"jobs\" provided by 4 different brokers, there are some mini games like \"help the old lady toll the bell\", \"cut vegetables for the old woman\", \"dismantle the giant tuna\", and \"make sticky rice cakes\".\n\nTitles[]\n\nAchievements[]\n\n\"Plus\" Version[]\n\nA new version of the game will be released for PS3 in Japan only as Way of the Samurai 3 Plus, with additional content, including 4 more companions (Osei, Itsuse, Araragihime, and Sensei). This content will not be available in the English version of the game.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe player's character's default model, as shown in the intro is the second Kenji shown in the Way of the Samurai intro. However, is now wearing a samurai armor outfit.\n\nAll character models in Way of the Samurai that is initially available are all able to be used except for the third head and body model and the second body model."
