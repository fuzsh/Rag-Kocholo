This truth is no more certain than the shadow they cast over themselves and having to live up the expectations they set. Coming out of nowhere (really the Palm Desert in California), the band set the template for the genre with Blues For The Red Sun (Dali) and Welcome To Sky Valley (Elecktra), but were always going to be hard-pressed to keep that pace. Looking back on their final album And The Circus Leaves Town (Elecktra), it may have not have lived up to its lofty older sisters, but it has some gems that maybe were not appreciated at the time since the band was disintegrating.\n\nJohn Garcia’s passionate raspy voice, Josh Homme’s singing riffs and leads, and the strong rhythm section of Scott Reeder and Hernández laid down some very strong tracks that would be better loved had they been by another band or a band that had not just made two masterpieces. With tracks like ‘Hurricane’, ‘One Inch Man’, ‘Gloria Lewis’, ‘Phototropic’, ‘El Rodeo’, ‘Jumbo Blimp Jumbo’, and ‘Catamaran’, the band has some gems that are worth reexamining, in the same way, Led Zeppelin fans overlook In Through The Out Door or Presence (both Swan Song/Atlantic), because they are not Physical Graffiti. Closing track ‘Spaceship Landing’ is ambitious and weird as an overlong exploratory experiment with other hidden tracks inside like a 1960s Pink Floyd or Hawkwind suite of tracks and gives an idea where they could have gone with one more full album. I still think Garcia and Homme might show us something someday if the spirit moves them.\n\nShare this Product"
