        "text": "In a new interview, Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme reported he is \"all clear\" of cancer since undergoing treatment. In the same breath, he reflected on \"dark times\" he's endured with the loss of several friends in music.\n\nIn April, the Queens of the Stone Age bandleader revealed he'd been diagnosed with a form of cancer in 2022 without specifying what kind. He's since recovered after a successful operation to remove it — a hopeful outcome after he experienced the 2022 deaths of his former bandmate in Queens of the Stone Age, the Screaming Trees' Mark Lanegan, and his friend Taylor Hawkins, the late drummer of Foo Fighters.\n\nWatch the video toward the bottom of this post.\n\nREAD MORE: Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme Shares His 'Go-To' Most Watched Films\n\n\"I don't look at the fact that a lot of people have passed away near [me], you know, nine people in the last … year and a half now,\" Homme tells ITV News.\n\nReferencing his split from wife Brody Dalle, with whom he has three children, the Queens of the Stone Age singer-guitarist continues, \"And I had a little heartache, and I had a little of this and a little of that. But also, I've never learned so much so quickly. And so, I'm sort of thankful for it all at the end because I feel closer to the things I truly love.\"\n\nAsked by ITV News correspondent Nina Nannar about the outcome of his cancer treatment, Homme answers, \"I'm good — I'm all clear.\"\n\nReturn of the Stone Age\n\nIn June, Queens of the Stone Age released their first new studio album in six years, In Times New Roman..., and are now on the road supporting it. All while Homme keeps his chin up.\n\n\"It's the kids that have made me feel better — whether they're out in the crowd or in their own home,\" he says. \"So, yeah, I feel the best I've felt all year. You know, I've lost band members and things like that to cancer. And it's not just about cancer.\"\n\nHomme adds, \"It's OK to be broad and say dark times come. But I guess, more than ever, I'm just trying to look for the light.\"\n\nSubscribe to Loudwire's newsletter and get the Loudwire app for rock and metal news.\n\nJosh Homme on ITV News - Nov. 14, 2023"
