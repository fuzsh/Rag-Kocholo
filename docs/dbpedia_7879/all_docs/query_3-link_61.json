        "text": "For the latest installment of Saint Laurent’s Music Project, which features stunning black-and-white portraits of music legends including Joni Mitchell and the late B.B. King, the French label has chosen Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme. The 42-year-old swapped out his grungy flannels and denim jackets for a more suave look in the images, which were shot by Hedi Slimane at Homme’s Hollywood Hills home in April, rocking an unbuttoned shirt and aviator shades while hanging out of the window of his classic ride.\n\nRead more Joni Mitchell is Saint Laurent’s New Campaign Star\n\nAnother portrait from the series shows the California native looking handsome in a Saint Laurent suit and tie while posing with his guitar. A view of downtown L.A., where Slimane is based, is picturesque in the background."
