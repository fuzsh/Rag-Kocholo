        "text": "Josh Homme Emergency Surgery Leads to Cancelation of QOTSA Tour\n\nQueens of the Stone Age have canceled the rest of their July tour dates due to frontman Josh Homme needing emergency surgery.\n\nA statement shared to the QOTSA social media channels reads, “QOTSA regret to announce that Josh Homme must return to the United States immediately for emergency surgery. Every effort was made to push through and play for you, but it is no longer an option to continue.”\n\nThe statement noted, “Ticket holders for festivals, please visit the specific festival website for updated information. Ticket holders for headline shows will be contacted directly from the point of purchase with further information.”\n\nThe following QOTSA shows have been canceled:\n\n7/10 – Festival Jardin Sonore – Vitrolles, FR\n\n7/13 – Pohoda Festival – Trencin, SK\n\n7/16 – Zitadelle Spandau – Berlin, DE\n\n7/17 – Colours of Ostrava – Ostrava, CZ\n\n7/18 – METAstadt – Vienna, AS\n\n7/20 – Electric Castle Festival – Cluj, RO\n\n7/23 & 7/24 – SRC Salata – Zagreb, HR\n\n7/27 – Athens Rocks – Athens, GR\n\nThe nature of Homme’s emergency surgery was not revealed. However, we send him our well wishes for a successful surgery, a speedy recovery and can’t wait to see him return to the stage soon.\n\nJosh Homme and the “Other Love” of His Life\n\nConsidering Homme’s emergency surgery, it’s easy to assume the important people in his life are likely concerned. Among those important people is Dave Grohl, who has been friends with Homme for many years. In fact, Homme talked about how close he and Grohl are in a December 2023 interview with The Los Angeles Times.\n\nIn the interview, Homme alludes to his ex-wife, Distillers singer Brody Dalle, as “the love of my life” and being grateful for their relationship because it led to their three children. However, when Grohl is brought up, Homme refers to the Foo Fighters frontman as “the other love of my life.”\n\nHomme says, “You don’t have a real relationship with somebody unless you can tell them to shut up at some point. And we have shut each other up in the most loving ways.”\n\nHe also touches on how the two of them have grown closer during recent tough times in their lives. Homme went through a very public divorce and custody battle with Dalle. Meanwhile, Grohl went through a brutal 2022, losing bandmate Taylor Hawkins and his mother, Virginia.\n\nHomme also mentions how they both would visit each other unannounced in recent years, because they both could tell when the other was down and needed comfort. The Queens of the Stone Age leader says he loves being there for Grohl and that the two are closer now than ever before.\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
