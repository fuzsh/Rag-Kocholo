        "text": "Hollywood, CA (April 28, 2016)—Producer Josh Homme recorded brass and strings for Iggy Pop’s new album, Post Pop Depression, in United Recording’s Studio A.\n\nPop and Homme began secretly working on the new album in early 2015. The clandestine Pop and Homme self-financed recording was without a record label at the time and with no outside influences on the project.\n\nPop first reached out to Homme by text message to ask if he was interested in writing music together. After they spoke by phone, Pop sent Homme some lyrics by mail, along with notes about Pop’s time working with David Bowie. Three months later, Homme sent lyrics to Pop, and they agreed to work together on recording songs in a studio. They brought incomplete ideas as opposed to finished songs, so that they could work on them together. Pop described the album as dealing with “questions of usefulness and legacy as one’s career nears its end,” according to an interview in Rolling Stone.\n\nConsisting of nine songs, the album was recorded at Rancho De La Luna in Joshua Tree, CA over the course of two weeks, with another week at Pink Duck Studios in Burbank, CA. Homme recorded brass and strings at United Recording studios last April.\n\nIn addition to vocal and instrumental contributions from Homme, fellow Queens of the Stone Age band member Dean Fertita, on guitar and keyboards, and Arctic Monkeys’ drummer Matt Helders also played on the album. Additional musicians included Danny T. Levine on valve trombone, trumpet, and marching French horn; Jordan Katz on trumpet; David Moyer on baritone sax and flute; Philip Blake Cooper on tuba; Eric Gorfain and Daphne Chen on violin; Lauren Chipman on viola; and Richard Dodd on cello.\n\nPost Pop Depression debuted at number 17 on the Billboard 200, making the album Iggy Pop’s highest charting album in the US."
