        "text": "M. Shadows Recalls Former Label Trying to Get A7X to Go Viral on TikTok\n\nM. Shadows is many things, and being candid is one of them. The Avenged Sevenfold frontman shared a funny story about how the band’s former record label once tried to get them to go viral on TikTok. (Spoiler: The effort went as well as you would expect.)\n\nIn an interview with Kerrang!, Shadows lamented the importance of going viral on TikTok to the music industry these days. The traditional promotional pushes since the internet and streaming are basically non-existent, and he refers to the whole landscape as the “wild west.”\n\nShadows explains that Warner Bros. tried to craft a way for A7X to go viral on TikTok. The attempt went over like a fart in church.\n\n“I’m a f—ing 42-year-old man, I’m not trying to figure out how to do a viral TikTok moment,” said Shadows. ” … You’re going to take 24 cents on our dollar and that’s all you can do, come up with a fucking fake viral TikTok moment?”\n\nNo details were offered about what type of social media stunt A7X’s record label tried to pull, but we would have paid good money to be a fly on the wall to see how that TikTok idea was pitched.\n\nWhy M. Shadows Left X (Formerly Twitter)\n\nA number of entertainers have left X (formerly Twitter) in recent years. Shadows is one of them, and he detailed his reasoning in January.\n\nShadows shared a thread to the social media platform “saying goodbye (kinda).” The frontman’s full remarks can be read below, but he’s clearly soured on the platform. He says he doesn’t find X useful anymore, nor does it interest him. Shadows says he’s grateful for being able to create relationships on X/Twitter, but he’s seen a change in being able to do so.\n\nHe closed his thread by writing, in part, ” … Just know every day we are building new ways that are meaningful to connect. This just isn’t one of them.”\n\nOf course, Shadows is far from the first celebrity to exit X/Twitter since Elon Musk bought the platform in October 2022. A diverse range of celebs — from Jameela Jamil to Mick Foley to Elton John — have either deleted their profile or simply haven’t been active.\n\nResearch firm Apptopia reported that in the first year under Musk, daily active users on X/Twitter went down about 13%. On top of that, ad-analytics firm Guideline reported that advertising declined 54% between September 2022-August 2023.\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
