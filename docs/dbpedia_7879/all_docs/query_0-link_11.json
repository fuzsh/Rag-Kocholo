        "text": "Josh Homme & Opinions on Superchunk\n\nQueens of the Stone Age founder Josh Homme joins Jim and Greg for a live conversation. And later, a review of I Hate Music, the new record from North Carolina indie rockers Superchunk.\n\naudio player Download Subscribe via iTunes\n\nMusic News\n\nEvery generation has its moment of nostalgia, from fans of New Kids on the Block to fans of The Pixies. But millennial nostalgia? Can our hearts tug for bands that broke up a mere 10 years ago? Apparently so, according to the recent Billboard albums chart. Backstreet's back with a Top 5 debut. We sent our own Gen Y expert Annie Minoff to see the Backstreet Boys' reunion show here in Chicago. She reports that the now \"Man Band\" still has the chops, but has added some unnecessary attempts at authenticity.\n\nJosh Homme\n\nWhile only just 40, Josh Homme is already a rock ‘n’ roll veteran with a ton of projects under his belt. The most famous of those is Queens of the Stone Age, the Palm Desert band who is touring behind its most recent release, Like Clockwork. But before Queens, there was the pioneering stoner rock band Kyuss. That band broke up in 1995, and Josh quit music altogether. But, it was The Screaming Trees and his stint as \"youth pastor,\" that brought him back to his fans. One of those fans is none other than Dave Grohl. And, while celebrating Grohl's 40th birthday at, where else, Medieval Times, he linked up with John Paul Jones. The trio formed Them Crooked Vultures over a turkey leg, and thus was born one of the greatest rock creation myths ever.\n\nI Hate Music Superchunk\n\nOver three decades in rock, Chapel Hill's Superchunk has kept true to the idealistic indie spirit of its era, regularly turning out records even as members Mac McCaughan and Laura Balance started Merge Records (still one of the most successful indie labels in the game). The band's latest album is I Hate Music. On it, Greg says he hears the band questioning the \"music is life, life is music\" philosophy it's always held onto. Can music still rejuvenate in the face of death, aging, and burnout? For Superchunk, Jim says, the answer is always yes, and you can hear it in those guitars. I Hate Music might not be the exuberant celebration that was 2010's Majesty Shredding, but Jim and Greg agree it's nevertheless a Buy It record.\n\nGreg\n\nFor his Desert Island Jukebox selection, Greg celebrates the musical legacy of Cowboy Jack Clement, the country music producer, songwriter, and artist who died recenly at age 82. Jack made his name at Memphis's Sun Studios during the 1950's, recording greats like Jerry Lee Lewis. But it was at Columbia that he helped craft Johnny Cash's inimitable \"Ring of Fire.\" The night before the \"Ring of Fire\" recording session, Cash had a dream about Mariachi trumpets. And he knew just who to turn to make that dream a reality. Greg credits Clement's horn riff on \"Ring of Fire\" with the track's enduring energy and distinctiveness.\n\nFeatured Songs\n\nGoose Island Credit Music: Pure Sunray, \"Caramel,\" Pure Sunray, 2013\n\nBackstreet Boys, \"In a World Like This,\" In a World Like This, K-BAHN/BMG Rights Management, 2013\n\nBackstreet Boys, \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back),\" Backstreet's Back, Jive, 1997\n\nQueens of the Stone Age, \"I Sat by the Ocean,\" …Like Clockwork, Matador/Rekords Rekords, 2013\n\nKyuss, \"Thumb,\" Blues for the Red Sun, Dali, 1992\n\nThe Desert Sessions, \"Hanging Tree,\" Desert Sessions, Volumes 7&8, Southern Lord/Rekords Rekords, 2001\n\nKyuss, \"One Inch Man,\" … And the Circus Leaves Town, Elektra, 1995\n\nKyuss, \"Green Machine,\" Blues for the Red Sun, Dali, 1992\n\nQueens of the Stone Age, \"Regular John,\" Queens of the Stone Age, Domino/Ipecac Recordings/Liberator/Loosegroove/Man's Ruin/Roadrunner, 1998\n\nQueens of the Stone Age, \"Avon,\" Queens of the Stone Age, Domino/Ipecac Recordings/Liberator/Loosegroove/Man's Ruin/Roadrunner, 1998\n\nQueens of the Stone Age, \"Go with the Flow,\" Songs for the Deaf, Polydor, 2003\n\nQueens of the Stone Age, \"Feel Good Hit of the Summer,\" Rated R, Interscope, 2000\n\nQueens of the Stone Age, \"First It Giveth,\" Songs for the Deaf, Interscope, 2003\n\nThem Crooked Vultures, \"No One Loves Me & Neither Do I,\" Them Crooked Vultures, RCA/DGC/Interscope, 2009\n\nThem Crooked Vultures, \"Scumbag Blues,\" Them Crooked Vultures, RCA/DGC/Interscope, 2009\n\nQueens of the Stone Age, \"I'm Designer,\" Era Vulgaris, Interscope/Rekords Rekords, 2007\n\nQueens of the Stone Age, \"I Appear Missing,\" … Like Clockwork, Matador/Rekords Rekords, 2013\n\nQueens of the Stone Age, \"No One Knows,\" Songs for the Deaf, Interscope, 2002\n\nSuperchunk, \"Overflows,\" I Hate Music, Merge, 2013\n\nSuperchunk, \"Me & You & Jackie Mittoo,\" I Hate Music, Merge, 2013\n\nJohnny Cash, \"Ring of Fire,\" Ring of Fire: The Best of Johnny Cash, Columbia, 1963\n\nJodeci, \"My Phone,\" Forever My Lady, Uptown/MCA, 1991\n\nPell Mell, \"Cinecitta,\" The Bumper Crop, SST, 1987\n\nJoe Satriani, \"Surfing with the Alien,\" Surfing with the Alien, Relativity/Epic, 1987\n\nThe Edgar Winter Group, \"Frankenstein,\" They Only Come Out at Night, Epic Records, 1973\n\nFootnotes\n\nNew Kids on the Block comeback\n\nBackstreet’s Top 5 debut\n\nBackstreet Boys’s website\n\nMan Band Takeover\n\nQueens of the Stone Age’s band site\n\nThe Palm Desert Scene\n\nFoo Fighters’ band site\n\nMedieval Times\n\nThem Crooked Vultures’s band site\n\nWUNC in Chapel Hill\n\nMerge Records\n\nI Hate Music on Merge Records\n\nMajesty Shredding on Merge Records\n\nCowboy Jack Clement’s obit\n\nSun Studios’s website\n\nJerry Lee Lewis, \"Whole Lotta Shaking\"\n\nJohnny Cash’s artist site\n\n\"Ring of Fire\"\n\nDear Listeners,\n\nFor more than 15 years, Sound Opinions was a production of WBEZ, Chicago's public radio station. Now that the show is independent, we're inviting you to join the band and lend a hand! We need your support more than ever because now we have to do all the behind-the-scenes work that WBEZ handled before (like buying insurance and paying for podcast hosting, ugh). Plus, we have some exciting ideas we'd like to try now that there's no one to tell us no!\n\nPlease consider becoming a Sound Opinions member by giving whatever you can via Patreon or with a one-time donation through PayPal. Thanks for listening, and thanks for your support!"
