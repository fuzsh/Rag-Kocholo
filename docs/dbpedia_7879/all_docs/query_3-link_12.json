        "text": "The first Queens record is iconic for us. Each album is a different marker on our path, but this is the one that started it all. It put the trance into the music.\n\nI had just left the Screaming Trees and returned to California. I wasn't even sure whether I was going to continue with music. Then I had this idea of giant waves of sound sweeping over me. I had an image in my head from an old Warner Bros cartoon of big, staggering robots. And that, I suppose, was my idea for Queens of the Stone Age: broken, drunk robots.\n\nI wasn't thinking long term. I was thinking about trying to create a new sound and I would figure the rest out later. I put a band together, and two days before we started the record I had another guy singing, a really talented guy, an amazing musician and an amazing player – but we just had a different vision. I could only realise mine if I stepped up and became the singer.\n\nIt made me scared, cautious and bold at the same time. I had things in my head and I really didn't know how to do them. So I went underground – stepped out of the spotlight and played on the underground scene. The thing about those underground guys is that they'll tell you if you suck, and I quickly learned how not to suck.\n\nI like how I can hear on the first QOTSA record that I don't want to be the singer. I like the apprehension. There's almost like an \"Oh, I hate my voice but I have to do this\" thing going on. It's not a perfect record. I listen to the track Regular John and the vocals and the guitar are out ... but it has a thing to it. It has its own wicked way.\n\nThe album is an exercise in repetition. It's trance music in the way it pushes your buttons. And I wanted to do something for girls. The way I thought about it was trance robot music for girls. I wasn't interested in the guys at all. I wanted to make something that girls could dance to that really had a freedom that Kyuss didn't. By the end, Kyuss felt restrictive. I'd lived my whole life in Kyuss since I was a boy, and we had all these rules that were based on what you couldn't do. And I wanted a new set of rules based on what you could. I have a distaste for authority because it's all about what you can't do. Not to be reactionary, but if someone drops a gauntlet and says, \"yes we can\", then I will go out and do that.\n\nThis record helped push me away from Kyuss and start a new thing. I always thought it would take three albums to explain to everyone, \"I'm gonna play whatever I want\". You can't move too fast or you just lose everybody.\n\nThe album doesn't sound dated to me. It just sounds like a cool record from a different time. The only reason I'm putting it out again is that it isn't available. I had it licensed in different places and they all ran out, so we're getting it out everywhere with Domino Records. It's ridiculous in this day and age that you can't get hold of people's records. I think there's a lot of Queens fans who haven't even heard it.\n\nThe process of doing this has started getting us into re-examining the record so now we're gonna tour it. We're doing the first record in its entirety with some more stuff, and we'll be coming to Europe in May. And doing the rehearsals for the first record is really defining the new one. It's been turning the new record into something else. What we were doing was kind of bluesy and now it's turned into this trancey, broken thing. The robots are back!\n\nJosh Homme was talking to Dan Martin. QOTSA debut album is reissued through Domino and available now."
