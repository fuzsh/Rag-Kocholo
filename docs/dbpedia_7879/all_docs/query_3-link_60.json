        "text": "It looks as though Josh Homme will soon be taking the title of musics busiest man away from Jack White, as the Them Crooked Vultures frontman announces he will be taking Queens of the Stone Age back into the studio later this year.\n\nCurrently working on new material for a second album with side-project Them Crooked Vultures, Josh Homme is planning to take Queens of the Stone Age back into the studio following Queens forthcoming August stint of festivals.\n\nRevealing the news to Rolling Stone, Homme claims that the next album will be \"all about wiggling hips. The music is gonna go further down that strange and lovely path of 'Era Vulgaris.\n\nWith Josh Homme writing new material with fellow Crooked Vultures Dave Grohl and John Paul Jones, other members of Queens of the Stone Age have been keeping themselves busy too. Keyboard and guitarist Dean Fertita is currently teamed-up with Jack White in the guise of the Dead Weather, while guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen is touring with his band Sweethead and drummer Joey Castillo is occupied with sleaze-rockers Eagles of Death Metal.\n\nBut until Queens of the Stone Age actually get into the studio, fans of the band can look forward to the reissue of second album Rated R. Receiving the 10th anniversary re-release treatment, the new Rated R will not only include the album itself but also a shed-load of bonus material consisting of live performances taken from the bands 2000 breakthrough performance at the Reading Festival. Thats not all though, the reissue will feature several B-side tracks including a cover of Carly Simons Youre So Vain, Kinks Wholl Be the Next in Line and Romeo Voids Never Say Never.\n\nAnother task on Josh Hommes list of things to do is the re-emergence of his own record label Rekords Rekords. The label issued Hommes previous collective Desert Sessions as well as the Eagles of Death Metal albums and the singer hopes to revive the label in the near future for a release of a Desert Sessions box set and more Eagles of Death Metal albums.\n\nNOTE FROM THE EDITOR\n\nWe don't run any advertising!
