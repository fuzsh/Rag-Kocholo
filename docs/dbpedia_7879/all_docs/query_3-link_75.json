        "text": "In spite of his often fierce music, Homme has gained a reputation as one of the \"nice guys\" of hard rock (like his friend Dave Grohl), due the encouraging atmosphere he creates for musicians he collaborates with and his pleasant, self-effacing public persona.\n\nFired Nick Oliveri in 2004 for his wild behavior, which is also the very reason he felt he should play with Nick in the first place. One of the final straws was when playing a show Nick walked over and said \"this isn't a good audience\" then threw an open beer bottle into the crowd later in the show. Several more instances like this made Josh decide to part ways as band mates but remain friends.\n\nOne thing about growing up in the desert was the solitude. You could see someone across the desert and say 'look, someone is coming', and 20 minutes later you would say 'look, they're still coming'.\n\nIf you're trying to do something different, you can't ask someone to help, because they'll want to make it not different.\n\nThe greatest day I had this year was when I found out that my fiancée was pregnant. How long have I known? Longer than you. I can't wait."
