        "text": "Iggy Pop is the executive producer on a new TV documentary series about punk, which will feature interviews with a host of big names from the original punk scene of the 1970s.\n\nSimply titled Punk, the four-part series will debut on US channel Epix on March 11. Punk musicians to feature in the series will include John Lydon of The Sex Pistols, Ramones‘ Marky Ramone, MC5 leader Wayne Kramer, Jello Biafra of The Dead Kennedys and Blondie‘s singer Debbie Harry and guitarist Chris Stein.\n\nPunk fans featuring will include Dave Grohl, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea and Guns N’ Roses bassist Duff McKagan. Punk will also showcase music industry figures of the time such as Elektra Records boss Danny Fields, journalist Legs McNeil and filmmaker Penelope Spheeris, who went on to direct films including Wayne’s World.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDetails of a UK screening of Punk have yet to be revealed. NME has contacted Iggy’s representatives for confirmation.\n\nIggy Pop is executive producer of the show along with his friend John Varvatos. Leading fashion designer Varvatos is a longstanding rock fan, who recently launched his own label John Varvatos Records. Welsh rockers Pretty Vicious will release their debut album on the label in 2019.\n\nRecommended\n\nVarvatos said of Punk: “Exploring and reliving the history of punk has been an absolute labour of love for me. Punk’s ability to transcend generations in its culture, music, and style is a story that needs to be told. So… Hey Ho, Let’s Go!”"
