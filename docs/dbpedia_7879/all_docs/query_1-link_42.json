        "text": "Motley Crue has released “Dogs of War,” their first single since they parted ways with guitarist Mick Mars.\n\nThe dark, anthemic song comes with an apocalyptic music video that is very bizarre and almost too strange for words. It really has to be watched, because there’s a lot going on. All we’ll say is the end involves snorting ashes and feels like a wild fever dream.\n\n“Dogs of War” is available for streaming/download here.\n\nA New Chapter for Motley Crue\n\nWhen “Dogs of War” was first announced earlier this week, the band said the song was “the start of a brand new chapter.” Obviously, without Mars in the picture, this is definitely a brand new chapter in that sense. However, the single also marks the first release from the Crue on a new label.\n\nIt was also announced this week that Motley Crue has signed with Big Machine Records. In a statement, Big Machine Chairman and CEO Scott Borchetta said, “Growing up in Southern California, I was in Hollywood when these new sheriffs showed up and took over the city. It was loud. It was powerful. It was game changing. Vince, Nikki, and Tommy, along with new guitarist John 5, have reignited the flame with ferocious new Crüe music. Fans will unite… SHOUT!”\n\nThe band added in their own joint statement, “We are thrilled to announce the forthcoming release of our new music through Big Machine Records. Scott’s been a friend and supporter of the band for a long time … We’re very happy to know our new music will be in the best of hands with Scott and his exceptional team at Big Machine.”\n\nA Breakdown of Mick Mars Exiting Motley Crue\n\nThings in the Crue camp and with Mars have been a bit wild since the guitarist retired from touring in October 2022. Mars filed a lawsuit in April 2023 against Mötley Crüe alleging his percentage of band profits was cut from 25 percent to 5 percent.\n\nMars claimed in his lawsuit the band held a meeting to “unilaterally” remove him from Mötley Crüe. He was also allegedly removed from many of the band’s various corporations and LLCs.\n\nAdditionally, Mars claims bassist Nikki Sixx repeatedly “gaslighted” the guitarist. Sixx told Mars he consistently forgot chords and fans were complaining about his playing. (Mars claimed in the lawsuit Sixx “did not play a single note on bass during the entire U.S. tour” and accused him of using backing tracks and pantomiming.\n\nMotley Crue Responds to Mick Mars’ Lawsuit\n\nThis led to Motley Crue issuing a statement in response to Mars’ lawsuit calling it “unfortunate and completely off-base.” The band said, in part, “In 2008, Mick voted for and signed an agreement in which he and every other band member agreed that ‘in no event shall any resigning shareholder be entitled to receive any monies attributable to live performances (i.e., tours).’ After the last tour, Mick publicly resigned from Motley Crue. Despite the fact that the band did not owe Mick anything — and with Mick owing the band millions in advances that he did not pay back — the band offered Mick a generous compensation package to honor his career with the band.”\n\nFurthermore, Motley Crue insisted they always perform live without backing tracks and stood by the claim Mars’ playing was declining. Mars then told Variety in an interview following news of the lawsuit, “Those guys have been hammering on me since ’87, trying to replace me. He added, ” … It’s just frustrating for me. I’m pretty upset that they’re even pulling this crap, when I carried these bastards for years.”\n\nThis led to Crue manager Allen Kovac to speak at length to Variety. Kovac referred to Mars’ entire legal strategy as “a smear campaign … misrepresenting the facts to the fans.” He further noted, “What’s upsetting to me is not Mick, but his representatives, who have guided Mick to say and do harmful things to the brand he cares about so much, Mötley Crüe. He has a degenerative disease and people are taking advantage of him. It’s called elder abuse.”\n\nVariety reached out to Mars’ attorney Edwin F. McPherson for comment on Kovac’s numerous statements. McPherson said of the lawsuit, “This is all Mick. He is tired of being bullied. This is nobody driving the train here but Mick.”\n\nA Legal Victory For Mick Marks, But There’s a Twist\n\nIn January, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge James C. Chalfant ruled that the Crue should have disclosed the corporate documents Mars requested, which was at the center of his lawsuit. Additionally, Judge Chalfant ruled that the Crue needs to cover Mars’ legal fees from this ordeal.\n\nHowever, now that the corporate documents requested have been handed over, Judge Chalfant ruled Mars’ lawsuit as “moot,” which Motley Crue’s legal team is viewing as a victory. Meanwhile, Mars’ legal rep said the matter of whether the guitarist was illegally squeezed from the band will still be determined during private arbitration later in 2024.\n\nMotley Crue: Their 40 Best Songs, Ranked\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
