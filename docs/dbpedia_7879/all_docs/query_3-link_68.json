        "text": "After announcing the cancellation of eight European tour dates earlier this month so frontman Josh Homme could return Stateside for emergency surgery, Queens of the Stone Age has announced the cancellation of an additional seven performances slated for August.\n\n“Due to continued medical care, it is under doctors’ orders that Josh Homme remain in their care in the United States,” read a statement posted to social media. “The Homme family and QOTSA are so grateful for the outpouring of well wishes and kind understanding at this time.”\n\nOn July 9, the band initially stated that it would be canceling eight European tour dates. In a post on social media, they expressed regret for having to cancel the shows, and said that they were left with no other choice. “QOTSA regret to announce that Josh Homme must return to the United States immediately for emergency surgery,” reads the statement. “Every effort was made to push through and play for you, but it is no longer an option to continue.”\n\nOf the shows canceled, Queens of the Stone Age bowed out of festivals in France and Slovakia, as well as headline shows in Croatia and Greece. Prior to the announcement, the group canceled its appearance at the AMA Festival in Italy on July 5 due to illness. The most recent spate of cancelations includes gigs at Way Out Fest and Cabaret Vert.\n\nThough it’s unclear what type of surgery Homme underwent, he’s been open about his health struggles over the years. Last year, he shared that he’d been diagnosed with a form of cancer in 2022 and underwent surgery to have it removed.\n\nIn 2023, Queens of the Stone Age released “In Times New Roman…,” its first album in six years. Shortly after, the group announced The End is Nero tour for North America followed by a set of European dates. This year, the band scheduled dates in Australia and North America, as well as some of the European shows they had to cancel."
