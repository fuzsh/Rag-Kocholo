        "text": "Beck, \"Sea Change\" (Interscope)—It's hard for Beck to release a record without reviving the time-honored, and somewhat timeworn, question of his authenticity. Is he an ironist in mannerist's clothing? A mannerist with the heart of a collagist? A parodist with a genius for pastiche? The matter isn't settled with this record, a set of moody breakup ballads that seems like a calculated rejection of the white-boy funk of his last album, \"Midnite Vultures.\" But after immersing yourself in the beautiful melodies and the surprisingly inventive production, you may not care.\n\nSolomon Burke, \"Don't Give Up On Me\" (Anti)—The singer and songwriter Joe Henry has had an erratic career as an artist, but he redeems himself completely as a producer, overseeing this full-fledged comeback by one of the most flamboyant and sublime soul singers of the sixties. Burke was great back when he was belting out \"Everybody Needs Somebody to Love\" and \"Cry to Me\"; here, he's even better, tearing into songs donated by Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Van Morrison, Brian Wilson, and Bob Dylan.\n\nManu Chao, \"Radio Bemba Sound System\" (Virgin)—Born in Paris to Spanish parents, Chao sings in the languages of his birthplace, his ancestors, and contemporary commerce (English). But Chao is no free-market cheerleader, and this collection, which was recorded last year during his epic world tour, includes sharp-edged songs from his earlier days in Mano Negra (the French rock group named after an Andalusian anarchist group) and his two recent solo albums.\n\nMissy Elliott, \"Under Construction\" (Elektra)—Elliott's previous album with her producer Timbaland, \"Miss E . . . So Addictive,\" was a breakthrough, unpredictable and full of humor. Here, she and Timbaland refine their sound, simplifying the beats and thickening the melodies. Elliott's raps, while sometimes raunchy, are never crass. The first single, \"Work It,\" is an instant classic along the lines of her earlier hit \"Get Ur Freak On,\" and the entire record is dirty fun for the whole family.\n\nThe Flaming Lips, \"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots**\"** (Warner)—In this delicious caricature of a full-blown rock opera, Wayne Coyne and his fellow Oklahoman visionaries have once again created an enveloping sonic utopia. This time, the Lips take inspiration from the Starburst-colored world of Japanese anime, as the black-belt heroine Yoshimi battles with Goliath-like foes amid Cat Stevens melodies, pulsing Ms. Pac-Man beats, heart-tugging symphonic interludes, and the occasional swell of canned applause.\n\nThe Hives, \"Veni Vidi Vicious\" (Warner)—This five-man Swedish band, fronted by the irrepressible Howlin' Pelle Almqvist—who can come off as a true garage-rock savant or a second-rate Mick Jagger—may not have sold as many records as the Vines or graced as many magazine covers as the Strokes, but they have better clothes, better videos, and, most important, better songs (\"Main Offender,\" \"Hate to Say I Told You So\").\n\nN.E.R.D., \"In Search of . . .\" (Virgin)—Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo (two-thirds of this group, along with the rapper-vocalist Shay) are better known as the producing duo the Neptunes, who have created hits for everyone from Britney Spears to LL Cool J, but their performance outlet is equally important. The band's name stands for No One Ever Really Dies, and the record, which combines a hip-hop sensibility with live rock instrumentation, is as slap-happy as a great George Clinton album.\n\nOrchestra Baobab, \"Pirates Choice\" (Nonesuch)—This double album of languid Cuban-influenced Afro-pop is technically a reissue, but as it marks the return of the legendary Senegalese orchestra (which released another fine album in 2002, \"Specialist in All Styles\") and as the new version includes six additional tracks from the original 1982 recording session, it deserves special notice. The orchestra's sweet guitar work, romantic horn playing, and warm vocalizing have been too hard to come by for too long.\n\nQueens of the Stone Age, \"Songs for the Deaf\" (Interscope)—This irreverent guitar-wielding collective, which features special guests like the former Screaming Trees vocalist Mark Lanegan and the powerhouse drummer Dave Grohl alongside head Queen Josh Homme, fluctuates between pummelling rock and sprawling psychedelia. Interspersed with snippets of radio gibberish lampooning the state of today's Top 40, the album is smart, subversive, and seductive.\n\nSleater-Kinney, \"One Beat\" (Kill Rock Stars)—Motherhood and endless praise haven't mellowed the Northwest's premier all-female power trio, who turn in one of their most ferocious albums yet, complete with an ode to parenting and a one-two punch of September 11th songs. Critics' darlings, maybe, but for once the critics are right.\n\nSpoon, \"Kill the Moonlight\" (Merge)—Propelled by throbbing electric piano, skittering tambourine, and the raw, Merseybeat-inspired vocals of their able songwriter Britt Daniel, the fourth release from these acclaimed Austin upstarts is their best yet. Unlike many neo-garage bands, Spoon actually has ideas, along with the rock-and-roll wherewithal to make them dangerous and sexy.\n\nWilco, \"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\" (Nonesuch)— This enthusiastically left-field and briefly orphaned record is filled with world-weary tunes and anxious instrumentation. Mangled feedback, delicate strumming, and soulful keyboards swirl and harmonize, while the front man, Jeff Tweedy, sings about his midnight blues. There are no hit singles here, just a brilliant, battered album from one of the world's most original bands."
