        "text": "Iggy Pop, 'Post Pop Depression' (Loma Vista/Concord). Collaborating with Queens of the Stone Age leader Josh Homme — who also serves as producer here — the 68-year-old Stooges frontman, punk-rock pioneer and onstage exhibitionist extraordinaire delivers one of his more potent solo records even while stating it will be his last record, period.\n\nGwen Stefani, 'This Is What the Truth Feels Like' (Interscope). Unlike her other two, bubblier solo LPs, or her punk-to-pop material in No Doubt, Stefani's current solo gambit will be interpreted as being about her high-profile divorce and higher-profile post-divorce romance, although it's also about her existence as a middle-aged mom.\n\nVarious artists, 'Southern Family' (Low Country Sound/Elektra). Much-prized Americana producer Dave Cobb runs through his Rolodex to get Jason Isbell, Miranda Lambert, Shooter Jennings and Zac Brown, among many others, on a conceptual compilation of songs that, as indicated by the album's title, focus on the Southern family.\n\n— Jon M. Gilbertson,\n\nSpecial to the Journal Sentinel\n\nMore online\n\nFor a list of additional new CDs, visitjsonline.com/music.\n\nKris Allen, 'Letting You In' (DogBear). Winner of the eighth season of 'American Idol' is on his fifth overall full-length, which was recorded in Nashville, and he doesn't move far from the muted Mraz-and-Mayer stylings of previous discs.\n\nATOM N EVOL, 'Just a Game' (Lockdown). Florida isn't just about Miami and Pitbull, as shown by this Tampa trio that admits to being influenced by Tool and the Deftones but obviously has absorbed Black Sabbath into its riffs on this long-player.\n\nBlaze Bayley, 'Infinite Entanglement' (Blaze Bayley). Former Iron Maiden vocalist for two of its albums and sole Wolfsbane vocalist carries on with metal-imbued science-fact and science-fiction ambition on the 52-year-old's latest solo, concept record.\n\nBirth of Joy, 'Get Well' (Long Branch/SPV). Dutch threesome that draws lightly on British space-rock sounds of the 1990s and stoner-rock sounds from the 1960s to the present tries to get closer to the mania of its live show on its latest studio album.\n\nB-Movie, 'Climate of Fear' (Cleopatra). In 1982, B-Movie had an international New Wave hit with 'Nowhere Girl' and, after reuniting all four original members in 2011 and recording new material in 2012, keeps its second wind blowing with keyboard-forward melodic rock and four 'Nowhere Girl' edits and remixes.\n\nThe Bonnevilles, 'Arrow Pierce My Heart' (Alive Naturalsound). The combination of garage-, blues- and punk-rock sounds with the sparseness of a duo has reached far enough from Detroit and Akron to come back via Northern Ireland and the Bonnevilles, whose new LP smolders very well.\n\nCilver, 'Not the End of the World' (eOne Music). Creatively co-led by guitarist Leon Lyazidi and one-name vocalist Uliana, NYC hard-rock act has the feminine, aggressive power of Lacuna Coil and Halestorm, with whom Cilver is currently touring.\n\nCircus Maximus, 'Havoc' (Frontiers Music Srl). Norwegian band with Roman name refines its balance of progressive-rock musicianship, heavy-metal thunder and accessible melodies on its fourth studio long-player.\n\nDaddy, 'Let Me Get What I Want' (We Are Daddy/Kobalt). Besides his various doctorates, art projects and acting appearances in mediocre bro comedies, James Franco is now also in a band with an art-school classmate, Tim O'Keefe, and Daddy, that band, now has an album and film inspired by the Smiths, whose bassist, Andy Rourke, plays bass on the album.\n\nDrinking Flowers, 'New Swirled Order' (Manifesto). A handful of years ago, a bunch of Orange County residents shed day jobs, formed Drinking Flowers and decamped to Los Angeles, there to make pleasantly woozy postpunk pop as heard on this second LP.\n\nThe Falcon, 'Gather Up the Chaps' (Red Scare Industries). Punky band formed by members of the Lawrence Arms and featuring a member of Alkaline Trio returns after six relatively dormant years with a member of the Loved Ones, a second full-length and future mixtape favorites like 'Hasselhoff Cheeseburger.'\n\nFractal Mirror, 'Slow Burn 1' (Third Contact/Synergy). Dutch and American modern-prog band released LPs in 2013 and 2015 and, with its third, compresses prog elements into shorter songs, focuses on vocals and is not unlike a warmer version of the Church.\n\nMartin Fröst, 'Roots' (Sony Classical). Swedish clarinetist and conductor works with Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra to trace 2000 years of dance and folk-music evolution in a continuous soundscape encompassing a Gregorian hymn, klezmer, Bartok and new pieces.\n\nHÆLOS, 'Full Circle' (Matador). Two men and one woman in London combine their talents in HÆLOS for a debut LP that takes the elements of electronic dance music and turns the mirror ball into near-solitary, reflective post-dancefloor energy and pensiveness.\n\nHooverphonic, 'In Wonderland' (Columbia). Now pared down to the duo of Alex Callier and Raymond Geerts, Belgian group once defined as a trip-hop thing has long since incorporated such slinky grooves into a broader musical spectrum 20 years after its first LP.\n\nJames, 'Girl at the End of the World' (BMG Rights Management). Manchester collective that's survived 'Madchester,' Britpop, electronica crazes and its own breakup from 2001 to 2007 releases its 14th album, an intentional extravaganza with a pop-rock heart.\n\nJazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis, 'The Abyssinian Mass' (Blue Engine). The JALC and the Chorale le Chateau join esteemed trumpeter Marsalis on a two-CD, one-DVD exploration of faith that marks the 200thanniversary of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church with a commissioned piece built upon the form and shape of a church service.\n\nJumpcuts, 'Fiber Optic Bondage' (Manta Ray). Band that formed in Baltimore around 2008 and around the base of lead singer and multi-instrumentalist Andy Shankman puts out its second full-length of cautiously mesmerizing synth-coated rock.\n\nDamien Jurado, 'Visions of Us on the Land' (Secretly Canadian). Closing the baggy trilogy begun and continued with 2012's 'Maraqopa' and 2014's 'Brothers and Sisters of the Eternal Son,' Seattle singer-songwriter lays out 17 songs that push beyond the limits — of scope and of style — suggested by his indie and folk backgrounds.\n\nDustin Kensrue, 'Thoughts That Float on a Different Blood' (Vagrant). Thrice lead singer and guitarist fills some of the time Thrice fans spend waiting for the next Thrice album with a solo disc that collects live covers, including songs by Lorde, Miley Cyrus and Tom Waits.\n\nKoi Child, 'Koi Child' (Pilerats Records). Tame Impala's Kevin Parker provides the production and attention to an Australian assembly that, with its deft and deceptively laid-back fusion of hip-hop and jazz, provides a satisfying crossover reminiscent of Digable Planets or Arrested Development.\n\nLight Up the Sky, 'NightLife' (Rise). Spokane, Washington band's five members have quit their minimum-wage jobs to tour and otherwise promote a new album of screamo, emo, punk and pop that ought to appeal to the post-grunge generation.\n\nLonesome River Band, 'Bridging the Tradition' (Mountain Home Music). Contemporary-bluegrass group that released its first LP 31 years ago doesn't stop finding ways to tweak and twiddle with the tradition on the dozen songs of its latest LP.\n\nLords of Black, 'II' (Frontiers Music Srl). On the bonus tracks of the compact-disc version of its second album, prog-metal band Lords of Black shows its general rock love with covers of Rainbow and Queen songs, while the main tracks are floridly loud and headbanging.\n\nMob Rules, 'Tales From Beyond' (Steamhammer/SPV). While the German power-metal group's latest long-player isn't nearly so well-titled as its 2012 predecessor, 'Cannibal Nation,' it does feature a three-part title number and tunes with Dio charm.\n\nWilliam Michael Morgan, 'William Michael Morgan EP' (Warner Nashville). Mississippi native with a smooth baritone and a new-looking cowboy hat includes his 2015 modest hit and introductory single 'I Met a Girl' among the six songs on his first neo-Nashville EP.\n\nMudface, 'The Bane of Existence' (Mudface Music, LLC). Metallica adopted the Bay Area as its home and bands like Exodus and Testament were from there, so Mudface, another San Francisco-environs metal group, has a city's history to live up to on this disc.\n\nCullen Omori, 'New Misery' (Sub Pop). Former frontman for Smith Westerns, a once-promising indie-rock band from Chicago, deals with that breakup and reconstructs his musical identity on a solo introduction meant to distill his previous work into purely colorful indie-pop purpose.\n\nAnders Osborne, 'Spacedust & Ocean Views' (Back On Dumaine). Born in Sweden but as American as any other Louisiana resident, Osborne's music is also soaked in Americana from the bayou to L.A. and carries all those miles in rootsy songwriting and relaxed playing.\n\nGrant-Lee Phillips, 'The Narrows' (Yep Roc). One of many musicians who've moved to Nashville without any particular modern-country affinities, former Grant Lee Buffalo alt-rock leader uses his 2013 relocation to Music Row and his Native-American ancestry as levers for his latest folk-soulful solo turn.\n\nPrimal Scream, 'Chaosmosis' (First International/Ignition). Nearly 30 years after its first long-player, Scottish rock band that's always had an interest in dance music, alternative or other state-of-the-art subgenres puts out its 11th overall studio album, which, with help from Björn Yttling of Peter Bjorn and John, sticks inside the confines of three-minute pop songs.\n\nPublic Memory, 'Wuthering Drum' (Felte). Brooklyn artiste Robert Toher recorded his first Public Memory LP while in Los Angeles, a location that might have influenced his darkwave take on EDM and his Thom Yorke-ish vocals.\n\nRedfoo, 'Party Rock Mansion' (Party Rock/ADA). Uncle of Sky Blue, with whom he recorded two increasingly popular albums and two chart-topping hits as LMFAO, moves on to his own thing with a solo slab that has a suspiciously similar title to LMFAO's 'Sorry For Party Rocking.' But Stevie Wonder's on it.\n\nGrace Rodson, 'Red Hot Fire' (Gracimusic Ltd). A UK-based singer of an ultramodernized version of Latin jazz styles goes all-out for dance-pop gold with a dizzyingly long list of producers, collaborators and guests.\n\nThe Roosevelts, 'The Greatest Thing You'll Ever Learn' (The Roosevelts). Jason Kloess and James Mason, a.k.a. the Roosevelts, are a Nashville duo whose first LP might be broad enough to appeal to both Zac Brown and Jason Mraz fans.\n\nShe Is We, 'War' (Vanguard). Rachel Taylor of pop duo He Is We has gone off to form She Is We, a pop-drenched alt-rock quartet with a first LP that carries reminders of Roxette, K's Choice and Pink among its 11 quickly burrowing earworms.\n\nJordan Smith, 'Something Beautiful' (Republic). Kentucky native and winner of the ninth season of 'The Voice' in 2015 gets production from Stephan Moccio, an Oscar and Grammy nominee, on a sweet-natured, gently theatrical introduction that includes original songs alongside covers of 'Amazing Grace,' 'Over the Rainbow' and more.\n\nSoul Asylum, 'Change of Fortune' (eOne Music). Started in Minneapolis in the 1980s and finding mainstream success briefly with 'Runaway Train' circa 1992, Soul Asylum — essentially original member Dave Pirner and three relative latecomers — hasn't, on its newest release, massively altered its recognizable, and hook-laden, alt-rock messiness.\n\nAdam Stafford, 'Taser Revelations' (Song, By Toad). Scotland-based filmmaker and musician is an experimenter with guitar pop and what can go into it, and his third LP in that jeweled vein turns up the pop side so that the experimental side makes it all the stranger.\n\nThe Treatment, 'Generation Me' (Frontiers Music Srl). On its third full-length, Cambridge, England hard-rock band isn't timid about stomping with riffs from the Cult, rhythms from AC/DC and vocals from late-period Bad Company aimed at listeners like love guns.\n\nUnderworld, 'Barbara Barbara, We Face a Shining Future' (Smith Hyde Productions/Caroline International). On its ninth studio album and first new one in six years, British electronic twosome makes its shortest long-player ever and slides confidently through two suites of slow combustion.\n\nVarious artists, 'Star Wars Headspace' (Hollywood). 'Rabbi' Rick Rubin executive-produces electronic dance music — by Kaskade, Röyksopp, Bonobo and more — featuring music, effects, and dialogue from the most famous science-fantasy films of all time.\n\nSean Watkins, 'What to Fear' (Thirty Tigers). On his fifth solo album, one-third of Nickel Creek equals the other two-thirds, his sister Sara and mandolin demi-god Chris Thile, with ten songs that vary from genteel traditionalism to quirk-laden indie pop.\n\nWords Like Daggers, 'Perfect Weather' (Third String). Des Moines and Iowa in general don't get much credit for interesting bands — feel free to blame Slipknot for that — but Words Like Daggers has emo-rock intensity of sufficient heat to cook corn on its first long-player.\n\nHans Zimmer and Junkie XL, 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)' (WaterTower Music). German composer Zimmer and Dutch electronic composer Tom 'Junkie XL' Holkenborg collaborate while trying to bring gravitas to director Zack Snyder's superheroic conflict between the Dark Knight and the Big Blue Boy Scout."
