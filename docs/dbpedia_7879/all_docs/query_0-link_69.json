        "text": "Josh Homme and Dave Grohl are obviously close, but clearly, their friendship runs deep.\n\nHomme detailed their bond in a new interview with the Los Angeles Times. He alludes to his ex-wife, Distillers singer Brody Dalle, as “the love of my life” and being grateful for their relationship because it led to their three children. However, when Grohl is brought up, Homme refers to the Foo Fighters frontman as “the other love of my life.”\n\nHomme says, “You don’t have a real relationship with somebody unless you can tell them to shut up at some point. And we have shut each other up in the most loving ways.”\n\nHe also touches on how the two of them have grown closer during recent tough times in their lives. Homme went through a very public divorce and custody battle with Dalle. Meanwhile, Grohl went through a brutal 2022, losing bandmate Taylor Hawkins and his mother, Virginia.\n\nHomme also mentions how they both would visit each other unannounced in recent years, because they both could tell when the other was down and needed comfort. The Queens of the Stone Age leader says he loves being able to be there for Grohl and that the two are closer now than ever before.\n\nGrohl’s Latest Good Deed\n\nWe bet it would be pretty easy to become friendly with Dave Grohl, because he really just seems like a great guy. The latest example of this came just this past week.\n\nDuring an off day on the Foo Fighters’ tour in Australia, Grohl used his time to cook up some BBQ for homeless people in Melbourne.\n\nGrohl partnered with the local non-profit organization The Big Umbrella. Together, they cooked and serveed over 400 meals to those in need. The organization wrote via Instagram, “Our friends on the street were treated to an epic American style bbq with all the trimmings prepared by rock legend Dave Grohl of the @foofighters.”\n\nThe Big Umbrella added, “The vibe was at an all-time high at Fed Square for this very special one-off lunch feast. It will be a day ‘our friends on the streets’ will never forget as they brushed up against a rock legend and one of the nicest guys on the planet who genuinely cares for people in need. No words can fully capture the impact of this positive experience.”\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
