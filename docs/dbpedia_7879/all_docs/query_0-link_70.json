The band disbanded in 1995 and since then members of Kyuss have gone on to form or play in several notable bands including Queens Of The Stone Age, Fu Manchu, Dwarves, Eagles Of Death Metal, Mondo Generator and Them Crooked Vultures. Kyuss began jamming in 1987 under the name Katzenjammer before deciding upon Sons Of Kyuss. Brant Bjork selected the name from the undead monster found in the Advanced Dungeon and Dragons roleplaying game. In 1989 they recorded their eponymous debut EP, Sons Of Kyuss, which was the only release to feature Chris Cockrell on bass. After self-releasing the EP in 1990m they recruited Nick Oliveri to replace Cockrell on bass and shortened their name to Kyuss. The band’s first line up consisted of vocalist John Garcia, guitarist Josh Homme, bassist Nick Oliveri and drummer Brant Bjork. The band built a local following and performed at parties in and around Southern California’s desert areas. The band signed with independent label, Dali, who released their debut album, Wretch, in September 1991. Album sales were slow, though the band was quickly making a name for itself as a live act. In 1992, the band and producer Chris Goss began work on Blues For The Red Sun. Released in June of that year the album was critically hailed and is today widely regarded as a pioneering stoner rock album. By the end of 1993, the band was invited to open nine dates for Metallica, touring Australia. Oliveri left the band following completion of the album and Scott Reeder made his debut at a release party for Blues For The Red Sun. The band soon signed with Elektra Records after Dali hit financial problems and was bought by Elektra. In 1994, they issued their first major label debut, self-titled Kyuss. Between record company shuffling and band member shuffling it would take a year for the album recorded in 1993 to be released. Again produced by Goss, the album received critical acclaim and musically demonstrated a much more psychedelic and mature sound. In July 1995, they released their fourth and final album, ….And The Circus Leaves Town. The album was not as successful commercially as Sky Valley, receiving mixed reviews. The band broke up in late summer of 1995.\n\nTrack Listing\n\nSide A\n\n1Un Sandpiper 8:16\n\n2 Shine 5:55\n\n3 50 Million Year Trip (Downside Up) 5:45\n\n4 Mudfly 2:26\n\nSide B\n\n1 Demon Cleaner 5:20\n\n2 A Day Early And A Dollar Extra 2:17\n\n3 I’m Not 4:30\n\n4 Hurricane 2:42\n\nSide C\n\n1 Flip The Phase 2:16\n\n2 Fatso Forgotso 8:34\n\n3 El Rodeo 5:36\n\nSide D\n\n1 Gardenia (Live) 6:46\n\n2 Thumb (Live) 4:38\n\n3 Conan Troutman (Live) 2:18\n\n4 Freedom Run (Live) 7:54"
