        "text": "Queens of the Stone Age guitarist and singer Josh Homme has apologised after a female photographer said she was kicked during a concert.\n\nChelsea Lauren posted a video to Instagram which appears to show Homme kicking out at woman holding a camera.\n\nShe wrote: “Thanks to josh homme queens of the stoneage I now get to spend my night in the ER. Seriously, WHO DOES THAT?!?”\n\nShe told Variety magazine that Homme had actions were \"obviously very intentional\".\n\n“I saw him coming over and I was shooting away,” she said. “He looked straight at me, swung his leg back pretty hard and full-blown kicked me in the face. “\n\nShe says she will file a police report.\n\nMs Lauren later wrote that she was released from hospital early the following morning, adding “My neck is sore, my eyebrow bruised and I’m a bit nauseous.”\n\nHomme wrote on the Queens of the Stone Age Twitter account that he was \"lost in performance\" and believed he had kicked over lighting on the stage.\n\nUpon hearing that Ms Lauren was injured, he said: “I did not mean for that to happen and I am very sorry.\n\n“I would never intentionally cause harm to anyone working at or attending one of our shows and I hope Chelsea will accept my sincere apology.”\n\nHe later posted a video on the band’s Twitter page where he said he had to “figure out some stuff”.\n\nThe singer (44) said: “I made a lot of mistakes in my life and last night was definitely one of them... “I wanna be a good man, but I think last night I definitely failed at that... I’m gonna have to figure out some stuff, I think.”\n\nThe band were headlining on Saturday at the KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas concert in Inglewood, California, when the incident took place. – PA"
