        "text": "He finds it very strange\n\nQueens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme has criticised bands who don’t play their crowd pleasing biggest hits at live shows.\n\nJosh Homme recently appeared on the Tuna on Toast With Stryker podcast to promote QOTSA’s latest album ‘In Times New Roman...’, when he spoke about how he constructs setlists.\n\nThe guitarist and vocalist explained he’s in favour of mixing things up at Queens of the Stone Age shows, however the band’s biggest hits are always the bedrock of the setlist.\n\n“I understand that I’m always going to play (Queen of the Stone Age’s 2002 anthem) ‘No One Knows’ because I still like playing that song and that’s something that it’s an agreement with the audience,” Homme said.\n\n“I assume that this is a part of coming here to see us, and here you go. When there’s bands that don’t want to play their big song or their big songs, I always think it’s a little c---y to do that. Acting like a song that a lot of people like is a burden is just a strange reaction to the gift that your fans have given you. Seems like an odd reaction.”\n\nHe continued: “In the years of doing this, I’ve seen a lot of artists do that at times. Sort of get angry at their own music for doing well.\n\n“Having fans is a cool thing. And they want stuff. And when it comes to playing the stuff that they want, I feel like that’s why this is happening, right? You guys are all here because you want to hear some stuff and also have no idea what’s going to happen. And you need to have that basic food group in order for me to surprise you, too. Surprise requires knowing some constants are going to happen. So I don’t sweat stuff like that.”\n\nQueens of the Stone Age’s eighth studio album ‘In Times New Roman...’ was released in June and it peaked at Number 2 in the UK.\n\nThe band played a trio of outdoor UK shows in June and they return to these shores in November for an arena tour. Tickets are on sale from Planet Rock Tickets now.\n\nQueens of the Stone Age’s UK & Ireland tour dates:\n\nNOVEMBER 2023\n\nManchester AO Arena – Tue 14th\n\nLondon The O2 – Wed 15th\n\nGlasgow OVO Hydro – Sat 18th\n\nBirmingham Resorts World Arena – Sun 19th\n\nStockton-on-Tees Globe Theatre – Mon 20th\n\nDublin 3Arena – Wed 22nd\n\n24 rock stars' jobs before they were famous, including Josh Homme:\n\nListen to Planet Rock on DAB nationwide, on our Rayo app, online or via your smart speaker (“Play Planet Rock”)."
