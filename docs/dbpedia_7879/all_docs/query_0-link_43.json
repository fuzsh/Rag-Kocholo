        "text": "Kyuss was an American band formed in Palm Desert, California, in 1987, and considered one of the pioneers of the genre. After disbanding in 1995, a number of band members have gone on to form or play in several notable bands including Queens of the Stone Age, Screaming Trees, Fu Manchu, Dwarves, Eagles of Death Metal, Mondo Generator, Hermano, Unida, Slo Burn and Them Crooked Vultures.\n\nHistory\n\nThe band formed in 1987 jamming under the name Katzenjammer before eventually deciding upon Sons of Kyuss. Brant Bjork selected the name from the undead monster found in the Advanced Dungeons & Dragons roleplaying game. In 1989 the band recorded their eponymous debut EP, Sons of Kyuss, which was their only release to feature Chris Cockrell on bass. After self-releasing the EP in 1990, the band recruited Nick Oliveri – who had previously played second guitar in Katzenjammer – to replace Cockrell on bass, and shortened their name to Kyuss.\n\nKyuss' first line-up consisted of vocalist John Garcia, guitarist Josh Homme, bassist Nick Oliveri and drummer Brant Bjork. The band gradually built a local following in Palm Desert, California and frequently performed at parties in and around the isolated towns of Southern California's desert areas.\n\nThe band then signed with independent record label Dali, a subsidiary of the Elektra Records-distributed Chameleon Records, who released their debut album, Wretch, in September 1991. Several songs on the album were re-recorded versions of those that appeared on the Sons of Kyuss EP. Album sales were sluggish, though the band was quickly making a name for itself as a live act.\n\nIn 1992, the band, along with new producer Chris Goss, began work on their next album, Blues for the Red Sun. Released in June that year, the album was critically hailed. By the end of 1993, they were invited to open nine dates for Metallica touring Australia.\n\nIn 1993, Kyuss were moved from Dali to the main Chameleon label, and recorded their third album, Welcome to Sky Valley, in June 1994 to critical acclaim. One of the album's singles, \"Demon Cleaner\", reached number 78 on the UK Singles Chart.\n\nIn July 1995, Kyuss released their fourth and final album, ...And the Circus Leaves Town. The band's only album recorded for a major label, it featured a simpler sound, in contrast to the instrumentally based Welcome to Sky Valley. \"One Inch Man\" was released as the album's only single in June 1995, and a music video was also made for the song. The album was not as successful commercially as Sky Valley, receiving mixed reviews. Kyuss broke up during the late summer of 1995.\n\nIn November 2010, three former members of the band (minus Homme, who declined to participate) reunited under the adapted moniker \"Kyuss Lives!\" for a world tour with plans to record a new album. A federal lawsuit subsequently filed by Homme resulted in Oliveri leaving the band in March 2012. Five months later, a court ruled that Garcia and Bjork were not allowed to release audio recordings under the Kyuss Lives! moniker. As a result, they changed their name to Vista Chino.\n\nDiscography\n\nMain article: Kyuss discography\n\nWretch (1991)\n\nBlues for the Red Sun (1992)\n\nWelcome to Sky Valley (1994)\n\n...And the Circus Leaves Town (1995)\n\nBand members\n\nJosh Homme – guitars (1987–1995)\n\nJohn Garcia – lead vocals (1987–1995)\n\nBrant Bjork – drums, percussion (1987–1994)\n\nChris Cockrell – bass guitar (1987–1991)\n\nNick Oliveri – rhythm guitar (1987–1988), bass guitar (1991–1992)\n\nScott Reeder – bass guitar (1992–1995)\n\nAlfredo Hernández – drums, percussion (1994–1995)\n\nLineups\n\n1987–1989\n\nKatzenjammer\n\nJohn Garcia – lead vocals\n\nJosh Homme – lead guitar, backing vocals\n\nNick Oliveri – rhythm guitar\n\nChris Cockrell – bass\n\nBrant Bjork – drums, percussion\n\n1989–1991\n\nSons of Kyuss\n\nJohn Garcia – lead vocals\n\nJosh Homme – guitars, backing vocals\n\nChris Cockrell – bass\n\nBrant Bjork – drums, percussion\n\n1991–1992\n\nJohn Garcia – lead vocals\n\nJosh Homme – guitars\n\nNick Oliveri – bass\n\nBrant Bjork – drums, percussion\n\n1992–1994\n\nJohn Garcia – lead vocals\n\nJosh Homme – guitars\n\nScott Reeder – bass\n\nBrant Bjork – drums, percussion\n\n1994–1995\n\nJohn Garcia – lead vocals\n\nJosh Homme – guitars\n\nScott Reeder – bass\n\nAlfredo Hernández – drums, percussion\n\nTimeline\n\nSee also"
