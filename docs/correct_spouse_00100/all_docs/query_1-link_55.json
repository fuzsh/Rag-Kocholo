The 50-year-old Parker will tell her story through a series of letters.\n\nParker was in a relationship with actor Billy Crudup from 1996 until 2003. The couple split while she was seven months pregnant with his child, William Atticus, born in 2004. She also once dated actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who played her character's late husband on the Showtime series \"Weeds,\" and singer Charlie Mars.\n\nParker has starred in the films \"Grand Canyon\" and \"Fried Green Tomatoes\" and in a Broadway production of \"Proof,\" for which she won a Tony. She also nabbed both an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe in 2004 for her performance in the HBO miniseries \"Angels in America.\" In 2006, she won a second Golden Globe, for her work on \"Weeds.\""
