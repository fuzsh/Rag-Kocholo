Throughout their relationship, they were often seen attending various events together, such as music festivals and movie premieres. Despite having shared quite an adventurous journey, their relationship ultimately ended around 2010, lasting just over a year.\n\nDiving into the world of music, Charlie Mars is an American singer-songwriter hailing from Mississippi. He gained fame with his distinct sound and meaningful lyrics, including hits like \"Listen to the Darkside\" and \"Like a Bird, Like a Plane.\" Aside from his relationship with Parker, Mars has remained relatively private about his personal life.\n\nAge : 50\n\nBirthplace : Laurel, Mississippi\n\nMary-Louise Parker and Jeffrey Dean Morgan started dating in 2006 after meeting on the set of TV's Weeds, where Morgan played Judah Botwin, Parker's late husband. The couple's relationship swiftly moved forward, with Morgan even proposing to Parker in early 2008. Sadly, their engagement was short-lived, and they decided to call it quits later that same year.\n\nKnown for his versatile acting abilities, Jeffrey Dean Morgan has appeared in numerous TV shows and blockbuster films. Morgan made waves in Hollywood with roles on hit shows like Supernatural, Grey's Anatomy, and The Walking Dead as the notorious villain Negan. Before his relationship with Parker, Morgan was married to actress Anya Longwell and linked to actress Hilarie Burton, whom he later married.\n\nMary-Louise Parker and Billy Crudup's tumultuous relationship began in 1996 after they starred together in the play Bus Stop. The two led a relatively quiet love life until 2003 when Crudup infamously left Parker, who was seven months pregnant with their son, for actress Claire Danes. Although their split was highly publicized and scrutinized, Parker and Crudup eventually co-parented their child together.\n\nBilly Crudup is an accomplished actor, both on stage and screen, having won a Tony Award for his Broadway performance in The Coast of Utopia and starring in memorable films such as Almost Famous, Big Fish, and Watchmen. In addition to his highly publicized relationship with Parker and brief romance with Claire Danes, Crudup has otherwise kept his personal life private.\n\nAdam Duritz and Mary-Louise Parker had a brief romance in the late '90s. They met at a party in Los Angeles and hit it off instantly; however, their whirlwind romance was short-lived, and they soon went their separate ways. Nevertheless, their relationship contributed to the bevy of high-profile romances that Duritz has experienced throughout his life.\n\nAdam Duritz, lead singer of the alternative rock band Counting Crows, gained widespread fame with hits such as \"Mr. Jones,\" \"Round Here,\" and \"Accidentally in Love.\" He has often been in the limelight for his romantic escapades, having been linked to Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, and Emmy Rossum, among other notable names in Hollywood.\n\nPat Mannochia\n\nPat Manocchia and Mary-Louise Parker's relationship began in the early '90s and ended before Parker started seeing Crudup. The two were first introduced at Manocchia's gym, La Palestra, in New York City and dated for several years before eventually parting ways. Their relationship remained relatively low-key in comparison to Parker's other high-profile romances.\n\nAs a renowned fitness guru, author, and owner of La Palestra gym, Pat Manocchia has made quite a name for himself in the health and wellness industry. He has trained numerous celebrities and written books on fitness, including The 5-Factor Fitness and Anatomy of Exercise. Apart from his relationship with Parker, Manocchia has remained tight-lipped about his love life.\n\nAge : 69\n\nBirthplace : Rhode Island\n\nMary-Louise Parker shared a brief romance with actor Timothy Hutton in the early '90s. They met in 1991 while working together on the film The Substance of Fire and were subsequently spotted at various events together. Although their relationship was short-lived, it marked one of Parker's earliest high-profile romances.\n\nTimothy Hutton is a talented actor known for being the youngest actor to win an Academy Award for his role in the 1980 film Ordinary People. His impressive career includes roles in films such as The Falcon and The Snowman, The Dark Half, and Leverage. In addition to his relationship with Parker, Hutton has been married twice, first to actress Debra Winger and later to illustrator Aurore Giscard d'Estaing, niece of former French President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing."
