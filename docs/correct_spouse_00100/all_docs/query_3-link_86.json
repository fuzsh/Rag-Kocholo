        "text": "Charlize Theron\n\nCharlize is an award-winning actress, a tireless humanitarian, and if that wasn't enough, she's also a mother of two — if Charlize Theron had time to go out on a date, it would only confirm just how incredibly capable she is. With all that being said, the actress is open to being in a long term partnership, but Marriage, however? Not exactly.\n\nAssuming someone can manage to measure up to Charlize's standards (and honestly, is any man good enough for her?), Theron has said on a few occasions that matrimony isn't for her \"…I don't need to have a wedding. Where I would be in my heart, and my life with a partner is going to be exactly the same.\"\n\nNaomi Watts\n\nEven we were upset when Naomi Watts and Liev Schreiber broke up - after being together for 11 years; their relationship came to an abrupt end. The couple has two kids together, and despite their break up, they have managed to keep their relationship as friendly as possible for the sake of their children.\n\nWatts and Schreiber were never married, to begin with, so we could argue that made their split much easier as they didn't have to deal with the paperwork that comes with getting divorced. Nothing quite binds two people like having kids together, and these amicable exes will always be in each other's lives, co-parenting their two children.\n\nJohn Cusack\n\nCusack spent the 1980s carving out a niche for himself as both a solid actor as well as an object of infatuation for girls everywhere, a status aided immeasurably by his portrayal of the lovable underachiever Lloyd Dobler in 'Say Anything.' But John Cusack hasn't been married, and that's okay! Marriage isn't for everyone.'\n\nWhether or not Cusack is looking to settle down one day or not, he's not talking about it — the actor is quite reserved about his personal life. The truth is, we don't mind, he's obviously a good enough performer to play the romantic lead, and we're happy to live in la-la land with Lloyd Dobler and his boombox.\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio is probably recognized as Hollywood's most well-known Bachelor and has yet to settle down. Perhaps but the Bachelor has never found his own one true love. He has been in some seriously high profile relationships with models, but at the end of the day, the 44-year-old still hasn't settled down.\n\nMarriage is, after all, a serious commitment. While Hollywood hasn't got the best reputation for marriage longevity, it seems Leo prefers to be safe rather than sorry, and just not marry at all. Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't seem to mind. Leo has received some criticism for dating women much younger than him, 22-year-old Camila Morrone. However, reports say the couple is more serious than many of his past relationships.\n\nQueen Latifah\n\nQueen Latifah is one of the most prominent female hip-hoppers of the '90s thanks to her soulful and uplifting rhymes; Queen Latifah has also crafted an increasingly successful screen presence. Despite wanting to know more about the lives of our favorite celebs, Latifah has managed to keep her personal life remarkably private. One thing we know for sure about Latifah's love life is that we know she's not married.\n\nThere is some speculation around Latifah's sexual preferences and possible romantic partners, but somehow we're still in the dark regarding her private life. If Queen Latifah does decide to get married, how long would it take for us to hear about it?\n\nOwen Wilson\n\nWhether he's acting or co-writing scripts for brilliantly quirky characters, Owen Wilson's work radiates a carefree yet charming comic sensibility. Owen Wilson had a few high profile romances when he was younger, but nowadays, he seems happily settled into his life as a single dad.\n\nEven as Owen flourished in his roles in Blockbuster romcoms, there seem to be no signs that he's looking to settle down in his personal life. This doesn't mean that he won't ever get married, especially considering that Wilson has confessed that he is becoming \"more sentimental\" as he grows older.\n\nOprah Winfrey\n\nOprah Winfrey came from a troubled childhood, only to become the most powerful and influential woman in television. It would make sense that having strong support is important to the media mogul, which is why she is thankful to have a special someone by her side — and no, we're not talking about her bestie Gayle King. Oprah and Stedman have been together for years, and we don't see that changing anytime soon.\n\nOprah is convinced that marrying Graham would have ended in disaster, \"What I realized is, I don't actually want to be married…because I would not have the life that I built for myself.\" Looking at the empire that Oprah has created, with Graham at her side, who would dare say she should have done anything differently?\n\nParis Hilton\n\nWhile few of us may remember Paris's first fiancé Jason Shaw, who could forget that time when she became engaged to Greek shipping heir, Paris Latsis?\n\nParis and Paris may have been the perfect pair, at least for the few months they were together. More recently, everyone's favorite socialite got engaged to actor Chris Zylka. But even Paris' dream wedding wasn't quite right for the star, so she's single, and to use her own catchphrase, \"That's hot.\"\n\nTyra Banks\n\nTyra Banks once said, \"a smart model is a good model,\" and she seems destined to prove it in every way. She's widely known as one of the world's foremost supermodels, and Tyra has sealed her position in pop culture — the selfie generation really owes the supermodel an enormous debt as she invented \"the smize,\" otherwise known as smiling with your eyes.\n\nAnd it's not just aspiring models that should look to Tyra as an example; she's got good advice for all the singletons out there too. Tyra isn't precisely against Marriage, but she's also not waiting for anyone to be her end-all-be-all. \"My mom taught me to never wait for someone to sweep me off my feet.\" Tyra is all smizes about her life, successful career, and baby boy — who needs a prince when you're Tyra Banks?\n\nJake Gyllenhaal\n\nSingletons around the world should take note, Jake Gyllenhaal may be single right now, but don't expect him to stay a bachelor forever. In an interview, he told Howard Stern that he \"loves love,\" and we all love him, so it makes sense that the in-demand actor will be as in-demand in the dating world.\n\nSo why is it that the ever-charming Gyllenhaal hasn't said \"I do\" to anyone yet? It would seem that he just hasn't found the right girl, and we get that. \"…I believe in monogamy, and I believe when you meet somebody right, it will be right and will work out.\"\n\nJamie Foxx\n\nRelationship conspiracy theorists rejoice! It finally happened! Jamie Foxx has secretly been in a relationship with Katie Holmes for years now, has at long last confirmed that they are indeed dating by appearing on the red carpet together in 2019. So we assume the next step is down the aisle, right?\n\nUnfortunately not, as Foxx and Holmes have split after six years of dating. The unfortunate news of their break up came just three days after Jamie Foxx was seen holding hands with singer Sela Vave. Foxx says, \"I don't know if I'm made for Marriage…When it comes to connecting with somebody. I know I could be serious in our connection.\"\n\nJon Hamm\n\nWe would do well to not get him confused with his iconic character Don Draper — Jon Hamm isn't nearly as serious as his fictional character. On the show \"Mad Men\" his character was twice divorced, but in his personal life - the actor has never been married. Hamm was in an 18-year relationship with fellow actor Jennifer Westfeldt, but they never actually got married.\n\nIt was for the best that they never wed, seeing as they went their separate ways back in 2015. So how much fun can single life be for someone considered to be the sexiest-man-alive? \"It's fine,\" he says before adding quietly, \"It's difficult to be single after being together for such a long time. It's tough. It's a bummer.\"\n\nShakira\n\nWe would be surprised to find out that Shakira isn't actually married? She's had a long relationship with Spanish footballer Gerard Piqué, and the couple had two children before separating, but they never really got married.\n\nWhile they were still together, Shakira announced their relationship already worked as a married couple and that \"they don't need papers for that\". And as we all know, Shakira (and her hips) don't lie.\n\nWinona Ryder\n\nEven though Johnny Depp tattooed \"Winona Forever'\" to his upper arm during their three-year engagement with Winona Ryder, the two sadly would not last forever, but Ryder believes it was for the best.\n\nNowadays, Winona is happily dating her long-term beau, fashion designer Scott Mackinlay Hahn, and beyond that, she's not sure getting hitched is worth it. \"I'd rather never get married than to be divorced a few times.\" And, according to director Francis Ford Coppola, she may have actually married Keanu Reeves while filming The Guardian, so maybe she's not so single after all?\n\nSheryl Crow\n\nSheryl Crow appeared on the music scene in the early '90s, but her hit songs still ring true today, and at the age of 55, she also happens to be a working single mom. While raising her two sons by herself, she writes songs whenever the single mom has a spare few seconds. With that being said, she hasn't closed herself off to the idea of getting married just yet.\n\nWhen she does meet the one, Sheryl knows now what she'd do differently. \"I think I would skip getting engaged next time, as she has been engaged a couple of times. If ever again, I was that close to getting married, I would just go for it.\" We like her decisiveness!\n\nLucy Liu\n\nWe admire anyone who lives their life by their own rules, and that's precisely what Lucy did when she had her son through a gestational carrier, she decided to become a single mother, and she's doing it with style. When interviewed about her new role as a mother, she said, \"My work and my personal life used to overlap, but now that I have a child, it's very different.\"\n\nLiu has the backing and support of her close friends whenever the single mom needs help or some time off. Lucy is unusually secretive about her love life, but if her \"unconventional\" route to becoming a mother is anything to go by, any relationship she's in won't be too conventional either.\n\nChelsea Handler\n\nChelsea never ceases to astonish us with her wild and amusing antics. Handler's unapologetically blunt opinions have both turned heads and given her a massive following. It's clear that the bold comedienne doesn't take herself too seriously, so how can we expect her stand on relationships to be any different?\n\nAfter she realized the stress of a big lavish wedding wasn't required to get married, Handler has changed her mind. \"So now I would get married. Now that I'm finally single and have no viable options,\" she said through laughter. We're positive that loads of guys would be happy to date Handler, she is so funny after all!\n\nEmma Watson\n\nThe child star is now one of the world's most recognized actresses, and in recent years, Watson has used her fame to try and make a change when it comes to issues from gender inequality to sustainable fashion. With this much on her mind, she doesn't care much for dating or relationships.\n\n\"I never believed in the 'I'm happy single' story,\" she continues. \"It took me a while, but I'm thrilled [being single]. I call it being self-partnered.\"\n\nLauren Graham\n\nWatching Lorelai's wedding to Luke in the bonus season of Gilmore Girls in the most whimsical wedding we've ever seen had us in tears. To see Lauren Graham as a bride was a real delight, especially as the actress isn't interested in a walk down the aisle.\n\nGraham and her partner, the actor Peter Krause, have been together for almost a decade now, but they don't feel the need to say \"I do\" just to make it valid, they're married in spirit. While talking to Ellen DeGeneres, Graham clarified that what they have is \"good just as it is.\"\n\nMindy Kaling\n\nMindy Kaling has had quite the journey in Hollywood. She began a team of writers while being in a wildly popular show \"The Office\" to starting her own show fittingly called \"Mindy.\" Now, she's writing scripts left, right and center, all the while, being a new mom!\n\nShe has stated that her work is so rewarding, she doesn't need anyone to fulfill her right now.\n\nEmilia Clarke\n\nFans lusted over Emilia Clarke after seeing her incredible performance in the world's most popular TV show, Game of Thrones. While many fans wished to see her with Jason Momoa (the actor who played Khal Drogo) in real life, those wishes unfortunately never materialized.\n\nHowever, she does seem to be enjoying her ever-growing career and free time. There were rumors that Clark was dating actor Seth MacFarlane, the creator of 'Family Guy', just a few years before 'Game of Thrones' debuted. Emilia eventually did admit that the rumors were right and that the two had dated, but they had separated since. Clarke also dated James Franco, Cory Michael Smith, and even Jai Courtney in 2015, none of whom took the time out of their busy work schedules to head out to the nearest ring designer.\n\nDiane Keaton\n\nDiane Keaton is 73 this year and has an interesting theory behind why's she has never been married ― she thinks she's \"an oddball.\" Though she dated many men over the years, Diane continues to have an incredibly successful career and has raised two children.\n\nDiane Keaton is fine with having never walked down the aisle, saying, \"I don't think it would have been good for me to get married, and I'm happy I didn't.\" Keaton confesses she's absolutely unapologetic about it. If only we could age with that kind of self-confidence!\n\nSandra Bullock\n\nSandra Bullock is one of the highest-earning, most successful actresses in the world. And if that's not enough, she's also one of the best looking ones. The actress saw her fame jump to celebrity levels after her role in the action thriller, 'Speed', alongside Keanu Reeves. Since then, Bullock went on to act in some of the most profitable films in the last century, and her movies combined a worldwide gross that currently stands at over $5 billion.\n\nThe popular actress was once engaged to actor Tate Donovan, whom she met while filming 'Love Potion No. 9'. She also had a controversial relationship with the then-young hotshot, Ryan Gosling. Bullock was 37 years old, while Gosling was just 21! Bullock also dated Matthew McConaughey and NFL quarterback, Troy Aikman. She has two adopted children and is raising them by herself as a single mother. The actress was involved in a close relationship with photographer Bryan Randall, who sadly passed away in August 2023.\n\nMary-Louise Parker\n\nOur last single celebrity who just can't seem to find the guy of her dreams is Mary Louise Parker, the famous star of the drama show, 'Weeds'. The actress had a lot of success and fame through the show, but unfortunately, she has not seen that sort of success in her love life.\n\nSo far, two men have penetrated the shell of Mary Louise Parker's armor, with one being Billy Crudup, and the other being the charismatic and endearing Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Crudup and Parker had a child together but were eventually separated, probably because they were never even engaged in the first place. Morgan and Parker were actually engaged at one point in their relationship, but the marriage was called off for personal reasons, and the couple went their separate ways.\n\nMarisa Tomei\n\nMarisa Tomei is an Italian-American actress, last known for her appearances in the Spider-Man films as Spidey's gorgeous aunt May. Over the years, she has had many public relationships as she has dated many public men, including Lenny Kravitz, Robert Downey Jr., and Christian Slater. However, none of these hotties has managed pin down this cross-cultured cutie as she is currently still single and living in the US.\n\nMarisa is not recently single either, in fact, the 54-year-old (can you believe it? She looks so good!) actress has been single for quite a while now, and apparently enjoys living her solitaire life just fine. I'm sure having a successful career and a look that never ages can help, but I'm not buying the \"happily single\" act. This actress is just waiting for Mr. Right to come along and sweep her off her toes!\n\nKylie Minogue\n\nDon't let her beautiful looks, incredible talent, and amazing personality fool you; this amazing woman is not one for a relationship. After going through some very challenging trials and tribulations, including a very tough bout with breast cancer, the famous singer-songwriter has resolved that she's not the type of person who's built for Marriage. Fortunately for her fans, just when they thought that everything was lost, a new hope was found.\n\nA few years ago, Kylie chose to go with her heart instead of her words, as she almost got married to British actor, Joshua Sasse. The two were dating, and things were looking up for them, but as is often the case in Hollywood, they ended up breaking up in 2017. It seems that Kylie simply isn't as easy to impress as some other celebrities, or maybe she just really isn't interested at all in settling down with a man.\n\nSarah Silverman\n\nSarah Silverman is one of the most divisive figures in comedy. With her jokes revolving around notorious topics such as racism, sexism, politics, and religion, the Jewish comedian has managed to agitate people in both left and right political circles. Silverman has also acted in various films, such as 'School of Rock', 'Wreck-It Ralph', and 'A Million Ways to Die in the West'.\n\nSilverman has dated the famous comedian and SNL writer, Dave Attell, and even had a thing with Jimmy Kimmel in 2002. She also dated actor Michael Sheen in the past. There are very little signs of Silverman ever changing her mind and getting married in the future, so the eligible comedian will most likely stay single or just casually dating for the rest of her life.\n\nRebel Wilson\n\nEveryone loves Rebel Wilson. The actress appeared in various beloved films, such as 'Bridesmaids', 'What to Expect When You're Expecting', 'Pitch Perfect', 'How to Be Single' and 'Isn't It Romantic?'. The Australian actress has been a leading activist on body positivity and weight loss. She also dated the popular British actor and comedian, Matt Lucas, in 2012. The couple ended up living together in West Hollywood until the end of their relationship, in 2015.\n\nSince then, Wilson has been mostly single and lives by herself in her multi-million dollar apartment. In 2015, it was reported that Wilson briefly dated stuntman Aden Stay and comedian Mickey Gooch Jr. But nothing seems to have materialized.\n\nKristin Davis\n\nEveryone remembers Charlotte York Goldenblatt, the naive believer in love from HBO's romantic comedy show, 'Sex and the City'. She portrayed the role between 1998 and 2004 and received several Emmy nominations. Her character was married twice in 'Sex in the City'. But outside of the show, the actress often appears in broadway shows and has a ladies' apparel and accessories line that debuted in 2008.\n\nIn her personal life, the actress has never been married and currently has two adopted children. The first was adopted in 2011 and is named Gemma Rose Davis; the second was adopted in 2018. This talented star is obviously very giving and generous, and we only wish to see her share those traits with a matching handsome suitor someday soon.\n\nJacqueline Bisset\n\nThe drop-dead-gorgeous actress, Jacqueline Bisset, has been working since 1965 and is still active today. Needless to say, she has never been at a loss for suitors when it comes to the love department. The actress has even had the luck to carry out not 4, but 5 different long-term relationships. But for some reason, the now-75-year-old never ended up finding the one that was worth sticking around for.\n\nJust like it is with many other high profile celebrities, many of Jacqueline's relationships were inevitably public, including her time spent with Emin Boztepe, and Vincent Perez, who is a Swiss actor. Perhaps one of the reasons that Jacqueline hasn't yet found someone worthy enough to tie the knot with has something to do with the fact that most of the men she's dated were almost 20 years younger than her...\n\nJorja Fox\n\nAnother star on our list that has a recurring role in a crime drama show is Jorja Fox. Fox is famous for her regular role as Sara Sidle in the CBS police drama, 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'. After CSI, the actress faded relatively into obscurity and wasn't seen as much. Despite being ranked #80 in Stuff magazine's list of the world's 103 sexiest women, this one is still very much single.\n\nIt's believed that the actress has dated CSI co-star Lelah Foster. However, rumor has it that she also went out with actor Gary Dourdan, who was another co-actor from the show, and later dated Suzanna Mara - a Hungarian who appeared in a few films from the '90s. So it's pretty safe to say that Fox ultimately played for both teams. This makes it even stranger that the beautiful actress is not yet tied down.\n\nHalle Berry\n\nHalle Berry began her career as a model and almost won Miss USA in 1986. The actress went on to win the Academy Award for Best Actress, making her the first woman of African American descent to have won the award. During the 2000s, Berry became one of the highest-paid actresses in Hollywood.\n\nBerry is somewhat of a serial monogamist — she was married three times and got divorced from her most recent husband, Olivier Martinez, in 2016. At 53 years old, she still looks as good as ever and can easily start dating men half her age. Who knows? Maybe one of them would be her forever, man.\n\nJennifer Aniston\n\nJennifer Aniston is one of the most beautiful, talented, and beloved actresses in Hollywood. The actress often practices Hatha yoga, Budokan karate, and transcendental meditation. With such a holistic lifestyle, an amazing personality, and a whopping net worth of over $200 million dollars, it's unbelievable that the actress who portrayed sexy fashionista, Rachel Green, in 'Friends' is somehow still single.\n\nAniston was married to hottie Brad Pitt between 2000 and 2005 before he left her for Angelina Jolie. She was also married to film actor and director Justin Theroux from 2015, but their relationship soon fell apart, and they were divorced in 2017. Since then, Aniston has been single, or at least she hasn't spoken publicly about dating anyone. Hopefully, third time's a charm.\n\nMichael B. Jordan\n\nNot to be confused with basketball player Michael (no B.) Jordan, this handsome fella must have gotten used to making some heads spin. While he is definitely one of the popular kids on the block, Jordan has a geeky side too, and he is a fan of superheroes as well as anime. Every woman's dream.\n\nJordan has been rumored to date Swedish musician Snoh Aalegra after starring in her music video, but that was way back in 2018, and neither of them commented on those rumors. Other than that, there is very little known about his romantic relationships. Basically, he is single until someone proves he isn't.\n\nTom Hiddleston\n\nMany would know Tom Hiddleston from the Thor franchise and other Marvel films, where he plays Loki, the trickster god from the Norse mythology. But Hiddleston's true character is nothing like the villain he plays in those films. This fine English scone of a man is the perfect gentleman, as any of his co-stars will tell you.\n\nAt 39 years old, Hiddleston has a couple of high profile relationships under his belt, like a three year period with actress Susannah Fielding and a few months of dating Taylor Swift. However, gentleman as he may be, no one has been able to call him her husband yet.\n\nHenry Cavill\n\n'Batman vs. Superman: Dawn Of Justice' wasn't a great movie, but it did have some highlights. There was Wonder Woman's first appearance, and there was Henry Cavill playing Superman. Ah, Henry Cavill, there isn't enough screen time in the world to do justice to all those muscles and perfect skin and smoldering gaze and… what were we talking about?\n\nOh yeah, he's single! Those interested in turning him into a husband should be prepared to move to London and get along with his dog, Kal. So basically, there are no downsides here.\n\nEdie Falco\n\nEdie Falco has been through some tough things in her life. In 2003 the award-winning actress was diagnosed with breast cancer and had to deal with alcoholism. She has since begun practicing Buddhism, and in 2005 and 2008, she adopted a son and a daughter.\n\nIt's assumed that she's a very private person and is not looking for a relationship, which means that we're probably not going to see a Falco marriage anytime in the future, although you never know how these things turn out.\n\nSharon Stone\n\nAmerican actress Sharon Vonne Stone is also a producer and a former fashion model for commercials and print advertisements. Her first role was an extra in Woody Allen's comedy-drama, entitled \"Stardust Memories.\" She later had the pleasure of acting in several films, playing minor characters, until she rose to international fame as a sex symbol, when she starred as Catherine Tramell, in \"Basic Instinct (1992).\"\n\nIt appears that Stone is being proposed to on a regular basis. She has been engaged several times but has only been married twice. Her latest Marriage, however, officially broke off in 2004, and she hasn't been married since. She has three sons, all of whom are adopted.\n\nJames Franco\n\nEveryone knows James Franco as a famous actor, but he's also a great filmmaker and instructor at NYU, USC, UCLA, Studio 4, Palo Alto High School and Playhouse West. He has already received a couple of Golden Globes, proving to the world that he's a great actor. Plus, he volunteers for the Art of Elysium charity.\n\nAll that success, charitable work, those magnificent cheekbones, and an IQ of 130, make us wonder how is it that he has never been married. As far as we know, he is not involved in a romantic relationship, but with his track record, we think he won't stay single for long.\n\nAisha Tyler\n\nAisha N. Tyler, famously known as Andrea Marino from the first season of Ghost Whisperer, is an American Actress, director, comedian, and talk show host. Her roles in films and television shows like Criminal Minds, Lana Kane, and CSI: Crime Scene Investigation were all independent women using their voice, making her a beacon of inspiration amongst female fans.\n\nRight now, she holds a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Entertainment Talk Show Host. Tyler has had a 25-year-long marriage to attorney Jeff Tietjens which ended in 2017. This powerhouse of feminism and activism hasn't been married since, nor were there reports of significant relationships.\n\nKate Beckinsale\n\nKathrin Romary Beckinsale is a British actress who made waves after starring in the fantastic movie \"Underworld\". When asked about her past, she told everyone that it was always her dream to be an actress. She was immersed in film ever since she was young and has worked her way up to the top.\n\nHer acting skills are great looks have made many heads spin. She has had an eight-year-long relationship with actor Michael Sheen, a 15 year-long relationship with director Len Wiseman, and another short fling with comedian Pete Davidson. None of them, however, has ever popped the question, which makes you rethink men as a species altogether.\n\nGeena Davis\n\nVirginia Elizabeth \"Geena\" Davis is an American actress who's also an activist, a producer, and a former archer and model. She was one of the brightest celebrities of her time and has received multiple accolades for her work, both in film and television. Her portrayals of authentic and strong female characters have made her such an icon.\n\nShe has an impressive academic background under her belt, as well as a successful acting career. She can thank her incredible IQ of 140 for her excellent portrayals and A+ grades! Apparently, that brain appeals to many, as Davis has been married three times. Actually, four times if you count the 17-year-long relationship with Rezah Jarrahy, which ended in 2018. Could husband number 5 be right around the corner?\n\nDavid Duchovny\n\nDavid William Duchovny is an American actor, producer, writer, novelist, director, composer, and singer. He's famous for his role as FBI agent Fox Mulder, on the hit television series \"The X-Files\", and as a writer named Hank Moody on \"Californication.\" The two roles have earned him Golden Globe Awards.\n\nHe is also the proud owner of a few tattoos. The most visible of them is the AYSF anagram one on his ring finger. He got it instead of a wedding ring when he was married to Tea Leoni. The two got divorced in 2014, and he hasn't been married since. For now, we don't know of any plans he might have to remove the tattoo. Perhaps he's still hoping for a comeback?\n\nLupita Nyong'o\n\nBorn in Mexico, Lupita started her career in the early 2000s, as part of the production crew for many major films. She went on to make her debut as an actress in the short film, East River. In 2009, she wrote, directed, and produced her own documentary about the albino population in Kenya shortly after she enrolled in the Yale School of Drama and graduated with a Masters of Fine Arts.\n\nShe's beautiful, talented, AND a genius! There isn't a lot of information on Lupita's personal life, let alone her romantic relationships. We do know, however, that she is not and has never been married. How? Now THAT is the real mystery.\n\nAshley Judd\n\nAshley Judd has been a Hollywood sweetheart since her role in \"Ruby in Paradise.\" She continued to earn recognition as a high profile actress with her performances in Heat, Someone Like You, Frida, A Time to Kill, Kiss the Girls, Double Jeopardy, and more. But there's much more to this actress than artistic talent.\n\nJudd has been doing humanitarian work for more than a decade. She was once married to race car driver Dario Franchitti for 12 years. The two split in 2013, and Judd hasn't found a man to be able to handle her skills and brains since.\n\nRihanna\n\nDespite being just 32, this super-successful musician and entrepreneur is one of the world's most popular and richest celebrities, with a net worth of $600 million. Despite Rihanna's wealth and excessive spending on beauty, fashion, and accessories, she claims that her favorite way to spend her fortune is on others. Riri is also known for her involvement in many humanitarian causes.\n\nHer successful music career led her to win several awards, including Grammys, and she currently ranks as the second best-selling music artist in the world. With the beauty, dance moves, voice, and personality to match you'd think. Despite all this, she prefers being single, for now, at least!\n\nKat Dennings\n\nKatherine Litwack's beauty makes our jaws drop every time she appears in film screenings. The actress, known professionally as Kat Dennings, made her acting debut in HBO's 'Sex and the City', by playing an obnoxious 13-year-old who hires Samantha to handle PR for her Bat Mitzvah.\n\nToday, we know her better for her performance as Max Black, the busty waitress from \"2 Broke Girls.\" The talented actress was nominated for four acting awards between 2008 and 2014. While there is no denying Dennings's success and beauty, she still remains single and happily so!\n\nChristina Hendricks\n\nGetting her big break as Joan in \"Mad Men\", Christina Hendricks is often cast for the front-and-center type of roles. Hey, it's hard to imagine that fiery red hair blending into any kind of background. We are sure that the fabulous and talented actress made one hell of a bride in 2009 when she married fellow actor Geoffrey Arend, but sadly, their marriage didn't last.\n\nThe two broke things off in 2019 and Hendricks hasn't expressed any interest in getting into a similar relationship since. (Well, not that she told us, anyway.)"
