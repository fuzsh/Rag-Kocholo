        "text": "From Fried Green Tomatoes to Weeds, Mary-Louise Parker has had her share of fame. Now the 50-year-old actress is writing a memoir entitled Dear Mr. You, a book is based on letters written to significant others who have passed through her life.\n\nOne possible book subject includes actor Billy Crudup (Big Fish), with whom Parker had a relationship from 1997 to 2003. The two lived together for seven years after which they costarred in the 1996 stage revival of Bus Stop. Although reps for the actor deny the rumor, Crudup is said to have left Parker for another woman (Claire Danes) when she was seven months pregnant with their son, William Atticus.\n\nAnother subject possibility is Jeffrey Dean Morgan. Parker met Morgan on the set of Weeds and the couple began dating in December 2006 but broke up soon after.\n\n“We’re not together anymore,” Morgan told People magazine. “Everything’s fine, but it just didn’t work out. Wrong time in both our lives.”\n\nHowever, Parker and Morgan rekindled their love and became engaged in February 2008, only to break up again in April.\n\nParker began dating singer Charlie Mars in 2009 after attending one of his shows and even appeared in his video, “Listen to the Darkside.”\n\n“It was at the Soho House in New York,” she said. “I just met him briefly that night—a bunch of people went to dinner after, and I just talked to him briefly, then he called maybe a month-and-a-half later and asked if I wanted to be in his video.”\n\nDear Mr. You will be published by Simon & Schuster imprint Scribner.\n\n“I am so honored and thrilled to be working with Scribner and in the company of such wonderful writers,” Parker said.\n\n“From Frank McCourt to Jeannette Walls to Anjelica Huston, Scribner loves a great memoirist, and Mary-Louise Parker is one,” said senior vice president and publisher Nan Graham. “Her writing is magnificent; the conceit—a memoir in letters to men—is wholly original and brilliantly executed.”\n\nAlong with her well-loved role of Nancy Botwin, the marijuana-growing soccer mom on Weeds, Parker has appeared in roles on television shows such as The West Wing and Angels in America, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress as well as a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nParker also won a Tony Award in 2000 for her portrayal of Catherine in the Broadway production of Proof.\n\nDear Mr. You will be released in fall 2015."
