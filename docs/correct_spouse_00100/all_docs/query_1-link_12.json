But they've called off the wedding, according to a source close to the couple.\n\nParker has a son with ex-boyfriend Billy Crudup (who left her when she was seven months pregnant and took up with Claire Danes) and adopted a daughter last year. The source says the couple had differing lifestyles, and that Parker wants to stay friends."
