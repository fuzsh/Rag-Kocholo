        "text": "About two years ago, something really sketchy went down with Jeffrey Dean Morgan. He had been dating Mary-Louise Parker and they seemed really tight and really sexy, and then suddenly their relationship seemed to skid out of control. They suddenly became very “off and on” and they finally seemed to end circa fall/winter 2009. MLP quickly found a new piece, who she’s been with ever since. But many people think that the reason JDM and MLP’s relationship got so sketchy so fast was because Jeffrey had some kind of relationship with CW chick Hilarie Burton, and Hilarie got pregnant two seconds into their relationship/affair. Hilarie gave birth to JDM’s son in Spring of 2010, and she walked one red carpet with him shortly after giving birth. The whole “secret baby” thing was real – Hilarie “went into hiding” for months, and she and Jeffrey only confirmed the birth of the kid months later, and even then, Hilarie won’t even confirm the name of their son.\n\nLast night, Hilarie and JDM walked their second red carpet together within a year at the premiere of Breaking Dawn. I guess we’re supposed to think that they’re still together, then. That they’re a happy little family and that she tamed him and his wandering dong? I used to dislike Hilarie on principle, and while I still think she’s a ball of sketchiness, I grew to like her character on White Collar. Whatever, though – it’s so weird to me that Hilarie and JDM are still together, at least publicly. Weird couple.\n\nPS… How f–king good does JDM look in these photos? This man is delicious. Completely random and probably douchey about women, but he’s FINE."
