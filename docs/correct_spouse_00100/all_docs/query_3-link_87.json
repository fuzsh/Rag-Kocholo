        "text": ">\n\nAm I the only one who didn’t know that Hilarie Burton and Jeffrey Dean Morgan were dating and have a baby?!?!\n\nI haven’t heard anything about Hilarie Burton since she left One Tree Hill last year, and she’s not the biggest celebrity, but still!\n\nAccording to Just Jared, Hilarie and Jeffrey started dating in 2009, and Hilarie gave birth to a son earlier this year. I guess it wasn’t just me who didn’t know about this since they kept it under wraps and this information wasn’t announced until the beginning of May, but it’s still strange.\n\nNot only that, according to Ace Showbiz, “Burton divorced One Tree Hill assistant director Ian Prange in 2008 and Morgan discovered he was a first-time father after his actress ex Sherrie Ross revealed her son was the result of her romance with the star.” How crazy is that? And that’s not all… “Before dating Hilarie Burton, Jeffrey Dean Morgan was engaged to Mary Louise Parker but called it quits a few months later.” Poor Mary Louise! She lost the same man twice – first, he died on Weeds, and then he left her in real life, too?\n\nWhen watching One Tree Hill, my sister asked me what happened to Peyton. I told her that she and Lucas moved with their baby out of Tree Hill. Keep in mind that my sister’s really sick right now, but she said, “it would have been more interesting if Peyton had died and then Lucas killed himself because he had too much grief. Moving is too boring.”\n\nHas anyone heard anything about Chad Michael Murray and Kenzie Dalton recently? Because the last I heard, they were engaged, but that was a couple of years ago. By now, they probably have five kids and are living in Japan."
