I'm depressed. :\\\n\nP.S. Who here saw \"P.S. I LOVE YOU\"? Was it worth seeing?\n\n...No. Not even Gerry, JDM and Lisa Kudrow can save it. And you even see JDM's fine ass, heh. All three of them are great, but the plot's weird and Hilary's annoying as fuck. Snag it on DVD and just skip her scenes.\n\nYeah, I hadn't realized it'd been made official here & did the search too late to undo it. Sorry - I hate it when I post old news by accident!\n\nThanks for the review - I'd have thought Gerry and JDM could save ANYTHING. But I'll take the DVD suggestion under advisement. :)\n\nThey're both incredibly charming. And accent-y. ♥\n\nagreed. hilary was way mis-cast. JDM's naked butt is rather redeeming and seing gerard butlet shirtless/singing and stripping is awesome. OH also, harry connick jr ftw.\n\ni work at a movie theater and we had it for like 7 weeks, so i saw a LOT of it.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nGah - sorry - knew it was a rumour but didn't know it had been \"officialized\" here. :-\\\n\nOMFG DENNY.\n\nThis man's so hot. Oh my goodness I'm jealous.\n\nUgh, I hated Denny. But I like JDM. They're cute together!\n\nposted\n\nfunny you should mention billy crudup, he and jeffrey dean morgan are in watchmen together.\n\nposted?!?!?\n\nPosted quite awhile ago...\n\nlol he's barely a weeds co-star, he showed up in a home video once I think. still the fact that he plays her dead husband and they are getting married irl touches me for some odd reason. I support this!\n\ni would rather eat a tampon than see that movie again.\n\non another note, I wish Lisa Kudrow would just start doing all her roles as Valerie Cherish.\n\nI CANT GET THIS SHOE ON!!!!!!\n\nROFL at that tampon comment.\n\nlol agreed\n\n\"what's your name?!?\"\n\n\"KEVIN!\"\n\n\"Costner?...nevermind.\"\n\nP.S. I Love You was wonderful. If you've read the book it helps to think of it as a separate entity from the book because it basically is, but still good."
