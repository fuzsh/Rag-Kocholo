        "text": "Mary-Louise Parker and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, the co-stars of Weeds, have called it quits, months after reports that the couple was on shaky ground.\n\n“We’re not together anymore,” Morgan told People at Monday’s Kabluey premiere at the L.A. Film Festival in Westwood. “Everything’s fine, but it just didn’t work out. Wrong time in both our lives.”\n\nMorgan, 41, who won the hearts of millions of fans as Denny Duquette on Grey’s Anatomy, portrays the husband of Parker the Showtime series.\n\nParker has won widespread acclaim as Nancy Botwin, a housewife who starts selling drugs after Jeffrey Dean Morgan‘s character (Judah) dies.\n\nIn his personal life, Morgan, who at one point was rumored to be dating Grey’s Anatomy and Private Practice star Kate Walsh, says he has moved on, though he has not found a new girlfriend yet.\n\n“I am a single guy,” he says. “I look for somebody with a sense of humor, someone that laughs at my bad jokes, and wants to have fun in life. That’s kind of the key.”\n\nOn Grey’s Anatomy, Morgan was one of the major focal points of Season 2 as the ailing heart patient who eventually fell in love with, and became engaged to, Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl). Denny later returned in Season 3 – in the afterlife – as Meredith nearly drowned.\n\nMorgan and Parker were first seen together at a party in New York last December. On March 22 they attended opening night of the Broadway musical Curtains as a couple along with Parker’s 3-year-old son (with her ex, Billy Crudup), William.\n\nEven though Morgan and Parker are no longer dating, he may still appear opposite Parker on Weeds in more flashback scenes.\n\n“That could always pop up, you never know,” JDM says. “We’ll see.”"
