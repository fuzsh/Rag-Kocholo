        "text": "NEW YORK — Harry Potter is headed to the Great White Way.\n\nDaniel Radcliffe, the star of the \"Harry Potter\" movies, will make his Broadway debut on Sept. 5, playing the disturbed stable boy in a revival of Peter Shaffer's play \"Equus.\"\n\nRadcliffe, 18, earned rave reviews for his performance in the London production of the Tony Award-winning play. He also received loads of media attention for appearing naked onstage — a departure from his wholesome image as the bespectacled boy wizard in the big-screen adaptations of J.K. Rowling's best-selling fantasy novels.\n\n\"Equus\" begins previews Sept. 5 for a limited 22-week run at the Broadhurst Theatre that ends Feb. 8. Thea Sharrock directs.\n\nRichard Griffiths, who portrays Harry's mean Uncle Vernon in the \"Potter\" movies, reprises his London role as the psychiatrist who treats the stable boy, who has blinded six horses.\n\nis looking very 3-D\n\nNEW YORK — The Walt Disney Co. has announced it will jump on the 3-D bandwagon, vowing to release every animated movie in the format beginning with \"Up\" next year.\n\nChief creative officer John Lasseter made the announcement in New York at a presentation of Disney's upcoming lineup of animated movies from its Pixar and Disney studios.\n\nThe lineup includes \"Rapunzel,\" a retelling of a fairy tale set for release for Christmas 2010, and \"King of the Elves,\" set for release around Christmas 2012.\n\nDisney also showed a 30-minute clip of \"Wall-E,\" set for release June 27. It tells a love story between the title character, a robot left alone on earth for 700 years, and another robot named Eve sent to look for life.\n\n\"Wall-E\" is the first Pixar release since last summer's \"Ratatouille,\" which grossed more than $620 million at the worldwide box office.\n\n\"Ratatouille\" was the last independent Pixar picture in development prior to Disney's acquisition of Pixar Animation Studios in May 2006 for $7.5 billion in stock.\n\nIn a deal announced last month, four studios — Disney, News Corp.'s 20th Century Fox, Viacom Inc.'s Paramount, and Universal Pictures, which is owned by General Electric Co.'s NBC Universal — agreed to help finance and equip 10,000 screens in the U.S. and Canada to accommodate 3-D movies.\n\nThe conversion will cost as much as $700 million and take three years.\n\nBox office figures have shown that the enveloping feel of 3-D can attract two to three times more moviegoers who are willing to pay as much as $3 more per ticket, analysts said.\n\nTheater owners and studios hope the offerings will help bring people back to multiplexes for an experience that cannot be matched by increasingly sophisticated home theater systems.\n\nLOS ANGELES — Mary-Louise Parker has broken off her engagement to fellow \"Weeds\" actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan.\n\nParker, who plays an upscale suburban marijuana dealer on the Showtime comedy, ended the relationship with her actor fiance, according to a person close to the former couple. The person, who requested anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the relationship, said the couple had differing lifestyles, but that Parker holds Morgan in the highest regard and hopes they remain friends.\n\nMorgan, best known for his recurring role as Denny on \"Grey's Anatomy\" and the deceased husband of Parker's character on \"Weeds,\" began dating Parker in 2006. The pair briefly split last June but later reconciled. Parker, 43, and Morgan, 41, announced their engagement earlier this year.\n\nRepresentatives for Parker said they do not comment publicly on the personal lives of clients. A representative for Morgan said she had no comment in an e-mail to The Associated Press.\n\nIn 2003, a tabloid frenzy ignited when actor Billy Crudup left Parker while she was seven months pregnant with their son, then began dating Claire Danes. Parker and Crudup had been together since 1996.\n\nParker has previously been romantically linked to Counting Crows lead singer Adam Duritz and actor Timothy Hutton.\n\nThe fourth season of \"Weeds\" premieres June 16.\n\nThe Associated Press"
