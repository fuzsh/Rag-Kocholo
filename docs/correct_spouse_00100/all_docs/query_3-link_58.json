        "text": "CBS\n\nNew 'Walking Dead' villain Jeffrey Dean Morgan's 8 most notable roles\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" fans are excited about seeing Negan, one of the comics' most chilling villains, in the Season 6 finale. The good news is, he's played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, the versatile Seattle-born actor who can be charming and scary at the same time. In his career, Morgan has turned up in everything from \"The O.C.\" to \"Watchmen.\" Here are highlights from Morgan's jam-packed resume. -- Kristi Turnquist\n\n1. Weeds (2005)\n\nMorgan played Judah Botwin, the late husband of widow-turned-marijuana-dealer Nancy (Mary-Louise Parker, who was briefly engaged to Morgan.)\n\n2. Supernatural (2005-2007)\n\nThe show that will run forever featured Morgan in a recurring role as John Winchester, father of demon-hunting heroes Sam (Jared Padalecki) and Dean Winchester (Jensen Ackles.)\n\n3. Grey's Anatomy (2006-2009)\n\nWas there ever a more lovable heart patient than Denny Duquette? No wonder Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) fell for him.\n\n4. Watchmen (2009)\n\nEven Morgan’s skills, as Edward Blake/The Comedian, couldn’t save this misbegotten effort from director Zack Snyder, which made a hash of the source material.\n\n5. Magic City (2012-2013)\n\nThe show was uneven, but Morgan was fun to watch in this 1950s-set series about a Miami hotel owner who gets mixed up with the mob.\n\n6. Texas Rising (2015)\n\nThe miniseries about the post-Alamo battle against Mexico that gave birth to Texas was pompous and dull, but Morgan managed to stand out as Texas Ranger “Deaf” Smith.\n\n7. Extant (2015)\n\nIt was too late to save Halle Berry’s series by the time Morgan showed up as a regular in Season 2, but at least he was an improvement.\n\n8. The Good Wife (2016)\n\nThis final season of the show has steamed up considerably, thanks to Alicia (Julianna Margulies) getting her sexy on with Jason, the seductive investigator played by Morgan.\n\nGene Page/AMC\n\nThe Walking Dead"
