        "text": "For years now I have watched Mary Louise Parker get nominated award season after award season for her work on Showtime's drama Weeds. Friends and coworkers have highly recommended the show, but without access to Showtime, I had no way of viewing the program. That is until my boyfriend Netflix decided to offer the first two seasons of the show with its \"Watch Instantly\" feature.\n\nGiven the snowstorm that left me cooped up inside yesterday, I decided to snuggle up and see what all the fuss was about.\n\nNow 14 episodes in (yes, you did the math right, that's 7 hours of Weeds) I am totally hooked! The premise of the show is that widow Nancy (played by Parker) decides to sell pot to support her family in the wake of her husband's sudden death.\n\nHer husband is played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan, best known for his role as Denny Duquette on Grey's Anatomy. Apparently he likes to play ex-husbands who haunt from beyond. Not that I'm complaining, he's awfully easy on the eyes.\n\nNancy is determined and competitive while also being quirky and aloof. Its a bizarre combination that works. Her two sons, Shane and Cylis, are constantly acting out and she has her brother-in-law Andy under her roof as well. In addition to enjoying the perks of Nancy's new business, Andy has decided to enter rabbinical school in order to avoid army service.\n\nI was surprised (rather pleasantly) to see that Romany Malco from the 40 Year Old Virgin plays Conrad, one of Nancy's business partners. I loved him in that movie and he delivers again in this role.\n\nElizabeth Perkins plays Nancy's frigid, cruel neighbor Celia who hates her husband and counts her 11 year old daughter's calories. The ice running through her veins is a delicious television treat.\n\nEach episode of Weeds takes unexpected, strange turns and always ends on a cliff hanger or shocking realization. I have had the luxury of watching the episodes back to back, but if you were watching once a week, I could see how they keep you hooked!\n\nIf you have Netflix, definitely take advantage of the \"Watch Instantly\" availability of Weeds and enjoy this zany and unique drama. A stellar cast, great writing, and perfect music selection make this Showtime gem a fast favorite."
