        "text": "Stage and screen star Mary-Louise Parker is writing an autobiographical book about the “significant men in her life”, Scribner announced on Monday.\n\n“I am so honored and thrilled to be working with Scribner and in the company of such wonderful writers,” Parker said in a press release issued by the publisher.\n\nThe “autobiographical literary work of nonfiction”, titled Dear Mr You, will be written in the form of a series of letters to the significant men in Parker’s life. The book is due to be published sometime next Fall.\n\n“Mary-Louise Parker’s prose is vivid, urgent and emotionally frank,” Colin Harrison, vice-president and editor-in-chief of Scribner, said in a statement.\n\nParker, 50, won a Golden Globe for her performance as Nancy Botwin, a suburban mom turned pot dealer, in Showtime’s Weeds. She also won a Golden Globe and Emmy for HBO’s adaptation of Angels In America, as well as a Tony award for her performance in Proof.\n\n“From Frank McCourt to Jeannette Walls to Anjelica Huston, Scribner loves a great memoirist, and Mary-Louise Parker is one,” said Nan Graham, senior vice-president and publisher of Scribner in the statement. “Her writing is magnificent; the conceit – a memoir in letters to men – is wholly original and brilliantly executed.”\n\nWhile there is no word on who the letters might be addressed to, Parker has written previously about her relationship with her father and her son in a 2012 essay for Esquire.\n\n“I can’t take credit for more than remembering to point to you when I do something right and for continuing to put one foot in front of the other when I lose heart,” she wrote in the essay.\n\nParker has a son with actor Billy Crudup, perhaps best-known for his role as Russell Hammond in Almost Famous. Crudup left Parker while she was pregnant with their son, and reportedly began immediately dating Homeland actress Claire Danes.\n\nParker was later engaged to actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who played her deceased husband on Weeds, but the couple reportedly broke of the engagement after dating for more than two years. She is most recently linked to singer Charlie Mars."
