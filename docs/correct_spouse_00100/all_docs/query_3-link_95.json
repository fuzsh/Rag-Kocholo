For every Brangelina or TomKat, there’s a PeteMoss or two.\n\nWe can’t think of a good nickname for these three-named stars, but we’re still sad to report that Mary-Louise Parker and Jeffrey Dean Morgan have broken off their engagement, according to People magazine this morning.\n\nParker, who stars on Weeds, and Morgan, who plays her deceased husband on that series and also had a memorable stint as Denny on Grey’s Anatomy and several recent movie roles, announced they were engaged earlier this year.\n\nThey seemed very happy in announcing their engagement not even two months ago. This was after their two-year on-again, off-again relationship.\n\nJeffrey Dean Morgan and Mary-Louise Parker are broken up."
