        "text": "CLAIRE Danes was labelled a homewrecker for dating Billy Crudup who left his girlfriend seven-months pregnant. Now she has opened up on the affair.\n\nThe star of Homeland spoke to Howard Stern about how it unfolded back in 2003, when she was 24.\n\nCrudup and Danes had starred in the largely forgettable movie Stage Beauty and fell in love.\n\nThe only problem was that Crudup’s girlfriend of eight years, Weeds actress Mary Louise Parker, was seven months pregnant at the time with the couple’s son.\n\n“That was a scary thing,” she said. “I was just in love with him and needed to explore that and I was 24 ... I didn’t quite know what those consequences would be.”\n\n“But it’s okay, I went through it,” she said. Asked if she and Crudup were still in contact, Danes replied “We’re friendly.”\n\nDanes and Crudup split in 2006 and the next year she started dating her Evening co-star Hugh Dancy, who she married in 2009. They welcomed Cyrus in 2014.\n\nDanes had been in a relationship with Australian musician Ben Lee for six years prior to her affair with Crudup.\n\nPerhaps Danes is speaking out now to get on the offensive. Mary Louise Parker, who has never spoken of being left while heavily pregnant, is set to release a memoir entitled Dear Mr You, in which she writes letters to the “significant men in her life”.\n\nNo doubt she has a few choice words she has been saving for Crudup, and perhaps even Danes.\n\nHer Weeds co-star and Grey’s Anatomy star Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who she started dating after Crudup and to whom she was briefly engaged, is also expected to be mentioned.\n\nTo her credit, Parker doesn’t appear to be the bitter type - despite Crudup leaving her with two months to go until their baby was born, she still named the child William, after his dad."
