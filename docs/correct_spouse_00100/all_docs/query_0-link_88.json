        "text": "Book Buzz: Two celebs penning new books\n\nWeeds star Mary-Louise Parker and stage and screen actor Nathan Lane are both getting into the publishing business.\n\nParker is writing a memoir called Dear Mr. You, Scribner announced Monday. It will take the form of a series of letters addressed to the significant men in her life. Parker, 50, has been romantically linked to Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Charlie Mars, and Billy Crudup, with whom she has a son.\n\nLane, 58, is publishing a children's book called Naughty Mabel, written with his partner Devlin Elliott. It will be illustrated by Dan Krall and released by Simon & Schuster Books for Young Readers. The book will be the first in a series about Mabel, a French bulldog based on Lane and Elliott's own dog.\n\n\"It has been such a blast writing this book. Having seen the brilliant work of Dan Krall, we are more excited than ever to give Mabel a voice, or at least the voice we hear in our heads. We hope you enjoy and love her as much as we do,\" Lane said in a news release.\n\nBoth actors' books are due in the fall of 2015."
