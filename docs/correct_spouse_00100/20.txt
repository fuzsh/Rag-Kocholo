Mary-Louise Parker, 43, and that guy who plays her dead husband on Weeds, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, 41, have broken off their engagement. They confirmed their engagement in February, after having made a public appearance together at the premiere of P.S., I Love You in early December.

They were together on and off for about two years, and the last time they called their relationship off was in July of last year, with Morgan saying it was the “wrong time in both our lives.”

It seems like they just weren’t right for each other. I know I’ve been in relationships like that, where no matter how much you love and are drawn to the person there’s just some problems that are insurmountable and it doesn’t work. You keep trying and it’s like bashing your head against a wall when you think you’re running toward a tropical pool. Ah, the mirage of ill-fated love.

Parker has two children, William, 4, with her ex, Billy Crudup, and a baby girl she adopted from Africa in September of last year.
