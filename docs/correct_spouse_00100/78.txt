Mary-Louise Parker has called it quits -- again -- with her former on-screen husband Jeffrey Dean Morgan, the Associated Press reports.

Parker, who plays a pot-dealing widowed soccer mom on "Weeds," had been dating Morgan (who played her dead husband) off and on for two years, and the two were believed to be engaged earlier this year. But they've called off the wedding, according to a source close to the couple.

Parker has a son with ex-boyfriend Billy Crudup (who left her when she was seven months pregnant and took up with Claire Danes) and adopted a daughter last year. The source says the couple had differing lifestyles, and that Parker wants to stay friends.
