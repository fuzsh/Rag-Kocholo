Weeds actress Mary-Louise Parker has split with co-star Jeffrey Dean Morgan.

The couple began dating in 2006 and announced their engagement earlier this year.

A friend revealed that different lifestyles were behind the break-up, adding that Parker holds Morgan in the "highest regard" and hopes they can be friends.

The actress plays suburban housewife Nancy Botwin in the hit Showtime series, while Morgan stars as her dead husband.

Parker previously spent seven years with actor Billy Crudup, who left her when she was seven months pregnant for Claire Danes.
