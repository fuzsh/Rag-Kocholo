Mary-Louise Parker and actor Jeffrey Dean Morgan are engaged!

They have been telling friends that they’re planning to swap vows, according to the New York Daily News.

The pair began dating in 2006, but briefly split in June 2007.

They were back on as of December when Parker accompanied Jeffrey Dean Morgan to the premiere of his movie, P.S. I Love You.

She has a 4-year-old son, William, with her ex-fiance, Billy Crudup. Mary-Louise Parker also recently adopted a baby girl from Africa.

Jeffrey Dean and Mary-Louise make a cute pair.Â

Morgan, who may be best known for a memorable stint on Grey’s Anatomy, plays her dead husband on her Showtime hit series, Weeds.

Congratulations to the happy couple!
