Boyfriend: Jeffrey Dean Morgan (actor, together 2006-07, 2007-08)

Actress Mary-Louise Parker is to marry boyfriend Jeffrey Dean Morgan after rekindling their love on the set of the TV show Weeds. The couple first dated in early 2007 but broke up in June that year after a brief romance, with Morgan stating it was "the wrong time" in their lives for a relationship.

However, the stars - who play husband and wife on Weeds - reunited off-screen and made their relationship public in December, when they attended the U.S. premiere of P.S. I Love You holding hands, reports the New York Daily News.

It will be Morgan's second marriage and Parker's first. The pair has yet to set a date for their impending nuptials.
