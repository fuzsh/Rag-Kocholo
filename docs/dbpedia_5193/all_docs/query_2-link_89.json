        "text": "( Information extracted from STRÃ NG - a mesoscale model for solar radiation)\n\nThe STRÃ NG model is a solar radiation model developed by SMHI, the Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute. The STRÃ NG model estimates solar radiation at the Earths surface based on various meteorological parameters and the model has been used by SMHI and other meteorological institutes to provide estimates of solar radiation for various applications. The model covers the Nordic countries with a grid of size 630 x 779.\n\nIt is possible to extract historical data from the STRÃ NG database. The result is an ASCII file with 5 columns separated by white space containing the \"Year\", \"Month\", \"Day\", \"hour\" and the selected radiation quantity.\n\nin thenear future, access to these data will only be available via the SMHI Open Data interface. The API supports retrieving different types of radiation data that are identified as parameter.\n\nOne will need to convert the data before being able to import it in PVsyst. To import parameters from the STRÃ NG model, go to \"Database > Custom import\", and the supported parameters equivalent in PVsyst are :"
