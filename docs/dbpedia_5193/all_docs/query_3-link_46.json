        "text": "PostNord Stralfors’ business is based on a long tradition. The company Stralfors started out as a printing works in the Swedish town of Ljungby in 1919. In 1956, we started to manufacture punch cards for computers. Today at 100 years in business, we are the digitisation partner to several of the largest businesses in the Nordics.\n\nEver since we began in 1919, we have always been at the cutting edge and constantly reduced the distance between companies and their customers by delivering new communication solutions. In 1964, we started a gradual process of internationalization, and we now have our own well-established organizations in four countries.\n\nToday, progress moves faster, everything communicates everywhere, and the communication landscape is changing constantly. In such uncertain times, Stralfors stands for knowledge, tradition, and innovation.\n\nChange is nothing new for us. We have it in our genes. Since our beginning in 1919, we have successfully managed to transform at every major transformation, along with our customers.\n\nToday, the world is once again facing a paradigm shift. Digitization has created completely new prerequisites for communication, placing new demands on both consumers and businesses. We help our customers to meet the challenges of the future. We know what has to be done."
