        "text": "A model to calculate daily actual evapotranspiration from synoptic weather data has been developed using results from a forest meteorological measuring site in southern Sweden. The following submodels are included:\n\nModel for evaporation of rain water intercepted by the forest canopy. Parameters are the free throughfall coefficient and water storage capacity of the canopy.\n\nModel for transpiration from the dry forest canopy using a physiological expression for the surface resistance.\n\nUsing data from seven synoptic stations during seven warm seasons, monthly model evapotranspiration sums were compared to data estimated from the water balance. The agreement was much better than using the traditional Penman formula with synoptic data. Thus, modelling of the component forest processes gives significant improvement of the monthly values. The model can simulate evapotranspiration from synoptic weather data using prescribed values of the transpiration and interception parameters. The model can relate data of various kinds, periods or sites to each other as demonstrated."
