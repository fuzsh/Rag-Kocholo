Participation to ECA&D is open to anyone maintaining daily station data. If you want to join please contact us. See our data policy for more details.\n\nE-OBS version 29.0e has been released. E-OBS is a daily gridded observational dataset for precipitation, temperature, sea level pressure, relative humidity, wind speed and global radiation in Europe based on ECA&D information. The full dataset covers the period 1950-01-01 until 2023-12-31. It has originally been developed and updated as parts of the ENSEMBLES (EU-FP6), EURO4M (EU-FP7) and UERRA (EU-FP7) projects. Currently it is maintained and elaborated as part of the Copernicus Climate Change Services."
