The averaging process is then designed to automatically compensate for various biases that appear to be present. After the average field is constructed, it is possible to create a set of estimated bias corrections that suggest what the weather station might have reported had apparent biasing events not occurred. This breakpoint-adjusted data set provides a collection of adjusted, homogeneous station data that is recommended for users who want to avoid heterogeneities in station temperature data.\n\nIndividual Station Data\n\nComplete Station Archives:\n\nTAVG\n\nTMIN\n\nTMAX\n\nSource data consists of the raw temperature reports that form the foundation of our averaging system. Source observations are provided as originally reported and will contain many quality control and redundancy issues. Intermediate data is constructed from the source data by merging redundant records, identifying a variety of quality control problems, and creating monthly averages from daily reports when necessary. The definitive repository for Source and Intermediate data is located in the SVN, which is built nightly.\n\nThe source files we used to create the Berkeley Earth database are available in a common format.\n\nMulti-valued\n\nThis includes all time series from the originating datasets. Due to duplication with the same data being reported by multiple agencies, on average there will be 3-4 time series reports with each site. Only limited quality control flagging has been performed at this stage.\n\nTAVG\n\nTMIN\n\nTMAX\n\nSingle Valued\n\nData have been collapsed so that there is only one time series per location. Quality control procedures have been completed and their output is reported via a series of quality “flags”. Users of this data set will have to consider these flags and remove any data they don’t want to use. Seasonality is preserved in this data set.\n\nTAVG\n\nTMIN\n\nTMAX\n\nQuality Controlled\n\nSame as “Single-valued” except that all values flagged as bad via the quality control processes have been removed. This dataset is recommended for users that require relatively clean data. However, no adjustments have been made for heterogeneous and other biasing events. Please consider the breakpoint adjusted station data above if you wish to avoid heterogeneity.\n\nTAVG\n\nTMIN\n\nTMAX\n\nBerkeley Earth’s main analysis uses a variety of techniques to detect and compensate for systematic problems with the source data. For example, measurement discontinuities often occur when observing stations are moved or instrumentation is change. However, for diagnostic and pedagogical reasons it can be useful to look at averages when many of the quality control and homogenization features of the Berkeley Earth algorithm have been disabled.\n\nThese files are updated infrequently.\n\nGlobal Raw Land Only Monthly (1750 – Recent)\n\nThe following files provide time series that summarize the raw data, omitting most of the bias and error detection steps.\n\nRaw Monthly Average Temperature (raw annual summary)\n\nRaw Monthly Average High Temperature (raw annual summary)\n\nRaw Monthly Average Low Temperature (raw annual summary)\n\nRaw Land Only Monthly Gridded Fields (1750 – Recent)\n\nThe following files provide gridded land data that summarize the raw data, omitting most of the bias and error detection steps.
