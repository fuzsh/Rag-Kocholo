        "text": "Integrating raw data products â Bhutan (NCHM)\n\nCollaboration\n\nNCHM collect raw daily flow data, and store them in CSV format. Working in collaboration with the HydroSOS team, a Python notebook was created to aggregate the data to monthly means and output the flow (e.g. what flow is classified as ânormalâ or âbelow normalâ) climatology for the graph and map. The raw daily graph data can displayed along with the monthly data for comparison. HydroSOS aims to develop and share this Python notebook publically enabling National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) to calculate their own status assessments.\n\nHydroSOS integration steps"
