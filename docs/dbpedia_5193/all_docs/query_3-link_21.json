When we erase personal data, we inform other companies with whom we have shared the data that the data must be erased.\n\nRight to restrict processing\n\nIn certain circumstances, you have the right to request the restriction of your personal data, for instance, if the data are inaccurate and you have requested to have them rectified.\n\nSupervisory authority\n\nThe contact details of the supervisory authority, the Swedish Data Protection Authority (Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten):\n\nPhone: +46 (0)8-657 61 00\n\nE-mail: imy@imy.se\n\nPostal address: Integritetsskyddsmyndigheten(Swedish Data Protection Authority), Box 8114, 104 20 Stockholm, Sweden"
