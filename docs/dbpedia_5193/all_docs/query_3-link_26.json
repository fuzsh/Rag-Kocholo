Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Ljungby is essentially constant during February, remaining around 0% throughout.\n\nFor reference, on July 31, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 1% of the time, while on September 17, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 0% of the time.\n\nHumidity Comfort Levels in February in Ljungby\n\ndry 55Â°F comfortable 60Â°F humid 65Â°F muggy 70Â°F oppressive 75Â°F miserable\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Ljungby is essentially constant during February, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 6.9 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on January 24, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 7.3 miles per hour, while on August 3, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 5.7 miles per hour.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Ljungby throughout February is predominantly from the west, with a peak proportion of 36% on February 5.\n\nWater Temperature\n\nLjungby is located near a large body of water (e.g., ocean, sea, or large lake). This section reports on the wide-area average surface temperature of that water.\n\nThe average surface water temperature in Ljungby is essentially constant during February, remaining around 36Â°F throughout.\n\nThe lowest average surface water temperature during February is 35Â°F on February 19.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nThe growing season in Ljungby typically lasts for 4.6 months (142 days), from around May 11 to around September 30, rarely starting before April 20 or after June 1, and rarely ending before September 9 or after October 26.\n\nThe month of February in Ljungby is reliably fully outside of the growing season.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in February in Ljungby\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in February in LjungbyFeb112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829290%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%JanMar0%Feb 150%Feb 15frigidfreezingvery coldcold\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Ljungby are essentially constant during February, remaining around 0Â°F throughout.\n\nGrowing Degree Days in February in Ljungby\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Ljungby is gradually increasing during February, rising by 0.9 kWh, from 0.7 kWh to 1.6 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in February in Ljungby\n\nAverage Daily Incident Shortwave Solar Energy in February in LjungbyFeb112233445566778899101011111212131314141515161617171818191920202121222223232424252526262727282829290.0 kWh0.0 kWh0.5 kWh0.5 kWh1.0 kWh1.0 kWh1.5 kWh1.5 kWh2.0 kWh2.0 kWh2.5 kWh2.5 kWh3.0 kWh3.0 kWh3.5 kWh3.5 kWh4.0 kWh4.0 kWh4.5 kWh4.5 kWh5.0 kWh5.0 kWhJanMarFeb 10.7 kWhFeb 10.7 kWhFeb 291.6 kWhFeb 291.6 kWhFeb 111.0 kWhFeb 111.0 kWh\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Ljungby are 56.833 deg latitude, 13.941 deg longitude, and 466 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Ljungby contains only modest variations in elevation, with a maximum elevation change of 197 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 504 feet. Within 10 miles also contains only modest variations in elevation (269 feet). Within 50 miles contains only modest variations in elevation (1,230 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Ljungby is covered by trees (52%), artificial surfaces (38%), and cropland (11%), within 10 miles by trees (71%) and cropland (13%), and within 50 miles by trees (75%) and cropland (10%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Ljungby, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 5 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Ljungby.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Ljungby according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Ljungby is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, with weights proportional to the inverse of the distance between Ljungby and a given station.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nVÃ¤xjÃ¶ SmÃ¥land Airport (ESMX, 32%, 30 mi, east, 141 ft elevation change)\n\nHagshult (ESMV, 28%, 33 mi, north, 89 ft elevation change)\n\nHalmstad Airport (ESMT, 18%, 44 mi, west, -367 ft elevation change)\n\nLjungbyhed (ESDA, 12%, 59 mi, southwest, -325 ft elevation change)\n\nKristianstad Airport (ESMK, 10%, 63 mi, south, -390 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Ljungby and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
