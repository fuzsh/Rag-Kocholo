This allows to categorize the forecasted river flow into different conditions: above normal (>66th percentile), near normal (between 33rd and 66th percentile), below normal (<33th percentile), extreme low (<10th percentile) and extreme high (>90th percentile).\n\nBerg, P., Donnelly, C., and Gustafsson, D. (2018). Near-real-time adjusted reanalysis forcing data for hydrology, Hydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 989–1000, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-989-2018. Temperature and precipitation from the HydroGFD dataset can be ordered as customized data package – contact us!\n\nFor time periods more than ten days ahead, the meteorological models are less reliable. Monthly forecasts are therefore based on an ensemble of climate model results. Currently, we use 51 bias-adjusted ensemble members of meteorological forecasts from ECMWF.\n\nForecast skill in each catchment is given as model result vs perfect model for period 1993-2015.\n\nHistorical forecasts can be delivered as customized data package – contact us!\n\nOrder this standard package\n\nFill in this form to order the standard package for monthly data.
