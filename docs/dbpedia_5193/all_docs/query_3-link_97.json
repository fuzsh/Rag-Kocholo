        "text": "Where does the data come from?\n\nThe data is collected from tests carried out by users of the nPerf app. These are tests conducted in real conditions, directly in the field. If you'd like to get involved too, all you have to do is download the nPerf app onto your smartphone. The more data there is, the more comprehensive the maps will be! All test results are displayed on the maps. Filtering rules are applied before performance calculation for publications.\n\nHow reliable and accurate is it?\n\nTests are conducted on users' devices. Geolocation precision depends on the reception quality of the GPS signal at the time of the test. For coverage data, we only retain tests with a maximum geolocation precision of 50 meters. For download bitrates, this threshold goes up to 200 meters.\n\nHow can I get hold of raw data?\n\nAre you looking to get hold of network coverage data or nPerf tests (bitrate, latency, browsing, video streaming) in CSV format to use them however you like? No problem! Contact us for a quote."
