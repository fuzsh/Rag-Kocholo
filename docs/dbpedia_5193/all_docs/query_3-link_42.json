        "text": "Our Production Manager in Ljungby is a native of the Swedish town and started her Professional journey there with a summer job during her engineering studies.\n\nShe’s had a number of roles since officially joining the company in 2007, including Supply Chain Manager for the Ljungby factory and Logistics Manager for spare parts in the Nordic Hub. Let’s get to know more about Helena.\n\nWhat are you most proud of in your work?\n\nI have a job that is interesting and challenging and gives me a good feeling every morning. I’m also proud to be able to combine a career as a manager with an active life with my family. If you have balance in your life between work and family and feel well, you also perform in a good way.\n\nI’ve learned that it’s best not to worry about things that might happen and rather focus and put energy into things that actually occur. This is something I still have to remind myself from time to time.\n\nWhat gives you energy and keeps you passionate?\n\nI really enjoy being part of an effective team. It’s my role as a manager to establish a creative environment where my team members can perform at their best in all situations and dare to take decisions. When we talk about teamwork 1+1 is not always 2. With strong teamwork the result is most often much higher.\n\nDo you have a famous role model?\n\nPerhaps not a famous role model but at Electrolux Professional, my role model has always been Silvana Johansson, who’s Head of Category Laundry – a strong woman who always act in a professional way.\n\nDo you have a favorite quote or mantra?\n\nYou have to dare to be able to win.\n\nWhat do you think of our Guiding Principles?\n\nI like them because they help all of us in our daily work-life to become more united in how we act an collaborate with each other.\n\nMy favorite is, of course, “Be Customer Obsessed” as this is my top priority every day: to produce the machines our customers want in the right time, with the right quality and in the most efficient and sustainable way.\n\nHow have our Guiding Principles positively affected the way you work?\n\nThe actions I propose or decisions I take are made simpler to explain when they are connected to our principles. It’s easier for people to understand the logic behind the decisions and actions.\n\nThe Guiding Principles empower us to be bold, take risks, get out of our comfort zone and seek new challenges – how do you relate to this in your relatively new role of Production Manager?\n\nI have a big team to manage and, since employees are our biggest asset, the challenge is to have everybody engaged and passionate in their daily work.\n\nWe have a strong team and we now have to build for the future, attracting young, talented individuals to work in our factory so we can continue to deliver great results every year – for many years to come. For me, this is an important part of one of our Guiding Principles, to ‘Act Sustainably’."
