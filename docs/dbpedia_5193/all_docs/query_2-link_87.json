        "text": "@TomSlavkovsky @ivo I think I found radar data for Sweden. There is some other data in there you might also want to take a look at. Like: weather forecasting models, ocean information and warnings data.\n\nhttp://opendata.smhi.se/apidocs/\n\nThe University of Bonn (Germany, Rhineland Palatinate) operates a local rain radar. The range is about 120km around Bonn.\n\nThere are also no commercial interests behind it I think and they pass the data to you perhaps.\n\nhttps://www.meteo.uni-bonn.de/messdaten/radarbilder/aktuelle-bilder-1/komposit\n\nContact: Malte.Diederich@uni-bonn.de\n\nHi !\n\nIn Europe we have Opera Project under the umbrella of Eumetnet that work on an European Mosaic.\n\nYou can find the animation here: http://eumetnet.eu/activities/observations-programme/current-activities/opera-radar-animation/\n\nRegards.\n\nGabriele\n\nP.S. Sorry I did not read the introduction... you of course already know of Opera... ;)\n\nI saw that you need radar data from Portugal, the local Met Institute provides that data, but it's probably really hard to get as they provide it in the form of an image, here: http://www.ipma.pt/en/otempo/obs.radar/\n\nEDIT: Looks like they provide that data in a map form too: https://www.ipma.pt/en/otempo/obs.remote/index.jsp"
