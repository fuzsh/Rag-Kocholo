        "text": "Did you know that The Research Hub offers the opportunity to do a traineeship abroad? Our interns come from many countries and different backgrounds and we offer them opportunities to acquire new skills in various Electrolux Professional locations around the world. This provides them hands-on experience with real projects in an innovative environment.\n\nOne of our interns, Lorenzo Del Frari, joined The Research Hub in September 2018 for a master thesis on textile aging from the University of Udine in Italy. Through the European Union programme for education and training, Erasmus+, he spent the first three months of his thesis project in Ljungby, Sweden, to learn the basics about washing and to conduct a series of experiments. Back in Italy he then evaluated the collected data and samples in the material science lab at the University of Udine. “I’ve always dreamt of visiting the Nordic countries and the environmental aspect of this project motivated me even more”, Lorenzo says.\n\nFor Lorenzo the experience with The Research Hub in Sweden was mind-opening both regarding the stay in Sweden and the work in a company. “I felt very welcomed and accepted in the team and the company. Even if I was the one with the least experience I felt that my opinion was considered.” In the end, Lorenzo equipped also his professional toolbox with additional skills: “What I learned about problem solving helped me a lot in the project and still helps me every day with my current work.”\n\nAt The Research Hub, there is always the possibility to learn something new and participate in interesting projects. With a network of over 20 European universities, we every year offer internships to ten students from various countries at our facilities in Troyes in France, Ljungby in Sweden and Pordenone in Italy. Are you one of our next trainees? Contact us if you’re interested in being part of a nice and supportive community of people from all around the world!"
