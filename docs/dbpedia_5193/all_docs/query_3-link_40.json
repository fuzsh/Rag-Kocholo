        "text": "The study comprised two parts: a physical examination, including nevi count, and a questionnaire about tanning habits. The project was done in collaboration with the school health services. The study was approved by the ethical committee at the Karolinska University Hospital.\n\nTwo municipalities were chosen at latitude 65°N to 68°N in the north of Sweden (Kiruna and Piteå) and two at latitude 57°N in the south (Ljungby and Falkenberg). The coastal municipalities (Piteå and Falkenberg) have on average more sun hours than those inland (Kiruna and Ljungby). Descriptive statistics about the municipalities are shown in Table 1. Factors taken in consideration when selecting the municipalities were that the number of children of 7 years of age, income level, and unemployment rate should be as similar as possible. There should neither be a university.\n\nTable 1.\n\n. Municipality . . . . . Kiruna (inland) . Piteå (costal) . Ljungby (inland) . Falkenberg (costal) .

An invitation letter to the parents with information about the study, a written consent form for participation in the physical examination, and the questionnaire were sent in September 2001.\n\nQuestions were asked about skin reaction to sun, number of holidays spent at seaside resorts abroad, sailing and skiing, how often the child had been naked in the sun, number of sunburns, how often the child was protected, to what degree parents were fancying outdoor tanning, whether close relatives had been diagnosed with skin cancer, whether the child had been treated by a doctor for asthma, allergy, and eczema, and highest level of education of each parent.\n\nThe physical examinations took place in schools between October 2001 and March 2002 and were done by the same registered nurse throughout the study. She was trained by a dermatologist to differentiate CMN from other pigmented skin lesions. The nurse and the dermatologist both examined the same 100 children, and there was a strong agreement between their nevi counts [κ coefficient = 0.86; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.71-0.93].\n\nThe body examination excluded scalp, genitalia, buttocks, and abdomen below the umbilicus. Nevi were defined as raised or flat brown lesions ≥2 mm on the skin. The decision to not count smaller nevi was due to the problem to differentiate small nevi from freckles. The size of each nevus was measured with an overlay of Plexiglas and classified into two groups, ≥2 and <6 mm and ≥6 mm, according to an IARC protocol (15). The body surface area was divided into 16 body sites (10, 14), and totally, 84.5% of the body surface area was investigated. The nurse also assessed hair color, eye color, height, and weight.\n\nIn the statistical analysis, Poisson regression models with a generalized estimating equations approach were used (16). In the univariate analyses of number of nevi, adjustment for body surface area was done. All covariates with a P value of ≤0.10 in the univariate analyses were considered for inclusion in the multivariate model. A stepwise procedure with forward selection and backward elimination was used. The final multivariate model included covariates or interactions with P values of ≤0.05.\n\nIn total, 1,676 children resided in the municipalities in year 2001. For 1,469 (87.6%) of those, the questionnaire was filled out and 193 (11.5%) did not want to participate and 12 (0.7%) could not be traced. In the physical examination 1,380 (82.3%) participated. Children with brown or black skin were excluded from the analyses. The analysis set comprised 1,360 children who participated in the physical examination and whose parents answered the questionnaire.\n\nThe results of the univariate analyses are presented in Table 2 and final multivariate model in Table 3. Number of nevi was significantly less prevalent among children residing in the north, 5.6 (95% CI, 4.8-6.5) in Kiruna and 6.2 (95% CI, 5.3-7.2) in Piteå, in contrast to 9.5 (95% CI, 8.2-11.0) in Ljungby and 10.4 (95% CI, 8.9-12.0) in Falkenberg in the south (Table 3). The prevalence is of the same magnitude in the municipalities at the same latitude with a somewhat higher mean for the coastal region. Thus, latitude seems to have the major effect on number of nevi, whereas number of sun hours at the same latitude is of less importance.\n\nTable 2.\n\n. n . Odds ratio (95% CI) . P .

However, red hair color was associated with lower prevalence. The prevalence of nevi was lower among children with brown eye color compared with children with blue/gray/green. The number of nevi was lower for children who never had spent any holiday at a seaside resort abroad before 2 years of age and increased with number of sunburns between 2 and 4 years of age. The more the parents liked outdoor tanning, the higher was the prevalence of nevi in their child. Sunscreen use seems to increase the prevalence of nevi (Table 2). Children who never were protected with sunscreen had the lowest prevalence, 7.5 (95% CI, 5.7-9.8) in comparison with 10.7 (95% CI, 10.1-11.2) in those who often were protected. Skin types I, II, and IV had lower prevalence of nevi compared with skin type III.\n\nThe findings in this study support previous evidence that the development of CMN is related to the level of sun exposure in childhood in this study expressed as latitude of residence, holidays at seaside resort abroad, and number of sunburns. To our knowledge, this is the first study to compare number of nevi in children at different latitudes in Sweden.\n\nThe number of CMN is systematically underestimated because only those with a diameter of ≥2 mm were counted. Comparisons with other studies are therefore not always possible.\n\nThe fact that this is a population-based study implies that all individuals were identified and offered to participate in the study. The nonparticipating rate was of the same magnitude in all municipalities.\n\nFifteen percent of the children had not always lived in the actual municipality. When classifying earlier residing areas according to UV exposure, only 4% had lived in an area with a different UV radiation intensity. The results did not change when excluding these children from the analysis set.\n\nThe results support the Australian data where the prevalence of nevi in 6- to 15-year-old children increased with diminishing latitude (11). Among children at age 6 years, the arithmetic means were 23.6 at latitude 51.1°S and 45.7 at latitude 77.2°S. In a Swedish study of nevi in 8- to 9-year-old children at latitude 56°N, median number of nevi was found to be 8 (10).\n\nAn advantage of this study is that the country has a rather homogenous population. Another is that the same nurse examined all children and that the agreement with a dermatologist as regards diagnostics was high. There is therefore no reason to suspect any systematic differences in nevi count between the municipalities.\n\nWe found that prevalence of CMN was associated with previously identified risk factors for CMM [e.g., light eye color and light hair color (4, 10-12, 17)]. Red hair color seems to have a protective effect, which has been reported previously (7, 10, 11, 18-20).\n\nWe found that holidays at seaside resorts before 2 years of age were associated with higher nevi count, similar to the findings from Germany (17, 21), which supports the view that early sun exposure in childhood is of special importance.\n\nThe more the parents liked outdoor tanning, the higher was the number of nevi in their children. It can therefore be argued that the parents' habits have an effect on sun exposure of their children. This has not been reported from other studies. Thus, UV exposure could be regarded as an environmental factor in childhood and as a lifestyle factor among adults.\n\nConflicting results have been reported on the effect of sunscreens on CMN counts in children (21-24). We found that nevi increased with more frequent use of sunscreen. This effect seemed most likely to be due to undetected confounding as incomplete use of sunscreen. One explanation could be that, among those who were often protected, there was a higher proportion with lighter hair color, with non–brown eyes, who had spent holidays at seaside resorts, who burnt their skin more often, and whose parents fancied outdoor tanning.\n\nThe conflicting results according to skin type could be due to difficulties to estimate the color of the skin by the parents.\n\nWe have shown that, despite similar tanning habits, there is a marked increase in prevalence of CMN count with diminishing latitude probably due to difference in CIE-UV. The same latitude-related trend is seen in CMM incidence.\n\nTo reduce the incidence of CMM, a change in attitude and behavior must start with young children and their parents. In a long-term perspective, changes in attitude and behavior toward more favorable sun habits in both parents and children are necessary, whereas in short-term prevention the advice is to limit or avoid sun exposure and wear protective clothing in the sun. Sunscreen should only be used complementary because they could give a false sense of security. Due to the geographic difference of CIE-UV, even more prevention must be implemented in the south of Sweden."
