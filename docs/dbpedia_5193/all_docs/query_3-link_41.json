        "text": "The question of how building materials and construction techniques changed over time in the medieval stone church building was tested on a small number of churches in Scania (Swedish: Skåne) on two separate occasions in the 1980s (Sundnér 1986, 1989). The results showed chronological changes both as to what rock types was chosen, how they were cut and how the masonry was done.\n\nWhen looking at raw materials that could be used for construction it is clear that Scania represents an area of ​​ physical geographic diversity. However, it was possible to see that during the earlier middle ages primarily local rock types were chosen. Long distance transportation of building material was only done occasionally. Example of this can be seen in the first stone constructions during the 11th century with Dalby abbey and the oldest parts of the Cathedral of Lund (Löfvendahl and Sundnér 1997 Sundnér 1995, 2000, 2012).\n\nDuring the 12th century the sandstone from Höör in central Scania was used as worked stone over a wider geographic area. Primarily it was used in portals and baptismal fonts. However, from the\n\n... Show more..\n\nYou want to download Medieval churches in Scania from the SND research data catalogue.
