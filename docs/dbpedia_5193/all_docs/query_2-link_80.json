Mark my post as a solution! and hit thumbs up\n\nSubscribe and learn Power BI from these videos\n\nWebsite LinkedIn PBI User Group\n\nHi @Anonymous ,\n\nIf I understand correctly, you would like to show every row that features in your first table in both your Year and Month tables, even if they duplicate?\n\nIf so, then this isn't how Power BI works. It's designed to group/aggregate dimensions in this way to simplify and summarise visualised data. Even if you right-click on the Year/Month field in the Values section and select 'Show items with no data', it's still going to group them like this.\n\nMaybe if you could explain your output requirements/use-case in a bit more detail we could advise on the best way to get to that.\n\nPete\n\nNow accepting Kudos! If my post helped you, why not give it a thumbs-up?\n\nProud to be a Datanaut!\n\n@BA_Pete\n\nThanks, and you fully understand my intention!\n\nMy final goal is to revsie these dates (format text now and can't be directly changed) in a new column for all rows.\n\nI have used below two formulas to reach to this goal:\n\n- Revised Data 1 = DATE(SMHI[YEAR], SMHI[Month], 1)\n\n- Revsied Date 2 = DATE(LEFT(SMHI[Date],4),RIGHT(SMHI[Date],2),1)\n\nAs you see in the screenshoots in both cases I couldn't reach to my goal!\n\nI get below error in both cases:\n\nHi @Anonymous ,\n\nOk, CONVERT() won't work for calculated columns on DirectQuery, apologies.\n\nHowever, if you are planning to use these dates as dimensions, then you really should be bringing in a calendar table from your data source to use across the whole model. If you are able to adjust the source at all, you should add a column to the calendar table at source that converts dates into your 202001, 202002 periods which you can then use to relate to other tables in the model that only have this type of granularity. In Power Query, you would (assuming you already have a [Year] field in your calendar table) set the [Year] data type to Whole Number, then create the following column:\n\n= [Year] * 100 + [Month]\n\nI understand your data source won't run on Power Query, but this is just an example of how theoretically simple it would be to add this type of column to your data source calendar table.\n\nI believe that this is the correct long-term solution for this issue.\n\nPete\n\nNow accepting Kudos!

But out of curisity I have checked what you suggested as well.\n\nI used this formula \"Column = SMHI[YEAR]*100+SMHI[Month]\" (I changed both [YEAR] and [MONTH] to whole numbers and SMHI is the name of the table). Then I made two matrix. Please can you look in below screenshot? It doesn't seem right.\n\n@ehsanbh ,\n\nTry right-clicking the [Column] field in the Fields list and selecting \"Do Not Summarize\". Then, if this field shows \"Sum of [Column]\" in the Values section, right-click on it here and select \"Do Not Summarize\" again.\n\nI get the following output, but I think we're out of the reach of your initial requirements now:\n\nNow accepting Kudos! If my post helped you, why not give it a thumbs-up?\n\nProud to be a Datanaut!\n\nHello @ehsanbh ,\n\nThis conversion function is not supported for use in DirectQuery mode when used in computed columns or row-level security rules (RLS). See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/convert-function-dax https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dax/convert-function-dax\n\nYou may need to convert data to the data source or switch it to import mode.\n\nIf this post helps, then consider Accepting it as the solution to help other members find it more quickly.\n\nBest regards\n\nDedmon Dai"
