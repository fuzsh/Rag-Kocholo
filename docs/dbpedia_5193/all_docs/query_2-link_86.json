Interaction with the community is a regular feature of the IICWG meetings and continues throughout the year. The IICWG has commissioned one report outlining requirements for ice monitoring, contributed to several others and made regular representations to the space agencies and satellite operators.\n\nCo-Charis letter to Copernicus and their reply (Dec. 2022)\n\nCo-Chairs letter to NASA re: NISAR (Aug. 2016)\n\nCo-Chairs letter to ESA re: Sentinel-1 (Jul. 2016)\n\nESA Reply (Jul. 2016)\n\nLetter to ESA re: Polar Mission Concept and Statement of Requirements (Oct. 2016)\n\nLetter to the European Space Agency concerning continued operation of Envisat beyond 2013 (Apr. 2012)\n\nNOAA's Reply to Letter Regarding Ku-Band Scatterometer Data (Sep. 2011)\n\nReport on the Nordic Workshop on Radar Remote Sensing of Sea Ice (Aug. 2011)\n\nNASA's Reply to Letter Regarding Ku-Band Scatterometer Data (Aug. 2011)\n\nLetter to NASA and NOAA Regarding Continued Access to Ku-Band Scatterometer Data for Ice Monitoring (Aug. 2011)\n\nLetter to ESA Regarding Ice Monitoring Requirements for Sentinel-1 and Reply from ESA (Apr. 2011)\n\nIce Information Services: Socio-economic Benefits and Earth Observation Requirements (Nov. 2007)\n\nLetter to Group on Earth Observations (Jun. 2004)\n\nCEOS Ice Hazards Report (2002)\n\nEC-PHORS\n\nThe World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Polar and High Mountain Observations, Research, and Services activities promote and coordinate relevant programmes that are carried out in the Antarctic and Arctic regions by nations and by groups of nations. It interfaces with all WMO programmes, including the World Weather Watch and other related programmes throughout the world, meeting global needs and requirements for meteorological observations, research, and services in the polar regions. The activities are carried out under the auspices of the Executive Council Panel of Experts on Polar and High Mountain Observations, Research, and Services (EC-PHORS).\n\nEC-PORS Update July 2011 (Aug. 2011)\n\nUpdate on Key Outcomes and Initiatives of the WMO Polar Activities (Apr. 2011)\n\nTo foster cooperation with EC-PORS, the IICWG has submitted reports on its activities to each of the EC-PORS meetings:\n\nIICWG Reports to EC-PHORS-6 (Oct. 2015)\n\nIICWG Report to EC-PORS-5 (Jan. 2014)\n\nEC-PORS-5 Co-Chairs Reply re: Science Collaboration (Mar. 2014)\n\nIICWG XIV Letter to EC-PORS-5 Co-Chairs re: Science Collaboration (Jan. 2014)\n\nIICWG Report to EC-PORS-4 (Oct. 2013)\n\nIICWG XII Letter to EC-PORS-3 Co-Chairs (Sep. 2012)\n\nIICWG Report to EC-PORS-3 (Sep. 2012)\n\nIICWG Report to EC-PORS-2 (Oct. 2010)\n\nIICWG Report to EC-PORS-1 (Sep. 2009)\n\nIce Logistics Portal\n\nThe Ice Logistics Portal was initiated as an IPY Project to provide a single website where users could get ice charts from all of the ice charting services in a convenient manner. The portal is located at http://www.bsis-ice.de/IcePortal/.\n\nSeveral documents have been considered by the IICWG concerning the future of the portal:\n\nThe Ice Logistics Portal and the WMO Information System - IICWG Discussion Paper (Sep. 2010)\n\nFuture of the IPY Ice Logistics Portal (Oct. 2008)\n\nIICWG Multi-Lateral MOUs\n\nSeveral IICWG members have signed Memoranda of Agreement to formalize their cooperative working relationships:\n\nBaltic Sea Ice Services MOU (Dec. 2010)\n\nEuropean Ice Services MOU (Dec. 2010)\n\nNorth American Ice Service Collaborative Arrangement (Dec. 2010)\n\nColor Standard and Shapefile SIGRID-3 Format\n\nJun. 2004: The Color Standard and SIGRID-3 formats are now official World Meteorological Organization (WMO) standards, and may be referenced as:\n\nSIGRID-3: A Vector Archive Format for Sea Ice Charts.

This revision implements a number of recommendations to harmonize the WMO Sea Ice Nomenclature, the SIGRID-3 code, and the ENC Ice Objects. Also, a number of new objects were added to support the work of the Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute (AARI) and Transas. In February 2012, an updated draft of the Ice Objects Catalogue, Version 5.1, was released which harmonizes some terms with the WMO Sea Ice Nomenclature and the existing national practices draft. It is anticipated that version 5.1 will be formally approved later in 2012.\n\nIICWG, together with ETSI, has been collaborating with the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) to migrate the Ice Objects from S-57 to the new S-100 family of Electronic Chart Display & Information System (ECDIS) standards. Features, attributes, and enumerations from the Ice Objects Catalogue Version 5.0 have been encoded in the prototype IHO S-100 database as \"Supplemental Geographic Information\". Work remains to be done on the portrayal of ice features.\n\nFor a historical overview of ice information in electronic navigation charts see the presentation \"Ice Information for Electronic Navigation Systems\".\n\nIce Training\n\nUSNIC Training Modules\n\nThe U.S. National Ice Center (USNIC) has kindly contributed its Ice Analyst Workbook for reference by IICWG participants.

The Arctic analysis is done on the weeks during which the 1st and the 15th of the month fall. If there are two weeks between the 1st and 15th, then the Arctic analysis will be completed three times during that month. Each analysis is produced as both a black and white and color version. The black and white version depicts ice conditions using the WMO egg code. The color version is based on total concentration and also depicts WMO code eggs. The JPEG charts can encompass a whole sea (e.g.. Beaufort Sea) or part of a sea (e.g. North Greenland). The .e00 coverage is based on nominal geographic boundaries of seas. The coverages that correspond to the individual JPEG charts (e.g. Bering West, Bering East and Kamchatka) are joined together into a complete sea (e.g. Bering Sea). An ASCII text metadata file describing the imagery used in the analyses is included for the East Arctic and the West Arctic.\n\nEach week (beginning Summer 2001) a Northern Hemisphere .e00 Analysis or Southern Hemisphere .e00 analysis will be placed on the WWW site.\n\nThe Alaskan regional analysis (Beaufort, Chukchi and Bering Seas, Cook Inlet and the High Arctic West 1 and 2 areas) is completed at least once a week all year.
