This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and disclose information processed through this website, and our online subscription service (the \"Services\").\n\nThis page sets out our privacy policy and describes why and how we collect, use and disclose personal information which you choose to provide to us on our website, as well as how to access, modify, or delete your personal information. This policy doesn't apply to anyone who isn't under our control or management, such as the operators of other websites that you might link to from our website. Such operators may have their own privacy policies, which might differ from ours.\n\nHow Will We Collect Personal Information?\n\nYou are under no obligation to disclose any personal information to us at any time. We collect information you provide directly to us. For example, whenever you participate in any interactive features of the Services such as filling out a form, requesting customer support, sending us an email, or calling us. In the process you may be asked to give your name, e-mail address, mailing address, and any other information you choose to provide for the purpose of these Services. We or a designated third party may collect payment and credit card information when you subscribe to our paid Services or purchase additional services.\n\nInformation We Collect Automatically When You Use Our Services\n\nWhen you access or use our Services, we may automatically collect information about you, including:\n\nLog Information: We log information about your use of the Services, including the type of browser you use, access times, pages viewed, your IP address, your general location, and the page you visited before navigating to our Services.\n\nDevice Information: We collect information about the computer or mobile device you use to access our Services, including the hardware model, operating system and version.\n\nCookies: We use cookies to store your login session and other information to make your navigation of our Services easier.
