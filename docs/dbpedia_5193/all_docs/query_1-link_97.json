See attachments.\n\nMy PC:\n\nWorth to say - the folders exists and are shown in the project manager and in Dropbox, where they seem to be synced.\n\nAny idéas!?\n\nHave I made any settings incorrectly?\n\nBest Regards\n\nJohan\n\nYou still need a proper backup. A backup where a malware on your PC can not write to. Keeping the versions history of files is not the same as a backup.\n\nAnd backups need to be on a different drive, on a different machine, preferable in a different room in a different building.\n\nThink about when you need a backup:\n\nSomeone accidentally deleted it.\n\nMalware delets or encrypts your files.\n\nYour Drive doesn’t work anymore\n\nYour RAID manager crashes and overwrites the disk with crap.\n\nA thief steels your equipment.\n\nA fire, flood, earthquake or something like that happens.\n\n…\n\nDepending on what you are, a home user, small business or large business, you may accept that you loose your data in some of this cases. If you are a home user, after a flood the lost data is the least of your worries, if you are a business, your data maybe worth more than the building.\n\nBut a VCS, like git, doesn’t imply or require any internet (service). It doesn’t even imply more than one computer. You can use git one a local machine only.\n\nAnd a git server for your project means a server you can write to. You need to make sure your server makes regular backups to a place where it can not be overwritten by maleware. Maybe swap multiple backup HDDs so in case one is affected by malware, you can restore the data from the HDD connected before that. And for many companies, uploading stuff to the internet is not acceptable. I think the most likely scenario is that you have your own git server not on the internet. That is different for open source, but there is a lot of software that isn’t open source.\n\nThen you have to account for the risk they may no longer provide that service in the future. Or they convert it to their own VCS that isn’t backward compatible with git. Or they delete your repository because it goes against some of their guidelines. Look at what happened with Eagle as Autodesk shoot the bird. Eagle users where wise when they kept there Eagle 7.7 (Last pre-Autodesk release) installers backed up and didn’t relay on “I can always download the installer”.\n\nAnd again, this is not a place malware can not write to. If the keys are on your PC, it is not out of the question that a malware accesses GitLab and GitHub with the keys found on your PC and deletes or overwrites this changes. So this is not a proper backup.\n\nYou can create a simple, about 10-20 line long, bash scripts that searches of all git repositories on your PC, sets all branches and tags to the root commit and pushes this changes forcefully.\n\nIt is not hard. Some NAS devices have built in functionally for it.\n\nYou or your company may decide it is not worth to eliminate that risk and you can live with that possibility. But please, don’t advice people that using git or a service like GitLab or GitHub eliminates the need for a proper backup. It may does in some use cases but IMHO it doesn’t do it in most use cases."
