This presentation introduces the HYPE Data Delivery Service and highlights its potential and versatility in serving the science community and society at large.The hydrological catchment model HYPE simulates water flow and substances on their way from precipitation through soil, river and lakes to the river outlet (Lindström et al., 2010). The catchment is divided into sub basins and further into classes depending on land use, soil type and elevation. The global implementation of the Hydrological Predictions for the Environment (HYPE) model covers an area of 135 million km2, delineated to about 131 300 catchments, following river networks from source to sea (Arheimer et al, 2020). The HYPE Data Delivery Services provides results from the Global HYPE for all continental domains of the world except Antarctica. Results for the European domain are taken from the European (E-HYPE) model (Donnelly et al. 2016). The results range from historical simulations, forecasts (1-10 day, monthly, seasonal) to climate impact projections, essentially encapsulating the past, present and future. HYPE forecasts are driven by near-real-time adjusted reanalysis forcing data for hydrology (HydroGFD, Berg et al. 2018) while projections are driven by an ensemble of CMIP5 GCMs and CORDEX RCM output.While the Hypeweb service (hypbeweb.smhi.se) visualization service provides spatial Open Data and time series points of interest, the delivery service offers high volume, high availability data covering whole continental domains. Through purchased subscriptions, the delivery service meets the data needs of many users including national hydrometeorological services, hydropower industry, hydrological consultancy and re-insurance companies. The delivery service also fosters research partnerships and collaborations through data and model sharing Research Agreements. Research Agreements with academic and research-based institutions carry obligations for collaborative research and peer reviewed publications in furtherance of scientific knowledge. The Hype Data Delivery Service is a definite win-win for science serving society through data provision.Arheimer, B., Pimentel, R., Isberg, K., Crochemore, L., Andersson, J. C.
