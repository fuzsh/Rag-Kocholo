        "text": "CTC AB is the holding company of Bentone, CTC and Turboflame and we started already as a manufacturer of boilers in 1923 in Gothenburg in Sweden.\n\nBentone was founded in Ljungby in 1954 by Karl-Erick Johansson and already from the start Bentone were focusing on optimizing burners and always perform better than our competitors and our big secret was to use as little fuel as possible and create a very nice oil mist from the nozzle and create a mix of oil and air for a perfect combustion. Bentone was one of the pioneers in early combustion technology and since then we have continuously developed new technology.\n\nDuring the early years several local Swedish burner manufacturers like Goldflame and Suecia merged with Bentone and our international expansion started within 10 years from the founding of the company and new export markets like Turkey, Jordan, France, Iraq, Belgium, Thailand, India, Malaysia and the UK were introduced to the ultimate Swedish Bentone burner.\n\nUp to this date people from all over the world remembers names like Ulf Bondesson which were a relative of the founder Karl-Erick Johansson and asked for a job short after his graduation day. Most of Bentones burners from the early days were developed and introduced by Ulf and his colleague Ingvar Persson. Ingvar remained for over 50 years at Bentone and today his son Torbjörn Persson also works at Enertech AB.\n\nThis was the time when the Bentone family were first introduced and today we still live by these words. Some things still remains the same almost 70 years after the foundation of the company and sure some things have changed and export is now 96 % of the business which is very different from the start when Bentone focused most on the Swedish market. Today our burners are sold to more than 90 markets all over the world and 96 % of our volume is exported all over the world.\n\nThe person which created all these new markets all over the world is Helge Nilsson. Helge joined Bentone in 1965 and has travelled the world several times meeting new customers and introduced new burners and ideas from Benton and his career lasted for almost 40 years at Bentone before he retired as Export Sales Manager.\n\nToday with our new financial strong owner Nibe we have the perfect opportunity to continue to develop more fuel efficient and low NOx burners suitable for different markets all over the world from Brazil to France.\n\nI really feel that I have a great responsibility and a great history which I have to conserve and embrace and together with my whole export team we will continue so support and supply you, our beloved customers.\n\nInformation on personal data processing\n\nCTC AB (556060-2269) processes your personal data for purposes as described below.
