Ahlsell Ljungby offers products in the areas of Electrical, Heating, Ventilation & Plumbing, Water & Drainage, Tools & Machinery, Construction and Personal Protection, which can be picked right off the shelf. Should a product be out of stock, it is usually available for next-day pick-up. If you need advice or installation tips, we always have industry-savvy personnel standing by. We also offer garment printing. And naturally, we are happy to treat you to a cup of coffee.
