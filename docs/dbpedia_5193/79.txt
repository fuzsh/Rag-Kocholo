History

Ljungby Municipality traces its history back to the Viking Age. Vikings followed the river Lagan and lived in its vicinity, and one of the locations were in what is now Ljungby Municipality.

In the 14th century several important medieval roads went through the municipality. In that century, an inn was established, and this was to form the center of Ljungby town.

During the 19th century the area closest to Ljungby itself consisted mostly of sand without any vegetation, and the government released funds to plant trees which would tie together the sand and make it suitable for plants.
