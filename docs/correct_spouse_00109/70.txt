Vanessa Marcil Giovinazzo (ex-Brenda Barrett) and her husband, Carmine Giovinazzo, have called it quits after two years of marriage. The reason for the pending divorce, according to documents filed in the case, is irreconcilable differences.

Vanessa has requested that the court terminate its jurisdiction to award spousal support, according to E! News, who obtained copies of documents filed on August 17, 2012.
