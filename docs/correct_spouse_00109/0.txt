Giovinazzo revealed on Twitter in late 2011 that Marcil suffered at least two miscarriages during their marriage. Marcil has a son, Kassius, 10, with her ex-boyfriend and former 90210 co-star, Brian Austin Green, who is now married to Megan Fox, with whom he has another son.

Giovinazzo was Marcil's second husband. The actress was previously married to Corey Feldman for four years.
