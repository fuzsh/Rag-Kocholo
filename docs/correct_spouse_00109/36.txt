Here comes another bride: actress Vanessa Marcil wed CSI: NY actor Carmine Giovinazzo, her rep confirms to UsMagazine.com.

"They were married in New York on Sunday night with family and close friends," the rep adds.

Among the attendees: Kassius, Marcil's 8-year-old son with ex-boyfriend Brian Austin Green.

Kassius has been attending a lot of weddings lately. On June 24, he watched as his dad Green wed longtime love Megan Fox in Hawaii.

It's the second marriage for Marcil, 41, who was married to 80s star Corey Feldman from 1989 to 1993.

When Marcil (Beverly Hills 90120, Las Vegas) rejoins the cast of General Hospital next month as Brenda Barrett, she'll use her new married name, Vanessa Marcil Giovinazzo.
