Vanessa Marcil is officially divorced from CSI: NYactor Carmine Giovinazzo, TMZ.com reports.

The former 90210star initially filed for divorce, which a judge finalized this week, in August 2012 citing "irreconcilable differences" as the reason for the split.

Marcil and Giovinazzo married in 2010 and have no children together, despite trying to expand their family. Giovinazzo revealed on Twitter in late 2011 that Marcil suffered at least two miscarriages during their marriage. Marcil has a son, Kassius, 10, with her ex-boyfriend and former 90210 co-star, Brian Austin Green, who is now married to Megan Fox, with whom he has another son.

Giovinazzo was Marcil's second husband. The actress was previously married to Corey Feldman for four years.
