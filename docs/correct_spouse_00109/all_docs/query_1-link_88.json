        "text": "Brian Austin Green (aka David Silver circa 90210 days) does not care what you think about his sons’ long hair. The actor clapped back to some negative comments over his three sons’ locks after he shared a photo on Instagram on a “Target run.” In the shot, his sons Noah Shannon, seven, Bodhi Ransom, six, and Journey River, four — whom he shares with his estranged wife Megan Fox — look on from the backseat of the car, and all are sporting incredible long hair.\n\nWhile many of the comments were of the “gorgeous” and “adorable” variety, he got some keyboard warriors who just had to let their feelings about long hair on boys be known. “There’s something not right when they all look/dress like girls,” one commenter wrote. In an earlier post Green shared of his boys, another wrote, “Not trying to be mean, but I really thought they were all girls because of the long hair. Just being honest.”\n\nGreen decided to respond in a much more mature way than many of us who get unsolicited opinions or advice on our children. “I’ve read some of the comments here. I’m not saying anything is right or wrong,” he wrote. “I think some people with different opinions are attacked because opinions usually start with the words ‘I think’ or something similar. When people state opinions as facts is when arguments happen.”\n\n“The fact is my boys have and like long hair. In my opinion they are beautiful and will still be and possibly be mistaken for girls if they wore matching short and tshirt combos and had short hair. Some people like boys and men with long hair. Some people don’t. Both opinions are ok,” the actor added. Amen.\n\nGreen often shares pics of his boys and, although he is a celebrity, the fact that people feel the need to comment if they don’t agree with something is absurd. If you don’t think boys should have long hair, keep your boy’s hair short. The end. See how easy that was?\n\nGreen responded similarly several years ago when his son, Noah, wore a dress out in public when he was younger. “My son, he’s 4. I’ve heard from some people that they don’t agree with him wearing dresses,” he said at the time. “To them I say, I don’t care. He’s 4 and if he wants to wear it then he wears it.”\n\nVanessa seems...messy haha.\n\n\"A fan commented on the pic, writing, “I think you still love Brian Austin Green.”\n\nMarcil replied that she “never loved” him and was “always honest with him about that.”\n\nBrian Austin Green and Vanessa Marcil’s Bumpy Past “That was part of his anger towards me and so the reason why he fought me for so long knowing it would hurt our son & change our son forever,” she continued, referencing their long-running custody battle over Kassius. “I did however feel sorry for him. I still do. He’s a very angry/sad human being who still has too much shame to take full responsibility for his actions as a father. I consciously knew that I could work through childhood traumas through him and I have. I have great empathy towards him and other people who are still in pain from their childhoods.”\n\nIf you never loved him, why were you with him for years and had a kid with him?\n\nKassius post R29 is very sweet. He doesn't know he's being sweet or looking goofy. Seems like a great kid. Nice.\n\n[quote] I think Bruce and Demi and all the Baldwins had really strong jaws and chins which didn't feature well on their daughters. So rugged handsome men tend to have a lower shot.\n\n^ this idiot. So what - are straight married people so foreign to you that you suggest they shouldn't reproduce? People who've lived too long on the internet \"commenting\" are much sadder than they realize. Bruce and Demi's oldest is in her thirties. Should they go back and abort her just so you don't get too much enjoyment from commenting on her unfortunate looks R13? What a moron you are.\n\nBrian Austin Green's response is lovely. It's not a publicity release - just a non jaded guy sharing his non angry feeling about his boys. It's all good. Good dad, sweet kids.\n\nSome elder gay men on DL are palpably angry and jealous that they weren't so accepted when they were younger - so like R13, they judge the appearance of celebrities children? It's very weird. But prevalent here. This is what therapy is for. Don't pick on people's children or start saying what facial features should procreate with other facial features. If gay men could get pregnant - most would be murderers.\n\nBAG and Megan have good intentions but I feel they lack common sense and adult/world experience due to being in the entertainment industry at such young ages. I do agree we shouldn't force gender roles onto children and if they want to wear a dress or play with trucks who cares. But it is odd to make that announcement that announcement publicly that they \"gender nonconforming\"/\"gender neutral\" and even odder when some parents tell their child that they are neither male or female. It would be more progressive to tell your sons that, \"you can be boys and have long hair and wear dresses and that doesn't make you any less\". I just feel like adults are putting complex ideas into children's heads that they aren't even thinking about. Children just do whatever they want to do and aren't debating about gender in their heads.\n\n[quote]What on earth is the point of parents if kids just make the rules and get whatever they want? Why must the hot ones always be so stupid?\n\nSpeaking of stupid.... Nowhere does Brian say that the kid gets to \"just make the rules and get whatever they want.\" He said that his 4-year-old kid gets to wear a dress that he likes to wear. You were the one who tried to turn it into something that it clearly is not, which means that your post told us all about you and nothing at all about Brian Austin Green.\n\nBetter to be thought a fool than to continue to post here and prove it."
