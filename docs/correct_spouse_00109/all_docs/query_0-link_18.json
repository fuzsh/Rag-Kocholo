        "text": "Santa Barbara is celebrating its 40th anniversary this month. The soap opera that premiered back on July 30,1984 and was canceled after nine seasons, remains an all-time favorite for television fans around the globe.\n\nTwo of its most popular stars, Lane Davies (ex-Mason) and Nancy Lee Grahn (ex-Julia), chatted live on the Michael Fairman Channel, were they reminisced about the ups and downs of their on-screen and off-screen relationship during their time as a soap supercouple, and getting the opportunity not once, but twice, to act with each other on General Hospital – most recently in scenes as Fergus Byrne and Alexis Davis.\n\nLane and Nancy participated in the livestream event ahead of the upcoming Santa Barbara 40th reunion event that will bring together cast and creatives on Friday night, August 2nd in Burbank, California. Participants include: A Martinez, Marcy Walker, Robin Mattson, Judith McConnell and more. The gathering will also serve to honor the late, great Santa Barbara co-creator, Bridget Dobson who passed away at the age of 85, as well as offer up a meet and greet opportunity.\n\nOn Santa Barbara, Mason and Julia certainly had a combustible and passionate relationship. Grahn shared of the pairing, “The setup for us was really fun. It was classic in that he was a conservative. Julia was a liberal. She wanted a baby. She was a single mother. At that time, that was 40 years ago, she employed him to get impregnated.”\n\nBack in the hey day of Santa Barbara, Nancy recalled, “It took the characters a really long time for us to get together. They did journeys back then. Now (on soaps), it’s quicker. Now, I’m not comparing us by any means to Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn, but it was the classic, these two are going to fight all the time, and be incredibly attracted to one another.”\n\nDavies added, “I think it was kind of accidental and kind of manipulated by Nancy and myself, at least the way I remember it. We were both in storylines that we didn’t really love and they were putting us together for these little banter scenes. We liked the chemistry. So, we started just kind of punching up the chemistry and the writers picked up on that and we just ran with it.”\n\nIt is no question to Nancy, that one of her all-time favorite roles was Julia Wainwright Capwell. “I loved playing Julia. I loved what it brought out in me and what it taught me, and how it changed me and grew me,” she shared. However, when Santa Barbara was canceled, Nancy was still with the soap, and she recalled where the state of the show was at at that time, “The writing and the heads of the show changed pretty significantly toward the end. There were changes that happened. I felt complete when it ended, but I was scared to be out there again. You get used to that very nice steady work and paycheck.”\n\nIt was after Santa Barbara was canceled, that Nancy began her journey to Port Charles, “I called General Hospital. It was Wendy Riche at the time (as EP) and Michele Val Jean (writer) who’s now created The Gates. She was a beautiful writer on Santa Barbara. I said (to her), ‘So I wanna have a baby, anybody interested in me in General Hospital?’ She called Wendy Riche, and they said, ‘Come on over.’ So, that’s what happened.”\n\nAs for Lane, he left Santa Barbara earlier on during its run and explained his reasons for his departure. “I left before it was over. I’d done the show for five years.I, I did it as much for my own mental health as anything else. I was kind of at the end of my rope just in terms of burnout, and either Nancy would be dead or I would be in jail, or both if I’d stayed on the show because we were about to kill each other. Not really. By that point, we were getting along again.” Grahn replied to Davies, “I could easily not talk to you all day long and then act with you. I loved acting with you.”\n\nOne of the major plot point issues where Nancy and Lane reached an impasse, was when they both shared different core views for Julia and Mason. Grahn explained, “My character (Julia) spent way too much time after a certain point just wanting to marry Mason, or putting up with him, or making excuses for him. He wanted to be this manly guy just sort of galavanting about town. Lane thought if Mason got married, and was a father to a baby, it would make him weak. This was a thing with our characters and what we were arguing for. And finally I said, ‘I’m not doing this anymore because I am representing women out there, and they cannot see this. They have to see Julia either move on, or there has to be some sort of meeting of the minds, and some equality in this male/female relationship.”\n\nNancy added, “Lane did not want his character to get married or become domestcized because he thought it would make him uninteresting. We fought about that to the point where we didn’t speak to each other for eight months.” Lane shared, “That was the biggest problem I had. I went from a guy who would change his stepmother’s pregnancy test so that she would sleep with him, to a guy that was folding diapers. I thought, ‘I’m never gonna keep my demographic folding diapers!”‘\n\nLane and Nancy also had differing opinions on the Sonny Sprocket storyline, where after Mason was presumed dead, he developed an alternate personality who was a sort of cowboy. “It was fun. I don’t think I ever was quite as country as Sonny Sprocket. He was so much looser than Mason that he was fun to play, Davies explained. However, Grahn added, “He looked exactly like Mason. He sounds exactly like Mason. And I’m supposed to not believe that’s Mason?”\n\nBack in May of 2024, Nancy and Lane got to reconnect and share scenes together on General Hospital, when during Alexis’ hearing to get her law license reinstated, her opposing counsel turned out to be Fergus Byrne, the brother of Alexis’ late lover, Neil Byrne.\n\nThe two previously worked together on the ABC soap opera back in 2002-2004, when Davies played Cameron Lewis. Now with a new character on GH, Nancy explained how it came about, and if Fergus could return in the future.\n\nNancy shared, “I wanted to recreate Mason and Julia as senior citizens. It was such a satisfying acting experience for me. I also know he (Lane) can give as good as he gets. So you want a (scene) partner that will poke you a little bit, so that’s the fun of it.”\n\nAs far as if there is a chance for Fergus to come back to the GH canvas, Nancy added, “I love working with Lane, so I’d be thrilled. I don’t know what they’re going to do. I also think Patrick Mulcahey who wrote most of the Mason and Julia stuff, was at General Hospital briefly. I think that was his idea to bring Lane on. He knew that he could count on Lane to do this thing that was very demanding because it was tremendous amounts of dialogue in just a few days. I think we did six shows in three days. So, he needed someone that he knew could count on. I think if Patrick had stayed on General Hospital, there was probably more room and opportunity for that. I don’t know about now though. I mean, we’ll see.”\n\nWatch the full conversation with Lane and Nancy below.\n\nNow let us know what were your favorite Santa Barbara moments of Mason and Julia? Do you hope GH brings back Lane as Fergus Byrne? Share your thoughts in the comment section below.\n\nFriday’s July 19th episode of General Hospital had Laura (Genie Francis) visiting her daughter Lulu who is still laying in a coma. Dante (Dominic Zamprogna) also happened to stop by to see his beloved ex-wife at the same time.\n\nThe scenes brought with it more questions for the ABC daytime drama series. Are they setting up the moment many have been waiting for? Will Lulu wake up out of her coma and be reunited with her mother, her returning to Port Charles brother, Lucky Spencer (Jonathan Jackson), and finally be able to tell Dante her true feelings for him, which, in turn. would cause drama in Sam (Kelly Monaco) and Dante’s relationship?\n\nThe flip side would be if these scenes were just meant as a way for GH to remind viewers that in story they know Lulu is still lingering in a coma and not forgotten. If Lulu were to awaken, it could also bring Charlotte (Scarlett Fernandez) back to Port Charles with a parent, if her father, Valentin Cassadine (James Patrick Stuart) is truly written-off the canvas.\n\nIf you recall, it was back in November of 2020 that Lulu suffered a traumatic brain injury after a bomb explosion went off and killed her beau, Dustin (Mark Lawson). At the time of the explosion, Dustin was actually about to pop the question over dinner at the Floating Rib when the bomb went off! Lulu seemed okay, but collapsed as she was trying to confess her true feeling for Dante.\n\nIn the present day, Laura sits with Lulu and tells her about Charlotte and Rocco (Finn Carr). Laura says that Lulu’s children are growing up fast, and she’d be proud of who they have become. Laura gets an emotional and says she really misses her daughter a lot and could really use her as a sounding board. As Laura laments how much she needs her thoughtful, sweet, perceptive daughter more than ever, Dante shows up.\n\nLaura and Dante talk about how it is for Kevin (Jon Lindstrom) and Laura to raise Ace, and how it would be so meaningful to Laura, if one day Lulu would be able to wake up and meet her little nephew. Next, Dante takes Lulu’s hand and says he prays daily for her to wake up. The two reminisce over things Laura would say or do with Lulu when she was growing up proving that she was the best mother.\n\nDante shares that he was going to bring Rocco to visit Lulu today, but he had plans to see a baseball game. Laura asks how often Rocco visits. Dante says that it is getting harder and harder for Rocco to visit his mom. He tells Laura he is worried Rocco coming to see Lulu might be doing more harm than good. Offering up her sage advice, Laura suggests that since Rocco is at an age where he knows what feels right, Dante should leave that decision up to Rocco.\n\nSo, what are your thoughts GH fans? Will GH finally wake up Lulu? If so, who do you think will play the part? If they don’t wake up Lulu, what do you think was the point of the touching scenes between Laura and Dante? Share your theories via the comment section below.\n\nComing up on the Friday, July 19th episode of General Hospital, Trina’s (Tabyana Ali) grief and survivor’s guilt over life without Spencer (formerly Nicholas Chavez) comes to the forefront and it’s going to be an emotional ride for Sprina fans.\n\nThe question also becomes, how soon is too soon for Trina to have a new relationship when she had such a magical connection to Spencer, and all that they had gone through and endured to finally be together.\n\nSpeaking with Soap Opera Digest, Ali shared her thoughts on Trina’s state of mind, where she is in the grieving process and how she feels about how quickly GH should rush her into a post-Spencer relationship.\n\nTabyana expressed, “I think the show should take its time with this.,” adding on Spencer and Trina’s love, “They were very rooted. They were soulmates. So you can’t rush something like that, you can’t just get over it quickly. This is something that builds and it takes time to get over, to visually see your soulmate die.”\n\nEven personally for herself, Ali shared, “I feel like I would need so many years to get over that. I wouldn’t even probably entertain the thought of being with anybody else for a minute. Especially because it’s not like, ‘Spencer was a bad guy, he did bad things to me and so it’s easy to move on from.’ No. They worked up to the relationship they had and as soon as she had him, she lost him, in the peak of their love. I feel like that would take a lot of time to get over.”\n\nIn story, Trina becomes emotionally triggered when Josslyn presents her with the turtle dove that had such deep meaning to her relationship with Spencer, that had fell during the young women’s recent apartment move. Ali says, “There is an immense amount of guilt behind that, where it’s like, ‘How can I even live day to day knowing that you sacrificed yourself, and now you don’t get to do all the things I get to do in my day to day life?’ She’s trying to move on, but there are all these little things that keep popping up that remind her of Spencer and it’s like a rock going through a glass window.”\n\nSo, do you want GH to take their time and not rush a new relationship for Trina? Do you think she will end up with Gio? Do you think the show might recast Spencer and he comes back alive with a new face? Share your thoughts via the comment section below."
