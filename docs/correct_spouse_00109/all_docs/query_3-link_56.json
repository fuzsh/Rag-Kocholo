Their separation was finalized in 2013.\n\nIt was stated that when Corey was in the height of his career, Vanessa accepted that she was married to him for two years. However, when Vanessa’s career arose and Corey’s career got stagnant, she said that she did not marry him and he was just a person she knew for a very short time. However, they got married and stayed as partner for two years. They did not move in together during these two years.\n\nVanessa broke up with Green, a little after their son was born. Later in 2012, he filed a case on his former girlfriend that Marcil owes him 200 thousand dollars in 2000. Judge ruled against Marcil and informed that Marcil could sue him for the frivolous lawsuit.\n\nThere are rumors about Marcil being a lesbian.

There are a few sources that confirm that Jillian dated Marcil for a small period of time, just before her wedding with her former husband,Carmine Giovinazzo. The other sources refer their relationship as a trainer-trainee bonding that Marcil took up to look fit for her wedding. There were a lot of pictures of the two ladies holding hands and kissing in the public. When asked, they said that they both are best friends.\n\nMarcil has a long boyfriend list, including Nathan Fillion, Vince Neil, Antonio Sabato Jr, Corey, Green, Tob Camilletti, Jeremy Piven and Ben Younger.
