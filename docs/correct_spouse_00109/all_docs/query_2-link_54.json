She also petitioned the courts to order Giovinazzo to pay her (http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/vanessa-marcil-files-to-divorce-carmine-giovinazzo-after-two-years-2012228) legal fees , as well as spousal support.\n\nLike most couples arriving in Splitsville, Marcil and Giovinazzo focused on the important things during the divorce proceedingsasuch as dividing up their fleet of high-end vehicles. (http://www.tmz.com/2013/03/18/90210-vanessa-marcil-divorce-final-dui-carmine-giovinazzo/) According to TMZ , Marcil will receive 2009 Chevy Silverado, while Giovinazzo will go home with \"a 2002 Mercedes CLK, his 2006 Harley, his 2010 Triumph motorcycle, the 1969 Pontiac GTO, 2009 Ducati, 2011 Chevy Camaro ... plus a bunch of bank accounts and other boring stuff.\"\n\nMarcil will also retain the couple's property in Los Angeles and the rights to her baby clothes company, called \"Baby Gagoo.\"\n\nThe divorce is just the latest in a stream of bad news for the man who plays Danny Messer on \"CSI: NY.\" In January, the high-profile actor was (http://www.digitalspy.com/celebrity/news/a466549/beverly-hills-90210-star-vanessa-marcil-finalises-divorce.html) arrested in Arizona after being caught driving with a blood alcohol content of .149, amounting to nearly twice the state's legal limit. Giovinazzo reportedly blamed his swerving on his struggles with a GPS device before admitting to tossing back some scotch.\n\nOn the plus side, TMZ reported that the (http://www.tmz.com/2013/01/30/csi-ny-dui-carmine-giovinazzo-danny-messer/) arresting officers said that Giovinazzo was \"one of the nicest people they've ever arrested,\" apparently embracing the notion of backhanded compliments in the process.\n\nVanessa Marcil, on the other hand, has now had the misfortune of going through divorce proceedings for a second time. She was previously married 1980s legend Corey Feldman in 1989, before calling it quits in 1993. She also has a 10-year-old child with \"90210\" co-star and current Mr. Megan Fox, Brian Austin Green."
