Superior Court, citing, “Irreconcilable differences.”\n\nVanessa and Carmine were married in 2010, and is asking Carmine to pay her attorney’s fees. She’s also asking the court to award her spousal support. Vanessa Marcil Giovinazzo had a child, Kassius in 2002 from her previous marriage to 90210’s Brian Austin Green.\n\nOn-Air On-Soaps hopes thing work out for Vanessa!\n\nUp Next\n\nY&R's Greg Rikaart On His Stance on Chick-fil-A Controversy & Melissa Reeves, plus Kevin's Latest Crime!\n\nDon't Miss\n\nIs Christel Khalil OUT at The Young and the Restless?\n\nYou may like\n\nRick Hearst Returning to General Hospital as Ric Lansing\n\nGENERAL HOSPITAL: Tracy and Sonny Lament Over Luke on His Birthday; Cates Makes a Play for Ava\n\nPerez Hilton Welcomes Blaze and Kristina to His ‘Talk Show’ on General Hospital\n\nGENERAL HOSPITAL Preview: Cates is on Everyone’s Bad Side; Will He Be Eliminated?\n\n(EXCLUSIVE) Cameron Mathison Shares Sentiments on the Loss of All My Children Leading Lady, Esta TerBlanche, “She Was Just a Beautiful Soul”\n\nLane Davies and Nancy Lee Grahn Talk Stories They Loved (and Hated) as ‘Santa Barbara’s’ Mason & Julia, and Reuniting on General Hospital\n\nBreaking News\n\nRick Hearst Returning to General Hospital as Ric Lansing\n\nBy\n\nLook who’s returning to General Hospital? None other than three-time Daytime Emmy-winner Rick Hearst reprising his signature role as Ric Lansing.\n\nHearst will be back on your screens beginning the week of August 19th. As GH fans know, Ric is the half-brother of Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) and the two have no love lost between them over the years.\n\nRick told TV Insider on his return to the soap, “It’s been very much on my periphery and not in my consciousness for eight years.” He added, “The last time I was there was 2016.”\n\nThe talented actor shared that he received a message from GH casting director, Mark Teschner on his various social platforms which said, “Call me.” Rick knew something was up if Teschner came calling, adding, “I love that he would reach out to me, that’s awfully intense. Something’s up.”\n\nTeschner filled him in the storyline with Ric’s daughter, Molly Lansing (Kristen Vaganos) and the surrogacy storyline, to which Hearst he looked at it as, “Daddy’s home and here to take care of his daughter and anything that entails.”\n\nNow being filled-in that Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) and Sonny’s daughter, Kristina (Kate Mansi) is carrying the baby for Molly and TJ, Hearst predicts, “I have a feeling there’s going to be some friction by virtue of the fact that one daughter is parented by Alexis and Sonny, and the other daughter is parented by Alexis and Ric. That alone is enough to create a mad amount of drama of who’s going to side with who. And it’s going to be entertaining.”\n\nRick begins his latest GH run next week on July 29th when he starts filming all-new episodes of the soap opera. The actor gave praise to the iconic daytime drama series for remembering its veteran characters. Hearst said, “It’s very gratifying that they still find relevance in my generation of actor who’s been there and gone through it and is still able to tell story.”\n\nFollowing the reveal of his return, Hearst took to his Instagram with a video message confirming the news and wrote, “Very excited to announce my return to General Hospital in the role of Ric Lansing. Stay tuned. You never know what you’re gonna get with this guy.”\n\nPreviously, Hearst appeared as Ric from 2002-09 run, and returned for a subsequent run from 2014-2016.\n\nSo, what do you think about the news of Rick Hearst coming home to GH to stir up trouble as Ric Lansing? Share your thoughts in the comment section below.\n\nGeneral Hospital\n\nGENERAL HOSPITAL: Tracy and Sonny Lament Over Luke on His Birthday; Cates Makes a Play for Ava\n\nBy\n\nYou can’t get any better than Jane Elliot, and on her most recent return to General Hospital, she has been given touching scenes that show us the heart of Tracy Quartermaine against the stuff outward veneer of hers.\n\nNow on Tuesday’s July 23rd episode of the ABC daytime drama series, Tracy is sorrowful as it is Luke’s birthday and for as we know in story, Luke is presumed dead.\n\nTracy talks to her son, Ned (Wally Kurth), who knows it is Luke’s birthday and comes to comfort his mother who is in the stables. She admits to Ned that without Luke, she feels like she’s barely keeping her head above water. Eventually, Ned gives Tracy a warm embrace and she thanks him for being her sounding board during this difficult time.\n\nLater, Tracy runs into Sonny (Maurice Benard) on the street looking in the direction of where Luke’s club used to be. As they mourn look on his birthday, Tracy remembers how Luke made up his mind at a young age to take advantage opportunities that came his way. That through Luke’s harrowing past, he found some happiness. Sonny recalls his final goodbye with Luke on the docks of Port Charles, before Luke left for Amsterdam. The two agree that Luke was the all-time best.\n\nElsewhere, Cates (Adam J. Harrington) is showing his true disdain for Sonny, as he is obsessed on bringing him to justice and putting him behind bars. Cates is still holding a deep grudge for what happened to Karen Wexler and for his brother, Stone.\n\nCates comes to see Ava (Maura West). He wants information on Sonny’s criminal activities. If she wants his help with getting custody of Avery, he needs hers help in return. Ava explains she’s in a delicate situation and if she helps put Sonny away something could happen to her. Cates promises Ava that she won’t lose Avery. Next, the two share a kiss. However, its interrupted by an important call for Cates.\n\nMeanwhile, Carly (Laura Wright), Jason (Steve Burton), Sonny (Maurice Benard), Anna (Finola Hughes) and more have had it up to here with Cates manipulations and what’s its done to their lives.\n\nSo, what did you think about Tracy remembering Luke on his birthday? Do you enjoy the performances of Jane Elliot as much as we do? Do you think Cates and Ava will end up hitting the sheets and taking down Sonny together?

In addition, to the label dropping her, Blaze had to step down as the new face of Deception.\n\nPreviously, it was noted that Perez was coming to GH, but the details of the story he was involved with was kept under wraps. Now, he will be trying to get some good dirt out of Blaze and Kristina as the two chose to give a joint interview to Hilton.\n\nTaking to his Instagram to preview his big day in Port Charles, Hilton wrote, “On Wednesdays we wear pink and Perez Hilton takes over GH!” He added, “No one is safe!”\n\nIn addition, Hilton posted a video on his Blog yesterday, saying “I’m Going to Be on General Hospital, Tomorrow.” It is there he explained how nervous he was learning 30 pages of dialog for his scenes.\n\nMeanwhile, Kate Mansi shared a photo of the Perez Hilton talk show set, the GH set designers made for the scenes, on X, expressing, “Our team and set designer KILLED it for this #perezhilton set!”\n\nLooking forward to seeing and hearing what Blaze and Kristina have to say to Perez on today’s GH?
