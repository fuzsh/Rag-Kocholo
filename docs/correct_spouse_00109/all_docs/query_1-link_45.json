        "text": "If there was an award for the most pleasant DUI arrest, Carmine Giovinazzo would win it.\n\nThe “CSI: NY” star was pulled over in the wee hours of January 21 in Scottsdale, Arizona, after cops witnessed his Jeep Wrangler swerving all over the road. And once they approached the driver’s side window, Giovinazzo could not have been more polite and apologetic, according to the police report.\n\nThe 39-year-old – who had blood shot eyes, was slurring his words, and whose shirt was half-untucked –explained that he had indeed downed a scotch at a nearby W Hotel and was swerving only because he was not a local and “was lost and using his GPS,” says the report. His blood-alcohol level came in at .119, more than the legal limit of .08.\n\nWhile being transported to jail, Giovinazzo “repeatedly apologized and told me he didn’t want to be an a**hole,” wrote the arresting officer, adding that the actor “thanked me many times for not treating him like a criminal and showing him respect. Carmine was very polite and cooperative with me throughout the investigation.”\n\nHe apparently was a really nice guy before his arrest, too. Just hours prior, Giovinazzo, who split from Vanessa Marcil in August after two years of marriage, tweeted, “Wishing everyone a great Sunday and if you are off Monday, enjoy your day!” (If only the same could have been said for him.)\n\nOne thing is for sure – Giovinazzo could certainly serve as a model for other celebs who have been arrested for similar offenses, most notably Jason London, who defecated in his pants while sitting in the back of a squad car … also in Scottsdale, Arizona. \"I f**king love this,\" the “Dazed and Confused” actor told police on January 28. \"I f**king own you guys so hard. I'm rich and I'm a mother**king famous actor! F**king look me up, b***h.\"\n\nThen there is Mel Gibson, who was arrested for DUI in Malibu in July 2006. After trying to run from police along the Pacific Coast Highway, he went on an anti-Semitic tirade and even referred to one of the female officers as “sugar t**s.” The actor, who’s well known for his temper and foul mouth, also threatened the arresting deputy, saying “You’re a mother**ker. I’m going to f**k you.”\n\nThis past August, country singer Randy Travis actually threatened to shoot and kill Texas troopers who were arresting him after he was found lying drunk (and, um, naked) in a roadway beside his crashed car.\n\n“Iron Chef” Cat Cora got belligerent … with onlookers … in June when she was arrested for DUI in Santa Barbara, California, following a car accident. As the other vehicle’s passengers began videotaping her, she called them “nerds” with no life.\n\nMore Celebrity Features on Yahoo!:\n\nDan Marino Admits Fathering Child With Mistress\n\nBeyonce Sings Live at Super Bowl Press Conference, Explains Inauguration\n\nOprah Winfrey Injured by Birthday Gift From Tyler Perry"
