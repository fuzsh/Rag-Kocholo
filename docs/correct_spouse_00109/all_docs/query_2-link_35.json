She just wanted to use his name professionally. The event thought to be their wedding was just a party leading up to their big day.\n\nOriginally posted July 12:\n\nIf you watched the Daytime Emmy Awards a couple of weeks ago, you might have heard General Hospital‘s Vanessa Marcil get introduced with an addition to her last name. No, it wasn’t a blooper, as the actress, who portrays the soon to be returning Brenda, recently got married.\n\nThere aren’t many details on her nuptials, just that she married Carmine Giovinazzo, who plays Danny on “CSI: NY.”"
