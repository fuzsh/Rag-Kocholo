        "text": "General Hospital star Vanessa Marcil is someone who is best known for her role as Brenda Barrett on the hit ABC soap. She was also known for her role as Gina Kincaid on Beverly Hills, 90210. But if there’s anything that the actress is really known for, it’s her ugly feud with her ex, Brian Austin Green. Together, they share a son named Kassius. But their co-parenting journey hasn’t been easy over the years. Not only that, but Vanessa has also had a lot of dramatic relationships, too. Here are just a few tragic details about the life of Vanessa Marcil.\n\nGeneral Hospital: Tragic Details About Vanessa Marcil\n\nVanessa was first married to actor Corey Feldman back in 1989. However, she insists that they were never married and that they were only ‘friends.’ But records from the state of Nevada prove that they were husband and wife and that they also pulled the plug on their marriage by 1993.\n\nBrian Ausitn Green also proposed to Vanessa during the summer of 2001. She gave birth to Kassius by 2002 and by 2003 they were over. In addition, Vanessa was also engaged to her former General Hospital co-star, Tyler Christopher. In 2010, Vanessa married Carmine Giovinazzo. Unfortunately, their marriage only lasted two years.\n\nBut it’s Vanessa’s relationship with Brian Austin Green that has gotten her a lot of attention, but for all of the wrong reasons. In 2020, she called her ex “a very angry/sad human being who still has too much shame to take full responsibility for his actions as a father.”\n\nGeneral Hospital: Vanessa’s Feud With Brian Austin Green\n\nBrian, for his part, shot back by saying, “I can’t tell you all how frustrating it is to read continued lies from a 50+ year old woman on social media like she is still in high school.”\n\nBrian even accused Vanessa of keeping their son away from him during his health battle. His new partner Shana Burgess even spoke for him when she said, “Those years that he wasn’t able to go see Kassius, Vanessa made no effort to make sure Brian got time with him. Instead, she painted him as an absent father who chose not to be around for him. And I’m sure that information was fed to Kass, and I can’t imagine how damaging that was for him.”\n\nBrian also explained, “To then find out after the fact that at the point when I started getting better, that she then was painting it that I had abandoned Kass during that time, when the reality was I was dealing with such brain fog in what I was going through.”\n\nVanessa, for her part, has made no additional comments about the matter.\n\nTell us, what do you think of this story?
