The actress uploaded various magazine articles, red carpet photos and personal pictures via her Instagram Story, with one post captioned, “Tyler Christopher Baker: 1972 – 2023.”\n\nShe also reposted Amber Tamblyn’s Threads post, where she honored Christopher and praised him as an actor, writing, “This is crushing news. Tyler Christopher was a generous scene partner who was always respectful and wonderful on screen and off.” (Tamblyn, 40, played Emily Quartermaine on the ABC series from 1998 to 2000.)\n\nMarcil and Christoper dated in the late 1990s after meeting on the set of General Hospital where they portrayed Brenda Barrett and Nikolas Cassadine, respectively. They were briefly engaged before calling it quits in 1999. While Marcil exited the show in 1998, Christopher remained in his role until 2016, earning four Daytime Emmy nominations throughout his run.\n\nRelated: Celebrity Deaths in 2023: Stars We’ve Lost\n\nAfter losing beloved stars including Barbara Walters, Kirstie Alley and Stephen “tWitch” Boss in the final days of 2022, the entertainment industry continued to deal with loss in 2023.

The pair were together for four years and welcomed son Kassius Lijah Marcil-Green in 2002. After their 2003 split, Marcil tied the knot with Carmine Giovinazzo in 2010, but they called it quits three years later.\n\nChristopher, meanwhile, went on to wed Eva Longoria in 2002. They were married for two years but split in 2004. He later tied the knot with Brienne Pedigo in 2008 and the duo share two kids: Greysun, 14, and Boheme, 8. They divorced in 2021.\n\nChristopher died on Tuesday, October 31, at his San Diego apartment at the age of 50. His General Hospital costar Maurice Benard announced the news, sharing that he passed away after suffering a “cardiac event.”\n\nRelated: Soap Stars Who Dated Offscreen\n\nLove on — and off — screen.
