I think he was also married to Eva Longoria??..Can someone help me out here? My sister and I have a bet. I told her that Nik was once married to both Eva and Vanessa and she doesn’t believe me…I know someone else remembers that little tidbit too… ~)\n\nYea, she was married to Corey from 89 - 93, she had Kassius Lijah Marcil-Green in 2002… So he is like 8 yrs old… i always thought that her and Chris looked good togeather too. But her now husband is way hot… Plus they had been friends forever… I wish them all the happiness in the world…\n\nNope. That was just a celebration for the ‘big day’.\n\nShe has confirmed the wedding will be in Dec in numerous interviews.\n\nDespite numerous reports Vanessa Marcil revealed that they aren’t married yet but plans to do so this winter. The event thought to be their wedding was just a party in celebration to their big day.\n\nCongrats you two love birds. I’m interested into see what Guza has up Carmine’s sleeve.\n\nsee the article here: soaps.sheknows.com/generalhospital/news/id/10269/General_Hospitals_Vanessa_Marcil_Married_(Updated)/"
