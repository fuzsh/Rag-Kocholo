According to the Advance archives, the borough once was home to at least three nickelodeon movie studios: Fred Scott's Movie Ranch (1890s-1914) at the foot of Sand Lane in South Beach is considered by some film historians to be \"the birthplace of movie Westerns.\" The studio also shot \"on location\" at Brady's Pond in Grasmere and Fox Hills (now Park Hill).\n\nThe Biograph Co. opened a small studio in New Brighton, circa 1906, and a Stapleton studio specializing in serial comedies operated for about a year around 1922.\n\nAfter that, movie-making decided to go West.\n\nBut movie stars, TV mainstays and Broadway talents never really went away from these shores. Check out this gallery of actors you might not know lived here once upon a time. (And no, we're not including cast members of \"Jersey Shore\" or any other reality show. Acting the fool doesn't count this time.)\n\nWe know this list is far from comprehensive: Share the many talents we missed in the comments section below.\n\nThe original leading lady: Mabel Normand\n\nHard-living Mabel Normand (1892-1930) was a silent screen star who grew up in New Brighton and made 11 short films with Charlie Chaplin.\n\nAlso a pioneering writer-director, Normand is credited with originating the classic cream-pie-in-the-face routine and headlined the “Keystone Comedies,” a now legendary series of \"instant movies\" shot in St. George circa 1914-16.\n\nShe once was linked romantically to actor-producer Mack Sennett, who gave her a $2 engagement ring on the Staten Island Ferry. They never married.\n\nThroughout the 1920s her name was linked with widely publicized scandals including the 1922 murder of William Desmond Taylor and the 1924 shooting of Courtland S. Dines, who was shot by Normand's chauffeur using her pistol. She was not a suspect in either crime. Her film career declined, possibly due to both scandals and a recurrence of tuberculosis in 1923, which led to a decline in her health, retirement from films and her death in 1930 at age 37.\n\nPaul Newman: The original North Shore hipster?\n\nFROM THE ADVANCE IN 2008: With an esteemed acting career spanning more than five decades, it may be comforting for Staten Islanders to know that Oscar winner Paul Newman's dramatic roots sprouted in St. George.\n\nIn 1951, Newman and his first wife, Jackie Witte, came east from Ohio with their year-old son Scott, who later died of a drug overdose at 28.\n\nIn 1952, the struggling actor was living in the Ambassador Apartments at 30 Daniel Low Terr., St. George. It was during that brief period of Island residency that Newman, then 27, happened upon the Inquiring Photographer from the Advance. He was one of four men and two women to answer the question:\n\n\"Are good-looking candidates likely to garner the votes of women?\"\n\nHis response, published on Saturday, Sept. 13, 1952, along with his photo (blue eyes piercing even through the black and white print):\n\n\"I think the chances are about 50-50 that a woman will vote for the best-looking candidate. In many cases, women voters are influenced by their husbands' opinions — and there aren't many men who are overly impressed by the fact that a candidate is good-looking.\"\n\nNewman continued: \"When it comes to single women, they are just as apt to be influenced by the political opinions of their fathers or brothers as by the appearance of candidates. I guess I haven't much faith in the ability of women to make up their minds about who to vote for.\"\n\nAt the time of the Advance interview, which came during the presidential campaign of Republican Dwight Eisenhower and Democrat Adlai Stevenson, Newman was several months from his Broadway debut in \"Picnic,\" by William Inge. The play premiered at the Music Box Theatre on Feb. 19, 1953.\n\nAfter a year at the Yale School of Drama, Newman joined the Actors Studio in Manhattan.\n\nIt was during his \"Picnic\" run that Newman worked with Joanne Woodward, whom he would marry in 1958 after divorcing Ms. Witte.\n\nPat Robertson has to be acting, right?\n\nIn 2005, the Advance opined: “It must be nice to be a televangelism tycoon. He talks with a disturbingly knowing smile on his face at all times, regardless of the subject matter, so he must truly enjoy being himself.”\n\nBut surely the \"700 Club\" host is just acting like he's disrespecting everyone from public school educators to \"cursed Haitians\" and Hurricane Katrina survivors to the LGBTQ community. Right?\n\nAnyway, Pat supposedly found religion in the 1950s while living in Dongan Hills, where he headed a failed Adlai Stevenson-for-President effort.\n\nThe best child star tears ever\n\nRick Schroeder, of butt-baring \"NYPD Blue\" (1998-2001) and \"Lonesome Dove\" (1989) television fame, became an instant sensation for his tear-jerking child star role opposite Jon Voight in the 1979 film, \"The Champ.”\n\nCome on. Lookit those waterworks to your left: How can that not scar a kid for life?\n\nBorn on Staten Island, he spent his childhood and early career — he was Ricky then — living on Leverett Avenue in Great Kills. Oh, he also revealed that he kissed Whitney Houston in the dressing room of sitcom “Silver Spoons” (1982-87).\n\nThis Tony winner brought 'Da Funk' to Silver Lake\n\nSilver Laker Ann Duquesnay, the Tony Award-winning star of Broadway's \"Bring in 'Da Noise, Bring in 'Da Funk,\" for which she also wrote lyrics and arranged music. Duquesnay also appeared in Broadway's \"Jelly's Last Jam,\" the revival of \"The Wiz\" and \"Hot Feet,\" singing \"Dearest Heart,\" one of composer/musician Maurice White's favorite songs written for the Earth, Wind and Fire music vehicle.\n\nIn 2007, while appearing in off-Broadway's \"Our Leading Lady\" with Kate Mulgrew of \"Orange is the New Black,\" Duquesnay told the Advance: \"I would love to do a film with substance,\" she said. \"That is my desire, to do a film. But it needs to be just the right job.\"\n\nRob Bailey | bailey@siadvance.com\n\nRemember when this guy passed for a movie star?\n\nSteven Seagal, star of the hits \"Marked for Death,\" \"Under Siege\" and a string of straight-to-DVD action thrillers, and his ex-wife, \"don't hate me because I'm beautiful\" actress/model Kelly LeBrock (\"The Woman in Red,\" \"Weird Science\"), lived in Eltingville in the early 1990s near the home of Julius Nasso, a producer of Seagal's films who later spent a year in prison for \"using mob muscle to settle a business dispute with his biggest star.\"\n\nNasso's waterfront mansion, btw, was just used for a location shoot of CBS's new series, \"Limitless,\" produced by Oscar nominee Bradley Cooper.\n\nPHOTOS AT LEFT: Dec. 30, 1991 was declared \"Steven Seagal Day\" on Staten Island. The\" karate crime fighter\" had the day proclaimed in his honor by Borough President Guy V. Molinari. Seagal is pictured here with fellow Eltingville resident, producer Julius Nasso. Right: 'Above the Law' star Steven Seagal isn't above the divorce law in 1998: His wife of seven years, Kelly LeBrock, shown with him in this Oct. 8 1992 file photo, wants to call it quits.\n\nAlyssa Milano's Evolution: Jersey Shore\n\nfrom\n\nFunny Or Die\n\nAlyssa Milano: She's still so boss\n\nAlyssa Milano, who starred in TV's \"Who's the Boss,\" \"Melrose Place,” \"Charmed,\" and “Mistresses,” lived in Great Kills/Eltingville as a kid.\n\nHer roots run deep: She took private lessons from Donna Brandefine of Brandy's Dance Unique and donated a signed “Who’s the Boss” collector's to the “Building for the Future Campaign” fundraiser that helped get the South Shore YMCA built.\n\nThe current host of “Project Runway: All-Stars” also starred in the comedy video to your left. It’s a tongue-in-cheek dig at the S.I. stereotypes profligated by “Jersey Shore,” which she found offensive.\n\nRobert Loggia: Character actor supreme\n\nRobert Loggia, nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar for his work in \"Jagged Edge\" (1986), graduated from New Dorp High School and played football at Wagner College. The veteran character actor also stole scenes opposite Richard Gere in \"Officer and a Gentleman,\" Tom Hanks in \"Big\" (remember the iconic piano scene?) and Al Pacino in \"Scarface.\"\n\nAnd then there are his small screen appearances everywhere from \"The Sopranos\" to \"Family Guy.\"\n\nRobin Quivers is a great actress\n\nYou might be asking why we included this veteran radio personality in our list of “ACTORS.” After all, she only played herself in the film \"Private Parts\" opposite shock-jock Howard Stern.\n\nWell, I would argue that this longtime Todt Hill resident proved her thespian skills beyond a shadow of a doubt by laughing at Howard’s N-word jokes for many years. Multiple Grammy winner and Rock and Roll Hall of Famer Linda Ronstadt actually addressed that situation with Robin in the clip to your left.\n\nKevork Djansezian\n\nAt least we don't have to claim Charlie: Winning!\n\nVeteran actor Martin Sheen (Terrence Malick’s “Badlands,” Francis Ford Coppola’s “Apocalypse Now” and Netflix’s new “Grace & Frankie”) lived in the same St. George apartment building as Paul Newman – but years later, between 1962 and 1964, while waiting for his big break. His first child, actor-writer-Brat-Packer Emilio Estevez (“The Breakfast Club,\" \"Mighty Ducks\"), was born on the living room floor.\n\nPHOTO AT LEFT: Martin Sheen, left, and Emilio Estevez are seen following the12th annual Critics' Choice Awards on Friday, Jan. 12, 2007 in Santa Monica, Calif. (AP Photo/Kevork Djansezian)\n\nStaff-Shot\n\nThe artist formerly known as Tristan Wilds\n\nTristan Wilds, a longtime resident of the Stapleton Houses and graduate of the Petrides School, played Michael Lee on HBO's drug-scene drama \"The Wire,\" starred in the CW's \"90210\" reboot, as well as the films \"Red Tails\" and \"Secret Life of Bees.\"\n\nToday, however, he's better known as Grammy-nominated hip-hop/R&B star Mack Wilds, who just headlined SummerStage in Clove Lakes Park as well as concerts around the globe.\n\nJoey Faye: The burlesque banana\n\nJoey Faye, a comedian whose career spanned 65 years from burlesque to Broadway, movies and TV, and who played second banana to comic greats like Phil Silvers and Gypsy Rose Lee, once lived in Great Kills.\n\nRob Bailey | bailey@siadvance.com\n\nTheo Rossi: Staten Island Strong\n\nRichmond native Theo Rossi starred in the critically acclaimed FX series \"Sons of Anarchy.\" The busy actor recently filmed \"When the Bough Breaks\" for Screen Gems and \"Low Riders\" for Universal. He's also the producer and star of the soon-to-be-released \"Bad Hurt.\"\n\nAbout latter film: \"It's a story about a family trying to keep it together as they deal with their son returning from the Iraqi War with PTSD and a daughter struggling with developmental challenges. I used Staten Island for a number of locations. The Island offers different kinds of looks and has the added benefit of being part of NYC. You have breathing room there. You can stage your equipment and get in and out of locations easily … I think it's important to support the film community on the Island. That's why I'm taking some time out to judge (Historic Richmond Town's All-American Drive-In) film fest.\"\n\nRossi also played a crucial role in the \"Staten Island Strong\" movement after Hurricane Sandy.\n\nThe 'American' guy from New Dorp\n\nBorn and raised in New Dorp — Eddie Kaye Thomas got his big break as Paul Finch in the \"American Pie\" film series. He's also known for his roles as Andy Rosenberg in the \"Harold & Kumar\" films and as the voice of Barry Robinson in \"American Dad!\"\n\nHe currently stars on the hit CBS action series \"Scorpion.\" Check out this chat with Eddie at 2015's Comic Con.\n\njan somma-hammel\n\nCarmine Giovinazzo: From 'CSI:NY' to 'Graceland'\n\nRichmond native Carmine Giovinazzo starred on “CSI: NY” (2004-2013) and currently plays Sid Markham on the USA series “Graceland.”\n\nHe graduated from Port Richmond High School in 1991 and attended Wagner College on a baseball scholarship. He hoped to become a professional baseball player, but a serious back injury dashed his career plans, so, with the support of his family, he turned to acting.\n\nHe studied acting at Wagner and HB Studios, and spent four years working mostly non-paying roles around the NYC area \"making his bones.\"\n\nHe was also married to actress Vanessa Marcil. The former spouses are pictured at left celebrating at the 26th annual Neptune Ball at Snug Harbor Cultural Center & Botanical Garden. (Staten Island Advance/Jan Somma Hammel)\n\nRob Bailey | bailey@siadvance.com\n\nClose encounters with Eric\n\nEric Close was born in Fort Wadsworth and has worked steadily in TV since breaking out of the NBC soap \"Santa Barbara.\" He portrayed FBI Agent Martin Fitzgerald on \"Without a Trace\" from 2002 to 2009, recently co-starred in the hit Clint Eastwood/Bradley Cooper film \"American Sniper\" and is doing double-duty of USA's \"Suits\" and ABC's \"Nashville\" opposite Connie Britton and Hayden Panettiere.\n\nMichael Angarano has a 'Knick' for acting\n\nCurrently a regular on Cinemax's acclaimed historical drama \"The Knick,\" where he plays Dr. Bertram \"Bertie\" Chickering, Jr., opposite Clive Owen. This former Oakwood resident started acting at 5 after his mom sent a picture to Ford's Modeling Agency in Manhattan, attended Our Lady Queen of Peace before moving to Hollywood to star opposite the likes of Meryl Streep and Heath Ledger.\n\nIn 2008, Angarano was featured in Vanity Fair as one of Hollywood's \"New Wave\" young stars. The same year, Kristen Stewart announced she and Angarano were in a relationship — and then her \"Twilight\" co-star, Robert Pattinson, came into the picture.\n\nHe got his big break as a kid in the recurring role of Elliott, the son of Jack McFarland, on the NBC's \"Will & Grace.\" He will next be seen on the big screen with Ezra Miller in the Sundance Film Fest fave \"The Stanford Prison Experiment (see video to your left).\n\nRob Bailey | bailey@siadvance.com\n\nBrendan Sexton III is all grown up now\n\nSt. George native Brendan Sexton III was a scene-stealer in Todd Solondz’s cult hit \"Welcome to the Doll House,” “Empire Records,” the Oscar-winning \"Boys Don’t Cry” and Ridley Scott’s “Black Hawk Down.” The son of a former city sanitation commissioner (and president of the Municipal Art Society!) also starred on AMC's crime drama \"The Killing” (2011-12) and a string of recent indie films.\n\nSexton owns and operates the NYC-based indie record label Big Bit Of Beauty.\n\nPHOTOS AT LEFT: Check out Brendan Sexton III, St. George resident, making an awards presentation at the Municipal Art Society Annual Meeting at Snug Harbor's Music Hall (Staten Island Advance/Michael Falco).
