        "text": "Tuesday, August 24, 2010 at 3:23 AM ET by Errol Lewis\n\n(SoapOperaNetwork.com) â€” In the new issue of ABC Soaps in Depth, dated September 6, 2010, actress Vanessa Marcil Giovinazzo has set the record straight on the marriage reports that rocked Hollywood blog sites in early July.\n\nOn Wednesday, July 14, Soap Opera Network had reported that Vanessa Marcil had wed longtime love Carmine Giovinazzo (\"CSI: NY\") in an intimate ceremony attended by close family and friends. The report was based on details provided by US Magazine, which claimed that the mag had heard from a representative of the actress that \"They [Marcil and Giovinazzo] were married in New York on Sunday night with family and close friends.\" With news that the actress had professionally changed her name from Vanessa Marcil to Vanessa Marcil Giovinazzo, it only solidified news of the nuptials. Now a month later, the actress has finally spoken out on what has apparently turned out to be nothing more than a blown out of proportion party that was being held in preparation of her upcoming nuptials to Mr. Giovinazzo, which is set to take place this winter.\n\nJust before taping began for her return to \"General Hospital\" in late July, the actress informed her employers at Disney/ABC Television that she had recently changed her name, which was done in order to give the company enough notice to update promotional materials in conjuction with her return to \"GH.\" But why did she change her name at all if she isn't married? And why did it take so long to clear up all those reports?\n\nIn her In Depth interview, Marcil Giovinazzo revealed that she changed her name prior to the actual event because \"I wanted to use his name professionally\" She added, \"We have been in love for 11 years. We've always been in each other's lives.\" As for why it took more than a month to clear things up? \"I'm completely unaware, as all my friends and family always like to remind me,\" she said. \"We grew vegetables and we are so living under our own little rock! We don't even have a TV!\" Well that explains a lot!\n\nNow how about when we can report on the REAL wedding? \"We're going to have about 10 parties celebrating! But the details of the wedding are just going to be ours.\"\n\nVanessa Marcil Giovinazzo can bee seen on \"General Hospital,\" which airs Weekdays on ABC. Anytime on ABC.com."
