I can't imagine why she'd use his name if they're not married yet. But yeah, I just watched that, and it's definitely a little puzzling. Either way, very cool for them!\n\nRe: Locker Room #19: Danny/Carmine--Everyone's Favorite Danny-in-Distr\n\nIn the magazine article - sorry I can't find the link anymore - Vanessa said she wanted to start using Carmines name professionally. Which is fair enough, I just hope it is because she is very proud to be with him not to garner extra publicity of her return to GH.\n\nRe: Locker Room #19: Danny/Carmine--Everyone's Favorite Danny-in-Distr\n\nApparently Carmine and Vanessa are not actually married yet.

I though Hill Harper tweeted Carmine was married? And he wouldn't lie cuz he's terribly religious or summit... :lol:\n\nMaybe the lovely Vanessa is a tad forgetful. Heaven knows, i would totally forget getting married to that walking, talking piece of porn.."
