        "text": "Actress Vanessa Marcil was not to be outdone by her ex Brian Austin Green and Megan Fox, with whom the former 90210 star recently tied the knot.\n\nShe got remarried too!\n\nA rep for the actress confirms to E! News that Marcil tied the knot with CSI: NY star Carmine Giovinazzo over the weekend. Congratulations to both!\n\nLast weekend was apparently the weekend of choice for weddings.\n\n“They are married,” said a rep for Marcil, who was also married to Corey Feldman earlier in life. But the actress has only one son, and it’s with Green.\n\nSpeaking of which, eight-year-old Kassius attended the wedding, bearing witness to one of his parents’ marriages for the second time in under a month.\n\nThat’s gotta be weird!\n\nMarcil and Giovinazzo swapped vows in New York on Sunday night with family and friends. No exes or their superstar new wives present. Go figure."
