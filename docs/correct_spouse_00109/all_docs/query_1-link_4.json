I saw Saturday instead of Sunday. But it seems like a lot of celebs got married this Saturday, which is the weird part of it.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nlmao he does.\n\nlmao\n\nI feel so left out by not getting married on Saturday.\n\nwhat day did you get married on?\n\noops I meant this past Saturday. cause everyone else did. sorry.\n\nomg I didn't know they were together.\n\nMe neither!\n\nikr?\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nI'm still mad over that cliffhanger ending.\n\nYes to this so much\n\nat least a two hour movie to wrap it up\n\nYes please. At least one episode to finish the story. It was such a good show!\n\nasd;kfdf I MISS IT :(\n\nshe was going by that last name at the daytime emmys, weird. perhaps they had the legal ceremony and this was just a formal one.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nMe too! I have no idea why everyone wants to get married in the summer. I love autumn, and there's no way I'd want my wedding day to be all gross, hot and humid! I'm biased though, I hate summer.\n\ni'm getting married in october (of NEXT year, but still!)\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - shewillshine Expand\n\n(no subject) - quote_me_once Expand\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous) Expand\n\n(no subject) - shewillshine Expand\n\nI'm standing in a November wedding and its outside! I live in Atlantic Canada!\n\nwell kassius has been busy lately hasn't he\n\nThat's exactly what I was going to say!\n\nmte\n\nI only knew her in Las Vegas but cool\n\nTwo new step-parents in one month? Wow.\n\nPS. I guess that rumor that BAG got married before Vanessa to show her up is true. Ass.\n\nThat's fucked up if it's true. :X\n\nBecause of this bitch ABC is pre-empting AMC and OLTL on August 10 to rerun old GH Brenda episodes so she is officially on my shit list. JR & Annie pwns her ass anyday!\n\nwell ABC already decided to do that before her return to save money .. they are cutting 20 days out of the year and re-rerunning old episodes to save production costs\n\nNow I'm going to have to watch ABC all day on Aug 10....I was a HUGE Brenda lover back in the day.\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nI honestly don't think so. They seem to be on okay terms now and I don't get why it would be a race?\n\nthere was a dumb tabloid story that they were competing to see who could steal each other's thunder to the altar\n\n(no subject) - bonitaquetal Expand\n\n(no subject) - simplychristina Expand\n\n(no subject) - rabbitncavylove Expand\n\n(no subject) - rabbitncavylove Expand\n\nlove him\n\n(no subject) - (Anonymous)\n\nShe is?!? I must have missed that, but I would like to know her beauty regimen as well.\n\nShe's gorgeous. I loved GH when I was in middle school and it was like Jason/Robin and Sonny/Brenda/Jax. I haven't watched it in years though..\n\ni think im the only one who thinks she looks like an older camille belle"
