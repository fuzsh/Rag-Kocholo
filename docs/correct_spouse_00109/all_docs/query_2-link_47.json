        "text": "Vanessa Marcil's divorce from \"CSI: NY\" actor Carmine Giovinazzo has been finalized, according to TMZ.\n\nCiting irreconcilable differences, the former \"Beverly Hills, 90210\" star had filed for divorce from Giovinazzo in August last year, per an E! News report at the time. The couple had tied the knot in 2010.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's been a bumpy couple of years for Marcil, who in 2011 is said to have suffered two miscarriages. Giovinazzo made the sad announcement through Marcil's Twitter account in December that year:\n\nA few weeks later, TMZ reported that the former \"General Hospital\" actress had been sued for hundreds of thousands of dollars by ex-boyfriend Brian Austin Green.\n\nGreen, who is the father of Marcil's 10-year-old son Kassius, alleged that his former lover had taken more than $200,000 from him without paying him back. However, in October last year, a judge dismissed Green's lawsuit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the personal challenges in her life, Marcil seems to be putting a positive foot forward. On Twitter this month, the 44-year-old beauty has been actively sharing uplifting words of wisdom with her 50,000-plus followers.\n\ntwitter.com/VanessaMarcilG…\n\n— Vanessa Marcil G (@VanessaMarcilG) March 4, 2013\n\n“The wound is the place where the Light enters you,” she tweeted last week, quoting the poet Rumi.\n\nThis is the second divorce for Marcil, whose first marriage, to actor Corey Feldman went sour after four years. They parted ways in 1993."
