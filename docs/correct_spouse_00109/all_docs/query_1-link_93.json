She’s actually dating SNL‘s Jason Sudeikis.\n\n-General Hospital‘s Vanessa Marcil recently walked down the aisle with CSI: NY‘s Carmine Giovinazzo. Brian Austin Green, the father of Vanessa’s 8-year-old son, wed Megan Fox in June.\n\n-The engagement’s over for Kelly Osbourne and Luke Worrall. According to reports, the 20-year-old model allegedly cheated on the 25-year-old reality star.\n\n-The-Dream says his failed marriage to singer Christina Milian drove him to attempt suicide. The two married last September and have a five-month-old daughter."
