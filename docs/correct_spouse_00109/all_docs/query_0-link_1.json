        "text": "Former \"90210\" star Vanessa Marcil is officially a free woman ... because her divorce from \"CSI:NY\" actor Carmine Giovinazzo (aka the nicest DUI arrestee of all time) has been finalized.\n\nTMZ broke the story ... Marcil filed for divorce from Giovinazzo last summer, citing \"irreconcilable differences.\" They were married in 2010 and have no children together.\n\nAs for the division of assets ... Vanessa gets the 2009 Chevy Silverado, their L.A. property, a bunch of bank accounts ... as well as all rights to her baby clothes company called Baby Gagoo.\n\nCarmine gets the mother lode -- a 2002 Mercedes CLK, his 2006 Harley, his 2010 Triumph motorcycle, the 1969 Pontiac GTO, 2009 Ducati, 2011 Chevy Camaro ... plus a bunch of bank accounts and other boring stuff.\n\nIt's been a rough couple months for Carmine, who was arrested for DUI in January in Scottsdale, AZ. You'll recall, AZ cops say the actor was one of the nicest people they've ever arrested, apologizing constantly and saying he didn't want to be an \"a**hole.\" He even thanked the arresting officers profusely for being so nice to him.\n\nAccording to police, Carmine's blood alcohol level registered at .149 after his arrest ... nearly twice the legal limit in AZ."
