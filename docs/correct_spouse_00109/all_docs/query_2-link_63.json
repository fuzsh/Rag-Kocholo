        "text": "U.S. Actress Vanessa Marcil has filed for divorce against her husband Carmine Giovinazzo. She is best remembered for her role as Gina on Beverly Hills 90210. Her Staten Island born husband is best known for his role as Danny on CSI:NY.\n\nMarcil's divorce announcement comes right on the heels of Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes announcement that their divorce has been finalized and a marital settlement agreement has been reached. Fans have been trying to get a hold of the marital settlement agreement between Cruise and Holmes. The couple took less than two weeks to work out their marital settlement agreement. They have made every effort to keep the details of the agreement and their divorce private, stating Suri (their daughter) is their first concern.\n\nMarcil has already had two divorces. One divorce from her previous co-star on Beverly Hills 90210, Brian Austin Green. The other divorce was from former teenage heartthrob Corey Feldman. Though it has been stated that Marcil has often denied being married to Feldman, due to the embarrassment of his heavy drinking and drug problems. Nevada records do show that they were married on August 6, 1989.\n\nMarcil has stated the reason for divorce as irreconcilable differences. As of yet there it doesn't seem that this Hollywood couple is going to give fans a dramatic divorce. It appears that it will be the equivalent of Pennsylvania's simple, no-fault, uncontested divorce. At the moment no allegations have been made as to the reason that the marriage failed. It seems likely that Marcil and Giovinazzo may opt to keep their divorce a private affair and have the martial settlement agreement quietly prepared by their attorneys. This would save them the stress and publicity of a long court battle, and make the divorce much cheaper for them both in the long run.\n\nThe couple does not have any children together which should make coming to an agreement quicker. They had tried to have children, but Marcil had two miscarriages. Marcil is requesting spousal support and to have her legal fees paid for by Giovinazzo. Giovinazzo has not responded to the financial demands. If he is in agreement, the couple should have minimal problems in reaching a quick settlement agreement.\n\nIt will be interesting to see if Tori Spelling's (another Beverly Hills 90210 star) marriage will end in divorce. Rumors have been flying around for a while, though they recently claim they are madly in love. Spelling has a history of spending thousands of dollars on shopping sprees which apparently has put a significant strain on the marriage.\n\nIf you decide to have a simple, uncontested, no-fault Pennsylvania divorce and can agree on a fair and reasonable martial settlement agreement, Attorney James Cairns can help you get your divorce quickly, easily, and affordably.
