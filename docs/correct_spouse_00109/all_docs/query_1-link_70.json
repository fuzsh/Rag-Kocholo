        "text": "News Roundup: 90210, One Tree Hill, Gossip Girl and More\n\n90210, One Tree Hill and Gossip Girl are all nominated for Show You Cannot Believe Is Still on the Air and Guiltiest Pleasure in Kristin’s Tater Top Awards.\n\nThe next category in The CW Sourcies is Favorite Bad Boy. Among the nominees: Liam (Matt Lanter, 90210), Clay (Robert Buckley, One Tree Hill) and Chuck (Ed Westwick, Gossip Girl).\n\nAusiello has a huge 90210 spoiler, one that I don’t have a good feeling about. At all. Feel free to discuss in the comments below. This is fair warning to those who wish to stay spoiler-free.\n\nPEOPLE.com spoke to Tori Spelling (Donna, Beverly Hills 90210) about making a Twitter account for her three-year-old son, Liam.\n\nStrange: Us Weekly is reporting Vanessa Marcil (Gina, Beverly Hills 90210) just got married to Carmine Giovinazzo last weekend but, if you recall, she used his last name (in addition to hers) at the Daytime Emmys last month.\n\nOne Tree Hill begins filming season 8 tomorrow.\n\nGossip Cop busted reports about Chad Michael Murray (Lucas, One Tree Hill) attending a Scientology meeting with Tom Cruise, husband to CMM’s former co-star Katie Holmes (Joey, Dawson’s Creek), and Will Smith. He was with them, but it wasn’t a Scientology event.\n\nDose.ca has a pretty good interview with Taylor Momsen (Jenny, Gossip Girl).\n\nChris Pratt (Che, The O.C.) has joined the cast of the film Moneyball.\n\nComments : 6 Comments »\n\nTags: 90210, Ausiello, Beverly Hills 90210, Carmine Giovinazzo, Che, Chris Pratt, Chuck, Clay, Daytime Emmys, Donna, Dose.ca, Ed Westwick, Gina, Gossip Girl, Jenny, Kristin, Liam, Matt Lanter, Moneyball, One Tree Hill, PEOPLE.com, Robert Buckley, Tater Top Awards, Taylor Momsen, The CW Sourcies, The O.C, Tori Spelling, Twitter, US Weekly, Vanessa Marcil, Vanessa Marcil Giovinazzo"
