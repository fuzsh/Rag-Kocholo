        "text": "American actress\n\nVanessa Marcil[2] ( mar-SEL;[citation needed]) is an American actress. She is best known for her television roles as Brenda Barrett on General Hospital, Gina Kincaid on Beverly Hills, 90210, and Sam Marquez on Las Vegas.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nMarcil, the youngest of four children, was born in Indio, California, to Patricia Marcil, an herbalist, and Pete Ortiz, a contractor and self-made millionaire. Marcil's father is Mexican, and her mother is an American of French and Italian ancestry.[3]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nMarcil acted in a number of theatre productions before landing the role of Brenda Barrett on the soap opera, General Hospital, in 1992. She garnered three Daytime Emmy Award nominations (in 1997, 1998, and 2003) for her portrayal, and she won in 2003 as Outstanding Supporting Actress. In February 1998, she was named Outstanding Lead Actress at the Soap Opera Digest Awards.[4]\n\nOn June 14, 1993, she appeared in the Prince music video \"Poorgoo,” which was officially released in very limited numbers. In 1994, she was cast in the Prince music video, \"The Most Beautiful Girl in the World,” and she also made People's 50 Most Beautiful list the next year.[5] She made her feature-film debut in the film, The Rock (1996), in which she appeared opposite Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery, and Ed Harris.\n\nIn 1998, after six years on General Hospital, she left the show to star in the made-for-television movie, To Love, Honor and Deceive and had a recurring guest role on the police drama High Incident, which was produced by Steven Spielberg. In November 1998, Marcil joined the Beverly Hills, 90210 cast as Gina Kincaid and remained with the show for one-and-a-half seasons. In 1999, she starred in two independent films: Nice Guys Sleep Alone, with Sean O'Bryan, and This Space Between Us, with Jeremy Sisto.\n\nIn 2001, she was initially cast to join NYPD Blue's ninth season as a new series regular, Detective Carmen Olivera. However, after her first appearance in \"Johnny Got His Gold,” the show decided to redo the role and replaced Marcil with Jacqueline Obradors, as Detective Rita Ortiz. Marcil made one more cameo appearance, as Detective Olivera, in the 11th-season episode, \"Shear Stupidity.”\n\nFrom 2002 to 2003, she returned to General Hospital, as Brenda Barrett, garnering her a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in 2003. Vanessa later joined the cast of the NBC drama Las Vegas as Sam Marquez, a casino host, where she remained on the show for five seasons until 2008. That same year, she became the host of Lifetime's reality show Blush: The Search for the Next Great Makeup Artist, as well as making a three-episode guest appearance on the NBC show Lipstick Jungle.\n\nIn 2009, she starred in the Hallmark Channel movie The Nanny Express and in the Lifetime movie, One Hot Summer. In 2010, she was in the web series The Bannen Way, and in August 2010, after a seven-year absence, she made her return to General Hospital, remaining on the show for a year before her departure from the daytime series in July 2011. Marcil did reprise her role by making a guest appearance in April 2013, however, to commemorate the show's 50th anniversary.\n\nIn 2014, she starred in the Hallmark channel movie, Stranded in Paradise, and in 2015, she joined the cast of the Pop reality series, Queens of Drama, about the lives of former soap-opera actresses attempting to pitch a pilot for a television network. In 2016, she starred in her latest Hallmark channel movie, The Convenient Groom.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nMarcil was married to actor Corey Feldman from 1989 to 1993.[6]\n\nIn 1999, Marcil started dating her Beverly Hills, 90210 cast mate, Brian Austin Green, whom she met on set. The two became engaged in July 2001 and had a son named Kassius Lijah Marcil-Green. They planned to wed that year, but they ended their relationship in 2003.[7][8]\n\nOn July 11, 2010, Marcil married actor Carmine Giovinazzo in a private ceremony in New York City.[2][9] In June 2011, the couple announced they were expecting their first child together;[10] however, Marcil suffered a miscarriage, her second that year.[11] Marcil filed for divorce in August 2012 on the basis of irreconcilable differences.[12] The divorce was finalized in March 2013.[13]\n\nIn April 2015, Marcil revealed on social media that she was engaged to a California Deputy Sheriff, MC Martin.[14] On November 13, 2017, Marcil announced she was pregnant again.[15] On January 9, 2018, she revealed that she was expecting a daughter, but on January 27, released a statement on Instagram stating she had miscarried for the seventh time.[16]\n\nMarcil's father, Pete, died on September 14, 2017.[17]\n\nMarcil converted to Judaism.[18][19]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nList of film credits Year Title Role Notes 1996 Carla Pestalozzi 1997 976-WISH Danielle Short film 1999 Nice Guys Sleep Alone Erin 2000 This Space Between Us Maggie Harty 2002 Storm Watch Tess Woodward Alternative titles: Virtual Storm, Code Hunter\n\nList of television credits Year Title Role Notes\n\n1992–1998\n\n2002–2003\n\n2010–2011\n\n2013\n\nGeneral Hospital Brenda Barrett Main role (1992–1998; 2002–2003; 2010–2011)\n\nGuest role (2013) 1996 To Love, Honor and Deceive Sydney Carpenter Television film; aka The Protected Wife 1997 High Incident Kerry Andrews Episodes: \"Hot Wire\", \"Remote Control\" 1998–2000 Beverly Hills, 90210 Gina Kincaid Main role (seasons 9–10) 2001 Spin City Crazy Kara Episode: \"A Shot in the Dark: Part 2\" 2001, 2003 NYPD Blue Detective Maria Olivera Episodes: \"Johnny Got His Gold\", \"Shear Stupidity\" 2003–2008 Las Vegas Sam Marquez Main role 2004–2005 Crossing Jordan Sam Marquez Episodes: \"What Happens in Vegas Dies in Boston\", \"Luck Be a Lady\" 2008 Lipstick Jungle Josie Scotto 3 episodes 2008 Kate Hewitt Television film 2009 Without a Trace Kim Marcus 3 episodes 2009 One Hot Summer Margarita Silva Santos Television film 2010 Madison Webseries 2012 Hawaii Five-0 Dr. Olivia Victor Episode: \"Wahine'inoloa\" 2014 Stranded in Paradise Tess Nelson Television film 2014 Hell's Kitchen Herself Episode: \"17 Chefs Compete\" 2016 The Convenient Groom Dr. Kate Lawrence Television film 2017 The Wrong Mother Kaylene Television film 2018 Bad Tutor Kelly Television film 2019 My Stepfather's Secret Tina Television film\n\nAwards and nominations\n\n[edit]\n\nAwards and nominations Year Award Category Work Result 1994 Soap Opera Digest Awards Outstanding Female Newcomer General Hospital Nominated 1995 Soap Opera Digest Awards Hottest Soap Couple (shared with Maurice Benard) General Hospital Nominated 1997 Daytime Emmy Award Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series General Hospital Nominated 1997 Soap Opera Digest Awards Hottest Female Star General Hospital Won 1998 Soap Opera Digest Awards Outstanding Lead Actress General Hospital Won 1998 Daytime Emmy Award Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series General Hospital Nominated 2003 Soap Opera Digest Awards Favorite Return General Hospital Won 2003 Daytime Emmy Award Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series General Hospital Won\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
