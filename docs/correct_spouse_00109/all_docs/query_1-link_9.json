        "text": "American actor\n\nCarmine Dominick Giovinazzo ( KAR-myne jee-OH-vin-AH-zoh, born August 24, 1973), is an American actor, writer, painter and musician, known for his role as Detective Danny Messer in CSI: NY.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nGiovinazzo was born and raised in the Port Richmond neighborhood of Staten Island, New York, the son of Nancy and Dominick Giovinazzo, a retired NYPD police officer.[2] Growing up, Giovinazzo was an avid athlete. He played baseball for 4 years at Port Richmond High School where he was an Advance all-star as a senior, eventually graduating in 1991, and went on to attend Wagner College on a baseball scholarship.[3] He had hoped to become a professional baseball player, but a serious back injury dashed his career plans; with the support of his family, he turned to acting. He studied acting at Wagner College and HB Studios, and spent four years working mostly non-paying roles in the New York area.[4]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1997, Giovinazzo moved to Los Angeles. Not long afterward, he successfully landed his first Hollywood role in the pilot of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, in which his character was the show's first on-screen victim. Afterwards, he appeared in numerous guest-starring roles on television and in film, including the Learning Curve, Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss, For Love of the Game, The Big Brass Ring, and Black Hawk Down. He was also cast as one of the stars of the short-lived UPN sitcom Shasta McNasty, which was nominated for a People's Choice Award. Other films in which he had starring roles include In Enemy Hands with William H. Macy, and Players with Freddy Rodriguez and Peter Dobson. He played Tony Galper, the victim in the final episode of the TV series Columbo.\n\nGiovinazzo was cast as forensic scientist Danny Messer on the hit TV series CSI: NY and is the first actor to appear in all three CSI series; his character was introduced in the CSI: Miami episode \"MIA/NYC NonStop\" (along with the other CSI: NY cast members), and he guest-starred in season three of the Las Vegas-based original series as street racer Thumpy G in the episode \"Revenge is Best Served Cold\" (though it is never specified that this guest spot was in any way related to his character on CSI: NY). Giovinazzo penned season six's vampire-themed episode \"Sanguine Love\",[5] joining series leads Melina Kanakaredes and Gary Sinise who have also written episodes for the series.\n\nIn 2014, Giovinazzo portrayed the recurring role of Sid Markham in season two of the USA television series Graceland. In this series, he reunited with his former CSI: NY co-star Vanessa Ferlito.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nGiovinazzo plays the guitar, and writes songs and poetry.[4] He is also a painter, mostly in oils, and one of his paintings appeared in the \"Tri-Borough\" episode of CSI: NY.[6] He is currently a lead vocalist in the band Ceesau, which released one album, Era of the Exposed (2008).[7] The song \"Tear To Spare\", from this album, was played in the CSI: NY sixth-season episode \"Sanguine Love\", which Giovinazzo wrote.\n\nGiovinazzo is a cousin of Buddy Giovinazzo and Larry Romano.[8]\n\nGiovinazzo married actress Vanessa Marcil on July 11, 2010, in a private ceremony in New York City.[9] Marcil filed for divorce in August 2012 on the basis of irreconcilable differences.[10] The divorce was finalized in March 2013.[11]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1996 Conception Billy Film short 1996 No Way Home Frankie Hamm Film 1997 Buffy the Vampire Slayer Christopher Boal Episode 1.01 \"Welcome to the Hellmouth\" 1997 Pacific Blue Cody Fisher Episode 3.08 \"Matters of the Heart\" 1998 Fallen Arches Frankie Romano Film 1998 Billy's Hollywood Screen Kiss Gundy Film 1999 The Big Brass Ring Young Billy Film 1999 Providence Kit Episode 1.17 \"Heaven Can Wait\" 2001 The Learning Curve Paul Cleveland Film 1999 For Love of the Game Ken Strout Film 1999 Shasta McNasty Scott All 22 episodes 2000 Terror Tract Frank Sarno Film (\"Nightmare\" segment) 2001 Black Hawk Down SGT Mike Goodale Film 2002 Big Shot: Confessions of a Campus Bookie T-Bone TV movie 2002 CSI: Crime Scene Investigation Thumpy G Episode 3.01 \"Revenge is Best Served Cold\" 2003 Columbo Tony Galper Episode 13.05 \"Columbo Likes the Nightlife\" 2004 In Enemy Hands Buck Cooper Film 2004 CSI: Miami Danny Messer Episode 2.23 \"MIA/NYC NonStop\" 2004–2013 CSI: NY Danny Messer All 197 episodes 2008 This Is Not a Test Trey Film 2014–2015 Graceland Sid Markham 9 episodes (2.06–3.02) 2015 The Player Ray Episode 1.04 \"The Big Blind\" 2016 Criminal Minds Andrew Meeks Episode 11.15 \"A Badge and a Gun\" 2018 Duke Dare Film 2020 Chicago Med Tyler Episode 5.16 \"Who Should Be the Judge\" 2020 Batwoman Johnny Sabatino Episode: \"If You Believe in Me, I'll Believe in You\" 2022 The Offer Sonny Grosso Miniseries\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
