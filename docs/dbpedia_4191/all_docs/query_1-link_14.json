        "text": "Atari 7800\n\nAtari were hit hard in the video game crash and were eventually sold off a couple of time. They mostly concentrated on the computer market but still attempted to regain the glory theyâ€™d felt with the 2600. The 7800 followed the largely failed 5200.\n\nThe 7800 was basically an expanded 2600. It featured the same audio chip but a vastly improved graphics system. It was the first console developed outside of Atari, instead designed by General Computer Corporation.\n\nThe 7800 was an improvement over the 2600 and 5200, but not enough to compete with the incoming Japanese consoles.\n\nThe 7800 is compatible with the 5200 and 2600 range of games."
