        "text": "1981 - Epoch Cassette Vision Epoch, better know for their game software and toy products, was actually very involved with hardware development in Japan dating back to their first console release in June 1981 - the Epoch Cassette Vision. This very obscure system was actually a hybrid pong / cartridge-based unit - the first of its kind in Japan. Though financial windfalls were never achieved, the moderate success that the Cassette Vision did enjoy was due to one reason - correct price positioning.\n\nRead more... 1981 - VTech CreatiVision The CreatiVision was introduced in 1981 by VTech (Video Technology Limited), a Hong Kong based company. The unit was actually a computer hybrid (a small trend in those days). Appearance wise it was a typical console at heart, but by rotating the console's joysticks 90 degrees and then inserting them into two compartments on top of the console you were given a makeshift keyboard. Throw in a BASIC program cart and your console becomes a microcomputer.\n\nRead more... 1982 - Coleco ColecoVision After nearly bankrupting itself in 1978 with overstocked Telstar units, Coleco once again entered the console market looking to de-throne Atari 2600 and Intellivision, the current kings of the hill. ColecoVision was released in 1982 and boasted amazing specs for its time which showed in its arcade conversions. To secure their success Coleco reached out to a Japanese based company called \"Nintendo\" and paid $250,000 for the rights to a super popular arcade game called Donkey Kong. Donkey Kong became a pack in game with the console.\n\nRead more... 1982 - Atari 5200 SuperSystem The Atari 5200 was established in 1982 to compete with Intellivision and to become the successor of the Atari 2600. The Atari 5200 was a modified version of the Atari 400/800 which was the most powerful 8-bit home computer system of its era.
