        "text": "It’s a name that’s legendary in the world of video games: Atari. But few people today remember that the former video game giant once made computers, too. For 15 years (1978 to 1993), Atari designed and produced four distinct lines of PCs: the 8-bit “Atari 800” line, the 16-bit ST line, the PC compatibles, and the 32-bit series.\n\nAlthough Atari started off strong in the U.S. PC market, the company soon faltered in the face of shake-ups in the game industry (its core business) and stiff competition from IBM PC compatibles. In Europe, Atari held on to a niche of dedicated fans for years until finally shutting down its PC division in 1993. In the following slides, you’ll see just about every production computer model that Atari ever released over that 15-year period.\n\nWhen you’re done, feel free to share memories of your favorite Atari computer in the comments.\n\nSpecial thanks to the folks at Atarimuseum.de, who scanned many of the images used in this slideshow. All photos by Atari, except where noted.\n\nAtari’s 8-bit computer line began as a next-generation follow-up to the groundbreaking Atari 2600 video game console. Upon seeing Apple’s success in the early personal computer market, Atari executives ordered their engineers to turn the new hardware into a personal computer system, which became the 800. Originally retailing for $1000, the Atari 800 shipped with 8KB of RAM, upgradable to 48KB. Its little sibling, the Atari 400, shipped with less RAM and a flat membrane keyboard for $550.\n\nCheck out our complete teardown of the Atari 800 for more.\n\nAtari upgraded its 8-bit computer line in 1982 with the 1200XL, which featured 64KB of RAM and a simplified internal construction wrapped in a sleek new case design. Even though the 1200XL incorporated what may be the best-feeling keyboard of the series, it also became known as a highly flawed machine. A new OS introduced frustrating incompatibilities with existing Atari 8-bit software, and the closed case allowed no serious expansion. Sales of the original 800 actually went up after the release of the 1200XL, sending Atari back to the drawing board.\n\nThe launch of the Macintosh in 1985 set off a race to create a new generation of 16-bit, GUI-based PCs. Atari designed its own such computer, the 520ST, and launched it in March 1985. It was an amazingly cheap $799 bundle that included a 360KB floppy drive, a mouse, and a monochrome monitor. (For an extra $200, you could get a color monitor.) The 520ST packed 512KB of RAM and incorporated a colorful graphical windowing system called GEM.\n\nJust as the Macintosh platform quickly dominated the world of graphic design, the Atari ST found its strongest niche in music production due to Atari’s inclusion of two built-in MIDI ports, which was unusual at the time.\n\nBy 1987, the IBM-PC-compatible market had exploded into a cornucopia of unauthorized PC clones made by dozens of manufacturers, each united by MS-DOS and the x86 CPU architecture. Atari decided to try its hand at a PC clone in 1987, releasing the Atari PC, an 8MHz 8088 machine with 512KB of RAM and a 360KB 5.25-inch floppy drive in a Mega ST-style case. Later that year, the company released the PC2 (which sported a larger case and two floppy drives) and the PC3 (which used yet another case and included an internal hard disk).\n\nBy 1987, everyone was a little jealous of Nintendo’s blockbuster success with the NES. The Japanese game company had widely released its console in the United States only the year before, but had already sold millions of units while single-handedly reigniting the video game market. Hungry for a piece of the new business, Atari dipped into its musty archives and pulled out a few tricks, including the 7800 and a new console–the XE Game System–based on its aging 8-bit computer line. Plagued with ancient software and yesterday’s arcade ports, neither one performed as hoped.\n\nThe Atari ST line welcomed its first portable member in the form of 1989’s Stacy. At a time when the Macintosh Portable sold for $6500 to $7300, the $1995 Stacy seemed like a bargain. For that price you could buy a Stacy with 2MB RAM, a 20MB hard disk, and an 8MHz 68000 CPU. Unfortunately, the Stacy wasn’t too forgiving on the C cells that powered it: Fresh batteries would last only about 15 minutes in the machine, making it far less portable than most users would like.\n\nBy 1990, Atari’s PC-compatible line began to more closely resemble other PC clones. The systems used mostly off-the-shelf parts, and sold with far more configurable options. The ABC (Atari Business Computer) 286-30 shipped with a range of CPU and storage choices, offering an 8MHz to 20MHz 286 CPU and a 30MB to 60MB hard disk. It also included Atari’s first PC-compatible 3.5-inch floppy drive.\n\nThe ABC 386 series–Atari’s last foray into PC clones–included either a 20MHz or 40MHz CPU, 1MB or 2MB of RAM, and a 40MB or 80MB hard drive. The ABC 386 PCs were the only Atari computers to ship with Microsoft Windows–version 3.0, in fact."
