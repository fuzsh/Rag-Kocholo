Genius! \" - Funkmaster V 3.5 (Good) \"This slower paced, reformed version of Zoo Keeper is a very addictive game despite it's technical issues.\" - Silverback 3.0 (Fair) \"Armor Attack is an odd franchise to resurrect, and for you 119 people that wanted that resurrection, Happy Easter.\" - Funkmaster V 3.5 (Good) \"Vector graphics are unfortunately replaced with breakfast cereal looking space rocks... but team play saves the day.\" - Crossbow 4.0 (Very Good) \"The shield is a much better defensive device than Asteroid's hyperspace, plus its got great comedic value.\" - Funkmaster V 4.0 (Very Good) \"Astro Blaster has never been ported to a home console, and that's too bad because it has a few interesting twists that set it apart...\" - Funkmaster V 3.5 (Good) \"Astro Fighter kinda looks like its own outer space bowl of Lucky Charms. You have red chubby ghosts, yellow rocket ships, and blue uteruses\" - Funkmaster V 4.0 (Very Good) \"Control issues abound when you cram a computer game into a 7800 port, but \"Attack's\" genius is impossible to dismiss.\" - Funkmaster V 5.0 (Perfect) \"Q*bert (b*nq) is actually so high in quality that it makes other 7800 arcade ports like Donkey Kong and Galaga walk over to the corner of the room and pee their pants in submission.\" - Funkmaster V 5.0 (Perfect) \"This maze/pinball hybrid is the amazing marriage between two completely different genres you never knew you needed.\" - Funkmaster V 4.0 (Very Good) \"Terrific music and fast gameplay makes this futuristic sports title both intriguing and fun to play.\" - Funkmaster V 2.0 (Poor) \"Barnyard Blaster is a game with good graphics but is so boring and broken, that not even the thrill of shooting Gramps in the head will save it.\"- Funkmaster V 4.0 (Very Good)\"Although not a pure blooded sports game, Basketbrawl without question is the best sports title for the 7800.\"- Funkmaster V 4.5 (Excellent) \"Burgertime (Beef Drop) may be the best thing associated with the Atari 7800. I became a fan of this odd game, a title that a health inspector would cringe at, on the Atari 7800.\" - Funkmaster V 5.0 (Perfect) \"It's made for people like me: guys who suck at platform jumping and wished the hero packed an Uzi\" - Funkmaster V 2.5 (Weak) \"Block 'Em Sock 'Em proves that it is easier to review video games than it is to make them.\" - Funkmaster V 4.5 (Excellent) \"You might have played Centipede 100 times before on 100 different systems... but I think this version may be the best one yet.\" - Funkmaster V 1.5 (Bad)\"Another one of Frank O Dragon's games that are based on inside jokes, Chicago Basement is a complete waste of time for anyone not hip to the rib.\"- Silverback 3.0 (Fair) \"With missing adversaries, no extra levels, plus the predictable pattern of the enemies, the game is a very weak translation.\"- Crossbow 2.0 (Poor) \"Combat 1990 is the first homebrew game made for the 7800. It's playable, but has less modes than its 1977 VCS predecessor.\"- Funkmaster V 4.5 (Excellent) \"Commando is a commie wasting blast!\"- Funkmaster V 2.0 (Poor)\"...Let's head down to the Rooster Ranch and throw eggs at some lunatic rooster.\"- Funkmaster V 4.5 (Excellent)\"\"... this game is the spiritual big brother of Super Breakout.\" - Funkmaster V 2.5 (Weak)\"One of Frank O Dragon's best efforts, this tank shooter may look and play \"Crazily\", but is actaully pretty fun if you forgive it's looks and collision detection issues.\"- Funkmaster V 4.0 (Very Good) \"Atari really studied their Ps and Qs on this one.\"- Crossbow 2.5 (Weak) \"A love letter to Lewis Hill's youth, Danger Zone is a reimagining of his favorite variations of the Atari VCS game, Combat.\" - Funkmaster V 3.0 (Fair) \"Rarely has adventure, murder, ghosts, goblins, mazes, zombies and treasure hunting ever felt so... boring.\" - Funkmaster V 2.0 (Poor) \"This cousin of Omega Race has some tremendous ideas but the in game flicker and slow down puts the black flag on the fun.\" - Silverback 4.0 (Very Good) \"Desert Falcon is an odd game that undoubtedly borrows from the popular Arcade sensation Zaxxon, but adds a few hitches here and there to make it a very interesting cart on its own\"- Funkmaster V 4.0 (Very Good) \"Everything you loved about the arcade is present here in this version.\"- Crossbow 3.0 (Fair) \"I'm not sure what is going on in Donkey Kong's genital region, but I am sure that I don't want to know.\"- Funkmaster V 3.0 (Fair) \"Donkey Kong's genital region isn't as disturbing as it is in his game.\" - Funkmaster V 5.0 (Perfect) \"Donkey Kong PK and Donkey Kong XM are essentially the same game: Perfection.\"- Funkmaster V 5.0 (Perfect) \"Donkey Kong PK and Donkey Kong XM are essentially the same game: Perfection.\"- Funkmaster V 2.5 (Weak) \"On the old site I gave this game a 4.5... What the hell was I thinking? I believe nostalgia clouded my damned brainz.\" - Funkmaster V 3.5 (Good) \"As ubiquitous as Dragon's Cache's puzzle gameplay may be, the Dragon motif and the promise of more Dragon glory down the road has me sold.\" - Funkmaster V 4.0 (Very Good) \"Dragon's Descent is a near perfect blend of coin-op approachability, adventure gaming, and dungeon crawling that rarely works this well anywhere.\" - Funkmaster V 4.0 (Very Good) \"I love Dragon's Havoc, but it's innovative gameplay may alienate many SHMUP fans. \" - Silverback 2.5 (Weak)\"Draker Quest 2 is Frank O Dragon's most ambitious game, but this Legend of Zelda style adventure is too confusing, ugly, and even possibly broken- to recommend.\"- Silverback 3.0 (Fair) \"This re-imagining of Night Stalker is a medival battle instead of a spy thriller, but at it's core- it is the same maze shooter.\" - Silverback 5.0 (Perfect) \"A thinking man's maze shooter/ adventure, EXO is so tightly packed with extras, cinematics, songs, lush graphics, boss battles, and easter eggs that any 7800 fan would be remiss to skip it.\" - Funkmaster V 1.5 (Bad) \"Reading the box makes it sure sounds like fun! However, I have a completely different story to tell.\"- Crossbow 3.5 (Good) \"Fail Safe is not the hare, she is the tortoise\" - Funkmaster V 2.5 (Weak) \"It is boring, ugly, and mind numbing... but if you like Mad Max style games where the world is going to Hell, Fatal Run might be right up your alley.\" - Funkmaster V 2.0 (Poor) \"On a system devoid of any quality fighting games, this one wins the title by default.\" - Funkmaster V 4.0 (Very Good) \"...it has all the action and gameplay of the original arcade game.\"- Crossbow 4.5 (Excellent) \"...this game puts the hatred of robots in my heart, and helps it fester.\" - Funkmaster V 4.5 (Excellent) \"Another 7800 game where the name is changed to protect the innocent. But make no mistake, this IS Frogger.\" - Funkmaster V 3.5 (Good) \"Galaga could have been another slam dunk arcade conversion for the 7800 if it wasn't for the game being demoically possessed at level 10.\" - Funkmaster V 4.0 (Very Good) \"Galaxian is wedged in between Space Invaders and Galaga in the pantheon of famous SHMUPs, and it's 7800 port is more exciting than the former and better programmed than the latter.\" - Silverback 3.5 (Good) \"GoSub is a functioning homebrew that seems to be greater than the sum of its parts. The drive to beat the game supersedes the eventual monotony of the game play.\" - Funkmaster V 4.0 (Very Good) \"Revontuli's 4th dragon-universe game for the 7800 is a delightful Metroidvania with unique Joust inspired controls.\"- Funkmaster V 2.5 (Weak) \"Here's a fun little sports game. I say little because there isn't much to it, and I'm also trying to be condescending.\"- Funkmaster V 3.0 (Fair) \"...this game doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it does a great job putting a disgusting, flesh colored paint job on it.\"- Funkmaster V 4.5 (Excellent) \"There will be loads of Rambo-esque testosterone flowing throw your veins when you wipe out 20 guys with a single hand grenade.\"- Funkmaster V 1.5 (Bad) \"Corporate Apathy in a video game cartridge... this pile a crap that is unbeatbale due to a progamming error signifies a bigger problem... Atari did not GAF at this point.\"- Funkmaster V 4.5 (Excellent) \"Impossible Mission features tons of puzzles and problem solving, decent graphics and sound effects, and a challenge that is out of this world.\"- Funkmaster V 2.0 (Bad) \"...no matter how hard you try, you cannot control that damn ball. You start cursing and tensing up...and then your left eye twitches. \"- Funkmaster V 4.0 (Very Good) \"Joust is another in a respectable line of excellent arcade ports for the Atari 7800.
