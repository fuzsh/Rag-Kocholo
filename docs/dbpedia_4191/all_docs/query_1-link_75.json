        "text": "1984: the 7800 releases to mixed reception and lukewarm sales.\n\n1985: the 7800 receives some new game releases but overall does not see a increase in sales. Sales reach 1 million by the end of 1985, which is good but not great. Magnavox decides to release the previously canceled Odyssey3 after seeing Atari survive the Video Game Crash. Nintendo releases the NES in October for a limited release as in real life but does not package ROB The Robot with it. Super Mario Bros becomes a Smash hit.\n\n1986: while the NES becomes the sales leader in North America and Japan, the Atari 7800 and Odyssey3 battle it out over Europe. The Odyssey3 fails in North America and does not release in Japan. Due to the NES' competition, Nintendo is unable to force third party developers to develop games for NES only. We see more multiplatform games in the 8 bit era. Sega releases the Master System and it fails to make a impact on the industry\n\nSALES NUMBERS (LIFETIME - 1986)\n\n1: NES - 7 million\n\n2: Atari 7800 - 2 million\n\n3: Odyssey 3 - 500k\n\n4: Master System - 100k\n\nSALES NUMBERS (UP TO 1987)\n\n1: NES - 15 million\n\n2: Atari 7800 - 3 million\n\n3: Odyssey 3 - 1 million\n\n4: Master System - 150k\n\n1987: Atari and Magnavox's sales remained about the same as before as both systems continued to recieve new games. Nintendo dominated with great games like Super Mario Bros, The Legend Of Zelda and Metroid. Sega was on the verge of bankruptcy as its systems failed to sell. Atari & Magnavox both saw potential in Sega's new game franchise, Alex Kidd, and the Master System's better graphical capabilities. Atari & Magnavox also thought the could use Sega's arcade games for their own systems. On June 25, 1987, Atari began negotiations to possibly purchase Sega, and Magnavox also started this process a month later. Who would outbid the other and purchase Sega?. Find out in the next post!\n\nInteresting. So I think I will change Sega's fate then.\n\n1987 (NEW): Sega does not get purchased and instead becomes a multiplatform developer. Meanwhile, a company named NEC has proposed a 16-bit game system idea to Nintendo, Atari and Magnavox. While Nintendo does not seem interested, Atari and Magnavox are both very interested in this new technology. Atari and NEC begin a new partnership and the AtariGrafx-16 is planned for a mid-1988 release. Magnavox signs a 5-year exclusivity deal with Sega in 1987, ensuring that Sega's console ports of their arcade games only come to the Odyssey3 and future Odyssey systems. The deal won't expire until 1992 and can be renewed.\n\nAtari and NEC begin a new partnership and the AtariGrafx-16 is planned for a mid-1988 release\n\nNice but wasn't NEC but Hudson and then NEC took over the chips Hudson was offering to Nintendo, so here after fucking up with the famicom, decided to talk with NEC over the pc-engine? That would be interesting.\n\nSpecs of the Odyssey 3?\n\nNEC and Hudson IRL did join together after Nintendo rejected NEC. In this scenario I think Atari & Magnavox would have been interested in this new technology to one up Nintendo, and Atari would have had more money to do it, so they would have won out. The Odyssey3 was a real console planned for a 1983 release but it was canceled during the video game crash. The system was around the same level as the 7800 I think but not as powerful as NES.\n\nSALES TOTALS - 1988\n\n1: NES - 24 million\n\n2: AtariGrafx-16 - 4 million\n\n3: Odyssey3 - 1.25 million\n\nWhile the NES still dominated this year, Atari's new AtariGrafx-16 system, released during the Summer of 1988, saw some success. Atari's flagship title for the new system was a game created by Hudson Soft titled \"Bonk's Adventure\". Atari would later purchase the rights to the Bonk franchise in early 1989. Nintendo began development of a new handheld gaming system titled The Game Boy. Magnavox began developing their own 16-bit video game console, Odyssey4, set for a late 1989 release in Europe and early 1990 release in North America. The system was planned to launch with Sega's hit arcade game, Altered Beast. Atari 7800 began to wind down as AtariGrafx-16 became a success. Atari 7800's lifetime sales totalled 3.5 million units by the end of 1988, and the system saw very few games come out in 1988, though the Atari 7800 did remain in production.\n\nSALES TOTALS - 1989\n\nNES - 30 million\n\nAtariGrafx-16 - 9 million\n\nGame Boy - 3 million\n\nOdyssey4 - 250k\n\nThe NES saw its success begin to decline as the new 16-bit systems launched. Super Mario Bros 3 was rushed out to a Spring 1989 worldwide release to attempt to keep sales high until they could get their own 16-bit console out. The plan did not work and the severely rushed Super Mario Bros 3 was panned by critics for its glitches and technical issues. The game underperformed in sales. AtariGrafx-16 had a strong year of third-party support and Atari began to bring out their own games, though none were as successful as Bonk's Adventure. Atari and Hudson Soft continued their partnership as Hudson Soft continued developing software for the system. Magnavox launched the Odyssey4 in Europe in late 1989 and it had a lukewarm launch, selling 250,000 units in Europe that year. Altered Beast was a success on the system though. Game Boy had a strong start thanks to Terri's, but Super Mario Land's sales were worse than expected due to Super Mario Bros 3's failure earlier in the year. Odyssey3 was officially discontinued on December 31, 1989 with lifetime sales totalling 1,275,000.\n\nAlso to respond to your comment Nivek, Atari purchased the rights to Bonk, but Hudson Soft was still involved in the series' development and even received 25% of the revenue from the series. The deal basically just meant that Bonk could only be on Atari systems.\n\nSALES TOTALS - 1990\n\n1: AtariGrafx-16 - 15 million\n\n2: Game Boy - 13 million\n\n3: SNES - 3 million\n\n4: Odyssey4 - 1 million\n\nAtariGrafx-16 had another good year as the highly anticipated Bonk's Advemture 2 was released in Fall 1990. Game Boy was also a big success and it showed that Nintendo was still doing well in the industry. Nintendo released the SNES in the Spring of 1990 in Japan and rushed it to market in North America & Europe that holiday season. While there were shortages of the system, it still sold well and did outsell the Odyssey4 that season. The system's launch titles included Super Mario World and F-Zero. While Super Mario World was positively recieved and the game did sell better than SMB3, the real winner of that console launch was F-Zero, which became the SNES' flagship title. Magnavox's Odyssey4 struggled to make a impact as they had no real flagship games, though Altered Beast was a success. SEGA began development of a new game titled Sonic The Hedgehog. Atari 7800 was discontinued on December 26, 1991.\n\nAs say a move kills weak timelines, that was a shitty move of a bad author, Nintendo didn't care the pc engine at all, this is how people ruin their\n\nPeople didn't care about it because NEC had no brand recognition. Atari was a brand people knew, and in this timeline they already had done alright with the 7800. I think they would have cared in this timeline.\n\nPeople didn't care about it because NEC had no brand recognition.
