        "text": "Let's say it's June 1987, 35 years ago, and you own both Nintendo and Sega's newest systems. What do think of the console games released in the first half of 1987? If you could only have three of these games, which would they be and why?\n\nI used the North American release months from wikipedia, mobygames, segaretro, and other sources but talk about regions' dates if you want (most of these came out earlier in Japan). Please correct any mistakes or omissions, if there are any.\n\nAnd I left out the Atari 7800 because it didn't have any new games come out in this half year period, according to this: https://www.atariarchive.org/atari-7800-game-release-dates/\n\nFebruary\n\nTrojan (NES)\n\nAs a big fan of the Capcom arcade sword slasher, I was satisfied with this conversion despite the graphics/art style downgrade. It ran a lot more smoothly than the earlier port of Ghosts 'n Goblins. I think this was the first game I ever rented, too.\n\nMarch\n\nGreat Baseball (SMS)\n\nSega's \"Great\" sports series gets a bad rap today as it was surpassed by superior games later in the 8-bit era but this was arguably the best of the franchise, and for its time it was a high end baseball game.\n\nPro Wrestling (NES)\n\n\"A Winner is You\".\n\nShooting Gallery (SMS)\n\nThis overlooked light gun game was designed and programmed by Mark Cerny when he was at Sega of Japan. I enjoyed its animations and background destructability.\n\nSlalom (NES)\n\nWhile it lacked the unique body movement controls of the arcade version, it ran on NES-based hardware to begin with so there was no visual downgrade at home. Rare's slalom action was incredibly fast and smooth for a 3d view console game.\n\nSpace Harrier (SMS)\n\nIt obviously wasn't in the same technology league as the arcade version but Yuji Naka did an impressive job considering the hardware and it looked amazing for a home game at the time. And if you looked in the manual, it told you how to access the hidden options mode where you could play as a spaceship.\n\nVolleyball (NES)\n\nThis is my least played of the games in my post but it was a solid sports game from Nintendo with realistic ball physics. And it was a rare case of having the option to choose women's teams.\n\nApril\n\nQuartet (SMS)\n\nEven as a white boy in the '80s, I thought having a female lead character and a black man for player two was unique and cool. But demographics aside, the game's mix of platforming, shooting, co-op action, and sci-fi soundtrack by Katsuhiro Hayashi also made it stand out.\n\nRush 'n Attack (NES)\n\nBefore the NES had Contra, this was Konami's bad ass war action game. It was so satisfying the first time you grabbed that bazooka.\n\nTrack & Field (NES)\n\nI was more of an Epyx fan but Konami's multi-event sports package was nice, too.\n\nMay\n\nBurgerTime (NES)\n\nThis was the best port of the arcade game to date. I think most of us wanted something more \"current gen\" in 1987, though, as we played it death already on older systems like the Intellivision.\n\nCastlevania (NES)\n\nA major step forward for this style of action-platformer. Konami nailed the atmosphere, controls, music, and level design in a way that not only surpassed current games of the time but made it comparable to later efforts for the rest of the generation.\n\nGhostbusters (SMS)\n\nDeveloped by Compile, this received a major graphics overhaul from the Commodore 64 original by Activision although it did take a hit in the audio department.\n\nIkari Warriors (NES)\n\nI feel this was overshadowed in the home market by the more impressive Rambo game on SMS which was very similar and came out before it. Still, this wasn't a bad conversion of the SNK arcade game. Climbing into tanks and blasting enemies was still good fun.\n\nJune\n\nWonder Boy (SMS)\n\nSurprisingly close visually to the arcade game, this wasn't just the best looking platformer on the home market, it also felt fresh with its varied colourful landscapes, skateboarding sections, and diagonal scrolling. I also think the controls were refined a bit over the source material.\n\nIf I had to choose three games, it would be Castlevania and Wonder Boy because of the quality and my preference for platformers, and Quartet because it's a great co-op experience."
