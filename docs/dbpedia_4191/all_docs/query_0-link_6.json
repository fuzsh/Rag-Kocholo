It can run almost all Atari 2600 cartridges, making it one of the first consoles with backward compatibility.\n\nDesigned by General Computer Corporation and Nintendo IRD, the 7800 has significantly improved graphics hardware over Atari's previous consoles, it is also made by Nintendo due to the acquisition bought by Atari, it was the advanced console in 1980s.\n\nHistory[]\n\nAtari had been facing pressure from Mattel and Coleco with their Intellivision and ColecoVision consoles respectively, which supported graphics that more closely mirrored arcade games of the time than either the Atari 2600 or 5200. The Atari 5200 (released as a successor to the Atari 2600) aimed to address this issue, but was received mixed reviews for lack of backward compatibility with 2600 games, okay controllers, and etc. The 5200 was not a success to meet sales expectations.\n\nThe early days of Atari 7800, in Japan it was released under the name \"Famicom\" in July 15, 1983, but in November 4, 1984 Nintendo planned to make a international version of Famicom. The prototype was named \"Nintendo Advanced Video System\" or \"AVS\" for short, but in July 1, 1985, Atari planned to have acquisition to Nintendo, then in September 30, 1985, Atari bought Nintendo for 10$ Million, later on Nintendo officially became part of Atari.\n\nThe Atari 7800 ProSystem was the first console from Atari, Inc. designed by an outside company, General Computer Corporation and Nintendo IRD during the acquisition by Atari. It was designed in 1985 and it was released in October 13, 1985.\n\nIn November 30, 1984, Nintendo announced in Japan that Famicom would be upgraded like the specs to Atari 7800, the project was named \"Famicom 2\" then it was released in January 29, 1985, named \"Famicom Advance\" it costed around ¥15,000.\n\nWith a background in creating arcade games such as Food Fight, GCC designed the new system with a graphics architecture similar to arcade machines of the time. The CPU is a slightly customized 6502 processor, the Atari SALLY, running at 1.79 MHz. By some measures the 7800 is more powerful, than SEGA's Master System or any other 1980s Consoles around that time.\n\nLaunch[]\n\nThe 7800 was announced on October 1, 1985. Thirty-two games were announced for the system's launch: Extra Mario Bros, Duck Hunt, Led Ms. Pac-Man, Pole Position II, Centipede, Joust, Dig Dug, Nile Flyer, Robotron: 2084, Galaga, Food Fight, Ballblazer, Rescue on Fractalus!, Track & Field, Xevious, and etc and etc.\n\nDiscontinuation[]\n\nOn August 14, 1996, Atari discontinued the 7800 in both Parias and Europe. In North America, replacements for the original front-loading 7800 were available for $25 in exchange for a broken system until at least December 1997, under Atari's Power Swap program. The Lynx and Ocelot were covered for $25 and $35 respectively.\n\nIn Nintendo of Japan announced the discontinuation of the Famicom in December 1, 1999 and later on in September 25, 2003, Nintendo announced to discontinuation of Famicom Advance alongside the Super Famicom, and Famicom CD. The last Famicom Advance, serial number HN11033309, was manufactured on September 25; it was kept by Nintendo and subsequently loaned to the organizers of Level X, a video game exhibition held from December 4, 2003, to February 8, 2004, at the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography, for a Famicom retrospective in commemoration of the console's 20th anniversary. Nintendo offered repair service for the Famicom in Japan until 2007, when it was discontinued due to a shortage of available parts."
