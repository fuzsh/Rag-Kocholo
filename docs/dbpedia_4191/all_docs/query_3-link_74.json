        "text": "I found from a video on botched console launches that the Atari 7800 was originally supposed to be released in 1984, but got delayed till after the NES release because the console division of Atari was sold to Jack Tramiel, then it got caught in legal scuffles among Warner, General Computer Corporation and Jack Tramiel. Before release, it was praised that it could be the console to revive the video game market after the crash, according to that video.\n\nSo if Atari 7800 was released in 1984, what would happen? Which route is most likely?\n\nOption 1: No, it doesn’t revive the video game market; people still hate video game consoles and more advanced graphics won’t do it.\n\nNintendo comes in in 1985, releases the NES with R.O.B. in America, then everything after that follows OTL.\n\nOption 2: Yes, it revives the video game market.\n\nOption 2.1: But when NES releases in 1985, it quickly overtakes Atari, then everything after that follows OTL.\n\nOption 2.2: Atari becomes the video game market leader in America, with Nintendo and Sega trailing behind.\n\nOption 2.2.1: But because Atari is too lax over 3rd party releases, the video game market gets flooded with crap, only filtering out the absolute worst games.\n\nOption 2.2.1.1: This causes another video game crash. Now I’m not sure what happens to console gaming in America for the rest of history.\n\nOption 2.2.1.2: Somehow, the video game market remains completely fine despite this (like what happened with Sony’s open policy for the PlayStation). This cements Atari as the industry leader for the generation. Go to what follows Option 2.2.2.\n\nOption 2.2.2: 3rd parties have learnt their lesson as well, so they make sure their games are at least decent quality. This cements Atari as the industry leader for the generation.\n\nThis leads to a very split video game market, with Nintendo leader of Japan, Atari leader of America and Sega leader of Europe.\n\nNot sure if Atari will maintain the lead in America, if Sega actively takes the lead with a campaign like “Genesis is what Atarisn’t”, or if Atari simply screws themselves up without external factors like OTL.\n\n​\n\nThe problem with releasing the 7800 early is not only the limited game line-up (the initial launch titles are 1980-83 arcade and former Atari console games) but the fact they'd be competing against themselves (2600 and 5200) as well as not solving the most glaring issue: the damn shovelware that killed the popularity of gaming. Nintendo overcame this by requiring games to be licensed for play on their system (guaranteed by a chip and Nintendo having sole rights to manufacture cartridges). Atari will not be as extreme so you'll likely still have bad games coupled with the insanity of juggling multiple systems; ask SEGA how that went with their Genesis/CD/32X.\n\nIt took several years to clean out the foul taste of gaming following the 1983 collapse. On top of that, Atari was a tainted brand in most stores following '83. No one thought people wanted video games anymore. That's why Nintendo created Robbie the Robot: to claim it was a toy that came with games, not a gaming system with a peripheral.\n\nAdd in the financial struggles Atari had. How are they going to market this, especially after the awful controllers of the 5200? Will the stock holders of Warner Bros. revolt at this continued nonsense following Coleco and others pulling out and rushing to computers instead?\n\nhe limited game line-up (the initial launch titles are 1980-83 arcade and former Atari console games) but the fact they'd be competing against themselves (2600 and 5200) as well as not solving the most glaring issue: the damn shovelware that killed the popularity of gaming.

Atari will not be as extreme so you'll likely still have bad games coupled with the insanity of juggling multiple systems; ask\n\nAtari did have a lock for the new 7800 cartridges.\n\nIt still was a mistake, the 7800 should have been what the later XEGS was, a real 6502 Atari 400/800 8 bit in a Console case, in 1982 or 1983, not 1987 when the 8 bit was at the end.\n\nThey had no good games is the problem. When you have Konami and Capcom at their prime for the competition, well...\n\nPlenty of decent 400/800 games around in 1984 that looked good, and the 800 was already a known platform for developing and porting.\n\nIt's just that the 2600 should have been stopped at that time, rather than still selling new units, and with games that worse and worse each year, and the 5200 should have never been made the way it was.\n\nAtari made so many mistakes.\n\nPlenty of decent 400/800 games around in 1984 that looked good, and the 800 was already a known platform for developing and porting.\n\nIt's just that the 2600 should have been stopped at that time, rather than still selling new units, and with games that worse and worse each year, and the 5200 should have never been made the way it was.\n\nAtari made so many mistakes.\n\nWish Bushnell had never been constrained by his no-compete clause. So many ideas that ended up being delayed until they were too late: cheaper arcade machines via exchanging the boards rather than buying a whole machine, a crude Teddy Ruxpin, pushing tech rather than relying on old gear and falling behind. In fact, I believe he attempted to buy Atari when it went on sale but the powers that be adamantly refused to sell to him. Foolishly Jack Tramiel swindled them by getting Warners to effectively give him a loan to buy Atari. Gotta love how Jack kept getting free deals from companies."
