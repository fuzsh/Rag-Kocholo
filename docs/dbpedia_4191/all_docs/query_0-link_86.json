        "text": "The market was on a significant uptick after the release of the Nintendo Entertainment System, and Atari wanted in on it after having themselves crashed the market earlier. Their prior customers weren’t having it and this new 7800 edition was mostly ignored despite being more powerful than their previous iterations. People were generally done with Atari hardware, and the competition (namely from Nintendo but also Sega) absolutely crushed it. It wasn’t very good.\n\nOfficial Name: Atari 7800\n\nRelease Date:\n\nUS: 1986\n\nEU: 1987\n\nPower: 8-bit\n\nMedia Type: Cartridge"
