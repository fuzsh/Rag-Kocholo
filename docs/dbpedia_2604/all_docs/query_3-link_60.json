        "text": "The Cure opened its three-night stand at the famed Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles on Tuesday night by debuting another new song: “Another Happy Birthday.”\n\nRobert Smith had promised to reveal details of The Cure’s concerts in Mexico and South America by the end of April, and though that deadline came and went.\n\nThe Cure today once again expanded its Shows of a Lost World 2023 tour in North America, adding what Robert Smith called “one last extra show.”\n\nThe Cure this morning announced its first North American tour in seven years, with plans to bring its “Shows of a Lost World” trek to the U.S. and Canada.\n\nSimon Gallup, 61, made the announcement in a public post on his personal Facebook page, writing: “With a slightly heavy heart I am no longer a member of the Cure! Good luck to them all…” In response to someone asking if he was OK, he replied that he “just got fed up of betrayal.” More here.\n\nRobert Smith waited until The Cure’s last song late Saturday night to deliver his own verdict on the Pasadena Daydream festival, his hand-picked 10-band bill that took over the sprawling golf course next to the Rose Bowl under a scorching Southern California sun. “It’s been the best day of the summer,” Smith said.\n\nDespite laying down hints that American audiences would see The Cure play Disintegration in full later this year, Robert Smith made it clear in a radio interview Friday that it’s unlikely that’ll happen — and the band isn’t planning to mount a tour of the U.S. before 2020. Instead, the band’s planning a festival in L.A.\n\nThe Cure’s Robert Smith — with an assist by the band’s keyboardist Roger O’Donnell — has recorded a new version of the classic Disintegration track “Pictures of You” with the London-based Quartet Voluté for the new documentary “Dead Good.” You can hear the new version in the film’s trailer.\n\nRobert Smith and nine other members of The Cure past and present were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Nine Inch Nails’ Trent Reznor at a ceremony in Brooklyn tonight that also saw the band’s current lineup play a five-song set. See video of the speeches and performances right here.\n\nRobert Smith called into Sirius XM this week to chat about The Cure’s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame next year, and, along the way, revealed that work is nearing completion on the band’s first new album since 2008 and a Tim Pope-shot film of the group’s huge 40th anniversary concert in London.\n\nThe Rock and Roll Hall of Fame’s Class of 2019 will include one of the titans of alternative rock: The Cure, the dark-pop juggernaut that just celebrated its 40th anniversary and next year will be inducted alongside Roxy Music, Janet Jackson, Radiohead and more. Full details on next year’s inductees right here."
