        "text": "Musician Roger O’Donnell has announced that he is working on his first film score.\n\nThe Cure’s keyboardist confirmed this news via his Twitter account, announcing that he “just delivered the 27 cues for my first movie score”.\n\n“Very exciting and will share the details when I can. What an experience”, O’Donnell added.\n\nOne fan begged O’Donnell to “tell him more”, however Roger stated that he “can’t”.\n\nEarlier this year, Robert Smith had confirmed that the Cure were working on a couple of new albums.\n\nThe band will be hoping to release them before they begin their UK and European Tour in October.\n\n“The first Cure album is relentless doom and gloom. It’s the doomiest thing that we’ve ever done. The second one is upbeat, and my [solo] one won’t be out until next year”, Smith said.\n\nBack in June, the Cure also announced plans to release a special 30th anniversary edition of their album ‘Wish’.\n\nRemastered by Robert Smith and Mike Shovell at Abbey Road Studios, this album will arrive on October 7.\n\nThe album will feature 20 previously unreleased demos, along with a previously unreleased track called ‘A Wendy Band’. This track was recorded during the Cure’s sessions at Manor Studios in 1992."
