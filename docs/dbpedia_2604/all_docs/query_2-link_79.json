        "text": "“Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something tragic”\n\n(Extract from ‘The Picture of Dorian Gray’ written by Oscar Wilde)\n\nThe next edition of the blog’s ‘Inside The Album’ series is about a record which has the utmost sentimental value to me and I’ve gone to great lengths in order to add it to my collection. Regular readers might have noticed that the album title has become a reusable mantra in various posts. Although a neo-romantic album might seem worlds apart from the usual drum & bass features, I’d still hope that the timeless theme and the mesmerizing modern classical interpretation of concepts like hubris, jealousy, deception, self-sacrifice, devotion, grief, spent ideals, redemption and immortality, which have inspired philosophy, literature, music, cinema and countless works of art, might have an appeal to you too.\n\nI have been a fan of Roger O’Donnell since his glory days with The Cure. In 2005 his work with the band ended and O’Donnell alongside Canadian composer Erin Lang established 99X/10 Records (99 times out of 10) as a platform to promote their piano compositions, as well as new musical projects. Fast forward a decade later, Roger O’Donnell announced a collaborative album with renowned cellist and film score composer Julia Kent, who has also performed with Rasputina, Anthony & The Johnsons and recently featured on Bicep’s album ‘Isles’. I was very intrigued by the album’s title, vision and concept, which revolves around three classical love stories. From ancient Greek mythology and the seductive mystery of Middle East to medieval chivalry, these are stories which have passed on through generations; edited, altered and restructured to reflect peoples’ dreams, expectations, lives and the culture of each given time.\n\nRegrettably and sadly I had missed the limited edition vinyl when it came out, so I had to settle for the digital version. About 2 years ago, while playing ‘Love & Other Tragedies’ on my laptop, my daughter, who’s an aspiring ballet dancer, started an impromptu choreography upon listening to the song ‘Marke’. Then she casually asked me if I owned the respective record. Naturally, my OCD kicked in and I promised on the spot that I would give her the record as a present to re-capture and treasure that moment forever, assuming that I was only a few clicks away. Alas, the album had obviously sold out in every known and unknown outlet and not a trace of a second-hand copy in the marketplace too. The days went by, still no copy in sight and that promise gradually became an obsession. Things escalated, when I contacted O’Donnell’s management, who were unable to help. Then a few months ago a seller from Boston, US listed a copy, which was not available in Greece. Undeterred, I contacted him and eventually convinced him to send it to Greece at a ‘reasonable’ price, despite the recent misadventures I’ve had this year with customs clearance fees and unprecedented delays. To cut a long story short, the record arrived intact from US hassle-free within a week. Meant to be I guess …\n\nRoger O’Donnell feat. Julia Kent – Love and Other Tragedies (99X/10, 2005)\n\nBackground story and liner notes:\n\nRoger O’Donnell was introduced to cellist Julia Kent after Italian photographer Giulio Di Mauro commissioned a new version of the story of ‘Scheherazade’ as part of his ‘Post Romantic Empire’ project. Originally planned as an essay about the inheritance of the Romantic revolution in the contemporary world, the ‘Post Romantic Empire’ after three years in the making ended up becoming a project which focused on event organization and artist bookings, a recording label and a photographic safari; a labour of passion, lost love and tragedy.\n\nO’Donnell and Kent collaborated on the ‘Scheherazade’ suite, which is written in three movements for piano and 4 cellos, and decided to explore this liaison further adding two more love stories to the narrative. The original idea was to write one story each, but due to their conflicting touring schedule, Roger took over the composition. The approach however remained the same: three movements representing three crucial plot points, setting the mood and the stage for the stories to unravel; an open rather than a literal interpretation.\n\nThe parts were recorded in O’Donnell’s ‘The Pear Tree’ studio in rural Devon and Julia’s studio in New York; a stark contrast of surroundings balanced by a mutual understanding of emotion and drama, dialogue being redundant. When the recordings finished, the songs were mixed by Paul Corkett in Bath and mastered by Guy Davie at Electric Mastering, London. The artwork and layout of the limited gatefold white vinyl double album are designed by art illustrator and frequent collaborator Anna Dorfman. The outer sleeve of the LP is printed on matte stock, with the title laminated in clear gloss. The inside cover photography is by Australian photographer Romain Duquesne and additional styling by artist Joddy Knowles.\n\nVariation 1: Tristan & Isolde – Love and Devotion\n\nTristan / Isolde / Marke\n\nThe legend of Tristan & Isolde is the tragic tale of two lovers, Cornish knight Tristan and Irish princess Isolde, fated to share a forbidden but undying love; a chivalric romance told in numerous variations since the 12th century. Although the details vary wildly between authors and generations, the plot structure remains more or less the same. The narrative predates the Arthurian romance of Lancelot and Guinevere and by the 13th century the story of Tristan had been interwoven with the Arthurian legends. Tristan had become a noble knight and appeared in some of the stories about Arthur, Lancelot and the Knights of the Round Table. Storytellers had also begun to portray King Mark as cruel or coward, perhaps to create a stronger contrast between Mark and Tristan.\n\nAccording to one of the most detailed versions of the legend, the King of Ireland sent to Cornwall his brother and fierce warrior Morholt to collect tribute payments owed to his country. Tristan, the champion and nephew of King Mark of Cornwall, fought Morholt in a single combat on the remote Saint Samson’s Isle in order to release his people from the debt. Tristan mortally wounded Morholt, leaving a piece of his sword blade in the wound, but Morholt managed to stab Tristan with a poisoned spear and escaped to Ireland to die. The injured Tristan eventually also travels to Ireland incognito to seek treatment from the proficient healer Princess Isolde.\n\nAfter Isolde healed him, Tristan lingered at the Irish court for a while. On his return to Cornwall, he praised Isolde so highly that King Mark resolved to marry her. Loyal and obedient to his uncle and king, Tristan agreed to return to Ireland and seek Isolde’s hand for Mark. Whether Tristan and Isolde had already feelings for each other remains unknown, but the real drama began during their voyage to Cornwall. Isolde’s mother had prepared a magical love potion for her daughter to share with Mark and ensure eternal love between them. Without knowing the real nature of the potion Isolde and Tristan drank it and fell deeply in love.\n\nDespite her profound love for Tristan, Isolde went through with the marriage to Mark. They tried to keep their passion a secret, but without success. Some accounts contain episodes of intrigue and suspense in which King Mark or members of his entourage tried to obtain proof of their guilt. Eventually Tristan fled Cornwall hopelessly and settled in Britanny, where he married another Isolde, known as Isolde of the White Hands.\n\nHis love for Isolde of Cornwall had never died, though. When Tristan was wounded in battle and his wound was pestering he sent for Isolde of Cornwall, hoping that she could once again heal him. He requested that the ship coming back from Cornwall should have white sails if it carried Isolde and black ones if it did not (a motif reminiscent of the Greek legend of King Aegeus of Athens, father of hero Theseus). Tristan lay on his sickbed and waited. Finally the ship appeared on the horizon, bearing white sails. Too sick to sit up, Tristan asked about the color of the sails. Jealous of his passion for the first Isolde, his wife lied and said that they were black. Tristan fell into despair, believing that Isolde had refused to help him and died. When Isolde arrived and learned of his death, she too died of grief. The two were buried in Cornwall. From Isolde’s grave a rose tree grew, and from Tristan’s came a vine that wrapped itself around the tree. Every time the vine was cut, it grew again; a sign that the two lovers could not be parted in death.\n\nThe legend has been immortalized in the eponymous Richard Wagner opera.\n\nVariation 2: Scheherazade – Le Triomphe de l’Amour sur la Haine\n\nLe Roi / La Princesse / Les Deux\n\nMuch like Aesop’s Tales and the Brothers Grimm stories in Europe, ‘One Thousand and One Nights’ is a collection of tales told in Asia. After centuries of these stories being verbal only, storytellers started to compile them and eventually form what we know today as the ‘One Thousand and One Nights’ (or, as it’s often referred to in English, ‘Arabian Nights’).\n\nEven though not entirely thematically suited for young ones, most children brought up in South East Asia and the Middle East are familiar with those stories. Some of the most popular tales are familiar across the world, including those Ali Baba & the Forty Thieves and Aladdin’s Lamp. Though Aladdin, as we know the story, is not part of the original 1001 tales, the motifs presented within his story – magical flying carpet, wish-granting genie – are heavily represented in other tales.\n\nOnce upon a time, a sultan of a big and powerful empire left his castle to embark on a hunting trip. Returning unexpectedly early, he caught his beloved wife in bed with servants. Enraged, he beheaded them on the spot. Blinded with rage and engrossed in feelings of betrayal he vowed to take revenge on all womankind by beginning a monstrous tradition: he would take a new virgin wife every night, only to behead her the following morning effectively depriving her from the chance to ever cheat on him. The sultan’s madness rendered the kingdom a hostile place for all young women. Families fled elsewhere with their daughters, as the sultan continued with his rage-filled murder streak. Sick with worry, the sultan’s vizier urged his daughters to leave. He had to stay in the capital and fulfil his duties, but his two daughters, Scheherazade and Dunyazad, could flee. Enter stage right, Scheherazade refuses to leave and instead insists on becoming the sultan’s next bride. Despite her father’s desperate attempts to change her mind, Scheherazade and the sultan got married.\n\nOn their first wedding night, as a last wish, Scheherazade begged for her sister’s company. Dunyazad joined them and she requested one last tale from her sister. With the sultan’s approval, Scheherazade started her very first story. So captivating and mesmerizing were her charm and her storytelling capabilities, it was almost dawn before anyone realized. Clever Scheherazade ended the night’s storytelling on a cliffhanger, leaving her audience on edge, wanting more. The sultan was so enthralled by Scheherazade’s story that he allowed her to live one extra night to finish it.\n\nOf course, the following night she finished the first story and began another one. She continued this night after night, always ending on a tantalizing twist. Scheherazade continued telling her tales for a thousand and one nights, and in that time the sultan slowly started to fall for her beauty, charm and intelligence. He eventually saw the error of his ways and the injustices he’d wrought. Professing his true love for Scheherazade, they finally began a life together. The bloodlust stopped and peace was restored.\n\nVariation 3: Orpheus & Eurydice – L’Amore Cierco per Sempre Perduto\n\nLa Ninfa / Romanza / Regno Dei Morti\n\nOrpheus is an archetypal character in Greek ancient religion and mythology, whose real existence is still debated. A legendary musician, poet and prophet, Orpheus had the divine ability to charm living and inanimate objects with his music. The most famous story in which Orpheus figures is his attempt to retrieve his wife Eurydice from the Underworld, which has been portrayed or alluded to in countless forms of art and popular culture including poetry, film, opera, music, and paintings.\n\nAt their wedding day, Eurydice, in her attempt to escape a satyr’s moves, fell into a pit of vipers and a bite at her heel proved fatal. Orpheus discovered her body and overcome with grief, played such a sad and mournful song that all the nymphs and gods wept. On their advice, Orpheus traveled to the underworld. His music softened the hearts of the Underworld rulers Hades and Persephone, who agreed to allow Eurydice to return with him to earth on one condition: he should walk in front of her and not look back, until they both had reached the upper world. Orpheus set off with Eurydice following; however, as soon as he had reached the surface, he immediately turned to look at her, forgetting in his eagerness that both of them needed to be in the upper world for the condition to be met. As Eurydice had not yet crossed the border, she vanished for the second time, this time forever.\n\nThere’s another version of the story which sheds a more negative light to Orpheus’ journey to the underworld, but is still worth mentioning. According to Phaedrus in Plato’s Symposium, the infernal gods only presented an apparition of Eurydice to him. In fact, Plato’s representation of Orpheus is that of a coward, as instead of choosing to die in order to be with the one he loved, he defied the gods by trying to descend to Hades and bring her back alive. Since his love was not pure – he did not want to die for love – he was actually punished by the gods, first by giving him only the apparition of his former wife in the underworld and then by being killed by women. According to a summary from a lost play by prominent tragic poet Aeschylus, Orpheus, towards the end of his life, disdained the worship of all gods except the sun. One early morning he went to the oracle of god Dionysus at Mount Pangaion to pray to his god at dawn, but was ripped to shreds by Thracian Maenads for not honoring his previous patron Dionysus. The story of Orpheus is strikingly relevant to the ancient Greek tales of Persephone captured by Hades and similar stories of Adonis being captive in the underworld.\n\nA Night of Exquisite Tragedy"
