They are forward-thinking and driven to achieve their goals, but they can also be easily irritated by stubbornness and indecisiveness.\n\nKey Personality Traits:\n\nRomanticism and Escapism:\n\nThey possess a strong sense of romance and often seek refuge in imaginative worlds to escape from reality.\n\nDetermination and Goal-Oriented:\n\nThey are highly motivated and persistent in pursuing their objectives.
