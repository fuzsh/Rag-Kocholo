        "text": "THE CURE\n\n\"Friday I'm In Love\" from the album \"Wish\"\n\nSHORT BIOGRAPHY:\n\nVelvet Underground was formed in Crawley 1976. Vocalist, guitarist, and principal songwriter Robert Smith has been the only constant member.\n\nIn 1978 they released their debut single \"Killing an Arab\" and debut the album \"Three Imaginary Boys\" came out in 1979. They were from the beginning an important act in the post-punk and new wave movements in the United Kingdom.\n\nFollowing the release of the album Pornography in 1982, the band's future was uncertain. Smith was keen to move past the gloomy reputation his band had acquired, introducing a greater pop sensibility into the band's music. Songs such as \"Let's Go to Bed\" (1982), \"Just Like Heaven\" (1987), \"Lovesong\" (1989), and \"Friday I'm in Love\" (1992) aided the band in receiving commercial popularity. The band is estimated to have sold roughly 27 million records as of 2004 and have released thirteen studio albums, ten EPs, and over thirty singles to date.\n\nsource: Wikipedia\n\nKey Band Members:\n\nRobert Smith: Born 1959, guitar, vocals and songwriter.
