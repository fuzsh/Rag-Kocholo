        "text": "This story was originally published on June 16, 2019.\n\nLAS VEGAS – This is a story of father and son. Many years separated them. A love of photography bonded them.\n\nThe father wandered on horseback through the wreckage of 1945 Japan, photographing rubble and incinerated bodies after the nuclear explosions of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs – unspeakable images that would forever haunt him.\n\nThe son took a different path, riding a motorcycle through the American West on a Jack Kerouac journey to find a home, using his dad’s old camera to photograph the good in life.\n\nWhere the father saw horror through his camera lens, the son sought mostly beauty.\n\nHere’s the story of the emotional fallout of documenting one of the darkest moments of the 20th century told through the relationship of two photographers.\n\nThe father\n\nJoe O’Donnell joined the Marines at the outbreak of World War II and got to pick between two jobs: Paratrooper or photographer.\n\nA native of Johnstown, Pennsylvania, O’Donnell had shot photos for his local newspaper. The military gave him a camera and sent him overseas to be one of the first outsiders to visit Japan after its destruction by atomic bomb.\n\nIn September 1945, the young man arrived in Japan with his camera gear. Days earlier, the United States had dropped two bombs on Nagasaki and Hiroshima – an attack that resulted in the deaths of more than 100,000 people.\n\nO’Donnell prepared the best he could to capture the scene.\n\nIn the accordion bellows of his military camera he smuggled Lucky Strike cigarettes and Hershey’s chocolate bars to use as peace offerings for the traumatized Japanese men, women and children he photographed.\n\nHe traded some of those cigarettes for a horse he could ride through destruction zones. He called the horse Boy.\n\nAnd out he went, unsure what he would find.\n\nThe faces of war\n\nA Japanese boy going to the crematorium carrying his dead brother on his shoulder.\n\nThe charred body of a Japanese teenager who'd lived to show his scars as proof of the atrocities.\n\nBuildings toppled. Debris scattered. Cities destroyed.\n\nO’Donnell photographed them all.\n\nAfter the war, he kept his photos in a trunk. They were too painful to look at.\n\nHe would not revisit those images for nearly 45 years – an unearthing that would ultimately undo his marriage.\n\nThe son\n\nIn 1969, when the father was 48, he had a third son. His name was Tyge O’Donnell.\n\n“He was kind of an old father,” said Tyge, now 49, who has worked as a Las Vegas bellman for 23 years.\n\nBy the time Tyge was of ball-tossing age, he said, his father’s bones were bad from all the years he put on them, a lawnmower accident – and radiation exposure from his time in Japan.\n\n“I’d be in school in 6th or 7th grade,” Tyge said, “and I’d be like, ‘My dad was in World War II.”\n\nNo one believed him. Until his history class turned to a chapter on Japan, and Tyge’s dad dug up pictures he captured on horseback for his son to take to school.\n\n\"My teacher wanted my dad to speak to the class,\" Tyge said.\n\nLife through a lens\n\nInside the O’Donnell house, there were plenty of cameras.\n\nJoe O’Donnell would always buy his wife, Ellen, the latest point-and-shoot model. They’d usually end up in a drawer. One day, Tyge found his mom’s abandoned Kodak Starmite, a compact camera that shot square photos.\n\nThe mother granted the son permission to adopt the device, and Tyge started shooting. He never stopped.\n\nHe still has the first picture he ever took: The flagpole in front of his childhood home in Michigan, motion blur and all.\n\nIn 1979, the O’Donnell family packed up and moved to Tennessee.\n\n“I didn’t belong there,” the son said.\n\nBut Tyge soon discovered an outlet for his photography – the high school yearbook staff. His interest caught his father’s attention.\n\nAt the time, Joe O’Donnell was shooting with a Canon A-E1, considered a game-changer camera in the photography world.\n\nHe happened to have a standby – a 35 millimeter Pentax Spotmatic – to spare his youngest boy.\n\nOn the road\n\nIn the early 1990s, Tyge remained restless. Then in his early 20s, he still yearned for something more – a desire, he believed, a westward journey could cure.\n\nTyge decided to hop on his Kawasaki motorcycle and zig-zag around the country. As a kid, he dreamed of living in a cabin somewhere in Colorado, where he could slap a winch on a Jeep and pull the stranded from the snow. As a young man, he wanted to see so much more.\n\nHis mother worried. His father handed him his old Canon A-E1.\n\nTyge hit the road, taking pictures along the way, and found a new destination: Las Vegas.\n\nMeanwhile, Joe O’Donnell prepared to take a trip of his own – into a past that would forever change his future.\n\nThe photos in the trunk\n\nThe breaking apart of the marriage began with a weathered footlocker.\n\nIt was the early 1990s, and Joe O’Donnell had a new project: assembling an exhibit of his Japan photos for the 50th anniversary of the Nagasaki and Hiroshima bombings.\n\nAfter the war, O’Donnell worked as a United States Information Agency photographer assigned to document the administrations of Harry Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon. The work kept him busy, but he could never shake his memories of Japan.\n\nBack in Tennessee, retired and on disability after a car accident during a presidential motorcade, he gave himself fully to the photos in the footlocker.\n\nEllen O’Donnell watched the man she married slowly slip into an obsession that would collapse their 32-year marriage.\n\n“He got very involved in it,” she told the USA Today Network from Nashville. “It was like his personality changed. I don’t know whether he ran into a depression, but it affected him.”\n\nAll over the house, he had pinned his photos from the post-bomb Japanese cities. The home soon felt like a funeral parlor.\n\n“It was 24/7 with all this Japanese stuff in the house,” Ellen O’Donnell said. “That kind of tore us apart.”\n\nEllen eventually left. They continued their lives separate and divorced – a change that would allow them both to find happiness elsewhere. They both remarried, Ellen to a man from Tennessee – and Joe to a woman from Japan.\n\nNevertheless, there was no bitterness.\n\nEllen remembers Joe as charismatic, hardworking and passionate about subjects that moved him. Photography was one. Being a good father, she said, was another.\n\nJoe O’Donnell’s photos were displayed for the first time in Europe and Japan, and in 2005 they were put into a book published by Vanderbilt University Press, \"Japan 1945: A U.S. Marine's Photographs from Ground Zero.\"\n\nHe would gain recognition around the world for his wartime photos – but the attention came with controversy that demanded the son to rise up as a protector of his father's legacy.\n\nA failing memory\n\nOn Aug. 9, 2007, the 62nd anniversary of the Nagasaki bombings, Joseph Roger O’Donnell died of a stroke. He was 85.\n\nIn his long life, photography had scalded his sensibilities. It ended a past marriage. And in his final years, his tragic art took a stab at his reputation.\n\nThe New York Times ran an obituary that included a photo credited to O'Donnell that showed John F. Kennedy Jr. saluting at his father’s 1963 funeral. But another photographer claimed the photo was his – a controversy that called to question other images and events O'Donnell claimed to photograph.\n\nThe mix-up, according to the son, was a matter of a failing memory.\n\n“He would kind of just get lost in his sentences,” Tyge O’Donnell said of his dad’s later years. “He went to the laundromat to pick up his laundry – he’d pay for it and just walk out, get home and realize he didn’t pick up the laundry.\"\n\nAfter an initial stroke landed Joe O’Donnell in the hospital, he escaped.\n\n“They found him in his gown a few blocks away,” Tyge said. “He was going fight with Hitler in Germany. He thought he was part of the Nazi Third Reich, and he had to get back to his German troop.”\n\nTyge shook his head. “That kind of shows you,” he said.\n\nA son's lesson\n\nThe father has been dead many years, but the son thinks of him every time he frames a photo in the camera viewfinder.\n\nTyge O’Donnell has had a long union career in bell service. In his spare time, he shoots photos as a freelancer – a side hustle he's working to flip into a career he always wanted. His clients include Zip Code Magazines and lvsportsbiz.com, where he has published photos of the Vegas Golden Knights on the ice.\n\nWhen he aims his camera – and he still shoots with a Canon – he keeps in mind his father’s best advice.\n\n“Get the shot no one else is getting,” he said. “Get the shot that’s going to stand out – go where the other photographers are not.”\n\nIt’s a philosophy he’s used throughout his life, a mindset that led the son across America on a motorcycle – a spirit that led the father through fallout fields on a horse named Boy.\n\nTyge O’Donnell and Joe O’Donnell may not have talked on the phone every day or played catch on a ballfield or traded stories of their journeys as young men trying to find their place in the world – but they shared a sense of comfort behind the viewfinder.\n\n“It was in my blood at a young age,” Tyge said.\n\nThat turned out to be the father’s greatest gift to his son: a drive to capture life one moment – and one photograph – at a time.\n\nAs far as the son is concerned, the haunting photos from his father's footlocker will forever remain windows into history – portals to a past he hopes will never repeat.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report."
