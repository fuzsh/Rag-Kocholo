In addition to his work playing in bands (including The Psychedelic Furs, Thompson Twins, and Berlin), OâDonnell has released a number of solo recordings and collaborations with other artists. Though he has a long history as a Moog synthesizer expert and enthusiast, OâDonnellâs back catalog consists of a wide variety of styles and genres, including pieces written for the piano as well as work conceived for strings and chamber orchestras. In April of 2020 he released 2 Ravens, a record made in collaboration with vocalist Jennifer Pague that is meant to bring to life the melancholic beauty and solitude of the English countryside."
