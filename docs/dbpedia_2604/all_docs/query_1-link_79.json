        "text": "The memory of Roger O'Donnell from Ballylanders will be kept alive in the mountains, as those taking part in this year's Galtee Challenge Walk in aid of Limerick MS, will be saying prayers for him and paying tribute to him, after his sad and unexpected passing last year.\n\nThe walk was the brainchild of Roger and Tom Hayes and with Roger's vast knowledge of the Galtees, the walk grew from 50 particpants in the first year to 325 last year and to date, they have raised more than €70,000 for the Limerick branch of the MS Society.\n\nThis year's walk will be very hard for the participants, as it is the first year that Roger will not be taking part. To add to this, MS sufferer, PJ Richardson from Doon also sadly passed away last year and so this year's walk will be an emotional one with great resonance, as the walkers will pay tribute to two great men who made the walk what it is today.\n\nRoger was the eldest of 11 children and he passed away in October of 2012. His brother Bill said that what the walk has become is a great credit to both Roger and Tom. He said that the walkers will also be joined by the Ballyhoura Bears Walking Club of which he is a member and the Tipperary Hill Walking Club, as well as others.\n\nHe added that a lot of family members are coming home particularly for the walk and he said that the barbecue afterwards in Doon is always warmly welcomed by the tired, but exhilirated walkers.\n\nGarryspillane GAA Club members said that Roger grew up on a farm and from an early age, he loved the land and the mountains. He had a keen interest in history and sports and was founding member of both Ballinvreena Historical Society and Kilclooney Historical Society.\n\nRoger also drove the community bus for the senior citizens on their trips into Mitchelstown on a Thursday.\n\nRoger's nephew and Munster rugby player, Tommy O'Donnell also plans to take part with some of the other Munster players. While Roger's family always took part, this year more of the extended family members will be joining them to pay a fitting tribute to the man who has been described by many as 'a gentle giant'.\n\nThe Galtee Challenge Walk will take place on Saturday, June 1 at 10.30am from Skeheenarinky and the organisers would like to thank the landowners who very kindly allow them the use of their land for parking. Sponsorship cards are available from the Limerick MS office on 061-303802 or from Tom Hayes 086-8365930. All support would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThe Galtee Challenge Walk will also be signposted from The Firgrove Hotel in Mitchelstown, directing people through Kilbehenny and Skeheenarinky, before taking a left turn for the Galtees."
