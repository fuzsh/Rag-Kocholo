        "text": "We continue to repost the adventures of The Putto (after the site was taken down by hackers) and recently re-uploaded our ‘Disintegratio‘ story with guest art by Raluca Moldovan.\n\nThe story pays homage to The Cure’s Disintegration album.\n\nWhilst writing the piece we made contact with Roger O’Donnell of The Cure. Alongside his work in the British supergroup, Roger has produced an excellent body of solo work.\n\nTaking a huge long shot we got in touch with Roger and asked if he would compose a piece for The Cure themed issue and, much to our amazement and awe, the stars were aligned in the heavens and he agreed to do so.\n\nTo hear the beautiful piece – appropriately titled ‘Evensong’ – simply launch our pop up player or click on our Soundtrack page and follow the instructions.\n\nWe encourage our readers to find out more about Roger’s latest musical projects at his website: http://www.rogerodonnell.com/\n\nFor the very best news about The Cure visit Chain of Flowers.\n\nThanks again to Roger for his kindness. We look forward to seeing him play with The Cure this December in London. They never fail to deliver."
