OâDonnell was fully integrated into the band for the next album Disintegration. His songwriting contributions can also be heard on âOut of Mindâ (the B-Sides of the hit singles âLullabyâ, and âLovesongâ) Entreat, a live album that he recorded during this time, also features OâDonnell. OâDonnell quit The Cureâs Prayer Tour 1989 and returned to the band in 1990.\n\nOâDonnellâs current solo career commenced when he was asked to submit a song for a documentary being made about Bob Moog, âMoogâ. This was in early 2004 whilst he was still a member of The Cure. Later that year whilst helping to promote the film with its producer Ryan Page at the Sheffield Documentary Festival, conversation led to the suggestion that OâDonnell should write an entire album of music composed and recorded in the same way as the song âAnother Year Awayâ. The song was composed entirely and performed solely on a Minimoog Voyager.\n\nIn summer 2005, OâDonnell and his longtime partner and collaborator Erin Lang formed their own label with the idea of supporting and encouraging otherwise unsignable artists, mainly in the electronic genre, and releasing their own music. The first release was in September 2005, a sampler âNothing Concreteâ featuring songs from 10 unsigned artists. The label is called 99 Times Out of 10 or 99X/10.\n\nAfter being friends for many years with Boris Williams, OâDonnell joined The Cure for the first time in 1987. OâDonnell was a part of The Cureâs Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me Tour, but he didnât contribute to the album. He does appear in music videos for âJust Like Heavenâ (and âHot Hot Hot !!!â). He also appeared in promotional art. Porl Thompson could focus full-time on guitar instead of assisting Tolhurst with keyboards for many songs. OâDonnell was the keyboard player. You can hear some of OâDonnellâs performances on this tour in the deluxe edition Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me.\n\nOâDonnell joined Thompson Twins in July 1983 as a live keyboardist. He was playing with future Cure drummer Boris Williams. OâDonnell and Williams both completed the Side Kicks Tour 1983, as well as the Into the Gap/Out of the Gap tours 1984. OâDonnell loved Sequential Circuits synthesisers in the 1980s. He was a fan of the Prophet T8 and Prophet VS. OâDonnell, while on tour with the Psychedelic furs, set the record for having the largest number of Sequential models at once.\n\nDuring the period of the Cureâs greatest success, OâDonnell was the bandâs only member to play piano and keyboards as his primary instrument. Previous keyboardist Lol Tolhurst also played drums for a time and subsequent keyboardist Perry Bamonte later switched to guitar. OâDonnell rejoined The Cure in late 1994 and appeared on the albums Wild Mood Swings, Bloodflowers, and The Cure. He also appears on the live DVD The Cure: Trilogy. During this period it is notable that OâDonnell introduced the band to digital recording.\n\nRoger O'Donnell Net Worth\n\nRoger is one of the richest Pianist from United Kingdom.
