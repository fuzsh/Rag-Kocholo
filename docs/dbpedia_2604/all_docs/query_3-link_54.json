        "text": "The Cure‘s keyboardist Roger O’Donnell will sit out the band’s upcoming shows in Latin America, it has been announced.\n\nThe Robert Smith-fronted group are due to begin a final run of concerts for 2023 later this week, having wrapped up their North American ‘Shows of A Lost World’ tour back in July.\n\nREAD MORE: Robert Smith on the cover: The past, present and future of The Cure\n\nThey’ll perform in Mexico, Peru, Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Brazil, Paraguay and Colombia, with the latter date set to take place on December 10.\n\nAhead of the tour kicking off, The Cure took to social media to confirm that O’Donnell will be absent from the forthcoming gigs due to unspecified “health reasons”. The message added: “We are sure you will join with us in wishing him the speediest of recoveries.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe band went on to reveal that Mike Lord will be stepping in to play keyboards on the impacted dates. Check out the post below.\n\nO’Donnell joined The Cure in 1987 but has left the group on two occasions previously, in 1990 and 2005. He rejoined the line-up in 2011.\n\nRecommended\n\nThis summer saw The Cure break touring records in the US and Canada, despite frontman Smith’s fight to lower the price of tickets.\n\nMeanwhile, fans continue to await news on the band’s long-awaited 14th album. Speaking to NME in March 2022, Smith exclusively revealed that the follow-up to 2008’s ‘4:13 Dream’ will be called ‘Songs Of A Lost World’.\n\n“It’s got artwork, it’s got a running order, it’s almost done!” he explained at the time.\n\nSmith told NME: “I’ve been working on two Cure albums, and one of them is finished. Unfortunately, it’s the second one that’s finished. [On the other] I’ve got to do four vocals, and there are 10 songs on each album. We’re mixing next month on April 1, so I’ve got three weeks left.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAsked about the sound of the pair of records, Smith said: “Well the first Cure album is relentless doom and gloom. It’s the doomiest thing that we’ve ever done. The second one is upbeat, and my [solo] one won’t be out until next year.”"
