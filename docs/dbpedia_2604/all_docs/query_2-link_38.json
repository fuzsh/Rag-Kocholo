        "text": "Born October 29th, 1955\n\nRoger is the current keyboardist for the group. He re-entered the band to help with the recording of 'Wild Mood Swings' and the following tour. Roger originally enterred the band to fill in the void of Lol Tolhurst's growing gap at keyboards as he participated in the group less and less. Roger toured the Kissing Tour and the Prayer Tour but left shortly after citing musical differences. The prevalent rumor is that Boris Williams and Simon Gallup could not get along with Roger anymore. Since then, Boris has left the band and Roger and Simon have made up."
