        "text": "The Cure’s keyboardist Roger O’Donnell has responded to Paul Weller’s diatribe against his bandmate Robert Smith.\n\nEarlier this week, Paul Weller hit out at The Cure frontman in an interview, calling him a “fat c***” and suggested he would like to “slap him”.\n\nWeller’s comments were made when an interviewer for the cover story ofRecord Collector suggested that a song from Noel Gallagher’s forthcoming album sounds like “A Forest” by The Cure.\n\nWeller didn’t seem to be too happy with this assertion, with the writer describing him as going into a state of “revulsion”.\n\n\"Really??!“ Weller said.\"I can’t f***ing stand them.”\n\n“F***ing fat c***, with his lipstick and all that b*llocks. He is my age as well, isn’t he?\" Weller said.\n\n\"He’s a f***ing kn*b end,\" he continued. \"I don’t like him. There you go."
