        "text": "The City of New York uses the latest climate science to inform resiliency and adaptation decision-making, as well as expand opportunities to work with local communities and institutions to understand needs and priorities.\n\nThe New York City Panel on Climate Change (NPCC):\n\nThe Climate Vulnerability, Impact, and Adaptation Analysis (VIA): Assessing future climate change and its potential impacts to inform the City’s decision-making by bring together scientific and local information on social and economic vulnerability, public health, and climate change to inform policy and action for communities most vulnerable and at-risk.\n\nClimate Change Adaptation Task Force and Inter-Agency Climate Assessment Team: Since 2008, MOCEJ has convened the Climate Change Adaptation Task Force (CCATF) in order to review the climate change projections as recommended by the New York City Panel on Climate Change and evaluate potential impacts. CCATF is comprised of over 60 different organizations including city, state, and federal agencies, private organizations, and entities responsible for managing the City’s public health, natural systems, critical infrastructure, buildings, and economy. Given the broad remit of and large number of organizations that comprise CCATF and other boards, MOCEJ has also established the Inter-agency Climate Assessment Team (ICAT) to strengthen the relevance of NPCC climate assessments to agency policy and decision-making by coordinating and supporting interactions between NPCC Working Groups (WG) and City staff. Together, these entities entrench climate data into the City’s decision-making and that of our critical partners.\n\nThe New York City State of Climate Knowledge: Maintains a public agenda for climate research in NYC. The agenda includes public engagement, united local knowledge, academic climate research, and City agency know-how to co-produce actionable results.\n\nHazard Mitigation Plan: Enables the City to continuously identify, assess and reduce our risk from an array of hazards threatening our city.\n\nClimate Adaptation Plan for Public Housing(NYCHA): Lays out how climate hazards will affect NYCHA in the coming decades; where there are specific vulnerabilities to climate hazards; and an approach to preparing NYCHA for a changing climate.\n\nComprehensive Waterfront Plan: Articulates the City’s vision for a more equitable, more resilient, and healthier waterfront for all New Yorkers.\n\nCool Neighborhoods NYC: To combat extreme heat, the City implemented a $100 million program designed to keep New Yorkers safe and cool by expanding the City’s tree canopy and investing in social resiliency programs.\n\nRainfall Ready NYC: Offers short-term, actionable steps New Yorkers and city government can take to prepare for extreme rain together.\n\nWastewater Resiliency Plan: Identifies and prioritizes infrastructure that is most at risk of flood damage for resiliency upgrades.\n\nSpecial Initiative for Recovery and Resiliency (SIRR): Contains actionable recommendations both for rebuilding the communities impacted by Hurricane Sandy and increasing the resilience of infrastructure and buildings citywide.\n\nProgressive Design Build: The City is actively advocating for the state to pass Progressive Design Build legislation to more efficiently design and build critical resiliency infrastructure.\n\nZoning for Carbon Neutrality: The Department of City Planning is working with MOCEJ on updates to the City’s regulations to Zoning for Zero Carbon that support the City’s ambitious climate goals. These updates will remove regulatory impediments to solar installation, support the growth of EV and micromobility infrastructure, improve energy efficiency and building performance standards for retrofits and new construction, and help advance the city’s stormwater and waste management goals.\n\nNYC Climate Resiliency Design Guidelines: Provides guidance and tools that go beyond current building codes and standards to incorporate forward-looking climate data into design. These step-by-step instructions help engineers, architects, and project managers prepare for future conditions when they design City facilities. These guidelines have been replicated across the nation and most recently were codified into law, following a 5-year pilot via LL41 (2021).\n\nTransportation Resiliency: Track climate risks facing the City’s diverse transportation assets, from streets and sidewalks to bridges and streetlights. Guidelines have been developed to ensure that the projects built today can withstand the climate threats of tomorrow.\n\nDesign and Planning for Flood Resiliency: Provides guidance for developing and renovating coastally resilient waterfront parks. The Guidelines are specifically tailored for NYC Parks with the hope that other planners, designers, consultant firms, agencies, communities, and homeowners can use them as a reference for coastally resilient park planning and design.\n\nNeighborhood Coastal Flood Protection Guidance: Plan and design neighborhood coastal flood protection projects that are equitable, resilient, and well-designed.\n\nCollaboration with State Utility and Authority Partners: NYC actively engages with our utility and state partners including ConEd, National Grid, Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), Port Authority, and others to ensure the critical interdependencies across our region are considering the latest climate projections and prepared for current and future vulnerabilities.\n\nFEMA’s Hazard Mitigation grants: Including Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) and the Flood Mitigation Assistant (FMA) program, they help ensure that the city can continually identify, assess and reduce our risk from an array of hazards. Most recently, NYC won BRIC grants for the Seaport Coastal Resilience Project and the Clinton Houses Cloudburst Project. For FY 2022, New York City agencies submitted subapplications for nearly $200M in funding from the BRIC and FMA programs.\n\nHousing Mobility: The City is actively pursuing federal resources to develop programs and services that support equitable, voluntary housing mobility for New Yorkers who live in areas with high flood risk. The City’s goals are to limit and prevent involuntary long-term displacement caused by flooding and equip homeowners and renters in flood-prone areas with the resources to plan and budget for a future move and transition to equitable and resilient long term land stewardship. Housing mobility services, as described in the NYC Comprehensive Waterfront Plan, will prioritize the needs of low- and moderate-income households. They will also reflect engagement with housing advocates and with populations that disproportionately experience life-safety hazards caused by flooding, displacement risk, and housing discrimination.\n\nPre-Disaster Mitigation Funding: The City is also advocating for the federal government to create a coastal infrastructure formula funding program for pre-disaster mitigation. Without dedicated formula funding it is difficult to be efficient and effective in executing large scale multi-year projects. As a nation, we allocate formula funds for recognized needs such as housing and transportation – resiliency must be added to that list.\n\nResilience Hubs: NYC is developing a plan for a network of resilience hubs in NYCHA developments with a $256,000 grant from FEMA. This funding will help inform future capital investments that can transform community spaces on NYCHA’s campuses into resilience hubs that include features such as backup power, reliable heating and cooling, charging stations, and medical refrigeration.\n\nClimate change is causing more frequent and intense heat waves. Every year on average, more people die from extreme heat than from all other types of extreme weather. But heat deaths are preventable. New York City is adapting the built environment and public realm to keep New Yorkers cooler on hot days.\n\nClimate Science and Data\n\nThe Heat Vulnerability Index (HVI) is a measure of how at risk a neighborhood is during extreme heat compared to other neighborhoods. It summarizes the most important social and environmental factors that contribute to neighborhood heat risk.\n\nTemperature Monitoring: The City monitors indoor and outdoor temperatures to better understand how our natural systems and built infrastructure, such as green space and building conditions, impact temperatures on the hyper-local neighborhood scale.\n\nThe City is producing new, high resolution heat risk projections that will help it prepare and plan for future extreme heat conditions.\n\nExpanding Tree Canopy\n\nParks is celebrating a massive climate milestone reached in tree canopy expansion; more trees have been planted on city streets this past fiscal year than in the past five fiscal years, with over 13,000 planted in FY22. In September 2022, the City committed an additional $112 million for the program to plant an estimated 36,000 additional trees per year in HVI-4 neighborhoods through 2026. Parks has prioritized planting trees in neighborhoods most at risk, including: Williamsbridge, Woodlawn, Eastchester, Edenwald, Soundview, Morris Park in the Bronx; Seagate, Coney Island, East Flatbush, Bushwick, Crown Heights, Flatlands, Sunset Park in Brooklyn, West Harlem, East Harlem, Lower East Side in Manhattan; and Hunters Point, Sunnyside, Long Island City, Elmhurst, and Laurelton in Queens.\n\nSince 2017, 11,634 street and park trees will have been planted in the most heat-vulnerable (HVI-5) neighborhoods, with an estimated 14,530 more to be planted through Spring 2024.\n\nCooling Streets and Roofs\n\nIn 2022, the NYC Department of Transportation was awarded a $320,500 FEMA BRIC grant to develop new heat mitigation strategies for streetscapes. This grant was one of only two heat mitigation FEMA BRIC grants awarded nationwide. The findings from this project will inform future street redesign projects and will help the New York City develop better benefit cost analyses for heat mitigation projects.\n\nNew York City will support legislation that pilots the use of cool pavements, light-colored pavements and coating materials that are designed to reduce temperatures in streets and public spaces.\n\nSince 2009, the city has coated over 11 million square feet of rooftop. Since 2017, 70% of new cool roofs have been installed in high HVI areas. New York City will continue to prioritize outreach and new Cool Roofs in high HVI areas.\n\nCooling Centers\n\nCool It! NYC is an online interactive map that directs New Yorkers to outdoor cooling features such as well-shaded streets, parks with sprinklers and water fountains, and fire hydrants with spray caps. During heat emergencies, New York City operates an extensive network of , offering safe, free access to cooling during heatwave events. CBOs can also sign up to be a cooling center partner.\n\nCooling Homes\n\nThe City has advocated for increased Federal funding of the State-administered Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP); policy changes to help lower physical and utility-cost barriers for in-home cooling; and more efficient cooling technology.\n\nFor more information, see Extreme Heat hazard.\n\nThe increasing threats caused by coastal flooding present complex challenges that require innovative adaptation solutions. No single strategy or project will eliminate all coastal flood risks. Multiple adaptation measures and layers of resiliency are critical components of the city’s coastal flood adaptation planning.\n\nClimate Science and Data\n\nIn partnership with NYU and CUNY, the city launched FloodNet, a cooperative of communities, researchers, and New York City government agencies that work to better understand the frequency, severity, and impacts of flooding in New York City. The data and knowledge gained can be used by residents, researchers, city agencies, and advocates to reduce flood risk. The City will expand FloodNet to 500 sensors over the next 5 years, with locations to be determined by an analysis of stormwater risk, tidal flooding risk, storm damages, environmental justice history, social vulnerability, critical infrastructure, and proximity to wireless network connections.\n\nThe NYC Department of City Planning Flood Hazard Mapper provides a comprehensive overview of the coastal flood hazards that threaten the city today, as well as how these hazards are likely to increase in the future with climate change.\n\nThe Mayor’s Office of Climate & Environmental Justice (MOCEJ) is leading the development of Future Flood Risk Maps that accurately depict current coastal flood risk and future sea level rise. These maps will be used for building and planning purposes.\n\nMOCEJ is developing a Flood Vulnerability Index analysis tool that will enable visualization of coastal and stormwater flood vulnerability.\n\nProtecting and Expanding Natural Coasts\n\nNYC is protecting its coast lines by expanding natural coastal resources and constructing new coastal protection infrastructure. NYC will continue to work with partners and advocate for funding that supports the development and implementation of coastal resiliency programs and projects.\n\nNew York City has partnered with the US National Parks Service and the US Army Corps of Engineers improving out natural systems by managing and preserving 10,000 acres of wetlands at Jamaica Bay, which provides critical resiliency benefits for coastal storm surge.\n\nBuilding Coastal Protection\n\nSince Hurricane Sandy in 2012, NYC has constructed award-winning coastal protection projects, an entirely new class of infrastructure for the city, that protect our waterfront neighborhoods from devastating storm surge and regular tidal flooding. These complex projects are among the first of their kind in a dense urban environment like New York City.\n\nThe US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in partnership with New York DEC, New Jersey DEP, and the City of New York, will study the management of future coastal flood risk through the NY& NJ Harbor & Tributaries Coastal Storm Risk Management Study (HATS) to support the long-term resilience and sustainability of the coastal ecosystem and surrounding communities and reduce the economic costs and risks associated with flood and storm events.\n\nNYCHA Recovery and Resiliency\n\nNew York City Housing Authority (NYCHA)’s Recovery and Resiliency program is building back safer, stronger, and smarter by improving structural resiliency and infrastructure protection. 35 NYCHA developments have received over $3 billion in resiliency funding through FEMA. 20 NYCHA developments are receiving new flood-proofed heating and hot water systems. 210 buildings are now powered by permanent, full-load generators for power outages.\n\nBuild It Back\n\nThrough the Build It Back program, the City helped 12,500 families recover from Hurricane Sandy by providing resources for impacted New Yorkers in all five boroughs to repair, rebuild, and elevate their homes, or relocate.\n\nBuilding Code\n\nThe NYC Department of Buildings has established comprehensive building code regulations in the coastal floodplain to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and minimize damages from coastal flooding.\n\nZoning Regulations\n\nThe NYC Department of City Planning (DCP) has updated zoning regulations—Zoning for Coastal Flood Resiliency (ZCFR)—that allow homeowners, business owners, architects and others to design resilient buildings that are better protected from flood risk, reduce flood insurance costs, and recover quickly from other future disasters.\n\nDCP created Special Coastal Risk Districts in 2017 to address coastal areas that are currently at exceptional risk from flooding.\n\nBuilding on precedents set after Sandy, the City will incorporate future flood risk into building and zoning code requirements based on the development of a groundbreaking Future Flood Risk Map that incorporates climate projections.\n\nFor more information, see Coastal Surge Flooding and Chronic Tidal Flooding hazards.\n\nNYC is using a multi-layered strategy to prepare for extreme rainfall and manage stormwater, . Flooding from extreme rain can happen in coastal and inland areas, with low-lying and highly impervious areas at greater risk. Over the last three decades, NYC has transformed its approach to stormwater management and resilience to extreme rainfall.\n\nClimate Science and Data\n\nIn partnership with NYU and CUNY, the city launched FloodNet, a cooperative of communities, researchers, and New York City government agencies that work to better understand the frequency, severity, and impacts of flooding in New York City. The data and knowledge gained can be used by residents, researchers, city agencies, and advocates to reduce flood risk. The City will expand FloodNet to 500 sensors over the next 5 years, with locations to be determined by an analysis of stormwater risk, tidal flooding risk, storm damages, environmental justice history, social vulnerability, critical infrastructure, and proximity to wireless network connections.\n\nTo help New Yorkers understand and prepare for this risk, the City has created Stormwater Maps that show moderate stormwater flooding scenarios under current and future sea level rise conditions, as well as an extreme stormwater flooding scenario under future conditions.\n\nMOCEJ is developing a Flood Vulnerability Index analysis tool that will enable visualization of coastal and stormwater flood vulnerability.\n\nThe City is conducting new climate analyses that characterize current and future extreme heavy rainfall in NYC. These include studying the strategic deployment of backwater valves and the potential to install these devices in the most at-risk residential buildings, through a FEMA Flood Mitigation Assistance grant, to protect homes, businesses, and public health from wastewater backing up from the sewer during extreme storms.\n\nCloudburst Management\n\nNew York City is incorporating cloudburst design principles into city construction, starting with the most vulnerable areas. Cloudburst management implements a combination of methods that absorb, store, and transfer stormwater to minimize flooding from cloudburst events using grey and green infrastructure. Four new locations for Cloudburst projects have been announced for Corona and Kissena Park, Queens, Parkchester, Bronx, and East New York, Brooklyn. They join the city’s ongoing work in South Jamaica and St. Albans, Queens and East Harlem, Manhattan. In 2023, NYCHA announced progress on cloudburst management at 8 NYCHA developments.\n\nNYC will utilize the $188 million in CDBG-DR funding awarded following Tropical Cyclone Ida, including projects such as expanding green infrastructure ($30 million), public housing restoration and resiliency ($88 million), and developing resilient community spaces in two affordable senior housing developments ($9 million).\n\nSewer Upgrades\n\nIn Southeast Queens alone, DEP has completed 18 of 44 projects with another 17 in various stages of design, procurement, and construction. It has built out sewers with 125 miles of new/updated sewer infrastructure in the last 5 years.\n\nOptimizing sewer performance through new and upgraded infrastructure, enhanced maintenance, and employing new technologies to identify emerging issues and target solutions for this critical infrastructure.\n\nStormwater Capture\n\nMaximizing stormwater capture on public and private buildings and infrastructure through the 2022 Unified Stormwater Rule will require developers of large parcels to retain as much stormwater on site as possible and detain the rest onsite.\n\nGreen Infrastructure Stormwater Management\n\nGreen infrastructure collects stormwater from streets, sidewalks, and other hard surfaces before it can enter the sewer system or cause local flooding. By reducing the amount of stormwater that flows into the Sewer System, green infrastructure helps prevent Sewer Overflows and improves the health of local waterways. DEP has constructed over 11,000 green infrastructure assets and 17,000 linear feet of porous pavement to capture heavy rainfall, improve water quality, and prevent flooding, using nature-based measures. DEP’s Green Infrastructure Grant Program funds such initiatives as a rooftop farm on Staten Island that grows healthy organic food and absorbs stormwater, in an effort to help reduce neighborhood flooding and protect the health of New York Harbor. By keeping rainfall out of the local drainage system, this rooftop farm — situated on top of the Nicotra Group’s Corporate Commons Three building — helps manage stormwater and decrease neighborhood flooding.\n\nThe Bluebelt Program\n\nBluebelts are ecologically rich and cost-effective drainage systems that naturally handle the runoff precipitation that falls on our streets and sidewalks. NYC has completed 84 Bluebelt projects across 3 boroughs and piloted stream daylighting to capture and manage stormwater using large-scale nature-based measures.\n\nSoutheast Queens Project\n\nThe Interactive Southeast Queens Project Map highlights projects that are in construction or have been completed as part of the City’s $1.9 billion effort to reduce flooding and upgrade infrastructure throughout Southeast Queens.\n\nResilient NYC Partners\n\nThis City-funded program supports private property owners to build rain gardens, fix drainage issues, replace paved areas, and other stormwater resiliency efforts.\n\nBuilding-Level Stormwater Management\n\nNYC is studying the strategic deployment of backwater valves and the potential to install these devices in the most at-risk residential buildings, through a FEMA Flood Mitigation Assistance grant, to protect homes, businesses, and public health from wastewater backing up from the sewer during extreme storms.\n\nStormwater Playgrounds\n\nThe Trust for Public Land, in partnership with the DEP, the Department of Education (DOE), the School Construction Authority (SCA), and funders, are transforming schoolyards in vulnerable areas into community playgrounds, featuring green infrastructure to manage stormwater and give quality park access to residents within a 10-minute walk of the school.\n\nFor more information, see Extreme Rainfall hazard.\n\nReady New York: An emergency public education campaign that prepares communities for all types of emergencies and hazards with such measures as writing an emergency plan, choosing a meeting place, gathering supplies, and preparing a Go Bag.\n\nFlood Insurance: The City has undertaken extensive outreach and education through FloodHelpNY.org to increase NFIP enrollment by about 50% since Hurricane Sandy. The City is committed to expanding outreach and education efforts about flood risk and flood insurance to increase awareness and drive flood insurance uptake among homeowners, renters, and business owners to support New Yorkers physical and financial resiliency. In 2023, FloodHelpNY released Community Flood Action Toolkits.\n\nNYC will continue to advocate for federal legislative reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), which provides federally-backed flood insurance for NYC property owners, renters, and businesses to help them repair and rebuild faster after a flood. Suggested reforms include an affordability program, to ensure flood insurance remains accessible for the households that need it the most.\n\nThe City will support State and Federal legislation that promotes flood risk disclosures and work with partners to ensure residents have access to transparent information about a property’s flood history and flood insurance pricing before a property is bought or rented.\n\nRetro-Fit Funding Assistance: NYC will continue to identify ways to support resilience retrofits for 1-to-4 family homeowners. The City will do this through financial and technical assistance in partnership with state, federal, and non-profit partners that considers how retrofits may impact renters and influence displacement. It will also work to reduce regulatory barriers in the design & construction process that prevent or discourage resiliency retrofits.\n\nNYC is actively advocating for additional federal funding and flexibility for more equitable investments and continues to explore ways to expand the pool of resources available for building owners to undertake resiliency retrofits. This includes working with private and non-profit resources; and with FEMA to align grant eligibility with federal goals to increase resiliency and sustainability in dense urban areas, fund project planning and scoping, support heat mitigation projects, incentivize nature-based solutions and wetlands projects, and improve benefit-cost analyses to better account for risk in urban areas and capture more project benefits in low-resourced neighborhoods.\n\nResilient NYC: Works with city agency, non-profit, and private partners to develop programs, resources, and financing to support critical infrastructure protections and deploy building-level retrofits that are resilient and sustainable in single and multi-family buildings, such as backwater valves, installation of flood-resistant materials, and the elevation of mechanical systems in at-risk communities.\n\nSBS Business PREP (BPREP): Supports small businesses, the backbone of the City’s economy, through expanding citywide to help small businesses better prepare for emergencies like those caused by flooding and power outages. The City is expanding BPREP through a $6M commitment to reach an additional 1,040 businesses citywide, on top of the $7.1 million already invested."
