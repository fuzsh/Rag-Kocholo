        "text": "District Information\n\nDistrict Map (PDF) | Find District Services (SF Find) | Am I In District 3?\n\nDistrict 3 is situated at the northeastern corner of the City, surrounded on two sides by the San Francisco Bay. The district encompasses the Barbary Coast, Chinatown, Embarcadero, Financial District, Fisherman's Wharf, Nob Hill, North Beach, Russian Hill, Telegraph Hill, and part of Union Square.\n\nThe Barbary Coast is an area roughly centered on Broadway Street between Columbus Avenue and Montgomery Street. An established neighborhood since the years of the Gold Rush and recently revived, it is a center of San Francisco's nightlife.\n\nChinatown is a neighborhood located near the center of District 3 centered on Stockton Street between Sacramento Street and Columbus Avenue, and Grant Avenue between Columbus Avenue and Bush Street. An ethnic Chinese enclave since the 1850s, it is the oldest Chinatown in North America and one of the largest in the world, and serves as both a major tourist attraction and a center for the wider Chinese American community.\n\nThe Embarcadero is located along the City's eastern waterfront, centered on its namesake thoroughfare. It is a blend of warehouses from the times of the Gold Rush and new, modern office and high-tech buildings, along with newer housing.\n\nThe Financial District is located in the southeastern part of the district, centered along Montgomery and Market Streets. It serves as the financial and economic hub of San Francisco, including the headquarters of numerous companies, investment firms, and financial institutions.\n\nFisherman's Wharf , situated on the top part of the district, is a top tourist attraction and a vibrant local hub. It is an eclectic blend of old and new architecture, old and new tourist hotspots, and, of course, the crab.\n\nNob Hill, centered on Jones and Sacramento Streets, is bounded by Chinatown, Union Square, the Tenderloin, and North Beach. It serves as the home of both families and working professionals, not to mention religious institutions and upscale hotels.\n\nNorth Beach is centered along Columbus Avenue, bordering the Financial District, Barbary Coast, Chinatown, Telegraph Hill, and Fisherman's Wharf. It has been, and still is, San Francisco's Little Italy, but it was also the home of the Beat Generation in the 1950s and 1960s and is now a melting pot of numerous ethnic groups and cultures.\n\nRussian Hill is directly to the north (and slightly downhill) from Nob Hill, and (uphill) to the south of Fisherman’s Wharf, and to the west of the North Beach neighborhood, deriving its name from the Gold Rush-era discovery of a Russian cemetery at the top of the hill. Today it is home to some of San Francisco’s most iconic landmarks, including the Lombard’s “Crooked Street” , the historic Vallejo Street Crest homes, and the former San Francisco Art Institute with its Diego Rivera mural.\n\nTelegraph Hill is located between Fisherman's Wharf and North Beach. Topped by Coit Tower, it is famous for the feral parakeets that live and nest among the surrounding trees and Filbert Street, one of the steepest streets in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nUnion Square is sandwiched between the Tenderloin on the west, Chinatown to the north, the Financial District on the east, and Market Street to the south. It is the City's premier shopping place and a gathering place for families and friends, and serves as the economic and cultural heart of San Francisco."
