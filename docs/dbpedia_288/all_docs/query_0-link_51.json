        "text": "The project involved tunneling through timber foundation piles using the New Austrian Tunneling Method (NATM) with ground freezing for temporary building and tunnel support. The binocular tunnel was waterproofed using a full round PVC membrane and has a shotcrete final lining for permanent tunnel support. Timber piles of the buildings are socketed in the tunnel’s shotcrete initial lining and resting on the binocular tunnel which serves as a building foundation long-term.\n\nTunnel Construction Support Services and Consulting:\n\nGall Zeidler Consultants (GZ) advised on the construction of this binocular bus and light rail tunnel beneath the historic Russia Wharf and Graphic Arts buildings in Boston, Massachusetts. GZ’s services included consulting on the contractor’s ground freezing program, proposal of a fast ring closure method, shotcrete final lining alternative, and instrumentation and monitoring."
