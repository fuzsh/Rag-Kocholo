        "text": "Life Served Fresh Daily\n\nWaterfront Place Central\n\nThe Port of Everett’s Waterfront Place is a new 1.5 million square foot mixed-use development located on 65 acres at the waterfront in Everett, Washington. With spectacular views, waterfront access, recreational amenities and a world-class marina with over 2,300 slips and more than 5,000 linear feet of guest dock space. The development plans include 63,000 SF of retail and restaurant space, 447,500 SF of office, two hotels, 20,000 SF of marine retail and up to 660 waterfront homes including apartments, condominiums and/or town homes/lofts.\n\nIn the Puget Sound, there are five things you can do year-round – sleep, eat, drink, work and recreate. The Port, in partnership with private developers, is building a project around these objectives and creating a waterfront neighborhood that feels authentically Everett, embracing the city’s rich history and industry with fascinating personality.\n\nWhen fully realized, Waterfront Place is expected to support 2,075 family-wage jobs. The project’s expected $550 million in public/private development investment will generate $8.6 million annually in state and local sales taxes; in addition to the temporary construction jobs, sales tax and building permit revenues. Port activities support more than 40,000 jobs for the surrounding community.\n\nTo date, the project has facilitated more than $1 billion in public/private investment, with even more investment and amenities on the horizon. Recent Port investments include more than $50 million in completed projects at the development’s Fisherman’s Harbor district."
