As Long Wharf's oldest surviving structure, formerly the John Hancock Counting House, the seafood restaurant is a fusion of history and modern style. The newly renovated interior is full of bold colors, a hopping happy hour and the kind of creative seafood dishes that draw a crowd.\n\nWith an area so full of legendary locales, there's plenty to see and do just a short distance away. Stop by Chart House Boston after a day of boating and shopping around Long Wharf, or enjoy a delicious lunch before an outing to Downtown Boston, Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park and more. See the tall ships that visit our waters or watch the enormous 4th of July celebration on the harbor each year.\n\nTo get a taste of a true seafood legend and the best Prime Rib Boston has to offer, visit Chart House on Long Wharf!"
