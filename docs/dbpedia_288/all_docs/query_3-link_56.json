        "text": "Pemberton Historical Park is a gorgeous 262 acre expanse of nature and wildlife, located just minutes from Route 50 along Pemberton Drive. Created in the 1980s, the park surrounds Pemberton Hall, a plantation home built in 1741, which is rich in Eastern Shore history.\n\nThe park's mission is to provide a setting that blends together history and nature. Amenities include a trail system, outdoor amphitheater, fresh water ponds with catch-and-release fishing, public restrooms and several picnic areas.\n\nPemberton Park hosts several environmental education programs and special events throughout the year.\n\nTrail System\n\nPemberton Historical Park is home to 4.5 miles of nature trails, offering visitors the opportunity to explore unique ecosystems that bring together tidal and fresh water wetlands, fresh water ponds, upland pines, hardwood forests and meadows. There are seven different trails, ranging from 0.3 miles to 1.2 miles in length. The trails are for walking and hiking only. Biking is not permitted.\n\nTrail Guide\n\nNature Center\n\nThe Nature Center's summer hours are Saturdays & Sundays from 11 a.m.-3 p.m. Off-season hours are Saturdays or Sundays from 11 a.m.-3 p.m.\n\nThe Nature Center's animal ambassadors include corn snakes Skittles and Noodle; Jack the milk snake; green anoles Hidey and Monkey; and Mater the Russian tortoise.\n\nPemberton Park merchandise is available for purchase (cards only, no cash), with proceeds going towards the care of our animal ambassadors. Looking for another way to contribute? Shop our Amazon wish list.\n\nHistory\n\nPemberton Hall\n\nPemberton Hall is the only original 18th century house open to the public on the lower Eastern Shore. In 1726, Isaac Handy purchased 960 acres of undeveloped land from Joseph Pemberton. The property sat opposite of the Wicomico River. Handy completed construction of Pemberton Hall in 1741. With the exception of the window glass and iron hardware, all materials for the home were made on site. The Great Room stood two times larger than the average home in the Chesapeake Bay region.\n\nRestoration\n\nOver 200 years after Handy's death, Pemberton Hall had become a derelict property on the verge of destruction. The Pemberton Hall Foundation was formed in the mid-1960s to save the home and restore it to its former glory. The Foundation continues to maintain the Hall and two acres upon which it sits. Foundation volunteers offer tours during the summer season and by appointment. Visit the Pemberton Hall Foundation website to learn more.\n\nRentals\n\nPemberton Park is equipped to host picnics, retreats and wedding receptions and/or ceremonies for up to 100 guests.\n\nClassroom Rental Application - Coming soon.\n\nSpecial Event Rental Application - Coming soon.\n\nWedding Application - Coming soon.\n\nField Trips & School Groups\n\nGroups of 10 or more should receive written permission prior to visiting the park.
