Currently, this is a large semi abandoned area located of a particular geography: steepy cliffs in contact with the sea become an interruption to the continuity of the beach, then a large plateau that offers outstanding vistas overlooking the Amur Bay and subsequently a depression that enjoys a warmer microclimate and a natural ...\n\nContext 3\n\n... In this polluted area, where parking lots, industrial dumps, deposits, debris and garbage coexist, a new 20 hec- tares metropolitan park is proposed. It would house both recreational as well as cultural activities. Landscaping of the park would favour local flora. Spatially, this park will be have a connection with the historical Pokrovskiy Park (Fig. 12 d), located 400 meters west of the proposed park, by means of the extension of the Krasnogo Znameni Prospect and a succession of plazas and boulevards that would promote spatial fluidity between these two met- ropolitan green areas. • Pedestrian pathways: (Fig. 12 c). One of the main principles for the urban design of resilient cities is ...\n\nContext 4\n\n... Spatially, this park will be have a connection with the historical Pokrovskiy Park (Fig. 12 d), located 400 meters west of the proposed park, by means of the extension of the Krasnogo Znameni Prospect and a succession of plazas and boulevards that would promote spatial fluidity between these two met- ropolitan green areas. • Pedestrian pathways: (Fig. 12 c). One of the main principles for the urban design of resilient cities is to prioritize walking as the preferred mode of travel, and as a defining component of a healthy quality of life. For that purpose, a 10 km network of paths injects the flow of pedestrian traffic from the city and along the coastline, complemented by stairs that ...\n\nContext 5\n\n... Integration of industry (Fig. 12 b). While in a short term it will not be pos- sible to eradicate the energy plant located in the waterfront, it is possible to carry out a program in order to gradually reduce its emissions and pollution. Its façade as well as its open areas can be beautified to become an attrac- tive landmark in the urban landscape. Additionally, by ...\n\nContext 6\n\n... Habilitation of new public beaches. (Fig. 12 e). After cleaning up and de- contamination, new beach areas can be available for public use, provid- ing amenities and facilities. These beaches can be also reached from the pedestrian and bikeway network, as well as from the vertical accessibility mentioned ...\n\nContext 7\n\n... Renovation of housing, proposed in the extension of Avenue Krasnogo Znameni: (Fig. 12 f). An area, strategically located between the Pokrovskiy Park and the new Metropolitan Park, contains a group of old wooden hous- es forming a sort of small village. This renovation would stress the social character of the project by improving significantly the living condition of this neighborhood in terms of the preservation of the ...\n\nContext 8\n\n... Landscape Viewpoints (Fig. 13 a). According to visibility analysis, scenic points are strategically located where the topography allows a pan- oramic view of the ...\n\nContext 9\n\n... Renewal of urban-architectural environments of monumental and historical value (Fig. 13 b, fig. 14). The semi pedestrianization of Svetslanskaya street is proposed, in order to improve the visual connection between the Main Square and the Sports Quay, and at the same time promote a better visuali- zation of the historic buildings in this street. The current traffic would not be affected, since 70% of the area is currently occupied by ...\n\nContext 10\n\n... Expansion of a new plaza over the railroad (Fig. 13 c, fig. 15): Covering a portion of the railroad and a vehicular road will allow to create a new pub- lic space in downtown, and at the same time promote a more fluid access between the city and the waterfront Main ..."
