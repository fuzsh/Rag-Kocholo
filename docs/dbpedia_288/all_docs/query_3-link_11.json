        "text": "Khabarovsk\n\nRussia\n\nKhabarovsk, city and administrative centre of Khabarovsk kray (territory), far eastern Russia. Khabarovsk lies along the Amur River just below its confluence with the Ussuri. The town was named after the Russian explorer E.P. Khabarov, who made several expeditions to the Amur River basin in the mid-17th century. The modern city was founded in 1858 as a military outpost. Its nodal position at the point at which the Trans-Siberian Railroad crosses the Amur made it an important focus of the Russian Far East, and at one time it administered the entire area to the Bering Strait. Modern Khabarovsk spreads across a series of small valleys and ridges perpendicular to the Amur. The city has an attractive waterfront park and esplanade and a mixture of modern apartment blocks, factories, and old, one-story wooden houses. It is a major industrial centre, with most enterprises located in the upstream district; they include a wide range of engineering and machine-building industries, oil refining, timber working, furniture making, and many light industries. There are polytechnic, agricultural, medical, teacher-training, and railway-engineering institutes and several scientific-research establishments. Pop. (2006 est.) 578,060.\n\nThis article was most recently revised and updated by Heather Campbell."
