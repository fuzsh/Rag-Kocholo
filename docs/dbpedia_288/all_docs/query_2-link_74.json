        "text": "The definition of the largest building in the world is dependent on how size is measured. For example, the Aerium, located in Krausnick, Germany, is widely considered to be the largest building in the world in terms of its total volume. This is a tropical water park that is located in Brandenburg, and that used to be an airship hangar. That is why it is called the Aerium. It is the biggest free-standing building in the world in terms of cubic meters, and it welcomes approximately 8,000 people every day. During its first year of operation, it welcomed close to one million people. This is an international attraction, frequently seeing visitors from outside of Europe.\n\nWhat Is the Largest Building in the United States?\n\nThe largest building in the United States, in terms of its total volume, is the Boeing Everett Factory. It was built in 1967, and it is more than 13 million cubic meters. This means that the factory itself is actually larger than the Aerium; however, the Boeing Everett Factory is interrupted by walls and doors. Therefore, it is generally not considered to be larger than the Aerium because the total volume is interrupted. Regardless, this is one of the largest buildings in the world, and it is responsible for the production of countless planes that fly all over the world.\n\nWhat Is the Largest Floor Area Building in the United States?\n\nThe building with the largest floor area in the United States is called the Gigafactory Texas. This is also called the Tesla Gigafactory. This is a facility that is responsible for manufacturing Tesla vehicles in Austin, Texas. This is a building that is owned by Tesla and is responsible for producing a wide variety of vehicles, including Tesla Model Y cars. Construction on the building began in July 2020, and it started to roll cars off the line in 2021. Construction on the building was not finished until 2022. In the future, the building is going to be the main production center of the Tesla Semi and the Tesla Cybertruck. In addition, the factory will also continue to produce Tesla Model Y and Tesla Model 3 cars for customers located in the Eastern regions of the United States.\n\nWhat Is the Tallest Building in the World?"
