        "text": "This project is part of the thriving Moscow City, a mixed-use district centrally located within the sprawling Russian metropolis and loosely based on London’s Canary Wharf and Paris’s La Défense. The complex will consist of an 85-story skyscraper and a 49-story office tower connected at the base by a transparent crystalline structure. The massive development includes luxury residences, premium office space, a four-star hotel, parking, and extensive green space.\n\nThe elegant towers gradually taper away from each other as they stretch upward, with glass curtain walls that possess varying degrees of translucency, clarity, and reflectivity. A new private road bisects the site, creating a pedestrian promenade with access to both towers. Landscaped paths and plazas knit together the buildings, shops, and restaurants.\n\nA continuous strip of parkland and plazas along the project’s southern edge provides a much-needed amenity for the increasingly high-density zone. The greenway — the only one in Moscow City — offers generous drop-off areas for the residential tower and hotel, as well as pocket groves of indigenous trees and open lawns for public use."
