If Tenant shall fail to execute such Agreement, the Commencement Date and Lease Term shall be as reasonably determined by Landlord in accordance with the terms of this Lease.\n\n3.2 Extension Option\n\n(A) On the conditions (which conditions Landlord may waive by written notice to Tenant) that both at the time of exercise of the applicable herein described option to extend and as of the commencement of the applicable Extended Term in question (i) there exists no \"Event of Default\" (defined in Section 15.1) and (ii) this Lease is still in full force and effect, and (iii) Tenant has neither assigned this Lease nor sublet more than fifty percent (50%) of the Rentable Floor Area of the Premises (except for an assignment or subletting permitted without Landlord's consent under Section 12.5 hereof), Tenant shall have the right to extend the Term hereof upon all the same terms, conditions, covenants and agreements herein contained (except that the Annual Fixed Rent which shall be adjusted during the option period as hereinbelow set forth and except that there shall be no further option to extend except as set forth herein) for two (2) periods of five (5) years each, as hereinafter set forth. Each option period is sometimes herein referred to as an \"Extended Term.\" Notwithstanding any implication to the contrary Landlord has no obligation to make any additional payment to Tenant in respect of any construction allowance or the like or to perform any work to the Premises as a result of the exercise by Tenant of any such option, the parties hereby agreeing, however, that the amount (if any) of any construction allowance and/or work performed to the Premises by Landlord in connection with an Extended Term shall be a factor in determining the Prevailing Market Rent Term.\n\nPage 11\n\nunder Section 3.3 of this Lease, or (iii) any expansion space leased in connection with Tenant's rights under Section 3.5 of this Lease, as applicable under leases and amendments then being entered into with private sector tenants in Class A office buildings in the Central Business District of Boston, taking into account all then relevant factors (including, without limitation, those set forth in Exhibit H). If at the expiration of thirty (30) days after the date when Landlord provides such quotation to Tenant (the \"Negotiation Period\"), during which period Landlord and Tenant agree to negotiate in good faith with respect to the Prevailing Market Rent applicable to the Premises, Landlord and Tenant have not reached agreement on a determination of the Prevailing Market Rent for such Extended Term and executed a written instrument extending the Term of this Lease pursuant to such agreement, then Tenant shall have the right, for thirty (30) days following the expiration of the Negotiation Period, to make a request to Landlord for a broker determination (the \"Broker Determination\") of the Prevailing Market Rent for such Extended Term, which Broker Determination shall be made in the manner set forth in Exhibit H. If Tenant timely shall have requested the Broker Determination, then the Annual Fixed Rent for the applicable Extended Term shall be the greater of (a) the Prevailing Market Rent as determined by the Broker Determination, with a Base Year for Operating Expenses for such Extended Term which is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which such Extended Term commences and a Base Year for Taxes for such Extended Term which is the fiscal tax year immediately preceding the fiscal tax year immediately preceding fiscal tax year in which such Extended Term commences (\"Prevailing Market Terms\"), or (b) the product of $41.00 and the Rentable Floor Area of the Premises, with a Base Year for Operating Expenses for such Extended Term which is same calendar year as the Base Year in effect immediately preceding the commencement of such Extended Term and a Base Year for Taxes which is which is same fiscal tax year as the Base Year in effect immediately preceding the commencement of such Extended Term (\"Floor Terms\"). If Tenant does not timely request the Broker Determination, then the Annual Fixed Rent during the applicable Extended Term shall be equal to the greater of (a) Landlord's Rent Quotation or (b) the product of $41.00 and the Rentable Floor Area of the Premises.\n\nPage 12\n\nby Tenant in respect of such Extended Term is based upon Prevailing Market Rate, then the Base Year for Operating Expenses for such Extended Term shall be the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year in which such Extended Term commences and the Base Year for Taxes for such Extended Term shall be the fiscal tax year immediately preceding the fiscal tax year immediately preceding fiscal tax year in which such Extended Term commences. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in no event shall Tenant have the right to exercise more than one extension option at a time and, further, Tenant shall not have the right to exercise its second extension option unless it has duly exercised its first extension option and in no event shall the Lease Term hereof be extended for more than ten (10) years after the expiration of the Original Lease Term hereof.\n\nPage 13\n\nRent therefore to be the proposed Annual Fixed Rent for the Available 5th Floor ROFO Space, and (ii) all other material terms and conditions (which need not include a tenant improvement allowance, the parties hereby agreeing that the amount of tenant improvement allowance, if any, provided by Landlord in connection with Tenant's demise of an Available 5th Floor ROFO Space shall be a factor in determining the Prevailing Market Rate for such Available 5th Floor ROFO Space) that will apply to the Available 5th Floor ROFO Space, all of which shall be the terms and conditions of this Lease (i) except for any conditions unique to such Available 5th Floor ROFO Space and set forth in Landlord's 5th Floor ROFO Notice, and (ii) except as set forth in or subject to the provisions of Section 3.3(D) below. Tenant shall have the right, exercisable upon written notice (\"Tenant's 5th Floor ROFO Exercise Notice\") given to Landlord within twenty (20) days after the receipt of Landlord's 5th Floor ROFO Notice, (i) to lease all of the Available 5th Floor ROFO Space, on the terms set forth in Landlord's 5th Floor ROFO Notice, (ii) to lease all of the Available 5th Floor ROFO Space, but reject the quotation of annual fixed rent set forth in Landlord's 5th Floor ROFO Notice and instead elect to submit the same to a Broker Determination in accordance with the provisions of Exhibit H attached hereto to determine the Prevailing Market Rent for the Available 5th Floor ROFO Space, or (iii) reject Landlord's 5th Floor ROFO Notice. If Tenant fails timely to give Tenant's 5th Floor ROFO Exercise Notice, Landlord shall be free to lease the Available 5th Floor ROFO Space (or any portion thereof) to a third party and Tenant shall have no further right to lease such Available 5th Floor ROFO Space (or such portion thereof) pursuant to this Section 3.3, unless:\n\n(x) no such third party lease is executed for the entirety of the Available 5th Floor ROFO Space that was previously offered to Tenant during the 5th Floor ROFO Space Leasing Period, as hereinafter defined, (in which event Tenant shall again have a right of first offer to lease the entirety, or the portion of the Available 5th Floor ROFO Space which has not been leased to a third party, as the case may be, of the Available 5th Floor Space in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.3); or\n\n(y) the term of any such third party lease, as from time to time extended or renewed, has expired or sooner ended, in which event the portion of the 5th floor leased to such third party shall again become Available 5th ROFO Space and Tenant shall again have a right of first offer to lease such Available 5th Floor ROFO Space in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3.3.\n\nThe \"5th Floor ROFO Space Leasing Period\" with respect to any Landlord's 5th Floor ROFO Notice shall be the period ending as of the date (\"5th Floor ROFO Space Leasing Period Expiration Date\") twelve (12) months after the date that Tenant fails timely to accept the terms of such Landlord's 5th Floor ROFO Notice, as aforesaid, except that if, as of the date twelve (12) months after the date that Tenant fails timely to accept the terms of such Landlord's 5th Floor ROFO\n\nPage 14\n\nNotice, Landlord is engaged in good faith negotiations with a third party to enter into an agreement to lease the Available 5th Floor ROFO Space in question, then such 5th Floor ROFO Space Lease Expiration Date shall be the date fifteen (15) months after the date that Tenant fails timely to accept the terms of such Landlord's 5th Floor ROFO Notice. Upon the timely giving of such Tenant's 5th Floor ROFO Exercise Notice, Landlord shall lease and demise to Tenant and Tenant shall hire and take from Landlord, the entirety of such Available 5th Floor ROFO Space commencing upon the Term Commencement Date for such Available 5th Floor ROFO Space (as determined pursuant to Section 3.3(D)(1) below), upon all of the same terms and conditions of the Lease, except as hereinafter set forth. In any case in which Tenant shall have waived said right of first offer or said right shall have expired, Tenant shall, upon request of Landlord, execute and deliver in recordable form an instrument indicating such waiver or expiration, subject to Tenant's continuing rights under this Section 3.3, which instrument shall be conclusive in favor of all persons relying thereon in good faith.\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary provided in this Section 3.3 (including, but not limited to, Section 3.3(C)), if the Available 5th Floor ROFO Space shall be available for delivery to Tenant at any time during the last thirty six (36) months of the Original Lease Term or the first Extended Term, as the case may be, then: (a) if Tenant has no further right to extend the term of the Lease (i.e. because Tenant's right to extend the term of the Lease pursuant to Section 3.2 has been irrevocably waived by Tenant or has lapsed unexercised), then Tenant shall not be entitled to lease the Available 5th Floor ROFO Space under this Section 3.3, (b) if Tenant then has a right to extend the term of the Lease pursuant to Section 3.2 which has not either lapsed unexercised or been irrevocably waived), then Tenant shall have no right to lease such Available 5th Floor ROFO Space unless, prior to, or simultaneously with, the giving of Tenant's 5th Floor ROFO Exercise Notice, Tenant timely and properly exercises such extension option.\n\nPage 15\n\nTenant's 5th Floor ROFO Rescission Right. If the Commencement Date in respect of an Available 5th Floor ROFO Space does not occur on or before the date one hundred fifty (150) days after the Estimated 5th Floor ROFO Commencement Date for such Available 5th Floor ROFO Space, Tenant shall have the right (\"Tenant's 5th Floor ROFO Rescission Right\") to cancel Tenant's demise of such Available 5th Floor ROFO Space. Tenant may exercise Tenant's 5th Floor ROFO Rescission Right by giving Landlord thirty (30) days written rescission notice (\"Tenant's 5th Floor ROFO Rescission Notice\"). If the Commencement Date with respect to such Available 5th Floor ROFO Space occurs on or before the date thirty (30) days after Landlord receives such Tenant's 5th Floor ROFO Rescission Notice, then Tenant's 5th Floor ROFO Rescission Notice shall be void and without force or effect, and Tenant shall have no right to cancel its demise of such Available 5th Floor ROFO Space pursuant to this Section 3.3(D)(1). If the Commencement Date with respect to such Available 5th Floor ROFO Space does not occur on or before the date thirty (30) days after Landlord receives such Tenant's 5th Floor ROFO Rescission Notice, then the Tenant's demise of such Available 5th Floor ROFO Space shall be cancelled as of the date (\"5th Floor ROFO Effective Cancellation Date\") which is thirty (30) days following such notice, and neither party shall have any further liability or obligation to the other party with respect to such Available 5th Floor ROFO Space. The effect of Tenant's exercise of Tenant's 5th Floor ROFO Rescission Right shall be the same as if Tenant had failed timely to accept Landlord's offer to lease such Available 5th Floor ROFO Space, except that, as provided in Section 3.5(C), Tenant's Termination Right may be revived.\n\nPage 16\n\n3.4 Intentionally Omitted.\n\n3.5 Tenant's Contingent Termination Right\n\n(A) Subject to the provisions of this Section 3.5, Tenant shall have the following right (\"Tenant's Termination Right\") to terminate the term of the Lease as of the last day of the seventh Lease Year, or later pursuant Section 3.5(C) (\"Effective Termination Date\") by: (i) giving written notice (\"Tenant's Termination Notice\") to Landlord on or before the date that is fifteen (15) months prior to the Effective Termination Date, (ii) paying fifty (50%) of the Termination Payment, as hereinafter defined, to Landlord at the time that Tenant gives the Tenant's Termination Notice to Landlord, and (iii) paying the balance of the Termination Payment (\"Balance of Termination Payment\") to Landlord on or before the Effective Termination Date.\n\n(B) Termination Option Conditions. It shall be a condition (\"Termination Option Conditions\") to Tenant's right to exercise Tenant's Termination Right under this Section 3.5 that the following conditions are all satisfied:\n\nPage 17\n\n(i) there is, as of the time that Tenant gives Tenant's Termination Notice, as hereinafter defined, no uncured monetary or material non-monetary Event of Default in existence and continuing;\n\n(ii) there is, as of the Effective Termination Date, no uncured monetary or material non-monetary default by Tenant in its obligations under the Lease in existence and continuing of which Landlord has given Tenant written notice prior to the Effective Termination Date (\"Noticed Tenant Default\"), provided however, that if Tenant has not cured a Noticed Tenant Default on or before the Effective Termination Date, Tenant shall nevertheless be deemed to have satisfied the Termination Option Condition set forth in this clause (ii) if Tenant cures such Noticed Tenant Default on or before the last day of the grace period for curing such Noticed Tenant Default (i.e. as set forth in Section 15.1) even if such cure occurs after the Effective Termination Date; and\n\n(iii) Landlord has been unable to satisfy the Tenant's Expansion Needs Condition, as hereinafter defined.\n\nThe Termination Option Conditions under clauses (i) and (ii) above are for the sole benefit of Landlord; therefore, Landlord may, at its election, waive either of such Termination Option Conditions.\n\nPage 18\n\nDate. Landlord shall have no obligation to offer Acceptable Expansion Space to Tenant in response to the Expansion Request. Landlord's Expansion Offer shall set forth: (x) the estimated Commencement Date with respect to the Acceptable Expansion Space, (y) the rent which would be payable by Tenant with respect to such Acceptable Expansion Space, which rent shall be based upon Landlord's designation of the Prevailing Market Rent for such Acceptable Expansion Space, and (z) the terms and conditions as set forth in Section 3.3(D) shall, except to the extent inconsistent with this Section 3.5, be applicable to the Acceptable Expansion Space as if the Acceptable Expansion Space were the Available 5th Floor ROFO Space. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, if, subject to the next following paragraph either:\n\n(ii) Tenant, at any time after the Date of this Lease, enters into an agreement with Landlord leasing any additional space in the Building containing, in the aggregate, not less than 15,000 rentable square feet in the aggregate, for a term commencing during calendar year 2016 or calendar year 2017,\n\nthen, and, in any such event, Landlord shall be deemed to have satisfied Tenant's Expansion Needs Condition and, subject to the next following paragraph, Tenant shall have no right to exercise Tenant's Termination Right.\n\nPage 19\n\n(b) If Tenant exercises Tenant's Termination Right, the Effective Termination Date shall be the date fifteen (15) months after Landlord receives such Tenant's Termination Notice; and\n\n(c) For the purposes of determining the Termination Payment, the Unamortized Portion of Landlord's Transaction Costs shall be determined based upon the amount of principal which would remain unpaid as of the date fifteen (15) months after Landlord receives Tenant's Termination Notice, as set forth in clause (b) above.\n\n(D) Acceptable Expansion Space. \"Acceptable Expansion Space\" shall be defined as any area in the Waterfront Office Building offered to be leased by Landlord to Tenant pursuant to Landlord's Expansion Offer which (i) contains not less than eighty (80%) of the Rentable Floor Area (\"Minimum Expansion Space Floor Area\") nor more than one hundred twenty (120%) of the Rentable Floor Area requested to be leased by Tenant in the Expansion Request (\"Maximum Expansion Space Floor Area\") (the condition set forth in this clause (i) being referred to herein as the \"Size Condition\"), (ii) with respect to which the rent payable by Tenant is based upon the Prevailing Market Rent, as defined in Section 3.2 above, and (iii) the estimated Commencement Date with respect to the Acceptable Expansion Space will occur during calendar years 2016 or 2017 (the condition set forth in this clause (iii) being referred to herein as the \"Commencement Date Condition\").\n\n(E) Tenant's Right to Dispute Landlord's Expansion Offer; Tenant's Demise of Acceptable Expansion Space. If Landlord gives Tenant a Landlord's Expansion Offer to lease Acceptable Expansion Space pursuant to Section 3.5(C), then Tenant shall have the following options:\n\n(i) Tenant may unconditionally accept such Landlord's Expansion Offer by giving Landlord written notice (\"Tenant's Acceptance\") on or\n\nPage 20\n\nbefore the date fifteen (15) days after Tenant receives Landlord's Expansion Offer. If Tenant timely gives Tenant's Acceptance, then Landlord shall lease the Acceptable Expansion Space described in Landlord's Expansion Offer to Tenant, and Tenant shall demise such Acceptable Expansion Space from Landlord, on the terms and conditions set forth in Landlord's Expansion Offer, the terms of Section 3.3(D), and upon all of the terms and conditions of the Lease to the extent not inconsistent with Landlord's Expansion Offer; or\n\n(ii) Tenant may, by giving Landlord written notice (\"Tenant's Acceptance and Broker Determination Request\") on or before the date fifteen (15) days after Tenant receives Landlord's Expansion Offer, accept such Landlord's Expansion Offer, but assert that the Base Rent offered in Landlord's Expansion Offer is not the Prevailing Market Rent of the Acceptable Expansion Space specified in Landlord's Expansion Offer, and request a Broker Determination of such Base Rent in accordance with Exhibit H. Tenant's Acceptance and Broker Determination Request shall expressly accept Landlord's Expansion Offer and state that Tenant requests a Broker Determination. If Tenant timely gives Tenant's Acceptance and Broker Determination Request, then Tenant shall be conclusively be deemed to have accepted Landlord's Expansion Offer, Landlord shall lease the Acceptable Expansion Space described in Landlord's Expansion Offer to Tenant, and Tenant shall demise such Acceptable Expansion Space from Landlord, on the terms and conditions set forth in Landlord's Expansion Offer and upon all of the terms and conditions of the Lease to the extent not inconsistent with Landlord's Expansion Offer, except that the Base Rent payable by Tenant with respect to the Acceptable Expansion Space will be either as determined by the Broker Determination (and both parties shall be bound by such Broker Determination), or as mutually agreed to by the parties in writing,; or\n\n(iii) Tenant may give written notice (\"Objection Notice\") to Landlord asserting that the space identified in Landlord's Expansion Offer does not qualify as Acceptable Expansion Space because it does not satisfy either the Size Condition and/or the Commencement Date Condition. If Tenant delivers a timely Objection Notice to Landlord and if the space identified in Landlord's Expansion Offer does not, in fact, qualify as Acceptable Expansion Space, then Tenant may exercise Tenant's Termination Right unless Landlord delivers an acceptable Landlord's Expansion Offer to Tenant.\n\nIf Tenant does not, on or before the date fifteen (15) days after Tenant's receipt of Landlord's Expansion Offer, timely either give to Landlord a Tenant's Acceptance, a Tenant's Acceptance and Broker Determination Request, or an Objection Notice, then Tenant shall conclusively be deemed to have agreed that: (i) Landlord's Expansion Offer offered to lease Acceptable Expansion Space to Tenant for purposes of satisfying the Tenant's Expansion Needs Condition, and, therefore, (ii) Tenant has no right to exercise Tenant's Termination Right.\n\nPage 21\n\n(F) Acceptable Expansion Space Rescission Right. If the Commencement Date in respect of an Acceptable Expansion Space does not occur on or before the date one hundred fifty (150) days after the Estimated Commencement Date for such Acceptable Expansion Space, Tenant shall have the right (\"Tenant's Acceptable Expansion Space Rescission Right\") to cancel Tenant's demise of such Acceptable Expansion Space. Tenant may exercise Tenant's Acceptable Expansion Space Rescission Right by giving Landlord thirty (30) days written rescission notice (\"Tenant's Acceptable Expansion Space Rescission Notice\"). If the Commencement Date with respect to such Acceptable Expansion Space occurs on or before the date (\"Acceptable Expansion Space Effective Cancellation Date\") which is thirty (30) days after Landlord receives such Tenant's Acceptable Expansion Space Rescission Notice, then Tenant's Acceptable Expansion Space Rescission Notice shall be void and without force or effect, and Tenant shall have no right to cancel its demise of such Acceptable Expansion Space pursuant to this Section 3.5(F). If the Commencement Date with respect to such Acceptable Expansion Space does not occur on or before the date thirty (30) days after Landlord receives such Tenant's Acceptable Expansion Space Rescission Notice, then the Tenant's demise of such Acceptable Expansion Space shall be cancelled, and neither party shall have any further liability or obligation to the other party with respect to Tenant's attempted demise of such Acceptable Expansion Space. The effect of Tenant's exercise of Tenant's Acceptable Expansion Space Rescission Right shall be the same as if Tenant had failed timely to accept Landlord's offer to lease such Acceptable Expansion Space, except that, as provided in Section 3.5(C), Tenant's Termination Right shall be revived.\n\n(G) Termination Payment. Subject to the provisions of this Section 3.5(F), the \"Termination Payment\" shall be equal to the sum of: (i) the Unamortized Portion, as hereinafter defined, of Landlord's Transaction Costs, as hereinafter defined, plus (ii) the Rent Loss Payment, as hereinafter defined. The \"Rent Loss Payment\" shall be equal to $2,527,158.00, except that if (by reason of the exercise by Tenant of any of its Rescission Rights) the Effective Termination Date occurs after the last day of the seventh Lease Year, then the Rent Loss Payment shall be reduced by the amount of Base Rent to be paid by Tenant to Landlord between the last day of the seventh Lease Year and the Effective Termination Date.\n\nPage 22\n\npremises: any tenant allowances, any other costs incurred by Landlord in preparing such additional premises for Tenant's occupancy, brokerage commissions paid by Landlord in connection with the Lease, and legal fees incurred by Landlord in connection with the Lease. Landlord shall, upon written request of Tenant, from time to time, advise Tenant of the amount of Landlord's Transaction Costs and Landlord's Additional Premises Transaction Costs, to the extent that such information is then available to Landlord and Landlord's calculation of the Termination Payment.\n\n(I) Unamortized Portion. The \"Unamortized Portion\" shall be defined as the amount of principal which would remain unpaid as of the Effective Termination Date with respect to a loan in an original principal amount equal to the Landlord's Transaction Costs (or Landlord's Additional Premises Transaction Costs, as the case may be) and which is repaid in equal monthly payments of principal and interest on a direct reduction basis over the initial Term of the Lease with respect to the premises initially demised to Tenant (or the applicable additional premises, as the case may be) based upon an interest rate of six percent (6%) per annum.\n\n(J) If Tenant timely and properly exercises Tenant's Termination Right and pays the entire Termination Fee, pursuant to this Section 3.5, then the Term of the Lease shall terminate as of the Effective Termination Date as if the Effective Termination Date were the Expiration Date set forth in Section 1.2, and Annual Fixed Rent and other charges shall be apportioned as of said Effective Termination Date. If Tenant fails timely and properly to give Tenant's Termination Notice and to pay the first half of the Termination Fee, Tenant shall have no right to terminate the term of the Lease pursuant to this Section 3.5, time being of the essence hereof. If Tenant timely and properly gives Tenant's Termination Notice and pays the first half of the Termination Fee, but Tenant fails timely to pay the Balance of the Termination Fee on or before the Effective Termination Date and if Tenant fails to cure such failure on or before the date ten (10) days after Tenant receives written notice of such failure from Landlord, then Landlord shall have the right, at Landlord's election, to either : (i) declare Tenant's Termination Notice void and of no force or effect, in which case Landlord shall apply the first half of the Termination Fee paid by Tenant as a credit against Tenant's next succeeding obligation(s) to pay Annual Fixed Rent and other charges due under the Lease, or, (ii) to require Tenant to pay the balance of the Termination Fee, plus all legal fees incurred by Landlord in enforcing Tenant's obligation to pay the Balance of the Termination Fee.\n\n(K) If Tenant exercises its Termination Right pursuant to this Section 3.5, Tenant shall have no right to extend the Term of the Lease pursuant to Section 3.2.\n\nPage 23\n\nARTICLE IV\n\nCondition of Premises; Alterations\n\n4.0 Landlord's Work\n\nLandlord shall commence and diligently perform Landlord's Work in accordance with the Work Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit B and made a part hereof. In addition to the performance of the Landlord's Work, Landlord shall deliver the Premises to Tenant vacant, broom clean, free of all property, debris, Hazardous Materials, tenants or occupants. Subject to delays arising from Force Majeure, Landlord shall use diligent efforts to achieve Substantial Completion of Landlord's Work on or before the Estimated Commencement Date. However, except as set forth in Section II of Exhibit B, the failure of the Commencement Date to occur on or before the Estimated Commencement Date shall in no way affect the validity of this Lease or the obligations of Tenant hereunder nor shall the same be construed in any way to extend the Term of this Lease. Except as set forth in Section II of Exhibit B, if the Commencement Date does not occur on or before the Estimated Commencement Date, Tenant shall not have any claim against Landlord, and Landlord shall have no liability to Tenant, by reason thereof.\n\nARTICLE V\n\nAnnual Fixed Rent and Electricity\n\n5.1 Fixed Rent\n\nTenant agrees to pay to Landlord, commencing on the Commencement Date, and thereafter monthly, in advance, on the first day of each and every calendar month during the Original Lease Term, a sum equal to one-twelfth (1/12th) of the Annual Fixed Rent specified in Section 1.2 hereof for the applicable portion of the Term of this Lease and on the first day of each and every calendar month during each Extended Term (if exercised), a sum equal to one-twelfth of the Annual Fixed Rent as determined in Section 3.2 for the applicable Extended Term. Until notice of some other designation is given, fixed rent and all other charges for which provision is herein made shall be paid by remittance to or for the order of Boston Properties Limited Partnership either (i) by mail to P.O. Box 3557, Boston, Massachusetts 02241-3557, (ii) by wire transfer to Bank of America in Dallas, Texas, Bank Routing Number 0260-0959-3 or (iii) by ACH transfer to Bank of America in Dallas, Texas, Bank Routing Number 111 000 012, and in the case of (ii) or (iii) referencing Account Number 3756454460, Account Name of Boston Properties, LP, Tenant's name and Atlantic Wharf address. All remittances received by BOSTON PROPERTIES LIMITED PARTNERSHIP, as Agents as aforesaid, or by any subsequently designated recipient, shall be treated as a payment to Landlord.\n\nAnnual Fixed Rent for any partial month shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord at such rate on a pro rata basis based on a 365 day year, and, if the Commencement Date shall be\n\nPage 24\n\nother than the first day of a calendar month, the first payment of Annual Fixed Rent which Tenant shall make to Landlord shall be a payment equal to a proportionate part of such monthly Annual Fixed Rent for the partial month from the Commencement Date to the first day of the succeeding calendar month.\n\nAdditional Rent payable by Tenant on a monthly basis, as elsewhere provided in this Lease, likewise shall be prorated, and the first payment on account thereof shall be determined in similar fashion and, if applicable at that time, shall commence on the Commencement Date and other provisions of this Lease calling for monthly payments shall be read as incorporating this undertaking by Tenant.\n\nNotwithstanding that the payment of Annual Fixed Rent payable by Tenant to Landlord shall not commence until the Commencement Date, Tenant shall be subject to, and shall comply with, all other provisions of this Lease as and at the times provided in this Lease.\n\nThe Annual Fixed Rent and all other charges for which provision is made in this Lease shall be paid by Tenant to Landlord without setoff, deduction or abatement except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Lease.\n\n5.2 Allocation of Electricity Charges\n\nLandlord shall allocate the cost of electricity to Tenant in accordance with the procedure contained in Exhibit F, and Tenant shall pay for electricity as provided in said Exhibit F.\n\nARTICLE VI\n\nTaxes\n\n6.1 Definitions\n\nWith reference to the real estate taxes referred to in this Article VI, it is agreed that terms used herein are defined as follows:\n\n(a) \"Tax Year\" means the 12-month period beginning July 1 each year during the Lease Term or if the appropriate Governmental tax fiscal period shall begin on any date other than July 1, such other date with appropriate proration of any change.\n\n(b) \"Landlord's Tax Expenses Allocable to the Premises\" means the same proportion of Landlord's Tax Expenses as Rentable Floor Area of Tenant's Premises bears to 100% of the Total Rentable Floor Area of the Building.\n\n(c) \"Landlord's Tax Expenses\" with respect to any Tax Year means the aggregate \"real estate taxes\" (hereinafter defined) with respect to that Tax Year, reduced by any net abatement receipts with respect to that Tax Year but equitably adjusted to be a fully/assessed, fully occupied building.\n\nPage 25\n\nPage 26\n\nagreements then required to be entered into in the City of Boston for comparable properties, but shall not be included in real estate taxes to the extent any such agreement is not so required or consistent.\n\n(e) \"Base Taxes\" means Landlord's Tax Expenses (hereinbefore defined) for fiscal tax year 2012 (that is the period beginning July 1, 2011 and ending June 30, 2012), provided, however, the Base Taxes shall be equitably adjusted and grossed up as if the Building (or the applicable portion of Atlantic Wharf on which Base Taxes are based) were to be a fully assessed, fully occupied building. Landlord represents and warrants to Tenant that, as of the Execution Date of this Lease, there are no tax agreements, tax credits, tax abatements or other tax incentives applicable to the Base Taxes for the Building which expire or terminate during the Term of this Lease.\n\n(f) \"Base Taxes Allocable to the Premises\" means the same proportion of Base Taxes as the Rentable Floor Area of Tenant's Premises bears to 100% of the Total Rentable Floor Area of the Building.\n\n(g) If during the Lease Term the Tax Year is changed by applicable law to less than a full 12-month period, the Base Taxes and Base Taxes Allocable to the Premises shall each be proportionately reduced.\n\n6.2 Tenant's Share of Real Estate Taxes\n\nIf with respect to any full Tax Year or fraction of a Tax Year falling within the Lease Term Landlord's Tax Expenses Allocable to the Premises for a full Tax Year exceed Base Taxes Allocable to the Premises or for any such fraction of a Tax Year exceed the corresponding fraction of Base Taxes Allocable to the Premises (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the \"Tax Excess\"), then Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, the amount of such Tax Excess. Payments by Tenant on account of the Tax Excess shall be made monthly at the time and in the fashion herein provided for the payment of Annual Fixed Rent. The amount so to be paid to Landlord shall be an amount from time to time reasonably estimated by Landlord to be sufficient to provide Landlord, in the aggregate, a sum equal to the Tax Excess, ten (10) days at least before the day on which tax payments by Landlord would become delinquent. Not later than ninety (90) days after Landlord's Tax Expenses Allocable to the Premises are determinable for the first such Tax Year or fraction thereof and for each succeeding Tax Year or fraction thereof during the Lease Term, Landlord shall render Tenant a statement in reasonable detail certified by a representative of Landlord showing for the preceding year or fraction thereof, as the case may be, real estate taxes allocated to the Building, abatements and refunds, if any, of any such taxes and assessments, expenditures incurred in seeking such abatement or refund, the amount of the Tax Excess, the amount thereof already paid by Tenant and the amount thereof overpaid by, or remaining due from, Tenant for the period covered by such statement, together with copies of all of the tax bills from the City of Boston on which such calculations are based. Landlord shall provide Tenant with a\n\nPage 27\n\nstatement of the amount of Taxes included in Base Taxes following the conclusion of the Base Tax Year, and if requested by Tenant together with copies of all of the tax bills from the City of Boston on which such calculations are based. Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of such statement, Tenant shall pay any sum remaining due. Any balance shown as due to Tenant shall be credited against Annual Fixed Rent next due, or refunded to Tenant if the Lease Term has then expired and Tenant has no further obligation to Landlord. Reasonable expenditures for legal fees and for other expenses incurred in obtaining an abatement or refund may be charged against the abatement or refund before the adjustments are made for the Tax Year.\n\nTo the extent that real estate taxes shall be payable to the taxing authority in installments with respect to periods less than a Tax Year, the statement to be furnished by Landlord shall be rendered and payments made on account of such installments.\n\nLandlord shall, within thirty (30) days after Landlord receives written notice from the Tax Assessor of the City of Boston setting forth the assessed value of the Building for the Base Tax Year, provide to Tenant a written statement of the amount of assessed value of the Building which Landlord intends to use as the basis for Base Taxes and the manner in which Landlord determined such amount. After Landlord delivers such statement to Tenant, the parties shall meet at a mutually acceptable time to discuss Landlord's determination of such assessed value.\n\nARTICLE VII\n\nLandlord's Repairs and Services and Tenant's Escalation Payments\n\n7.1 Structural Repairs; Water Tightness\n\nExcept for damage caused by fire or casualty or by eminent domain which shall be covered by Article XIV of this Lease, Landlord shall, throughout the Lease Term, at Landlord's sole cost and expense, keep and maintain, or cause to be kept and maintained, in good order, condition and repair generally and reasonably consistent with other high quality Class A office buildings in the Central Business District in Boston and in conformance with all Legal Requirements, including necessary capital repairs and replacements, the following portions of the Building: all structural and non-structural portions and components of the roof systems (including roof membranes), the exterior and load bearing walls, the foundation, the structural columns, mullions, floor/ceiling slabs, exterior glass, shafts and other structural elements of the Building and the reasonable weatherizing of the Building; provided however, that, subject to Section 13.13, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, the cost of any and all such repairs which may be required as a result of repairs, alterations, or installations made by Tenant or any subtenant, assignee, licensee or concessionaire of Tenant or any agent, servant, employee or contractor of any of them or to the extent of any loss, destruction or damage caused by the negligent act or omission of Tenant, any assignee or subtenant or any agent, servant, employee, customer, visitor or contractor of any of them.\n\nPage 28\n\n7.2 Other Repairs to be Made by Landlord\n\nExcept for damage caused by fire or casualty or by eminent domain which shall be covered by Article XIV of this Lease, and except as otherwise provided in this Lease, and subject to provisions for reimbursement by Tenant as contained in Section 7.5, Landlord agrees to keep and maintain, or cause to be kept and maintained, in good order, condition and repair generally and reasonably consistent with other high quality Class A office buildings in the Central Business District in Boston and in conformance with all Legal Requirements, the common areas and facilities of the Building, including the base building mechanical, electrical, plumbing, sprinkler, fire/life safety, and access control systems and the base building heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (\"Base Building HVAC\") systems serving the Premises and the Building and other common Building systems equipment servicing the Premises, except that Landlord shall in no event be responsible to Tenant for (a) subject to Section 13.13, the condition of glass in and about the Premises (other than for glass in exterior walls for which Landlord shall be responsible unless the damage thereto is attributable to Tenant's negligence or misuse, in which event the responsibility for the cost thereof shall be Tenant's), or (b) subject to Section 13.13, any condition in the Premises or the Building caused by any act or neglect of Tenant or any agent, employee, contractor, assignee, subtenant, licensee, concessionaire or invitee of Tenant. Without limitation, Landlord shall not be responsible to make any improvements or repairs to the Building or the Premises other than as expressly provided in Section 7.1 or in this Section 7.2, unless expressly otherwise provided in this Lease or the Condominium Documents.

In addition, Landlord agrees to furnish, at Tenant's expense, reasonable additional Building operation services which are usual and customary in similar buildings in Boston, and such additional special services as may be mutually agreed upon by Landlord and Tenant, upon reasonable and equitable rates from time to time established by Landlord. Tenant agrees to pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, the cost of any such additional Building services requested by Tenant and for the cost of any additions, alterations, improvements or other work performed by Landlord in the Premises at the request of Tenant within thirty (30) days after being billed therefor.

Base Operating Expenses shall not include market-wide cost increases due to extraordinary circumstances, including but not limited to, Force Majeure (as defined in Section 14.1), boycotts, strikes, conservation surcharges, embargoes or shortages. For purposes of this Section 7.4, \"market-wide cost increases due to extraordinary circumstances\" shall mean an actual, material increase in a category of Landlord's Operating Expenses under this Lease in excess of the amount reasonably budgeted by Landlord for such expense category in the Base Operating Expenses which is attributable to some unanticipated event or circumstance occurring during the Base Year and that affects the Central Business District of the City of Boston in general for a temporary period of time and where the costs for such category(ies) subsequently returns, within not more than nine (9) months after the calendar year used for calculating Base Operating Expenses, to amounts that would otherwise have been consistent with the projected and normal level of increases in such category(ies) of costs during subsequent years of the Term. If there are elements of Building repair and maintenance which would have been included in Base Operating Expenses except that such repair and maintenance is covered under construction or installation warranties or service contracts, then the costs which would have been incurred but for such warranties or service contracts shall be included in Base Operating Expenses, less the reasonable costs incurred by Landlord in enforcing such warranties and less the cost of any such service contracts. \"Base Operating Expenses Allocable to the Premises\" means the same proportion of Base Operating Expenses as the Rentable Floor Area of Tenant's Premises bears to 100% of the Total Rentable Floor Area of the Building. \"Operating Expenses for the Building\" means the cost of operation of the Building and the Building's share (allocated per the Condominium Documents) of the cost of operating the common areas of Atlantic Wharf as more specifically provided below in Section 7.4, including those incurred in discharging the obligations under Sections 7.2 and 7.3; however there shall be excluded from the Operating Expenses for the Building all costs solely relating to the operation and maintenance of the Garage or the retail and residential portions of Atlantic Wharf. In no event shall Landlord have the right to include in Operating Expenses for the Building more than 100% of the Building's allocable share of any Operating Expense and, so long as Landlord is operating the multi-media center in accordance with the requirements of the Chapter 91 license applicable to Atlantic Wharf (as the same may be modified by amendment or waiver), all revenue and user fees collected from use of the multi-media center shall be credited against the operating expenses of such facility. In addition, such costs shall exclude payments of debt service and any other mortgage charges, brokerage commissions, real estate taxes (to the extent paid pursuant to Section 6.2 hereof), and costs of special services rendered to tenants (including Tenant) for which a separate charge is made, but shall include, without limitation:\n\nPage 30\n\n(a) compensation, wages and all fringe benefits, workmen's compensation insurance premiums and payroll taxes paid to, for or with respect to all persons up to and including the level of Regional Property Manager for their services in the operating, maintaining, managing, insuring or cleaning of the Building. To the extent, if any, that any such persons shall perform any work with respect to the Building and other buildings in or common areas of Atlantic Wharf or other properties of Landlord or its affiliates, there shall be a reasonable allocation to the Building of the aforesaid charges and items payable to such persons among other buildings, areas and properties so served;\n\n(b) payments under service contracts with independent contractors for operating, maintaining or cleaning of the Building;\n\n(c) steam, water, sewer, gas, oil, electricity and telephone charges (excluding such utility charges separately chargeable to tenants for additional or separate services and excluding electricity for plugs, lights and supplemental heating, ventilating and air-conditioning supplied to leasable areas of the Building) and costs of maintaining letters of credit or other security as may be required by utility companies as a condition of providing such services;\n\n(d) cost of maintenance, cleaning and repairs and replacements (other than repairs not properly chargeable against income or reimbursable from contractors under guarantees);\n\n(e) cost of snow removal and the cost of landscaping services;\n\n(f) cost of building and cleaning supplies and equipment;\n\nPage 31\n\nPartnership, such coverages shall be of the type and amounts customarily required to be carried by lenders of comparable class A, multi-tenant office buildings in Central Business District of the City of Boston;\n\n(h) management fees at reasonable rates for self managed buildings consistent with the type of occupancy and the services rendered, but in no event at a rate of more than four percent (4%) of fixed and additional rent scheduled for the Building (excluding Tenant electricity reimbursements), parking fees and the aforesaid management fees), the parties agreeing that in calculating the amount of management fees included in Operating Expenses for any calendar year (including the Base Year), management fees shall grossed up as if the Building were 95% occupied (i.e., determined as full rent were being paid on any space which is vacant during such year and on any space with respect to which the tenant is receiving the benefit of free rent or rent abatements);\n\n(i) the Building's share (determined in accordance with the Condominium Documents) of Operating Expenses (as herein defined in this Section 7.4) related to the operation (and insurance) of the open areas, interior and exterior public areas and amenities, plazas, common areas, facilities and other non-leasable areas of Atlantic Wharf including the Lot, and the Public Spaces (but not including any portion of the Russia Building) and other mixed use common area maintenance costs incurred by Landlord or any other owner and allocated to the Building and any shuttle buses and other like amenities, for use of tenants of the Building either alone or in common with tenants of other buildings in Atlantic Wharf and any contributions or payments respecting the Rose Kennedy Greenway;\n\n(j) depreciation for capital expenditures made by Landlord during the Lease Term but only with respect to capital expenditures incurred (x) to reduce Operating Expenses if Landlord reasonably shall have determined that the annual reduction in Operating Expenses shall exceed depreciation therefor or (y) to comply with Legal Requirements effective after the date of this Lease (the capital expenditures described in subsections (x) and (y) being hereinafter referred to as \"Permitted Capital Expenditures\") plus, in the case of both (x) and (y), an interest factor, reasonably determined by Landlord, as being the interest rate then charged for long term mortgages by institutional lenders on like properties within the general locality in which the Building is located, and depreciation in the case of both (x) and (y) shall be determined by dividing the original cost of such capital expenditure by the number of years of useful life of the capital item acquired, which useful life shall be determined reasonably by Landlord in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices in effect at the time of acquisition of the capital item; provided, however, if Landlord reasonably concludes on the basis of engineering estimates that a particular capital expenditure will effect savings in other Operating\n\nPage 32\n\nExpenses, including, without limitation, energy related costs, and that such projected savings will, on an annual basis (\"Projected Annual Savings\"), exceed the annual depreciation therefor, then and in such event the amount of depreciation for such capital expenditure shall be increased to an amount equal to the Projected Annual Savings; and in such circumstance, the increased depreciation (in the amount of the Projected Annual Savings) shall be made for such period of time as it would take to fully amortize the cost of the item in question, together with interest thereon at the interest rate as aforesaid in equal monthly payments, each in the amount of 1/12th of the Projected Annual Savings, with such payment to be applied first to interest and the balance to principal; and\n\n(k) all other reasonable and necessary expenses paid in connection with the operating, cleaning and maintenance of the Building or said common areas and facilities of the Building consistent with other high quality Class A buildings in the Central Business District of Boston and properly chargeable against income.\n\nNotwithstanding anything in this Lease to the contrary, to the extent that Landlord provides or procures services for the Building together with other buildings in Atlantic Wharf or otherwise operated by Landlord or any affiliate thereof, then the costs of such services shall be allocated between the Building and such other buildings in a manner reasonably determined by Landlord.\n\nNotwithstanding any of the foregoing, all of the items of expense listed in Exhibit M attached hereto and made a part hereof entitled Operating Expense Exclusions, are excluded from Operating Expenses.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, in determining the amount of Operating Expenses for the Building for any calendar year or portion thereof falling within the Lease Term (including the calendar year in which Base Operating Expenses are determined), if less than one hundred percent (100%) of the Total Rentable Floor Area of the Building shall have been occupied by tenants at any time during the period in question, then, with respect to the Base Year then, at Landlord's election, with respect to years after the Base Year, but on a mandatory basis for the Base Year, those components of Operating Expenses for the Building that vary based on occupancy for such period shall be adjusted to equal the amount such components of Operating Expenses for the Building would have been for such period had occupancy been one hundred percent (100%) throughout such period.\n\n7.5 Tenant's Escalation Payments\n\n(A) If with respect to any calendar year falling within the Lease Term, or fraction of a calendar year falling within the Lease Term at the beginning or end thereof, the Operating Expenses Allocable to the Premises (as defined in Section 7.4) for a full calendar year exceed Base Operating Expenses Allocable to the Premises (as\n\nPage 33\n\ndefined in Section 7.4) or for any such fraction of a calendar year exceed the corresponding fraction of Base Operating Expenses Allocable to the Premises (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the \"Operating Cost Excess\"), then Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as Additional Rent, on or before the thirtieth (30th) day following receipt by Tenant of the statement referred to below in this Section 7.5, the amount of such Operating Cost Excess.\n\n(B) Estimated payments by Tenant on account of the Operating Cost Excess shall be made monthly at the time and in the fashion herein provided for the payment of Annual Fixed Rent. The amount so to be paid to Landlord shall be an amount reasonably estimated by Landlord in writing to Tenant from time to time (but no more than twice in any calendar year) to be sufficient to cover, in the aggregate, a sum equal to the Operating Cost Excess for each calendar year during the Lease Term.\n\n(C) No later than one hundred twenty (120) days after the end of the first calendar year or fraction thereof ending December 31 and of each succeeding calendar year during the Lease Term or fraction thereof at the end of the Lease Term, Landlord shall render Tenant a statement in reasonable detail and according to usual accounting practices consistently applied and certified by a representative of Landlord, showing for the preceding calendar year or fraction thereof, as the case may be, the Operating Expenses for the Building and the Operating Expenses Allocable to the Premises. The first such Operating Expense Statement from Landlord under this Lease shall also set forth the Base Operating Expenses and the Base Operating Expenses Allocable to the Premises. Said statement to be rendered to Tenant also shall show for the preceding year or fraction thereof, as the case may be, the amounts already paid by Tenant on account of Operating Cost Excess and the amount of Operating Cost Excess remaining due from, or overpaid by, Tenant for the year or other period covered by the statement.\n\nIf such statement shows a balance remaining due to Landlord, Tenant shall pay same to Landlord on or before the thirtieth (30th) day following receipt by Tenant of said statement. Any balance shown as due to Tenant shall be credited against Annual Fixed Rent next due, or refunded to Tenant within thirty (30) days if the Lease Term has then expired and Tenant has no further obligation to Landlord.\n\nAny payment by Tenant for the Operating Cost Excess shall not be deemed to waive any rights of Tenant to claim that the amount thereof was not determined in accordance with the provisions of this Lease.\n\n(D) In the event of any dispute regarding the amount due as Tenant's Operating Cost Excess, Tenant shall have the right, after reasonable notice and at reasonable times during normal business hours, to inspect and photocopy Landlord's accounting records relating to the Operating Costs Excess for the period in question at Landlord's office in Boston, MA, provided Tenant shall exercise such right with respect to any calendar year by giving such notice to Landlord within\n\nPage 34\n\none hundred (100) days after Tenant shall receive a bill or reconciliation from Landlord concerning Operating Costs for such calendar year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Tenant has not previously exercised its right, pursuant to this Paragraph (D), to examine Landlord's accounting records relating to Operating Costs Excess for calendar year 2012, Tenant shall have the right to make such examination at the same time that Tenant properly exercises its right to examine Landlord's accounting records relating to Operating Costs Excess for calendar year 2013 or 2014. Time is of the essence as to any notice. Further, in no event shall Tenant have the right to make any such examination (whether by itself or with an examiner) more than once in respect of any year in which Landlord has given Tenant a statement of Operating Costs, unless review of a subsequent period gives rise to the disclosure of a miscalculation or error that may apply to any of the two (2) calendar years prior to the calendar year for which such miscalculation or error has been discovered; provided, however that if any such prior calendar year was subject to a previous examination, then no further review of such prior calendar year shall be permitted. If, after such inspection and photocopying, Tenant continues to dispute the amount of its Operating Cost Excess, Tenant or an independent professional firm designated by Tenant (including FHO Partners) shall be entitled to audit and/or review Landlord's records relating to the period in question with respect to the proper amount of Operating Cost Excess; provided that no auditor engaged by Tenant shall be paid on a contingent fee basis. As a condition to performing any such examination, Tenant and its examiners shall be required to execute and deliver to Landlord a commercially reasonable agreement, in form reasonably acceptable to Landlord, agreeing to keep confidential any information about Landlord or the Building obtained in the course of such examination.\n\nIf such audit or review reveals that Landlord has overcharged Tenant, then within thirty (30) days after the results of such audit are made available to Landlord, Landlord shall reimburse Tenant the amount of such overcharge plus interest thereon at the Lease Interest Rate. If the audit reveals that Tenant was undercharged, then within thirty (30) days after the results of the audit are made available to Tenant, Tenant shall reimburse Landlord the amount of such undercharge plus interest thereon at the Lease Interest Rate. If Landlord desires to contest such audit results, Landlord may do so by submitting the results of the audit to arbitration pursuant to the then current rules and procedures of the American Arbitration Association within sixty (60) days of receipt of the results of the audit, and the arbitration shall be final and binding upon Landlord and Tenant. The cost of the arbitrator engaged in connection with such arbitration shall be shared equally between the parties.\n\nTenant agrees to pay the cost of its own audit, provided that if the audit reveals that Landlord's determination of Operating Cost Excess as set forth in any statement sent to Tenant was in error in Landlord's favor by more than Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00), Landlord shall pay the cost of such audit. Landlord shall provide Tenant with a statement of the Operating Costs incurred in\n\nPage 35\n\nthe Base Year following the conclusion of the such Base Year, and Tenant's audit right shall include but not be limited to the right to audit and review Landlord's records with respect to such Base Year.\n\n7.6 No Damage\n\nLandlord shall not be liable to Tenant for any compensation or reduction of rent by reason of inconvenience or annoyance or for loss of business arising from the necessity of Landlord or its agents entering the Premises for any purposes in this Lease authorized, or for repairing the Premises or any portion of the Building or Atlantic Wharf however the necessity may occur provided that except in case of emergency repairs, Landlord will give Tenant reasonable advance notice of any contemplated stoppage or entry (except in the event of emergencies and in connection with normal cleaning and maintenance operations) and will use reasonable efforts to avoid unnecessary inconvenience to Tenant by reason thereof. Except in the event of an emergency, Tenant may have the right to have an employee or other representative of Tenant accompany Landlord when Landlord is making such entry. In exercising any right which Landlord has to enter the Premises, Landlord shall use reasonable efforts to minimize any interference with Tenant's use of the Premises. In case Landlord is prevented or delayed from making any repairs, alterations or improvements, or furnishing any services or performing any other covenant or duty to be performed on Landlord's part, by reason of any cause reasonably beyond Landlord's control, including, without limitation, by reason of Force Majeure (as defined in Section 14.1 hereof) or for any cause due to any act or neglect of Tenant or Tenant's servants, agents, employees, licensees or any person claiming by, through or under Tenant, Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant therefor, nor, except as expressly otherwise provided in this Lease, shall Tenant be entitled to any abatement or reduction of rent by reason thereof, or right to terminate this Lease, nor shall the same give rise to a claim in Tenant's favor that such failure constitutes actual or constructive, total or partial, eviction from the Premises.\n\nLandlord reserves the right to stop any service or utility system, when necessary by reason of accident or emergency, or until necessary repairs have been completed; provided, however, that in each instance of stoppage, Landlord shall exercise reasonable diligence to eliminate the cause thereof. Except in case of emergency repairs, Landlord will give Tenant reasonable advance notice of any contemplated stoppage and will use reasonable efforts to avoid unnecessary inconvenience to Tenant by reason thereof.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, and solely for the purposes of this Section 7.6, an \"Abatement Event\" shall be defined as an event or circumstance where a portion of the Premises becomes untenantable and Tenant ceases to occupy such portion of the Premises resulting from or caused by: (i) any repairs, alterations, replacements or improvements made by Landlord, (ii) Landlord's failure to make any repairs, alterations, or improvements required to be made by Landlord hereunder, or to provide any service required to be provided by Landlord hereunder, or to remediate any Hazardous Materials, as defined in Section 11.2 and provided that such Hazardous Materials were not used, stored, or disposed of by Tenant, anyone claiming by, through or under Tenant, or any of\n\nPage 36\n\ntheir respective agents, employees or contractors, or (iii) any failure of Landlord to provide electrical, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, or all elevator service to the Premises or reasonable access to the Premises. Tenant shall give Landlord notice (\"Abatement Notice\") of any such Abatement Event, and if such Abatement Event continues beyond the \"Eligibility Period\" (as that term is defined below), then the Annual Fixed Rent and Tenant's payments on account of Landlord's Tax Expenses Allocable to the Premises and Operating Expenses Allocable to the Premises shall be abated entirely or reduced, as the case may be, after expiration of the Eligibility Period for such time that Tenant continues to be so prevented from using, and does not use, the Premises or a portion thereof, in the proportion that the rentable area of the portion of the Premises that Tenant is prevented from using, and does not use, bears to the total Rentable Floor Area of the Premises. The term \"Eligibility Period\" shall mean (i) as the result of an Abatement Event due to an event or circumstance within Landlord's reasonable control, a period of three (3) consecutive days after Landlord's receipt of any Abatement Notice(s) and (ii) as the result of an Abatement Event due to an event or circumstance not within Landlord's reasonable control, a period of fifteen (15) consecutive days after Landlord's receipt of any Abatement Notice(s). Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, in no event shall any of the events referred to in this Section 7.6 give rise to a claim in Tenant's favor that such failure constitutes actual or constructive, total or partial, eviction from the Premises\n\nARTICLE VIII\n\nTenant's Repairs\n\n8.1 Tenant's Repairs and Maintenance\n\nTenant covenants and agrees that, from and after the date that possession of the Premises is delivered to Tenant and until the end of the Lease Term, (except during construction of Tenant's Work (which shall be governed by Work Letters).Tenant will keep neat and clean and maintain in good order, condition and repair the Premises and every part thereof, excepting only for those repairs or other obligations for which Landlord is responsible under the terms of Article VII of this Lease conditions caused by the negligence or willful misconduct of Landlord or its employees, agents or contractors, and damage by fire or casualty and as a consequence of the exercise of the power of eminent domain. Tenant shall not permit or commit any waste, and, subject to Section 13.13, Tenant shall be responsible for the cost of repairs which may be made necessary by reason of damages to common areas in the Building or at Atlantic Wharf by Tenant, Tenant's agents, employees, contractors, sublessees, licensees, concessionaires or invitees (other than ordinary wear and tear). Tenant shall maintain all its equipment, furniture and furnishings in good order and repair.\n\nIf repairs are required to be made by Tenant pursuant to the terms hereof, Landlord may demand that Tenant make the same forthwith, and, subject to the next following sentence, if Tenant refuses or neglects to commence such repairs and complete the same within\n\nPage 37\n\nthirty (30) days after written notice (or such longer period of time as Tenant may reasonably require to complete the same, provided that Tenant commences to perform such repairs within such thirty (30) day period and thereafter diligently prosecutes such repairs to completion), Landlord may (but shall not be required to do so) make or cause such repairs to be made and shall not be responsible to Tenant for any loss or damage that may accrue to Tenant's stock or business by reason thereof except to the extent of the negligence or willful misconduct of any Landlord Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in emergencies, Landlord may exercise its rights under the immediately preceding sentence without prior notice to Tenant. If Landlord makes or causes such repairs to be made, Tenant agrees that Tenant will forthwith within thirty (30) days of Landlord's demand, pay to Landlord as Additional Rent the cost thereof together with interest thereon at the rate specified in Section 16.21, and if Tenant shall default in such payment, Landlord shall have the remedies provided for non-payment of rent or other charges payable hereunder.\n\nARTICLE IX\n\nAlterations\n\n9.1 Landlord's Approval\n\nTenant covenants and agrees not to make alterations, additions or improvements to the Premises (other than Cosmetic Alterations, as hereinafter defined), whether before or during the Lease Term, except in accordance with plans and specifications therefor first approved by Landlord in writing, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. However, Landlord's determination of matters relating to aesthetic issues relating to alterations, additions or improvements which are visible outside the Premises shall be in Landlord's sole discretion. Without limiting such standard, Landlord shall not be deemed unreasonable:\n\nPage 38\n\nacceptable to Landlord for payment of such increased cost and that such readaptation will be made prior to such termination without expense to Landlord.\n\n(b) for making its approval conditional on Tenant's agreement to restore the Premises to its condition prior to such alteration, addition, or improvement at the expiration or earlier termination of the Lease Term. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, Landlord agrees that Tenant will not be required to remove any alterations, additions, or improvements which: (i) are found in typical business offices in the Central Business District of the City of Boston, and (ii) are not, in Landlord's reasonable judgment, unusual costly to remove and restore. Without limiting the foregoing, Landlord shall, in any event, have the right to require Tenant to remove internal staircases and Cable. If Tenant makes any alterations, additions or improvements to the Premises, then Landlord may, except as provided above, elect to require Tenant at the expiration or sooner termination of the Term of this Lease to restore the Premises to substantially the same condition as existed at the Commencement Date.

Within 30 days after receipt of an invoice from Landlord, Tenant shall pay to Landlord, as a fee for Landlord's review of any plans or work (excluding any review respecting initial improvements performed pursuant to Exhibit B or other improvements for which a fee had previously been paid, but including any review of plans or work relating to any assignment or subletting), as Additional Rent, an amount equal to the sum of : (i) $150.00 per hour for technical reviews performed in-house by Landlord's professional staff, plus (ii) if Landlord reasonably determines that a third-party consultant is needed to review such work or plans, then Tenant shall reimburse Landlord for the reasonable third-party out-of-pocket costs incurred by Landlord in hiring said third party to review Tenant's plans and Tenant's work.\n\nPage 39\n\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, Tenant shall have the right, without obtaining Landlord's consent, to either: (x) make cosmetic interior nonstructural alterations, additions or improvements other than installing paint and carpet, the cost of which do not exceed Four Hundred Thousand and 00/100 ($400,000.00) Dollars, or (y) install paint and carpet (collectively \"Cosmetic Alterations\"), provided however that:\n\n(i) Tenant shall give prior written notice to Landlord of such Cosmetic Alterations;\n\n(ii) Tenant shall submit to Landlord plans for such Alterations if Tenant utilizes plans for such Cosmetic Alterations; and\n\n(iii) such Cosmetic Alterations shall not materially affect any of the Building's systems, or the ceiling of the Premises.\n\nUpon and subject to the provisions of this Lease, Tenant may construct internal staircases between floors within the Premises that are located in the Waterfront Office Building and Tenant shall have the right to select the location of such internal staircases, subject to Tenant's obtaining Landlord's prior written approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.\n\n9.2 Conformity of Work\n\nTenant covenants and agrees that any alterations, additions, improvements or installations made by it to or upon the Premises shall be done in a good and workmanlike manner and in compliance with all applicable Legal Requirements and Insurance Requirements now or hereafter in force, that materials of first and otherwise good quality shall be employed therein, that the structure of the Building shall not be endangered or impaired thereby and that the Premises shall not be diminished in value thereby.\n\n9.3 Performance of Work, Governmental Permits and Insurance\n\nAll of Tenant's alterations and additions and installation of furnishings shall be coordinated with any work being performed by or for Landlord and in such manner as to maintain harmonious labor relations and not to damage the Building or Atlantic Wharf or interfere with Building construction or operation and, except for installation of furnishings, shall be performed by Landlord's general contractor or by contractors or workers first approved by Landlord, as to which Landlord agrees to act reasonably. Except for work by Landlord's general contractor, Tenant shall procure all necessary governmental permits before making any repairs, alterations, other improvements or installations. Tenant agrees to save harmless and indemnify Landlord from any and all injury, loss, claims or damage to any person or property occasioned by or arising out of the doing of any such work whether the same be performed prior to or during the Term of\n\nPage 40\n\nthis Lease.

Without limiting any of Tenant's obligations hereunder, Tenant shall be responsible, as Additional Rent, for the costs of any alterations, additions or improvements in or to the Building that are required in order to comply with Legal Requirements as a result of any work performed by Tenant. Landlord shall have the right to provide rules and regulations relative to the performance of any alterations, additions, improvements and installations by Tenant hereunder, including, without limitation, payment for the costs of using Building services, provided such rules and regulations and charges are reasonable and are generally promulgated and applied to all tenants in Atlantic Wharf on a non-discriminatory basis, and Tenant shall abide by all such reasonable rules and regulations and shall cause all of its contractors to so abide. Tenant acknowledges and agrees that Landlord shall be the owner of any additions, alterations and improvements in the Premises or the Building to the extent paid for by Landlord.\n\n9.4 Liens\n\nTenant covenants and agrees to pay promptly when due the entire cost of any work done on the Premises by Tenant, its agents, employees or contractors, and not to cause or permit any liens for labor or materials performed or furnished in connection therewith to attach to the Premises or the Building or Atlantic Wharf and immediately upon receipt of notice or actual knowledge to discharge any such liens which may so attach.\n\n9.5 Nature of Alterations\n\nAll work, construction, repairs, alterations, other improvements or installations made to or upon the Premises (including, but not limited to, the construction performed by Landlord under Article IV), shall become part of "
