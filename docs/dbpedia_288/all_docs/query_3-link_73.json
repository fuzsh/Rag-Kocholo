        "text": "National Night Out (NNO) is a celebration of community and public safety agencies coming together to promote community policing partnerships.\n\nDuring the event, residents throughout Alexandria are asked to come outside and enjoy the evening with their neighbors, police, firefighters, and other City officials. Events held will vary by neighborhood and include cookouts, block parties, and more.\n\nThe Alexandria Police Department's K-9 Unit, Motorcycle Unit, Bike Patrol, Command Staff and patrol officers will tour neighborhoods and offer special demonstrations with members of Alexandria Sheriffâ€™s Office and Alexandria Fire Department and other public safety agencies.\n\nNNO is designed to increase crime prevention awareness, generate support for crime prevention programs, and send a message to criminals that neighborhoods are organized, and are in partnership with law enforcement and public safety agencies to help prevent crime.\n\nNNO was introduced in August of 1984 through an already established network of law enforcement agencies, neighborhood watch groups, civic groups, state and regional crime prevention associations and volunteers across the nation. The first annual National Night Out involved 2.5 million neighbors across 400 communities in 23 states.\n\nAccording to NNO, last year's event was the largest ever that involved 38 million people in 17,000 communities from all 50 states, U.S. territories and military bases worldwide."
