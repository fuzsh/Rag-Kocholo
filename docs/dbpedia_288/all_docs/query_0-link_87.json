        "text": "Whether you've lived in Boston all your life, recently moved here or are stopping by for a visit, the iconic Harborwalk can offer a ton of fun all year round.\n\nConceived of as a way to connect the public to the-then redeveloping Waterfront and Wharf District, three decades worth of innovation have resulted in the now extensive 43 mile long network of rich and diverse pathways winding through 8 neighborhoods. With so much to see and do while exploring, you'll be exposed to multiple examples of Boston's evolving over time --- from its humble origins as a colonial town to the dizzying heights of new horizons, waterways and the urban sprawl.\n\nUp for a bite-sized adventure?\n\nIf you were to start right at the Christopher Columbus Waterfront Park, one of the first nice little additions you'd notice besides the ship-shaped Marriott Hotel would be the famous trellis, known for its seasonal illuminations. Covered in fresh greenery, the trellis is a great photo opportunity day or night. Take in the scenery uniting the nearby North End with life by the water's edge\n\nThe nearby boardwalk will connect you to Long Wharf , The Chart House (formerly John Hancock's Counting House) and a splendid sundial and flagpole. The duckhouse next to the marina is something of a local landmark with, you guessed it, plenty of cute feathered creatures mingling with the crowds.\n\nCentral Wharf is where the New England Aquarium has been welcoming visitors young and old since 1969, with several harbor ferries and whale watch vessels ready to spirit you off to sea. You'll also pass by Rowes Wharf with its wide open arch beckoning the curious to summer concerts and views of the Northern avenue Bridge. The wharves helped to establish Boston as a booming maritime port for centuries, some named for their trading origins like India and Russia Wharf.\n\nBefore walking across the elegant Evelyn Moakley Bridge, stop by the Independence Wharf Observation Deck. You'll be able to admire the industrial origins of the Fort Point Channel, [and as you enter the Seaport with its modern architecture and rapidly evolving skyscape you'll gain a sense of just how much Boston has expanded over the years.\n\nFan Pier is where you may feel closest to ocean vibes. Sunrises, sunsets, and so many ships of all shapes and sizes rise with the tide. Even a brief trip like this can offer locals, new arrivals and newcomers alike with a sense of appreciation and opportunities to make memories in one of the world's most amazing destinations.\n\nAlong the way on your bite-sized adventure you can check out some of Boston's iconic Waterfront residential real estate such as:\n\nHarbor Towers\n\nRowes Wharf\n\nIntercontinental Residences\n\n22 Liberty\n\n50 Liberty\n\n300 Pier 4\n\nBrowse Boston Real Estate\n\nLUXURY CONDOS | LUXURY RENTALS | NEIGHBORHOODS"
