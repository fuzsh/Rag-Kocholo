        "text": "The city of Balneário Camboriú in southeast Brazil has officially approved the construction of the Triumph Tower, which will stand at a staggering 1,785 feet, making it the world's tallest residential building.\n\nThe project is spearheaded by FG Empreendimentos, a prominent construction company co-founded by local businessman Jean Graciola. This new development is set to further elevate the city's status, which already boasts some of South America's tallest buildings, such as the 965-foot Yachthouse Towers and the 951-foot One Tower.\n\nBalneário Camboriú, situated in the state of Santa Catarina, is a major tourist hotspot, drawing over a million visitors during the summer months despite its relatively small permanent population of 150,000.\n\nThe city's iconic Barra Sul waterfront, known for its stunning high-rises, will soon host the Triumph Tower, adding another landmark to its skyline. \"The future is great, and we are ready to build it,\" Graciola said according to specialist publication Construction Review, highlighting the optimism surrounding this ambitious project.\n\nThe Triumph Tower will feature 100 floors and encompass a gross floor area of approximately 1,614,586 square feet, the outlet reported he said. While official renderings of the tower have yet to be released, the scale and design of the project promise to redefine the city's architectural landscape.\n\nConstruction Review reports that the tower's completion is anticipated to not only attract more tourists but also stimulate the local economy by creating jobs and generating revenue at both local and state levels.\n\nFG Empreendimentos is no stranger to monumental projects. As the largest construction company in Santa Catarina and the eighth-largest in Brazil, its portfolio includes some of Latin America's most impressive residential buildings.\n\nThe approval of Triumph Tower comes at a time when Brazil is making significant strides in infrastructure development, Construction Review reports. A notable example is the recent signing of a 30-year franchise agreement between Brazil and China for a 912 miles high-voltage transmission line. This project, worth approximately $3.6 billion, aims to transport renewable energy from Brazil's remote northeast to its more populated central regions, per the outlet.\n\nNewsweek has reached out to the development company Select Group for a comment.\n\nThe tallest primarily residential building in the world is currently in New York. Central Park Tower stands at 1,550 feet and gained the title in 2020. The title looked set to go to Six Senses Residences Dubai Marina which started construction in May. At only 1,696 feet, however, it will have to settle for second place.\n\nMost of the top 10 tallest residential buildings are located in either New York City or Dubai."
