Fronting the new Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway, Russia Wharf has had several owners thus far, but regardless, the building is still pressing forward in construction. Russia Wharf will be a mixed use development that will house financial juggernaut Wellington Management, as well as offer approximately 200 residential condo units.

Situated next to the rather new Boston Intercontinental, Russia Wharf will be in good company, and will add to the live-work mix that is developing in the Waterfront area of the city adjacent to the Financial District. With the exclusive photos below, you get a feel for the preservation of historic building exteriors that will be part of the project slated for 2011 completion.
