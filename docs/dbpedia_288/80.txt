Boston, MA

Historic Russia Wharf (also known as Atlantic Wharf) of Boston Harbor is being converted into a 31-story high rise which will incorporate the original brick and timber structure as a part of its design. Many of the original Heart Pine timbers were selectively removed from the original building to allow for the new superstructure.
