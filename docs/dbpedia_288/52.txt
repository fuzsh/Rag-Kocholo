Situated at the intersection of Atlantic Avenue and Congress Street, three buildings — the Russia Building (designed by Peabody and Stearns), the Graphic Arts and the Tufts Buildings — served as a hub of mercantile trade. These monumental buildings, characterized by cast-iron storefronts, large shop front windows and decorative lanterns, eventually fell into a state of near-unsalvageable disrepair.

The new Atlantic Wharf has incorporated the façades and other important architectural elements of these historic buildings into a modern, thirty-one-story skyscraper, which contains offices, residential units, and retail space. With substantial setbacks, the new tower allows quality breathing room for the historic structures to read well from the street, featuring original storefronts, complete with limestone and cast iron. The historic exterior has been completely refurbished, including the repair of crumbling brick and rebuilding neglected lanterns. Nelson Court, a passageway connecting the Russia and Graphic Arts Buildings, is now a glass atrium that serves as an entryway into the skyscraper, bringing a bold vibrant new energy to the historic structures.
