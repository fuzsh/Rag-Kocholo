        "text": "Last week I graduated from USC's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism with a Master of Science in Journalism. I was recognized as one of the top scholars in my program after I received the Outstanding MS in Journalism Scholar Award. It's been a thrilling experience jumping straight into grad school after I graduated from Chapman University last year. During my one year on campus, I completed reporting projects and worked as a managing editor for USC Annenberg Media. I also contributed to Annenberg TV News and Annenberg Radio News in addition to digital stories. I traveled to cover the Iowa caucuses earlier this year, and I'm heading to Washington, DC next month to attend the CSIS Journalism Bootcamp as a fellow for the 2024 USC-CSIS program. The whole time I was also reporting for Voice of OC, covering Orange County news and politics between my classes and USC commitments. I'm excited to continue reporting for Voice of OC in post-grad life! Thank you to all my professors and mentors that I've met along the way — fight on!\n\nI truly am still in awe of this amazing news! The Panther received four awards from the Society of Professional Journalists' Mark of Excellence Awards for work published in 2022. I'm so thrilled and honored to be recognized with a first-place award for best-breaking news reporting from SPJ! And I cannot believe The Panther won best newspaper — all the work restarting our print coverage truly paid off and I am so so proud of everyone on staff (: My first-place award was for a story I wrote for The San Diego Union-Tribune, and my finalist award was for a story I wrote for Voice of OC. Juggling these internships with my classes and my work on The Panther has not been easy. It would've been so much smoother for me to walk away from The Panther and focus on my professional internships and classes as I wrap up my undergraduate career. But I'm so glad I didn't. Being editor-in-chief of The Panther was the absolute highlight of my Chapman experience, and I'm so happy I did it. I proved to myself and everyone else that I was the right person for the job and could excel in it. I still have great clips from my other experiences, and I still won awards for the stories I wrote during my internships while working 40 hours every week for The Panther and taking max credits each semester. Leaving The Panther is breaking my heart. Here is my farewell message to the newspaper: https://lnkd.in/gs7PbAgJ Thank you to everyone who encouraged me during my time at Chapman, and I'm very excited to start at USC next month!!"
