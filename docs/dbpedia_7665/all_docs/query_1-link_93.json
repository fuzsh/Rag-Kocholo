        "text": "Thanks to a tip from SWLing Post contributor, Dan Robinson, I spent some air time with an old friend last night: Radio Educación broadcasting from Mexico City on 6,185 kHz.\n\nLike a lot of small Central and South American shortwave stations, I believe XEPPM only broadcasts at 1,000 watts–though in the past, I believe they were allowed 10,000 watts. Still, their signal often makes it into eastern North America with relative ease, although it’s rare that it’s so clear. As summer approaches here in the northern hemisphere, QRN (noise from natural sources, like thunder storms) will rise on the 49 meter band. Even last night, there were some mild static crashes.\n\nI tuned in around 01:25 UTC (April 1, 2019) with the WinRadio Excalibur and heard some amazing jazz, so I had to hit the record button.\n\nFor your listening pleasure, here’s the one hour ten minute recording I made:\n\nhttps://archive.org/download/RadioEducation01April201901256.18/RadioEducation-01April2019-0125-6.18.mp3\n\nClick here to download audio.\n\nDo you enjoy the SWLing Post?\n\nPlease consider supporting us via Patreon or our Coffee Fund!\n\nYour support makes articles like this one possible.
