        "text": "–\n\n–\n\nI’ll be doing a number of book festivals in October and early November, so I thought I’d create a banner/poster/thing to display on my table. This was created by my daughter Maggie, who knows how to do these things. Then I go to Staples and they’ll print it up on poster board. Not expensive.\n\nNice, right?\n\nI already have visits lined up for Nebraska and Oklahoma, but very little in my local area (NY, NJ, CT). We start school a bit later around these parts. But now is the time to start thinking about it.\n\nPlease consider me. I have four new books out in 2024, three of them available in paperback, in addition to an extensive backlist. My work ranges from PreK to Middle School and I’m comfortable speaking to all age groups.\n\nSend a query to jamespreller@aol.com. We can email back and forth, or set up a phone conversation, or even Zoom. I find it is warmer and more effective when we can connect (and team up) to explore how best to make my visit most impactful for your particular school.\n\nThanks!\n\n–\n\nI’m happy with this new review for Shaken from the Bulletin of the Center for Children’s Books (BCCB). Here’s a snip, minus the plot outline — Kristy, a 7th grade soccer star, suffers from the effects of a serious concussion — since BCCB asks authors not to post full reviews:\n\n“Preller’s writing is rife with strong metaphors and powerfully realistic characters, making a surprisingly gripping story despite a relatively staid plot that focuses on a girl slowly learning a new way to be healthy. As Kristy works through the pressure that she’s put on herself (and the pressure coming from her parents and older teammates) to excel, she learns how to stand up for her own needs and how to identify which of her skills are good for her, like asking for help without apologies, and which aren’t, like disassociating through difficult times. When she finally returns to the soccer field, it’s alone, to do drills and test her love for the game, which feels even more triumphant than the early scenes in front of cheering fans.”\n\nAs a reminder, here’s a snippet from last week’s review from Kirkus:\n\n“Preller’s careful pacing matches the fuzziness and slow healing of Kristy’s brain, introducing readers to the realities of the pain, loss, and feelings of isolation that dedicated athletes experience when they can no longer play. The somber tone of the story is lightened by the presence of two minor characters who bring levity and humor. Strong themes of healing (both physical and emotional), family, and friendship abound. An introspective and realistic coming-of-age story about rediscovering oneself. (Fiction. 9-13)\n\nCOMING on SEPTEMBER 10th!\n\n–\n\nSo this happened:\n\n–\n\nIt’s exciting news, I’ll be participating in yet another Chappaqua Children’s Book Festival. It’s a privilege and a pleasure.\n\nBut my hair.\n\nWhat the actual . . . ?\n\nI may have complained on social media. As a profession curmudgeon, I can’t disappoint my dozens — and DOZENS — of followers.\n\nObviously, somebody hacked away on Photoshop. A bad trim. I got a tragic haircut while staying at home minding my own business.\n\nAnyway, I’m fortunate. My fabulous niece, Sara, saw this affront to my coiffure and, having skillz, fixed it.\n\nShe posted this:\n\n–\n\nThere. Now I feel so much better.\n\nI have four new (or semi-new) books in 2024:\n\nBlood Mountain in paperback:\n\nA collection of Scary Tales in paperback:\n\nA new easy-to-read story:\n\nAnd a middle-grade novel:\n\nHow’s that for range?\n\nSo, please, yes, come by and say hello. You don’t have to buy anything. I’ll be the guy wearing a hat!\n\n–\n\n–\n\n–\n\n–"
