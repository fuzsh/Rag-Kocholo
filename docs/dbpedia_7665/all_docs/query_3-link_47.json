        "text": "Alleo Health System President and Chief Executive Officer Tracy Wood joined the board of directors of the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization effective Jan. 1. Ms. Wood joins a board of executives from hospice and palliative care providers across the United States.\n\nAs chief executive of Alleo Health, Ms. Wood is responsible for upholding the not-for-profit hospice and integrated senior care service provider’s mission and values while successfully managing a changing market in a dynamic and fast-paced landscape for the hospice and palliative care industry. Alleo Health System, formerly Hospice of Chattanooga, has been present in the community for 40 years, providing compassionate local care for aging adults.\n\nIn an introductory letter, NHPCO President and CEO Edo Banach welcomed Ms. Wood’s “participation as a visionary leader” in the organization’s mission to transform end-of-life care. Founded in 1978, the NHPCO is the nation’s largest membership nonprofit organization for providers and professionals who care for individuals affected by serious and life-limiting illness.\n\n\"I’m honored to be joining an organization that serves as an advocate for the often-overlooked hospice and palliative care industry,” said Ms. Wood. “I look forward to furthering the NHPCO’s mission of mobilizing social change to expand access to end-of-life and respite care in communities nationwide.”\n\nMs. Wood joined Hospice of Chattanooga in 2016 as the not-for-profit's first female and African American CEO. She transformed the organization into the premiere senior care provider in the Southeast with the creation of the Alleo Health System parent company in 2019, said officials. Through acquisitions which integrated new clinical providers, Alleo Health now provides care for patients and families in 37 counties across Tennessee, Georgia, Alabama and North Carolina.\n\nMs. Wood holds a Bachelor of Arts in psychology from Marymount College and a Master of Public Administration with a concentration in Healthcare Administration from Grand Canyon University. She is certified as a hospice and palliative care administrator through the Hospice and Palliative Nurses Association and holds a compliance certificate for hospice and palliative care from the NHPCO.\n\nShe is an active member of the Society of Human Resource Management, where she follows trends to strengthen her company’s culture. Ms. Wood is also a member of the 2019 Trademark Women of Distinction class, a graduate of the 2018-2019 Leadership Chattanooga class, and a member of the YMCA of Chattanooga Board of Directors."
