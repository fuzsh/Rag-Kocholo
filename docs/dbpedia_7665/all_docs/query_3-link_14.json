        "text": "I'm a Senior Writer at Voice of OC, the nonprofit news agency that covers Orange County, Calif. With a population of more than three million, Orange County is larger than 20 U.S. states, including Iowa, Mississippi and Nevada, and faces all of the health and other challenges of any major political body.\n\nDuring my career, I have been a foreign correspondent in Asia, one of the few women war correspondents in Vietnam and a California investigative reporter and editor. Health reporting was and is a significant part of covering any issue, whether it was Agent Orange in Vietnam, aerial spraying of pesticides to eradicate the Mediterranean Fruit Fly in California or today's challenges to healthy living in an urban home, office or recreational environment.\n\n√Ç"
