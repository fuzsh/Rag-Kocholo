        "text": "Shaena Stabler, the owner and editor of Stu News Laguna Beach, typically updates her online newspaper twice a week and sends email blasts of approximately 30 stories per issue to subscribers.\n\nBut since COVID-19 became a threat in the United States, they’ve gone daily. Their readership has increased dramatically, as many are turning to hyper-local publications for their coronavirus news.\n\nBecause, while it’s important to read about hot spots in the nation like New York City, Detroit and Los Angeles, it’s crucial for people to know what’s going on in their own neighborhoods.\n\n“It’s heavy,” said Stabler, referring to the 35 reported cases in Laguna as of April 10, the highest per capita rate of COVID-19 cases in Orange County. “I live alone, I don’t go out at all and I’m taking this really seriously … Laguna Beach is taking this very seriously. So many people I love in this town are an elderly or older population.”\n\nThe late Stu Staffer, former owner of the Coastline News and the Laguna Beach Independent, sold to the Los Angeles Times and Firebrand Media respectively, founded Stu News in 2009. It has been 100% funded by digital ads since Stabler came on as a business partner in 2011 when she was 25. She’s been at the helm of both the editorial and business side since Staffer died in 2017.\n\nRecently, when she was speaking to local clothing designer Melissa Martinez-Booth, who owns PELT Inc. and 4societee, about making T-shirts to help Laguna Beach businesses and nonprofits, Martinez-Booth asked if Stabler would be interested in designing a T-shirt for Stu News. It would be a way that their loyal readers could support them financially.\n\nThe design is a black-and-white photo of Staffer with the words “Stu Knew.” It will soon be available on their website, and Stabler plans to donate 50% to the Laguna Beach Little League in honor of her late co-owner and mentor.\n\nAs numerous businesses have been affected by coronavirus-related closures, many print newspapers have seen their revenue, which largely comes from ads, drop dramatically.\n\nThe Southern California News Group, which operates the Orange County Register, recently furloughed its sports and arts writers for two weeks, according to the LAist.\n\nFirebrand Media CEO Steve Zepezauer, which owns several O.C. print publications, confirmed that as its ad revenue dropped 40%, the company has had to furlough almost half of his 21 employees. He’s applied for the Paycheck Protection Program loan and hopes to bring them back soon.\n\nFirebrand runs the local weeklies Laguna Beach Independent, the Newport Beach Independent and the Coastal Real Estate Guide (which serves both Laguna and Newport) that are delivered free to all 10,250 Laguna Beach households and approximately 12,000 Newport Beach homes.\n\nThe company also produces the Laguna Beach Magazine and Newport Beach Magazine, which are published several times a year, and other custom magazines for hospitality companies.\n\n“We do have a decent amount of money in receivables, but part of our problem is that people aren’t paying,” he said. “Maybe the accounting departments aren’t even open, or other people are saying, we can’t pay now but we’ll pay when it gets better.”\n\nThe Newport Beach Independent has halted printing temporarily. Most of Firebrand’s magazines that publish with less frequency have been delayed but not canceled.\n\n“We do know that our audience in our local markets are very passionate and rely on our product,” Zepezauer said. “The web traffic has been off the hook the last three weeks, we’re getting so many letters and commentaries that they’re glad we’re still publishing.”\n\nOne local business owner wrote them a $100 check to help them pay freelance writers and encouraged others to donate during this time.\n\n“I don’t want to ask for that, because everyone’s in the same boat, but if somebody does it on their own, that’s great,” Zepezauer said.\n\nHe said that there is an option for readers to support their product monetarily online, but it’s never been something they have marketed.\n\n“It’s certainly something we’ve considered and are now considering it more,” he said.\n\nCovering the ins and outs of the COVID-19 crisis can feel like a boxing match, says Norberto Santana Jr., the founding publisher of the nonprofit digital newsroom, Voice of OC, which has become known for its aggressive government reporting.\n\n“You have to stay limber, stay fresh,” he said. “If you’re behind a little bit, don’t worry about it. It’s just the first round. Stay focused, concentrate on the next two steps in front of you and keep going.”\n\nBut journalists are built for this, he said. He’s covered hurricanes, earthquakes and fires. He points out that many journalists reporting in war-torn countries have to deal with tense situations involving their basic safety and quality of life on a daily basis.\n\nVoice of OC operates with a small team of three staff reporters in addition to several fellows and interns. Not only do they not have print costs, another benefit of being a nonprofit is that they haven’t been affected by drops in advertising or commercial sponsorships. In addition to large donors and foundation grants, they’re also supported by 950 individual small donors, none of whom have yet pulled out since the coronavirus crisis began.\n\nHowever, before one of the first local government news conferences to address coronavirus, he got a phone call that his longtime Voice of OC founding partner and newsroom leader Tracy Wood had passed away from complications with cancer.\n\nShe had just finished working with a writer to publish a series on Irvine’s Great Park, published on the day she died.\n\n“I could still hear Tracy in my ear,” said Santana, after receiving the news of her death. “Saying ‘You’ve got a press conference to go to in 30 minutes on this COVID thing that’s just starting to develop.’”\n\nHe remembers being incredulous that the government was advising everyone to social distance, while simultaneously holding a news conference with reporters packed in the room together.\n\n“I remember thinking, ‘I can’t believe I’m walking into this room right now. Is it even safe?‘” he remembered. “And then hearing Tracy in my ear again. ‘You’ve got a job to do. Do your job. Get the people the information as quickly as possible.‘”\n\nStu News Newport Beach co-owner Tom Johnson, the former long-time publisher of the Daily Pilot in the 1990s and 2000s, said the challenges also provide room for growth.\n\nStu News has been able to keep its approximately 25 contributors that write for the Newport and Laguna sites, because the ad sales haven’t dropped significantly.\n\nThis is likely due to their unique website that Stabler admits may not look modern, but works for their local readers and advertisers.\n\n“We’re mimicking the feel of reading a newspaper, so you scroll down, and the idea is that everyone reads everything and gets to know the community better,” she explained. “And the ads are set up that strategically so when you’re having an emotional experience with the story, you can simultaneously have an emotional experience with the ads ... Some people have been advertising with us for eight, nine years nonstop and they don’t want to lose their premium positions on the site.”\n\nThey still hope to launch a sister site focusing on Dana Point soon.\n\nBoth Santana and Stabler know that while they haven’t lost too much revenue yet, their donors and advertisers will be affected by the struggling economy.\n\nBut while he monitors the finances, Santana said it’s also important to take care of his staff and their mental health: “A big challenge is the pacing, to make sure they rest. I even have to tell myself on Saturday and Sunday, ‘You have to take the day off.’”\n\n“It’s nonstop,” said Stabler, of balancing the editorial and business sides amid the pandemic. “But at the end of the day, the community is getting a lot out of what we do. If you’re in news, it’s go time. This is when you’re needed most. You can’t fall out right now.”\n\n“It’s not always pretty,” said Santana, “because all these officials will continue to get frustrated with us, members of the press, pushing them for information again and again and again. But if you look at the national pandemic plan, one of the number one things to keep people calm is that they have information, real-time information. And that’s why our jobs now become so central.”"
