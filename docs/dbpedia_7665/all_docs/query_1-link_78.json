        "text": "Blanca Rubio\n\nLegislator\n\nThank you, Madam Chair and Members, for allowing me to present AB 400 relating to the sunset of Design Build project authorization, which expires in 2025. The Design Build Method is an efficient and cost effective approach to delivering public works projects in which both the design and construction of a project are procured from a single entity. In the traditional design bid build procurement process, the design and contracting phases are separate processes with no direct collaboration between the entity that designs the project and the contractor that builds the project. The Design Build Method streamlines project delivery by allowing local governments to enter into a single contract with a design and construction team that is responsible for designing and building a project. This gives counties and local governments the ability to complete and deliver complex public works projects more efficiently and cost effective compared to design bid build. Current law allows most counties, cities, and other local agencies to use the design build procurement process for specified public works projects. However, due to the looming sunset date, there has been uncertainty about whether these projects would be allowed to reach completion. Extending the existing Design Build Authority sunset to January 1, 2031 will provide certainty for counties and local governments to plan, fund, complete, ongoing, and future public works projects. And I accept the Committee's amendments. And with me today to testify is Matt Randall, Placer County Public Works engineering manager. Thank you.\n\nMatt Randall\n\nPerson\n\nAll right, good morning, Committee Members. I'm Matt Randall with Placer County. I'm an engineering manager with the county. I've worked in public works for design and construction for over 25 years, the last 15 years with Placer County, and I also hold some leadership positions in the County Engineers Association, and I'm the Vice Chair of the Infrastructure and Development Committee, which we worked on this Bill. And I want to take a moment to thank the author's office and Committee staff for working with us on this Bill. Thank you very much. AB 400 is needed to extend the existing statutory authority for local governments to use design build procurement processes, and continuing to allow counties and local governments to use this design build method is critical, as the method streamlines project delivery by allowing local governments to enter into a single contract with a design and construction team that's responsible for designing and building the project. The design build method also allows counties and local governments to complete and deliver complex projects more efficiently and cost effectively versus the more traditional design build process. And I've got a couple of examples of projects and other local agencies, the projects that they've delivered in my own county, Placer County, there was the $23 million animal shelter service in Auburn, a $28 million coroner facility, and also a $90 million south placer adult correctional center as well. And we're currently working on a new health and human services building in Auburn. Other local agencies that have used this method, Los Angeles County, the $1.6 billion Harbor Medical Center, Contra Costa County, the $65 million administrative center, which includes the Board of Supervisors Chambers and Orange County, The East Garden Grove, Weisberg, Channel Project, which is a flood control project, was built with design build and then also locally here in Sacramento, the City of Sacramento constructed the $5 million navigation Center for the in house. So there's lots of examples of projects that have been used for design build to address aging infrastructure and other emerging needs. And definitely the speed and efficiency of design build is the big benefit to local governments and our taxpayers. So with that, I can answer any questions.\n\nCecilia Aguiar-Curry\n\nLegislator\n\nLooks like, due to lack of a second, the Bill dies. But I'd like to make a comment. First of all, Assembly Member, I want to thank you for bringing all your supporters up. I'm very sympathetic. I'm really sympathetic. This Bill just isn't it. And I think we could work on this again. And I would hope that Assembly Member Arambula will tighten it up or figure out a way that it works, because this isn't it. I come from a farming community. We have asthma. We all. But we cannot walk away from just thinking the state's going to solve this. The locals have to solve it. There's nothing worse than when I'm sitting in a dais and I say, can you fix something that's in LA? And I can't fix some of those things, and so I just think really goes back to local control. I'm really sympathetic. I understand you brought these people up and their heart and souls in this, and so is my heart and soul. I think everyone that's up here feels the same way. This just isn't the Bill. And so, Assembly Member, I hope that you will continue to work on this issue because I'd love to see it come back in a different format, that you work with the air quality districts, that they're on board. I, too, received quite a few phone calls to oppose this Bill, but that was the reason I opposed it. It just worries me that we have a governing group that are picked from four new state appointed members, I worry about that. So I thank you for presenting today, and I hope you will come back. You can reconsider this in the future. We have that conversation. Thank you very much. Okay. Thank you very much. We are on item file number seven. Assemblymember Garcia, AB 918.\n\nEduardo Garcia\n\nLegislator\n\nMy dyslexia kicked in. But 918 is an attempt by our local community to solve what is a systematic problem across the State of California. And that is a recent report highlighted, one in five hospitals in California are financially struggling. This Bill consolidates two existing healthcare districts by the expansion of one and ensuring that the two hospitals in rural imperial county are overseen by one healthcare district. There are tremendous benefits of consolidating and coordinating healthcare services in this region for the purpose not only of financial solvency and stability, but also to maximize the services, the resources, and improve the quality of health care for this region. Just recently in this legislative year or last year, we made an effort to solve the financial circumstances of a hospital in the Central coast communities and we took legislative action to create again, a local solution to a problem taking place there. We recognize that there are other issues that will be required to occur, for example, addressing the Medi Cal reimbursement issues. At the same time, the consideration that is underway for an assessment or a tax on the health plans and insurances, that is a conversation happening on the Senate side. A colleague of ours from the Central. Valley is addressing the issue of emergency funds for hospitals that are in the brink of closing as well. And we too have other legislation that addresses the issue of having a permanent revolving fund that could assist these hospitals up and down the State of California. So we recognize that there is a systemic problem, but AB 9118 is an attempt by our local community to solve a local issue with our own health care circumstances. So I wanted to just thank you here in the Committee for your help on this Bill. We are continuing to hold stakeholder conversations to ensure that the right approach is taken and that at the end of this legislative process, we have the best possible solution to put forward. With me as a witness is Patty. Maysent, CEO of the UC San Diego Healthcare System.\n\nPatty Maysent\n\nPerson\n\nThank you so much and good morning Committee Members. I really appreciate the time. I'm Patty Mason. I'm the Chief Executive Officer of UC San Diego Health. The University of California supports AB 918 by Assemblymember Garcia, which would create a countywide healthcare district and consolidate the three largest healthcare entities in Imperial County, El Centro Regional Medical Center, Heffron Memorial Healthcare District and Pioneers Memorial Healthcare District. I want to thank Assemblymember Garcia for his leadership and really steadfast determination to ensure that all people living and working in the imperial county have access to quality, affordable and sustainable health care. Post pandemic healthcare providers across the country are experiencing record demands for healthcare services. Labor expenses are at an all time high and the supply of critical, and there's a critical shortage of healthcare workers post pandemic, supply disruptions and increased demand nationwide for medical equipment have raised the overall costs of supplies. Reimbursement increases from the federal, state and commercial payers are not close to keeping up the pace of the higher cost of healthcare. Hospitals and communities with high percentages of MediCal and Medicare patient populations are facing severe financial pressures resulting in the elimination of important services or the complete closure of facilities, as we've seen in the Central Valley. Imperial county, with one of the state's highest Medical and Medicare populations, is currently experiencing a healthcare crisis. Historically, there has been a shortage of primary care providers, limited medical and surgical subspecialties, lengthy wait times for medical care, insufficient urgent care services, and a lack of emergency transportation. These persistent challenges, combined with the current financial climate, together pose a significant threat to the health and well being of the people who live and work in Imperial County. While healthcare providers continue to petition for higher reimbursements for MediCal and Medicare, there is something we can do now to support the Imperial Valley community. Pooling resources and coordinating and scaling clinical services between the three trusted healthcare providers in the county will increase efficiencies, remove duplicative services and increase access to healthcare. The legislative creation of a countywide healthcare district is the most effective solution to begin to address the long standing financial issues as well as the emerging financial issues in Imperial County. In the interim, UC San Diego Health is doing what we can to support by expanding the long term partnership that we have with El Centro Regional Medical center in the City of El Centro to provide the stability needed to get to a long term solution. For the past eight years, we've provided El Centro Regional Medical center with a variety of management and clinical services, including our faculty who serve in the emergency department, critical care, stroke, cancer, urology, just to name a few. On February 27 of this year, 2023, we agreed to assume day to day operational, clinical and financial management of El Central Regional Medical center, and we're not alone in this endeavor. Preston Hollow Community Capital, who is the major bondholder for El Central Regional Medical center, is continuing to provide financial and other resources to the hospital as well for operations, capital projects as well as infrastructure investments. On April twelveth, 2023, in coordination with the City of El Centro and El Centro Regional Medical Center, UC San Diego Health announced the appointment of a new CEO to oversee the day to day operations of El Centro Regional Medical Center. Veteran Hospital CEO Pablo Velez is now leading UC San Diego Health's overall efforts to support the strategic and operational plan to stabilize the hospital, as well as to support the development of the healthcare network across the county. UC San Diego Health is committed to managing El Centro Regional Medical Center for the next 12 to 18 months, stabilizing it and supporting the efforts such as Assembly Member Garcia's to reach a long term sustainable plan. Our goal is to further conversations and assist in the development of an integrated healthcare system in Imperial County. UC San Diego Health is committed to continuing conversations on a local, state and federal level with community partners and health leaders, including hospital representatives, public health experts and emergency response officials. The creation of a new countywide healthcare district is a very, very significant step to stabilizing health care in the Imperial Valley. And again, I thank you for considering AB 918, and again, a lot of gratitude to Assemblymember Garcia for leading this effort and bringing the community together. Happy to answer any questions.\n\nUnidentified Speaker\n\nPerson\n\nSure. For purpose of greater context, an effort to consolidate healthcare districts in the imperial county has been attempted twice in the last 15 years. And unfortunately, the local dynamics, the local politics of who's driving the conversation, who will be in the seat of the governance decision making process has gotten in the way. Today, the sense of urgency pushes us to move expeditiously this Bill and go through the LAFCO process as it's currently before you in this Bill to move the application forward, set some deadlines for the application to be processed gives a bit of some governance structure to the representation of the entire four corners of the county. But with the local discussions that are ongoing, there seems to be even more pressure to restructure the governance approach and the conversation of dissolving a healthcare district, and in this case two, that we allow for ample time for this one healthcare district to be stand up and ready to implement specific tasks, giving the healthcare districts that will be dissolved ample time to shut their doors, turn off the lights and make sure that they put their tent in their car and get going. The goal ultimately is to establish one healthcare district, to improve the coordination and to create a much more solvent path for both of these hospitals to survive. Today the conversation is El Central Medical Regional Center and tomorrow it will be pioneers who also is in a financial, their outlook isn't looking very promising given additional state mandated requirements and other cost implications that continue to go up, whether they be labor or just the cost of care in general. So we feel there's a sense of urgency the local community does as well. And if there's one thing that everyone in the region agrees, is that one healthcare district is one step in the right direction of improving the financial certainty for both hospitals and healthcare in general for the region.\n\nEduardo Garcia\n\nLegislator\n\nJust thank you so much. Your analysis that was put forward, there were some changes that were recommended. We are accepting those. And I just do want to share with this Committee that this conversation is ever evolving and that there could potentially be some substantive changes to the Bill and if necessary, to come back before you and explain the rationale behind those, we will be more than prepared to do that, but the goal at the end of the Bill and this effort is to create one healthcare district, to have a reflective, represented body of all four corners of this district and to focus on two primary issues, the coordination of healthcare services in this region of the state that has 180,000 people, and ultimately the financial solvency plan to make sure that these hospitals are not in the brink of closing their doors. And so those will continue to be the principles that drive this conversation, and I look forward to having further discussions with this body and the rest of our colleagues in the Legislature. So thank you, respectfully ask for your aye vote.\n\nCecilia Aguiar-Curry\n\nLegislator\n\nAssembly Member Garcia. I really appreciate you bringing this forward. As we've seen recently, a lot of articles in the New York Times elsewhere about rural hospitals closing and their struggles, and we just continue to see that, particularly in our rural communities. I commend you for working this, bringing it forward, and I really appreciate the fact that, you know, there's still a lot of more work to do and we're here to help you as we go along the way. I also want to thank you for taking the amendments, to agree to the amendments that revert the Bill back to the previous version. I know you'll continue to work with us on this really difficult issue, and the changes are inevitably going to be made as you move the Bill through the processes. So we offer you the courtesy of being able to move this forward. I would ask that in exchange that you continue to keep our Committee involved, apprised of any proposed changes so that we can support this Bill on concurrence take you. This is a hard Bill, and I don't think everybody understands. We've had a couple of these in the past, and we know there's a lot of moving parts to this. We got to work together. I hope your locals will help. And thank you for helping out, the district, and making sure that his constituents, as well as many, are taken care of. So with that, the motion is do pass as amended, to the Appropriations Committee. Secretary, please call the roll.\n\nMohammad Khan\n\nPerson\n\nGood morning everybody. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to present Assembly Bill 965 and I just want to start by thanking the Committee consultant and the chair for working closely with me and my office on this Bill. But before I continue, I would like to note that I will be accepting the Committee amendments as I remain committed to addressing outstanding issues raised by the opposition. The Committee's amendments outlines the following the complete removal of language that includes that shot clocks and deemed approved apply to non wireless fiber broadband projects. The shot clocks and deemed approved language in the Bill for batch permit processing only applies to wireless broadband projects. This is a reasonable compromise since wireless broadband permits are already subject to state and federal shot clocks. Now we're simply extending those shot clocks to the batch permits for those wireless projects. The amendments also allow local governments to limit the amount of batch permits they are willing to accept and also makes it clear that broadband applicants can work with the local jurisdictions to assist with resource issues to help process the permits. AB 965 seeks to help broadband permits to get processed more efficiently so our constituents can more quickly benefit from high speed Internet. 32 states have adopted legislation to streamline the permitting of broadband infrastructure. When a broadband project is being deployed in a community, oftentimes there are numerous locations where identical telecommunication infrastructure is being installed to provide high speed Internet. They are very simple and very similar. This bills ensures that groups of nearly identical broadband permits can be processed together. In the coming years, we're going to see a huge influx of broadband projects as a result of public and private investment. We are quickly approaching a deadline of December 2024, which is about a year, to spend $6 billion on federal broadband dollars or risk losing it. This funding will get us connected in months instead of years. One thing is clear, the status quo isn't working. It takes too long to get communities connected to high speed Internet, and we saw the consequences, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. Our kids are struggling to get connected, many of whom live in rural communities and are low income. In a recent report conducted by the Bay Area Council Economic Institute, they found that 75% of California voters support statewide streamlining of broadband projects, while 70% support requiring all local governments to follow a uniform, state mandated approval process for broadband projects. I am authoring this Bill because I know firsthand how these permits work. I used to process this as a planner for about 20 years. I work with for cities like the City of Palmbell, Desert, Hot Springs, and the City of Coachella. If this Bill was in place at the time that I was a planner, it would have decreased my workload in having to approve every single permit one by one and would have allowed me to use my time in other areas of need, such as housing entitlements. As you know, we're facing a serious housing crisis. AB 965 also strikes the right balance between efficiency and statewide broadband deployment and local control. And I want to be clear that local jurisdictions will still remain in full control. Permit fees still be received by local governments, but staff can more easily process routine high volume broadband permits as a group instead of individually. Given the public's increased reliance on high speed internet access and the importance of broadband for public safety, public health, economic growth, education, job creation, housing affordability, and emission reductions, it is in California's best interest for public and private broadband project permits to be processed as quickly and efficiently as possible while still again maintaining local control. And joining me to testify in support and answer questions is Rochelle Swanson, external first manager of Crown Castle, and Voleck Taing, Senior Vice President of government relations at the Silicon Valley Leadership Group. Thank you, Madam Chair.\n\nRochelle Swanson\n\nPerson\n\nWelcome. Thank you. Good afternoon, Madam Chair and Committee Members. Rochelle Swanson, external affairs for Crown Castle. Prior to that, I was mayor pro tem and a Council Member for eight years, and a big part of that was broadband advocacy, as well as the preceding decade to that. So I'm here the more just representing a company I really, truly believe about broadband and broadband connectivity. Crown Castle is the nation's largest shared infrastructure telecommunications company, providing, installing, operating, maintaining broadband for a variety of customers, including k through 12 school districts, local governments, universities, isps, and wireless cell phone providers, which is critical to connectivity and public safety for first responders. I'd truly like to thank the author and the chair and the Committee Members for your leadership in advancing Internet connectivity in California. This Bill is based on experience, knowledge and desire to get communities connected. Crown Castle works with local jurisdictions every day in the state and across the country to deploy broadband. AB 965 reflects the best practice of permit batching. The Bill simply requires local jurisdictions to make a decision on a group of broadband permits in a reasonable amount of time of two to three months, and it's not intended nor designed to short circuit local governments permitting authorities and their duties. There are simple decisions that are made that also allows for timely deployment. It's approving the permit, conditionally approving, extending the amount of time by mutual agreement, removing permits from the batch that do not fit into substantially similar or have one off issues, and to make health and safety determinations to not allow a permit to move forward. In additions to the state's investment of $6 billion in broadband, the private sector has been investing billions in the state. Crown Castle alone is going to be investing about 110,000,000 this year, so it's critical these decisions are made at a timely manner so that those investments can be put to order. Unfortunately, many local jurisdictions continue to process broadband permits one at a time to have the permits go through several departments with various times and unnecessary delays. We believe both public and private entities involved in broadband deployment must up our respective games to meet the challenge of the day before and not after the critical broadband funds are allocated and dispersed. We genuinely value our partnership with local jurisdictions and feel the amendments proposed by the Committee bring additional clarity to the fact that this Bill will ensure better streamlined handling of broadband permits while maintaining local control. Crown Castle remains committed to working with our partners and local government to best meet the challenges before us. Crown Castle is an enthusiastic partner in this effort and we thank you for your aye vote\n\nVoleck Taing\n\nPerson\n\nthank you Madam Chair and esteemed Committee Members. My name is Voleck Taing. My name is Valak Tang and I serve as the government relations arm for the Silicon Valley Leadership Group. We are a business Association representing hundreds of companies and institutions that work in the innovation economy. It is our pleasure to support AB 965 with our partners and the author's office. We believe it will accelerate the buildout of critical broadband infrastructure throughout California. Doing so will support the state's economy, grow jobs, and bridge the digital divide. The Covid-19 pandemic seized the migration of work, education, business, and healthcare to online platforms, those to access with high speeds and a reliable Internet transitioned quickly to the new reality of fully remote employment, online classes, or virtual doctors appointments. Sadly, many rural, low income minority communities lack the broadband architecture for sufficiently advanced Internet to keep pace with these ongoing changes. As a result, existing inequities were further exacerbated. AB 965 will increase California's ability to access and leverage online resources by implementing industry best practices that speed up the approval of digital infrastructure projects at the community level. The Bill will allow for approving substantially similar broadband permit applications, simultaneously, avoiding duplicative and redundant red tape reviews that Stymie efforts to expand Internet access. AB 965 will grow the state's economy and jobs. Broadband construction, operation, and maintenance will immediately require greater workers. In addition to that, enhanced Internet infrastructure will also increase the need for workers in digital industries. This includes cyber it data and others. Finally, the Bill offers an opportunity for California to obligate federal coronavirus, state and local fiscal recovery funds for broadband projects by next year's deadline of December 2024. The Silicon Valley Leadership Group is proud to stand in support of this Bill.\n\nCecilia Aguiar-Curry\n\nLegislator\n\nGood afternoon. Tracy Ryan, Royal County representatives of California, also on behalf of the California State Association of Counties. We do appreciate the author's work and the Committee staff's work on the Committee amendments and making this really a marketedly better Bill. However, we still do have concerns and we view this as a work in progress. There needs to be some clarification around the definitions and requirements and specifically the batching. We do appreciate that now there is a limit or at least a floor on the number of permits that can be put in through the batching process. However, 50 is a large number when you're talking about different types of batching permits of permits. Maybe 50 or more small cell permits may be straightforward. However, when you're talking about maybe 50 or more trenching permits of over 100 miles in the public right away, these are going to be a little more difficult and more challenging for the local jurisdiction to process. Additionally, the health and safety provisions that are in the Bill, I think there are some technical changes that need to be made to that language. It states that the local government can apply the general health and safety. However, it requires that the local government have a written finding of adverse public health and safety findings. So the last thing is tolling. In current law with wireless permitting, the batch process that was put in, or the deemed approved process that was put in place by AB 537 in 2021, there are tolling provisions in there that are really necessary for this to work and you need to make sure that you have complete applications. For these reasons, unfortunately, we still oppose, but have moved to an opposed unless amended. We do appreciate the movement and we look forward to working with the author as it moves forward. Thank you.\n\nPatrick Welch\n\nPerson\n\nPatrick Welch with the California Municipal Utilities Association. We represent public power utilities, both cities and special districts that provide power to 25% of the state. We also appreciate discussions with the author and the sponsor. Appreciate amendment taken today from the author, but unfortunately, we remain opposed to the Bill. Today's amendments incorporate an exemption for public power utilities, but that exemption is a qualified exemption and actually, in our view, creates potentially new layers of confusion for our members when it comes to broadband deployment and poll attachments. Public power utilities are uniquely regulated in this space and continue to feel strongly that AB 965 is not needed. In 2011, AB 1027 was enacted to require public power utilities, and only public power utilities, to make space available on their poles for use by telecommunications providers. The law already has a batching process. Public power utilities are also subject to the 2018 FCC small cell order, which imposes additional pole attachment shot clocks and cost containment mechanisms. So because of this and this new exemption of disqualifications, there's a situation where there could be a lot of confusion about an application for a poll attachment. What applies? Does AB 1027 apply? Does the FCC process apply? Does the new AB 965 process apply? There's a lot of layers that have to be sorted out. So in closing, CMA members are already highly regulated in this space, and we urge the Bill to be amended with a more precise and straightforward exemption for public power entities subject to AB 1027.\n\nLori Wilson\n\nLegislator\n\nthank you to the author. When I first read the Bill and got briefed on the Bill, I had a lot of concerns. I saw a lot of good things about it and had a lot of concerns about it. And I was so happy to see the amendments that you took. Those dealt with a lot of my major concerns and also showed a willingness on your part to get to where the happy medium is and figure out what's the best way, where you said, without getting to an efficient place, but still recognizing that there are needs at the local agencies. And I appreciate your effort on that and I look forward to seeing what the final outcome is. But we'll support it today for that reason, just because, like I said, the big things, hurdles that I was concerned about, you dealt with, and just your willingness to work with the other side has been commendable. Thank you.\n\nDiane Dixon\n\nLegislator\n\nYes. First of all, I appreciate some of your top line Assembly Member top line issues of local control and giving local governments. You come out of local governments. So you cited specifically how this Bill, if enacted, can improve the planning and approval process, and I commend that. I am supportive of it because your intention is to improve efficiency and timeliness and something that's important as broadband installations in our communities, especially our rural communities. But I guess I will echo other members comments. I just hope you can work together with the industry and other players and local governments to make sure that does influence my thought process about there's something different between a small cell permit and a trench that goes for a mile long. So however you resolve that with the local agencies, I would appreciate that before we see it again if we do, but I commend the efficiency and intent to streamline and improve the timeliness of getting this installed. So thank you."
