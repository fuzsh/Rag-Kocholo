        "text": "The transcripts on this page result from a rock climbing oral history project. For this study, researchers spoke with Joshua Tree climbers who provided a picture of the park's rock climbing from the mid-1900s into the present day. Topics include free soloing, bolting, and the development of traditional ethics in the park. Overall, the interviews highlight the historical and cultural significance of recreational rock climbing in the park.\n\nThe project's official name is the Joshua Tree National Park Historic Resource Study of Recreational Rock Climbing. This research was made possible thanks to a collaboration between the Anthropology Department of the University of California, Riverside, and the National Park Service.\n\nSandy Esque\n\nInterview Date: February 18, 2020\n\nBiographical Information: Sandy Esque first visited Joshua Tree in the 1980s working as an instructor and guide for Boojum Institute and Outward Bound. She has continued to visit the park up until the present time. She was an eyewitness to the early era of guide development in the park, gender relations evident in guiding practices of that era, and the park’s transition from a quiet secluded monument to a popular destination for many.\n\nContent Summary: Sandy describes her experience working as an instructor for Boojum Institute and Outward Bound and her visits to Joshua Tree, which is identified as the prime winter destination for climbers. She has frequented the park for many years, and can comment on the transition of Joshua Tree’s identity from a secluded natural retreat to a popular climbing destination, developments with gear and ratings, and the commercial aspect of climbing.\n\nOutward Bound\n\nBoojum Institute\n\nEcho Rock (Area)\n\nHidden Valley (Area)\n\nIndian Cove (Area)\n\nLost Horse (Area)\n\nRyan Mountain (Area)\n\nSheep Pass (Area)\n\nWonderland of Rocks (Area)\n\nDA: Hi. I'm David Asplund and I'm here with Sandy Esque on the 18th of February, 2020, and this is a short interview about Sandy's climbing experience at Joshua Tree. Thank you, Sandy, for participating in this study.\n\nSE: You're welcome.\n\nDA: When did you first visit Joshua Tree?\n\nSE: Generally, if my memory serves me well, it was in 1982, and that was not necessarily for climbing at that time, but going with a program; I worked in the outdoor education field, and I worked for Boojum Institute, and we would take kids for five days, school kids, for this outdoor experience.\n\nAnd we were in Indian Cove, more specifically, and hiked over to Hidden Valley, but one of those days during the activities was a day of rock climbing for the kids. So I had skills as a climber, but we were setting up top ropes for the kids to have a day of climbing there. That's the very first time I went to Joshua Tree.\n\nDA: And was Joshua Tree –because you had experience prior to it, because you were doing climbing elsewhere?\n\nSE: Climbing elsewhere; I went to Prescott College, which was in Arizona. Prescott, Arizona, and that's where I got introduced to rock climbing. So I did climbing there for four years, going to school there. But I hadn't gone to Joshua Tree yet. I was climbing mostly in Arizona (Granite Mountain, Oak Creek Canyon (Sedona), Cochise Stronghold, Mt Lemmon).\n\nDA: So who got you into–? Was there someone specifically that–?\n\nSE: Who got me into climbing? It was Prescott College. They had an outdoor program and it was my motivation of looking at climbing in magazines –I was a surfer before, and grew up in San Diego– and just seeing climbing pictures motivated me to then go and figure it out and then thus finding a college that taught it basically.\n\nDA: And did the kids that you brought, did they fall in love with Joshua Tree as well? Or was that a sort of one or two kids that were like, \"Yes, I really enjoyed this.\"\n\nSE: The kids were seventh grade to 10th grade, as I remember. Private school kids, because they were the only ones, of course, who could afford to go out for five days in school. It wasn't a very selective group of people or kids. That's a big question, because the dynamics of climbing; everyone loves and hates it, because it scares them but it also thrills them. And they're happy when they accomplish a goal of whatever that goal was.\n\nActually, more people have a difficulty rappelling, more typically than climbing of what I experienced and did they love Joshua Tree? Was that your question? Because then they also had to hike through it and have an experience of the outdoors. And so it seemed like working with those kids at that time, yes, they did love Joshua Tree just being out there and camping and being able to climb for a day. It was very exciting and thrilling for them.\n\nDA: But there wasn't one person that stood–\n\nSE: Stood out in my mind? No.\n\nDA: But then you also got your daughter to start climbing as well, correct? So did she also climb very early or is that something that happened later?\n\nSE: Well, she doesn't really climb now. My husband and I took her when she was... five or six. And I don't think we did a very good job, we were trying to find a very simple climb for her to do, but more typically what happens again, no matter who they are, is you're trying to find a climb that they can get up and not struggle with. So they have a more positive experience but she was still scared. We got her up the climb, but then we had to rappel her down; she couldn't walk off the cliff. And that was our mistake, because rappelling is more scary for people than the climbing because they're backing off the cliff. So she's not per say a climber. From that experience.\n\nDA: But she has climbed.\n\nSE: She has. But she’s going out now to be with her boyfriend and friends.\n\nDA: The whole gang was out.\n\nSE: The whole gang was out. She loves being outdoors, and she loved Joshua Tree, whether she climbs or not.\n\nDA: OK. That's really good. Because you mentioned your husband and you brought her to climb. But have you had any other like climbing partners?\n\nSE: Oh, yes. Yes. Yes. I first went to Joshua Tree to work for Boojum, and then I moved to Colorado, and I started working for Outward Bound, Colorado Outward Bound School.\n\nBut that I was in their climbing and mountaineering program and met other instructors who climbed. And we would go to Joshua Tree for our break in the spring, in the fall, or more specifically, the fall. The very first time I went to “climb” for pleasure at Joshua tree was in the spring of 1984. It was a national monument then, it wasn't a park. And that was a big difference of what's today, being a national monument.\n\nDA: How do you see it different?\n\nSE: It was free. You could stay there as long as you wanted. So we would drive there and camp. I think they did have a sign saying that you're allowed only 14 days to stay at a campsite, which we could always find campsites. Not true today. So you drove in there, plopped yourself down and lived there. And if you wanted to stay more than two weeks, that just meant you moved to another campsite. So it's wonderful because 'specially in the fall or even spring, compared to today, but it was virtually pretty empty. There were a lot of climbers, per say, doing what we did, but there were a lot of drive-through people. But there weren't a lot of campers like there are today. If that makes sense. They were more family, one-day kind of drive-through is what I remember.\n\nDA: But you may have visited the park for climbing, or would you go for other reasons?\n\nSE: No. It was strictly climbing.\n\nDA: Strictly climbing.\n\nSE: Yeah, I wouldn't just hike. Now I do.\n\nDA: Well, you mentioned one of the places that you went to when you brought the kids.\n\nSE: Yes. Indian Cove.\n\nDA: Indian Cove. But is that the place that you would revisit now or no?\n\nSE: Visit now or when we were climbing, we’d be in Hidden Valley.\n\nDA: I want to ask both, but let's start with when you go now and you visit Joshua Tree; is that at the same place that you go to?\n\nSE: If I was really going, I mean, I've been following my daughter, but if I am a free will, I'd be going to Hidden Valley.\n\nDA: Why is that?\n\nSE: I just love it there. There is more climbing that's there, and you have Echo Rock, Ryan Mountain, Sheep Pass, Wonderland of Rocks, Lost Horse, etc. It has numerous nice campsites.\n\nDA: OK. Yeah, but those are the two places that –the one that you would visit now because of the memories and one of them with the kids, but when you were the most active as a climber, those were the same two places that you would visit or–?\n\nSE: No, it would only be Hidden Valley. Is where we would gravitate to.\n\nDA: Is there a specific route that you would take that is...\n\nSE: No, there's so many different routes.\n\nDA: You couldn't pick out like a favorite or you tend to gravitate whenever you visit.\n\nSE: Back in the day, no, because it was how much –for a climber, or at least for us, yes, there are certain routes. I don't know if I can even remember the name, quite honestly, of all of the various climbs without looking at a book again. But you're going for what your ability is with a route. So for example, if you climb or what I was climbing 5.9, 5.10, then you're looking at what are those climbs that are going to support your ability.\n\nDA: OK. So is the way that you climb now then is different from when you were very active in the climbing–?\n\nSE: You're saying now as today?\n\nDA: Yes.\n\nSE: Yes, very different. I don't really climb like I used to. When you met me in Joshua Tree and I was setting up top ropes. And that's just a situation where I don't even have to climb at all. I can go around and drop ropes down and have the systems in place for people to climb. Opposed to in a day when I was a climber, you wouldn't have a top rope; you'd be the one leading up from the ground. And so that takes a skill that I don't do anymore. Generally speaking, I haven’t for a while.\n\nDA: OK. Sorry, I'm jumping back and forth between... yeah. I wanted to ask them because when you when you were active climber and you said that Joshua Tree was a place that you would revisit, but from the college that you got inspired to do climbing, I'm guessing, and please correct me if I'm wrong, but there were also other parks and also outdoor climbing spots that you ordered. So what were some of the, I guess, other climbing spots that you would visit?\n\nSE: Yosemite.\n\nDA: Yosemite?\n\nSE: Of course. For any climber, one goes to Yosemite, Rocky Mountain National Park, Eldorado Springs. Again, those are in Colorado. And Joshua Tree. Those were kind of the bulk. And Joshua Tree was a jewel, especially for people in Colorado. It's very enjoyable climbing and very easy camping other than bringing your water in. And like I was saying, back in that day in the 80s, it was quiet and you could always find a route that wasn't crowded back in the day.\n\nJoshua Tree is warm. So seasonally, it's like we’d be skiing in the winter, and then as the snow gets bad, you're thinking about going somewhere else. And that's where you want to go. It's Joshua Tree, where it's warming up. So it was heaven sent. I went on my honeymoon there. So there you go.\n\nDA: So you were born in Colorado.\n\nSE: I was born in San Diego.\n\nDA: In San Diego. And then you moved to Colorado?\n\nSE: Yes.\n\nDA: OK. When was that?\n\nSE: 1985, officially. I think.\n\nDA: And then you moved to California when?\n\nSE: 2000.\n\nDA: 2000. OK. But do you go back sometimes and visit your old, like, areas. Do you ever go back to Colorado, to San Diego and visit or–\n\nSE: Sure.\n\nDA: Yeah, OK. I was just wondering if there are like places that you would just revisit old friends that were still in the climbing community, or you might just visit family and friends because it's fun to visit family and friends.\n\nSE: Both. Yeah. The majority of people that I climbed with in my twenties and thirties, like again... there is maybe one person I can think of who still climbs readily. And my husband and I, Andy and I, again, our lives have gone different ways and we're doing different sports but the only reason we're going back to Joshua Tree is one, we love it there. And two, now that Lela and her friends are interested in climbing so we want to share it with them.\n\nDA: Yeah. Well that must be a pretty special place; I'm thinking if you have your honeymoon at Joshua Tree, it must be more than just your every, like your everyday place that you go and visit.\n\nSE: It was a perfect place back in the time.\n\nDA: Did you have any other like celebratory, like reasons to visit or any like special moments that happened in the park?\n\nSE: No, it was all motivation for climbing. Of why we would be returning. And then through that experiences, then you have the emotion based on the activity that you're doing. So it's kind of a yes or no answer, but try to get clear on it. I mean, I'm so happy now going back to Joshua Tree because it brings up all the memories and all the successes in that sense of that particular sport of climbing. To relive it or rethink it.\n\nThe only difficulty I have at Joshua Tree, like so many of our situations of getting older and the outdoors is that it's hard to go back as it's so crowded. It's hard to go back. You can't even get camping. You can't just be like we were. It's like, \"OK, it's October. Let's go to Joshua Tree.\" Now you have to look –you guys, your generation has to Google and hit it and see if there's camping. Can't be as sporadic as we were. It seems like. So that's unfortunate for your generation and the outdoors. I'm happy it's still there, at least.\n\nDA: Right. And is that is there a specific sort of –because you were talking about how it has changed in terms of, like, just it's more crowded now or it's more dense than what it used to be. But are there other major changes that you've seen in the past that you feel like–?\n\nSE: I don't know about major, but it's more crowded, as we said. But it's not because of climbers is what I noticed is that, you know, again, it's just people wanting to get out and about and being in the outdoors. And that wasn't like that in the 80s, like I said. I mean, there were always campers and families and having a good time, but there were more climbers camping when it was a monument.\n\nAnd you would look around in Hidden Valley in these regions and you would see people climbing, traditionally climbing with ropes. And I see less of that now. It is happening still, but there's a lot less. And I see more people walking out in the desert with their crash pads bouldering, which we'd never saw before. And I know that's kind of a new, relatively new thing compared to how it was in the 80s or 90s.\n\nBut I don't see traditional climbers as much as I did in the past. So that's what's changed. So it's good for the traditional climber coming now because those routes are gonna be open to them. They don't have to wait in line as much. Unless I just didn't hit it at a busy time, I don't know. My husband and I visited Joshua Tree for the last five years on either our road bikes or motorcycles and blaze through the park. And looking at it is what I'm basing that on. More than my climbing.\n\nDA: Was there a specific season that–\n\nSE: In the fall, typically.\n\nDA: In the fall?\n\nSE: Yeah.\n\nDA: Is there reason why fall is just –it's just the best?\n\nSE: Fall is generally best for the outdoors, cause the weather is pretty stable and it's not cold yet, and it's not rainy, and it's not hot.\n\nDA: It's not hot. Right.\n\nSE: At least for Joshua Tree.\n\nDA: Well, I was going to ask, because when it comes to the weather conditions, I'm assuming that plays a major role in your climbing. But in terms of the gear and the equipment, does that change as well a lot based on the season, or has it changed, I guess from when you started climbing?\n\nSE: Climbing has gone through a huge evolution of change with gear.\n\nDA: How so?\n\nSE: Changes evolved in the type of protection used when setting up anchors and lead climbing. From pitons to hex’s and stoppers to camming devices (TCU’s, friends). The gear is now more user-friendly. It is lighter, easier to place, and safer.\n\nDA: Which is very important.\n\nSE: Yeah.\n\nDA: So even though the equipment itself has changed, has the education for climbers, like climbers become smarter? If that's the right word to use. But does the knowledge of climbers increase as the equipment increase or do you think they might think less of how they climb because the equipment's safety has increased?\n\nSE: Are they thinking more or less when they're climbing, is what you're asking. Because of the gear being easier to place? I think it's probably –well, again, this is just me. I think that it has made it –I mean, it's a huge, tremendous relief to not worry about your gear and your safety, relatively speaking. That yes, then the climber can only have more time to think about their ability and their surroundings. So it's been advantageous for that, if that's what you're asking.\n\nDA: Yeah, a little bit. Because I was thinking when you were teaching, for example, kids how to climb. I'm sure you had things that you thought were more important than others. And I'm guessing safety being the number one priority. And so the way that you were teaching climbing, if that may have changed how people are being taught climbing now if they are just starting off.\n\nSE: That's a hard question. And yes, that's a simple answer, yes.\n\nDA: But then how? And so forth, I'm guessing is a more... is a bigger question where we would include a lot of other people that might be teaching as well. Who was that person when you were teaching or if you were to bring someone out to Joshua Tree for any climb, what are some of the basic things you would tell a rookie climber to think about?\n\nSE: I would think that, one thing we wouldn't talk about the gear. OK. And because that wasn't important for the climber. So we as instructors, we would set up a climb and just talk about the knots. I mean, the only gear that the students really had to focus on was the knot that they were tying into their harness. And that's why it's safe and why, you know. So that's the only thing that we wanted them to notice, because they weren't placing gear and that wasn't the part of it. We wanted them to focus on the experience of climbing. I'm rambling. What was your question again?\n\nDA: I was just wondering if when you are taking someone to climb for the very first time, what would you be–?\n\nSE: We would just be telling them tips on how to climb. What to be looking for, what you do with your body and how to strategize how you get up. You know, again, it's like a puzzle and you're telling somebody, \"OK, well, you got to have at least three points to contact, whether that's your two feet or your hands or you're trying to –don't move, unless you plan your moves. And put your hand in here and turn it,” and just kind of just pointers.\n\nDA: And [inaudible] climbing. So it's almost like learning, when they're doing it.\n\nSE: Yes, absolutely.\n\nDA: You tell them on the ground that if they forget that, it's their fault.\n\nSE: Well, but you're there with them and they're not that far away; they could just be, you know, they could be climbing up to that ceiling there, right. Or usually you're taking a place where it's very controllable, so you can be with them and helping them either from the top or the bottom and giving them pointers if they're having a hard time. That's why it's so dynamic, I think it's –and we did this at Outward Bound, of course. We took students climbing in the mountains and set up top ropes or took them up peaks or whatever.\n\nAnd it's so impactful. It's such a wonderful experience because people are generally scared or excited. You have a whole range of abilities and emotion. And to achieve that, to have a goal of getting up from A to B and then helping somebody with that. It's just so it's so worthwhile for everyone involved. You know, it's a wonderful situation. So it was nice to have Joshua Tree there. And when I went back the other week and my daughter and setting up top ropes, we were working around the Boy Scouts or whatever group it was, you know. So that's still being incorporated in the park. Of a commercial venture out there. Which is nice to see. Not as a climber, because you want that climb, but anyway.\n\nSN: To work around the group.\n\nDA: So when you were doing this with the college, and learning and climbing with them, did you have someone similar to what you're doing for your daughter to sort of guide you? And then who was teaching you the ins and outs?\n\nSE: You want their name?\n\nDA: Well, if you want to share. But if there was like a person or a few, that you remember like, \"Yeah, when I was climbing with them...\"\n\nSE: When I was learning how to climb and set up all the systems at Prescott College, Mike Goff and David Lovejoy were the instructors. And then when I worked for Boojum and Outward Bound, I got exposed to many other instructors’ methods and skills. The pluses and minuses of their techniques. Through the years my own style and skill level developed and changed. Like any teaching experience.\n\nDA: Yeah. So in the beginning it was kind of just mimic the stuff.\n\nSE: That's the best way to say it. Absolutely.\n\nDA: Do you see a lot of climbing techniques that you're doing that now your daughter or your husband are doing? Or do you feel like it's sort of a mutual adaptation or maybe you and your husband, since you seem to climb more together, do you catch yourself replacing your own style by using some of his techniques and vice versa?\n\nSE: Well, like with any sport, you share what works for you. And if you can do it or not, then yeah, sure. And so it's you're watching each other, or you're talking about it or... and that's another thing with climbing, which again, I don't know if you're of interest picking this all apart, but that's to me is what's so dynamic, is when you have a partner, when there's two people climbing, somebody is leading, somebody's belaying and you're both experiencing that particular climb, whether you're leading or following them. But it's dynamic and you're both going through it together.\n\nSE: And it's important, especially the belayer is holding, if that person falls and they place their gear accurately and you've got them. I mean, it is so dynamic emotionally to have that experience with people. So it tends to build very good relationships between –or if it doesn't, you don't have them as a partner. So you keep your partnership with that person and you form a close relationship with them.\n\nDA: So was it you or your husband that started climbing first and then got the other one to–?\n\nSE: No, no. We both coincidentally just met at Outward Bound and had that sport.\n\nDA: OK. Because I'm thinking that it must be difficult to pick a climbing partner and pick someone that you have that connection with. And I'm guessing when you pick someone, is it just chemistry when you talk to someone or do you say, \"OK, let's go on a small climb? But if I'm jumping that way and you catch me, I know you're the real deal.\" Or how do you pick a climbing partner?\n\nSE: Everyone's different. I would think. But I guess if I could speak in a general sense, first you're looking for if you can trust them. Because they have your life as they're belaying you, or whatever or the \"what ifs\" of what happens. So you're seeing what level of ability they have. Or I would be. And then how hard you climb; if you're a good match with the ability of climbing and that is really easy to assess because all the climbs being in Joshua Tree, an established climbing area like that, they have guidebooks, all the routes have been done mostly. And so, you know, the range of ability. And so you throw yourself on the 5.9 or 5.14 and you see how well each of you is climbing. So it's pretty much a done deal of figuring that out pretty easily.\n\nDA: So you don't have to go in blind and just guess. Who looks the nicest?\n\nSE: Yeah, you either get better or you don't. And then how they're placing gear and then how they're working with the system. So it's pretty easy to assess people and find your partners that you guys mirror each other and feel confident, and then sure, personalities and having a good time and all that other stuff.\n\nDA: Right. But that's less important when it comes to safety.\n\nSE: I would hope so.\n\nDA: They know how to joke–\n\nSE: Are guys chasing girls just for the sake of –you know what I mean.\n\nDA: It's very cool. Thank you so much. And I think that that will sort of be... I'm glad that you're sharing them. I'm guessing that's why I'm thanking you. Because sharing, I guess, personal things, especially when it comes to this sort of bond, but then having that bond, then broken because, you know, people move and people might not work out. That must be an emotional thing or emotional turmoil, especially if you climb with someone for so long. Did you have any like that sort of intimate climbing partners before?\n\nSE: Well, my husband.\n\nDA: Before, I was gonna say, before your husband.\n\nSE: Sure. And that's what forms that dynamic. It was women initially, when I think back of a few women through my experience that you go again. I mean we went to the Tetons and then climbed anyway. It's a huge world out there of where you want to climb. But yes, it's so dynamic that it forms such a more heartfelt relationship when you share those kind of experiences with people. It doesn't have to be climbing. You could be traveling. It could be anything that's adventurous or... and I don't want to say adventurous because we could have it in a car sitting with somebody and sharing your life with them. But anyway, you're having an experience, an intense experience with them. And for me, it was the outdoors and adventuring. And then you form better relations –or, form more intimate relationships going through that. So I'm so happy that (this is my pitch for national parks and all) so happy America has wild space that even at 60, I can still go out in the natural world and have those kind of experiences.\n\nI had experienced a comparison of an outdoor experience I had in Europe, in the Dolomites in Italy, and doing the Via Ferrata versus, you know, going to the Tetons in America. While I appreciated being in the Dolomites and experience Europe and their outdoors, it felt more like Disneyland to me. I followed the dots. It wasn't a wilderness. And I'm so appreciative that this country is trying to save what wild country we have still, because it's a night/day emotional experience. If that makes sense. At least it was for me.\n\nDA: All right. Thank you so much, Sandy.\n\nSE: You're welcome.\n\nDA: I very much appreciate it. And there anything else you would like to say while it's on the record?\n\nSN: I do have a couple of questions. Because you did mention, Sandy, that I know your previous partners were women and the time that you were climbing the 80s, 90s, what was it like to be a woman climber? Were you aware of that being that you were a minority in any way? Did it really not factor in significantly, or did it?\n\nSE: I was primarily in the eighties. Climbing was a very interesting sport compared to surfing. I surfed before I climbed, and that I felt a minority and more isolated and more judged. Climbing is somewhat a little different because, for example, while, yes, there weren't as many women climbing out there, compared to today, there were still magazines. Rock and Ice was one, and you'd open it up and you would see women climbing. Never saw that surfing. Very rarely. Or if anything, or surf movies where the girls are on the beach, you know, half naked or whatever in bikinis. So in the climbing world, I knew I was a minority, but it seemed more opened and accepting. And then in Prescott College and Outward Bound, there were women like me that had the same interests, so I never felt I was alone.\n\nSN: And you said you were leading climbs?\n\nSE: Yes.\n\nSN: And you were setting anchors and replacing gear?\n\nSE: Yes.\n\nSN: So you were basically always doing the same things that your male counterpart would do.\n\nSE: And like with any sport you may be good at, you might be the best at it with one group or you might not be. It just depends on the circles [inaudible] and the gender as much as just your ability.\n\nSN: And did you have a specialization, like were you a good face climber, were you good at overhangs, or did you have any particular skills that you felt that you had a particular–?\n\nSE: Probably face climbing. As they say, women tend to be better face climbers.\n\nSN: So was Joshua Tree, if you compared the rock to other places that you climbed, did Joshua Tree have anything special to offer for you?\n\nSE: Face climbing.\n\nSN: What was it about? Can you describe the rock at Joshua Tree?\n\nSE: Well, it's quartz monzonite if I'm remembering correctly. And so it's not like Yosemite where it's very smooth granite, as it's –you guys probably know if you've been out there, it's pretty rough. But that's an advantage to climbing because then especially in the face climbing, there's a lot of stuff going on on that cliff. There's a lot of edges and holds and smearing techniques that you can learn to how you can get up. So that's the beauty of Joshua Tree and the type of rock that's there. They have pretty dynamic, or I felt, face climbing. And then the crack climbs, actually are beautiful, too. But I think the face climbs and the very thin crack climbs are what it's known for. So that's why all their bolts are there.\n\nSN: Right. There were certain skills that you could acquire and work on there that you could then transfer to other places.\n\nSE: Sure.\n\nSN: And in Yosemite, can you tell us what were some of the climbs that you did in Yosemite?\n\nSE: Tapping my sixty-year-old brain and having a concussion. My memory is not very good, but OK. Let me think for a minute –there was a lot of climbs on the Apron, but I don't remember their names…\n\nSN: On the Glacier Point Apron?\n\nSE: Yeah, and east buttress of El Cap. Boy, and what is that one over by the Ahwahnee which is no longer–\n\nSN: Washington Column? Royal Arches?\n\nSE: Yes. And that one, that whole face over there. I can't tell you the name anymore. And Cathedral Buttes, but I have to get a guidebook.\n\nSN: That's fine. Just wanted to get a sense of what kind of climbs you were working on there so we can relate it back to Joshua Tree.\n\nSE: So I was not one of –so I was a mediocre climber back in the day. And that would mean that... I mean, climbing has gotten real extreme, right? I mean, 5.14, 5.15. And back in my day in the 80s, 5.11 was considered, or even 5.12 was like… like what 5.15 is now. And so I was mediocre climber in that I would go as far as 5.10. But more [inaudible] really kinda 5.9. So that compared to the Lynn Hills of the day or the real substantial climbers are just you know, \"Means you're recreational.\"\n\nSN: Well, I think you have to give yourself some credit too for the ethics of the kind of climbing that you did. I mean, you weren't rappelling from the top to start the climb. You know, you were working from the ground up, right? So now that makes a big difference of what can be accomplished?\n\nSE: Absolutely. But I'm appreciative of those bolts. [Laughs]\n\nInstead of being the one having to place the bolts. And is Joshua Tree keeping their bolts?\n\nSN: Yes and no. I mean, there is a program now for bolt replacement, but it's a kind of permitting process that they have to do climb by climb. So the park rangers aren't actually the people to be replacing the bolts, at least not most of the time. Most of the time there are climbers that will come back in and apply for permits and then they'll go through a review process. Right. And then they'll go ahead and clean the climb and reset it or not, as they decide.\n\nSE: Yeah, back in the 80s, they didn't care. Right? I mean, people were chopping or replacing them. When they felt like it was needed and not going through the bureaucracy of…\n\nSN: Yeah. I think your comments have been really helpful that way, just to get a sense of the freedom of that time and the sort of spontaneity that people could enjoy there.\n\nSE: Yes. And you know, it makes me think of, I worked in Canyonlands National Park with Outward Bound and we did little bit of climbing there, or we were canyoneering. And it makes me think, the only thing that the Park Service wanted us to do, which made complete sense at that time, is that we'd be scrambling, we'd be going over these sandstone passes, I guess you could call it, and our students would be roped up, going down, for example. And so we place an anchor around a boulder or whatnot.\n\nBut the Park Service said (and I wonder if Joshua Trees sort of similar in some situations) but they said it wasn't a climbing place. And they said, \"You can't leave those anchors there. Yeah. You can temporarily put those webbing around the boulders, but somebody is going to have to go down without a rope. So you guys figure that out, you know?\" But that's I mean, I'm happy that the national park did that. That required us to pick up our pieces, basically, and not leave the anchors there. Sure, it puts that instructor in sort of a little risk, but we wouldn't do it unless we could do it. But still, you know.\n\nSN: That is the tension, isn't it? Yeah. Between how do you really support the recreational use and how do you leave the park and natural resources for others to enjoy?\n\nSE: Exactly.\n\nSN: How do you balance that–?\n\nSE: I know. And that's the same, as you know, in Joshua Tree or climbing there using the chalk. I don't know if that's a big issue still for the parks or not. And how they regulate or not or encourage people not to use chalk. Yeah, which you need to do. Or you don't need to do it. But that was a big deal in Joshua Tree, to have chalk.\n\nSN: Definitely.\n\nSE: Yeah. So I'm happy that Joshua Tree hasn't –it seems like on the surface, Joshua Tree National Park hasn't kept climbers at bay. It's nice that it seems like it's trying to be reasonable in allowing people to march out with their crash pads and boulder, but I hope that the kids today are conscious of the impact that they're having on the desert environment. I hope they are, but does anyone –I don't know. I just don't know. Were we in 1980 concerned about the desert tortoises? No, we didn't think about it, but now there's more of us. So that matters just that much more.\n\nSN: That's another something that your comments have brought out; how much visitor usage has increased and the issues that that raises.\n\nSE: Oh, it's huge, don't you think?\n\nSN: Absolutely.\n\nSE: And under-staffed and... right.\n\nSN: That's very interesting to me, too, to learn that you were doing the kind of work you were as early as you were.\n\nSE: Right. That Joshua Tree allowed it too.\n\nSN: Was your group from Prescott one of the first –were you among the first people to be taking people out to the park? I mean, 1980s, going back a ways. Or were there lots of other groups that have been doing it for a while?\n\nSE: I have no idea. I don't think so, because it wasn't our concern that we would run across a commercial group in our spot. 1982 is when I was with Boojum... this is not related to Prescott College, but anyway, that's officially when I worked commercially in the park. I think the park is now managing that commercial use and how that gets all coordinated. Between 1995 to 2000, I managed Colorado Outward Bound School semester program, a three month program where we would take the students in different environments. And one of the environments for three weeks was to go to Joshua Tree to have a climbing experience. I was required to get the permits for Joshua Tree, which was easy to do back then, as well as the camp site. I can't imagine how it is now. I guess one has to be really good at the phone waiting for that magic button to hit for the group campsites, compared to how it was back then.\n\nSN: Were you –just one last question– were you relying on guidebooks at all when you were taking–?\n\nSE: Yeah.\n\nSN: OK. So there were guidebooks that were identifying which climbs at Hidden Valley that would be the most appropriate.\n\nSE: Absolutely. And they've all been developed to harder climbs. You know, I was just out there, what the heck, two weeks ago or something with my daughter and Marvin and his brother. And we still have our old 1980s guidebook, right? Climbing guide, compared to what's out there now. But it doesn't matter, rock doesn't change too much.\n\nSN: No.\n\nDA: All right. Good. All right. Well, thank you so very much.\n\nSE: My pleasure. And glad I could help.\n\nDA: Yeah, we're very happy. We're signing out.\n\nDavid Evans\n\nInterview Date: June 30, 2020\n\nBiographical Information: Dave Evans has been climbing in Joshua Tree for over 45 years and was a part of the early Joshua Tree climbing scene cultured by the Stonemasters. Dave’s impressive climbing repertoire includes over 170 recorded first ascents in the park. His experience allows him to describe various climbs that are significant to the climbing culture of Joshua Tree as well as local climbers who left their mark on the sport.\n\nContent Summary: Dave shares stories of the early Joshua Tree climbing scene in the 1970s as the Stonemasters began to take climbing to the next level, both with impressive personal accomplishments and a budding climbing community. Due to his considerable time spent in the park, Dave is also able to comment on the development of routes in Joshua Tree since the 1970s, specifying certain areas and routes that were remarkable, the introduction of controversial ethics, and contrasting elements between Joshua Tree and Yosemite National Park.\n\nFree soloing\n\nJohn Bachar\n\nRandy Vogel\n\nScott Cosgrove\n\nStonemasters\n\nTraditional ethics\n\nWolfgang Güllich\n\nYosemite National Park\n\nHidden Valley Campground (Area)\n\nThe Wonderland (Area)\n\nDogleg (5.8)\n\nDouble Cross (5.7)\n\nFigures On a Landscape (5.10)\n\nGunsmoke (V3)\n\nLeft Ski Track (5.11)\n\nMike’s Books (5.6)\n\nMore Monkey Than Funky (5.11)\n\nThe Cutting Edge (5.13)\n\nX Rated T*** (5.9)\n\nSN: So are you hearing “This is a recording?” I'm seeing “recording”. I'm hoping that's happening. Yup. Emilio?\n\nET: Yes.\n\nSN: OK. All right, let me get this one going. This is just my backup. OK. All right. So we're on. So, again, welcome, everybody. This is Sally Ness from the University of California, Riverside, Department of Anthropology. And I'm here today, June 30th at approximately 1:00 p.m., recording on Zoom with my assistant Emilio Triguero, and National Park Service Ranger Bernadette Reagan, and our interview guest today, David Evans. So thank you so much, David, for agreeing to participate in this study.\n\nDE: You’re welcome.\n\nSN: And again, just to reiterate that I have gone over the informed consent process with you and that you are agreeing to participate voluntarily, both to be audio and video recorded. All right.\n\nDE: It's voluntary.\n\nSN: [Laughs] Thank you. OK, terrific. So let me jump right in. And I know you've had a chance to look at this schedule of questions that I tend to use as a kind of guide through the process. So I'm going to start right out with the life history information and ask you a little bit to talk a little bit about your own personal history as a climber; how you got started and when you got started. And if you'd be willing to give us your date of birth and your place of birth and tell us a little bit about how you came to Joshua Tree and to California; that’d be great too.\n\nDE: Well, I'm David Evans. Born September 6th, 1957 in Santa Monica. I started climbing because my father was a climber, an outdoorsman, and had me climbing probably by… somewhere around five years old. So it's been a lifetime activity for me. I don't—occupational history?\n\nSN: Oh, actually, no, I want to hear a little bit more about your experiences with your father. So he was your first climbing partner, and was he the person who taught you how to set anchors and use protection, and I assume you were doing traditional climbing with him in the 50s?\n\nDE: Yeah, it was. There was nothing but traditional climbing back then. He and his best friend were sort of climbers; they weren't hardcore rock climbers like we are, but they were guys who climbed peaks and did mountaineering and did a little bit of rock climbing so that they could use those skills on mountains and stuff or technical mountain climbing. So yeah, through my youth, elementary school, I would go to Stoney Point with him, and we would boulder and they would set up top ropes. And I think about the time I was 10 years old, we did a route at Tahquitz, it was my first multi-pitch climb.\n\nBR: What was the name of that route?\n\nDE: The route’s called Angel’s Fright, and we just climbed it about two weeks ago again. So yeah, I continued to make plans with my father to do stuff; we had planned to do Whitney and all these other things, but he died in a climbing accident when I was about 12, in junior high.\n\nSN: Oh wow. I’m so sorry.\n\nDE: So, that was kind of a setback. So yeah, in the following years, I climbed a few times with his friends; they’d take me out to Stoney Point. I went to the Sierras with one of his other friends and climbed some peaks.\n\nBut it wasn’t until I was about 14, I started getting interested in the Sierra Club and I started looking at their Sierra Peaks schedule of peaks to climb. Got super excited, started writing letters to the trip leaders to see if they’d take a 14 year old along. [Laughs] And they—well, they all said, “Yes”, actually; my mother would write her own letter explaining that I wasn’t overly gregarious or anything, I wouldn't talk their ear off on the drive and I wouldn’t be super annoying and all that. I could cook for myself.\n\nSo I started doing Sierra Peaks with the Sierra Club. And they have a program called the BMTC, which is the Basic Mountaineering Training Course, and we went through that so that we could get certified to do the harder peaks on the outings. And one of their trips was to Joshua Tree, that was the technical rock climbing aspect. Actually there were two; one day it was technical rock climbing, the other day was map reading, map and compass. So I think that was probably—I had actually climbed here one time before that, but that was kind of the start for Josh, but it was probably the same year, actually, my aunt drove my cousin and I out here, turned us loose one day, and climbed all day one day, we climbed Mike’s Books. It's the first climb I ever did out here.\n\nAnd it was probably…. let’s see… 1972 or something? Something like that. I don't know. And then once I got my driver's license, that was it. You know you're a climber, you're hooked. You just start going every frickin’ moment, every hour, every holiday, every weekend. And that led up to where we are now.\n\nSN: So that very first time when your aunt drove you out to Joshua Tree, it already for you had a reputation as a place you wanted to visit?\n\nDE: Yeah, you know, the guidebook—the first guidebook—was out already, the John Wolfe, the first John Wolfe guidebook. Think that was the only one out at that point in the early 70s. So we had the book, and we're already reading every page and trying to figure out what we might be able to get up when we finally got out there.\n\nSN: And what kind of equipment were you using at that point?\n\nDE: Oh, we had a super rudimentary rack of Hexentrics that were made by this British company, Clog. And they were very primitive, but they worked.\n\nOr even after that, Chouinard came out with his Hexentrics that were the best, they had the perfect spread of sizes and all that. And we got those as well soon after, but the Clog nuts were like... they weren't much better than the machine nuts picked up off the railroad tracks, really. Which is what the British guys did back in the day.\n\nSN: Yeah, so when you say “we”, was this a group of people that were members of the Sierra Club with you? And that's how you met them or—?\n\nDE: At that point, it was just my cousin Ken and I, and this other—actually was just the two of us. We're obsessed with climbing at that point and we had no way to get there, and we would go into my aunt's attic. It was an unfinished giant room, and we'd practice aid climbing around the ceiling. We’d climb up in the ceiling and climb around and set up belays and rappel down to the floor. A 10-foot rappel to the floor. And then jumar back up to the hanging belay. That was fun for us. [Laughs]\n\nSN: You know, if you were to say that about yourself and you had been born 20 years ago, you'd probably have a lot of company in terms of that, but at that time, did you see yourselves as unusual in this, you know, in pursuing this interest or not?\n\nDE: I was already hooked. I mean, there were two other guys in my high school who climbed; they were older, who I eventually hooked up with, but… yeah man, I knew, when I was ten, my dad's best friend gave me an issue of Ascent magazine (1968) for my birthday. He knew that's what I wanted. He knew I was obsessed about climbing. That was the best possible gift he could have given me for inspiration.\n\nSN: So would you tell us a little bit more about your father's history, how he got involved with climbing and what he did? Because it sounds like that was a real, you know, important start for you.\n\nDE: Yeah. Yeah, he came from a quasi-Mormon family, so we had a lot of vacations to Utah and stuff. But as a boy, he was a Boy Scout. My grandparents encouraged that. So he went through all that Boy Scout stuff and eventually started doing it on his own when he was old enough. He was a PhD mathematician who worked on (reluctantly worked on) missile guidance systems in the 60s. He was a computer programmer back in the day when there weren't very many. He was a pacifist and did not like working for the military, but that was where the good, you know, high level, [inaudible] work was.\n\nSN: So is that what brought him to Southern California? Did he work for TRW or some company here or—?\n\nDE: Yeah, he grew up out here too; my grandparents lived in LA., they grew up in LA. —or, he grew up in LA. Yeah, he worked for a number of companies, Aeronutronics, Planning Research Corporation and… McDonnell Douglass, of course, aerospace.\n\nSN: And so did you follow in his footsteps, in a sense with your occupational history, or—?\n\nDE: I did not have his math aptitude. [Laughs] I was pretty bad at math and because I was a climber, I never had career aspirations for anything other than climbing. So, unlike most people, they're working towards being “successful”, I was working towards being poor as a climber. And that's where I am now.\n\nSN: You've achieved your goals. All right, well, tell us about your career in climbing, then. What have been the, for you, the high points along the way, just to kind of give us, you know, an overview. We'll get into more detail on a bit, but just kind of give us the overview.\n\nDE: Well, you know, early on, I wanted to climb everywhere, you know, I wanted to climb Yosemite, Alaska, Europe, etc. and when I went to Yosemite, I set an early goal. I wanted to climb a route on every formation in Yosemite. I never quite realized that, but I came pretty close.\n\nBut, you know, as a beginner, you aspire to get better. You find yourself climbing 5.9, you wanna climb 5.10. You know, some people train for it, other people just climb all the time, and that's what I did. I never really trained, but I bouldered and I climbed.\n\nAnd you know, your goals always change. If you're climbing at a certain level, you're looking at all the classic routes at that range. Whatever the range is. And in my case, I was more interested in the big stuff like El Cap and all the mountains; I wanted to climb mountains. So I was always trying to climb multi-pitch stuff and longer climbs and be fast and be good, and super efficient and safe. And it's kind of the direction I went in most of my… I can't use that word “career”, that's not....\n\nCould you start it again here? [Laughs]\n\nSN: So it sounds like in that we can call it maybe your practice, your lifetime practice as a climber that Joshua Tree played a certain role in relation to these—what you're talking about—like these major climbing projects that you were your top priority. So can you say a little bit about for you in your own personal history as a climber, what did Joshua Tree mean to you at different points along the way?\n\nDE: Well. It's hard to say what it meant to me at the beginning. Was it the venue for climbing? But of course, it's one of those beautiful places in the world, so it's like the more time you spend here, you know, the more it attaches to you, so…\n\nA lot of my friends in the early days didn't really consider Joshua Tree that serious of a climbing area because nothing’s that big, but that was kind of the one thing that occurred during the 70s and 80s was how the rest of the world started to see Joshua Tree as a real climbing area, as a world class place with goals for people at every level.\n\nAnd for me, it's always… it's where my heart is, really. I mean, this place just means… it means way more than the climbing; the climbing is secondary at this point.\n\nSN: OK. Let me make sure…. I'm sensing we might have a technical difficulty here, David, can you still hear me?\n\nDE: Yes.\n\nSN: OK, good. Because you were kind of fading out. So I wasn't sure if that was the equipment or not, but it sounds like we're still good. Well, you've given us the perfect segue way there into talking a little bit about Joshua Tree in and of itself and what kind of a place it is.\n\nAnd so I'd like to ask you—and how it's changed over the years, of course, which is one of our major interests in the study. So can you say a little bit about what it was like for you and who you climbed with in your earliest—in what you might describe as the earliest phase—of your relationship with the park? What kinds of routes you were climbing so to give us a sense of what it was like to come out here in the 70s.\n\nDE: Yeah, like I said, I started with my cousin and Jim Angione. But as soon as we started coming out here, you know, you start meeting all the other climbers and there weren’t very many back then. But there were fewer and it was easier to get to know people. You see people all the time. So early on, I met these folks who’ve become known as the Stonemasters.\n\nMy cousin and I were walking by a climb called the Dogleg and we saw these guys climbing it. And we started watching and they invited us to climb it with them. And so I did, and it turned out it was these guys, it was Richard Harrison and Rick Accomazzo. I don't think John Long was there, but those two guys. And so it was like we were, you know, we were beginners. We were the noobs and practically at the get-go we met the guys who were the best climbers in the world at the time and were super friendly and encouraging. And so they just kind of swept us up in their energy.\n\nWithin a couple years, that was my posse. Really, it was those people. The other up-and-comers like us; Mike and Mari and Randy Vogel and Spencer Lennard and Matt Cox. I knew the people from Orange County and we gradually got to know other people from Los Angeles who were going to Josh.\n\nEventually the people from San Diego, who were kind of on another continent back then; it felt like it was in Mexico or something. I didn't know any San Diego climbers, but I eventually got to know them all too.\n\nSN: There's really a local scene in that regard, very specific to Orange County and in Los Angeles.\n\nDE: It was. You know, we drive out—we always camped at Hidden Valley, and you could always get in because there were no car limits back then; you could put six cars at a site. And so we could always fit in somewhere. And it was just the most amazing social scene, we’d go climbing in groups, we’d go bouldering at night together. Twenty people. We'd sit around a campfire, drinking and smoking and yelling and cussing and all that. Bragging, lots of bragging.\n\nAnd the scene was so cool back then and we would… and it was super localized. Each campsite would have kind of a regional group. And there were times when we'd be in Hidden Valley, walk around, “campfire hop” on a Saturday night. And we'd go to ten different campfires and we’d know somebody at every fire. It was just super social fun.\n\nYeah, and it was about that time when the rest of the world started taking note of Josh. Some of the famous people from around the world started showing up. Like Wolfgang Güllich showed up; he was one of the early visitors and he was, at the time, one of the best climbers in the world. He put up the route called Action Directe, and it's 5.14 or something back in the early 80s.\n\nSE: Early 80s, okay.\n\nDE: So he came to Josh. But how we ended up meeting him; it was he and Mike and Mari and Roy McClanahan and I went over and climbed More Monkey Than Funky, that was the roof thing. And that for me that was like such a memorable day because he was one of the most famous climber's in the world, and he was over here because he was interested in checking out our place.\n\nSN: Uh-huh. [Understanding]\n\nDE: And that was kind of the beginning. You know, [inaudible] the French posse showed up. We had a funny incident with them. At one point, we were climbing around Hidden Valley and somebody noticed there were French guys trying to free the Asteroid Crack. And that they were using rosin. And that's one of the things the French guys, back then, they would rub rosin on their shoes like you know that you put on a violin bow?\n\nSN: Yeah.\n\nDE: And it makes the shoe rubber stickier. But it leaves a residue on the rock. It's slippery unless you have rosin on your shoes. So it screws up the rock for everybody else except the people who are using rosin. So we went over to give them s*** because that was unacceptable. And plus, they were hangdogging, which was before sport climbing, before you’d just hang there and work a move for days, where you would lower down and try from the ground or whatever.\n\nSo they had multiple violations going on. So we went over and started harassing them. And it was good natured, it was fun and everything, but there was a seriousness to it. And the thing was, they wanted to buy pot and we had pot, so we were telling them, “Yeah, if you guys give us your rosin, you give us all the rosin you have, we'll sell you pot. So if you stop using the rosin right this minute.” And they refused. They wouldn't give up the rosin. but I think we ended up giving them pot anyway.\n\nSN: So they just continued to climb or did that ever get stopped?\n\nDE: No, I mean, the rosin thing did—thankfully, that didn't take off. I think it was pretty short lived, even in France, maybe. I don’t know the history on that, but it didn't take off here. And the other French people didn't do it. So it was not an issue, really.\n\nSN: I'm so sorry, but I can—I don't know if you can hear my dog, but I think she's interfering with the recording, so I'm going to have to take a really quick break and deal with that. I'll be back in 10 seconds, I hope. Sorry.\n\nET: Dogs, you know?\n\nBR: Do you have some?\n\nET: Yeah, I have three. So I'm, like, praying that the mailman doesn't come right now, and, like, screw up the entire operation we have going here because I know I have to go out there and, like, physically calm them down, but we'll be all right.\n\nSN: Sorry about that. Yeah. So I told Emilio I had a feeling we're going to be getting some bumps in the road with this recording today. But hopefully she'll quiet down now. So yes, thank you so much. That really gives us the good flavor of what the scene was like in the earliest experiences that you have. Yeah, yeah.\n\nDE: I wanted to mention Hidetaka Suzuki, too. He was one of the first non-Americans who came over here and stayed for a long time. And he became an ex-patriot. He was one of the best climbers of the day. And he ended up staying at Josh for months and months, every winter, and he would stay at Todd Gordon's house for the most part and just, you know, camp out there and everything. He was projecting some of the hardest climbs out here at the time, one of which was called Stingray.\n\nAnd it's horrendously overhanging fingertip crack. Like 5.13 or something like that. He was working that thing and there was another American guy, friend of mine, Mike Paul, who is also working at the same time. And I think at some point, Mike resorted to using pitons to try and widen up the fingertip locks a little bit, because that's something they did in Yosemite back in the day, inadvertently and on purpose to make it free-climbable. And that was kind of a big controversy, especially when Hidetaka got the thing before Mike did. Got the first ascent and did it cleanly.\n\nSN: So it was sort of cloud over that achievement because—\n\nDE: Just on Mike's side, because Hidetaka was perfect style, but he went everywhere in the United States. He did all the hardest climbs of the day. Everywhere, every area. He loved Josh. He spent more time in Josh than probably anywhere.\n\nSN: Uh-huh. [Understanding] Is he still alive, do you know, or is he—?\n\nDE:I have no idea. I asked somebody recently and I think they said he retired from climbing and was doing something completely different now. I have no idea though.\n\nDE: And the actual date—I'm sorry [inaudible] —the actual date of that incident; you said it was in the 70s?\n\nDE: I think most of the… not sure what the date was on that. I think. Let me check here. Here it is. 5.13D... 1988. OK. So that was a bit later in the 80s. Yeah.\n\nSN: I notice that you're referring to your journal.\n\nDE: Oh, that actually, I was doing Mountain Project there but I do keep journals.\n\nSN: I was going to ask you about that aspect of your climbing practice; when did you start keeping journals? Was it when you were really young or did you start that later?\n\nDE: In 1973.\n\nBR: What, were you 15-ish in ‘73?\n\nDE: What’s that?\n\nBR: Were you 15ish?\n\nDE: Yes. And there's Angel’s Fright, right there on the first page. October 1973.\n\nSN: Do you remember what your motivation was at that point, or was that something that most of your friends were doing who were climbing too?\n\nDE: I wanted to do it because that was the route that my dad took me up when I was 10 years old. Right. So I wanted to repeat it, you know, as on my own.\n\nSN: Did your dad keep a journal?\n\nDE: No.\n\nSN: Yeah, I was just curious, because I know that, you know, not all climbers do that, and it sounds like you've been really consistent with that practice.\n\nDE: Yeah, I had some periods where I wasn't diligent, but it's pretty it's pretty accurate overall.\n\nSN: What kinds of things did you want to record?\n\nDE: Mostly just the total number of routes. I wanted to keep what—actually, I'm a data guy; I like keeping track of numbers, everything. [inaudible] The records of all the climbs; I wanna be able to go back and see where I was on a certain date, here or whatever. But I don't know. I'm a mountain biker and I use Strava all the time. So I love data. That's it. I get home, and I went to see the numbers, whatever it might be.\n\nSN: So what do you think the numbers show from your data, from your journals about Joshua Tree?\n\nDE: Well, I climb more routes here than anywhere else, that's for sure. By a long shot, I think.\n\nSN: Have you documented your first ascents?\n\nDE: Oh yeah, especially that, yeah. Yeah. Ratings, dates, names, who was there, and sometimes other details, but usually just the date, and the ratings, the name, if we came up with the name—\n\nSN: Uh-uh. [In understanding] I wonder if you'd be willing to compile a list of those for the project. Would that be possible or is it too big a list?\n\nDE: It wouldn't be that hard. I mean, I just did a total list of all the routes I’ve done in my entire life it’s fewer than 600 routes.\n\nBR: In Josh?\n\nDE: In Joshua Tree.\n\nSN: Yeah, that would be great. We're trying to develop a timeline with important dates on it. And so one of the things we'd like to get a little bit more accurate on than has been documented thus far in climbing guidebooks and various things is, you know, what routes were developed at what point in time. And so that information would be really helpful. Just to give us a sense of where you were doing the first ascents in the park, at what point in time, what your progression was. We've learned a bit about Hidden Valley being the earliest spot, so it sounds like when you're talking about these early memories of camping and so on, that you are probably focused on Hidden Valley climbs or were you going further afield then already?\n\nDE: No, from the get go, we were heading into the Wonderland. Yeah, I mean Hidden Valley is this big [indicates with his hands], Joshua Tree’s this big [much bigger hand spread]. There were no trails, there were no footprints. Literally no footprints. When we hiked out to the Superdome, we were the only people there. If you saw somebody out there that was really weird, that would be unusual. And then after that, you know, we started heading up Queen Mountain because it just kind of ranging further afield, and always looking for the best rock, the best features. Beautiful rocks.\n\nSN: And I take it that getting lost wasn't much of a concern given the visibility, right?\n\nDE: No, I have a very good sense of direction so…\n\nSN: [Laughs] So the terrain, the ascent has a very different—the approach or whatever—has a very different character than, say, a place like Yosemite or places in Europe, right. But it was still part of the experience; is that the case?\n\nDE: For us, the experience was more about the adventure and the wilderness aspect. And you know, climbing is important, but it was never just climbing. Like for me, it was always bit more about the adventure and seeing something new, doing something new, going somewhere new.\n\nSN: And I take it with this exploration, you are still doing trad climbing, right? Because there were no bolts at this point.\n\nDE: No, there were bolts, but there—\n\nSN: Oh there were! OK.\n\nDE: Yeah. Trad-bolted face routes which are run out and, you know, little tiny quarter inch [inaudible] inch bolts, which seemed safe at the time. Now we know they're not that great. But no, there are tons of face routes, and that was kind of—there were a million crack routes left in those days, too, so we basically… it was wide open, so we could go anywhere—we were guaranteed we could go in any direction and find something really great and have a great day.\n\nSN: It sounds like paradise.\n\nDE: And no crowds, so...\n\nSN: Yeah. So do you have any particularly memorable experiences from that period of out in the Wonderland area?\n\nDE: Yeah. I mean, I only have a few routes, maybe, in Josh, that would be considered historically significant or anything, but…\n\nBR: Only a few?\n\nDE: Well, one for sure. And that's Figures On a Landscape. That was something we found in the early days, we put that in—finished it in 1978. And the whole story behind that thing is pretty funny because Randy Vogel and Craig Fry and Spencer Lennard started it. And they only got one bolt in on the first day and then we came back; Randy and Craig and I came back later. And Randy placed one more bolt, and then I placed the next two, the third and fourth bolts on the pitch.\n\nAnd Craig belayed, but Craig never even touched the rock. And this was late in the season. So we made plans, you know, we basically said, “Okay, we're going have to wait till after the summer to finish this thing.” So in the next fall, here's Randy and I chomping at the bits to climb this thing and Craig's gone off to college—but it’s Santa Barbara so he could show up.\n\nAnd we were telling him, “ You know, we need to climb this thing.” He said, “Oh, just wait for me. Wait for me.” Finally, we did it. We just went and did it. Finished the route. And it's turned out to be probably the most iconic climb at Joshua Tree. I dare say that.\n\nAnd so twenty, thirty years later, it's funny because Craig is super, super bitter about basically accused us of stealing the route and all this stuff. He's been one of my best friends my whole life. And we got in this big thing on SuperTopo on a thread, and it just got absurd.\n\nSN: I'm sorry, what was that? What was it on?\n\nDE: Figures On a Landscape.\n\nSN: No, but I mean, you said it got on a thread.\n\nDE: SuperTopo was the—\n\nSN: Oh, SuperTopo. OK, sorry.\n\nDE: Website that's kind of defunct now. Like it was basically the climbing website, for years.\n\nSN: Yeah, I remember it.\n\nDE: But that was kind of funny. And then just this guy, an author, saw that thread and decided he was going to write an article about it. And he did, he interviewed all four of us in the article for Ascent magazine. It's a beautiful article and I loved it. But it did not exonerate Craig. Much to his grim.\n\nBR: Was it the article that was in Alpinist?\n\nDE: Oh, Alpinist, not Ascent, yeah. What was that? I can’t remember the author's name.\n\nBR: I don’t remember the name.\n\nSN: I'm sorry, did we get that, Emilio? It was Alpinist.\n\nET: Yeah, Alpinist and I got SuperTopo too.\n\nSN: Yeah, good. So I want to follow up on something you said about Figures On a Landscape. You called it the most iconic climb in the park, arguably. So can you describe for us, what is it about that climb? What are the things that it has in it that would make it that?\n\nDE: Well, it's proud, it's steep, it's bold. The rock color is freakin’ amazing; it's all red and brown and black. It's some of the best rock at Josh. And basically, it was just about the limits of how steep a climb you could put up traditionally, which means, you know, you climb up and you have to stand there and let go, take the drill out and the hammer and start drilling a hole.\n\nSo if it's too steep, you're just going to fall over backwards. There's no way you can do it. But if it's low angle, then it's easy; you’re just like this. But if it’s close to vertical, it's super hard to drill. But it can't be done. And that, I'd say, pushes the limits of the angle of rock that it's actually possible to place a bolt on. I got up there and I'm like, “I can't let go.”\n\nI was like, “Randy, what am I gonna do, I can't drill, I can't drill!” And he’s like, “Try and grip the edge and hold the drill with one hand and then…” he goes. If you can start drilling right by the hole, you know, once you get the hole an eighth of an inch deep, it gives you enough support. You can kind of bear up, bear down on it while you're drilling so that you won't fall over backwards.\n\nBut it’s that initial like, quarter inch where you could just, you know, [makes whooshing sound]. But that's not what makes it iconic. I don't know, what makes something iconic? It's—an icon of something that's symbolic of something else or something bigger, right. I don't know. I don't know how things become iconic.\n\nSN: I was asking because we've talked in some other interviews about something called “The Josh Factor”. And I don't think what you're saying is quite the same, actually, as what that term has been sometimes used to mean.\n\nDE: What’s that?\n\nSN: The Josh factor; we've learned it's kind of like describing how the long run-outs at Joshua Tree create these sort of unnerving scenarios for younger climbers. So there's a sort of mental challenge sort of embodied in a lot of the Joshua Tree climbs for people who maybe trained in the gyms, who are coming with a lot of ability, but not with the experience of taking that kind of risk. And that the Josh factor sometimes refers to that, to that risk, that extra risk. But that doesn't sound like what you're talking about, actually.\n\nDE: Well, that route has the Josh factor, that’s for sure.\n\nSN: [Laughs] Oh it does! Alright.\n\nDE: The hardest move; you're about 10 feet from the bolt if you take a big fall; I've taken the fall the last time I did the climb. No, the time before that, I was leading it and I pitched off. And it's like a 30 footer, you just— [makes whooshing noise to simulate falling]. But I got it on my second try.\n\nSN: You know, this is another case where you've mentioned climbing a climb multiple times. You know, you mentioned Angel's Fright; what it's like to do that over the years and how many times you climbed Figures On a Landscape, an estimate?\n\nDE: Four times. But, you know, I've always made a habit of not repeating things. You know, it's not adventurous to repeat things. You already know the whole story. So that's one thing I'm proud about is that I have very little repeating. And that's why I've done so much, because we've always gone to different things. I mean, I know guys who've made a career of climbing five routes and getting them wired and then they just take their friends there every time and show them how easy it is.\n\nSN: What would you say about the group that you were climbing with initially back in the 70s, that they shared that interest in going on to new things?\n\nDE: Yeah, I mean, yeah, even John Long told me one time after I did a slide show, he said, “Dave I had no idea you’ve been to so many places.” And I said, “Yeah, what do you think we've been doing?” And he’s all, “I didn't do that enough.” He said, “I tended to do the same things, you know, comfort zone type things.” But that's coming from somebody who was one of the best climbers in the world, did the first one day ascent of El Cap, you know, it's B.S. He was doing the wildest stuff too.\n\nSN: Well, if we kind of look again at the 70s and the routes that were—were there other routes at that time that you'd say were iconic at Joshua Tree, aside from Figures On a Landscape?\n\nDE: That's kind of when they were all being done; the ones that are famous today kind of came from that period and after that. Even, you know, the Desert Rats, the guys that preceded us, John Wolfe posse, some of their routes were iconic.\n\nI'd say the Dogleg’s iconic. It's like the perfect hand crag. You know, stuff like that.\n\nSN: Thank you. That's a climb that has been mentioned many times in our interviews so far.\n\nDE: Double Cross. Double Cross!\n\nBR: Double Cross?\n\nDE: Yeah, that could be one of the most iconic climbs of Josh. It could even be the most.\n\nSN: Can I just get you to say a little bit more about Dogleg? What makes it iconic? You mentioned a few things.\n\nDE: Oh, I don't know, probably Double Cross would have been a better example, but just in the sense that it's like front and center. You drive into the Hidden Valley, there's always people on it. It's right there. It's a perfect hand crack. It’s…\n\nSN: Those are the elements that matter.\n\nDE: The rock’s great, yeah.\n\nSN: Yeah, that's really helpful. We're trying to, like, get a really clear understanding of what makes the routes at Joshua Tree distinctive. So it's great you can focus in on specific ones for us and talk a little bit more about those features in detail. So that's very helpful. I was going to ask you something else about those slipping my mind... oh, ethics! So, in this period, it sounds like obviously everything you did was a ground up traditional ethics, correct?\n\nDE: Always.\n\nSN: For the record, he's nodding his head very strongly.\n\nET: Yes, I’ll note that.\n\nDE: [Laughs] Up to a certain point. Now I’ve slowed down, I’m a total sport climber now.\n\nSN: [Laughs] Up to a certain point, but at this point, I mean, you were talking about these conflicts with rosin. So there were kind of conflicts during that period. But this was still an era for you that was about ground up ethics.\n\nDE: Yeah. Up until the early 80s, everybody was a trad climber and then sport climbing started to become popular in Europe and spread to the US. A lot of us resisted it because it was not ground up, it was top down and that violates the basic rule in our area. You walk up to a mountain and you climb it and you don't helicopter to the top, you know.\n\nSo that, you know, that started to become more and more popular, to take over and everybody was upset. We were so much better than them because we had ethics. They were just—they had already sold out. They didn't care about doing it the “right” way. And, you know, we thought that forever. And Joshua Tree and Yosemite were the last holdouts of the trad tradition.\n\nSN: Really? The last holdouts?\n\nDE: Yeah, absolutely, I would say, and that was, you know, largely because of the Stonemasters and John Bachar more than anybody. And that was how everybody climbed at that point. And all of a sudden, these people were just like thumping us because they weren't following the rules..\n\nSo the whole period of the 80s and into the 90s were the ethic wars. That's what climbing—that's what everybody was talking about. Everybody's angry. People were fighting, literally, you know, fist fighting over things. It was nasty, it was really nasty for a while, but we had the higher moral ground. So we were OK. But and then, you know, eventually in the, I guess in the early 90s, sport climbing was pretty well established. Even the rest of us started doing it.\n\nSN: It's a very complicated period for Joshua Tree, isn't it? I mean, I'm sure that that conflict was everywhere in the world of climbing.\n\nDE: Yeah.\n\nSN: Do you think it played itself out in a particularly contested way at Joshua Tree or not?\n\nDE: Yeah. Because we were the last, you know, we were the last ones. The rest of the world had already sold out. You know, we dragged it out to the bitter end. But even when I started, I started climbing at this place called Margaritaville with Charles Cole in the late 80s or so, and he'd already decided that sport climbing was the way to go. He was a staunch traditionalist, too. But then he started climbing at Margaritaville and it really suited sport climbing because you couldn’t ground up a lot of stuff. So he just started rap bolting left and right, and I started climbing there with him. And I let him do all the dirty work. I didn't do any rap bolting. I would just belay, and then I would climb the thing. He did all the dirty work for a few years, I could tell people, “Nope, I’m still clinging to—” [Laughs] I knew I wasn’t. And then, you know, then I went full hog and now I’m rap bolting all the time.\n\nSN: That's kind of an interesting contrast that you just bring up that at sites where there perhaps wasn't any traditional history. And so there wasn't the practice established, like there was at Joshua Tree, to come in with the rap built approach didn't carry the same meaning; was just an unclimbable site that became climbable.\n\nDE: Right. But, you know, that’s the flip side of the same coin, is that, yeah, we couldn’t do those. We couldn’t climb there before. Sorry, I lost my train of thought.\n\nSN: Well I just think, at Joshua Tree, I mean, you already had invested so much time, so much energy, so many memories in the traditional style that to convert—even though it wasn't a question, if I’m understanding you correctly, it wasn't a question of you not being able to rap bolt, you all had the ability to do it, correct? It wasn't like you had to acquire new techniques, really. So it was a choice.\n\nDE: It was easier.\n\nSN: Yeah, yeah. So it seems like that you had already invested so much in maintaining the traditional style that it was much harder to just at that point just say, “Oh, I'll just give up on everything I've done for the last how many years,” right?\n\nDE: I remember I was at one of the outdoor retail trade shows working for Five Ten at the time, I was going out to the truck to get something and I ran it to John Bachar sitting on the loading dock at the convention center. He’s smoking a cigarette. He's all, “So Dave,” I’m like, “Hey, John.” He’s like, “You're still ground up, right?” And I’m all, “Yes, John, I am.” But it was soon enough when I converted and I went to the dark side.\n\nSN: That's a fabulous story. Can you tell me what year that happened?\n\nDE: Let’s see, it was… hard to say. I could probably pinpoint it if I thought about it. Can’t remember if it was Reno or Salt Lake City that they had—they moved the outdoor retail trade show a number of times. But the early days, it was Reno. Then it went to Salt Lake.\n\nSN: OK. Maybe we'll find it in one of your books. Who knows? You brought up John Bachar a couple of times, who obviously would be somebody very high on our interview list if he were still alive today. But since he's not, is there anything you can tell us about him as a climber and his climbing practice in Joshua Tree?\n\nDE: Well, Bachar was an inspiration to everybody. When he came on the scene in the valley, the hardcore guys were already working out like maniacs all the time. Thousands of pull ups and sit ups and were just getting stronger doing whatever. But he kind of took it to a new level where they started doing the campus ladder and stuff, you know, free-hanging with your body, just dangling and working on one-arm pull ups and assisted one-arm pull ups and stuff like that. So from a training aspect, he really, you know, took it up a notch.\n\nIt kind of amped everybody up on training, but at the same time, it was his ethical approach that was really amazing. He had so much control, so much mental control that, you know, you could see him climbing un-roped and he was you know, he was completely solid. If he hadn't been completely solid, he wouldn't have been there. But he had the mental game right. And he was so strong.\n\nAnd ethically, there was nobody better, you know, if he got scared, he would just down-climb or if he couldn't get a rope, if he was working something really hard, and he didn't get it, he would lower to the ground and start from the ground again and go from the ground every time. He would not just hang there and keep trying that one move over and over like everybody does now.\n\nSN: Are there any particular formations or areas of the park that you think are particularly memorable with regard to his climbing practice?\n\nDE: Gunsmoke, the bouldering traverse. He basically.... I don't know who found that originally, but that was part of his daily routine. He would do the Gunsmoke 50 times or whatever. I can picture him soloing around Hidden Valley. Left Ski Track, which is something I would never free solo; he would do that every day. It's like 5.11A or so. It was easy, you know, it was totally easy for him. But he was inspirational and he was also a musician.\n\nHe took up the saxophone in those early days and tortured everybody for years. He’d go off into the forest and just, you know, make horrible sounds. But eventually he got really good, got really good. And he ended up realizing the dream of playing with Maceo Parker, who was one of the most famous sax players. Was James Brown's sax player for years. So he was not just a climber.\n\nSN: We've also heard quite a bit about Scott Cosgrove, someone else who is no longer with us to be an interviewee. Did you have any interactions with Scott Cosgrove?\n\nDE: Yeah, I knew Scott pretty well, he was a great guy. I remember the first day I ran into him, we were climbing over… at that place [laughs]. And anyways, he came up and there was this 5.10C route and the crux had a really loose hold, and you had to use the hold. And I did it with a rope and stuff earlier in the day, and we were climbing and then he came up and he started to free solo the thing.\n\nAnd I didn’t know who he was, you know, I’m like, “Hey, watch out for that loose hold up there!” And he’s all, “Oh. Oh okay.” But he was totally solid, and I got to know him after that.\n\nBut yeah, he ended up being one of the best in Josh… as far as hard climbs go, he put up several of the hardest climbs in Josh that become ultra-famous, like The Cutting Edge on Headstone and those routes on Cyclops. I think those are….\n\nAnd later, a few years ago, I put on a benefit for our friends out there, the Gordon family. Their house was leaking, it was a really rainy year. They couldn't afford a new roof. So we decided to throw a big party and raise a bunch of money and put a new roof on their house. So we get that, and I started this whole thing where I was taking donations of money and climbing gear, selling stuff, you know, getting new stuff from manufacturers and selling that and we raised all this money. But, Scott, early in the thing, you know, if anybody donated one hundred bucks, I thought that was a pretty big—\n\n[Alarm goes off on phone]\n\nBR: An emergency?\n\nSN: Yeah, some kind of emergency warning. Don’t know what it is. No fire outside, so I'm not gonna worry about it.\n\nDE: Good. Good.\n\nSN: Sorry about that.\n\nDE: But you know, anybody who donated one hundred dollars, I thought that was huge. But Scott gave me five hundred dollars. And then, two months later, he gave me another five hundred dollars for them. He turned out to be the single biggest cash contributor to the whole thing. A few years later, he had his gnarly accident and almost died, then he did die. And we had a mutual friend who was his physical therapist after his accident for a long time.\n\nSN: So his ethics were ground up or was he a rap bolter or what was his—?\n\nDE: No, I think he was rap bolting that stuff. Pretty sure Scott went to the rap bolting early. But I don't know for sure.\n\nSN: OK. He didn't have a strong reputation as a leader in that regard or anything like that.\n\nDE: I don't know. He kind of came out of nowhere for me. I didn't know him at that time. And then all of a sudden, there he was, he was already a pretty famous guy.\n\nSN: Did this conflict that you're describing between the traditionalists and the people who were moving on to rap bolting or top down style, were there acknowledged sort of leaders of these factions or was it just sort of a free-for-all, chaotic, “I do this, you do that”—?\n\nDE: Oh no, every region had leaders. In the beginning of the sport climbing wars, there was certain areas where they jumped on it right away and up in the Pacific Northwest—that's Smith Rock and stuff; Alan Watts and Todd Skinner, and some of those guys, really great climbers, they jumped on the sport climbing thing right away. And they kind of showed the Stonemasters that that was a really good way to get better.\n\nAnd, you know, Todd Skinner was a very vocal, high profile climber. He did slideshows. He was a professional. One of the first professional climbers.And he made money with slide shows and endorsements, mostly slide shows. Back then, that was kind of the only venue for making money as a climber. Other than guiding. So if those two guys emerged in the Northwest, you know, every region had people pop out like that, you know, in our area it was Bachar and us.\n\nSN: And in terms of sort of on the other side, were there other—I mean, you and Bachar were traditionalists, I assume, so were there any—\n\nDE: Those guys were sport climbers, Todd Skinner.\n\nSN: Who?\n\nDE: Todd Skinner and Alan Watts.\n\nSN: And he was down in Joshua Tree? He was climbing down in Josh?\n\nDE: Yeah, they would come down here, you know, sport climbing here. And people would always harass each other in a good natured way. We had this thing we used to call them “mobile harassment units”, the MHU, and it didn't matter what people were doing or who it was. You just go somewhere and start hassling people like, “Hey, you might not make it. Maybe I should lead that for you.” You know, like just anything to get under somebody's skin, especially if it was somebody who you knew. You could really bug ‘em. It's so much fun.\n\nSN: So was this an actual vehicle, the mobile harass-\n\nDE: No, it was just loose groupings of people who were annoying other people.\n\nSN: And most of the time, it was all in good fun?\n\nDE: Yeah, but sometimes it wasn't. Like I said, there was lots of bad vibes and lots of nastiness through that period as well, so.\n\nSN: Well, let me ask you this, we haven't talked about this at all, but, you know, this is not the only period where there was behavior that might be considered sort of transgressive from the standpoint of the law or the park management, right. Fist fights or something like that. But also earlier selling pot, obviously, it was illegal. So what was the relationship between the climbers and the Park Service during these different periods?\n\nDE: In the 70s, we had a couple of super Nazi rangers that were really aggressively anti-climber.\n\nSN: In Joshua Tree?\n\nDE: Yeah. Jan Dick and Jim Boone. Jim Boone was a climber initially and then got hired as a ranger and went total fascist.\n\nSN: Went rogue?\n\nDE: [Laughs] Yeah. But yeah, we battled those guys, you know, they were always trying to bust us for doing something.\n\nSN: So they were really a presence, an active presence in your experience?\n\nDE: Yeah. Oh yeah. At night, you know, they tried to sneak up on the campfire and catch somebody with a bong in their hand or something. Or a minor drinking beer, you know, anything, anything they that could get.\n\nSN: And how much of an impact did they have on your experience?\n\nDE: Not very much. It was easy to get away from them. You know, it was just a matter of—Joshua Tree is so big, it's just easy to, you know, do your own thing, create your own scene no matter what.\n\nSN: But in general, it wasn't really a positive relationship, would you say?\n\nDE: It was not. They were strictly law enforcement. And like I said, you know, they were trying—you know, I saw those things as minor transgressions, minor violations, you know, serious crimes going on all over the place. They you know, they could have focused on those things maybe, but....\n\nSN: But it sounds like the issues were focused on things other than like the natural environment and the impact you are having on it. Like they weren't so worried about the rosin or—\n\nDE: No, nothing to do with that, no.\n\nSN: And then in this later period where there was more conflict as the ethics were changing, were they a presence at all at that point too or—?\n\nDE: Not that I not that I could say, really. I always did my best to stay away from them, so.\n\nSN: And sounds like you were successful for most of time.\n\nDE: Never got arrested at Joshua Tree.\n\nSN: Yeah. So, I mean, of all the other places that you climbed, obviously you climbed a lot in Yosemite and other sites as well. Would you say that the situation at Joshua Tree in terms of the Ranger climber relations were similar to other places? Or was there anything that was unusual?\n\nDE: No, it was similar in Yosemite as well in the really early days. Yosemite Rangers weren't required to be law enforcement officers, but there was a certain point, probably around 1976 or 77, where it became a new policy where all rangers had to be—most rangers in Yosemite had to be law enforcement, because I had a friend who was a naturalist ranger. He refused to be law enforcement. So he ended up having to leave Yosemite.\n\nIt was the same kind of vibe in Yosemite. They were trying to bust the climbers, but mostly for sleeping out of bound, you know, drug violations mostly. Oh, and shoplifting and theft, of course, because there was a lot of that going on as well.\n\nSN: Can you say a little bit more about that, what period that was going on and what kind of form it took? Who got shoplifted from whom or whatever?\n\nDE: Oh, just, mostly just, you know, climbers trying to stay in Yosemite when they don't have any money, so they—\n\nSN: Oh, OK. In Yosemite.\n\nDE: —to the market and steal a packet of tamales or something.\n\nSN: Right. And was that similar in Joshua Tree or was there anybody to shoplift from?\n\nDE: No, Joshua Tree didn't have that.\n\nSN: Yeah. Not much opportunity in that regard. Yeah. But I was kind of wondering about that; in your experience were the climbers who were down here similar throughout these periods to the climbers in Yosemite in terms of their sort of, you know, dirtbag identity, if you want to go with that. I mean, where there are a lot of “dirtbag” climbers in Joshua Tree as well? Or was it a different kind of crowd?\n\nDE: You saw the same people. It was seasonal. Seasonal more than anything. Yosemite in the summer, Josh in winter, somewhere else in between. It’s all the same people.\n\nSN: And was that true once the ethics started to change? Was it still all the same people or was there a point where there were more different kinds of people coming in and they weren't all on the same circuit?\n\nDE: Yeah, as sport climbing took off, climbers got more interested in traveling to other areas kind of at the same time. Climbers were branching out more, I don't know. I was at that age, I was going new places and it all kind of happened at once. And the crowds got bigger and people came from other places and then there was no place to camp anymore.\n\nSN: And we're talking about the 90s?\n\nDE: Yeah. Here's the curve: the 70s, it started to go, 80s, 90s, and then, [whooshing sound] you know, the 2000s, of course, totally crazy.\n\nSN: Yeah, so it’s just been on and on and on, more sort of a steady increase. Yeah. So with regard to that, I'm just wondering about the more recent years. Do you still see—I mean, you mentioned it before, do you still see Joshua Tree as attracting this very high level climber?\n\nDE: Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, during the season, you could run into anybody. Any world famous climber here. And I have, that’s how I met—you know, I’ve climbed with all sorts of people around the world, from around the world, that I’ve met here. You know, people from Europe, Asia, East Coast, South.\n\nSN: And I take it it works both ways. You've met them here and you've met them there and seen them here, right? It isn't just meeting them here. Yeah.\n\nSo in this present era, aside from there being more people, is there any other significant difference between the way climbing is now happening in Joshua Tree and these earlier years that we've been talking about?\n\nDE: Oh, yes, completely different. The other thing that happened historically was the climbing gym explosion in the United States. That brought all these—in the early years, the climbers were by and large kind of outcasts and outdoors-y people. But that's no longer the case; with the climbing gyms, it's brought all sorts of people with purely urban backgrounds, you know, city folk who have no appreciation. Some of them have no appreciation for the wilderness or wildness. You know, they just see it as like a gym. It's a climbing gym. A rock is just like the inside of a climbing gym. They litter, they play loud music and stuff.\n\nBut yeah, now when we're climbing out here, it seems like the old ethics are completely invisible. You know, people are only sport climbing—yeah, you know, most people have an appreciation for the beauty of the place. But now the demographic includes everybody, whereas before it was a small fringe, an outcast. Now it's the entire world. People from every background, they're climbing.\n\nSN: Does that strike you as something that is regrettable on the whole or is it something you celebrate or what's your institute? What's your opinion on that?\n\nDE: Well, the more people you get out here, the more people will learn to appreciate the wilderness, will vote to protect the wilderness in the future. So that's good. But at the same time, we're getting you know, we're getting swamped. Everything is getting trampled everywhere. From Josh to MOAB to Yosemite, it's just lots of impact.\n\nSN: Yeah. So that seems like it's kind of the major issue for management at this point is managing that impact.\n\nDE: Mhmm. [Indicating agreement]\n\nSN: Yeah. I haven't asked you—I know we're kind of getting to the end of the hour, so I want to make sure I do touch on this—but I haven't asked you explicitly about the networks to which Joshua Tree has been connected in climbing and how they may have changed over the years. So I'm going to hopefully get you to mention some other places.\n\nThat’s my goal, you know, you mentioned Yosemite and other sort of big wall sites early on in your career; how has the network of sites changed with the introduction of sport climbing and gym climbing and competitive climbing and bringing this wider group of people in? So just a little bit about that.\n\nDE: Mental block here.\n\nSN: I'm just thinking, like, if I could put maps in front of you, that would say like a world map, you know, connect Joshua Tree to the spots that were visiting in the 70s and in the 80s and in the 90s, have they changed significantly? Let me just say: has the number of places that Joshua Tree relates to grown with all of this increase—?\n\nDE: Yes. Oh, yeah. There's been so much route, you know, development in the last 30 years. All of these little tiny places that nobody even looked at have been bolted up and are climbing areas now. You know, when I'm walking around Josh now, I'll see a new route. And I’ll think, “Wow, you know, why didn't we look at that?” And then I’ll realize, “Oh, yeah, because we had a million other things that were twice as big to look at.”\n\nBut now, you know, everybody’s sites are getting a little smaller. But, you know, as far as connecting Joshua Tree to other climbing areas, it's like a spider's web. We're all connected. The community is worldwide now. That's the difference. You know, before, like I said, we were islands, L.A., Orange County, and San Diego. Now it's the world community. Everything's connected because they have the Interweb thing now LOL.\n\nSN: And the Web's getting more and more and more complicated, more and more intersections. OK. So I just want to ask you some—oh, one thing I really have to touch on is Search and Rescue, something that I'm trying to document for the park. And I see your smile, smile noted, in your experience, were there any techniques or any developments in Search and Rescue that happened at Joshua Tree that have been influential with regard to the rest of the climbing world?\n\nDE: I wouldn't know. But I'm sure they're happy because a lot of the climbers who have gone on to be like movie riggers and stuff, you know, a lot of the stuff that they took into the movie industry, they developed out here. I'm sure the same thing's true with Search and Rescue; I’m just not in touch with that.\n\nSN: OK. All right. I'll keep following up on that. Thank you. And kind of the big question that we haven't touched on yet, sort of a summary question, would be with regard to the development of the sport of climbing worldwide, when you look at that, what's been going on, the history, you know, around the world, do you have a sense that there are things about the Joshua Tree landscape and the kinds of routes that it has and the kinds of practices that it has supported over the years, that there are things that were developed or that happened at Joshua Tree that really made a contribution to the way the sport has evolved?\n\nBecause I like, in contrast, say to Yosemite, I mean, we know that El Capitan has made a contribution in that regard. But is there anything comparable at Joshua Tree? You know, if Joshua Tree weren’t here, climbing wouldn't be the way it is today, right?\n\nDE: Yeah, well, in the sense that you know, climbers have goals and El Cap is a goal, it was an important goal for me. And at the same time, you know, a little first ascent at Joshua Tree was a big thing, a big goal for me too. I think every climber has that. People, when they come here from Colorado, you know, they've got goals. And so for them, they want to climb More Monkey than Funky or something, to them that's as important as climbing the El Cap or something. So in that sense, Joshua Tree contributed as much as any place in the world because it's inspired people to travel and to realize their dreams. And so, you know, a little 50 foot quartz monzonite route at Josh could be just as important as El Cap to somebody.\n\nSN: What about the rock? You mentioned that, you know, Figures On a Landscape has beautiful rock. When you compare it to other climbing sites, is there something about the rock at Joshua Tree that you would say was special?\n\nDE: Well, the best rock is the varnish, the desert varnish; it’s that plated surface that forms. And if you can climb on desert varnish, it's just the best rock. And Josh doesn't own it, you know, other desert areas have desert varnish too, I climb at Fairview all the time. And our varnish is very beautiful too.\n\nYou know, people talk about the friction, the high friction coefficient. That's true. That's fairly unique to Josh. And not that many places have [inaudible] rock that’s this rough. It’s somewhat unique in that regard.\n\nSN: Great. OK. I think I've covered the ground that we were supposed to cover today, but I want to ask Bernadette if she has any—is there anything that you'd like to hear David talk about that we haven't to look better or focused on.\n\nBR: Sure. Like when you're choosing a name for it, how do you decide what to call it?\n\nDE: Yeah. That's a fun process. Usually routes name themselves. You know, something happens during the day and everybody knows that's the name of the route. But a lot of times it comes down to a discussion at the end. Everybody has—a lot of times, we have different ideas and we're throwing them around. And it comes into wordplay. Someone might have an idea and then someone else improves it by changing, you know, changing the wording to some degree.\n\nThere’s a million different ways that routes get named. Sometimes it’s about—somebody names it after their dog or their family members, you know. But I like the ones that brings something to light that happened in the course of doing the climb, it's something that took place that day that made it… the routes name themselves often, I really like when they do.\n\nSN: Any examples come to mind?\n\nDE: Oh, boy. Well, Figures on a Landscape. The original name was Monkey on My Back, because when we were working on it, we came out here and I had some cocaine and my friend Randy and I were looking for a place to do the cocaine. So this other guy had a van and we asked him if we could sit in his van but he was very straight. He was an engineer from L.A. and he begrudgingly let us use the van. And so we went in there, did our little thing, and then he came in and he goes, “My God, you guys have such a monkey on your back!”\n\nAnd we were like, “That's it!” The next thing we're like, “That's it. That's the route name.” You know, after we finished the route a year after that, Randy just randomly changed the name to Figures On a Landscape. And I got kind of pissed off, because it was random, and it had nothing to do with what happened in the course of putting up the route.\n\nBut he had seen this Malcolm McDowell movie called Figures on the Landscape or Figure on the Landscape or something slightly different. And it inspired him and made him think of the climb. So he just took executive control and changed the name.\n\nSN: Is there a best name? Is there a best route name, in your view?\n\nDE: There's so many good ones.\n\nSN: [Laughs] We should go through a guide book with you sometime and you can weigh in.\n\nDE: Well Bernadette just asked me about this climb called “X Rated T***.” But this was when I was in high school, we were in Idyllwild going to the movie theater and it was the year Flesh Gordon came out (1974), it was kind of a campy sci-fi movie, comedy thing. Had a little nudity. And so we snuck into the theater, it was R rated, we were 16, we snuck into the theater and watched this movie. And in the middle of the scene where the breasts are revealed, my friend Matt blurted out, “Those are the first R-rated t*** I’ve ever seen!” And everybody in the theater started laughing. And so, a week later, we were putting up this other route, and we changed it and it became X Rated T***.\n\nSN: Why am I not surprised you were in high school?\n\nDE: Juvenile.\n\nSN: I'm so glad you asked that question, Bernadette, because I think Emilio has commented actually on the naming of routes. And did you have "
