ONE-TWO-THREE-FOUR!!! — Kim's catchphrase\n\nScott Pilgrim's Precious Little Life\n\nKimberly \"Kim\" Pine (b. October 1981) is the drummer for Sex Bob-omb, Stephen Stills' and Scott's band, and one of the seven main characters of the Scott Pilgrim franchise.\n\nDuring gigs (or even just when practicing at home) Kim counts in the band, usually by screaming some variation of: \"We are Sex Bob-omb!!\".\n\nShe is 23 years old (24 in Volume 5 onwards) and was Scott's first girlfriend, whom he \"saved\" from Simon Lee back when they met in high school.\n\nThe two broke up when Scott's family moved away to Toronto, and when Kim moved to Toronto herself, they formed Sex Bob-omb with Scott's former bandmate, Stephen Stills. Kim is employed at No-Account Video throughout the series, working alongside Hollie Hawkes.\n\nBiography[]\n\nScott Pilgrim graphic novels[]\n\n\"Are you kidding? Like two songs are finished.\"\n\nThis page or section is still currently being edited!\n\nIn Volume 1, Kim is introduced as a band member of Sex Bob-omb. She is first seen sitting at a table in Stephen Stills' house where she questions Scott on her new relationship with a high schooler, Knives Chau.\n\nScott Pilgrim vs. the World[]\n\nKim is played by Alison Pill whose previous works include roles in Milk, Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, and Dan in Real Life. Pill also provides the voice of Kim in the animated short Scott Pilgrim vs. The Animation which details her first meeting with Scott, his rescuing her from Simon Lee, and their brief relationship in high school. In the film, Kim's wounded feelings concerning Scott are more emphasized and her sarcastic comments are largely directed at him. Unlike the comic or game, Kim is never really seen in a relationship with Knives Chau, and only talks to her a few times.\n\nThe depth of her ire against Scott is evidenced by the fact that she does not offer a sincere smile and maintains a fierce stare throughout most of the film, blinking (also note that the film director told all the actors not to blink for a comic book effect)only a few times and almost never breaking eye contact. Despite her resentment she does offer Scott some advice regarding Ramona just before they face off against the Katayanagi twins. Although she signs on with Gideon, she is less than enthusiastic about taking orders from him, and she surreptitiously flips him off after he calls her \"Kimberly\". She then goes on to announce the band by dryly stating \"We are Sex Bob-Omb and we are here to make money and sell out and stuff\".\n\nWhen Scott uses his extra life to replay the confrontation with Gideon, he takes a moment to apologize to Kim for his behavior and himself, earning him some extra points and causing her to crack a genuine smile for the first time in the film. When Scott cues her to play she turns against Gideon by shouting \"WE ARE SEX BOB-OMB AND WE'RE HERE TO WATCH SCOTT PILGRIM KICK YOUR TEETH IN!!!\"and motivates the band to play a more enthusiastic version of their fight music.\n\nAfter Gideon is defeated, Kim states that Sex Bob-omb's business deal has just ended, prompting Stephen Stills to frantically grab as much of the reward money as he can. Neil picks up the gum Gideon swallowed, and puts it in his mouth. An annoyed Kim pretends to shoot herself for the second time in the movie.\n\nScott Pilgrim vs. the World: The Game[]\n\nKim is one of the four initial characters that can be picked in the game. Her Striker is Knives kissing her (as is what happened in Volume 4) and recovering 15 HP at the cost of around 7 GP. It also has the secondary effect of \"Freaking out\" all enemies on screen (with the exception for robot enemies, dogs and bosses, who receive small damage plus a minor hit-stun). In the game, Kim Pine has red hair and wears a black and white jacket, blue skirt, sneakers, knee high socks.\n\nHer Move set:[]\n\nJab - Kim Pine will punch or kick enemies.\n\nButt Collide - Kim Pine Use her butt collide.\n\nGrab and Pummel - Kim Pine Will grab enemies then use her knee to kick nuts.\n\nInferno Kick - Kim Pine jump then kick with flame effect.\n\nSlide Kick - Kim pine will slide kick.\n\nPunch - Kim Pine use her fist punch enemies.\n\nKick - Kim Pine Prepare to kick.\n\nDown Kick - Kim Pine will sweep on floor and use her knee kick enemies.\n\nThrow - Kim Pine will grab an Enemy then prepare for throwing.\n\nAir Kick - Kim Pine Jump Then Kick in Air.\n\nBat Spin - Kim Pine uses her metal bat spin in 360 degree.\n\nCall Knives Chau - Kim Pine points her finger and summon Knives Chau then kiss also heal you.\n\nBackward Kick - Kim Pine uses her knee kick on backward.\n\nSpin - Kim Pine uses her dual white stick spin.\n\nStomp - Kim Pine stomps enemies.\n\nIce Breath - Kim Pine will do special attack that spit an ice skull-like head.\n\nSlap - Kim Pine will slap enemies.\n\nSuper Slap - Kim Pine will slap enemies in multiple time.\n\nTaunts[]\n\nTaunt 1: Kim Pine will mock you.\n\nTaunt 2: Kim Pine will do Breakdance.\n\nAfter completing a level, Kim exits the field via a smiling star that flies off screen. This is a reference to the Kirby game series.\n\nEndings[]\n\nHer ending in the game takes off the scene from in Volume 4, where she and Knives become a couple together much to the shock of Scott and Stephen.\n\nIn Scott's ending, she along with Knives and Envy all date Scott at the same time after Ramona leaves him.\n\nIn Stephen Stills' ending, she along with her band-mates, Scott and Stephen, become very popular and rich with their band (though it's hinted it may just be a dream).\n\nIn Nega Scott's ending, Kim, along with her friends, and Scott, are the slaves of Scott's negative side.\n\nIn Knives' ending, Kim appears as one of the spectators to Knives and Scott's wedding, while Scott himself is completely confused.\n\nScott Pilgrim Takes Off[]\n\nIn \"Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Life\", Kim is first seen performing with Sex Bob-omb. She sarcastically tells Scott that his life is interesting, something which Scott acknowledges but later realises that she was indeed being sarcastic. Kim, along with Scott and Stephen later prepare for Sex Bob-omb's performance, Kim unintentionally causes Stephen much anxiety as Crash and the Boys pull out, with Stephen believing that they did so because they thought Sex Bob-omb sucked. Kim and the rest of the band perform \"Orange Shirt\" shortly before Matthew Patel breaks in and challenges Scott to a fight. Kim, along with the others, are shocked when Scott gets \"defeated\" at the hands of Matthew.\n\nIn \"A League of Their Own\", Kim attends Scott's funeral. Kim sits next to Young Neil and tells him \"nobody wins forever\" in response to him stating that Scott always won. Young Neil responds back by saying \"the house [always wins]\", Kim is later seen moving away from Young Neil immediately afterwards.\n\nIn \"Ramona Rents a Video\", Kim tells Stephen that the only thing Scott contributed to the band was \"bass\" after he reels from his loss. Kim later performs with Knives Chau for four hours before realising that she was late for work at No-Account Video. Ramona enters hoping to meet Kim, to learn more about Scott's background as she started to investigate Scott's disappearance after discovering that he was not dead, and instead was grabbed into a portal by a mysterious figure. Ramona tells Kim that Scott was actually alive, after she intially thought that Scott faked his death in order to avoid paying for his late fees are being charged $3,500. After Kim is told by Ramona that he is alive, Kim reiterates Young Neil's \"the house [always wins]\" line from the funeral, citing that it was \"a dumb thing that a dumb person once said\".\n\nAfter seeking further information, Kim reveals to Ramona that Scott was her first boyfriend and that they met in high school before saving her from Simon Lee and the Benvie Boys. Kim goes on to tell Ramona that they broke up after Scott moved to Toronto.\n\nDuring Ramona and Roxie's fight, Kim and Hollie watch them battle. Kim rewinds the film that Ramona and Roxie are fighting in, which results in Roxie coming out and destroying the remote. After they make amends, Ramona and Roxie sit with Kim, and Roxie and Kim kiss one another, to which she stated that there were no sparks. After Roxie leaves, Kim is flabbergasted that Ramona used to date Lucas Lee.\n\nKim later appears in \"WHODIDIT\" where she, along with Stephen, Knives and Young Neil update Ramona with information on her ongoing investigation to find out what happened to Scott. Ramona tells all three of them that she had managed to crack the case wide open, telling her that the Katayanagi Twins created a portal and took Scott from the gig at the Rockit. Kim, along with the others are shocked when Scott arrives back on the doorstep of Ramona's Apartment, telling them all that he was behind the whole disappearance.\n\nIn \"2 Scott 2 Pilgrim\", Kim watches on as Future Ramona arrives. She takes pictures of the both of them, and later watches Future Ramona return to the future. Kim is later amused when Scott and Ramona are unable to kiss as a result of the AK-Field. After Knives' suggestion that the League of Evil Exes may have been behind the AK-Field, Kim, along with the others attend the opening night of Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Musical.\n\nIn \"The World Vs Scott Pilgrim\", Kim states that she is only attending the premiere to support Stephen who had worked on the production of the musical along with Knives. During the show, Kim is transported to the Dream Desert along with Scott and his friends, and the Evil Exes. There, she witnesses Even Older Scott fight Scott and Ramona. Shortly afterwards, she is transported back to the theatre. When Scott and Ramona get sent back by Super Ramona, Kim smiles as Scott and Ramona share a kiss. Kim is later seen closing No-Account Video with Hollie. Afterwards, they visit Second Cup where they find Lucas Lee working as a barista. After Lucas tries to entice Kim and Hollie, Kim tells him \"whatever\" as she leaves.\n\nKim is later seen performing with Sex Bob-omb who have reunited following Scott's return from the future. Kim goes back on her word that she thought the band sucked, by stating that they were actually good since Knives joined the band, playing the keyboard. She last appears hanging out with Scott, Stephen, Knives and Young Neil where they meet up with Ramona at her apartment, and they all begin to go and hang out together.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nKim has a sarcastic personality and is known to be a misanthrope. A common character trait of Kim's is usually cracking sarcastic comments and jokes at the expense of her friends, mainly Scott. In the earlier books, Kim was also shown to have not much hope for Sex Bob-omb, often pointing out that they suck. Some of Kim's aforementioned comments include, \"Scott, your life is so interesting...\", \"Are you really evil or are you really happy?\" and \"I'm tragically sorry to have woken you up so tragically early, Sara\"[1]. Another Kim trait was her patience for people she views as (and is usually right about) being moronic, i.e. Scott Pilgrim, her roommates, and Julie Powers, even telling Jason about the latter that they are \"tragically not\" her friends. She also makes gestures that most would consider rude or unwelcome, such as flipping off Stephen and doing finger-guns when hanging out with Ramona and her band.\n\nBryan Lee O'Malley hinted that Kim may have an inferiority complex, noting how she isn't necessarily less attractive, but believes so, hinting at insecurity about her beauty. The biggest example of this is how she depressingly laments Envy's beauty when compared to her own, noting how she's on the cover of a magazine with makeup. O'Malley responded with saying that by delving deep, there's more to it than having the reader just assuming that is Envy is pretty and Kim is sad and ugly[2].\n\nKim \"dislikes many people (possibly everyone)\"[3], as such, her relationships with the other characters is an interesting topic: while it may seem on the surface that she does not hold them in very high regard, she enjoys their company and cares about them all. Kim's most known relationships would be those of Hollie Hawkes, her roommates[4], and Scott Pilgrim.\n\nTowards her roommates, Kim is annoyed by their existence, often doing things to spite them (such as stabbing a voodoo doll) or thinking violent thoughts about them. As seen in The Wonderful World of Kim Pine, her relationship with them is dysfunctional at best. Kim is easily annoyed by them, getting angry over the littlest things, such as being told to turn her music down (despite using headphones), being yelled at for making too much noise in the morning, and getting angry after two of them eat her bread and throw her laundry down the stairs. Kim will sometimes try and remain civil, but she usually reacts, using violence (such as the aforementioned voodoo doll) or insulting them. Hollie empathized with how Kim felt towards her roommates and helped her move in with her.\n\nHollie and Kim, due to being co-workers at No-Account Video have a professional and friendly relationship. In the first scene we see them share, Kim insults Hollie, telling her how she hates everyone, with Hollie responding by calling her a \"holy terror\". Aside from this scene, Kim doesn't display much hostility towards her, even inviting her to Sex Bob-omb's event at Lee's Palace. While at work, Hollie is shown to laze around, eating nuts and watching TV, forcing Kim to deal with the customers, though this may have just been exclusive to the anime. After the store closed, they maintained their friendship and went for coffee, only to leave after seeing Lucas Lee working there. However, Kim's friendship with Hollie was most likely ended after her boyfriend, Jason, cheated on her with Hollie. When asked about this by Scott, Kim told him and Ramona that Hollie was \"dead to me\"[5].\n\nHowever, her greatest relationship seems to be with Scott. Like with her roommates, she expresses annoyance towards his idiocy and was one of many people who mocked him for dating Knives Chau. Despite how she usually acts towards Scott, she is willing to help him out and is a fiercely loyal friend who will do anything for him. She helped him find a job, encouraged him to play for Ramona, and when Ramona disappeared, she let him crash at her place and helped him with his emotional issues.\n\nAll in all, while Kim may act sarcastic and hostile, she loves her friends deeply and truly cares for them, willing to help them out and offer advice.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nKim is a fair skinned young girl of average height with three freckles on each one of her cheeks, though in the earlier comics she has more. She has red hair, styled in a bob shoulder-length haircut. In Scott's flashback, however, we see that her hair was long and tied back into a ponytail during her high school years.\n\nAlthough much like the other characters, Kim changes her outfit frequently. She’s mostly seen sporting various kinds of tracksuit jackets and skirts with varying colours. In the game, she wears a black and white tracksuit with a skirt.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nMain article: Kim Pine/Relationships\n\nTrivia[]\n\nShe has been the drummer for three of Scott's bands, Sonic and Knuckles, Sex Bob-omb and Shatter Band. She also played as the drummer in her school band prior to this.\n\nKim always shouts: \"WE ARE [BAND NAME]!\" before every song, regardless of whether they are playing at a live gig or just practicing.\n\nAdditionally, with the exception of the comics, she usually accompanies this by wracking her drumsticks together.\n\nHer most recent boyfriend, Jason Kim, cheated on her with her roommate Hollie Hawkes.\n\nKim dated Scott in high school, but broke up with him when Lisa told her that Scott was moving to Toronto.\n\nTechnically speaking, Kim Pine was the first Scott Pilgrim character ever created. Bryan Lee O'Malley originally came up with her all the way back in the late 90s. She was originally conceived as part of a mutant super-team. Over the next few years, the character drifted from one story idea to another, changing quite a bit over time, until she made her published debut as a Scott Pilgrim character. (For more info, see here, here and here.)\n\nScott is one month older than her. If meant literally, that means her birthday is October 27, which is dangerously close to Halloween, and might explain why she is so grim. Bryan Lee O'Malley also planned for her birthday to be in \"late October\".[6]\n\nAn early version of Kim and Lisa appear in a mini-comic by Bryan Lee O'Malley called \"Style\", about three ridiculous girls in high school. In this comic, Kim is a brunette with blonde highlights while Lisa frequently changes her hair color, similar to Ramona. (For more info, see here.)\n\nKim is of medium height (about 5'5'').[7]\n\nKim is the only one of Scott's exes that Ramona doesn't fight.\n\nKim is the only one of Scott's friends who doesn't encounter Roxie Richter and Gideon Graves in the series, with the exception of Scott Pilgrim Takes Off.\n\nQuotes\n\nGallery\n\nReferences[]\n\nKim Pine General information Biography | Relationships | Appearances | Gallery | Powers and Abilities | Personality and Traits | Quotes Items and objects Kim's drumset Events Graphic novels: Lunchapalooza | Gigs | Battle at Club Rockit | Skirmish at Casa Loma | Show at Lee's Palace Gig at Lee's Palace | Bass Battle | Encounter with Mr. Chau | Fight with Robot-01 | Gig at Sneaky Dee's | Fight with Unnamed Third Robot | Duel at Queen and Bathurst | Duel with Nega Scott\n\nScott Pilgrim vs. the World: Battle at Club Rockit | Toronto International Battle of the Bands | Showdown at the Ninth Circle | Showdown at Chaos Theatre\n\nTakes Off: Battle at Club Rockit | Scott Pilgrim's Funeral | Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Musical | Battle at the Dream Desert Family Mr. and Mrs. Pine (parents) Residences Toronto (Hollie's Apartment | Kim's Parents' House | Kim's Apartment | Kim's Room) Education St. Joel's Catholic High School\n\nSex Bob-omb Members Scott Pilgrim | Stephen Stills | Kim Pine\n\nOther: Neil Nordegraf | Knives Chau Discography Graphic novels: \"LaunchPad McQuack\" | \"Kim's Song\" | \"Erasmus the Enchanter\" | \"Herself the Elf\"\n\nScott Pilgrim vs. the World: \"We Are Sex Bob-omb\" | \"Garbage Truck\" | \"Threshold\" | \"Indefatigable\" | \"No Fun\" | \"Summertime\" | \"Gasoline Eyes\" | \"Disgusting Rainbow\"\n\nTakes Off: \"I Feel Fine\" | \"Orange Shirt\" Events Graphic novels: Gigs | Battle at Club Rockit | Show at Lee's Palace | Gig at Lee's Palace | Bass Battle | Gig at Sneaky Dee's | Skirmish at Chaos Theatre\n\nScott Pilgrim vs. the World: Battle at Club Rockit | Toronto International Battle of the Bands | Showdown at the Ninth Circle | Skirmish at Chaos Theatre\n\nTakes Off: Battle at Club Rockit | Battle at the Dream Desert Objects, weapons and powers Stephen's guitar | Scott's Bass | Kim's drumset | Yeti | Musical Shield"
