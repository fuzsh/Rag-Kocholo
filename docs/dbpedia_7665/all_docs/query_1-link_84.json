        "text": "Chicago P.D. is adding a Warrior Nun to its ranks.\n\nToya Turner has joined the Dick Wolf procedural in a series regular role for the upcoming Season 12, sources confirm to TVLine exclusively.\n\nUpdate: The actress, who recently recurred on NBC‘s New Amsterdam, is set to play Kiana Cook, a patrol officer who loves the adrenaline of the job and its stakes and doesn’t blink in the face of chaos. (Note: The character was previously named Yara Page.)\n\nTurner is no stranger to #OneChicago, having previously guest-starred on both Chicago Med and Chicago Fire. Her arrival on Chicago P.D. comes in the wake of Tracy Spiridakos’ departure as Det. Hailey Upton in the Season 11 finale after seven full seasons with the show. (Read our post-mortem interview with showrunner Gwen Sigan about Upton’s exit here.)\n\nTurner, who began her career training at the prestigious British American Drama Academy (BADA) at Oxford University, has appeared on numerous TV series, including Grey’s Anatomy, The Mick, Easy and Empire (starring Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson).\n\nChicago P.D. centers on the elite Intelligence Unit from District 21 as they tackle the city’s most heinous offenses, such as organized crime, drug trafficking and high-profile murders.\n\nThe current ensemble includes Jason Beghe as Sgt. Hank Voight, LaRoyce Hawkins as Officer Kevin Atwater, Marina Squerciati as Officer Kim Burgess, Patrick John Flueger as Officer Adam Ruzek, Benjamin Levy Aguilar as Officer Dante Torres and Amy Morton as Desk Sergeant Trudy Platt.\n\nAdditionally, Bojana Novakovic recurred in Season 11 as embattled SVU detective Jo Petrovic, who checked into rehab towards the end of the season at Upton’s behest.\n\nChicago P.D. will premiere with Season 12 on Wednesday, Sept. 25 at 10/9c."
