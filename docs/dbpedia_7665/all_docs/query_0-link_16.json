That arduous journey fuels her beliefs around leveraging tools and supports to drive change. She now thrives on boldly showing up and redefining what is possible in learning spaces and throughout the broader community — and has personal experience challenging the status quo, which is featured in the 2021 documentary, This Is Not About Me.\n\nTechnology enabled effective communication, and Jordyn began advocating through a series of presentations and keynotes around the world. She has played a pivotal role on several projects focused on accessibility — and her insights on autism and inclusion have been published in places such as The Boston Globe and The New York Times, as well as quotes in The 19th. Jordyn is Board Chair of the nonprofit CommunicationFIRST, an Apple Distinguished Educator, and is a two-time appointee on The United States Presidential Committee for People with Intellectual Disabilities.\n\nJordyn has this to say about the impact of speech and debate in her life » “Speech and debate instilled me with a deep sense of confidence and a drive for connection. It taught me the power of sharing my story, honing in on my thoughts, thinking creatively, listening critically, and speaking in-depth about a singular topic, in a rather short period of time. Now, as a national presenter at conferences, speech and debate definitely contributes to my composure, poise, assessment of the audience, and ability to function well under pressure.”\n\nSocial Handles:\n\nClass of 1999 | Beaverton High School, Oregon\n\nJoseph Shapiro is Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at Yale University.
