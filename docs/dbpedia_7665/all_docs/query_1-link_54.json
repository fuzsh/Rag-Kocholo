        "text": "Columns compiled by your class correspondents\n\n1940s\n\n1948\n\nIf you read my January/February Class Notes column, you will recall that I shared an excerpt from an essay I wrote about my time at Cornell, originally written for and published by my fraternity, Alpha Delta Phi. That essay is continued here:\n\nReturning to Cornell in the fall of 1946, after a summer working for Standard Oil of Ohio, I occupied the former alumni suite at Alpha Delt with two others. My roommates were Jim Sliger ’49 and Bob Engelbert ’49. Don Knowlton ’49 occupied the single room on the hall across from the bathroom. Don was studying electrical engineering, Bob was in civil engineering, and I was in chemical engineering. I was still on a tight budget, even with the scholarships and the GI Bill, so the chapter very generously gave me the job of house manager and my room rent free. My main duties were to collect the monthly checks from the members living in the house, all under the guidance of Jim Rice ’30, BS ’33, the alumnus mainstay in the stability of the Cornell chapter for many years. I was also the “official” contact with our houseman, Reggie, and our cook, Rose Reber. Reggie seemed to have been there forever—and I think Rose was somewhat new.\n\nBy the fall of 1946, most servicemen were back on campus. We had quite a group of Alpha Delt married vets—a few even with children. Cornell had built “Vetsburg” on the Ag campus, which was a group of apartments for returning married vets to live in. On each Wednesday evening, we had an expanded dinner, where the married families could join us downstairs in the dining room. Dinner was preceded with a cocktail hour in the library. It was very well attended by all, and my memory is of everyone standing around with their beers or martinis (or what have you), toddlers wandering around among us, and the occasional squeal when a too-full drink got spilled on one of the toddlers.\n\nI think that fuel supplies must have been still tight then, because we set the main hall thermostat to take the temperature of the whole house down every night to maybe 55 degrees. That worked for a while, but there were complaints. Then the complaints stopped, and it took me a little while to figure out that someone was coming down later in the evening and cracking open the window closest to the thermostat so it got below 55 there quickly while the whole upstairs got warm and comfortable! Very creative, but we had to stop it!\n\nOn each Wednesday evening, [Alpha Delta Phi] had an expanded dinner, where the married families could join us downstairs in the dining room.\n\nRay Tuttle ’48\n\nAs to social life with the opposite sex … pre-war, Alpha Delts were not allowed to date coeds. That must have meant you either abstained until house-party time, went up to Wells College for your dates, or dated a “townie” or Ithaca College girl. After the war, that custom also faded away, probably because the veterans had had enough abstinence overseas in the service. Post-war, everyone I had known had graduated, so I dated around and eventually went rather steadily with a girl from Alpha Omicron Pi. We had a few who still went up to Wells College, but there was only one (!) automobile in our large parking lot, and I remember it as being something like a cross between a Jeep and a truck. I think it was called the “green machine” and belonged to Thomas Wells ’43.\n\nThe women’s dorms and sorority houses all required the coeds to be back in their rooms every weekday night by 8 or 9 p.m., and I believe on Saturday it was 11:30 p.m. The University was still in loco parentis in those days (which I guess means Cornell was your parent). Coeds could “sign out” when their parents were visiting or for an approved house party on campus.\n\nA date frequently meant going downtown to Zinck’s, to the Dutch Kitchen in the basement of the Hotel Ithaca, to a bar on Stewart Ave., or to one of several other bars in Collegetown. The back end of Zinck’s had the shields of the “big six” fraternities around the top of the walls above the molding, and Alpha Delta Phi’s was one of them. The Dutch Kitchen was famous for its wooden tables, completely covered with carved signatures of students and (mostly) former students. On trips down there, I marveled at how people in these two crowded bars would get the urge to go to the other bar at the same time, and the crowds would pass each other on the main street between them!\n\nAt a later date, I was shocked to go back to Ithaca and find that Zinck’s had moved to a new location a block away. I was more shocked to go inside and see a television over the bar! It had totally lost the atmosphere I remembered. This was not the bar of “Give My Regards to Davy.”\n\nAt Alpha Delt, the arrangement for a house party was to completely block the second-floor hall about halfway down and to give the back half of the house to the visiting dates. Two adult couples were required to be present as chaperones (a happy task that Peg Wilharm Tuttle and I performed several times after we were married). ❖ Ray Tuttle (email Ray) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1949\n\nHappy spring! Please take a moment to write to us. What is a typical day in your life like? Is anything new happening with your family? Have you read any good books lately? We’d love to hear from you. ❖ Class of 1949 (email c/o Alexandra Bond ’12) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1950s\n\n1950\n\nThis column is a follow-up to my January/February 2024 column in which Betsy Alexander Weis suggested I might feature succinct biographies of outstanding female members of our class.\n\nThis sounded like a dandy idea, but as I started to work on it, I encountered several problems. First, most of those about whom I might write are deceased and thus not available for interviews. Second, my information would have to be drawn almost exclusively from the book by our classmate Marion Steinmann, Women at Work: Demolishing a Myth of the 1950s. Moreover, Marion’s book is 20 years old, and focused primarily on the then-employment experiences of our accomplished women classmates.\n\nHowever, I decided to see what I could do and for this column provide succinct but revealing bios for Betsy, two former class officers, and three class members currently serving as class officers. These short bios are not intended to be comprehensive life bios—rather they are intended to reveal the extent to which our women classmates demolished a myth of the ’50s that women were not welcome in the workforce, particularly in the professions.\n\nBetsy Alexander Weis raised eight children—seven girls, one boy. All are college graduates and hold 11 graduate degrees among them. After her husband died and her youngest went off to college, to “open up her brain” she enrolled in Gogebic Community College, in Ironwood, MI, and earned an associate’s degree with honors. At the age of 60, four decades away from Cornell, she went on to law school. Betsy then worked until age 75 as an attorney in Wilmington, NC, specializing in elder and disability law, with a focus on estate and retirement planning. Betsy twice received the Pro Bono Award for New Hanover County and served as chairman of the Elder Law Section of the North Carolina State Bar Association.\n\nRuth “Midge” Downey Crone (MA 1978, Virginia Tech) is our current class secretary. For four years after graduation, she taught home economics; then, until 1965, she was a stay-at-home mom with four kids. Energized by a love of early childhood education, when the youngest became age 9 Midge embarked on a successful, rewarding career in a variety of roles in the profession of education including kindergarten teacher, reading specialist, and curriculum developer of reading and writing programs for kindergarten through sixth grade.\n\nAt the age of 60, four decades away from Cornell, Betsy Alexander Weis ’50 went on to law school.\n\nMary Holcomb Haberman (MA 1978, New York University) serves on our class advisory council. Mary had a varied career, teaching high school theater arts, co-authoring books on poultry farming and veterinary medicine with her husband, and managing a consulting group for technology transfer and patents in the life sciences area for university clients. Her love for teaching also actively engaged her as a volunteer for many community theater organizations.\n\nMarjorie Leigh Hart was an amazing pioneer, one of only five female engineering graduates of 256, and one of only two in chemical engineering, a recognized challenging academic field. From Cornell she went directly on to a high-level career as an engineer and corporate planner and marketing executive in Exxon Corporation (formerly Standard Oil). Marjorie was the first professional woman that Exxon sent overseas, first in Tokyo and later in London. Marjorie was also the first woman to be permitted to dine in the corporate dining room! In 1966 she married, and writes, “Continuing to work was a given of a late marriage.” Marjorie served on Cornell’s Board of Trustees and is a Lifetime Presidential Counselor. She and husband Gurnee endowed the Marjorie L. Hart Chair of Engineering.\n\nPat Carry Stewart had a 42-year career in the top levels of business and finance including (remarkable for its time) as president of a New York Stock Exchange firm and board member for multiple firms. After graduation she worked one year as a foreign correspondent for Irving Trust, where she experienced gender discrimination. From 1951 to 1960 she was employed by Eliot Janeway, which gave her responsibility and authority for economic consulting and forecasting. In 1955 she was elected corporate secretary and treasurer. As she has said, “a remarkable achievement for a young female.” In 1961, Pat joined Buckner & Co., served for 12 years, and rose to president. Along the corporate way she served three times as our class president, 25 years on Cornell’s Board of Trustees, and six years as vice chair.\n\nNancy Hubbard Brandt (MA 1980, Loyola of Chicago) is deceased but was class co-president from 2000–05 with husband James. When the youngest of her four children was off to college, Nancy earned a master’s degree and went on to a 15-year career in banking. “Half my time was banking, the other half was giving money away.” From 1980–87, she was an investment-banking specialist assisting school districts and other public entities to access the financial market. From 1987–95, she was manager of education programs in the community relations department of the Bank of America. Her career was built on an early interest in the League of Women Voters, particularly in the structure, function, and funding of state and local government. At the time of Marion’s book, Nancy reported that if she were in college today she would have majored in government and gone on to law school. ❖ Paul Joslin (email Paul) | 13731 Hickman Rd., #4207, Urbandale, IA 50323 | tel., (515) 278-0960 | Alumni Directory.\n\n1951\n\n“I have no idea how I got so old so fast,” writes Janet Armstrong Hamber. “I can remember clearly at about 12, wondering what it would be like to be as old, old, old as 60! And here I am at 94!\n\n“I had a wonderful party put together by my ‘other daughter,’ Liz, my Nancy’s best friend and the woman I’ve just included as part of my family. Since I only had two children, other men and women have come into my life as major individuals, so I call them my other children—that includes two more sons and two more daughters, plus my daughters-in-law and two grandchildren. Blended families are common now and make for a grand addition. On my actual birthday, Liz, daughter number two, set up a table on her patio and invited my family and a few friends for shish kebab dinner.\n\n“Another birthday party was held a week later, put together by my son at a new Mexican restaurant. This one had all five of my family at the table except my one grandson who lives in Boulder, CO. I’m still working with the California Condor Archives but not out in the field now. I’m in pretty good health so I may make it in just six more years to 100!” ❖ Class of 1951 (email c/o Alexandra Bond ’12) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1952\n\nLewis Ward-Baker writes from Rochester, NY: “I’m happy to report that I’m still singing! Our quartet plus piano, the Voices of the Spirit, participated in the annual meeting of the New York State Universalists in Binghamton in October. And I’m in the large Eastman-Rochester Chorus. We’re working on a ‘Mass in D’ by Ethel Smyth to be performed in Kodak Hall. If you’ve never heard of her (like me), you can look her up. Also, I had great joy when 26 members of our family convened for a glorious week in New Harbor, ME, in August. I’m so grateful.”\n\nHelen Pellman Marsh writes from Middlebury, VT: “Living in the Residence at Otter Creek gives great satisfaction. I own my condo and have many friends I dine with and partake in many activities, including weekly discussions of articles from the New Yorker magazine. I helped my late husband, Charles Sabukewicz, publish two books of poetry and will get another published posthumously this winter.” Helen had a nice trip to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick last August and is glad she is able to travel. While hard to pick a favorite memory from her time at Cornell, she recalls the Beaux Arts Ball, theater presentations, and “sneaking out of the dorm at night and returning without being caught.” She also had special friends at Telluride. ❖ Thomas Cashel, LLB ’56 (email Tom) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1953\n\n’53 class president Bill Gratz was looking forward to the midwinter Cornell Alumni Leadership Conference to be held in Baltimore in February. In November 2022, Bill went to NYC to attend the Russekoff Lecture at the Cornell Club, presented by Associate Professor Jesse Goldberg, the Robert R. Capranica Fellow in the Department of Neurobiology and Behavior, College of Arts & Sciences. The lecturer discussed his research studying behaviors in songbirds. “Research into songbird behavior sheds light on core functions of human brain regions that go awry in numerous disorders, such as Parkinson’s, dystonia, and ADHD,” he reports. The annual lecture was established by David Russekoff ’89 in honor of his mother, Mitzi Sutton Russekoff ’54.\n\nSince his recovery from a broken leg early in 2023, Bob Neff, JD ’56, is savoring mobility. Fifteen family members, ages 8 to 92, celebrated Christmas together at the Yellowstone Club in Montana. Then he and his wife, Julie, left for a month of sailing among the Pacific islands. “Since 2024 is our 50th anniversary year—we met in May and married in November—we are filling it with memory joggers,” he reports.\n\n’53 readers who had classes or activities at McGraw Hall will be interested to know that it has now been targeted for restoration beginning in 2024–25. Built in 1872, McGraw is currently the home to both history and anthropology and was previously home to the government departments, symbolizing Cornell’s liberal arts core. The renovation will transform the space into a modern facility for students and faculty with a brand new interior complete with active learning classrooms and state of the art technology.\n\nBob Neff found McGraw just the place to escape the distractions of the campus. “While I was attempting to catch up in calculus as a freshman, I couldn’t concentrate in the dorm or the main library. But I found a small room in McGraw with reading ‘stations,’ where you put your book on a lighted board and viewed it through a stereopticon, which wrapped around the eyes. Everything else was shut out! It worked, and nobody ever said I couldn’t co-opt the room in the evenings. (This may have been a residual problem from attending a boys-only boarding school and then being surrounded with Cornell’s coeds. You ladies were distracting!)” ❖ Caroline Mulford Owens (email Caroline) | Jack Brophy (email Jack) | John Nixon (email John) | Bob Neff, JD ’56 (email Bob) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1954\n\nAs you read this, our 70th Reunion will be three months away! Dave, PhD ’60, and Mary Gentry Call have been planning and working to make it a memorable weekend. Here is their message: “Plans are in place for a great 70th Reunion for the Class of 1954, June 6–9. Information on housing and other details has been sent by Alumni Affairs. Still to come are the registration materials, which are scheduled to be sent in late March or early April. We will have meals in the Statler and other locations that are handicap accessible. Transportation will be available from the Statler to various venues for lectures, forums, and music. Spouses, caregivers, and friends are welcome at all events. Come on, classmates. Join us for a great Reunion!” We hope for your presence to make it a resounding success!\n\nYou can be present either in person or by message. Of course, coming in person is best. We hope to have more classmates with us than ’53 managed in 2022: 10 (with caregivers making a total of 20). Registrations are accepted at the Statler at (800) 541-2501. Another option is the Best Western University Inn at (607) 272-6100. If you can’t join us, please submit an online news form so we can hear from you. As always, you may email Bill Waters, MBA ’55, or me, Ruth Carpenter Bailey. Jan Jakes Kunz, who has managed our class website for years, will share your news with everyone who reads there.\n\nWe encourage you to contact old friends and encourage them to join us. If you need help in locating contact information, go to the Alumni Directory. You may also update your own contact information here.\n\nAge is taking its toll, and we understand none of us will escape that. Two of our class officers are dealing with illness. President Chick Trayford, MBA ’60, has asked Jack Vail, vice president, to carry on while he undergoes treatment, and Jim Settel has turned over duties as treasurer to Mary Call. We think of them and those who are dealing with the challenges of living in aging bodies, theirs or those of loved ones. That is ALL of us!\n\nYesterday I bought the RBG stamps. One more honor for Ruth. I still send some snail mail and look forward to using them.\n\nYesterday I bought the RBG stamps. One more honor for Ruth.\n\nRuth Carpenter Bailey ’54\n\nBy the way, you may have read that the print edition of Cornellians has been discontinued. The staff strove valiantly to create a quality magazine. They spent nearly as much time doing that, which reached 394 subscribers, as preparing the digital version, which reaches 43,857 average monthly users. It is a sad but necessary decision. However, Bill and Ruth will continue to piece together a column as long as you keep sending news and views.\n\nSpeaking of which, Ed McDowell sent a copy of their holiday letter, which covered their lives during 2023. Ed and his wife, Joyce (Dudley) ’57, remain very active, though the letter admits to the help of a wheelchair now and then. They live in Kilauea, HI, and travel frequently. After a Pacific cruise in the fall, they flew to Paris in the spring. They met their son and his wife and enjoyed touring in Lyon. They learned about the large textile industry in Lyon since the Middle Ages, and they saw demonstrations of weaving and silk screening. Then they cruised up the Rhône on the Scenic Sapphire. Highlights were the Abbey at Cluny and the 2,000-year-old Roman bridge at Avignon. In Houston, encouraged by their son’s interest, they viewed a collection of Escher at the Houston Museum of Art. Later they flew to Tahiti and sailed to Chile. Surprise! “We found we are not as agile as in the past and had trouble entering and exiting the Zodiac boats in heavy swell.” Ed, we admire your extensive travels and definitely expect you and Joyce to join us in Ithaca!\n\nSomehow Ed finds time to read. Two recommendations from him: The First Congress (Congress was about evenly divided between Federalists and anti-Federalists) and A Woman of No Importance (an American spy who helped build the French resistance in WWII).\n\nWe look forward to seeing some of you in June on the Hill, and we hope to hear from many more of you as you send news from wherever you may be. ❖ Ruth Carpenter Bailey (email Ruth) | Bill Waters, MBA ’55 (email Bill) | Class website | Alumni Directory.\n\n1955\n\nRichard Bump writes, “I was Cornell freshman stroke and JV stroke for three years. My favorite memory of Cornell was stroking the JV boat to their first victory at the international rowing regatta in 10 years against the unbeaten Naval Academy. We had a full three-page spread in Life magazine. I also remember singing a solo in the Glee Club. I remember Tom Tracy, our great director, who, like me, had no music degree and a degree in engineering. By the way, I went to Germany to sing, as first tenor soloist, 29 full-length operas in three prestigious opera houses. Sharon Flynn ’57 was with me. We had 20 years married, then I was alone for 20 years, and now I’ve had 20 years with my husband, Trevor Hunter. I’m 90 now, and still singing!”\n\nRob Stotz has been keeping busy with many projects at his retirement community. He is drama club chairman, making stained and fused glass art, enjoying social interactions, and writing, producing, and directing plays. Elinor Rohrlich Koeppel writes, “I guess I’m the oldest of the old, but I don’t feel it. I’m still playing tennis. I was big on ice skating, but when I fell and this time broke a bone in my hand I got spooked and gave it up.”\n\nJoan Groskin Promin writes, “After many years of living in the countryside (and caring for all those dogs and horses), I simplified my life and moved to lovely Ocala, FL. I have supported the University of Florida Phillips Center for the Performing Arts and served on their advisory board. More recently I’ve continued my painting and have been active in Fort King Presbyterian Church’s Art For All program. We reach out into the community providing multiple kinds of art projects for all ages. Sadly, my husband, Dick, died last year. He practiced medicine in Ocala for almost 30 years.” ❖ Class of 1955 (email c/o Alexandra Bond ’12) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1956\n\n“I wonder if any classmates in the tri-state area would like to join me for one of those great Wednesday night lobster dinners at the Cornell Club,” writes Carole Rapp Thompson. She adds, “There are other menu items available besides lobster.” If you’d like to write to Carole, email Alexandra Bond ’12 and she will put you in touch!\n\nCarol Skidmore Cuddeback is enjoying her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. She writes, “By April I will have 30 greats!” Carol’s favorite memory of Cornell? “Meeting my future wonderful husband, Chris ’55, BME ’57, who died 10 years ago.”\n\nBarbara Travis Osgood, PhD ’80, writes, “Although I wasn’t able to persuade my granddaughter to attend Cornell, I am still very proud of her. She graduated from Penn State in May 2023 with a degree in meteorology. Since then, she has been a meteorologist on News Center Maine, the NBC affiliate in Portland, ME. Every weekday at 5 p.m., I tune my iPad to News Center Maine and watch my granddaughter do the weather. It is the high point of my day!”\n\nRichard Veron was recently featured in a Cornellians story about how he takes ice skating lessons from a fellow Cornell alum, former national competitor Jaclyn Klein Walker ’07, BS ’06, MPA ’08. Fifty years apart in age, the pair initially struck up a conversation when Richard noticed Jaclyn’s Cornell jacket, and they have been skating together for 13 years since. You can find the story here, and see photos of Richard and Jaclyn—and even watch a video of them skating together! ❖ Class of 1956 (email c/o Alexandra Bond ’12) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1957\n\nWe can only be amazed at the directions our lives have taken since our time on the Cornell campus. Let’s look at some of those. Ted Engel, MBA ’58, MS ’64, chose to enroll in the Ag College after serving in the U.S. Navy during the Korean War. His life experiences were different from most of his male classmates, yet when he double-registered to earn his MBA, he found other veterans who were likewise double-registered. Ted remained on campus as a research assistant and added an MS degree to his resume. His career turned to retail grocery sales and culminated as a regional director for the Kroger Company.\n\nAbout 35 years ago, Ted added an avocation: he races and breeds horses. The training of these horses begins in January and the races run through November. He has bred Thoroughbred horses in the past, but now he concentrates on his Standardbreds. His great enjoyment comes as he cheers when one of his horses wins a race. He admits to having five sons and one daughter, yet the closest one of his offspring came to attending Cornell was when one of his sons attended Colgate. Ted keeps up with all the changes that have taken place as the College of Agriculture evolved into CALS—without the farm-related requirement, which was in place in our era.\n\nAfter graduating from Cornell, P. Beach Kuhl headed to Stanford University and earned his law degree. After completing his military obligation as a lieutenant in the Coast Guard, he planted his roots in the San Francisco area. His career was as an attorney, and he was recognized as the Defense Attorney of 2001 by the San Francisco Trial Lawyers Association. He also served as the pro tem judge and arbiter of the San Francisco Supreme Court.\n\nSince July 2013, Beach has served as mayor of Ross, CA, a suburban town in Marin County, north of San Francisco. There, he is recognized as the voice of calm reason, especially in a recent situation when the private college prep school Branson School sought town approval to expand from 320 students. His leadership ultimately brought approval to add 100 students. When he visited the school, he found that “Beach for President” posters had been hung to honor him. Imagine his surprise soon after to find folks wearing T-shirts with his likeness and the same logo. His term on the Ross town council ends in 2024, giving him more time to relax and read. Each summer his family gathers for about a month on their home on Lake Tahoe. Still vibrant among his Cornell memories are the many hours spent working and writing for the Widow.\n\nSince July 2013, P. Beach Kuhl ’57 has served as mayor of Ross, CA, a suburban town in Marin County, north of San Francisco.\n\nRobert Chatterton, PhD ’63’s Cornell experience began as a student of animal science. He followed his Cornell bachelor’s degree with a master’s in nutrition from UConn and a PhD in 1963 from Cornell in animal science and physiology, topped off by a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard. A job in NYC beckoned as a research associate at the Institute for Steroid Research. At the end of the ’60s he began his career in academia as an assistant professor at the University of Illinois, Chicago, quickly followed by a promotion to associate professor. In September 1979 he became a full professor at the Northwestern University School of Medicine, Department of Obstetrics & Gynecology. His research interests were in breast cancer and other endocrine-related tumors. Also, he had an interest in investigating stress as it affects the endocrine systems. Robert is cited as an author in a multitude of publications related to his research. He says he has been retired since 2018, yet still tutors small groups of medical students in basic medical sciences at Northwestern.\n\nBill Seymour reports his total laid-back enjoyment of his retirement. His post-graduate degree was an MBA from Harvard. His career was in the financial side of the travel industry and took him from marketing for United Airlines to Budget Rent-A-Car to CitiGroup-Diner’s Club. Eventually he was responsible for card acceptance and marketing programs, including lodging and rental cars, at all U.S. airlines. After retiring from this, he was asked to be staff support for the nonprofit Hospitality Technology Next Generation. Bill treasures his time singing second bass in the men’s Glee Club and being a member of the Savage Club. Because he was a fifth-year engineer in ME, he experienced the transition from longtime director Tom Tracy to Tom Sokol’s first of many years as director.\n\nJust a note that the Class of 1957 has a unique relationship with the men’s Glee Club, the oldest student organization at Cornell. Our late class president Charles Stanton had also been the treasurer of the Glee Club. In 1988 he initiated the publication of a new version of the Songs of Cornell songbook. The publication was underwritten by our class. Some of you must remember how we sang from it at our class Reunions. At our class annual meeting in 2014, Marj Nelson Smart brought the request from the Glee Club that we fund the publication of the CD of the “Songs of Cornell.” The Glee Club, the women’s Chorus, and the Cornell Symphony Orchestra were in the process of recording 14 of our beloved Cornell songs. With the class council’s approval, $20,000 was donated for the completion of the recording. We were very proud to give the CD as a souvenir at our 60th Reunion in 2017. ❖ Connie Santagato Hosterman (email Connie) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1958\n\nWe have notes from several ’58ers to share this round. Karen Shannon Tafuri and Bill ’59 write, “We both have been retired since we were about 70 and have been traveling from our home in Framingham, MA, spending time with our two daughters, and enjoying our friends at local clubs.” Sonja Kischner Wilkin remains active with her Chi Gamma sorority sisters and was a significant presence in the forum related to that sorority at Reunion last June, as reported by Barb Avery, MA ’59. Sonja says she is also involved in her Clayton Valley Village community in Clayton, CA, her biking club, women’s chorale, and socializing with many friends and family, especially her recently married granddaughter. Saul Presberg and his wife, Helen (Sugarman) ’59, still reside in Rochester and most enjoy gatherings with people and watching their grandchildren grow. Saul recalls his favorite times at Cornell were with his brothers at Watermargin.\n\nLew Futterman writes from Marina Del Ray, CA, where he lives with his wife, Starla Caldwell. He says, “I work, building small residential projects, work out, bicycle, watch sports, and hang out with my wife and family. I got pretty sick last summer, for the first time in my life, but have now fully recovered. My youngest daughter, Kale, has become a successful screen and TV writer and was on the picket line.” Lew adds that his favorite memories at Cornell were “the comradery in football and track and making friends from all over the world.” Bob Mayer, still in Linwood, NJ, says that he has similar fond Cornell memories of time spent with friends on the Hill. “I am glad to be upright and shooting my age in golf, while gardening a bit with nine vegetables and 12 herbs and having great meals with even better wine.” Bob and his wife, Susan, are celebrating 60 years together. “We give some time to charity work, but are slowing down, and also spend four months a year in Florida.” His final word: “Don’t buy wine that needs aging.”\n\nKathryn Starr McCulloch wrote that she has a new address in Harleysville, PA, a suburban town near Philadelphia. Further south, in Southern Pines, NC, Dorinda Larkin McNamara lives in a senior independent residence, Belle Meade, and says she would love to hear from classmates.\n\nAnd that’s all the news in hand at this writing. Please send in your news and we’ll get it out to your classmates online, now that the hard copy issuance of the Cornellians digest has ended. Cheers for now. ❖ Dick Haggard (email Dick) | Barbara Avery, MA ’59 (email Barbara) |Alumni Directory.\n\n1959\n\n“I’m thrilled that our class correspondent and I have snagged a room at the Statler Hotel for June’s Reunion,” writes Carole Parnes. “Sure looking forward to being on campus and chatting with classmates.” This will be Carole’s first trip of the year, a big change from 2023 when she wandered a good part of the globe, trying to catch up on travels postponed due to the COVID pandemic.\n\nCarole writes, “Early March saw four back-to-back cruises to cover various Caribbean Islands hitherto unvisited. Unfortunately, COVID caught my partner and me in the middle of the third voyage, so the fourth was canceled as we recuperated in a Florida hotel until it was safe to return home. By mid-April it was off to Europe: a 15-day tour of Sicily, then San Marino, Switzerland (mountains, valleys, lakes, chocolate, and cheese), and a slow boat from Venice to Barcelona. In early July, we flew to London for a month-long sail to Iceland, Greenland, and Scandinavian countries. Our last splurge of the year was to Asia—a cruise along the coasts of Japan followed by a flight from Tokyo to Hanoi to explore Vietnam and Cambodia, floating down the Mekong River, then visiting fish farms and temples and huge markets selling items that Americans can hardly imagine.” End of year thoughts? “It was all fabulous (except for that bout with COVID), but other than visiting the East Coast in June, the need for travel has left me for the time being!”\n\n“I’ve booked my room at the Statler, too,” comments Al Newhouse. His most recent Cornell-affiliated adventure was last autumn’s trans-Canada trip sponsored by Cornell Alumni Travel. “A brilliantly organized tour with a very knowledgeable guide,” says Al. “We traveled on VIA—the Canadian equivalent of Amtrak—living in the last three cars on the long train. We had our own sleeper rooms and our own observation car, a double-decker car used for lectures, drinks, naps, and swapping stories about our days on the Hill. We stopped at some small towns and ‘big’ cities, passed lots of grain elevators, came down mountain valleys, crossed numerous rivers, and learned a lot about the flora, fauna, and history of the land. A nice way to spend a week in October.”\n\nReunion chair Jerry Schultz is doing a great job prepping for our 65th, arranging events, choosing meal caterers and locations, holding Zoom meetings with other class officers, and sending out emails to all classmates. He notes that an added pleasure of (finally!) having the Statler as our Reunion base is the chance to interact with the older classes that are also staying there. “Talking with folks celebrating their 70th and 75th reunions was one of my favorite pastimes at last year’s Reunion,” he says.\n\nIn Seneca Falls, we stayed in a B&B and slept in the same bed as Aretha Franklin did when she was in town to be inducted into the Hall of Fame.\n\nCarole Kenyon ’59\n\nCarole Kenyon, who has also booked a room for Reunion, was on campus to visit with grandsons Sam Fulmer ’25 and Chad Popik (PhD grad student in astrophysics). She reminds Reunion attendees who plan to spend extra days in Upstate New York that there’s lots to do in the area—wine tasting all ’round the lakes, museums in Auburn, the National Women’s Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls (“we stayed in a B&B and slept in the same bed as Aretha Franklin did when she was in town to be inducted into the Hall of Fame”). Carole, a graduate of Rutgers Law, is still doing some legal work with her husband, Ralph Kline. “Interesting what has walked in the door, including a case involving the rather notorious Menendez brothers. Yes, the usual wills, estates, trusts, and real property matters, with hopes to soon wind up a long-lasting will probate (more than eight years).”\n\n“A delightful little book.” “Super read.” “The author’s love of the circus and joy in music is evident.” These readers (and your class correspondent) are delighted with The Amazing Adventures of Karnival Kat and Eight Musical Mice, a new book written and illustrated by artist George Ladas. The inspirational tale, geared toward parents and their children, follows the adventures of a skillful cat, who joins forces with eight mice to form a highly successful carnival act.\n\nHow many chemically lined paper cups do you use annually? How many are used at Kendal at Ithaca, the senior living community that is home to Hank Stark and several other classmates? “More than 45,000 in 2023,” says Hank, at the cost of tens of thousands of dollars. Hank, well known in Ithaca for his 600+ restaurant reviews published in the Ithaca Times and Ithaca Journal, has added a new writing gig to his repertoire: working with staff members, he’s been writing articles for the monthly Kendal newsletter on “Kups at Kendal” and other food and dining-related topics. Hank’s articles on grains are coordinated with the Kendal chef, who features related meal items. For example, when the article on buckwheat was published, that month’s menus included a Mediterranean buckwheat salad and vegan buckwheat chocolate cookies. Yum! ❖ Jenny Tesar (email Jenny) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1960s\n\n1960\n\nWriting from Greensboro, NC, Barbara Baillet Moran shares, “What brings me the most satisfaction at this time of life is family, good health, friends, and the various kinds of writing I have been able to publish for the past 30 years. In retirement, I have published poems, essays, and three books, including Voices of the Silent Generation and Elvira: Behind the Curtain. I also made a lot of marmalade, having started a small business called MoranJam (my Home Economics degree at work). Jars were sold locally, and I have also given away hundreds of jars of cranberry marmalade. Having been involved with an international agency for 60 years, all my profits from books and MoranJam go to the support of children in the world’s poorest countries.”\n\nQueried about her favorite memory of Cornell, Barbara responded, “One that springs most often to mind is that of climbing out the window of the room I shared with Rosine Vance Turner and Barbara Thiessen MacMahon. A fire escape served as a balcony for studying on balmy spring days. The view from the fire escape was lovely, so we probably did more gazing and daydreaming than studying.” She also reports, “Two of our sons live in Aspen, CO, and our whole family enjoys the benefits of mountain living for weeks at a time. Our daughter and third son live in Washington and New York, so we enjoy frequent visits to those cities as well as other family travels in Europe and the U.S. Barbara MacMahon was not technically a family member, but we remained close friends for over 60 years. In November 2021, Barbara died peacefully at home in Portland, ME, where her four children expressed devotion to their amazing mother in a beautiful memorial service.”\n\nIn retirement, I have made a lot of marmalade, having started a small business called MoranJam (my Home Economics degree at work).\n\nBarbara Baillet Moran ’60\n\nOur class treasurer, Susan Cowan Jakubiak, reports that she is still experiencing the loss of her husband, Henry, but says, “Luckily, I have family and friends here on Long Island. Now I am very active in several women’s groups and have continued traveling widely. I went to Croatia with a group on a yacht along the coastline. Later that year, I went to see the Palio horse race in Siena, Italy, this time along with a group that had access to a pre-race dinner, the trials, and the procession, along with the race itself, where I sat in a balcony above the crowds on the ground. And most recently I had a wonderful trip to Morocco. Life is good, though I notice that I am not as spry as I used to be.”\n\nI had a brief discussion the other day with Tom Dandridge, MBA ’62, who is still housed in Rockford, MI, but also—like so many of us who would prefer to spend some winter months each year on Sanibel Island—is hoping that the formerly splendid but now quite devastated island can be restored fully to its original condition. Tom keeps in touch with other classmates such as Jim Van Fleet and Roger Kaufman, often just by phone. He says, “We are all fortunate to still be here. My wife, Lynn, has some health challenges, but she is as active as ever, almost. Last summer, for the first time, I ‘shot my age in golf’ and have also been awarded Life Master in duplicate bridge.” Tom reports that he has now found a rentable room at a Sanibel hotel and again looks forward to visiting this very special island. Many of our classmates would undoubtedly agree. ❖ Judy Bryant Wittenberg (email Judy) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1961\n\n“Cornell’s Department of Athletics and Physical Education has announced plans to build an indoor sports and recreation facility on Tower Road. The facility will be called Meinig Fieldhouse, in memory of former Board of Trustees chair and university benefactor Peter Meinig ’61.” This announcement is wonderful news for all of us. Pete was tireless in the giving of his time, his assets, and, above all, his leadership. Along with his wife, Nancy (Schlegel) ’62, they set a standard for all alums.\n\nMany notes have come from all of you. I will start with Nancy Paull McKeever, who is active in the Unitarian Universalist Congregation in Westport, CT, and is president of her condominium board. “I have great memories of Cornell, especially the Clinton Rossiter ’39 course in the American presidency. I’m still active in hiking, kayaking, and travel and spend time with close friends.” Barbara Hasenzahl Eckelmeyer wrote from Skillman, NJ: “I’m enjoying life with my family, not working, and our retirement community.” Dee Palmer Kaplan, MEd ’62, from Shrewsbury, NJ, writes, “I recently moved to an assisted living home and enjoy the new activities while I am able to visit with nearby family. Finally sold the big home. I have fond memories of the music room at Straight Hall and some fine Spring Weekends.” Joel Blatt reports he is still living in NYC. “My work continues as a professor of history at the Stamford campus of the University of Connecticut. I have fond memories of my Cornell classes with Edward Whiting Fox and Walter LaFeber.”\n\nGerald Schneider recently published A Practical Guide to Progressive Values: Libertarian Solutions. Released by Page Publishing, this book “suggests realistic and ethical solutions to many world problems that invite dialogue. It bridges the gap between progressives and conservatives in a divided America. Readers will find it original, thoughtful, lucid, concise, and reasoned, as well as provocative.” The book includes ironic and humorous quotes that keep readers turning pages.\n\nAnother classmate with a new book is Edward Goldberg. “With the arrival of COVID, and resulting quarantine and isolation, I had time to write the book that had been percolating in my mind. I combined my love of American history and my 30 years spent as a primary care physician. The result was Presidential Health Matters, published by Konstellation Press and available on Amazon. The book relates how medical history and politics have been intertwined over the years. There are presidents who contributed to medical advances—e.g., FDR and the March of Dimes. Some presidents used their knowledge of medicine to further their politics—e.g., Teddy Roosevelt, yellow fever, and the Panama Canal. Some presidents were overcome by medical events—e.g., Wilson and the 1918 influenza. My Cornell teachers were a great source of inspiration for me. Thank you, Andrew Hacker, Walter LaFeber, and Clinton Rossiter. Hopefully, I will be worthy of your input.”\n\nOne of my favorite memories of Cornell in 1961 is seeing my first play produced there as winner of the Heermans-McCalmon Competition for Dramatic Writing.\n\nJoanne Schapiro Koch ’61\n\nJim Keenan wrote from his home in Reno, NV. “My favorite memories of Cornell involve managing all the food stands at home football games throughout the stadium. Now I am retired, cooking my own meals. I am a 100% disabled Vietnam veteran, which limits my activities—but then so does my age!” Gail Kweller Ripans commented, “I am very saddened to hear of the death of Carol Gittlin Franklin. Our senior-year boyfriends lived together so we got to spend a lot of time together. Carol was beautiful and talented and generous. We are fortunate she led our class. She will be missed.”\n\nAnd we received a lengthy note from Marlene Alpert Tein: “It was rough last year. My husband of almost 57 years passed away in March 2022. I sold the house in Boca Raton and moved to an independent living facility in Kendall, FL. I am now closer to our children: son Michael and daughter Naomi ’90. Big changes in lifestyle, but I’m getting used to it and doing okay. While living in Boca Raton, I was able to get together with Dale Abrams Adams every week. We do so now by FaceTime. I live in the Palace Suites in Kendall and it is like being on a cruise ship with lots to do, good food, nice people, etc. (but the ‘ship’ doesn’t sail!). It has been a year of adaption, but with the help of family and friends I made it.”\n\n“I am now professor emerita,” writes Joanne Schapiro Koch. “I served as professor and director of the master’s in written communication program at National Louis University in Chicago for 22 years. Children, grandchildren, and playwriting are bringing me the most satisfaction in my retirement. I’ve had two staged readings of the new play Good Trouble at the City Lit Theater in Chicago and continue to work on the play about unsung civil rights champion and Presidential Medal of Freedom winner Fred Gray. The musical American Klezmer will have a pre-New York presentation in L.A. I’m also looking forward to a production of Belle Barth Musical, for which I wrote the book; Grammy nominee Ilya Levinson wrote the music and Owen Kalt wrote the lyrics. The show had its premiere at the Landmark On Main Street theater in Port Washington, NY, to raves and will be touring this season. Finally, one of my favorite memories of Cornell in 1961 is seeing my first play produced there as winner of the Heermans-McCalmon Competition for Dramatic Writing. I’ve written and seen produced 18 plays and musicals since then, but nothing was quite as thrilling as having noted New York producer Norris Houghton comment after my Family Dinner that he expected to see ‘more wonderful plays from Joanne Schapiro in the future.’”\n\nI’ll end this column with a tribute to our longtime class officer and Reunion chair Pauline Sutta Degenfelder. Pauline passed away November 16 following a lengthy illness. Our sympathies go to her family and her husband, Joe ’60.\n\nPlease keep your news flowing to us. ❖ Doug Fuss (email Doug) | Susan Williams Stevens (email Susan) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1962\n\nThis Class Notes column that you are now reading was written in mid-December. Column deadlines for Cornellians are two months ahead of the publication date and two months after the prior deadline. In translation, that means I wrote the January/February entries that you read in the last issue in October, and this spring column was written just before Christmas. However, everything I receive from you (including photos) is posted virtually instantly on our class website, so be sure to check it out and bookmark that page!\n\nPresumably many of you were caught up in your holiday and winter activities last December, which accounts for the lack of news I have on hand as I write. I hope that by the time you read this, you will have some time to share all those goings on. Right? Right!\n\nThat said, we do have one bit of news to share. Neil Schilke, MS ’64, and Frank Quirk and their wives, Ro and Betty, were in France last fall where they visited Paris and took a memorable river boat cruise that started in Bordeaux and included miles of vineyards and other sights in that region. Neil writes that he was particularly awestruck by the Bassins des Lumières, a huge, digital art center located in a former WWII submarine maintenance facility near the coast of Bordeaux.\n\nWhile on the topic of art, you might like to know that photographs from the class collection at the Johnson Museum of Art are being put to good use—not just on exhibit but in teaching for a variety of classes such as “Intro to Judaism,” “Surrealism and Apocalypse,” and “Spanish for Heritage Speakers.” In the fall semester, for example, Bruce Davidson’s Time of Change, Selma, Alabama, 1965 was installed in the Sukenik Teaching Gallery as part of an installation put up concurrently with the Cornell Fashion + Textile Collection exhibition “Fashioning the Bounds of Free Speech.” And, last spring, Olivia Parker’s Still Life was used for the class “Monuments, Museums, and Memory: Introduction to Public History,” and Foto Ada’s Untitled halftone collage was used in two classes: “Negrismo, Négritude, and Surrealism in the Caribbean” and “Empire and Vampires.”\n\nThe 37 outstanding images in the class collection were purchased through your gifts to the Class of 1962 Gift Fund. According to Annie Abernathy, curatorial assistant at the Johnson Museum, our “continued support and generosity makes such an impact here, as you can tell just from this handful of examples.” Consider making a gift to the Class Gift Fund when you pay your dues or at any time.\n\nHope to hear from you soon. Have a lovely spring. ❖ Judy Prenske Rich (email Judy) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1963\n\n“Hello from your class president, Paula Trested Laholt. I sincerely hope all our classmates and their families had celebratory and joyous holidays, despite the increasing negativism and sadness in the world. The class council and I wish you a productive year of personal and professional accomplishments. Keep Cornell and our special 1963 class in mind as we continue to look ahead while enjoying memories of the past.”\n\nMarty, BEE ’65, and Dianne Flannery Lustig ’66 returned from a three-week visit to Paris, Naples, Assisi, Venice, and Milan. The trip was organized and paid for (!) by their son and daughter-in-law. “David and Stacey handled all the flights and logistics, carried all the suitcases onto and off of trains, and planned every detail. While in Assisi, we got to try out Italian emergency medicine, as Dianne fell down some stone steps in a beautiful old home in the ancient hill town. (She is ok!) We’ve always wondered what would happen if we had a bad accident while out of the country. Turns out it was not much different than had it been here in Kansas City, other than calling 112 instead of 911. Emergency technicians were great. The ambulance made it up tiny streets in Assisi, and they immediately did CT scans, etc., plus she spent a few nights for observation. Medical care was what one would expect here, except the hospital didn’t want insurance info—only our home address. We’re still waiting for a bill! Unrelated to the trip, we are starting to research our ‘next place to live’ when we can no longer stay in our home, if that time comes. I would like to hear from any classmates who have made the change from having a home to moving into ‘senior living’ to discuss lessons learned.”\n\nFrom Phil Newfield: “My wife, Nancy (Guttman) ’65, and I, along with Michael and Marilyn Ratner, just came back from our first CAU trip focused on D-Day. Wonderful professor, fascinating sights and museums, and a very nice group of Cornellians. We live in Rockland County, NY, where I practiced pediatrics for 44 years, and we have three children (two Cornellians) and five grandchildren, including Olivia Newfield ’26, our first fourth-generation Cornellian. We’ve loved visiting her on campus. We’ve had a home in the Berkshires since 2000 and enjoy evenings at Tanglewood and spending time there with other Cornellians, the Ratners, Michael, ME ’65, and Joan Simonson Ury ’65, Zach and Laura Fluhr, and Marty and Hilda Lichtenstein Levine ’66.\n\nMy wife and I just came back from our first CAU trip focused on D-Day. Wonderful professor, fascinating sights and museums, and a very nice group of Cornellians.\n\nPhil Newfield ’63\n\nJohn, MBA ’65, and CeCe Kennedy live in Apex, NC. John writes: “I believe I am the quintessential lucky Irishman. In addition to earning two degrees from Cornell, which led to good jobs, I had a wonderful and fruitful marriage to Marylou, mother of our nine children, who sadly died in 2007. I am proud to say all of my children are college graduates, with the predominant university being the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Two grandchildren attend UM today. In 2014 I married CeCe, and I have been blessed again. We split our time between our home in North Carolina and a second home in the Sarasota area of Florida and are fortunate to have a very active life together. I stay in touch with fellow Cornell FiJis Dave Costine, Blair Crum, Fred Gaston, Whip Gunn, and Punch Smith. I am a lucky Cornell grad!\n\nThe very sad news that I have is that our friend and classmate Neil Kochenour, MD ’69, passed away last month. He was in the hospital for over a week, though most of the time he wasn’t alert as to what was going on. Jim Dauber, MD ’69, classmate and doctor, visited Neil on a regular basis and kept his family and multitude of friends informed of what was happening. Neil was at our Reunion in June, so many of you saw him there. A very bright man and always full of interesting stories. Luckily we spent time with him through these last 17 years, since he has also lived in Tucson.\n\nPlease send your news. ❖ Nancy Bierds Icke (email Nancy) | 12350 E. Roger Rd., Tucson, AZ 85749 | Alumni Directory.\n\n1964\n\nIt’s almost springtime! That said, the prevalent weather where you’re located might be anything but spring-like, given weather peculiarities. So instead of dwelling on those peculiarities, read what your classmates are up to, then make plans for our 60th Reunion.\n\nWe begin with a first-timer to this column: Denis Knowles, who lives in the Bahamas. “I have a large collection of native trees and orchids, a vegetable garden, and a large fish pond. I’ve spent my lifetime collecting Bahamian butterflies.” Denis otherwise notes, “I’m fussing with wife Violet still after 64 years! Caring for five dogs, 10 laying hens, and 100 homing pigeons, plus a fish pond full of koi.”\n\nWilliam “Hank” Ritchie has been retired for the last 28 years and still lives with wife Pamela in South Orleans, MA, where he says he’s an “avid gardener with seven 40-foot raised beds for mostly vegetables and some flowers.” The Ritchies’ last, pre-COVID trip was to Russia, where they went from Moscow to St. Petersburg via the Volga River. The Ritchies have two sons and four grandchildren.\n\nAnita Apeseche Heller lives in Yonkers, NY, and writes, “For the past decade and a half, I’ve been spending winters in Florida, at our house in Lake Worth with my significant other and two dogs. I spent the year writing a memoir from weekly questions sent by my daughter-in-law. Friends find some of the essays helpful in understanding themselves.” Anita has taken up pickleball, which she finds to be “new and lots of fun.” She also still plays tennis and swims, “especially in Florida’s ocean,” plus rides her bicycle a lot, which is “very easy because it’s so flat where I live, not like Westchester.” Anita’s last “big trip” was on an African safari with classmate Barbara Lutz Brim. She’s also gotten through health issues, lymphoma and a brain tumor, and is “now healthy and going on a Viking cruise to Alaska.” About the cruise, she notes, “We will see how it compares to my Antarctic trip in 2005.” She also has two grandchildren, the older of whom, Kaitlyn, 6, will be in her school’s audience when Anita gives a talk about growing up in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nThat’s all for classmate news for this issue. Let’s now see what’s in store for our 60th Reunion, June 6–9, from our Reunion chairperson, Carolyn Stewart Whitman.\n\nI’ve spent my lifetime collecting Bahamian butterflies.\n\nDenis Knowles ’64\n\nOn Thursday, June 6, check-in begins at Barbara McClintock Hall, a new contemporary and spacious residence hall on North Campus, where you will enjoy air conditioning and private parking close by. Catch up with classmates and relax after a long day of travel at our dinner at Appel Commons, just a stone’s throw away from our headquarters. Enjoy a casual buffet—including a make-your-own sundae station with famous Cornell Dairy Bar ice cream.\n\nClass activities will allow for many opportunities to simply relax and interact with friends, old and new. For example, the breakfast every morning in the dorm is not only delicious but provides a casual setting to socialize with fellow classmates and guests. When not attending a scheduled campus event, enjoy time relaxing in the McClintock common area working on a 1,000-piece puzzle designed by classmates Bob, PhD ’69, and Alice Dannett Friedenson, MA ’71. It features photos taken at previous Reunions, as well as photos of iconic campus buildings.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, attend a special presentation on the history and future of the JFK Memorial Award for Public Service. Our class founded this award and has funded it since graduation! Past recipients and members of the Class of 1964 JFK board will take part. The new board was formed this past year to ensure that the Class of 1964’s simple idea thrives in perpetuity.\n\nLook forward to a Saturday reception and dinner at the Statler Hotel, including a special performance by the Sherwoods. (It wouldn’t be a ’64 Reunion without them!) Other Reunion favorites will include a conversation with President Martha Pollack, Cornelliana Night, the Olin Lecture, and the Chorus and Glee Club concert. And don’t forget that every Reunion day will begin with breakfast in whatever dorm you are in.\n\nThat’s it for now. On behalf of our class officers, we hope to see you at our 60th Reunion on Cornell’s campus on June 6–9, 2024. As for your news, please keep it coming!

Please mark the date on your calendar!\n\nJudy Kellner Rushmore is again gathering those who live in Florida or who are there for the season for the annual luncheon at Seasons 52 in Naples, FL. We always have a wonderful time and please email Judy if you’ve never been and want to join us!\n\nOn November 3, 2023, Alan Lockwood, MD ’69, was presented an award for lifetime achievement, from Physicians for Social Responsibility. His recent educational efforts have focused on the adverse health effects of the climate emergency. His book, Heat Advisory: Protecting Health on a Warming Planet, published by MIT Press, came out in 2017.\n\nOne of our treasured classmates, Sharon Hegarty Williams, died after a long illness in December. She was a wonderful friend and we “go back” many years, having met at a Cornell Reunion co-chairing the welcome desk with Bob Kessler. She is remembered as a wonderful, intelligent, and caring person. We cruised together, traveled to Cornell and back, and visited together in our homes in Massachusetts and Florida and her home in East Greenwich, RI, and shared a fun week at her daughter Kristin and husband’s home in Westerly, RI. At Cornell Class Council meetings (she was co-president with Barry Cutler and also treasurer in recent years) and at the Cornell Alumni Leadership Conference (CALC) everyone appreciated her insightful commentary and wisdom. Classmates applauded her initiative, leadership, and follow-through on our Reunion gift projects and everything Cornell. Events in Boston and Sarasota were filled with joyful smiles and laughter. Sharon graduated magna cum laude in sociology, captained the women’s sailing team, and was a passionate alumna and president of the Philly Cornell Club when she lived in Pennsylvania. I will miss her and carry memories of her indomitable spirit.\n\nMany of us in the class council are attending CALC 2024 in Baltimore, MD, February 23–25. This is always a fine event and I’ll report news from the conference in a later column. ❖ Joan Hens Johnson (email Joan) | Stephen Appell (email Stephen) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1966\n\nBob Feldman, PhD ’75, enjoyed reading the latest ’66 Connecting newsletter. “A special smile came on my face when I read this comment: ‘The good thing! The Chimes are still the Chimes.’ We all miss the Chimes (well, technically, it’s a chime), but for those alumni like me who played the bells, there’s a special longing. I missed the annual chimesmasters reunion in 2023, but I hope to get back to campus in 2024 to climb the 161 steps and play the bells again. Meanwhile, I am satisfying my bell addiction by playing two chimes in church towers near my home in Framingham, MA—one in Newton, one in Lowell. I play some Sunday mornings and on special occasions, such as Christmas, Easter, and St. Patrick’s Day, and have organized a series of summer evening concerts. Several alumni chimesmasters join me in playing these chimes, and a few alumni have been in the audiences. We have been able to adapt many pieces from Cornell (21 bells) to fit on these chimes (11 bells), including the ‘Alma Mater,’ ‘Evening Song,’ and ‘Jennie McGraw Rag.’ So, if you’re in the Boston area, let me know; I’d love to serenade you from a bell tower. I am retired. When not bell ringing, I volunteer in various organizations, including the Cornell Club of Boston. I sing in the Wellesley Choral Society. I am lucky to have my daughter’s family nearby, including two grandsons, 6 and 10, on whom I dote.”\n\nNow for news from some of the ’66 class leadership team. VP Bruce Mansdorf emailed, “Rebecca and I took a trip to NYC from our L.A. home in late September to spend time with our London-based daughter, Lucy Mansdorf ’06, and her family while she attended her Cornell freshman roommate’s wedding. Most of our job was minding 3-year-old Penelope, showing her off to friends and family in New York. We had a great time rolling around the park, zoo, Met, and High Line, and eating well. A week later, I headed to Ithaca for the Trustee-Council Annual Meeting (TCAM), where I visited the young, quite successful, head lacrosse coach, Connor Buczek ’15, MBA ’17. I planned to reminisce and be sure he recognized that Cornell’s great lacrosse tradition began over 50 years ago with our 1966 team. I really didn’t have to say much, though, as he had a photo of our championship team prominently displayed at the entrance to the lacrosse offices. I was mighty pleased.”\n\nFrom VP membership Judy Kurtz Polcer: “In October I attended my first TCAM event at Cornell. This was quite special because I spent several days in person with some fellow class officers whom I had only met via Zoom—Bill Maxfield, Bruce Mansdorf, and Ralph Janis. I reconnected with Mary Jansen Everett, Ivan Wolff, Jeanne Brown Sander, and Alice Katz Berglas. We sorely missed our class presidents, John Monroe, PhD ’70, and Rolf Frantz, ME ’67. Instead of the formal kickoff to TCAM, Class of ’66 attendees had a memorable, casual dinner and really got to know each other. I felt quite lucky to spend time with this interesting, unique group of Cornellians.”\n\nIf you’re in the Boston area, let me know; I’d love to serenade you from a bell tower.\n\nBob Feldman ’66, PhD ’75\n\nMy wife Ruth Dritch Salinger ’67 and I (Pete Salinger, MBA ’68) recently had dinner with Darry and Susie Pressman Sragow ’67 at their home in Los Angeles. 2023 was a significant year for Darry—he retired from Dentons law firm, where he served as the Los Angeles office managing partner; he also retired after working for 23 years as an adjunct assistant professor of political science, first at Berkeley and more recently at USC. Darry and I attended Naval Officer Candidate School at the same time and were both assigned to positions in Washington, DC. The four of us have remained in touch all these years. Darry spent much of his earlier career in politics, working in the U.S. Senate and managing high profile campaigns in California and elsewhere. Susie recently retired as a licensed social work consultant to skilled nursing facilities and was an adjunct professor in the MSW program at Cal State University Long Beach. Their daughter, Lara ’95, is a Cornellian.\n\nWe heard news recently of classmates who have passed away. Jonathan Dolgen died in Encino, CA, on October 9, 2023; Jon was an entertainment industry executive and pioneer in cable television. He was a veteran, philanthropist, and member of numerous business, education, and nonprofit boards. He was active in community, humanitarian, and alumni affairs. At Cornell, he was in Alpha Epsilon Pi. Jon is survived by his wife, Susan, daughters Tamar ’93 and Lauren, and three grandchildren. An ILR building was renamed Dolgen Hall in his honor in 2008. Jon’s words then: “It hadn’t occurred to me, before I went to Cornell, that everything is possible. If I could compete and thrive here, I would be able to compete and thrive anywhere.”\n\nGary Crahan, ME ’67, and John Monroe sent a note that Phi Psi brother Nick Zettlemoyer passed away last fall after a short battle with cancer. Nick and his wife, Jan, lived in the Woodlands, TX, where they raised sons John and Luke. Nick received an MS in architectural engineering at Penn State University in 1969, served in the Civil Engineer Corps of the Navy, then earned a PhD at Lehigh University in 1976. Nick worked at ExxonMobil in Houston for more than 30 years, working on the design, repair, and strengthening of offshore platforms. Phi Psi Bill Maxfield, a fellow civil engineer, sent this warm memory: “Nick and I would be in the same afternoon labs. I would often fall asleep during the lecture but would have studied the lab procedure the night before. I would do most of the lab setup; Nick would take all the data points and notes. Then, we would share the data for the reports required for the next lab. Both of us supported the other.”\n\nStay in touch. Send dues—and your news! Everyone wants to know what you’ve been up to.

The prisoners need support in applying for parole and clemency. When I was chair of the Air Force Clemency and Parole Board, I rewrote and revised the Department of Defense regulations for these matters. Hopefully, that knowledge has helped me to assist them.”\n\nAs for what else has been happening in his life, he says, “Lots of surgeries to mend injuries incurred while on active duty with the Air Force.” What brings him satisfaction? “Travel, reading, and friends. A lot of our planned travel was canceled by world events. COVID canceled a trip to the Antarctic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine canceled a Baltic cruise, and our Israel tour at the end of 2023 was canceled too. Fortunately, the year before the pandemic, my wife, Peggy, and I cruised the Southern Hemisphere for four months, beginning in Miami, traveling south around Cape Horn, and then west around the world. Viking’s hospitality for four months provided us a lifestyle to which we could be accustomed … for a lifetime.”\n\nToby Tucker Hecht (Bethesda, MD) reports: “For almost 45 years, I have been working at the National Institutes of Health and am happy to keep working at 76. I am now the deputy director of the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis at the National Cancer Institute. One of the projects I enjoy most is the clinical study of pet dogs with spontaneously derived tumors as models for human cancer. We have worked with staff at the Cornell Vet college in the past, as well as other veterinarian medical schools, to conduct clinical trials of these canine patients.”\n\nFor almost 45 years, I have been working at the National Institutes of Health and am happy to keep working at 76.\n\nToby Tucker Hecht ’67\n\nDoug Shore (Atlanta, GA) writes: “Just returned from Entrepreneurship at Cornell’s Eclectic Convergence conference at Cornell Tech November 3: fireside chats with six alumni entrepreneurs, pitches from five startups at Cornell Tech, and 26 pitches from Cornell eLab startups down from Ithaca. Plus, networking with members of the Cornell and NYC entrepreneurship ecosystems and two busloads of undergraduates coming from Ithaca for the day. Congratulations to Zach Shulman ’87, JD ’90, director of EaC, and his team for an inspirational event. If you are interested in entrepreneurship, I recommend getting involved with EaC.”\n\nSharon Argus Paschos (Dortmund, Germany) thanks a classmate: “Just have to report about the gracious hospitality of my sophomore/senior roommate Rita Ratner Levin and hubby Chuck during my visit to Santa Fe in October. I felt like a member of the family and truly enjoyed every minute. Santa Fe is a lovely artsy town, and I was treated to visits to art studios and museums and enjoyed seeing the annular solar eclipse from their balcony in the hills over Santa Fe. Another highlight was a visit to the Los Alamos National Lab, a real tourist attraction since the Oppenheimer film. A great wrap-up to the visit was a day at the Ojo Caliente Spa near Santa Fe. Closer to home, my husband, Manny, PhD ’67, has been retired from his professorship at the Technical University of Dortmund for several years, leaving free time to spend with our three children and five grandkids who are spread out from Southern Germany to Italy and Greece.”\n\nWe—my wife, Eileen Barkas Hoffman ’69, daughter Vanessa Hoffman ’07, grandsons Ethan and Alex, and I—spent a wonderful Thanksgiving in the North Country of New York State outside Saratoga Springs with my son-in-law Dave Weiner’s family in Charlton. Our hosts were Keith Payton, DVM ’88, and Stephanie Todd ’83, DVM ’87 (whose veterinary practice, Harmony Veterinary Clinic, is in Ballston Spa, NY), son Erik ’25, and daughter Katrina ’27, as well as “Friday chef” Ben Weiner ’88, based in Ithaca. ❖ Richard Hoffman (email Richard) | 2925 28th St. NW, Washington, DC 20008 | Alumni Directory.\n\n1968\n\nAs we look forward to the spring and warmer weather, we have news to share from our classmates! Post-COVID, Alan Altschuler has renewed his acting career! He recently performed in the Bedlam Theatre Company’s Off-Broadway production of Tom Stoppard’s Arcadia, which ran from October 27 to January 7 in Manhattan. In 2019, prior to COVID, among other performances, Alan played the role of Francis Nurse in Bedlam’s Off-Broadway hit production of Arthur Miller’s The Crucible.\n\nClemont Austin reports that he and Penny (Smith) ’69 reside in Erie, PA, where Cle continues to run the family’s five-generation construction business! He now serves as chairman. Prior to that, Cle did graduate work at Stanford, where he received both MSCE and MBA degrees. He and Penny lived in the Palo Alto area from 1968–76. They have two children and six grandkids, but sadly their oldest son, Rob, died in March 2022. Cle received the Edward C. Doll Community Service Award in 2020 in recognition of his years of philanthropic volunteer work in their Erie community. His activities have included serving as a trustee of the Erie Community Foundation and as a board member of the United Way of Erie County and of the Erie-Western PA Port Authority. They are both grateful to Cornell for the education they received and lifelong friends they made on the Hill.\n\nOn a closing note, a reminder that your class officers are: Henry Siegel, president; Susan Mascette Brandt, VP and membership chair; Mary Hartman Schmidt, secretary; Beth Deabler Corwin, treasurer; Corinne Dopslaff Smith, website community manager; Jay Waks, JD ’71, Cornell Annual Fund representative; Nancy Nystrom Frantz, immediate past president; and, of course, me, your class correspondent, Steve Weinberg, MBA ’70, JD ’71. We are in the process of developing plans for our Class for 2024 and beyond. Your input for class activities is most welcome, so feel free to contact any of us with suggestions.\n\nI look forward to receiving news and updates from all of you! Please email me about you and your family with news you want to share with our classmates. ❖ Steve Weinberg, MBA ’70, JD ’71 (email Steve) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1969\n\nAs of this writing, the holiday season is in full swing. I was reflecting the other day that I always felt Thanksgiving was the best holiday as it was not about presents and commercialism; it was all about family, food, and football. How things have changed! Now it may be the most commercial, with Black Friday, Small Business Saturday, Cyber Monday, and on and on. Oh, for the good old days.\n\nSpeaking of the good old days, it’s almost time to revisit them, June 6–9, 2024, for our 55th Reunion and a chance to see old friends, make new ones, and tell tales of our exploits on the Hill; trudging through waist-deep snow to take a critical prelim, camping for days in sub-zero weather outside Lynah for hockey tickets, and rock sliding in the gorge in 34-degree water—in June. Time seems to enhance the details a little, but so what?\n\nPlease consider staying with us in the fantastic new North Campus at Morrison Hall. It will be the easiest way to connect with classmates and by far the most convenient, with regard to accessing events, etc. Our Reunion chairs, Cindy Nixon DuBose and Sally Knowlton, have a lot more information about the weekend that will be coming out shortly. On to the news!\n\nScott Abramson of San Mateo, CA, retired in 2020 after 40 years as a neurologist at Kaiser Permanente in the San Francisco Bay Area. He focused on teaching communication skills and last year Covenant Books published his book, Bedside Manners for Physicians and Everyone Else: What They Don’t Teach in Medical School or Any Other School.\n\nDavid Zimet of Boca Raton, FL, is enjoying grandchildren, travel, and riding his bike. He works several hours a week at his restaurant and volunteers/chairs at Oasis of Hope of Pompano Beach. He’s been enjoying an annual family gathering for Passover in Western Europe with grandchildren ranging from 28 years to 8 months! He remembers pinball at Noyes Lodge, the Chapter House, the Heidelberg, and the Royal Palms and walking the gorges.\n\nDon Verdiani, ME ’71, of Westtown, PA, has been volunteering, traveling, and having fun with grandkids and hobbies. He’s the president and an EMT with the Good Fellowship Ambulance Club and remembers “traying on Libe Slope” and Johnny’s Big Red Food Truck.\n\nPhilip Callahan ’69 and his wife, Judith, took the trip of a lifetime last February to Angkor Wat and the Taj Mahal, seeing tigers, the pyramids, and Petra.\n\nJudy Lyke Clarke of Milton, NY, has been transitioning the farm from wholesale production to “pick your own” and adding a distillery. She’s been promoting their town with an organization of farms and wineries but manages to spend two months in Pine Island, FL, in the winter. She remembers her friendships from Phillips Hall residence and acting as an RA in Dickson Hall.\n\nTimothy Jones, MPA ’71, reports moving from Virginia to West Jordan, UT, in order to be closer to his youngest son and three teenage grandsons.\n\nChuck Kluga of Chelmsford, MA, has been working on obtaining a private pilot’s license and playing pickleball with his wife when he’s not providing guidance in understanding Medicare choices as a SHINE counselor. He also is a member of the Saint Vincent DePaul Society, which provides counseling and short-term financial assistance to needy families. He remembers dance parties at Theta Chi and narrowly missing the light poles at the bottom of Libe Slope on a food tray.\n\nStephen Goldberger has a new significant other in Ellen Bloxsom and has added bridge and tennis to his repertoire, in addition to enjoying golf in Midlothian, VA.\n\nPhilip Callahan of Pasadena, CA, has been “semi-retired” from JPL for two and a half years and plans to really do it as of this spring, in order to be able to focus on security planning for his synagogue. (Have you noticed how many of us refuse to fully retire or do so only to start something else?) He and his wife, Judith, took the trip of a lifetime last February to Angkor Wat and the Taj Mahal, seeing tigers, the pyramids, and Petra. They then went to Israel for two weeks in June and will be heading to Barcelona and Northern Spain for another two weeks. Philip is amazed at the differences in his six grandchildren and enjoys that they are “turning into real people.” His favorite memory of his time at Cornell is the senior engineering physics lab.\n\nMy exploits will wait for someone else’s future column, but I will mention that I officiated at the AAU Junior National Volleyball Championships in Orlando, FL, last June, and seeing about 180 volleyball courts playing simultaneously in the Orange County Convention Center was quite a sight! Controlled chaos! ❖ Robert Tallo (email Robert) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1970s\n\n1970\n\nAs I wrote last time, it is always a challenge to find something broadly interesting with which to begin this column—but maybe not this time. I have mentioned before the uncovering of boxes from the past. Digging deeper into another one revealed several treasures such as various issues of the Cornell Daily Sun, the freshman class directory for ’70 and ’71, various programs for football and hockey games, a blank prelim booklet, and two “borrowed” (and unused) triangular ashtrays, one marked “BOXCAR” and the other “Warehouse.” You may remember that just beyond the intersection of Routes 13 and 366 there was a “hangout,” a bar if you will, in an actual boxcar that had been moved to there. Over time it grew, and was always (as long as it was open) a place to go if someone had a car. Things were different when we were at Cornell, as the New York State minimum drinking age was still 18. As is said (briefly) in an alumni version of the “Song of the Classes,” “But, oh, to be 20 and back at Cornell.”\n\nHaving moved along in our lives, classmate Howard Rosenof (Newton, MA) responded to my November/December column in which I asked engineering alumni whether they stayed in the field. He writes the following: “I did stay in engineering, and while from time to time I had other job functions like manager or director, I never got too far from technical issues. After military training and graduate school (MSEE, Northeastern) I focused on control systems (Professor Pottle would have been surprised), eventually specializing in applications of artificial intelligence in industry. While never an academic, I wrote and spoke extensively and taught several continuing education courses. In the late 1980s I co-authored a technical book, Batch Process Automation: Theory and Practice, and in the early 2000s received an international award in that field. Early on I developed an interest in career issues, and it continued through the decades. Once I retired, I had the time to consolidate my thoughts. This resulted in my second book, Engineering, Your Career, which I published in late 2022.”\n\nRobert Keller (Wilmette, IL) reports that this has been a year of 50th anniversaries for him and his wife, Elizabeth (Mt. Holyoke/Duke ’73). They celebrated Liz’s 50th college reunion at Mt. Holyoke in South Hadley, MA; Bob’s 50th from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law in May; and their golden wedding anniversary in August in Chicago. Their motto was “celebrate early and often” with trips to New England, the Canadian Maritime Provinces, the Southwest National Parks, the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs, and the American Club in Kohler, WI. One highlight of their trips was reconnecting in person with Liz’s close classmates, who she Zooms with weekly since COVID.\n\nWe live in our dream house on six sylvan acres of forest, wetlands, gardens, and a small orchard and think that this might be our last move—that is, unless we relocate to Ithaca.\n\nFred Chanania ’70\n\nNeal Weinstein (San Jose, CA) writes, “It’s been quite a while (decades actually) since I’ve shared any info for our Class Notes, though I’m a diligent reader of the Notes. To pick up where I left off … I’ve been in California since 1974 and in San Jose since 1976. Retirement came a bit early and now I’m 13-plus years into it and enjoying every minute! I probably spend more time on physical fitness than at any time in my life—and this is a good thing. Two adult children and four grandkids in different parts of the country keep us busy, in addition to travel, gardening, reading, theater, and the symphony. I’m a co-leader of a meetup group and lead about three hikes each week, generally in the Bay Area, but occasionally we travel for a week. Since retirement I’ve also been a consultant, mentor, and class instructor for SCORE Silicon Valley, helping small businesses, both for-profit and nonprofit, succeed. It’s exhilarating to work with people of all ages and learn about their businesses.”\n\nFred Chanania (West Newbury, MA) writes as follows: “Having retired in 2012 from teaching science to high school teenagers (the best job ever!) in the Northern Virginia area, my wife, Elisa, and I retired to West Newbury, a small semi-rural town of 4,000 on the North Shore of Massachusetts. We have only one stop light in town, which is activated only when a car pulls up to it. We live in our dream house on six sylvan acres of forest, wetlands, gardens, and a small orchard and think that this might be our last move—that is, unless we relocate to Ithaca. I have been busy starting a town tree committee, chairing the library board, and becoming a Massachusetts Certified Arborist. I also have to admit, a bit reluctantly, that I am teaching about oceans and forests at the Harvard (gasp!) Institute for Learning in Retirement and was recently named a distinguished member of HILR. Even so, my allegiance to the Big Red and CU remain paramount, and I take great pleasure in wearing Cornell hats and jackets when I am in Cambridge—just to tweak the Crimson crowd. My love of nature and teaching about it began at Cornell in the late ’60s in walks around Beebe Lake but was brought to fruition in the 1980s by Richard Fischer, PhD ’53, much-beloved professor of environmental education, during a Cornell’s Adult University summer course. I stay in touch with some fellow Cornellians from the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity, including Charlie Adelman, JD ’73, Arthur Litowitz, and Allan Reich (roomie), as well as Cornellians Kent Hewitt ’59, Ellen Glanz, Fred Davis ’62, and Harvey Makadon ’69, who are among the HILR crowd. Go Big Red!”\n\nAs always, you may contact me directly (see below) or you may use the University’s online news form. (Just a request for the future … If you mention other Cornellians by name in your note, and they are not 1970 classmates, it would help a lot if you listed their class after their name.) ❖ John Cecilia, MBA ’79 (email John) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1971\n\nRichard Immerman sent us this review of the conference honoring Walter LaFeber that was held in the fall on the Cornell Tech campus in NYC: “The entire conference was spectacular, from beginning to end. Including the contributors to Thinking Otherwise—the tribute volume to LaFeber—some 15 other alumni participated, and that excludes the dozens of others who attended the sessions (attendance altogether was 125–150) and expressed their warm appreciation for what they learned from Walt and how much they valued his humanity and humility. Remarkably, many commented that they still have their notes from decades ago, especially from his survey of the ‘History of U.S. Foreign Policy.’ Many remarked how they desperately wish that Walt could provide his insights and offer his wisdom with regard to the current crises in both domestic and international affairs. Walt’s identification of the ‘Tocqueville Problem’ was cited frequently as particularly applicable to today’s challenges to America’s ideals and institutions as well as its security.” In addition to Richard, Bob Hannigan, and Andrew Tisch (the participants in the conference from our class), attendees included classmates Dale Cohen, Martha Coultrap, and Mayo Stuntz.\n\nOn November 25, the Cornell men’s hockey team prevailed over Boston University, retaining the Kelly-Harkness Cup, as the Big Red scored its fourth consecutive victory over the BU Terriers in the biennial Red Hot Hockey game. The game was close until the third period, when Cornell asserted itself to pull the team into a hard-earned victory. Several classmates shared the excitement of the “edge-of-the-seat game” at NYC’s Madison Square Garden, with some attending a preparty at a nearby watering hole for the classes of the early 1970s. Attendees included Gilda Klein Linden (together with her son and grandson), Mitchell Weisberg (and wife Randi), Mike Kubin, Marty Michael, Fred Iskowitz, and James Pfeiffer (and wife Gay).\n\nPoet Lisa Malinowski Steinman, MFA ’73, PhD ’76, and her husband, poet Jim Shugrue, call Portland, OR, home. After graduating with our class, Lisa continued her studies in English at Cornell, earning both an MFA and a PhD. After graduation, she headed out to Reed College to become an English professor. In August 2022, after 46 years of teaching and “half a year of clearing from my office decades of saved books, papers, photos, letters, and such,” Lisa became a professor emerita. In addition to teaching, she has filled her life with writing, readings, and publishing. Together with her husband, Lisa cofounded and edited the literary magazine Hubbub. Lisa writes poems “to make sense of myself and the world.” To learn more about her poetry and career see “In the Presence of a Poet,” a 2014 article about her in the Reed College Magazine, or read and enjoy one of her several poetry collections. Now that her retirement has arrived, Lisa and Jim are looking forward to traveling—heading first on a return trip to Spain.\n\nTogether with her husband, Lisa Malinowski Steinman ’71, MFA ’73, PhD ’76, cofounded and edited the literary magazine Hubbub.\n\nRodo Sofranac and his wife, Susan, live in Phoenix, AZ. Rodo learned English as his third language after immigrating to the U.S. at age 8 from the communist dictatorship in the former Yugoslavia. Prior to retirement, Rodo had a varied work and philanthropic career serving as the first executive director of Phoenix Habitat for Humanity, and working as a banker, teacher, college instructor, program director for Arizona LeaderForce, Cub Master, and national chair of Workforce Development Councils. He is still in love, after 48 years, with Susan, a cognitive coach and reading specialist. Today, Rodo and Susan jointly write colorful, whimsical, and lesson-driven books for children from infancy to age 14. They spend their life frequenting schools to read their books to children. They use 100% of the profits from book sales to produce, purchase, and donate more books to schools, libraries, and nonprofit agencies working on literacy. So far, they have nine books published that help kids of all ages become better readers. See his website for more details.\n\nThe Class of 1971 History Project is continuing to develop during Zoom meetings held monthly. Fifteen classmates joined the November Zoom conversation centered on life during our junior year. The meeting focused on three topics: 1) the impact of the Draft Lottery on us 20-somethings, our career choices, and the continued repercussions of those decisions throughout our lives; 2) the Cambodian bombing in the spring of 1970, which led to a shortened semester and uncompleted exams and grades; and 3) the beginning of the feminist movement and the evolution of new roles for women. Please watch for notices of the next meeting and consider joining the conversation and bringing along friends. If you have not received notices of the meetings and are interested in joining, contact history chair Naomi Katz Mintz.\n\nA small gathering of classmates joined the excitement of Cornell Tech’s fall 2023 Open Studio event. Attendees saw presentations and demos of student startup ventures, providing a close-up view of real-world products being built by the Cornell Tech community. A special Class of 1971 gathering followed the event at the Anything At All Restaurant at the Graduate New York hotel adjacent to the Tech campus, where classmates welcomed the holiday season and raised a glass to Cornell (and each other!).\n\nPlease replenish our coffers with news—we are running low and would love to hear from you! ❖ Cara Nash Iason (email Cara) | Elisabeth Kaplan Boas (email Elisabeth) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1972\n\nFellow classmates, this is Wes Schulz, ME ’73, one of four class correspondents who produce this column. We appreciate your input.\n\nMany thanks to those who have contributed to the Class of 1972 50th Reunion Yearbook. The virtual yearbook has been a great success, with over 565 classmates entering pages. The album closed at the end of 2023 for additional entries; but it continues to be available online to those who have joined the book. It is a great source of updated information from our classmates about what they have been up to since graduation.\n\nA previous column mentioned the Adirondack 46ers club, which consists of those people who have climbed all the major peaks in the Adirondack Mountains. Gene Weber wrote that he was a member of this organization. During his Cornell years, he spent summers in Keene Valley, NY, which greatly facilitated hiking in the High Peaks area of New York State. He started climbing in 1971 and completed the last peak in 1977. Gene was assigned 46er member #1417. He now lives in San Francisco and has been there for 40 years. He is an avid outdoorsman and is passionate about fly fishing, which has taken him all over the world.\n\nI took a bit longer than Gene to complete my Adirondack 46er quest. I started in 1963 and did 85% of the peaks before graduating from Cornell. However, I did not finish until I was eligible for Medicare. I was assigned 46er member #9698, which shows how popular mountain climbing has become in the 40 years since Gene finished.\n\nI noted that some classmates, including Nancy Roistacher (our indefatigable class president), attended the Red Hot Hockey game between Cornell and Boston University at Madison Square Garden in New York City on Thanksgiving weekend. (The good guys won.) By the time you are reading this, the hockey playoffs will be starting. Hope that both the men’s team and the women’s team did well.\n\nThanks to everyone who has taken the time to write in. Please keep the news coming! ❖ Wes Schulz, ME ’73 (email Wes) | Susan Farber Straus (email Susan) | Frank Dawson (email Frank) | Alex Barna (email Alex) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1973\n\nDonald Partridge and wife Patricia continue to run the farm in Batavia, NY, milking the cows, making hay, selling sweet corn, feeding the pond fish, and occasionally catching them. And let’s not forget the sleepovers with the grandchildren. Each of their three kids has a boy and a girl. As a grandpa myself, who has trouble keeping up with just two, to host a sleepover AND milk the cows sounds like a full-time job all by itself.\n\nDonald’s favorite memories include Stan Warren 1927, PhD ’31’s last farm economics class and, of course, Marching Band. He references the Daily Sun’s legendary headline: “Cornell Marching Band Gets Censored.” Yup—I was there, too. With a clarinet in my hand, trying to look innocent.\n\nSusan Kennedy Cox lives in Faribault, MN, with husband Donald ’71 and is busy with grandkids, quilting, and a hyper-energetic puppy. I’m guessing most puppies in Faribault have to be hyper-energetic since it can get very cold there.\n\nGeorge Mitchell II lives in North Rose, NY, with wife Becky. He’s semi-retired but is still in the apple business and coaches track at the local high school.\n\nLeah Bissonette, MS ’76, is living in Encinitas, CA, where she works to preserve bird habitats and enjoys identifying and tracking birds all over the world. She has a cyber-powered bird-identifier called a Haikubox, which mounts outside and sends real-time alerts to your phone when it hears a bird call—an amped-up version of Cornell’s Merlin app (which I highly recommend). Her most recent travel destinations include Egypt, Paris, and Lake Como, and she’s planning a West Coast visit. Feel free to look us up in Seattle! With any luck we’ll still have a few spotted owls left when you get here (and they could use your help).\n\nDonald Partridge ’73 and wife Patricia continue to run the farm in Batavia, NY, milking the cows, making hay, selling sweet corn, and feeding the pond fish.\n\nJon Shure, although officially retired, still serves on the board of New Jersey Policy Perspective—a think tank he founded in 1997 after a career as a reporter, press secretary, and communications director for New Jersey Governor Jim Florio. He lives in Ewing, NJ, with wife Janice and stays busy as a freelance writer and editor for nonprofits.\n\nMona Deutsch Miller lives in Los Angeles with husband Steve and, having retired from her law practice, is pursuing her second career as a writer, including stage plays, screenplays, short stories, essays, and poetry. Her favorite Cornell memory is the natural beauty of the campus: “Once, I was walking across the Arts Quad at night and felt as if I was everywhere in the sky all at once—it was a beautiful experience. One of the students in my Russian poetry seminar said that was ‘oceanic feeling.’” I count 17 plays on her Alliance of Los Angeles Playwrights page. Looking for the one that ends with a quiet nighttime walk across the Quad.\n\nRich, MBA ’74, and Lynn Rosenbluth Saltz ’75 have great news. Their daughter, Marcy ’06, got married last fall to Andrew Ogulnick. Their wedding date happened to be Rich’s birthday as well—but he is glad to have it be Marcy and Andrew’s anniversary from now on! The newlyweds live in Sunnyside, NY. Rich and Lynn’s son, Ted ’12, got engaged in August 2023 to Aly Stein ’13; they live in Cambridge, MA.\n\nMy own news involves improv sessions with 3- and 5-year-old granddaughters (one here in the Seattle area, the other in Connecticut) and getting my wife to read books to me. I’m still hosting the morning news on KIRO-FM and writing daily commentaries, but retirement is looking more and more appealing, especially after hearing from so many blissfully retired classmates. Although, as my dad used to say, “They pay you to talk, son! Don’t be an idiot!” ❖ Dave Ross (email Dave) | Pam Meyers (email Pam) | Phyllis Haight Grummon (email Phyllis) | Alumni Directory.\n\n1974\n\nBefore you read on about classmates, double-check your calendars to be sure that our 50th Reunion, June 6–9, 2024, is highlighted and that your plans to attend have been made or are about to be made! This website has our 50th Reunion information, so please check it out!\n\nA wonderful Cornell story was sent in by classmate David Schiller of Westfield, IN. One of David’s favorite memories from his time at Cornell occurred during Professor L. Pearce Williams ’48, PhD ’52’s class. In front of the class, Professor Williams offered the following stern advice: “Nice essay, David. Too bad you had the wrong answer. I had to give you a D.” As David goes on to say, “That taught me one important lesson: get the correct answer!” I gather David has favorite memories of his senior-year class with Professor Michael Kammen too, but that story about Professor Williams is hard to beat! David is still working selling and leasing industrial and office real estate, as well as selling investment real estate in both Western New York and nationally. He gets a lot of satisfaction these days “helping my 95-year-‘young’ father, volunteering with my wife, Beverly, and having fun too!” He goes on to report, “Frequent flyer miles abound. We have children and grandchildren in Los Angeles, Indianapolis, and Jerusalem, Israel.”\n\nFrom Perry Jacobs, a delicious memory jogger about the Hot Truck, complete with a photo of a PMP! Take a look at this 2020 article about Bob Petrillose’s Hot Truck. While Bob passed away in 2008, Perry reports that his grandchildren are still working on the Hot Truck documentary and asks that if you have any stories or photos to share, they should be sent to hottruckproject@gmail.com.\n\nRon Pies and his wife, Nancy Butters, live in Lexington, MA, where Ron is “mostly retired from psychiatry, but still teaching and writing.” In fact, he “recently authored a novelette called The Unmoved Mover, which involves a school tragedy and its aftermath. There is a dark start to this short work, but it moves toward love and redemption.” Not surprisingly, then, Ron reports getting the most satisfaction these days from writing. His favorite Cornell memory is of the class co-taught by Professor M.H. Abrams and Professor Max Black. As he says, “This was world-class learning!”\n\nAnother classmate, Ron Berger, also wrote in from Massachusetts. “I’ve been living in Longmeadow/East Longmeadow, MA, for the past 45 years with my wife, Carol (a retired school psychologist). I have two sons, Michael, a cancer researcher at Memorial Sloan Kettering in NYC, and Rob, PhD ’09, a chemistry professor at Western Washington University in Bellingham, WA, along with four wonderful granddaughters, ages 4 to 12. I retired from primary care internal medicine about four years ago when it felt like too many outside forces were impacting practice in ways that not only made it less enjoyable but also threatened the quality of care I thought I could provide. Since then, I have been a volunteer in a Springfield middle school, teaching sixth-grade math. I have seen just how profoundly COVID and remote learning have affected all children but in particular those who are economically disadvantaged. I’ve also gained enormous respect and admiration for all those talented teachers out there.” Ron then adds, “I have never attended any Cornell Reunions and I haven’t really remained in close contact with any former classmates; however, I feel like I should attend our 50th this year. I hope many others will consider it as well.”\n\nBeverly Evans ’74’s favorite Cornell memories come from her time in the fall of 1970 as a member of the first group of women in the Big Red Band.\n\nReading the news from Florence Higgins, DVM ’81, of Rush, NY, makes me yearn for a walk in the English countryside and a happy collection of dogs and cats to enjoy indoors and out. Florence says, “I retired from practicing small animal medicine two years ago, but I work three or four half-days a month from April through October to keep my hand in. Don’t want to have to drive to work in the winter. I went hiking in the English Cotswolds for eight days last August with my husband, John Lebens, PhD ’88, and two other couples. We have a cat and two Border Collies, one of which I show in agility and obedience. I run an occasional 5K very slowly (but sometimes get an age group ribbon, as not many old ladies run). Older son Greg is a public defender in Rochester, NY. Younger son Zach works for a company in Seattle that makes imaging equipment. We visited him and his wife in June.”\n\nBeverly Evans lives and works in Geneseo, NY, where she writes that she is “distinguished professor of French and chair of the Department of Global Languages and Cultures at SUNY Geneseo. I have also been executive director of the National French Honor Society, Pi Delta Phi, since 2011. I enjoy my research, which is currently on women composers, conductors, and musicians in Paris during the interwar years.” Beverly enjoys travel and spending time with family and friends. She notes, “My great-nephew will be starting college at Swarthmore in fall 2023 to pursue a degree in Japanese. I hope that he’ll go on study abroad to Japan so I can visit him there!” Her favorite Cornell memories come from her time in the fall of 1970 as a member of the first group of women in the Big Red Band.
