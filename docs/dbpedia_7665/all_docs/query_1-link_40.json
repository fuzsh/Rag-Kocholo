        "text": "–\n\nI’m happy with this new review for Shaken from the Bulletin of the Center for Children’s Books (BCCB). Here’s a snip, minus the plot outline — Kristy, a 7th grade soccer star, suffers from the effects of a serious concussion — since BCCB asks authors not to post full reviews:\n\n“Preller’s writing is rife with strong metaphors and powerfully realistic characters, making a surprisingly gripping story despite a relatively staid plot that focuses on a girl slowly learning a new way to be healthy. As Kristy works through the pressure that she’s put on herself (and the pressure coming from her parents and older teammates) to excel, she learns how to stand up for her own needs and how to identify which of her skills are good for her, like asking for help without apologies, and which aren’t, like disassociating through difficult times. When she finally returns to the soccer field, it’s alone, to do drills and test her love for the game, which feels even more triumphant than the early scenes in front of cheering fans.”\n\nAs a reminder, here’s a snippet from last week’s review from Kirkus:\n\n“Preller’s careful pacing matches the fuzziness and slow healing of Kristy’s brain, introducing readers to the realities of the pain, loss, and feelings of isolation that dedicated athletes experience when they can no longer play. The somber tone of the story is lightened by the presence of two minor characters who bring levity and humor. Strong themes of healing (both physical and emotional), family, and friendship abound. An introspective and realistic coming-of-age story about rediscovering oneself. (Fiction. 9-13)\n\nCOMING on SEPTEMBER 10th!\n\n–\n\nI’ve been on a good reading streak lately. You know the feeling. These times when you keep picking up good books and your mind feels engaged, buzzing with ideas and perceptions. I read Percival Everett’s new novel, James, which is Everett’s version of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, told from Jim’s point of view. A brilliant book. It led me to reread Huckleberry — it had been decades — which was also profoundly interesting, a book wholly deserving of its place in the canon of American Literature. Not perfect, nope, but foundational in so many ways.\n\nJim and Huck on a raft on the river.\n\nIt’s all right there.\n\nSidenote: 2007 saw the publication of Jon Clinch’s debut novel, Finn, which focuses on Huckleberry’s father. I remember loving this dark, gritty tale when it first came out — we meet Huck in this one, too — and now I feel that I need to revisit it again.\n\nAnyway, that’s three supremely talented writers, like gold diggers seeking riches, working the same deep vein: that great fictional character, Huckleberry Finn. The distilled spirit of the American boy. Or, at least, one version of that boy.\n\nIn a similar way, I think of Ramona Quimby as a classic type of American girl. A powerful archetype, for Ramona is the most imitated character in all of children’s literature.\n\nInspired thus, and perusing the internet, as one does, I came across this illustration of Tom Sawyer by Norman Rockwell:\n\n–\n\n–\n\nThe image jarred something loose in me, because I have a similar scene in my middle-grade novel, Shaken (Macmillan, September 2024). There’s a boy sneaking out of a bedroom window late at night. Sure, I could look no farther than my own childhood to come up with that idea. But there was something else at play. Something deeper and more resonant.\n\nI should note here that the neighborhood boy in Shaken was inspired, directly, by my childhood friend, Jimmy Kuhlman, AKA, Jimbo Ku. But I now realize that the “Jimbo” in my story was also inspired by Twain’s depiction of Tom and Huck. All those characters (living and fictional) flicker around the essence of the archetypical American boy, the mischievous & resourceful rapscallion. In my book, I wanted that character to represent a sense of freedom, which was something missing from Kristy’s mindset: a wildness, an openness . . . a touch of Huckleberryness.\n\nLooking back, I understand that I treasured those qualities in my old (and still current) friend. He had an undeniable energy and rebellious intelligence. A rule-breaker. I wanted this character to enter Kristy’s world and leave her enriched and transformed. He’s just that kid in everybody’s neighborhood who is a little bit different. More alive, more free, more daring.\n\nI sensed that those qualities were absent from Kristy’s highly-scheduled, goal-oriented routine. Today I look around and suspect that those qualities are missing from the life of so many young people. There’s just not enough time to muck around. Which is too bad, because so many good and valuable lessons are learned from just mucking about.\n\nHere’s an excerpt from the moment when Kristy first notices — really notices — her next door neighbor. It is late at night and she is sitting on her front porch while the world sleeps. Or so she thinks:\n\n–\n\nThis was where Kristy sat huddled under a fleece blanket late one evening long after her parents had gone to bed. Sleeping was still a problem—it never got back on schedule—especially since she no longer exerted herself physically with sports. Kristy used to fall into bed dead-tired; now she had become nocturnal, like a bat or a bandicoot. On this night, Kristy wasn’t doing anything in particular. Just being. Enjoying the silence, the body’s quiet, late autumn’s brisk, crisp, sharp aroma of decay.\n\nThis was something new, the post-concussed version of herself, Kristy 2.0. Up all hours of the night, not busy, not active, not even restless really. The fall fragrances soothed and comforted her in a way they never had before—the smell of rotted plants and leaves and acorns: dark, rich, woody. Kristy sat content as an owl perched on a limb: watchful, alert, still.\n\nA soft noise came from the neighbors’ house to her immediate right. The Sullivans. A second-story window shivered up almost soundlessly, but not quite. Dark curtains billowed. And a black-booted foot stepped out onto the front roof. A bent figure hunched through the opening and, once outside, carefully lowered the window shut. It was the skinny boy next door, the youngest of them all, sneaking out of his house. Interesting. Kristy felt like a spy, as if she were witnessing a minor felony, something that she wasn’t meant to see. The night whispering a secret into her ear, the moon lending its stolen light.\n\nWhat was he up to?\n\nHis name, she knew, was Jimmy. They had never talked, not much anyway, though his family had moved in nearly two years ago. Though roughly the same age, their paths rarely crossed. He wore a private school uniform and rode the bus to get there. There were four or five Sullivan children—it was hard to get an accurate census—one of those sprawling families with an ever-changing assortment of cars cluttering the driveway. Teenagers coming and going. Young adults. Sometimes they even parked on the front lawn. The family had moved up from the city, Kristy believed. Two and a half hours on the train and a galaxy away.\n\nThe boy moved to the edge of the roof, rubbed his hands against his jeans. Then he leaned dangerously out over the black nothingness and, with one hand, grabbed hold of a drooping tree limb. He swung so freely, so effortlessly—like a gibbon brachiating through the forest. Kristy took a sudden intake of air when he dipped to a lower branch, wrapped his legs around the trunk for momentary purchase, then dropped to the earth as if he’d done it a hundred times before.\n\nA lone car traveled down the empty road, casting long shadows with its headlights. The boy stepped close to the house into the shadows. The beams swept across the grounds like searchlights in a prison movie. The danger passed.\n\nEven if the boy glanced in the direction of Kristy’s porch, he almost certainly would not have seen her, wrapped in the deep-blue fleece blanket pulled up to her neck. He furtively moved to the sidewalk and into the street, long strides and calm confidence. He carried something in his right hand. What was it? In answer to her question, the boy lowered a skateboard to the street and stepped onto it. He pushed off—one, two— smooth as silk over glass. With a practiced gesture, he pulled a hoodie over his head and disappeared into the night.\n\nWhere was he going, now in the witching hour, while all the world slept? To meet his friends? To party in the woods? To see his girlfriend? Or maybe he was like Kristy, awake because he was lured outside by the autumn air, a nocturnal creature of the dark. A fellow bandicoot. Maybe he couldn’t sleep. Maybe home was too hard. It was a puzzle that Kristy couldn’t solve. Not yet, anyway.\n\nShe longed to follow him into the dark.\n\n–\n\n–\n\nFor 7th-grader Kristy Barrett, soccer is life. It has always been at the center of Kristy’s world. Her friendships and self-worth, her dreams and daily activities, all revolve around the sport. Until she suffers from a serious concussion and has to set soccer aside for an uncertain amount of time. Kristy begins to struggle in school, experience stress, anxiety, and panic attacks which ultimately bring her to some questionable decisions . . . and the care of a therapist as she suffers from post-concussion syndrome. It’s a story about identity, therapy, new friendships, making mistakes and, finally, coming true to one’s ever-evolving self.\n\nSHAKEN will be published on September 10th, 2024. It is available for pre-order. Thanks for reading.\n\n–\n\nI’m not a writer who tests a manuscript with a writing group or hordes of beta readers or pretty much anyone. It’s pretty solitary. Though for Shaken, I did call on the help of various experts to inform, read, and review key sections.\n\nI’m not recommending my process to anyone, just noting that’s how I roll.\n\nSo the first review is always a strange one, because it represents one of the first reactions I get for a book.\n\nI should also note that I’m grateful to be reviewed at all. My last major book, Upstander, received only one very brief cursory review. I didn’t feel seen at all — an irony, given the theme of the book — but it stung even more because I felt the novel’s subject matter (substance use disorder) was important and worthy of our collective attention.\n\nAnyway!\n\nHere’s the review from Kirkus, widely considered one of the tougher review outlets. I’m happy with it.\n\n–\n\nLife changes quickly for a middle schooler after an accident forces her to slow down and reevaluate who she is.\n\nThirteen-year-old Kristy Barrett has always attracted attention on the soccer field: As a 4-year-old, people saw her playing and just knew there was something different about her, from her focus to her speed. She was special. This phrase has been repeated her whole life. Now, as a seventh grader, Kristy is starting on the varsity girls’ soccer team, dominating players who are several years older than she. Soccer isn’t just her passion, it’s her identity, the thing that people notice her for—and she loves it. But after she’s kicked in the head while diving for the ball, she suffers a traumatic concussion. Suddenly, Kristy is a different person—and no one seems to understand her or what she needs or even how to talk to her now that she’s not that special soccer player. Preller’s careful pacing matches the fuzziness and slow healing of Kristy’s brain, introducing readers to the realities of the pain, loss, and feelings of isolation that dedicated athletes experience when they can no longer play. The somber tone of the story is lightened by the presence of two minor characters who bring levity and humor. Strong themes of healing (both physical and emotional), family, and friendship abound. Main characters cued white.\n\nAn introspective and realistic coming-of-age story about rediscovering oneself. (Fiction. 9-13)"
