        "text": "I recently posted an essay about the history of Journalism/Photojournalism. It covers many of the linear advancements of the field, as well as the basis of news and targeted audiences. Fun fact: For stories to be considered newsworthy, news must fall under a certain subset of values. Values such as Impact, Immediacy, Proximity, Prominence, Novelty, Conflict and Emotions all affect stories and audiences differently.

How about media and entertainment? If so, be sure to join us next Wednesday, August 23rd to learn about organizations in the School of Communication and Media. Hope to see you there! #communications #publicrelations #mediaandentertainment #journalism\n\nA Tip for Publicists: Do not message or email a journalist asking to get on a call before sending them a pitch. Journalists are super busy and will usually get on a call once a pitch has been accepted. When someone asks me to get on a call immediately I say no. When someone asks for an introduction to Forbes immediately I say no. I don’t want to waste my time— just email me a pitch. #journorequest #journalism #journalist #careeradvice #publicists #publicrelations #mediarelations #blacklinkedin #blackgirlmagic #blackexcellence\n\nJournalists!
