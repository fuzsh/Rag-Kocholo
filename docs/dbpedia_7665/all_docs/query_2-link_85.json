        "text": "In 117, after a de-aged Derek Hale escaped the Beacon Hills Animal Clinic where he was being watched over by Alan Deaton and Lydia Martin, Derek headed straight to the Hale House, since he only had the memories his sixteen-year-old self had and didn't know about the Hale House Fire. Once there, Parrish and his new partner, Deputy Haigh, arrived to investigate a call of trespassing on the Hale property and found a devastated and confused Derek kneeling next to the demolished remains of his family home.\n\nThough Haigh was less than sympathetic toward Derek's confusion, Parrish ordered Haigh to stop before stepping in and treating the young Werewolf kindly, assuring him that if he needed help, they could provide it. When Derek frantically demanded to know what happened to his house, Haigh, who thought Derek was just lying due to the fact that the fire was nearly seven years ago and no one had lived there in just as long, assumed he was lying and grabbed him by the arm.\n\nHowever, when this only made Derek more upset (and, unbeknownst to them, causing him to lose control over his Werewolf transformation), Parrish urgently tried to get Haigh to stop, with no success. When Derek twisted Haigh's arm backward, Haigh grabbed his taser and shocked Derek despite Parrish's protests to the contrary.\n\nA short time later, after Derek had been arrested for assaulting a police officer, Parrish walked over to where Derek had been handcuffed to a bench and started to talk to him, explaining that though Haigh thought he was an idiot for even asking, he was sure that if he unlocked Derek's handcuffs, he was going to be okay and would let Parrish help him figure out what happened to his family. Derek nodded in agreement, and after Parrish uncuffed him, Derek remarked that Haigh was an idiot, which made Parrish laugh and reply that he couldn't argue with that comment.\n\nHowever, a moment later, Haigh called Parrish over, because every time he ran young-Derek's fingerprints through the system, he only got the adult Derek's file. Confused, Parrish and Haigh pondered this for a moment until Sheriff Stilinski took notice of what was happening and realized that a ten-years-younger Derek Hale was sitting in front of him, leaving him with no choice but to call Scott and Stiles for answers.\n\nIn Muted, Parrish was seen at the Sheriff's station after the murders of Sean Walcott's parents and brother, where he was discussing the case with Sheriff Stilinski. Stilinski informed him that he didn't want anyone else on site before assigning Parrish to staking out the Walcott House and reviewing the crime scene photos on his own.\n\nWhen Parrish remarked that it felt like they were missing something, Stilinski went on to reveal that Special Agent McCall had brought in an expert from Quantico who deals with this sort of case to help them investigate. Parrish frowned and asked him if he meant the U.S. Marshal, and when Stilinski seemed confused by this news, Parrish pointed to Braeden, who appeared at the front desk with a U.S. Marshal badge and informed the deputy working there that she had previously called about a case file.\n\nThat afternoon, Parrish was in the middle of reviewing the crime scene photos as he was instructed while he sat outside of the Walcott House in a stake-out. When he sighed and decided to take a break, he looked up at the house and was both shocked and unnerved by the fact that he saw someone walk past the door from the inside. Pulling his sidearm out of his holster, Parrish made his way into the house, where he identified himself as a Sheriff's deputy and demanded that the person reveal themselves. However, he was completely surprised when a shell-shocked Lydia Martin came out of the adjacent hallway, clearly having just snapped out of a Banshee fugue state.\n\nAfter Parrish had put away his weapon and followed Lydia into the next room, she remarked that she would ordinarily try to tell him what she was doing there, but made it clear that she had yet to receive a satisfactory explanation herself. When Parrish brought up the fact that she has an unusual habit of showing up at places where people have been brutally murdered, Lydia somewhat flirtatiously asked him if this meant she had a reputation, leading Parrish to shrug and reply, \"An unusual one.\"\n\nHe went on to suggest that she may be psychic, which made Lydia roll her eyes and ask him if he really believed in \"all that,\" to which Parrish responded that while he'd like to say he doesn't believe in anything, he likes to try to keep an open mind. Lydia seemed intrigued by his response, but became concerned when he reminded her that she's a little late to be looking for dead bodies, considering the fact that the Walcotts had been murdered the previous evening.\n\nParrish became confused when Lydia became distracted by something on the wall behind them, not realizing that her supernatural senses were seeing wailing Banshee faces in the grain of the wood to alert her to the fact that death was heavy in that area. He watched Lydia as she walked over to the wall and pressed it with her hands, which caused the wall to pop open and reveal a hidden door. After opening it further, Parrish once again grabbed his sidearm and his flashlight and led them into the hidden corridor, which was so chilly that it was full of fog that made the two shiver.\n\nThe corridor led to a room that had long, clear curtains of plastic sheeting in the threshold, and when they made their way into the next room, they found that the reason why it was so cold was because it was a game locker of some kind. Parrish suggested to Lydia that the Walcotts may have been hunting deer and other animals, since it was legal in some parts of California, but the look on Lydia's face made it clear that she knew it was more sinister than that. Sure enough, when Parrish opened one of the large plastic bags suspended from the ceiling, he found a dead, preserved body hanging by a hook, the sight of which nearly made him vomit.\n\nIn The Benefactor, Parrish accompanied Sheriff Stilinski to the roof of Beacon Hills Memorial Hospital, where Sean Walcott had been killed by The Mute after nearly eating Liam Dunbar. After a moment, Stilinski, who was eager to investigate the more supernatural aspects of the case in peace, asked Parrish to get the rest of the deputies and CSIs off the roof and to try to stall the medical examiner for five minutes, since he had an expert of his own coming to take a look at the scene. Parrish gave Stilinski a skeptical look and asked him if he really had an expert in \"teenage cannibals,\" but when Stilinski insisted it would only be five minutes, Parrish did as he was told and cleared the roof so Stilinski could talk to Derek Hale, who revealed that Sean Walcott and his families were a species of cannibalistic shapeshifters known as Wendigos.\n\nThe next night, after Peter Hale was attacked by The Mute in Derek's loft, Sheriff Stilinski and Derek were talking about the mouthless-man's motives in Sheriff's office at the station. Stilinski asked Derek what kind of person ran around with a tomahawk just as Parrish walked into the office to talk to him.\n\nBoth Derek and Stilinski were intrigued when Parrish brought up the fact that he carried a tomahawk when he was deployed to Afghanistan, especially when Parrish identified both the tomahawk and The Mute's wrist communication device as being military equipment. Believing Parrish could be a great help in their investigation, Derek silently communicated to Stilinski that they should bring him into their discussion, leading the Sheriff to ask Parrish to demonstrate how the equipment worked.\n\nSome time later, Parrish was seen patching into the computer program in the wrist communicator and informed them that he thought he had found an IP address for the last place The Mute used Wi-Fi on the device. Just then, the fingers of the glove attached to the device twitched and whirred, leading Derek to ask him what had just happened. Parrish typed into the computer and explained that The Mute had just received a message that read. \"Money transferred.\"\n\nWhen Parrish asked them if they recognized the handle \"Benefactor,\" Stilinski and Derek realized that The Mute wasn't just a killer, he was an assassin who had been hired by someone specifically to kill these people; meanwhile, across town at the Martin Family lake house, Lydia Martin and Kira Yukimura had just cracked a computer code that revealed the first section of a hit-list of supernatural creatures that included the Walcotts, Scott, Lydia, Derek, and Kira, among many others.\n\nIn I.E.D., Parrish returned to the Sheriff's station and stopped Sheriff Stilinski before he left for the Beacon Hills Cyclones lacrosse game to inform him that while he was on patrol, he found a young woman walking into Beacon Hills from the coast. When the Sheriff looked at him in confusion, Parrish moved aside to reveal that the young woman was Meredith Walker, who had heard Lydia Martin talking to Malia Tate about how they needed help figuring out the Deadpool and broke out of Eichen House to assist them.\n\nParrish watched as Meredith demanded to talk to Lydia and went on to voice his surprise when he learned that Stilinski had called in Lydia and Malia to talk to Meredith. When he asked Stilinski if he had summoned Lydia because Meredith asked him to, or \"because of the other thing,\" Stilinski, confused, asked what he meant, so Parrish looked around to make sure no one was listening before implying that Lydia was psychic.\n\nStilinski was even more surprised to hear that Parrish believed Lydia to be a psychic, and when Parrish asked him if he believed it, Stilinski lied and said that he didn't, and that he instead believed her to be intuitive, leading Parrish to point out that in the past, psychics were actually called \"intuitionists\" for this very reason. Stilinski, clearly frustrated by the fact that he was unable to be truthful with Parrish about the supernatural, ended the conversation by reluctantly inviting Parrish into the office to help Lydia and Malia talk with Meredith.\n\nAfter listening to Lydia's failed attempts to get answers from Meredith, Parrish asked if Meredith minded if he asked her some questions, to which Meredith, who seemed to be physically attracted to Parrish, agreed. He patiently asked her if there was someone Meredith calls when she needs something, and when Meredith explained that it depended on the situation, since she went to different people for different things.\n\nParrish suggested that perhaps she could give them the number of someone they could call to help them with their current problem, which, unbeknownst to Parrish, was unlocking the second of three sections of the Deadpool hit-list. However, though Meredith agreed, the number she gave them was only four digits (2-4-3-6), which made Lydia so frustrated that she lost her temper and screamed at Meredith, causing Meredith to begin to have a panic attack and leading Parrish to separate the girls to prevent Meredith from any more trauma.\n\nParrish ultimately gave Meredith his Sheriff's deputy jacket to wear in order to warm herself up while he made arrangements for her to be returned to Eichen House. After Lydia and Malia figured out that the number Meredith gave them was a code that, when used with the numbers on the telephone buttons, spelled out \"Aiden\" (the name of another recently deceased McCall Pack ally), they unlocked the second portion of the Deadpool hit-list.\n\nLydia was in the middle of looking at the newly cracked list when Parrish walked into the office and asked Lydia if she needed a ride home, startling her so much that she slammed her Macbook closed in surprise. After recovering from the shock, Lydia smiled at Parrish and assured him that she had a way home, leading Parrish to look slightly disappointed as he walked away. Once he was gone, Lydia opened her Macbook again and looked grim as she re-read the newest portion of the Deadpool, which had Jordan Parrish listed at $5 million, revealing that he was, in fact, a supernatural creature, though it remained a mystery as to whether or not he was aware of this fact.\n\nIn Orphaned, Parrish arrived at Beacon Hills High School with Sheriff Stilinski and several of his fellow deputies to arrest Violet after her attempted assassination of Scott McCall in order to reap his Deadpool bounty. When he was walking her off the scene, she noticed his name tag, which read \"PARRISH\" and, recognizing his name from the Deadpool list, asked him if his full name was Jordan Parrish.\n\nHowever, Parrish, not knowing what she was talking about, curtly replied that he was Deputy Parrish. When he was about to put Violet in the back of his cruiser, he was stopped by Special Agent McCall, and he listened as Agent McCall questioned Violet on her use of a thermo-wire garrote disguised as a bolo necklace, which has apparently been used in at least a dozen murders by a pair of assassins known as The Orphans, which the FBI had been investigating for some time. When Violet denied McCall's accusations, Parrish sternly grabbed Violet and escorted her out to the cruiser to be taken to the Sheriff's station.\n\nThe next day, Parrish was at work at the station when Stiles and Lydia, who had skipped school, arrived to see him. Parrish assumed they were there to talk to Stilinski and informed them that, while he wasn't there at the moment, they could still wait for him to return in his office. However, the two quickly revealed that they were actually there to see Parrish himself. When Stiles and Lydia handed Parrish a folded copy of the second portion of the Deadpool list, he asked them if it was actually a hit-list before mentioning that the Sheriff had him run many of the names on the list, but he was unable to find anything on them in the system. Parrish asked them what else they wanted to tell him, so Lydia gingerly flipped over the folded list to reveal to him that his name was at the bottom.\n\nParrish declared this revelation to be \"sort of terrifying\" and balked at the fact that he was supposedly only worth $5 until Stiles corrected him by assuring him he's actually worth $5 million. This correction was not very comforting to Parrish, who remarked that he only made $40,000 a year and that maybe he should simply kill himself. Parrish then turned the topic to why he was on the list in the first place, but Stiles and Lydia, who were already overwhelmed by this newest portion of the list, stated that the explanation as to why he was being targeted (which entailed revealing the supernatural to him and informing him that he was a supernatural creature) was a topic for another day.\n\nThey then brought up the other point of their visit—they needed to crack the third and final portion of the Deadpool list, and they needed Meredith Walker's help to do it. When Parrish realized who they were talking about, he initially rejected their request, citing the fact that Lydia had almost given Meredith a nervous breakdown in the previous episode. However, when Lydia insisted that the operative word was \"almost,\" and the urgency of the situation led Parrish to ultimately agree to escort them to interview her.\n\nAt Eichen House, an orderly was in the middle of unlocking Meredith's door so that Parrish, Stiles, and Lydia could see her when the head orderly, Brunski, caught him and admonished him before he could do so. When Parrish insisted that he had to interview Meredith as part of an ongoing investigation, Brunski said he could talk to Meredith if he wanted, but Lydia and especially Stiles could not.\n\nParrish argued that Stiles and Lydia were crucial witnesses in the investigation and that he wouldn't have brought them if it wasn't absolutely necessary, but Brunski, now frustrated, told Parrish to return with a warrant if he wanted to talk to Meredith. Brunski then turned his attention to Stiles and began berating him for the fact that \"Daddy\" was behind on his bills from Stiles' previous stay at Eichen and mocked Sheriff's government job before insisting that Stiles return with payment in full.\n\nFeeling badly for Stiles and clearly angered by Brunski's attempts to humiliate him, Parrish brought up the fact that the \"government jobs\" Brunski was mocking came in handy when one needed a favor and brought up the fact that he had a friend at Canaan PD who helped Brunski get home safe after he blew a 0.1 (0.03 higher than the legal limit for alcohol intoxication) on a Breathalyzer. Brunski, realizing he's been played, immediately began to backpedal and claimed he had no problem with a little \"quid pro quo\" before allowing the three into Meredith's room.\n\nParrish watched as Lydia and Stiles asked Meredith to give them the third cipher key in whichever method she found most comfortable, but became concerned when Meredith anxiously insisted that things had changed and she was no longer able to help them. The three became concerned by the fact that Meredith admitted to The Benefactor warning her not to tell them anything, which only caused Lydia to become more aggressive and persistent in her pursuit of the third cipher key. When Lydia snapped that a lot more people were going to die if Meredith didn't help them, Parrish told Lydia to lay off of her, but Lydia continued to push it until Meredith screamed \"I don't know!\" in her Banshee voice so loud that Lydia's ear began to bleed, leading the three to end up leaving empty-handed.\n\nAfter going to the Stilinski House and eventually using Lydia's Banshee senses to discover that the third cipher key was \"Derek,\" which alarmed them due to the fact that unlike the previous two keys (\"Allison\" and \"Aiden\"), Derek was not yet dead. Stiles and Lydia then successfully unlocked the last portion of the list with the new key, but they were horrified when they saw that Meredith was on the list for $1 million, which led Lydia to waste no time in calling Parrish to warn him that Meredith was in danger. Unfortunately, this gave Parrish no choice but to inform Lydia that he had just received word from Eichen House that Meredith had committed suicide, and that Brunski found her body hanging from a noose created by a bed sheet in her room.\n\nIn Perishable, Parrish awoke after somehow being knocked out to find that he was in his police cruiser, where his wrists had been bound to his steering wheel with zip-ties and where he was being doused in some kind of liquid. When Parrish began to scream in hopes of someone freeing him, his partner, Deputy Haigh, holding a tank of gasoline that he continued to pour over Parrish and the cruiser, appeared and remarked that he thought Parrish would have been unconscious a lot longer.\n\nParrish demanded to know what Haigh was doing, so Haigh responded that, while he thought Parrish was a good guy, he was worth $5 million on the Deadpool, indicating that he was intending to kill him to gain Parrish's bounty. Parrish tried to talk Haigh out of it, playing dumb about the Deadpool and instead stating that he only made $40,000 a year, to which Haigh responded that he only made $36,000. He then tried to talk Haigh out of it by offering to help him with any money problems he may be having, but Haigh reminded him once again that he was worth $5 million dead, which meant that Parrish was the one with the problem.\n\nDespite Parrish's pleas and insistence that Haigh would be unable to sit and watch a fellow deputy burn to death, Haigh put his earbuds into his ears and listened to his music while he threw a lit lighter onto Parrish, setting him on fire. Afterward, when Haigh returned to the Beacon County Sheriff's Station, he messaged The Benefactor to request payment for Parrish's murder. Sheriff Stilinski walked into the bullpen and asked Haigh if he had seen Parrish, causing Haigh to lie and say that he hadn't. Moments later, Parrish, naked and covered in soot and bits of his melted uniform but otherwise unharmed, stormed into the bullpen and immediately made a bee-line for Haigh, who was shocked to see that Parrish had survived being burned alive.\n\nHaigh pulled out his gun just as Parrish lunged toward him and pinned him against the wall, and the two wrestled to try to get the gun for themselves when Haigh accidentally discharged it, shooting through the wall into Sheriff Stilinski's office and hitting him in the shoulder in the process. This result stunned Haigh enough that Parrish was able to tackle him to the ground and punch him repeatedly in the face until he finally snapped out of it, as both the immunity to fire and the uncharacteristic rage that followed indicating that Parrish was truly supernatural.\n\nAfterward, Parrish made a quick stop to his apartment to shower and change into new street clothes before Lydia brought him to Derek's loft, where Derek and Scott examined him. They were just as shocked as Lydia and Parrish that he had survived the fire, noting that his hair and nails, which are parts of the body that are technically dead, weren't destroyed by the flames.\n\nDerek, Lydia, and Scott began to debate what Parrish could be, and when Derek cryptically stated that Parrish \"wasn't like them\" due to the fact that they were not immune to fire, Parrish became frustrated and asked if they were all like Lydia, who he assumed was psychic. Somewhat amused, Scott informed him that they weren't exactly psychic, and when Parrish asked what they were, Scott looked at Derek for permission to share their secret before flashing his glowing red eyes at him and revealing his nature as an Alpha Werewolf.\n\nDerek, Lydia, and Scott then gave Parrish a brief recap of the various supernatural beings they had encountered along the way, and when Parrish asked them what a Kanima was, Scott promised to get back to that later before getting to the point, which was that every supernatural creature in Beacon Hills was on the Deadpool. When Parrish pointed out that he didn't even have any idea of what he was, Derek remarked that the assassins likely didn't care as long as they were getting paid for his death.\n\nParrish went on to ask how many professional assassins they were dealing with, Lydia admitted that they were starting to lose count before Scott pointed out that it didn't seem to even be only professionals anymore. Parrish insisted that he didn't think Haigh had ever tried to take out a hit on someone and suggested that he was just taking a chance to get some big money, which caused Derek to realize that this meant anyone with a copy of the list could try to do the same thing. Parrish went on to remark that since Haigh clearly had a copy of the Deadpool, then it is likely that it's even easier to get it than it was before.\n\nAfterward, Parrish listened to Lydia's story about her grandmother, Lorraine Martin, specifically the fact that she was a Banshee and had sought out Meredith Walker upon learning that she was a Banshee, too, as well as the fact that Lorraine had developed the code used to create the Deadpool and that she left Lydia a message in the same code. Once they were done talking, Parrish went out to his car, taking a long moment to examine his unburned and unblemished hands before he left.\n\nThe next day, Stiles and Lydia went to Parrish after they finally managed to decode Lorraine's message and asked him to run the names on the list in hopes of finding something they had in common. Parrish, upon doing as he was asked, stated that the list was more of an \"Already-Dead-pool\" due to the fact that all of the people listed had committed suicide in Eichen House, including Lorraine herself.\n\nThat night, Parrish was looking through the police reports of the deaths of those on the list and realized that they had all been found by Brunski, an Eichen House orderly, leading him to discover that Brunski was an \"Angel of Death\" and had killed everyone on the list and made it look like suicides. He then quickly drove to Eichen House, where he managed to find Stiles and Lydia before Brunski could kill them to keep his secret. When Brunski sneered at him and said that, as a young deputy, Parrish had probably never killed anyone before, Parrish shot him just as he tried once again to inject Lydia with an overdose of narcotics. As Brunski laid dying, he revealed that he wasn't The Benefactor, but Meredith, who had faked her death, causing Meredith to appear out of the shadows behind Parrish and confirm that Brunski told the truth.\n\nIn Monstrous, Parrish approached Stilinski and Lydia, who were both discussing the station's psychologist's failed attempts to question Meredith Walker, after having gone through everything in Brunski's office with his fellow deputies and had also found nothing. Parrish then noticed that Lydia was still wearing the same outfit from the previous evening and asked her if she hadn't been home yet, rolling his eyes incredulously when Lydia insisted she wasn't going to go anywhere until Meredith started talking. He seemed to agree with Stilinski when Lydia demanded that they let her try to talk to Meredith herself, but the young Banshee would not be deterred and ultimately won her case.\n\nLater on, after Meredith admitted to Lydia that she would only explain herself to Peter Hale, Parrish seemingly went to find the middle-aged Werewolf and brought him to the station so he could question Meredith himself. Peter seemed skeptical that Meredith was capable of stealing his $117 million in bearer bonds, which made Parrish scowl at him as Lydia reminded him that Banshees were more dangerous than he thought.\n\nOnce inside the interrogation room, Parrish stood watch in the corner while Peter sat down across from Meredith and wasted no time demanding to know where the rest of his money was (understanding that several million of it had likely already been paid out to various assassins). Meredith remained silent and instead looked at him in awe; when she forgot about what she was doing and instinctively reached out to touch his face, Peter grabbed her roughly by the wrist to stop her, forcing Parrish to intervene and insist that he let her go. Visibly shaken, Peter asked Meredith why she did that, and Meredith once again was awestruck as she remarked that his burns had all Accelerated Healing, leading the group to realize that Meredith had been his roommate while she was catatonic and he was comatose several years after the Hale House Fire.\n\nParrish, Stilinski, and Lydia continued to watch as Peter, exasperated by the fact that Meredith put both his daughter Malia Tate and his nephew Derek Hale on the Deadpool, continued to question her. Meredith, visibly anxious, assured him it was because he told her it had to be a secret, and though Peter initially insisted that he had never met her before, it soon became clear that she was not lying. Before Parrish could rise to his feet and separate them, Peter lunged across the table and performed the Memory Manipulation ritual which involved him impaling his claws in the back of her spinal cord to look through her memories.\n\nLydia had to jump in and save them when Parrish attempted to extricate Peter from Meredith's neck, informing him that breaking the bond early could kill both Meredith and Peter. Stilinski asked what they were supposed to do now, and Lydia was left with no choice to admit that she had no idea before Parrish demanded to know what exactly he was doing to her. Stilinski and Parrish soon noticed that Meredith was whispering imperceptibly, but fortunately, Lydia's enhanced hearing picked it up so that she could hear every word perfectly.\n\nMeredith went on to reveal (with Lydia narrating) that Meredith and Peter were indeed roommates in the hospital in 2009, where somehow, Meredith's Banshee powers picked up the same wavelength as Peter's thoughts, creating a telepathic bond in which Meredith could hear every thought running through his overactive mind as though he were speaking to her directly.\n\nIt was soon revealed that Peter had given Meredith the idea to start the Deadpool, as he believed his sister Talia Hale's leadership of the Hale Pack left them weak and vulnerable, and the psychosis caused by being paralyzed but fully cognizant for years led him to believe the only option was to \"raze the Beacon Hills supernatural community to the ground\" and remake it in his image. Just then, Peter broke the bond between him and Meredith, which left him weakened on the floor as Lydia, Parrish, and Stilinski confronted him about having given Meredith the idea the entire time and not even realizing it.\n\nParrish and Stilinski held Peter at gunpoint, much to Peter's chagrin, causing Peter to remind them of how traumatic his coma was and how it would have made anyone \"crazy.\" When Parrish pointed out that Meredith was listening to him, Peter retorted, \"She was listening to the ranting and raving of a lunatic!\" until he realized he had insulted himself and added, \"A former lunatic. I'm much healthier, now\" before insisting he had nothing to do with this.\n\nLydia quickly figured out that this entire scene was orchestrated by Meredith, as a fight breaking out could potentially kill Meredith, Lydia, and Parrish, successfully eliminating three more names off the Deadpool (with values of $1 million, $20 million, and $5 million, respectively). Frustrated by the fact that Lydia was right, Stilinki and Parrish reluctantly let him go, though Stilinski warned Peter that he had now been allowed to walk free twice from him and would not be allowed to do so a third time.\n\nFortunately, while this situation was playing out, Stiles and Malia successfully stopped the Deadpool computers and ended the killings while the rest of the combined forces of the McCall Pack and Satomi's Pack fought off a group of Hunters-turned-assassins at Argent Arms International, making Parrish no longer under threat of death for his Deadpool bounty.\n\nIn A Promise to the Dead, it was revealed that Parrish had been following Peter Hale around since the events of Monstrous when he was able to locate Chris Argent, who had approached the Werewolf in the Underground Tunnels and had been critically injured when Peter impaled him with a piece of rebar and pinned him to the concrete wall.\n\nUpon seeing Parrish, Argent weakly informed him that Peter, Kate, and her Berserkers were already gone, and when Parrish asked him how long he had been like that, Argent admitted that he wasn't sure, because he may have blacked out from pain and blood loss a couple times. Parrish did not seem surprised to find that Peter had done this to him, and when Argent realized he had been following Peter, Parrish confirmed it, explaining that he had done so ever since he attacked Meredith Walker at the Sheriff's station.\n\nMore worried about Kate and Peter's plans than himself, Argent urged Parrish to leave to warn Scott McCall that the Werewolf and Werejaguar were working together and going after him, but Parrish refused, as there was no cell service down in the tunnels, and if he left Argent down there like he wanted, he would be dead by the time Parrish came back. Parrish then made it clear that they were going to free him first, and then they would find Scott together.\n\nUnfortunately, Parrish was unable to bend back the rebar so Argent could be pulled off of it, nor was he able to separate the bar from the concrete wall, so he was left with no choice but to beg Argent to gather what little stamina he had left to help him. Argent continued to argue that Parrish should just leave, but Parrish insisted that he couldn't do that and acknowledged that Argent was hurt and tired before adding that he needed to give him everything he had so they could get out of there.\n\nThis caused Argent to break down and insist that he had nothing left, obviously devastated by the loss of his daughter and the double betrayal of his sister, and when he once again insisted that Parrish go, Parrish ordered him to grab the bar as politely and as firmly as possible. He went on to say that Argent needed adrenaline, and explained the two ways to get it—fear and anger; since Argent didn't seem like a man who scared easily, Parrish urged Argent to get angry so his body would let loose every bit of adrenaline he had left.\n\nArgent despondently argued that he was too tired to be angry, and Parrish quickly realized that this was about more than just being physically hurt. Parrish confessed that, while he did not know much about Argent, he did know about Allison from talking to Lydia, including her feelings about Scott.\n\nHe reminded Argent that if Allison were there, she would be furious to know what Kate was about to do to Scott and once again insisted that Argent get just as angry to help them get out of there. This seemed to wake Argent up from his malaise, and on the count of three, he and Parrish began bending back the rebar with all of their combined strength, with Argent screaming in pain the whole way. Parrish put so much of his energy into freeing Argent that his eyes glowed bright orange-red, a hint to his supernatural identity.\n\nIn Smoke and Mirrors, Parrish and a patched up Argent arrived at La Iglesia in an SUV, tagging along with the Calavera Family of Hunters, who had all arrived to back up the McCall Pack and to help take down Kate Argent and Peter Hale, who had taken Scott McCall and Kira Yukimura hostage. Parrish and Argent took positions behind their respective car doors and began shooting at Kate and the Berserkers from several meters away from the church ruins.\n\nAfter some time had passed, Parrish shouted to Argent that the Berserkers weren't going down despite the hundreds of bullets they and the Hunters had shot at them and pointed out that they were running out of ammo. This led Argent to pull out a single bullet he had created with yellow wolfsbane, which he put in the chamber of his Desert Eagle and prepared to fire it at his sister Kate. Parrish watched in shock as Derek Hale revealed his ability to fully-shift into a black wolf before he and Argent ultimately wounded her severely enough to cause her to flee.\n\nOnce the fight was over, Parrish watched as Argent left with the Calavera Family after having agreed to leave the McCall Pack alone, and as Derek and Braeden set off to travel elsewhere while the others prepared to return to Beacon Hills. Some time later, Lydia came to visit Parrish at the Beacon County Sheriff's Station, where she brought him a hardcover copy of the Argent Family Bestiary, informing him that whatever creature Parrish is could be in there and admitting that she would like to help him figure out his supernatural identity."
