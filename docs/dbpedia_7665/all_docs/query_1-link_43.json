        "text": "State Assembly\n\nVoters will choose their representatives in all 80 state Assembly districts. Many will be new due to retirements and term limits, but how many challengers oust incumbents? And how many will flip from one party to the other?\n\nJump to section\n\nFind Your District\n\nWhat to Know\n\nWhat does a state Assemblymember do?\n\nCast as many as 3,000 votes a year — and in theory a way most of your constituents want.\n\nPass a state spending plan when there’s likely to be a deficit and an uncertain financial picture.\n\nSit through long meetings, unless you get a spot on the powerful Appropriations Committee, where you’ll decide behind closed doors and then pass or kill all the bills at once.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Assembly experienced a “Great Resignation” in 2022 with 25 members taking other jobs or announcing their retirement. And there was more turnover in the 2022 election.\n\nDuties can depend on party affiliation. Democrats — who control 62 of the 80 seats now and want to keep a supermajority — should be prepared to craft important legislation. Republicans should be prepared to spend a lot of time criticizing Democrats and complaining about being frozen out of decisions.\n\nBut not all Democrats are alike. They often disagree — about health care, housing, environmental regulation, taxes and labor law. In Democratic-leaning districts, expect unions, left-leaning activists and deep-pocketed business interests to aggressively push the Democrat of their choice.\n\nRank-and-file Assemblymembers are paid $128,215 a year, plus $214 a day for expenses when the Legislature is in session. Party leaders get higher pay.\n\nThe top two finishers in March, regardless of party, moved on to the November general election. There are eight Democrat vs. Democrat races and four Republican vs. Republican. Two American Independent Party candidates also advanced. And six Assemblymembers are uncontested, barring write-in challengers.\n\nKey Races\n\nClick on a district to learn more about some key state Assembly races in California\n\nDistrict 7\n\nThe District\n\nThe eastern suburbs of Sacramento are a perpetual political battleground, encompassing some of the region’s wealthiest communities, as well as diverse, working-class commuter cities that built up around the former Mather Air Force Base.\n\nVoter registration: 37.6% Democratic, 33.0% Republican, 20.7% no party preference\n\nThe Scoop\n\nPrimary results: Josh Hoover: 52.7%, Porsche Middleton: 29.3%\n\nDemocrats are looking for revenge here, after Assemblymember Josh Hoover, a Republican from Folsom, narrowly defeated the longtime Democratic incumbent in 2022. Porsche Middleton, who owns a housing development consulting firm and is a member of the Citrus Heights city council, emerged from the March primary to challenge Hoover. Hoover won a majority in March, despite the Democratic registration advantage in the district, but presidential elections often bring out a more liberal electorate in California. Amid a legislative focus on homelessness and fentanyl in his first term, Hoover has also been advocating against a return-to-office mandate for state government workers, who make up a large portion of the district’s voters.\n\nKey Endorsements\n\nPorsche Middleton\n\nCalifornia Labor Federation\n\nPlanned Parenthood Advocates Mar Monte\n\nCalifornia Legislative Black Caucus\n\nJosh Hoover\n\nCalifornia Police Chiefs Association\n\nPeace Officers Research Association of California\n\nCalifornia Rifle & Pistol Association\n\nRelated News\n\nSacramento Bee\n\nBack to top\n\nDistrict 26\n\nThe District\n\nThis safely Democratic seat in the South Bay — representing a chunk of San Jose plus tech-heavy suburbs Cupertino, Santa Clara and Sunnyvale — is the rare legislative district in California with a plurality of Asian Americans.\n\nParty registration: 51.8% Democratic, 14.7% Republican, 29.1% no party preference\n\nThe Scoop\n\nPrimary results: Patrick Ahrens: 34.4%, Tara Sreekrishnan: 26.9%\n\nThe profiles for Patrick Ahrens and Tara Sreekrishnan are similar in many ways. Both are Democrats. Both are in their early 30s. Both work for state legislators (Ahrens is the district director for Assemblymember Evan Low, Sreekrishnan is the deputy chief of staff and legislative director for Sen. Dave Cortese) and serve in local elected office (the Foothill-De Anza Community College District Board and the Santa Clara County Board of Education, respectively). Yet this race is going to be a slugfest — and potentially one of these most expensive campaigns of the fall — as business and labor engage in another proxy war to gain another sliver of advantage at the Capitol. Outside interests poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into the primary, with Uber, PG&E and the California Apartment Association spending big to boost Ahrens, while state employee unions, charter school advocates and the soda industry backed Sreekrishnan.\n\nKey Endorsements\n\nPatrick Ahrens\n\nPlanned Parenthood Advocates Mar Monte\n\nEquality California\n\nCalifornia Labor Federation\n\nPeace Officers Research Association of California\n\nTara Sreekrishnan\n\nSierra Club California\n\nCalifornia Environmental Voters\n\nCalifornia Labor Federation\n\nEverytown for Gun Safety\n\nRelated News\n\nSan José Spotlight\n\nBack to top\n\nDistrict 27\n\nThe District\n\nThis majority Latino district runs along Highway 99 from Merced to Fresno and then down to Coalinga. Like other heavily agricultural areas in the Central Valley, voters lean more conservative than the party registration would suggest.\n\nParty registration: 41.5% Democratic, 28.4% Republican, 22.3% no party preference\n\nThe Scoop\n\nPrimary results: Joanna Garcia Rose: 50.9%, Esmerelda Soria: 49.1%\n\nFirst-term Assemblymember Esmeralda Soria, a Merced Democrat, got the scare of her political life in the primary, when she finished behind Republican Joanna Garcia Rose, a tax auditor who had raised less than $50,000 at that point. Now the GOP senses a prime opportunity to flip a seat, cutting into the Democratic supermajority in Sacramento by capitalizing on voter frustration over the economy and crime. It will be a tough task. The Democratic Party is still far better resourced in California, and it’s going to dump plenty of money and organizing power into the district to avoid a repeat of the low-turnout primary. Soria has also been shoring up her moderate credentials at the Capitol, including by bucking her party during a showdown over a controversial package of retail theft legislation.\n\nKey Endorsements\n\nEsmeralda Soria\n\nCalifornia Labor Federation\n\nCalifornia Police Chiefs Association\n\nPlanned Parenthood Advocates Mar Monte\n\nJoanna Garcia Rose\n\nRep. John Duarte\n\nRep. Tom McClintock\n\nMerced County Sheriff Vern Warnke\n\nRelated News\n\nFresno Bee\n\nBack to top\n\nDistrict 40\n\nThe District\n\nThe northern suburbs of Los Angeles County, centered around Santa Clarita, are whiter and more affluent than nearby communities in the San Fernando Valley. Once solidly Republican, the area has become one of California’s fiercest political battlegrounds over the past decade.\n\nParty registration: 41.7% Democratic, 29.8% Republican, 21.6% no party preference\n\nThe Scoop\n\nPrimary results: Pilar Schiavo: 50.2%, Patrick Lee Gipson: 49.8%\n\nAssemblymember Pilar Schiavo, a first-term Democrat from Santa Clarita, has her work cut out for her this fall. Party control of this seat has changed hands in each of the past three elections and Republicans would like to make it four in a row. Schiavo won by just 522 votes in 2022, and she led her Republican opponent — retired sheriff’s deputy Patrick Lee Gipson, who is running on public safety and parents’ rights in schools — by a nearly identical margin in the primary. It’s certain to be a close outcome that could hinge on heavy investments from both parties in the overlapping congressional district, a target for Democrats trying to flip a Republican-held seat.\n\nKey Endorsements\n\nPilar Schiavo\n\nCalifornia Labor Federation\n\nLos Angeles Police Protective League\n\nSierra Club California\n\nPatrick Lee Gipson\n\nAssociation for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs\n\nPeace Officers Research Association of California\n\nChino Valley Unified School District Board President Sonja Shaw\n\nRelated News\n\nIncumbent leads in 40th District fundraising\n\nThe Santa Clarita Valley Signal\n\nBack to top\n\nDistrict 47\n\nThe District\n\nStretching east from San Bernardino into Riverside County along Highway 10, this swing district has vast rural pockets, including Joshua Tree National Park, and a large LGBTQ community around Palm Springs.\n\nParty registration: 39.8% Democratic, 34.0% Republican, 17.9% no party preference\n\nThe Scoop\n\nPrimary results: Greg Wallis: 48.6%, Christy Holstege: 46.4%\n\nThis is an exciting rematch from 2022, when Assemblymember Greg Wallis, a first-term Republican from Rancho Mirage, beat Democrat Christy Holstege, an attorney and Palm Springs city councilmember, by just 85 votes. The outcome was so uncertain that Holstege actually attended an orientation for new members in Sacramento before the race was called. Wallis has legislated carefully from the political center, even supporting a measure to enshrine same-sex marriage rights in the California Constitution. But Democrats are salivating at the pickup opportunity, especially after Holstege and another Democratic candidate received a majority of the vote in the primary. A hotly contested race in the overlapping congressional district, where Democrats are organizing to flip a Republican-held seat, could further reshape the landscape of the campaign.\n\nKey Endorsements\n\nChristy Holstege\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom\n\nCalifornia Labor Federation\n\nSierra Club California\n\nCalifornia Legislative LGBTQ Caucus\n\nGreg Wallis\n\nCalifornia Police Chiefs Association\n\nPeace Officers Research Association of California\n\nCalifornia Professional Firefighters\n\nRelated News\n\nBack to top\n\nDistrict 57\n\nThe District\n\nThis safely Democratic district in South Los Angeles is a historic base of Black political representation, but the population has become overwhelmingly Latino in recent decades.\n\nParty registration: 61.2% Democratic, 7.5% Republican, 22.8% no party preference\n\nThe Scoop\n\nPrimary results: Efren Martinez: 32.7%, Sade Elhawary: 31.1%\n\nThough longtime Assemblymember Reggie Jones-Sawyer is termed out, there will still be a familiar name on the ballot: Efren Martinez, a business consultant who has repeatedly (and unsuccessfully) run for local office, including a 2020 challenge of Jones-Sawyer that turned very ugly when the state prison guards union got involved. Martinez, who has strong law enforcement backing again, placed first in an extremely low-turnout primary, slightly ahead of Sade Elhawary, a progressive community organizer. Ideological differences between the two Democrats may not ultimately matter as much in this race as, well, race. (Martinez is the son of Mexican immigrants, Elhawary is of Black and Guatemalan descent.) The dearth of political representation in South Los Angeles is a frustration for many Latinos, while leaders in the Black community fear losing further power — a tension that exploded into public in 2022 when an audio recording of city council members making racist remarks leaked. Elhawary and her allies criticized Martinez during the primary for attacks that they said were intended to scare Latino voters off from supporting her.\n\nKey Endorsements\n\nSade Elhawary\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass\n\nSen. Laphonza Butler\n\nCalifornia Labor Federation\n\nCalifornia Legislative Black Caucus\n\nEfren Martinez\n\nRep. Adam Schiff\n\nPeace Officers Research Association of California\n\nLos Angeles Police Protective League\n\nRelated News\n\nBack to top\n\nDistrict 75\n\nThe District\n\nThis safely Republican seat represents inland San Diego County, a more rural expanse that reaches east from conservative-leaning suburbs such as Poway and Santee.\n\nVoter registration: 29.4% Democratic, 41.5% Republican, 21.0% no party preference\n\nThe Scoop\n\nPrimary results: Carl DeMaio: 42.9%, Andrew Hayes: 18.7%\n\nUnderpinning this race to succeed termed-out Assemblymember Marie Waldron is a fight over the future of California’s fading Republican Party. Andrew Hayes, the district director for Senate GOP leader Brian Jones, who represents the area, is the choice of the California and San Diego County GOP. But he received less than half as many votes in the primary as outspoken conservative activist and talk radio host Carl DeMaio, who is pitching himself to voters as an aggressive new model to revive the Republican brand. The showdown has already roiled the county GOP, which ousted its chairperson after she unsuccessfully tried to switch the party endorsement from Hayes to DeMaio. More than a third of voters picked a Democrat in the primary, a potentially decisive block that is up for grabs.\n\nKey Endorsements\n\nCarl DeMaio\n\nHoward Jarvis Taxpayers Association\n\nAndrew Hayes\n\nCalifornia Republican Party\n\nSan Diego County Republican Party\n\nPeace Officers Research Association of California\n\nCalifornia ProLife Council\n\nRelated News\n\nBack to top\n\nDistrict 76\n\nThe District\n\nClimbing from the northern tip of San Diego, through inland suburbs including Escondido and San Marcos, toward Camp Pendleton, this is politically moderate territory that has been steadily growing more Democratic.\n\nParty registration: 37.5% Democratic, 30.7% Republican, 24.6% no party preference\n\nThe Scoop\n\nPrimary results: Kristie Bruce-Lane: 49.5%, Darshana Patel: 34.2%\n\nAfter nearly losing his seat in the blue wave of 2018, Assemblymember Brian Maienschein defected to the Democratic Party, blaming the extreme positions and offensive conduct of then-President Donald Trump. Republicans want the district back, but were unable to dislodge Maienschein before he termed out this year. They may have a better shot now that there’s no incumbent. The GOP candidate — Kristie Bruce-Lane, who runs a nonprofit that assists homeless children who have been victims of domestic violence — lost to Maienschein by about 3 percentage points in 2022 and received nearly half the vote in the March primary. She will face Democrat Darshana Patel, a research scientist, who could benefit from growing enthusiasm among liberal voters after the Democratic Party switched presidential nominees.\n\nKey Endorsements\n\nDarshana Patel\n\nCA YIMBY\n\nPlanned Parenthood Action Fund of the Pacific Southwest\n\nCalifornia Teachers Association\n\nSierra Club California\n\nKristie Bruce-Lane\n\nNational Federation of Independent Business California\n\nCalifornia Hispanic Chambers of Commerce\n\nHoward Jarvis Taxpayers Association\n\nRelated News\n\nBack to top\n\nFree to read, but not free to produce\n\nWe’re CalMatters, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom for Californians.\n\nWe’re proud that our Voter Guide, which informs millions of people each election, is free for everyone.\n\nWe need your help to continue doing critical work that informs voters.\n\nIf you can, a modest donation will help us publish quality election information now.
