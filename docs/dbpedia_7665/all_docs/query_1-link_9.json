        "text": "I recently posted an essay about the history of Journalism/Photojournalism. It covers many of the linear advancements of the field, as well as the basis of news and targeted audiences. Fun fact: For stories to be considered newsworthy, news must fall under a certain subset of values. Values such as Impact, Immediacy, Proximity, Prominence, Novelty, Conflict and Emotions all affect stories and audiences differently. For more information visit the full article at the link below! #WSUpjHistory #Photojournalism #PhotojournalismHistory #History/1 https://lnkd.in/gcz7qwdX\n\nüì¢ The Directory of European Journalism Networks is now online! An extensive #directory of over 40 #journalismnetworks and collectives focused on collaborative and cross-border #journalism. If you‚Äôre part of a journalism network or collaboration, you can add your profile to highlight your work! ‚û°Ô∏èjournalismdirectory.org #Europe #collaborativejournalism #pressfreedom\n\nA Tip for Publicists: Do not message or email a journalist asking to get on a call before sending them a pitch. Journalists are super busy and will usually get on a call once a pitch has been accepted. When someone asks me to get on a call immediately I say no. When someone asks for an introduction to Forbes immediately I say no. I don‚Äôt want to waste my time‚Äî just email me a pitch. #journorequest #journalism #journalist #careeradvice #publicists #publicrelations #mediarelations #blacklinkedin #blackgirlmagic #blackexcellence\n\nExcited to have completed the \"How to Become a Purpose-Driven Journalist\" course and ready to apply these new skills to make a positive impact through my work! #journalism #purpose-driven #lifelonglearning#share_certificate #journalism.\n\nMy partners at Muck Rack recently published their annual State of PR Measurement report (see link in comments). Making a measurable impact is on everyone's agenda, and it's certainly important to us #PRpros! Muck Rack not only helps me connect with journalists to pitch story ideas, their reports throughout the year help me see trends in the PR and journalism professions that gives me context to my Champion the Cause client work. Thanks to Matthew Albasi for producing this report! #publicrelations #publicrelationsagency #journalism #journalismmatters #dataanalytics #datajournalism\n\nJournalists!
