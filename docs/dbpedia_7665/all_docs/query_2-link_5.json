        "text": "Orange County is home to approximately 3.2 million people, so it’s a nearly impossible task to choose .000039% of them to represent a year with so many incredible stories from such a diverse, vibrant community.\n\nNearly, but not impossible.\n\nWe at the Orange County Register relied on nominations from our loyal readers and our staff members who cover the county, and then we compiled our annual list of the 125 most influential people in the county.\n\nSome of them are obvious but certainly belong, though this might be Shohei Ohtani’s final appearance for a while; you might’ve read that he landed a job in Los Angeles. Others are influential out of the spotlight, but you brought them to our attention and now we want to make sure more people learn about them.\n\nAnd our list, of course, includes those who did whatever it takes to help those in need.\n\nBy the way, someone’s omission from the list doesn’t mean we think they lack influence, but we try to focus on people who made a difference in 2023 that should be acknowledged.\n\nHere are the 125 most influential people in Orange County for 2023:\n\nJoyce Ahn\n\nFollowing Councilmember Ahn’s proposal, the Buena Park CIty Council in October unanimously designated the Korean American neighborhood — the section of Beach Boulevard between Orangethorpe Avenue and Rosecrans Avenue in Buena Park — as Koreatown, making the city home to Orange County’s second Koreatown.\n\nAshleigh Aitken\n\nThe reader-nominated mayor of Anaheim worked to restore transparency and trust in Anaheim following an investigation into alleged corruption One reader said she helped point the city in the right direction after the “disastrous course” it had been on.\n\nTamara Alexander\n\nAlexander, co-director of the Mediation Clinic at Chapman’s Fowler School of Law, provides mediation services to families in crisis through OC Family Court. “She is extremely professional and empathetic, and is able to make the participants at the clinic heard and valued,” the reader who nominated her wrote.\n\nSylvia Alva\n\nAlva took over as Cal State Fullerton’s president in August, returning to the university where she landed her first teaching position after receiving her doctorate.
