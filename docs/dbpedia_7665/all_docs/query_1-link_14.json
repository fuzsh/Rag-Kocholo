        "text": "The quickest way to get caught up on the most important things happening today in Orange County.\n\nHello Orange County! Patch recognizes that, due to a technical error, you all received the Bedford, NH Daily rather than your own on Sunday morning. Patch again apologizes and has addressed the issue so, hopefully, this doesn't happen again.\n\nIn the meantime, your usual curator is off today, but I am here to fill in and keep you up-to-date on all of your local happenings. Please note that your newsletters may be a bit lighter during this period. Now, hereâ€™s what you need to know, in 5 minutes or less. â€” Nicole Fallon-Peek\n\nFirst, today's weather:\n\nAreas of low clouds, then sun.

Thanks to a change in the legal code, thereâ€™s a new investment Orange County residents need to know about. In fact, Bloomberg asked experts where theyâ€™d invest $100,000 right now and many of them chose it.\n\nThis may surprise you, but itâ€™s a fine art.\n\nGrowing your nest egg with art isnâ€™t new. Wealthy families like the Rockefellers have done it for centuries.\n\nHereâ€™s why:\n\nLow correlation to stocks according to Citi\n\nContemporary art historically returns 23.2% when inflation is >3%\n\nContemporary art prices outpaced the S&P 500 by 164% (1995-2021)\n\nTranslation: Art could be one of the best investments for uncertain times.\n\nLuckily for you, we found Masterworks.
