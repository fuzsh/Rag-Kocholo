We'd like viewers to be able to identify with the emotions displayed. There's no grand metaphor. Rather than unveiling a political message, we focused on telling a story that's easy to identify with.\"[21][22]\n\nOriginal soundtrack\n\n[edit]\n\nLove in the Moonlight\n\nOriginal SoundtrackSoundtrack album by\n\nVarious Artists\n\nReleasedOctober 27, 2016GenreSoundtrack, Ballad, PopLanguageKoreanLabelOU Entertainment\n\nNHN Bugs (Digital, CD)\n\nUniversal Music Group (CD)ProducerGaemi\n\nIn August 2016, OU Entertainment's Gaemi, real name Kang Dong-yoon, joined the project as music director.[23] Jinyoung, who plays Yoon-sung, composed and produced \"Misty Road\" sung by Ben.[24] \"My Person\", which lead actor Park finished recording in October 2016 was co-written by composer Kim Se-jin.[25] It topped Melon, Mnet, Bugs, olleh, Soribada, Genie, Naver and Monkey3 charts upon its release.[26][27]\n\nThe two-disc soundtrack album was released on October 27, 2016, and consists of 13 tracks including a humming version of \"Because I Miss You\", 13 instrumentals and three special background music created by folk-fusion band Second Moon.[28][29]\n\nThe drama marked the comeback of acclaimed balladeers Sung Si-kyung and Baek Ji-young after two years.[30][31][32]\n\nTrack list\n\n[edit]\n\nChart performance\n\n[edit]\n\nPress\n\n[edit]\n\nTitle Authors Publisher Publication Date ISBN Ref.
