        "text": "“Badland Hunters” is an enjoyable post-apocalyptic Korean film that could have been good if it had a better villain and fixed it’s pacing issues it had in the beginning. This Netflix film is still a lot of fun though with solid action and likeable characters in a fascinating post-apocalyptic world.\n\nThe film was directed by Heo Myung-haeng and written by Kim Bo-tong and Kwak Jae-min.\n\nThe story follows 2 wasteland hunters Nam-San (Ma Dong-seok) and Choi Ji-wan (Lee Jun-young) and their community in post-apocalyptic Seoul after an earthquake has destroyed the city.\n\nSPOILERS ahead\n\nThe Pros:\n\nThe Premise and World – The idea of of an earthquake causing the end of the world is interesting, especially in seeing how out of it comes communities built around past economic areas of Seoul such as the Bus District or the Apartments. The world feels fully realized and lived in with an economy based on trade for the good folks and raiding gangs for the bad people of this world.\n\nThe Main Characters – Nam-San is the best character and Ma Dong-seok of “Train to Busan” fame does an amazing job as an action star with a dark past. He guides Choi Ji-wan and leads the rescue after a mad scientist’s organization kills their friend’s Su-na’s grandmother. Su-na is a great protagonist too as she doesn’t fall for the traps set by the organization and nearly escapes but even after being captured sabotages the mad scientists plans since she didn’t drink the changed water. Roh Jeong-eui The supporting character of Lee Eun-ho is good too as a special forces soldier who escaped the Apartments after she discovered the experiments and killing of children the mad scientist and his people were doing. Ahn Ji-hye does a good job as Lee Eun-ho.\n\nThe Action – The action is the strongest part of this film with a lot of gun fights, knife fights and great use of environments for face-offs and battles. Our heroes face off against mutated humans who function like fast zombies and organized militia’s as they go to rescue Su-na and the other families at the Apartments. Nam-San has the best fight scenes and gets to face-off against the most difficult foes.\n\nThe Cons:\n\nThe Villain – The villain is a one-dimensional mad man experimenting on teenagers to bring his comatose daughter back to life. There is no complexity to this awful character and he doesn’t ham it up enough to be a compelling foe. He is easily the weakest part of the film as his introduction in the beginning isn’t needed for the plot and is part of the initial pacing issues the film faces.\n\nPacing – We start out before the Earthquake and learn the mad scientist is a serial killer killing teens to try and bring back his comatose daughter. The earthquake happens and we don’t see him again except as leader of the Apartments. After we spend some time in the wasteland village the hunters trade with and it takes a while for the plot to get started. Half of all this introduction could have been cut with the mad scientist story being cut completely so it is a mystery reveal for later on.\n\nIf you are looking for a fun action film to rent you should definitely check this one out on Netflix. Ma Dong-seok is a great lead and I plan to check out more of his films as I haven’t seen “Train to Busan.” This is a film that could have been more if it had fixed it’s pacing issues and been more of a mystery thriller in regards to the Apartment and mad scientist but it is still worth checking out.\n\nFinal Score: 7.5 / 10\n\n“JUNG_E” is a film that could have worked with a lot more narrative focus. It takes forever coming to the story that drives the pacing and has a lot of scenes that are just pointless. Suffice to say this film isn’t good and I’d only say it’s okay. I don’t recommend checking it out as there are better films that explore the same themes out there.\n\nThe film was directed and written by Yeon Sang-ho.\n\nIn the 22nd Century Kronoid is attempting to develop a combat A.I. of the mercenary hero Yun Jung-yi/JUNG_E (Kim Hyun-joo) with her daughter Yun Seo-hyun (Kang Soo-yeon) leading the project.\n\nSPOILERS ahead\n\nThe Pros:\n\nThe World and Diversity of A.I. – The world is fascinating with the civil war between the Adrian Republic and Allied Forces fighting the war with A.I. over the artificial structures above the Earth. It is a cool looking environment and the A.I. are diverse looking as well from humanoids to dog-like tanks.\n\nThe Mother and Daughter Relationship – The core relationship in the film that works is that between the mother and daughter. The mother Jung was critically injured and her mother gave her over to the corporations turning her into a combat A.I. for Kronoids. Her daughter the lead always wondered if her mom regretted having her and learns from the A.I. that her memories were always of love and feeling she failed her daughter as her daughter was going into surgery. This is all good but it takes forever to get to this core drama.\n\nThe Cons:\n\nUnfocused Script – We spend a lot of time seeing Kronoid putting JUNG_E through simulations and meeting with military leadership but not really getting to know the characters until much later. It feels like too much effort was put into telling us world building rather than showing us the world through the characters and this kept from from enjoying the film.\n\nPacing – As related to the unfocused script the pacing is really slow and doesn’t pick up until the story is mostly finished when we are finally given the core drama of the lead saving freeing the A.I. that holds her mother’s memories. That part is all good but it takes forever to get here when the first half of the film could have been summed up in 15 minutes.\n\nThis film was okay as I did like the world and core relationship, but pacing and an unfocused script kept from enjoying the film and it is what keeps me from recommending it too. In the end there are better films about A.I. and robots out there like “Blade Runner” and “Bicentennial Man” so check those films out instead.\n\nFinal Score: 6 / 10\n\n“Kill Boksoon” is a good action thriller that suffers from pacing issues in the first half but has really good payoff once the revenge part of the story kicks off. The actors all do a great job in the roles, and the story overall works. Suffice to say if you are looking for a good action film you should check this one out.\n\nThe film was written and directed by Byun Sung-hyun.\n\nThe story follows assassin Gil Bok-soon (Jeon Do-yeon) who works for the agency MK but finds herself questioning a contract.\n\nSPOILERS ahead\n\nThe Pros:\n\nThe Cinematography – Cho Hyung-rae’s cinematography is beautiful and gives the film an almost paintingesque feel at times, especially when Gil Bok-soon imagines how potential fight sequences can go and everything slows down. You fully see the effort put into the lighting and framing of the scenes and it is fantastic.\n\nThe Action – The action scenes are great in the most memorable fight being when Director Cha of MK calls a contract out on Gil Bok-soon for breaking her contract. She is fighting the people she thought were her friends and it is an intense scene as she is outnumbered. The opening fight with a Yakuza is good too as it intersperses flashbacks and swordplay.\n\nThe World – This is a world like “John Wick” where assassin companies control the world with MK being the largest one that set rules down that all of them are supposed to follow. Rules that Gil Bok-soon breaks when she breaks a contract. This is a world where all her friends are assassins too and because of that mortality is always on the line in interactions.\n\nThe Characters – The characters are all great with Director Cha being a vicious antagonist and her brother (the leader of MK) being torn between his care for his sister and love of Gil Bok-soon. There are also Gil Bok-soon’s friends and her lover all who end up turning on her. There is also her daughter too who has an arc of finding peace within herself and accepting herself as a lesbian as well as finally opening up to her mom. The characters are all memorable and work great in the film.\n\nGil Bok-soon – Gil Bok-soon is a great protagonist who is driven by wanting to avenge the innocent. As the contract she turns down because it involves killing a kid is fulfilled by her lover under orders from Director Cha. CEO Cha also later kills the MK intern friend she made who defended her from her former friends before she avenges her by killing both CEO Cha and Director Cha. Her arc is one of revenge but even in it we see her love and acceptance of her daughter and that empathy is driving her want to leave the assassin life.\n\nThe Cons:\n\nPacing – The first half of the film is really slow outside of the first initial fight scene, which keeps me from considering the film great. Some of the scenes could have been cut to speed up the story as the story itself is really good and this would have solved some of the pacing issues.\n\nIf you are looking for a good Netflix action thriller than I highly recommend checking this one out. This is a film that has a compelling story and characters and great action and cinematography to go along with it. This is well worth your time and I’m looking forward to seeing what director Byun Sung-hyun does next.\n\nFinal Score: 8.6 / 10\n\n“Thirst” is a film that nearly works. You have a unique take on vampires that is given to us and an exploration of ego, abuse and trauma. It feels like it is missing some parts both in the writing and characters that I will go into later. If you are a fan of Park Chan-wook’s work I would definitely recommend this film though.\n\nPark Chan-wook directed and co-wrote the screenplay along with Jeong Seo-kyeong.\n\nThe story follows priest Sang-hyun (Song Kang-ho) when he becomes a vampire after he volunteers to participate in an experiment to cure a deadly virus. From here his story unfolds when he reunites with his childhood friends and their family.\n\nSPOILERS ahead\n\nThe Pros:\n\nThe Cinematography – Chung Chung-hoon has an amazing eye for cinematography. He does a beautiful job of crafting the fairytale nature of how vampire powers are introduced and how the things like sunlight are used to hurt.\n\nThe Soundtrack – Jo Yeong-wook does a fantastic job giving us a haunting soundtrack that captures both the forbidden love story that the story initially starts out and the horror film it becomes. The music is largely calm and is reflective, which reflects Sang-hyun’s perspective really well.\n\nTae-ju – Tae-ju is the protagonists childhood friend who was forced into a relationship with her adopted brother after her parents abandoned her. This feeds her anger at her husband and her running out each night. Eventually she finds an escape through her relationship with Sang-hyun that escalates after they kill her husband and she is made a vampire. At that point she is acts mad and doesn’t care for anyone. The change is still drastic and not well done but\n\nSang-hyun – Sang-hyun is a priest who we see as being driven to help people but also extremely isolated and ruled by his guilt he carries. This comes to define his relationship as he only gets away from that guilt when he becomes a vampire though his core nature of wanting to help is still there. This changes when his romance with Tae-ju leads to his first murder and them becoming a horror couple when he turns her into a vampire too. In the end he burns down what others thought of him and leads himself and Tae-ju to die as the sun rises while leaving people around who know their crimes. The character almost works except him becoming rage and violence happens rather quickly and as a character I liked initially I hated him by the end and I think the arc of how he got there didn’t entirely make sense because of how Tae-ju was written.\n\nAn Exploration of Ego and Desire – Ego and desire are a core theme of the film that is explored through Sang-hyun and how characters egos tend to rise when they realize they can become powerful superhumans too if he gives them his blood. This is one thing that could have been explored better as the best example of this is his mentor’s corruption but there really aren’t that are as done as well.\n\nTrauma and Guilt – Trauma and guilt are the other theme and you can see that both Tae-ju and Sang-hyun are both driven by trauma and guilt from their childhood. Both were abandoned by their parents and you can see blame of themselves in the actions they do to themselves and that others do to them. If this had been better addressed in the film it could have made the film good or even great as addressing these is essential.\n\nThe Cons:\n\nThe Tae-ju Change – Tae-ju is clearly maligned and abused by the family she is part of through the first half of the film.\n\nAbuse Not Addressed – Tae-ju is abused within the text of the movie even if her husband never hit her. We see how she is mocked and made fun of and pushed around by her husband his friends as well as her mother-in-law. This is never addressed and not addressing this ruins the actions that happen later when the narrative is reframed against Tae-ju. Sang-hyun’s abuse is never addressed either. I hated it.\n\nGreed Defining Most Characters – Sang-hyun’s mentor goes to caring for him to wanting to be immortal and have his power and Sang-hyun goes from a caring person to a vile person and the same thing happens to Tae-ju. I can see this fitting an attempt at a theme but there isn’t enough set up early on to show that, so the character transformations come out of nowhere.\n\nFlat The Side Characters – Most of the supporting characters feel one dimensional as they so often turn out to be greedy or corrupt. There isn’t any nuance and it hurts the film. It doesn’t help that most of them lack any nuance too. They feel like archetypes rather than characters in a story.\n\n“Thirst” is a film that had a lot of potential. The drive of ego that ends up defining the characters really could have been setup better. This is a film that if it hadn’t started out setting up the protagonists as sympathetic in the beginning and radically changing them later, could have worked. This is still an enjoyable film though and it is nearly good.\n\nFinal Score: 7.8 / 10\n\n“Parasite” is a film that stays with you. This is a film that explores class in South Korea as well as the complicated nature of the human psyche. None of the characters you meet are really likable but they are compelling and I found myself drawn in through the entire film. I wanted to see what would happen next, and the film did not disappoint. This is an amazing thriller and the beautiful cinematography and soundtrack elevate it further. I definitely recommend this film.\n\nThe film was directed and co-written by Bong Joon-ho who co-wrote the story along with Han Jin-wan.\n\nThe story follows the Kim family who cons their way into fulfilling roles needed by the wealthy Park family. All is not as it appears to be though as the history of the house and the weaknesses into con begin to be revealed.\n\nSPOILERS ahead\n\nThe Pros:\n\nThe Cinematography – The cinematography is absolutely beautiful and does a good job of pulling you in. Light is used to illustrate tension or discomfort as even the Park household never feels fully lit. This does a great job of growing the tension between characters, be it love, friendship or distrust. The use of light and dark helps illustrate the class divide between the characters as well as the Park house is filmed primarily during the day, while the Kim house is filmed primarily at night. The areas that are darkest is the hidden basement which feels like a horror film in how it shot and it is here where the Climax of the film really begins. This area of the house is filmed in sickly yellows and greens. Hong Kyung-pyo did an amazing job.\n\nThe Soundtrack – The soundtrack like the cinematography keeps you drawn in. There are sharp string instruments used at certain points and most of the soundtrack gives a sense of foreboding and melancholy. This plays into the theme and feel of the film and elevates it. Jeong Jae-il’s composition is absolutely beautiful.\n\nThe Characters and Nuance – This is a film that is full of character nuance. Most of the characters are more complicated than they appear to be. The father from the Kim family Ki-taek forms a friendship with the wife of the Park family Yeon-gyo and seems to care about her more than her husband does. The Kim daughter Ki-jeong helps the Park boy Da-song who she is art teacher for to calm down and there are little moments like this between characters scattered through the film. It is beautifully done. I kind of hated most of the characters at first until I noticed that nuance, which makes the con falling apart all the more tragic as everyone in this film suffers or dies in the end when the con comes crashing down.\n\nDeconstructing Class – One of the lines in the film is that the Park family is kind because they are rich. There is truth to this in that they aren’t desperate to live so have formed relationships beyond survival, while the Kim families relationships are entirely based on eating and keeping their house. Why the class structure that exists is never explored but the consequence upon how people behave is. Desperation leads to selfishness and living well off can lead to a level of detachment.\n\nThe Ending – The climax starts when the former housekeeper returns after the Kim family is celebrating and drinking while the Park family is away. What we discover is her husband worked for the home’s prior owner and has gone insane. When the con is revealed the former housekeeper after the Kim mother refuses to help. This leads to the housekeeper ending up accidentally killed and her husband breaking out and attacking the Kim son and killing the Kim daughter. Kim Ki-taek kills the houskeeper’s husband and attacks the Park father after the Park father reacts to his “smell,” and escapes. After the Kim son Ki-woo recovers in the hospital he learns that his father survived and is living in the underground area where the housekeeper’s husband had been. He vows to earn money to get the house so that someday his father can be free and the story ends. There is so much that happens and it stays with you.\n\nThe Cons:\n\nBackstory and Motivation of the Mothers – I wanted more story on what had brought the Mothers to be in the situations they were in. The con mother Chung-sook used to be an athlete, but we don’t know why she is so harsh on the housekeeper. What drove her to be the meanest of her family? How did Yeon-gyo end up in the relationship with a husband who never admits to loving her? They both love their children and that clearly drives them, but I wanted more on how they came to be in the places they were. I feel like that would have defined more of the choices they make in the film.\n\nThis was a film I came to love the more I thought about it. The characters have nuance and humanity to them, even as they do horrible things and in the end there is growth for at least 2 of the family members who did the con as well. This film could have easily just clearly painted one side as wholly bad but it doesn’t. Instead you see what greed and desperation do to people as well as how money changes how people view one another. This is powerful and relevant and the only thing keeping it from getting a higher score is I wanted more backstory from the mothers. They really needed more development for what defined who they were.\n\nFinal Score: 9.8 / 10\n\nWe continue “Foreign Film Week” with “The Art of Fighting.” My friend described it as the a the Korean “Karate Kid” with more violence and that is an apt description. It is better than “Karate Kid” in a few ways too. For one it doesn’t idealize fighting, it shows the reasons why someone would fight and what it takes to win a fight. From here we are introduced to the two complex protagonists who drive the story and each of their reasons they choose to fight.\n\n“Art of Fighting” was directed by Shin Han-sol who was one of the writers along with Min Dong-hyun and produced by Lee Seo-yeol.\n\nThe story is about Byeong (Jae Hee) who is abused by Pako (Hong Seung-jin)and his gang at his technical high school and attempts to fight back only to beat down again and again. When he runs into a strange neighbor named Pan-su (Baek Yoon-sik) who is a fighter and possible ex-gangster who he convinces to train him. From here the story unfolds as his father tracks Pan-su and they deal with the threats from the gangs in the area.\n\nThe Pros: The Soundtrack – As someone who loves the soundtrack to fighting games like “Tekken.” There is a techno rhythm to many of the fight scene and montages and it adds a lot to the quality of the film.\n\nThe Action – The action is brutal and solid in this film, it reminds me a lot of an early Tarantino or Rodriguez film and it’s extremely raw. For example every fight is mortal and keeps going until a person is finally down. It’s doesn’t romanticize it because of how honest it is on how blood is part of a fight. This is one thing it really does well.\n\nPan-Su – The strange neighbor is a great character. He only starts training Byeong because Byeong is so insistent and is getting him free stuff. That is how their relationship starts with Byeong paying for all his meals and drinks but things change when Byeong shows how much he’s grown as a fighter and Pan-su has nothing for respect for him at the end realizing that Byeong now knows the cost of fighting (given that Pan-su is nearly killed by Paku and the Police).Baek Yoon-sik is wonderful in this role.\n\nJae-hoon – Jae-hoon is Byeong’s friends who ends up being killed by Pako because he stands up to Pako when the gang is picking on Byeong. His death is brutal but before that he is a really kind and tough guy who manages to beat one of the bullies a bit before Pako comes in. His death is a tragedy as he is someone just trying to look out for his friend. Park Ki-woong is wonderful in the role.\n\nByeong-tae – Jae Hee plays the main character in the film who is a man who lives in fear until he loses his best friend and is ready to use all the training Pan-su taught him. It’s a great process to watch and we see he is a stubborn kid who doesn’t give up no matter what he’s put through. He also doesn’t kill, which puts him above Pako and Pan-su. His arc is also reestablishing a relationship with his father which he is finally able to do when he has the confidence and stands up for himself against the bullies.\n\nThe Message – The message is that sometimes there is a time to fight (self-defense, defense of another) but you have to know the cost, people die (Jae-hoon) and get hurt (Pan-su) fights are never pretty and should always be a last resort. If you can scare your enemy and cause them to run away, that is what you do. That is one thing I really respected about this film. The message is great.\n\nOkay/Cons – The Cinematography – The cinematography is very hit or miss. At times the camera felt like it was fogged over and things weren’t clear while other times it felt home video like. For this reason it is hard to put it as pro or truly okay since there are some okay filmed moments but other times the poor quality clashes with it.\n\nThe Cons: The Bullies and Gangs- The bullies were just thugs (like in “Karate Kid”) and really had no motivation. At least the bully in “Karate Kid” was abused by his mentor and father, the same cannot be said about Pako who is mostly just motivated for revenge since Byeong’s father was the one who put him in prison.\n\nThis was a good film, but not a favorite. I disliked how simple the bullies were and how they weren’t complex at all and at times it lagged because of it because the bullies got so much screen time. I also wish we’d gotten to know Pan-su more as he was the most compelling character in the film. The lack of backstory being fully explored since it was so focused on Byeong made the film good but not great. Byeong’s character wasn’t enough to carry the film to make it a favorite or a great film, still he wasn’t bad so it was good.\n\nFinal Score: 8 / 10."
