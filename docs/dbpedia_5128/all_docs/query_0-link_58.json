        "text": "Characterization of the early pulmonary inflammatory response associated with PTFE fume exposure\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJohnston, C. J.; Finkelstein, J. N.; Gelein, R.; Baggs, R.; Oberdorster, G.; Clarkson, T. W. (Principal Investigator)\n\n1996-01-01\n\nHeating of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) has been described to release fumes containing ultrafine particles (approximately 18 nm diam). These fumes can be highly toxic in the respiratory tract inducing extensive pulmonary edema with hemorrhagic inflammation. Fischer-344 rats were exposed to PTFE fumes generated by temperatures ranging from 450 to 460 degrees C for 15 min at an exposure concentration of 5 x 10(5) particles/cm3, equivalent to approximately 50 micrograms/m3. Responses were examined 4 hr post-treatment when these rats demonstrated 60-85% neutrophils (PMNs) in their lung lavage. Increases in abundance for messages encoding the antioxidants manganese superoxide dismutase and metallothionein (MT) increased 15- and 40-fold, respectively. For messages encoding the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines: inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin 1 alpha, 1 beta, and 6 (IL-1 alpha, IL-1 beta, and IL-6), macrophage inflammatory protein-2, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF alpha) increases of 5-, 5-, 10-, 40-, 40-, and 15-fold were present. Vascular endothelial growth factor, which may play a role in the integrity of the endothelial barrier, was decreased to 20% of controls. In situ sections were hybridized with 33P cRNA probes encoding IL-6, MT, surfactant protein C, and TNF alpha. Increased mRNA abundance for MT and IL-6 was expressed around all airways and interstitial regions with MT and IL-6 demonstrating similar spatial distribution. Large numbers of activated PMNs expressed IL-6, MT, and TNF alpha. Additionally, pulmonary macrophages and epithelial cells were actively involved. These observations support the notion that PTFE fumes containing ultrafine particles initiate a severe inflammatory response at low inhaled particle mass concentrations, which is suggestive of an oxidative injury. Furthermore, PMNs may actively regulate the inflammatory process through cytokine and antioxidant expression.\n\nPulmonary effects induced by ultrafine PTFE particles.\n\nPubMed\n\nJohnston, C J; Finkelstein, J N; Mercer, P; Corson, N; Gelein, R; OberdÃ¶rster, G\n\n2000-11-01\n\nPTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) fumes consisting of large numbers of ultrafine (uf) particles and low concentrations of gas-phase compounds can cause severe acute lung injury. Our studies were designed to test three hypotheses: (i) uf PTFE fume particles are causally involved in the induction of acute lung injury, (ii) uf PTFE elicit greater pulmonary effects than larger sized PTFE accumulation mode particles, and (iii) preexposure to the uf PTFE fume particles will induce tolerance. We used uf Teflon (PTFE) fumes (count median particle size approximately 16 nm) generated by heating PTFE in a tube furnace to 486 degrees C to evaluate principles of ultrafine particle toxicity. Teflon fumes at ultrafine particle concentrations of 50 microg/m(3) were extremely toxic to rats when inhaled for only 15 min. We found that when generated in argon, the ultrafine Teflon particles alone are not toxic at these exposure conditions; neither were Teflon fume gas-phase constituents when generated in air. Only the combination of both phases when generated in air caused high toxicity, suggesting either the existence of radicals on the surface or a carrier mechanism of the ultrafine particles for adsorbed gas compounds. Aging of the fresh Teflon fumes for 3.5 min led to a predicted coagulation to >100 nm particles which no longer caused toxicity in exposed animals. This result is consistent with a greater toxicity of ultrafine particles compared to accumulation mode particles, although changes in particle surface chemistry during the aging process may have contributed to the diminished toxicity. Furthermore, the pulmonary toxicity of the ultrafine Teflon fumes could be prevented by adapting the animals with short 5-min exposures on 3 days prior to a 15-min exposure. Messages encoding antioxidants and chemokines were increased substantially in nonadapted animals, yet were unaltered in adapted animals. This study shows the importance of preexposure history for the susceptibility to acute\n\nCognitive symptoms and welding fume exposure.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoss, John A S; Macdiarmid, Jennifer I; Semple, Sean; Watt, Stephen J; Moir, Gill; Henderson, George\n\n2013-01-01\n\nPrevalence of moderate to severe cognitive symptoms is markedly higher in UK professional divers who have also worked as a welder (28%) than in either divers who have not welded (18%) or offshore workers who have worked neither as a diver nor as a welder (6%). To determine whether cognitive symptoms are related to welding fume exposure or diving. Three age-matched groups of male workers were studied using postal questionnaire: professional divers who had worked as a welder (PDW, n = 361), professional welders who had not dived (NDW, n = 352), and offshore oil field workers who had neither dived nor welded (NDNW, n =503). Health-related quality of life was assessed by the Short Form 12 questionnaire (SF12). Cognitive symptomatology was assessed using the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ). A single variable for welding fume exposure (mg m(-3) days) was calculated, incorporating welding experience in different environments and using different welding techniques and respiratory protective equipment. The level of fume exposure during hyperbaric welding operations was measured during such work as ambient PM(10) (particles of 10 Âµm or less). Diving exposure was assessed as the number of dives performed plus the number of days spent working during saturation diving. Questionnaires were returned by 153 PDW, 108 NDW, and 252 NDNW. SF12 scores were the same in all groups and fell within normative values. Mean (95% CI) CFQ scores were higher in PDW [40.3 (37.7-42.9)] than in both NDW [34.6 (31.6-37.7)] and NDNW [32.1 (30.4-33.9)], but the scores in no groups fell outside the normative range. The mean PM(10) exposure during hyperbaric welding operations was 2.58 mg m(-3). The geometric mean mg m(-3) days (95% CI) for welding fume exposure in NDW [33 128 (24 625-44 567) n = 85] was higher than for that in PDW [10 904 (8103-14 673) n = 112]. For PDW the geometric mean (95% CI) diving exposure was 1491 [(1192-1866) n = 94] dives and days in saturation.

Welding fumes are suspected to accelerate the decline of lung function and development of COPD. To examine the relationship between welding fume exposure and COPD in Korean shipyard welders. The study involved a group of male welders working at two shipyards who underwent an annual health examination in 2010. Subjects completed a questionnaire about smoking habits and occupational history and a pulmonary function test (PFT) was carried out with strict quality control measures. Welding fume exposure concentrations were estimated using 884 measurements taken between 2002 and 2009 in one of the shipyards. Multiple linear and logistic regression was employed to evaluate the association between cumulative fume exposure and lung function parameters, controlling for age, height and cigarette smoking. Two hundred and forty subjects participated, with a mean age of 48 and mean work duration of 15 years. The mean cumulative fume exposure was 7.7mg/m(3). The prevalence of COPD was 15%. FEV1 and FVC showed non-significant negative correlations with cumulative fume exposure. Odds ratios of COPD were significantly elevated for the middle (3.9; 95% CI 1.4-13.3) and high exposure groups (3.8; 95% CI 1.03-16.2) compared with the low fume exposure group. Our findings support an association between welding fume exposure and increased risk of COPD. Further prospective study is needed to investigate whether this is a causal relationship.

To characterize the nature of the pulmonary fibrosis that develops in response to steel welding fume exposure and to provide a working hypothesis that would explain the findings of the existing research, to provide a platform for future research and to inform future occupational and clinical management of welders with pulmonary effects from welding fume. Review of the world literature on pulmonary fibrosis and welding of steel in all languages using PubMed, with further secondary search of references in the articles found in the primary search. Google and Reference Manager were used as further confirmatory search tools. Only case series and case reports were found but these provided consistent evidence that the consequence of exposure to steel welding fume at high levels for a prolonged period of time is a type of pulmonary fibrosis similar to, and possibly the same as, respiratory bronchiolitis which eventually develops into desquamative interstitial pneumonia with ongoing exposure. Steel welding fume may cause an occupational respiratory bronchiolitis which may develop into de squamative interstitial pneumonia with ongoing exposure. This concept may explain the difficulties in interpreting the wider literature on welding fume and lung function at lower exposures and may also explain the increased risk of lung cancer in welders.

Methacholine and welding challenge tests were carried out. The concentration of welding fumes during the exposure test was measured. On two subjects who developed bronchoconstricition to welding challenge, additional tests were carried out including prick, patch, and inhalation challenges with metal salt solutions. Three subjects developed immediate bronchial reaction to exposure to welding fume; one to mild steel and stainless steel welding, another to mild steel and galvanised welding, and one only to galvanised welding. They all had a moderate to pronounced degree of non-specific bronchial hyperresponsiveness. The concentration of fumes during welding tests, particularly to galvanised welding, was high. An inhalation challenge test with zinc chloride salt solution in two subjects who reacted to galvanised welding was negative. Prick and patch tests with zinc chloride were also negative. The airway response to welding in these subjects is non-specific and is due to irritation rather than to sensitisation.\n\nRecovery from welding-fume-exposure-induced MRI T1 signal intensities after cessation of welding-fume exposure in brains of cynomolgus monkeys.\n\nPubMed\n\nHan, Jeong Hee; Chung, Yong Hyun; Park, Jung Duck; Kim, Choong Yong; Yang, Seoung Oh; Khang, Hyun Soo; Cheong, Hae Kwan; Lee, Jong Seong; Ha, Chang Soo; Song, Chang-Woo; Kwon, Il Hoon; Sung, Jae Hyuck; Heo, Jeong Doo; Kim, Na-Young; Huang, Mingai; Cho, Myung Haing; Yu, Il Je\n\n2008-09-01\n\nThe shortening of the MRI T1 relaxation time, indicative of a high signal intensity in a T1-weighted MRI, is known as a useful biomarker for Mn exposure after short-term welding-fume exposure. A previous monkey experimental study found that the T1 relaxation times decreased time-dependently after exposure, and a visually detectable high signal intensity appeared after 150 days of exposure. The nadir for the shortening of the T1 relaxation time was also previously found to correspond well with the blood Mn concentration in welders, suggesting a correlation between a prolonged high blood Mn concentration and shortened T1 relaxation time. Accordingly, to clarify the clearance of the brain Mn concentration after the cessation of welding-fume exposure, cynomolgus monkeys were assigned to 3 groups-unexposed, low dose (31 mg/m(3) total suspended particulate (TSP), 0.9 mg Mn/m(3)), and high dose (62 mg/m(3) TSP, 1.95 mg Mn/m(3))-and exposed to manual metal-arc stainless steel (MMA-SS) welding fumes for 2 h per day for 8 mo in an inhalation chamber system equipped with an automatic fume generator. After reaching the peak MRI T1 signal intensity (shortest T1 relaxation time), the monkeys were allowed to recover by ceasing the welding-fume exposure. Within 2 mo, the MRI T1 signal intensities for the exposed monkeys returned to nearly the same level as those for the unexposed monkeys, indicating the potential for recovery from a high MRI T1 signal intensity induced by welding-fume exposure, even after prolonged exposure. Clearance of the Mn tissue concentration was also demonstrated in the globus pallidus, plus other tissues from the brain, liver, spleen, and blood. In contrast, there was no clearance of the lung concentrations of Mn, indicating that a soluble form of Mn was transported to the blood and brain. Therefore, the solubility of Mn in welding fumes would appear to be an important determinant as regards the retention of blood Mn levels and brain tissue Mn\n\nBronchial reactions to exposure to welding fumes.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nContreras, G R; Chan-Yeung, M\n\n1997-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVES: To study the airway response and its mechanism to welding fumes in six welders with respiratory symptoms.

However, this study investigated the recovery after recurrent exposure to welding fumes, as welders are invariably re-exposed to welding fumes after recovering from radiographic pneumoconiosis. Thus, to investigate the disease and recovery processes of welding-fume-induced pneumoconiosis in the case of recurrent welding-fume exposure, rats were exposed to manual metal arc-stainless steel (MMA-SS) welding fumes with a total suspended particulate (TSP) concentration of 51.4 +/- 2.8 mg/m(3) (low dose) or 84.6 +/- 2.9 mg/m(3) (high dose) for 2 h/day in an inhalation chamber for 1 mo and then allowed to recover from the inflammation for 1 mo. Thereafter, the rats were exposed again to MMA-SS with a TSP concentration of 44.1 +/- 8.8 mg/m(3) (low dose) or 80.1 +/- 9.8 mg/m(3) (high dose) for another 30 d and then allowed to recover from the inflammation for 1 mo. The recovery from the first exposure was then compared with that from the second exposure. The first and second exposures to MMA-SS welding fumes were found to produce significant increases in the lung weights and inflammatory parameters, including total cell numbers, alveolar macrophages (AMs), polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), lymphocytes, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) when compared with the unexposed controls. Following the first and second recovery, a significant reduction in inflammatory parameters of BALF was observed between the exposure and recovery groups. Histopathological observations showed foamy or pigmented macrophage accumulation, cellular debris, or pigment from burst macrophages after the first or second exposure. Following the first or second recovery, cellular debris or pigment from burst macrophages was cleared away from the lungs and accumulation of foamy or pigmented macrophages was decreased when\n\nGenotoxic Effects of Exposure to Gasoline Fumes on Petrol Pump Workers.\n\nPubMed\n\nShaikh, Amrin; Barot, Darshana; Chandel, Divya\n\n2018-04-01\n\nPetrol pump workers are occupationally exposed to gasoline and its fumes consisting of several mutagenic chemicals. To evaluate the genotoxic effects of exposure to gasoline fumes on petrol pump workers. The study groups included 70 petrol pump workers (exposed group) and 70 healthy age-matched individuals with no known exposure (comparison group). Buccal micronucleus cytome assay (BMCyt) was performed to check the genotoxicity caused due to inhalation of gasoline fumes. The frequencies of micronucleated cells, nuclear bud, condensed chromatin cells, karyorrhectic cells, pyknotic cells, and karyolytic cells were significantly higher in the exposed workers compared to the comparison group. Exposure to gasoline fumes is associated with increased frequency of cell abnormalities. This may lead to various health consequences including cancer in those occupationally exposed to gasoline fumes.\n\nEFFECTS OF TRITIUM EXPOSURE ON UHMW-PE, PTFE, AND VESPEL\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nClark, E; Kirk Shanahan, K\n\n2006-05-31\n\nSamples of three polymers, Ultra-High Molecular Weight Polyethylene (UHMW-PE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE, also known as Teflon{reg_sign}), and Vespel{reg_sign} polyimide were exposed to 1 atmosphere of tritium gas at ambient temperature for varying times up to 2.3 years in closed containers. Sample mass and size measurements (to calculate density), spectra-colorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) were employed to characterize the effects of tritium exposure on these samples. Changes of the tritium exposure gas itself were characterized at the end of exposure by measuring total pressure and by mass spectroscopic analysis of the gas composition. None of the polymersmoreÂ Â» exhibited significant changes of density. The color of initially white UHMW-PE and PTFE dramatically darkened to the eye and the color also significantly changed as measured by colorimetry. The bulk of UHMW-PE darkened just like the external surfaces, however the fracture surface of PTFE appeared white compared to the PTFE external surfaces. The white interior could have been formed while the sample was breaking or could reflect the extra tritium dose at the surface directly from the gas. The dynamic mechanical response of UHMW-PE was typical of radiation effects on polymers- an initial stiffening (increased storage modulus) and reduction of viscous behavior after three months exposure, followed by lowering of the storage modulus after one year exposure and longer. The storage modulus of PTFE increased through about nine months tritium exposure, then the samples became too weak to handle or test using DMA. Characterization of Vespel{reg_sign} using DMA was problematic--sample-to-sample variations were significant and no systematic change with tritium exposure could be discerned. Isotopic exchange and incorporation of tritium into UHMW-PE (exchanging for protium) and into PTFE (exchanging for fluorine) was observed by FT-IR using an\n\nMetal fume fever and polymer fume fever.\n\nPubMed\n\nGreenberg, Michael I; Vearrier, David\n\n2015-05-01\n\nInhalational exposure to metal-containing fumes generated by welding and related processes may result in the development of the clinical syndrome known as \"metal fume fever.\" Polymer fume fever is a separate and distinct but related disorder that has been associated with inhalational exposure to specific fluorinated polymer products, such as polytetrafluoroethylene or Teflon(Â®). We undertook a review of the peer-reviewed medical literature as it relates to these two disease entities in order to describe their epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and prognosis. We performed a search of the PubMed ( www.pubmed.com ) and Ovid MEDLINE (ovidsp.tx.ovid.com) databases for keywords \"metal fume fever,\" \"polymer fume fever,\" and \"fume fever,\" covering the period 1946 to September 2014, which resulted in a total of 141 citations. Limiting the search to articles published in the English language yielded 115 citations. These 115 articles were manually reviewed for relevance. In addition, the reference lists in each article retrieved were reviewed for additional relevant references. This left 48 relevant citations. Metal fume fever occurs most commonly as an occupational disease in individuals who perform welding and other metal-joining activities for a living. It is estimated that 1,500-2,500 cases of metal fume fever occur annually in the United States. Polymer fume fever was initially identified as an occupational disease but increased regulations have resulted in decreased incidence in the occupational setting. Overheating of Teflon(Â®)-coated cookware is one of the more common mechanisms for exposure. While the precise pathophysiology associated with the development of metal fume fever is yet to be elucidated, suggested pathophysiologic mechanisms include pro-inflammatory cytokine release, neutrophil activation, and oxygen radical formation. The pathophysiologic mechanism for polymer fume fever has not been definitively\n\nInflammatory and genotoxic responses during 30-day welding-fume exposure period.\n\nPubMed\n\nYu, Il Je; Song, Kyung Seuk; Maeng, Seung Hee; Kim, Soo Jin; Sung, Jae Hyuck; Han, Jeong Hee; Chung, Yong Hyun; Cho, Myung Haing; Chung, Kyu Hyuck; Han, Kuy Tae; Hyun, Jin Sook; Kim, Kwang Jong\n\n2004-12-01\n\nWelder's pneumoconiosis has generally been determined to be benign and unassociated with respiratory symptoms based on the absence of pulmonary-function abnormalities in welders with marked radiographic abnormalities. In previous studies, the current authors suggested a three-phase lung fibrosis process to study the pathological process of lung fibrosis and found that the critical point for recovery was after 30 days of welding-fume exposure at a high dose, at which point early and delicate fibrosis was observed in the perivascular and peribronchiolar regions. Accordingly, the current study investigated the inflammatory and genotoxic responses during a 30-day period of welding-fume exposure to elucidate the process of fibrosis. As such, rats were exposed to manual metal arc-stainless steel (MMA-SS) welding fumes at concentrations of 65.6 +/- 2.9 (low dose) and 116.8 +/- 3.9 mg/m3 (high dose) total suspended particulate for 2 h per day in an inhalation chamber for 30 days. Animals were sacrificed after the initial 2 h exposure, and after 15 and 30 days of exposure. The rats exposed to the welding fumes exhibited a statistically significant (P < 0.05) decrease in body weight when compared to the control during the 30-day exposure period, yet an elevated cellular differential count and higher levels of albumin, LDH, and beta-NAG, but not elevated TNF-alpha, and IL-1beta in the acellular bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In addition, the DNA damage resulting from 30 days of welding-fume exposure was confirmed by a comet assay and the inmmunohistochemistry for 8-hydroxydeoxyguanine (8-OH-dG). Consequently, the elevated inflammatory and genotoxic indicators confirmed the lung injury and inflammation caused by the MMA-SS welding-fume exposure.\n\nInflammatory Markers in Blood and Exhaled Air after Short-Term Exposure to Cooking Fumes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSvedahl, Sindre Rabben\n\n2013-01-01\n\nObjectives: Cooking fumes contain aldehydes, alkanoic acids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and heterocyclic compounds. The inhalation of cooking fumes entails a risk of deleterious health effects. The aim of this study was to see if the inhalation of cooking fumes alters the expression of inflammatory reactions in the bronchial mucosa and its subsequent systemic inflammatory response in blood biomarkers. Methods: Twenty-four healthy volunteers stayed in a model kitchen on two different occasions for 2 or 4h. On the first occasion, there was only exposure to normal air, and on the second, there was exposure to controlled levels of cooking fumes. On each occasion, samples of blood, exhaled air, and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) were taken three times in 24h and inflammatory markers were measured from all samples. Results: There was an increase in the concentration of the d-dimer in blood from 0.27 to 0.28mg mlâ1 on the morning after exposure to cooking fumes compared with the levels the morning before (P-value = 0.004). There was also a trend of an increase in interleukin (IL)-6 in blood, ethane in exhaled air, and IL-1Î² in EBC after exposure to cooking fumes. In a sub-analysis of 12 subjects, there was also an increase in the levels of ethaneâfrom 2.83 parts per billion (ppb) on the morning before exposure to cooking fumes to 3.53 ppb on the morning after exposure (P = 0.013)âand IL-1Î²âfrom 1.04 on the morning before exposure to cooking fumes to 1.39 pg mlâ1 immediately after (P = 0.024). Conclusion: In our experimental setting, we were able to unveil only small changes in the levels of inflammatory markers in exhaled air and in blood after short-term exposure to moderate concentrations of cooking fumes.

The system consisted of a plasma flame metal sprayer as a fume generator, a granular bed type fume collector, a fluidized bed aerosol generator, an exposure and a control chamber of a horizontal-flow type and inhalant monitoring and controlling units. Performance of the chambers was ensured by a distribution test using flyash as a test aerosol. Using this system, rats were exposed to chromium fumes for one week or to nickel fumes for two months. The exposure concentrations of the chromium and nickel fumes were 1.85 +/- 0.55 mg/m3 and 0.51 +/- 0.15 mg/m3 (mean +/- SD), near the target levels of 2 mg/m3 and 0.5 mg/m3, respectively. The mass median aerodynamic diameter and the geometric standard deviation of the chromium fumes were 2.1 microns and 2.00, respectively. Those of the nickel fumes were 3.7 microns and 1.74, respectively. Species analysis of these fume particles revealed that 26.4% of the total chromium was hexavalent and the residue was trivalent and that 1-3% of the total nickel was nickel(III) and the residue was nickel(II). Inhaled-metal concentrations in the lungs showed steady increases with the exposure periods and were within the normal range of variation. On the basis of these results, it is concluded that this system is useful for long-term inhalation experiments using high melting point metal fumes.\n\nExposure to Inhalable, Respirable, and Ultrafine Particles in Welding Fume\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPesch, Beate\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis investigation aims to explore determinants of exposure to particle size-specific welding fume. Area sampling of ultrafine particles (UFP) was performed at 33 worksites in parallel with the collection of respirable particles. Personal sampling of respirable and inhalable particles was carried out in the breathing zone of 241 welders. Median mass concentrations were 2.48 mg mâ3 for inhalable and 1.29 mg mâ3 for respirable particles when excluding 26 users of powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs). Mass concentrations were highest when flux-cored arc welding (FCAW) with gas was applied (median of inhalable particles: 11.6 mg mâ3). Measurements of particles were frequently below the limit of detection (LOD), especially inside PAPRs or during tungsten inert gas welding (TIG). However, TIG generated a high number of small particles, including UFP. We imputed measurements exposure to welding fume. Concentrations were mainly predicted by the welding process and were significantly higher when local exhaust ventilation (LEV) was inefficient or when welding was performed in confined spaces. Substitution of high-emission techniques like FCAW, efficient LEV, and using PAPRs where applicable can reduce exposure to welding fume. However, harmonizing the different exposure metrics for UFP (as particle counts) and for the respirable or inhalable fraction of the welding fume (expressed as their mass) remains challenging.

However, harmonizing the different exposure metrics for UFP (as particle counts) and for the respirable or inhalable fraction of the welding fume (expressed as their mass) remains challenging.\n\nDNA strand breakage and lipid peroxidation after exposure to welding fumes in vivo.\n\nPubMed\n\nChuang, Cheng-Hung; Huang, Chong-En; Chen, Hsiu-Ling\n\n2010-01-01\n\nA remarkable number of complex aerosols are generated from welding processes. The objective of this study was to compare DNA damage and lipid peroxidation in plasma and in lung and in liver tissue of rats exposed to welding fumes in an exposure chamber with those of control animals. Three air samples from the chamber were also collected to assess the exposure dose for each exposure (total samplings = 18). Eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to welding fumes at a concentration of 1540.76 mg/m(3) for 10 min/day six times on day 1, day 3, day 7, day 15, day 30 and day 40. Lung, liver and kidney injury was measured following exposure, as well as in unexposed control rats (n = 4 at the beginning of the study). DNA strand breakage [tail moment (TMOM)] in exposed animals showed significant differences at day 1, day 4, day 7 and day 15 relative to the levels in control animals. Malondialdehyde (MDA, a lipid peroxidation product) levels increased gradually post-welding to 0.4 microM at 7 days. MDA and TMOM both reached maximum levels 7 days after the first exposure. At the start, an increasing trend in DNA strand breakage was more obvious than increases in MDA levels; MDA seemed to reflect long-term effects of exposure to welding fumes since it increased after 7 days and was sustained to 40 days in vivo. Significant differences in both MDA levels and DNA strand breakage were seen in lung, liver and kidney 40 days after the first fume inhalation. We conclude that acute exposure of rats to welding fumes causes noticeable oxidative damage and lipid peroxidation effects and that DNA damage may recover after long and repeat exposure. More chronic inhalation and low-dose studies are needed in order to further assess the effects of inhalation of welding fumes on DNA and to elucidate the possible causal mechanisms associated with the biologically damaging effects of welding fumes.\n\nSummary of retrospective asbestos and welding fume exposure estimates for a nuclear naval shipyard and their correlation with radiation exposure estimates.\n\nPubMed\n\nZaebst, D D; Seel, E A; Yiin, J H; Nowlin, S J; Chen, P\n\n2009-07-01\n\nIn support of a nested case-control study at a U.S. naval shipyard, the results of the reconstruction of historical exposures were summarized, and an analysis was undertaken to determine the impact of historical exposures to potential chemical confounders. The nested case-control study (N = 4388) primarily assessed the relationship between lung cancer and external ionizing radiation. Chemical confounders considered important were asbestos and welding fume (as iron oxide fume), and the chromium and nickel content of welding fume. Exposures to the potential confounders were estimated by an expert panel based on a set of quantitatively defined categories of exposure. Distributions of the estimated exposures and trends in exposures over time were examined for the study population. Scatter plots and Spearman rank correlation coefficients were used to assess the degree of association between the estimates of exposure to asbestos, welding fume, and ionizing radiation. Correlation coefficients were calculated separately for 0-, 15-, 20-, and 25-year time-lagged cumulative exposures, total radiation dose (which included medical X-ray dose) and occupational radiation dose. Exposed workers' estimated cumulative exposures to asbestos ranged from 0.01 fiber-days/cm(3) to just under 20,000 fiber-days/cm(3), with a median of 29.0 fiber-days/cm(3). Estimated cumulative exposures to welding fume ranged from 0.16 mg-days/m(3) to just over 30,000 mg-days/m(3), with a median of 603 mg-days/m(3). Spearman correlation coefficients between cumulative radiation dose and cumulative asbestos exposures ranged from 0.09 (occupational dose) to 0.47 (total radiation dose), and those between radiation and welding fume from 0.14 to 0.47. The estimates of relative risk for ionizing radiation and lung cancer were unchanged when lowest and highest estimates of asbestos and welding fume were considered. These results suggest a fairly large proportion of study population workers were exposed to\n\nEstimation of regional pulmonary deposition and exposure for fumes from SMAW and GMAW mild and stainless steel consumables.\n\nPubMed\n\nHewett, P\n\n1995-02-01\n\nThe particle size distributions and bulk fume densities for mild steel and stainless steel welding fumes generated using two welding processes (shielded metal arc welding [SMAW] and gas metal arc welding [GMAW]) were used in mathematical models to estimate regional pulmonary deposition (the fraction of each fume expected to deposit in each region of the pulmonary system) and regional pulmonary exposure (the fraction of each fume expected to penetrate to each pulmonary region and would be collected by a particle size-selective sampling device). Total lung deposition for GMAW fumes was estimated at 60% greater than that of SMAW fumes. Considering both the potential for deposition and the fume specific surface areas, it is likely that for equal exposure concentrations GMAW fumes deliver nearly three times the particle surface area to the lungs as SMAW fumes. This leads to the hypothesis that exposure to GMAW fumes constitutes a greater pulmonary hazard than equal exposure to SMAW fumes. The implications of this hypothesis regarding the design of future health studies of welders is discussed.\n\nEffects of Exposure to Welding Fume on Lung Function: Results from the German WELDOX Study.\n\nPubMed\n\nLehnert, M; Hoffmeyer, F; Gawrych, K; Lotz, A; Heinze, E; Berresheim, H; Merget, R; Harth, V; Van Gelder, R; Hahn, J-U; Hartwig, A; WeiÃ, T; Pesch, B; BrÃ¼ning, T\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe association between exposure to welding fume and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been insufficiently clarified. In this study we assessed the influence of exposure to welding fume on lung function parameters. We investigated forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), FEV1/FVC, and expiratory flow rates in 219 welders. We measured current exposure to respirable particles and estimated a worker's lifetime exposure considering welding techniques, working conditions and protective measures at current and former workplaces. Multiple regression models were applied to estimate the influence of exposure to welding fume, age, and smoking on lung function. We additionally investigated the duration of working as a welder and the predominant welding technique. The findings were that age- and smoking-adjusted lung function parameters showed no decline with increasing duration, current exposure level, and lifetime exposure to welding fume. However, 15% of the welders had FEV1/FVC below the lower limit of normal, but we could not substantiate the presence of an association with the measures of exposure. Adverse effects of cigarette smoking were confirmed. In conclusion, the study did not support the notion of a possible detrimental effect of exposure to welding fume on lung function in welders.\n\nPersonal exposure to metal fume, NO2, and O3 among production welders and non-welders.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchoonover, Todd; Conroy, Lorraine; Lacey, Steven; Plavka, Julie\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to characterize personal exposures to welding-related metals and gases for production welders and non-welders in a large manufacturing facility. Welding fume metals and irritant gases nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and ozone (O(3)) were sampled for thirty-eight workers. Personal exposure air samples for welding fume metals were collected on 37 mm open face cassettes and nitrogen dioxide and ozone exposure samples were collected with diffusive passive samplers. Samples were analyzed for metals using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and welding fume metal exposure concentrations were defined as the sum of welding-related metals mass per volume of air sampled. Welding fume metal exposures were highly variable among similar types of welding while NO(2) and O(3) exposure were less variable. Welding fume metal exposures were significantly higher 474 Î¼g/m(3) for welders than non-welders 60 Î¼g/m(3) (p=0.001). Welders were exposed to higher concentrations of NO(2) and O(3) than non-welders but the differences were not statistically significant. Welding fume metal exposure concentrations for welders performing gas metal arc welding (GMAW) and shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) were higher than welders performing gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW). Non-welders experienced exposures similar to GTAW welders despite a curtain wall barrier separating welding and non-welding work areas.\n\nReduction of Biomechanical and Welding Fume Exposures in Stud Welding\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFethke, Nathan B.; Peters, Thomas M.; Leonard, Stephanie; Metwali, Mahmoud; Mudunkotuwa, Imali A.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe welding of shear stud connectors to structural steel in construction requires a prolonged stooped posture that exposes ironworkers to biomechanical and welding fume hazards. In this study, biomechanical and welding fume exposures during stud welding using conventional methods were compared to exposures associated with use of a prototype system that allowed participants to weld from an upright position. The effect of base material (i.e. bare structural beam versus galvanized decking) on welding fume concentration (particle number and mass), particle size distribution, and particle composition was also explored. Thirty participants completed a series of stud welding simulations in a local apprenticeship training facility. Use of the upright system was associated with substantial reductions in trunk inclination and the activity levels of several muscle groups. Inhalable mass concentrations of welding fume (averaged over ~18min) when using conventional methods were high (18.2mg mâ3 for bare beam; 65.7mg mâ3 for through deck), with estimated mass concentrations of iron (7.8mg mâ3 for bare beam; 15.8mg mâ3 for through deck), zinc (0.2mg mâ3 for bare beam; 15.8mg mâ3 for through deck), and manganese (0.9mg mâ3 for bare beam; 1.5mg mâ3 for through deck) often exceeding the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists Threshold Limit Values (TLVs). Number and mass concentrations were substantially reduced when using the upright system, although the total inhalable mass concentration remained above the TLV when welding through decking. The average diameters of the welding fume particles for both bare beam (31Â±17nm) through deck conditions (34Â±34nm) and the chemical composition of the particles indicated the presence of metallic nanoparticles. Stud welding exposes ironworkers to potentially high levels of biomechanical loading (primarily to the low back) and welding fume. The upright system used in this study improved exposure levels during\n\nHome cage locomotor changes in non-human primates after prolonged welding-fume exposure.\n\nPubMed\n\nKim, Choong Yong; Sung, Jae Hyuck; Chung, Yong Hyun; Park, Jung Duck; Han, Jeong Hee; Lee, Jong Seong; Heo, Jeong Doo; Yu, Il Je\n\n2013-12-01\n\nTo define the relationship between the brain concentration of manganese and neurological signs, such as locomotion, after prolonged welding-fume exposure, cynomolgus monkeys were acclimated for 1 month and then divided into three concentration groups: unexposed, low concentration (31 mg/m(3) total suspended particulate (TSP), 0.9 mg/m(3) of Mn), and high concentration (62 mg/m(3) TSP, 1.95 mg/m(3) of Mn) of TSP. The monkeys were exposed to manual metal-arc stainless steel (MMA-SS) welding fumes for 2 h per day over 8 months in an inhalation chamber system equipped with an automatic fume generator. The home cage locomotor activity and patterns were determined using a camera system over 2-4 consecutive days. After 25 and 32 weeks of exposure, the home cage locomotor activity of the high-concentration primates was found to be 5-6 times higher than that of the unexposed primates, and this increased locomotor activity was maintained for 7 weeks after ceasing the welding-fume exposure, eventually subsiding to three times higher after 13 weeks of recovery. Therefore, the present results, along with our previous observations of a high magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T1 signal in the globus pallidus and increased blood Mn concentration, indicate that prolonged welding-fume exposure can cause neurobehavioral changes in cynomolgus monkeys.\n\nExposure to Cooking Fumes and Acute Reversible Decrement in Lung Functional Capacity.\n\nPubMed\n\nNeghab, Masoud; Delikhoon, Mahdieh; Norouzian Baghani, Abbas; Hassanzadeh, Jafar\n\n2017-10-01\n\nBeing exposed to cooking fumes, kitchen workers are occupationally at risk of multiple respiratory hazards. No conclusive evidence exists as to whether occupational exposure to these fumes is associated with acute and chronic pulmonary effects and symptoms of respiratory diseases. To quantify the exposure levels and evaluate possible chronic and acute pulmonary effects associated with exposure to cooking fumes. In this cross-sectional study, 60 kitchen workers exposed to cooking fumes and 60 unexposed employees were investigated. The prevalence of respiratory symptoms among these groups was determined through completion of a standard questionnaire. Pulmonary function parameters were also measured before and after participants' work shift. Moreover, air samples were collected and analyzed to quantify their aldehyde, particle, and volatile organic contents. The mean airborne concentrations of formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, and acrolein was 0.45 (SD 0.41), 0.13 (0.1), and 1.56 (0.41) mg/m 3 , respectively. The mean atmospheric concentrations of PM 1 , PM 2.5 , PM 7 , PM 10 , and total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs) was 3.31 (2.6), 12.21 (5.9), 44.16 (16.6), 57 (21.55) Î¼g/m 3 , and 1.31 (1.11) mg/m 3 , respectively. All respiratory symptoms were significantly (p<0.05) more prevalent in exposed group. No significant difference was noted between the pre-shift mean of spirometry parameters of exposed and unexposed group. However, exposed workers showed cross-shift decrease in most spirometry parameters, significantly lower than the pre-shift values and those of the comparison group. Exposure to cooking fumes is associated with a significant increase in the prevalence of respiratory symptoms as well as acute reversible decrease in lung functional capacity.\n\nReduction of Biomechanical and Welding Fume Exposures in Stud Welding.\n\nPubMed\n\nFethke, Nathan B; Peters, Thomas M; Leonard, Stephanie; Metwali, Mahmoud; Mudunkotuwa, Imali A\n\n2016-04-01\n\nThe welding of shear stud connectors to structural steel in construction requires a prolonged stooped posture that exposes ironworkers to biomechanical and welding fume hazards.

In a previous study, the inflammatory response to welding fume exposure was analysed in rat lungs in the case of recurrent exposure and recovery periods. Thus using lung samples, well-annotated by histological observation and biochemical analysis, this study examines the gene expression profiles to identify phenotype-anchored genes corresponding to lung inflammation and the repair phenomenon after recurrent welding fume exposure. Seven genes (Mmp12, Cd5l, LOC50101, LOC69183, Spp1, and Slc26a4) were found to be significantly up-regulated according to the severity of the lung injury. In addition, the transcription and translation of Trem2, which was up-regulated in response to the repair process, were validated using a real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. The differentially expressed genes in the exposure and recovery groups were also classified using k-means and hierarchical clustering, plus their toxicological function and canonical pathways were further analysed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis Software. As a result, this comprehensive and integrative analysis of the transcriptional changes that occur during repeated exposure provides important information on the inflammation and repair processes after welding-fume-induced lung injury.\n\nExposure to bitumen fumes and genotoxic effects on Turkish asphalt workers.\n\nPubMed\n\nKaraman, Ali; Pirim, Ibrahim\n\n2009-04-01\n\nBitumen fumes consist essentially of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their derivatives, some of which are known to be carcinogenic or cocarcinogenic in humans. The aim of this study was to investigate exposure to asphalt fumes among Turkish asphalt workers and determine whether any effects could be detected with genotoxic tests. The study included 26 asphalt workers and 24 control subjects. Sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and micronucleus (MN) were determined in peripheral lymphocytes. Urinary 1-hydroxypyrene (1-OHP) excretion was used as a biomarker of occupational exposure to PAHs. The asphalt workers had a significant increase in SCEs and MN (for each, p < 0.001). A positive correlation existed between the duration of exposure and rates of SCE or MN frequencies (r = 0.49, p < 0.05; r = 0.53, p < 0.05, respectively). The concentration of 1-OHP in urine was higher for the asphalt workers than for the controls (p < 0.001). However, we found that there was no statistically significant correlation between the urinary 1-OHP concentration and SCEs or MN frequencies (r = 0.25, p > 0.5; r = 0.17, p > 0.5, respectively). This study shows that Turkish asphalt workers have an increased exposure to PAHs from bitumen fumes, and genotoxic effects could be detected by SCEs and MN tests.\n\nGlobal metabolomic profiling reveals an association of metal fume exposure and plasma unsaturated fatty acids.\n\nPubMed\n\nWei, Yongyue; Wang, Zhaoxi; Chang, Chiung-yu; Fan, Tianteng; Su, Li; Chen, Feng; Christiani, David C\n\n2013-01-01\n\nWelding-associated air pollutants negatively affect the health of exposed workers; however, their molecular mechanisms in causing disease remain largely unclear.

The two-stage, self-controlled exploratory study included 11 boilermakers from a 2011 discovery panel and 8 boilermakers from a 2012 validation panel. Plasma samples were collected pre- and post-welding fume exposure and analyzed by chromatography/mass spectrometry. Eicosapentaenoic or docosapentaenoic acid metabolic changes post-welding were significantly associated with particulate (PM2.5) exposure (p<0.05). The combined analysis by linear mixed-effects model showed that exposure was associated with a statistically significant decline in metabolite change of eicosapentaenoic acid [Î²(95% CI) = -0.013(-0.022 â -0.004); p = 0.005], docosapentaenoic acid n3 [Î²(95% CI) = -0.010(-0.018 â -0.002); p = 0.017], and docosapentaenoic acid n6 [Î²(95% CI) = -0.007(-0.013 â -0.001); p = 0.021]. Pathway analysis identified an association of the unsaturated fatty acid pathway with exposure (p Study-2011 = 0.025; p Study-2012 = 0.021; p Combined = 0.009). The functional network built by these fatty acids and their interactive genes contained significant enrichment of genes associated with various diseases, including neoplasms, cardiovascular diseases, and lipid metabolism disorders. High-dose exposure of metal welding fumes decreases unsaturated fatty acids with an exposure-response relationship.

In the present study, it was investigated which metal is responsible for this effect. Fifteen healthy male subjects were exposed under controlled conditions to welding fumes containing either zinc, or copper, or copper and zinc. For each exposure blood C-reactive protein increased.

It has been shown to generate a large majority of particles at the nanoscale and to have low mass emission rates when compared to other types of welding. Despite evidence that TIG fume particles may produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), limited data is available for the time course changes of particle-associated oxidative stress in exposed TIG welders. Twenty non-smoking male welding apprentices were exposed to TIG welding fumes for 60Â min under controlled, well-ventilated settings. Exhaled breathe condensate (EBC), blood and urine were collected before exposure, immediately after exposure, 1Â h and 3Â h post exposure. Volunteers participated in a control day to account for oxidative stress fluctuations due to circadian rhythm. Biological liquids were assessed for total reducing capacity, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA), and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) concentrations at each time point. A linear mixed model was used to assess within day and between day differences. Significant increases in the measured biomarkers were found at 3Â h post exposure. At 3Â h post exposure, we found a 24Â % increase in plasma-H2O2 concentrations ([95%CI: 4Â % to 46Â %], pâ=â0.01); a 91Â % increase in urinary-H2O2 ([2Â % to 258Â %], pâ=â0.04); a 14Â % increase in plasma-8-OHdG ([0Â % to 31Â %], pâ=â0.049); and a 45Â % increase in urinary-8-OHdG ([3Â % to 105Â %], pâ=â0.03). Doubling particle number concentration (PNC) exposure was associated with a 22Â % increase of plasma-8-OHdG at 3Â h post exposure (pâ=â0.01). A 60-min exposure to TIG welding fume in a controlled, well-ventilated setting induced acute oxidative stress at 3Â h post exposure in healthy, non-smoking apprentice welders not chronically exposed to welding fumes.

In China, cooking oil fumes are important parts of indoor air pollution. However, whether cooking oil fume exposure during pregnancy affects birth weight in China remains poorly understood. The objective of this study was to examine the association between pregnancy exposure to cooking oil fumes and birth weight in a newly established prospective mother-child cohort in China. We finally included 1420 pregnant women from 2013 to 2015 and follow up for one year until the offspring was born. According to self-reported exposure status, we categorized mothers into non-exposure group and exposed group or three exposure time subgroups, including 0h/day, 0-1h/day and >1h/day respectively. By using multinomial logistics regression models, we found that pregnancy exposure to cooking oil fumes significantly increased the risk of large for gestational age (LGA, OR=1.58, 95% CI=1.15-2.18, P=4.88Ã10 -3 ). Additionally, compared to pregnant women who were in non-exposure group, 0-1h/day exposure elevated the risk of LGA (OR=1.69, 95% CI=1.22-2.33, P=1.63Ã10 -3 ), while >1h/day exposure elevated the risk of small for gestational age, but were not significant (SGA, OR=2.15, 95% CI=0.61-7.66, P=0.24). In the stratification analysis, women aged 25-29years and â¥30years were predisposed to the influence of cooking oil fumes and have LGA newborns (OR=1.73, 95% CI=1.09-2.75, P=0.02; OR=1.72, 95% CI=1.07-2.77, P=0.02, respectively). In conclusion, the present study suggests inverse U-shape dose response association between maternal exposure to cooking oil fumes during pregnancy and birth weight, and further studies are needed to verify the effect of cooking oil fumes on the birth weight.

To examine the respiratory effects, if any, of occupational inhalation exposure to asphalt fumes. In this cross-sectional study, 74 asphalt workers and 110 unexposed employees were investigated. The prevalence of respiratory symptoms among subjects was investigated by a standard questionnaire. Additionally, the parameters of pulmonary function were measured both, prior to exposure and at the end of work-shift. Furthermore, to assess the extent to which workers were exposed to asphalt fumes, total particulate and the benzene-soluble fraction were measured in different worksites. The mean levels of exposure to total particulate and benzene-soluble fraction in asphalt fumes were estimated to be 0.9 (SD 0.2) and 0.3 (SD 0.1) mg/m^3, respectively. Mean values of FEV1, both prior to the exposure (89.58% [SD 18.69%] predicted value) and at the end of shift (85.38% [SD 19.4%]), were significantly (p<0.05) smaller than those of the comparison subjects (93.88% [SD 13.93%]). Similarly, pre-shift (87.05 [SD 8.57]) and postexposure (89.95 [SD 6.85]) FEV1/FVC ratio were both significantly (p<0.01) lower than those of the unexposed employees (107.56 [SD 9.64]). Moreover, the prevalence of respiratory symptoms such as cough and wheezing in exposed employees were 41% and 42%, respectively. The corresponding values for comparison subjects were 10.0% and 3.6%, respectively (p<0.001). The pattern of changes in parameters of lung function in asphalt workers was consistent with that of chronic obstructive lung disease. Significant decrements in the parameters of pulmonary function as well as, a significant increase in the prevalence of respiratory symptoms in asphalt paving workers compared to their unexposed counterparts provided evidence in favor of a significant association between exposure to asphalt fumes and lung function impairments.\n\nThe Relationship of Welding Fume Exposure, Smoking, and Pulmonary Function in Welders.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoach, Laura L\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between occupational exposure to welding fumes and pulmonary function in an effort to add supportive evidence and clarity to the current body of research. This study utilized a retrospective chart review of pulmonary function testing and pulmonary questionnaires already available in charts from preplacement physicals to the most recent test. When comparing smokers to nonsmokers, utilizing multiple regression and controlling for age and percentage of time using a respirator, years welding was statistically significant at p = .04. Data support that smoking has a synergistic effect when combined with welding fume exposure on pulmonary decline.\n\nEffects of pulmonary exposure to chemically-distinct welding fumes on neuroendocrine markers of toxicity.\n\nPubMed\n\nKrajnak, K; Sriram, K; Johnson, C; Roberts, J R; Mercer, R; Miller, G R; Wirth, O; Antonini, J M\n\n2017-01-01\n\nExposure to welding fumes may result in disorders of the pulmonary, cardiovascular, and reproductive systems. Welders are also at a greater risk of developing symptoms similar to those seen in individuals with idiopathic Parkinson's disease. In welders, there are studies that suggest that alterations in circulating prolactin concentrations may be indicative of injury to the dopamine (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra. The goal of these studies was to use an established model of welding particulate exposure to mimic the effects of welding fume inhalation on reproductive functions. Since previous investigators suggested that changes in circulating prolactin may be an early marker of DA neuron injury, movement disorders, and reproductive dysfunction, prolactin, hypothalamic tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) levels (a marker of DA synthesis), and other measures of hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) function were measured after repetitive instillation of welding fume particulates generated by flux core arc-hard surfacing (FCA-HS), manual metal arc-hard surfacing (MMA-HS) or gas metal arc-mild steel (GMA-MS) welding, or manganese chloride (MnCl 2 ). Exposure to welding fume particulate resulted in the accumulation of various metals in the pituitary and testes of rats, along with changes in hypothalamic TH and serum prolactin levels. Exposure to particulates with high concentrations of soluble manganese (Mn) appeared to exert the greatest influence on TH activity levels and serum prolactin concentrations. Thus, circulating prolactin levels may serve as a biomarker for welding fume/Mn-induced neurotoxicity. Other reproductive measures were collected, and these data were consistent with epidemiological findings that prolactin and testosterone may serve as biomarkers of welding particulate induced DA neuron and reproductive dysfunction.\n\nTissue distribution of manganese in iron-sufficient or iron-deficient rats after stainless steel welding-fume exposure.\n\nPubMed\n\nPark, Jung-Duck; Kim, Ki-Young; Kim, Dong-Won; Choi, Seong-Jin; Choi, Byung-Sun; Chung, Yong Hyun; Han, Jeong Hee; Sung, Jae Hyuck; Kwon, Il Hoon; Mun, Je-Hyeok; Yu, Il Je\n\n2007-05-01\n\nWelders can be exposed to high levels of manganese through welding fumes. Although it has already been suggested that excessive manganese exposure causes neurotoxicity, called manganism, the pathway of manganese transport to the brain with welding-fume exposure remains unclear. Iron is an essential metal that maintains a homeostasis in the body. The divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) transports iron and other divalent metals, such as manganese, and the depletion of iron is known to upregulate DMT1 expression. Accordingly, this study investigated the tissue distribution of manganese in iron-sufficient and iron-deficient rats after welding-fume exposure. The feeding of an iron-deficient diet for 4 wk produced a depletion of body iron, such as decreased iron levels in the serum and tissues, and upregulated the DMT1 expression in the rat duodenum. The iron-sufficient and iron-deficient rats were then exposed to welding fumes generated from manual metal arc stainless steel at a concentration of 63.5 +/- 2.3 mg/m3 for 2 h per day over a 30-day period. Animals were sacrificed on days 1, 15, and 30. The level of body iron in the iron-deficient rats was restored to the control level after the welding-fume exposure. However, the tissue distributions of manganese after the welding-fume exposure showed similar patterns in both the iron-sufficient and iron-deficient groups. The concentration of manganese increased in the lungs and liver on days 15 and 30, and increased in the olfactory bulb on day 30. Slight and heterogeneous increases of manganese were observed in different brain regions. Consequently, these findings suggest that the presence of Fe in the inhaled welding fumes may not have a significant effect on the uptake of Mn into the brain. Thus, the condition of iron deficiency did not seem to have any apparent effect on the transport of Mn into the brain after the inhalation of welding fumes.\n\nInhalation exposure of rats to asphalt fumes generated at paving temperatures alters pulmonary xenobiotic metabolism pathways without lung injury.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMa, Jane Y C; Rengasamy, Apavoo; Frazer, Dave; Barger, Mark W; Hubbs, Ann F; Battelli, Lori; Tomblyn, Seith; Stone, Samuel; Castranova, Vince\n\n2003-01-01\n\nAsphalt fumes are complex mixtures of various organic compounds, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs require bioactivation by the cytochrome P-450 monooxygenase system to exert toxic/carcinogenic effects. The present study was carried out to characterize the acute pulmonary inflammatory responses and the alterations of pulmonary xenobiotic pathways in rats exposed to asphalt fumes by inhalation. Rats were exposed at various doses and time periods to air or to asphalt fumes generated at paving temperatures. To assess the acute damage and inflammatory responses, differential cell counts, acellular lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, and protein content of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were determined. Alveolar macrophage (AM) function was assessed by monitoring generation of chemiluminescence and production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1. Alteration of pulmonary xenobiotic pathways was determined by monitoring the protein levels and activities of P-450 isozymes (CYP1A1 and CYP2B1), glutathioneS-transferase (GST), and NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase (QR). The results show that acute asphalt fume exposure did not cause neutrophil infiltration, alter LDH activity or protein content, or affect AM function, suggesting that short-term asphalt fume exposure did not induce acute lung damage or inflammation. However, acute asphalt fume exposure significantly increased the activity and protein level of CYP1A1 whereas it markedly reduced the activity and protein level of CYP2B1 in the lung. The induction of CYP1A1 was localized in nonciliated bronchiolar epithelial (Clara) cells, alveolar septa, and endothelial cells by immunofluorescence microscopy. Cytosolic QR activity was significantly elevated after asphalt fume exposure, whereas GST activity was not affected by the exposure. This induction of CYP1A1 and QR with the concomitant down-regulation of CYP2B1 after asphalt fume exposure could alter PAH metabolism and may lead to potential\n\nMicroarray-based analysis of the lung recovery process after stainless-steel welding fume exposure in Sprague-Dawley rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nOh, Jung-Hwa; Yang, Mi-jin; Yang, Young-Su; Park, Han-Jin; Heo, Sun Hee; Lee, Eun-Hee; Song, Chang-Woo; Yoon, Seokjoo\n\n2009-02-01\n\nRepeated exposure to welding fumes promotes a reversible increase in pulmonary disease risk, but the molecular mechanisms by which welding fumes induce lung injury and how the lung recovers from such insults are unclear. In the present study, pulmonary function and gene-expression profiles in the lung were analyzed by Affymetrix GeneChip microarray after 30 days of consecutive exposure to manual metal arc welding combined with stainless-steel (MMA-SS) welding fumes, and again after 30 days of recovery from MMA-SS fume exposure. In total, 577 genes were identified as being either up-regulated or down-regulated (over twofold changes, p < 0.05) in the lungs of low-dose or high-dose groups. Differentially expressed genes were classified based on a k-means clustering algorithm and biological functions and molecular networks were further analyzed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis. Among the genes affected by exposure to or recovery from MMA-SS fumes, the transcriptional changes of 13 genes that were highly altered by treatment were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR. Notably, Mmp12, Cd5l, Ccl7, Cxcl5, and Spp1 related to the immune response were up-regulated only in the exposure group, whereas Trem2, IgG-2a, Igh-1a, and Igh were persistently up-regulated in both the exposure and recovery groups. In addition, several genes that might play a role in the repair process of the lung were up-regulated exclusively in the recovery group. Collectively, these data may help elucidate the molecular mechanism of the recovery process of the lung after welding fume exposure.\n\nManganese distribution in brains of Sprague-Dawley rats after 60 days of stainless steel welding-fume exposure.\n\nPubMed\n\nYu, Il Je; Park, Jung Duck; Park, Eon Sub; Song, Kyung Seuk; Han, Kuy Tae; Han, Jeong Hee; Chung, Yong Hyun; Choi, Byung Sun; Chung, Kyu Hyuck; Cho, Myung Haing\n\n2003-12-01\n\nWelders working in a confined space, as in the shipbuilding industry, are at risk of being exposed to high concentrations of welding fumes and developing pneumoconiosis or other welding-fume exposure related diseases. Among such diseases, manganism resulting from welding-fume exposure remains a controversial issue, as the movement of manganese into specific brain regions has not yet been clearly established. Accordingly, to investigate the distribution of manganese in the brain after welding-fume exposure, male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to welding fumes generated from manual metal arc-stainless steel (MMA-SS) at concentrations of 63.6 +/- 4.1 mg/m(3) (low dose, containing 1.6 mg/m(3) Mn) and 107.1 +/- 6.3 mg/m(3) (high dose, containing 3.5 mg/m(3) Mn) total suspended particulate (TSP) for 2 h per day in an inhalation chamber over a 60-day period. Blood, brain, lung, and liver samples were collected after 2 h, 15, 30, and 60 days of exposure and the tissues analyzed for their manganese concentrations using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Although dose- and time-dependent increases in the manganese concentrations were found in the lungs and livers of the rats exposed for 60 days, only slight manganese increases were observed in the blood during this period. Major statistically significant increases in the brain manganese concentrations were detected in the cerebellum after 15 days of exposure and up until 60 days. Slight increases in the manganese concentrations were also found in the substantia nigra, basal ganglia (caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus pallidus), temporal cortex, and frontal cortex, thereby indicating that the pharmacokinetics and distribution of the manganese inhaled from the welding fumes were different from those resulting from manganese-only exposure.\n\nAlternatives for Benzene in the Extraction of Bitumen Fume from Exposure Sample Media.\n\nPubMed\n\nSutter, Benjamin; Ravera, Christel; Hussard, Caroline; Langlois, Eddy\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBenzene is frequently used to extract collected bitumen fumes from personal sampler substrates. However, this solvent is particularly dangerous because of its carcinogenicity (group 1 of the International Agency for Research on Cancer classification). Therefore, to prevent the exposure of laboratory technicians to benzene during the fume extraction step from samplers, a compromise had to be found to identify a less toxic solvent with the same extraction capacity. To compare the extraction capacities of selected solvents, bitumen fumes were generated in the laboratory from three different batches of road surfacing bitumen collected on dedicated bitumen fume samplers. The samplers were then extracted by benzene and the solvents tested. Of 11 selected solvents less toxic than benzene and used in studies on bitumen and bitumen fume analyses, n-hexane and n-heptane were identified as alternatives to benzene. In particular, the results demonstrated that n-heptane was the best candidate solvent for benzene replacement, due to its extraction efficiency comparable to benzene for the three bitumen fumes tested and its low toxicity, which is highly compatible with benzene replacement.

A number of previous studies have shown particle release during work with nanomaterials under fume hoods. Here, we assessed laboratory workers' inhalation exposure during synthesis and handling of CuO, TiO2 and ZnO in a fume hood. In addition, we tested the capacity of a fume hood to prevent particle release to laboratory air during simulated spillage of different powders (silica fume, zirconia TZ-3Y and TiO2). Airborne particle concentrations were measured in near field, far field, and in the breathing zone of the worker. Handling CuO nanoparticles increased the concentration of small particles (< 58 nm) inside the fume hood (up to 1 Ã 105 cm-3). Synthesis, handling and packaging of ZnO and TiO2 nanoparticles did not result in detectable particle release to the laboratory air. Simulated powder spills showed a systematic increase in the particle concentrations inside the fume hood with increasing amount of material and drop height. Despite powder spills were sometimes observed to eject into the laboratory room, the spill events were rarely associated with notable release of particles from the fume hood. Overall, this study shows that a fume hood generally offers sufficient exposure control during synthesis and handling of nanomaterials. An appropriate fume hood with adequate sash height and face velocity prevents 98.3% of particles release into the surrounding environment. Care should still be made to consider spills and high cleanliness to prevent exposure via resuspension and inadvertent exposure by secondary routes.\n\nSystemic serum amyloid A as a biomarker for exposure to zinc and/or copper-containing metal fumes.\n\nPubMed\n\nBaumann, R; Gube, M; Markert, A; Davatgarbenam, S; Kossack, V; Gerhards, B; Kraus, T; Brand, P\n\n2018-01-01\n\nZinc- and copper-containing welding fumes increase systemic C-reactive protein (CRP). The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of the biomarkers serum amyloid A (SAA) and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in this regard. Fifteen male subjects were exposed under controlled conditions to welding fumes containing either zinc, or copper, or copper and zinc for 6âh. Plasma samples were collected before, 6 and 24âh after start of exposure and biomarkers therein were measured by electrochemiluminescent assay. For each exposure, systemic concentrations of systemic SAA, but not VCAM-1, increased significantly at 24âh after exposure start compared with baseline (\"copper only\": P=0.0005, \"zinc only\": P=0.027, \"copper and zinc\": P=0.001). SAA showed a wider range of concentrations than did CRP and its levels increased up to 19-fold after welding fume exposure. The recognition of copper as a potential harmful component in welding fumes, also independent from zinc, deserves further consideration. SAA might represent a new sensitive biomarker for potential subclinical sterile inflammation after inhalation of copper- and/or zinc-containing welding fumes. As elevations of CRP and SAA protein have both been linked to a higher risk for cardiovascular disease, these findings might particularly be important for long-term welders.\n\nRecovery from welding-fume-exposure-induced lung fibrosis and pulmonary function changes in sprague dawley rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nSung, Jae Hyuck; Choi, Byung-Gil; Maeng, Seung-Hee; Kim, Soo-Jin; Chung, Yong Hyun; Han, Jeong Hee; Song, Kyung Seuk; Lee, Yong Hwan; Cho, Yong Bong; Cho, Myung-Haing; Kim, Kwang Jong; Hyun, Jin Suk; Yu, Il Je\n\n2004-12-01\n\nWelder's pneumoconiosis has generally been determined as benign based on the absence of pulmonary function abnormalities in welders with marked radiographic abnormalities. Yet, there have also been several reports on welders with respiratory symptoms, indicating lung function impairment, X-ray abnormalities, and extensive fibrosis. Accordingly, this study attempted to investigate the inflammatory responses and pulmonary function changes in rats during a 60-day welding-fume-inhalation exposure period to elucidate the process of fibrosis. The rats were exposed to manual metal-arc stainless-steel welding fumes (MMA-SS) with total suspended particulate concentrations of 64.8 +/- 0.9 (low dose) and 107.8 +/- 2.6 mg/m3 (high dose) for 2 h per day in an inhalation chamber for 60 days. Animals were sacrificed after the initial 2-h exposure and after 15, 30, and 60 days, and the pulmonary function was also measured every week after the daily exposure. Elevated cellular differential counts were also measured in the acellular bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the rats exposed to the MMA-SS fumes for 60 days. Among the pulmonary function test parameters, only the tidal volume showed a statistically significant and dose-dependent decrease after 35 to 60 days of MMA-SS welding-fume exposure. When the rats exposed to the welding fumes were left for 60 days to recover their lung function and cellular differentiation, recovery was observed in both the high and low-dose rats exposed up to 30 days, resulting in the disappearance of inflammatory cells and restoration of the tidal volume. The rats exposed for 60 days at the low dose also recovered from the inflammation and tidal volume loss, yet the rats exposed for 60 days at the high dose did not fully recover even after a 60-day recovery period. Therefore, when taken together, the results of the current study suggest that a decrease in the tidal volume could be used as an early indicator of pulmonary fibrosis induced by welding-fume\n\nEffect of short-term stainless steel welding fume inhalation exposure on lung inflammation, injury, and defense responses in rats.\n\nPubMed\n\nAntonini, James M; Stone, Sam; Roberts, Jenny R; Chen, Bean; Schwegler-Berry, Diane; Afshari, Aliakbar A; Frazer, David G\n\n2007-09-15\n\nMany welders have experienced bronchitis, metal fume fever, lung function changes, and an increase in the incidence of lung infection. Questions remain regarding the possible mechanisms associated with the potential pulmonary effects of welding fume exposure. The objective was to assess the early effects of stainless steel (SS) welding fume inhalation on lung injury, inflammation, and defense responses. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to gas metal arc-SS welding fume at a concentration of 15 or 40 mg/m(3) x 3 h/day for 1, 3, or 10 days. The control group was exposed to filtered air. To assess lung defense responses, some animals were intratracheally inoculated with 5x10(4) Listeria monocytogenes 1 day after the last exposure. Welding particles were collected during exposure, and elemental composition and particle size were determined. At 1, 4, 6, 11, 14, and 30 days after the final exposure, parameters of lung injury (lactate dehydrogenase and albumin) and inflammation (PMN influx) were measured in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. In addition, particle-induced effects on pulmonary clearance of bacteria and macrophage function were assessed. SS particles were composed of Fe, Cr, Mn, and Ni. Particle size distribution analysis indicated the mass median aerodynamic diameter of the generated fume to be 0.255 microm. Parameters of lung injury were significantly elevated at all time points post-exposure compared to controls except for 30 days. Interestingly, no significant difference in lung PMNs was observed between the SS and control groups at 1, 4, and 6 days post-exposure. After 6 days post-exposure, a dramatic increase in lung PMNs was observed in the SS group compared to air controls. Lung bacteria clearance and macrophage function were reduced and immune and inflammatory cytokines were altered in the SS group. In summary, short-term exposure of rats to SS welding fume caused significant lung damage and suppressed lung defense responses to bacterial\n\nEffect of short-term stainless steel welding fume inhalation exposure on lung inflammation, injury, and defense responses in rats\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nAntonini, James M.; Stone, Sam; Roberts, Jenny R.\n\nMany welders have experienced bronchitis, metal fume fever, lung function changes, and an increase in the incidence of lung infection.

Since their categorization as possible carcinogens, welding fumes have gained increasing attention as high priority agents for risk assessment. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of welding fume inhalation on oxidative stress, DNA damage response (DDR), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) and nuclear factor kappa B (NFÎºB) signalling in the lung tissues of male Sprague-Dawley rats . METHODS: Animals were divided into five groups. Group 1 animals served as control. Rats in groups 2-5 were exposed to 50mg/m 3 stainless steel (SS) welding fumes for 1h for 1day, 1 week, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks respectively. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG), xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes (XMEs) and antioxidants were analysed. DNA damage sensors, DNA repair enzymes, inflammatory mediators, cell cycle progression, apoptosis and key players in Nrf2 and NFÎºB signalling were assessed by flow cytometry, quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR, immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Rats exposed to welding fumes showed increased levels of chromium and ROS in lung tissues associated with accumulation of 8-oxodG and enhanced expression of XMEs and antioxidants. This was accompanied by upregulation of DNA damage sensors, cell cycle arrest in G1/S phase, overexpression of a multitude of DNA repair enzymes and caspase-mediated apoptosis. In addition, exposure to welding fumes induced activation of Nrf2 and NFÎºB signalling with enhanced expression of inflammatory mediators. The results of the present study unequivocally demonstrate that exposure of rats to SS welding fumes alters the expression of 37 genes involved in oxidative stress, detoxification, inflammation, DNA repair, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis\n\nOccupational exposure to manganese-containing welding fumes and pulmonary function indices among natural gas transmission pipeline welders.\n\nPubMed\n\nHassani, Hamid; Golbabaei, Farideh; Ghahri, Asghar; Hosseini, Mostafa; Shirkhanloo, Hamid; Dinari, Behnam; Eskandari, Davood; Fallahi, Majid\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe objectives of this study were to evaluate manganese (Mn)-containing welding fumes' exposure, assess urinary Mn as a biomarker for Mn exposure and investigate the correlation of Mn in air, total fumes and urinary Mn with pulmonary function indices in 118 welders and 37 unexposed controls from two regions in Iran, Assaluyeh and Borujen. Air samples were collected on mixed cellulose ester membrane filters in personal air samplers and then analyzed using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) (NIOSH Method 7300). For all participants, urine samples were collected during the entire work shift, and Mn in urine was determined by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy according to NIOSH Method 8310. Spirometric measurements were also done for participants. The maximum exposures to airborne Mn and total fumes were 0.304 Â± 0.256 mg/m(3) and 21.52 Â± 9.40 mg/m(3), respectively. The urine Mn levels in the various groups ranged between 0.77 to 7.58 Î¼g/l. The correlation between airborne Mn and urinary Mn was significant for total whole participants. Some values of spirometric indices were statistically lower in welders rather than controls. Our results indicate that many welders have been exposed to higher concentrations of Mn-containing welding fumes. Urinary Mn can be used as a biomarker for Mn exposure. There were weak inverse correlations between Mn-containing welding fumes and pulmonary function indices, and the inverse correlation between urinary Mn with forced vital capacities (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) was significant.\n\nIncreased levels of oxidative DNA damage attributable to cooking-oil fumes exposure among cooks.\n\nPubMed\n\nKe, Yuebin; Cheng, Jinquan; Zhang, Zhicheng; Zhang, Renli; Zhang, Zhunzhen; Shuai, Zhihong; Wu, Tangchun\n\n2009-07-01\n\nPrevious investigations have indicated that cooks are exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from cooking-oil fumes. However, Emission of PAH and their carcinogenic potencies from cooking oil fumes sources have not been investigated among cooks. To investigate the urinary excretion of a marker for oxidative DNA damage, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), in different groups of cooks and different exposure groups, and to study the association between 8-OHdG and 1-hydroxypyrene(1-OHP), a biological marker for PAH exposure. Urine samples were collected from different groups of cooks (n = 86) and from unexposed controls (n = 36); all were male with similar age and smoking habits. The health status, occupational history, smoking, and alcohol consumption 24 h prior to sampling was estimated from questionnaires. The urine samples were frozen for later analyses of 8-OHdG and 1-OHP levels by high-performance liquid chromatography. Excretion in urine of 8-OHdG was similar for controls (mean 1.2micromol/mol creatinine, n = 36), and for those who had been in the kitchen with an exhaust-hood operating (mean 1.5micromol/mol creatinine, n = 45). Cooks exposed to cooking-oil fumes without exhaust-hood operation had significantly increased excretion of 8-OHdG (mean 2.3micromol/mol creatinine, n = 18), compared with controls. The urinary levels of ln 1-OHP and ln 8-OHdG were still significantly correlated in a multiple regression analysis. The results indicate that exposure to PAH or possibly other compounds in cooking-oil fumes may cause oxidative DNA damage.\n\nExposures to quartz, diesel, dust, and welding fumes during heavy and highway construction.\n\nPubMed\n\nWoskie, Susan R; Kalil, Andrew; Bello, Dhimiter; Virji, M Abbas\n\n2002-01-01\n\nPersonal samples for exposure to dust, diesel exhaust, quartz, and welding fume were collected on heavy and highway construction workers. The respirable, thoracic, and inhalable fractions of dust and quartz exposures were estimated from 260 personal impactor samples. Respirable quartz exposures exceeded the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limit (REL) in 7-31% of cases for the trades sampled. More than 50% of the samples in the installation of drop ceilings and wall tiles and concrete finish operations exceeded the NIOSH REL for quartz. Thoracic exposures to quartz and dust exceeded respirable exposures by a factor of 4.5 and 2.8, respectively. Inhalable exposures to quartz and dust exceeded respirable exposures by a factor of 25.6 and 9.3, respectively. These findings are important due to the identification of quartz as a carcinogen by the National Toxicology Program and the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Fourteen percent of the personal samples for EC (n = 261), collected as a marker for diesel exhaust, exceeded the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) threshold limit value (TLV) for diesel exhaust. Seventeen of the 22 (77%) samples taken during a partially enclosed welding operation reached or exceeded the ACGIH TLV of 5 mg/m3 for welding fume.\n\nOccupational exposure to solvents, metals and welding fumes and risk of Parkinson's disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nvan der Mark, Marianne; Vermeulen, Roel; Nijssen, Peter C G; Mulleners, Wim M; Sas, Antonetta M G; van Laar, Teus; Huss, Anke; Kromhout, Hans\n\n2015-06-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the potential association between occupational exposure to solvents, metals and/or welding fumes and risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD). Data of a hospital based case-control study including 444 PD patients and 876 age and sex matched controls was used. Occupational histories and lifestyle information of cases and controls were collected in a structured telephone interview. Exposures to aromatic solvents, chlorinated solvents and metals were estimated by linking the ALOHA+ job-exposure matrix to the occupational histories. Exposure to welding fumes was estimated using self-reported information on welding activities. No statistically significant associations with any of the studied metal and solvent exposures were found. However, for self-reported welding activities we observed non-statistically significant reduced risk estimates (third tertile cumulative exposure: ORÂ =Â 0.51 (95% CI: 0.21-1.24)). The results of our study did not provide support for an increased chance on developing PD after occupational exposure to aromatic solvents, chlorinated solvents or exposure to metals. The results showed reduced risk estimates for welding, which is in line with previous research, but no clear explanation for these findings is available. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

In some cases, the pulmonary fibrosis associated with welding fumes appears in a more severe form in welders. Accordingly, for the early detection of welding-fume-exposure-induced pulmonary fibrosis, the gene expression profiles of peripheral mononuclear cells from rats exposed to welding fumes were studied using suppression-subtractive hybridization (SSH) and a cDNA microarray. As such, Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to a stainless steel arc welding fume for 2 h/day in an inhalation chamber with a 1107.5 +/- 2.6 mg/m3 concentration of total suspended particulate (TSP) for 30 days. Thereafter, the total RNA was extracted from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the cDNA synthesized from the total RNA using the SMART PCR cDNA method, and SSH performed to select the welding-fume-exposure-regulated genes. The cDNAs identified by the SSH were then cloned into a plasmid miniprep, sequenced and the sequences analysed using the NCBI BLAST programme. In the SSH cloned cDNA microarray analysis, five genes were found to increase their expression by 1.9-fold or more, including Rgs 14, which plays an important function in cellular signal transduction pathways; meanwhile 36 genes remained the same and 30 genes decreased their expression by more than 59%, including genes associated with the immune response, transcription factors and tyrosine kinases. Among the 5200 genes analysed, 256 genes (5.1%) were found to increase their gene expression, while 742 genes (15%) decreased their gene expression in response to the welding-fume exposure when tested using a commercial 5.0k DNA microarray. Therefore, unlike exposure to other toxic substances, prolonged welding-fume exposure was found to substantially downregulate many genes.\n\nRelationship between welding fume concentration and systemic inflammation after controlled exposure of human subjects with welding fumes from metal inert gas brazing of zinc-coated materials.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrand, Peter; Bauer, Marcus; Gube, Monika; Lenz, Klaus; Reisgen, Uwe; Spiegel-Ciobanu, Vilia Elena; Kraus, Thomas\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIt has been shown that exposure of subjects to emissions from a metal inert gas (MIG) brazing process of zinc-coated material led to an increase of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) in the blood. In this study, the no-observed-effect level (NOEL) for such emissions was assessed. Twelve healthy subjects were exposed for 6 hours to different concentrations of MIG brazing fumes under controlled conditions. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was measured in the blood. For welding fumes containing 1.20 and 1.50 mg m zinc, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein was increased the day after exposure. For 0.90 mg m zinc, no increase was detected. These data indicate that the no-observed-effect level for emissions from a MIG brazing process of zinc-coated material in respect to systemic inflammation is found for welding fumes with zinc concentrations between 0.90 and 1.20 mg m.\n\nLifetime Occupational Exposure to Dusts, Gases and Fumes Is Associated with Bronchitis Symptoms and Higher Diffusion Capacity in COPD Patients\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRodrÃ­guez, Esther; Ferrer, Jaume; Zock, Jan-Paul; Serra, Ignasi; AntÃ³, Josep M.; de Batlle, Jordi; Kromhout, Hans; Vermeulen, Roel; Donaire-GonzÃ¡lez, David; Benet, Marta; Balcells, Eva; MonsÃ³, Eduard; Gayete, Angel; Garcia-Aymerich, Judith\n\n2014-01-01\n\nBackground Occupational exposure to dusts, gases and fumes has been associated with reduced FEV1 and sputum production in COPD patients.
