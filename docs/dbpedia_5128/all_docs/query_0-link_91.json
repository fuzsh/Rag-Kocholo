Such predictions have proven to be capricious. On the contrary, Korean cinema in the early decade of the twenty-ﬁrst century holds one of the most impressive box-oﬃce records among the active national ﬁlm industries. In an exhibition environment replete with modern multiplex theaters where Hollywood ﬁlms are known to have beaten every competitor, Korean cinema remains an anomaly. Its local products draw a large number of spectators—much larger than the days when quotas on import ﬁlms were more restrictive and ﬁlms relied on one-screen release. Korean cinema reached a historical climax in 2001 when it held all of the top ﬁve records in the annual box oﬃce. It was the ﬁrst proﬁtable year in decades for the entire industry, before production costs again rapidly exceeded the income revenue in 2002. The buying, selling, bankrupting, and rumored merging between two distribution giants (Cinema Service and cj Entertainment) have made up the bulk of headlines in trade magazines since then. The ﬁrst two years of the new millennium (2001–2) should be remembered for the rising popularity of crass comedy ﬁlms and the waning of the New Korean Cinema. Films like Kick the Moon (Silla ŭi tal pam), My Wife Is a Gangster (Chop’ok manura), Hi Dharma (Talma ya nolja), and Marrying the Maﬁa (Kamun ŭi yŏnggwang) topped the box-oﬃce chart for months and strongly reminded the Korean ﬁlm industry of a tactless tagline, ‘‘the box oﬃce is never\n\nwrong,’’ while the projects of many Korean directors whose names are synonymous with the New Korean Cinema, Im Kwon-Taek (Chiwaseon), Jang Sun-woo (The Resurrection of the Little Match Girl ), Park Kwang-su (The Trigger), and Hong Sang-su (Turning Gate), either were aborted at the development stage or failed to show proﬁtable ﬁgures to their investors. The preﬁx ‘‘new’’ that designated the crop of young ﬁlmmakers who emerged during the 1980s and the 1990s no longer became applicable. Their ﬁlms were incapable of impressing the new generation of ﬁlmgoers in the era of multiplex theaters. It is perhaps not a coincidence that this book on the New Korean Cinema is completed at a precise moment when it is ﬁnished as a movement. Though Korean cinema enjoys commercial success that is unprecedented in its history, many of its important production decisions are now made by distributors, corporate bigwigs, and talent agents rather than the writers and directors who constitute the very soul of the New Korean Cinema. Commercial priorities make artistic ones useless. The Korean ﬁlm industry since 1999 has scrupulously followed the path of Hollywood and has shown more interest in making deals and formulaic genres than in innovating and devoting itself to the creation of art. In this book, I am critical of the ways in which the ﬁlms of the New Korean Cinema have often refashioned the desire for ‘‘dominant men’’ as its most inscriptive trope, but I also duly acknowledge their eﬀorts to create ﬁlms that have made the historicization of Korean cinema a worthwhile scholarly venture. Throughout the book, I employ psychoanalytic terms like ‘‘fetishism,’’ ‘‘lack,’’ and ‘‘phallus’’ not to validate theory but to better elucidate recent Korean ﬁlms that have increasingly become ‘‘Westernized.’’ Contemporary South Korean society is no more Confucian than it is capitalist. There is no doubt in my mind that most people in Korea would agree that the present society demands one to express his/her self, ego, and personal pride even if this means losing the hope of cultivating oneself into a humble Confucian sage. The New Korean Cinema of the last two decades has incessantly pursued themes, characterizations, and narratives that center on a particular notion of subjectivity: the image of an individual modern man desperate to free himself from institutional repression, familial responsibilities, and personal anxieties. Mired in the praxis of carving this new image, it can be argued that the cinema of the recent years parallels not the ﬂourishing of its national traditional culture, but its rapid vanishing. In other words, the book aims to narrate the very cultural climate where the meaning of the ‘‘native’’ in the globalizing Korea has become obsolete.\n\nx\n\nI wish to gratefully acknowledge the help of many individuals and institutions that enabled me to write this book. Korea Foundation provided a valuable grant to assist my six-month research in Seoul in 1999–2000. The Korean Film Commission (kofic) and the Korean Film Archive also provided access to archives and ﬁlms that were essential to this research. Secretary General Kim Hye-jun at kofic was especially kind to provide still photographs, which are reprinted in this book. Mr. Kim and his assistant, Ms. Kim Mi-hyun, helped obtain the legal clariﬁcation on the reprint use of motion picture stills. The Humanities Center at University of California, Irvine (uci) and the Northeast Asia Council (neac) of the Association for Asian Studies also provided research funds for travel and other miscellaneous expenses. I would also like to thank the dean of my school and the former chair of my department at uci; Dean Karen Lawrence and Chair Steven D. Carter played vital roles in this project, allowing me more time to concentrate on the arduous yet gratifying task of writing. A number of friends and colleagues deserve special thanks for their suggestions and counsel. David E. James, Esther E. M. Yau, Henry H. Em, Chris Berry, Jim Fujii, Chungmoo Choi, Roland B. Tolentino, Akira Lippit, Eunsun Cho, Marsha Kinder, Ted Fowler, Kim U-chang, Soyoung Kim, Jinsoo An, and Tony Rayns have read parts of this manuscript from its dissertation stage and gave me encouragements to continue writing it. Kathleen McHugh and Nancy Abelmann also oﬀered me incisive editorial comments that were instrumental in writing chapter 8. I owe a particular debt to Rey Chow, one of the editors of the Asia-Paciﬁc series, for extending her invitation. David Scott Diﬀrient proofread the entire manuscript and kindly oﬀered many thoughtful insights. The two anonymous readers of my manuscript at the Duke University Press also provided sharp editorial comments. My friends at Cine 21 and Kino, two ﬁlm journals in Korea, gave me opportunities to publish Korean language ﬁlm reviews and criticisms. Writing in Korean and communicating my ideas to Korean readers helped me tremendously in the entire process of authoring this book. Kim Young-jin, Chung Sung-Ill, Lee Yeon-ho, Lee Young-jae, Huh Moon-young, and Nam Dong-chul especially deserve credit. Kino also helped me secure rare photographs. Many directors have oﬀered insights and shared with me behind-the-scenes stories. Many of these anecdotes could not be included in this book, but they were useful in painting a colorful backdrop of the South Korean ﬁlm industry during an occasionally dull, oftentimes tedious process. In particular, directors Park Kwang-su, Im Kwon-Taek, Jang Sun-woo, Park Ki-hyung, Park Ki-yong, Hong Sangsoo (Hong Sang-su), and Lee Chang-dong (Yi Ch’ang-dong) were all great companions. Most ﬁlms are made over a period of several years. I tried Acknowledgments xi\n\nmy best to clarify and analyze the work of these talented ﬁlmmakers after countless viewings of their ﬁlms, but all of my discussions, I am sure, will never quite match the rigor and labor in which they were created. I thank my parents, Byung Kon Kim and Yeon-sup Lee, who have always supported my scholarly pursuit. Lastly, Gina’s perceptive power, forbearance, and love all equally contributed in the making of this book. In many ways, she is the coauthor of this book.

Paek Mun-im (Seoul, Korea: Saminsa, 2002). Most libraries and Korean studies scholars in the United States conform to the romanization system that is known as the McCune-Reischauer system. The romanization of Korean terms, titles, and names in this book also follows this rule except for the names that have their own divergent orthography. The preferred names of certain directors whose works have been released in the United States have been retained without using the standard romanization system; they are Jang Sun-woo (Chang Sŏn-u), Park Kwang-su (Pak Kwang-su), and Im KwonTaek (Im Kwŏon-t’aek). Korean names are also transliterated in their native standard, with the surname ﬁrst.\n\nxii\n\nIntroduction: Hunting for the Whale\n\nW\n\nhale Hunting (Korae sanyang, Pae Ch’ang-ho, dir., 1984), one of Korea’s biggest box-oﬃce ﬁlms of the 1980s,1 begins with a fantasy sequence in which the protagonist, Pyŏng-t’ae, dreams that he is standing naked before a laughing public. He is scantily clothed and lined up with bodybuilders whose muscularity accentuates his unattractive, bantamweight physique. The audience in the auditorium hosting this competition bursts into laughter. His oversized eyeglasses, his gap-toothed grin, and his petit stature are laid bare on stage, where he is left alone after the bodybuilders exit. Pyŏng-t’ae slowly regains his conﬁdence and proceeds to strike a few bodybuilding poses, only to fall comically on his back. He is loudly jeered oﬀ the stage. Although the ﬁlm’s spectator at ﬁrst laughs along with the auditorium audience at this surreal scene, it doesn’t take long before the scornful laughter turns into sympathy. The scene thus sets the stage for the weak and emasculated Pyŏng-t’ae to make a strong appeal to the audience, who eventually want him to win back his love and, through a heterosexual reunion, regain his manhood. The audience will now root for him as he goes on the road to acquire his social, psychological, and libidinal autonomy. This dream symptomizes not only the fear and anxiety of Pyŏng-t’ae, an idealistic college student who pledges to ﬁnd a ‘‘whale’’ after failing to attract the attention of a female schoolmate he fancies, but also the predicament of a postcolonial and rapidly industrializing nation. Made just before the fervor for democracy hit the streets, Whale Hunting follows Pyŏng-t’ae as he falls in love with a mute prostitute, Ch’un-ja, and takes her back home to a remote island.\n\n(After being rejected by the student he desires, he had slept with Ch’un-ja at a brothel.2) Aided by Wang-ch’o, a wise vagabond with a mysterious past, they journey to the very edge of Korea in bitter cold weather. The trip is Pyŏng-t’ae’s quest for a heroic and autonomous identity through the realization of a romantic reunion while overcoming threats of death. Because this is ostensibly a comedy, many explicit symbols of male sexual anxiety are displayed through farcical situations. In one sequence, Pyŏng-t’ae narrowly escapes from a room full of outraged men by turning on a ﬁre extinguisher. The limp hose attached to the red can ‘‘ejaculates’’ its content of white ﬂuid. A couple of scenes later, he falls into a small pond located in a zoo. Cold, wet, and naked, Pyŏng-t’ae’s primitive instincts are revived in this act of rebirth. It is here that he declares to Wang-ch’o that he will help Ch’un-ja ﬁnd her way back home. (Ch’un-ja had been abducted from her hometown and sold into prostitution in the city.) Despite the fact that the three of them are hounded by a gang of muscular pimps equipped with sharp weapons, trendy motorcycles, and leather gear, the woman is returned to her mother. Upon the completion of their journey together, Ch’un-ja regains her voice, which was temporarily lost when she was traumatized in Seoul, and Pyŏng-t’ae regains his virility. This image of Pyŏng-t’ae as a wandering college student during the 1970s and the 1980s is a popular icon of Korean subculture,3 one that encapsulates several key themes. First, his transformation from a pathetic, masochistic, and aimless youth to a responsible man who is destined and determined to acquire his adulthood is the linchpin that anchors the narrative movement of not only Whale Hunting but also the New Korean Cinema of the 1980s and 1990s. This book traces the trajectory of masculinity as it undergoes this radical transformation, and seeks to explain the socio-political dynamics that underscore such narrative maneuvering. Second, the remasculinization of Pyŏng-t’ae can only be deﬁned by his relation to the woman and to historical trauma. The two characters who accompany Pyŏng-t’ae on his trip to look for a ‘‘whale,’’ the whore and the male vagabond, function as displacements for the ‘‘castrated’’ subject. The predicament of Pyŏng-t’ae, a college student from a privileged background, pales beside that of Ch’un-ja, the wretched whore. The pairing of Pyŏng-t’ae with a woman who is far more disenfranchised than he is helps to disavow his male anxiety.4 Pyŏng-t’ae’s relationship to the vagabond, who is euphemistically called Wangch’o (Captain), identiﬁes a more profoundly complicated and ruptured sense of history than the relationship between Pyŏng-t’ae and Ch’un-ja. Even though Wang-ch’o is a beggar who makes a living by panhandling for loose change in\n\n2\n\nAn explicit scene of male sexual anxiety. Whale Hunting (1984).\n\nWang-ch’o (left) accompanies Pyŏng-t’ae and Ch’un-ja on their quest to ﬁnd a ‘‘whale.’’ Whale Hunting (1984).\n\nthe street, he dispenses an eccentric authority and mysterious wisdom to which Pyŏng-t’ae immediately submits. ‘‘Who exactly are you?’’ asks Ch’un-ja when she recovers her voice. Is Wang-ch’o a former student activist who lost his mind after being tortured by the police? Or is he just a restless youth who left his bourgeois home in disgust to search for the truth and salvation associated with a Buddhist way of life? The ﬁlm does not answer these questions, but what is clear is that he is a camouﬂaged man who cannot easily reveal his past, a past that surely embodies a ‘‘trauma,’’ which Slavoj Žižek deﬁnes as ‘‘an impossible kernel which resists symbolization, totalization, symbolic integration.’’ 5 The character of Wang-ch’o resists any speciﬁc symbolic representation that linguistically deﬁnes his trauma, and he becomes a repository of the historical Real or, to use the Freudian ‘‘sublime,’’ an experience so intense that it cannot be properly enunciated. When asked by Ch’un-ja who he really is, Wang-ch’o ﬁrst winces painfully and then bursts into a playful dance and sings a p’umba, a ‘‘beggar’s song’’ that became popular during the 1980s. Wang-ch’o’s secret identity rests within the repetitive ‘‘ŏlssigo . . . . chŏlssigo’’ which he hums, a celebratory signiﬁer that has no speciﬁc meaning. Ch’un-ja has found her home and her voice and Pyŏng-t’ae has found his whale, but the words that can decode the mysteries of Wang-ch’o and link his identity to a speciﬁc event or to history remain unspoken; he is left as a ﬂoating subject. Only by the decade’s end will 4\n\nhis camouﬂage, madness, and ‘‘hidden kernel’’ be illuminated. This knowledge not coincidentally overlaps the arrival of the New Korean Cinema. The third theme that the icon of Pyŏng-t’ae embodies is resistance to an absolute, collective identiﬁcation to project a self that is deﬁned by private and libidinal principles. When Ch’un-ja’s home is found, Pyŏng-t’ae has to return to the city alone, and this fact represents a new subjectivity that departs from Confucian ideals or rural identity. Pyŏng-t’ae’s character has a modern selfawareness that is bewildered by both the resistance against and the need for social integration. He desires to be a free individual while also trying to struggle against an urban sense of alienation. The mission of ‘‘ﬁnding a home’’ is realized in the rural space where salient families and pastoral views putatively still exist. This helps to accentuate the city as a space of disﬁguration where beauty exists only in the imagination. Urban alienation is the theme of many Korean ﬁlms from the 1980s and the 1990s and sets up the psychic condition that depicts a typical crisis of a modern world where humans are severed from their natural environment. What is not so typical however is that the struggle for lucid interiorities and for the safe recovery of intelligible language from traumatic experiences is exercised in the exclusive domain of men’s fantasy. The symptom of dislocation is translated into a metaphor of the ‘‘whale’’ that stands in as an elusive phallus. This battling for an imaginary Whole on one hand underscores the phantasmal nature of modernity, but on the other lays the foundation for Korean cinema’s male anxiety. The spectral self-image of the male that perpetually suﬀers from the fantastic nightmare of deprivation, homelessness, and castration becomes something more desperately real in cinema than the reality itself.\n\nA Bad Guy The emasculation and alienation of male characters oﬀered strong political, economic, and cultural implications for both the intense industrialization and the harsh rule of military dictators from the 1960s to the 1980s. Throughout the early 1980s, the ﬁlms that featured the transformation of aimless and anxious men undergoing the process of maturity through violent, introspective searches were ubiquitous. Either physically handicapped or psychologically traumatized (sometimes both), many of the characters emblematized the period’s frustration when protest against the military government was disallowed. These men displayed rage, but they were only hapless victims who induced melodramatic viewer identiﬁcations. They commonly came from poor urban backgrounds, and they would leave for the countryside, the temples, and ultimately Introduction: Hunting for the Whale 5\n\nthe woman’s womb. With signiﬁcant strides toward political democratization and modernization came new themes that emerged out of the crisis and the loss such radical changes ushered. The quest for the self in this new period hinged upon a speciﬁcally gendered position, one that mobilized the question of subjectivity as it relates only to men. While the cinema embraced and yearned for a new historical agent, the negotiation of a post-authoritarian sensibility and value system was structurally rewoven through gendered relations that reinforced masculine subjects. This recuperation of male subjectivity was necessary in order for Korea to cope with its rapid shift into modern, industrial, urban, and global nationhood. Several representative images drawn from the most well known ﬁlms of the period illustrate this acute sense of masculine crisis. In A Fine, Windy Day (Param purŏ choŭn nal, Yi Chang-ho, dir., 1980), Kil-nam, a young man who works in a love motel, is swindled out of his money by a woman he loves. In frustration, he demonstrates his tae kwon do moves while a bulldozer digs a pit at a construction site in the background. His kicks and punches punctuate his rage, but they unthreateningly glide in the air without ﬁnding any speciﬁc target. Kil-nam’s slender body pathetically simulates an act of protest against the dominant power structure that has stripped him of money and love, but his protest draws nothing but silence. This vision of desperate masculinity evinces ineﬀectiveness and frailty when juxtaposed against the industrial machinery and corrupt urban space. It anticipates other forms of escape or search to redeem the self. In Mandala (Im Kwon-Taek, dir., 1981), Pŏb-un, a Buddhist monk, recites religious hymns while his devoted colleague Su-gwan burns his index ﬁnger to alleviate his psychological hardship. The practice of burning a part of the body to achieve spiritual sanctiﬁcation brings out the fear in Pŏbun, who chose a monastic life to escape memories of a childhood fraught with oedipal anxiety and traumatized by sexual obsessions. Pŏb-un’s asylum from his mother, his college girlfriend, and the red-light district in Seoul does not ease his anxieties but instead aﬃrms and aggravates his agony even more.6 The absence of the mother is sometimes as crucial to the son as is her presence. That mothers are cast to the periphery in many of these ﬁlms is hardly surprising given that frenzied postwar urbanization had seriously altered familial relations to a point where ‘‘mothers,’’ in their traditionally represented form, gradually disappeared from contemporary-milieu ﬁctions. Yet this absence of the mother had hardly nulliﬁed her fascinating and spectral presence, which is structured around the male subject’s unconscious desire to return safely to his place of origin. Even though the mothers are not ubiquitously present in Whale Hunting and Mandala, they are central to the narratives. 6\n\nPŏb-un (right) chooses a monastic life to escape his oedipal anxiety. Mandala (1981).\n\nIn Whale Hunting, Ch’un-ja comes home to her mother while Pyŏng-t’ae watches their reunion; at the end of Mandala, Pŏb-un reunites with his mother. In the ﬁlms made during this period often romantic desires and traumatic historical experiences are intertwined to evoke a vivid dream that drives ultimately toward the mother’s womb, a part of the female body where both sex and birth are sublimely conjured. For instance, Park Kwang-su’s second feature ﬁlm, Black Republic (Kŭdŭl to urich’ŏrŏm, 1990), which centrally depicts Kim Ki-yŏng, a blacklisted intellectual hiding in a mining town, unconsciously invokes the mother without physically representing her. In one crucial scene, after having been interrogated all night at the police station, he murmurs ‘‘ŏmŏni’’ (mother) while his girlfriend, Yŏng-suk, nurses him. ‘‘Ŏmŏni’’ is not discussed elsewhere in the ﬁlm, yet Ki-yŏng’s unconscious calling for his mother suggests that the ﬁlm has relegated the role of the ‘‘mother’’ to Yŏng-suk, a call girl. She is now both the ‘‘mother’’ and the lover for the dissident intellectual who is severed from his family because of his political troubles. Through the displacement of his anxieties onto Yŏng-suk, Ki-yŏng, who is disillusioned by the self-righteous dogma of the leftists, wishes to be reborn. The conﬂation of the iconic whore and mother aﬃrms and complements the masculine drive to disavow the need to sever the umbilical cord and comIntroduction: Hunting for the Whale 7\n\nfortably seek asylum in the woman’s womb. It is not coincidental that Yŏngsuk is physically ‘‘contaminated’’ but has a ‘‘heart of gold,’’ taking care of the man who is in danger.7 Since the transformation and recuperation of masculinity compose a crucial drive in the ﬁlms consulted in this book, it is perplexing that the representation of women has made virtually no progress in them. The images of women remain preﬁxed on the rigid, bifurcated conventions of whores and mothers. Although the ‘‘whore’’ is ﬁgured in a sexualized body and the ‘‘mother’’ putatively stands radically apart from it in a desexualized form, their roles as nurturers of the male subject attest to their resemblance, as far as their contingencies to men are concerned. Because I recognize that any discussion of masculinity hinges only upon its relationship with femininity, in reading the ﬁlms that best represent the South Korean cinema since 1980, I question how and why the representations of femininity remained strikingly unchanged while the representation of masculinity underwent various mutations and diversiﬁcations in conﬁguring itself to mould a modern subjectivity. The underrepresentation of women not only relegates them to marginal positions in cinema but also allows for the cinema to underscore themes that interest men. A misogynistic tendency against women constitutes perhaps the most visible and disturbing symptom of a cinema that has earned its reputation abroad as consisting primarily of ‘‘violent introspective melodramas.’’ 8 Perhaps nowhere are the violent melodramatic forms of narrative more prevalently featured than in the ﬁlms directed by Kim Ki-dŏk. His ﬁlms sparked controversies both in Korea and at international ﬁlm festivals at the turn of the century.9 So explicit is the violence (vivid representations of blood, scalping, bruises, and mutilated body parts) and so dramatic are the characters (dialogue and acting deliberately depart from realism) that the male subjectivity constructed by Kim gravitates toward performativity and deviancy. His narrative structure usually involves a wretched man who becomes infatuated and eventually captivated by the very woman whom he kidnaps and sexually violates. It allegorizes the pathetic men that have long been a ﬁxture of Korean cinema. Kim Ki-dŏk’s characters suﬀer from lack. But unlike the male protagonists of Hong Sang-su—another contemporary ﬁlmmaker with equal distinction—their lack is from both familial and economical deprivation. While Hong Sang-su’s male characters ﬁrmly pivot around an intellectual, middleclass background, Kim’s characters often constitute the lowest possible social stratum of hoodlums, pimps, beggars, and petty thieves. The only assets they have are their muscular bodies, and in this way Kim Ki-dŏk’s characters are distinguished from such wretched men as Pyŏng-t’ae in Whale Hunting. Their corporeal mastery, however, does not translate into psychic fulﬁllment. Their 8\n\ndesperate eﬀorts to ‘‘reintegrate’’ into the society that has already rejected them solicit pity, but also horror since the only viable option in their reacquisition of subjectivity is through women. In both Crocodile (Ak-gŏ, 1996) and A Bad Guy (Nappŭn namja, 2002), Kim Ki-dŏk uses the same narrative foregrounding: the women are kept captive by the male protagonist because he does not know any other way of loving the opposite sex. Despite the fact that there are abject qualities in Kim Ki-dŏk ﬁlms that lead the viewers to often pity the criminals, hoodlums, and other social outcasts, troubling issues linger. My contention rests not on the fact that his ﬁlms consistently appeal for the abnegation of the men who have committed rape, or that Kim’s depictions of sexual violence are too graphic, but rather that only men are given performative roles in them. Women function as masochistic and passive objects predicated on the patented image of mother and whore. The male characters shuﬄe between virtue and irredeemability, between care and violence, and between reality and fantasy while often the women must remain immutable even in these ‘‘folktale-like’’ ﬁlms. This pattern—so often conjured up in many of the ﬁlms analyzed in this book—begs a question: Could a story ever be conceived in Korean cinema that focuses on a self-centered woman who is freed from her duties as a mother or a wife, without framing her in the convention of a vamp? Even the best of the Korean directors that are featured in this book—while busy pursuing the male-oriented drive to recuperate their insuﬃciencies—have never seriously considered vital questions appertaining to women. Just as Hollywood has used the Vietnam War as a springboard for what Susan Jeﬀords describes as the ‘‘remasculinization of American culture,’’ South Korean cinema renegotiated its traumatic modern history in ways that reaﬃrm masculinity and the relations of dominance.10 The word ‘‘remasculinization’’ presumes a condition of threatened masculinity or emasculation. Men are, as Xueping Zhong writes in her study of masculinity in post-Mao literature, ‘‘besieged,’’ unable to overcome or transcend their anxieties and miseries.11 While the notion of emasculation in Korea’s popular culture discourse intended to serve as a critique of masculinization ushered in by the postwar military regimes, the tremendous attention paid to emasculated masculine subjectivities did not forgo masculine themes and ideology. Instead, these popular narratives, like the one featuring Pyŏng-t’ae, invoked the need for masculine rejuvenation that ironically ended up aﬃrming the hegemonic political agenda rather than resisting it. The depictions of emasculated and humiliated male subjects set the stage for their remasculinization, and occasioned a revival of images, cultural discourses, and popular ﬁctions that fetishized and imagined dominant men Introduction: Hunting for the Whale 9\n\nAgent Yu signals a departure from the traumatized male character of the 1980s. Shiri (1999).\n\nand masculinity. And the longing for an ideal male hero became integrated in the production of a new symbol for Korea in the era of industrialized, modern, and global subject formation. By the late 1990s, the typical representation of Korean men in cinema was no longer solely composed of self-loathing and pathetic male characters; images of well-proportioned bodies in sleek suits and professional jobs also began to appear with regularity and unprecedented force. No longer merely the targets of public embarrassment, many screen males emerged instead as objects of desire. One of the deﬁning moments of masculine rejuvenation can be found in Shiri (Kang che-gyu, dir., 1999). The ﬁlm focuses on Yu, a South Korean intelligence agent, who counterplots against North Korean agents—forces that conspire to nullify the reconciliatory mood between the two Koreas. Stylistically departing from the realist convention of the 1980s, the ﬁlm also tosses together several formulaic genre codes: a stolen bomb, romantic betrayal, and conspiracy theories. The masculinity of Shiri’s protagonist veered away from the Korean male icons of the 1980s, but it did so by simulating Hollywood action heroes. Alert, expeditious, and physical, Agent Yu represented a popular cookie-cutter version of blockbuster-type masculinity, one that stretches fanfare and familiarity across national borders.12 The recovery of masculinity from Pyŏng-t’ae’s ﬂaccidity is evinced through the heroic ﬁguration of a government agent who must defend the security of the nation, and it oﬀers nostalgic references to the local 10\n\nviewers who had grown up watching anticommunist spy dramas on television in a nation that had not yet moved beyond the cold war era. Even though Shiri demonstrated that the subject of masculine domination has again become fashionable in a once-traumatized nation, the following year’s blockbuster, jsa: Joint Security Area (Kongdong kyŏngbi kuyŏk jsa, Pak Ch’an-uk, dir., 2000), also reminded us that the continuing national crisis of military confrontation between the two Koreas hardly ferments a hegemonic cinematic masculinity completely beyond trauma. In jsa, Su-hyŏk, a private who is guarding the South Korean border of the dmz, is disturbed by the fact that his crossing of the border at night to mingle with his North Korean counterpart has produced a bloody melée, leaving several men—including his friends—dead. This conﬁrms that the war is not a thing of the past but remains the crux of the present crisis. Su-hyŏk’s inability to tell the truth to his superiors puts him in a state of shock and schizophrenia. It reminds us of the dysfunctional characters that so haunted South Korean cinema throughout the 1980s and the early 1990s, best represented by a sentiment stammered by Tŏk-pae in A Fine, Windy Day: ‘‘it is best to remain mute even when you know how to speak.’’ Unable to free himself from psychological guilt and the weight of history that punishes even the slightest gesture of reconciliation between the North and the South, Su-hyŏk takes his own life in the end. The friendship he had fostered with a North Korean soldier transgressed the nation’s ban of personal contact with the enemy, a condition that usually prompts narratives of sentimental love and tragic denouements.13 These two images of manhood—one of Agent Yu, an exemplary depiction of a self-suﬃcient and attractive man, and the other of severely traumatized Su-hyŏk, whose life must be claimed at the end—project subjectivities that seem radically distant from each other. Yet they are both crucially bound to the hegemonic values of modern gendered self-awareness, borne of individualism, fantasy, and narcissism. Both are ambitiously articulate and project desires that carve out an identity that can better accommodate the newly shaped modern environment. The last two decades, the 1980s and the 1990s, bracket South Korea’s transformation from an insular, authoritarian society to one that is more cosmopolitan, global and post-authoritarian. The dawning of a new modern era is normally punctuated by hope and optimism, but the weight of intense history and its attendant violence loomed so excessively large that it ended up traumatizing, marginalizing, and denaturalizing men. Wrecked and disordered was the male subjectivity after the Korean War, the subsequent division, and the continuing legacy of colonialism through military dictatorship; the metaphor of the ‘‘symbolic lack’’ was astutely installed as one of the primary Introduction: Hunting for the Whale 11\n\nthematic impulses in the postwar cinemas. The male lack was located in every ﬁeld imaginable: of the accoutrements of power in sexual potency, paternal authority, communal function, historical legitimacy, and professional worth. The South Korean ﬁlms of this period sought to reorient the subject back on its track into the Lacanian Symbolic where language could be reacquired, the Name of the Father reissued, and the castration anxiety disavowed. The next section presents a few conceptual strands through which I intend to frame the male subject and its unnatural representations—both splendid and inauspicious—in recent ﬁlms. Death and the Modern Odysseus is warned by Circe, that divinity of reversion to the animal, whom he resisted and who therefore gives him strength to resist other powers of disintegration. But the allurement of the Sirens remains superior; no one who hears their song can escape. Men had to do fearful things to themselves before the self, the identical, purposive, and virile nature of man, was formed, and something of that recurs in every childhood. [my emphasis] The strain of holding the I together adheres to the I in all stages; and the temptation to lose it has always been there with the blind determination to maintain it. The narcotic intoxication which permits the atonement of deathlike sleep for the euphoria in which the self is suspended, is one of the oldest social arrangements which mediate between self-preservation and self-destruction—an attempt of the self to survive itself.—Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno (1943)14 Max Horkheimer and Theodor W. Adorno invoked this famous passage from Homer’s story to illustrate, ﬁrst, that the impending danger of civilization, progress, and modernity could not be detached from the allurement of destruction, death, and fascism; and second, that the obedience of laborers (Odysseus’s men) would cause them voluntarily to enslave their bodies and souls to allow their master to indulge in the Siren’s songs. The competing temptation between death and pleasure is only compromised when the laborers plug wax in their ears while Odysseus is ‘‘bound impotently to the mast.’’ 15 The sexual innuendos raised by the ‘‘impotence’’ to which the ‘‘virile’’ man has bound himself are as equally lurid in the passage above as the references to fascism and the critique of capitalism. This psychic repression to which the man has voluntarily yielded is a perplexing, irresolvable paradox of the modern. That there is a touch of Freud in the above passage is undeniable. The conﬂict between ‘‘self-preservation’’ and ‘‘self-destruction’’ that the self must me12\n\ndiate was also a matter of urgency and of tremendous importance in the work of Freud. To him, the death drive was as instinctual to humans as ‘‘life instincts’’ that are composed of self-preservative and sexual instincts. In Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud initially writes, ‘‘[The sexual instincts] are the true life instincts. They operate against the purpose of the other instincts, which leads, by reason of their function, to death.’’ 16 But in what seems to be a swift movement away from the bifurcated system where the two instincts of selfpreservation (life) and self-destruction (death) are knotted in fundamental opposition, Freud states later in the same essay that ‘‘the drawing of a sharp distinction between the ‘ego-instincts’ and the sexual instincts, and the view that the former exercises pressure towards death and the latter towards a prolongation of life’’ is ‘‘bound to be unsatisfactory in many respects even to ourselves.’’ 17 The diﬃculty of separating the ego instinct (which he equated with death) from the sexual instinct (which he equated with life) is attributed to their critical link commonly bound to the libido that is surely sexual, while also ‘‘operat[ing] in the ego.’’ 18 This ambivalence created by Freud (who himself was perplexed by ‘‘so many bewildering and obscure processes’’ 19) drew the life and death instincts closely together rather than in a binary opposition. But also articulated in this framework are the critical workings of libido, repression, and the phallic lack that form the basis of the modern principles of desire—a formula that is rooted in the masculine universe. It is interesting that the risk of pleasure even at the cost of death is strongly tied to the constitution of a modern subjectivity that acknowledges the miscues and frailties in mapping its autonomous terrain and that overcomes the historical burden that has troubled it. There are many scenes of violence in recent Korean ﬁlms, but also equally ubiquitous are images of tormented men who end up destroying themselves. From blockbuster ﬁlms like jsa and Libera Me (Yang Yun-mo, dir., 2000) to low-budget ﬁlms directed by auteurs like Hong Sang-su and Kim Ki-dŏk (The Day a Pig Fell into the Well [Tweji ga umul e ppajin nal, 1996] and Crocodile), it is not uncommon to ﬁnd endings where the protagonists commit suicide. The death drive is intricately tied to the lure— simultaneously libidinal and narcissistic—that seeks to both preserve life and edge closer to death. The compulsion toward death that is a recurrent motif in many ﬁlms demonstrates that ontological ﬁnality is inseparable from the fallible masculinities imagined on screen. The death drive and the reconstitution of the elusive phallus posit an inevitable goal of many narrative movements in the ﬁlms so far discussed. Pyŏng-t’ae also struggles against death at the end of Whale Hunting. During the climax, he is threatened at the edge of the cliﬀ by three villains—the Introduction: Hunting for the Whale 13\n\npimps who have come to claim their eloped woman. The ambition to prove his worth as a man—the ﬁlm claims—can only be actualized by an earnest sacriﬁce, one that must oﬀer nothing short of his life. The ﬁlm casts Pyŏng-t’ae as a hero, not by having him outmuscling or outsmarting the villains to save her, but by pleading to them that he is prepared to sacriﬁce anything, including his life, to complete his mission. When Pyŏng-t’ae disappears from the frame after being thrown oﬀ the cliﬀ by the pimps, viewers are momentarily startled by the possibility of his death. But he soon reemerges from the edge of the cliﬀ— without his glasses and scars on his face—in essence to proclaim the arrival of a new self. The villains are surprised. Showing a glimpse of humanity, they turn their backs and leave for Seoul . . . without the girl. Pyŏng-t’ae emerges victorious; he has found his ‘‘whale,’’ a ‘‘phallic’’ metaphor in the ﬁlm’s title that has been referred to as his elusive object. The reclamation of the phallus—to follow Lacan—is desired only in an imagined form because of the very impossibility of attaining it. The choice of the ﬁlm to end with the reclamation of Pyŏng-t’ae’s manhood is then only a male fantasy that seeks to suture the viewers to fetishistic and misogynistic conventions typical in a Hollywood ﬁlm. But this salvation is only momentary and incomplete, as the ﬁlm will conclude by placing Pyŏng-t’ae back on the road with Wang-ch’o while singing the beggar’s song, p’umba. The modern subjectivity conceived in the Korean ﬁlms of the 1980s and the 1990s is both gendered and endangered. Ubiquitously present in many of the characters in the ﬁlm is a wound, an inerasable scar that atrophies the screen subjects and activates an objet petit a, the ‘‘Other’’ in the Lacanian graph of retroactivity and the slippery object of desire that is centrally ﬁgured in the question, ‘‘What is ‘it’ that the other wants of me?’’ 20 So scarred is the castrated subject that the male lack in Korean ﬁlms is almost a normative function of masculinity. Struggling to accommodate Korea’s rapidly changing social and personal relations, men often ﬁnd themselves to be incompatible with individualism and its values that deﬁne the new world. The male subject’s pursuit of the mastery of his world (his family, home, work, etc.) and knowledge is repeated ceaselessly, and with it the phallus emerges as a signiﬁer of both desire and destruction, precisely because it is a fetishistic object that lures the castrated male subject as the ‘‘it.’’ In all of the ﬁlms directed by Hong Sang-su, The Day a Pig Fell into the Well, The Power of Kangwon Province (Kangwon do ŏi him, 1998), and Virgin Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors (O, Sujŏng, 2000), the elusive object of the ‘‘it,’’ for which many of his characters are searching, at least on the surface, self-explanatorily articulates itself. ‘‘It’’ functions primarily in the sexual realm, which triggers aromatic pursuit. Suﬀocating underneath the tightly-sealed so14\n\ncial system still dictated by Confucian decorum, the ‘‘it’’ becomes intransigently a symbol of obsession and frustration. Even when sexual unions do materialize through adulterous aﬀairs in dingy, cramped motel rooms, psychic wounds are not healed, but expose further pain. The desire for intimacy and romance in Hong’s ﬁlms is denaturalized, as phrases such as ‘‘I would like love you,’’ exchanged between a call girl and a married man on a business trip, enters ‘‘a system of exchange: an economy of intimacy governed . . . . by scarcity, threat, and internalized prohibition.’’ 21 The artiﬁciality of the love motels, where the glow of neon lights seeps inside, unfortunately elicits a moral dilemma that intensiﬁes guilt and repression rather than spiritually liberates men. Ultimately, the ‘‘it’’ that manifests the lack of the subject cannot be satiated nor eliminated.\n\nFictionalizing History in the Era of Military Rule For a nation that underwent several historical traumas during the twentieth century, emasculation was a normal rather than aberrant condition. Korea was violently ravaged and virtually annihilated during the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century. It was colonized by Japan from 1910 to 1945, and the subsequent civil war, lasting from 1950 to 1953, totally destroyed any sign of industry, pride, and humanity. What was even more devastating than the direct impact of the war was the denial of a peace process between the two Koreas after the war. The cold war replaced the hot war during the remaining half of the century when both North and South Korea claimed victory. There was thus no chance to come to terms with psychic wounds or war traumas. The rivalry between the two Koreas also necessitated rebuilding an eﬃcient economy that could hurry along postwar industrialization under tightly disciplined political and ideological structures. Regarded as a bulwark against communism by the United States, South Korea was a valuable American ally in the northeast Asian region for its strategic cold war purposes throughout the remainder of the half-century. Under the auspices of the United States, Korea quickly became a model of economic success for developing nations that could not aﬀord to ‘‘sentimentalize’’ its war wounds and simply redirected its painful past into vehement expression of anticommunism and spectacular war heroism. The traumas promulgated by the colonial experience, a destructive war, and repressive military rule explicitly compelled a sense of anguish and misery that demanded attention, but the prerogative given to the rejuvenation of a masculine identity under the era of President Park Chung Hee (1961–79) deterred it from becoming a pivotal element in the dominant ﬁctions of the day. Any successful fascist regime seeks to blur the boundary between society’s Introduction: Hunting for the Whale 15\n\nreality and the ‘‘dominant ﬁction’’: the stories of the nation’s birth and the heroic accounts of mythological ﬁgures burdened with a historical base as if they are no longer mythological. Taking her cues from Jacques Rancière, Louis Althusser, and Ernesto Laclau, Kaja Silverman considers the term ‘‘dominant ﬁction’’ a ‘‘popular-democratic interpellation’’ that ‘‘represents primarily a category for theorizing hegemony.’’ 22 The consensus critical for amassing this hegemony was of course mobilized from images and stories that recounted history from a speciﬁc ideological perspective. Invoking Confucianism and the renewal of masculine nationalism as two founding principles of war-ridden Korea, Park Chung Hee urged the authoring of an ‘‘androcentric,’’ militaristic view of history that was transposed to cinema.23 During the 1970s, strong male agencies began forcefully to appear in Korean cinema. Yi Sun-shin, a wartime hero during Hideyoshi Toyotomi’s invasion of Korea (1592–99), was widely disseminated as a cultural model of Korea’s nation-narration process.24 As the leader of the naval ﬂeet that had at its disposal the world’s ﬁrst armor-clad warships called Kŏbuksŏn (Turtle Ships), the maritime admiral Yi was the sacriﬁcial hero who best represented Korea when it sought to reorganize its economy from a spectacular light industry of textile to a heavy industry of steel, shipbuilding, and automobiles. His dramatic death pictured in the middle of a battle was widely disseminated as an oﬃcial image that best suited the imagination of self-eﬀacing, fascinating, and sacriﬁcial nationhood and masculinity. Yi Sun-shin was one of the onscreen agencies in the 1970s, a period when the Golden Age of Korean Cinema of the 1960s was woefully dismantled.25 His iconicity was cinematically reproduced to appease the government, which oﬀered a lucrative license to distribute foreign ﬁlms only to the companies that made what were certiﬁed as ‘‘quality ﬁlms’’ (usu yŏnghwa).26 Yi Sun-shin the Hero (Sŏngung Yi Sun-shin, Yi Kyu-ung, dir.) was made in 1971 as a costly venture. Even though this ﬁrst release was only moderately successful even after a massive public campaign to encourage people to see it, Yi Sun-shin was depicted again in The Diary of the Korean-Japanese War (Nanjung Ilgi, Chang Il-ho, dir., 1977), another expensive epic.27 As more narratives of nation-saving heroes and their sacriﬁces dominated screens, people were less inclined to visit movie theaters, extinguishing the postwar fervor for cinema that spurred the Golden Age.28 There was one crucial reason for the failure of Yi Sun-shin to generate more popular success for ushering an eﬀective ‘‘dominant ﬁction.’’ Even though Yi Sun-shin projected a version of masculinity that vied to sever the tradition of emasculated males that conditioned the popular projections of Korean screen masculinity,29 it was an icon that oﬀered a good view of total and self-sacriﬁcing 16\n\nbelief, not one of modern sensibilities and dilemmas that celebrate nuclear family values and pit social mores against private desires—a key to most ﬁlm industries’ success in the postwar era. The public would have to wait two more decades before a salient manhood could eschew collective imagination and renew the irresistible, combustible, libidinal energy eliminated after the Golden Age. Only after the name of the father was suﬃciently processed in a cycle of desecration, disavowal, and re-inscription, I will argue, would the conveyance of a new male subjectivity—persuasive and aﬀable—become possible. The 1980s was the decade of post-trauma—one that anxiously awaited the replacement of a father-ﬁgure of South Korea and the implementation of a social structure alternative to capitalist relations, both of which would not materialize.30 Two events spurred the crisis that momentarily blacked out public conscience before reawakening it at the end of the decade. First, on October 26, 1979, Park Chung Hee was shot to death after almost twenty years of tyrannical rule.31 Tightly controlling freedom of expression, labor wages, and market laws, he had been responsible for laying the economic foundation of the socalled ‘‘Miracle of the River Han.’’ (The economic infrastructure dependent on the system of chaebols [conglomerates], however, eventually produced Korea’s bankruptcy in 1997.) So sudden and unexpected was Park’s assassination by his right-hand man that the news shocked the nation.32 Park Chung Hee’s legacy has been so strong that he still inﬂuences Korean politics even in the twenty-ﬁrst century, two decades after his death. The second event to put the nation into an even deeper crisis was a massacre that took place in Kwangju,33 the regional capital of Chŏlla Province in the southwest, only a few months after Park’s death, and startled the nation even more. Representing the region of neglect and underdevelopment for many decades, the city of Kwangju in May 1980 staged an uprising and demanded the removal of Chun Doo Hwan, a general who rose to power in a silent coup. In an eﬀort to restore order, Chun, who would soon declare himself president later that year, ordered the deployment of special forces to Kwangju. Those forces reportedly ‘‘bayoneted students, ﬂayed women’s breasts, and used ﬂamethrowers on demonstrators’’ in urban streets.34 These acts of unspeakable atrocity that claimed the lives of more than two thousand civilians—more violent than the ones remembered when the people’s liberation army from North Korea brieﬂy controlled the city during the Korean War—had a lasting impact because they were immediately silenced. Kwangju did not receive as much attention from the international media—unlike the ‘‘global’’ response to China’s Tiananmen— because the United States chose to acquiesce and condone the atrocities in Kwangju even though Americans had far more inﬂuence on South Korean miliIntroduction: Hunting for the Whale 17\n\ntary matters than the South Koreans themselves. Because of the biased local report announcing the massacre as the roundup of ‘‘North Korean spies and leftist inﬁltrators,’’ as well as the period of terror that continued well after Kwangju (through the silencing and sentencing to death of political leaders, including Kim Dae Jung), the massacre did not immediately summon national rage and grief. But it would continue to serve as Korea’s Tiananmen, which for the next two decades became a specter that haunted South Korean politics. The events at Kwangju eventually led to a popular movement for democracy in the latter part of the decade. Ultimately, the two generals (also the two former presidents) responsible for the crime, Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo, were found guilty by the court in 1996. Kwangju split the already partitioned nation in half. The loss of Park Chung Hee loomed large especially in his home province of Kyŏngsang in the southeast, which had reaped the most beneﬁt from his tenure. And the thousands who were killed in Kwangju by the soldiers deployed by Chun Doo Hwan (who like Park was also from the Kyŏngsang Province) left an indelible scar in the psyche of Chŏlla, Korea’s southwest. In all of the elections held since then, the vote is split along regional background more than along gender, class, or education.35 The 1980s was an anomalous decade that accommodated both leftist insurgence and consumerist excess. Two so-called ‘‘Springs of Democracy’’ took place, one in 1980 and another in 1987, which ﬂowered the streets with an intense yearning for democracy. The authoritarian center was temporarily weakened before its hegemony was restored through political compromises and the inability of the dissident politicians to agree on a united front. It was a period of political inquietude when millions of people marched in the streets protesting the military rule and the complicit role of the United States in sustaining dictatorships in South Korea. It was also complicated by the fact that economic prosperity enabled millions to found their middle-class identities in the boulevards, shopping malls, and high-rise apartment buildings that mushroomed throughout Seoul.36 The value placed on thrift savings and frugality to foster an export-oriented economic structure during the Park era was thrown out in dramatic fashion, replaced with a consumerist culture of high spending that boosted the domestic economy by the late 1980s.37 By then, the state had learned the secret recipes of Western-style capitalism, which was built on the fostering of middle-class identity and consumption. With over forty million people (about half of the population concentrated in cosmopolitan areas) and the per capita annual income reaching U.S.$5,000 during the 1980s, South Korean domestic markets attracted the interests of foreign companies. The shift of the so18\n\ncial values (developments of suburbia, consumer spending, system of personal credit and loans) and the expansion of the middle class were the key ingredients in fertilizing the major industries of electronics and automobiles during the 1980s that no longer simply relied on exports.38 Laura C. Nelson writes, ‘‘Following the Olympics [in 1988], local markets oﬀered a greatly increased supply of imported consumer goods. These imports entered into the material and imaginative lives of people in Seoul.’’ 39 Chun diﬀered from his predecessor, Park, at least on one account by recognizing the importance of leisure and consumer spending as the crucial engine of capitalism and the comfort pill for the masses to temporarily forget the dispossession of their voting rights.40 Complementing the time of radical change, a new consumerist culture was made available through special rates for loans on cars, electronic goods, and furniture and in new retail stores, credit cards, and homes, which were in previous decades denied to the middle class. An attempt to curtail and condemn public excesses and foreign imports also appeared.\n\nPeppermint Candy If the cinema in the 1970s vied to inscribe an unimpaired masculine icon, one that forged a ‘‘dominant ﬁction’’ out of collective historical memory, the cinema that was touted in the Western ﬁlm festival circuits during the late 1980s and the 1990s as the New Korean Cinema attained its status, I argue, by demythologizing the name of the national father for the sake of issuing a new modern masculinity. Initially ﬁguring characters who remained candidly fallible and inept without eﬀecting any speciﬁc allegiance to the historical traumas throughout the early part of the 1980s, masculinities were shored up to directly confront the male lack and its historical origin by the decade’s end. Canvassing a wide range of classes from the alienated intellectual son from a bourgeois family to the traumatized hoodlum wandering in the dilapidated section of the city, the cinematic subjects of the modern era that were rushed onto ﬁlm were gendered, with the aim of rewriting history from the perspective of the male individual. The ﬁlms of Park Kwang-su and Jang Sun-woo, who began their careers toward the end of the 1980s, distinguished themselves from the unremarkable cinema of ‘‘quota quickies’’ and ‘‘quality ﬁlms’’ of the 1970s and the 1980s, as did the works of Im Kwon-Taek that throughout the decade represented Korean cinema in overseas festivals.41 Park and Jang decoded and interrupted what the oﬃcial history constituted as the master narrative by engaging public traumas in the private domains. No longer were screen subjects willing to sacriﬁce their lives for the nation. The New Korean Cinema’s contestation was waged not Introduction: Hunting for the Whale 19\n\nonly against the oﬃcial historiography of South Korea that consistently invoked nationalist agencies but also against the new minjung (people’s) history that claimed to be the ‘‘collective will of the people’’ while countering the government’s version.42 The ﬁlms of the New Korean Cinema, which later constituted the ﬁlms directed by Yi Ch’ang-dong and Hong Sang-su, further invoked pains and injuries that extended far beyond their individual psyche, while standing at odds with what Ernesto Laclau calls a ‘‘will to ‘totality.’ ’’ 43 Instead of oﬀering closure to historical questions, the New Korean Cinema opted for an indeterminate open-endedness; rather than ﬁrmly shoring up a historical subjectivity, the ﬁlms denied easy accessibility to its coherence and salience. These ﬁlms claimed that the truth was more diﬃcult to expose because of its discursive and subjective condition. In other words, these new Korean ﬁlms, while allegorizing history, denied the rendering of the immanent subjectivity that is predestined in an absolute hold of, what Fredric Jameson termed, the ‘‘Necessity,’’ something that explains ‘‘what happened had to happen the way it did.’’ 44 There were two strands of masculinities that stood out in the New Korean Cinema. The new men were in crises, ﬁrst in forms of angry young men and second, more speciﬁcally, as intellectual writers. The images of angry young men persisted throughout the last two decades of the twentieth-century: a male protagonist working as a barber’s assistant slashes to death a loan shark who has been having a secret aﬀair with the woman he loves in A Fine, Windy Day; two billboard painters climb to the rooftop of a high-rise building in Seoul to privately demonstrate their pent-up frustrations in Chilsu and Mansu (Ch’ilsu wa Man-su, Park Kwang-su, dir., 1988); a college student leaves Seoul when two of his best friends kill themselves in a protest against, respectively, the antidemocratic government and Confucian family values in The Portrait of Youth (Chŏlmŭn nal ŭi ch’ŏsang, Kwak Chi-kyun, dir., 1991); a soldier accidentally shoots and kills a child in Kwangju only to suﬀer a life-long debacle that eventually leads to his suicide in Peppermint Candy (Pakha sat’ang, Yi Ch’ang-dong, dir., 1999). These images of despair widely proliferated even as the struggle for democracy intensiﬁed during the late 1980s and the early 1990s, and they continued to linger in the latter decade because of the incessant national crisis caused by political uncertainty and economic decline. These epigraphs and the increasing images of angry men and their violence replaced the Korean cinema’s tendency to create masochistic and self-loathing characters. Youth violence— sometimes explicit and disturbing—was surely redemptive and cathartic like those pictured in other emergent national cinemas of the West and Japan during the post-World War II era, and the compulsion toward inwardness and selfdestruction tendered and imagined a pure form of male subjectivity. 20\n\nAfter a period of crisis, that many representative images of the New Korean Cinema picture writers who are anxious over their work should perhaps come as no surprise. As Michel Foucault writes, ‘‘[w]riting . . . automatically dictates that we place ourselves in the virtual space of self-representation and reduplication.’’ 45 The birth of a new self was sought through the claim to language that is integral to writing and representation. Chŏng Chi-yŏng’s White Badge (Hayan chŏnjaeng, 1990), Jang Sun-woo’s To You, from Me (Nŏ ege narŭl ponenda, 1994), Park Kwang-su’s A Single Spark (Arŭmdaun ch’ŏngnyŏn Chŏn T’ae-il, 1996), and Hong Sang-su’s The Day a Pig Fell into the Well all pivot their narratives around a male writer who in his thirties is undergoing personal crisis, something that is stalling his writing. Han Ki-ju in White Badge is a novelist recounting his personal experiences in Vietnam as a Korean mercenary soldier. A couple of months have passed since the death of Park Chung Hee, and he enjoys an unprecedented—albeit brief—freedom in artistic creativity. But his only surviving comrade from the war, Private Pyŏn, appears in his life for the ﬁrst time since the war and startles him by showing signs of insanity and suicidal tendencies. This—compounded by the fact that his wife has left him—makes his remembrance and narration of the war diﬃcult, if not impossible. In a drama that situates his writer’s block as the primary thematic anxiety that needs disentanglement for both narratives’ successful resolutions (the novel in the ﬁlm and the ﬁlm itself ), equally crucial is Han’s recovery from sexual impotence that has already cost him a wife. In To You, from Me, the writer also suﬀers from penile impotence—just when his friend who works as a bank clerk recovers from his own medical impotence—in the middle of the ﬁlm when he is exposed and humiliated by his girlfriend to be a porn writer in disguise. Unlike Han in White Badge, who recovers his writing ability as well as his manhood through a violent ending when he abets the suicide of Private Pyŏn, the writer in Jang Sun-woo’s ﬁlm is never able to liberate himself from his writing block, something that torments him when he pledges to return to the serious writing of novels. In an unconventional move that has patented Jang’s work in the last decade, To You, from Me disallows the male subject to recuperate from his phallic loss or opt for self-destruction after lamenting his fallibility. He will simply accept—happily—his new role as the assistant/chauﬀeur of his girlfriend who has become a media star. The two writers in A Single Spark and The Day a Pig Fell into the Well (hereafter written as The Day) do not suﬀer from penile dysfunction, but their writings are equally complicated by women in their lives. In A Single Spark, Kim Yŏng-su, an underground intellectual who is determined to author a biography of a labor union martyr ﬁve years after his self-immolation, is living with Introduction: Hunting for the Whale 21\n\nhis girlfriend. As a worker in a small factory that has no union representation, she tries to organize a union despite the company’s violent and treacherous eﬀort to disband it. She is in a perilous situation moreover because she is pregnant with Kim’s child, heaping more pressure on him and his work. The Day also depicts the banal everyday life of a writer, Kim Hyo-sŏp; his loitering in cafés and restaurants, waiting for his paycheck at the publisher’s, and drinking at an evening dinner party are meticulously depicted. His debacle and eventual death are precipitated by his love aﬀairs. He is in love with a married woman who cannot easily leave her husband. Because he is not able to fulﬁll his desire all the time, Hyo-sŏp keeps a girlfriend, someone lesser than him in social stature, who holds true admiration of him. Rather than spending his day writing, he oscillates between the two women, living in anxieties generated by the male lack and the libidinal economy that is asynchronous with his solemn reality. The authorial subjectivity and consciousness in the ﬁctional ﬁlms mentioned above are only secured through either the remembrance of traumatic history (White Badge and A Single Spark) or the acknowledgment of its impossibility of remembering (To You, from Me and The Day). In both instances, however, unconsciously raised is the profundity of sexual matter that privatizes the trauma in the phallic function. The impregnation of the woman, the inability of the penis to erect, the illicit adultery, the exposure of the novelist as a soft-porn writer, all point to the male phallus as the elusive yet critical origin where wounds of the day are articulated. The desire for psychic wholeness and the putative recovery from the male lack continue to be asserted throughout the two decades, perhaps best appropriated in the ﬁlm that drew the curtain on the period: Peppermint Candy. Covering the two decades focused upon in this book, Peppermint Candy addresses the male lack and delineates its historical roots. In it, the polyvalence against the linear time is made possible by structuring the ﬁlm’s narrative movement in reverse order, beginning with a prologue in spring 1999 and ending with a segment that takes place twenty years earlier at the same place where the ﬁlm began. The time progresses backward without the use of ﬂashback, arranging the seven segments to travel in reverse after the prologue, from 1999, 1994, 1987, 1984, 1980, and to 1979.46 If ‘‘the libidinal investment of patriarchal capitalism,’’ according to Helene Moglen, can be exposed through the ‘‘link between materialism and desire,’’ 47 there is one more theme that Peppermint Candy tries to to link to the strains in Korea’s postwar industrialization and patriarchy: the historical trauma as the origin and also the culprit for its dubious failure. Unveiled is the origin of trauma that was previously concealed in a ﬁlm like Whale Hunting. Peppermint 22\n\nYŏng-ho (left) joins the police force, which routinely tortures labor activists during the 1980s. Peppermint Candy (1999).\n\nCandy reveals that Yŏng-ho’s troubles began in May 1980 when he, as a conscripted soldier, was sent to Kwangju to quell the uprising. He was wounded, and while injured he had accidentally shot and killed a local girl. Before his involvement in Kwangju in his early twenties, the ﬁlm has already chronicled his downward spiral where he had taken part in crisis after crisis. If one takes the narrative in linear time, not in its ﬁlmic rearrangement, Yŏng-ho accepts a job in the police force after Kwangju and takes an active role in cracking down on labor and student movements during the 1980s. Just around the time when a civilian president is inaugurated in Korea in 1993 for the ﬁrst time in thirty years, he quits the force and becomes an owner of a small business. It is here that he gets involved in an adulterous aﬀair with his young staﬀ. After a brief ﬁnancial success, Yŏng-ho, like the Korean economy that suﬀered bankruptcy, falls on hard times. In 1999, the year the ﬁlm begins, his wife, whom he had consistently neglected and brutally beaten, is no longer with him, and he lives isolated in a ﬂimsy shack. He ultimately commits suicide. There are many metaphors for nostalgic references and masculine anxiety that the ﬁlm literally renders: a bullet wound in the leg during the Kwangju massacre suﬀered by the protagonist (like the toothache of Ch’ŏl-ho in The Stray Bullet, a 1960 classic) returns as a physical limp at later moments of crisis and Introduction: Hunting for the Whale 23\n\npunctuates his irredeemable phallic lack; the peppermint candy, symbolizing the sweet love and pure emotions of youth, is ﬁrst cherished by Yŏng-ho and later rejected when oﬀered by his mistress from work ﬁfteen years later; Yŏngho’s ﬁrst torture victim defecates on him and stinks his hands with an odor that won’t easily go away, his romanticism forever lost; and ﬁnally a view of the railroad tracks from a moving train is framed in every interlude between segments (the sound of the train whistle is also heard in almost every segment) and signals the omnipresence of modernity and its impending killing of Yŏng-ho. In a ﬁlm that mobilizes each and every thematic impulse through metaphors, there is perhaps no better symbol that best illustrates Yi Ch’ang-dong’s obsession with the trauma and its impossibility of representation than a still camera. Immediately before Yŏng-ho commits suicide, he is summoned by a man who leads him to a hospital. The man had been asked by his dying wife, Sun-im, to ﬁnd Yŏng-ho with whom she had once fell in love. Yŏng-ho and Sun-im had not seen each other for ﬁfteen years, and when he visits her, she has already become unconscious—her life sustained by a respirator. He leaves her bedside with a camera, a gift for him that she kept for over a decade. Yŏng-ho had once told Sun-im that his dream was to photograph nature including ‘‘nameless wildﬂowers.’’ However, the camera is now useless to Yŏng-ho and he exchanges it at a camera store for petty cash. The pawned camera symbolizes not only the permanent loss of Yŏng-ho’s youth even in the form of a nostalgic photograph, but also his male insuﬃciency. The failure of Yŏng-ho to photograph ‘‘nameless wildﬂowers’’ that he so wanted as a young innocent worker recapitulates a motif that is familiar in the ﬁlms of the 1990s. His inability to photograph beauty after becoming irredeemably corrupt and violent reminds us of White Badge’s novelist who cannot continue his novel until Private Pyŏn, a victim of trauma after witnessing a civilian massacre in Vietnam by his Korean comrades, is killed. It is not only the beauty of the world the camera could capture that frightens Yŏng-ho, but also the camera’s power of representation that he cannot accept; they impede his growth as a coherent subject. Intimately tied to the process of representation is the discourse of the ‘‘other’’ing of an object that can help to constitute the self. After suﬀering from trauma associated with a wounded leg and accidentally shooting an innocent civilian (permanently injuring both the body and the psyche), he is incapable of entering the realm of the Symbolic through representational-linguistic faculties. To be in control of a camera, an instrument that captures and reproduces something desired, means becoming a subject through the very praxis of mimetic objectiﬁcation. The very thought of image reproduction, however, is categorically unappealing and resisted by the 24\n\nRather than facing humiliation, Yŏng-ho decides to die on the railroad tracks. Peppermint Candy (1999).\n\nimpaired Yŏng-ho, who is increasingly becoming afraid of his own ‘‘ugly’’ reﬂection and his putative phallic lack projected in the mirror. I argue in this book, though Whale Hunting (1984) and Peppermint Candy (1999) represent two diﬀerent periods of Korean ﬁlm history (one before the new cinema movement and the other afterward) and two diﬀerent styles of ﬁlmmaking (one commercial and the other art) the characters, Pyŏng-t’ae and Yŏng-ho, are almost identical in their astute refusal to confront and reconcile their mirrored selves, at the expense of even preferring death. The projection of melancholia, which laments and fetishizes the lost object that is stained with impurity, insists that there once was a hope for the pure, the good, and the beautiful to sublimely emerge in a subject. The nostalgic evocation of Yŏng-ho’s romanticized youth before he is enlisted by the army does not ambivalently obfuscate the boundaries between good and evil, between real and ﬁction, but instead aﬃrms them. What can then be problematized is not just the fact that the violence and the impurity, which is clearly demarcated from the good and the beautiful, can be abominated, but also that, by so doing, the hope that the pure, splendid form of beauty lying somehow, somewhere, is rekindled. This hope treads dangerously toward an essentialist position that is even more abhorrent than the idea that ‘‘life can be ugly.’’ The ﬁlm literally asks through Yŏng-ho several times whether or not a ‘‘life can be beautiful.’’ Introduction: Hunting for the Whale 25\n\nBeneath this lamentation and melancholia lies the blame on the ‘‘ugliness’’ of life that has robbed him of his youth and his romantic ideals, but also a consideration that the phallic lack, the castrated condition that Yŏng-ho has been bound to, is only putatively real. The fall of Yŏng-ho is surely exacerbated by the historical catastrophes, such as Kwangju, the military dictatorship, and the so-called ‘‘I.M.F.-crisis’’ of 1997, but the culprit is also his perceived sense of the lack that is persistently threatening unless its ﬁctiveness is unveiled. Life may not be beautiful, and the belief that a beautiful and splendid subjectivity—free from trauma—can be recuperated is only capable of projecting and lamenting beauty and its loss rather than intimately embracing it. Even though Peppermint Candy re-authors the traumas to mourn the pain that ran askew to the one oﬃcially sanctioned by the state,48 it hardly ferments a vision of postnational imaginary or a nonmasculine universe. What is absent still in a ﬁlm made almost twenty years after Whale Hunting is a female plot, never mind a feminist one. The foreclosure of female agency prematurely ratiﬁes after all that the ﬁlm’s female roles are again relegated to the familiar, contingent, and overlapped inscriptions of mothers and whores. The sense of melancholia that sentimentalizes the loss and heals the pain renders a determined purpose to embrace the lack—not in the feminist sense of the ‘‘abject’’— but to oﬀer a masculine lamentation of its castration anxiety. The death then prompted at the end of the narrative by Yŏng-ho, a brutal soldier in Kwangju, a violent secret agent, and an adulterous husband, who hustles from one crisis to another and loops himself in a chain of crisis, converts the psychic loss and unspeakable horror into a sense of renewal. But this renewal is possible, the ﬁlm claims, only through self-destruction. The suicide of Yŏng-ho, where he stands on the railroad track to meet the oncoming train at full speed and yells, ‘‘I want to go back!’’ is haunting. This is an image that is as compelling and desperate as the image that began this chapter and featured the naked Pyŏng-t’ae standing ignominiously onstage, but it is also equally contrived and problematic because Peppermint Candy reveals the narcissistic and obsessive tendencies of the male that laments only his loss and failure though the man has enjoyed a privileged representation so far. Turning back the clock is only possible in the fantastic realm of the movies, where Peppermint Candy ends with the young Yŏng-ho holding a ﬂower in his hand and wondering about the origin of his ‘‘déjà-vu’’ at the river by the railroad track, the very spot where he will die twenty years later. But the Korean cinema’s misogynistic hope of recovering a wholesome maleness and purity from a fantasy, as if it can be transposed to be absolutely real, is, in the ﬁnal analysis, impossible.\n\n26\n\nI Genres of Post-Trauma\n\nC\n\nhapters 1 through 4 trace the social and psychic origins of ﬁlms that deal with historical trauma and post-traumatic recoveries. This section oﬀers textual readings of the select works that best express the transmutations of historical genres that engage this process of recuperation. Not only are these works representative of Korean cinema’s foray into art-house ﬁlm festivals during the last two decades of the twentieth century, but they are also ﬁlms that have stimulated local commercial interest. Again, the objective, by way of closely examining the categories of urban dramas, road movies, war ﬁlms, and ﬁnally ﬁlms of social concerns, is to invoke how even in these representative ﬁlms of the New Korean Cinema, the narrativization of the society’s transformation hinges on the narcissistic recasting of masculine ﬁgures. In these ﬁlms, male sexual desires brush up against historical and social issues that place men in diﬃcult positions. In all of the ﬁlm categories explored in this section, there is a sight of horror that invokes the traumatic losses of pastoral communities (urban dramas), homes (road movie), faithful wives and asexual mothers (Korean War ﬁlms), and memory and sanity (social problem ﬁlms). Men are constantly threatened by the state, by the law, and by the erasure of their origin. Amalgamated, these stories of disﬁguration and even self-immolation (in the case of Chŏn T’ae-il in A Single Spark) consistently produce ineﬃcacious conditions in which the central protagonists are robbed of their manhood. The post-traumatic recoveries will only be complete once their emasculations are properly reconciled. The post-traumatic narrative or recovery is intricately tied to the genre conventions of melodrama. All of the ﬁlms discussed in this section lament the\n\ndisintegration of the family. Through this loss, which palpably desires some form of reunion at the end of each narrative, the ﬁlms demonstrate their inability to depart completely from the conventions of genre. ‘‘The genre ﬁlm is a structure,’’ as Thomas Sobchack remarked, ‘‘that is opposed to experimentation, novelty, or tampering with the given order of things.’’ 1 The New Korean Cinema, while increasingly edgy about traditional forms, values, and themes, also attests to the diﬃculty of departing from the restrictions of genre altogether in an industry that had no vital government support. Korean ﬁlmmakers had to aim for the creation of art cinema without the aid of public subsidy. The New Korean Cinema was born not because of but in spite of the role of the government, which had blacklisted and censored many of the featured ﬁlmmakers such as Park Kwang-su and Jang Sun-woo. All of the ﬁlms discussed in this book are works that had virtually no ﬁnancial contribution from sources other than for-proﬁt businesses. Although the Korean government since 1999 has provided subsidies that have led to art ﬁlm production grants, this is only a recent change. The New Korean Cinema had to strictly play within the commercial rules of an open marketplace (which meant competing with Hollywood ﬁlms distributed freely across the nation) and could not completely abandon the conventions of popular ﬁlmmaking. Either with great subtlety or irony, the ﬁlms had to negotiate with the codes of genre, heightening the tensions and catharsis of familial fragmentation, loss of homes, and alienation of individual subjects. But while the hope for reclamation of home and recovery of individual persisted in these stories, the endings desperately fell short of reunions, love, and overcoming life’s obstacles. The New Korean Cinema engineered a master narrative that engages with trauma—a narrative trajectory where the protagonist is left with a wound so inerasable that even the spectacular and animated endings of melodrama cannot fully recuperate him from his emotional wreckage. The strong impulse to reclaim home—fragmented because of the violence produced by national history—did not disengage the hegemonic, masculine tradition. The colonial and military occupation by Japan and the United States throughout the twentieth century weakened and besieged both Korean men and women, but, while women are largely left outside the scope of the thematic concerns of ﬁlms, male trauma emerges as the centerpiece that drives the narratives. The primary motif in all of the ten ﬁlms highlighted in this section, even in ﬁlms where the stories pivot on the lives of women (Sopyonje, Silver Stallion, and A Petal ), is the frail male whose lack and disenfranchisement must remain as the central concern for both the narratives and the female protagonists. The\n\n28\n\nrecovery of the self remains as the objective in these ﬁlms, but, as argued in each of the chapters, the subjectivity reconstituted or denied in the end is the man’s alone. The birth of a ‘‘new’’ Korean cinema is stretched over two decades. While some of the most signiﬁcant ﬁlms were produced from the late 1980s to the early 1990s, the productivity of ﬁlms with social relevance—despite its decline—continued well into the 1990s. Also, the primary thematic tensions of the New Korean Cinema between masculine agencies and social problems (of class contradiction, rapid urbanization, and military rules) of the postmilitary era could be found in ﬁlms as early as A Fine, Windy Day, which was produced in the spring of 1980, the brief period before the military government resumed its authoritarian rule. While the direct critique of the government through realistic portrayals of the working class in insuﬀerable conditions was categorically censored in feature ﬁlms during the 1980s, the masochistic men pictured through the characters Tŏk-pae (A Fine, Windy Day) and Pyŏng-t’ae (Whale Hunting) provided an unconscious sense of urgency through their inability to articulate and their ineﬀectuality that metaphorically was symptomatic of the terror and trauma ushered by the military regimes. These sardonic characters continued to serve as an anchor for all of the major characters in the ﬁrst ﬁlms made by the directors representative of the New Korean Cinema (Park Kwang-su, Jang Sunwoo, and Yi Myŏng-se). It is hardly coincidental that Park Kwang-su’s Chilsu and Mansu (1988), Jang Sun-woo’s Age of Success (1988), and Yi Myŏng-se’s Gagman (1988) all share comic impulses that bind characters who are socially alienated (An Sŏng-gi humorously plays the main characters in all three ﬁlms). These ﬁlms—which are now historically signiﬁcant for signaling Korea’s ‘‘new’’ cinema—did not completely break away from the characterization of men previously inscribed as frail and anxious, but instead extended it to parlay aesthetics and themes that were more resonant with the frustrations of the then-young audiences. What is astounding in this cross section of the ﬁlms discussed in this volume is that the various forms and transgressions of masculinity canvass a wideranging spectrum of men. The projected masculinities are hardly stable as they shift between sadism and masochism, between rationality and insanity, and between morality and unspeakable sin. Focusing on cultivating post-traumatic identities that pivot from masculine sensibilities and perspectives, however, clearly leaves behind attention to women. The New Korean Cinema—in plotting its reﬁguration of a cinema previously disﬁgured by state and in following a navigation through Korea’s treacherous and conﬂicting entry into the\n\nGenres of Post-Trauma 29\n\npostmilitary, modern, global era—reconciled with subjects that could potentially legitimate misogyny. This violence ultimately stemmed not only from male narcissism and self-loathing, but also from the neglect of women. In this case, obsessive narcissism of the 1980s already underscores the foundation that lays the basis for sadism, something that becomes more pronounced as Korean cinema becomes more modern, global, and commercially viable.\n\n30\n\n1 At the Edge of a Metropolis in A Fine, Windy Day and Green Fish\n\nW\n\nhen the camera cuts to an aerial view of the protagonist Mak-tong’s house in Green Fish (Ch’orok mulgogi, Yi Ch’ang-dong, dir., 1997), the satellite city of Ilsan comes into full view in the background. Mak-tong’s underdeveloped house remains in the foreground as a reminder of the past, in sharp contrast with the countless, slender high-rise apartment buildings that ﬁll the modern skyline of Ilsan. The ceramic kimchi jars, the tin slates that unevenly layer the tiled roof, a dusty tractor, a vinyl vegetable house in the yard, an outdoor toilet, and a huge willow tree standing next to an electric pole all render a stalled time that has not kept pace with the rest. The concrete house is the kind commonly seen in the farming villages during the intense industrialization drive of the Park Chung Hee era (1961–79). The rickety blue rooﬁng tiles, instead of the thatched hays, display a marker of postwar rural development that was hurried and now threatened with extinction as the metropolis expands itself into the countryside in the 1990s. Like the concrete waste that sits idly against the wall of Mak-tong’s house, this home is an unneeded appendix to the new city of Ilsan. It will soon be remodeled into a restaurant, catering to the urbanites who will occasionally use it as a rest area along the unpaved road that runs parallel to the house. At the edge of a metropolis stands the house in Green Fish, threatened with disappearance and lurking violence. The reﬁguration of the urban space reconstitutes the familial relations that in turn destabilize the premodern values and ethics. Modernity not only impacts the integrity of a family but also threatens its patriarchal order. The frail men\n\nA housewife has her moral virtues questioned. The caption in the poster asks, ‘‘If you were the professor, how would you deal with your wife who has made a mistake?’’ Madame Freedom (1955).\n\npictured in these postwar ‘‘urban drama’’ ﬁlms employ the narrative pattern that reinscribes a very speciﬁc discourse of remasculinization. There are two issues at disposal when the ‘‘urban drama’’ of the 1980s and the 1990s is considered. First, what had fallen out of the public’s favor already by the 1980s was the genre of family melodrama that for decades had dominated the box oﬃce during the Golden Age of Korean Cinema (from the mid-1950s to the early 1970s). Women’s ‘‘weepies,’’ which centrally frame a tragic heroine who is betrayed by men, were no longer popular with audiences. Some of the most memorable protagonists of the Golden Age were women. Han Hyŏng-mo’s Madame Freedom (Chayu puin, 1956), Shin Sang-ok’s Flower of Hell (Chiokhwa, 1958), Kim Ki-yŏng’s The Housemaid (Hanyŏ, 1960), and Chŏng So-yŏng’s Bitter, but Once Again (Miwŏdo tasihanbŏn, 1968) all centrally framed the dilemma of a woman through whom the changing moral landscape between modern and traditional values was depicted. The choice between a good woman and a desire-driven vamp posited the two radically splitting versions of femininity in Korea. The woman’s failure to remain virtuous therefore directly elicited images of a crying child who is hungry and uncared for (Madame Freedom), a brother who decides to rob a bank to stop his sister from soliciting her clients in the street (A Stray Bullet), and a father who suﬀers a psychological breakdown after developing an illicit relationship with his housemaid (The Housemaid ). The domestic melodrama was the genre that swept the box oﬃce during the 1960s. In the 1980s, however, as movie-going audiences dwindled,1 the conventions of melodrama became stale and hackneyed even for an audience that had long tolerated formulaic stories. Second, the role of men was given much more weight in these contempo-\n\n32\n\nrary, urban dramas than in those of the Golden Age. In the classic ﬁlms, the featured heroines fell into traps either of their own misguided trust in men or of the luring circumstances of a pleasurable, consumerist society. The stories centered on femme fatales who cannot repress their consumerist desire and/or on victimized women who are injured by patriarchal discourses. Somewhere between the image of women in glittery polka-dot dresses dancing to a jazz rhythm in the U.S. military camps and that of chaste motherhood prescribed by the dominant social mores ﬂoundered the postwar female identity. They were forced to splinter into the paths of either yanggongju (military prostitutes) or virtuous mothers.2 The ﬁlms of the 1980s and the 1990s did very little to divert the characterization of women from these stereotypical roles, despite the intense modernization that made Seoul one of the major centers of global business. As the debacle of domestic melodramas continued in the 1980s, it was the men whose stories demanded attention more than the women’s. The recuperation of masculinity in these urban ﬁlms hinges not on the concealment of male lack through fetishized bodies and excessive virility, but through its exposure. The fermentation of masculine identity is historically precipitated by the dramatically changing urban landscape where territorial control is being violently contested. Violence necessarily engenders trauma when the ownership of land changes hands overnight, when proud farmers become migrant workers in the urban service sector, and when families suﬀer internal fragmentations. The ‘‘dominant ﬁction,’’ as described by Kaja Silverman, seeks to neutralize the shock of trauma by channeling the individual experience of disruption and disorientation into a collectivized sense of fraternal identity. Silverman, through her analysis of Hollywood ﬁlms that were released just after World War II, such as The Best Years of Our Lives (William Wyler, dir., 1946) and It’s a Wonderful Life (Frank Capra, dir., 1946), enumerates how the male protagonists in these ﬁlms strive to normalize the paternal function that had previously failed. She attributes this particular crisis of male subjectivity to the ‘‘cataclysmic events of the 1940s,’’ 3 and explores the narrative pattern that seeks to reaﬃrm the communal support to reintegrate the male subject back into the ‘‘dominant ﬁction.’’ Likewise, in the Korean cinema the community symbolically functions to supplant the vanishing family and disavow the male protagonists’ ‘‘lack’’ as they reestablish their social identities as workers, friends, or cells in gangster organizations. The external danger, in the midst of rapid changes, is at least temporarily subdued. Instead an ego that must compensate for the psychic injury or the phallic lack ﬂares up. However, what is interesting in Korean ﬁlms is that even after correctly identifying the origin of their troubles, male\n\nGenres of Post-Trauma 33\n\ncharacters are unable to fully acquire an authorial, post-traumatic subjectivity. In other words, they must learn to live with their ‘‘lack.’’ Miserable conditions impose limitations on their dreams, even in cinema, a medium that cannot authenticate reality despite its tireless tries through realism. The two protagonists in the ﬁlms featured in this chapter, Tŏk-pae in A Fine, Windy Day (Param purŏ choŭn nal, Yi Chang-ho, dir., 1980) and Mak-tong in Green Fish, exhibit masculinity that is scarred. As argued in the introduction, it is not unusual in Korean ﬁlms for a man to register his lack, insuﬃciency, and incompleteness, whereas the women represent the general condition of wholeness and knowledge, albeit one contingent upon the pursuit of masculine recuperation. The men are aﬀable and trustworthy, but their lack of ﬁnancial autonomy, romantic experience, and physical capability far outweigh their strengths. They are poor, awkward with women, and constantly scarred after brawls. What distinguishes these characters from heroes commonly pictured in Hollywood ﬁlms is that their male lack is not ﬁgured as an unnatural state that must be disavowed through various modes, but as a naturalized symptom of masculinity generated from modernity’s violence, which is far and beyond the powers of any individual. The city cannot separate itself from violence that forces these characters to become masochistic heroes who must endure pain. The ﬁlms use visual and aural metaphors to prominently highlight their lack. In Green Fish, the cast that protects the broken ﬁngers of Mak-tong never comes oﬀ his hand, and in A Fine, Windy Day, Tŏk-pae suﬀers from a verbal stammer. This is the salient point that must be visually framed to reweave them into the community. From the early 1980s, a period of intense economic growth, late stage urbanization, and political terror, to the late 1990s, one of economic recession, deindustrialization, and postdictatorship, the male position shifts from a passive agent (Tŏk-pae) to an active one (Mak-tong), but each man’s lack is still specular for the purposes of insisting on the need for fraternal, communal, and masculine values/ethics to which the society must conform.\n\nA Fine, Windy Day A Fine, Windy Day marked the return of director Yi Chang-ho from an early ‘‘retirement.’’ Yi was banned from making ﬁlms from 1976 to 1979, and A Fine, Windy Day resumed his career after a four-year hiatus.4 Yi retained his celebrity status, and A Fine, Windy Day stirred popular interest. It ranked third at the box oﬃce among the Korean ﬁlms released in 1980. And it was re-released in theaters, in 1988, when the fervor for democracy again hit the streets.5 Not only\n\n34\n\nwas A Fine, Windy Day popular with audiences, but it was also a smash with critics. It won several domestic awards and was later voted the best Korean ﬁlm of the 1980s by the local critics.6 The creative rights of the director Yi Chang-ho were restored on December 3, 1979,7 and the screenplay cleared the censorship board in early 1980. The ﬁlm was quickly granted a production permit and was released during the summer of 1980, which allowed it to take full advantage of the brief ‘‘spring of democracy’’ in 1980. This optimistic period was made possible when Park Chung Hee was shot to death on October 26, 1979. The reign of terror imposed by the military rule was suspended until the Kwangju Uprising on May 18, 1980, when the civilian demonstrations for democracy were violently quelled by Chun Doo Hwan and his military cronies, who were unoﬃcially in power at the time.8 (Chun did not oﬃcially become president until September 1, 1980.) The ﬁlm, having been conceived and shot in the early part of 1980—just around Kwangju and before the indictment of the dissident leader Kim Dae Jung and the resignation of the acting president Ch’oe Kyu-ha on August 16, 1980—fully capitalized on the brief interregnum before the military rule resumed in Korea. After enduring a long period of embarrassment that produced a barrage of unpopular quota quickies and government propaganda, the Korean ﬁlm industry prepared itself for a brighter future in 1980, a future in which creative freedom would be restored. Conﬁdent that democracy would be restored, the ﬁlm producers’ association on January 25, 1980 boldly asked the government to modify its censorship laws by abolishing the preproduction review of movie scripts.9 (It would actually take more than ﬁfteen years before the court ruled this practice of censorship unconstitutional.) Both hope and the impending anxiety over the future of democracy underscore the making of A Fine, Windy Day. Had it been submitted to the censors only a few months later, it would not have been theatrically released. A Fine, Windy Day features three male protagonists: Tŏk-pae, Ch’un-sik, and Kil-nam. Tŏk-pae is a delivery boy for a small Chinese restaurant, Ch’un-sik an assistant in a barbershop, and Kil-nam an errand boy in a decrepit love motel. If their line of work is any indication, they hardly occupy what is considered to be the digniﬁed roles in Korea’s economic development. It is a cold and harsh world that is depicted in A Fine, Windy Day, a world in which love and friendship are tested and betrayed. Capitalism and modernity are characterized by sterile bourgeois houses and inhumane businesses, which are hostile to the bucolic and fetid characteristics that best proﬁle the three friends, migrant workers from the countryside.\n\nGenres of Post-Trauma 35\n\nKim Chong-bae (left), a loan shark, tries to seduce Miss Yu. A Fine, Windy Day (1980).\n\nThe ﬁlm exploits melodramatic conventions to tell the stories of three friends who separately pursue their dreams and romantic interests. Ch’un-sik admires Miss Yu, a young and ambitious woman working as a masseuse in the same barbershop where he works. Complicating the possibility of their romantic union is Kim Chong-bae, the head of a local real estate company and a loan shark, who has reaped beneﬁts from the rapid development of this section of the city. Kim, though married, fancies Miss Yu and coerces her to sleep with him for the money she needs for her father’s hospital fee. Kil-nam, a motel employee, refers call girls for his guests. But the money accumulated through his ‘‘side-job’’ is instantaneously lost when his girlfriend, whom he most trusts, elopes with it in tow. These subplots of betrayal, fraud, and exploitation, common in urban areas where individuals face destitution and minimal healthcare and pension, necessitate the strengthening of friendship and kinship even more. Threatening the male bondage between three urban squatters is the intervention of a beautiful young woman, Myŏng-hŭi, hailing from the aﬄuent section of the district.
