        "text": "It may be a whole new world for Aladdin, but it turned out to be another lucrative opening weekend for Disney.\n\nThe live-action feature grossed $112.7 million stateside over the Memorial Day weekend, beating out even high-end estimates that the film would bow to $100 million.\n\nThe Guy Ritchie-directed Aladdin stars Will Smith as the Genie and Mena Massoud as the titular hero, a charming street rat who masquerades as a prince to win the affections of Princess Jasmine, played by Naomi Scott. The movie musical, produced by Dan Lin and Jonathan Eirich's Rideback, opened wide in 4,400 locations.\n\nThe rehashing of the studio's 1992 animated pic has received a mixed response from critics, with a 57 percent fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, but has fared far better with audiences, earning an A CinemaScore. Aladdin’s audience skewed male, with a 60/40 split, with 51 percent under age 25.\n\nAladdin is a return to form for Disney's lucrative live-action adaptations of its classic animations after Tim Burton's Dumbo had a disappointing opening weekend of $45.9 million at the North American box office earlier this year.\n\nIn its opening weekend, Aladdin earned more than Jon Favreau's The Jungle Book, which pulled in $103.2 million in its 2016 debut, but came in behind the Emma Watson-starring Beauty and the Beast, which collected $174.7 million when it premiered in 2017. (Jungle Book and Beauty and the Beast did not have the added benefit of a holiday weekend opening.)\n\nInternationally, Aladdin picked up an estimated $121 million for the three-day weekend, across 54 territories. China led the way with $18.7 million in ticket sales, followed by Mexico ($9.2 million) and the U.K. ($8.4 million).\n\nAlso hitting theaters over the frame was Olivia Wilde’s R-rated high school comedy Booksmart. Opening wide at 2,505 locations, the Annapurna comedy faced heavy competition from Aladdin and earned a solid but not substantial $8.7 million in its holiday bow.\n\nBeanie Feldstein and Kaitlyn Dever star in the pic as two Ivy League-bound overachievers determined to party on the night before their graduation. Booksmart was produced by Megan Ellison, Chelsea Barnard, David Distenfeld, Jessica Elbaum and writer Katie Silberman.\n\nBooksmart premiered at SXSW to universal praise, and currently sits at an incredible 99 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. But audiences did not respond as favorably, giving it a B+ CinemaScore. The comedy, which played best on the West Coast, had a largely female audience (61 percent), with a massive 74 percent of the audience falling between the ages of 18 and 34.\n\nMeanwhile, Screen Gems and The H Collective's superhero horror film Brightburn posted a three-day gross of $9.5 million at 2,257 locations.\n\nThe movie was directed by David Yarovesky from a script by Brian Gunn and Mark Gunn and counts James Gunn as a producer. A riff on the Superman origin story, Brightburn, toplined by Elizabeth Banks, centers on a couple in Kansas who find an alien baby and raise him, only to see him turn evil.\n\nThe film received a lukewarm response from critics, with a 64 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. Audiences gave it a C+ CinemaScore, but a lower rating is not uncommon for horror-tinged films. Seventy-four percent of Brightburn's audience, which was largely male (62 percent), was under 35 years old.\n\nOverall, Memorial Day weekend at the stateside box office was flat, according to numbers from ComScore, coming in below the $227.7 million worth of domestic ticket sales in 2018, when Star Wars spinoff Solo opened to a disappointing $103 million over the four-day weekend (the worst-ever opening weekend for a Star Wars film).\n\nThe 2019 Memorial Day weekend box office, which will have an estimated $226 million in stateside sales, was bolstered by holdovers like John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum ($30 million), Avengers: Endgame ($22 million) and Detective Pikachu ($17.3 million).\n\nA star-studded Cannes Film Festival came to a close Saturday night with a bang as Bong Joon-ho's Parasite took home the Palme d'Or, while Mati Diop's Atlantics landed the runner-up Grand Prix award.\n\nThe Parasite win denied Once Upon a Time in Hollywood director Quentin Tarantino his second top Cannes prize of his career (the helmer won the Palme d’Or 25 years ago for his groundbreaking Pulp Fiction) as his widely praised new pic came up empty-handed at the ceremony.\n\nJoon-ho's dark comedy, which premiered the same night as Once Upon a Time, has drawn raves, including at the Cannes closing ceremony, where the audience stood and screamed when it was named the Palme d'Or winner. The film revolves around a man and his unemployed family as they take a peculiar interest in a wealthy family, which leads all of them to become entangled in an unexpected incident. Jury president Alejandro G. Iñárritu said the Palme d'Or decision was \"unanimous.\"\n\nAntonio Banderas won Cannes' best actor award for his starring role in Pain & Glory. In his eighth teaming with director Pedro Almodóvar, Banderas plays a Spanish film director past his professional peak and in the middle of a creative crisis, battling addiction among other physical and mental ailments. The nod bodes well for Banderas’ chances come awards season (Sony Pictures Classics will mount a campaign for the Spanish actor).\n\n\"You have no idea how much I'd love to speak French,\" said Banderas to the roar of the crowd. \"I met Pedro 40 years ago — eight movies together. I respect him, admire him, love him. He's given me so much in my life that this award obviously is dedicated to him. People think we live on a red carpet. But we suffer a lot, sacrifice a lot and there is a lot of pain. And also there are nights of glory. And this is my night of glory.\"\n\nBrothers Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne nabbed best director honors for Young Ahmed, a film about a Belgian teenager embracing Islamic extremism.\n\nBrit Emily Beecham won the best actress award for Little Joe for her turn as Alice, a scientist who creates a genetically modified plant that seemingly causes uncanny changes in other living creatures.\n\nThe Jury Prize wound up in a tie for Ladj Ly's Les Misérables, a drama about life in the French projects, and Kleber Mendonça Filho and Juliano Dornelles' Bacurau, a paranormal Western from Brazil. Earlier in the festival, Amazon nabbed distribution rights to Les Misérables.\n\nCeline Sciamma took home the screenplay prize for Portrait of a Lady on Fire. Sciamma, who also directed the film, crafted a story about a young female painter in the 18th century who disguises herself as a lady's maid in order to gain her subject's trust, only to find herself inadvertently falling in love. U.S. outfit Neon will distribute both Parasite and Portrait of a Lady.\n\nThe awards ceremony drew a who's who of celebrities from the film industry, including Viggo Mortensen, Sylvester Stallone and Vincent Cassel, adding to the glamour quotient for the festival, which also saw the world premieres of such films as the Taron Egerton-led Elton John biopic Rocketman and the opening-night film The Dead Don't Die, with its star-studded ensemble cast including Bill Murray, Adam Driver, Tilda Swinton and Selena Gomez on hand for its bow. But nothing was quite like the red carpet for Once Upon a Time, where Leonardo DiCaprio walked alongside Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie for the film that takes place around the famed Manson murders of 1969.\n\nMichael Moore, whose Fahrenheit 9/11 won the Palme d'Or in 2004, also was in the room when the Palme d'Or was named. Moore, who handed out the Jury Prize, added a political note to the evening when he took to the stage. \"Art is the lie that enables us to realize the truth,\" he said, quoting Pablo Picasso. \"[Donald] Trump is the lie that enables us more lying.\" The director added, \"In dark times, art is what has helped save humanity from the autocrats and idiots, what inspired the masses to not give up, to not despair, to rise up and defeat the insanity with love.\"\n\nWhile the festival has been making strides to include more female filmmakers in its Competition lineup, the Palme d'Or and best director prizes went to men, with the Dardennes picking up the latter. But Diop's win for the night's runner-up prize was significant, given that she also was the first black woman to direct a movie featured in Competition at the festival. With elements of the supernatural, Atlantics kicks off in a suburb of Dakar, Senegal, where workers at a construction site of a futuristic tower, having foregone pay for months, decide to leave the country via the ocean for a better future.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Iñárritu called his post as head of the jury \"an enormous privilege.\" He added, \"We, during the last 10 days, saw 21 films and spent hours not as judges but as film lovers sharing film passionately for hours … incredible, very, very challenging [work] from iconic filmmakers to new voices from all around the world. Only time will judge them clearly.\"\n\nMembers of the Competition jury also included actress Elle Fanning and helmers Yorgos Lanthimos (The Favourite), Kelly Reichardt (Certain Women) and Pawe? Pawlikowski, who won last year's top director prize for Cold War.\n\nThe first prize of the night — the Camera d'Or — went to César Diaz for Our Mothers; the award honors the best first feature film presented in one of Cannes' selections (it screened in the Critics' Week sidebar). Special mention went to Elia Suleiman for It Must Be Heaven, which played in Competition.\n\nBest Screenplay: Celine Sciamma for Portrait of a Lady on Fire\n\nBest Actress: Emily Beecham for Little Joe\n\nBest Actor: Antonio Banderas for Pain & Glory\n\nBest Director: Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne for Young Ahmed\n\nJury Prize: (tie) Ladj Ly's Les Misérables and Kleber Mendonça Filho and Juliano Dornelles' Bacurau\n\nGrand Prix: Atlantics, directed by Mati Diop\n\nPalme d’Or: Parasite, directed by Bong Joon-ho\n\nTwenty-one films screened in Competition. Here is the complete list:\n\nAtlantics, Mati Diop\n\nBacurau, Kleber Mendonça Filho and Juliano Dornelles\n\nThe Dead Don't Die, Jim Jarmusch\n\nFrankie, Ira Sachs\n\nA Hidden Life, Terrence Malick\n\nIt Must Be Heaven, Elia Suleiman\n\nLittle Joe, Jessica Hausner\n\nMatthias & Maxime, Xavier Dolan\n\nLes Misérables, Ladj Ly\n\nMektoub, My Love: Intermezzo, Abdellatif Kechiche\n\nOh Mercy!, Arnaud Desplechin\n\nOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino\n\nPain & Glory, Pedro Almodóvar\n\nParasite, Bong Joon-ho\n\nPortrait of a Lady on Fire, Céline Sciamma\n\nSibyl, Justine Triet\n\nSorry We Missed You, Ken Loach\n\nThe Traitor, Marco Bellocchio\n\nThe Whistlers, Corneliu Porumboiu\n\nThe Wild Goose Lake, Diao Yinan\n\nYoung Ahmed, Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne\n\nNetflix has acquired worldwide rights to the recent Cannes Film Festival Award winners Atlantics and I Lost My Body, the streamer announced Saturday.\n\nMati Diop’s feature directorial debut Atlantics was awarded this year's Grand Prix, while Jeremy Clapin’s animated feature debut I Lost My Body received the top prize in the Critics' Week sidebar, with the film also having been honored with the Nespresso Grand Prize, whose category consisted of seven features and 10 short films.\n\nThe streaming giant's rights to Atlantics exclude China, Benelux, Switzerland, Russian and France. Netflix also has SVOD rights 36 months following theatrical in France, Benelux and Switzerland. Meanwhile, worldwide rights to I Lost My Body exclude China, Benelux, Turkey and France; however, the streamer has SVOD rights 36 months following theatrical in France.\n\nClapin's animated story about a severed hand looking for its home was one of 11 features in competition and was selected by the jury headed by Ciro Guerra, whose Embrace of the Serpent was nominated for a best foreign-language Oscar in 2015. Clapin penned the Xilam Animation-produced film's script with Guillaume Laurant (Amelia, A Very Long Engagement), with Hakim Faris, Victoire Du Bois and Patrick d'Assumcao starring.\n\nDiop's Atlantics tells the story of workers at a construction site of a futuristic tower, having foregone pay for months, who decide to leave the country via the ocean for a better future. Diop wrote the film with Olivier Demangel, with Mama Sane, Amadou Mbow and Ibrahima Traore among the film's cast.\n\nAtlantics' Grand Prix win marked a milestone for Diop, given she was also the first black woman to be accepted into the competition lineup in the festival's 72-year history. \"I discovered it myself, reading the article,\" Diop told The Hollywood Reporter of the moment she learned of her inclusion. \"It was a rather odd experience for me because I approached it almost as somebody learning this, as an outsider. What I represent exceeds me and does not belong to me.\"\n\nDiop was also one of only four female directors in this year's 21-film lineup, which marked a slight improvement after the festival came under fire for its lack of distaff representation.\n\nThe Atlantics deal was negotiated by Fionnuala Jamison for mk2 films on behalf of the filmmakers. I Lost My Body was negotiated by Carole Baraton for Charades on behalf of the filmmakers.\n\nMay 26, 9:25 a.m. Updated with the names of those who negotiated the deals for Atlantics and I Lost My Body.\n\nYou could pick up a subtle sense of shifting sands in Cannes within the fest’s first day or two. The streets and restaurants were not as crowded, the billboards not as ostentatious, the yachts less evident, the inebriated late-night revelers less rambunctious. And while a substantial array of international films was once again on display along the Croisette, the question of who would be seeing these movies after the fest — and, perhaps more important, where and how — hung in the air.\n\nWhile the whole nature of the industry has been changing radically the past few years, the flow of what we call, for lack of a better term, \"art cinema” or \"film festival fare,\" has continued apace. Cannes filled its 21 competition slots with a solid selection of the usual suspects — Tarantino, Almodóvar, Loach, the Dardennes and others — along with newcomers to the main slate, most notably Céline Sciamma with her precision study of a female love affair in 18th century France, Portrait of a Lady on Fire, surely the most widely acclaimed film this year. Add in other worthy titles from France, Romania, Brazil, China, Russia and the U.S. and — with three or four mediocre exceptions — you had quite a respectable lineup, one that felt very much like a traditional Cannes.\n\nBut aside from Quentin Tarantino’s blissful? Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, which opens in July; Terrence Malick’s considerably less sublime A Hidden Life, which Fox Searchlight acquired here for big money; and Jim Jarmusch’s fitfully amusing vampire comedy, The Dead Don’t Die, which will come and go in June, how many top Cannes titles will be seen to any significant extent in American theaters? How widely can the work of exciting international auteurs, many of whom this festival has launched, be viewed on the big screen anymore? How do the serious movies Cannes promotes fit into the lives and agendas of busy people who have so many choices of where and when to watch something?\n\nIn short, whither art cinema? That thought has buzzed in my mind for two weeks as I pondered the relevance of the films I was watching to any kind of broader audience. Said relevance may not be any reflection of the quality of a piece of art, but it is certainly integral to its ultimate impact.\n\nFrench director Ladj Ly’s powerful debut, Les Misérables, a police drama set in a volatile Paris suburb inhabited mostly by residents of African and Arab origin, presents themes and situations that anyone in any country can understand, no matter the language. It deserves to be seen beyond France.\n\nAnother tale of violence, Kleber Mendonça Filho and Juliano Dornelles' Bacurau, also feels at least somewhat universal. Centering on people who sequester themselves with their guns in a remote patch of Brazil, the pic, while not always artful, strikes a powerful note at a moment when many nations appear to be coming apart at the seams.\n\nMeanwhile, a much mellower movie, Almodóvar’s autobiographical Pain and Glory, will certainly be seen around the world thanks to the international reputation of its director as well as its stars, Antonio Banderas and Penélope Cruz. I found the film lovely in many ways, but Almodóvar’s Proustian specificity about the things that have been important to him somewhat hindered my connecting with his story, leaving me only half moved.\n\nBut there were a few examples of the?festival’s loyalty to certain directors proving ill-advised. Mektoub, My Love: Intermezzo, a three-hour-plus indulgence in night-clubbing and sex from Abdellatif Kechiche (who won the 2013 Palme d’Or with Blue Is the Warmest Color), caused many jaws to drop, and not in a good way. Italian Marco Bellocchio’s lengthy Mafia drama The Traitor plays like an old-fashioned television show. And a few titles from respected directors new to the main Cannes lineup — including Jessica Hausner’s thriller Little Joe and Ira Sachs’ Isabelle Huppert vehicle Frankie — just weren’t of competition caliber. The legacy of auteurism remains very strong at Cannes, for better and sometimes for worse.\n\nAs for Tarantino’s mature, richly human ode to late 1960s Hollywood, starring a superbly matched Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt, I was transported and elated. (Full disclosure: ?My son was a production assistant on the shoot.) While some have criticized it for an over-relaxed attitude toward storytelling, I see it as a daring exercise in seeing how far you can go with digressions; the way Tarantino drives his narrative without staying on the straight-and-narrow is exciting, even breathtaking.\n\nThe other hot American ticket was in the Directors’ Fortnight side section: Robert Eggers' The Lighthouse, a two-hander about 19th century Maine lighthouse keepers going mad. Eggers is ostentatiously talented and stars Willem Dafoe and Robert Pattinson go toe-to-toe in an exhilarating way. But then it all becomes too much, with Eggers trying to top himself a few too many times. Like his 2015 debut, The Witch, it’s good, but not that good.\n\nPerhaps the most unexpected delight was a wonderful French film that played out of competition. Nicolas Bedos' La Belle Époque, about a man (Daniel Auteuil) who gets to literally revisit his past, is as quick-witted a farce as I’ve seen on the big screen in ages. It’s the rare Gallic comedy with real potential for popularity abroad — and a sign that Cannes, even if a bit diminished, still reigns as the year’s premier film festival.\n\nThis story first appears in the May 29 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

We disagree. CBS News has been working hard to advocate for an inclusive, safe and dignified workplace for everyone at CBS News, and Scott has been a supporter of these efforts.\"\n\nPelley signed off from the CBS Evening News in June 2017 after being pushed out the month before following months of rumors. His departure from the role came months before a wave of sexual misconduct allegations rocked Hollywood and the media industry.\n\nAt the time of his departure, Pelley's exit was seen as tied to the broadcast remaining in third place in the ratings, as it had for decades, and as a way to fill up 60 Minutes' thin correspondent corps ahead of the venerable news magazine's 50th season, following the untimely death of Bob Simon in early 2015 in a car accident. Doing as many as 20 pieces a season for 60 Minutes while hosting the nightly newscast left Pelley stretched rather thin, THR noted at the time.\n\nStill the departure was not a smooth exit, as the news broke when the New York Post's \"Page Six\" reported that Pelley's office was being cleaned out while he was away on assignment, something that CBS News sources later stressed was at his request.\n\nPelley segued into a full-time position at 60 Minutes and was ultimately replaced at the Evening News by Jeff Glor and then Norah O'Donnell.\n\nIt's unclear whether Pelley's \"hostile work environment\" comments pertain to allegations of sexual misconduct, but numerous claims of inappropriate behavior at CBS News have emerged over the past 18 months, beginning with accusations against former CBS This Morning host Charlie Rose, which came to light in November 2017 and quickly led to Rose being fired from the CBS morning show.\n\nCBS News found itself under additional scrutiny as a Washington Post investigation published in May 2018 revealed there were more alleged incidents of sexual misconduct by Rose than previously reported and managers were warned about his conduct toward women at the network on three occasions over a period of 30 years, as early as 1986 and as recently as April 2017, according to people with firsthand knowledge of the conversations.\n\nAnd, as more allegations of inappropriate conduct at CBS News emerged, 60 Minutes executive producer Jeff Fager exited the network last September after sending a \"harsh\" text to network reporter Jericka Duncan as she investigated allegations against him.\n\nThere were also numerous investigations into conduct at CBS and in its news division.\n\nMay 26, 9:00 p.m. Updated with CBS News' statement about Pelley's remarks.\n\nWhiskey Cavalier won't be coming back from the dead after all.\n\nCreator David Hemingson tweeted Friday that the show is \"fully and finally canceled\" after talks between ABC and producer Warner Bros. proved fruitless.\n\n\"I just got sad news that [ABC] has passed. Whiskey Cavalier has been fully and finally canceled,\" Hemingson wrote on Twitter. \"Thank you all so, so much for your efforts on our behalf. I cannot begin to express my gratitude for the outpouring of support. It’s incredibly painful to say goodbye to this show and our extraordinary cast, but knowing that we made something you enjoyed — and that I believe will stand the test of time — makes it all worthwhile.\"\n\nABC canceled the spy drama starring Scott Foley and Lauren Cohan on May 10, with network head Karey Burke calling the decision one of the tougher ones she had to make going into her first upfront as president of ABC Entertainment. \"We thought we gave it a very strong launch [out of the Oscars] this spring, but we lost audience,\" she told reporters on her upfront press call. \"We looked for other time slots but did not see a real opportunity.\"\n\nWhiskey Cavalier began with a similar ratings profile to that of fellow ABC freshman The Rookie, although it faded some after an initially solid start. With an improved lead-in Wednesday night following the Live in Front of a Studio Audience: Norman Lear's All in the Family and The Jeffersons special, Whiskey Cavalier posted its best numbers in more than two months with a 0.7 rating among adults 18-49 and 3.64 million viewers.\n\nFollowing the cancellation, however, ABC apparently had second thoughts, with the network discussing a possible second season with producer Warner Bros. TV. ABC has picked up only six new scripted series for the 2019-20 season, potentially leaving some openings for the back half of the season. Still, a Whiskey Cavalier reversal would have come as a big surprise, as it is rare to see the same network reverse its decision within a week. ABC also has a couple of pilots still in contention for midseason, including an NYPD Blue sequel and Heart of Life, based on the John Mayer song.\n\nDaniel Wright, a former season seven and eight contestant on NBC's The Biggest Loser, died Sunday of leukemia. He was 30.\n\nAfter the news was confirmed by fellow contestants on social media, tributes came pouring in via Wright's GoFundMe page, where it indicated that he was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in October 2017. His supporters were aiming to raise $50,000 for medical costs.\n\nOn Facebook, Wright's fellow castmate Courtney Crozier Respess wrote, \"I am so so heartbroken to hear about Daniel Wright this morning. He has fought SO HARD during his battle with cancer & more. This man is one of the kindest people I have ever met & is a true difference maker in this world! His faith has never faded, even in the darkest of times. I am honored to have known him!!!\"\n\nIn the last few days before Wright's death, his wife Rebecca made several updates about his condition via Facebook, citing his struggles with blood clots, coughing up blood, a persistent fever and infections.\n\nRespess referred to Wright's wife in her message, writing, \"Please keep him & his beautiful, amazing, and beyond strong wife Rebecca Wright in your prayers today as he is being called to heaven. Rebecca will need all of us to lift her up now & for the months & years to come.\"\n\nThe Biggest Loser's season eight winner Danny Cahill also shared a tribute to his friend. \"Yesterday the world lost a bit of its light,\" he wrote on Facebook. \"Daniel Wright and I met for the first time in May of 2009 on the beach in Malibu. 15 of us went to the beach that morning to begin our journey on season 8 of The Biggest Loser. Our 16th contestant was driven up to the starting position of that first 1-mile race (which he won) and out popped Daniel. 'Hey guys!!!' He yelled as he jogged over to us. Little did I know the effect this man would have on my life.\"\n\nCahill went on to say that Wright \"never missed a chance to double back and encourage every soul in the fight of their lives to keep going, and ensure us we would make it.\"\n\nReturning to home turf after a run of international features, South Korean auteur Bong Joon-ho launches a sustained attack on the lifestyles of the rich and shameless with his latest Cannes competition contender, Parasite. In previous genre-driven pieces like The Host, Snowpiercer and Okja, Bong tapped the juicy allegorical potential of sci-fi to critique the unjust nature of capitalism and class hierarchy. This time, he ditches the metaphorical layers and adopts a register closer to social realism, albeit spiced with dark satire and noir-ish thriller elements. Whatever the horror-movie connotations of that double-edged title, the morally flawed monsters in Parasite are entirely human. Bong calls the film \"a comedy without clowns, a tragedy without villains.\"\n\nWith its focus on an impoverished family who concoct a wily scheme to boost their bleak prospects, Parasite arrives a little too soon after Hirokazu Kora-Eda's thematically similar Japanese drama Shoplifters, which won the Palme d'Or in Cannes a year ago. Bong’s more splashy, simplistic film will likely draw unflattering parallels, but there are richer cinematic echoes in here, too. At times the plot teasingly recalls Joseph Losey's The Servant and Pier Paolo Pasoloni’s Theorem, poison-tipped parables about cunning social outcasts staging stealth home invasions against upper-class hosts.\n\nLike much of Bong’s work, Parasite is cumbersomely plotted and heavy-handed in its social commentary. The largely naturalistic treatment here may also alienate some of his fantasy fanboy constituency. That said, this prickly contemporary drama still feels more coherent and tonally assured than Snowpiercer or Okja, and packs a timely punch that will resonate in our financially tough, politically polarized times. It opens May 30 in South Korea, where Bong has a consistently strong commercial track record, with more territories to follow in June. After Cannes it should also enjoy a healthy festival run, starting with Sydney on June 15. New York-based outfit Neon inked U.S. distribution rights at AFM last year.\n\nFrom the opening scene, Bong sets up a stark visual contrast between the unequal social castes at play here. Disheveled patriarch Ki-taek (Song Kang-ho) and his family are crammed into a sunken, cluttered, bug-infested basement apartment at the end of a shabby street on the wrong side of the tracks. Ki-taek, his wife Chung-sook (Chang Hyae-jin), son Ki-woo (Choi Woo-shik) and daughter Ki-jung (Park So-dam) are all penniless and unemployed, unable to even hold down a lowly shared job folding cardboard pizza boxes. Without bad luck, they would have no luck at all.\n\nBut fortune favors the bold, especially when the bold are armed with flexible ethics and sharp forgery skills. Following a tip from a well-connected pal, Ki-woo lands a sweet job as a private tutor for Da-hye (Jung Ziso), the high-schooler daughter of wealthy corporate CEO Mr. Park (Lee Sun-kyun) and his glamorously vacant wife Yeon-kyo (Cho Yeo-jeong). In contrast to Ki-taek’s family, the Parks live high above the city in an airy, spacious, pristine modernist mansion shielded by thick concrete walls. A quick-thinking opportunist, Ki-woo spots a chance of securing jobs for his entire clan with the Parks, playing on their snobbish aspirations like a virtuoso. The plan runs smoothly, even if it means callously displacing the family’s existing domestic staff.\n\nIn an unusually personal plea, Bong has requested Cannes reviewers not to reveal plot spoilers about the second act of Parasite. As it happens, there is not one big twist here but multiple small revelations and reverses, each ramping up the stakes. A deftly choreographed rainstorm sequence hammers home the impossibly wide gulf between high and low, rich and poor. Bong then makes the film’s class-war subtext concrete with a bloody struggle for survival that leaves no one holding the moral high ground.\n\nInitially a little slow to set up its dynamic tension, Parasite peaks during its lively mid-section as a fast-paced, black-hearted, Coens-esque farce before climaxing with a chaotic orgy of vengeful violence. As ever, Bong’s bludgeoning attacks on economic injustice have more passion than nuance, while a superfluous coda about secret coded messages is a clumsy twist too far. A good 15 minutes of the pic’s generous two-hour-plus running time could be comfortably trimmed.\n\nNonetheless, Parasite is generally gripping and finely crafted, standing up well as Bong’s most mature state-of-the-nation statement since Memories of Murder in 2003. The performances are uniformly solid, with special credit due to the child and teen actors. Hong Kyung-pyo’s high-gloss cinematography combines lustrous candy-shop colors with kinetic precision, while Lee Ha-jun’s production design is typically superb, especially the elegantly minimalist Park family mansion, which serves as both deluxe fortress and sinister prison. Spliced into Jung Jaei-il’s dread-laden score, fragrant bouquets of classical music provide bustling comic counterpoint as well as wry commentary on the snooty cultural values being slowly eviscerated onscreen.\n\nProduction company: Barunson E&A\n\nCast: Song Kang-ho, Choi Woo-shik, Chang Hyae-jin, Park So-dam, Lee Sun-kyun, Cho Yeo-jeong, Jung Ziso, Lee Jung-em, Jung Hyeon-jun\n\nDirector: Bong Joon-ho\n\nScreenwriters: Bong Joon-ho, Han Jin-won\n\nProducers: Jang Young-Hwan, Moon Yang-kwon, Kwak Sin-ae\n\nCinematographer: Hong Kyung-pyo\n\nEditor: Yang Jinmo\n\nMusic: Jung Jaei-il\n\nArt director: Lee Ha-jun\n\nVenue: Cannes Film Festival (Competition)\n\nSales: CJ Entertainment\n\n131 minutes"
