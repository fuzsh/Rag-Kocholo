The guilt and alienation caused by the witnessing of atrocities wreak havoc on his present life. • After failing the exam needed to apply to university, three workingclass teens are confronted by their limited life choices. • After moving into a new abode, a young man ﬁnds a love letter in his mailbox addressed to the previous tenant. He answers the correspondence, beginning a love affair that transgresses both space and time. • By day a depressed, unappreciated bank clerk, but by night, a villainous, masked professional wrestler popular with fanatics of the sport! • A down-on-her luck taxi driver and a cynical prostitute team up, planning to rob the brutal gangsters who have wronged them. • A deaf young man resorts to kidnapping a child in order to fund a kidney transplant for his dying sister. When the abduction ends tragically, the bereaved father sets out to get revenge for the death of his kidnapped daughter. 1\n\n2\n\nIntroduction\n\nUpon reading the scenarios listed previously, many ﬁlmgoers would assume that they describe American features, for they represent a wide range of genres—the war ﬁlm, teen ﬁlm, romance, comedy, heist ﬁlm, and thriller—and a varied approach to cinema production, from the low-budget independent feature to the studio-produced commercial release, from the high-concept blockbuster to the more esoteric art ﬁlm. The supposition that these are American and, more speciﬁcally, Hollywood plots is not a faulty one, given the dominance of the American ﬁlm oligopoly on screens around the world and the common misconception that only American cinema is diverse. After all, the French make pretentious, cerebral ﬁlms; Italians make sex comedies; Mexicans make wrestling and horror movies or wrestling/horror movies; Indians make sappy, overwrought musicals; and East Asians (often undifferentiated ) make martial arts actioners. Such prejudices fail to recognize the rich and varied ﬁlm cultures of these national and regional cinemas, including that of South Korea. The brief plot synopses listed describe White Badge (Jeong Ji-yeong 1992), Three Friends (Yim Soon-rye 1996), Il Mare (Lee Hyeon-seung 2000), The Foul King (Kim Jee-woon 2000), No Blood No Tears (Ryoo Seung-wan 2000), and Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (Park Chan-wook 2002), respectively—South Korean ﬁlms lauded by both critics and audiences the world over, including in the United States. (Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance received limited theatrical distribution in late 2005, while the American remake of Il Mare, The Lake House, starring Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, was released in 2006). The variation represented by these ﬁlms speaks to the thriving cinema culture in the southern half of the Korean peninsula. In a remarkable act of prognostication, an article published in a 1985 issue of World Press Review predicted, “South Korea has the ammunition to blast Japan off the screen,”1 which in the last decade it has, even in the theaters of Tokyo. Further, Korea has displaced Japan as the center of “cool” popular culture, as evidenced by the titular and setting change of the sequel to Hong Kong’s Tokyo Raiders (Jingle Ma 2000). It is not Tokyo Raiders II; it is Seoul Raiders (Jingle Ma 2005). But it was not only the Japanese and Hong Kong industries that experienced the popularity of “kim chic.” In less than twenty years, Korean cinema, once a local cinema on the verge of collapse, has emerged as an international economic and cultural powerhouse, becoming the most the dominant cinema in Asia.2 Today it is common to see Korean ﬁlms regularly listed among the top ten ﬁlms in Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand, and Taiwan. At home, Korean cinema is enjoying an unprecedented success, in many ways surpassing the achievements of its Golden Age, a decade of critical and commercial ﬂourishing that lasted from the mid-1950s to the late 1960s. In the 1990s, new ﬁlmmakers rescued the industry from the\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\neconomic disasters of the 1970s and 1980s, wrenching their screens from the grip of Hollywood. In 2003 for example, local productions made up eight of the ten top-grossing ﬁlms. The following year, Korean-made ﬁlms accounted for more than 50% of the total box ofﬁce.3 In order to serve this nation of cinephiles, the number of screens has risen with attendance and box-ofﬁce grosses. As of 2003, the number of screens increased from a paltry 404 in 1982 to 1,324. In addition to the opening of art and repertory theaters such as the Dongsung Cinemateque, the Core Art Hall, and the Cinecube Gwanghwamun in Seoul, construction of new screening spaces grew tremendously in the last decade. The country’s ﬁrst multiplex, the CGV11 in Seoul, the ﬁrst in a chain of theaters established by CJ Entertainment in partnership with Golden Harvest (Hong Kong) and Village Roadshow (Australia) was constructed in 1998. The venture proved lucrative, and soon other investment groups and corporations followed suit, such as the Tong Yang Group and Lotte. Several of the new multiplexes operate with twenty-four-hour programming, offering amenities many American theatergoers can only dream about, such as all-stadium seating, state-of-the-art sound systems, large screens, and couple seating. Within the CGV megaplex moviegoers can enjoy a function room, game center, cafe, billiard hall, shopping mall, discount store, and restaurants. The massive expansion in exhibition spaces has done little to dilute audiences. According to a Forbes news wire, “Korean cinemas are among the most heavily attended in the world, with an average attendance of more than 100,000 per screen, or nearly three times that of U.S. theaters.”5 One can trace the emergence of such a vibrant national cinema culture in other ways as well—the movement of the Korean Film Archive to the $2 billion Seoul Arts Complex, completed in 1993; the upgrading of the Archive’s legal status from a nonproﬁt to a government afﬁliated foundation in 2002; and the restructuring of the Korean Motion Picture Promotion Corporation (KMPPC), founded in 1974, into the Korean Film Council (KOFIC) under the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. KOFIC now oversees the Korean Academy of Film Arts, the MediACT Center (a media literacy program for the public), an art theater that screens both new and retrospective ﬁlms, the Namyangju Studio Complex, and the promotion of Korean ﬁlms abroad. In addition to these major areas of growth is the continuing expansion of the Pusan International Film Festival, which has overtaken both the Hong Kong and Tokyo international ﬁlm festivals to become the preeminent festival in Asia. Held annually in the southern city of Busan, the festival has gone from 173 ﬁlms from thirty one nations in 1996 to 307 ﬁlms from more than seventy countries in 2005. Throngs of locals mix with ﬁlm industry professionals to see the sold-out screenings and attend special events.\n\n4\n\nIntroduction\n\nMore than 80% of the screenings are attended by “guests,” where, at the conclusion of the showing, directors, writers, actors, and cinematographers graciously ﬁeld questions put forth by the audience. It is common to see programmers from other festivals around the globe in attendance, using the Korean venue to aid in their selections for their respective festivals. There is no better place to see Asian ﬁlms by new cutting-edge directors, under the New Currents designation, or Korean ﬁlms—either those not seen in decades in the Retrospective category, or new ﬁlms by emerging directors, under the Korean Panorama. What may appeal most to those who work in the motion picture industry is the Pusan Promotion Plan (PPP), started in 1997, considered the “mecca of the Asian ﬁlm market.” An integral part of the Festival’s offerings, the PPP serves the international ﬁlm industry by providing seminars and workshops for ﬁlmmakers and producers. Every year, more than one hundred projects are submitted in competition, from which a few are selected, based on their artistic strength, potential for coproduction, and director (either noteworthy or promising). The selected directors and producers are given the opportunity to meet with ﬁnanciers and distributors to secure funding for their proposed works. In only seven years, the Pusan Promotion Plan has assisted in the production of over 160 features, from more than ﬁfteen countries, including the Philippines, Cambodia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Iran, Thailand, Vietnam, India, Korea, Japan, China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Directors who have beneﬁted from the program include Ann Hui, Fruit Chan, Stanley Kwan, Clara Law, Danny Pang, Nan Achnas, Pen-ek Ratanaruang, Imamura Shohei, Kurosawa Kiyoshi, Sakamoto Junji, Kim Ki-duk, Lee Chang-dong, Wang Xiaoshuai, Tian Zhuang-zhuang, Hou Hsiao-Hsien, Riri Riza, Joan Chen, Sudhir Mishra, and Jafar Panahi. Such a healthy and exciting state of affairs was not always the case. Historically, South Korean cinema was among the most stiﬂed of industries, hindered by the annexation of the peninsula by Japan during the development of the medium through the end of World War II and the fragmentation of the nation and civil war that erupted in 1950. It was not until the mid-1950s that South Korean cinema came of age, entering into what is commonly known as the Golden Age, producing more than one hundred ﬁlms per year. By the 1960s, the number of releases had doubled. Increased censorship, fueled by heightened Cold War ideology and a series of authoritarian governments, made it increasingly difﬁcult for ﬁlmmakers to exercise creative freedom, however. This, coupled with the transformation in Hollywood toward high-concept blockbusters in the\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\n1970s, made it difﬁcult for the lower-budgeted Korean melodramas and family comedies to compete with American spectacles for screening venues. Theaters closed, and the number of Korean features dropped to a low of only seventy-three ﬁlms by 1982. That same year saw the number of tickets sold drop to 42,737,086, a signiﬁcant decrease from the ﬁgure for 1969, when 173,043,272 tickets were sold.6 The miraculous turnaround of the 1990s was initiated by a complex number of developments—changes in trade laws that led to a loosening of censorship, the movement toward a democratic form of government, rapid industrialization and the growth of the middle-class, a shift in ﬁnance laws that altered the funding process, and the legacy of the 1980s Korean New Wave.7 The ﬁrst-time directors of the New Wave, who were exposed to media production as active participants in the democracy movement, circumvented the old apprenticeship route to directing. Experimenting with style and content, ﬁlmmakers such as Park Kwangsu and Jang Sun-woo reinvigorated the national ﬁlm industry with more complex narrative structures, nonconventional ﬁlm styles, and content critical of societal structures—changes that would soon be manifest in the more successful commercial releases that followed. This anthology looks to those later features, examining them from the valuable approach offered by Andrew Higson, which looks beyond close textual analysis to consider the context of ﬁlm culture and national culture.8 The chapters gathered herein analyze speciﬁc ﬁlms, examining them in relation to the ﬁlm culture that includes features from other nations, marketing, modes of production, audiences, other forms of popular culture, and wider cultural discourses. It is not intended to be comprehensive, as such an endeavor would be impossible, given that Korean studies, in general, and research on Korean cinema, more speciﬁcally, is still a burgeoning area on this side of the Paciﬁc. It is intended to add to the body of research in ﬁlm studies begun by such pioneering scholars as Ahn Byung-sup, Kim Soyoung, Chungmoo Choi, Kyung Hyun Kim, Hyangjin Lee, and David James. The chapters have been written with a broad readership in mind, theoretically informed, but without a requirement of intimate knowledge of complex ﬁlm theory on the part of the reader. Though the chapters included survey a large body of work, the authors have concentrated their efforts on representative features readily available in various video formats in order to facilitate further study. The book is divided into three distinct parts, organized according to the different approaches and subjects the authors have employed in their interrogation of Korean cinema. Part 1 serves as an introduction to the ﬁeld of study, concentrating on industry and regulatory structures and\n\n6\n\nIntroduction\n\nthe three dominant genres that have led Korean ﬁlm to the forefront of Asian cinema—the melodrama, the big-budget action blockbuster, and the youth ﬁlm. In Part 2, “Directing New Korean Cinema,” the focus is on close readings of feature ﬁlms by several noted directors who have emerged at the forefront of the national cinema. The ﬁve chapters consider the relation of style and aesthetics to subject, to ideology, to culture, and to Korean ﬁlm history. The last section, “Narratives of the National,” concerns speciﬁc ﬁlms within their sociocultural contexts and the impact of historical events and their legacies—Japanese colonialism, the Cold War and Korean Conﬂict, and U.S. neocolonialism. Resistance against traditions of sexism, racism, and homophobia are also explored. The anthology opens with Seung Hyun Park, who carefully traces the trajectory of government policies overseeing the ﬁlm industry. In his chapter, “Korean Cinema after Liberation: Production, Industry, and Regulatory Trends,” Park provides critical data about the management of ﬁlm as a cultural commodity, detailing the links between changes in regimes to the modiﬁcations of the Motion Picture Laws, edicts that covered censorship, the licensing of production companies, import and screen quotas, and ideological imperatives. This chapter makes clear the history of industrial organization that made it possible for Korean cinema to evolve into the global powerhouse it is today. One of the ﬁlms that helped establish contemporary Korean ﬁlm in Asia is Hur Jin-ho’s Christmas in August (1998), which played in Hong Kong continuously for two months, a rare feat, even for a Hong Kong feature. Darcy Paquet examines this ﬁlm as representative of what is arguably the most important genre in Korean cinema—the melodrama. In tracing the ideology of melodramatic form and the history of the genre in Korea, Paquet delineates how the ﬁlm both adheres to and deviates from convention, modernizing both narrative content and style to signal the tremendous changes the industry would experience in subsequent years. Chi-Yun Shin and Julian Stringer offer a fascinating case study of Shiri (Kang Je-kyu 1999), the ﬁlm that, in many ways, symbolizes the transformation alluded to in the ﬁrst two chapters. This spy thriller/ action ﬁlm offered Korean moviegoers the spectacle of a big-budget Hollywood summer ﬂick, but within a distinctly Korean context. With the ability to “out-Hollywood Hollywood,” besting James Cameron’s behemoth Titanic to earn its place as the biggest box-ofﬁce success in Korean history at the time, Shiri and the cultural phenomenon it generated—the Shiri Syndrome—led to a series of bigger, louder, and more sensational releases. The authors discuss the implications of the blockbuster, highlighting the contradictions inherent in this postmodern form. Hedonism, immediate gratiﬁcation, rampant materialism, and the ﬂattening of emotional affect, attributes of the postmodern condition, are\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nperhaps most evident in the contemporary youth ﬁlm, features both concerned with and targeted to what has now become the most desired demographic of marketing departments globally. Given that the most proﬁtable industries target their products to the group with the most disposable income, it is no surprise that young people comprise the bulk of ﬁlm characters and ﬁlm audiences worldwide. Korea is no exception. David Desser, in the essay entitled “Timeless, Bottomless Bad Movies” (a play on Jang Sun-woo’s anarchic Timeless Bottomless Bad Movie [1988]), provides an overview of the Korean youth ﬁlm, the third most pervasive industry trend. Desser argues that the global interest in youth subcultures is directly related to the transnational reach of Korean cinema. He supports his supposition by analyzing the tropes of technology, gang membership, prostitution, the crime spree, education, and class difference. Chris Berry opens Part 2 with a study focusing on the work of the late Kim Ki-young, considered one of the most radical directors in Asia. His work, often compared to that of Imamura Shohei, Alfred Hitchcock, Sam Fuller, Nicholas Ray, Roger Corman, and Ed Wood, offers a unique perspective of modernization on the peninsula. Berry looks speciﬁcally at Kim’s use of genre blending. The combination of horror and melodrama that Kim innovated in The Housemaid (1960) presents a complex deployment of realist styles alongside the fantastic. Berry interrogates the ambivalent and sometimes contradictory themes of Kim Ki-young’s oeuvre, with particular attention to issues of gender roles in the midst of modernization. Modernization is a preeminent theme in Korean art, literature, and ﬁlm, reﬂecting the rapid and radical transformation of the nation. As Hye Seung Chung and David Scott Diffrient describe in their contribution to this volume, the country shifted from “post-War poverty to chaebol-led prosperity, from chamber pot tradition to mobile-phone modernity.” The authors provide close readings of two pivotal ﬁlms. The ﬁrst is Peppermint Candy (2000), whose narrative unfolds with a regressive temporality, presenting in reverse chronological order, without the use of ﬂashbacks, the life of its aimless and amoral protagonist. Chung and Diffrient demonstrate how this structure exempliﬁes the dystopian implications of postcolonial modernization. Their explanation of the important historical events alluded to in the ﬁlm’s episodic narrative provides readers a deeper understanding of how director Lee Chang-dong ultimately narrates the story not of a man but of the nation. The second ﬁlm discussed, Hong Sang-soo’s Virgin Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors (2000), also presents a structurally complex narrative. Utilizing a more postmodern sensibility, it “straddles an immediate past and present,” taking the Korean folk tradition of pansori and integrating it with a style of narrative Cubism, hence the allusion to Duchamp’s painting The Bride Stripped Bare by Her Bachelors. As the authors argue, the aesthetic challenge to the conventions of linear\n\n8\n\nIntroduction\n\nnarrative offered by the two noted directors serves as an expression of contemporary Korea’s fragmented and disjunctive cultural condition. Hangsoon Yi continues the discussion of style, narrative, and social crisis in her study of director Park Chul-soo, with a focus on his use of reﬂexivity. Yi provocatively contends in her close reading that Farewell, My Darling (1986) represents a bold break from both mainstream, traditional Korean ﬁlms and the New Wave, confounding the boundaries of the diegetic and nondiegetic to simultaneously validate and critique ﬁlmmaking as process, while also deconstructing the genre of the family melodrama and examining the changing status of the family unit. In “Nowhere to Hide: The Tumultuous Materialism of Lee Myungse,” Anne Rutherford takes on Lee’s genre-exploding, visually stunning tour de force in an analysis of its appeal to sensory pleasures. Like the directors noted previously in this section, Lee Myung-se goes against Korean cinematic tradition in this work by attempting a ﬁlm based on materiality rather than emotional identiﬁcation. Using the montage theories of Eisenstein, the genre explorations of Steve Neale and Marcia Landy, and Miriam Hansen’s work on mimesis, Rutherford offers a compelling study of how Korea’s leading visual stylist constructs Nowhere to Hide (1999) as true cinematic spectacle. The independently produced Why Has Bodhidharma Left for the East? (1989) is the subject of Linda C. Ehrlich’s chapter, a treatise on the aesthetics and signiﬁcance of Zen Buddhism in Bae Yong-kyun’s most noted ﬁlm. Careful attention reveals how the ﬁlm’s recurring motifs— complicating juxtapositions, varying light, circular camera movements, and symbolism of the journey, and the overall ﬁlm style—serve as a reminder of the continuing importance of traditional religion and culture in postmodern Korea. Part 3, “Narratives of the National,” opens with my chapter on the recent trend of action ﬁlms concerned with the historic relations between Japan and Korea. The recent turn away from melodrama toward violent blockbusters revisiting national trauma is attributed to a complex intersection of industry concerns, gender anxieties, neo-Confucianism, the rise of the nation as an economic powerhouse, and the return of the repressed. I argue that these commercialized texts construct nationalism and national identity in narrow terms, as exclusively male projects. It is the independently produced documentary, with its tradition of social progressivism, that serves as intervention in this process of mediated nation building. The example focused upon in this chapter is Byun Young-joo’s remarkable trilogy of documentaries—Murmuring (1995), Habitual Sadness (1997), and My Own Breathing (1999)—about the lives of former “comfort women.”\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nNo discussion of narratives of the national in South Korean cinema would be thorough without including an examination of the Cold War, the unresolved Korean Conﬂict, and the tensions between the Republic of Korea and its neighbor to the north, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Suk-Young Kim offers a detailed study of the construction of North Korea, its citizens, and Communist ideology, linking these images to South Korean government policy, American portrayals, and the shifting attitudes of the populace. Kim looks beyond the clichéd stereotypes of spies and villainy in her close analysis of Spy Li Cheol Jin (Jang Jin 1999), noting the narrative strategies that allow, perhaps for the ﬁrst time, a sympathetic, more humanized depiction of an agent sent across the border into the South. Her analysis of Joint Security Area (Park Chanwook 2000) links the ﬁlm’s transgressive friendships between the soldiers stationed on the DMZ to issues of postmodern identity. Identity is also the central concern in the next chapter, a revealing analysis of Kim Ki-duk’s Address Unknown (2001). A maverick director, Kim Ki-duk is revered as much as he is reviled (in recent years he has been acclaimed at a number of prestigious festivals such as Berlin and Locarno, as well as attacked for his controversial depictions of the darker, seamier aspects of Korean society). The author takes one of Kim’s most complex, and in many ways, difﬁcult ﬁlms, deciphering the speciﬁc cultural codes and metaphors that critique marginality constructed on the basis of race, gender, class, sexuality, neocolonialism, and national identity. As the chapter informs us, the historical speciﬁcity and location of the ﬁlm (an impoverished postwar village dependent on the neighboring U.S. military base); the themes of miscegenation, sexual exploitation, and cruelty; and the starkly beautiful cinematography make for a truly compelling work that refuses to turn away from the despair and degradation caused by social hierarchies. One of the most compelling aspects of contemporary Korean society is the ongoing shift in gender roles and the growth of the feminist movement. In all grassroots struggles for democracy and social justice, the participation of women is integral in the push for progressive change. It is common to ﬁnd feminist groups working in coalition with other NGOs, such as student organizations, labor unions, and others. Such was case of the democracy movement in South Korea. Hence gender issues are intimately related to issues of the nation. Diane Carson’s contribution to this collection focuses on the compelling, and sometimes disturbing, 301/302 (1995), a ﬁlm that links national crises to gender oppression, eating disorders, sexual violence, and trauma. The ﬁlm, as sensuous as its subject—food—handles its unsavory issues with what Carson describes as “a courageous, even astonishing, presentation.” Park Chul-soo’s dynamic\n\n10\n\nIntroduction\n\nuse of the camera within the coldly impersonal and often claustrophobic space of the two third-ﬂoor apartments (to which the title refers) provides an unﬂinching view of the effects of patriarchal privilege. As Carson reminds us, such ﬁlms are rare within South Korean cinema, especially during a period of industrywide “remasculinization.” As journalist Stephen Short reminds us, contemporary Asian cinema, including that of Korea, is full of action, and “we don’t mean car crashes.”9 With the loosening of censorship regulations, most notably in 1996 when the Supreme Court ruled forced editing illegal under the constitution, ﬁlmmakers eagerly, and with reckless abandon, began to explore what had previously been judged taboo—excessive violence and explicit sexuality. Some of the more striking examples include the depiction of female desire in An Affair (E. J. Yong 1998), which features an alienated middle-aged housewife involved with a younger man, her sister’s ﬁancé; a brutal attempted rape committed by the teen protagonist in the opening scene of Tears (Im Sang-soo 2000), and another in Oasis (Lee Chang-dong 2002), where a social outcast forces himself on a woman with cerebral palsy; and in Happy End (Jeong-Jiwu 1999) the display of uninhibited sex between an adulterous wife and her lover. The controversial Too Young to Die (Park Jin-pyo 2002), a ﬁction ﬁlm about the sexual pleasure enjoyed by a real-life septuagenarian couple, was originally banned from release and later given an 18+ rating because of ambiguous sex scenes in which audiences could not determine if the intercourse presented is simulated or real. In Desire (Kim Eungsu 2002), a woman beds a man after she ﬁnds out he, a male prostitute, is her husband’s lover. In the concluding chapter of this book, Robert L. Cagle takes on one of the most contentious issues in contemporary Korean society, homosexuality. His analysis of Bungee Jumping of Their Own (Kim Dae-seung 2001) proves the ﬁlm to be one of the ﬁrst to treat same-sex romance seriously and sympathetically, marking a radical move away from staid stereotypes and the use of gay men as comic relief. In a particularly cogent argument, Cagle notes how the themes are communicated through both the miseen-scène and the nonlinear narrative structure. Whereas several authors have argued that the fragmented narratives so characteristic of Korean cinema function as a trope representing postmodern crises and trauma, Cagle asserts that the structure of this ﬁlm, built around a series of ellipses and repetition, opens up a space for homosexual desire. The contributors to this work have utilized approaches, theories, and methodologies as varied as the ﬁlms themselves in an attempt to aid in the understanding of the international phenomenon that is New Korean Cinema. It is particularly imperative to examine South Korean cinema at this critical moment, to provide a context for newly exposed\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\naudiences. Korean cinema is now positioned at the nexus of the globalizing ﬁlm industry. While the major ﬁlmmaking centers of Asia have all engaged in coproductions with Korean media corporations, the Hollywood industry has sought to proﬁt from the popularity of Korean features by obtaining the rights to remake several ﬁlms. Lee Hyeon-seung’s romance Il Mare (2000) was purchased by Warner Brothers; Cho Jin Kyu’s 2001 action/comedy My Wife Is a Gangster, by Miramax; and My Sassy Girl (Kwak Jae-yong 2001), a light-hearted romantic drama, by Dreamworks. There is also the gangster comedy Hi, Dharma (Park Cheolkwan 2002), bought by MGM, and the ultraviolent drama Oldboy (Park Chan-wook 2003), acquired by Universal. In 2006 the ﬁrst Korean ﬁlm was released theatrically with wide distribution by a Hollywood major in the United States, the action ﬁlm Typhoon (Kwak Kyung-taek 2005), distributed by Dreamworks. The signiﬁcance of South Korea to the American ﬁlm industry also can also be measured by the number of column inches in Hollywood trade publications. The Pusan International Film Festival is covered annually, internal industry developments are noted, and ﬁlms are reviewed regularly. Since February 2005, Variety has included South Korea in its weekly international box ofﬁce report. The industry fascination and critical accolades heaped on Korean ﬁlms at prestigious international festivals such as Berlin, Cannes, and Venice have garnered the attention of the public. Feature ﬁlms (and TV melodramas) capture the interest of audiences beyond the specialty cinemas, unlike Hindi ﬁlms for instance, which, though regularly appearing among Variety’s compilation of top-ﬁfty box-ofﬁce earners in the United States, play mostly to NRI’s (Non-Resident Indians) and South Asian Americans. Moviegoers in North America can experience Korean ﬁlms in retrospectives (such as at the Lincoln Center or Smithsonian), at local festivals (like Seattle, Toronto, and Philadelphia) or in their neighborhood theaters, as several have enjoyed theatrical distribution. DVDs no longer have to be purchased or rented from specialty Internet sites, as they are readily available at mainstream outlets such as Blockbuster and Hollywood Video. This book is intended for those who have yet to venture into this exciting terrain and for those who may have sampled Korean cinema and wish to savor more thoroughly the delights of what many consider the most dynamic national cinema in the world today.\n\nf Korean names are listed throughout the text as they are rendered in Korean, with surname ﬁrst and given name second.

This policy failed, however, for it was centered on the political intention to control cinematic activity through censorship, essentially eliminating controversial ideological content. Because the policy did not grow out of a carefully planned, longconceived design, it was continually revised, subject to shifting political circumstances and complaints from the industry. In a sense, the history of ﬁlm industry protections in South Korean cinema is a history of regulation. The protection system’s decline was considered to have begun in 1987. People in the ﬁlm industry viewed the entrance of Hollywood distribution companies in Korea from a consistently hostile stance. The marketplace was expected to reﬂect increased competition, and the government, having surrendered its control of the ﬁlm industry to the industry itself, could no longer secure stable proﬁts for home-based producers. Both the government and once-powerful industry leaders hoped to sustain EFORE\n\n15\n\n16\n\nSeung Hyun Park\n\nthe status quo of the restrictive system, but U.S. economic pressure prohibited them from doing so. Independent producers, who had been excluded from ﬁlm production since the early 1960s, looked upon the coming uncertainty as a crucial opportunity, a chance to enter into the system with the possibility of making lucrative proﬁts. The rise of what would become known as a “new wave” reinvigorated the industry, so much so that ﬁlm critics such as Tony Rayns argue that Korean cinema has been more innovative and surprising than any other national cinema since the end of the 1980s. The formation of the New Wave was related to several factors: the transformation of the Korean ﬁlm industry, the alleviation of political censorship, and the emergence of young directors. To understand the signiﬁcance of the movement, we must ﬁrst look to the period immediately preceding it.\n\nThe Depression Period of Korean Cinema, 1973–1986 South Korea had a highly authoritarian political system from the early 1970s to the end of 1986. Park Chung-hee, who took political power in 1961,1 and his program of Yushin Kaehyuk (Revitalizing Reforms)2 in October 1972, brought the political climate to what many consider the nation’s lowest point. After Park’s death in October 1979, Chun Doohwan initiated a military coup, seizing power in 1980, killing several hundred citizens in Gwangju.3 Cumings argues that the Chun government was fundamentally Park’s system in a new guise (46). Between 1972 and 1986, state power precluded dissent through censorship and managed the mass media to consolidate its doctrine. Like other media, cinema functioned to shape political opinion to favor the centralized government’s designated political and economic goals. The censorship board operated as a means to block controversial narratives and representations that threatened political stability and unity, with support from the state that limited private competition in ﬁlm production. Censorship became more oppressive during this period, inﬂuenced by the political hardline. There were restrictions on ﬁlms that might disrupt the existing order by violating good taste or customs, harming the interest and dignity of the country, praising North Korea and Communism, or criticizing the president and government policies in South Korea. Filmmakers were placed in the position of self-regulation, forced to always consider censorship when engaging in production. As Lee Young Il describes: The ﬁlms in the 1970s lacked artistic spirit in ﬁlmmaking and the attitudes of ﬁlmmakers were too easy going. In particular, even if\n\nKorean Cinema after Liberation\n\n17\n\nthe ﬁlms did not contain ideas on problem consciousness and if the ﬁlms had contained social matters or had described social facts very truly and critically, those screenplays were regulated by the censorship authorities according to the then existing “Emergency Measures.” If the ﬁlms were not in line with what we call the ideology of “Renovation” or national integration, they were regulated. By enforcement of the ﬁlm policy for so many years, the ﬁlm directors and producers realized that to make popular ﬁlms in line with the then ﬁlm policy or low class entertainment ﬁlms for countryside theaters was much wiser and the only way they could survive. (188) This oppressive situation continued into the 1980s. The president of the Korean Motion Picture Promotion Corporation (MPPC), Lee Jinkeun, defended censorship in an interview conducted in 1982, stressing that ﬁlm should be a medium that portrayed the bright visions rather than the dark side of Korean society. He contended, Among the guidelines the government sets are these: That our traditional culture should be mixed with foreign cultures to create a more brilliant culture; that motion pictures are not for individuals or certain groups but for the public interest and, therefore, they should make everyone happy. In censorship, generally, security of the nation is most important. Second, ﬁlms should not hurt our cultural heritage. Third, they should not criticize or disregard certain groups in society, such as religious organizations. The trend of movies is toward humanity, emphasizing our life in Korea; both good and bad aspects. Joking with the government ofﬁcials is not important. I’m not saying they are banned, but just saying that we have more important humanity topics to portray than the government. (Lent 138) To a great extent, strict censorship determined subject matter. Working as a decisive mechanism regulating content, censorship also exerted an inﬂuence on production trends, together with the very adroit management of import quotas. Not only did the authorities have the exclusive right to select who could and could not make ﬁlms, but also they encouraged certain kinds of ﬁlms while banning others. Under the period of the import quota system, domestic producers rarely protested against censorship since the government guaranteed them stable proﬁts by limiting competition. Local ﬁlm companies seldom cared about ﬁlm production because it was just a way to maintain their primary business— ﬁlm importation.\n\n18\n\nSeung Hyun Park\n\nThe Park government passed the Fourth Revised Motion Picture Law in April 1973, placing the Korean ﬁlm industry completely under the control of political authorities. The Chun government retained the amended law and its central elements: (1) the establishment of strict censorship; (2) the introduction of a license system for the establishment of ﬁlm companies, reducing competition in the industry; (3) the formation of a protectionist system in the ﬁlm industry through reorganization of import quotas and screen quotas; (4) the establishment of the Motion Picture Promotion Corporation (MPPC) to manage ﬁlm policies; and 5) the encouragement of the production of wholesome movies following political goals. After dissolving several companies in 1973, the Park government afforded only twelve companies the privilege of releasing both domestic and foreign features. The number of licensed companies increased slightly to fourteen in 1974 and twenty in 1981. These licensed companies circulated about ninety domestic ﬁlms and thirty foreign ones yearly from 1973 to 1985. Referring to the production of ﬁlms during this period, Lee Taewon, the most popular producer of the 1980s, admits that every producer made domestic ﬁlms just to get an import quota (570). According to him, only two of the twenty companies had a genuine interest in the production of domestic ﬁlms. Using domestic ﬁlms as a means to obtain import quotas, most producers made several movies a month, even within ﬁfteen days (571). In fact, those selected companies had no incentive to care about the production of domestic ﬁlms because the stable proﬁts came from the distribution rights to foreign ﬁlms. Some domestic features even went to warehouse shelves right after completion, while others were sent directly to second-run theaters. Recognizing this degeneration of domestic industry, Jang Sun-woo refers to the production during this period as “the winter of prostitution” (cited in Joo 62). The import quota system required a company to make four domestic ﬁlms to earn an import quota.4 In addition to this requirement, supplementary quotas were given each year to ﬁlm companies when their ﬁlms either won the awards in the Grand Bell Film Festival5 or were selected as “quality ﬁlms” by the MPPC. The MPPC was established in April 1973, dissolving the existent Union of Korean Film Promotion. The government stated that the purpose of the MPPC was to promote domestic ﬁlms and to support the Korean ﬁlm industry. The actual role of this corporation, however, was to regulate the ﬁlm industry, manage the Grand Bell Awards Festival and select “quality ﬁlms” in order to encourage the production of politically favored ﬁlms. It issued the Film Policy Measure every year to publicize what the authorities wanted from the ﬁlm industry. This practice lasted until 1986. Under Article 1 of the Film Policy Measure, the MPPC\n\nKorean Cinema after Liberation\n\n19\n\nspeciﬁed that Korean cinema should adhere to the political and social guidelines set by the authorities. Filmmakers were compelled to reveal the bright side of social reality and highlight cultural traditions to school the public in the virtues of their ancestors. The authorities tried to teach the audience traditional morality—especially that which involved obedience and respect to authority. They also tried to lead the audience to “do the right thing,” as they saw it. Since the government gave most of the Grand Bell Awards and quality ﬁlm selections to ﬁlms that followed ofﬁcial guidelines, companies produced “policy ﬁlms” to earn another importation quota. This kind of ﬁnancial reward policy mobilized ﬁlm companies to make a number of what were deemed wholesome movies, irrespective of whether these ﬁlms could attract audiences or not. Film importation was almost never a ﬁnancial risk due to the scarcity value of foreign movies in the market. Each foreign ﬁlm was considered to be “a goose bearing golden eggs.” Thus, production of domestic ﬁlms was primarily aimed at earning the quota (Son 269). The production of wholesome ﬁlms was guided by a uniﬁed social goal designed to promote the political legitimacy of the authorities. This goal displayed its ideologies through the representation of the following themes: (1) anti-Communism; (2) heroic historical ﬁgures whose deeds saved the nation in times of difﬁculty; (3) the dedication of the individual to the public interest; and (4) cultural heritage and traditional norms such as ﬁdelity, perseverance, and loyalty. These aspects were essential to indoctrinate citizens to the belief that the authoritarian political was the best way to develop the nation and to protect South Korea from potential enemies, most often represented as invasion by Communists. The theme of anti-Communism was extremely popular, crossing beyond military ﬁlms into a variety of genres such as action, detective ﬁlms, and melodrama. The MPPC produced ﬁve anti-Communist propaganda ﬁlms, including Testimony (Im Kwon-taek 1973), The Battle Field (Lee Man-hee 1974), I Will Never Cry Again (Im Kwon-taek 1974), The Remaining Spy (Kim Si-hyun 1975), and Taebaek Mountains (Im kwon-taek 1994), while licensed companies endeavored to make many others, like The Flame (Yu Hyun-mok 1975), The Hidden Hero (Im Kwon-taek 1979), The Final Witness (Lee Doo-yong 1980), Avengo Flying Rangers (Im Kwontaek 1982), and My Last Memory of Heungnam (Ko Young-nam 1983). Most of these ﬁlms focus on the psychological and behavioral changes of men in a vortex of bloody struggle between Communism and liberal democracy—from ideologically disinterested men into ardent anti-Communists when they recognize the cruelty of Communists. Ofﬁcially backed policy ﬁlms were used either to enliven patriotism or to stress individual sacriﬁce for the public interest. The General Who\n\n20\n\nSeung Hyun Park\n\nWears Red Clothes (Lee Du-yong 1973) and Diary of the Battle Field (Jang Il-ho 1977) deal with heroic ﬁgures in the Chosun-Japan War (1592– 1595), while attributing the division of public opinion of the political system to Japan’s invasion. Yu Gwan-sun (Kim Ki-dok 1974) and Like an Everlasting Pine (Lee Jang-ho 1983) present fearless resistance against Japanese colonial rule. A Daffodil (Choi Hun 1973) and The Mother (Lim Wok-sik 1976) highlight a woman’s dedication to social reform in an agricultural village and in an orphanage, respectively. Policeman (Lee Duyong 1978) and other ﬁlms deal with public ofﬁcials and their service to the common good. The authorities also urged ﬁlms to rekindle pride in the cultural heritage and traditional values. Most ﬁlms of this theme were categorized as literary ﬁlms in Korea because their stories were adaptations of novels. The Soil (Kim Soo-yong 1974) and The Old House (Cho Mun-jin 1977) deal with tragic stories of yangban, the noble class during the Chosun Dynasty, as their families struggle amidst the collapse of the traditional morals such as ﬁlial piety and loyalty to the community. They describe Western values as destructive to the society’s moral structure, persuading audiences to recover traditional morals for national dignity and unity. While keeping pace with the guidelines of the authorities, ﬁlm companies achieved commercial success with the production of these ﬁlms because the novels were already familiar to audiences. However, this trend generated a side effect—an indifference to original scripts. Low-budget action ﬁlms were also a dominant trend, made with very formulaic narrative structures that transported viewers into a world of fantasy where a swordsman or martial artist would sacriﬁce everything to kill an adversary. More than twenty movies produced from 1978 to 1983 had titles with variations on the word Sorim (Shaolin), the temple that is famous for martial arts in China. Usually blessed with a happy ending, these action ﬁlms concerned resistance against Japanese colonial rule or Communist oppression. These were typical “quota quickies,” popular in the 1970s and the early 1980s, though rarely screened in the ﬁrst-run theaters. Melodrama was still the most dominant genre between 1973 and 1986, but the central themes were totally different from those of earlier periods. Melodramas of the 1960s had targeted mainly female audiences, but those of the 1970s were aimed at males. In previous decades, melodramas highlighted the control of women’s sexual desire, focusing on sexual affairs, while of course taking into account given social norms. From the early 1970s to the mid-1980s, melodramas paid almost no regard to existing social morals of chastity. Such ﬁlms as Heavenly Home Coming to Stars (Lee Jang-ho 1974), The Winter Woman (Kim Ho-sun\n\nKorean Cinema after Liberation\n\n21\n\n1977), and The Glory of Night (Kim Ho-sun 1979) depict women’s virginity as a burden, placing young women in successive engagements in search of true love. The melodramas during this period generally dealt with three themes: the story of prostitutes and bar hostesses, the love affairs of young college coeds or similarly aged women, and the extramarital affairs of women, most often in their thirties. Like that of the political system, the period between 1973 and 1986 is viewed as the most depressed period in the history of Korean cinema. Though the nation experienced intensive industrialization and became a highly developed country, emerging as one of Asia’s four tigers together with Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore, human rights were curtailed, and for the ﬁlm industry, decline was inevitable. Economic prosperity created the growth of a middle class who could afford to buy more movie tickets, but Koreans gradually became tired of watching domestic ﬁlms full of female nudity, sentimentalism, sleazy action, and government propaganda. Scholars generally feel that most Korean ﬁlms of the time were cheaply produced hostess movies, low on plot and production values and high on nudity and eroticism (Joo, Lent, Rayns). The ﬁlm industry’s collusion in the dubious import quota system conspired to stiﬂe the quality of domestic ﬁlms. The ﬁlm market showed a rapid decline in almost every area: the number of ﬁlms produced, admission ﬁgures, the average attendance per individual, and even the number of theaters. The average number of ﬁlms attended per individual was 3.7 in 1972; 2.9 in 1974; 1.7 in 1978; and 1.2 in 1981. From 1981 to 1987, this number ﬂuctuated between 1.1 and 1.2. Total admissions in 1986 became approximately one-third of those in 1973, although the population increased by more than 9 million during this period. Film production nose-dived; 122 features in 1973, and 73 in 1986. With lessened product, movie theaters closed regularly after 1971, when the number of theaters peaked at 717. By 1981, only 423 remained open. Full-sized theaters continuously decreased, from 376 in 1983 to only 280 in 1987. The only exception is in total revenues, resulting from an increase of ticket prices from 300 won in 1973 to 2,500 won in 1983. Young people, the primary targeted demographic of feature ﬁlms, avoided the theaters. College students and young intellectuals prided themselves on not going to see ﬁlms made in Korea. In addition, the growing popularity of television began to slice signiﬁcantly into the ﬁlm market. Audience apathy, strict censorship, producers’ indifference to the production of domestic ﬁlms, and resulting artistic and technological stagnancy put the Korean commercial ﬁlm industry in a rather helpless position, completely dependent upon screen quotas for its survival.\n\n22\n\nSeung Hyun Park\n\nThe Transformation of the Korean Film Industry 1987–1997 The trade agreement with the U.S. government, allowing Hollywood companies to distribute their ﬁlms directly to the Korean market beginning in July 1987, caused the Korean ﬁlm industry to radically change every sector—production, distribution, and exhibition. The government began to lose its regulatory mechanism from the beginning of 1987, when the import quota system was ﬁnally invalidated. Anyone could take part in the production of domestic ﬁlms without depositing a portion of anticipated production funds.6 Film companies were also allowed to import foreign ﬁlms without limit as long as they produced one domestic ﬁlm per year. As a result, the number of production companies showed a rapid growth—from 20 in 1984 to 113 in 1991. The number of ﬁlms produced also rose—from 81 in 1984 to 87 in 1988 and 121 in 1991. In a situation where no barriers to importing ﬁlms existed, most companies carried out their business lavishly without any regard to the production of domestic ﬁlms. Therefore, the number of imported ﬁlms soared from 25 in 1985 to 405 in 1996. With the surge of imported ﬁlms, foreign movies began to lose their scarcity value during the late 1980s. After the revocation of import quotas, the import of foreign ﬁlms had become as much of a risky business as the production of domestic ﬁlms. Under this new circumstance, some ﬁlm companies concentrated their efforts on the production of domestic ﬁlms. Their newborn enthusiasm provided a number of young directors with the chance to make ﬁlms, directors whose work became known as the Korean New Wave. This new generation of ﬁlmmakers, who were mostly in their thirties, brought fresh spirit to the industry; reviving domestic production with their innovative and challenging ﬁlms. Between 1988 and 1997, many directors came to make their debuts without having worked as assistant directors under the Chungmuro7 (studio) system, a career progression previously unheard of. Some came from a background exclusively in 16mm production, while others emerged from other art sectors. No matter what their origin, these new ﬁlmmakers marked a turning point in Korean ﬁlm, generating a more serious approach to ﬁlmmaking. Jang Sun-woo, one of the vanguard, viewed ﬁlm as the most powerful political and social weapon because it could reach a mass audience while also enabling him to express himself through the artistic medium (Joo 153). Others saw ﬁlm as a device of pure artistic expression, a chance to experi-\n\nKorean Cinema after Liberation\n\n23\n\nment with innovative ideas and ﬁlm language. Lee Myung-se, one of the most creative ﬁlmmakers of the movement, viewed ﬁlmmaking as an individual expression dealing with what he presumed to be real—thoughts, dreams, and fantasies, as well as things that could be seen—without political implications (Rayns 41). The initial impulse motivating the Korean New Wave was the realistic manifestation of contemporary society. The ﬁlms were sincere, insightful reﬂections of what the directors perceived as the existential realities of the nation. They dealt with contemporary social issues such as political oppression, anti-Americanism, labor, and student movements. They were also concerned with the changing lives of Korean people in an increasingly modernized and industrialized society. Seoul, the largest city in the country, was portrayed by such iconography as buildings, streets, and billboards, a city of stray people whose traditional values had been rendered obsolete by the end of the agricultural era. People were presented as living in a moral vacuum where anxiety and uncertainty pervaded the atmosphere. The bleakness of the city was reﬂected, for example, in A Rooster (Shin Seung-soo 1990), the story of a middle-aged married man who is incompetent economically as well as sexually. The ﬁlm presents the disappearance of meaningful interaction between family members and the dispersion of prostitution throughout the city. The Day a Pig Fell into the Well (Hong Sang-soo 1996) mirrors ordinary people’s psychological problems of frustration, loneliness, and alienation resulting from the emptiness of interpersonal relations in modernized, metropolitan cities.\n\nFigure 1.1. White Badge (Jeong Ji-yeong 1992), ordinary people and the Vietnam War.\n\n24\n\nSeung Hyun Park\n\nThe movement also created another trend—critical depictions of the recent past from perspectives that differed from the ofﬁcial history. Korean history had been either distorted by government propaganda or mystiﬁed by political taboos. Affected by minjung8 literature and theology during the 1980s, historical studies became the ﬁrst movement to provide the public with alternative versions of post–Korean War history. The New Wave inherited that tradition and created images of the recent past according to the experiences of ordinary people. Films such as Southern Communist Guerrillas (Jeong Ji-young 1990) and The Silver Stallion (Jang Gil-su 1992) concern forgotten stories of the Korean War, while The Song for a Resurrection (Lee Jung-gook 1990) and A Petal (Jang Sun-woo 1996) reﬂects on the memory of the Gwangju Uprising. White Badge (Jeong Jiyoung 1992) and Blue Sleeve (Kim Yoo Vin 1993) focus on Korea’s involvement in the Vietnam War. The New Wave also concerned the lives of women within a radically transient context. The status of women mirrored the paradoxical aspects of Korean society, which is basically Confucian, but also Westernized, strongly inﬂuenced by the processes of industrialization and modernization. Films like Because You Are a Woman (Kim Yoo-jin 1990) and A Dog’s Afternoon (Lee Min-yong 1995) portrayed the reality of women’s oppression, as well as the struggles and dilemmas of their search for new identities. Romantic comedies like Marriage Story (Kim Eui-suk 1992) became extremely popular, portraying the relations between husbands and wives as egalitarian, depicting the conﬂict resulting from these new relationships. However, the ﬁlms seldom gave radical challenge to sexual relations with a more feminist consciousness. In addition to the shift in content, the movement also changed ﬁlm form in commercial feature releases. Narrative ﬂow was more elliptical and the connection between storylines more irregular. Plots became more ambiguous. The use of long takes, the conscious manipulation of composition in space and depth, and the mixture of dramatic ﬁction with documentary footage made the ﬁlms even more interesting. Directors also began to develop their own diverse styles. Im Kwon-taek, actually a veteran of the cinema, developed a “Korean style” of poetic visual expressions through his depictions of bucolic and pastoral scenery of nostalgic images. In Sopyonje (1995), he uses a nine-minute take to follow the characters. In The Day a Pig Fell into the Well, director Hong presents documentarylike images of urban life with a cool detachment from the emotional identiﬁcations common in melodrama. Lee Myung-se presents dreams within dreams, crossing the border between banality and fantasy in Gagman (1988), as well as direct address and the connection of sequences by chapter headings in My Love My Bride (1990).\n\nKorean Cinema after Liberation\n\n25\n\nThe New Wave made Korean ﬁlms more competitive, pushing the evolution of Korean feature ﬁlms. With considerable success, the directors of the movement did not have much difﬁculty in making ﬁlms until the early 1990s. Without sacriﬁcing intelligence or integrity, they could make commercially viable movies while raising serious political and historical issues. Their participation in the industry resulted in an excessive rise in ﬁlm supply. Though it was increasingly difﬁcult for domestic ﬁlms to be screened in Seoul’s ﬁrst-run theaters, despite the screen quota system that reserved 121 days per year for them, the competition forced producers of domestic ﬁlms to make their releases attractive works that audiences wanted to watch, because there was now no way to compensate for the loss. Kang Woo-suk, one of the leading producers as well as a popular director in the 1990s, argues that competition helped improve the quality of domestic ﬁlms (Darlin 81). As a way to get good box ofﬁce results, ﬁlm companies began to invest more money in domestic production. The average production cost per ﬁlm grew yearly from approximately $140,000 in 1984 to $206,086 in 1990 (Kang 46).9 In 1990, For the ﬁrst time more than $1million was invested in the making of three domestic ﬁlms: Southern Communist Guerrillas, The General’s Son (Im Kwontaek), and Mayuni: The Female Terrorist from North Korea (Shin Sang-ok). The producer of The Taebaek Mountains, Lee Tae-won, invested about $4 million in 1994 for the ﬁlm. In the late 1990s, the average production cost per ﬁlm was considered to be more than four times as much as that cost at the beginning of 1990. After the disappearance of barriers on the importation of ﬁlms, the market share of foreign ﬁlms continued to increase from sixty percent in 1981 to a little higher than seventy percent in 1988. Revenues of foreign ﬁlms became more than eighty percent of total box-ofﬁce receipts in 1989 for the ﬁrst time after the 1950s, and rose to around eight-ﬁve percent in the early 1990s. In a desperate situation where foreign ﬁlms took over a sizable portion of total revenues in the ﬁlm market, Korean ﬁlms became more competitive without following the path of low-budget, small-risk production. The market share held by domestic ﬁlms gradually began to grow from around sixteen percent in 1993 to more than twentyﬁve percent in 1997. Also, the number of domestic ﬁlms attracting more than 100,000 admissions in Seoul went from four in 1987 to a yearly average of seven in 1989–1993, eleven in 1996, and thirteen in 1997. This new enthusiasm revived the appeal of domestic ﬁlms as in the best days of the 1960s Golden Age. In the 1980s, domestic ﬁlms were generally ﬁnanced by personal investments from the company owner and funds from regional distributors and, since the late 1980s, partly with money from video companies.\n\n26\n\nSeung Hyun Park\n\nSupplemental money from video companies has given production companies new revenue and a chance to garner income, even when ﬁlms fail to make a proﬁt in the theater. The major ﬁnancial difﬁculty was an inability to solicit production capital from outside investors. As a way to animate the ﬁlm industry, the government transformed the ﬁlm business from a service industry into a manufacturing enterprise in 1993. This created a legal base for Korean producers to ﬁnance ﬁlm production by borrowing from banks. Since that year, however, banks have seldom invested in ﬁlm production as their unfamiliarity with the ﬁlm business makes involvement a kind of speculative enterprise. Filmmakers then attempted to obtain money from well-endowed Korean corporations, some of which own video subsidiaries. These corporations such as Samsung, Daewoo, and Hyundai began to participate in domestic ﬁlms production in the early 1990s. For instance, Samsung Entertainment Group started producing ﬁlms in 1992 with The Marriage Story, a romantic comedy that became a number one box ofﬁce success that year. This company, either partially or entirely, played a role in the production of twenty-two feature ﬁlms between 1992 and 1996. Followed by Samsung, other two corporations, Daewoo and Hyundai, also became involved with the production of domestic ﬁlms. As a result, these three, the largest corporations in Korea, competed for ﬁlm markets, as they did in other economic areas. They never worked together for ﬁlm production. Considering ﬁlm production an attractive business, they just tried to initiate it in a new situation. These corporations ﬁnanced nearly sixty ﬁlms between 1994 and 1996. They became the primary sources for production capital until 1998, when they withdrew from ﬁlm production because of economic crisis resulting from the deﬁciency of foreign currency.10 However, a few ﬁlmmakers have begun to consider ﬁlm export as a crucial revenue source, starting with the success of Why Has Bodhidharma Left for the East? (Bae Yong-kyun 1989) in Japan and The Gingko Bed (Kang Je-kyu 1995) in Hong Kong. The Gingko Bed was the ﬁrst Korean movie to become a big hit in Hong Kong and opened in more than three hundred theaters in China (Koh 51). The total revenue from ﬁlm export was approximately $210,000 in 1995. It grew yearly from approximately $1,700,000 in 1996 to $3,100,000 in 1998 and $6,000,000 in 1999. Shiri (Kang Je-kyu 1999) was the ﬁrst Korean movie to earn more than $1 million from export. The “liberation” of the ﬁlm business also changed the distribution system. Previously, the production companies generally furnished their ﬁlms directly to ﬁrst-run theaters in Seoul and sometimes to those in Busan. Regional distributors circulated domestic and foreign ﬁlms throughout the country, except for the ﬁrst-run theaters in Seoul, mostly provid-\n\nKorean Cinema after Liberation\n\n27\n\nFigure 1.2. A promotional still from the fantasy The Ginko Bed (Kang-Je-kyu 1995). Courtesy Pusan Film Festival.\n\ning advance money, called a “ﬂat fee,” to production companies. Giving a ﬂat fee to producers, regional distributors circulated ﬁlms within a designated area among six divided regions. Some distributors competed in the bounds of a region, but no single distributor circulated ﬁlms over the country as a whole. Big pricing differences existed between domestic and imported movies. In the Honam and Kyungbuk areas, for instance, a foreign ﬁlm earned at least $92,000, whereas domestic ones received a maximum of $16,000 (Lee 1984, 214). This method of distribution allowed the maintenance of stable proﬁts for producers, distributors, and exhibitors.11 In the 1990s, however, these mechanisms were no longer sustained because the number of releases skyrocketed from 107 in 1985 to 470 in 1996. Regional distributors could not afford to take every movie released and in the process changed the pattern of business. They seldom provided producers with advance capital as they had in the 1980s and almost never bought movies before completion. The power of regional distributors was also challenged by Hollywood’s direct distribution, as well as by a crop of new production companies that attempted to seek directdistribution channels throughout the country. Although these companies did not build a ﬁrm base like that of the major Hollywood companies in the 1990s, some of them, along with foreign distribution companies such\n\n28\n\nSeung Hyun Park\n\nas UPI and 20th Century Fox, had already set up their lines in the six largest cities (Lim 59). Thus, the possibility of national distribution chains became more real in the late 1990s. In order to get access to more theaters, domestic companies endeavored to import more foreign ﬁlms, increasing their prices. Korea was evaluated as the second largest importer in the world, buying Hollywood ﬁlms with the most expensive prices in 1996 (Lim 62). Until 1987, the most dominant pattern of distribution involved exclusively opening a ﬁlm in only one theater in each metropolitan city. The government had restricted the number of prints of each ﬁlm to eight, but this was invalidated in 1994 as a result of the trade negotiation with the United States in the mid-1980s. Since the late 1980s, when ﬁlm releases grew to more than three times what they were in the mid-1980s, a day-and-date pattern developed, permitting the simultaneous exhibition of a ﬁlm in two or three big theaters within a single metropolitan area. Film censorship became more lenient, particularly in 1988, after the abolishment of laws requiring censorship of all scripts in the preproduction stage. Isolde Standish notes that Korean cinema was freer to address and interpret social realities through serious representations of political oppression or formerly suppressed working-class culture. The freer social and political atmosphere provided ﬁlmmakers the opportunity to rediscover a type of realism that had disappeared after the emergence of the military regime in 1961, portraying subject matter previously forbidden. Drawing on contemporary society and recent history, Korean ﬁlms featured a wide range of voices within the discourse of social and political change. However, the wave of reform subsided before long; meaningful revisions to previously restrictive legislation on expression began to fade by the end of 1989. The Public Performance Ethics Committee (PPEC)12 continued to impede ﬁlmmaking in the late 1980s and 1990s. It approved the screening of only ﬁfteen uncut ﬁlms among 113 domestic ﬁlms in 1990, ﬁfty-one uncut ﬁlms among 121 domestic ﬁlms in 1991, and forty-ﬁve of ninety-six features in 1992. The stipulations of ﬁlm censorship were legitimated postproduction cuts, contained in Article 13 of the Motion Picture Law, Article 18 of the Enforcement Ordinance of the Motion Picture Law, and Article 6 of the Enforcement Rule. By these stipulations, the PPEC dictated the content of domestic ﬁlms. The stipulations listed in Article 13 were as follows: (1) when a ﬁlm impairs the spirit of the Constitution and the dignity of the state; (2) when a ﬁlm impairs social order and morals; (3) when a ﬁlm impairs friendship between Korea and another country; 4) when a ﬁlm impairs the soundness of the people. Other stipulations also used as the basis of censor-\n\nKorean Cinema after Liberation\n\n29\n\nship included the following: (1) when a ﬁlm insults the president of Korea and shows contempt for the national anthem or ﬂag; (2) when a ﬁlm abets people by depicting antigovernment behavior; (3) when a ﬁlm impairs social order by depicting a riot or genocide; (4) when a ﬁlm vindicates the mistreatment of family members; (5) when a ﬁlm impairs the spirit of the Constitution; (6) when a ﬁlm does not respect judicial authority; (7) when a ﬁlm depicts sexuality lasciviously through using implicit symbols such as music, costume, other performances; (8) when a ﬁlm fosters sexuality through depicting sexual behavior of animals or genitalia; and (9) when a ﬁlm has a vulgar title or dialogue and uses a title unrelated to the content of the ﬁlm. These stipulations were so broad and ambiguous that the censorship committee could interpret each however it wished. Most ﬁlmmakers argue that the government used censorship in order to regulate ﬁlms that contained political critique rather than sensational or violent subject matter. Korean cinema was forbidden to offer sympathetic portrayals of Communists and could not present criticism of government bodies and signiﬁcant political ﬁgures. Censorship prohibited domestic ﬁlms from touching on the same subject matter that it approved in imported ﬁlms such as State of Siege (Costa-Gavras 1973), The Ofﬁcial Story (Luis Puenzo 1985), or Salvador (Oliver Stone 1986). Whereas Koreans could watch foreign experiences of political oppression, they were not allowed to see the political oppression that existed at home. This kind of restraint made audiences consider domestic ﬁlms inferior to foreign ones. In 1997, when the majority of the Korean population adamantly demanded direct presidential elections, the PPEC forced the cutting of forty-four sections of a romance ﬁlm, What Are You Going to Do Tomorrow? (Lee Bong-won 1987). They were especially incensed in regard to a scene between lovers, where the couple’s dialogue was interpreted as antigovernment behavior because it alluded to direct elections. Censors also endowed favored ratings to foreign ﬁlms. Imported ﬁlms received more generous ratings than domestic ones, mostly because the censorship committee was already hypercritical of local products. For example, most foreign action ﬁlms, including Terminator (James Cameron 1984), Terminator 2 (James Cameron 1991), Total Recall (Paul Verhoeven 1990), and the Die Hard series earned an “over 15” rating in Korea, although all of them had R ratings in the United States. Unlike these imported action movies, domestic action ﬁlms, even with a comic approach to the world of gangsters, automatically received an over 18 rating, regardless of violence level. Hollywood ﬁlms such as Indecent Proposal (Adrian Lyne 1993) also received an over 15 rating, although it presented much more graphic sex and female nudity than domestic ﬁlms such as\n\n30\n\nSeung Hyun Park\n\nThat Man, That Woman (Kim Eui-suk 1993) and Corset (Jeong Byung-gak 1996), both rated over 18. The PPEC proclaimed that it would expurgate sexual or violent ﬁlms in order to protect juveniles, hiding its political agenda. It censored movies showing offenses against public authority or the head of the government. The PPEC deleted a scene portraying police torture of the main character in Human Market (Jin Yu-young 1989), in which a hero takes on American soldiers and corrupt Koreans. The PPEC also erased the face of a man in a poster for Rachu (Lee Bong-won 1989) even after previous approval. A politician from the ruling party, who saw the poster in the street, required the face to be erased because it mocked the former president by using an actor who looked like him. This case demonstrates the nature of ﬁlm censorship in Korea where personal decisions of political authorities turned into ofﬁcial guidelines for ﬁlm regulation. Film censorship was ofﬁcially repealed at the end of 1996, when the Supreme Court judged that postproduction cuts are illegal under the Constitution. The invalidation of ﬁlm censorship resulted from the endeavors of the New Wave directors as well as the more recent ﬁlmmakers who made 16mm ﬁlms about contemporary social problems. After being released from prison, they began legal struggles with the censorship committee, submitting petitions to the Supreme Court. After the revocation of forced postproduction cuts, the government transformed the PPEC into the Public Performance Promotion Association (PPPA) in 1997. Although the PPPA does not have the right to cut any part of a ﬁlm, the nature of ﬁlm regulation seems to be unchanged because other stipulations were still effective. In addition to four categories by age, the PPPA can give “no rating” to movies that are considered unﬁt for public screening, a category often used to tame ﬁlmmakers.\n\nConclusion The transformation of the Korean ﬁlm industry since the late 1980s has been viewed a rupture, a crisis so grave that it forced most production companies to abandon many of the practices that had virtually deﬁned ﬁlm production and distribution from the early 1960s. Not only did those companies throw away old business practices, but they also changed trends of ﬁlm production to create more popular domestic ﬁlms, which previously had been considered of low quality. Until the end of 1986, Korean ﬁlms failed to achieve broad acclaim both within and outside of Korea. Owing to the fact that the protectionist policy was politically adulterated, the economic crisis of the industry had affected every area of the industry since the early 1970s. Even though the number of ﬁlms produced was an\n\nKorean Cinema after Liberation\n\n31\n\naverage of more than sixty from 1973 to 1986, Koreans turned their interest away from local products. Most ﬁlms did not attain box-ofﬁce success and critical attention, but producers did not care about this failure because they were able to supplement their losses through their privilege to import foreign ﬁlms. A ﬁlm’s viability as an entertainment product depends, at least in the capitalist context, on its potential to attract a fairly wide audience in the marketplace. The marketplace for Korean ﬁlms did not function as a place where producers competed for ﬁnancing for their ﬁlm projects. State protection and assistance had been considered necessary because of Hollywood’s domination of local markets. However, the period from 1987 to 1997 shows that this continued protection would have been harmful if it had been accompanied by state intervention in production. The introduction of competition involved an active process in which producers and ﬁlmmakers were forced to make movies good enough to attract local people to the theaters, while haggling with distributors and exhibitors in a new relation. During the 1990s, they experimented with various types of ﬁlms through the production of blockbusters and low-budget movies and with diverse subject matter seldom dealt with previously. In a situation where producers could not get government-subsidized funding, the industry started to free itself from political guidelines. Even though censorship had an inﬂuence on what could be seen in public, political authorities no longer played a role in creating propaganda movies favorable to their own political agendas. Furthermore, ﬁlmmakers struggled to present more diverse portraits of life in Korea, whether it was the dark side of Korean society or the representation of social outcasts at the economic or political level. Finally, Korean ﬁlmmakers and companies realized ﬁlm’s value, both as an entertainment commodity and as a medium for symbolic expression. Even though people go to be entertained, it cannot be denied that ﬁlm as a cultural text is a primary arena of social contest in the production of cultural meanings. Dealing with commercial pressure and popular criticism, ﬁlmmakers presented a variety of narrative strategies, struggling to decide what to tell, how to narrate stories, and how to entertain. In a situation where they achieved an unprecedented degree of freedom in dealing with their stories, ﬁlmmakers cultivated the cultural value of Korean cinema through diverse cinematic themes.\n\nNotes 1. General Park Chung-hee carried out a bloodless coup on May 16, 1961. He accused the civilian leadership of being corrupt, incapable of defending the\n\n32\n\nSeung Hyun Park\n\ncountry from internal and external threats of communism, and unable to bring about economic and social transformations. Park once pledged to transfer political power to the civilian sector after the tasks of the revolution had been completed in two years, but he searched for an ideological position that would provide long-term justiﬁcation for his power to extend into the future. Through oppressing democratic claims, Park succeeded in holding political power until 1979, when he was assassinated by his chief aid. 2. Realizing that there was little possibility for him to win the presidential election again through direct election, Park revised the existing constitution and set up the Yushin Constitution to make him “president for life” in 1972. The Yushin Constitution removed the limitations on his presidential terms and empowered him to make political appointments, to nominate one-third of the National Assembly members, and to issue any emergency decree he deemed necessary. It also provided for an indirect election of the president by the locally elected members of the National Conference for Uniﬁcation (NCU). Since most members of the NCU came to the ofﬁce under the inﬂuence of the government, his election was inevitable. The Park regime maintained power by a judicious combination of terror and privilege. The Yushin reforms pervaded almost every social sphere. Under the Emergency Decree on National Security, Park was granted power to ban any disorderly activity, such as student demonstrations and labor strikes. Practically any citizens could be arrested and jailed without a warrant if a public agent suspected them. 3. Gwangju, a city with a population of 1 million, is the capital of Jeolla province, located in the southwestern portion of Korea. Jeolla province was largely excluded from the industrialization process that took place in the 1960s and 1970s under the Park regime. Park Chung-hee, from Kyungsang province, preferred men from his own province and ﬁlled the top political and military posts with them. Chun Doo-hwan, Roh Tae-woo, and most military members who played central roles in helping Chun to take political power in 1979–1980, came from Kyungsang province. Because of already existing regional discrimination, Gwangju citizens became more critical of the emergence of the new hardline military clique, led by Chun. The Gwangju Uprising occurred in the course of General Chun Doo-hwan’s seizure of power in the vacuum situation created by the assassination of President Park. Expanding emergency martial law to the entire nation on May 17, 1980, General Chun shut down the universities, intensiﬁed political censorship of the mass media, and detained most prominent political leaders. The following day, after proclaiming emergency martial law, Special Paratrooper Forces used excessive force to control the people of Gwangju City, where citizens initiated popular demonstrations against the new military regime. Faced by a series of violent civilian-military confrontations, the military ﬁnally crushed this prodemocracy movement on May 27, 1980, killing its own country’s people. Gwangju’s nine-day bloody riot was the most serious domestic uprising in Korea since the Korean War, because citizens had never taken up arms against their government even in the most repressive days of Park Chung-hee. Also, it was the ﬁrst time since the end of the Korean War that Korean troops had turned guns against their own civilians under government order. A variety of contradictory\n\nKorean Cinema after Liberation\n\n33\n\naccounts and analyses of the incident have appeared since 1980, but a day-by-day recounting of the uprising, drawn from previously unpublished eyewitness accounts, contradicts both the ofﬁcial government report and many of the contemporary press accounts. Therefore, the exact number of people who died in the period of the Gwangju Uprising is still unclear. According to the government, 191 people lost their lives during this civil uprising. Other sources report from 300 to 2,000 deaths (Warnberg 46). By this incident most Koreans revealed the emotional disapproval of the Chun government throughout his presidency. Also, the Gwangju Uprising in 1980 has been perceived as a turning point for questioning American roles in Korea. By the end of the 1970s anti-Americanism was virtually invisible, and the Korean people were engrossed with an absolutely positive view of the United States, because of the U.S. role both as protector of Korea in the Cold War confrontation and as its main source of economic aid. However, this image changed at the beginning of the 1980s, because most dissidents in Korea thought the U.S. government to be complicitous in the Gwangju Massacre and to be the active supporter of Chun’s military regime. In the street, therefore, it was common to see antigovernment protesters yelling, “Yankee, Go Home!” throughout the 1980s. On the Gwangju Uprising and its relation to anti-Americanism, see Clark, Cumings, and Jaekyung Lee. 4. Through the revision of the Enforcement Ordinance in the 1970s and 1980s, the government continued to relax the conditions necessary for the maintenance of companies’ licenses. The minimum production number of domestic ﬁlms was ten in 1975; eight in 1976; six in 1978; three in 1979; four in 1981; three in 1985; one in 1986. 5. The Golden Bell Film Festival has been regarded as the most prestigious ﬁlm festival in Korea since 1962, the year when the Park regime organized it to encourage and ﬁnancially reward domestic ﬁlms. 6. The Korean government promulgated the Fifth Amended Motion Picture Law on December 31, 1984, after promising to open the ﬁlm market for direct distribution by Hollywood companies in the next three years. The new, revised ﬁlm law allowed independent ﬁlmmakers to make domestic ﬁlms, but ﬁlm production was not fully liberated in 1985. Production companies not only were compelled to deposit 50 million won at a time when they got a license, but they also had to deposit 10 percent of anticipated production money with the MPPC before shooting a ﬁlm. 7. Chungmuro is a term referring to Korea’s version of Hollywood. 8. Minjung literally denotes ordinary people but becomes a symbolic term for oppressed people. For a discussion of the characteristics of the minjung discourse, see Nancy Abelmann (20–38). 9. It is very difﬁcult to calculate the average cost for the production of ﬁlms in Korea because most companies just make one or two movies per year, and producers are reluctant to give exact ﬁgures because they are related to taxes. Tax evasion seems to be a natural phenomenon for ﬁlm production companies as well as theater owners. In 1996, two powerful people in the ﬁlm industry were jailed for tax evasion and bribery. Koh commented that this might put the entire Korean ﬁlm industry on trial (32–33).\n\n34\n\nSeung Hyun Park\n\n10. Faced by the possibility of national default owing to the deﬁciency of foreign currency, the Korean economy faltered and ﬁnally requested a bailout from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on November 23, 1997. Using a $134 billion U.S. loan borrowed from the IMF in the following year, the newly inaugurated government under Kim Dae-jung helped Korea to recover economic stability and ﬁnally succeeded in repaying every penny to the IMF in September 1999. 11. When the fourth amended ﬁlm law was in effect, producers usually compensated regional distributors’ losses if a ﬁlm did not make an adequate proﬁt. One Korean producer called this operation “faithful behavior.” This was regarded as a natural action before the invalidation of legal regulations on ﬁlm production and importation (Lee 570). 12. Emphasizing the PPEC as a civilian body, the government claimed that it did not control the PPEC. Analyzing the Korean ﬁlm industry in the 1980s, John Lent mentions that the PPEC was “autonomous, even though it was subsidized by the Ministry” (137). Like any other bureaucratic apparatus in Korea, however, the PPEC was operated under the control of the government (Joo 86– 91). The president of the PPEC was selected by the Minister of Culture and Arts. The PPEC was administered by the Ministry of Culture and Arts. It was required to submit its reports on operations to a department in the Ministry of Culture and Arts. Out of eleven members responsible for ﬁlm censorship, four members were public ofﬁcials. As a bureaucratic apparatus, the PPEC was just a body of civil servants who were employed to help administer the affairs of the state. Its duty was to augment ofﬁcial power.\n\nWorks Cited Abelmann, Nancy. Echoes of the Past, Epics of Dissent: A South Korean Social Movement. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996.

The story of a photographer with a terminal illness, the ﬁlm was characterized by its director as a meditation on death in “warm tones.” Eschewing the high drama and suspense of typical melodrama, the ﬁlm sought instead to move audiences with its minute observations of ordinary scenes. In this and other ways the ﬁlm’s style and narrative departed from the traditional formulas employed by local melodramas; nonetheless the ﬁlm proved an enduring popular and critical success. As Korean cinema entered the twenty-ﬁrst century, it was apparent that this ﬁlm’s inﬂuence had helped to transform the aesthetic of contemporary Korean melodrama. Melodrama, in all its various forms, has long been a staple of Korean ﬁlm, and indeed Asian cinema as a whole. Audiences have supported the genre with consistency, while ﬁlm studios have made it a cornerstone of their output, due in part to the low cost of producing such works. Although often undervalued by critics, melodrama has nonetheless contributed to Korean cinema some of its most challenging and unique works,\n\n37\n\n38\n\nDarcy Paquet\n\nFigure 2.1.

Yet even the more simplistic, commercially driven Korean melodramas serve to illustrate some of the deﬁning features of Korean ﬁlms and the societal context in which they are produced. For many viewers, Christmas in August may come across as a moving but uncontroversial portrait of a man grappling with knowledge of his impending death. As the protagonist spends time with family, meets with friends, and prints photographs for customers, the audience sees nothing discordant and little out of the ordinary. Yet it is precisely in its embrace of the ordinary that Christmas in August has proved to be so inﬂuential. For a genre deﬁned in part by hyperbole and the explicit foregrounding of good and evil, Hur’s ﬁlm has provided a soft-spoken challenge.\n\nChristmas in August: An Introduction Christmas in August is the debut work of director/screenwriter Hur Jinho, who had worked previously as an assistant director under Park Kwang-su for such ﬁlms as To the Starry Island (1993) and A Single Spark (1996) and as a co-writer for A Single Spark. Hur locates the inspiration for this ﬁlm in a visit to the funeral of a musician, where the traditional memorial photograph2 featured the deceased in a broad smile. It was\n\nChristmas in August and Korean Melodrama\n\n39\n\nthis juxtaposition between death and happiness that led him to write the screenplay, he said. After completing the screenplay, Hur requested the collaboration of his former teacher at the Korean Academy of Film Arts, cinematographer Yoo Young-kil. The focus of a retrospective at the 1998 Pusan International Film Festival, Yoo had worked extensively in the industry and acquired a reputation for his attention to detail. As cinematographer, Yoo reportedly contributed a great deal to the aesthetics of the ﬁlm, foregrounding the collaborative nature of this work. Yoo passed away shortly after viewing the ﬁnished print, but anecdotal evidence suggests that he was pleased with the outcome. The ﬁlm features two of Korea’s most marketable actors, Han Seokgyu, who had starred in previous box-ofﬁce hits The Gingko Bed (1996) and The Contact (1997), and Shim Eun-ha, who was well known for her roles in television drama. This star power likely inﬂuenced the ﬁlm"
