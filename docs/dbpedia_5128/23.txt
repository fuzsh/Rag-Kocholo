One of the most touching Korean films I have watched is 통증 Pained (2011). I am not the type of person to cry easily to “sad movies” (or jerk and cover my eyes when it comes to horror/torture films), but by the end of this film, my face was glazed in tear juice. The best part was that I couldn’t even control the tears ((O_O)).

This film is directed by Kwak Kyung-taek and tells of a romance between a debt collector who lost his sensitivity to pain in an accident when he was young, Nam-soon, and a homeless hemophiliac who works a street vendor, Dong-hyun.

What I loved about this film was that it developed very nicely- somehow it seemed to move slowly and quickly at the same time. I think Kwak Kyung-taek did a great job pacing this plot, which is very important in a film because if the plot moves too slowly, the movie may come off as boring, and if the plot moves too quickly, the movie may come off as rushed.

Now as I move into specifics of this film, I’m going to have to turn on the….

The film starts with Nam-soon and his boss collecting debt from a couple- when I first watched this, I didn’t understand what was wrong with Nam-soon. He had an empty stare and he seemed fine throughout his beating… which puzzled me. After I learned that he had analgesia- the inability to sense pain- I realized that the beginning of the film, which focused in on his face, was to demonstrate his lack of feeling and emotion. When I found out about Nam-soon’s condition, I felt sadness, but nothing to turn the tears on.

However, despite Nam-soon’s inability to sense pain, we see that change… a little tiny bit when he gets beaten at the riot and is taken to the hospital by Dong-hyun. It was almost painful for me to watch him get beat like a pulp and yet he still had a look of emptiness in his eyes. The scene when he stumbles towards the street and Dong-hyun asks him if he is okay, we are shown a flashback to when young Nam-soon is in a car with his family when their car crashes and burns. In the flashback, we are also shown that as their car swerved off the road, his sister wraps herself around him to protect him. Then the flashback fades to Dong-hyun hovering over him in the street looking for help. This was one of the most powerful scenes in the film because it shows that Nam-soon hasn’t met anyone who has treated him genuinely since his sister passed.

When Dong-hyun moves into Nam-soon’s place (since she is homeless and Nam-soon wants to keep an eye on her until she pays her father’s debt), we are able to peek into Nam-soon’s world. As he shows Dong-hyun around, we see that his house seems almost untouched and untouchable. Basically, Nam-soon preserved the home he had before his family passed away from the crash. And when Dong-hyun accidentally breaks one of his family dishes, we finally see some pain in his eyes. But the pain stays only briefly in his eyes…

About half-way through the movie, Dong-hyun finally expresses her pain at seeing him hurt himself everyday and asks him if he ever thought about what his family would think. But Nam-soon only responds with bitterness and anger. For the first time in the film so far, Nam-soon shows emotion. He no longer appears to be a “piece of wood,” especially when the topic of his family comes up. And the presence of Dong-hyun in his life gave him some emotion…

After the mini fight between Nam-soon and Dong-hyun, Nam-soon’s change becomes bigger and clearer. He tells his boss friend (from the beginning of the movie) that he is no longer interested in hurting himself. Even though he is insensitive to pain, he doesn’t want to abuse his body seriously for other people and money anymore. Rather, he starts taking on stunt jobs and for awhile it seems that he and Dong-hyun are living happily together.

However, Dong-hyun is sick too and her sickness needs constant care and expensive treatment. Because Nam-soon does not have money to support her sickness in order for her to live a long life, Dong-hyun tells Nam-soon that she cannot be with him. With that said, Nam-soon takes on one last dangerous job offered to him by his boss friend so that he can give that money to Dong-hyun so that she can live.

The last scene is the one that made me tear uncontrollably (even as I watched it again just now to evoke the same emotions so I could write about them). Nam-soon is pushed off of a building to his death- as he is sprawled on the ground, he is ironically happy. There is that twinkle of happiness in his eyes and even a smile comes out when Dong-hyun runs over to his side. On her way to try and save Nam-soon, Dong-hyun stepped on a nail and started to bleed (problematic since she is a hemophiliac). However, somehow, she is still okay. Nam-soon, seeing Dong-hyun by his side, is happy and there is a look of completion on his face. While he is losing consciousness, we hear his plead to God to watch over and keep Dong-hyun safe. In turn, he is willing to endure anything, even death, if that is what it will take for Dong-hyun to live a long life.

Throughout this film, Nam-soon never comes off as “the bad guy.” Somehow, I always felt sad when I saw Nam-soon. He never hurt anyone, he couldn’t hurt anyone- that is why he was always the one beaten and he never lifted a finger to defend himself.

His last job- he didn’t defend himself as he was pushed off of the building. And even though most people in his position would be in great pain, he wasn’t at all. However, Dong-hyun and his boss friend were the ones experiencing the pain that he couldn’t feel. His boss friend always gave Nam-soon dangerous jobs, but Nam-soon was also his friend. Seeing that the job he gave Nam-soon killed him put him in great pain. He was also the one who promised Nam-soon that he would be fine and that he would even protect him by parking a truck with boxes where he was supposed to jump. However, the truck broke down and boss friend tried his best to tell Nam-soon not to jump until he could push the truck to its right location. Ultimately, his plan failed when the guy on the roof pushed Nam-soon off on purpose… and the truck wasn’t parked below yet.

*********************************

This is definitely a film I would recommend, especially if you like “meaningful” movies. The title says it all- the film explores all the degrees of pain and what it actually means to feel pain. By the end of the movie, you’ll know what true pain is.

“At the dawn of the millennium, the nation collapsed. At fifteen percent unemployment, ten million were out of work. 800,000 students boycotted school. The adults lost confidence and, fearing the youth, eventually passed the Millennium Educational Reform Act, AKA the BR Act….”

Last night, I finished “Battle Royale,” a movie that I have been waiting for so long to watch. And let me tell you, the wait was worth it. Before seeing this movie, “Noroi” was one of my all-time favorite horror films… but now, I don’t know… “Battle Royale” is right up there with “Noroi.”

Now, if you’ve ever heard of or read William Golding’s Lord of the Flies, the concept of “Battle Royale” is very similar. Basically, Japan is becoming a mess with unemployment and crap, so the adults begin to fear the power of the youth. How to solve this? Well, the government passes an act in which each year, a randomly chosen high school class will be sent to a deserted island to battle it out to survive. Only one winner can be standing at the end of three days.

With that said, you can imagine the blood bath that is created on the island. Even though most of the teenagers feared such an uncivil duty placed upon them, there was that one student that took the task seriously and started it all… all it took was one death for people to get nervous and untrustworthy towards one another. And so friends turned against friends… lovers turned against lovers… etc.

Besides the blood and gore, this film posed some good questions. What will our world become when we do not have the government to protect our stabilization? Can we really trust the people we think we can trust? Are we all savages at heart? Will we return to our natural instincts in times of dire need… such as when our survival is on the line? Who are we? What kind of people are we? These are definitely things to think about, especially since our economy dipped this past year. Sure the world was not in panic, but what would have happened if we did get to that level? And of course, this movie made me think twice about the people that I think I know. Other circumstances have already made me lose trust in people in general… but I still questioned whether I knew the people around me as well as I think I do. I mean, do I really know who my enemies are? Do YOU know who your true enemies are? And what about your comrades?

The point is, this movie isn’t just your typical horror film (as with most Asian horror movies). Rather, there are deeper questions and meanings that lie within the film itself. Essentially, this is what I enjoy most about Asian horror movies. But I specifically choose this as one of my favorites because of how well the plot is formulated and quite frankly, it relates to me and my generation.

So that I don’t leave you completely horrified and fearful of your peers, let me entertain you with some funny things I found about this film. First and foremost, I thought it was quite funny how every person who died would say their last words and then flop like a dead fish almost as quickly as I can blink my eye. Just think about it, if someone turned to you while blood was pouring out of them like the Niagara Falls, and said “I love you,” and then flopped the next moment… wouldn’t you giggle a little bit at the unnaturalness of it all? Maybe so, maybe not… but I would. And secondly, there is one scene where this one girl chases this guy who threatens to kill her if she doesn’t have sex with him. When she finally gets him, she takes her knife and stabs at his crotch so many times that I cannot count on both of my hands. She twists and jabs and whatnot… Talk about a cockblock… ㅋㅋㅋ

In essence, this movie is definitely one that you should watch… but if you get sick from seeing blood, don’t watch this. There will be scenes in which blood squirts like a summer sprinkler. 😦 for you 🙂 for me. Just remember, “Life is a game. So fight for it and see if you’re worth it.”

Let’s see how you digest this: bottles and bottles of formaldehyde + river water = mutant creature! Yes, you are probably thinking the same thing as me, “what the f*ck?!”

So here’s how it all went down…

Last night, I was searching up Jang Jin-young and wikipedia led me from one thing to another. Eventually, I found myself looking at the page for a South Korean monster film, The Host. I saw that the director of the film was the same guy who directed Memories of Murder, which may I add, was a very good movie. Roughly scanning the plot line, I figured I could give this movie a shot. In summary, this movie is about two scientists who decide to pour many (I mean, A LOT OF) bottles of formaldehyde down the drain, which is connected to the Han River. Two years later, the movie pans to two people in the river who discover a mutant creature. Four years later, some guy wants to jump off a bridge and before he commits suicide, he mentions that something big and dark is under the water. Finally, in the present, there’s this family who owns this snack bar and one day this giant mutant creature jumps on land and either eats people on the spot or grabs them with his (?) tail and dumps them in a sewer for later (possibly dessert?). One of the people it grabs happens to be the snack bar family’s daughter. And so they begin a quest to find this creature and their daughter. Meanwhile, the government flips out and thinks the mutant carries a deadly virus.

With all of this confusion and mutant-ness, the movie is simply another science-fiction film. I’ll be blunt: this movie was a waste of my time. There was no “meat” in the plot. And I would have liked the film to have been slightly more realistic… come on… formaldehyde can turn into a mutant creature? The Human Centipede did better in the science film department. -_-

However, despite the fact that the plot was boring, repetitive, and unrealistically foolish, the graphics in this film are applaudable. It must have taken much effort and money to create the mutant creature thing and make it hop all over the place. Plus, that thing had a killer tail that whipped all over the place. So, I’ll give the film some credit in the graphics department. But that’s as far as it goes… well, and the drunk guy is pretty cute (Park Hae-il is the actor).

This film did receive good reception when it was first released, made it to several critics’ top ten list for best films of 2007, and was nominated for (even won!) several awards. Expect a sequel and an American remake. So, you decide for yourself if you want to watch this one, or skip it.

I couldn’t take it anymore… I had to watch a horror film. It had felt like years since I watched ノロイNoroi… so I went on a quest for a good, solid horror movie. The result? I found a Taiwanese slasher flick called 绝命派对 Invitation Only (2009) by Kevin Ko. Little did I expect the Taiwanese to produce such gore and blood- my original intention was a Japanese or Korean horror film. But I saw the Taiwanese flag next to the film name and I scratched my head. The link led me to the film page and it said that it was billed “Taiwan’s First-Ever Slasher Horror.” Indeed I was curious.

The plot is as follows:

There is this big event planned for the rich and famous. 5 of the people who attend happen to be invited by their rich bosses. An evening of fun and living the high life turns deadly when they find themselves as torture toys for the rich- their pain and agony is part of the evening’s scheduled shows.

As you can see, the plot is very basic… similar to most horror/slasher films such as “I Know What You Did Last Summer”, “Final Destination”, “Prom Night”, “Cabin Fever”, etc. However, this movie is a big deal because it is pretty damn good for the Taiwanese to be able to produce such a realistically gory film as this one. It’s their FIRST ever slasher film! The Japanese and Korean had to have a starting point for their horror films… and now they’ve escalated to great works. I’m hoping the Taiwanese can now improve and move onto more horror films. This one was typical, so maybe the next one can be more original? hehehe~

Some notable scenes…

The first scene was kind of irrelevant to the movie if you ask me. It gave me a little hint as to what was ahead, but I guess it was what happened at the party the previous year? Nonetheless, it gave me the heebie jeebies… especially when the girl drops the purse and a head rolls out. O.O

The most gruesome gore from this movie HAS TO BE the torture scenes. There’s nothing like old-fashioned poking and prodding with sharp objects in front of an audience.

There are 2 major torture scenes that are just… incredible. Not so much in the sense that people are being killed in an inhumane way, but more like the thought that humans even came up with such techniques of killing.

The scene of the woman in the purple dress being tortured is just painful to watch. First she gets paralyzed with some chemical so that she can’t move a muscle while feeling all that pain. Then she gets parts of her cheek cut out… stuffed with salt crystals… and to top it all, a cloth is stapled over her face. Can you even imagine the pain of it all????????

And the next one, even worse than the girl in purple, is the torture of the insecure man. I may not be a man, but I have a good idea how much getting clipped in the nuts can hurt. Even before we watch the actual torture scene, we see that this man already has fingers cut off… a swollen grapefruit of an eye… and he’s as dirty as ever. Then we are introduced to the torture he will be receiving… which is demonstrated on a mouse/rat thing. Some clip is attached to the mouse/rat and on the other end of the wire is some electrifying thing that sends electricity to the other end and fries the object. And so the guy proceeds to attach the clipper end to the insecure guy’s nuts. Of course, the insecure guy is flipping out because his nuts are going to get clipped, so he freaks out and starts to hop around while still being chained to the metal post. Then… the inevitable… the guy clips it! And damn is it gross. The nuts area starts to pool with blood and I’m about to puke from watching it happen… but they rip off the tape on the insecure guy’s mouth and he spits out a mouthful of brownish puke! So sickened… there’s more: the electrifying part. I shall not go into details… but the result is a fried nut and a dead man.

Other gross scenes include when the guy, Wade, hides under a tarp of some sort and turns his face and sees the girl he was with earlier that night… except now she’s decapitated. The scene is kind of dark… but whatever, I caught a glimpse. >.<

And the last noteworthy scene is the one where Wade is cutting his own thumb off with a plier in order to slip his hand out of the cuffs and escape. Yea, just take a moment to process how that feels…

Aside from just blood and gore… this movie did have a point. A statement was being made about the rich and the poor. “The rich will always get what they want and can get away with anything… on the other hand, the poor will always be losers.”

For all of you who haven’t watched 無間道 Infernal Affairs, GO WATCH IT NOW!

Ehem. Before you think I’m crazy and demanding and decide to stop reading this, just take a moment and let me explain myself.

You see, I just finished watching Infernal Affairs for the 3rd TIME. Yes, that’s right, the 3rd. Usually, I watch something once and never watch it again because I know what is going to happen. But for Infernal Affairs, I felt the need to watch it yet a 3rd time. Sometimes, like right now, I wonder why I am so attracted to this movie. I mean, it’s even out of line with all the other movies I watch. O right, for those of you who don’t know what this movie is about, the plot revolves around 2 people: Inspector Lau and Yan (they’re moles). Lau is a triad member who is placed in the police department as a mole. On the other hand, Yan is a undercover cop placed in the very triad that Lau is in as a mole. A major theme of this movie is loyalty and betrayal, which is played out by these 2 characters. That’s all I’ll say about the plot because I don’t want to spoil the ending for those of you who haven’t watched it yet.

Anyways, this plot is so brilliant, in addition to the great acting of Andy Lau and Tony Leung. I have to say, Tony Leung does a great job as a druggie, triad member. In the movie I saw prior to this one, Tony played a pervvy old man in Lust, Caution. But that’s beside the point. I just love everything about this movie, including the soundtrack! The only thing I’m disappointed in is the 2nd and 3rd installment of the film. I’ve only watched those once and they explained some background information to me, but I felt it was kind of unnecessary. Like the always say, the first ones are always better than the sequels.

If you love crime, gang, action, etc. films, this is the movie for you. So go watch it and be like me: an addict that will watch this over and over again. With that said, I plan to watch Infernal Affairs for a 4th time sometime soon. 😉

*Note: I even made a music video for this film. I worked very hard to make this music video, so please watch, enjoy, and comment!*

EEK! For the past few days, I’ve been catching up with my horror movies, so my apologies for not blogging as much. 😦

So during that interim, I had the pleasure of watching South Korean horror movies (and I mean these ACTUALLY scared me!). You see, the only South Korean horror movie that I watched before was Tale of Two Sisters, which honestly had no effect on me. Sure, it was creepy as hell and freaked me out a little, but other than that, did not really scare me. I don’t think I would even really consider that horror in my eyes, but whatever… I don’t even get how it’s one of the best SK horrors out there.

Anyways, for the past 3 days, I had the chance to watch 2 great SK horror movies that really changed my mind about, well, korean horror. And here comes my rant again! Hehehe should be fun, I swear! And just as a note, I don’t intend to offend anyone with what I say. If you find it offensive, then simply don’t read it because I will express what I feel on my blog. Thanks 🙂

☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆ SPOILER ALERT ☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆☆

The Doll Master

The first of the two I watched was The Doll Master (인형사). As you can see from the movie poster, it was one scary movie! The whole movie got me jittery about dolls. Honestly, there is nothing freakier than having a human-taken-over-by-a-doll get revenge by chasing you around! *shivers* Throughout the movie, there was a constant reference to the dolls’ eyes and how dolls can feel emotion as well. If you think about it, that’s weird… Could it be true??? Dolls are made to look as human as possible, so…. I don’t know… the concept creeped me out. Although the ending was a little weird to me, I found this extremely spine tingling and bloody! YES! This movie was absolutely gory near the end. But back to the weird thing? Right. The ending was kind of weird because that doll that the girl didn’t recognize at first actually backed off once she remembered that the girl did love and protect her once awhile ago. Personally, this made me think “say what?” because apparently now, dolls could have memories AND emotions! Weird. I know. What’s more, they threw in the woman who was possessed by the doll’s spirit! This movie definitely made me glad that I was never that close to my dolls when I was a kid. Good thing my mom didn’t really let me play with dolls and talk to them like an imaginary friend! And she stored that doll from China away! ‘Cause if she didn’t, I would’ve played with that doll A LOT and it looked like a ball-jointed doll. (Thanks Mom). Whatever, really weird (I know, I’m using the word yet again but it describes this movie really well!) movie, if you enjoy gory and eery movies, totally watch this one. Worth your time AND money, although I watched it off the internet…

*****************

The Wig

One of THE scariest SK horrors you will ever watch! And I’m dead serious. The Wig (가발) is not joke… Yet the ending was sad and touching as well. So I’ll start from the beginning. From the beginning, I felt like the director really made a good setting because I felt scared and lonely in the darkness and quietness of the room. And since the older sister could not talk, it just added to the scariness! The lack of sound almost created a hollow noise in the background for the movie. And I bet you guys know what I’m talking about; that silence is the creepiest thing you can possibly hear! Even freakier was the wig itself. OMGZZZZ it was so scary when the wig was placed on the rack but when the younger sister came back into the room, it was on the floor back where it originally was! That’s just freaky, when a wig (lifeless object like the dolls) can suddenly hold human qualities, and MOVE!!!!! Ewwww I was shivering the whole movie whenever I saw the wig. The only part I didn’t really like was the history of the wig. Apparently, this ghost wanted to be back with his lover, so it was like a Brokeback Mountain sort of a thing… Not the ideal history of why the wig was haunted. If you ask me, it kind of ruined the spookiness of the movie (and the wig). And seriously, the guy didn’t even look like a guy! But whatever, that’s irrelevant I guess… 😦 However, this movie had an amazing ending. As it turns out, the older sister killed her younger sister for nothing. The damn wig had nothing to do with her appearance change! So, the wig just made the poor girl hot for her older sister’s boyfriend. I kind of like the twist here because in a way, it was psychological for the older sister. And jeezzz, she’s really screwed because now her ex-bf’s dead and her younger sister is dead as well… It would really suck to be her… she should be the one saying “FML” not silly teenagers who have to do homework. Anywayzzz, the touching ending really hit it off with me. I loved this movie. Totally recommend it for you gals and guys. 🙂 I hope to watch more SK movies in the future that are just as creepy….

P.S. I’ve never been so afraid of hair in my life! -O-

Okay, so I just finished a really scary J-Horror movie, called Carved, aka Slit-Mouthed Woman. It creeped me out more than Audition. I think that says something. Simply put, Audition is seriously one of THE scariest movies floating out there. And if Carved can beat that, then doesn’t it say something about the movie? Hahahha…. I’m still all jittery from this movie.

******************************

SPOILER ALERT

******************************

I especially adore this ending! I love how the Slit-Mouthed Woman just doesn’t die! You see her son go through hell just to kill her (and he even dies), yet, the freaking woman is still alive! Omgzzzz… I guess it’s true what they said in the movie, “She can’t be killed”. But it makes me wonder, why????? Didn’t her son kill her and stick her in the closet? How is she able to not die and still roam the earth. I mean, if she’s a ghost, then people wouldn’t be able to see her. And if she’s human, how is she getting her food to survive? But then if you think about it, she MUST have died because no one was available to save her (or so I think) and she would’ve bled to death from the stab wounds! *shakes head* I guess I can’t think too much about it. After all, it’s just a movie. So, just enjoy the plot, eh? And I just have to say, she’s one freaky woman. She can, like, exchange bodies with someone else just to survive. I kind of wish that the movie furthered into what was wrong with her that made her cough so much and go insane enough to hit (and eventually kill) her children. And what about the children’s father? Ewwww….. I know this is gross, but WHO on earth would want to mate with that thing???? Come on, I know what you’re thinking, but those children came from somewhere! Anyways, this was a lovely horror movie. One of my favorites! YEEEEEE~~~ Glad it’s one that I didn’t waste my time on! Hahaha… Well, I thought I’d just share this with you. My afterthoughts on the movie, I mean. I highly suggest you watch this movie, if you haven’t already, only if you’re not grossed out by blood and stuff. Because this movie is actually pretty graphic in some parts. So be prepared!

Heheheh… sorry, I just had to… 🙂
