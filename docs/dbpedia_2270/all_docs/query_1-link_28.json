        "text": "http://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Richards-3506\n\nBorn in Franklin, Virginia, USA on May 1827 to Christopher Richards and Nancy Moore. Clarissa married James Henry Williams and had 2 children. She passed away on 1910 in Virginia, USA. http://records.ancestry.com/Clarissa_Betty_Richards_records.ashx?pi...\n\nBetty's husband was a professional gambler and was in the Civil War and died as prisoner of war June 1, 1862. After Betty's husband and five of her brothers died during the Civil War, Clarissa hid one of her boys in a cave, to keep him from being drafted or caught and hanged by the \"Home Guard.\" Sometimes Isabelle would go with her to take him food. They would walk down a stream bed, so they couldn't be tracked. After the war, Clarissa went with her daughter and son-in-law, who was a minister, to Bluefield, West Virginia. She owned a large amount of land in Franklin County, bought with her husband's gambling winnings (but we have not yet located the land records). In 1910 at age 85, she was living with her son Noah H. \"Hank\" Williams in Montgomery County, Virginia. *\n\nThis is taken from the book of John Marchel Reed and Anne Cora Nichols Reed by Nancy Mae Little Randers-Pehrson and Glenn Randers-Pherson\n\nhttp://www.hodges-hodge-society.org/db/getperson.php?personID=I466&..."
