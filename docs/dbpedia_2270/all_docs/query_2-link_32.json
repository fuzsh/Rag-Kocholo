        "text": "The Senior Capstone is a 2-semester, 6-credit, mentored, interdisciplinary experience that spans both semesters of the senior year. It is the culmination of the undergraduate experience in Global Public Health. Working individually or in teams, students have the opportunity to design a project that tackles a real-world problem in global public health. Students have several options for completing the Capstone:\n\nOption 1: Students may produce a scholarly, scientific report of publishable quality on a topic in public health. The outcome may be a report, a manuscript suitable for publication in a peer-reviewed journal, or a poster suitable for presentation at a regional or national professional meeting.\n\nOption 2: Students may develop a video, computer app, or other innovation that addresses a public health issue. To support the innovation, students will prepare a portfolio that includes a concise written summary of the problem, explains how the innovation addresses the problem, and includes other key materials such as a marketing plan or a media strategy.\n\nOption 3: Students may complete a yearlong, community-based engagement project on an issue relevant to public health in partnership with a community group, an NGO, a government agency, or a consulting firm. The product will include the partnered work itself, often in the form of an internship, and the creation of at least one product that serves the partner, e.g. an analysis of community issues, a database of resources, or a new training module."
