        "text": "What Clients Have to Say\n\nThe Rules of Professional Conduct require disclosure that this is a “Testimonial” about the attorney. Please be aware that any result achieved on behalf of one client in one matter does not necessarily indicate similar results can be obtained for other clients.\n\nA Very Talented Attorney.\n\nI was charged with possession of cocaine and public intoxication. Susan was able to gt the public intoxication down to a $300.00 fine. She got the possession of cocaine charge totally dropped. I was absolutely impressed with her work. I strongly recommend her.\n\n– Anonymous, Client\n\nSusan Turned My Life Around!\n\nSusan made me feel comfortable during our very first meeting. I didn’t feel rushed; she talked to me and listened to my concerns. Susan knows the laws and is very knowledgeable about how the court systems work. She couldn’t promise me anything but assured me she would work hard on my case. Did she? Yes, she did. I’m really grateful and thankful for her representing me. Thank you doesn’t say enough for all she did for me.\n\n– Andrew, Client\n\nProfessionalism Unmatched & Unparalleled\n\nMs. William’s level of professionalism is unmatched and unparalleled.

I had no worry or concern that my legal needs would be met with fast and professional results.\n\nI am very satisfied with the services required and the professional manner that was executed.\n\nThank you so much and may the Lord bless your work for others always.\n\n– Darren, Client\n\nA Diamond among the Rough\n\nThere are times in life when a woman requires the advice, counsel and assistanc of another woman. One of those times occurred earlier this year and Susan E. Williams, Esq. provided me with both understanding and an acute legal mind. My husband and I were very fortunate to have Susan’s representation.\n\nOur culture may not have the highest regard for the legal professional but do not judge Ms. Williams by Esp., judge her for the caring individual that lies beneath this fighter for her client’s rights. As a former judge, Ms. Williams is extremely knowledgeable and experienced in the nuances of South Carolina’s legal system.\n\nMy husband and I recommend Ms. Williams without hesitation.\n\n– D.M., Client\n\n“Excellent representation! Very thorough with all aspects of case. Easy to talk to and explained the details of each plan of action and outcome of case. Even when the case was over, Susan made sure everything was in order and acceptable. Outstanding lawyer! Would recommend Susan Williams to anyone in South Carolina that needs a professional and dependable lawyer!”\n\n– Christopher Nelson, Client\n\nPlease put me in your “$1,000” percent file.\n\n– Sandi Berman, Client\n\nAmazing Performance & Unbelievable Outcome! She is an amazing attorney and would never hire anyone else.\n\n– Dallas Massad, Client\n\nShe’s the only one I’ll hire. I’m grateful to have her as an attorney. This is the second time I’ve hired her as my attorney.\n\n– A.M., Client\n\nRecently, I had the needs to hire an attorney, and Mrs. Williams was the attorney my company directed me to. Five minutes into our initial phone conversation, followed by an immediate face-to-face meeting, I never felt more like this was the person I was supposed to work with. Mrs Williams exhibited a sincere professionalism, caring nature, and willingness to LISTEN unlike I have ever experienced before. These are the qualities I look for in people I need to work with, and Mrs Williams exhibited them all, and much more, immediately. When we decided she would be able to help, from that second on her work ethic and communication was impeccable. Between her and her staff, I have been kept informed of all steps needed to represent my best interests and I would highly recommend this wonderful attorney without pause. She has certainly made me feel like someone whose situation mattered, and my family felt the same way. I just cannot say enough. Outstanding in every way, I pray to see this young lady become all that she aspires to be. The world will be a better place. And before this seems like a “halo” review, I used to have to write performance reports for a living. This is the type of person I always wished everyone knew about. She makes a difference. She is that good. Period.\n\n– Douglas, Client\n\nI have always been happy with Susan from start to end. She has always been open for anything I needed. She is very professional and is always honest and upfront with you. I am thankful to have her on my side.\n\n– Wanda, Client\n\nAfter reading the previous reviews I decided to give attorney Williams a call to explain my case. She was calm and understanding. Attorney Williams gave me 100% detailed information. Even though I had doubts, her word was her bond. I give 5 stars to Susan Williams any day.\n\n– TH, Client\n\nMrs. Williams went above and beyond to keep well informed of my case. She put forth her best performance with very little time.

She is very knowledgeable on matters requiring local expertise and understanding of the dynamics of local court personalities and processes. I recommend her services and would hire her again.\n\n– YD, Client\n\nGod sends angles in different forms for our family and Susan Williams was one of them. Not only was Susan well versed in law, she was also supportive, caring, and understanding. Susan was driven to prove me innocent in my DUI case. So driven that we never had a jury trial as her opening statement was so strong, the case was dismissed.\n\nThe first time I hired Susan she successfully plea bargained for me and I was able to have my record expunged for a criminal domestic violence case. She truly believes in her clients and will fight for them. I would never hire another lawyer again.\n\n– KM, Client\n\nI have been represented by Mrs. Williams two times. Both occasions were very professional. She gave me great advice during my cases on the best course of action that should be taken. I am very satisfied with her services.

Great experience, great response, and all around professionalism!\n\n– DB, Client\n\nDear Susan: Thank you again so much for providing us with such excellent legal service during a very trying and stressful period in our lives.

I couldn’t be happier.\n\n– Marley LaBombard, Client\n\nSusan is a go getter and got my case dismissed due to her knowledge of laws I had no idea existed.

She agreed to stay at the courthouse late into the night and was ultimately able to secure a dismisal.\n\nThank you, Susan, for everything you did to take care of me and my case!!!\n\n– Geoff, Client\n\nMs. Williams did an exemplary job representing our grandson.\n\nThe juvenile justice process is very complicated system. One that Ms. Williams helped us navigate by providing us clear insight to the solicitor’s role, and the court’s.\n\nShe didn’t make promises she couldn’t keep. The old adage “”hope for the best but prepare for the worst”” comes to mind.\n\nIt was evident that she kept our grandson’s best interest in mind, while representing him and the negotiations she made for him.\n\nShe is patient and understanding of the emotional state of the families and educates them how to best navigate through the juvenile justice system.\n\nHad our final outcome been different, I could still say she provided excellent legal services for our grandson and supported his parents in an exemplary manner.\n\n– Sharron, Client\n\nMrs. Williams was very knowledgeable regarding the juvenile justice system.
