        "text": "Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition that impacts two of every 1000 youth in the United States (Liese et al., 2006). The complex, demanding regimen for diabetes self-care requires frequent blood glucose (BG) monitoring and management of insulin, nutritional intake, and physical activity (Silverstein et al., 2005). Common declines in adolescents’ self-care and disease control (Helgeson, Siminerio, Escobar, & Becker, 2009; Luyckx, Seiffge-Krenke, & Hampson, 2010) elevate the risk for complications, lead to greater healthcare utilization, and result in higher medical costs (Menzin, Langley-Hawthorne, Friedman, Boulanger, & Cavanaugh, 2001; Wagner et al., 2001).\n\nIdeally, youth with diabetes and their parents complete diabetes management jointly (Anderson, 2004; Silverstein et al., 2005), and family interactions related to diabetes can impact youths’ diabetes self-care and glycemic outcomes (Anderson, Ho, Brackett, Finkelstein, & Laffel, 1997). Parental involvement in diabetes management can take the form of parental responsibility, in which parents complete particular tasks for youth, or of parental monitoring, in which parents supervise youths’ independent completion of self-care tasks. Both forms of involvement are associated with better glycemic control via their beneficial impact on adolescents’ self-care (Anderson et al., 1997; Ellis et al., 2007). In early adolescence, increasing autonomy is typical (Beyers, Goossens, Vansant, & Moors, 2003) and parents’ expectations for teens’ diabetes self-care tend to increase while their direct participation in diabetes management often decreases (Palmer et al., 2004; Wysocki et al., 1996). During this period, parental involvement may begin to transition from responsibility to monitoring. The shift in disease management responsibility from parents to youth is one factor associated with the common deterioration in diabetes outcomes in adolescence (Holmes et al., 2006; Grey, Boland, Yu, Sullivan-Bolyai, & Tamborlane, 1998; Palmer et al., 2004), although greater parental monitoring appears to minimize this risk (Ellis et al., 2007).\n\nConflict between teens and their parents about diabetes is another factor associated with worsening diabetes outcomes in adolescence. Diabetes-related conflict is of significant concern given that even minimally elevated conflict can negatively impact glycemic control (Hood, Anderson, Butler, & Laffel, 2007), in part by detracting from diabetes self-care (Hilliard, Guilfoyle, Dolan, & Hood, 2011). For example, some adolescents who are distressed, angry, or frustrated about family conflict may be less inclined or less able to complete diabetes tasks. Others might limit their completion of diabetes self-care tasks to avoid arguments (e.g., related to BG values).\n\nWhile previous studies have identified family conflict and lower parental monitoring as independent risk factors for suboptimal self-care and ultimately poorer glycemic outcomes (Ellis et al., 2007; Hilliard et al., 2011), it remains unclear how these two important family characteristics are related to one another in the context of diabetes management and glycemic control. There are likely reciprocal relations between them, such that the amount and nature of parental monitoring may impact family conflict, and family conflict may impact how much and in what ways parents are involved in adolescents’ daily diabetes self-care.\n\nGreater parental responsibility for and monitoring of diabetes self-care often are encouraged to improve adolescents’ diabetes management and glycemic outcomes (Anderson et al., 1997; Ellis et al., 2007). Yet, clinically it is apparent that some aspects of parent involvement in adolescents’ diabetes self-care, including parental monitoring, may inadvertently foster conflict. For example, frequent reminders or questions about diabetes self-care might irritate teens and lead to or exacerbate conflict. Among youth without diabetes, those with more family conflict want less parental supervision (Laird, Pettit, Dodge, & Bates, 2003) and this preference likely is mirrored in teens with diabetes, who often want less frequent or less intrusive parental involvement in their diabetes self-care (Hanna & Guthrie, 2001; Weinger, O’Donnell, & Ritholz, 2001).\n\nConflict also may detract from diabetes management and glycemic control through its impact on the amount and ways that parents participate in their adolescents’ self-care (Weinger et al., 2001). For example, in order to avoid conflict some parents might decrease their monitoring or oversight of diabetes management (Palmer et al., 2004). Parents who argue frequently with their teens about diabetes may refrain from asking questions or be hesitant to offer assistance with diabetes tasks. Other parents may increase or become more persistent in their monitoring to ensure their teens follow directions. Additionally, adolescents themselves may avoid discussions about diabetes with their parents as a means to avoid conflict. Any of these scenarios could detract from self-care and negatively impact glycemic control.\n\nGiven the developmentally normative changes in parent-youth relationships at the entry to adolescence and their potential impact on diabetes self-care and glycemic control, a better understanding of how family conflict and parental monitoring relate to each other and to diabetes self-care and glycemic outcomes is valuable. Thus, this paper aims to examine the associations among family conflict, parental monitoring, diabetes self-care, and glycemic control. More family conflict and less parental monitoring were hypothesized to be correlated and to each have a direct association with poorer glycemic control. Given previous evidence of self-care as a mediator of the separate relations of parental monitoring (Ellis et al., 2007) and family conflict (Hilliard et al., 2011) with glycemic control, poorer self-care was hypothesized to mediate these associations. Confirmation of this model would indicate that interventions to improve adolescents’ glycemic control should address multiple aspects of the parent-adolescent relationship related to diabetes and directly address teens’ diabetes self-care behaviors.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nParental monitoring was inversely related to family conflict, and diabetes self-care mediated the associations of each of these key family constructs with glycemic control in early adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Family conflict also demonstrated a direct association with poorer glycemic control. While each of these links is consistent with previous research (Anderson et al., 1997; Ellis et al., 2007; Hilliard et al., 2011), this study is the first to examine how these two important family factors simultaneously relate to one another and to diabetes management and glycemic control. This constellation of associations among family conflict, parental monitoring, diabetes self-care, and glycemic control suggests that examinations of either family factor in isolation may be too narrow to fully understand the multidimensional relations that exist among family interactions and adolescents’ diabetes outcomes.\n\nSimultaneous examination of parental monitoring and conflict revealed an inverse relation between these variables with sizable common variance (β = −0.23). In this early adolescent age range, elevations in conflict do not appear to co-occur with more parental monitoring. Prevention and intervention programs may be able to capitalize on the relatively low levels of conflict accompanying parental monitoring in early adolescence by encouraging parental monitoring without necessarily increasing the risk for conflict. Promotion of parental monitoring in early adolescence has the potential to set the stage for ongoing parental monitoring later, with the goal of preventing both conflict and deterioration in diabetes outcomes in older adolescence.\n\nThe model also revealed unique indirect relations of parental monitoring and family conflict with glycemic control through diabetes self-care. The standardized effect size of the direct association between parental monitoring and self-care is small (β = −0.39) yet roughly double that of family conflict (β = −0.19). Thus, the beneficial role of parental monitoring may outweigh the risks associated with conflict in direct relation to diabetes self-care. In addition to associations with self-care, these data model and measure the associations of each latent construct with glycemic control. Family conflict demonstrated both direct (β = 0.31) and indirect links with glycemic control through self-care (total indirect effect = 0.07). Parental monitoring demonstrated an indirect association with glycemic control through self-care (total indirect effect = 0.13), yet there was no evidence of a significant direct relation. While parental monitoring displays a stronger direct link with diabetes self-care than does family conflict, family conflict displays a relatively stronger direct association with glycemic control. The distinct associations of parental monitoring and family conflict with diabetes self-care and glycemic control indicate that both factors have unique yet interrelated roles in the context of diabetes outcomes.\n\nThe relations among family factors, diabetes self-care, and glycemic control reported in this study were evident even at relatively low levels of conflict and relatively high levels of parental monitoring, with scores at the lower (diabetes-related family conflict; range: 19–95) and upper (parental monitoring; range: 18–90) ends of the measures’ possible ranges, similar to other samples (Ellis et al., 2007; Hood et al., 2007). The effect sizes in this study were modest and the associations may be even more pronounced in samples that report higher levels of conflict, less frequent parental monitoring, or with youth in poorer glycemic control.\n\nIn addition to parental monitoring and diabetes self-care, other factors beyond these primary constructs may mediate or impact the direct relation between family conflict and glycemic control. Although unmeasured in this study, previous research suggests that youth without diabetes exposed to family conflict report more emotional difficulties, such as stress and depression, and exhibit physiologic signs of stress (Repetti, Taylor, & Seeman, 2002), all of which are risk factors with implications for glycemic control (Golden, 2007; Grey, Whittemore, & Tamborlane, 2002; Lloyd, Smith, & Weinger, 2005). For some families, conflict also may occur in response to higher A1c values due to assumptions about mismanagement (Weinger et al., 2001) or as the result of behavior problems related to chronically higher BG levels (Holmes et al., 2006). Longitudinal analyses are needed to investigate potential causal or bidirectional pathways among family conflict, mediating processes, and diabetes outcomes.\n\nDemographic and medical variables also should be considered in the context of study constructs. Parental monitoring was inversely associated with youth age, consistent with previous literature (Holmes et al., 2006; Palmer et al., 2004), and was linked with gender, which has not been reported previously. Multiple factors likely influence the degree to which parents maintain their level of monitoring as their children progress through adolescence. Older teens typically require less assistance with diabetes self-care tasks and they and their parents may perceive less need for oversight. Older adolescents also may complete more of their diabetes self-care away from home, which poses a different challenge for parental monitoring (Hanna & Decker, 2010; Palmer et al., 2004; Palmer et al., 2010). Prior literature demonstrates fewer behavior problems and better diabetes self-care in girls than boys (Naar-King et al., 2006) which may contribute to this study’s finding of lower parental monitoring of girls, since parents of adolescent girls may perceive less need for close monitoring.\n\nLower SES and non-Caucasian ethnicity were associated with higher conflict, and non-Caucasian ethnicity was associated with poorer self-care. These demographic variables often co-occur and may represent a combination of limited access to resources and other barriers to diabetes self-care (Swift, Chen, Hershberger, & Holmes, 2006), worthy of examination yet beyond the scope of this investigation. In some situations, intensive programs that target multiple aspects of the family system may be necessary to efficaciously impact the various factors related to diabetes self-care and glycemic control (Ellis et al., 2005; Wysocki et al., 2008).\n\nFinally, youth with more intensive insulin regimens engaged in more frequent BG checks and reported better overall self-care. This favorable association may reflect clinic practices to transition youth with better diabetes self-care to more intensive basal bolus insulin injections or pump regimens. Although not measured in this study, better self-care among youth on the insulin pump also may be attributable in part to reduced barriers to self-care; for example, youth on the insulin pump report perceptions of greater convenience and flexibility (Ritholz et al., 2007) despite the visibility of the device and diligence needed to operate it.\n\nIn addition to the conceptual contributions of this study, the methodological strengths also represent an expansion of previous research. The use of latent variables and structural equation modeling accounted for the simultaneous interrelations among key family constructs and diabetes outcomes. Construct measurement was strengthened and bias was reduced by the creation of latent variables and use of data from multiple assessment methods (biological, self-report, and diary-like interviews) and sources (parent and adolescent dyads). Both parent and adolescent reports were included as separate indicators of the constructs in the measurement model to account for measurement error. Latent variable modeling estimated and compensated for measurement error, improved construct estimation, and accounted for non-independence between reporters (Kenny, 1995). The study was also strengthened by a relatively large sample with greater diversity than is often reported in research samples in type 1 diabetes, including nearly one-third non-Caucasian participants, across two sites spanning urban, suburban and rural areas.\n\nStudy limitations included the use of cross-sectional data, which precludes making causal inferences about the relations among the constructs. Further, because participants agreed to take part in a larger intervention trial, unknown characteristics may differentiate them from other families and could limit generalizability. Finally, mothers were the primary parent reporters, despite growing evidence for the role of fathers in monitoring adolescents’ diabetes management (Palmer et al., 2010).\n\nNevertheless, a combination of higher family conflict and lower parental monitoring are related to less frequent or less effective diabetes self-care and poorer glycemic control in early adolescence. These data have the potential to build upon earlier successful behavioral interventions and recommendations for optimizing how parents participate in adolescents’ diabetes self-care (e.g., Anderson, 2004; Ellis et al., 2005; Grey et al., 1998; Silverstein et al., 2005; Wysocki et al., 2008) by emphasizing both the quality of family interactions and importance of parental monitoring. In addition to encouraging parental monitoring of diabetes self-care within the family at the start of adolescence, diabetes clinicians may benefit from assessment of family conflict that may be linked with suboptimal diabetes self-care and poorer glycemic control.\n\nThese findings can inform the development, refinement, and delivery of adherence-promotion interventions that address relevant family dimensions. Interventions that take a multidimensional approach to increase parental monitoring, that emphasize efforts to reduce conflict such as via coping skills training, and that specifically target diabetes self-care have the potential to be particularly beneficial (Anderson, Brackett, Ho, & Laffel, 1999; Ellis et al., 2005; Grey, Boland, Davidson, & Tamborlane, 2000; Wysocki et al., 2008). To expand upon these well-supported family-focused interventions, the current study suggests that both family conflict and parental monitoring are crucial elements of adolescent diabetes self-care and that enhancement of both aspects of family relations has the potential to significantly improve adolescents’ diabetes self-care and may ultimately impact glycemic outcomes.\n\nFuture research could benefit from longitudinal analyses, which can examine the ways in which relations among family factors, diabetes self-care, and glycemic control evolve from early adolescence into later adolescence and then into early adulthood. Longitudinal research would allow for evaluation of bidirectional associations to determine whether and to what degree family relations influence diabetes outcomes and vice versa. In order to promote optimal diabetes outcomes during this challenging developmental period, interventions that build upon the earlier works of Anderson et al. (1999), Ellis et al. (2005), Grey et al. (2000), and Wysocki et al. (2008) are clearly needed. Specifically, further clinical research could determine the most effective intervention strategies and most salient treatment components to promote parental monitoring without increasing or creating family conflict. The overarching goal of such interventions should be to slow or reverse the trajectory of deteriorations in diabetes self-care and glycemic control commonly found in adolescence (Helgeson et al., 2009; Luyckx et al., 2010) by enhancing relevant aspects of family relationships at a critical point in development."
