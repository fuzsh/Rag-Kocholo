At the height of the Holocaust twenty-five young inmates of the infamous Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp – mainly Jewish women and girls – were selected to design, cut, and sew beautiful fashions for elite Nazi women in a dedicated salon. It was work that they hoped would spare them from the gas chambers.

Through research and personal stories, Jeffrey presents the ways labels and categories do more harm than good, and how labels that seem empowering can ultimately divide and conquer us.\n\nJoin 4/6 Life is More than He and She Zoom Session\n\n11 a.m.-12:15 p.m. – Restorative Justice Behind the Wall: A Roundtable with Criminal Justice Professionals\n\nSpeakers: Jessica Oljey, Kara Hayes & Andy Peck\n\nModerators: Jaleh Dashti-Gibson & Dennis Everett, Jr.\n\nThis roundtable will engage criminal justice professionals who are deeply involved in how criminal justice institutions are using restorative justice to move institutional practices in a new direction at both the regional and state levels.\n\nJoin 4/6 Restorative Justice Zoom Session\n\n12:30-1:45 p.m. – Reconsidering Reparations\n\nSpeaker: Dr. Olúfẹ́mi Táíwò, Georgetown University Reparations for slavery have become a reinvigorated topic for public debate over the last decade. Most theorizing about reparations treats it as a social justice project – either rooted in reconciliatory justice focused on making amends in the present; or, they focus on the past, emphasizing restitution for historical wrongs. Olúfemi O. Táíwò argues that neither approach is optimal, and advances a different case for reparations – one rooted in a hopeful future that tackles the issue of climate change head on, with distributive justice at its core. This view, which he calls the “constructive” view of reparations, argues that reparations should be seen as a future-oriented project engaged in building a better social order; and that the costs of building a more equitable world should be distributed more to those who have inherited the moral liabilities of past injustices. This approach to reparations, as Táíwò shows, has deep and surprising roots in the thought of Black political thinkers such as James Baldwin, Martin Luther King Jr, and Nkechi Taifa, as well as mainstream political philosophers like John Rawls, Charles Mills, and Elizabeth Anderson. Táíwò’s project has wide implications for our views of justice, racism, the legacy of colonialism, and climate change policy.\n\nJoin 4/6 Reparations Zoom Session\n\n2-3:15 p.m. – Addressing Health Disparities: Practical Applications\n\nSpeakers: Alvin Morton & Nicole Williams\n\nModerator: Lindsay Carbone\n\nA panel discussion about practical ways students can aid in the reduction of health disparities seen in various sub-populations.
