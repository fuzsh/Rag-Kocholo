        "text": "Since the birthday of the Relief Society is March 17, let’s take a moment to remember its presidents. Some are very well known, while others may be less so. All contributed mightily to the history and purpose of the Relief Society of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. See if you can guess the president whose legacy is described in each section.\n\n1. Where Eliza R. Snow was known as the head of Relief Society, this president was known as the heart. She served the sisters as a midwife and nurse and headed the Silk Association.\n\n2. As a young mother, she hated the idea of meeting with the “old sisters of the church.” While she was president, the women raised $500,000 for the Relief Society Building. She served as Relief Society general president for 29 years. During her tenure, she taught the value of the influence of a woman.\n\n3. This head of the organization lived in the Lion House and was usually sitting to the right of Brigham Young at the dinner table and at family prayer. She wrote beautifully about the gospel and atoning sacrifice of our Savior.\n\n4. She was able to feed her family on what was in their food storage for almost a year when employment was scarce. She spent her teens in New Zealand and served a mission with her husband in Seoul, Korea. She taught of keeping covenants with the Lord and gaining a personal testimony of the Atonement.\n\n5. This leader was called to the Relief Society General Board under Sister Elaine S. Jack to help young women transition into the Relief Society and then was called as a counselor in the Young Women general presidency before serving as Relief Society president. She urged love and unity.\n\n6. She appeared on the \"Phil Donahue Show\" to speak about the Equal Rights Amendment.
