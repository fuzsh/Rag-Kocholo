It is the feminine form of the Late Latin name Clarus which meant \"clear, bright, famous\". Various early male Christian saints were named Clarus; the feminine form became popular after the 13th-century Saint Clare of Assisi (called Chiara in Italian), one of the followers of Saint Francis, who renounced her privileged background and founded the order of Poor Clares.\n\nClare was the main English form of the name used in the Middle Ages, but the Latin spelling Clara became more popular in the 19th century.[1]\n\nGlara is a related Kurdish name with a common origin, meaning \"vision or brightness\".[2]\n\nPeople with this name\n\n[edit]\n\nGiven name\n\n[edit]\n\nClara Alm (born 1996), Swedish footballer\n\nClara Amfo (born 1984), British broadcaster and presenter\n\nClara Arthur (1858–1929), American suffragist\n\nKlara Ashrafyan (1924–1999), Soviet Indologist\n\nClara Ayres (1880–1917), American nurse during the First World War\n\nClara Barton (1821–1912), pioneer American teacher, nurse and humanitarian\n\nClara Doty Bates (1838–1895), American author\n\nClara Nettie Bates (1876–1966), American editor, writer, clubwoman\n\nClara Bancroft Beatley (1858–1923), American educator, lecturer, author\n\nClara Beyers (1880–1950), American actress\n\nClara Bindi (1927–2022), Italian actress\n\nClara Blandick (1876–1962), American actress\n\nClara Bonde (1806–1899), Swedish courtier and royal favourite\n\nClara Bow (1905–1965), American actress\n\nClara Louise Burnham (1854–1927), American novelist\n\nClara Butt (1872–1936), English contralto\n\nClara Calamai (1909–1998), Italian actress\n\nKlara Castanho (born 2000), Brazilian actress\n\nKlára Červenková (1873–1945), Czech geographer\n\nClara Germana Cele, South African woman stated in 1906 to have suffered demonic possession\n\nClara Marguerite Christian (1895–1964), first black woman to study at the University of Edinburgh\n\nClara Chung (born 1987), Korean-American singer/guitarist also known by her stage name, Clara C\n\nClara Rankin Coblentz (1863–1933), American social reformer\n\nClara Novello Davies (1861–1943), Welsh singer\n\nClara Eliot (1896–1976), economist\n\nClara Faragó (1905–1944), Hungarian chess master\n\nClara Shortridge Foltz (1849–1934), first female attorney on the Pacific Coast, suffrage leader, founder of the public defender movement\n\nClara Friedman (1920–2015), Israeli chess player\n\nClara Grima (born 1971), Spanish mathematician\n\nClara Haskil (1895–1960), Romanian classical pianist, renowned as an interpreter of the classical and early romantic repertoire\n\nClara H.
