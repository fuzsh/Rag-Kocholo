        "text": "Tech genius Bill Gates just has to make our list of Business Icons for so many reasons. Author, investor, business magnate, and philanthropist, humanitarian – the list is endless of what this man is known for. Tech genius is of course a title that the founder of the Microsoft Corporation should be comfortable with. And yet even having launched the world’s largest PC Company, Gates remains humble and modest, taking more pride in his charity work and Foundation. A firm believer in making life better for others less fortunate, this billionaire is worthy of being crowned an Icon in both business and in life.\n\nOur favourite quote by Mr. Gates has to be:\n\n“As we look ahead into the next century, leaders will be those who empower others.”\n\nMr. Gates leaves big footsteps to follow but if you do, you’ll be sure to succeed in business and in life."
