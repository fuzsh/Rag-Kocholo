        "text": "William Henry Gates III was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington, U.S. His father was a lawyer, and his mother was a community volunteer. He had two sisters, one older and one younger. Known as Trey to his family, Bill was a bright and competitive child who loved math and reading. At age 8, he began reading encyclopedias for fun. But in grade school, he was bored. His parents decided to send him to Lakeside, a private middle and high school.\n\nAt Lakeside, Bill became an excellent student. He also discovered computers. When he was 13, he wrote his first software program: a tic-tac-toe game. Bill and some friends later wrote programs for their school and for companies.\n\nIn 1973 Gates entered Harvard University. While at Harvard, he and his friend Paul Allen developed software for the first microcomputers. (Microcomputers were smaller and more affordable than earlier computers.) The friends were so successful that Gates left Harvard before graduating. With Allen, he founded Microsoft.\n\nIn 1981 the company IBM included Microsoft software in its new personal computers (PCs). Other companies soon began making PCs, and they also depended on Microsoft software.\n\nMicrosoft offered the first version of Windows in 1985. Windows was based on earlier programs, such as the system that Apple had created for its Macintosh computers (see Steve Jobs). Information was displayed in multiple tiles, called “windows,” on the computer screen. Soon nearly every PC used Windows. In the 1990s Microsoft began focusing on software related to the Internet.\n\nBy the 1990s, Gates had a fortune worth tens of billions of dollars. He decided to give away a large portion of it. In 1994 he and his wife, Melinda, started a foundation that gave money to many projects around the world. For example, the foundation supported efforts to end the disease polio. The couple also funded libraries and scholarships in the United States. In 2008 Gates retired from running Microsoft to work more with his foundation."
