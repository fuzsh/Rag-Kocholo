        "text": "Bill Gates is one of the most recognized names in the world of technology. He is an entrepreneur, philanthropist, investor, and computer programmer who co-founded Microsoft Corporation, the world’s largest personal-computer software company. Gates’ life story is an inspiring one, full of hard work, dedication, and a passion for technology.\n\nEarly Life\n\nBill Gates was born on October 28, 1955, in Seattle, Washington. His father, William H. Gates Sr., was a successful attorney, and his mother, Mary Maxwell Gates, was a prominent businesswoman. Gates attended Lakeside School, a private preparatory school in Seattle. It was at Lakeside School where Gates was first introduced to computers. In 1968, at the age of 13, he wrote his first computer program. The program was a tic-tac-toe game that allowed users to play against the computer.\n\nEducation\n\nAfter finishing high school, Gates enrolled at Harvard University in 1973. However, he dropped out two years later to start his own software company, Microsoft. While at Harvard, Gates had the opportunity to work on computers and software programming. He also met Steve Ballmer, who later became the CEO of Microsoft.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 1975, Gates co-founded Microsoft Corporation with Paul Allen. The company started by creating programming languages for the Altair 8800 microcomputer, and later created the operating system for the IBM PC, which revolutionized the personal computer industry. Microsoft’s success was due in part to Gates’ business acumen and leadership skills. Under his guidance, Microsoft became the dominant player in the personal computer software industry.\n\nGates served as CEO of Microsoft until 2000, when he stepped down to focus on his philanthropic endeavors. He remained as Chairman of the Board until 2014. During his tenure at Microsoft, Gates was responsible for overseeing the development of the Windows operating system, which became the most widely used operating system in the world. He also played a key role in developing Microsoft Office, which remains a standard in business software today.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nIn 2000, Gates and his wife, Melinda, founded the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a charitable organization that aims to improve global healthcare and reduce extreme poverty. The foundation has donated billions of dollars to various causes, including eradicating polio, reducing malaria, and funding education initiatives. Gates has said that he plans to donate 95% of his wealth to charity during his lifetime.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nGates married Melinda French in 1994. They have three children together. In May 2021, the couple announced that they were divorcing after 27 years of marriage.\n\nSome Famous Quotes of Bill Gates\n\n“Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can’t lose.”\n\n“Your most unhappy customers are your greatest source of learning.”\n\n“We all need people who will give us feedback. That’s how we improve.”\n\n“If you can’t make it good, at least make it look good.”\n\n“I choose a lazy person to do a hard job. Because a lazy person will find an easy way to do it.”\n\n“Information technology and business are becoming inextricably interwoven. I don’t think anybody can talk meaningfully about one without talking about the other.”\n\n“As we look ahead into the next century, leaders will be those who empower others.”\n\n“Don’t compare yourself with anyone in this world…if you do so, you are insulting yourself.”\n\n“The Internet is becoming the town square for the global village of tomorrow.”\n\n“I failed in some subjects in exam, but my friend passed in all. Now he is an engineer in Microsoft and I am the owner of Microsoft.”\n\n“The first rule of any technology used in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. The second is that automation applied to an inefficient operation will magnify the inefficiency.”\n\n“To win big, you sometimes have to take big risks.”\n\n“The world won’t care about your self-esteem. The world will expect you to accomplish something BEFORE you feel good about yourself.”\n\n“If you’re born poor, it’s not your mistake. But if you die poor, it is your mistake.”\n\n“If you think your teacher is tough, wait until you get a boss. He doesn’t have tenure.”\n\n“It’s fine to celebrate success, but it is more important to heed the lessons of failure.”\n\n“The future of advertising is the Internet.”\n\n“I have been struck again and again by how important measurement is to improving the human condition.”\n\n“We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten.”\n\nVision of Bill Gates\n\nBill Gates has had several visions throughout his career, but perhaps the most significant one was his vision of a computer on every desk and in every home. He believed that personal computers would become an essential tool for people to improve their lives, both at work and at home. His vision was not just about creating technology but also about making it accessible to everyone. This vision inspired him to co-found Microsoft and develop software products that would help make personal computing accessible and affordable for people around the world.\n\nAnother vision that Gates has had in recent years is that of eradicating diseases such as malaria and polio. Through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, he has donated billions of dollars towards medical research and healthcare initiatives. His vision is to use technology and innovation to solve some of the world’s most pressing healthcare problems, particularly in developing countries.\n\nGates has also been a vocal advocate for climate change action and has called for a shift towards sustainable energy sources such as wind and solar power. He has invested heavily in clean energy technology and has called on governments and businesses to take urgent action to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.\n\nOverall, Gates’ vision has always been about using technology and innovation to solve some of the world’s most significant problems, whether it be through personal computing, healthcare, or climate change action. His vision has inspired generations of entrepreneurs and innovators to think big and use their skills to create a better world for all.\n\nCurrent work of Bill Gates\n\nAs of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Bill Gates is primarily focused on his philanthropic work through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which he co-founded with his wife Melinda Gates in 2000.
