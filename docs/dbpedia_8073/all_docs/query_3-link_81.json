Gates has made his mark on human history with his acclaimed computer software company, Microsoft. Presently, he has been delving into many critical social causes with his non-profit \"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\"\n\nGates has amassed massive amounts of wealth during his career. Even though he has not been actively working with Microsoft for quite a few years now, one can still see his name pop up on lists of the world's richest people.\n\nRegardless of his wealth, he believes in living a rather simple life that he built through his frugal habits.

Cautious Expenditure\n\nGates, regardless of his significant wealth, understands the value of money. Although he can afford to purchase expensive items, he believes in spending his money carefully and being financially prudent.

Informed Investing\n\nGates is known to be a very intelligent investor. According to reports, his investment portfolio is very diverse and is laden with astute long-term investments.\n\n5. Philanthropy\n\nGates believes that real happiness doesn't lie in accumulating material items but in using resources for meaningful initiatives. This is where his philanthropic life comes into play. Gates, with his \"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation,\" has been trying to build solutions for important causes around the world. This also shows that being frugal doesn't always necessarily mean stockpiling wealth, but using that wealth for the betterment of society.\n\nGates' economic habits can be practised by anyone, regardless of their wealth.
