        "text": "The name more synonymous with personal computers than anyone else on the planet, William Henry Gates III famously dropped out of Harvard University to start Microsoft with his childhood friend Paul Allen. Since then he has expanded his empire, introduced the world to Windows, and become one of the richest people in the world year after year. Born in Seattle, Washington in 1955, his parents made no attempt to hide they wanted him to be a lawyer, but he much preferred technology. When he was 13, he wrote his first software program in eighth grade when his school pooled money together to buy a block of computer time and an ASR terminal. Gates was so into programming that he was excused from math classes, and his first program was a Tic-Tac-Toe game that allowed humans to play against the computer itself. Gates and his circle of friends, including Allen, were banned from the Computer Center Corporation when they were found to have been using backdoors in the operating system to get free time on the computer system. After the ban was lifted, Gates offered to find the bugs in the system in exchange for more time, and continued that job until 1970 when the company went out of business. He suffered a childhood tragedy as his best friend, Kent Evans, was killed in a climbing accident when they were in high school, although it led to him and Allen becoming much closer friends. School was a breeze for Gates, who scored 1590 out of a possible 1600 on his SAT and enrolled in Harvard in 1973. While he was a pre-law major in name, he was really interested in math and computer science. After his first year, he reconnected with Allen at an internship in 1974. When a new personal computer was released, the two decided to start their own software company. Gates dropped out of Harvard and he and Allen struck a deal with the head of Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) to write software. Allen came up with the name Micro-Soft, a combination of microcomputer and software. By 1976, the name was shortened to Microsoft. Microsoft’s software was a hit, and the company went independent that same year. They partnered with IBM in 1980 thanks to a tip from Gates’ mom to the CEO of IBM. Allen was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma in 1983 and left the company, leaving Gates as president and the sole decision maker. He launched the first version of Microsoft WIndows in 1985 in competition with Apple’s Macintosh GUI . Windows captured the imagination of the consumer market with its easy, intuitive interface. IBM still wanted its own system, which Microsoft produced, called OS/2. Windows overran IBM and started being the staple of every non-Apple personal computer. Gates made the list of the world’s wealthiest people for the first time in 1987, and was at the top of the list for all but two years between 1995 and 2017. As of the writing of this book, Gates was the fourth-richest person alive with a net worth of $116 billion. He moved into philanthropic measures after stepping away from Microsoft’s day-to-day operations in 2008. He and his ex-wife started the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000, a private charity that has donated billions of dollars. In 2010, he and Warren Buffett founded the Giving Pledge, where a collection of billionaires vowed to give away at least half of their wealth to philanthropic efforts rather than let it all pass on to relatives. As of June 2022, there are more than 236 billionaires on the list with donations in excess of $600 million."
