        "meta_description": "He is the world’s wealthiest and most admired entrepreneur. Just as he rewrote the history of software, Bill Gates is now rewriting the rules of philanthropy. A software competitor once described Bill Gates as one part Albert Einstein, one part John McEnroe and one part General Patton. Iconic, visionary, brilliant, Gates has shaped America’s information technology revolution since the early-1980s. Gates is the richest individual in the world with Forbes placing his current net worth at over $56 billion. Gates has changed the way the world works and communicates. The standards he has set have been novel at every level – enterprise, industry, society and the world. Judged on those criteria, Gates is possibly the greatest business innovator of the post-war period. Microsoft may not have quite the cachet in 2008 as it did in the 1980s and 1990s, but the Seattle-based firm paved the way for the Internet revolution. Without Microsoft’s slew of intricately- coded software products, several applications we take for granted today – from search engines to web 2.0 interactivity – would have taken far longer to develop. Gates’ determination, ambition and entrepreneurial skill laid the platform for today’s wired world. TOP GUN Bill Gates’ father, William H. Gates, was a successful lawyer. His mother, Mary Maxwell Gates, was on the board of First Interstate Bank and the United Way. Recognizing their son’s exceptional cognitive abilities, they enrolled him at Lakeside, an academically rigorous private school for advanced, gifted students. It was here that young Gates discovered the world of computers. He also met Paul Allen who would co-found Microsoft with him. In those heady days of the late-1960s, Gates formed the Lakeside Programming Group along with a handful of fellow computer buffs. He struck his very first deal with the Computer Center Corporation. In return for finding bugs and exposing weaknesses in the corporation’s computer system, Gates and his group were allowed unlimited computer time. As Gates later recounted: “It was when we got free time at C-cubed (Computer Center Corporation) that we really got into computers. I mean, then I became hardcore. It was day and night.” The world of computers seemed to have been created for the Lakeside Programming Group to conquer. Gates and Allen’s first projects included writing a payroll program in COBOL for Information Sciences Inc., producing a small computer for measuring traffic flow based on the Intel 8008 processor (the company they started for the purpose, Traf-O-Data, closed when Gates left for Harvard University) and fixing bugs for defense contractor TRW. Gates secured admission to Harvard in 1973, enrolling in pre-law merely because he could think of nothing better – or worse. Though Allen continuously tried to seduce him away from academia with the idea of starting a software company, the duo’s entrepreneurial epiphany came about only in December 1974. Allen picked up a copy of Popular Electronics with the title “World’s First Microcomputer Kit to Rival Commercial Models”, and a picture of the Altair 8080. It was the moment the two Harvard undergrads had been waiting for. The home computer market was about to explode (though few knew that then) and they wanted to be on the front lines, making software that would run the new machines. Gates and Allen immediately recognized the potential of the microprocessor to revolutionize computing. “I think it’s fair to say that personal computers have become the most empowering tool we’ve ever created. They’re tools of communication, they’re tools of creativity, and they can be shaped by their user,” Gates was to observe later.                 Employing the audacity that would become his hallmark, Gates called Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS), the creators of Altair 8800, considered the world’s first personal computer. Gates offered the com- pany a BASIC interpreter for the software platform. BASIC had been invented by John Kemeny and Thomas Kutrz in 1964. Even though not a line of code had been written as yet, Gates and Allen developed, in time for the presentation to MITS, an Altair emulator that ran on a microcomputer and then the BASIC interpreter. Impressed, MITS agreed to buy the rights for BASIC. It was a program that won immediate popularity with hobbyists. Gates dropped out of Harvard without his degree (he eventually received an honorary doctorate from the university in June 2007) and along with Allen founded Microsoft. It was a bold move. Computers were still being dismissed as mere toys for hobbyists. Microsoft moved to Seattle in 1976. The stage was set. THE BIG LEAGUE In 1980, Microsoft got its taste of the big time. IBM hired the fledgling firm to build its first operating system. Gates displayed daring entrepreneurship and ruthless negotiating skill by buying Q-DOS from Seattle Computer Products, restructuring it for personal computers and delivering it to IBM as PC-DOS in exchange for a one-time fee. It was Microsoft’s initial, tentative step towards defining the software standard of the personal computer industry. In a contractual masterstroke, Gates negotiated permission for Microsoft to license the operating system to other manufacturers. An entire industry of IBM-compatible personal computers, which depended solely on Microsoft’s operating system, was thus created. MS-DOS soon ran on 90 percent of the world’s IBM and IBMclone computers. It was a breathtaking coup for Gates. IBM had surrendered control in perpetuity of the world’s personal computing software standard to Microsoft. The financial consequences to both companies would be significant. For Microsoft, the MS-DOS deal with IBM would in a decade make it the world’s most valuable firm. For IBM, it would lead, two decades later, to the sale of its entire computer hardware division to China’s Lenovo. In 1986, Microsoft went public, raising $61 million. There was no looking back. Though MS-DOS became the world software standard for personal computing, its success paled besides the launch of Microsoft Windows 3.0 in May 1990 – a graphics interface environment that ran on top of MS-DOS. Microsoft was soon supplying 50 percent of the world’s software applications through programs such as Excel, Microsoft Word, Outlook and Access. Gates’ vision for networked computers was central to Microsoft’s success. It was a vision that extended to multimedia, CD-ROMs and books. “Microsoft has had its success by doing low-cost products and constantly improving those products and we’ve really redefined the IT industry to be something that’s about a tool for individuals,” said Gates. Over the years, Gates has come to be both revered and reviled for his aggressive business tactics and confrontational style of management. And Gates has not always got it right. He is said to have misjudged the scale and potential of the Internet. Even though the world wide web emerged in the early-1990s, it was only in 1996 that Microsoft launched its first browser, Internet Explorer 1.0, licensed from a company called Spyglass. Despite being late off the block, Microsoft’s browsers soon became globally dominant. BUILDING A MONOPOLY Gates has also paid a price for possible monopolistic practices. In 2000, he lost a longrunning federal antitrust suit. Despite Gates’ repeated denials that “the hard core truth is that we’ve done nothing wrong”, the judge ruled that Microsoft had committed “monopolization” and blocking of competition in violation of the Sherman Act. United States District Judge Thomas Jackson went so far as to accuse Gates of a “Napoleonic concept of himself and his company, an arrogance that derives from power and unalloyed success.” The George W. Bush administration later decided the case in Microsoft’s favour. Bill Gates — Idea and Beyond Bill Gates is recognized as one of the best businessmen of our time. With his development of Microsoft, Gates impacted huge change, particularly within the realms of business and technology. Gates demonstrated creative initiative at an early age. When he was 15, he started a small business in Seattle based on software and traffic flow. He continued to pursue his interest in software development, creating Basic 1.0. Later he acquired DOS to make an operating system MSDOS. With the birth of Microsoft, Gates was successful in standardizing software for personal computers. Until then, software resided in the community of hobbyists. Programs were, as a tradition, openly shared among developers due to their ease of transfer and hard-to-enforce intellectual property laws. Gates took a “brilliant leap” by bringing business practice into the software realm. Software quickly gained value as complementary components to hardware. Today 95 percent of operating systems for personal computers are Microsoft-based. Success, however, did not happen instantaneously. It took many years of hard work and perseverance to generate idea and potential of opportunity. First, there is plenty of evidence that he had to engage creative function by re-scripting desires, actively utilizing his internal mental sketchpad, loosening any restraints, and employing imagination. Gates re-scripted desires throughout life, enabling him to reach for higher levels of success. Even as a boy, he displayed an above average sense of emotional independence. He was also very competitive, a trait that continued to propel him onward. This “white-hot intensity” did not extinguish as his accomplishments grew. Even as a billionaire at the age of 31, he continued to re-script and pursue higher goals. He also made active use of his internal sketchpad. As a child he was insatiably curious, going as far as learning the encyclopedia cover-to-cover. He continued to exercise his analytical ability and was soon able to quickly process elaborate profiles of information. Gates demonstrated his mental prowess at business meetings, constantly challenging and provoking the group. It was said he would work though various choices and options, as though he was using a mental check-list. Gates was able to loosen restraints by embracing risk in a largely risk-adverse society. He demonstrated this not only in his academics and work ethic, but by participating in skiing, racing, sailing, and other adventure sports. Through constantly living on the edge, he became more comfortable with risk on many different levels. Gates had to perpetually employ his commercial imagination to keep his company ahead in the vibrant domain of computers. Part of this ability emerged from early experiences. He attended Lakeside High, one of the early high schools to incorporate computers in the learning environment. Gates watched as computers, despite their imposing size and expense, captured the attention of students. It was a joke that while his school didn’t have a drug problem, they were afflicted with computer addiction. Witnessing the willingness of technological embrace helped Gates envision future trends. He conjured images of the future in the computer realm, and more importantly, where he fit in to this new world. Gates continued to be forward-thinking throughout his career. Even when he missed a trend, he was quick to catch on. Many innovators in software are perpetually anxious about what Gates’ competitive response could be. Jim Clark, founder of Netscape, worried about how Gates could eat his lunch in the browser business. Jim had the same worries when he founded Healtheon. Bill launched Explorer to counter Netscape and replaced it as the dominant web browser. Microsoft supported Web/MD in the same space as Healtheon. But this time Jim Clark was not going to be surpassed. He did not hesitate to merge Healtheon with Web/MD, escaping the Netscape fate another time around. There is little evidence of Bill Gates being deterred by bias. This is evident in three different areas. He was an early one to embrace the possibility of an electronic brain. He did not shy away from calculated risks. Although he came from an upper-class family, he was motivated to achieve his own economic success. Gates was successful in utilizing forces of change. He first aligned his talents, skills and passion. His talent was apparent at an early age when he scored an 800 on the math section of the SAT. He further honed this talent into skills, working in his school’s computer lab and later on writing his own software codes. He was spurred onward by his passions, which included software development, competition, and wealth creation. Microsoft democratized his software, making it available to all its audience – from IBM to Compaq and Sony. He enhanced it continually in new versions. He did not hesitate in transferring ideas in the same domain. Microsoft did not pioneer but introduced the most dominant spreadsheet, word processor, database and web browser software. There is no question that Gates was hugely successful. He lived his dreams, built an unforgettable company and generated enormous profits. Furthermore, he was able to achieve a wider social purpose with his work, by creating more jobs, contributing to charity, and inspiring people around the globe. One of the most critical factors to his success, however, is his recognition of the system. Gates understood that his innovative work existed within the context of the current macro-societal institutions. He not only values this system, but supports it. In reference to his views on estate tax, Gates responded: “Most of the things that have generated the enormous advances in our economy are things that started on some campus or in some laboratory. Most of those are because the government financed it.” In 2000, Gates – well before his fiftieth birthday – also stepped down as Chief Executive of Microsoft to focus on software development and the new challenges of the mobile Internet age. “We are always saying to ourself… we have to innovate. We got to come up with that breakthrough,” Gates said, echoing the founding spirit of the company. It was also at the start of the new century that he and his wife founded the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The couple married in 1994 and has three children. The Bill and Melinda Foundation has over the years redefined corporate philanthropy, providing funds for AIDS prevention, diseases in the Third World and college scholarships for under-represented minorities. Impressed by the Foundation’s work, billionaire investor Warren Buffett has committed over 80 percent of his company Berkshire Hathaway’s fortune to it in his bequest. When the history of business entrepreneurship is written, Gates may come to be better known for giving away his money than for making it. On June 15, 2006 he announced that he would be disengaging himself from Microsoft to dedicate his time to philanthropy. He plans to walk away completely from day-to-day duties in mid- 2008 though he will remain Chairman and, as he stated pointedly, will always see himself “as the largest shareholder of Microsoft.” Yet being the dyed-in-the-wool entrepreneur he is, Gates will find it difficult to fade away. His swan song is the recent creation of a robotics software group within Microsoft. At the annual financial meeting of the company in 2007, he seemed to still have his finger on the pulse of the IT industry, describing a world where the availability of broadband networks would reshape computing, giving rise to “natural user interfaces” like pen, voice and touch and replacing many functions of the keyboard and the mouse.             Gates will be a tough act to follow. His entire career has been redolent of innovation – from process to practice. Microsoft’s software products have set global standards in novelty. The firm’s R&D effort is large and effective. Microsoft has written some of the world’s most creative, useful software code. Gates has inspired a generation of entrepreneurs in information technology. The sheer versatility of Microsoft’s PC and mobile software products influences millions of digital users worldwide – every waking hour. As rock star Bono recently said of Gates, “He’s changing the world twice. And the second act for Bill Gates may be the one that history regards more.” Bono together with Bill and Melinda Gates were named Time’s Persons of the Year in 2005 for “being shrewd about being good, for rewiring politics and re-engineering justice, for making mercy smarter and hope strategic and then daring the rest of us to follow.” That is the new holy grail of global entrepreneurship and philanthropy. As usual, Gates has set the bar high.",

But this time Jim Clark was not going to be surpassed. He did not hesitate to merge Healtheon with Web/MD, escaping the Netscape fate another time around.\n\nThere is little evidence of Bill Gates being deterred by bias. This is evident in three different areas. He was an early one to embrace the possibility of an electronic brain. He did not shy away from calculated risks. Although he came from an upper-class family, he was motivated to achieve his own economic success.\n\nGates was successful in utilizing forces of change. He first aligned his talents, skills and passion. His talent was apparent at an early age when he scored an 800 on the math section of the SAT. He further honed this talent into skills, working in his school’s computer lab and later on writing his own software codes. He was spurred onward by his passions, which included software development, competition, and wealth creation.\n\nMicrosoft democratized his software, making it available to all its audience – from IBM to Compaq and Sony. He enhanced it continually in new versions. He did not hesitate in transferring ideas in the same domain. Microsoft did not pioneer but introduced the most dominant spreadsheet, word processor, database and web browser software.\n\nThere is no question that Gates was hugely successful. He lived his dreams, built an unforgettable company and generated enormous profits. Furthermore, he was able to achieve a wider social purpose with his work, by creating more jobs, contributing to charity, and inspiring people around the globe.\n\nOne of the most critical factors to his success, however, is his recognition of the system. Gates understood that his innovative work existed within the context of the current macro-societal institutions. He not only values this system, but supports it. In reference to his views on estate tax, Gates responded: “Most of the things that have generated the enormous advances in our economy are things that started on some campus or in some laboratory. Most of those are because the government financed it.”\n\nIn 2000, Gates – well before his fiftieth birthday – also stepped down as Chief Executive of Microsoft to focus on software development and the new challenges of the mobile Internet age. “We are always saying to ourself… we have to innovate. We got to come up with that breakthrough,” Gates said, echoing the founding spirit of the company. It was also at the start of the new century that he and his wife founded the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The couple married in 1994 and has three children. The Bill and Melinda Foundation has over the years redefined corporate philanthropy, providing funds for AIDS prevention, diseases in the Third World and college scholarships for under-represented minorities. Impressed by the Foundation’s work, billionaire investor Warren Buffett has committed over 80 percent of his company Berkshire Hathaway’s fortune to it in his bequest.\n\nWhen the history of business entrepreneurship is written, Gates may come to be better known for giving away his money than for making it. On June 15, 2006 he announced that he would be disengaging himself from Microsoft to dedicate his time to philanthropy. He plans to walk away completely from day-to-day duties in mid- 2008 though he will remain Chairman and, as he stated pointedly, will always see himself “as the largest shareholder of Microsoft.”\n\nYet being the dyed-in-the-wool entrepreneur he is, Gates will find it difficult to fade away. His swan song is the recent creation of a robotics software group within Microsoft. At the annual financial meeting of the company in 2007, he seemed to still have his finger on the pulse of the IT industry, describing a world where the availability of broadband networks would reshape computing, giving rise to “natural user interfaces” like pen, voice and touch and replacing many functions of the keyboard and the mouse.\n\nGates will be a tough act to follow. His entire career has been redolent of innovation – from process to practice. Microsoft’s software products have set global standards in novelty. The firm’s R&D effort is large and effective. Microsoft has written some of the world’s most creative, useful software code. Gates has inspired a generation of entrepreneurs in information technology. The sheer versatility of Microsoft’s PC and mobile software products influences millions of digital users worldwide – every waking hour.\n\nAs rock star Bono recently said of Gates, “He’s changing the world twice. And the second act for Bill Gates may be the one that history regards more.” Bono together with Bill and Melinda Gates were named Time’s Persons of the Year in 2005 for “being shrewd about being good, for rewiring politics and re-engineering justice, for making mercy smarter and hope strategic and then daring the rest of us to follow.” That is the new holy grail of global entrepreneurship and philanthropy. As usual, Gates has set the bar high."
