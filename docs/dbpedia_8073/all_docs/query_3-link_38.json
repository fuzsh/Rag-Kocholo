        "text": "Bill Gates is one of the most influential and richest people on the planet. In the year 2012, his 61 billion dollars in assets made him the world's second-richest man according to Forbes Magazine. He is the co-founder of Microsoft Corporation and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. In this article, we are taliking about the Bill Gates success story in detail:\n\nBill Gates was born on 28 October 1955 in Washington. He is the son of William H. Gates Sr., an attorney, and Mary Maxwell. His mother is a teacher. He has two sisters.\n\nWhen Gates was just 13 years old, he was part of a group and he wrote his first software program. This group includes his childhood friend Paul Allen. He did his graduation from Lakeside School with a score of 1590 out of 1600 and then went to Harvard in 1973 where he met Steve Balmer. After two years, he dropped out of Harvard and joined his childhood friend Paul Allen to build a firm with name \"Micro-Soft\".\n\nThe foundation of Microsoft was taken in 1976 by Bill Gates when he formed a contract with MITS to develop a basic operation for their new microcomputers. Initially, Bill Gates used to go through every line of code. He was also involved in different aspects of Microsoft's business like packing and sending off orders.\n\nThe big break for the company came when in 1980 IBM approached them for a new BASIC operating system for its new computers. Soon, Microsoft gained the dominant position of software manufacturing just like the personal computer market started to grow.\n\nIn the year, 1990, Microsoft released its first version of Windows, which was a breakthrough in operating software that replaced text interfaces with graphical interfaces. And just after five years, Windows 95 was released that set new standards and features for operating systems. This version has been the backbone of all features released from Windows 2000 to the latest XP and also Vista.\n\nGates married Melinda French on January 1 1994. Melinda holds an MBA and a bachelor's degree in computer science. Grates met her while she was working at Microsoft. Presently, the couple has three children- Rory, Phoebe, and Jennifer.\n\nApart from being different positions and contributions, Gates and his wife kept the foundation of Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with the mission to bring improvement in the quality of people's life especially in the areas of global health learning.\n\nThis initiative has benefited a lot of people. It has funded tuition for 20,000 college students to install 47,000 computers in 11,000 libraries across 50 different states. Present-day, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is supporting many causes including the quest to eradicate Polio, fighting AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. The organization is striving hard for providing vaccinations for children, and even reinventing the toilet among many other things.\n\nFor their outstanding contribution and great work, in the year 2005, Bill and Melinda Gates and rock star Bono were named as Time Magazine Person of the Year for their charitable work. In 2006, Gates decided that he would decrease his involvement at Microsoft and spend that time on philanthropy and his foundation.\n\nApart from being the richest man in the world, Bill Gates is an avid reader. He reads roughly 50 books in a year. That means, one book every book that powers himself on a daily basis. If we talk about Bill Gates, he says that he takes all important steps to make sure that he absorbs the book and implements things in his personal life.\n\nAnother important factor on how Bill Gates reads, he does not stop reading if he is in the middle of a book even if he dislikes itâ€“ and scribbles notes on the margins of pages. This is really surprising, but the richest man of the world actively seeks out answers when he goes into content that he does not yet understand. It helps in his personal development and reflection that also shows that he is a lifelong learner.\n\nThe renowned business leader and philanthropist, Bill Gates is widely known for his excellent IQ level. His IQ Test score is 160 IQ according to SAT. SAT is a standard exam for registering some universities in the US. Bill Gates got 1590/1600, that can be said Bill Gates IQ Test score is 160, then he passed the exam at Harvard University.\n\nIn 1975, Bill Gates left Harvard. After working and contributing in the computer industry for 32 years, He had gone to his university and got a MA and PhD in Law for his outstanding contribution to the development of different aspects in the world, mainly in information technology.\n\nIn the beginning of his career at Microsoft, Bill Gates used to regularly pull all-nighters. Once on his blog, he wrote that \"I knew I wasn't as sharp when I was operating mostly on caffeine and adrenaline, but I was obsessed with my work, and I felt that sleeping a lot was lazy.\n\nToday, even after being the biggest billionaire, he still works 16 hours a day. Although, He believes that the major ingredient of his success is his focus. 'My laser focus is the reason for enormous wealth', Gates said once.\n\nToday, a lot of students try to focus so they can work for their goal. Here, following a daily routine will help you to have laser focus. If you emulate successful people, most of the people follow some particular habits.\n\nHe goes to bed typically around 12 am and wakes up at 7 am. Means he sleeps for a total of 7 hours.\n\nThis American billionaire and one of the powerful businessmen in the world, He is a business magnate, software developer, investor, and philanthropist. Besides, he is one of the wealthiest people across the world.\n\nEvery year, Forbes magazine releases reports on the richest people across the world. According to that report, Bill Gates made nearly 11 million dollars a day from 2017 to 2018, and around 33 million dollars a day between 2018 and 2019. If we break this amount more, He earn $456,625 per hour, $7,610 per minute, and $127 per second. Since his net worth keeps going up, the amount of money he makes a day is increasing with every passing day.\n\nWilliam Henry Gates II is the father of Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft. William Henry, famously-known as Bill Gates Sr. is an American attorney and philanthropist. Besides he is the author of the book Showing Up for Life: Thoughts on the Gifts of a Lifetime.\n\nwhen the Los Angeles Times criticized Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation for investing its assets in companies that have been accused of polluting heavily, worsening poverty and do not sell in the developing countries.\n\nThis is surprising but Gates has often warned the world about the potential dangers of a global pandemic. In the year 2015, he gave a warning that the world is not ready for the next pandemic. And, it could lead to the deaths of millions of people.\n\nAnd, when coronavirus started spreading and became a huge danger for global health.
