In addition to his estate in Medina, Washington (named Xanadu 2.0) — which took seven years to build for $63 million — he has purchased many other incredible properties. Gates bought a 4.5-acre vacation ranch in Wellington, Florida, with a 12,864-square-foot mansion. In addition, he spent $27 million to buy other properties in the area which is known for wealthy equestrians. He’s also purchased a $43 million home in Del Mar, California, and a 228-acre property in Rancho Paseana, California which he purchased for $18 million, among other lavish properties.\n\nCars\n\nIt’s reported that Gates is an avid luxury car collector. His first significant car purchase was a Porsche 911, which was later auctioned off for $80,000. He even has a Porsche 959 in his car collection. His car collection encompasses a small part of Gates’ net worth.\n\nStocks\n\nU.S. News & World Report explained that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust’s investment portfolio is worth $42.3 billion as of Dec. 31, 2023. The seven primary investments in the portfolio include Microsoft Corp., Warren Buffett’s company Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Canadian National Railway Co., Waste Management Inc., Caterpillar Inc., Deere & Co., and Ecolab Inc.\n\nPhilanthropy Through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation\n\nThe Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is a 501(c)(3) charity organization founded in 2000 by Gates and his then-wife, Melinda. The organization focuses on several divisions, including but not limited to agricultural development, inclusive financial systems, water sanitation and hygiene, and women in leadership.\n\nThe organization’s work spans continents, including places like the United States, Africa, China, Europe, and the Middle East. Gates has transferred a great deal of his accumulated wealth from Microsoft to the foundation, and one day he plans to give all of his wealth to his charity foundation.\n\nMore From GOBankingRates\n\n7 Best New Dollar Tree Items That Are Worth Every Penny\n\nAverage Cost of Groceries Per Month: How Much Should You Be Spending?\n\n7 Things to Do With Your Savings in 2024 to Grow Your Wealth\n\n4 Reasons You Should Be Getting Your Paycheck Early, According to An Expert"
