        "text": "Bill Gates is one of the world’s most successful computer geniuses, known for inventing Microsoft.\n\nBut where did it all begin for the college dropout? And how did he become one of the world’s richest men?\n\nHere are 15 interesting facts about Bill Gates.\n\nBill Gates coded his first program as a teenager.\n\nAt age 13, Gates joined Lakeside prep school in Seattle, and this is where he created his first software program.\n\nWhen he was in eighth grade, he coded a computer version of tic-tac-toe.\n\nGates created it using General Electric (GE) computer time with a Teletype Model 33 ASR terminal, funded by his school after a rummage sale.\n\nAfter Gates took an interest in programming, he was excused from math classes to develop his coding skills.\n\nOne of the Lakeside teachers even asked him to reprogram the school’s class scheduling system in exchange for more computer time.\n\nBill Gates was a college dropout.\n\nFor such a successful person, it might be surprising Gates was a college dropout. Although this is a trend amongst successful tech entrepreneurs.\n\nGates left Harvard in 1975 after two years of study to devote himself to developing Microsoft.\n\nDespite this, he has been awarded multiple doctorates from universities across the world, even Harvard.\n\nHe has received honorary doctorates from the University of Stockholm in 2002 and Dutch business school; Nyenrode Business University in 2003.\n\nOther universities include; the University of Shinjuku in 2005, the University of Beijing in 2007, and Harvard in 2007.\n\nBill Gates co-founded Microsoft.\n\nIt started in 1975 when Gates took leave from Harvard to build Microsoft with business partner Paul Allen.\n\nAllen came up with the name Micro-soft as a combination of microcomputer and software.\n\nThe two worked on developing Microsoft into what it is today.\n\nAfter working on Microsoft for over 40 years, in March 2020, Gates stepped down as a board member of Microsoft.\n\nHe has given away or sold most of his stock in Microsoft and re-invested it into his charity foundation and startup businesses.\n\nGates has donated around $35.8 billion of his personal Microsoft investments to the Gates Foundation.\n\nHe now owns just over 1% of Microsoft as of 2021.\n\nHe owns a collection of Da Vinci’s writings.\n\nOn November 11, 1994, Gates purchased “Codex Leicester” for $30.8 million.\n\nCodex Leicester is a collection of scientific writings that Gates got his hands on at Christie’s auction house in New York.\n\nGates said it was the second most expensive item he has purchased following his private plane.\n\nIn 2005 he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nIn 2005 Gates was made an Honorary Knight Commander of the Order of The British Empire, also known as KBE.\n\nA KBE is given to those who have shown great contributions to society through the arts and science.\n\nHe was honored with a KBE for his contributions to science, technology, and the business world.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II gave Gates the KBE also for his effort in reducing world poverty.\n\nAlongside his wife, Gates set up the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has made monetary donations across the globe into research and aid for those in need.\n\nGates has three children.\n\nBill and Melinda married on Hawaiian island Lanai in 1994 and not long after had their firstborn.\n\nTogether they have two daughters and one son.\n\nGates’ first daughter Jennifer Katherine Gates, was born on April 26, 1996. His son Rory John Gates was born on May 23, 1999.\n\nGates’ third child, Phoebe Adele Gates, was born on September 14, 2002.\n\nBill Gates is catholic.\n\nThe Gates family is catholic, and religion is a big part of their family life.\n\nGates’ children go to the same Catholic Church as Bill and Melinda.\n\nIt is sometimes contradictory for someone so heavily invested in science also to follow all aspects of religion as there are some clashes.\n\nBut in an interview with Rolling Stone magazine, Gates summed it up perfectly.\n\n“I agree with people like Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for creation myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled in some of the realm – not all – that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there’s no scientific explanation of how it came about.”\n\nGates has an interesting perspective that accepts the findings of science, but he chooses to follow religion for the parts science can’t explain.\n\nHis home is called Xanadu 2.0.\n\nGates’ mansion is situated in Medina, Washington, and overlooks Lake Washington.\n\nThe house was built in a pacific lodge style and is 66,000 square feet (6,100 square meters) in size.\n\nThe house has been recognized for its design and incorporation of technology.\n\nIt has a swimming pool with a built-in underwater sound system, an onsite gym, and a private library.\n\nIn 2009 the property was valued at $147.5 million.\n\nIn 2017 he competed in his first charity tournament.\n\nOn April 29, 2017, Gates took part in his first-ever charity tournament.\n\nHe teamed up with tennis champion Roger Federer to play in the charity event “Match for Africa 4.”\n\nThe non-competitive tennis match was to raise money for Federer’s foundation.\n\nThe event sold out, and $2 million was raised for children in Africa.\n\nOn March 5, 2018, Federer and Gates joined forces once again to form a team for the “Match for Africa 5.”\n\nThey had their second match victory and this time raised over $2.5 million for Federer’s foundation.\n\nHe played himself in the television series “The Big Bang Theory.”\n\nSeason 11, Episode 18 of The Big Bang Theory, saw Gates as a guest cast member, playing himself.\n\nThe episode was titled “The Gates Excitation,” which aired on March 29, 2018.\n\nIn the episode, the main characters all want to meet Gates, but only one of them can, so others plot their own secret meeting.\n\nGates has written three books.\n\nHis first book, “The Road Ahead,” published in November 1995, was a collaboration between Gates, journalist Peter Rinearson and Microsoft executive Nathan Myhrvold.\n\nThe book discussed the development of personal computing and how computing was changing.\n\nGates’ second book, titled “Business @ the Speed of Thought,” was published in 1999.\n\nIn the book Gates discusses the links between business and technology and how to enhance your work by combining the two.\n\nGates’ third book was published on February 16, 2021, titled “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.”\n\nThe book displays what Gates has learned over the past decade about climate change and looks at ways we can address climate issues.\n\nGates is monolingual.\n\nIn an interview, Gates explained that one of his biggest regrets in life was not learning another language.\n\nAlthough he is the master of many digital and programming languages, he never learned another human language.\n\nDespite having influenced the world in many ways, he has never been able to communicate with anyone that doesn’t speak English.\n\nHe has invested in multiple entrepreneurial companies.\n\nAs one of the world’s richest men, Gates has a lot of power when it comes to investment.\n\nHe has invested in startup entrepreneurial companies across many sectors.\n\nAs well as financially backing startups, he has stakes in many companies across the globe.\n\nAs of 2019, Gates was the largest single shareholder of Canadian Network Railway.\n\nGates has a stake of 25% in Ecolab as of 2012 and a 16% stake in AutoNation.\n\nAs of 2019, there have been six documentaries about Gates.\n\nSince 1990 Gates has had a total of six documentaries made about him, his work achievements, and life.\n\nThe first “The Machine That Changed the World,” produced in 1990, was a five-part television series focusing on the history of computers.\n\nThe second “Triumph of the Nerds” was released on April 14, 1996, by PBS in the US and Channel 4 in the UK.\n\nThe documentary looked at the development of personal computers from World War II up until the mid-1990s.\n\n“Nerds 2.0.1” was a follow-on series that again featured Gates, this time looking at the development of the internet and the World Wide Web.\n\n2010 saw the release of two documentaries to both feature Gates. These were “Waiting for Superman” and “The Virtual Revolution.”\n\nIn 2019 the three-part documentary series “Inside Bill’s Brain: Decoding Bill Gates” explored the life of Gates from building Microsoft to developing the Bill and Melinda Foundation.\n\nGates had a net worth of $116 Billion in 2020.\n\nIt all started in 1987 when Forbes magazine listed Gates as the world’s youngest self-made billionaire.\n\nIn 2015 he was the richest man in America. He was named the richest person in America’s 50 largest cities in 2016.\n\nGates was named the richest person out of every state of the US in 2017.\n\nHe was number two on Forbes billionaires list of 2020.\n\nBill Gates is one of the world’s most important developers in computer technology.\n\nHe has been listed as one of the top inventors of the 20th Century, and his legacy of Microsoft will continue to develop.\n\nAlthough he has stepped down from Microsoft, he continues his work in other ways by investing in startups and focusing on his charitable foundation."
