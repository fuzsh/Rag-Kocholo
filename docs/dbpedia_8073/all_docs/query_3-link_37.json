He was born in an upper-middle-class American family in Seattle, Washington. Since childhood, Bill was fond of books and preferred reading all the time. However, his parents never allowed him to read at the dinner table (a norm in the American culture) as they wanted him to spend this time with the family.\n\nAt an early age, Bill realized the potency of personal computers and software to make those systems useful. Keeping this idea in mind, he started programming computers back in 1968 – when he was merely 13 years old! With his friend Paul Allen, Bill used to skip his high school classes to engage in programming. They took this initiative at a power plant. Since his childhood days, he was very sharp and his initial entrepreneurial endeavor was co-founding Traf-O-Data during his school time.\n\nThis is how the path towards building the world’s biggest tech company was taking its shape in his mind and finally, Microsoft came into existence in the year 1975 when just college dropout Bill with his friend Paul set up their initial office at a garage.\n\nThis is how the stepping stone of the future’s top technology organization was laid out and after that Bill never had to look behind.\n\nAre you also working on writing an essay about an influential personality?

Not only that, he inspired an entire generation and became a living example and even students at present time have a chapter in the syllabus about this man’s achievements.\n\nLet us take a look at some of the pointers below about Bill Gates from being just a human being to becoming a living legend:\n\nThe journey started when Bill entered Harvard University for a Pre-Law Major Course in 1973 and in the year 1975, he dropped out of the college and started Microsoft with his friend Paul Allen in a small garage.\n\nThe first success came in 1980 when he developed DOS (Disk Operating System) for IBM.\n\nIn 1985, Microsoft came into existence with the first Windows operating system, Windows 1.0.\n\nHaving $1.25 billion, he became the world’s self-made youngest billionaire in 1987.\n\nIn 1989, founded a digital image company named Corbis.\n\nForbes declared Gates as America’s richest man possessing $6.3 billion in the year 1992\n\nIn 1995 he was declared the world’s richest man.\n\nIn 1996 Microsoft released Internet Explorer 3.0 and it gained instant fame becoming the go-to internet surfer for the limited people (mostly professionals) who had the opportunity to use the World Wide Web\n\nIn the year 2000, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was established.\n\nThe year 2005, brought another success for him and his Wife. Bill and Melinda were framed as the “Persons of the Year” by Time Magazine.\n\nTo pursue his philanthropic journey, he stepped down from Microsoft’s day-to-day roles in the year 2006.\n\nIn the year 2007 Gates was awarded an honorary degree from Harvard University – the college he dropped out of in his early days\n\nIn 2009, Gates decided to do a partnership with the Chinese Ministry of Health to fight against the epidemic of Tuberculosis in China.\n\nGates Foundation donated $10 Billion for vaccine research for the years in the year 2010.\n\nIN 2014, Bill Gates decided to bow out as the chairman of the Board of Microsoft.

To reach this position, he had to travel long and thorny roads. Among such unimaginable achievements, many unsuccessful attempts came his way that eventually made him more patient stronger, and confident to reach the peak.\n\nLet’s take a look at some of his notable let-downs:\n\nMicrosoft Zune\n\nLaunched in 2006, Zune was a digital media product marketed by Microsoft. Ideated to give apple iPod a tough competition, it could not perform per expectations. Due to its bulky size, short battery life, and poor user interface, it could not meet the high demands of the customers and Microsoft had to discontinue Zune in 2012.\n\nWindows Vista\n\nLaunched in 2007 but was quickly slammed by users and reviewers. Because of its sluggishness, bugs, and security issues, most of the users went back to the previous OS (Windows XP) version. Even though it created a high buzz among the users, Vista turned out to be a major failure for Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft Kin\n\nIn 2010, Kin – a smartphone device targeting teenagers was launched by Microsoft. This new device also could not perform per the young customers’ expectations. Due to high pricing, poor selection of apps, and puzzling user interface, it turned out to be a super-flop initiative. The product was discontinued within six weeks.\n\nWindows 8\n\nIn 2012, the world experienced the launch of Windows 8. This version of the OS had a major makeover from its previous ones. Unfortunately, the big design and mainly user interface changes were not accepted by most of the customers. Many users thought to stick with the older version (Windows 7). Like Windows Vista, Windows 8 was also a big failure for Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft Surface\n\nIn 2012, to give a tough fight to apple’s iPad; Microsoft released a tablet computer named Surface. Unfortunately, due to overpricing, fewer features than the competitor device, poor app availability, and poor user interface, Microsoft had to discontinue this range of devices as well.\n\nWindows 8.1 and 10 Mobile\n\nIn 2011, windows came up with a range of mobile phones with the name Lumia. These devices had a new user interface that had a similar user interface and other traits as Windows 8. In 2015, Microsoft released Windows 10 Mobile, an operating system for smartphones. Both of these were flop initiatives. Due to the critical user interface, poor app ecosystem, and lesser features in compared to Android or apple OS, Microsoft had to discontinue the entire product range in 2017.\n\nMicrosoft HoloLens\n\nIn 2016, Microsoft came up with the HoloLens – a mixed-reality headset, an updated version of VR glasses was launched. For its large size, short battery backup, and limited field of view, this initiative was also not welcomed by the customers. Microsoft had to discontinue the production and sales of HoloLens within a very short time.\n\nMicrosoft Band\n\nTo compete in the fitness tracking market, the Microsoft Band came into existence. However, because of its big shape, short-life battery, and limited features, it also became a flop initiative. As a result, Microsoft discontinued its Band.\n\nAs you can see, a company may experience many downfalls but it needs to keep confidence in its belief, founding motto, and most importantly the person chairing the organization. Bill Gates may have seen many failures but he stood strong in his belief of impacting people’s lives and he is successfully able to do so.\n\nSimilarly, if you are studying and facing issues with your academic work, you might find things going out of your hand.
