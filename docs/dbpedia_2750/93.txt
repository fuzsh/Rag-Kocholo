Casa Lle√≥ i Morera, by architect Llu√≠s Dom√®nech I Montaner, is located on Passeig de Gr√†cia 35, in the Eixample district of Barcelona. The building sits on the corner of Carrer del Consell de Cent. It is one of the three important buildings of Barcelona‚Äôs Illa de la Disc√≤rdia (Block of Discord), next to Casa Batll√≥ by Antoni Gaud√≠ and Casa Amatller by Josep Puig i Cadafalch.

In 1902 Francesca Morera i Ortiz assigned Llu√≠s Dom√®nech i Montaner to remodel the Casa Rocamora, built in 1864. She died before the work was finished in 1906, and the building was named after her son, Albert Lle√≥ i Morera.

Llu√≠s Dom√®nech i Montaner, Gaud√≠‚Äôs professor, was one of the leading proponents of Modernist architecture. Other buildings in Barcelona by Dom√®nech i Montaner include the L‚ÄôHospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Casa Fuster, Palau de la M√∫sica Catalana and the Castillo de los Tres Dragones (Castle of the Three Dragons) in Parc de la Ciutadella.

Modernist decorative arts in the interior include stained glass, mosaics, sculpture, woodwork, metal works and sgraffito.

Llu√≠s Dom√®nech i Montaner along with decorator Gaspar Homar lead a large team of artists and craftsmen.

Llu√≠s Bru and Mario Maragliano created the mosaic work, Eusebi Arnau made the sculptures, Antoni Serra i Fiter made the ceramics, and Gaspar Homar designed the decoration and the furniture.

Antoni Rigalt i Blanch made the stained-glass windows including the largest work representing the tree of life, in the rear of the house.

The pinnacles and the tempietto at the top of the building were badly damaged by machine guns during the Spanish civil war and have since been restored.

The N√∫√±ez i Navarro Group acquired Casa Lle√≥ i Morera in 2006. Other historic restoration projects undertaken by the N√∫√±ez i Navarro Group include Hotel 1898 and La Rotonda on Avinguda Tibidabo.
