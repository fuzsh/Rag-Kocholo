        "text": "Designed by Lluís Domènech i Montaner, Casa Lleó is one of the three Modernist buildings that make up the Block of Discord (\"Manzana de la Discordia\") on Barcelona's Gràcia Avenue, alongside Casa Batlló and Casa Amatller. Originally constructed in 1864 and renovated in 1902, it may appear less extravagant than its counterparts, but no less opulent when it comes to the richly decorated balconies and facade. The ground floor, altered years ago, has recently been restored to its original beauty and now looks quite impressive.\n\nThe edifice stands out with its distinctive egg-shaped rooftop and intricately ornamented round-shape balcony. Upon closer inspection, one can notice the building's name, \"Lleó Morera,\" depicted on the facade, which translates to \"lion\" and \"mulberry\" in Catalan. Additionally, there is a depiction of a light bulb and a telephone, symbolizing the latest inventions of the time.\n\nThe first-floor dining room reveals one of Barcelona's most stunning interiors, showcasing stained-glass windows, exquisite woodwork, marble details, complete with the eight ceramic mosaic wall panels depicting idyllic countryside scenes. Together, these elements set Casa Lleó Morera apart from the works of the city's other renowned modernist, Antoni Gaudí. The staircase in the house is also notably unique for European buildings of that period.\n\nCompared to the more popular and besieged by visitors Amatller and Batlló houses, a visit to Lleó Morera offers a comfortably relaxed experience without being dull. Guided tours of the building are available for a fee, making it an excellent choice for passionate modernist enthusiasts and architecture buffs who won't be disappointed by the experience.\n\nLa Ribera Walking Tour\n\nLa Ribera is a culturally rich, historic area of Barcelona’s Old Town; somewhat less touristy than the Gothic Quarter (which one should really visit as well) and quite unspoiled, authentic and pretty. Centuries ago, it was a very well-to-do neighborhood inhabited by aristocrats, merchants, wealthy sailors, and Jewish money-lenders. Today, it is regarded as the Soho of Barcelona – a popular... view more\n\nTour Duration: 2 Hour(s)\n\nTravel Distance: 2.8 Km or 1.7 Miles\n\nBarcelona Shopping Walk\n\nA long-time prime cultural destination, Barcelona is also en route to becoming one of Europe's top shopping spots. Each new day, fashionable designer stores, from well-known international brands to local start-ups, are filling the city streets. If you're a fan of shopping, you're in for a treat when visiting this beautiful city.

Here, you can watch a spectacular water show at the Magic Fountain of Montjuic, visit the place where matadors faced the bulls in the past, and explore the ancient Montjuic Castle with its breathtaking views.\n\nA convenient start point, Placa d'Espanya is the second... view more\n\nTour Duration: 3 Hour(s)\n\nTravel Distance: 5.0 Km or 3.1 Miles\n\nGothic Quarter Walking Tour\n\nA walk around the Gothic Quarter is a journey through time to Barcelona’s oldest history, going back to times of Roman rule; in fact, the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the quarter's layout. Only a few roads are open for car traffic, so there will be little in the way of enjoying the many narrow, atmospheric streets filled with superb food, high-quality architecture,... view more\n\nTour Duration: 2 Hour(s)\n\nTravel Distance: 1.8 Km or 1.1 Miles"
