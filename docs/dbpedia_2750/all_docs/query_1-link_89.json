        "text": "Did you ever imagine how a house designed by nature and not by humans could be? Welcome to Casa Batlló, an incredible piece of art inspired by marine life and nature.\n\n1. Architectural introduction to Casa Batlló\n\nCasa Batlló or Batlló house is a magical masterpiece that seems to be more natural than artificial. It was designed by Antoni Gaudí, one of the main figures of Catalonian modernism, at the request of Josep Batlló.\n\nHe was a peculiar and extravagant architect who created a really personal and magical style.\n\nCasa Batlló is the result of the total renovation of an old conventional house built in 1877 by Emilio Sala Cortés.\n\nGaudí received the order to make a new design from the owner, Josep Batlló i Casanovas, a textile industrialist. It was restored between 1904 and 1906.\n\nThis house is located in the middle of Barcelona, at Passeig de Gracia 43.\n\nTogether with Casa Lleo-Morera and Casa Amatller, Casa Batlló creates the so-called Illa de la Discòrdia (Block of Discord) due to the rivalry between the designs.\n\nThis block reflects the different styles of the three major modernist architects: Antoni Gaudí, Lluís Domènech i Montaner and Josep Puig i Cadafalch.\n\nThe organic shapes that Gaudí used in this restoration bring us a symbolic universe. The marine inspiration transports visitors to a dreamlike world of enchanted and fantastic landscapes.\n\nGaudí used innovative concepts and methodologies for his time.\n\nHe achieved great functionality in all the spaces without losing any of their artistic value. The old house was radically changed.\n\nOn the facade, he added a tribune, new balconies, and polychrome ceramics.\n\nInside, he reorganized the spaces. He unified the existing staircase and patio to add better lighting and ventilation.\n\nHe completed his intervention by adding two floors and a spectacular ceramic roof.\n\nCasa Batlló was declared a National Historic-Artistic Monument in 1969. In 2005 Unesco included it within the World Heritage Site “Works of Antoni Gaudí”.\n\nAnimal forms, especially from the ocean, curves, the impressive roof, and bright colors create a unique masterpiece in Barcelona.\n\nAre you looking forward to visiting it? Yes, of course!\n\n2. What to see in Casa Batlló?\n\nThe Main Facade: Welcome to an Enchanted House\n\nThe undulating facade is covered with splendid colored mosaics following the trencadís technique. It is probably the most suggestive, creative, and original in the city. You can not miss it!\n\nOn the first floor, you will see the tribune, an oval-shaped big window. It has some columns which seem to be made from human bones. Gaudí and his ingenuity had no limits.\n\nThere are seven balconies that look like fragments of skulls with openings for the eyes and nose. They have a curved floor plan and a famous and iconic balustrade.\n\nFor some people, they look like masks or even bats. Let your imagination decide!\n\nOn the upper floor, you will see the balcony of the loft. There is a small window with a small balcony which seems to be a flower.\n\nThe facade is a piece of art itself. Prepare your camera cause you will take plenty of pictures here.\n\nThe Roof: A Dragon Spine\n\nThe roof is one of Gaudí’s most characteristic elements for urban buildings. It has a wavy shape that looks like the arched back of a dragon and it is covered with colorful ceramic tiles that evoke scales.\n\nOn one side of the roof, there is a tower with the typical Gaudí four-armed cross indicating the four cardinal points.\n\nThe House: Creativity Everywhere!\n\nGaudí believed in an all-encompassing design. The intensity of the details and the materiality do not remain only on the facade. He included them in the interior. In an even more detailed way!\n\nThe fluidity and organic walls, the use of color, and the surprising changes in scale are everywhere inside the spaces.\n\nCasa Batlló has an area of ​​4300m2. It is 32m high and 14.5m wide. Gaudí established a basement, ground floor, main floor with patio, four entire floors, attic, and roof terrace.\n\nThe Noble Floor: The Batlló Family Residence\n\nYou will access it through an imposing hall. It evokes Captain Nemo’s marine grottos with undulating walls and a spectacular staircase.\n\nYou will get impressed by this staircase for sure. It has hand-carved wooden handrails that seem to be the backbone of a large animal.\n\nThe landing is illuminated by two ceiling windows and has a large ceramic fireplace built into the wall. A lot of special details can be found in Casa Batlló.\n\nThe main space has views over Passeig de Gracia through its characteristic windows. This large living room is divided into three spaces, but it can be opened to create a magnificent unique space.\n\nThe ceilings of the house continue with the organic wavy shapes that evoke the movement of the sea. You will feel you are inside the ocean, in an underwater fantasy world.\n\nThe Patio\n\nThe patio is a fundamental part of Casa Batlló. There is a big and beautiful skylight on top which introduces light and air into the building. This space was expanded to gain more natural air and daylight.\n\nThe entire patio is covered with ceramics tiles in blue tones. More intense at the top and lighter at the bottom. In this way, it was possible to achieve a uniform distribution of light and a beautiful looking.\n\nThe upper windows are smaller and as we descend they become larger, so more light enters. In the central part of the patio, Gaudí installed the elevator, a beautiful and original wooden cabin.\n\nHere, you will feel you are in a marine dive at the bottom of the ocean. Something as usual as a patio became a magical and oniric space in Casa Batlló.\n\nThe Loft and the Roof Terrace\n\nAt the loft, you will find a very original space. There are sixty catenary arches that seem to be the ribs of an animal. It feels like you are inside the dragon skeleton.\n\nThe main purpose of this space was to host services for the tenants such as laundry rooms or storage. What a beautiful space for that purpose!\n\nA spiral staircase communicates with the 300m2 roof terrace, another magical spot in Gaudí´s works. Here, you will feel like you are in a fairy tale.\n\nYou will be surrounded by sinuous and polychrome original chimneys. There are 27 chimneys in total, in groups of four. They are covered with glass fragments and ceramic using the trencadís technique.\n\nIt is a very cozy and unique space with amazing views of the city. Definitely a must-see spot. Don´t miss it!\n\nBeauty and function come together in every area of ​​the building, from the entrance to the rooftop. Antoni Gaudí created an exceptional universe and incredible environment.\n\nPrepare yourself for this magical experience.\n\nYou can find a great virtual tour of Casa Batlló here.\n\n3.
