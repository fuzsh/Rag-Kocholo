        "text": "On a balmy Saturday afternoon in Barcelona, whilst an interminable queue of tourists winds around Gaudí’s Sagrada Familia in the October sun, a few hundred metres away, a handful of visitors are quietly buying hassle-free entrance tickets to a lesser-known but equally impressive architectural masterpiece.\n\nWith its extraordinary mix of Moorish arches, Medieval counterpanes and bas relief sculptures, the monumental, neo-Gothic façade of the Art Nouveau Hospital Sant Pau towers above the modern apartment buildings of the residential Guinardó barrio (santpaubarcelona.org; admission €16/£14 or if you’re visiting Gaudí’s La Pedrera, you can book a combined ticket for both buildings online which works out cheaper.)\n\nOpened in 1930 by King Alfonso XIII, for decades this was one of Barcelona’s most modern and busiest hospitals and when I lived in Barcelona some years ago, the building, although a Unesco-listed World Heritage site, was not yet open to the public.\n\nNow fully restored and sprawling across no less than nine blocks of the city like a neo-Gothic theme park, the vast complex features 27 pavilions crowned with Byzantine domes, Renaissance cupolas and Gothic spires set around landscaped gardens filled with acacia, chestnut and orange trees.\n\nSo who was responsible for this singular vision? The answer is Lluís Domènech i Montaner – a Renaissance man who not only designed some of Barcelona’s most spectacular buildings, but was also a prominent politician, publisher, author, journalist and teacher. As a Professor at the Barcelona School of Architecture meanwhile, one of his pupils was a certain Antoni Gaudí, who although only two years his junior, was soon gaining commissions at least as prestigious as the already well established Domènech.\n\n2023 will mark the centenary of Domènech’s death in 1923 and commemorative events are currently being planned, but you can already see many of his most striking works dotted around the city.\n\nBorn in 1849 in Barcelona, Domènech i Montaner was, like his younger rival, one of the leading proponents of the cutting-edge architectural style of the time – Art Nouveau, as it was called in France, or Modernisme – as its exceptional Catalan equivalent was known. (Not to be confused with the clean lines of 20th century Modernism as pioneered by Le Corbusier, which was its antithesis.)\n\nHowever, whereas Gaudí used his fantastical imagination and nature’s inspiration to create his fluid, organic forms, arguably Domènech was a more pragmatic talent, who although drawing on many of the same influences as Gaudí – nature and Arabic, Oriental and medieval styles – used them in a different way. His particular gift lay in his masterful ability to harness the phenomenal pool of talent still available at the tail end of the 19th century bringing together the most outstanding craftsmen of the day.\n\nAs local tour guide Alex Carbonell tells me: ‘He was the first to see the possibilities of integrating all the arts – ceramics, sculpture, ironwork and glass into architecture.”\n\nYou can see this brought to life both at the Hospital Sant Pau and also in Domènech i Montaner’s other masterpiece and best-known work – the Palau de la Música Catalana (Palace of Catalan Music) concert hall. (palaumusica.cat; €17/£15).\n\nTucked away down a narrow Medieval lane in Barcelona’s Gothic Quarter, about five minutes’ walk away from Las Ramblas (and only about 45 minutes’ walk from Sant Pau), the Palau must be one of the most ornate concert halls in the world.\n\nMosaiced pillars, glittering friezes and cupolas decorate the façade but the real showstopper is the auditorium. A visual feast of sculptural reliefs, ceramic roses and more mosaiced pillars fills the hall, topped off by its crowning glory – a huge, blue, violet and yellow stained glass skylight in which a stylised female choir encircle a radiating sun like a slate of Tiffany glass reimagined by Busby Berkeley.\n\nSince opening its doors in 1908, the Palau has played host to some of the greatest names in music from Prokofiev, Pablo Casals and Leonard Bernstein to Daniel Barenboim and Herbie Hancock and for the full experience, you can’t beat coming here for a concert.\n\nIf you’ve seen both the Palau and the Hospital in one day, you’ll probably be ready for a drink, dinner or both. To continue the Modernista experience, it’s less than a 15-minute walk from the Palau to yet another of Domènech’s great show pieces – the interior of the Hotel España, recently refurbished as a glamorous four star hotel. (If you’re here on a Saturday evening or Sunday morning, stop outside Barcelona’s majestic Gothic cathedral to catch the traditional Catalan sardana dances.)\n\nOriginally an inn and restaurant dating back to the 1850s, the Hotel España was redesigned by Domènech in 1905 featuring his signature mix of Gothic and natural influences from the swirling sgraffito murals both on the hotel’s inner courtyards as well as its elaborate dining rooms.\n\nThe hotel’s Fonda España restaurant is now a fine-dining destination restaurant in its own right under the direction of multi-Michelin-starred, superstar Basque chef Martín Berasatagui and its superb day to day chef German Espinosa. Savouring wonderfully subtle dishes like red prawn ravioli with green pepper gazpacho or citrus-infused, steamed hake with saffron foam beneath medieval-style brass ceiling chandeliers, ornately carved wooden wainscoting and florid ceramic tiles, I felt like a modern day Maid Marion at the Sheriff of Nottingham’s feast (hotelespanya.com; set lunch menus from €32/£27).\n\nYou can easily visit several other Domènech buildings within two or three days in the city. See his first major work – the Montaner and Simon publishing building, just off the leafy Passeig de Gracia – which is now a small museum featuring the work of the 20th-century Catalan artist Antoni Tàpies (fundaciotapies.org; admission €8/£7). Here, admire Domènech’s classical and arabesque red brick façade topped with the giant swirling iron wires of a Tàpies sculpture.\n\nThen, explore the exceptional Casa Lleó i Morera, with its filigreed stone work (the ornate interior is currently closed to the public), and the Casa Fuster – originally a private mansion but now a hotel, worth stopping by for coffee or cocktails under the gilded, vaulted ceilings of its Café Vienés (hotelcasafuster.com).\n\nIf you have time, the Domènech House Museum (casamuseu.canetdemar.cat; admission €5/£4) in the small seaside town of Canet de Mar, less than an hour’s train journey north along the coast from Barcelona, makes for a perfect away-day. Trains run regularly from Plaza Catalunya on the R line (rodalies.gencat.cat/es/horaris; €9.20/£38 return). It’s in a separate part of the station to the Metro underground system though; look out for the glass lift on the north side of the square.\n\nAt the top of a leafy pedestrianised boulevard running down to the sea, this was for many years Domènech’s home and office and you can see not only an illuminating display exploring his life and work, but also the elegant bay-windowed rooms he built for himself and his family.\n\nThere are also various other buildings of his nearby, including a restaurant and the impressive Castillo Santa Florentina (turismecanet.cat) but on the day I was there, I was the only visitor.\n\nWhereas over the last few decades, Gaudí has become a merchandising sensation, his popularity inextricably linked with Barcelona’s ascent as a tourist destination, Domènech i Montaner has remained overshadowed by his more famous rival. Perhaps in 2023, some of those tourists lining up to see the Sagrada Familia will look elsewhere to find something equally magnificent.\n\nEssentials\n\nEddi Fiegel was a guest of Turisme de Barcelona (visitbarcelona.com) and Barcelona Provincial Council.\n\nHow to Get there: Vueling (vueling.com) flies to Barcelona from Birmingham, Dublin, Edinburgh, London Gatwick and Manchester. Return flights from London Gatwick from £52.\n\nWhere to Stay: Hotel España (hotelespanya.com; 00 34 935 50 00 00), part of the Preferred Hotels group (preferredhotels.com), has double rooms from €175 (£150) room only.\n\nHave you visited any of Lluís Domènech i Montaner's buildings?
