        "text": "The works of Gaudi\n\nAntoni Gaudi’s masterpiece is the Sagrada Familia (pictured left), a giant church built for a Catholic foundation and dedicated to the Christian Holy Family. Most of the existing structure was built over 40 years within Gaudi’s lifetime, but the church remains incomplete. The church features fantastical sculpture and decorations depicting various scenes from the bible. The structure is dominated by the four towers on the Nativity façade, which can be viewed from far away.\n\n​\n\nConstruction has continued in the last few decades, but the Sagrada Familia remains far from completion. Gaudi was conscious of the fact that the church would not be completed in his lifetime, so he has left numerous drawings and models for future reference. There are expected to be 12 towers upon completion, with the tallest in the centre and dedicated to Jesus Christ. When complete, the church is expected to serve as an illustration of the Bible, with a narrative starting from Adam and Eve to the evangelism of the Apostles.\n\nWithin the town area itself, the Passeig Gracia is virtually a one-stop museum dedicated to the works of Barcelona’s most famous architects of the era. There is the Casa Amatller by Josep Puig I Cadalfach, the Casa Morera by Domenech I Montaner and two works by Gaudi — Casa Battlo and Casa Mila. These were homes and apartment blocks financed by wealthy businessmen of the era who had made their fortunes in railroads, textiles and banking."
