Is there any city, anywhere in the world, whose key architecture is so magical, so otherwordly, so redolent of a time and a place? That’s a rhetorical question, by the way.\n\nBarcelona is undoubtedly Antoni Gaudí’s city. He is the Modernista master.\n\nThirty-odd million tourists visit Barcelona a year. Probably 90% of them completely fall in love with Antoni Gaudí’s architecture. I did. (The other 10% are most likely blind-drunk stag do attendees.)\n\nArchitecture is so much more than beautiful building, it’s the history of a city in stone and wood. To really get to know a city you devour its architecture. To really get to know Barcelona you devour Gaudí’s buildings.\n\nWhich is what I did in Sep 2017…\n\nI started here, a list of Gracia’s modernista buildings.\n\nGracía may well have more modernista structures per square meter than any other place on earth.\n\nThis was handy. Gracía was where we were based. My completist, list-ticking alter ego kicked in. I made a list of all the city’s modernista buildings (or rather stole it from Wikipedia), plotted them on a map (which you can see here or below) and set out to conquer them all.\n\n(The titles of the buildings link to their location. All the photos were taken by me. They are of substandard quality — feel free to use but probably unwise to. These, on the other hand, are mostly lovely.)\n\n1. Casa Vicens\n\n5. La Casa Comalat\n\nHmmm — must have missed this. Note to self: more haste, less speed.\n\n6. Casa de les Punxes\n\n12. Casa Calvet\n\nAnother I appeared to have missed.\n\n13. Camiseria Bonet\n\n14. Cafè de l’Òpera\n\n15. Lampposts in Plaça Reial\n\n20. Park Güell\n\nReportedly on one occasion Gaudí said to Güell, “Sometimes I think we are the only people who like this architecture.” Güell replied, “I don’t like your architecture, I respect it.”\n\nWell, I love and respect this architecture. Goodbye.\n\nAntoni Gaudí: bringing heaven to earth\n\nTraffic had stopped, shops were shut and paving stones were being uprooted to build barricades. Up on a roof a British…\n\nwww.theguardian.com\n\nL'illa de la Discòrdia, Block of Discord in Barcelona\n\nIn one housing block at Passeig de Gracia we find together the 3 great geniuses of Catalan Modernism: Gaudí, Domènech i…\n\nwww.casalleomorera.com"
