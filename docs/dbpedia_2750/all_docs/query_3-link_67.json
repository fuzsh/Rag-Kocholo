This document provides an introduction to David Mackay's 1985 book \"Modern Architecture in Barcelona (1854 - 1939)\". It summarizes the scope of the book, which examines the development of architecture in Barcelona from the mid-19th century through 1939. It explores how architecture reflects issues of cultural identity and modernity. The chronology spans from 1854, when the walls of medieval Barcelona were demolished to accommodate industrialization, through 1939, which marked a disruption due to reactionary forces.",
