        "text": "Max Offsay\n\n·\n\nFollow\n\n35 min read\n\n·\n\nMay 25, 2016\n\n--\n\nOn Friday morning, the day after my finals, my roommate and I took a shuttle to the Bologna Airport and hopped on a flight to Barcelona. When we landed, we boarded a bus that dropped us off at Plaça Catalunya, a square that was a few minute walk away from our hostel. We checked in, dropped off our stuff in our room and decided to go walk around the city. Our hostel was in the Eixample, or expansion, district of Barcelona that was built in the 19th and 20th centuries expanding out of the old city of Barcelona. We walked back through Plaça Catalunya and onto La Rambla, the famous street in Barcelona lined with restaurants and shops. We walked through La Boqueria, the outdoor covered market just off of La Rambla and sampled some jamón and manchego cheese.\n\nEventually we made it all the way down La Rambla to the water. At the end of La Rambla there is a 40 meter tall column with a statue of Christopher Columbus at the top. It was constructed for the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition, basically a World’s Fair. It commemorates the occasion when Columbus reported to King Ferdinand V and Queen Isabella I in Barcelona after he returned from his first voyage to the New World.\n\nWe walked along the boardwalk by the water and eventually made it to the Barcelonetta district and the beach. We walked past a street food festival on the boardwalk that had a bunch of little food trucks and live music being played which was pretty cool. It was funny because a lot of the food wasn’t Spanish, but was rather trying to be very American.\n\nWe walked down to the beach and enjoyed the view for a little bit and then made our way back towards our hostel to have some dinner.\n\nWe walked back through Plaça Catalunya on our way to a tapas place that the guy who worked at our hostel recommended. The fountains in the square were really cool at night because they were lit in constantly changing colors.\n\nWe eventually made it to the tapas place and for a while were confused as to how go about eating there. There were tables in the back but also a big bar in the front that had a large case showing all the different types of food you could order. We stood by the bar and eventually two people left and we just sat down, even though I feel like we probably cut some sort of line. Tapas is a very traditional style of eating in Spain in which you oder a lot of small dishes, often sharing with other people. We got a bunch of different things, all of which were really good and it was a really fun experience to sit at the bar and just see something that looked god and tell the waiter, “Bring us one of those as well!”\n\nOn our way back to our hostel we passed a bar called Obama Gastropub that had a bronze statue of Barack Obama sitting on a bench outside the front door!\n\nAfter getting back to the hostel we hung out and met the other people staying there. At around 11:30 every night the hostel has a free “bar crawl” where they take you to a bar and then to a club. The nightlife in Barcelona is crazy! People don’t go to the clubs until 1 or 2 in the morning and if you come back before 4 AM its an early night! The bar we went to that night was really cool. It was called Espit Chupitos and it is known for having over 400 different kinds of shots, each with some sort of elaborate preparation or delivery method and all of them are only €2. One of the cool ones I saw people do was called The Boy Scout. They gave each person the shot and a skewer with a marshmallow on it. Then they squirted some liquid on the bar and lit in on fire, everyone roasted their marshmallows in the flames, dipped it in the shot, ate the marshmallow and then took the shot.\n\nAfter the bar we went to a club right next door which had two different floors and three different rooms, each playing different types of music so you could move around depending on what you were looking for. We didn’t get back until around 3:30 or 4 I think, which, as I said before, is considered early for going out in Barcelona!\n\nThe next day we woke up on the later side after having been out so late the night before. We went to a restaurant around the corner to get some lunch before going on a free walking tour of the old city of Barcelona that was advertised by our hostel. My roommate and I split Pica-Pica for lunch, which was basically a large platter of assorted items including a tortilla, or Spanish omelette, a variety of cured meats, black pudding, two other kinds of sausage, a baked potato, manchego cheese, hearts of palm, and hard boiled eggs. We also got a pitcher of sangria. It was a ton of food and most of it was pretty good.\n\nAfter lunch we walked down to the meeting point for the walking tour near the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona. The first stop on our walking tour was the Plaça del Rei which is surrounded by the Palau Reial Major. This served as the palace of the Catalan Counts from the 13th to the 15th centuries. Our tour guide stopped in the square and gave us a brief history of Barcelona and Catalonia. Catalonia is the region of modern Spain that is located in the northeastern corner of the country, with the city of Barcelona serving as its capitol. It has a very interesting history due to the many different cultural influences that have been present in the region. The region originally belonged to the Franks, but in the 9th century it was basically given autonomy under Count William the Hairy who established a hereditary line of succession. He was allowed to do this as drove away the Muslim forces that were threatening the Frankish territories and thus, Catalonia served as a buffer between the Western and Eastern worlds at the time. For a few hundred years it Catalonia remained independent. In the 12th century, Catalonia united with the Kingdom of Aragon by marriage of the royal families. In the 15th century, King Ferdinand II of Aragon married Queen Isabella I of Castile, uniting the two powerful kingdoms in what is now modern day Spain. Most of the power was held in Castile and eventually the Catalonian people were not happy about living under Castilian rule. In the 17th century Catalonia revolted and had a brief period where it was a republic under French rule. In the early 18th century, Catalonia sided with the French against the Bourbon Philip V of Spain, who won the war and reconquered all of the Catalonian territory. He essentially abolished all non-Castilian culture, including the Catalan language, and Catalonia has not been independent since. This complicated history is very important in understanding the city of Barcelona and Catalonia as a whole. Catalonia and Barcelona have gone through waves of immense wealth and power, and incredible humiliation and persecution and understanding this history helps you to understand the culture of the city and the different elements that make Catalonia so unique today.\n\nNext we walked to The Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Saint Eulalia, better known as Barcelona Cathedral. Our tour guide told us about a few of the patron saints of Barcelona and how important they are to the city. There are constantly festivals and parades going on in the city and its usually for a saints day. Saint Eulalia was a 13 year old martyr who was tortured and killed rather than renounce her faith. Another major saint in Barcelona is Saint George. The story goes that a dragon was terrorizing the city and the only way to placate it was by feeding it young, virgin girls. Eventually the only girl left was the princess so the King looked for someone who could slay the dragon. Many warriors failed but eventually Saint George prevailed. The blood from the dragon fell onto the earth and red roses sprouted up from the ground. This is why the dragon and the rose are two of the symbols of the city of Barcelona. The funny thing is that Saint George is the patron saint of a lot of cities and towns in the Spain and each one has a sightly different story about what happened and each claims that it happened in their city or town. It is also said that Wilfred the Hairy slayed a dragon as well, a story which is depicted in a carving on one of the exterior walls of the church. The church itself is very different from many of the others in Barcelona as it is actually modeled off of a French design. The style of churches in Barcelona is not usually as focused on grandeur and height as Gothic churches in other parts of Europe, so this church clearly differs from the classic Barcelona style.\n\nNext our tour guide spoke to us about some of the other things in the square right in front of the Cathedral. One was a piece of a old Roman aqueduct left from the original Roman settlement in the area. Some of the construction is original while others date from different periods. You can see the different size and style of bricks indicating different times when it was reconstructed.\n\nAcross the square from it was big carving in a building that was designed by Picasso. While he was not born in Barcelona, he spent about 10 years there and had a real connection to the city. Unfortunately, he never returned to Barcelona once he moved to Paris because he said he wouldn’t go back to Spain until Franco was no longer in power, which didn’t happen until after he died. This piece was actually drawn on a napkin that he sent to a friend to have put up in the city. It depicts the old Catalonian traditional game of constructed human pyramids. Every year there are competitions associated with festivals where groups of people try to construct the tallest tower of people, called a Castell.\n\nNext we walked through the Gothic Quarter of Barcelona, which is the center of the old city of Barcelona and is made up of little streets that intertwine and sometimes meet up in small squares. It really feels like a different place when you are walking in those small alleys as opposed to walking down La Rambla. We eventually wound up in a small square called Plaça Sant Felip Neri which contains the church by the same name. It was a beautiful square, shaded by a large tree in the center, and was actually one of the favorite spots of the famous architect, Antoni Gaudi. Despite its serene and beautiful nature now, the square has a pretty gruesome history. In 1938, Franco’s planes dropped bombs on the city and one of them landed in the square, killing 42 people, many of which were children who had come from the school next door to take shelter in the air raid bunker under the church. The buildings have been renovated but the lower portions of the walls were left with the damage from the bombings as a reminder of what occurred there. The school still exists to this day.\n\nNext we went to Plaça Sant Jaume, which basically housing the government of Barcelona and Catalonia. On two side of the square, facing each other, are the Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya and the City Hall of Barcelona. The Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya houses the government of the region of Catalonia, including the offices of the Presidency of the Generalitat. The city hall, located across the square, is the home of the city government of Barcelona. On the city wall, a large banner was hanging that read “Refugees Welcome”, which I thought was a nice change of rhetoric from what I was used to hearing in the US. The Palau de la Generalitat has a large statue of Saint George slaying the dragon above the front door.\n\nNext we walked by what at first looked like a random modern art sculpture in the middle of a square. It looked like a giant tower made of a chain-link fence. Then our tour guide told us that it was actually constructed as a monument to the tallest of the human towers, or Castell, ever built. It was built to the exact same height as the record holding tower. She also told us that the very top person on the tower is usually a five year old boy, because they are lighter! When you see how high this sculpture is, you start to think about a five year old kid at the top of it and its pretty crazy!\n\nNext we walked by the same church that we had seen the night before, Santa Maria del Mar, and stood in the Fossar de les Moreres, a memorial square to the soldiers who died in the Siege of Barcelona in 1714. During the War of the Spanish Succession, King Phillip V of Spain was fighting Archduke Charles of Austria over who was going to take the crown of the holy Roman Empire. Barcelona saw this as a way to get out from under Castilian control and decided to back Charles. In 1714, King Phillip broke through the city walls of Barcelona and defeated the Catalonians, killing many in the process. This day is still remembered every September 11 as the National Day of Catalonia as they see it as a testament to their desire for independence from Spain and Castilian rule. The square itself is actually built over the cemetery where the defenders of the city were buried after the siege. This marked a very low point in the history of Barcelona and Catalonia as Catalonian culture was outlawed and the city would not rebound for about 100 years. Eventually in the 19th century, Barcelona became an important center of industry and trade and began to come out of the dark period that followed the siege in 1714. This resurgence culminated in the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition where the city got to show itself off to the world as a modern, important center for commerce and culture. Many of the most important artistic and architectural parts of the city come from the period right before or after this event, including all of Gaudi’s works.\n\nAfter finishing up the walking tour, my friend and I decided to head to Park Güell, a famous park, designed by Antoni Gaudi, on the top of a hill overlooking the city. We took the metro to the closest station and then you have to walk up the hill to the park. Towards the top of the hill there are actually escalators that will take you up. We actually entered the park from the top and sort of did it backwards, rather than entering fro the main entrance. Immediately upon entering the park you come to an overlook with gorgeous panoramic views of the entire city.\n\nAfter snapping some photos we walked up to the highest part of the park, Turó de Tres Creus (Hill of Three Crosses) where Gaudi built a stone structure topped by three crosses that you can climb onto and get an even more amazing view (if thats possible) of the city.\n\nAfter admiring the view for a bit we walked won the path toward the main area of the park. The area at the bottom of the park is where Gaudi’s work is really evident in the buildings, colonnades, viaducts and other contractions that are just unlike anything I’ve ever seen before. We followed the path down onto the main terrace of the park that has a curved bench bannister, decorated with mosaics, wrapping around it.\n\nNext we went down below the terrace to The Hypostyle Room, or the area underneath where 86 columns supported the terrace. Each column is placed at the intersection of four little domed indentations in the ceiling that allows rain water collected in the square above to be funneled through the columns and into a reservoir that is located underneath the room. This is something that is really cool about Gaudi as he makes these very intricate, really cool looking buildings, that are also functionally really amazing as well!\n\nIn front of the terrace are stairs with some mosaic statues, including Gaudi’s famous mosaic salamander known as “el drac” or “the dragon”.\n\nAfterwards we walked around the rest of the park that we hadn’t seen yet. It was all so cool and unique!\n\nAfter walking around basically the entire park we headed back toward our hostel. On the way we stopped at La Boqueria market again and picked up some jamón, olives and manchego as a little appetizer before eating dinner at our hostel. That night we went out again with our hostel, first to a sports bar and then to a club that played techno music. While the music wasn’t exactly my favorite it was still a very fun night!\n\nAfter staying out very late again the night before, we again got off to a later start. We basically started off the day by taking the metro down toward the water and getting lunch at a place I had found called Restaurant 7 Portes, which was supposed to have very good paella. Turns out, the reviews I read weren’t lying…they did! We got “The Rich Man’s Paella”, which is called that because all of the seafood is already shelled so you don’t have to do any work. Even though I am not a huge fan of some of the staples in seafood paella (mussels, octopus, squid, etc.), it was still really good! We also got a pitcher of sangria, which was also great! Also, fun fact about paella: it is called paella because that is the name of the traditional pan it is made in.\n\nAfter lunch my friend and I went on a Gaudi walking tour of Barcelona that was offered by the same company that we had done the other walking tour with the day before. This one focused on the Modernisme movement and especially on the works of Antoni Gaudi. The Modernisme movement was an art movement that was centered in Barcelona and Catalonia in the late 19th and early 20th century and its best known for its iconic architecture. It is similar to Art Nouveau and other movements that were happening at the same time in other places, but it had a definitive element of Catalonian pride and a desire to revive Catalonian culture. The movement became popular right as Barcelona was on the upswing, becoming a relevant and important city again in the eyes of the world. Barcelona was expanding, the Eixample district was being built, and thus there was a lot of opportunity for the movement to leave its mark on the new architecture that was needed to build the new parts of the city. Our tour began in Plaça Catalunya which is really where one of the main streets of the Eixample, Passeig de Gràcia, begins. It was built around the time of the Barcelona Universal Exposition and many of the most famous Modernisme buildings are located on it. The first piece of Modernisme art that our tour guide pointed out was not a building, but the tiles that lined the sidewalks along the street. They were actually designed by Gaudi as one of his first major projects. One of the main highlights of the Modernisme movement and especially Gaudi’s works is the influence of nature. The tiles make up different patterns that resemble flowers and seashells, directly calling on the theme of nature. Also, with Barcelona being an important port and seaside city, the inclusion of the seashell pattern in the tiles was an homage to Catalonian pride, another major element of the Modernisme movement.\n\nThe first building we saw was called Casa Lleó Morera, and it was designed by Lluís Domènech i Montaner, one of the other most influential architects in the Modernisme movement. Each of the buildings we saw on Passeig de Gràcia were originally built as single family homes for some of the wealthiest families in Barcelona. The houses were meant to show off the status of the family to all of the people who would be walking along Passeig de Gràcia. Our tour guide told us that there are three elements that are almost always included and highlighted in Modernisme buildings, extensive used of wrought iron, nature and floral motifs, and images of dragons. All of these tie into one of the central themes of the movement, the iron representing the modern age, the flowers representing the connection to nature that was so important to the movement, and the dragons represent Catalan pride as they symbolize St. George, the Patron Saint of the city of Barcelona. This house included all three of the elements, with wrought iron fixtures outside the windows, an extensive use of flowers in the stonework, and carved dragons decorating the lower level. The women who commissioned the construction of the building asked Lluís Domènech i Montaner to construct large windows that overlooked the street so that people would be able to see in and be jealous of their opulent lifestyle. She also requested the placement of a large, very expensive pink marble column that could be seen through the windows. The column serves no structural purpose and is only there to show off her wealth. Also, on the balcony outside of one of the windows there are two sculpture of women, one using a gramophone and the other using a telephone. These were also used as a way to show off the family’s wealth by letting everyone know that they could afford to have those items, which would have been very expensive in the very beginning of the 20th century. Another very common element of Modernisme buildings is the use of Trencadís mosaic, or mosaics made from broken glazed ceramic pieces like tiles, and plates. This house doesn’t use much of this technique but there is one spot on the lower level where the architect created a floral Trencadís mosaic, basically stamping his house as a Modernisme building.\n\nThe next building that we saw, which was located just down the block, is called Casa Amatller, and was designed by Josep Puig i Cadafalch. This house was originally built for the Amatller family who owned a chocolate company. It also contains all of the three elements, with beautiful iron railings and decorations, lots of flowers, and a large sculpture of St. George slaying the dragon. The outside of the building was actually designed to look somewhat like a chocolate bar and there is actually still a chocolate shop inside on the first floor. I didn’t get a good picture of it but this house also has a sculpture of a rat holding a camera, which was designed to show off the wealth of the family on the facade of the house, just like the ones in the previous building. We went inside the first floor and the extensive decoration continued throughout the interior as well.\n\nThe house directly next door to Casa Amatller is called Casa Batlló and it was designed by Antoni Gaudi. It is known by many people as Casa Dels Ossos, or the House of Bones because of the skeletal looking facade. Many people say that the building was designed to look like a dragon, with the chimney at the top representing St. George’s lance piercing the dragon. The building makes some use of iron, but uses a lot of natural elements, a ton of Trencadís mosaic and the entire building looks like a dragon! It is one of the coolest and most unique buildings I have ever seen! One thing that defines Gaudi’s buildings is that there are almost no straight lines whatsoever as he saw them as unnatural. Thus, almost every surface is curved or bent in some way.\n\nNext our tour guide pointed out the Modernisme style wrought iron street lamps and Trencadís mosaic benches that lined Passeig de Gràcia. On the top of the lamps there is an iron bat as their creation was funded by the Bacardi family and that is their logo.\n\nThe last building we saw before heading to the Sagrada Familia was Casa Milà, Gaudi’s last work before he devoted himself to the Sagrada Familia full-time. Unlike Casa Batlló with its colorful facade, Casa Milà is completely white from the outside. It has an undulating exterior which again has no straight lines. Similar to the “lance” chimney on Casa Batlló, Casa Milà has multiple Trencadís mosaic chimneys on the roof, each shaped in a three dimensional cross. Gaudi was an extremely religious man and he also loved to work in three dimensions, so he often used the three dimensional cross rather than the usual two dimension one. He was known sometimes not to draw blueprints, but rather to build models because he believed that things needed to be planned three dimensionally, rather than on a flat piece of paper. The building also has religious words and phrases on the exterior wall, just below the roof. You can actually buy an apartment inside this building which are apparently really cool because Gaudi was able to build the structure without needing internal supporting walls, so the walls in the apartments can be moved around and rearranged in many different configurations. One fun fact about Gaudi and this building in particular is that the shape of one of the other chimneys (not the cross shaped ones) inspired George Lucas’ design for the Stormtrooper helmets in Star Wars.\n\nAfter finishing up with the buildings on Passeig de Gràcia we hopped on the metro with our tour guide and took it to the Sagrada Familia. The Sagrada Familia is the most famous work by Antoni Gaudi even though it is still incomplete more than 130 years after construction began. Work on the Basilica started in 1882 and Gaudi took over the project soon after, in 1883. Unfortunately, Gaudi died in 1926, when he was tragically hit by a tram and passed away a few days later. Many incidents have caused delays in the construction of the church, the most prevalent being the Spanish Civil War and the fascist government under General Franco. He saw the Sagrada Familia as a symbol of Catalonian pride and did everything he could to slow its progress. They have announced that they plan to complete the church by 2026 for the 100th anniversary of Gaudi’s death. Even though it is incomplete, it was consecrated in 2010 by Pope Benedict XVI and thus masses can already be held there. When completed, the Sagrada Familia will have three facades, two of which are already finished. The Nativity facade is the oldest and was constructed during Gaudi’s lifetime. It depicts the birth of Jesus as well as nature and symbols of life. Gaudi wanted this facade to be painted in many colors to make it feel more joyous and alive and our tour guide told us that this is still the plan but they want to do it at the end so that the paint is fresh for the completion of the church. Opposite the Nativity Facade is the Passion Facade, depicting Jesus’ crucifixion and ascension to heaven. This side is much more serious and lacks the joyous nature of the Nativity facade. It has lots of rigid, harsh, straight lines which evoke a lot of emotion but are very much unlike Gaudi’s other work. Construction on the church follows Gaudi’s design, but many of his models and drawings were damaged or destroyed in 1936 by Catalan anarchists who saw the Church as a symbol of the church and by relation, of Franco. Thus, while they are following his plan to the best of their ability, it is impossible to know exactly how much of his vision is being exactly recognized. He apparently did want to include straight lines in the Sagrada Familia as he wanted to encompass many different architectural styles. The final facade, the Glory Facade, which is going to be the most extravagant and majestic, has really yet to be started. It will depict the “road to god” and salvation through a depiction of the seven deadly sins and seven heavenly virtues. It will serve as the main facade of the church and will lead directly into the nave. Its construction requires the demolition of the entire block of buildings that occupy the space across the street from the church. This is one way in which Franco slowed the construction of the church as he had the buildings built around it to make things more difficult for them. In addition to the three facades, the church will also have 12 spires, one for each Apostle, of which eight are completed; the four on each of the two completed facades. Taller than these will be a spire for the Virgin Mary and then even taller than that will be four spires for the four evangelists. Lastly, the largest and tallest spire will be for Jesus and it will be mounted by a giant cross. It will be 170 meters tall, or one meter shorter than Montjuïc hill, the highest hill in Barcelona, as Gaudi believed that the greatness of his creations should not surpass those of God. Once this spire is completed it will make the Sagrada Familia the tallest church in the world.\n\nAfter walking around the Sagrada Familia for a while, the tour ended and we were going to try to go inside. When we went to go buy tickets that suggested that we come back another day because it was closing in 45 minutes and they suggest that you have at least an hour to see it. We took their advice and decided to come back another day. Instead, we went back to Casa Batlló and went inside there. The inside was even cooler than the outside was! All the themes from the facade were carried through to the interior design. There were virtually no straight lines in the entire house and everything was really interestingly designed, yet everything was super functional at the same time. When you first look at Gaudi’s work, it seems like he made most of his choices based on ascetics, but in reality, his designs are incredibly structurally sound and are very practical as well.\n\nThat night thinks took a slight turn for the worse. I went out with the rest of the people from my hostel and at some point in the night I lost my cellphone, only realizing that it was gone when I got back to the hostel. I have heard of at least 5 people I’ve met abroad who have had their phones and sometimes even wallets stolen in Barcelona but honestly, I’m gonna chalk this one up to a little too much drinking and being pretty stupid. Luckily I was with my roommate who had a phone and I brought my computer so I could still communicate with my parents, but it felt pretty shitty. I beat myself up over it for a while the next day but I tried not to ruin the rest of my trip. I also had luckily brought a camera with me so I could still take pictures, and my phone had synced before I lost it so I didn’t lose any pictures. It was quite an expensive mistake but at least it was only material and nothing worse happened.\n\nThe next day after I stopped moping a bit we got our day started by going to lunch at a place called La Xampanyeria in the El Born district of the city. It is known for their sandwiches and Cava (Spanish sparkling wine) all served to customers who are standing up eating at the counter. I got a sandwich with jamón, cheese, onions and peppers which they heat up on a flattop grill. It was amazing and so cheap. I also got some sort of rosé cava. The guy who worked there spoke almost no english so I kind of just nodded and got whatever he gave me.\n\nAfter eating lunch we walked over to Montjuïc, which is a mountain in Barcelona that overlooks the city. The name actually translates to “Jew Mountain”, but I don’t actually know why. At the top of the mountain is Montjuïc Castle, a fortress that was built in the 17th century and served as a lookout and fortification to protect the city. There had been a lookout tower on the site since the 11th century to warn the city of an incoming siege. It also played a big role in suppressing the people of Barcelona under the rule of Castile and later Franco. It was used as a prison and was the site where Lluís Companys, President of the Generalitat de Catalunya, was executed in 1940 during the Spanish Civil War. We walked all the way up the hill, which was quite the trek as it is the highest part of the city, and went in to the castle. The castle was pretty cool and it had amazing views of the city.\n\nAfter walking around the castle we started to walk down Montjuïc Hill. On our way down we walked through the Anella Olímpica, the complex of stadiums built for the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. The stadium area was very cool and you were allowed to walk around the whole thing.\n\nAfter walking around the Olympic Stadiums we headed down Montjuïc to go back to the Sagrada Familia to see the inside. On our way down the hill we passed the Museu Nacional d’Art de Catalunya, the Catalonian Art Museum, which has the “Magic Fountain” in front of it. At certain times the fountain does an elaborate show but unfortunately we didn’t get to see it.\n\nAfter getting to the bottom of the hill we took the metro over to the Sagrada Familia. As beautiful as the outside is, it is nothing compared to the inside of the church. I honestly think that it is the most amazing building I have ever been inside in my life. The pictures don’t really even do it justice. The interior was designed to look like a forest, with the columns serving as the trees. The light coming through the stained glass windows bathe the interior in many different colors. If you do one thing in the entire city of Barcelona, it should be going to the Sagrada Familia!\n\nAfter walking around literally in awe for a while inside the church we went to see some of the other parts of the church, including the small building that served as Gaudi’s office as well as a school for the local children and children of the workers on the church, the museum displaying the history of the construction, and the crypt where Gaudi is buried.\n\nAfter we saw everything we could at the Sagrada Familia we headed back to our hostel. We got dinner and went out with people from the hostel that night.\n\nThe next day we woke up and went to Sitges, a beach town that is about a 30 minute train ride from Barcelona. We got a little later start than we had wanted to and we had a little trouble figuring out exactly how to get there, but eventually we made it. The weather was a bit chilly for the beach, but the town was very pretty and we still had a good time. We had lunch at a little restaurant right by the beach and then walked up the beach and around the town before heading back to Barcelona.\n\nWhen we got back to Barcelona we walked around the waterfront and up Las Ramblas again. We went back to La Boqueria market and got some bread, cheese, jamón, and olives for dinner. We didn’t go out because we needed to wake up early the next morning to head to the airport.\n\nAfter an amazing trip it was finally time to head back to Florence. When I got back I had about a day and a half there during which I worked my two shifts at Ganzo, before I left again on a trip to Croatia and Slovenia."
