        "text": "I have always had an interest in Architecture. In fact I was almost an architecture major but I decided that my appreciation for architecture was not enough for me to want to be an architect. Barcelona has reminded me how much I enjoy simply observing buildings. Every corner you turn here there is another amazing building; the key is to look up. Since the buildings are so old most of them contain statues in the corners, or balconies with beautiful ornamentation.\n\nThe amazing part about Barcelona’s architecture is everything is reused and renovated, it seems that no space goes to waste. The old Hospital Sant Pau was built in 1410 now houses the National Library of Catalonia. The newer Hospital Sant Pau is currently under renovation to become a museum and cultural center, and so Barcelona built its newest Hospital San Pau right next door. The Sagrada Familia is still under going construction, and the Roman Ruins have been converted into parts of markets and museums. Everything seems to be exposed and yet hidden all at the same time.\n\nBarcelona has a large range of Architecture because it has been around for many centuries, and before it was an established city, many groups tried to take over the area. This created the many different building types in Barcelona. Barcelona’s most famous architect is Antoni Gaudi. Gaudi is the essence of the Art Nouveau movement in Catalonia called Modernisme. While walking the streets of Barcelona any building built after about 1900 has some touch of Gaudi in it. Gaudi’s main works are Casa Batllo, Casa Mila, Park Guell, and the Sagrada Familia. When visiting Barcelona it is essential to at least see the outside of all of these buildings, and definitely go visit Park Guell.\n\nAntoni Gaudi was born in Tarragona, and grew up in Spain. He was a devout catholic, so much so that he devoted his later years solely to the Christian Faith in the making of the Sagrada Familia. If we look at any of Gaudi’s works there is a huge importance placed on nature. This is because Gaudi believed that by working with nature he was working with the Creator, god, and so all of his works show the natural curves of nature rather than geometric shapes.\n\nCasa Batllo, or House of Bones, is Gaudi’s earliest famous work. It was built from 1904 to 1906 and is located at Passeig de Gracia, 43. It is located on the Block of Discord, which is a well-known block because it has four famous architects buildings right next to each other. It starts with Lluís Domènech i Montaner’s Casa Lleó-Morera, then comes Enric Sagnier’s Casa Mulleras, next is Josep Puig i Cadafalch’s Casa Amatller, and last is Antoni Gaudí’s Casa Batllo. Casa Batllo is called the House of Bones because the façade has a rather skeletal feel. The façade also has a beautiful trencadis design that starts in a golden orange color and moves into a blue and green color. Trencadis is a type of mosaic created from broken tile shards, a style Gaudi really enjoyed using. As many buildings in Barcelona, there is some recognition to Saint George. On the roof of Casa Batllo is a large arch that as the story goes is supposed to be the dragon’s tail that Saint George kills. Casa Batllo is in walking distance from Casa Mila.\n\nCasa Mila, also known as La Pedrera (Catalan for The Query), was built between 1905 and 1910 and it is located at Passeig de Gracia, 91 in the Eixample district. During this time period it was common for houses to be named after the owner, the owner of Casa Mila was Pere Mila. Pere Mila saw Casa Batllo and then asked Gaudi to commission a building for himself. This building was originally planned to be a religious structure, but the government at the time disagreed with many of the religious aspects and so Gaudi’s original plan was not followed. One of the amazing features of this building is that there is not one straight line. By not using load-bearing walls (what normal buildings use), Gaudi used a combination of arches, pillars, and steel so that he could create a much more irregular floor plan. The outside of the building is noticeable because it looks almost like a wave. Since it is hard to get light to the inside of the structure Gaudi built two courtyards in which cars used to be able to drive into. The roof terrace is another stunning feature of this building. It has many chimneys that look as if they have faces on them, as well as bench that one can sit at to look out all over Barcelona.\n\nPark Guell is not a building, but a park that Gaudi designed, built from 1900 to 1914 and it is located in the Gracia district of Barcelona. Originally this site was built for a housing complex inspired by the English Garden City movement. There was supposed to be sixty triangular lots for luxury housing, but only two were built, one house was Gaudi’s home from 1906 – 1926. There are many remarkable features and structures in this park. When you walk in the main entrance there are two buildings with odd-shaped rooftops and beautiful trencadis coloring. As you keep walking straight in, you come across a famous statue/fountain in the park, the dragon. Keep walking in and you end up in a cooler covered structure with mosaics both on the ceilings and floor. A fun thing to do is put your camera on the floor and take a self-timed picture of you and your friends with the mosaics of the ceiling in the center. The next thing you will find is a road leading up to the look out point. This road is covered with inverted arches that look like tree trunks. On the wall opposite the tree trunks are little “nests” were many people like to take pictures. As you reach the look out area it can be noted that the set up is rather odd, the bench is curved again in a wave-like shape. This is purposefully done in order to create privacy for each group of people.\n\nGaudi’s last project was the Sagrada Familia. This is his most famous work, and it is not even completed. The Sagrada Familia started being built in 1882, but Gaudi only got involved in 1883, in 1926 when he died less than a quarter of the project was finished. Its projected finish date is 2026 but it hard because the building of the Sagrada Familia is relying on very small funds. In 1936 the construction of the Sagrada Familia came to a halt because of the Spanish Civil War and with this some of Gaudi’s original construction plans were lost as well. The building has three main facades – the Nativity façade, the Passion façade and the Glory façade. The Nativity façade was constructed between 1894 and 1930 and it is dedicated to the birth of Jesus. This façade faces the rising sun to the northeast, another symbol of Jesus’ birth. It is divided into three porticos – hope, faith, and charity. The Passion façade is much more plain and simple. It is dedicated to Christ’s suffering and this shown thought the depiction of his skeletal body. This façade faces the setting sun, indicating the death of Christ. The Glory façade is the largest façade and will be the principal façade with access to the central nave. This façade will depict the road of God to show that those who do not choose his path will end up in a worse off place. Construction on this façade began in 2002.\n\nAntoni Gaudi has shaped the architecture of Barcelona, which has shaped Barcelona as a city. When the Sagrada Familia is finally finished it will be the end of Gaudi’s era. Who will come next?"
