        "text": "I’ve said it before in my main post about Barcelona: this wonderful city has its own unique style, and it is in part because of modernisme, the Catalan art neouveau. This artistic movement was born in the end of the 19th century around the time of the First Barcelona World Fair, and it was used as a representative of Catalan identity. This movement is best known by the works of Antoni Gaudí. Although Gaudí’s work is fantastic, Barcelona is full of other examples of this unique style. For this, I have prepared a route around the city consisting of what I think are the best examples of modernisme in Barcelona.\n\nThis route is MASSIVE so I have divided it in different areas of the city. There is no need to follow the full route, you can take in one area, several or just visit those buildings you find more interesting. If you plan to have a modernism-focused day, you can follow the route marked with a line in the map (which covers sections 1 to 5).\n\nTravel tip: use the interactive map to guide yourself through the route and click on the names of the buildings in the Post Contents box to find a description and picture of each of them.\n\n* Since I need to maintain Feast of Travel, it is likely that this post contains affiliate links. It does not affect you in any way, but if you want to read more about it, you can have a look at the Trusted companies page.\n\n1. Sagrada Família and Hospital de Sant Pau\n\nSagrada Família\n\nThis route can work both ways, so it is up to you to decide where to start. The first or last stop is Sagrada Família, the unfinished masterpiece by Antoni Gaudí. I suggest to start or finish in Sagrada Família in case you want to visit the interior, which has the best lighting in the morning (10-11.30 am) or the afternoon (5-6 pm). You can buy your tickets and skip the line here, get access to the tower or have a guided tour, and keep reading about this wonderful monument in my dedicated post:\n\n→ Modernisme in Barcelona through Gaudí: Sagrada Família\n\nHospital de Sant Pau i la Santa Creu\n\nThe second stop in the area is Hospital de Sant Pau i la Santa Creu, a hospital built between 1901 and 1930 by Lluís Domènech i Montaner. In my opinion, this is one of the most beautiful complexes in the city and in the world, and one of the highest representatives of the modernism movement. The hospital stopped functioning in 2009 and now can be visited. You can purchase your tickets here or get a guided tour of the site.\n\nCasa Planells\n\nCasa Planells is a very strange building designed by Josep Maria Jujol i Gibert, pupil of Antoni Gaudí, and it is considered the very last piece of modernism in Barcelona.\n\nPhoto credit: Amadalvarez with CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nPalau Macaya\n\nPalau Macaya is a house built by Josep Puig i Cadafalch in 1901. Its white façade with two towers and elaborate decorations are a beautiful addition to the important street Passeig de Sant Joan. Today, this beautiful building tries to bring together the citizens and the movement by organizing sessions with volunteers to promote the value of the building and modernism.\n\nPhoto credit: Peter with CC BY-NC 2.0\n\nPhoto credit: Josep Bracons with CC BY-SA 2.0\n\n2. Dreta de l’Eixample\n\nChurch of Sant Francesc de Sales\n\nThe Church of Sant Francesc de Sales, which also contains a nun convent, is a hybrid between neogothic and modernist styles created by Gaudí’s mentor Joan Martorell i Montells.\n\nCasa Llopis Bofill\n\nCasa Llopis Bofill also called La Casa de les Mosques (the House of Flies) is a beautiful building designed by Antoni Maria Gallisà i Soqué in 1902 with iconic sgraffiti by Josep Maria Jujol with floral and insect motifs. This is one of my favourite modernist buildings in the city.\n\nPhoto credit: Ajuntament Barcelona with CC BY-ND 2.0\n\nMercat de la Concepció\n\nThis beautiful modernist market (where I’ve done my groceries for most of my life) is also called Mercat de les Flors (Market of Flowers) because of the notorious flower stand at the entrance in Carrer de València. Designed by Antoni Rovira i Trias, it has the iconic characteristics of the modernist markets: iron structure that support the roof of green and red tiles.\n\nTravel tip: although it’s not the cheapest market in the city, it has some of the best produce. It’s a good place to buy some snacks for the day or an edible souvenir!\n\nPhoto credit: Gerhidt with CC BY-SA 4.0\n\nConservatori Municipal de Música de Barcelona\n\nThe CMMB is the conservatory (music school) of the city.

This street contains two of the most important works by the king of modernism Antoni Gaudí: Casa Batlló and La Pedrera. What most people don’t know is that the street itself is full of gems designed by the architect. The tiles on the floor were originally designed for Casa Batlló and later for La Pedrera and they mimick the sea bottom. The street lamps and the stone benches were also designed by Gaudí.\n\nPhoto credit: TumbleCow under license CC BY-SA 3.0.\n\nCasa Fuster\n\nCasa Fuster is a pristine work of modernism that sits atop of Passeig de Gràcia.

It was built in 1908 for a choral society (Orfeó Català), which was leading in the Catalant movement Renaixença.

The mix of iron, stone and glass with the green of the plants inside gives it a very beautiful touch.\n\nCastell dels Tres Dragons\n\nThe Castle of the Three Dragons was originally built as a café-restaurant for the 1888 Universal Exposition by Lluís Domènech i Montaner. It reminds of the early work of Domènech i Muntanter at the Fundació Antoni Tàpies with the naked brick and iron.
