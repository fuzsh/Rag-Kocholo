Casa Lleó Morera stands on the corner of Passeig de Gràcia and Career del Consell de Cent. Look up high, peering through the tree greenery that tries to conceal this architectural delight. Even in a summer that has scorched many leaves into brown crumbs, it was hard to see the colourful interior of the tempietto so far above the street.\n\nThis remodelling of this family home was carried out between 1902 and early 1906 by Domènech i Montaner, with many of the ornate sculptural details being the work of Eusebio Arnau. In summer 1906, in Barcelona’s Annual Building Competition, the Casa Lleó i Morera was awarded the prize for the best artistic building of 1905.\n\nMuch of the iron work reflects the building’s name, Lleó (lion) Morera (mulberry), On the first floor balcony, there are four nymphs, each carrying a new twentieth century invention: camera, lightbulb, phonograph and telephone.\n\nUnfortunately, the building is not open to the public so the best I can offer is a little peak from my photos, and an online virtual tour over here.\n\n–\n\nCopyright Debbie Smyth, 20 August 2018"
