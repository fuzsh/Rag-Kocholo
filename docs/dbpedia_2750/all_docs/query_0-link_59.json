        "text": "Barcelona is a city filled with many architectural treasures. One of the most prominent styles to be observed in the urban landscape is that of Catalan modernisme. Inspired by brilliant artists like Antoni Gaudí and other visionary architects, the modernist movement has clearly left its mark on the city.\n\nIf you’re visiting Barcelona soon, or if you live here and haven’t seen everything the city has to offer yet, ShBarcelona invites you to visit the following modernist buildings in the city. We are absolutely sure you’re going to enjoy yourself!\n\n10 Examples of modernist architecture in Barcelona\n\nCasa Vicens Gaudí\n\nWe start our route with one of Gaudí’s oldest works, Casa Vicens. It was built between 1883 and 1888, and this house is a perfect example of the architect’s creative mind. It was declared a UNESCO heritage site, and Casa Vicens will surely mesmerize you with its colourful and mosaic façade that found its inspiration in both nature and geometric shapes.\n\nThe interior surprises as well, with meticulous details and the marvellous effect of the natural light entering the house. Walking through its corridors will undoubtedly transport you to a world where fantasy goes hand in hand with unparalleled beauty.\n\nCasa Les Punxes\n\nContinue your walk by visiting the mysterious Casa de les Punxes, also called Casa Terradas. It was designed by Josep Puig i Cadafalch and built between 1903 and 1905. The house shows a red brick façade with pointy towers reminding you of a medieval building style.\n\nThis unique architectural design with its lavish ornaments will make you feel like you’ve ended up in a fairy tale. Besides the interesting façade, its terrace also offers mighty spectacular views of the city.\n\nCasa Comalat\n\nThis next building is the heart of what Catalan modernisme represents. Casa Comalat is one of the best examples of Salvador Valeri i Pupurull’s extraordinary talent. The building was constructed between 1909 and 1911, and it stands out for its richly decorated façade with colourful ceramics and sculptures. These details capture the true essence of Barcelona’s modernist architecture.\n\nEvery little detail, from the wrought-iron balustrades to the beautiful stained-glass windows, reflects the dedication and skill of the craftsmen who were involved in the construction of this masterpiece. Casa Comalat is a special oasis of beauty in the midst of the hectic city that Barcelona can feel like. It’s therefore a must-see if you love Modernisme.\n\nCasa Ferran Guardiola\n\nAnother witness of Catalan modernisme design in Barcelona is Casa Ferran Guardiola. It’s the work of architect Juan Guardiola, and it was originally a home built for the architect’s brother, Ferran Guardiola, in 1929. It stands out for its elegant and sophisticated character. The interior of Casa Ferran Guardiola, however, is also impressive because of its combination of classical and modernist decorations.\n\nIn addition to the architectural value of the building, it’s also protected by the IPAC (the Bé Integrant del Patrimoni Arquitectònic de Catalunya).\n\nRelated article: 2 Days in Barcelona: What to See and Do\n\nCasa Sayrach\n\nOne of the later constructed modernist buildings in Barcelona is Casa Sayrach. It was built between 1918 and 1920 and is located on the Avinguda Diagonal. It features an impressive design combined with detailed ornaments. The work was originally designed by Gabriel Borell, but executed by Manual Sayrach.\n\nSayrach, at the time of construction, hadn’t completed his degree yet, so he couldn’t have been the architect. Casa Sayrach is a clear example of the splendour and uniqueness of Catalan Modernisme.\n\nCasa Pàdua 75\n\nCasa Pàdua 75 was designed by Jeroni F. Granell, and it’s a true representative of Catalan Modernisme. It was built in 1903, and draws attention immediately because of its use of colour and uniqueness. The building once housed a perfume factory, and it stands out for its green and bright red coloured façade.\n\nCasa Pàdua 75 is a perfect example of how Catalan Modernisme wanted to break with traditional architecture. They wanted to create a new and unique style with innovative designs.\n\nCasa Batlló\n\nThis next architectural treasure, Casa Batlló and also designed by Antoni Gaudí, is another great example of Catalan Modernisme. At the request of Josep Batlló, it was remodelled by Gaudí between 1904 and 1906. Businessman Batlló was so fascinated by the result of the work, that he convinced his friend, Pedro Milà, to hire Antoni Gaudí to build the now famous Casa Milà.\n\nThe building, with a surface of 4,300 square meters distributed over six floors, is located on the Passeig de Gràcia. Check out its incredible façade, the exquisitely decorated windows from the inside, and the roof terrace on the top.\n\nCasa Milà\n\nCasa Milà, also known as La Pedrera, is a modernist building designed, yet again, by Antoni Gaudí. It’s located at the Passeig de Gràcia and built between 1906 and 1910. Ever since it opened its doors to the public, it has welcomed more than 20 million visitors.\n\nCasa Milà is a perfect demonstration of the architect’s naturalist period. It’s inspired by organic forms that can be found in nature, but it also shows tremendous creativity and imagination in ornamental details.\n\nCasa Amatller\n\nCasa Amatller can be found in the centre of Barcelona. It’s designed by Josep Puig i Cadafalch and built in 1898. The house shows what everyday life in the early twentieth century must have been like. Besides visiting the building, you can also check out the Amatller Chocolate museum. Who would say no to a delicious handmade chocolate?\n\nThe façade full of symbolism, the abundance of decorations, and the interior of Casa Amatller will feel like a time machine and take you back in time…\n\nCasa Lleó Morera\n\nThe last building on the route is Casa Lleó Morera created by architect Lluís Domènech i Muntaner. The building was constructed between 1902 en 1905, and it’s an exceptional illustration of Catalan Modernisme at its best. The façade with its impressive sculptures in all its detail are a tribute to nature and to human creativity.\n\nAlong with Casa Batlló and Casa Amatller, Casa Lleó Morera forms the Manzana de la Discordia de Barcelona. It represents elegance in all its glory."
