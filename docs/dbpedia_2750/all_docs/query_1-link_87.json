        "text": "If in a city as monumental as Barcelona we did not have a genius of Gaudí’s category, people would come from all over the world just to admire Domenech’s work.\n\nWhen Domènech i Montaner was completing the Castell dels Tres Dragons, which was the restaurant for the 1888 Universal Exhibition, he unveiled the essence of an architectural style defined by a blend of classic, historicist and traditional shapes with the colour and decorative symbolism of the buildings.\n\nOnly a humanist like Domènech i Montaner, who was also a historian, teacher, politician and architect, could epitomise the culmination of the modernista style in Catalonia, based on a modern architecture which reflected the Catalan national identity. Indeed, his commitment to the political and cultural Catalan movement, marked the life and work of this Barcelona-born architect. He is considered the master and founder of the modernista style and developed an innovative language based on the integration of all the arts.\n\nThis means that Domènech i Montaner’s private residences – such as the Casa Lleó Morera, the Casa Fuster and the Palau Montaner – and his most widely acclaimed public buildings, – including the Palau de la Musica and the wonderful Hospital Sant Pau complex, which have both been declared UNESCO World Heritage Sites – skilfully combine the refined modernista aesthetic with its sinuous curves, plant motifs, with increasingly light and rational formal, functional and modern structures.\n\nWe start the day at your hotel, apartment, airport or port at the time you wish and combine it well. In the heart of the city centre we found beautiful house Lleó Morera. In 1905, the family commissioned Lluís Domènech i Montaner to completely renovate the estate, built in 1864. The architect surrounded himself with the best artists and craftsmen, such as the sculptors Eusebi Arnau and Alfons Jujol or the glassmakers Rigalt and Granell, achieving a work of extraordinary beauty.\n\nVery close to Paseo de Gràcia, at the corner of calle Mallorca and Roger de Llúria, we find one of the few exempt palaces preserved in the Eixample. It is the Ramon de Montaner Palace, a curious eclectic Modernist building with an Italian air.\n\nOne year after the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exhibition, the architect Josep Domènech i Estapà was commissioned to build two luxurious residences for the two owners of Editorial Montaner i Simón. The palace for Ramon de Montaner began with Domènech i Estapà’s project, although it was later entrusted to the architect Lluís Domènech i Montaner.\n\nThe building has been the headquarters of the central government delegation in Barcelona since 1980.\n\nIn Mallorca street we will find the Thomas house, of a pure modernist style very decorated that fully houses the facades of the buildings of this part of the Eixample of Barcelona, and that synthesizes, in spite of the later modifications, the characteristics of its author, Lluís Domènech i Montaner.\n\nThe last Barcelona building by Lluís Domènech Montaner in Barcelona, which he built between 1908 and 1911 in collaboration with his son Pere Domènech i Roure, was the formidable gift that the rich Mallorcan Mariano Fuster wanted to give his wife, Consol Fabra, the Casa Fuster. The whole house forms a complex with a certain neo-Gothic air and a modernism of contained expressiveness. In fact, the beauty of the building is due to the use of very expensive noble materials, such as the white marble on the façade, glass or slate.\n\nDomènech Montaner left his mark on the characteristic pink columns at the base, the three-lobed windows and the classic floral decoration.\n\nFrom here we will go to the popularly known “Hospital de Sant Pau“, where we will make an in-depth visit. Formed by a central building and numerous adjacent pavilions, constituting one of the largest modernist complexes.\n\nOne of the most characteristic elements of this building is the use of exposed brick, as well as the mixture of different architectural styles. In 1997 it was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\n\nAfter a good visit what better than a good meal.\n\n1902 Cafè Modernista is the meeting point par excellence for lovers of culture, modernism and the most authentic gastronomy. Located in the shelter of the impressive main façade of the Sant Pau Modernist Precinct, 1902 Cafè Modernista offers us the chance to enjoy the best Catalan cuisine and market in one of the most impressive modernist monuments in Barcelona.\n\nHotel Spain\n\nWe will have option upon request possibility to change to the restaurant located in the Hotel España. Next to the Gran Teatro del Liceu is located this small jewel of Catalan Modernism, decorated by the architect Domènech i Montaner. Its interior preserves original elements, such as wooden and ceramic wainscoting reproducing heraldic motifs, mural paintings and even an alabaster fireplace from 1901. The restaurant, run by the acclaimed Michelin star chef Martin Berasategui, market and international cuisine, is the work of the modernist Ramón Casas. It is one of the most famous and special restaurants in Barcelona, located in the Hotel España.\n\nAfter the meal we move to the end of the walk of Lluís Companys, in one of the edges of the Parc de la Ciutadella to know another work of Domenech “Catells del tres Dragons”. This imposing square building with towers and battlements was designed as a café-restaurant for the 1888 Universal Exhibition where we will take a walk to rest the food in this lung of the city.\n\nAnd to finish the wonderful day, we leave the masterpiece “Palau de la Musica Catalana”, built with exposed brick and laminated iron and is considered one of the first modernist buildings. This majestic auditorium, built between 1905 and 1908 on behalf of the Orfeó Catalá, is considered one of the great architectural jewels of Catalan modernism due to its decorative exuberance.\n\nThe Concert Hall, one of the most beautiful and unique in the world, has been the setting for more than 100 years for important musical, artistic and social events. Its main stage, presided over by a large organ and a central skylight representing the sun and allowing natural light to enter, should be highlighted.\n\nNumerous figures, busts and ornamental elements inspired by nature surround the stage and the hall, turning it into a mystical and magical space.\n\nThe Palau was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997.\n\nCasa Lleó i Morera: Located on the corner of Passeig de Gràcia and Consell de Cent Street, Casa Lleó i Morera forms part, together with Casa Batlló and Casa Ametller, of the so-called “apple of discord”, so called by the people of Barcelona due to the difference in styles of the three exceptional buildings (which we will also pass by to comment on at the beginning of the day).\n\nIn 1905, the Lleó Morera family commissioned Lluís Domènech i Montaner to completely renovate the estate, built in 1864. The architect surrounded himself with the best artists and craftsmen, such as the sculptors Eusebi Arnau and Alfons Jujol or the glassmakers Rigalt and Granell, achieving a work of extraordinary beauty.\n\nPalau Montaner: Very close to Paseo de Gràcia, at the corner of calle Mallorca and Roger de Llúria, we find one of the few exempt palaces preserved in the Eixample. It is the Ramon de Montaner Palace, a curious eclectic Modernist building with an Italian air.\n\nOne year after the 1888 Barcelona Universal Exhibition, the architect Josep Domènech i Estapà was commissioned to build two luxurious residences for the two owners of Editorial Montaner i Simón. The palace for Ramon de Montaner began with Domènech i Estapà’s project, although it was later entrusted to the architect Lluís Domènech i Montaner.\n\nThe building has been the headquarters of the central government delegation in Barcelona since 1980.\n\nCasa Thomas: In Mallorca street we will find the Thomas house, of a pure modernist style very decorated that fully houses the facades of the buildings of this part of the Eixample of Barcelona, and that synthesizes, in spite of the later modifications, the characteristics of its author, Lluís Domènech i Montaner.\n\nWhen the modernist master Lluís Domènech i Montaner conceived the Thomas house, he did so in response to a commission from the printer Josep Thomas. This gave rise to a building consisting of the ground floor, where the owner’s workshop was located, and a first floor that corresponded to the Thomas family’s dwelling. This is where the architect leaves the most characteristic elements of his style. The neogothic façade, the use of blue tones in the decorations, markedly floral, and the reptile figures in the main hall denote the brand of the author of the building.\n\nCasa Fuster: The last Barcelona building by Lluís Domènech Montaner in Barcelona, which he built between 1908 and 1911 in collaboration with his son Pere Domènech i Roure, was the formidable gift that the rich Mallorcan Mariano Fuster wanted to give his wife Consol Fabra the Casa Fuster. The whole house forms a complex with a certain neo-Gothic air and a modernism of contained expressiveness. In fact, the beauty of the building is due to the use of very expensive noble materials, such as the white marble on the façade, glass or slate.\n\nDomènech Montaner left his mark on the characteristic pink columns at the base, the three-lobed windows and the classic floral decoration.\n\nHospital de Sant Pau: Formed by a central building and numerous adjacent pavilions, constituting one of the largest modernist complexes, together with the Pere Mata Institute of Reus, also the work of Lluís Domènech i Montaner.\n\nWork on its construction began in 1902, with the collaboration of his own son, Pere Domènech i Rovira, in charge of directing the second phase of the project, and the sculptor Pablo Gargallo, author of the famous sculptures on the façade of the central building.\n\nOne of the most characteristic elements of this building is the use of exposed brick, as well as the mixture of different architectural styles. In 1997 it was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.\n\nHotel España: Next to the Gran Teatro del Liceu is located this small jewel of Catalan Modernism, decorated by the architect Domènech i Montaner. Its interior conserves original elements, such as wooden and ceramic wainscoting reproducing heraldic motifs, mural paintings and even an alabaster fireplace from 1901. At the beginning of the 20th century, the family that owned it commissioned Lluís Domènech i Montaner, who collaborated with the sculptor Eusebi Arnau, author of the splendid alabaster fireplace that presides over the hotel’s bar, and the painter Ramón Casas, who painted the famous sirens of two tails that give one of its dining rooms its name.\n\nCastells del tres dragons: Located at the end of Paseo de Lluís Companys, on one of the edges of Parc de la Ciutadella, this imposing square building with towers and battlements was designed as a café-restaurant for the 1888 Universal Exhibition, where we will take a walk to rest our food in this lung of the city.\n\nPalau de la música catalana: This building is built with exposed brick and laminated iron and is considered one of the first modernist buildings.
