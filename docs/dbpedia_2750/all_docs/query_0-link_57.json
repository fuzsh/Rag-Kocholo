        "text": "The modernist movement, also known as Art Nouveau, started in the end of the 19th Century, and moved a lot of money and interesting buildings. Thanks to Gaudí, Domènech i Muntaner and Puig I Cadafalch architects among others, Barcelona is one of the most important modernist cities in the world.\n\nSuggested Modernist route in Barcelona:\n\nSince there are lots of Modernist places in Barcelona, and it would be impossible to visit them all in a short time, here we are going to tell you some places that you must not miss if you want to go through Modernism in Barcelona, between Gràcia and Eixample’s districts. We’ll start in Park Güell and then we’ll go down until Casa Batlló.\n\n.\n\n1. Park Güell\n\nThe Park Güell is a very beautiful place, where you’ll be able to see many modernist details. From the main square you can enjoy wonderful city views, because it’s in the upper side of the city. There are lots of works designed by Josep M. Jujol and Antoni gaudí, benches, columns, etc, full of colors and gorgeous details surrounded by a magic atmosphere.\n\nWhen you finish visiting Park Güell (you never will, but you’ll have to visit other places), take the Av. Santuari Sant Josep de la Muntanya until Travessera de Dalt. Turn to the left and walk until Plaça Lesseps.\n\n* * * * *\n\n2. Casas Ramos\n\nIn Plaça Lesseps, you’ll easily see three yellow buildings designed by Jaume Torres, and full of natural references such as bees and flowers.\n\nThe façade was made ​​with beige background and engravings drawings adorned with white siding. There are sandstone tribunes and balconies with wrought iron railings round the building.\n\nNow walk down the carrer Gran de Gràcia until Carrer Carolines, on the right.\n\n* * * * *\n\n3. Casa Vicens\n\nIt is located in Carrer de les Carolines 24, and it’s one of the most important works of architect Antoni Gaudí. The project initially included the house and garden to be used as a summerhouse.\n\nThe gated entrance represents palm leaves, made with wrought iron. The building also shows clear influences of Moorish architecture, manifested in the room called The Smoker. Even though the interior cannot be visited (because it’s still private), this is one of the most beautiful buildings in the city.\n\nYou can take again Gran de Gràcia (to the sea), and walk until la Rambla del Prat, where you will see buildings like Cinema Bosc, Casa Fuster or Casas Joan Fatjó, if you go until Passeig de Gràcia.\n\n* * * * *\n\n4. La Pedrera / Casa Milà\n\nOnce you’re in Passeig de Gràcia, walk down until Carrer de Provença, and you’ll see on the left side the Casa Milà, popularly known as La Pedrera. One of the most famous works of Antoni Gaudí, this amazing house was built between 1906 and 1910 ordered by a wealthy bourgeois man.\n\nIts facade is spectacular, but it really stands out a lot some chimneys and stairs on the rooftop, which make this a unique building.\n\nFurthermore, in summer nights you can enjoy some concerts in its roof, so it’s a very good way to spend your late afternoon in Barcelona.\n\n* * * *\n\n5. Casa Amatller – Casa Batlló – Casa Lleó-Morera\n\nIf you keep walking down the Passeig de Gràcia, you will find on the right side a square of buildings between carrer del Consell de Cent and Carrer Aragó, known as Apple of Discord, because of the rivalry between the architects of these buildings: Antoni Gaudí (Casa Batlló), Josep Puig I Cadafalch (Casa Amatller) and Lluís Domènech i Muntaner (Casa Lleó-Morera).\n\nCasa Amatller is the oldest building, built in 1875, and it’s got a lot of gorgeous details in its façade, like a sculpture of Saint George and the Dragon, made by Eusebi Arnau.\n\nNext to Casa Amatller you will see La Casa Batlló, designed by Antoni Gaudí, and which is one of the icons of the city, visited by lots of tourists every day, and spectacular because of all kind of unique details.\n\nAnd finally, Casa Lleó-Morera, a building reformed beteen 1902 and 1906 by Lluís Domènech i Muntaner. Unfortunately, we can only see the façade (decorated with floral motifs), because the inside was destructed in 1934 to give place to a shop, which is still there.\n\n* * * *\n\n.\n\nReady to visit them all?\n\nBook your apartment in Barcelona now.\n\n."
