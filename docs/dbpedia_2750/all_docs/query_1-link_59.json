        "text": "Domènech i Montaner was a pioneer in artistically integrating form, function and symbolism in a building. He applied this rationalist model to upper middle-class houses and health facilities and industrial premises alike. His innovations turned into architectural trends of the time and became the unmistakable hallmark of Catalan Art Nouveau.\n\nWrought iron structures, exposed brickwork, ceramic decoration, mosaics and multi-coloured glass which controlled and played with light and decoration inspired by the varied and exuberant forms of nature; all this was a far cry from the sobriety and straight lines of earlier architectural styles.\n\nHis biographer described the architect as a professional who did things advisedly. Thus before building houses for upper middle-class families, he would spend time with the family who had commissioned the project. This was how he learned at firsthand about their preferences and needs and was able to design a house which was just right for them. It was a kind of on-demand design. The custom was also carried on by his son, architect Pere Domènech Roura.\n\nHospital de la Santa Creu i de Sant Pau\n\nDecoration and iconography are two key features of this building which has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Construction began in 1902 and it is a prime example of Domènech i Montaner’s artistic combination of form, function and symbolism in a building. The complex was designed following the hygienist criteria of the time to provide ventilation, plenty of sunlight and views of nature.\n\nPalau de la Música Catalana\n\nBuilt between 1905 and 1908 as a commission from the Orfeó Català, it is the only working concert venue declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. It is covered with an inverted dome skylight and one of the finest examples of the integration of the arts applied to architecture; a magical music box blending sculpture, mosaic, stained glass and wrought iron. It is a major piece of architecture and also widely viewed as symbolic and emotive heritage of the people of Catalonia.\n\nCasa Lleó Morera\n\nRefurbished by the architect in 1902 as a commission from the Lleó Morera family, this building has a front featuring allusions to the family’s surname, representing mulberry blossom with various materials and allegories of 20th century inventions.\n\nCasa Thomas\n\nBuilt between 1895 and 1898 commissioned by the printer Josep Thomas, this building is a neo-Gothic wonder which looks like something out of a fairy tale. Its front has a large number of floral decorations and reptile figures, a hallmark of Domènech i Montaner’s style.\n\nCasa Fuster\n\nThe architect constructed this neo-Gothic building between 1908 and 1911 with the help of his son Pere. At the time it was considered the most expensive building in Barcelona because of the materials used in its construction, including premium quality white marble, glass and slate. It was the architect’s last design in Barcelona.\n\nEditorial Montaner i Simón\n\nThis was Domènech i Montaner’s first major commission in 1879. This building was one of the first in the city to feature an iron pillar frame. Even though it was an industrial facility hiding a factory with heavy machinery where more than 240 employees worked, the front was designed as a mansion. Since 1990 it has been the home of the Fundació Antoni Tàpies.\n\nCastell dels Tres Dragons\n\nIt was originally designed to house the main restaurant for the Barcelona Universal Expo held in 1888. This exposed brickwork building was designed to imitate the structure of a military fortress. It had several uses until it was repurposed in 1920 to host the city’s Zoology Museum. Since the Museum moved to the Fòrum, the building has been closed and awaiting refurbishment.\n\nFonda Espanya\n\nDomènech i Montaner renovated this Catalan Art Nouveau hotel which had opened in 1859. The architect was assisted in this project by Eusebi Arnau, one of the most outstanding Catalan Art Nouveau sculptors along with Josep Llimona and Enric Clarasó, and the painter Ramon Casas, one of the most exceptional Catalan Art Nouveau artists, who is credited with a mural on a maritime theme which decorates the present-day hotel’s Mermaids’ Room."
