        "text": "It’s officially more than halfway through the semester, and officially spring! Spring’s got me feeling all sorts of giddy this year. And Switzerland is just as beautiful snow-less as it is snow-covered. And, for students, spring obviously means Spring Break! Except here, the proper term is “Easter Holiday.” You can certainly say spring break, but I’d discourage you from doing so unless you want to get suggestive and funny looks from whomever you’re telling, as when they hear these words together they think of girls gone wild and alcohol poisoning. Anyway, my break in the spring this year is completely immeasurable to every year’s past, as I spent it wandering to and around Stockholm, Sweden and Barcelona, Spain.\n\nI started off last Saturday (4/3/2014) in Stockholm. But hold your horses everyone. Public service announcement: I have found the most amazing gelateria in Milan. How are these related you say? Well I had to ride the train to Milan first –> bus it to the airport –> fly it to Stockholm –> bus it to the city –> before I could make my fabulous appearance down those cobblestone streets. Anyway, the gelato! The place is called GELATERIA SARTORI. When you exit Milano Centrale train station, turn left where all the airport buses pick up. Keep walking to the back corner of the building until you find the cart nestled against the side of the building. And order pistachio. (I am a new fan of pistachio, but theirs is also unlike anything I’ve ever had.) I stopped here on my outward and return journeys- both times I was the only non-local ordering.\n\nSTOCKHOLM (4/4/2015) – I took the cheap RyanAir flight, so I didn’t actually arrive to my hostel until about 1am. But the next morning (4/5/2015) I was up and ready to go- Easter Sunday and there were still a bunch of shops and stores open! I spent most of the morning exploring the area by foot (and picking out a couple new clothing pieces from H&M..) before eating lunch from a highly recommended herring food truck by the industrial area. It is called NYSTEKT STROMMING, and for 75 SEK (about 8 bucks) you get an order of fresh herring, mashed potatoes, cole slaw, pickled onions, and pickled cucumbers. Delicious! Oh, and did I mention that Stockholm is actually made up of 14 different islands? You are always walking over a bridge of some sort..! And then in addition to these islands there are a bunch more smaller archipelagos that spread across Lake Malaren until it feeds into the Baltic Sea. A few of the islands out there are inhabited year-round, but they don’t truly become a destination tourist attraction until about the end of May.\n\nAfter wondering around the different parts of Stockholm (historic, business district, industrial/hipster) I took the metro out of the city center cluster to SKOGSKYRKOGARDEN, or the WOODLAND CEMETERY. I know, it’s a little bit weird to head out to a cemetery the first day I get to Stockholm. But the cemetery was designed by famous architects Gunnar Asplund and Sigurd Lewerentz, and was brought to fruition between 1917 and 1940. I had seen absolutely breathtaking photos of the landscape architecture before arriving, and was not disappointed. Approaching 6pm on a semi-rainy and mostly cloudy day, the cemetery had this beautiful aura about it, and was subject to moments of the gorgeous yellow light softly radiating and peeping out around the grey clouds.\n\nI took the metro back into the city and headed back toward my hostel, which was amazing! The name of the hostel is CITY BACKPACKERS. Wonderfully located, friendly staff and well-kept facilities made for an enjoyable stay. Only in a Swedish hostel would they make you take off your shoes before entering (Swedish custom) and also have a conveniently sauna located next to the showers. I ended meeting up with a girl from New Jersey in my room, and we headed out to find dinner together. It’s always nice to find some travel buddies! After dinner at a yummy Thai place we went out to for a couple drinks on the town. And let me tell ya something, Stockholm’s drinks out are NOT cheap! For one (nice) beer, it costs about 85-90 SEK! (That’s about 10 bucks.) So blah blah, live music and some crazy drunk people, we decide to get a hot dog from a stand that’s open really late. This guy has the hot dogs that range over four degrees of spicy, and I took the second. It was so yummy! But.. we also ended up trying a bite of the 4th degree (you have to sign a waver and everything, and eat the whole thing in under 5 minutes in order to win a tshirt..) and it was miserable!! At first I thought it tasted good, but after just one bite my whole mouth was on fire, and beer in water in amount were not helping. I think my mouth was still burning the next morning.\n\nBut it was all okay because I was headed to the Swedish spa! (4/6/2015) I signed up for one online at STUREBADET, and hopped over there for my massage appointment in the morning. The facilities were, of course, beautiful. The spa was created in 1885 by Carl Curman, described as a “doctor and Renaissance man” according to their website. The wood and marble construction was picture-perfect, and beyond relaxing. I did observe and notice that the “luxurious” appeal of participating in a spa day to most Americans (I think) is something that is completely normal, necessary, and routine for a Swede. They definitely don’t get massages every day, but they definitely do go here and swim, socialize, and relax on a normal basis. I would really view this experience as cultural more than anything. It was really neat to see residents of the city going about their daily routines, and realizing that my spa morning was just another aspect of their every-day.\n\nFor lunch, I went to a local burger place I had read about online, for a low-cost, delicious lunch! At VIGARDA, I ordered the traditional burger, which came with chili, cheddar, BBQ, and a yummy sauce. Walk walk walk, explore explore explore and I met up with my Jersey friend again to go for a drink and the ever-so-touristy viking restaurant! I recommend WIRSTROMS PUB, mostly for the comfy-cosy atmosphere and good selection of beer. The viking restaurant was an experience, that’s for sure. AIFUR KROG & BAR is in a basement off the main street in old town, accented with dim lighting, fur seating, and crude eating utensils. It was a fun atmosphere! The waitresses seemed unhappy with their jobs (or maybe they were just playing the part of the grumpy viking??) but the food and experience was still well worth it, I’d say. For the more adventurous they offered deer and some over gamey meats, but I stuck with chicken and a what barley salad. So yummy!\n\nBreakfast the next morning was to be had at VETE-KATTEN. The Swedish are famous for their cinnamon buns, so I tried one of those with a latte. (By the way, Swedish are also big on coffee. They have their own vocabulary word for coffee break (mid-afternoon), which is fika!)\n\n{{OH GUYS. I need a moment to tell you some terrible news. The Ice Bar in Stockholm was one of my main points of interest this trip. Come on, a whole bar made of ice?? Even the cups?? So cool! I don’t care if it’s touristy. Turns out they were replacing the ice in the ice bar over the course of a week, and I happened to be there 4 days out of the 7 they were doing this. And this only happens once a year.. I will admit I was in a small state of depression after hearing this news.}}\n\nThis day (4/7/2014) I hopped over to the MODERNA MUSEET, where they were showcasing exhibitions by Louise Bourgeois (French graphic artist and sculpltor) and Akram Zaatari (Lebanese photographer and film artist). Both were extremely intense in their respective ways. Bourgeois’ exhibition itself was named “I have been to hell and back,” which is pulled from one of her graphic works where the second part of the piece optimistically cries, “And let me tell you, it was wonderful.” In the informational booklet, I think the writer appropriately states that the images and sculptures that make up the artist’s works are “unstable and searching,” and frighteningly beautiful. Zaatari’s work is concentrated in the art of subjectively composing existing images in order to tell/ show a history. The archival and subjective nature of the pieces that create a larger composition are stunning, and reminds me of a sort of typological study, similar to Bernd and Hilla Becher’s work.\n\nI wondered over to the central market for lunch, called OSTERMALMS SALUHALL. A bunch of local vendors were selling meats, cheeses, etc. I grabbed the potato pancakes with bacon from a local cafe inside, which is a typical traditional dish of Sweden. Really just so yummy.\n\nI then proceeded to the island of DJURGARDEN, and walked around this beautiful park-eqsue landscape, laced with museums, houses, historical palaces, and restaurants. I stopped by the ROSENDAL PALACE, built for a Swedish King in the 1820’s. The most interesting part of the palace complex, though, was the garden! A fully operating garden (ROSENDALS TRADGARD) also services a cafe, with beautiful little snacks and treats. I just tried a couple cookies and ate them in the garden- it was lovely 🙂\n\nI then took part in the free walking tour of the historic area, where I learned some more about the history of Stockholm, how you could tell how old the buildings really were in “old” town, why drinks are so expensive in Sweden (there was a bad period of alcoholism and economics a while back before the Swedes became a well-off country), the story about the war ship Vasa from the 1600’s, which was elaborately constructed, but not elaborately engineered, and sunk in its first 10 minutes of sailing from the harbor. It was just salvaged from the bottom of the lake in the 1960s!! Among some other interesting histories related to the city!\n\nFor dinner, the hostel staff recommended TRANAN to me for my taste of the famous Swedish meatballs. If you sit in the bar area, it’s less expensive, and the bartending staff was so friendly and sweet! The meatballs (served with mashed potatoes, lingonberries, and pickled cucumbers) were out of this world amazing. I need to find a recipe so I can try to recreate this delicious traditional dish.\n\n4/8/2015 was my switching day! Stockholm to BARCELONA. But I of course managed to eat some more before I left.. I got some coffee from DROP COFFEE and a small pastry in the Soder region before I left. Cute huh?\n\nSo I arrived in Barcelona around 7pm. Let me start this part of the story off by saying: Barcelona has been my favorite European city I’ve ever been to. Navigating to the hostel was super easy, and Barcelona public transport is perfect. I never spent more than 2 minutes waiting for a metro. Anyway, at HOSTELONE PARALELO, I was truly at home. The owner, Angel, is the sweetest, funniest man, and is more than happy to give you the low-down on the city- what’s worth seeing and what’s not, and how to make the most of your time in this beautiful, beautiful place. Every night, the hostel cooks dinner for free, (tips encouraged) and it’s always something local. Everyone eats together like one big family, and you get to know your other hostel mates over some beer and sangria. The hostel also takes everyone out, and it was so comforting being with a local who can show you around and help you get your bearings.\n\nMy day 4/9/2015 started off with a bang at the unfinished masterpiece of the SAGRADA FAMILIA. Designed by Antoni Gaudi, this beautiful church has been a work in progress since 1882. The sheer scale of the building as a whole in comparison to its surroundings is breathtaking, but the experience inside it is a complete other thing. I just felt lifted when I walked in, like maybe someone was slightly pushing my feet from under me as I was walking around. I spent a whole hour circling the church, exiting and re-entering. It never got boring.\n\nI spent the afternoon walking around PARC GUELL, but not actually entering. (Barcelona is not a crazy expensive city, but admission to all of the Gaudi works and museums certainly is!) I still got some gorgeous views of the city and sea from above, which certainly sufficed. On my way back to the center, I stumbled across a cute tshirt printing company, designed and made in Barcelona. I couldn’t resist this cute tshirt!\n\nAlong the main shopping center, La Rambla, you will find the best thing that’s ever happened to me, or the MERCADO DE LA BOQUERIA. The open-air market was everything I could dream of and more- fresh dried meats and hams, Spanish cheeses, fresh fruit juices, a bunch of fried seafood, and so much more. (Btw wall the pictures are from two trips on two different days, I’m bad at self-control but not that bad!!)\n\nI re-fueled at the hostel, and was out again to the PICASSO MUSEUM, which was so so neat! Anytime I’m in a museum and see a Picasso piece it always seems like a little isolated jewel, but it was great to be able to see his work over the span of a lifetime- how it changed and evolved, and how he worked in terms of process. They also had a contemporary exhibit on display, which was essentially the juxtaposition of Picasso’s works with Salvador Dali’s works (even though Dali was born 20 years after Picasso). This juxtaposition makes you aware of how much they influenced each other, and similar themes or ideas they were trying to convey. If anyone’s interested to know more, here is a WSJ article about the exhibition.\n\nhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/a-relationship-fraught-and-fruitful-on-picasso-dali-dali-picasso-at-the-dali-museum-1419982238\n\nThen, I met up with one of my friends in my sorority who is studying in Barcelona this semester. Like I said earlier, it’s so nice to meet up with people! I love having the days to explore stuff at my own pace and the nights to meet people and socialize. She took us to a local tapas bar, LA LUNA, where we had delicious white sangria, and I ordered patatas bravas (essentially potato wedges with a yummy white sauce) and a Spanish cheese plate. We also made our way to a local gin bar called the LIME HOUSE for some yummy mojitos! It was so nice to spend time with a familiar face!\n\nMy second and final full day in Barcelona, I made my way to PALAU ROBERT, which is currently housing an exhibition on a local architecture firm named RCR. The exhibition was nice- there were several main themes, like meditation with the landscape, public and social function, the presence of time, etc. And so many models! This was also free- so that made my wallet happy.\n\nAlong this street, Passeig de Gràcia, three of Gaudi’s houses notably stand out from the rest of the architectural language. I walked by them all, but took a tour of CASA BATLLO. Built 1904-06, the house, especially the facade, is reminiscent of water, sea creatures, and nature-esque forms. The audio tour was amazing- each room was explained from its function down to the ventilation details in the doors. It does a really good job at giving you insight to Gaudi’s thinking and formal execution of ideas.\n\nI strolled down this street until I began to reach the harbor. Before continuing, though, I stopped for a sandwich at BO DE B. This is a famous sandwich shop, mostly among tourists, but that doesn’t mean locals don’t go there or that it wasn’t absolutely delicious. I got the hamburger sandwich, with all the sauces. Yum yum! And I was actually really lucky, because there was only one person waiting outside the door when I got there. Apparently, there is always a line that’s snaking around the corner of the street.\n\nWith a full and satisfied tummy, I walked to and along the beach, grabbing a mojito and taking in the beautiful sea and sunny rays for the rest of the afternoon.\n\nAt night, I ate beans and risotto with my hostel, and went out with the group! Again, so fun. Shots bars and clubs galore. We ended up staying out til about 3, which is early, because I had to wake up in 3 hours to catch the early flight back to Milano!\n\nOnce in Milan, I had enough time to eat lunch there, and did so at PIZZA BIG. Where, you guessed it, they had big pizza! (But again, really thin.) This was delicious, and I would definitely go again. Just a couple blocks from the central station. Obviously, I stopped by Gelateria Sartori for some pistachio. And if you haven’t noticed by my pictures, food experiences are equally important to me as buildings/ sightseeing/ etc. I mean, it’s a part of the culture! Being immersed in the food realm is one of the best ways to get to know a place, and people for that matter!\n\nBut while waiting outside the station, basking in the sun, I reflected on just how lucky I am to have this opportunity to live in Europe. Just living in Switzerland was a big step, but now I’m independently traveling to other countries, navigating cities, and experiencing other cultures, all on my own?? Of course it wouldn’t be possible without my mom and Steve! Life can be pretty wonderful. And I have another Brian Andreas quote.. you guys know how obsessed I am. He just recently posted this one on his Instagram:\n\n“I had no idea that when I invited Life to take over that it actually would & now I’m somewhere miles away from any place I know & Life keeps waiving its arms & grinning like a crazy person saying This. Is. So. Great.”\n\n^^how’s the guy so good at words?? 🙂\n\nxxxoo Haley\n\nWow!!! It’s already more than the middle of March. I should just stop commentating on how fast time passes. (Thankful I have 5 years in college instead of 4!) And no! I did not make up a new word. Ouagadougou is the capital of Burkina Faso, and it is our site for this semester’s program. Diébédo Francis Kéré is my professor this semester, originally from Burkina Faso but educated in architecture in Berlin. He works largely in the vernacular context, creating educational and public buildings in rural Burkina Faso. This is his website: http://www.kerearchitecture.com/\n\nAnd also a TED talk (obsessed with these by the way) on building with local materials: https://www.ted.com/talks/diebedo_francis_kere_how_to_build_with_clay_and_community\n\nHe really is such an inspiring person. Anyway, our project this semester is a new parliament building for Ouagadougou, as theirs was actually burned down in political riots in October. Blaise Compaore was the president for 27 years, and in his attempt to extend his term an uprising among the Burkinabe people resulted in the demolition of the parliament building, as well as his rule.\n\nSo that was the start to my semester! Usually, the Kéré studio travels to Burkina and participates in a “building workshop” in which the project of the studio is brought to actual realization. Because of the political instability, and also the scale of the project, we were unable to travel to Africa. However, we did go to NAPLES! Here, we participated in a dome-building workshop in a small town 1.5 hours outside of the city, in a small town called SAN POTITO.\n\nBut before that I managed to make it to Milano twice! (Side note: I used to always say Milan. Or Naples for example. But since living here for so long, I find myself using both. At first I found it “fancy” or excessive to say Milano or Napoli. Right or wrong, that’s just how I felt when I said it! But now it comes naturally both ways. I think it’s an interesting observation.)\n\nThe first time: I went with a few of the people I live with in the casa. It was a leisurely day, and we walked around and saw some architecture! Three buildings + aperitivo afterward = perfect day! (P.s. I’m obsessed with the store MUJI. This Japanese department-like store has everything, and so nicely designed! Their pens are the greatest things I have ever held. Too bad they only have it in NYC in the states.)\n\nSchool, school, etc. etc.\n\n(3/10/2015) I found myself again in Milan with my best friend!! My little in my sorority visited me for the couple days before my departure to Naples- I am so lucky! (We also went to Como.) I loved being a tourist in Milan. I know this city kind of well, actually. Definitely better than I know Washington D.C.! I’ve also been to Milan more times than I’ve been to D.C. I think… Anyway, whenever I go with my exchange friends, we do fun, off-the-beaten path things. I’ve never gotten to be the silly tourist! Gigi’s presence was the perfect excuse. We climbed to the top of the Duomo, ate delicious panzerotti at LUINI (all the locals go here, as well), grabbed gelato at GELATERIA GROM, fed some pigeons (so fun!!!!), meandered over to CASTELLO SFORZESCO, drank a beer (and ate cotton candy) in PARCO SEMPIONE, shopped along the Navigli Canal, and had aperitivo at my favorite bar! It was near perfect.\n\nSo, Naples!\n\nDay 1 (2/11/2015) was mostly spent traveling. We took the train from Milan. Upon arrival however, we stopped for coffee at THE BEST place just outside the train station. (Now there are actually many, but this was the first.) It’s called MEXICO. Yeah, yeah sounds a bit sketchy, Mexico in Napoli? Trust me. Best. Coffee. Ever. Along with pastries and donuts…\n\nAnyway after an espresso we hop over to L’ ANTICA PIZZERIA DA MICHELE, supposedly the best pizza in all of Napoli. When I looked it up to make sure I spelled it right, I discovered that Eat, Pray, Love was filmed here, and that Julia Roberts sat in this very establishment! Anyway, they only serve two types of pizza. Get the double mozzarella if you go. A huge (albeit very thin-crusted, that’s why it’s justified to eat the whole thing of course) pizza and a beer for only 7 euros. Am I in paradise?\n\nWe stayed the night in HOSTEL OF THE SUN, which was so nice! The staff was so pleasant and the rooms were clean, as well as the bathrooms. I wish we could have stayed longer here, but the next day we were up and at ‘em to head to San Potitio! (Coffee from Mexcio before the 1.5 hour bus drive was absolutely necessary, obviously.)\n\nWe were welcomed by our hosts, Fabrizio Carola, and crew. He is an architect that focuses on a specific type of dome-building technique, and we were there to learn and build for 2 days. There is a man-made “compass” in the very center of the dome-to-be, and you simply move the compass to measure the angle at which you will place the next brick. Start from bottom and go until you hit roof!\n\nOh, and also- you’d expect it to be warming up in on of the southernmost parts of Italy in the middle of March, right? Wrong. So guess who packed light and forgot her jacket? This gal. Oh well, what doesn’t kill ya makes ya stronger. It wasn’t so bad.\n\nThen, we had two nights left in Naples. It was my prerogative to EAT. Unsurprisingly, I fulfilled (filled! punny, get it??) this task, going above and beyond the call of duty. I wouldn’t be surprised if those reading the account of all my eats would feel as though they instantly gained five pounds. Okay, so let’s get to it. The first night back we checked in at our airbnb apartment (gorgeous by the way!!) and went in search for food on a Friday night in Naples. Our airbnb host told us the name of a good restaurant nearby called TRATTORIA DA NENNELLA. Apparently it’s just a fact of the game that you always wait an hour/ 1.5 hours before getting seated anywhere for dinner on the weekend. In our wait time, we grabbed a beer and tried a local street food called taralli. It’s like a cracker, but seasoned and so good! Once in the restaurant, I was amazed to find that an appetizer, pasta, and side was all only 12 euros. It’s one thing that the food was so heavenly, but another that it was so cheap! This place was also the definition of those cheesy Italian shows. You know, like the one in Matilda where the family is eating dinner and they make Matilda watch people covered in sticky stuff trying to get the flying money to stick to them and they win it? Maybe you don’t… anyway there was no flying money but a lot of suggestive dancing and undressing of bananas. This table next to of us of about 12 ladies found it hilarious. Why?? I will never know, but it certainly was entertaining. And the food was perfect.\n\nThat night, we headed out to the university district for a few drinks. It was pretty low key, but nice to explore nonetheless! Napoli is full of crazed moped drivers, crazed regular drivers, and is a little dirty. But what it lacks in these departments is definitely compensated for by the food and charm. It reminded me of a crazier Rome.\n\nSaturday (03/14/2015), we had a full schedule on our hands! It started off with a guided tour of Naples’ underground, which was so neat! Forty feet below ground, we walked through and around a system of aqueducts and walkways that were constructed thousands of years ago. During WWII, though, the carved underground was used as a bomb shelter for the Napoletanos. There was one really narrow and unlit path, for which we grabbed a candle and climbed through the slimmest of openings by flickering light. I loved it. We also visited an ancient Greek theater, which actually wasn’t even discovered until recently. After the war, it was rebuilt on as an apartment complex! Imagine finding out you were living on top of an ancient Greek theater.. Crazy!\n\nNext, we went to PIO DELLA MISERICORDIA, where there is a famous painting by Caravaggio called the Seven Works of Mercy. The seven works were actually meant to be seven paintings to be hung on the interior of the church, but they were all combined into one painting to sit at the altar instead. An American artist named Laddie John Dill was there to officially open his exhibition for his sculptures, which serve as modes of interpretation for Caravaggio’s painting.\n\nNext, we headed to MUSEO MADRE, a modern art museum. It was interesting that the 19th century palazzo in which the museum is located is also home to all of these modern art pieces. Alvaro Siza (Portuguese architect) renovated the museum’s interior in 2005, so the building itself was also neat to be in!\n\nLunch (ish) was comprised of fried pizza, fried pasta, more pizza, and sfogliatelle (pastry with sweet ricotta cheese and citrus flavor). Street food is the best food.\n\nWe then visited CHAPEL SANSEVERO, which was absolutely amazing. There are a bunch of late-Baroque sculptures of marble housed here, the most renowned being the Veiled Christ by Giuseppe Sanmartino in 1753. You can’t stop staring, Im serious. You almost feel that the body under the cloth is breathing, it seems so alive. All of the other sculptures were equally captivating in their own ways. The floor of the chapel, though, was one of my favorite things. It was designed by Francesco Celabrano (1765). How could something so flat, sculpted from such a heavy material, seem to be pulsating with such life? Much different than the sculpted marble, of course, in its own way. I really loved staring at all this stone stuff for an hour.\n\nWe made our way up to CERTOSA DI SAN MARTINO as the sun was beginning to set. Formerly a monastery and now a museum, we didn’t have too much time here. But the views of Naples from above were breathtaking.\n\nThen we made our way back down for…. food!! We ate as a big group at PIZZERIA STARITA A MATERDEI. When you eat as a big group in an Italian restaurant you don’t pick what you want, rather they bring out popular and local dishes for everyone to share. And they keep bringing.. and bringing… and bringing… more food. This is meal was insane, I think I ate my actual body weight in fried dough. But don’t think for a second that I didn’t love every second of it!!\n\nFor our last night in Naples, we headed back to the same university district area and ended up staying out till 5 am!! People in Europe are so unfazed by staying out in the wee hours of the morning. It’s something I’ve had to adjust to. Nothing special though, just good beer and good company in a beautiful city! Bonus: I was starving on the way back to the apartment and a kebab place was open! What are the odds? Falafel for one, please.\n\nThe next day, I managed to buy some necessities to bring home. No souveneirs, no tshirts. You guess it: FOOD! Do I have a food complex or something? I just love it so much. I got a bunch of taralli to take back, as well as fresh buffalo mozzarella, pasta, and limoncello. The staples of Italy, from the best of the best.\n\nAnd in between shopping for food I treated myself to gelato.\n\nAnd now, we have one meal left! It just so worked out that the last really was the best. We ate at ANTICA LATTERIA, which was suggested to our group by someone from the area. This meal wasn’t as cheap, but I will dream about it for years to come. For appetizer, I had fish meatballs (it sounds weird but it’s essentially fancy fish sticks), and for the main course, gnocchi with octopus. I was a little adventurous here because Naples is right next to the sea, and I figured I’d branch out. I never wanted my bites to end.\n\nAnd that was Napoli! I commenced wallowing in my extra 10 pound body on the pacifying (as always) train ride back. And worth every ounce.\n\nThe school week passed, as it usually does – fast. And I found myself again in Milan last night with some friends from the casa! Did I mention I love Milan? We went to the TUNNEL CLUB for a concert by a man named Franceso Tristano. Electronic music, flashing lights, and staying out till 6 A.M. took it to whole new level for me. I had the best time! Oh, and before, we went to a bar called BAR MOGAMO. I loved this place! Great mojitos and good atmosphere. I want to go back. (I’m sure that won’t be a problem.)\n\nAnd I have to tell a funny anecdote that just happened. I am still exhausted from my sleepless night in Milan, and one of my friends from Portugal stopped by my apartment to ask if I was going to join the small birthday celebration next door. I told him I was still so tired and going to bed soon (after I finish writing this) and he was like, “Oh, okay. Rest well! I was going to say rest in peace but I don’t think it’s okay to say…?” This made me laugh a lot. Living with friends from all over the world has honestly and easily been one of the best experiences I’ve been lucky enough to be a part of.\n\nOh aaand.. drumroll please! I am traveling all by super super big girl self to Stockholm, Sweden and Barcelona, Spain for spring break in a couple weeks! And I thought the plane ride to Switzerland by myself was a feat back in August! I love traveling with people, don’t get me wrong, but I also love being alone. Also, this way, no one can judge or prevent me from eating cake and drinking coffee for every meal. (JK… or am I?) I love Europe.\n\n~ Haley\n\n2/5/2015 – 2/15/2015\n\nI’m baaaaack! In Svizzera, that is. And boy does it feel good. I really do love this place. When I landed in Zurich the security man looked at my passport and said, so you live here? At which point I said yes, and he proceeded to ask my for my resident card. I incredulously continued through the airport, thinking, why, yes, I DO live here. I was returning to a familiar place, familiar people, and a room full of my stuff in the southernmost region of Switzerland, tucked away in some mountains and Italian-esque streets. Pinch me.\n\nAnd then pinch me again because my best friend was waiting for me at the airport!! Our meeting spot was McDonalds (very original I know) – where we got some overpriced coffee to deter our jet lag. We hopped on the train (the familiarity, cleanliness, and punctuality of the Swiss trains was a warm welcome in itself) from the airport to the center of Zurich. (I’m skipping over the part where we went a stop too far, had to get off at the next one, and get back on again.) The unfamiliarity of being in a big city in Switzerland (very foreign concept to me), where they have trams, was overwhelming and confusing, especially when you’re lugging around two suitcases and a purse so big you could probably fit a dog in it. Kate and I meandered over to what we now know was a refueling/ fix-it station for the trams, hoping we were in the right place to get onboard. It took about 10 minutes of half-investigating and half-blankly staring before we lugged our little American butts to an actual stop, at which point we got on a tram and annoyed everyone with our excessive baggage. But wait, it gets better! We were on the right tram, wrong direction. Take 10 – we get off and manage to redeposit ourselves on one going in the right direction toward our hotel.\n\nWe are staying at KAFI SCHNAPS, which is actually a coffee/bar with a set of rooms on the second floor. I read about this place in the Fodor Switzerland book. It was an adorable, clean, cute, and relatively cheap option for our night in Zurich. Kate and I loved it, I definitely recommend!! It’s just a few tram stops away from the city center. We go for a panini because we are starving (I refuse to eat airplane meals. They smell funny. Side note- I actually did eat an airplane meal on my journey back to the states, and it completely backfired. The weird curry chicken fell off my fork and into my fluffy infinity scarf, blessing me with a lovely scent for the duration of my travels. Never again.) Anyway, we both grabbed a veggie panini. I will make this announcement now: Switzerland is expensive!!! I do live here, but traveling was completely different. You will spend a small fortune.\n\nWe headed over to GROSSMUNSTER church, where you can pay a few francs to climb up to the top and enjoy some beautiful panoramic views of the city. And since it was absolutely freezing outside, there was hardly anyone up there! Score for us.\n\nNext stop: a beer hall! Funny story: Kate and I kept a running list of words highlighting our experiences so I could recall everything properly. When we talked about this day, I said, “Oh! We went to the beer hall first!” and she was telling me no, that we went to the cinema themed place first for wine. I insisted on my event captioning, at which point she realized, “Oh! You mean the other beer hall we went to!” So the order of events went like this: we went to a beer hall and enjoyed a tipple among the local 50+ age group, grabbed some wine and water at a weird cinema restaurant (Switzerland – where water costs more than wine), and went to another beer hall, where we each got a healthy flight and shared a cheese plate. I think we did Zurich good. Oh, and we had an old man sitting near us at our last stop, continuously cheers-ing us and talking to us in Swiss German. The tone seemed endearing so we smiled and nodded until he bid us adieu.\n\nNext morning – breakfast in our coffee shop/ hotel! Bread, cheese, butter, and jelly (and I don’t even really like jelly) never tasted so good.\n\nThen we were off to Mendrisio! A couple trains later, we arrive here with a yucky sleet mix accompanying us as we made our way to the casa. After settling in a bit (and by settling in I mean not unpacking a thing) we grocery shopped and made lunch. I decided to take Kate to Como this evening for a nice aperitivo. The Swiss train got us to Chiasso (the last Swiss train stop) and told us to get off. We find out that the Italian trains must be on strike! Because they were not running. Luckily Como is bus ride-able, so we hopped on and made our way to the most adorable place called FRESCO, which was recommended to me by a friend. The cocktails and finger foods here were truly an art. it was such a nice experience! I will definitely go again. On our way home we stopped by some run-down pizza shop and grabbed a bite, joking that this must be George Clooney’s favorite pizza shop. I found it really amusing in the moment but now that I’m writing about it it seems kind of boring. Sorry if the headline disappointed anyone.\n\nThe next day we went exploring around Lugano. After reading some reviews online, we decided to eat at LA TINERA, a typical Ticinese restaurant. They’re known for their risotto, so I think you can guess what I ordered. Plus mushrooms. So filling and so yummy. In these types of restaurants they also serve wine in what look like mini bowls – so fun! This meal was a great local experience.\n\nWe then set out around the lake and to the next town to begin the SENTIERO DI GANDRIA, a scenic trail running along Lake Lugano. When we arrived in the town where the trail begins, we hopped off the bus to this old man shouting, “Hello!!! Welcome to my country!!!!” This was Clint, our new Swiss friend who continues to jabber on for approximately 15 minutes about how he loves America and stories from his childhood. Definitely a colorful character. We continue along, making our way to the path. The walk was absolutely gorgeous!! The Gandria trail also featured this neat Olive Trail, with all these informational signs about the growing and harvesting of olives. Olives are one of my favorite foods and I found it rather interesting. Olive oil is also one of my favorite foods. Olives are just a great crop overall!\n\nOn our way back to Mendrisio that night we ran into a bachelorette party, except it was weird because they were trying to get everyone (including myself and Kate) to buy airplane sized soaps and gadgets for a couple of francs. Is this normal? This would be stressful to me. Do they really end up getting a lot of money? Are these funds for the wedding? This was simply odd. Sorry Kate, we are not doing this at your bachelorette party.\n\nThat was essentially the day, and we made sure to rest up in preparation to wake up the next day and leave for LUZERN. This is also a Swiss German region of Swtizerland. We arrived here and made our way (loudly and annoyingly as we rolled our suitcases on the cobblestone streets) to the JAIL HOTEL. Yep, you heard me! This place was a prison until 1998. The location is great and the prices are cheap. And Luzern is the definition of picturesque. We grabbed a quick lunch in the train station because it was Sunday. (Practically everything in Switzerland is closed on Sundays. Except…)\n\nthe KKL LUZERN, the Luzern Culture and Convention Center. Inside is also the KUNSTMUSEUM, a modern art museum, which we partook in. The exhibits were neat! My favorite were photographs by an artist named Candida Hofer. The KKL itself was designed by Jean Nouvel, so the entire building was also really architecturally interesting to me. I loved the emergency exits!! You will see what I am talking about in a picture below.\n\nWe walked across the KAPELLBRUCKE (Chapel Bridge), a wooden bridge that crosses the Reuss River in the city center. It is the oldest covered wooden bridge in Europe! Later, we grabbed drinks at RATHAUS BRAUEREI. Good beer and good company made for a good happy hour 🙂\n\nNext day: MT. RIGI! This is one of the major peaks in the region, also known as Queen of the Mountains. We took a boat to a small town at the bottom of the mountain, rode a cogwheel train up the entire mountain (there are no words for how beautiful this was) and found ourselves 1,800 meters above sea level, in a beautiful, snow-dusted wonderland. We wandered over to a small cottage on the mountain, to be invited in by the friendly Swiss German owner. We ordered coffee in broken German but managed! The wood cabin was so cozy and warm, and this cute cat that perched itself on the shelf of the window held my gaze almost the entire time. I love cats!! And dogs!! Once we finished de-frosting, we braved the mountain again, meandered around the souveneir shop, and caught the cogwheel half way back down the mountain, stopping in a small village where we would then take an aerial cable car back to the bottom. Here, we saw some people frolicking in a hot pool in the middle of the mountains. I later found out that (surprise, surprise) it was designed by Mario Botta. The official name of the spa is the RIGI KALTBAD MINERAL BATHS & SPA. I found a picture online (below), but this is what we saw as we were passing by! I was jealous to say the least. But the aerial cable car back down was fun as well.\n\nOnce back in Luzern, we headed over to the LION MONUMENT, which is a sculpture carved from an existing rock to commemorate Swiss guards who died in 1792 during the French Revolution. I read online that Mark Twain said something to the effect of this sculpture being the saddest and most moving piece of rock in the world. (He also wrote about the beauty of the Alps. About Weggis, {one of the villages we stopped by to get up Mt. Rigi} “I believe that this place is the lovliest in the world, and the most satisfactory. The scenery is beyond comparison beautiful… Sunday in heaven is noisy compared to this quietness.”) There is even a Mark Twain trail you can hike!\n\nFor dinner, Kate and I tried to branch out. We were unsuccessful and ended up at the Rathaus Brauerei again. (To give us some credit, we didn’t eat here the day before!) I got the chef’s plate or something to this effect, and Kate got a traditional cheesy, potatoe-y Swiss meal with some applesauce. Beyond wonderful.\n\nThe next morning we woke up early to get to GENEVA, our last stop. We did the whole Airbnb thing for here. Kate had previously asked our apartment contact when we could check in, and he said any time! So we got to our “Arty and quiet flat, close to lake” to find a man inside! He mumbled to us in French and called the owner. Apparently check-in was any time after 2. The man continues to lecture us about how, in Europe, you never check in early. We were annoyed at his degrading speech regarding check-in times, but glad that we could leave our luggage there because we had scheduled a tour at CERN! (the European Organization for Nuclear Research) {Also, the arty and quiet flat was no disappointment! We loved everything about it – location, quaintness, and the owner was super nice}\n\nSide note: Before we went there, though, we ate lunch at CHEZ MA COUSINE, where we had the most wonderful rotisserie chicken (with this special gravy-type sauce), salad, and french fries. It was relatively cheap for the heaps of food you get, and fast!\n\nSo, CERN – there is a bus that goes all the way out to the complex, but it was taking a while because it was the very last stop. Arriving 15 minutes late, Kate and I were trying to find our way to the reception when I saw a man in a hard hat and an ID tag that had CERN written all over it. I asked him if he knew where reception was, because we were late for the 12:00 tour. He was so kind!!! He said, oh, if you go to reception they will just tell you, “Too bad!” So, he took us back to his office, looked up our tour, and took us to the part of the building where our tour group was. We were very thankful for him.\n\nThe tour was very informative, and free! Basically, CERN studies the fundamental elements that make up the universe. They have a huge, underground machine called the Large Hadron Collider that sits 100 meters below ground that creates particle collisions. The temperature inside the collider is -270 degrees Celsius! (colder than outer space!) When they run the machine, it takes 40 million 3D photographs per second of colliding particles. The computers are able to sift out uninteresting collisions, and saves the potentially “interesting” ones, which people are then able to identify and study. Ps – this is where the world wide web was invented!\n\nThey also had a neat building featuring an interactive exhibit about CERN, which is called the GLOBE OF SCIENCE AND INNOVATION. When I looked it up later I found out it was designed by Herve Dessimoz, from Groupe H Architects, with the help of a wood engineer named Thomas Buchi, from Charpente Concept. It is also apparently the tallest timber domed structure in the world! (27 meters high, 40 meters in diameter) The outerwooden shell is a protective layer for the inner structure, composed of 18 wooden arcs and clad in wooden panels.\n\nKate and I made our way back to the city center after our tour, and grabbed a glass of wine at a cafe called LA CLEMENCE. So cute! This is random- but we were given a little plate of peanuts with our wine. Sometimes peanuts taste so good!! I hardly ever buy them, and if I do but nuts, I usually go for a cashew or almond variety. But peanuts can just really hit the spot sometimes. This was one of those times.\n\nAfter our peanut/wine outing, we grabbed some cheese, pasta, and wine from the grocery store to cook in our arty flat. We ended up drinking the wine and eating the cheese, and not making the pasta. Sometimes that’s just how it goes around here.\n\nThe next day, we woke up, made a visit to the HALLE DE RIVE, an indoor, local food market. This place made me swoon. From the fresh meat to the freshly baked beignets, I was in food heaven.\n\nI also made it a point to go to LADUREE, which is a famous macaroon shop based out of Paris. Salted caramel, vanilla, rose petal, mocha… they were all delicious. And who doesn’t love the presentation?!\n\nToday’s main event was our visit to the UNITED NATIONS. It was 10 francs to tour, but really neat! We got to sit in several meeting rooms and make our way through the building learning about this specific office and how it operates. 8,000 meetings per year and over 1,600 staff members! This office is the second biggest next to the one in New York. The place was bustling with important-looking people in suits the entire time, too!\n\nWe did some more walking and exploring the rest of the afternoon. We also went to the MUSEE D’ART ET D’HISTOIRE (Art history museum). The building itself was beautiful, and actually built on what used to be a fortification ring! Rembrandt, Cezanne, Rodin, and others’ works are here, too.\n\nWe eventually made our way to the local swimming point, taking in some gorgeous views of the sunset before we were about to have the best meal of my life at LA BUVETTE DES BAINS DES PAQUIS. This restaurant does cheese fondue from September to April. Pure joy are the only words to describe it. A tub of melted cheese and bread (& wine) for dinner?? Can I do this every day please? I will attempt a re-make of this with some fondue cheese from the grocery store in a couple weeks. Perks of Swiss grocery stores.\n\n(Oh, and did you know that when you eat cheese fondue, you are supposed to scrape the hard leftover cheese in the bottom of the pan onto your plate and eat it?? A local Genevan told us this. On account of Kate and ours was semi-burnt due to the fact that we didn’t realize we were supposed to stop the fire source ourselves, it wasn’t exactly what it was meant to be- but still yummy!! All the more excuse for me to make fondue again- so I can eat the cheese at the bottom the proper way.)\n\nAnd that was Switzerland ft. Kate! I’m so lucky to have gotten to spend a week in my home away from home with my best friend. Switzerland gets even more beautiful every time I explore it.\n\nSince being back in Mendrisio, we had a little get together in our flat on Friday night, mostly because I wanted an excuse for everyone to come over and try my favorite goodies from the US! I made funfetti cupcakes (Valentine’s Day themed with pink icing!) and set out some peanut butter m&ms and Reese’s. It’s the little things! The peanut butter m&ms were a huge hit, unsurprisingly.\n\nAnd Saturday, I went to the Bellinzona Carnival! Carnival season in Europe is basically like Halloween (in the sense that everyone dresses up, Mean Girls style like Cady, not Karen), but way better. It is called Rabadan in Bellinzona, which means “noise.” This carnival is the second largest in Switzerland! (The first is Basel.) A bunch of bands paraded down the main streets and continued to play music into the night. The costumes are amazing, and so elaborate. And there is also confetti everywhere! The streets were glittered with color, wonderful music, and so many smiling faces. It was beautiful!\n\nAnd classes officially start this week! And it’s been snowing! And I love Switzerland! (Even if they do take all my money.) It’s been a good couple weeks back so far 🙂\n\n~ Haley\n\nLet’s seeee… where was I? Amsterdam! It’s hard to believe that I’m writing about the beginning of December when it is now February… how does time pass by so fast?? Amsterdam was amazing. Let’s clear two things first: yes, it is legal to smoke weed anywhere and yes, prostitutes station themselves like mannequins in street windows in the city center. And YES this place is absolutely beautiful, and Dutch natives are probably the friendliest people I have ever met. AND YES the waffles are out of this world. Okay I’m done with the yes thing. And I know I wasn’t in Belgium, but I was still obsessed with the whole waffle scene. And I like waffles but they’re not my favorite food. (That’d be fried okra, in case you were wondering.) But I think waffles would probably be my favorite food in the Netherlands. At least that’s what my stats tell me after spending a few days there. How many times can I say the word “waffle” before people stop reading this?\n\nSo I met three of my friends there – one studying in Germany, another in Spain, and another who traveled from Tech. We didn’t have any great master plans, and had fun getting lost in a place where every street is a bridge, with some sort of picturesque, slim, post-card-looking buildings in the background. On said streets were also always 40 bikes, and 10 people whizzing by with their babies attached on some sort of seat contraption on the back. (This made me nervous, but it’s just how they roll.)\n\nThe hostel we stayed at was sooooo cooooooool. Stay here if you go! The staff is so nice, theres a cute kitchen, and the people it attracts are most likely young and looking for something/ know of something going on in the city that night. It’s called ECOMAMA.\n\nOur first breakfast out we ate at a cute little cafe called FONTEYN, where there’s a precious cat, some good coffee and breakfast sandwiches, and a quaint atmosphere. Don’t mistake precious for nice though.. it bit my friend when she got a little too handsy.\n\nWe also went to the STEDELIJK MUSEUM, a modern art museum. The museum was beautiful! And the art was beautiful, and there were so many interactive displays and films. I definitely recommend it.\n\nObviously we went to the IAMSTERDAM sign. No use in pretending I’m not a tourist when I clearly am. We had some lovely background scenery, included but not limited to large electronic signs flashing: “WHITE HEROIN SOLD TO TOURISTS AS COCAINE” and “TOURISTS IN HOSPITAL – THREE HAVE DIED.”\n\nContinuing with the tourist theme.. we went on a night time boat tour of the Amsterdam light festival! Sounds beautiful right?? Okay well I had some picturesque image in my mind, that even though it was pushing below 10 degrees with wind chill, we would be in a quaint, open-aired boat marveling at the beautiful buildings and lights reflecting on the skinny canal waters. What we got was a completely enclosed boat, with some cheap plastic material that fogged up when everyone loaded ship, plus some complimentary chex mix. Oh and we indulged in a cheap bottle of wine. Alright it wasn’t horrible, but this I do not recommend. It was still cool and I can say I did it, but we were counting down the minutes til we could hop off and go do something else.\n\nWe went out on the town a couple nights, and PARADISO was one of the places worth mentioning- it’s a multistory club housed inside of an old church. Bars, stage, music, lights – everything! It was so fun.\n\nWe went to a place that just said “PANCAKES STEAK HOUSE” for breakfast one morning… it wasn’t bad! I’d give the name a 2 and the food a 5.5.\n\nCaitie and I ventured to the industrial side of town that day, where we looked out over the city atop the SKYLOUNGE AMSTERDAM, which is just a bar at the top of a Hilton hotel. No fees, nothing! Just head straight up to the view.\n\nWe also walked on top of NEMO, which is a science center that mimics the design of a ship.\n\nThat was basically Amsterdam.. then I headed over to DUSSELDORF, GERMANY for the night to stay with Caitie. We went to some German Christmas markets (AMAZING) and drank German beer. My stomach was delighted by the pretzels, candied nuts, beer, gluehwein (hot red wine with Christmas-y spices), potatoes, and more beer. I really don’t know how I didn’t gain 40 pounds abroad.\n\nBack in Mendrisio… a bunch of work awaited me. The final studio push got me… real good. Continuous nights of 3 hours of sleep, a couple all-nighters, and I was toast. One night when my studio partner and I were making our model, I realized we had just glued two things together wrong, at which point I started screaming, “HELP!!! HANNAH IT’S NOT FUNNY!!!! HELP! HELP!” And then my friend (who’s studio was on the opposite side of the building) came over and said she heard me screaming from her desk. I asked if she definitely knew it was me and she was like um DUH! Of course it was you! She continued to mimic my American-sounding high-pitched cries for help. It was all worth it in the end though! I was content with the final presentation. Here are a few pictures!\n\nIn between the crazy studio stuff I found time to visit my friends in Riva to watch the Grinch and get in the Christmas spirit, and I also made it to the Lugano Christmas market one Saturday! No one wanted to go with me so I put on my big girl pants and took myself out for a nice evening. I wrote down everything I ate: Gluewhein, a weird fruity drink, raclette (cheesy bread), roasted chestnuts, hot chocolate, AND to top it off a Toblerone McFlurry from McDonalds. Also, I would like to point out that as I’m writing this post, Toblerone is underlined as being spelled wrong, while McFlurry is not. That concerns me a little bit. But I can’t really complain because the Toblerone McFlurry was out of this world.\n\nIn the days leading to my departure back to the homeland, everyone at the casa just hung out and relaxed.. which hadn’t truly happened since the very beginning of the semester. So that was nice too 🙂\n\nAnd theeeeen we all know what happens next.. United States of America!! The second I arrived at my gate in Frankfurt, whose destination was New Jersey, I felt like I was already back. I happened to sit next to two gossipy girls and realized why Americans annoy Europeans. Nevertheless, it was nice to be able to actually fully understand conversations happening around you, as opposed to the random phrases I pick up on in side conversations in Italian.\n\nAnd I have honestly loved being home, and am so glad I got to spend the holidays with family and friends. From Ashland to Richmond to Tennessee to Lake Gaston to Blacksburg to Charlottesville to Blacksburg again and back to Ashland, I wouldn’t have changed a thing about my time here. It’s crazy how much life gets slapped into perspective when you do things out of the ordinary, like live in Europe for 4 months. I am so thankful for this life and the family and friends I get to call mine. Here are a couple of highlights. And of course I have a Brian Andreas quote to go with it…!\n\nWho can say that moment when Love takes the shape of the people in your days? It is a simple thing & still I have nothing to say other than Yes. That moment is who we are here to be. ~ Brian Andreas\n\nxxoo Haley\n\nOh Sundayssss. I’m trying to feverishly write this blog post because I think it’s going to have to be my last one before I can write about the rest of my semester here in the comfort of my own cloud crazy comfy bed surrounded by my soft pink walls and an Anthropologie candle afire on my bedside table. I’m melting just thinking about it.\n\nI listened to this Perfect Day song when I was running this morning, and it hasn’t left my brain since. Such a good running song. And also not a bad song to have stuck in your head when you are in studio for 6 hours trying to figure out how to build a six foot tall wooden model for your final presentation! And no, that’s no exaggeration. Praying everything fits together right at the end…!\n\nAnyway, this post is mostly for the amazing day trip I went on yesterday with my Architecture in Ticino class- we visited three close by cities in Switzerland where some traditionally local architecture is sited, those being LOCARNO, LOSONE, and ASCONA.\n\nWe started off by stopping by a rec center named CENTRO SPORTIVO NAZIONALE DELLA GIOVENTU in TENERO designed by Mario Botta. Botta founded the academy I study at, and his buildings are literally all over the place, and you can usually spot them by their distinct brick facades. In this project, there is a large volume for the gym at the core, some changing spaces/bathrooms occupy the perimeter, and it resolves in a huge portico-type space outside. Some administration and living facilities sit adjacent to it.\n\nThen, we had the opportunity to visit the SCUOLE MEDIE DI VIA VARESI in LOCARNO, designed by Dolf Schebli, with Ernst Engeler, Isidor Ryser, and Bernhard Meyer. It was a Saturday, so there was an administrator who let us in and explore the school. Boy is this the nicest elementary school I’ve ever been in. This design won the competition that was held for its creation, and used elements of a school designed by Walter Gropius as a part of the Architects’ Collaborative. Every classroom has its own skylight, so there was a ton of natural light. Glass doors in the hallways are able to be turned perpendicular to allow natural ventilation into the school, and everything was detailed down to the beautiful coat/ backpack hangers.\n\nThe SCUOLE ELEMENTARI AI SALEGGI DI LOCARNO was designed by Livio Vacchini and was right across the street. This one was completely different- the purpose was to integrate the school with the city. Which is kind of weird for an elementary school.. at least for me. Usually you see this with colleges in big cities. So there were many outdoor spaces and some nice courtyard-like spaces to explore. Again, there was a gym here as well. My professor explained to us that Vacchini (the architect) likes to create things which seem immediately very rational and sensical, but he likes to be somewhat unorthodox or visually deceptive upon a closer glance. For example, the gym facade looked very neo-classical, with the same repeated columns on center with a traditional portico. But, there are only 9 columns (usually there are an even number), and the middle column (which is on the same axis as the thick wall which separates the two gym spaces inside) is thicker than all of the others.\n\nAnother school we visited was the SCUOLE MEDIE DI LOSONE, designed by Livio Vacchini and Aurelio Galfetti. This school uses the city as a modular reference, as there were four big blocks of classrooms with a central courtyard, all existing within a grid. The views from the classrooms were amazing- these double-heighted rooms had such nice qualities of light and views out to the mountains and exterior courtyards/ gardens. Honestly, I think I would be a bit distracted trying to learn here! And the crazy red steel structure was a little bizarre. It was really neat being able to walk around all of these schools though, and see how they’re currently used.\n\nWe paused for lunch on LAGO MAGGIORE in ASCONA. (This is the same lake my island is located in, except way more south!) The views were amazing. I found a quote the other day I scribbled down from the book Beautiful Ruins by Jess Walter, which was “He considered it a shame when people couldn’t grasp the infinite- a failure not just of imagination but of simple vision.” The mountains here and the clear blue waters are really so amazing, and I don’t think I’ll cease to stare at them in wonder.\n\nWe then had the wonderful opportunity to tour Livio Vacchini’s house! (CASA VACCHINI) His wife and daughter showed us around, which was so sweet. This modular unit is made of steel structure and wooden infill. Modest in size, the wood infill panels are removable/ additive as need be- which I found pretty neat! The outdoor garden is almost like the most important room of the whole house- it was beautiful.\n\nThen, there was Vacchini’s PALESTRA in LOSONE (another gym). You enter underground, to walk up the stairs and into a large, unobstructed court. There were two viewing platforms on either end, but other than that it’s just you, the structure, and the light coming through into the space! The building looks really imposing from the outside but actually really light and spacious from the inside- or so I thought.\n\nThe last two buildings were not my favorite, and designed by Vacchini in his later years, which were the EDIFICIO AMMINISTRATIVO E COMMERCIALE LA FERRIERA (an office building) and EDIFICIO POSTALE (post office), both in LOCARNO. Still, it was interesting to see this more modern approach in the city center compared to his other architecture, which is considered typically Ticinese.\n\nSo, that was 11/22/2014 in a nutshell! Beautiful day.\n\nOh, and the day before yesterday was the final exhibition of all my architecture friends in Riva! It was so nice to see what they’ve been working on all semester, from projects to pictures to sketches. Karaoke was sung after, etc. etc.\n\nAnd other than that, work, work, work, all day long! My project in a nutshell is a proposal to provide more housing in the form of bird towers for this exotic island, as well as sculpturally and organically expand the existing reed beds around the island in the form of a fixed, movable steel system that moves with the water level. This system is proposed in response to two existing conditions, which are an overpopulation of birds and also the constantly changing water level of the lake by 3 meters (about 10 feet) throughout the year. Our final critiques are on December 16th and 17th, and then I come home on the 21st! The last few weeks of studio always go by the fastest even though you’re there more than ever.. it’s like a timeless blur of the computer screen, glue, and late night pizza (and here chocolate!!).\n\nBut this week I go to Amsterdam!! Wow can’t believe I can actually say that. I am pretty nervous to travel here to Milano to the Bergamo airport to the Netherlands all by my big girl self.. wish me safe travels please!! Until RVA…!\n\n~ Haley\n\nI have eaten haggis!!! (11/9/2014) Okay, so anyone who knows me in the slightest I think will view this as a huge accomplishment for me. I will enlighten you should you not know what it is (according to Wikipedia): “a savoury pudding containing sheep’s pluck (heart, liver, and lungs); minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock and traditionally encased in the animal’s stomach and simmered for approximately three hours.” Um, I’m sorry, encased in the sheep’s stomach to cook?? It still kind of makes me cringe.. I know I am definitely a carnivore but something about this just seems especially repulsive. So, thanks to Rachael, my Scottish friend who made this Scottish delicacy, along with some other things that resembled shepherd’s pie, AKA delicious. I even had a swig of Scottish whiskey- instant body warmer-upper! Traditional Scottish meal: check.\n\nOh and the day before that (11/8/2014) I went to the FIERA DI SAN MARTINO. AKA a carnival!! This used to be an organized cattle market dedicated to the patron saint of St. Martin. And it still is! But what used to be strictly agricultural (selling cows and whatnot), now its fully equipped with alcohol, cotton candy, and rides. {All good things in life.} We tasted local wines of Ticino, I ate polenta with onion soup, and screamed on a fair ride like a little kid. It was awesome.\n\nBut really, nothing super exciting to report. Except that’s kind of a ridiculous thing to say because when I look back and remember that time I spent the year in Switzerland I know I’d read that sentence and be like, ugh, Haley stop. My experience here has really been amazing. I am completely immersed in European culture, as most everyone I live with is European. I get to sit in on famous architects giving critiques on students’ projects. I get to grocery shop in Italy on a regular basis. I get to have the excuse of eating way too much chocolate cuz YOISW (you’re only in Switzerland once). {I just made that up. Catchy eh?!} I get to learn how to travel internationally independently, budget, cook! I get to appreciate, even more, the things I love about my home in Virginia. Gosh I could go on and on about the “get-to’s.” Being completely removed from my home and being a long-term guest in someone else’s has proved to be such a beautiful experience for me, and it’s not even halfway over!\n\nAnyway, here in Mendrisio there has been this thing called RAIN. And nonstop. And of course.. my Leadership in Architecture course had a site visit on (I’m pretty sure) the one day where it never, ever stopped raining at an alarmingly heavy rate. It was only three train stops away, but still. Even with my rainboots, rain jacket, and dinky Rome umbrella (okay, well that kinda doesn’t have too much to offer), I was still so uncomfortably wet the entire trip/day. We were touring a government building that was to be located on the 2nd floor, with a grocery store underneath on the street level. It was entirely made of concrete, with this brick facade/ shading device in front. The tour was also entirely in Italian, needless to say I didn’t quite pick up on everything, but it was still a really nice tour of the building!\n\nWe had our intermediate critiques this week, and have 4 weeks left to finish our projects!! Time is going by so fast I can’t believe my eyes. I also say that time is going by so fast almost every day to at least one person.. I am just so incredulous! And I just have so much to look forward to.. going home to see Mom and Steve and all my frands, to Tennessee to see Dad, uncle, aunt, and cousins.. then back to Switzerland with my best friend to kick of my second semester abroad! (THANK GOODNESS Kate got engaged AFTER she bought her plane tickets here and back… Love ya for that one, Ben.) I am one lucky girl to have such amazing family and friends. OH and did I mention I’m going to Amsterdam the day after Thanksgiving to meet some of my friends from Virginia Tech there?? And then stay with my friend Caitie after that in Dusseldorf, Germany? I can barely keep up with myself!\n\nBut I did have a lazy weekend… so I went to the FoxTown outlet yesterday (11/15/2014) (they have two locations, here and Shanghai.) Who would have thought this huge outlet of all major European brand names would be here in little Mendrisio?! It’s kinda funny because there are three levels- and as you go up each level the stores become more prestigious and more expensive. So you could find Gucci, Prada, Dior, Valentino, Versace, Fendi, Burberry, etc. etc. I went by myself, (again- heavily raining! The weather here has been almost non-stop rain for a week. It makes me want to do nothing but sleep to the sound in my cozy bed and watch Gilmore Girls. I’m almost done with Season 5 btw.) which was so nice because I could spend as long or as little time anywhere, and not be worrying about annoying someone else. I think that’s also why I like to go grocery shopping alone.. a girl’s got to be making the right decisions regarding these things! And I may have fallen victim to buying not one but two pairs of shoes.. whoops! I had recently been thinking of going to a Swiss spa to get some massage therapy in, but yesterday I made the decision to go retail therapy all the way. Chocolate, a dress, and a gift for momma also found me in Foxtown 🙂\n\nWhen I got back from walking back 15 minutes in the rain with my five shopping bags, I decided to bake a cake for one of my roommate’s birthdays, on account of it was last week, I live with him, and didn’t even know it! Ugh #studiolife. I was so so proud of myself for making a homemade chocolate cake AND homemade icing! And it didn’t taste terrible! I actually ate it again today, when it hadn’t just come out of the oven, and it was still good! That’s the true test. Also, whilst baking this cake I officially began to get in the Christmas spirit. Mariah Carey, Britney Spears, and Michael Buble Christmas tunes and all. This week I bought a Swiss chocolate advent calendar and a German gingerbread house. Hey, only one month til Christmas basically!! It’s not that crazy. (And Elf might or might not be playing on Netflix as I write this blog post..)\n\nSo here we are now on Sunday! (11/16/2014) Thank the heavens it was not raining today, I got in a nice run this morning on my usual route. Here’s a taste of what I run through when I workout- no wonder it’s not hard to find the motivation to get moving when you can literally run on a mountain turning into a gorgeous ombre of red and orange next to the blue, blue lake. My two FAVORITE things by the way. Mountains and water. It’s one of the reasons why I’m so obsessed with Seattle. Put me in a place with these humbling wonders of nature and I am happy as a clam.\n\nLast weekend (10/25/2014) I went to Milan on a day trip with a few friends! (Because when you live in the Italian canton of Switzerland you can do things like take an hour train ride to the fashion capital of the world for the day. Nbd.)\n\nTechnically, I’ve been to Milano Centrale (the train station) like at least 10 times already. But I had never spent any time outside of here except to grab some food. It was so so fun to walk around and experience the city! We didn’t really have anything on the agenda, except to go to one museum in the historic city center.\n\nOh, and obviously I fashion-ista’d up to go! Jk, I just put on a Flash Tattoo. Yes, I said tattoo! As in those temporary Disney princess tattoos you wear when you’re five. Except these are WAY cooler (well actually that depends on my mood) and made for women. Here’s a picture of my most recent one!\n\nThey stay on for about a week or two and then just scrub off with hot water and soap. I saw them in South Moon Under before I left the country, and thought they looked so stupid, until I saw them on one of the girls working there and it was love at first sight! They have necklaces, bracelets, rings, earrings, etc.. it’s up to you to get creative with them, which is half the fun! Here’s their website if anyone’s interested 🙂\n\nhttp://www.flashtat.com/\n\nSo, anyway, when we got to Milan we hopped off the train to take the subway to the Garibaldi station, where we then just wandered into the city! The first thing we saw when we walked outside was this huge, GREEN high rise building. I usually only see things like this in magazines.. it’s called BOSCO VERTICALE and, as you can see, is this huge, green high rise apartment building!! Pretty crazy huh?\n\nThen, we stopped at a cafe where I ordered a CAFFE SHAKERATO, a common Italian coffee drink. It’s essentially cold espresso with a little water and sugar. But it was very yummy! I also don’t think I’ve mentioned.. “caffe” in Europe is espresso. Then there’s lattes and cappuccinos. American coffee does not really exist here, so when you say “caffe Americano”, it means espresso with hot water, although that isn’t really the same either because the default “coffee” at home is drip coffee. I have a feeling I’ll be a little bit of a coffee snob after spending a year in Europe.. but I will never in a million years criticize or tire of Starbuck’s pumpkin spice lattes or peppermint mochas. WHO CARES that they’re horrible for you and contain fake ingredients.. so do a million other things we eat and they taste like heaven.\n\nA few minutes later I spy a bakery. And when I am in Italy I will not not walk into a bakery and buy something. I just went in and said.. hmm. Vorrei (I would like) uhh.. questo e questo e…. questo! E questo. E questo. This was the result, and I was very happy with my purchases.\n\nWe wandered closer to the historic city center and came upon the DUOMO. There was a huge white tarp covering the square, and tons of paint buckets with paint brushes in them- people writing, drawing, etc. anything! I decided to be SO original and write my name.\n\nThen we headed to the MUSEO DEL NOVECENTO, or the museum of the 20th century, or the museum of modern art. A new exhibition had just opened up, on Milanese artist Yves Klein and Parisian artist Lucia Fontana, and how they were both integral figures in the modern art movement in their respective regions. There was a huge installation of blue pigment (this was Klein’s “thing” this blue pigment, blue pigment on a canvas, on a body, on a sculpture, in 3d) that was part of the exhibition. By the time we got to this part of the exhibit, there were two little footprints in the pigment and then a trail of blue footprints… It made walking through the rest of the museum so amusing because you could see these faint little blue spots EVERYWHERE.\n\nBy the time we finished here, I was sooo hungry. One of my friends had a recommendation from a friend about a good aperitivo place. We took the subway a few stops and arrived at BHANGRABAR. You got your choice of cocktail and endless food for 10 euros. I took a mojito (VERY strong by the way) and hmm.. food.. quinoa, french fries, tomato salad, pizza, two different types of pasta, puff pastries, seafood, tuna salad, brownies, nutella… the list goes on.\n\nThe school week went by as fast as all the other ones (um I can’t believe I only have 6 weeks left??!) and today (11/2/2014) we went to Como again. Always a good stand-by/ day trip when you don’t have anything planned! It is All-Saints Day here so everything in Switzerland was closed, but Como was just as bustling as ever on this beautiful, sunny day! Italy how I adore you so!\n\nAgain, no real plans here- we just walked around! So much window shopping here is killing me. I have not given in to the temptation yet, but who knows how long I’ll last! I had done some research before we left on pizzerias and led my friends to a place about a 15 minute walk from the city center. (With the app CITYMAPS2GO, I’m a pro navigator. Without it, don’t ask me anything about anywhere.) We ate at PIZZERIA TRATTORIA DA BENITO, and it was sooo good. I had the proscuitto and mushroom pizza, which was simply divine and so filling.\n\nFollowing, we walked back towards Lake Como and stumbled upon LA TERME DI COMO ROMANA, or a parking garage where, when they started digging into the ground, discovered some ancient Roman ruins {a thermal bath specifically}. It was pretty cool, plus the facade of the parking garage was this copper-like material with small, punched openings. It isn’t often you can say, “hey that parking garage looks cool!” But this guy was definitely one of them.\n\nWhen we got back by the lake we discovered another outdoor market (we’d been running into them all day). But this one was food exclusively. I grabbed two bottles of wine and then started asking the meat guys questions, and before I knew it I was tasting like five different salamis and meats (remember, I had just eaten a whole pizza) and walked away with half a fresh Italian salami 🙂\n\nThen we went to the grocery store.. are we noticing a pattern here people?? Where I bought two more bottles of wine, some chicken (because meat is so pricey in Svizzera), some salad and granola.\n\nThere was a bunch of stuff in between, but mostly just wondering around the city, people watching, and window shopping! It really was such a nice day, this day.\n\nOnce we got back (oh, we also got supplies to make sushi tonight while we were out) I helped my Belgian friend prepare sushi and roll it!! So, now I know how to make sushi, as taught by a Belgian. I am definitely going to try to do this when I am home.. it was actually so easy!! A little time consuming, but so much fun.\n\nNo Halloween for me this year… they do the whole pumpkin and fall-y decorating thing here, but not so much the dress up thing. BUT you guys be on the lookout for February, when the Bellinzona carnival happens. Apparently this huge festival lasts a week long and everyone dresses up, so it’s essentially Halloween in February and you can betcha I’ll be in attendance.\n\nHappy NOVEMBER everyone!!\n\n~ Haley\n\nBefore I go into yet another discourse on my eating habits.. Okay let’s see.. Germany! We had a very tightly packed schedule in our 1.5 days in Munich. It started with a 5.5 hour car ride with four Portugese friends, and my first German meal was at a McDonalds! Woohoo! I tried to ask for ranch with my McNuggets… definitely unsuccessful and resulted in a salty cashier attendant. (Also, the nuggets did taste a little different, more bland, and the fries tasted the same.) We get to the hostel a little before 12, and we are staying at HI MUNICH PARK HOSTEL. This time, it was real!! None of that fake Rome stuff. Plus, breakfast was included for real this time!!\n\nOur travels!! This is really history rich and much to do with postwar architecture since uh.. that’s why I came!!\n\nFirst day 10/10/14\n\nWe went to CHURCH ST. BONIFAZ.\n\nIt was founded by Ludwig I in 1835, and completed by architect Georg Friedrich Ziebland in 1850. The church was heavily damaged in WWII and a reconstruction of the church was completed by Hans Dollgast beginning 1945 through 1952. We paid specific attention to the reconstructed part, which took place towards the end of the nave/ beginning of the transept.\n\nThen we walked over to ALTE PINAKOTHEK, an art gallery that was originally designed by Leo von Klenze in the beginning of the 19th century, and then restored after the war by Hans Dollgast. If you’re noticing a pattern here, he was really popular for his “creative reconstruction” works during the post-war period. Damaged and missing parts of this building weren’t imitated to look like the rest, but reconstructed in a modern style that used the bricks of previously destroyed buildings during the war.\n\nThe KONIGSPLATZ was Ludwig I’s idea of all realms of life- cultural, civic, an religious- embedded in a picturesque green context. It was designed by Leo von Klenze in 1816, but was used during the Third Reich as a rally point for the Nazis. The entire square was plastered over with granite, to hold huge ceremonies and marches through the center of town. The Nazi headquarters was held just across the street at the BROWN HOUSE.\n\nWe walked over to the Brown House, and in front of it is a new building under construction called the NS DOCUMENT CENTER, designed by Georg Scheel Wetzel Architekten. A local professor gave us some background history of the area and showed us through the building! He told us that even though Berlin became the political center of the Nazi party during the war, Munich was always the capital of the Nazi movement. After WWII, a lot of the Nazi artifacts and buildings began to hide under overgrown vegetation, and it hasn’t been until relatively recently that people have decided to really uncover these places and decide how to deal with them. The new building, located near 4 major historical sites relating to Nazi history, has openings on various levels that frame a view to the corresponding historically significant site, housing exhibitions and information regarding the place in view as you move through the museum.\n\nWe paid a visit to the GLYPTOTHEK, which houses many ancient sculptures, ranging from the archaic era to the Roman era. (This is located in Konigsplatz.) This museum was also commissioned by Ludwig I, designed by Leo von Klenz and built in the early 19th century. Walking through the museum was an effortless movement from one space to the next- it was a beautiful exhibition!\n\nWe grabbed lunch at HAMBURGEI, where I had a deeeeelicious Bavarian hamburger and some German Coca Cola! Now that’s what I call a pretzel buns, my friends.\n\nWe walked by the AMERIKAHAUS, which was a program developed after WWII, operated by the United States, that gave German and Austrian citizens the opportunity to learn more about American politics and culture.\n\nWe had the opportunity to visit the ODEON, which was a former concert hall, and now services an office building. This space was really unique! Again designed by Leo von Klenze, it was almost completely destroyed in the war and rebuilt after. The hall consists of two superimposed colonnades, reaching a height of 50 feet. Now, it is an interior courtyard, and the ceiling (which was originally decorated with elaborate frescoes) exists as a glazed roof designed by Ackermann and Partner. The quality of light and atmosphere here was really soothing to me for some reason- our class spent about 30 minutes in this courtyard, looking around at the wall sculptures and up at diffuse light coming in through the lattice ceiling structure.\n\nWe then walked by the RESIDENZ (ROYAL CASTLE) which is really in the heart of the city center. This was the royal palace of the Bavarian monarchs, and it is now the largest city palace in Germany. We didn’t go inside, but the thing was huge! Apparently it has ten courtyards within the building and 130 rooms. Around the palace there were a bunch of cafes and people playing something that looked similar to Bocce Ball.\n\nWe then made our way to the HAUS DER KUNST, which was commissioned by Hitler in 1933 and designed by Paul Ludwig Troost. This was the first monumental Nazi architecture, and was meant to house the art that only Hitler thought Germany should accept and support as a part of their culture. Across the street in 1937, there was a Degenerate art exhibition held in which all modern art was plastered on the walls and written on with heinous phrases dismissing the artwork. Hitler also gave many speeches in the main hall here. After the war, American forces occupied the building, even using the bar in the back as a place to socialize. (It still exists today!) Now, it is home to only modern art exhibitions. Our guide of the building noted that the heightened, monumental, totalitarian feel of the building was an ideal condition for displaying many forms of modern art. There really are still such strong feelings regarding the reuse or remembrance of Nazi buildings, and that became very evident upon actually visiting all of these places.\n\nThe last stop of the day was the OLYMPIC STADIUM, designed by Gunther Behnisch and engineer Frei Otto for the 1972 Summer Olympics. And it was beautiful at sunset! The thing you notice first is definitely the large, fluid acrylic glass that soars over the stadium, anchored to the ground by steel cables. This light, airy construction was meant to be a gesture towards the new German government, optimistic and forward-looking. The official motto was actually “The Happy Games.” The facility was used later for several other matches, but the soccer players began to complain that they really couldn’t compete in this space because of its light, open, and fluid nature. It apparently didn’t foster enough of a competitive environment, which makes sense on account of that’s not what the design was trying to do!\n\nWe also passed by BMW WORLD on the way out, so we had a look inside! Although, surprise surprise, I’m not too big on staring at fancy cars unless I’m about to drive one away, so we only stayed for a bit. We did, however, study this building in my environmental building systems class last year because of its play on artificial light with daylight, natural ventilation, heating, and cooling. I do recall being comfortable in terms of body temperature and atmosphere, so all in all it was a successful drive-by. (Get my play on words there??)\n\nSome more pictures of Germany:\n\nSecond day 10/11/2014\n\nThis was a rather heavy-hearted day, as we only made 2 stops: The JUDISCHES ZENTRUM (A Jewish centre with a synagogue, museum, and community center) and the GEDENKSTATTE KZ DACHAU (the concentrations camp).\n\nThe synagogue in ST. JAKOBS PLATZ was beautiful. The quality of light and space was breathtaking.\n\nThe museum was so interesting. The main focus of the museum concerned itself with the Jewish in Germany beginning with WWI, the progressive attitude of Germans toward the Jewish, as well as the cultural and familial aspects of Jews living in Germany. No pictures were allowed of the exhibit, but we spent a good hour and half or two making our way through the exhibition.\n\nIt then took us about a 40 minute train ride and a 15 minute bus ride to arrive at the Dachau concentration camp. I don’t really feel the need to give too much historical background regarding this site, but being here felt very surreal. It was interesting to read signs posted throughout the camp with specifics regarding daily life and functions of specific places- things I hadn’t read in textbooks before. There were also three new constructions built on the camp, which are: the JEWISH MEMORIAL, the CATHOLIC MORTAL AGONY OF CHRIST CHAPEL, and the PROTESTANT CHURCH OF RECONCILIATION. It was interesting to see how architects chose to approach this site, for example, the chapel was placed along the strong existing axes of the camp, while the protestant church contained no right angles to break from the rigidity of the original plan, and descends into part of the earth to further break the camp grounds.\n\nBefore we left the city,we ventured back on our own through the city center again, making sure to stop by a gelato place called BALLA BENI, which was recommended to me by one of my friends who is a German exchange student here and studies in Munich. Five words: yum yum yum yum and yum. The flavors were really unique!! I had chocolate ginger and maroni, with a “taste” (they give you an extra spoon of something to try- why hasn’t this been adopted by ice cream servers worldwide??) of the basil lemon.\n\nWe then took a stroll through the ENGLISH GARDEN, which was absolutely amazing!! Essentially, it’s the Central Park of Munich, but bigger! So many people were out on this sunny Sunday afternoon. I think we walked a little over a mile before reaching the CHINESISCHER TURM (Chinese Tower) where the happiest place on earth was: the beer garden! As soon as I saw this tower, equipped with traditional Bavarian musicians on the second level, my immediate first thought was: THIS LOOKS EXACTY LIFE BUSCH GARDENS! Well done, Busch Gardens. Feels like I’m in Williamsburg, only I know I won’t be stoping for Pierces BBQ on the way home. It was too bad we had too leave before we could enjoy one of those liters of beer… Munich, I’ll be back!\n\nWeek of 10/13/2014\n\n~Normal, run-of-the-mill stuff, folks! I’m studying abroad so I do work here from time to time.\n\n~Still finding it hard to practice/learn Italian because English is the language spoken where I live among all of the exchange students.\n\n~Went to Lugano last Tuesday to a bar called COYOTE UGLY, which then sparked the idea to sing “Can’t Fight the Moonlight” at karaoke on Friday night in Riva. It was also 3 for 10 CHF tequila shots!\n\n~Had a critique on Thursday, we are in the process of designing a bird observatory for researchers around our island- Isolina Partegora.\n\n~Visited our site on Friday, which is located in ANGERA, ITALY. It took two trains and a bus to get there, but the town was beautiful! It’s so fun researching something so fully, looking at creepy street views and photographs of a place, and feeling like you’ve actually already been there, before you actually go and visit! (When we got there I had salame piccante pizza for lunch at the restaurant in HOTEL PAVONE. No shame that I finished the whole thing- it was so so good.) We took some time to walk along the inlet that surrounds the town, of LAGO MAGGIORE. Our island is really small, about 3500 square meters, and not really accessible to people, due to the exotic birds and wildlife that have claimed the island as home. Our job is to figure out how/where to build our observatory for the island. Visiting made me so much more excited to get moving with the project! It also wasn’t terrible that we found a local bakery, where I got an assortment of desserts and proceeded to eat them all within the minute.\n\n~This past Saturday, the international office here at the university offered to pay for our travel and lunch to visit BELLINZONA, which is the capital of TICINO, the province of Switzerland where I live. We started the Saturday off early and were greeted by our tour guide in Bellinzona at CASTELGRANDE. The Castle sits on a huge rock. It was built in the late 14th century and occupied by the Sforza dukes of Milan until the 15th century. There is a rich history of the Italian rule and the Swiss interest in the area, ultimately ending with the Swiss (obviously) conquering Bellinzona, essentially creating the Ticinese part of Switzerland, or the Italian part of Switzerland. Pizza for lunch, coffee after…. a usual meal here in Italian Switzerland. Myself and a couple friends ventured around Bellinzona and the next closest mountain village, called MONTE CARASSO from late afternoon until evening. The night ended with having aperitvo and listening to a live band, all with the Swiss Alps in the background! It was a pretty successful day, and it was so nice to be a tourist of a nearby place that is very culturally significant and relevant to my small town of Mendrisio!\n\n~ The highlight of my Sunday was traveling to IPER with my Riva friends and former professor. They have a van, which we drove in for about 15 minutes before arriving at the Walmart equivalent in Italy. Basically everything is more expensive in Switzerland, but the highlights of my purchases included (but were not limited to): Italian meat kebabs, 1 euro bread loafs, 2 euro fresh pizza dough, body wash, nutella, apples, cauliflower, and parmesan cheese. Oh, and pasta is dirt cheap (in Switzerland, too, but especially in Italy). I’ll be able to look back on my abroad experience.. remember when I ate pasta every day and a pounds of chocolate every week? Also.. my four types of extra virgin olive oils: a cheap one for cooking things on the stove, my really nice one from Florence, a middle-of-the road one that I got when I first got here, and a new, nicer olive oil from Iper. Extra virgin olive oil is my jam. I love it so much. And grocery shopping is seriously one of my favorite things to do here. Although.. sometimes the whole everything-being-in-Italian thing throws me off. I know I’ll be excited to walk into a Kroger at home and actually 100% understand what I am buying.. but til then I’m perfectly happy buying Italian meets, cheeses, and wines because usually, you can’t go too wrong!\n\nAND FINALLY I think I have successfully recapped the last 10 days or so.\n\nXxoo Haley\n\nIt’s already the middle of October!! Since when did this happen? This title is a song called “Dance for You” by a band called the Dirty Projectors. I think it’s pretty self-explanatory, the word choice. I managed to have my first “blah” week in my **whole new dazzling world** last week, for no particular reason. It is difficult to not get caught up in this silly thing called life sometimes. Just keep dancin’ {https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJutn2OXDZE} This is my own personal BuzzFeed list of pick-me-ups:\n\n1. Text my big. My best friend, role model, and personal chef, the one and only, Rachael Brennan. I texted her last week in my state of weird funk and it took two words of me saying, cheer me up I’m stressed and lonely!! (okay that was 7) to get these responses:\n\nShe’s the best 🙂\n\n2. Eat chocolate. That leads me to my next story.. I decided to give up chocolate for four days because I really do have an addiction. Before it was all laughs, now, not so much!! I literally could not stop eating it. So I made it for 2/4 days without eating chocolate, allowing Rachael to finally convince me to go out and buy a value pack. Instant happiness. And I really think the two day fast did me good, made me realize that chocolate isn’t air and probably in my best interest to do with a little less of it. Moderation, Haley!!\n\n3. Go on the free people blog.\n\nhttp://blog.freepeople.com/\n\nWhere they always have a weekly horoscope, a Monday quote, and interesting articles!! Like, did you actually know that drinking cold water in the morning is bad for you? Because it slows down your digestive system? Or, about this thing called chi running and how you should never look at a point too far in the distance, or directly at the ground. Just straight ahead! + a bunch of other things about posture and cadence, etc. It’s really an interesting article.. {http://blog.freepeople.com/2014/09/basic-principles-chi-running-angela-james/}\n\n4. Go through my iPhoto library\n\nJoy, joy joy! I instantly see all my friends and families’ faces smiling and laughing. I remember, oh yeah, this is the reason I like to be annoying and always take pictures of everywhere, everything, and everyone!! This video of my little cousins Hannah and Lindsey always makes me laugh.. They were one my computer messing around with photo booth and could not stop giggling. So stinkin cute.\n\n5. Watch Gilmore Girls. Ahhh, Netflix. What would I do without you? You, me, and my bed make a lovely love triangle.\n\n6. Go to Munich\n\nOkay, not really an everyday option, but my Postwar Architecture class trip to Germany was this past weekend! I will likely add my itinerary and photos from this trip later this week because I need time to go through them and reflect on everything. What could be more pick-me-up material than going to a beautiful foreign city, looking at a bunch of architecture, eating German pastries, drinking German beer, and buying chocolate with Oreos in it because they don’t have it in Switzerland?? (cough cough Kellen) Just some little highlights of my trip.\n\n7. Last but not least, Brian Andreas is always the answer!! He actually just finished a new book recently called Something Like Magic (on remembering how to be alive). This is an part of his introduction to his book that he posted online:\n\n“Each one {all his little stories} is something like magic, because all it takes is a moment of remembering them & suddenly the whole world sparkles again. The funny thing is it never stopped sparkling. We just stopped seeing it, because it was too simple & we were convinced it must be something different. We let ourselves be convinced the most important thing was something different than the love & magic that’s been here all along.\n\nI sat in the garden that night & I thought about the most important thing for me. That we love & are loved. All the time, in every moment, no matter how it looks to other eyes that don’t remember quite yet. That’s why I think remembering is one of the most important things we can do right now. It’s how we stop & see the world again for the very first time. In all of its aching beauty & join & pain. The immensity of all of it. It’s how we open to being loved wildly & deliciously until we are filled beyond anything we ever thought we could hold.\n\nI hope the stories here are a reminder to you. A reminder to stop & see the world again for the very first time. When you do & one day not long after, your most important thing ripples through you like an immense wave of light, I hope you’ll see why I say it’s something like magic. Because you’ll see it’s been there all along in the heart of you, waiting for you to remember you’re alive now & everything you are is Love.\n\nBut, like I said, you already know that…”\n\n~Brian Andreas\n\nHappy Monday, everyone!! Munich adventures and pictures to come.\n\n~Haley"
