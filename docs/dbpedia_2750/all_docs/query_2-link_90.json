        "text": "Casa Lleó Morera (House of Lleó Morera) is a modernist building located at Passeig de Gràcia 35 in the Eixample district of Barcelona next to two other famous modernist buildings, Casa Amatller and Casa Batlló, which together are known as the apple of discord (\"manzana de la discordia\" in Spanish). Indeed, they form a block of buildings of exquisite beauty which belong to the modernist era of Catalan master architects such as Josep Puig i Cadafalch and Antoni Gaudí.\n\nCasa Lleó Morera was designed by the modernist architect Lluis Domenech i Montaner in 1902 who created it by transforming an old Racomera house. Many craftsmen participated in the construction of the house by creating stained glass windows as well as pieces of furniture in both the interior and the exterior of the building, which was typical of this period. One of the most important contributors in the building's construction was Eusebi Arnau, the main architect of the sculptures found on the façade. Sadly, some of them are no longer there due to later renovations of the ground floor. However, the sculptures made by Usebi Arnau, which depict the technological advances of the time, such as the telephone, electricity, and the phonograph, can still be found on the second floor.\n\nUnfortunately, the building was touched by the calamities of the Spanish Civil War and was partially destroyed by the fire from the machine weaponry. The part that suffered the most extensive damage was the cornice of the building. The restoration of the building was carried out by the architect Oscar Tusquets in the 80's, and the restoration of the façade was completed in later years.\n\nDue to the fact that Casa Lleó Morera is a private building, it is not open to public visits, however it can be admired from the outside.\n\nSource of description: planerGO"
