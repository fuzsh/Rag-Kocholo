Over the course of the early Cold War, however, the political and technical circumstances of the civil defence organizations changed, rendering old methods from the 1930s obsolete. To keep their relevance, the narratives of the civil defence organizations had to be carefully remodelled in accordance with the current situation, obscuring some facts while stressing others more clearly. By operationalizing the concept of media system, this article examines how the Swedish civil defence organizations used the media, broadly defined, to deal with the two main narratives that their practical work was based upon: urban destruction as war unfolds, and the safety of air-raid shelters. The article shows how these narratives were constructed and connected between various media, but also their changing and dynamic character over time. Over the course of the 1940s and 1950s, the narrative of urban destruction changed from a concrete to an abstract mediation, while the narrative of sheltered salvation took an opposite direction.\n\nIn this essay, I will analyze Sethe's painful experience and how Morrison constructs her identity as a woman.

In particular, this essay will focus on how Sethe is related to memory. I will discuss some of the psychological methods that can be used to heal from past wounds, the importance of memories, and the need to heal wounds to be able to elaborate the memories. Then I will enter the pivotal problem of the haunting she experienced, and finally, the long-desired healing that gives Sethe her long-described freedom.\n\nThe Dream of Equality Throughout history, racism and discrimination have resulted in marginalization.

The belief in the superiority of the dominant race has been taken for granted, and the black people have had and still must fight for their rights to equality. This essay will compare the theme of racism and discrimination using one short story, a poem, and a film in the time zone, 1926-1980. The short story 'My Mother the Crazy African', by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, the film 'I'm Not Your Negro', a documentary directed by Raoul Peck that tells the figure of James Baldwin and the poem 'I, Too' by Langston Hughes. To understand the greatness of these three masterpieces and to enlighten, the significance of racism and discrimination, we will get more into the particularities of the problems of black people living in America. The short story My mother the crazy African is treating social issues and cultural clashes. In her stories, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, born in 1977 in Nigeria, suggests how to raise feminist daughters. The short story was written before she started to publish her novels. Fictional works can provide a platform for the discussion of the cultural conflict and discrimination to which Women of African American Heritage have been subjected over the years.\n\nUsing womanist theory as a theoretical framework, this study has analyzed identity formation and self-empowerment.

Adichie is considered a feminist writer, but her ideals and ideas are very different from Western ideals and aim to survive and challenge patriarchal culture. In her debut novel, Purple Hibiscus, Adichie argues for a change in society's attitude toward the oppression of women and children. Adichie articulates a womanist ideology that relates to universal human suffering. This study considers the postcolonial background of the main characters, who confront the hybridity that occurs with identities that encounter a postcolonial culture. The domination of women is the most basic form of female subjugation in postcolonial Nigerian society. This is largely due to the cultural influences of patriarchal culture inherent in African society, which promotes prejudice against women and accepts violence against women and children as normal. Patriarchal violence is analyzed to explain how surveillance and punishment imprison the characters in the novel and isolate them from others. This analysis aims to show that liberation from oppression is only possible through unity with others, courage, and the achievement of dignity.\n\nKeywords: change, Christianity, dignity, identity, Igbo tradition, interaction, liberal- and radical feminism, mimicry, Nigeria, patriarchal violence, postcolonialism, self-empowerment, womanism\n\nA learning object describes what students need to learn to be competent.

This means that teachers should align their teaching with the needs of the students. The learning object is the area of learning that the teaching situation should develop. Mona Holmqvist, a professor of educational science, points out that there are three forms of learning objects: intentional (planning), enacted (implementation), and experienced (the result) (Holmqvist 2006). An intentional learning object delimits the learning object and ensures that what is to be taught develops in a teaching situation (Holmqvist 2006). A staged learning object is what happens in the classroom and what teachers and researchers must analyze. Different perceptions of the learning object can often develop, even though all students are offered the same staged learning object (Holmqvist 2006). Experiential learning objects are what the students have developed during the lesson, how the learner experiences the learning object offered, and how it can be recognized (Holmqvist 2006). Therefore, this paper proves that teachers must be accurate about their students' needs when planning their lessons\n\nWith the merging of information and communication technology (ICT) and Communicative Competence (CC) theory, the discipline of English Language Teaching (ELT) is undergoing a revolutionary change.

Regarding the flipped classroom model, the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework, interactive whiteboards, AI chatbots, assisted language learning, Kahoot, quizzes, and mobile and computer-assisted language learning (MALL and CALL), this reflective analysis examines the dynamic interplay between CC and ICT. This essay looks at these elements' theory and practice to clarify how they work together to improve language acquisition both within and outside of the classroom.\n\nSozaboy (2024) is a novel by the well-known Nigerian writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, first published in Port Harcourt, Nigeria, by Saros International Publishers in 1985.

In this study, I will use the 2024 Bloomsbury Publishing edition. Saro-Wiwa provides a debate on the complex and often devastating effects of war, shedding light on broader issues such as identity, making the novel a rich and fertile ground for critical analysis. Ken\n\nSaro-Wiwa was a prominent literary figure and a dedicated activist and environmentalist. He exposed the environmental degradation and socio-economic injustices faced by the Ogoni people due to the oil industry in Nigeria’s Niger Delta region. His contributions have sparked extensive discussion and debate, particularly regarding his arrest in 1994 and subsequent execution by the Nigerian military regime in 1995.\n\nBased on the actual historical event of the Nigerian Civil War (1967-1970),\n\nSozaboy is set during the turbulent decade following Nigerian independence. It vividly portrays the political and cultural crises of post-independence Nigeria, exploring the war's profound impact on individuals, communities, and the nation. The story is\n\ntold from the point of view of Mene, the young protagonist, whose perspective guides us through these turbulent times, revealing the painful truths the characters face and the obstacles they must overcome during this historical period. Through Mene’s perspective, Sozaboy conveys profound insights such as the loss of innocence, community expectations, the romanticized nature of wartime, and postcolonial hardships. This novel is a remarkable commentary on the ravages of war and the\n\nunbearable burden on the human soul when all seems lost.\n\nIn essence, the novel serves as a compelling platform to question and criticize the inherent sufferings of war, particularly in the context of the Nigerian Civil War. Consequently, many scholars have written about this novel and its themes. This essay argues that Sozaboy is an appropriate vehicle for exploring themes of war, identity, and language. It seeks to uncover the motivations that drive Mene into battle, examines the influences that shape his decisions, and explores the devastating consequences of his choices.\n\nThis essay is a study of the novel El Señor Presidente, written by Miguel Ángel Asturias andpubliced 1946.

It falls under the subgenre the novel of the dictator. My intentions of this studie iscentered arround the concept of fear, which I metaforically link to the human anatomy. I intend toanalyze how this fictive dictatorial system effects its citizen, how they behave affected by anconstant and sometimes instant fear. And how it is used by ambicious people within the system, fortheir own means, and that in some sense is a living organism, a closed circuit where the true ruler isnot the president, but the fear which is constantly reproduced and put in orbit.Further on my intencion is to analyze how Asturias use literary resources, en particularyintertextuality, onomatopoeia and surrealism to create this atmosphere of horror and fear.Este ensayo es un estudio de la novela El Señor Presidente, escrita por Miguel Ángel Asturias ypublicada en 1946.

The authors have used semiotical tools, such as denotation, connotation, commutation tests and gender theories to understand how femininity and masculinity is produced on the album covers.\n\nIn the theory section, the authors present earlier research in the field, different gender theories and theories of how masculinity and femininity are presented in pictures.\n\nThe result of the study was consistent with previous research and how the different theories describe the production of femininity and masculinity in pictures. The result also showed that on the album covers, there were clear differences in power structures between men and women. Masculinity (men) was portrayed by high power and activity and femininity (women) through sexuallity and passivity. However, it should be mentioned that there was an album cover that did not match any of these.\n\nDigital advancements are creating increasingly strong external triggers on multiple industries for organizations to achieve strategic renewal through digital transformation.

At the heart of this digital transformation lies the capabilities which the organization possesses. The digital dynamic capabilities highlight what capabilities organizations require for said change. This qualitative study examines how digital dynamic capabilities affect digital transformation processes in small and medium sized enterprises (SME) across multiple industries. The thesis accomplishes this by utilizing the digital dynamic capabilities framework and applying it to six different SMEs from different industries. The results show a connection between the digital dynamic capabilities and successful strategic renewal. Furthermore, our findings confirm that digital dynamic capabilities are a process-model, meaning it must be built or used in linear fashion over time for strategic renewal. The thesis also co..."
