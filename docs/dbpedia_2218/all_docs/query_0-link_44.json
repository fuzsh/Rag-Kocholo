        "text": "The Myths & Legends of King Arthur & The Knights of the Round Table by Mike O'Shea on 27th April 2023 [Other reviews]\n\nVery “symphonic” and classical at times and heavier progressive rock in other places. All centered around the Arthurian legends, that I love as well. As always, when Rick is involved, the musicianship is impeccable.\n\nFields of Green '97 by Criag on 18th May 2022 [Other reviews]\n\nI don't know why Rick is so down on this album. In my opinion it is one his best from the many of his 90s releases. Some classic Rick sounds, together with some ballads and a bit of rock. Great to hear the smooth yet strong voice of Chrissie Hammond (ex Cheetah, I discovered! If you're an Aussie, that means something). And I enjoy the added Election Special track (even though it is yet another example of musicians being treated abysmally!).\n\nThe Myths & Legends of King Arthur & The Knights of the Round Table 2016 by Andrew Knightley on 8th June 2021 [Other reviews]\n\nI was lucky enough to be one of the few people at the playback event for this album, it captivated me from the first few bars and still does. The blend of old and new is seamless and is how it should have appeared in the first place. The flexibility of new technology is never wasted on Rick and this album truly reflects this, sit back relax and let it take you on a true Arthurian adventure.\n\nThe Red Planet by Alan Morgan on 20th June 2020 [Other reviews]\n\nWhat can I say about the \"Red Planet\"? What a Beautiful Recording! It has been worth the wait! Congratulations on a great album, Rick! As with the last album done with the English Rock Ensemble, superb sound and excellent musicianship from all participants. No vocals this time, and Rick sure makes up for that with his virtuoso keyboard performances. My favourite track so far (it may change with further listenings) is \"Pavonis Mons\", where the soloing is amazing. It reminds me occasionally of the style used in the opening track of \"White Rock\", where the keyboard solo goes off at a tangent and you wonder where this is going and he finishes the run of notes and you find youself amazed that he could even think of a run of notes like that let alone play it! Then it changes pace (as it should with the Prog genre) and you get a superb finale. Love this sort of thing in Rick's Music! Very impressed with all the other musicians, especially Lee Pomeroy's bass work. I first came across his playing on the Yes ARW live album last year, and like all Southpaw players, he really plays superbly. Just waiting now for the CD release later this month (June 2020), and can't wait to see that special edition packaging!\n\nThe Red Planet by George R on 20th June 2020 [Other reviews]\n\nRed Planet is everything I hoped it would be and more. I think it's the best sounding album from Rick. The production is so rich, warm, and dynamic. The guitar, bass, drum, and keyboard sounds are all killer. Red Planet needs to be actively listened to in its entirety. The arrangements are incredibly complex and full of surprises. The tunes are chock full of catchy riffs, tricky rhythms, and dramatic themes. In Arsia Mons, Cooney plays an excellent Gilmour-esque acoustic guitar solo over an awesome electric piano sound. I love how the beautiful and gentle South Pole precedes the insane closing number. Valles Marineris might be the best piece Rick has ever composed. It is simply breathtaking.\n\nThe Red Planet by Andrew Knightley on 20th June 2020 [Other reviews]\n\nI was instantly transported back to the seventies and again another world upon hearing the first few bars, the use of older analogue and newer digital keyboards increased the tone and depth of sound allowing a greater flexibility within the composition of the tracks, in true Wakeman style this album is a triumph for all involved. Sit back relax and leave this world and go to another awesome musical experience.\n\nLive at Hammersmith by Bruce Treadwell on 19th June 2020 [Other reviews]\n\nWow, it's 2020 and I gain even more respect for this album over the years, it's from a 1985 performance. What a great capture of the voices Rick was using in the early to mid 80s. To me, this is a hidden gem amongst his vast catalogue. If you come across a copy, buy it, you will thank me later. I actually have a mint vinyl copy, which I treasure. My favorite track - The Three Wives, a 16+ minute medly that's so rich!\n\nCirque Surreal by Keith Andrews on 27th April 2020 [Other reviews]\n\nAn album that had generally passed me by, but due to the recent reissue by Demon Music Group on red vinyl (2019) that has been remedied. Reminiscent of many of Rick's rock albums in style, the performance is exemplary throughout. Great keyboard work goes without saying but the performance by the rest of the band is very tight. The tracks reflect the circus theme and whilst the circus is not my favourite medium of entertainment, this excellent album would, no doubt, spark some interest.\n\nJourney to the Centre of the Earth by Matt Parish on 31st October 2019 [Other reviews]\n\nWhen Journey was released I was 16 years old and ripe for any adventure. This album took me directly to the places only imagined in books. The fact that this is a live recording is almost as astonishing as the adventure itself. Rick's craftsmanship of both melody and narration lead you into a world within a world...one you will never forget.\n\nCountry Airs (Original) by Matt Parish on 30th October 2019 [Other reviews]\n\nImagine being on a picnic by a stream near a forest and closing your eyes to hear the wonderous nature around you. This is the soundtrack to such a day. Simply B-ambi-ent...\n\nThe Natural World Trilogy by Alan Morgan on 3rd August 2019 [Other reviews]\n\nI consider the Rick Wakeman Album \"The Natural World Trilogy\" to be a \"Good\" album. By that I mean an album that can be listened to in its entirety, without interruption, and be enjoyed for its own sake. The musicianship is, as one has come to expect from our Mr. Wakeman, of exceptional quality. Rick is a long standing professional, who has been a member of too many top class groups and sessions to be anything else. His 1999 album therefore cannot be anything other than what it turns out to be on playing. A perfectly executed piece of pure class. If you are expecting dramatic drums and soaring guitars, you will be disappointed, but make no mistake here; what you will get is a keyboard player who has realized that these trappings are totally unnecessary to show his own artistry and ability as both a writer and performer. To cut it short, I bought this album on Ebay, thinking it would be a gap-filler. I loved it. Rick is brilliant on this. A definite precursor to his later piano projects of the very recent past, like Piano Portraits and Piano Odyssey, both of which I have and love. That's not to say that this trilogy is a piano project. There is, naturally, some piano on it, but the overall feeling and style is of the kind of album that the majority of \"keyboard\" orientated artists would produce if they could actually play the keyboard instead of programming it. There are no sequencers on this album - every trill and every repeated phrase is played by Rick and he can reproduce it live. That is the beauty of a genuine keyboardist like Rick Wakeman. If you want further proof of his ability, just watch him during his keyboard solo slots on any of the Yes live videos he's participated in. His live renditions of the themes from his own \"Six wives of Henry VIII\" are absolutely stunning! Look at it like this - if Rick Wakeman came to your house and played a track from this album live in front of you, and you did not know who he was (say, He wasn't famous), you'd want him to join your band immediately because he's a keyboard maestro, and it shows. Buy It!\n\nPiano Odyssey by Juan Zaratoga on 24th January 2019 [Other reviews]\n\nRick Wakeman’s performance and arrangement on the opening track “While my guitar gently weeps” is an absolute masterpiece. Must hear those piano harmonics blending with the string orchestra’s harmonies and choral voices. Incredible beauty!\n\nA man who spent his life on getting orchestral feeling out of the synthesizers, mello-/birotrons and other electric keyboards is back on the \"acoustic planet\". With stunning results all over this CD for piano, string orchestra and choir. Plus a flamenco-style acoustic guitar - by courtesy of a friend, the great Brian May - within a terrific rendition of \"Bohemian Rhapsody\", to finish this adventurous \"Odyssey\"!\n\nMr. Wakeman never did music like someone else. And sometimes succeeded to impose his own rules of how music is to be done. His orchestral rock epics in mid-70-ties took the scene by storm and created a new event in the British music history. Since then he tried numerous come-backs including some as a piano-solo performer. Initiated by \"Country Airs\" (1986) and \"The Piano Album\" (1995), those attempts made a spectacular breakthrough in 2017 with \"Piano Portraits\" making charts sustainably and gaining him a \"Silver Album\" in UK sales. More importantly, Mr. Wakeman, now in his late 60-ties, was imposing once again his mark on the music business. And breaking once again the limits of what is conventionally considered as modern, classic or pop!\n\nThe 2018 \"Piano Odyssey\" (released on Sony Classical) is a brave step further in that direction. Essentially, its chamber music. Some of which is very personal and deeply emotional (his new compositions: \"Rocky\"; \"Cyril Wolverine\"). Some others are post-romantic (\"After the Ball\" connected to its source of inspiration, the \"Liebesträume\" by Liszt), or quite baroque in style (\"Jane Seymour\", sounding here more Vivaldi-an than Bach-ish as in its original on Six Wives). The pop-orientated arrangements are less numerous here compared to \"Piano Portraits\". Somehow of a less immediate access than the former, \"Piano Odyssey\" also made UK charts, albeit this time briefly!\n\nMore importantly, this album may well initiate a kind of a new brand in Wakeman's production. As one report summarized (amazon.com): \"if Rick Wakeman means to reinvent himself in the autumn of his career, then he's succeeded in the first step, and may he take more such steps, if that's what he wants. I'm in!\"\n\nWhat's next? A Concerto for Piano with a full Symphony Orchestra? It would be a nice follow-up to the \"The Pearl and Dean Piano Concerto” (1974). Would Sony Classical sign Wakeman for that? They do not know what they miss if they wouldn't...!\n\nThe Myths & Legends of King Arthur & The Knights of the Round Table 2016 by Christopher M. Wallace on 19th April 2018 [Other reviews]\n\nRick Wakeman's crowning achievement (yes; pun intended). I have always loved The Myths and Legends of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table; but, have felt disappointed when I would consider what it could have been. The themes are so strong, musically and lyrically, and, given the vast subject, it could have been something offered on a grand scale... a double album prog epic masterpiece! Plus, with Wakeman's association with Yes, and Roger Dean, where was the cover art it SHOULD have been given? Well, here it is! All of it! It's like Rick Wakeman read my mind! Normally, I would cringe at the idea of rerecording a classic; but, in this case, it wasn't just rerecorded... it was finally completed and fully realized... and what an epic it is! Before we even put the discs on the player, we are captured and drawn in by some of Dean's finest work! Then there is the sound quality: a vast improvement over the original! The performances are just as good or even better than 1975! Every one, including Ashley Holt and Rick, himself, (with his blazing classic analog synth and his Steinway piano) are in top form in this new recording! Hayley Sanderson, who sings the newer compositions, does so just beautifully; and the newer pieces are generally calmer than the original songs, providing a welcomed contrast... and, as you would expect, the newer melodies are gorgeous and the lyrics are every bit as high quality as the older material. By the end, you don't even feel as if you sat for almost 90 minutes! In fact, you will likely just want to listen to it all over again. This album is finally the classic prog epic masterpiece I always knew it could be, and I just want to say God bless Rick Wakeman and Roger Dean for making it so!\n\nThe Family Album by Henry Kujawa on 12th January 2018 [Other reviews]\n\nI bought my first CD player a bit late, in June 1991. The day I got it, I also got my first 3 RW CDs-- ZODIAQUE, A SUITE OF GODS, and THE FAMILY ALBUM. While all 3 were listed as \"New Age\", \", I'm not sure this instrumental piano collection fit that description. This has long been a favorite of mine. \"Black Beauty\" opens the album with quiet magic. \"Adam\" continues with a really beautiful melody. \"Jemma\" paints a musical picture of unpredictable high energy interspersed with catching of breaths. This, along with \"Oliver\" (a more mid-tempo \"dignified\" energy) and \"Wiggles\" (high-speed frantic running in circles) are my 3 favorite tracks. I included them on a custom comp of my favorite RW songs. In addition, the romantic-yet-melancholy \"The Day After The Fair\" inspired me to watch the rather sad TV-movie it was the theme song from.\n\n1984 by Andy Nicholes on 28th December 2017 [Other reviews]\n\nI bought \"1984\" circa 2000 (as a younger fan; I was 18) having discovered Rick via Yes. I took a chance on it not knowing anything other than Jon Anderson contributing 'The Hymn'. Like many other reviewers I have to say I happily disagree with Grumpy Old Rick! It's a fine album - dated for sure and cheesy in spots but that's what makes it fantastic! I told Rick the same when I met him after a show in Long Island, NY in October 2003 when he signed it for me. Upon presenting him with my copy he said \"Well at least you have the Japanese import you can get more for it!\" Haha. It proudly hangs on my wall to this day and I genuinely love the album. Give it another try Rick!\n\nPiano Portraits by Juan Zaratoga on 25th July 2017 [Other reviews]\n\n\"Piano portraits\" is arguably the best piano album Rick Wakeman has produced so far. Inspired performance, brilliant arrangements, a rich piano sound of his favorite Steinway Grand and quality recording.\n\nMost of the 15 titles of this CD have been performed or recorded by Mr. Wakeman before and, for several of them, quite often already. But the performances on this CD are beyond any doubt superior to any of Mr. Wakeman previous piano albums. Most of the arrangements are new, sounds fresh and captivating. Some of the pieces are recorded for the first time (\"I'm not in love\" by E. Stewart, \"Dance of the Damselflies\", a new composition of his own).\n\nThe whole album comes very nicely as a 15-part suite forming a coherent musical unit. Each piece delivers a different mood and color and has, so to say, an individual image (hence, \"Portraits\"). The shift from one to another is clever in tone and character change. Wakeman works like a portraitist painter approaching some well-known faces but still leaving his own mark. The well-known melodies are embellished with a special, immediately recognizable and sometimes very personal style.\n\nThe playing quality is high. The master of the electronic keyboards shows his skills with a subtle acoustic piano sound and well controlled playing technique, flawless almost all throughout this recording. His touché is light and highly ornamented, nearly \"mozartian\" in style. You would not expect here a \"beethovenian\" piano sound, which his colleague late Keith Emerson was famous for.\n\nThe trademark «Wakeman arpeggios» are here, but they are never overwhelming as the melodies really shine out. Counterpoint and clever harmonic changes keep listener keen with unexpected details and turns. The arrangements of the classic works (\"Clair de lune\", \"Swan lake\", \"Berceuse\") do simplify drastically the original scores. But it is done with style and taste and never falls to some impersonal consumer muzak.\n\nHighly recommended not only to Wakeman's fans but to all for whom the good music and talented musicianship are not a matter of classification into \"pop\", \"rock\", \"classical\" or \"modern\".\n\nLive On The Test by Criag on 1st June 2017 [Other reviews]\n\nI liked the rawness of this album. It feels like you're listening to the band in pub. It also made me appreciate No Earthly Connection more, which I now regard as one of Rick's best. (Spot Ashley Holt's lines fluff on The Journey).\n\nThe Myths & Legends of King Arthur & The Knights of the Round Table by Criag on 1st June 2017 [Other reviews]\n\nLike quite many I suspect, my first Rick album was Journey To The Centre of The Earth. This one was next and I regard both as absolute classics - beautifully constructed and performed.\n\nWhite Rock by Criag on 1st June 2017 [Other reviews]\n\nDefinitely worth having in the collection - some truly mesmerizing moments. I saw the film in the theatre when it was released, mainly so I could enjoy the soundtrack, which does go great with the images.\n\nAnderson/Wakeman - The Living Tree by Criag on 1st June 2017 [Other reviews]\n\nThis is a very nice album. Almost sounds like Country Airs would've if Jon had've accompanied Rick on those long walks.\n\nOut There by Criag on 1st June 2017 [Other reviews]\n\nVery rocky bits interspersed with classic Rick keyboards and choir, this is Rick at his best - had me from the start.\n\nJourney to the Centre of the Earth 2012 by Thierry on 14th May 2017 [Other reviews]\n\nMeilleure interprétation et meilleur enregistrement. c'est mon album préféré... Hayley Sanderson a une voix très sensuelle et tous les musiciens sont au top. Amitiés fraternelles!\n\nThe Myths & Legends of King Arthur & The Knights of the Round Table 2016 by George R on 13th November 2016 [Other reviews]\n\nThe new Arthur sounds phenomenal! It was mixed and mastered even more dynamically than Journey. The dynamics might actually frighten people who are used to the current era's heavily squashed rock albums. Rick's keyboards are ear candy. I love the dramatic palm glides on the Hammond organ, the funky Wurlitzer piano riff in Holy Grail, the rich grand piano, and all the killer Mini-Moog sounds. I think the second Mini-Moog solo in Merlin is the best solo Rick has ever recorded. Tony Fernandez and Dave Colquhoun really shine on this record as well. Percival is my favorite new track on Arthur. It's one of the most rocking tunes Rick has written. Percival has great Mini-Moog parts, some killer guitar playing, rhythmic complexity, shifting meters, and the ultimate bombastic ending. This is prog at its best.\n\nJourney to the Centre of the Earth by Allen James on 9th November 2016 [Other reviews]\n\nThis is my second favorite album/cd. I totally enjoyed the performance. I remembered watching this on a television program called \"In Concert\" and this is where I discovered Rick. At the time I did not know he was with Yes but I knew about his first album. After all these years I still enjoy listening to this music. Rick, after what you went through to write, rehearse, perform and record this album; you did an extremely good job. this was an excellent recording, mistakes and all. Thank you for your efforts through all these years. I'm 56 years old and been listening since the age of 14.\n\nThe Myths & Legends of King Arthur & The Knights of the Round Table 2016 by Hans van Hengel on 17th October 2016 [Other reviews]\n\nIt's no use comparing this one with the 1975 edition. The recording is superior, and the additions musically refer to the 2012 \"Journey\" due to Haley Sanderson. There's even a hint of 1984. I loved the original Ashley Holt vocals more than his new renditions. But still his contribution to the album is vital. We all know the story of Rick's heart problems during the writing of the original songs. On this version there's more sparks and the album sounds less dark and moody. The new Arthur is a worthy follow up to the new Journey and the new Wives. Has Wakey's career come full circle with this one or is there more to come???\n\nThe Myths & Legends of King Arthur & The Knights of the Round Table 2016 by Marcelo Senes on 25th July 2016 [Other reviews]\n\nOutstanding! It's a superb record, as the 75's original record, and the arrangements of keyboards are really good (very clear sound), a little bit different from the original, but also very good. The Chamber Choir is great! Although I'd prefer Ashley Holt singing all songs (he is still an incredible singer), the new female singer is great too. Rick is like a fine wine, getting better as the years go by. Thanks Rick for all good music you've given us, it's really a God's gift. Long live to our true born king, Rick Wakeman!\n\nThe Myths & Legends of King Arthur & The Knights of the Round Table by Marcio Aloysio Pinto on 30th June 2016 [Other reviews]\n\nA very sensitive and courageous album with beautifully touching themes like Guinevere and The Last Battle. It will be in our hearts confirming Wakeman as a composer whose works will remain forever respected, beloved and remenbered.Great performance. A gentle trip with the artist into a melancolic dream.\n\nJourney to the Centre of the Earth 2012 by Juan Mares on 17th June 2016 [Other reviews]\n\nWhat could I say? This was one of the first of Rick's albums I heard back in the good old 70s. I always wondered why such powerful and inspired piece was recorded live, and how it would sound like if recorded at a studio? And now here it is, not just the old Journey in its full studio glory but much more, extended wilth those parts that were originally omitted for the vinyl release. An incredible work and incredible piece of music, and my only complain is that we have had to wait so long to be able to listen to this. The original is part of music history, but I have to say that this is much better. Really.\n\nCountry Airs by Kyle on 14th April 2016 [Other reviews]\n\nCountry Airs, Night Airs, Sea Airs, all beautiful acoustic piano. You are transported to the environments they are so named. Elegant, warm, evocative, and energetic could describe the feelings I get when listening to all of them. Listen to at least one of them every week for years!\n\nVideo Vault Volume 5 - Night Music by Hans van Hengel on 9th April 2016 [Other reviews]\n\nRick Wakeman plays Night Music? No witty lines but a musical highlight!! A late night show with Rick more laid back work. The sound quality is excellent and the choice of the songs is superb. An absolute knockout version of Gray's Elegy In a Country Churchyard by Robert Powell. A must have and by far the best volume in the Video Vault series.\n\nVideo Vault Volume 2 - Live at the Maltings 1976 by Hans van Hengel on 9th April 2016 [Other reviews]\n\nThe Old Grey Whistle Test? Although the sound quality is a bit poor it is great fun.The ERE is at full speed and this time around Ashley Holt remembered his lines. This recording is of the No Earthly Connection period. There is no orchestra but the ERE fills in nicely.The recording is not brilliant but the energy of the show shines through.There aren't many live recordings of the No Earthly Connection album so this is a treat for fans like me.\n\nVideo Vault Volume 1 - 1975 Live at the Empire Pool King Arthur on Ice by Hans van Hengel on 9th April 2016 [Other reviews]\n\nIn the wake of the re-recording of King Arthur I took a view at this DVD once more. The DVD gives you a glimpse at the scope of the whole idea of performing on ice. Downsides to the DVD: \"Merlin\" is missing and for some odd reason there is an unwanted doubling of a short piece Galahad. The sound is what you can expect of a 1975 video tape. (B-) It might have been a great show but it was recorded poorly. But for diehard fans like me it's a piece of history.\n\nTreasure Chest Volume 1 - The Real Lisztomania by Hans van Hengel on 10th September 2015 [Other reviews]\n\nThe treasure chest truly became a chest of treasures. The OST released by A&M was good enough (despite the writer's verdict) but this album takes it just that two stops farther. Rick managed to produce a soundtrack mixed with some dialogue that turns the score into a film of its own. You don't need to see the film to get the picture. This version does it for you.\n\nJourney to the Centre of the Earth 2012 by Hans van Hengel on 10th September 2015 [Other reviews]\n\nCAN IT BE DONE? This studio version of the Journey is by far superior to the original. The rediscovered score is recorded superbly. The keyboard parts by Mr Wakeman are as impressive as 40 years ago. And the reinstalled parts that were cut from the old album sound fantastic. Due to the fact that it is a studio recording it fits in well with the \"Return\" album. Of course there are some people sadly missing after 40 odd years but Rick managed to take the Journey into the 21th century.\n\nRhapsodies by Robert Nancarrow on 12th March 2015 [Other reviews]\n\nWhilst this album represents the end of the A&M years, and some people have been rather dismissive, I really like this album. It highlights, even from a relatively young age, Rick's great diversity and his ability to interpret music through a range of styles and genres. I think the fact that he wasn't trying to take himself too seriously was also to his credit. The album gives some sense of what he can deliver through tracks as diverse as Sea Horses, Gladiators and his sublime interpretation of Gershwin’s Summertime. I really enjoyed Credits, the last track, which perfectly captures Rick's essential sense of humour.\n\nThe Six Wives of Henry VIII by Maya Ostrom on 3rd February 2015 [Other reviews]\n\nIf you are a true audiophile (if you are reading this you probably are) with a half decent system, be prepared for an audible assault. Be prepared to hear things you never heard before from The Six Wives of Henry VIII (not the wives themselves of course!) and be prepared to be sonically moved again the way I was when I first played the vinyl release back in the 70's. The Quad mix reveals just how much effort and professionalism went into this album. All versions on this release are outstanding and while the new stereo mix may lack the drama of the quad mix, it is still truly smooth and beautiful and does real justice to the original. I absolutely loved this album when Rick first released it in the 70's. I also love the full fat bluray live Hampton Court release but, this version 'had' to happen and I'm glad I have lived long enough to see and hear it!\n\nRomance of the Victorian Age by Mike Reyome on 7th October 2014 [Other reviews]\n\nThis is lovely, really quite a nice one here. Acoustic piano dominates the tracks and the compositions are melodic and memorable. Highly recommended.\n\n2000AD Into The Future by Dave Cable on 26th September 2014 [Other reviews]\n\nI believe 2000AD was hailed as one the most stylish and dynamic synth albums ever made. Many years and hundreds of albums later I feel that it still is and as a result it is a more than fitting title for such an immense body of work. Rick may well have ditched his cape in the pseudo-digital time tunnel but the wizard was still out there and in control. 2000AD confidently runs through a wide range of musical styles while offering a fair amount of pleasant surprises along the way that only Rick could get away with, because it is done so well and, after all this is his identity which, as an 'artist' is an important aspect of any work. 2000AD is quintessential Wakeman doing what he does best and on his own terms. In a nutshell a fantastic album. Outside, a memorable and true classic in every sense of the word.\n\nNo Earthly Connection by Robert Nancarrow on 24th July 2014 [Other reviews]\n\nWith all the emphasis on Rick's major works in recent times, it would be really good if this album could be revisited in terms of some UK dates. Having regard to the advances that have been made in terms of stage presentation in the intervening years, NEC would lend itself to a spectacular performance. Exploring key spiritual themes with stunning , yet sensitive arrangements, I think this is one of Ricks most under rated albums. Tracks such as The Prisoner have an almost operatic quality, whilst The Spaceman concludes the album in a moving and suitably thought - provoking manner. Go on Rick take it out on the road - you know it makes sense!\n\nCost of Living by Robert Nancarrow on 24th July 2014 [Other reviews]\n\nNot one of Rick's better known albums and yet worth the effort of investigation. This is an album that demonstrates his ability to successfully capture a diverse range of sounds and styles in one session. Where else could you experience the sublime beauty of Thomas Gray's opus next to the hilariously funny Monkey Nuts ! One of the more reflective moments is found with Gone But Not Forgotten, a track inspired by the Falklands conflict. The album marked the end of his short lived association with Charisma records and perhaps has failed to secure the recognition it truly deserves. Try it - if you like Rick you won't regret it!\n\n1984 by Daniel Hull on 6th June 2014 [Other reviews]\n\nI, like many others was shocked to read Rick's verdict on this one and again, I couldn't agree less with his own verdict. This is one of those albums that hooked me instantly, for the summer of 2009 I couldn't stop listening to it. It flows nicely and the lyrics are great with the just the right balance of catchy easy to listen to songs and grander arrangements, I'd rate this above most of Rick's albums. Rick, listen to your fans, take pride in this work, we're telling you it's great.\n\nA Suite of Gods by Norman Hansen on 1st June 2014 [Other reviews]\n\nOf the 52 albums I own from Rick, this I must say is the most beautiful. Not everyone, RW fan or not, can enjoy opera but this has the magic touch by Rick and tenor Ramon Remidios. \"Giants roaming with a single eye\". What a lyric. I think it's a classic. From creation to padamonium to the flood to hero's' it covers all of that era gone by. A must for true fans.\n\nJourney to the Centre of the Earth 2012 by Reg Berry on 10th April 2014 [Other reviews]\n\nGreat to hear the album in its entirety after all these years after being so use to the live album from 1974. Enjoyed it immensely. However, like some reviews I have read not too sure about the female vocalist but I am sure it will grow on people. Looking forward to the Glasgow show in May. I was lucky enough to be at the RFH in 1974!!!\n\nCountry Airs (Original) by Robert Nancarrow on 26th May 2013 [Other reviews]\n\nI was surprised to note Rick's comment that this wasn't an album that he wanted to record. On hearing it, on its release in 1986, I was overwhelmed by its lightness of touch and its ability to evoke vivid images. In some senses, it seemed a particularly mature undertaking and demonstrated Rick's undoubted talent as a musician and composer.\n\nThe subtle tones of\" Ducks and Drakes\" and \" Waterfalls\" evoke memories of childhood. My favourite track is \"Wild Moors\", which whilst quite short, seems to run the full range of emotions and captures the essential sense of Rick's prodigious talent.\n\nTake my advice, if you haven't yet heard this album, try it, you won't be disappointed.\n\nClassical Variations by Robert Nancarrow on 23rd May 2013 [Other reviews]\n\nWhen people are asked which is their favourite Rick Wakeman album, there are some understandably predictable answers such as Six Wives, King Arthur and Journey. However, as good as they all undoubtedly are, the Classical Variations album is certainly a contender for me as the best.\n\nOnce again, Rick displays his undoubted talent as an imaginative arranger of other people's material. The notion of an album of classical material could prove challenging to some ears, and yet the selection draws on a number of well known standards, that those of us of a certain age, are all familiar with.\n\nWhilst showing due deference to the material, Rick interprets each composition in his own distinctive style. My personal favourite is his interpretation of 'Pavane by Faure', which is simply sublime. Other high points include an imaginative interpretation of 'Dvorak's New World Symphony' and 'Berceuse by Faure', which some of you may remember as the theme to Listen with Mother.\n\nA hidden gem definitely worth discovering.\n\nThe Myths & Legends of King Arthur & The Knights of the Round Table by Robert Nancarrow on 28th April 2013 [Other reviews]\n\nThis was the first Rick Wakeman album that I heard, back in 1975. I remember hearing \"Merlin the Magician\" on the Jonnie Walker album chart during half term in October 1975. I was immediately captivated. What I didn't realise at the time, was how many other well know works he had contributed to with artists like David Bowie, Cat Stevens and others.\n\nThe album captivated my imagination. The choral and orchestral arrangements were breath taking, as were the keyboards. Tracks such as \"Arthur\" and\" The last Battle\" were both powerful and emotive and still have the same effect all these year later. A tremendous album - it always gave me a great buzz when the overture from \"Arthur\" was used for the coverage of the general election!\n\nCountry Airs (Original) by Kevin M on 28th April 2013 [Other reviews]\n\nI found the CD used at a music store for $1. This is one of the best 'New Age' style piano CD's I have ever heard. Amazing!\n\n1984 by Juan Mares on 25th April 2013 [Other reviews]\n\nSorry Rick, but I couldn't agree less with your opinion on this album. OK, this one is not The Six Wives, Arthur, Journey or No Earthly, but in my opinion this is really a wonderful album, full of great moments. It came in a difficult moment, sure, but it has a classic feeling on it all and keys work, the singers and music are great. I remember having heard Rhapsodies (which I didn't like at all back then) not long before and I was somehow reluctant to buy 1984 as I thought it would be a similar work, but I am happy I finally decided to get it. I especially like the \"classic\" overall ambience in contrast with the history. Give this one a try, you won’t regret.\n\nTapestries by Robert Nancarrow on 16th April 2013 [Other reviews]\n\nI have been meaning to buy this album for some considerable time and only wish I had done so earlier. Rick often speaks of painting pictures with music and this album is no exception. The tracks cover a range of moods and emotions from the playful \"Fremiet’s Cat\" to the thoughtful \"Summers End\". There is a delightful arrangement of Debussy's \"Clare De Lune\" and \"The Garden Party\" is a lively number which, in places reminds me of \"Shakespeare Run\" from the \"Cost of Living” album. The art work perfectly complements the music, adding to the whole experience. All in all, an excellent album by father and son father and son.\n\nThe Piano Album by Robert Nancarrow on 14th February 2013 [Other reviews]\n\nFor those of us who have been listening to the caped crusader for more years than we care to admit to, this album is a yet another example of his seemingly limitless talent. Many people associated Rick with the grand and the epic that is so well represented throughout his back catalogue. However, on this album, his undoubted skill as a musician and as an imaginative arranger of other people's material is peerless. Having seen him perform in this style on many occasions, he has the talent and the charisma to make an evening’s entertainment seemingly pass in minutes. Highlights include \"A Glimpse of Heaven\" from his time with the Strawbs, “Space Oddity\" and “Life on Mars\" from his association with the great David Bowie and a really moving arrangement of his own “Gone But Not Forgotten\". If you haven't heard this offering yet, take the opportunity to catch up with an intimate evening of Rick Wakeman at his very best.\n\nJourney to the Centre of the Earth by Tim Burnell on 12th February 2013 [Other reviews]\n\nA truly magnificent album. It follows an epic journey undergone by three adventurers to the centre of the earth. An Orchestra accompanies singers and Rick Wakeman's many synthesizers. At points the album is up-beat and groovy whilst at others it is majestic and moving.\n\nRetro 2 by George R on 28th January 2013 [Other reviews]\n\nThe second Retro album has a grittier sound than the first. There is more organ, more guitar, and more bass pedals. Rick warns us to Expect the Unexpected and he delivers. No two pieces on this record have the same structure and Rick has once again put some surprises in his arrangements.\n\nThe highlights for me include the epic and huge organ chords in Standing Room Only, the whimsical vibe of Fairground Shuffle, and the spacey and epic Beyond The Void which has a killer mellotron choir part. Dave Colquhoun really shines on this record with tasty slide guitar playing in Expect The Unexpected and great solos on several tracks.\n\nRetro 2 is one of my top 10 favorite records from Rick.\n\nIn The Nick of Time by George R on 25th January 2013 [Other reviews]\n\nThis record and Live At The BBC are Rick's best live albums in my view. The performances here are top notch and full of energy and there are a lot of great keyboard sounds. Ashley does a great job singing the Out There material, especially considering that Rick composed vocal melodies containing some notes that only dogs can hear. I think I like this version of Out There better than the studio version as it sounds a little beefier and the incredible solos from Ant Glynne and Rick are even more exciting here. Another highlight, which really surprised me, is a version of White Rock that is just as insane as the record. Rick's MiniMoog playing is masterful on this recording. Not just the notes he's playing, but the way he's adjusting the glide control and altering the sound as he's playing. The only criticism I have is that the cymbals and the guitar sound too bright, but this is still a must have record.\n\nJourney to the Centre of the Earth 2012 by George R on 25th January 2013 [Other reviews]\n\nI used to think Return to the Centre of the Earth was Rick's best record, but the new Journey tops it. This is simply the ultimate concept album and the ultimate prog album.\n\nJourney is what I would call ear candy. The production is excellent. The orchestra sounds very rich, and there are some wonderful keyboard sounds. And once again Rick didn't let his album get destroyed by the mastering engineer. Journey is a very healthy and dynamic record.\n\nA special highlight is Dave Colquhoun's guitar playing. The solo in Quaternary Man is incredibly clever and the guitar sound is fantastic.\n\nThe new material does not disrupt the flow of the record, probably because it was supposed to be there originally. The transitions from one track to another are all great and the story feels more complete with the missing pieces put back.\n\nThis album may not have quite the same level of energy as the live performances of Journey in the 1970's, but I think this is overall Rick's best studio record.\n\nThe Myths & Legends of King Arthur & The Knights of the Round Table by Juan Mares on 18th January 2013 [Other reviews]\n\nThis one is my favourite record from Rick. It brings together three of my greatest passions: progressive rock, keyboards and the Arthurian myths. Very few times, if ever, have I found a record that blends so smoothly the sound of a rock band with electronic keyboards, an orchestra and choir. The opener, \"Arthur\" is absolutely breathtaking for the ambient, melodies and orchestration, a real paramount of this kind of music, but there is much more here: the strength of \"The Black Knight\", \"Merlin\" which sounds mysterious and humourous at the same time, or the final track, evocative and melancholic. Maybe this is not the best record to introduce someone to Rick's music (that would be probably \"The Six Wives\"), but for me this one is his most polished gem.\n\nJourney to the Centre of the Earth 2012 by Howard Dick on 1st January 2013 [Other reviews]\n\nJust wanted to share with all. This is truly an outstanding album. With the added music and the nice booklet, what an added bonus. Rick really takes Journey over the \"TOP\". Thank you Rick for continuing to make music for your fans around the world. I have truly been blessed to hear and enjoy such his music. I've passed Rick's music along to my son who is majoring in music in college and what real music is all about. He is a hugh fan. He is also grateful for Rick's music. He really appreciates and understands the classical is the key to success. Thank you Rick and God Bless you and your family and all at RWCC.\n\nAnderson/Wakeman - The Living Tree In Concert Part One by Marco Guarato on 31st December 2012 [Other reviews]\n\nI really think \"23-24-11\" is the best song ever written by Jon & Rick. EVER. And this live rendition is just sublime. This only song earns the album a top score, but listen to \"And You And I\" and \"The Meeting\" as well. Ah, and \"Time And A Word\". Ok, listen to the whole album. You will be grateful.\n\nWakeman with Wakeman by Mike Logan on 1st October 2011 [Other reviews]\n\nDifferent styles, techniques and sounds. A sample Portfolio perhaps. Some serious (Caeseria) and others just fun. It is another showcase for Rick's compositional talents as well as his famous dexterity. A slight over-use of certain \"metallic\" synth patches at times. Played \"Live\" on Tour before CD release.\n\nThe Six Wives of Henry VIII by Luke Dalton on 22nd September 2011 [Other reviews]\n\nI had the good fortune to go to a Rick wakeman concert in Birmingham not so long back and briefly met him and got his autograph. I think it's about time I reviewed this excellent album as I will never forget the first time I heard it on cassette as it is one of the reasons why I play keyboards today. I was amazed at the diversity and complexity of the album and I was also amazed at how Rick uses a huge variety of keyboard instruments to great effect including piano, church organ, hammond organ, harpsichord and a variety of synthesizers. What also impressed me was the fact that the keyboard instruments are played with dazzling and exciting virtuosity but Rick combines this with the ability to write memorable melodies. There are many changes in tempo all the way through the album but the changes never sound jarring or out of place. In fact they sound very natural and add to the excitement of the album. In my opinion this is truly an outstanding album and one that should and will be remembered for a very long time.\n\nRock n Roll Prophet Plus by Ben Jordan on 12th September 2011 [Other reviews]\n\nAlthough guaranteeing the original Rock ‘N’ Roll Prophet a wider audience than it had upon first release, the Plus edition is for me a bit of a mish-mash. One could argue that the title alone is already a strange marriage to the music – the collection of quirky songs and lighthearted keyboard instrumentals is as far removed from rock as it’s possible to be – but that attempt at humour and the original 1979 production values at least gave Rock ‘N’ Roll Prophet a cohesiveness. The addition of four extra tracks on Plus sound exactly like what they are – the Rick of 12 years later and not conceived in the same mindset. And it’s the lighthearted oddity of the album that makes it so enjoyable. This is delivered chiefly through vocal tracks ‘I’m So Straight I’m A Weirdo’ (watch the music video if you can), ‘Maybe ‘80’ (I *love* this song), and ‘Do You Believe In Fairies?’ While Mr. Wakeman would be the first to admit singing isn’t his forte, his untrained efforts are perfectly-suited to the lighthearted madness of the songs – and since Prophet is a one-off, add to the novelty value of the album. The instrumentals don’t quite match the entertainment value of the songs, but there are nonetheless some pleasing efforts on board – ‘Dark’ and ‘Early Warning’ being two key examples. Of the Plus additions, ‘March Of The Child Soldiers’ and ‘Rock ‘N’ Roll Prophet’ are my favourites. That they don’t match the originals is not to say they aren’t any good, only that it would have worked better as the Rock ‘N’ Roll Prophet equivalent of White Rock II, ie – if Rick had gone all the way and produce a second album of new tracks. Indeed, if he ever again feels like going “off the wall” as he describes above, I for one would love to hear it. ‘Maybe ‘(20)18’, anyone?\n\nPiano Vibrations by Ben Jordan on 6th September 2011 [Other reviews]\n\nWhile understandably not officially counted by Rick himself (see above), Piano Vibrations is an interesting time capsule for the fans. It's a snapshot of a jobbing young musician on the cusp of fame - indeed the reason Pye rather misguidedly released it in the first place - and being also a collection of period pop tunes, is not at all painful to listen to. Indeed, the early 70s instruments and production only gives it a more distinct character with the passage of time, as does the lack of a lead vocalist! Standout tracks include 'Yellow Man' and the perennial go-to track, 'Classical Gas'. By no means a classic, devoid of any original compositions, and a desperately foolhardy attempt to cash in on the world's greatest keyboard player - one that is sure to raise a groan or two from Mr. Wakeman whenever it's mentioned in his presence - Piano Vibrations is nonetheless an enjoyable 'historical document' for those of us who've been with him ever since.\n\nPhantom Power by Ben Jordan on 28th March 2011 [Other reviews]\n\nPhantom Power essentially presents the musical highlights to the new score Rick provided Universal in 1989 when they decided to update the 1925 adaptation of Phantom Of The Opera starting Lon Chaney for a modern audience. If the purists weren’t already offended by the colour tinting added to the ensuing drama, the wholly un-traditional score would have had them in fits of apoplexy. Not only do we get Rick’s contemporary keyboard motifs, but actual songs in both the rock genre and more operatic entries in between. These in turn are brought to life by long-time stalwarts of the Wakeman sound Ashley Holt, Chrissie Hammond and opera tenor Ramon Ramedios, with their respective talent really broadening the scope of the production.\n\nHolt, for example, lends his powerful lungs to the production’s excellent opening number, The Visit, as well as wonderful moody pieces like Evil Love. Romance is of course what Phantom is all about and much of its musical commentary is expressed through Hammond’s contrasting tones, from the poppy Fear Of Love to the slow and reflective You Can’t Buy Me Love. There is indeed a lot of love in this soundtrack! Ramon Ramedios unsurprisingly fits into the endeavour extremely well, being the one vocalist Andrew Lloyd Webber might have used in his melodramatic musical, and often appearing to great effect on many a Wakeman album of the period. His incredible range and commanding voice brilliantly illustrate many moods throughout the film, from professions of undying affection in The Love Trilogy to a mob with burning torches pursuing the fleeing Erik through the streets of Paris in the fittingly-titled Rock Pursuit.\n\nAnd of course there’s the keyboardist himself, ably shifting not only through the musical genres but of course interpreting the action on screen. Since there are actual songs in the score, only some of the music is interpretive and entirely in-sync with the action, The Sand Dance being the stand-out example on the album. With Phantom Power being only part of the score, it doesn’t contain much of the incidental music one can hear while watching the real thing. This makes for a much tighter album in its own right and therefore a great listen on its own terms. Credit must also go to D’zal Martin, whose guitar work can also be heard on another of my favourite Wakeman albums, African Bach, and of course Tony Fernandez who needs no introduction.\n\nIndeed to borrow from African Bach for a moment, my two main criticisms of Rick’s Phantom score are that it is sometimes a) “born out of time”, which is to say that over two decades on, thanks to the rapid progress of electronic music, what was once an attempt to be a bang up-to-date contemporary reinterpretation of the film is to modern ears an anachronism; and b) “out of place”, in that much as I love the songs, by their nature, they don’t sync up with the action causing a feeling of disconnect – they are thematic and could appear anywhere. Nonetheless, the first is certainly no-one’s fault and the second entirely a matter of taste. Overall, I enjoy the music immensely and it is now as much a part of Phantom Of The Opera as a certain 1974 concept album is synonymous with a certain Jules Verne novel. Alternative soundtracks are a lot of fun and who else would you want to put a new creative spin on an old classic than Rick Wakeman?\n\nTo get a proper sense of what he achieved back in 1990, I do strongly recommend you track down the Universal film. That, after all, is what it was all about and only then do you really get the context of the project. At the same time however, the album stands as a classic in its own right and certainly simply having a familiarity with the story will bring it all to life.\n\nCrimes of Passion by Phillip Palmer on 26th January 2011 [Other reviews]\n\nAlthough i am a die-hard wakeman fan, this is one of my all time favorite albums. It brings back such great memories of me in my early 20'S. THANKS, Rick. U R the man in the cape!!!!!!\n\nCountry Airs (Original) by Criag on 22nd February 2010 [Other reviews]\n\nAs someone who was in the habit of buying all things \"YES\" when this album came out, the music on it came as a complete surprise. To this day, it is one of my absolute favourite CDs. I was very confused however, when I was upgrading from my original cassette to CD. It seems retailers were also confused, as I was sold the new version in the original cover. I had no idea it had been re-recorded and to my mind the original is far superior.\n\nThe Heritage Suite by Ron Grech on 26th December 2009 [Other reviews]\n\nSurely this is the antidote for those who are wary of wandering through a minefield of Wakeman’s lesser-known works – particularly for listeners who have had issues with certain vocalists or cheesy-sounding keyboards. In this instance, Rick performs alone on piano, all instrumental, all original works. Rest assured, this is not sleepy music. The tempo is varied. The playing at times beautiful and restrained, other times deft and aggressive – providing the full range one expects to hear on a good Rick Wakeman album. This is an album that should be spoken of in the same breath as Six Wives of Henry VIII, Journey To The Centre of the Earth and Criminal Record – ranking among his best.\n\nWakeman & Cousins - Hummingbird by Ron Grech on 28th October 2009 [Other reviews]\n\nWith the exception of the slightly more aggressive opening track, I would describe the music on this album as predominantly understated. That is consistent with the music Dave Cousins and the Strawbs have released in recent years. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It just means those seeking bombast won't find it here. I like the fact Cousins and Wakeman each take turns contributing a track - sometimes a Cousins piece followed by an instrumental - which ensures an element of variety throughout this album. One of the highlights for me is \"Higher Germanie\" which is a traditional tune the Strawbs performed live in their early days but the song never appeared on any of those early albums.\n\nJourney to the Centre of the Earth by Neil Ziguma on 10th June 2009 [Other reviews]\n\nA great piece with lots of great musical ideas. The opening theme is continually developed throughout the piece providing cohesion. The live performance, with its faults adds rather that detracts from the experience providing a sense of drama. The narration and music is drmatic and a pleasure to listen to. The only problem was that it seemed a bit abrupt and didn't quite flow at times. What a shame we don't have the complete piece as mentioned by Rick!\n\nThe Myths & Legends of King Arthur & The Knights of the Round Table by Rich Deem on 2nd March 2009 [Other reviews]\n\nI think it's time for a review. This LP has it all. Rock, Prog, Classical….you name it. But it's more than that. When I first heard it, I was lost in Camelot.\n\nThe Myths & Legends of King Arthur & The Knights of the Round Table by Marty on 21st February 2009 [Other reviews]\n\nI bought this after JOURNEY' and found it VERY difficult to get into at first !!!! But i stuck with it, and it soon floated my boat !!! Iv got it on CD, but still have it on vinyl, the middle of the gatefold sleeve is bril',and the booklet is bril', great music and great escapism !!!\n\nPiano Vibrations by Cristian Muresanu on 16th January 2009 [Other reviews]\n\nA positive beginning for not only piano, but nice rock orchestra, female background choir, soloists in some tracks, style raging from jazz, soul, pop, old rock and others. Calm, warm, but also energizing and each track is very different from the other.\n\nThe Six Wives of Henry VIII by Cristian Muresanu on 16th January 2009 [Other reviews]\n\nHere is really Rick Wakeman born in what it will become the living legend in music. Styles are still mixed, ranging from classical inspirations, female choir and classical piano style interludes which bonds the pop-rock structures together, special recommandations to track Jane Seymour (electronic organ interpretation), and a good inspiration from Bizet’s Carmen opera on Catherine Howard timecode 3'56\" of the piece.\n\nJourney to the Centre of the Earth by Cristian Muresanu on 16th January 2009 [Other reviews]\n\nThe first masterwork, with classical orchestra, rock band, choir, soloists, synths and a storyteller, which really had reach the heart of the listeners all around the earth. Many classical oriented styles are intermixed with different rock colours, amazing female choirs, science fiction atmosphere and sound effects, the ending has a nice inspiration from Peer Gynt, The cave of the king of the mountains. (track 4 second part)\n\n1984 by Hans van Hengel on 11th December 2008 [Other reviews]\n\nFor some reason unknown to me Rick himself is much too negative about this one. OK it's no Six Wives, King Arthur or Journey but it grows on you as you play it more often.\n\nWhite Rock by Steve Phelan on 18th October 2008 [Other reviews]\n\nThe more I listen to this album, the more I realize how far ahead of his time he was back in the 70's. Solid from top to bottom White Rock to Ice Run, this I think, was the most underrated album Rick released on the A & M label. Who would have thought back in 1976 that Rick would grow into being a Grumpy Old Rock Star?\n\nRomance of the Victorian Age by Marcelo on 30th September 2008 [Other reviews]\n\nFor me, a really super collection of piano tracks. Mix between Rick and Adam compositions, the tracks flows really nicely, with Adam Numbers in a more relaxed way, and with OUTSTANDING melodys in Rick´s tracks. One of me and my family discs, to share while we´re together.\n\nLive in Buenos Aires DVD by Tor Espe on 9th September 2008 [Other reviews]\n\nAbsolutely love this DVD. Have had the pleasure of listening to a bootleg from Sao Paolo on the same tour(my all time fav boot!) and this DVD have all the good songs.\n\nOut There by Andriy Yena on 25th August 2008 [Other reviews]\n\nI'd like to say I am just posessed by this \"music of the spheres\". The album sounds absolutely perfectly with the great rhytm section and lovely motifs... Brilliant vocal. I feel the mystery of the universe every time I listen to the album. It is too unusual but I enjoy it restarting again and again. Rick's music call me to the new horizons in my life. Wish his lyrics were printed for being Ukrainian I can not catch words...\n\nThe Myths & Legends of King Arthur & The Knights of the Round Table by Caroline Locke on 20th August 2008 [Other reviews]\n\nFantastic orchestration.The first track is so powerful it bring tears to my eyes everytime I listen to it.I bought it in the early Eighties.I have loved Rick's piano playing since 1976.I sincerely believe that Rick is a musical genius.\n\nRecollections - The Very Best of Rick Wakeman by Simon Slator on 3rd July 2006 [Other reviews]\n\nA great intro to Rick’s most successful, prolific and creative era and an easily accessible recommendation for the Wakeman newbie. Only down side is that should be a 5CD box set containing absolutely everything from ’73-’79. Now that would be SWEET!\n\nJourney to the Centre of the Earth by Daniel Blavos on 28th June 2006 [Other reviews]\n\nWhat can be said that hasn't been said? This is possibly one of the greatest compositions of all time. A dark aura surrounds this recording. Synth-lovers, you're in for a treat. There's something for everybody in this. I am a guitarist and enjoy every movement of this great piece of work. Thank you for your hard work, Rick!\n\nRetro by Christian Loebenstein on 17th June 2006 [Other reviews]\n\nThis is the album I have been waiting for a long time. I can well remember asking for the possibility of an album like this in the website Q&A back in 200? - yeah, long time! I can also imagine very well that it must have taken many hours to make those keyboards work properly (well, more or less), but they sound fantastic! And you can actually hear that those songs have been written especially with those keyboards' sounds in mind - only the production, crystal clear - contrary to the overproduced and heavily compressed \"Out There\" - is far from Retro, but that doesn't bother at all. Going further in detail (spoilers alert) I really liked Rick's musical quotes from his past: the Mellotron line from \"Heart of the Sunrise\" in \"One in the Eye\" (great title!) or the Mini Moog line at the end of the solo of \"Men in Suits\" originally from \"Merlin The Magician\". \"Leave The Blindfold\" is a superb lo-fi synthi-pop song with great vocals from Jemma Wakeman. Generally Rick once and for all proves that he is the Master of the Mellotron!!! But we knew that, didn’t we? Okay, enough said. To cut things short: Go out and buy this album!\n\n1984 by Simon Slator on 16th June 2006 [Other reviews]\n\nDespite Rick's misgivings, 1984 really isn't all that bad. There are moments, especially in the Overture, when the band rocks harder than I've previously heard on a RW album and, on the slower tracks, Rick's capability for sweet and delicate music really shines through. Agreeably, Tim Rice's lyrics (and his quirky vocal on \"The Proles\") are among the album's high points. More importantly though, the bulk of Rick's albums take several spins to grow on me, yet this one I liked right from the off. 1984 isn't a bad place to start for the RW newbie and, thanks to its recent re-issue on CD, it's accessible in more ways than one!\n\nRetro by Chris Jones on 5th June 2006 [Other reviews]\n\nBest described as a high-energy trip down memory lane, reviving pre-digital technology and real drums. Personally I always loved the old synthesizers with strange-sounding names and that makes this album a big event in my book. Good songs and plenty of fantastic solos. Get in there!\n\nReturn To The Centre Of The Earth by Colin Didcott on 28th May 2006 [Other reviews]\n\nNot a remake of the first Journey. It does hold true to the original format but the music itself is a whole new majestic work of art, with a star laden list of artists that develop it marvelously. Patrick Stewart’s narration, which is more involved than on the first Journey, adds to the overall depth and interest. If you like Rick Wakeman’s music, you will enjoy this album immensely. As ever, a musical work of this quality is rarely appreciated without a little effort from the listener too. Thank you for another wonderful album Rick!\n\nRetro by Neil Mason on 23rd May 2006 [Other reviews]\n\nBeen looking forward to this for a while, after Rick played some of this on his successful Planet Rock radio slot on Saturday mornings. I can honestly say this album is one of his most fresh and 'new' sounding in recent years, which is ironic considering the keyboards used on this project. A perfect companion to Out There IMHO. 10/10 Great stuff.\n\nRetro by Aurelio de Moraes on 16th May 2006 [Other reviews]\n\nI had to buy this album at the internet, because it’s impossible to find Rick’s recent works here in Brazil, like the new DVD 'Made in Cuba'. But that’s ok, it’s for a good cause. Very, very good album, which reminds me a lot old Rick’s works. The synths are great, just like the Mellotron and the Hammond Organ. Ashley Holt is better then ever, and the big surprise is the vocals of Rick’s daughter, the beautiful Jemma Wakeman! This album is certainly better then a lot of works that Rick recorded at the eighties. The first track 'Just Another Day' gets things off to a great start. The second, 'Mr.Lonely' has some aggressive , weird and distorted vocals with a great moog solo. This moog me reminds me science, I don’t know why. 'One In The Eye' is an excellent short instrumental work out, with a great bass line. The song is very similar to 'White rock 2' pieces. The synths with Mellotron are very nice. Fernandez is excellent here while Rick has plenty of fun. Classic Wakeman. 'Men In White Suits' starts with a nice slow symphonic introduction. The Mellotron is well used here before Holt takes over with his powerful vocals. Then another instrumental section follows that again is classic trademark Wakeman before Holt returns again. Not too much to dislike here. Good solid prog. 'Leave The Blindfold' it’s very quiet, with not too many solos and is ably sung by Rick's daughter Jemma. 'Waveform' is the second pure instrumental piece on the album. This track reminds me a lot the great album 'Rhapsodies'. 'Retrospective' is another quiet and dramatic song, again with vocals by Jemma. 'Homage To The Doctor' is a tribute to Bob Moog as you might guess. Crazy moog solos, that Keith Emerson probably will love. Rick does some brilliant soloing before Jemma and Ashley finish the track off with great vocals. 'Can You Smell Burning' starts with some Wakeman Hammond work similar to Six Wives, with a tiny Hammond solo. Tony Fernandez provides the oomph factor on the drums. Top notch instrumental. The album is finished off with 'The Stalker'. Holt sounds suitably desperate as he laments not being able to be with his true love. The lyrics are maybe a little on the Andrew Lloyd Webber side of things but it’s okay. For me , this album is a masterpiece. I ´d really like to watch Rick performing this tracks alive, with all the vintage keyboards and Jemma and Ashley singing. Highly recommended CD!\n\nRick Wakeman Live in Concert 2000 DVD by Patrick Summey on 8th May 2006 [Other reviews]\n\nI liked Rick’s performance at this concert, but it seemed to be missing proper accompaniment. The solo piano is fine, but even though Rick may be \"an octopus out of control\", he still needs three or five other fish in the sea to paint a solid mural of music. \"Birdman of Alcatraz\" is beautiful as always, Rick is hilarious as always, those parts are solid. Good DVD for good fans.\n\nRetro by Bazbo on 4th May 2006 [Other reviews]\n\nMan! This one is fantastic! I just ordered this album from my local record shop and since then it's in my CD player all the time. This is Mr. Wakeman at his best, using all the analogue keyboards that were hidden in his vault for more than 25 years. Read the liner notes for more information on that. The very fat sounds of the old synths and keyboards dominate this album! I particularly like the solos in the opening track 'Just Another Day', the riff in 'One In The Eye', the lovely sung (by Mr. Wakeman's daughter Jemma) 'Leave The Blindfold' and the very 70s sounding 'Can You Smell Burning'? The band is doing a great job, the Mellotron's sound fine, and even the compositions are very nice, in my humble opinion. Here we are: one of the highlights in the entire RW discography!!!\n\nRetro by George R on 4th May 2006 [Other reviews]\n\nRetro is a fully produced, fully realized prog-rock masterpiece with a proper band. Ashley, Jemma, and Rick himself take turns on the vocals. Rick plays only analog keyboards and they sound amazing. Retro has a great variety of material. There’s stuff that’s spacey, stuff that’s bubbly and exuberant, stuff that’s dark, stuff that’s very funny, stuff that’s epic, and stuff that rocks your socks off. And of course there are jaw-dropping displays of musicianship throughout. The running order is perfect resulting in a very satisfying listening experience from start to finish. The production is adventurous and Retro is one of the few recent rock albums that was actually mastered properly. It sounds crisp, clear, spatial, and dynamic. Bottom line: I consider Retro one of the greatest prog albums of all time. I hope it sells very well. It deserves to.\n\nRetro by Daniel Hull on 28th April 2006 [Other reviews]\n\nThe whole concept behind 'Retro' is the vintage approach, using only modern recording techniques so that now we can enjoy Rick's most traditional form of music but with the benefit of 21st century recording quality. As for the music itself, it creates a strong enigma right from the off, rather in the same way as 'Out There'(2003) does, with a mysterious keyboard riff. There are many catchy keyboard riffs undertaken on much of the vintage line up, the best of which I noted to be in the tracks, 'Waveform' and 'One in the eye'. These are what it's all about, and confirm that Rick still has it as far as progressive rock is concerned. The youngest sound on the recording is that of Rick's daughter Jemma, who gives some sterling vocal performances alongside Ashley Holt, who consequently is well-known amongst Rick's fans from being in 'Journey to the Centre of the Earth' (1974). In conclusion, if you've enjoyed any of Rick's previous albums you’re sure to find this a great listen. You've done it again Rick!\n\nRetro by Peter Middelberg on 14th April 2006 [Other reviews]\n\nThis is the album we have been waiting for! It is truly a trip back in time. It takes me back to the first albums right through to the latest albums with the keyboards from the golden days and the production and energy of now. Ashley Holt’s voice is in top form, and the (fantastic) voice of Rick’s daughter Jemma is really British and very gentle (on Leave The Blindfold), love it! And even though the album spans nearly 70 minutes, it leaves one wanting more, so putting your CD player on repeat, will give you the thrill of this album again and again. Rick mentions in the sleeve notes that this is a truly one off album, due to the condition of the older keyboards etc., but let’s hope he grabs one of them from time to time on his new albums to come! This albums bursts with an incredible energy, and leaves me wondering what it would sound like if Rick would guest play on an IQ album, because their styles are very similar. The tribute song for Bob Moog is a fitting one, it is not a sentimental slow song, but instead a rocker (Mr. Moog would have been proud). I can go on and on, but experience this CD yourself, you will not be disappointed! PLAY IT LOUD! (but be careful). Rick, you did it again, and please keep doing it! Out of 5 stars I give it 6!\n\nRetro by Angel Muñoz on 13th April 2006 [Other reviews]\n\nEXCELLENT!!! SUPERB, masterly 70s Rick Wakeman returned!!!!!!! mixing the prog style in most of the pieces, and in the other the new Rick, it is superb, and interesting, old instruments but with the new sound quality of 2006, like if you were in the 70s with the 2006 technology, very original!!!!! excellent one to have!!!!\n\nRetro by Gavin Hogg on 11th April 2006 [Other reviews]\n\nRight from the opening bars of Just Another Day you know this album is going to be special, yes its a step backwards to see further forward, excellent lyrics and vocals from Ashley simply add to this superb album, Boy o Boy would I like to see this album performed live but I'm sure due to Technical difficulties (gear all about 35 years old) alas not. No weak tracks here everyone a gem, even the slightly unusual \"Leave the Blindfold\". I’ve been a fan since Six Wives and this album simply reaffirms this. P.S. well done Jemma. Highly Recommended. A Homage indeed to the Dr…\n\nRetro by Paul Adams on 6th April 2006 [Other reviews]\n\nFor those have haven’t heard this album I thoroughly recommend it, especially if you miss those 'heady' 70's LPs. As with most Wakeman releases several plays are required to fully appreciate/take in what's on offer here and what's on offer is the best Wakey CD I've heard in ages; I don’t know if it's just me but I feel that Rick's dexterity gets lost 'in the mix' (or was it the production?) sometimes on the digital keyboard albums, if you know what I mean? On this CD the keyboards really sing - something I've really missed - prominent solos, not solos lost in the mix but ones that soar! Jemma makes an appearance on backing vocals and lead on 'Leave The Blindfold' The best way to describe her voice is as 'pure' very well trained and sweet. The only criticism that I could lay at the door of this CD is the occasional 'duff' lyric but I love this CD so much I can easily forgive its very occasional lyrical misfire...& as usual Ashley does a great job with the vocals, his voice has real character and presence. I nominate 'Can You Smell The Burning' as one of the most powerful tracks since those on the 'Six Wives' album - and that's saying something :-) Mr. Fernandez's live drumming is a treat on this CD - please Rick forget Drum machines in the future, there's no substitute for a real drum kit, it makes all the difference and really compliments the keyboard work.\n\nRetro by Winston Arntz on 5th April 2006 [Other reviews]\n\nWhile moving someone said to Rick Wakeman that he should make an album with those vintage (the youngest being 25 years old!) keyboards alone and immediately a new project was born. It is obvious that the album lives up to the title. While ‘Retro’ was being recorded synthesizer legend Bob Moog died and so Wakeman decided to write a song especially and a thankful tribute it is. 'Retro' literally is an old fashioned but very nice album that and I think there aren’t too many albums that are recorded with fire extinguishers on standby these days... (full review on www.yesfocus.org)\n\nJourney to the Centre of the Earth by David Iain Stalker on 20th January 2006 [Other reviews]\n\nA superb album which inspired me as a young teenager, I listened to is so much I new all the narratives and vocals. So much so, it inspired me and I quoted some of the scripting in my English O Level and passed. Once heard never forgotten, thank you Rick, I hope you are not a crumpled heap of beer stained denim!\n\nThe Six Wives of Henry VIII by Daniel Hull on 13th January 2006 [Other reviews]\n\nThe Six Wives of Henry VIII is undoubtedly a classic and should be listened to by Progressive rock fans the world over. The Drumming in the second track is reason alone to listen to the album, and Rick's unique style of writing and performing sets it apart most prog rock outfits of the time. If you liked any of Rick’s other albums, or indeed, and early albums from Yes, you'll undoubtedly enjoy this one. It's a classic.\n\nThe Natural World Trilogy by Sergey Lenkov on 21st December 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nA great continuation of the \"Aspirant\" saga. New Age or New World electronic meditative music. 3 CDs. Each with one hour programme. All I had written about \"Aspirant Sunset\" I could repeat here. Musical landscapes. You could return to the places created by wizard Rick many times and each time you would find something new. Very mentally healthy, positive and clear music. Our crazy depressive world is in the need of it now. Rick, please, more of that cure... Some melodies sounds more impressive than music of \"Sun Trilogy\". \"The Snow Leopard\" reminds me of music from operas by Rimsky-Korsakov. If you are lover of ambient and new age, this album - is your choice. If you are an old rocker - well, try before sleeping time, may be you would like it, it’s good to try something new sometimes.\n\nRhapsodies by Helge Rumphorst on 14th December 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nThe \"Rhapsodies\" Album is the one with the Swiss \"Matterhorn\" (the one with the triangular shape) in the background of the cover. Inside of the double album there’s another nice panorama picture of the Swiss Alps in a great perspective. This is quite a lot of air... But when we listen to the music, we will find some nice adaptions of classic music as e.g. \"Swan Lager\". Rick interprets this theme real beautiful, in a way the synth neither exaggerates nor sounds stupid. The other, well known theme on side one is Gershwin’s \"Rhapsody in Blue\". Here the lead melody, in the original a wooden clarinet, is synthesised with a Mini Moog, it seems as if the blues continues. This adaptation to me is a good example of what a synth can be used for, Wakeman has put a lot of energy in it; a masterpiece in technique. What else can be heard ? Well of course \"Summertime\" (again Gershwin) is a good opposite to all the cold electronic (and snowy mountains), - it’s getting warmer. This virtuoso Wakeman album has nothing from that massive \"Yes\" Sound, just a pure, electronic product of the category \"rare & vintage\"!\n\nThe Classical Connection Video by Peter H. Kort on 17th October 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nDespite Wakey's verdict \"Please don't buy it\", I like this DVD very much. I think it's too bad though, that I can't escape from the impression that parts have been deleted. As always, Rick's anecdotes are really funny (I especially liked the one about 'After the ball'). David Paton's guitar-work is sublime, specifically on Eleanor Rigby; truly a great instrumentalist! All in all, a very good buy (never mind what the grumpy old man thinks!).\n\nOut There - The Movie DVD by Angel Muñoz on 12th October 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nA very creative and very good album, with very good pieces of music, a new concept to watch and hear. I imagine a new journey to the centre of the earth but with more technology and in the future. If you are very interested in good and strange, but very good things I recommend this to you - particularly I like Cathedral of the Sky.\n\nThe Six Wives of Henry VIII by Eric on 10th October 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nVery interesting first try by Rick. With this album, it's obvious he wasn't quite used to writing songs entirely on his own; sometimes the transitions between different sections are jarring and surprising. The production of the album is a bit flat; it doesn't sparkle like later Wakeman albums. However, Rick really does show off his vast ability on keyboards, and his ability to write memorable material. The number of keyboards on here is VAST and it seems to me that Rick sticks to mostly traditional keyboards, indulging in synths only very little. The songs all have catchy melodies, and some of them are down right beautiful. The style of these songs generally fall in between what I call \"rocking rave ups\" \"beautiful piano ballads\" and \"all out prog epics.\" I leave it to the listener to decide which is which, but this album is actually very diverse. One might imagine that a keyboard led instrumental album could grow a bit mushy in sound; not so here. Rick varies his attack on the keyboard enough so that each song has something new to it. Rick was only getting started; his compositional ability only grew after this. However, the very down to earth nature of the production (the \"concept\" was no doubt tacked on at the last minute) makes this one of his easier albums to get into. Rick isn't trying to tell a story, nor is he making a grand spiritual statement. He's simply writing music he wants to write, and the album is much better for that.\n\nRick Wakeman's Criminal Record by Marianne Donnachie on 10th October 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nHow does one describe such a seminal piece of music history? This album has been my all time favourite for many years and for many reasons. The six pieces of musical composition has everything, from the humour of The Breathalyser to the primeval gut wrenching emotion of Judas Iscariot. I defy anyone with a soul to listen to Judas Iscariot and not be moved. The sheer power of the Church Organ and choral vocals make the hairs stand up on your neck. This piece leads one through the betrayal of Christ and to his ultimate crucifixion, portrayed by the popular hymn 'there is a green hill far away without a city wall'. It ends with the moving music depicting Judas Iscariots suicide and his obvious angst and regret. I simply cannot hear this piece and not be absorbed by it. I can only liken it to Samuel Barber’s Adagio for Strings. It has that sort of power to evoke feelings of longing, of understanding regret. Quite simply moving. Conversely The Breathalyser makes one smile. The car chase reminds me of the old keystone cops music and the choice of Bill Oddie for the vocals is pure genius! The Birdman of Alcatraz is a wonderful piece, Rick accurately has depicted birds in flight so well. Those who know the story will easily recognise the dichotomy of a prisoner and the freedom of birds in flight. Take my advice...listen to Chamber of Horrors in the dark and imagine yourself locked in there after dark, that girl's scream makes me jump every time! Don't analyse this album by genre or even in comparison with Rick's other albums. Just get it! It is simply a work of pure genius. Thanks so much Rick for the many happy hours I’ve had with this masterpiece.\n\nMade in Cuba DVD by Peter Papegaaij on 2nd October 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nThis DVD is a must have for two reasons: We all know how difficult it is to record a live concert. Technically this is one of the best live recordings of Rick and NERE ever made. A lot of camera's in the right places. Editing the pictures logically with the performance of all musicians. Excellent picture quality. And good sound. Not perfect sound, but hey, it is a live concert. Compliments to the makers. But of course more important, this has been a great concert. I envy those who could attend. The band was sharp as a slingblade. Timing was excellent, tempo changes made without any hickups. Everybody playing together as a band, supporting each other. But, most of all, having fun. Rick was playing with a glint in his eyes, clearly enjoying playing with such excellent musicians. And then to think that the rehearsal time for this short tour was very limited. What else to say? This is Rick Wakeman at his best. Sorry I wasn't there, happy that there is such an excellent recording available. If you like Rick playing live, this DVD is a must have.\n\nJourney to the Centre of the Earth by Mick Perron on 2nd October 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nThis is an amazing album. Although some say the vocals were bad, I think they added to the overall appeal and mood of the song. The keyboards Rick played sounded great, and sinister at times. The different parts each lead to their own mood, and set the feeling correctly to their name. And the narration was superb. Highly recommended. (I just bought the 30th anniversary DVD!)\n\nThe Myths & Legends of King Arthur & The Knights of the Round Table by Fernando Lantery on 24th September 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nAbsolutely amazing! Everything I like is in here, classic style music using a lot of harpsichords, medieval choirs, excellent piano works and a lot of amazing classics keyboards sounds, featuring vintage Moogs and Mellotrons very well interpreted. It sound very creative, there is a huge orchestra sounds with exotic instruments (like church bells), that only Rick has the audacity to use.\n\nMade in Cuba DVD by Angel Muñoz on 24th September 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nIt is honestly one to have, it’s a little bit similar to Live in Buenos Aires DVD but with more passion, very good music and surprises, Rick did his best in that album!\n\nJourney to the Centre of the Earth by Phil Bradley on 19th September 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nI first heard this at a friends and spent ages tracking it down. It was, and remains my favourite album of all time, from anyone. The interplay of orchestra, keyboards, vocals all blend together to make an awe inspiring piece. Even the small errors and blips add to an atmosphere of excitement. Having heard it thousands of times I still find new bits here and there - it's an album you can never tire of listening to.\n\nCountry Airs by Jay Haywood on 8th September 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nThis album is made up of beautiful piano pieces. It is great album to listen to as you are lying in bed going to sleep at night. It is relaxing, peaceful and beautiful music.\n\nRick Wakeman's Criminal Record by Steve Russell on 20th August 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nAmongst his best. Classic vintage Rick sound. Beautiful, largely instrumental compositions. On side one Chris Squire plays bass and the combination is fantastic. Recorded while they were recording 'Going for the One'. Very Yes. Wonderful raw analogue synth sound and arrangements. Great piano as well. A must for fans.\n\nNo Earthly Connection by Allen James on 19th August 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nThe reason why I love this album is the music was totally unique and different, as well as the concept of the album. I am glad this album was not your regular Top 40 situation. I had to rethink the way I listen to music because when it comes to music there is no such thing as normal. Thanks Rick for opening my eyes and mind to unlimited possibilities for I play the drums.\n\n1984 by Keith Andrews on 17th August 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nThis album has matured with age. Whilst I wasn't overly keen on some of the songs or singers in 1981, after 20 plus years, they can stand on their own. As such Chaka Khan is excellent, Hymn is pure Jon Anderson. Proles is a fun, if a bit of a throw away song.\n\nAfrican Bach by Alvaro Gallegos on 16th August 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nIn Rick's huge catalogue, there are incredible albums that are sadly not easy to find as his most well-known works. This album is one of them. African Bach is absolutely amazing. A song-cycle in rock style, that ranks among his greatest albums ever (rock or otherwise). The subject concerns the apartheid problem of South Africa (this was recorded in the late '80s) and thus receives a highly emotional charge that impacts the listener. In addition to Rick's band of the time, it includes an authentic South African choir that enhances the \"African\" subject and spirit of this work. Long time collaborator Ashley Holt is superb, just like Tony Fernandez on drums. \"My Homeland\", \"Liberty\" and \"Brainstorm\" are among the highlights. In short: Highly recommended. If you see it, don't hesitate: Buy it!!\n\nWhite Rock by Fernando Lantery on 13th August 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nFor me, this album is great, it’s not in all albums of Wakeman that we find cool music like Montezuma's Revenge, White rock and The Shoot. They are very good, but Montezuma’s is terrific, it should be replayed, because Rick has never played something so simple and nice, White Rock is a big amazingly fast Moog solo, very funny at all, and The Shoot, its a very different music with incredible basses (synth basses) and a strong melody interpreted with a lot of different sounds, I think it should be replayed too! After the Ball is beautiful. Apart from that, I don't know what a piece like Lax'x is doing in this album, it’s very strange. The first eight albums made by Wakeman are incredible (except for Piano Vibrations that was not made by him, only interpreted, but it is good too) and this is one of them, everybody should listen to it!\n\nJourney to the Centre of the Earth - 30th Anniversary Collectors Edition DVD by Fendall Hill on 13th August 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nThis is a thoroughly enjoyable and well produced DVD with, considering the age of the footage, surprisingly good sound quality. Needless to say the musicianship of Rick, the band, vocals, choir and orchestra (except for the atrocious brass section) was brilliant! The renditions of Merlin and Anne Boleyn were a real highlight, and the hymn \"The Day the Lord...\" - Rick's lead-in and performance of that hymn always affects me personally more than any strictly sacred piece I know. The classical guitar is exquisite. I'd heard about the blow-up dinosaurs, but to see them in \"action\" made me laugh uncontrollably loudly. The \"Lost Journey\" documentary was real fun, as was the whole DVD.\n\nThe Classical Connection Video by Angel Muñoz on 5th August 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nWell, to be honest I like that DVD, it’s very calm and relaxing, if you want to be calm in the night and to relax a little bit, buy it, play it and that’s all!\n\nLive in Buenos Aires DVD by Angel Muñoz on 5th August 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nA very good DVD, the new style, a wonderful duet (Adam, Rick), and the favourite and classic songs, I really love it, I recommend to you\n\nRock n Roll Prophet by Colin Irwin on 9th July 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nI got this as a birthday present from my brother he thought he was getting revenge I loved Rick’s early work and I loved this as it was so quirky and I played it lots, often very loud just to annoy him. He's visiting me later I think I'll dig it out\n\nRick Wakeman Live in Concert 2000 by Angel Muñoz on 28th June 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nWell, in my very own opinion I LIKE IT TOO MUCH!, In every pieces you can find the classic Rick Wakeman style!, and then well all the songs I like, especially Birdman of Alcatraz makes me cry, and Merlin the Magician, and I think it’s the best piano/keyboards album that I ever heard. Congratulations Rick Wakeman once again…\n\nRhapsodies by Fernando Lantery on 19th May 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nFor me, this is one of the best of Rick’s albums. The music changes very much all the time to slow from fast, it’s confusing like Rick said, but it has a lot of different electronic sounds, a lot of good solos and the classic Rhapsody in Blue by Gershwin, that Rick made a fantastic version of. This album I recommend for all people that have heard The Six Wives and The Myths and Legends, it’s a very different type of music, but is very good.\n\nRick Wakeman's Criminal Record by Niel D. Rodriguez on 28th April 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nA very, very nice but humorous application of synth sounds turned into music.\n\nOut There by Daniel Hull on 18th April 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nYou would have thought that after 32 years Rick's work would have become rather samey and boring, in fact it's getting better than ever, this is without a doubt his best album to date. I bought this Album in Aberdeen whilst waiting for a train back to London, and what better way to kill 7 hours, but to listen to this album 7 times? I mean the classic combination of Keyboards, Drums, Guitars and Choir that we know so well from many of Rick's albums is back and better than we've ever known before, well done Rick, I take my hat off to you.\n\nPreludes to a Century by Roberto Ugalde on 23rd February 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nA beautiful piano release, full of emotion and passion. Wakeman's trademark melodic sound waves are evident and his expressions of sensitivity denote the maestro's personal views on a new era, a new beginning for the world and mankind. Preludes to a Century is an exquisite trait to the ear, but especially, the soul. This album is of particular personal significance for me because each time I play these songs to my adoring wife it helps me reach her inner musical sensitivities. The music on this album turned her into a serious Wakeman fan.\n\nThe Gospels by Paul on 3rd February 2005 [Other reviews]\n\nI found it, at the time, certainly very refreshing as music goes. It was nice to listen to music (an album) that was far away from the run of the mill (rubbish) that the charts were pushing out. From what I remember listening to, I thought it was well thought out as an album and the design of the cover certainly caught my eye!\n\nPreludes to a Century by Neil Barton on 15th December 2004 [Other reviews]\n\nWell it's all played on a piano - and a great sounding one at that! Some people may feel this is an album to have a \"nap to\" which is understandable and their prerogative - the beautiful melodies certainly do have a hypnotic quality to them at times. However, to just write this work off as another \"chill out CD\" would be to miss the heart of the album. In my opinion I have never heard a CD of songs played on a piano by Rick in which you can tell what is going on in that studio from the tips of his fingers right into his very soul. I have not heard another album of Rick's that is as musically honest and as open as this. I wish I'd found it earlier.\n\nJourney to the Centre of the Earth by Daniel Hull on 8th December 2004 [Other reviews]\n\nThe Journey to the Centre of the Earth is a rather controversial album, on one hand you have the classical style, (the orchestra and choir) but on the other you have a one off album that can't be matched (well possibly by either Jeff Wayne’s 'War of the Worlds' or Genesis 'The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway'). The imagery obtained from the story along with the playing of the orchestra and keyboard allows a mental picture like no other. The keyboard playing gives the music a 'certain haunting quality' which is only present in this and 6 Wives.\n\nThe Myths & Legends of King Arthur & The Knights of the Round Table by Col on 6th December 2004 [Other reviews]\n\nI can never listen to this album without remembering that amazing gig at Wembley on ice. The orchestra all fall over trying to get to their positions, the skaters collided a couple of times ended on their arses. But behind it all the sublime music.\n\nOut There by Alan Morgan on 1st December 2004 [Other reviews]\n\nHaving ordered this from RWCC, and asked for a signature, I expected this to take a while to come back, but it was faster than expected - about three weeks. I couldn't wait to stick it in the CD player, and boy was it worth the wait. The epic opening title track sets the pace for a superb album that Rick should be incredibly proud of. His band are, in a word, great, and the singer has a good range to his voice allowing the music to soar to incredible heights, without him sounding as if he was straining his guts out just to hit the notes (note Hammersmith Live CD, where the singer had to transpose the songs as he sang them). This is a really excellent package, and I can't wait to see them live.\n\nPiano Vibrations by Christian Loebenstein on 26th October 2004 [Other reviews]\n\nSince a CD-Reissue has become available through Voiceprint in the UK using a different artwork though, this album has lost a little of its value being a sought after collectors piece. Nevertheless it is still extremely hard to find. I managed to pick up an original copy for £ 18.50, which is a very reasonable price, on eBay recently. Note that UK Polydor copies have a laminated sleeve! Honestly there is nothing special about this Album, except that Rick's playing the piano, of course. Yet, enough has been said about the music - except maybe for the surprising inclusion of Randy Newman's Yellow Man (I would have expected this from Van Dyke Parks, but not from John Schroeder!) or James Taylor's \"Fire and Rain\" (it's Piano Vibrations, isn't it?!). So - what about Dylan Vibrations? Is Rick on that one too?\n\nNo Earthly Connection by Mattia84 on 3rd October 2004 [Other reviews]\n\nWell, I think this is the most beautiful album in Rick's solo career. The atmosphere is incredible, with superlative vocals and music... Just listen to \"The Prisoner\" to understand what I mean…\n\nJourney to the Centre of the Earth by Patrick Summey on 28th September 2004 [Other reviews]\n\nThis epic is marvellously composed. It actually inspired a dream for me. One word-BIG. If you look at the cover, you can't even see the audience. Ashley Holt is a wonderful vocalist, although Gary Pickford-Hopkins...is...struggling. I'm hopefully going to help arrange an excerpt for my school's marching band...BIIIIIG!\n\nThe Wizard And The Forest Of All Dreams by Tim Boudewijn van der Wart on 27th September 2004 [Other reviews]\n\nWhenever I cannot get to sleep, I play this one, and I will be in dreamland before the second track begins!! This is to my opinion one of the best works Rick has ever done! Musically it is of the same high standard as his 70's output, although the music is completely different, only choir and piano. A must buy for all who enjoy beauty, complexity and relaxation. And indeed because of the sheer quality this one should appeal to a much broader audience than Rick has ever experienced!!\n\nJourney to the Centre of the Earth by Paulo Musa on 21st August 2004 [Other reviews]\n\nI saw the concert in Rio back in ‘76 I already had the album, read Verne’s book. For a 12 year old surfer Wakeman’s long blond hair and his keyboards with the chorus and orchestra seemed to describe a fantastic voyage not to be missed, the perfect translation to professor Lidenbrook´s journey. I still listen to the album with my kids who surf as well.\n\nThe Six Wives of Henry VIII by Jim Beaty on 14th August 2004 [Other reviews]\n\nA \"creative\" work? Yes. A \"virtuosic\" work? Yes. But, is it an \"intelligent\" work? Absolutely. Keep this in mind when sampling or listening to the whole album - contemplate the \"mood\" of each piece in relation to the actual history of Henry VIII and his wives. Each track exemplifies Rick's knowledge and understanding of the history of Henry's relationships. This is a highly \"realized\" album best described as \"history translated into music.\" A welcome musical experience for anyone interested in British history, British royalty or diverse keyboard talent.\n\nWakeman with Wakeman - The Official Bootleg by Carlos R. Rivera on 4th August 2004 [Other reviews]\n\nI had this for years and am still amazed at the work, especially on Journey. The entire work is one of the best live shows ever.\n\n1984 by Cláudio Venditti on 3rd August 2004 [Other reviews]\n\nForget Rick’s opinion! This is a wonderful album. Good orchestration, beautiful melodies, lyrics and vocals. The instrumental tracks are superb. Great songs! I remember how happy I felt when I first heard The Hymn and Julia on the radio because that period of time was very difficult for Walkman’s fans in Brazil, and this album gave us what we all expected. For me it’s the finest work since No Earthly Connection.\n\nThe Masters by Reniet Ramirez on 2nd August 2004 [Other reviews]\n\nI wouldn't like to say this is the best compilation as there are other great ones as \"Voyage\" or \"Recollections\". But is definitely a great one. I'd like to start with \"Light Up The Sky\". This is a great song that you won't be able to get anywhere else as it was originally released as a single. (\"The Bear\" is another song from that single). I would describe it more as a \"modern\" compilation as it doesn't contain songs from the 70s (\"Wives\" & \"Merlin\" are live versions). This compilation covers the period of 1985-1998. This would be like a follow-up to \"Voyage\". It has songs from 12 different albums & the \"Light Up The Sky\" single.\n\nOut There by Aurelio de Moraes on 23rd July 2004 [Other reviews]\n\nGreat album! Reminds-me a lot some hard rock, specially the track \" Universe of sound\",that sounds like Deep Purple or Nightwish. Rick should use a real Hammond Organ in \" to be with you\", but that´s ok. I wish I could listen \"Out there\" on a space station, looking to Earth.\n\nCost of Living by Marcelo Vieira da Silva on 16th July 2004 [Other reviews]\n\nSome of Wakeman´s albums are worth buying just for some of the tracks that are on them. Although some tracks are not really appealing to me, just having the pleasure of listening to \"Gone but not forgotten\" and \"Twijj\" is enough for buying this CD. I believe they are masterpieces and great examples of what Rick Wakeman is capable of (and famous for). True pieces of keyboard poetry!\n\nThe Myths & Legends of King Arthur & The Knights of the Round Table by Carlos Fernandez on 6th July 2004 [Other reviews]\n\nThe best gift in my life. Thank you, Rick.\n\nThe Burning (Film Soundtrack) by Mark Ingle on 19th June 2004 [Other reviews]\n\nThe Burning I picked up in a music shop in Sutton Surrey in the 80's and it instantly was a masterpice as far as I was concerned. Their are two sides, one side with the music from the film - the other side is variations and shows Rick at his best on the improvising. I suppose the thing I love about Rick is his ability to imrpvise and make it better than the original and this is a classic example. Although Rick does not rate this as one of his great works - I beg to differ. If you can get hold of 'The Variations' then do, no true Rick collector should miss this track.\n\nJourney to the Centre of the Earth - Live in Concert DVD by Vinicius Franco on 26th May 2004 [Other reviews]\n\nFabulous atmosphere and great music: an amazing show that translate all of Rick's qualities as musician and composer.\n\n1984 by Alan Morgan on 23rd May 2004 [Other reviews]\n\nThis is one of those albums where there are several guest vocalists, and your appreciation of the songs is largely dependent upon whether or not you like each vocalist. Chaka Khan has never been one of my favourites as I've always found her to be a bit undisciplined, but the others are good. Jon anderson always works well with Rick, as they are after all, both members of Yes, and Steve Harley does a brilliant guest spot, so you are more than compensated for Chaka Khan if you don't like her. The instrumental tracks are again, superb, and the finale is even more so. Even though the concept was all too quickly overtaken by history (it being released in 1981), the musical content carries it way past that, and it stands up as a great recording even now, twenty years after the actual \"1984\".\n\nCost of Living by Alan Morgan on 23rd May 2004 [Other reviews]\n\nThe high speed start of track one on this album is a bit of a surprise, and when it slows down, it is a bit of a releif. Rick himself is the first to admit that the piano used was a turkey, but my father (who is a fan of all things Wakeman orientated) thinks that this simply fits in very nicely with the concept of the title. There are a couple of real gems on this album, including \"Gone but not Forgotten\", which is really beautiful, and the closing track with Robert Powell narrating, but overall the consistency is not as good as with other albums. Buy it anyway, because it's a lot better than some stuff you'll hear elsewhere.\n\nNo Earthly Connection by Chuck Dexter Jr on 27th April 2004 [Other reviews]\n\nI first heard this album in 1982. It has the same effect on me now as it did then. It chills then it heats up. The keyboards are some of Wakemans best. I have started introducing my children to the Wakeman Album collection Mine is not yet complete, but I am working on it. My kids love the music and they have only heard clips from four albums.\n\nOut There - The Movie DVD by Peter Papegaaij on 24th March 2004 [Other reviews]\n\nJust received the DVD in the mail today. It was a long wait, but worth it. This is a very unusual movie. It's one long video-clip for the album. In my opinion the album is already one the best in Rick's line of concept albums (frankly I like Return to the centre of the earth and 1984 the most), and this movie adds something extra. The movie is a kaleidoscope of images that support the music and add atmosphere. In no way the picture is 'louder' than the music. And that is a good thing. The surround sound is great. The extra behind the scenes comes with an interview with Rick and impressions of the live show last year. I would have liked more footage from these concerts, especially the performance of Ashley Holt, who was better than ever (yes, I have seen the show). Well you can't have it all and I have my memories. All together this DVD is a must have. It is a next step in enjoying music. Can't wait what will come next.\n\nThe Six Wives of Henry VIII by "
