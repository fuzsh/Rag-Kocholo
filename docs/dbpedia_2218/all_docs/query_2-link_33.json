Ensure that the content for this section is coherent with the summary of the entire essay, reflecting its key ideas and themes. The history of Nokia starts in 1865 with a single paper mill operation. Later, the company decided to venture into the field of rubber, then on to cables, car tires, consumer electronics, and more recently, the mobile phone market. This company has survived many difficult times over several decades and is now at the forefront of its market, generating sales of over 51 billion dollars (2000) in a single year. This brief history covers the time period from the late 1800s to the present day and details the key events in Nokia's growth as the largest mobile phone manufacturer in the world. Nokia started out as a small wood-pulp mill on the banks of the Tammerkoski rapids in the town of Tammerfors in southwestern Finland. The location was chosen due to its good water flow, suitable water transportation, and nearby wood. In 1868, mining engineer Fredrik Idestam set up his first wood pulp mill on the banks of the Tammerkoski, and by 1871, he was joined by his German friend, Leo Mechelin, to form a shared company from the two mills that Idestam had established in the previous year. Idestam's second mill, located at the Tammerkoski Rapids, was the original beginning of Nokia Corporation. These two friends played a key part in the creation of the community that Nokia was later to become. By 1902, Nokia Company was a major industrial force in Finland - with cable, rubber, and forestry with a sustained level of success. Between the wars, Nokia Corporation was involved in many sectors: ammunition, tires, footwear, and communications cables. It was in 1967 that Kaarlo K. and Bjorn Westerlund started to merge the three Nokia Corporations: Nokia, Finnish Cable, and Finnish Rubber into one, which is now modern Nokia. This was an important step to the future success of Nokia in what is now known as the mobile phone market.\n\n2. Early Years of Nokia\n\nThe early years of Nokia were characterised by development from a small Finnish paper, rubber and cables manufacturer to a multi-million dollar telecommunications corporation. The three key elements from this period that contributed significantly to the later success of Nokia were the decision to specialise in mobile telephony, the acquisition of the personal computer manufacturer Ericsson in 1981, and the move into the telecommunications infrastructure equipment and technology in the communication age. Prior to this period, Nokia had been highly successful in their home country since the commencement of operations in 1865, and appropriately expanded into neighbouring Scandinavia and the USSR. These operations provided a sound platform upon which to move into international business in the latter half of the 20th century. By the early 1970s however, Nokia was facing a highly competitive and increasingly globalised paper and pulp industry and was becoming of less significance to Finland as a whole as it had been in the past. This prompted the decision to move into new industry, particularly the electronics sector. This period of transition was characterised by much experimentation with various products and technologies, none of which were particularly successful until the move into the mobile telephony with the formation of the Nokia Mobile Phones division in the early 1990s.\n\n2.1. Founding of Nokia\n\nThe very early history of Nokia dates back to 1865 with the founding of a forestry industry enterprise in South-Western Finland by mining engineer Fredrik Idestam. In 1871, Idestam built a second mill by the town of Nokia, a name that would be given to the small town that sprang up around the mill on the banks of the Nokianvirta River. Idestam's enterprise. The name Nokia is identified with the paper and pulp industry. The rivers in Southern Finland provided an excellent source of hydropower energy that could be utilized for the large scale manufacturing of pulping and paper products. The prosperity of the Idestam's enterprise allowed him to expand his business into the share company Nokia Ab in 1871, building a second mill on the neighbouring waterfalls which would generate better hydropower energy for the plant. Idestam and the original inhabitants of the town sought to free the town from Sweden and Russia and attempted to have Nokia recognised as a market town. This would in turn bring better business opportunities such as train routes and would make Nokia products more competitive in the Finnish market. In a sense this was the original beginning of the endeavours of Nokia to create better forms of connectivity.\n\n2.2. Nokia's early products\n\nNokia's first century as a company saw it produce a large range of items including boots, cables, televisions, and tires. But it's the early years that are most captivating for mobile enthusiasts, as during the late 60s and early 70s, Nokia had multiple ties to the development of radio telephones. In essence, this was the starting point of Nokia's direct interest in communications technology. Wood pulp and paper product making was the original core competency of Finnish Rubber Works (which would later become Nokia). The department's director decided that tires would be the future of the company and so did not look favorably at entering the mobile radio market. He went as far as to dismiss all of the department's employees in a bid to stave off the department's research into creating mobile radio receivers. The employees would not be deterred and created their own company with close ties to Finnish Rubber Works called \"Nokian elektroniikka tehdas\" - the Nokia Electronics Factory. The company would produce its first radio telephone, the TP2, as well as their first portable phones. All of this was occurring while Finnish Rubber Works was one of three companies involved in the development of ARP (Automatic Radio Phone), which was the world's first international mobile radio telephone service. In 1971, all three companies merged to form Mobira Oy and Nokia's production of mobile radios was moved under the new company a year later.\n\n2.3. Expansion into the telecommunications industry\n\nWhile the telecommunication revolution had been underway for many years, it was the 1960s that saw a rapid change in technology. Nokia started as a wood-pulp mill in the year 1865, but they rapidly diversified into many different products. In 1960, though, one of the major areas of diversification that would eventually lead to the Nokia we know today was in the field of electronics. The department was started with cable work, but by the end of the same decade, Nokia was involved in developing a fully digital switching system named DX200 - a first of its kind in the world. This was a critical time for Nokia, as it set in motion a firm direction towards the telecommunications and technology industry. It should be noted that although this was a huge move for Nokia in terms of future business, the first DX200 actually caused the company to face severe losses due to it being underpriced. This led to a slight stall in the planned direction, but in true Nokia spirit, the decision was made to push forward rather than regress back to a safer business, and Nokia set to start afresh in the new decade.\n\n3. Rise and Dominance of Nokia\n\n3.1. Nokia's breakthrough with the GSM standard When the group of Finnish corporations merged to form a new conglomerate Nokia in 1967, they could not have known that they were creating one of the world's premier mobile telecommunications companies. However, all it would take is expansive research into emerging cell phone technologies and a decisive move from a cable to wireless infrastructure in the 1980s for Nokia to separate itself from the pack. When the second generation of cell phone technology was being developed in the mid-1980s, consumer demand for new and innovative products was high. GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) technology was developed to meet this demand. Seeing the potential in GSM, and having already been involved in mobile phones since 1982, Nokia quickly embraced this new standard. The company helped to commission and push development of the GSM-based mobile technology and at the official launch of the new European GSM service in 1991, Nokia held a demonstration that was widely recognized as a defining moment in the history of mobile telecommunication. By this point, the company was so invested in mobile phones that it went on to become the world's largest vendor of mobile phones in 1998, a position it held for over a decade. 3.2. Expansion into international markets As a result of the success of its GSM products, Nokia enjoyed tremendous increase in sales between 1996 and 1999. During this period, Nokia's sales expanded more than fivefold, jumping from 6.5 billion Euros to 31 billion. Much of this was underpinned by sales to new mobile subscribers in developing countries, which between 1997 and 1999, accounted for a net addition of 200 million new subscribers, 160 million of which were in China and India. Nokia's specific strategy was to build phones tailored to the demands of these countries and then set up the necessary digital infrastructure for said countries. An example of such a strategy would be Nokia's launch of the \"ultra low-cost\" Nokia 1100 designed specifically for India in 2003, the phone would be an astounding success, becoming the world's best selling mobile phone with 250 million units. The mobile phone had essentially become personal for people everywhere and Nokia's success had firmly established it as a global brand. In the year 2000, Nokia mobile phones were available in 150 countries, and with the actual advent of mobile use in various remote locations; it was said that Nokia was connecting people in places where there were no previous communication infrastructures.\n\n3.1. Nokia's breakthrough with the GSM standard\n\nNokia's breakthrough came in 1992 when the company designed the message-handling facility for the GSM, a digital cellular standard. The key to Nokia's competitive advantage in the global market was it understood the essential of global advantage by providing higher value to the customers at a lower cost. At that time, European and US digital cellular system standards were still fragmented and in 1987, European countries agreed to develop a joint cellular system. Knowing this development of GSM and future potential of GSM by more global approach of the system, Nokia put its effort and successfully convinced international coordination in GSM standard and in digital technology. Although GSM was a new unproven technology and was considered a risk by many at that time, Nokia strongly believed that it is the only digital system for the future. The mobile phone industry and especially the Europe mobile operator industry was dominated by national companies and was not regarded as a strategic industry at that time. But with more adaptability by newly emerging mobile operator companies, GSM had a significant impact on the structure of European and global markets. This in turn had a significant influence on Nokia's development and helped Nokia to avoid excessive dependence on the Finnish economy. By far, it made mobile phone manufacturing and the mobile operator industry lead as a strategic industry for the whole communication industry and Nokia was able to capture this future trend of mobile communication, which is prevailing even today. In 1994, the USA decided to adopt GSM as a second phase of the digital cellular technology and in 1996, this was extended to third world countries and today a total of 213 GSM networks in 100 countries serve more than one billion people. So it's a success story of GSM which was the future mobile communication technology and Nokia was a pioneer and has a great impact on its business.\n\n3.2. Expansion into international markets\n\nNokia decided to enter the telecommunications equipment market, and this was demonstrated by the acquisition of Mobira in 1981, which was the mobile arm of Finnish TV maker Salora. This put the company into the booming mobile phones market, and Nokia's fate was sealed in 1982 when its CEO Mauno Paavonen declared \"Mobira Talkman is the car phone\". Then in 1987, the telecom sector in the Nokia Corporation was separated to form Nokia Mobile Phones, and it started on a path that is effectively the story of the mobile phone industry. Nokia's first real momentum swing came in 1987 when the then new CEO Kari Kairamo decided to put the company's efforts behind mobile phones, leading to the launch of Mobira Cityman, which was at the time a huge success. This was the first mobile phone that was truly practical to use, and with its price coming down to the equivalent of EUR 500 when it was discontinued 7 years after its launch, it proved to be a profitable venture. This set Nokia's dominance of the mobile phone in Finland, and it also entered the Scandinavian and Eastern European markets in the late 80s. Seeing the success of Mobira Cityman, Nokia decided to make a more concerted effort at the global market, launching the Nokia 1011 in 1992. With 800,000 units sold, this was a strong indication to the company that the mobile phone would be a major market. Having already moved its focus to mobile phones, the Nokia Corporation then sold its telecom equipment branches to UK companies ITE and STC in 1992 for a total of EUR 355 million. With this, the table was set for the dominance of the mobile phone industry by Nokia.\n\n3.3. Nokia's dominance in the mobile phone industry\n\nInitially, Nokia's dominance in the mobile industry was unchallenged. Their first real competitors were the Palm Pilot and Windows CE devices – these lacked the all-important voice communication and were, therefore, in a separate market. Released in 2001, the Nokia 8250, an update to the 8210, was one of the smallest phones that could be found on the market at that time, being less than 100 cm³ in size and weighing just 97 g. The 8250 proved popular as it was an ideal second phone for going out. This was also the case with the 8310 released a year later, however neither one of these had an external aerial – something which signaled the adoption of an internal one to follow shortly. The 8310 moved the Nokia brand into a new market, the fashion accessory; it came with a choice of different colored fascias. 2002 also saw the introduction of the 5510, a unique phone featuring a full keyboard. It was marketed towards the youth and its main selling point was its downloadable media, such as music, via a computer. This was not a high point in Nokia's lifecycle as the phone was large and clumsy and was generally unsuccessful. Later that year, Nokia released the 7650, its first phone with a built-in camera. But due to very high retailing costs and difficulties in using the rather cumbersome Symbian OS, this model was quickly replaced with the smaller and more efficient 3650 – which became the leading phone for a year in 2003. The 3650 was the best of its generation amongst several models and it was the only phone to fully take advantage of what the Symbian OS offered. A new camera and video recording craze had given Nokia the key to further market dominance during 2003-4.\n\n3.4. Innovations and iconic Nokia models\n\nNokia's success was built on continuous innovation throughout the rather dull period 1987-2006, which saw it morph from an industrial conglomerate to a purely telecommunications company. At this time, the company made three important moves. First, Nokia bought a mobile telephone maker, Mobirania, and combined it with the mobile phone operations of the consumer electronics business group, which resulted in the formation of Nokia Mobile Phones. Second, consummating a decision made on a study trip to China, Nokia decided to focus on global domination of mobile telephone and network equipment sales, and it required that future leaders spend a portion of their early career in a foreign subsidiary. Third, in 1992, Nokia made a pivotal move and decided to abandon its in-house digital mobile standard (which was proving increasingly costly and unproductive), instead opting to focus entirely on GSM, 3G, and their subsequent developments. The benefit of focusing on GSM was twofold. First, due to the prevalence and international acceptance of the standard, it allowed Nokia to move quickly to achieve a global leadership position in the very lucrative mobile phone market when compared to various regional standards, and also stick the majority of these customers to using more-or-less Nokia handsets for the entirety of the life of these connections. Second, it allowed Nokia to be one of the leaders in getting WAP and various other 2G data services off the ground, a shrewd move that would let it keep selling mobile phones when, for a while, it seemed everyone who wanted one already had one, a little longer. WAP, in particular, was a consumer failure but hugely profitable for Nokia due to the near-zero software development cost for the content providers as Nokia adapted an existing platform it had built for TV set-top box web browsing. By 2002, Nokia was the clear market leader in mobile phones.\n\n4. Decline and Transformation of Nokia\n\nIn 2007, Nokia was able to boast a 40% share of the mobile phone market. Six years later, revenue had fallen by 40% and 5 years after that had fallen 81%. In the first quarter of 2013, Nokia sold fewer mobile phones than in any quarter since 2003. The collapse of Nokia is no laughing matter, as the fall from the top of the mobile phone food chain is of biblical proportions. So what exactly happened? At the turn of the century, Nokia had a brilliant strategy. While other mobile phone companies were satisfied with creating mobile phones primarily for the business elite, Nokia made it possible for anyone, even your kids, to own a mobile device. They realized that the mobile phone was destined to become an appendage of everyday life, and they focused on integrating mobile phones into everyday society. To make this a reality, Nokia put a lot of money into research and development, and also a lot of money into marketing. After years of successful mobile phone sales, Nokia made an ill-fated decision in 2011 to form a \"burning platform\" partnership with Microsoft. The deal, in a nutshell, was that Nokia would scrap all its existing mobile phone technologies (including Symbian and Meego) and use Microsoft's not yet released Windows Phone as a replacement. According to Nokia Chairman Risto Siilasmaa, the adoptive reasoning of this deal was primarily due to the lack of confidence in Nokia's own products. Elop's now infamous \"burning platform\" memo really put the icing on the cake by claiming the partnership was akin to being trapped on a burning oil platform with no escape but to jump into the icy unknown waters of the Atlantic.\n\n4.1. Challenges faced by Nokia\n\nNokia’s fall is often put down to the mistake of missing the smartphone trend – this is not entirely true. The seeds of the decline were sown in October 2009 when then-CEO, Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, announced that Nokia would cut 3,000 jobs worldwide. Kallasvuo had taken over from Jorma Ollila in 2006 and was instrumental in the decline of Nokia. Many key executives left during Kallasvuo’s leadership and several others were fired. These executives included Anssi Vanjoki, who was effectively demoted after losing the position of CEO to Stephen Elop – he was appointed as executive vice president for mobile solutions, a clear step down from his previous position and a sign that Elop did not want him as a rival. The job cuts and reshuffling of executives was in preparation for a new strategy to tackle the smartphone market. Kallasvuo attempted to team Nokia’s ailing Symbian OS with MeeGo software, an OS funded by Intel and not fully supported by the Linux Foundation. Although MeeGo showed some promise, it was continually delayed. With heavy competition from Android and iOS, it was decided in February 2011 that Nokia would instead partner with Microsoft, scrapping all MeeGo plans and effectively signing the death certificate for Symbian.\n\n4.2. Transition to Microsoft partnership\n\nAt a February 2011 conference involving representatives from Nokia and Microsoft, Stephen Elop expressed that their companies were \"on a burning stage of platform.\" This led to the two companies forging what was perceived as a strategic partnership to build a new mobile phone ecosystem, with the intention of creating devices using Microsoft's Windows Phone software. Despite Nokia's denial of the company having lost faith in its Symbian platform, the company was quick to reallocate resources from the development of Symbian and MeeGo and into the development of Windows Phone. The transition was announced as a \"gradual transition to Windows Phone as the primary smartphone platform\" in early 2011. Plans to migrate Symbian users to Windows Phone and to maintain some Symbian resources were originally slated to last until 2016. However, it became apparent that Symbian's decline was to be accelerated when, in a leaked memo, Elop stated \"I have increased the communication and prioritization of key themes...shifting into more speed. And have redoubled efforts on Symbian.\" From April 30, 2011, further resources were reallocated from Symbian and MeeGo, with the intention that Symbian would become \"a franchise platform.\" As Elop's \"burning platform\" memo focused on the precariousness of Nokia's then-current position, the situation did not improve, and various rounds of layoffs followed. It was announced that there would be 7,000 job cuts and the closure of the last Finnish factory in 2012. In June 2012, Nokia unveiled the now-defunct strategy that would be termed \"Nokia 2.0,\" consisting of simpler feature phones in developing markets. This strategy was confused, and Nokia had struggled to maintain market share in these markets with both smartphones and lower-end mobile phones. By June 2012, it was apparent that \"Nokia's transition to Windows Phone has not been as successful as expected,\" and the closure of this strategy was quickly followed by the closure of the Qt platform. This left Windows Phone as the sole smartphone platform for Nokia.\n\n4.3. Nokia's acquisition by Microsoft and subsequent changes\n\nIn September 2013, Microsoft announced an agreement to purchase Nokia's mobile device business as well as license Nokia's patents and mapping services. It hoped to turn around Windows Phone's fortunes through the acquisition. When the deal was completed in April 2014, Microsoft kept the Nokia branding for a few low-end devices, but it was later discontinued. There was a plan to keep the Nokia brand for future Lumia devices. Then CEO of Microsoft, Satya Nadella, felt that the company needed to be more focused with its branding. In October 2014, Microsoft announced that future Lumia devices would be branded with the Microsoft name and logo. This was still too little success, which led to Microsoft selling the Nokia name and the assets to a subsidiary of a Taiwanese multinational, Foxconn, who currently license the brand for mobile devices. Since the Microsoft acquisition, Nokia had focused on network equipment through Nokia Networks. Combining the wireless infrastructure assets of Nokia Solutions and Networks and Alcatel-Lucent, in 2016 Nokia announced that it would work with Japanese electronics company, Sumitomo Electric, on a project to increase capacity on the companies' subsea fiber optic cable. The project is hoping to allow for trans-pacific and trans-atlantic networks to double in capacity with a total of 124Tbit/s. This project has a completion date for 2018.\n\n4.4. Nokia's return to the mobile market\n\nOn May 18, 2016, HMD Global, a group led by previous Nokia employees and the Chinese company Foxconn, acquired Microsoft Mobile, the rights to use the Nokia name on feature phones until 2024 and to use the Nokia brand on smartphones, for example, in the Nokia Technologies segment, according to a new licensing agreement. The purchase of \"Microsoft Feature Phone assets\" also prompted the return of a \"business partnership\" between Nokia and Microsoft. This deal resulted in HMD Global now being the licensee of a mobile phone unit under the Nokia brand. Later, HMD Global CEO Arto Nummela explained that the brand was \"not simply for nostalgia purposes\", but also to put relevance to consumers: \"Everybody loved Nokia phones,\" he stated. \"It's a brand with an incredible amount of emotion\" in a 2017 interview with CNET. He believes that through this licensing agreement, Nokia will unify under a single brand again. In Berlin on August 16, 2016, HMD announced the first Android-powered Nokia smartphone, called the Nokia 8. The move changed Nokia from a company that relied on Microsoft's Windows Phone platform to one that utilizes a competing smartphone OS to Windows Phone. Currently, Nokia smartphones are being developed by HMD Global, a company also developing feature phones under the Nokia brand. With HMD Global now licensing the Nokia brand, this also means that future Nokia smartphones will once again be interfacing with networks formerly supported by Nokia Oyj's Siemens Networks division. This also marks the first time that a company other than Nokia, or its offspring Nokia Solutions and Networks, has been a licensee for mobile communication as of the mid-2010s."
