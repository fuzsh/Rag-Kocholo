        "text": "This document is part of a series of working papers on health-related measures in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest-Old (AHEAD) study. The series currently contains papers on cognitive function, affective function, and physical function, the latter of which is the focus of this document. The purpose of this document is to aid prospective analysts in the appropriate use of the physical functioning data. To do so, this document provides an inventory of the physical functioning measures included in the survey interviews, describes the formats and origins of these measures, discusses their reliability, validity, and change over time and several options for working with the evolution of the questions, and provides SAS code for recoding the variables and creating simple summary measures."
