        "text": "Hi families!\n\nI am thrilled to begin my 7th year at BCE and in 2nd grade (on the English side of SI). It has been an honor teaching at Barton Creek. I am excited for a great year as we build a \"family\" in our classroom!\n\nI am originally from a little town in New Hampshire and it still is so special to me. I grew up with my huge immediate family and next to my cousins. I lived within 20 minutes from most of my family my entire childhood. I moved during college, along with my immediate family, to complete college in Tampa, FL at USF. I graduated college from USF with a BS in Elementary Ed.\n\nTeaching is my passion and I find so much joy in my job. This will be my 17th year as a teacher (I can't believe it!!). I spent most of my teaching career in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida teaching 1st grade & 2nd grade in the Gifted & Talented program. Then I came to BCE and taught in 1st, 2nd, and Kinder for the past two years.\n\nI aspire every year on building a community within my classroom and making students lifelong learners! This is going to be the BEST YEAR YET!!! :)\n\nHere is our class wish list!\n\nKindly,\n\nSara Cahill"
