        "text": "A strong inside midfielder, Brownlow Medallist Ollie Wines possesses elite on-ball skills and exceptional endurance that is rarely matched. Wines’ physical pressure and high tackle rate make him a defensive beast, but it’s his vision and football IQ that makes his presence so damaging.\n\nWines is one of Port Adelaide’s most experienced operators and leads from the front in his performance, attitude and respect for his teammates. Operating in tandem with the side's young core - Zak Butters, Connor Rozee, Willem Drew and Jason Horne-Francis, the 29-year-old plays an important role in Port Adelaide's midfield.\n\nAFL Honours\n\n- Brownlow Medal (2021)\n\n- All-Australian (2021)\n\n- Peter Badcoe Medallist (2021)\n\n- AFLPA 22under22 (2015, 2016, 2017)\n\n- Rising Star nominee (Round 1, 2013)\n\nClub Honours"
