        "text": "It’s been a while since the January document came out but with the conclusion of the 2024 season upon us, it’s about time Boro were looking to next year. It’s been a really positive season on and off the pitch. We’ve seen the club achieve its second highest finish ever in the EFL, challenging for the playoffs right till the last games of the season. This is something we never thought would be possible at the start of the season and whilst it’s disappointing we weren’t able to complete the job and claim 6th place, there are so many positives to take from this season.\n\nWe have seen individuals blossom in a higher division, some playing here for the first time in their careers. Piergianni and Reid in particular but all the lads who have stuck with us from last season’s successes in League 2 have really stepped up. There’s been some tidy additions as well, in particular Dan Butler, Nick Freeman and Louis Thompson who have all played a huge role week in, week out for the side. The additions of Finley Burns, Ben Thompson and Alex MacDonald have also hugely impacted the squad over the course of the season.\n\nOff the pitch the club continues to grow. Attendances are increasing and the town are significantly more involved in the football club. Plenty of young supporters are more and more proud to say Stevenage FC is their football club, and the fan experience is certainly on the up. Investments are being made which is a really positive sign as the club seek to grow into a stable League 1 outfit for years to come.\n\nHowever, off the pitch we have one notable change. Steve Evans is gone, Alex Revell takes the step up, and this changes everything. There will be certain players under the new management who don’t quite fit the direction as we perceive them to, and also players who will flourish under this adapted style. I also imagine there’ll be some players Steve will try and take to Rotherham with him.\n\nWith that in mind, let’s assess the current state of the squad and who we might expect to stay and go.\n\nSquad preview\n\nGoalkeepers\n\nIn goal I think it’s safe to assume Taye Ashby-Hammond will stay. Yes, he’s had some shaky moments particularly with distribution at the back end of the season, but the pros certainly outweigh the cons with Taye. His shot stopping ability is up there with the best in the division, and he is as assured as anyone in the league collecting crosses into the box. He’s had a solid first season at this level.\n\nOur other goalkeeper was Craig MacGillivray who finds himself in an interesting situation this Summer. CMG was on loan from MK Dons who appear unlikely to use him going forward, as there are limitations to Craig’s abilities passing out from the back that do not suit new boss Mike Williamson’s style of play. Stevenage however do not play this style and CMG is far more suited to the way Boro play. In the games he has played he’s been fine, and if you gave me the option of taking him as what would most likely be a number 2, I’d take it in a heartbeat. I think for the good of Craig’s career, he will want guaranteed first team football though, and I don’t blame him for that. If he were to move from MK, I’d expect it to be to a top half L2 side or even another team in L1.\n\nDefenders\n\nOn the right side of the defence Luther James-Wildin stays. He’s one of Stevenage’s most consistent players and has come on leaps and bounds in recent years. He has also shown this year his versatility by occasionally dropping into centre back.\n\nKane Smith is also under contract next season and has done enough to prove himself in League 1. Kane has proven to be a dependable asset to Stevenage this season and may see himself given more minutes if he can stay injury-free and if Revell’s tactically flexible between a 3 and 4 back, which I believe he will be.\n\nIn the middle I don’t need to go into the situations for TVC or Dan Sweeney in much detail. They are under contract already for next season, and unless an offer is made that exceeds our valuation of these players there is no danger of either of these 2 leaving. I’m a little surprised Nathan Thompson has been kept on, considering he is a high earner at the club and did not feature much in the second half of the season. However, his experience is invaluable at this level, and ability-wise he is still of League 1 level. I’m hopeful we see more of NT next season, and hopefully with the consistency he offered at the start of the season.\n\nYou have to feel as though Piergianni to Rotherham is a match made in heaven though. As good as Pidge is, I’ve always maintained he fits a specific style so well and that is the Steve Evans style to a T. This is why if an offer comes in, don’t panic if he goes. I imagine Evans has Piergianni at the top of his transfer list and with the spending means Rotherham have, I feel he could go. The decision probably rests on Pidge, we know he is happy here. We’d love to see Pidge stay, he’s a top leader and more importantly a stalwart at the back. Whilst we have to be realistic, he’s the first player Evans will want to bring with him, Rotherham’s signing of Sean Raggett in the week should ease these worries.\n\nAt left back we retain Dan Butler. Despite receiving a lot of unwarranted criticism this season I will maintain Butler is one of our most dependable players. He works so hard and is an experienced campaigner at this level. Stevenage’s 2 darkest days of the season this year both came about when Butler was unavailable, I think that speaks volumes.\n\nThere will be a need for another left back in the Summer though, desperately. The signing of Nesta Guinness-Walker has taken a different direction than we assumed with him being used in a much more advanced role. I’m on the fence with offering Nesta a deal. Whilst he does offer us something completely different, I still don’t know if we know how to utilise him best. He isn’t afraid to take players on and use the full extremities of the pitch, something Boro have really lacked in recent weeks. However, this would suggest left wing as his best position, and I feel there could be better options out there who are out-and-out left wingers. Again, this depends on the system Revs wants to input, and where he could see Nesta fitting into that system.\n\nMidfielders\n\nThis is where I thought the toughest decisions would be made, but we’ve kept pretty much all of them! Nick Freeman and Louis Thompson were two of Boro’s best signings last season, and the pair of them showed plenty of quality and looked comfortable at League 1 level. We also have JFC and Jordan Roberts contracted until next Summer so they will also be staying. However, JFC is undergoing an ACL reconstruction, and will hardly play at all next season as a result, I wish him the best going forward as we want to see him back out on the pitch!\n\nHarvey White is an interesting one. I actually think a full pre-season for White could possibly be the making of him. Experiencing starting off the season on the same playing field as our squad, as opposed to coming in on deadline day, I feel could really help Harvey. If he’s not quite up to speed after pre-season you’d imagine he will be loaned out, but there’s too much talent for us to be trying to actively offload Harvey in the Summer.\n\nAlex MacDonald is a top professional, we all know that, and a great character to have in the dressing room, a bit like Jake Taylor in 2022/23. He is also a very dependable player, you know exactly what you’re getting from him, and recently he’s been one of Boro’s better players. Despite being the oldest member of the squad, Macca has shown there is still some life in him, and probably enough for another season. I’d keep him as an option, especially off the bench, but wouldn’t anticipate him starting too many games next season. Let’s see if he accepts the contract offer.\n\nBen Thompson I’m hopeful we’ll see the best of next season. If we got the BT that we saw in the unbeaten run around November time he could develop into our best midfielder this season, he was that good during that run of form. I’m not 100% sure what happened between December and March as to why he wasn’t playing and I don’t think we’ll know for a while, but as a result we haven’t quite seen the same player since he’s been bought back into the fold. I’m sure Revs will have had the appropriate conversations with BT and that there is a plan in place to fulfil his potential, as he could be a key player for Boro next season.\n\nI do not anticipate Finley Burns returning to the club. He was superb up until Christmas, whether it be in the central defence or defensive midfield role. Ever since he’s struggled to find consistency, with a few promising performances keeping him in and around the squad. I’m not convinced he’s a midfielder. I think back to some of his best games at the start of the season in defence and thinking Sweeney would struggle to get his place back in the team, he was that good. I’ve just not seen that level of consistency in midfield. I’m not sure if the shift to the Stevenage style as opposed to how he has been coached at Man City in the end took him too far out of his comfort zone. Again, good enough for the level, and similarly to NGW I’m not sure we’ve used him entirely correctly over the past few months. I actually see him going to the Championship next season, which in turn I believe will suit him more as a player, in a less direct system.\n\nA player we have to say goodbye to is Harry Anderson. He has pretty much been the forgotten man at Boro this season, after there was so much optimism around the signing of him. Sure, he’s had injuries, but similarly we had to consider where is Harry happiest playing his football, and could we offer him guaranteed first team football next term. I can see Harry staying at Colchester on a permanent basis next season, where his loan move has been encouraging. No doubt a good footballer and I wish Harry all the best for the future.\n\nForwards\n\nWhere do I start? Jamie Reid? He’s contracted for another year, so we know he’s staying, for now. A season probably beyond anyone’s wildest dreams where Reidy has been crucial to our success. It’s been no coincidence that when he’s been scoring, we’ve been winning and when he hasn’t been finding the net no one else has been able to back him up sufficiently. There will be suitors for him in the Summer, and it’s not out of the question that if the right offer comes in that Reidy could go. Leon is a great negotiator though and we will not let Reidy go for anything less than what he’s worth. Someone else who could be a goalscorer would take some of the weight off his shoulders though. Rotherham signing Jonson Clarke-Harris eases the tension surrounding this for Boro fans massively.\n\nVadaine Oliver just hasn’t worked out as we’d hoped. When I did my analysis on him as he joined I was hopeful that Evans might be able to extract more than we’ve seen. I actually think he’s served his purpose to an extent. He’s been good in the air and shown intent to attack incoming crosses which has become a huge part of Boro’s style as the season has progressed. His metrics aerially are really good, on the ball however not so much. Unfortunately, if we’ve tried to play the ball into feet Oliver has struggled to offer much in build-up. I do wonder if he’d been able to get a goal earlier on in his loan spell if things could have been different. You can see where he could have been effective, plenty of desire which I cannot fault him for.\n\nAaron Pressley is under contract until the end of next season. However, if the right offer comes in for Pressley I wouldn’t be surprised to see it accepted. Again, a pre-season could help the Press, and if it doesn’t have its desired effects you’d imagine he’ll be given a loan move at the very minimum. Expect to see plenty of him in July though, we definitely see something in him.\n\nThe striker market this Summer is not particularly flexible which could be why the club have decided to extend the deal of Elliot List. We’ve seen glimpses of the Listy we know and love this season, I think back to Derby and Northampton at home and Cheltenham away where he was superb. However, the consistency just hasn’t quite been there from List and whilst he can still be useful, I’m just not sure if I can see us staying patient to see if he can rediscover his pre-injury form. I do see List having a full pre-season as a massive bonus though, as he did not have that last season. Let’s hope this brings back the same List who thrived in Revell’s previous spell in charge.\n\nWe have also announced the signing of Louis Appere from Northampton which I feel is a great piece of business to kick the window off, I’ll touch more on that later. Kane Hemmings has also confirmed his departure from the club. A player who always gave 100%, Appere almost feels like the replacement for Kane. Thank you for your service Kane!\n\nWho needs to come in?\n\nIf we assume the squad to look like this post-retained list, it makes the planning a bit easier as the gaps become more evident. I’ve also included a couple of the youngsters I think we will see over pre-season, who could become a part of the first team.\n\nAshby-Hammond\n\nMitchell\n\nJames-Wildin\n\nK. Smith\n\nVancooten\n\nSweeney\n\nPiergianni\n\nN. Thompson\n\nButler\n\nFreeman\n\nL. Thompson\n\n*Forster-Caskey*\n\nWhite\n\n(MacDonald)\n\nB. Thompson\n\nRoberts\n\nReid\n\nList\n\nAppere\n\nH. Smith\n\nEvans\n\nPressley\n\nObviously that is a reasonably sized squad. When you consider some of those players will have offers from elsewhere or may be sent out on loan, the composition of it changes ever so slightly. Therefore, I anticipate it being a fairly busy Summer (as is often the norm at Stevenage) and I actually think over the course of the window we will make a minimum of 7 signings. There is potential for more though, depending on what outgoings there are over the Summer, which is where we have to be proactive. I believe the squad will be built with a number of tactical setups in mind, but from what we have heard and seen I imagine the two prominent setups will be a 4–3–3, with room for inversion from the two wider players of the front 3, and a 3–4–2–1.\n\nTarget 1: Goalkeeper\n\nAssuming that Craig MacGillivray does not extend his stay at the club and seeks first team opportunities elsewhere, Stevenage will most likely look to secure a second goalkeeper for the 2024/25 season. They have options in depth for sure with promising youngsters Rylee Mitchell and Max Woodford who have shown to be capable in their brief cameos in senior football so far, but you’d imagine the club want to bring in a more senior alternative to Ashby-Hammond.\n\nIn this player Boro are looking for someone who is comfortable collecting crosses into the area, competent with the ball at feet and commands his penalty area confidently. With that in mind, Boro are also needing a keeper who is prepared to have a real fight on his hands if he wants to get the number 1 shirt off Taye Ashby-Hammond, who has had a good season. Someone content with being a number 2 at least for the time being would be preferable.\n\nCallum Burton\n\nWas the number 3 goalkeeper at Plymouth. However he did serve a good purpose to them as their number 1 keeper Michael Cooper has picked up a host of injuries over the past few seasons.\n\nBurton has now left Plymouth. Burton has proven at Cambridge in his career that he is more than capable when called upon. It’s just whether he’s prepared for another move where he would have to stick around for first team opportunities.\n\nKillian Cahill\n\nI’m a big fan of Cahill. He is out of contract at Brighton this Summer but I’d imagine that is renewed. From what I’ve seen of Cahill he is comfortable on the ball, and a great shot stopper. Still a young goalkeeper there will be aspects of the game he can learn under Ashby-Hammond, but with the Irishman yet to taste senior football at 20, surely this is the season he makes that step.\n\nIf his deal isn’t renewed this could be a great deal on a permanent basis, a loan could also be a good short-term solution to the vacant keeper position at the Lamex.\n\nAston Oxborough\n\nA bit of a wildcard. Oxborough has served as the backup keeper at Motherwell this season and hasn’t had a look in there. He also has previous senior experience at Barnet.\n\nMy main reservation with Oxborough is the lack of games he has played in the past 2 years, but the quota of a backup is fit perfectly as it’s exactly what he has served this year. A player I feel who would be happier to come in and do that role, but may not be as dependable as other options should an injury occur to Taye.\n\nArchie Mair\n\nMair has a fair bit of senior experience at Notts County, Gateshead, Kings Lynn and Morecambe. He has signed a new deal at Norwich, and at 23 looks unlikely to break into their senior ranks anytime soon. Mair has shown plenty of character through his career, famously making a series of penalty saves to send Notts County into the football league.\n\nCould be a very dependable backup, this one is probably dependent on what Mair and Norwich want at this stage of his career. I think it would be some battle for him to take the number 1 shirt off Taye.\n\nGeorge Wickens\n\nWickens is a player I’ve tracked for a while and have always felt would fit in at the Lamex as an up and coming number 1 candidate. He’s recently had a loan spell at Ross County but also has had senior experience at Wealdstone. A product of the Fulham academy as well, just like Ashby-Hammond.\n\nIt feels to me like he probably won’t be kept on at Fulham. This is someone who could develop into a really good keeper, and who I feel could have a great working relationship with Taye given the Fulham links. Makes a lot of sense to me.\n\nTarget 2: Central defender (should Piergianni leave)\n\nIn the eventuality that Piergianni departs to Rotherham Boro have to be proactive and see the route they go down to replace him. This route depends solely on how continuing we are with the style of play we saw under Steve Evans.\n\nI think the criteria for this position would be simple. Strong in the air, and physical to the extent that they can bully strikers. The Piergianni type player. On the other hand, the new management may look for someone slightly more comfortable on the ball so I have included a few here who may fit that aspect greater than the physical aspects.\n\nThese options listed are a blend of both, all are out of contract as well but could well be snapped up quickly if Boro don’t move.\n\nCaleb Taylor\n\nHas had a loan spell at Bolton that really hasn’t worked out but that doesn’t take away from the fact there is still a great centre back in Taylor. He was one of the standout players at Cheltenham the season before in keeping them in League 1, a side that in his absence have consequently been relegated to League 2.\n\nGiven his lack of game time at Bolton I struggle to see him fitting into West Brom’s plans next season and could anticipate him being sent on loan again. Comfortable on the ball, and does the basics of defending well. Would be a good addition as well if the management look at using Terence Vancooten in a role just in front of the back line, as Taylor could provide assurance with the ball at feet over some of Boro’s other centre back options.\n\nSam Hughes\n\nInitially when I had Hughes on this list I saw Burton going down to League 2. Despite the Brewers surviving I see big changes there over the Summer and potentially a large player turnover. Hughes is out of contract and whilst Burton will be keen to keep hold of him I can see him entertaining options elsewhere.\n\nThose who watched Hughes at the Lamex will remember how impressive he was in the air. I’m sure he won’t be short of offers though.\n\nBrad Hills\n\nOne of my personal favourite shouts in the entire doc. Hills has had a great season out at Accrington Stanley and possesses all the abilities to step into the Stevenage back line next season. Most likely to slot in on the right side of the central defenders, he has proven a strong dualist at Stanley, something the Stevenage defence look for greatly.\n\nIf Norwich do not go up, there may be the slight chance that they decide to give Hills a look in the Championship, but I personally see a season in League 1 as the best route for his development. Stylistically, I think Stevenage would be a perfect fit for him.\n\nDynel Simeu\n\nSomeone who I have always been a big fan of but hasn’t quite been able to kick on in the way I thought he would. Simeu is out of contract at Southampton this Summer and has found first team opportunities there extremely limited. He has had a series of loan spells in the EFL where by all accounts he has been a strong central defender.\n\nThis could potentially be a perfect project for the new management team, with Banfield’s experience of working with young players, and of course the defensive expertise of Scott Cuthbert. I’m confident with this support team behind him, Simeu could develop into a top League 1 defender, and fulfil the potential I’ve always felt he has.\n\nRomoney Crichlow-Noble\n\nThis is a deal that I could only really see if Piergianni was to depart, most likely to Rotherham, in the Summer. Crichlow-Noble had a top season in 2022/23 on loan at Bradford and Bantams fans were gutted to see him join Peterborough in the Summer. However, things just haven’t worked out for Romoney at Posh, and he has been transfer listed.\n\nAdmittedly, it’s difficult to break into a side that have Ronnie Edwards and Josh Knight in their defensive ranks, but I thought Crichlow-Noble would have played far more for Peterborough than what has transpired. I believe he will be transfer listed by Posh this Summer, and he would be a suitable replacement should our fears become reality and Pidge departs.\n\nTarget 3: Left sided defender\n\nThis issue I expect to still be addressed even if Boro opt to sign Nesta Guinness-Walker upon the expiry of his contract at Reading. I think it’s clear to see he may be comfortable playing in a 5 back, but a 4 back would be a bit more of an issue.\n\nOne quality that Dan Butler has is ground duels, and another his endless work rate. It’s important that his competition coming in has these traits. However, to give the squad more depth and flexibility this player needs to ideally be a touch faster and more creative, especially if we are to stick with plenty of deep crosses into 24/25. I feel someone who is confident to take on players from left back is a lot easier said than done, and whilst preferable I can’t see us committing overly down the left.\n\nSome options who may fit the bill:\n\nNesta Guinness-Walker\n\nNeeds no introduction. If Nesta is signed not only does he give Revell an extra option at left back, but also one slightly further forward should the 4–3–3 be utilised extensively. I’m not overly sure on how comfortable I’d be with him starting as an out-and-out left back, as he tends to get caught out of position a bit too much for my liking, but certainly in the 3 at the back formation, he is a great option in those wider areas.\n\nThere was a lot of ambiguity about the role Nesta played during his loan spell here, but with a definitive role in the team I believe we have enough evidence to suggest that Guinness-Walker on a free could be a shrewd piece of business.\n\nLewis Gordon\n\nI’ll keep this one short. I included Lewis Gordon in my January transfer doc as well. I think a lot makes sense in terms of this deal. A slightly different profile to Butler in the sense that he is more mobile and eager to get forwards. Possibly didn’t get the opportunities at Bristol Rovers. As what is likely to be an understudy to Dan Butler I don’t think it’s the worst signing we could make. Youth career at Watford, so he is fairly local as well.\n\nRio Adebisi\n\nIt would be nice to see Stevenage have a go for Adebisi. Out of contract at Crewe I don’t think he is quite ready for the step up to the Championship yet, but certainly a move to League 1. The requirement for this position is mainly around mobility and Adebisi provides that in abundance, he would be the perfect alternative to Butler. One of the standout full backs in League 2 this season.\n\nHowever, there are plenty of reasons I see this not happening. The first being location, the second being game time. If Adebisi signs for a League 1 side, he will expect to be a guaranteed starter every week. Unless you move Dan Butler to left centre back like we saw a couple of times last year, I’m not sure that’s a guarantee here. I also expect he will have a host of offers on the table, it depends how competitive we would be willing to be for a position that isn’t the number 1 priority.\n\nRosaire Longelo-Mbule\n\nIn a positional sense a very similar profile to Guinness-Walker. I’ve liked Longelo when I’ve seen him at Accrington, and he is also out of contract. However, similarly to Guinness-Walker I’m not sure if I could trust his defensive abilities in isolation.\n\nAlso capable of playing further forward and on either wing, Longelo could be a versatile option for Revell. However, this would be a move away from the successful squad building of the past few seasons where every player has had a clear role and position within the team. There hasn’t been that utility option in a great capacity at the club.\n\nNick Tsaroulla\n\nI’m not sure if this deal becomes slightly harder to pull off because Crawley are promoted to League 1. You would imagine that they are going to look to keep the majority of their playoff winning squad together. Certainly, as an option Nick Tsaroulla would be a useful backup, however, that is no more than what he has been at Crawley in the past few months. Have we missed the boat with this one?\n\nAt his very best Tsaroulla brings a drive which Boro have lacked on the left side in attack and possesses a greater goal threat than Butler. Defensively he is more solid than the majority of these targets as well. I think this comes down to how open Crawley are to facilitating a move, which remains to be seen.\n\nTarget 4: Defensive midfielder\n\nThis is a position that I feel is vital to any team. A midfielder who does a lot of the ‘dirty work’ which often goes unnoticed. In the Stevenage system this is a player who picks up second balls, wins aerial duels and breaks up play. This is essentially the role Finley Burns has been in this season.\n\nWhilst Burns has done a decent job, I don’t see him staying and this role is crucial especially when playing against top sides in the league. It’s less important in games where you have the majority share of possession. This player must be strong aerially, show good anticipation and reading of the game, physically strong and be able to offload the ball swiftly and accurately. It’s a vital player to have in this squad I feel, and here are some options who could fill the void.\n\nBrendan Wiredu\n\nYou all knew I’d put this man down. However, so will over half of League 1 and probably some clubs in the Championship. I’ve raved about Wiredu for years and it speaks volumes when a side comes 22nd in League 1 and Championship clubs are already being linked with him.\n\nThe likelihood is this is probably a move that Stevenage get priced out of. Fleetwood are in a strong position with Wiredu contracted for the season, and therefore they can dictate his price fairly flexibly. It will probably prove to be a step too far for Stevenage, but this guy is the real deal and could transform any side in the division.\n\nTyreeq Bakinson\n\nBakinson has had a fairly interesting few years. He’s been at several clubs who have operated either at the lower end of the Championship, or the higher end of League 1. However, I don’t see a future for him under Danny Rohl at Sheffield Wednesday, and his reviews from Charlton have hardly been glittering either.\n\nI do still think there’s something there in Bakinson though. Still only 25 you’d like to think his career hasn’t peaked, and as I’ve said he has got experience at a higher level. He may potentially need patience, and a run of games to find his feet, but with his stature and skill set, I wonder if Revs maybe could take a punt on Bakinson and see if he can come good again.\n\nEli King\n\nWas a real standout on loan at Morecambe last season and has held his own in a Ross County side that have struggled in the Scottish Premiership. I think King is ready to make the step up in another loan move from Cardiff, but this time to League 1.\n\nHe has all the attributes required for this position and comes across as a hard-working midfielder, who is comfortable on the ball. King may even be used by Cardiff next season. He is also capable of playing in defence. This is an option that should be achievable for Stevenage’s budget, and if Revell wants a Burns replacement then King may be the closest to that.\n\nMatthew Craig\n\nCraig was a key part of Doncaster’s revelation in form in 2024. A really tough tackler who has a 64% win rate in ground duels, and also an impressive 78% pass accuracy. Craig will surely make the jump up the football pyramid this Summer, and whilst he may not be as strong aerially as some of the other candidates, he will certainly provide stability in the Boro midfield.\n\nOn a loan as well, this seems a bit of a no brainer for Boro, unless they are looking for someone who will dominate aerially in the middle.\n\nSam Rak-Sakyi\n\nOut of contract at Chelsea, again as he is a youth player he could well be offered a new deal. I think Rak-Sakyi has the attributes to play the role required in this Stevenage side, but there would be significant learning curves along the way.\n\nFor a youngster who’s never played any level of senior football, it would be too much pressure to sign him as ‘the answer’ to this positional dilemma. However, I think this is a good coaching department, and Revs has developed young midfielders well in the past. Think Arthur Read and Jack Smith in his last tenure at the Lamex, maybe Rak-Sakyi could gain a lot from this experience as well.\n\nLewis Warrington\n\nA completely different profile, who is included as somewhat of a wildcard. Should Revell look to change the way Stevenage play completely Warrington could be a smart pickup. Comfortable on the ball and dictating the tempo of play, if Boro look to go to a more possession-based style, Warrington may be top of Revell’s shortlist.\n\nTarget 5: Ball carrying midfielder\n\nWhat has become evident in the Boro squad over the past few months has been the lack of ball carriers in the Boro midfield. This isn’t a criticism in any way of our current players, as they all offer other qualities to the starting XI in their own right, but aside from Nick Freeman I’d argue there is a lack of drive in the midfield. This has resulted in a lot of passing from side-to-side against sides happy to invite pressure, and little chance creation when the ball is at feet.\n\nPlayers who I think could add this quality to the squad are:\n\nPanutche Camara\n\nThis may raise a few eyebrows from both sides. Camara is a great player when fit, it’s just keeping Camara fit that has been the issue for the majority of his career. He’s a brilliant ball carrier from deeper areas though, and loves to take players on at pace.\n\nHe is out of contract, and many clubs would like to think a fit Camara would give them a far better chance of achieving their goals this season. However, it must be said not many will take a gamble on someone with such an injury record, and maybe that’s something Revs isn’t able to look past.\n\nAlistair Smith\n\nI’m really surprised things haven’t worked out at Lincoln for Smith. At Sutton he showed all the qualities you’d need to make the step up to League 1. Provided goals from midfield, was comfortable to drive at the opposition, and in truth I thought he’d suit Lincoln’s style perfectly.\n\nHowever, under Skubala things never really got going and at Colchester despite a bright start that run of form almost ran out of steam towards the end of the season. Smith needs a fresh start and whilst he’s a great progressive carrier from midfield, I’m unsure on his defensive qualities were he to come into the Boro midfield. One to keep an eye on.\n\nAnthony Mancini\n\nHartlepool signed Mancini from being a bit of an unknown at the beginning of the 2023/24 season but he quickly established himself as a real force in their midfield. He’s a player who has plenty of similarities to Jake Forster-Caskey, but can also play as a slightly more advanced 8, which could be useful if Revell looks to transition to a 3–4–2–1.\n\nHowever, the main reservation is his injury record. Mancini whilst possessing plenty of ability just wasn’t fit regularly enough. That alongside the jump in level is a big risk, but he is a player who with a full season under his belt is likely to see his stock rise hugely.\n\nJJ McKiernan\n\nI really don’t see any reason why we don’t do this. Geographically, McKiernan is from the South and spent 5 years of his youth career playing in Hertfordshire for Watford. He is capable of playing as an 8 and a 10 and his off the ball intelligence is that of a player way beyond his years.\n\nMorecambe as we know could be pressured into selling McKiernan for a far lower fee than he perhaps justifies. He would add a real spark to the midfield, and drive Boro forwards in attack. He could be the perfect replacement for Jake Forster-Caskey this season.\n\nCameron McGeehan\n\nAfter several seasons in Belgium, McGeehan was someone who’d slipped under the radar for English clubs. Colchester bringing him in was a really intelligent piece of business and in honesty probably the signing that has maintained their EFL status with 13 G/A.\n\nMcGeehan is out of contract this Summer and whilst Colchester will be eager to renew his deal, he is no stranger to League 1 football and could be swayed by a possible opportunity at a higher level. At 29 it could be his last chance to move up the ladder. His experience and intelligent runs into the centre of the area mean he is capable of playing both as an 8 and a 10.\n\nTarget 6: Attacking midfielder\n\nThis is a gap which has been evident in the squad structure for 2 years. We attempted to fill it with Daryl Horgan in 2023 and that didn’t quite work. The only other player who we’ve seen tried and tested in the Jordan Roberts role is Nick Freeman, and we worked out he was far better in a deeper role. This leaves a few questions in my mind. How exclusive is this role to Jordan Roberts as a player? Just how important is it to have a backup?\n\nI think we’ve seen this season the need for an alternative in this position. Roberts has been used a lot, as you would given he’s one of your best players, and I’m not sure if this has had a negative effect on performance. Some fresh legs have been needed on certain occasions to help Roberts out, it’s been the case of having the right player though. A player who is capable of taking players on, occupying vacant spaces, delivering dangerous crosses in from deeper areas and playing well-weighted through balls.\n\nTo find all of those qualities is near impossible it has to be said for the budget Stevenage have, that player would have been picked up a long time ago. However, here’s a few names I think have the majority of those qualities. We may even look at signing 1 or 2 dependent on whether the 3–4–2–1 thoughts come to fruition.\n\nChris Conn-Clarke\n\nI’m not sure where CCC ends up this Summer but I’m fairly certain it won’t be Altrincham. He has plenty of suitors and it wouldn’t surprise me to see him making the move to League 1. He’s been a revelation in the National League this season, as many of you will know.\n\nI do have my reservations about signing him, I’m not 100% convinced that he fits the system, but then again, he’s a player Revell could build around in attacking phases if he wished to. The price tag could also be hefty, but you’d like to think Stevenage could only be outbid by competitors rather than priced out by Alty. Peterborough’s apparent interest makes a lot of sense, and if it is genuine then this won’t be a player we see come through the doors of the Lamex this Summer.\n\nEthan Chislett\n\nYou’d imagine having been relegated to League 2 with Port Vale that Chislett could be on the move this Summer. He’s a player who needs no introduction to Stevenage fans having played against the club for the last 2 years for AFC Wimbledon and Port Vale respectively. 16 G/A in League 1 last season is also a golden opportunity for Boro, especially if they look to play with 2 10’s this season.\n\nChislett is confident in taking players on, can play incisive through balls, and with a striker like Jamie Reid running in behind could be a match made for Boro. This will come at a fee, but I believe it would be one worth paying.\n\nDan Kemp\n\nKemp has just been released by MK Dons following their failure to make a return to League 1 at the first time of asking. He has had promising spells at both Swindon and Hartlepool in the last year and could be a great alternative to Jordan Roberts. Kemp could also play as one of two 10’s if this is a system explored by Revs, as he has played this role predominantly in his time at MK.\n\nAvailable on a free, there is an argument Kemp has possibly found his level at League 2, being fairly prolific in that division. A return to Stevenage where he has worked with Revell before could make a lot of sense though, and I’m sure he would relish the opportunity of progressing to League 1 football.\n\nNoah Chilvers\n\nChilvers is a player who has confused me with his progress for a while. He evidently has bags of ability and a vast amount of experience at a young age, but never really catches the eye of the top sides in League 1. He also plays in a side who have struggled in League 2 for a number of years.\n\nI’d be intrigued to see him make the step up, and I think he’s getting to a point in his career when it may be necessary for his development. Whether it’s a deal Stevenage could manage I’m not too sure, but Chilvers alongside Jordan Roberts will create opportunities, there is no doubt of that.\n\nCarlos Mendes Gomes\n\nI’m not really sure what’s happened to Mendes Gomes in the past few years, they’ve been up and down for sure. From having an incredible season at Morecambe, getting a big move, and then showing promising signs at Fleetwood he’s not played for Bolton since February despite being fit.\n\nGeographically he may be happier in the North as his career suggests, but his move down to Luton shows he could be flexible to a move, albeit to a smaller club. Capable of playing in a 10 and out wide, CMG could be an astute pickup by Revell. You’d assume Bolton will be willing to sell, given his recent lack of game time.\n\nTarget 7: Centre forwards\n\nPerhaps the most frustrating issue for Stevenage fans in the run-in has been the opportunities that have been passed up when presented. There were games we will look back on and think, if only that chance had gone in, and we may have been that much closer to the top 6. Someone who shows such finishing qualities, who also brings an effective work rate and a turn of pace could be Stevenage’s perfect alternative to goal.\n\nIn addition, a player who is strong in the air is almost a given in any team. It’s an extremely useful option to have off the bench, just look at the impact Vadaine Oliver had against Carlisle. It’s maybe not the most important of your strikers, but a handy one to have in your arsenal.\n\nAssuming Oliver goes, and unsure on the future of Pressley, Stevenage may be looking for another player of this profile. Someone strong in the air, and in hold-up play. Not necessarily a prolific goalscorer, but someone whose contributions are noticeable on and off the ball, maybe facilitating the likes of Jamie Reid as he looks for another successful season.\n\nLouis Appere\n\nI know we’ve already signed him, but I had him down anyway. See this as my thoughts on what he can bring to Boro.\n\nThe only player on the list who I have seen linked to Stevenage, where I semi-believe the rumour. You know what you’re going to get from Appere, a buy-in and work ethic that is reminiscent of the great Stevenage strikers of old. Also capable of playing to the side of a number 9.\n\nI wonder how he would take it if Revs wants to play one striker upfront, knowing that Jamie Reid would be the number one choice. Out of contract there will be plenty of suitors for him, I think stylistically though, he would be a great fit at the Lamex.\n\nJosh Coburn\n\nAnother hard-working striker. Coburn has lacked first team football this season but is someone who would be capable of the move to League 1. It would represent a large geographical change but would most likely be on loan. I don’t see Middlesbrough being overly keen to let Coburn go on a permanent deal.\n\nA 10-goal return in his loan season at Bristol Rovers in 2022/23 shows he can do it at this level.\n\nMichael Mellon\n\nAnother signing that would be a loan deal. Mellon could potentially be integrated into the Burnley side after promising loan spells at Morecambe and Dundee, however, the preference may be to expose Mellon to a higher level of English football than he has previously played at.\n\nA striker who has a frightening turn of pace, Mellon would be a real asset to a counter-attacking side like Stevenage. A goal return every 134 minutes in League 2, with a 44% shots on goal rate.\n\nJude Soonsup-Bell\n\nAn interesting one, yet again another loan, as the permanent market is very slim this Summer. Soonsup-Bell has been part of a Spurs youth side who have had great success this year, producing multiple players who have gone on to have a good track record in the EFL this season. He is not only capable of playing as a centre forward, but has recently showed promise in wider areas.\n\nAt 20 years old, this is probably the time to expose Soonsup-Bell to regular senior football, and I believe League 1 is his level currently. Would present some risk given his inexperience, but geographically and financially you’d imagine this would be a deal that Boro could get over the line.\n\nJon Dadi Bodvarsson\n\nTo finish we have a potential permanent deal. When I referenced the need for a focal point, Bodvarsson would be my number 1 pick. Not only does he provide a bunch of experience, but I’d argue he is strongest in his build-up play over his goalscoring ability. Not someone who you’d expect to start week in, week out, but certainly a great option off the bench, or for a fixture against sides who may not dominate aerially.\n\nPositionally he isn’t flexible however, and I feel would have to play with a strike partner, which Revs has said is not a certainty for his setup this season.\n\nObviously it’s worth pointing out now, I have no inclination on player availability and contractual demands, do not think this is an easy process. Signing players is a lot harder within the industry than it appears from the outside.\n\nYou could give a head of recruitment a list of 10 names, the only achievable option could be the 10th name on the list. That’s just the way the market works sometimes. This comes down to geographical reasons, family commitments, more attractive options, player wage demands etc.\n\nHere’s how I could see Stevenage lining up in 2024/25 with the suggestions I’ve made:\n\nTaye Ashby-Hammond\n\nGeorge Wickens\n\nRylee Mitchell\n\nLuther James-Wildin\n\nKane Smith\n\nCarl Piergianni (Romoney Crichlow-Noble)\n\nTerence Vancooten\n\nDan Sweeney\n\nNathan Thompson\n\nDan Butler\n\nNesta Guinness-Walker/Lewis Gordon\n\nLouis Thompson\n\nNick Freeman\n\n*Jake Forster-Caskey*\n\nBen Thompson\n\nHarvey White\n\nMatthew Craig\n\nJJ McKiernan\n\nJordan Roberts\n\nEthan Chislett\n\nDan Kemp\n\nJamie Reid\n\nElliot List\n\nLouis Appere\n\nMichael Mellon\n\nAaron Pressley/Jon Dadi Bodvarsson\n\nHarrison Smith\n\nI’m sure this won’t be the only doc I produce over the Summer. The window is a long-drawn-out process that changes day-by-day. Players may depart, other profiles of player may come in, and we may see tactical changes in pre-season which cause me to rethink this plan. I am seriously excited about the Revellution though, and cannot wait for the end of June to come around to see us begin our preparations for the notoriously challenging second season.\n\nI have the utmost confidence in Revs and everyone within his support network, we may need to be patient, and the tactical direction may take time to properly embed into the group of players. However, with the majority of the squad retained, continuity in places with elements of fresher ideas is exactly the approach we should expect.\n\nAnticipate tactical flexibility, especially at the start of the season as we figure out what the best setup is for the group of players recruited. I believe that is something Revs is more open to this time round, and that is just one of many lessons he will have learned. As Steve Evans said, Revs is ready!"
