        "text": "Tim Cahill could be set for an emotional return to Championship side Millwall with the Lions keen to take the Australian international back to the Den.\n\nThe 38-year-old came to England in 1997 and joined the Lions from Sydney United after gaining permission from his parents – Cahill has an English father – to come to the UK to pursue his dream of being a professional footballer.\n\nHe became a cult hero at Millwall and his goals helped them to the 2004 with the 3-0 defeat to Manchester United in the final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff his last of 251 games for the club.\n\nThat summer, he signed for Everton for £1.5 million where he went on to make 278 appearances before he travelled the globe playing for New York Red Bulls, Shanghai in China and Melbourne City.\n\nAnd now, Cahill’s career could come full circle with a return to Millwall close with a source close to the international midfielder stating: “He will be back at Millwall. Tim has already gone to England.”\n\n“It’s not a done-deal just yet but expect an announcement soon.\n\n“Only a last-minute hitch will complicate the signing.”\n\nCahill is keen on the move to boost his chances of featuring in Australia’s squad for the summer World Cup in Russia.\n\nHull City have been knocked back in their bid to sign Aberdeen’s Scotland Under-21 defender Scott McKenna with manager Derek McInnes insisting he is not for sale.\n\nThe Tigers have had two bids knocked back already and McInnes said: “There will be a time when Scott McKenna will move on and he will be sold at some point, but it certainly is not going to be in this window.”\n\nSheffield United are set to boost their attacking options further by snapping up Charlton Athletic winger Ricky Holmes in a £1 million deal.\n\nHolmes was Charlton’s player of the year last season and is being sold by club owner Roland Duchatelet as a “debt management” exercise, if reports are to be believed.\n\nDuchatelet is close to selling the club, with reports suggesting that could be done by early next week.\n\nIn the meantime, boss Karl Robinson is trying to pick up the pieces and carry on managing the club in difficult circumstances.\n\nThe Addicks have previously been linked with a move for Plymouth Argyle star Graham Carey, but it remains to be seen if Robinson is given funds to replace the departing Holmes.\n\nLeague One\n\nBlackburn Rovers could be set to boost their squad for the remainder of the season with a loan move for Huddersfield Town midfielder Jack Payne.\n\nThe 23-year-old former Southend United man has been recalled from a similar loan spell at League One side Oxford United, where his nine assists from 33 appearances puts him second in the top assists chart, behind Peterborough’s Marcus Maddison (13).\n\nLeague Two\n\nStevenage youngster Ben Wilmot is close to realising his Premier League dream and sealing a move to Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nThe 18-year-old is highly thought of and very much in demand with Liverpool, Leicester, Brighton and Southampton all keen on the talented stopper, but it appears that Spurs have won the race for his signature and will pay £850,000 for his services.\n\nStevenage could also be raided for highly-rated teenage striker Mark McKee before the month is out with a number of clubs watching the young Northern Ireland frontman."
