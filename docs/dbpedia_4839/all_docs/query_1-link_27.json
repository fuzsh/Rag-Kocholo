        "text": "Gilbert had to wait for a sight-saving operation in the bad eye after an infection caused by a tiny piece of dirt.\n\nAlthough he made a short-lived first-team return with one eye stitched up as a precaution, the operation led to a further 14 months on the sidelines with his career hanging in the balance.\n\nGilbert admitted Saturday's goal was a defining moment in his recovery. He said: ''It was a big moment for me in only my second home game since returning. It was definitely the best I've ever scored.\n\n''I just want to put the eye thing behind me now and look to the future, but I'm glad to be back and proving myself again at this level.''\n\nl Former St Mirren midfielder Tom Brown is back in football after a career-threatening major injury. Yesterday Brown signed until the end of the season with second division promotion chasers Alloa.\n\nBrown has been out of football for eight months following a cruciate-ligament operation amid fears that he would never play gain. But he came on as a trialist in Alloa's one-goal defeat by Stenhousemuir on Saturday.\n\nAlloa manager Christie revealed: ''Through Tom Hendrie [the St Mirren manager] I knew the work that Tom Brown had put in to get himself back and decided to include him on Saturday. I have fixed him up for the rest of the season. We have a couple of young strikers and Tom's experience will help them.''\n\nl Cork City winger Ollie Cahill has emerged as a summer signing target for Bobby Williamson, the new Hibernian manager .\n\nThe 26-year-old former Northampton Town winger, who is also being tracked by Shelbourne, is available on a Bosman free. Cahill is known to Williamson through his assistant Gerry McCabe, who played for Cork City."
