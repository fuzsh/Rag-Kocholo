        "text": "CORK'S Brian Barry Murphy is set for the biggest day in his life as a football coach after Manchester City qualified for the FA Youth Cup final, the final hurdle in one of the most prestigious underage competitions in world football.\n\nThe Sky Blues reached the promised land for the first time since 2020 by defeating Bristol City 1-0 at the start of April, and that sets up a meeting with Leeds United on May 4th in Manchester.\n\nThis is one of the two trophies that has repeatedly eluded Barry Murphy since he moved to the Etihad, with the other being the UEFA Youth League.\n\nThe coach has still delivered, with his Elite Development Squad now known as serial winners in Premier League 2 after they claimed league titles in 2022 and 2023.\n\nThere’s no hope of a three-peat this year, as the Sky Blues are fighting stay off the bottom of the table.\n\nDEVELOPMENT\n\nManchester City’s season has been defined by inconsistency, but that is not the goal of playing football at this level. It is all about developing young footballers, and winning trophies is considered a bonus.\n\nThe FA Youth Cup is different in that regard. The trophy, like the senior version, is an item of fascination and success often bodes well for the first team.\n\nManchester United are the most famous example of this with players like David Beckham, Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville helping the club win the FA Youth Cup in 1992.\n\nPaul Scholes played in the following year’s final, and he got a runners-up medal after the Red Devils were beaten over two legs by Leeds United.\n\nChelsea picked up the baton midway through the 2010s and used the competition almost like a graduation ceremony for those coming through in west London.\n\nThe first class was in 2014, and this was the start of a four-year spell that accumulated in one of the best groups to wear the famous blue jersey at that level.\n\nThe 2018 team included Reece James, Conor Gallagher, Billy Gilmour, and Callum Hudson-Odoi and they featured in a 7-1 aggregate victory over Arsenal in the final.\n\nThey slowly stepped up to senior football and helped the senior team win the Europa League in 2019 and the Champions League in 2021.\n\nThere are hundreds of other examples, and it goes to show how important the FA Youth Cup is while heightening the job at hand for Barry-Murphy and his management team. Some might look at this as the biggest game of his career to date after a disappointing league.\n\nIf this was senior football, his very position would be called into question over the state of the team and the FA Youth Cup would be held up as a potential saving grace. There would also be questions about their exit from the UEFA Youth League, at the hands of German side Mainz 05 in the Round of 16.\n\nVersions of those conversations dominate modern football, but not at the level Barry-Murphy is working with. His job is to get players ready for the step up to the first team, not making them serial winners.\n\nBarry Murphy’s list of graduates validates that, and it includes Cole Palmer and Oscar Bobb, a player who personally mentioned the coach in a recent interview.\n\n“Barry-Murphy was very important,” Bobb said. “Before he came in, I hadn’t really played any 23s football, I had only played 18s.\n\nI struggled a bit in the 23s and then he came in and he showed a lot of confidence in me and helped me massively.\n\n\"I don’t think I would have got the chance here if it wasn’t for him.”\n\nAnd the Norwegian international is just one player to have worked underneath Barry Murphy, whose role in nurturing young talent has been well-documented in recent seasons. It has made the Bishopstown native one of the hottest managerial prospects in English football, with the likes of QPR even considering appointing him as head coach in 2022.\n\nThat move never materialised, Barry-Murphy stayed put and guided Manchester City to their second consecutive Premier League 2 title.\n\nThere’s going to be more questions about his future, and the time will come when an approach will be made. Until then, there is a job to do and the biggest challenges are yet to come.\n\nOne of them is the FA Youth Cup, and Barry Murphy has an opportunity to lift the infamous trophy next month."
