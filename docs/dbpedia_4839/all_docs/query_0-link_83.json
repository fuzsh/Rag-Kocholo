        "text": "As the Premier League is now in it's 25th season we at football.london felt it was time to rank Chelsea's top 25 payers since the league began back in 1992.\n\nOur Blues writer Oliver Harbord agonised over his list, picking 25 players that he feels have left an enduring positive impact on the west London club in the last quarter of a century.\n\nWhich players from the current side make the list and which players from seasons gone by are including and most importantly who is number one in our countdown?\n\nTake a look and see what you think of the list. If you don't agree, tell us who should be in the list by leaving a comment below.\n\n25. Damien Duff\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Mourinho's side was the fact that he had Duff on one side and Arjen Robben on the other, providing the width and creating the opporunities.\n\nThe Irishman was part of those sensational two seasons and played a big part in the Blues netting so many goals.\n\n24. Roberto Di Matteo\n\nAs a player Di Matteo is probably best known by some for his stunning goal in the FA Cup final, and of course as a manager he led Chelsea to the Champions League title.\n\nDi Matteo sustained a triple leg fracture that ended his career and in his six years he made 175 appearances and scored 26 goals.\n\n23. Gianluca Vialli\n\nAnother one that arrived on a free transfer and in his first season he was instrumental in helping the Blues clinch the FA Cup.\n\nHe also then went to clinch the same competition as a manager for Chelsea, which just about gets him into the top 25.\n\n22. Gus Poyet\n\nIn 145 appearances for Chelsea, Poyet scored 49 goals having joined on a free transfer, which makes him one hell of a bargain for the Blues.\n\nThe Uruguayan midfielder helped the Blues to the FA Cup win at Wembley, while also clinching the Super Cup as well.\n\n21. Michael Ballack\n\nHe had four successful years at Chelsea, helping them to three FA Cup wins, the Premier League title and also the Champions League final in 2008.\n\nFor a free transfer, that was one hell of a bargain for the former German international.\n\n20. Thibaut Courtois\n\nIt is hard to believe that Courtois is still only 25 as he has been around the Chelsea scene for so long. Having been on loan at Atletico for three seasons, he came back and has dominated the goalkeeper position.\n\nYou feel that there is still a lot more to come from him in a Chelsea shirt over the years, however.\n\n19. Eidur Gudjohnsen\n\nYou have to have a soft spot for the playing style of Gudjohnsen and the fact he moved on to Barcelona went to show just how good he was as a footballer.\n\nHe clinched two Premier League titles during his stint at Stamford Bridge as well.\n\n18. Gary Cahill\n\nSome fans may not agree with this choice, but there is no way you can leave out someone that has one basically every competition at domestic level for Chelsea during his time there.\n\nNow he is the club captain for the season and is constantly plagued with the idea that he might not quite be the man who should start. But he is definitely overcoming that thought.\n\n17. Michael Essien\n\nWho can forget that sensational strike for Chelsea against Arsenal when he fired the ball into the back of the net from some 25-30 yards out at Stamford Bridge.\n\nBut he was much more than that and was a sensational holding midfielder, often winning the ball and getting the Blues on the attack.\n\n16. Frank Leboeuf\n\nAlong with Desailly, the pair of them were sensational for the Blues and he also clinched the FA Cup twice during his time with the Blues.\n\nHe also took more than 20 penalties for Chelsea, missing just three times and was a superb defender for Chelsea.\n\n15. Marcel Desailly\n\nIn the pre-Abramovich era, Desailly epitomised what the hard working, no nonsense defender was all about for the Blues and he led them by example with his performances.\n\nHe also captained the side and formed a formidable partnership with Frank Leboeuf at the back for the Blues.\n\n14. Dennis Wise\n\nThere are not many midfielders that would want to come up against Dennis Wise in the middle of the park with his robust play, but also his knack of getting into the box at the right time.\n\nHe saw Chelsea into the Premier League era and made 445 appearances for the club during his time there.\n\n13. Branislav Ivanovic\n\nThe Serbia international spent nine years at Chelsea and won it all, having to play right back or centre back, showing his versatility.\n\nHe missed the Champions League final, broken to him cruelly by Geoff Shreeves, but nobody can forget his goal to clinch the Europa League the season afterwards.\n\n12. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink\n\nHasselbaink is the club's third highest scorer in the Premier League in just four years while with the Blues and he certainly made quite the impact with his style and personality.\n\nUnfortunately, Jimmy Floyd was unable to win a title with the Blues but that wasn't all down to the now Northampton Town boss.\n\n11. Cesar Azpilicueta\n\nOne of the bargains of the Premier League era for Chelsea and he consistent performances over the years as made him one of the undroppable players for the Blues in recent seasons.\n\nHis versatility has also made his crucial, playing anywhere along the back line and also in the wing-back roles under Antonio Conte.\n\n10. Arjen Robben\n\nWatching Arjen Robben cut in from the right wing and then curl the ball into the bottom corner was one of the most wonderful sights that Chelsea fans could see, something Bayern Munich supporters now get to enjoy.\n\nHe may have only been with the Blues for a few seasons, but he clinched two Premier League titles and and FA Cup under Jose Mourinho.\n\n9. Gianfranco Zola\n\nOne of the most creative and technically gifted players the Blues have seen and the Italian was named the 'Magic Box'.\n\nHe helped Chelsea to two FA Cups and netted 80 goals for the club in a successful seven-year stint at Stamford Bridge. A manager one day there? Doubtful.\n\n8. Claude Makelele\n\nRenowned for the deep-lying midfielder position, coming to be known as the 'Makelele role', he was maybe one of the most underrated players of his time.\n\nBut during a dominating time for the Blues, he was the rock that kept it all together, something that N'Golo Kante is trying to do now.\n\n7. Ashley Cole\n\nMade the controversial switch to Chelsea from Arsenal and going on to win the Champions League and Europa League, as well as several domestic titles.\n\nHe also developed into one od the best left-backs in European football and was at the top of his game while at the Blues.\n\n6. Ricardo Carvalho\n\nCarvalho and Terry were an absolute force to be reckoned with at the back for Chelsea and they were the driving force behind three Premier League title wins.\n\nA no nonsense defender, Carvalho was up there with the best of them and was honoured with several UEFA awards.\n\n5. Eden Hazard\n\nHaving joined the club the summer after the Champions League win, Hazard as grown to become one of the best players in the Premier League and European football.\n\nHis next target is to win that Champions League crown for himself, but he still has been one of the superb players throughout the Premier League era.\n\n4. Didier Drogba\n\nWhat really needs to be said about the Ivory Coast international? An absolute talisman for the Blues at time and of course netted that penalty to clinch the Champions League in Munich.\n\nThe Blues' second highest goalscorer in the Premier League era and someone that will be a Blues legend for life.\n\n3. Petr Cech\n\nNot just of the Premier League era but one of Chelsea's best goalkeepers of all time. Broke club and Premier League records galore for clean sheets and was part of a sensational defence.\n\nSuffered his traumatic head injury in 2006 but still came back to carry on where he left off to be Chelsea's number one for years.\n\n2. Frank Lampard\n\nJust knocked into number two, still having been one of the best players in Chelsea's history. The club's record goal scorer, overtaking Bobby Tambling and Kerry Dixon, an astonishing feat playing from midfield.\n\nChelsea fans hope day he will be a Blues manager, but a legend he will always be for the Blues.\n\n1. John Terry\n\nTops the list having been one of the best defenders in the Premier League era. Was with the club for 22 years and led them to some of the most successful times in their history.\n\nCaptain, Leader, Legend. Says it all."
