        "text": "Skelmersdale – National League 2018/19 – Season 3\n\nSo after claiming our standard second season promotion through the playoffs the hope was I would continue my tradition of also going straight up to the Football League.\n\nThe boards expectations were to do my best to avoid relegation, with the bookies giving us no chance, predicting we'd finish 23rd with us and Braintree given no chance.\n\nReputation - We reach the first star of reputation, but are still classed as Local and are suprisingly better rated than Margate.\n\nTransfers - Looks busy, but 14 of those transfers were loans (For some reason the VNL is the only leaguet that doesn't have any loan restrictions?) another 7 arrived on Non-Contract Terms (or frees as we still weren't paying bonuses), leaving just the 7 Part-Time Contracts that actualy cost me anything and one of those was Wilson who returned a week after leaving when no one else wanted him.\n\nSaleswise I let several squad players who were actually being paid go to reduce our wage budget, and then in January terminated the contracts of some N\\C players once the board starting paying bonuses again (whilst N/C players don't get paid unless they are part of your match squad the board still counts a portion of their bonuses within your wage budget).\n\nFA Cup - After a money spinning run last season I was hoping for more of the same to try and get us out of debt, however things nearly went horribly wrong in the Qualifying Round as we found ourselves 3-0 down to non-league St. Neots at half-time, thankfully Metz came off the bench to score a second half hat-trick to save our blushes, and followed up with another hat-trick in the Replay as we won that comfortably.\n\nIn the First Round we faced a trip to Bristol Rovers who were riding high in League 2, and despite being battered we held out and grabbed a 2-0 win thanks to goals from both my wingers who took advantage of some defensive mistakes from Bristol, though there was some bad news as Midfielder Dobie Sprained his ankle in injury and would miss the next two months.\n\nIn the Second Round we entertained League 1 Sheff Utd, and the match followed the same pattern as the last round we were battered but my defensive held strong and scored the winner midway through the second half with our only shot on target after some good work by Metz, though we nearly blew it later giving away a stupid penalty but my Keeper who was carrying a knock flung himself to his right to save the penalty and book our place in the Third Round where we drew a Birmingham side who were rock bottom of the Championship, so much for a money spinning tie\n\nThe Third Round tie against Birmingham got off to a horrible start as they scored from their first attack and with the match being played in awful conditions neither of us really got going with our equaliser being a fluke own goal as their defender Brown switched off at a corner and the ball hit him and rolled into the goal, setting up a replay in Birmingham.\n\nIn the Replay I went a bit more attacking switching from 4-1-4-1 to 4-4-1-1 to try and get at them a bit more but we were hopelessly outclassed (though to be expected considering their worst player is paid more than my entire team) as our poor finishing let us down though in the end Birmingham needed a late goal to finally sink us. On the plus side the two games did earn us ~£125K which put a dent in the debt but the money from a Premier League tie (or even a TV game) would have been nice, though if we did beat Birmingham we would have got League 1 Peterborough which might have been a winnable game, however our defeat to Birmingham wasn't that bad considering they then went on to knock Man Utd out.\n\nWhilst Right Winger Mooney set a new FA Cup record of five assists.\n\nFA Trophy - We didn't get off to a good start here either, having to come back from 2-0down to Kidderminster in the First Round to claim a 2-2 draw, though for some stupid reason we were made to play extra-time and then instead of the game going to pens it went to a replay (apparently we are susposed to be able to choose whether to play extra-time or not but I never got the option). In the Replay we turned up and grabbed two first half goals that were enough to put us through. In the Second Round despite some woeful finishing we managed to just about beat Gateshead 1-0. In the Third Round we faced Cheltenham and would have to endure another replay after we gave away a stupid penalty, finally winning the tie thanks to a Metz goal in extra-time. In the Fourth Round we drew again this time to Grimsby (after having to play extra-time yet again) before a goal from my new Italian Striker De Girolamo booked our place in the Semi-Final.\n\nIn The Semi-Final we faced VNN side FC United who'd beaten us in our four previous matches, though of course with this being a two legged tie we actually turned up in the First Leg and claimed a solid 4-2 win thanks to two goals from fit again Midfielder Luke Dobie as we proved to be deadly in front of goal scoring three goals from our first three shots (though one was a pen and another was an own goal), though conceeding two soft goals meant we weren't through yet. In the Second Leg we extended our lead with another Dobie penalty but were nearly punished by our woeful finishing as we conceeded just before half-time and then again in injury time as FC Utd nearly took us to extra-time but we held on to book our first appearance at Wembley, though rather embrassingly only 20 fans could be bothered making the hours journey down the M6 to watch us book our place in the final\n\nIn the Final we'd face an Ebbsfleet side who we'd lost and drawn to in the League, and to make matters worse someone decided it would be fun to play the match on an International weekend so Midfielder Wilson was off in Botswana whilst another player had been called upto the Welsh U21 side.\n\nHowever that didn't matter as we put in our best performance of the season as we blew Ebbsfleet away, as Italian Striker Diego De Girolamo scored his first hat-trick for the club. He opened the scoring after getting on the end of a cross from Left Winger Adekunle, though some poor defending gifted Ebbsfleet a soft equaliser De Girolamo scored his second thanks to a fair bit of luck, Right Winger Mooney whipped a cross in from the right which caused mayhem in the defence and De Girolamo stood in an offside position reacted first to slot home the ball, however with the goal not being ruled out I noticed on a replay that the ball had hit the Ebbsfleet Defender not my Left Winger so De Girolamo was onside and the goal stood. We then killed the game off in the last 10 minutes with Ebbsfleet forced to attack we hit them on the Counter with sub Left Winger Hussey first floating a cross onto the unmarked Mooneys head and minutes later whipped in a low cross for De Girolamo to complete his hat-trick after losing his marker and secured our first piece of sliverware, and with nearly 20,000 people turning up to Wembley (I'm guessing not to watch us) we made ~£120K from the match.\n\n[video=youtube_share;lKZifi1F_wc]\n\nNational League - Not exactly sure how we managed to finish in the Playoff positions, we started the season off keeping my 4-4-1-1 formation from the end of last season winning our first two games, but lost the next two and were then unbeaten in the next six drawing three and winning three, before being beaten by Ebbsfleet and then we got thrashed 7-3 by a woeful Kidderminster side (who been previously thrashed 8-0 by Barrow, and if you'd taken out those seven goals we'd have had the best defence in the league ) in a match where every shot for each side just flew into the back of the net, we at least responded by being unbeaten in our next three games, but then only won one of our next 11 games losing seven of them we slipped down the table as we just couldn't score.\n\nHowever in the New Year thinks turned around a combination of my November signings settling in and getting match fit and a change of formation as I switched over to a Structured Counter-Attacking 4-1-4-1 formation, which played to our strengths - we defended in numbers and tried to fit teams on the counter with the pace of my Striker and Wingers in the hopes of snatching a goal, but kept enough mean behind the ball so we didn't get hit on the counter and hoped we could snatch a goal or at least draw the match.\n\nAnd that seemed to work as we failed to lose a single one of our 20 league games in 2019 winning 14 of them keeping 11 clean sheets in the process and we only failed to score twice as we slowly climbed back up the table.\n\nWith seven games left we were in sight of the playoffs only two points behind Barrow (4th) and Torquay (5th) and with 1-0 wins over Woking and Eastleigh we took Barrows playoff spot, though draws to Morecambe and Braintree saw us conceed that spot to Ebbsfleet on goals scored.\n\nNext up was a must win game against a Barrow side who'd fallen out of form at the worst time and a win here would end their playoff hopes, and thankfully we claimed the victory thanks to a double from an in-form De Girolamo and to make things better Ebbsfleet lost to Stockport, meaning we two games left we had reclaimed the last playoff spot and had a three point cushion over Ebbsfleet.\n\nIn the second to last game we made the long trip down to Dover and in a poor game we claimed the points thanks to Left Winger Hussey's first goal for the club, however Ebbsfleet also won, but in a shock result Torquay had lost to Grimsby sees us move above them bringing two playoff spots into the fight, with the other two already being claimed.\n\nIn the last game we entertained Northampton who'd dominated the league and had thankfully secured the title and promotion in the last game so they had nothing left to play for, and we took advantage of this putting in a good performance with De Girolamo grabbing another double to secure the points and a playoff position, though it didn't matter in the end as Ebbsfleet lost to Barrow meaning our playoff spot was secure no matter our result.\n\nIn the Playoffs we drew Exeter who'd beaten us in both previous matches and were the last side to beat us in the league back on boxing day and had beaten us back in August in my 100th game.\n\nWith the First Leg at home we dominated the game but were let down by some poor finishing and had to hope the one goal from De Girolamo would be enough.\n\nIn the Second Leg Exeter self destructed as both our defences fell to pieces we gifted them two easy goals whilst they went one better and gave us two pens and we then finished them off late in the second half hitting them on the Counter after Exeter lost the ball from a corner Left Winger Adekunle ran with the ball down half the right side of the pitch and with just the one Exeter defender back against him and De Girolamo he had to make a choice of whether to attack the ball or follow the runner and when we chose to close the ball down Adekunle thread the ball to a now unmarked De Girolamo who had all the time to pick his corner of the net and claim another hat-tick and book our place in the Playoff Final.\n\nFacing us in the final were Torquay who had come from behind to beat Cheltenham 6-2 in the second leg, which was harsh on Cheltenham as they had run Northampton close for the title all season and wouldn't be reclaiming their football league status, though I much preferred to face Torquay as we'd beaten 3-0 in both the league games but hadn't beaten Cheltenham.\n\nThe Playoff Final itself was a poor game as we both cancelled each other out and promotion would be settled by a penalty shootout (its good enough to determine who gets promoted to the Football League but not suitable for the FA Trophy ) which we won after scoring all five of our pens my Keeper was the hero as he saved Torquays forth to book our place in the Football League.\n\nTo make matters sweeter the final was our second trip to Wembley with nearly 40,000 (Torquay) fans turning up we got almost £350K gate receipts from the match to actually take us out of the red.\n\nStat Pack - Most of our matches ended either 1-0 or 1-1 which might explain our lack of fans, the other thing was a worrying lack of fight if we scored first we'd overwhelmingly win the match however if we conceeded we'd be lucky to get a draw.\n\nSquad, Overview, Review and Awards\n\nIn Goal Dean Lyness was pretty much ever present and had an excellent season keeping 22 clean sheets in the league and claiming an impressive five man of the match awards.\n\nAt Right Back Joshua Clackstone had a good season, with cover being supplied by Walsall Loanee Robbie Lees, on the Left Ben O'Hanlon was the best option I had, with cover provided by another loanee Josh Hope from Man City.\n\nAt Centre-Back Jeff Henderson was again the rock at the back with his partner Charlie Oliver also in form, cover was provided by Welshman Ryan Harrington (Everton) who is highly rated and is slowly being retrained into a Centre-Back.\n\nIn the Defensive Midfielder position was highly rated Spanaird Sergio Molina who arrived from Real Madrid via Stoke and had a good season doing the thankless job of protecting the back four, providing cover was Clovis Kamdjo who's contract had actually expired last season but for some reason his move to Hyde was delayed a year forcing me to continue paying him when the money would have been better spent elsewhere.\n\nIn the Centre of Midfield was Botswanian Brandon Wilson who left the club and then resigned a week later when he got no better options, and again had a solid season, partnering him was Portuguese Box-to-Box Midfielder Paulinho who'd been released by Liverpool and is highly rated by my staff with them reckoning he has a Premier League Potential, so I'm hoping he'll either last me till we reach the Prem or will be sold for a tidy sum in the future, and he had an excellent season running the midfield though some more goals and assists would be nice, but he'd be the person releasing the assister. Providing cover was Luke Dobie who despite not really being good enough stepped up when needed and was even named fans player of the year, though I have the tough decision to make regarding whether I keep him on or not next season, the other option I had was Isaiah Osbourne who was signed to replace the leaving Wilson but with Wilson coming back struggled to get into the squad and was mainly used as a sub. The other player I had was Adam Porritt who started the season in the Attacking Midfield role did ok but with that formation not really working he found himself out of the team.\n\nOn the Right Winger was a couple of promising new signings the best was Kelsey Mooney (Aston Villa) who had an excellent season causing mayhem on the right with his 15 assists being a new club record, providing cover was Martin Edwards (Liverpool) who did well when called up and is a better all-round player he just lacks the killer pace of Mooney, I also had Andy Devine on loan from Villa who is highly rated and I might try and get back next season.\n\nOn the Left Winger were more new signings with Jordan Adekunle claiming the position though he only gets it due to his impressive speed, he if comes up against sides that give him the space to use his speed he is deadly however he is useless against sides that don't give him the space, and is likely to be replaced by Chris Hussey who was initially brought in as a left back but was a better Winger, the other option I have is Cypriot Anthony Georgiou (Spurs via Ebbsfleet and Doncaster) who has potential but I wasn't really able to give him a chance and is now unhappy after demanding first team football after the final game of the season.\n\nI also had an interesting loanee from Middlesbrough Craig Christensen who was pretty much brought in because he can play in nearly any position, didn't think players could be generated with that many positions any longer?\n\nUpfront we had a mixed time Khius Metz started the season upfront in the Advanced Forward role as again his pure pace seems to get him more scoring chances than the other strikers I had, though he was even more limited and would either score or be woeful in front of goal, though attempts to replace him proved more difficult than I expected - I loaned in four Strikers all of which proved to be woeful Cameron Peters was highly rated and despite seemingly having excellent attributes for this level was utterly awful, thankfully I finally found a Striker in January (annoyingly the board cancelled my first attempt to sign him and only let him sign after the Birmingham defeat brought in some money) English born Italian Diego De Girolamo arrived after being released by Sheff Utd (which is hopefully their mistake as my staff reckon he has a Prem Potential) and after a bit of a slow start as he regained match fitness he hit form in the run in and with a change of roles to a Deep Lying Forward soon started banging in the goals and was my equal top scorer with Metz despite playing half as many matches and will hopefully keep it up next season.\n\nBest XI - Midfield and Attack is a bit messed up due to the better players arriving in the second half of the season, with Osbourne's sub apperances for some reason being worth more than Paulinhos better starts, with Metz seemingly preferred to De Girolamo purely on appearances.\n\nI'd show the Overall XI but for some reason the screen isn't actually working?\n\nAcademy - Just the one player of note Liverpool born Ghanaian Winger Godfred Amoah, who's actually increased half a star in potential since signing up.\n\nAverage Attendance - still at the bottom of the league but a slight improvement to 15% based on normal season league games only, cup and player games increase it to 18% or by ~100 people.\n\nSalary - Gaining promotion was fairly impressive considering we are spending pretty much the least in the league, bar Margate who only had five contracted players the rest were loans or N\\C players, not sure why they didn't seem to be in debt, though as they also came up through the players and had a lower reputation than us they just might not have been able to attract the players, so they did well to actually nearly stay up.\n\nFinances - Money look at all that money The £500K we earned this month in gate receipts and prize money was more than we earned all of last season. Though the money didn't last long I got them to pump most of it into improving the Youth Facilites after they refused to improve the actual Training Facilities and they then took out a loan to improve our ground, but delayed meeting the league requirements, thankfully it looks like the stadium requirements throughout the football league are the same, which our stadium should be able to reach after one or two more expansions which should mean we don't go bankrupt expanding our ground over the next few seasons.\n\nWe also turned Professional and gained the ability to scout the rest of the British Isles, which should allow us to attract some better players.\n\nManager Profile - I gain a couple of extra points in the Mental Attributes, whilst my Coaching Attributes increase by 2 or 3 in each area, slightly worrying that my coaching area is attacking when we struggle to score Also rather wierdly the board made me ask for a new contract in April where they locked the min to £150 but then shortly after taking the screenshot offered me another new contract, with at leas the new one allowing me to knock my wage back down to £55 p/w. And at the end of the season with money in the bank they have finally let me start a coaching course. I also collected my second Manager of the Year award.\n\nPlans for Next Season\n\nThe main goal is to stay in the Football League, hopefully we'll earn a bit of money so I can start improving our facilities and youth setup.\n\nPlayerswise we might need a wholesale rebuilding of the squad, hopefully we can attract and afford the players we need, with the priority being my Defence and Keeper as they are the same players I used in the VNN, a couple of wingers and some more cover up front and in midfield would be nice aswell.\n\nWe also get to make our debuts in both the Paint Trophy and League Cup hopefully we'll get some fans turning up to those games.\n\nState of The World\n\nPremier League - Man City reclaim the title with 94 points 14 clear of second placed Spurs, with Chelsea and Arsenal making up the top four, Utd can only finish fifth with Everton and Palace grabbing the Europa League places ahead of Liverpool. Swansea, West Brom and West Brom all go down, meaning all three promoted sides stayed up, whilst Bournemouth survive by one point again.\n\nManager wise West Ham go through three managers losing Paco Jemez to the England job (!?!?) at the start of the season, they then fire former Milan Manager Mihajiovic in Jan and fire Monk when relegated. Newcastle finally fire McClaren replacing him with Rio Ferdinand, leaving just Chelsea and Spurs with no manager changes so far.\n\nWhilst Arsenal replace Blanc with Jardim (Monaco) and Utd replace Ancelotti with Lopetegul (Porto via Barcelona), with Bournemouth appointing former FM/CM Wonderkid Diego as manager.\n\nInterestingly Hart (£12m), Smalling and Fellani have all ended up at Newcastle, Stones (£14m) is at Spurs and Wilshere joined Watford for £1.4m they also have Vardy and Austin though neither have played well.\n\nIn the Championship Leicester, Sunderland and Aston Villa all get promoted, with Birmingham, Portsmouth and Gillingham going down.\n\nIn League 2 Bolton continue to fall finishing rock bottom with 11 points and just the one win (they could have waited till next season to implode as they would have take one of the two spots) I'm guessing they are in financial trouble however they haven't gone into Admin so far but this season fielded a team of youth players, and are going to be in more trouble soon as they have scrapped their youth team and sold their facilities so they may not even get any new youth players to repopulate their team.\n\nFA Cup - Man City claim the Double with an extra-time victory over Derby.\n\nLeague Cup - Arsenal beat Stoke in Extra-Time also.\n\nChampions League - Man Utd lose to Bayern in the Final, though the game seemed determined to have a German side in the Final - Bayern beat Dortmund in the Semi-Final whilst they both played the other German sides Schalke and Leverkusen in the Quarter Final, with Utd beating City, with Arsenal failing to make it out of the group stages.\n\nEuropa League - Spurs beat Sevilla to continue the English domination and sees them become the first team to win it twice in game.\n\nFrance - Paris make it seven in a row (four in game) though only by one point, the Cup is won by Bordeaux over Nantes, with Paris beating Nice in the League Cup.\n\nGermany - Another shock as Leverkusen this time beat Bayern to the title and claim an unlikely double winning the cup over Wolfsburg, with Hertha, Gladbach and Karlsruhe all going down\n\nItaly - Juventus reclaim the title, with Napoli struggling to 6th behind Sassuolo\n\nHolland - Another shock as Heerenveen claim the title for the first time, with holders Twente finishing 10th and Heerenveen complete the double winning the cup over Groningen.\n\nScotland - Celtic continue to dominate finishing 20 points clear of second placed Rangers. Rangers won the Cup but lost the League Cup to Hamilton.\n\nSpain - Barcelona finally take the title from Real with 97 pts to Reals 94, but Madrid beat Barcelona in the Cup Final.\n\nLeaderboard points (FM Mode) (My Steam Username is same as here if anyone wants to add me)\n\n(points / position)\n\nSingle Game: 510,420 (107,662)\n\nSingle Season: 483,959 (98,434)\n\nSingle Season in England: 483,959 (51,171)\n\nSingle Season National League: 483,959 (1,520)\n\nSingle Season National North: 17,771 (804)\n\nCareer Overview\n\n[TABLE=class: cms_table_cms_table_cms_table_cms_table_cms_table_ cms_table_ cms_table_cms_table_cms_table_ cms_table_cms_table_cms_table_cms_table_ cms_table_MsoTableLi cms_table_cms_table_ghtShading cms_table_cms_table_cms_table_m, align: center]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD=bgcolor: #007ACC, align: center]Season[/TD]\n\n[TD=bgcolor: #007ACC, align: center]League[/TD]\n\n[TD=bgcolor: #007ACC, align: center]Position[/TD]\n\n[TD=bgcolor: #007ACC, align: center]Achievements (Domestic)[/TD]\n\n[TD=bgcolor: #007ACC, align: center]Achievements\n\n(Europe)[/TD]\n\n[TD=bgcolor: #007ACC, align: center]Leaderboard Points\n\n(Season / Game)\n\n[/TD]\n\n[TD=bgcolor: #007ACC, align: center]Euro C/E\n\n(Place)\n\n[/TD]\n\n[TD=bgcolor: #007ACC, align: center]Average Attendance\n\n(League)[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]16/17[/TD]\n\n[TD]National North[/TD]\n\n[TD]16th[/TD]\n\n[TD]-[/TD]\n\n[TD]-[/TD]\n\n[TD]8,690 / 8,690[/TD]\n\n[TD]-[/TD]\n\n[TD]320 (10%)[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]17/18[/TD]\n\n[TD]National North[/TD]\n\n[TD]3rd[/TD]\n\n[TD]Promoted - Playoff Winners[/TD]\n\n[TD]-[/TD]\n\n[TD]17,771 / 26,461[/TD]\n\n[TD]-[/TD]\n\n[TD]350 (11%)[/TD]\n\n[/TR]\n\n[TR]\n\n[TD]18/19[/TD]\n\n[TD]National League[/TD]\n\n[TD]4th[/TD]\n\n[TD]Promoted - Playoffs.
