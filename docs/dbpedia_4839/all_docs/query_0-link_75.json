        "text": "Arsenal v Liverpool Monday 24 August 2015 – The Match Officials\n\nby Andrew Crawshaw\n\nFirstly a reminder that Arsenal U21s will play their next game at the Emirates against West Ham on Friday 28 August evening Kick off 19:00 Tickets are on general sale at a cost of £4 (£2 concessions). Here is a link to the Arsenal.com page with ticketing information Ticket Info. Should be well worth a visit but you do need to stay to the final whistle (4 goals in their first two games have been scored in the last 5 minutes). The U21s have won both of their games so far and a third will will put them top of the table.\n\nNow o to Liverpool on Monday – Kick off is 20:00\n\nReferee – Michael Oliver\n\nAssistants – S Bennett and J Brooks\n\nFourth Official – N Swarbrick\n\nMr Oliver is a Northumberland referee who is FIFA accredited. To date he has refereed 116 Premier League matches issuing 16 red and 370 yellow cards – pretty much in line with everyone else.\n\nIn the results table from last season Mr Oliver was mid-table he got nearly four fifths of his decisions right (not 98.5% or whatever figure the PGMO have come up with recently) and just over one fifth wrong.\n\nReferee Correct total Wrong total Lee Mason 86.44% 13.56% Moss 83.17% 16.83% Pawson 80.82% 19.18% Clattenberg 78.85% 21.15% Oliver 78.18% 21.82% Dowd 73.44% 26.56% Taylor 72.88% 27.12% Friend 70.59% 29.41% Marinner 70.42% 29.58% Jones 70.00% 30.00% East 67.92% 32.08% Dean 67.37% 32.63% Atkinson 66.47% 33.53%\n\nThe question really is were those errors costly or not?\n\nMr Oliver was in charge for three games last Season of which there are ref reviews for two.\n\nREFEREE REVIEW: Arsenal – Tottenham\n\n66% overall rating (after weighting applied to the decisions), bias against the two teams 85/15.\n\nIn Minute 72 Mason should have had a straight red card for a foul on Özil, In Minute 30 Arsenal should have had a penalty for a foul by Rose on Wilshere. The combination of those errors almost certainly cost Arsenal two points, the game resulting in a draw rather than an Arsenal victory.\n\nRef Review Liverpool – Arsenal. Someone put something in the ref’s tea at half time\n\n67% overall (weighted), bias against both teams 0/100 (yes every wrong decision was in favour of Liverpool).\n\nIn Minute 46 Stirling should have been booked for a dive (Debuchy was booked instead), in Minute 61 Stirling should have had a second yellow card for deliberate handball, in Minute 91 Borini should have had a straight red card for a challenge on Cazorla instead of the second yellow he actually got (yes it didn’t make any difference to this game but he deserved a three game ban rather than one). Arsenal were well on top at times in the second half and should have had a man advantage for the last half hour. Another draw that could conceivably been a win for Arsenal.\n\nThe third game was Arsenal v Chelsea on 26 April there isn’t a full review of the referee’s performance but this was Walter’s take on the game Arsenal – Chelsea, wake us up at the final whistle. Another non-given penalty to Arsenal when Cahill handled in the penalty area in the first half. Chelsea came for a draw and with the help of the referee achieved their objective.\n\nSo three games last year, three draws all, in large part, decided by Mr Oliver, not a great recommendation for his appointment. On a more positive note his first half performance in the Liverpool game was brilliant 14 correct decisions and 2 wrong (neither important) – If only that were his normal pattern!\n\nGoing back to 2013-14 there were again three games\n\nArsenal v Tottenam 1 Sept 2013 (1 – 0) Again no full ref review but this is Walter’s post game piece Arsenal v £100.000.000: 1-0. No specific mention of Mr Oliver so we can assume that he was OK.\n\nMan United v Arsenal 10 Nov 2013 (1 – 0)\n\nLost a battle, the war is still in our hands Phantom fouls made an appearance – designed to help United escape the heavy pressure they were under in the second half, no big decisions just a biased performance designed to assist our opponents. We had twice the number of shots as United and the same number on target. Unfortunately we made one error that cost us.\n\nLiverpool v Arsenal 8 Feb 2014 (5 – 1) Liverpool needed no assistance from Mr Oliver in this game; the first half from Arsenal was suicidal – it nearly cost me a new i-pad on which I was watching the game. Disastrous start leaves us empty handed In the second half we got a penalty (no harm or danger of Mr Oliver getting a sanction from his bosses in giving that one!).\n\nThree games one win and two losses none really affected by Mr Oliver.\n\nLooking back one more year to 2012-13\n\nEverton v Arsenal was the only game\n\nMatch Review: Michael Oliver – Everton Vs Arsenal (1 – 1) [28/11/2012]\n\n70% overall (weighted), bias against the two teams 21/79. No major decisions were wrong, two missed yellow cards for Everton players being his worst decisions. Not great refereeing but we are used to worse.\n\nConclusions\n\nMr Oliver is a typical PGMO referee and knows who pays his salary. He is well versed in the “black arts” of favouring one team over another by (for example) inappropriate application of advantage following an infringement and inventing phantom fouls to break up play.\n\nHis weighted performances are usually around the 70% correct level and in our reviews from last year he got 21% of all of his decisions wrong.\n\nHe is another referee who is averse to awarding Arsenal penalties (unless the result of the game is already decided) so I wouldn’t put money on one on Monday night.\n\nThere have been a number of instances when he hasn’t sent off players for dangerous challenges, I hope this doesn’t happen again against Liverpool.\n\nLast year he seemed to be largely responsible for two of our games being draws rather than wins through wrong Important Decisions (second yellow or red cards, penalties and Goals). The Emirates Crowd will have to be our twelfth man as I fear he will be Liverpool’s\n\nCOYG"
