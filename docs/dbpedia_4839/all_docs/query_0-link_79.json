        "text": "Where next?\n\nPACopyright: PA\n\nSo a huge shock as Manchester United are beaten by a less fancied side.\n\nIt does not get any easier for Louis van Gaal with a trip to Burnley on the horizon, surely lightning won't strike twice?\n\nHead over here for all the reports and reaction from a massive night of cup shocks and until next time, goodbye.\n\nText us on 81111\n\nMK Dons 4-0 Man Utd\n\nChris, in London, via text: The League Cup is the easiest route to a trophy and United have realistically now only got the FA Cup to play for. LVG got this one badly wrong.\n\nSheelagh, via text: Can we get someone to check that the signature on Angel Di Maria's contract is dry, or actually there! He'll be looking out of OT already!\n\nJohn, in Bury, via text: I've seen United lose to York, Oxford and Southend and where are they now? Ajax play 3-5-2 with no problems. Learning to bomb on is the problem! This result means nothing.\n\nJoin the debate at #bbcfootball\n\nFormer Everton midfielder Tim Cahill: MK Dons #wow #BringbackMoyes\n\nTim_CahillCopyright: Tim_Cahill\n\nHmm, pretty sure you took this photo was taken during the World Cup. That's just lazy, Tim.\n\nJoin the debate at #bbcfootball\n\nMK Dons 4-0 Man Utd\n\nThomas: LVG stating 'Fans have to believe in our philosophy'. After the games so far this season, What on earth is the philosophy?\n\nGeorge Watts: When will Van Gaal realise that the 3-5-2 formation isn't working?\n\nJames Attenborough: I don't think LVG has factored in that forwards press harder in the UK than on the continent.\n\nJoin the debate at #bbcfootball\n\nMK Dons 4-0 Man Utd\n\nPeriklies Antoniou: Fergie left Man Utd weak. New squad, total restructuring over next two years. Let van Gaal do his thing. Fans being over-expectant.\n\nShohidur Rahman: Completely disagree with everything Van Gaal said. Wasn't just errors, we were completely outplayed. And wrong team selection.\n\nJeremy Pound: Maybe van Gaal fielded a weakened side because he was scared that MK Dons might expose just how poor his first-choice team is?\n\nReaction\n\nMK Dons 4-0 Man Utd\n\nHere's tomorrow's Daily Telegraph front page...\n\nDaily TelegraphCopyright: Daily Telegraph\n\nCELTIC KNOCKED OUT OF CHAMPIONS LEAGUE\n\nLegia Warsaw on Twitter: #footballwon\n\nJoin the debate at #bbcfootball\n\nMK Dons 4-0 Man Utd\n\nTom Quinton Fox: Manchester United fans are putting a 4-0 loss to a League 1 team down to having a weak team. That weak team had five Premier League-winning players in it.\n\nJoe Prileszky: Van Gaal already talking about luck? That was quicker than Moyes. How long until they \"try their best\"?\n\nJai Dorey: This just shows how good SAF was and how he was. The players at United have shown no heart or desire since he retired.\n\nPENALTY SHOOT-OUT\n\nWest Brom 1-1 Oxford United\n\nAnother shootout. Another upset?\n\nJoin the debate at #bbcfootball\n\nMK Dons 4-0 Man Utd\n\nPhillip Leigh: It's as bad as it gets! The United players should be ashamed of themselves absolutely ashamed! No spirit, no passion, no desire.\n\nChris Pearson: Signing Di Maria is like putting Royal icing on a Victoria sponge cake. Looks good but it's still only a sponge cake underneath.\n\nJonathan Everett: LVG doesn't care about the League Cup. I bet he doesn't even know who MK Dons are. That was a training game to evaluate for him.\n\nText us on 81111\n\nPat, from Somerset, via text: United fans retain faith. The first 11 fit and firing is as good as any in England, LVG will put it right.\n\nKevin in Hornchurch, via text: Capital One Cup or no,t Utd are a shambles. LVG has hell of a task on his hands as media will keep pressure on in a way he has not experienced before. Defence is absolute comedy of errors.\n\nPost update\n\nChelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech: Football is full of incredible moments... Really anything can happen during one football game... That's why I love it!\n\nReaction\n\nMK Dons 4-0 Man Utd\n\nAFPCopyright: AFP\n\nManchester City striker Edin Dzeko: Hahahaha.\n\nText us on 81111\n\nMK Dons 4-0 Man Utd\n\nAdy, from Leicester, via text: I am staggered that anyone is suggesting that this ranks up there with the all time great cup upsets. It would be if this was even remotely close to a first choice United line up. It isn't, so let's get things into perspective.\n\nPaul, from Hamilton, via text: I honestly thought United couldn't get any worse. Well done Louis for proving me wrong.\n\nJenni, in Newtownards, via text: If you were new to football you could be forgiven thinking that MK Dons are the Premier League side and Manchester United the 'lowly' League One outfit. The defending has been so poor at times from Manchester United.\n\nJoin the debate at #bbcfootball\n\nMK Dons 4-0 Man Utd\n\nAhsan Ahmed: Embarassing regardless of which XI is on the pitch. Shocking.\n\nFreddie Hunt: The 3-5-2 system clearly doesn't work in English football. Every goal the ball was given away.\n\nAllan McDevitt: Humiliating of course but what is most concerning is the form of players like Januzaj tonight.\n\nFULL-TIME\n\nCrewe Alexandra 2-2 Bolton Wanderers\n\nAnother 30 here...\n\nPost update\n\nMK Dons 4-0 Man Utd\n\nSteve Claridge\n\nBBC Sport\n\n\"That fourth goal probably summed it up in a nutshell, Afobe just wanted it more. It's gallows humour from the United fans, they've been brilliant. But what they've watched beggars belief and borders on the disgraceful.
