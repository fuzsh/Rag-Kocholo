        "text": "published on 2023-02-21T19:02:07Z\n\nWhere do you start with the Week 1 review? We had Hulk Hogan style walkouts in Wexford, Norma Foley and Niall Quinn seeking out VIP paparazzi in Kerry, Athlone's new Bayside High class and the morals of LOI Season Pass on your dodgybox. After the new improved silk lined, hand stitched Collar & Cuff mailbag David McMillan and Ollie Cahill stopped by. McMillan, the European award winning goalscorer, who for so long has been the architect at Dundalk exclusively announces that he's retiring from the game to be an, erm, architect! He casts his eye over his career and his architects eye over Oriel! Ollie weighs in on LOI marketing, his campaign for an LOI Red Zone, and almost gives us an answer on the GOAT question Shels or Dundalk. It's a high octane, Future Ticketing powered deep dive into the excitement around the games being back and Rascals Brewery are showing our lucky quiz winner around their class brewery and a few tasters as well. Put down that Nutella, its Pancake Day LOI Central, and it's as tasty as a cold Rascals brew."
