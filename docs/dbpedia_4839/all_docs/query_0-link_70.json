Emery has experimented with a 3-4-3 and 4-4-2 this summer but a 4-2-3-1 was the most-used system in pre-season and could be the one the Spaniard turns to on Tyneside this Sunday. David Luiz may make his debut at centre-half alongside Sokratis, potentially meaning that Calum Chambers – who has more pre-season minutes to his name than any Arsenal player – drops out. Ainsley Maitland-Niles appears to have a clear run at right-back for now but the arrival of Kieran Tierney will provide stiff competition at left-back in the long-term. The former Celtic defender will be out of action for between four to six weeks with a groin issue so Nacho Monreal and Sead Kolasinac will tussle for the jersey in the meantime: Monreal has featured more prominently in pre-season and could get the nod in a flat back four, with Kolasinac perhaps more suited to a wing-back role. Granit Xhaka looks a probable starter in central midfield but there is plenty of competition alongside him, with Matteo Guendouzi and Dani Ceballos perhaps leading the charge – Mohamed Elneny hasn’t featured at all for the Gunners after the Africa Cup of Nations and Lucas Torreira has only four pre-season minutes to his name. Ceballos himself has only featured for two 20-minute cameos, so Guendouzi could get the nod – although Joe Willock is yet another name to throw into the mix. Alexandre Lacazette (ankle) faces a late fitness test so his availability may determine whether Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang plays out wide or up top, while Mesut Ozil and Henrikh Mkhitaryan will be confident of starts given that Alex Iwobi has departed and Nicolas Pepe is still to prove his match-fitness – the summer signing featured for the Ivory Coast at the Africa Cup of Nations and may be introduced gradually off the bench, having not played a single pre-season minute. Dinos Mavropanos (groin), Hector Bellerin (knee) and Rob Holding (knee) remain out.\n\nForm Players: Nketiah (three goals, two assists), Aubameyang (three goals, one assist), Lacazette (one goal, three assists)\n\nPlayers In:\n\nMID | Gabriel Martinelli | Ituano (£6m)MID | Dani Ceballos | Real Madrid (loan)DEF | William Saliba | Saint-Etienne (£27m)MID | Nicolas Pépé | Lille (£72m)DEF | Kieran Tierney | Celtic (£25m)DEF | David Luiz | Chelsea (£8m)\n\nPlayers Out:\n\nGK | Petr Cech | RetiredMID | Aaron Ramsey | Juventus (free transfer)FWD | Danny Welbeck | Watford (free transfer)DEF | Stephan Lichtsteiner | ReleasedGK | David Ospina | Napoli (£5m)DEF | William Saliba | Saint-Etienne (loan)DEF | Laurent Koscielny | Bordeaux (£4.6m)DEF | Carl Jenkinson | Nottingham Forest (undisclosed)FWD | Eddie Nketiah | Leeds United (loan)MID | Alex Iwobi | Everton (£34m)\n\nAston Villa\n\nView squad in Members Area (Coming Soon)\n\nContent\n\nWhat to expect from Aston Villa manager Dean Smith in 2019/20\n\nWhat to expect from Aston Villa’s defence in FPL\n\nWhat to expect from Aston Villa’s attack in FPL\n\nJota with plenty to prove as an FPL asset after Villa move\n\nWesley likely to boost colleagues’ Fantasy potential rather than his own\n\nPatience key with Trezeguet after Villa move\n\nDouglas Luiz could unlock value in Aston Villa defensive assets\n\nOur reaction to Jack Grealish’s £6.0m price tag\n\nPre-Season Fixtures/Results\n\nJul 18 | Minnesota United 0-3 Aston Villa | Grealish, Lansbury (Guilbert assist), Bjarnason (Green assist)Jul 21 | Shrewsbury Town 0-1 Aston Villa | Hogan (Wesley assist)Jul 24 | Walsall 1-5 Aston Villa | Jota (Guilbert assist), Wesley (Jota assist), Wesley pen, Jota, Grealish (Wesley assist)Jul 27 | Charlton Athletic 1-4 Aston Villa | El Ghazi (Grealish assist), Green (Grealish), McGinn (Guilbert assist), McGinnAug 3 | RB Leipzig 1-3 Aston Villa | Hourihane (Grealish assist), Hourihane, McGinn (Trezeguet assist)\n\nScout Notes: Wesley has taken penalties in pre-season for Aston Villa. James Chester (hamstring) is unavailable for Villa’s trip to Spurs but Dean Smith reported an otherwise fit squad for Gameweek 1. Bjorn Engels and Ezri Konsa look to be in a straight fight for the spot alongside Tyrone Mings at centre-half, with Engels having started in the final pre-season friendly last Saturday – although Konsa was injured for that game against RB Leipzig. Matt Targett and Frederic Guilbert seem to be Smith’s preferred options at full-back based on their pre-season minutes, while John McGinn and Jack Grealish look safe bets in central midfield. Conor Hourihane’s security of starts looks threatened by the arrival of Marvelous Nakamba and Douglas Luiz, however, but doubts remain over whether these two new arrivals will be ready to be thrown straight into the deep-end at Spurs. Jota has impressed in pre-season and has more minutes to his name than any other Villa wide-man, while Anwar El Ghazi appears to have shaken off an ankle injury to start on the left flank – although Trezeguet is now an alternative option on the flanks. Wesley is set for his competitive Villa debut up top, with Jonathan Kodjia perhaps only providing back-up on the bench. Amid stiff competition, new signing Tom Heaton seems to be Smith’s first choice between the posts and started in Germany last Saturday.\n\nForm Players: Grealish (two goals, three assists), Wesley (two goals, two assists), Jota (two goals, one assist), Guilbert (three assists), McGinn (two goals).\n\nPlayers In:\n\nMID | Jota | Birmingham City (undisclosed)MID | Anwar El Ghazi | Lille (undisclosed)FWD | Wesley | Club Brugge (£22m)DEF | Kortney Hause | Wolverhampton Wanderers (£3m)DEF | Matt Targett | Southampton (undisclosed)DEF | Tyrone Mings | Bournemouth (£20m)DEF | Ezri Konsa| Brentford (£12m)DEF | Bjorn Engels | Reims (Undisclosed)MID | Trezeguet | Kasimpasa (£8.75m)MID | Douglas Luiz | Manchester City (£15m)MID | Marvelous Nakamba | Club Brugges (undisclosed)GK | Tom Heaton | Burnley (£8m)\n\nPlayers Out:\n\nMID | Mile Jedinak | ReleasedDEF | Alan Hutton | ReleasedDEF | Tommy Elphick | ReleasedMID | Albert Adomah | Nottingham Forest (free transfer)MID | Glenn Whelan | ReleasedDEF | Ritchie De Laet | ReleasedGK | Mark Bunn | ReleasedDEF | Micah Richards | ReleasedMID | Gary Gardner | Birmingham City (undisclosed)MID | Andre Green | Preston North End (loan)FWD | Scott Hogan | Stoke City (loan)\n\nBournemouth\n\nView squad in Members Area\n\nContent\n\nThe story of Fraser’s 2018/19 campaign and whether he can replicate it in 2019/20\n\nOur reaction to Callum Wilson’s £8.0m price-tag\n\nIs it worth paying extra for Callum Wilson over Josh King?\n\nPre-Season Fixtures/Results\n\nJul 16 | Bournemouth 3-2 Wimbledon | Wilson (Brooks assist), Wilson (Solanke assist), Fraser (Ake assist)Jul 20 | Girona 2-1 Bournemouth | Fraser (Ibe assist)Jul 26 | West Bromwich Albion 0-0 Bournemouth | Jul 27 | Brentford 1-3 Bournemouth | Ibe, Solanke (Stacey assist), Surridge (Ibe assist)Aug 2 | Bournemouth 3-4 Lazio | Lerma (Simpson assist), Solanke (Fraser assist), Stacey (Ibe assist)Aug 3 | Bournemouth 3-0 Lyon | Wilson (Ofoborh assist), Kilkenny (Wilson assist), King (Wilson assist)\n\nScout Notes: David Brooks (ankle), Lloyd Kelly (ankle), Dan Gosling (hip), Junior Stanislas (knee), Lewis Cook (knee) and Simon Francis (knee) will all miss the visit of Sheffield United but Charlie Daniels and Steve Cook have been passed fit, with Eddie Howe saying on Friday that he would have “no problem playing either player”. Cook may return at centre-half alongside Nathan Ake, although Chris Mepham will be on standby to deputise should the long-serving defender not be ready to start. Daniels’ comeback from injury complicates the picture at left-back, even with Kelly out. Adam Smith could move over to play in that position with Jack Stacey filling in at right-back but it was Diego Rico who started against Lyon last Saturday in what was an otherwise first-choice back four. Jordon Ibe may deputise for Brooks and indeed was heavily involved in pre-season but was still being linked with a move away from the south coast on deadline day, so new recruit Arnaut Danjuma could potentially be handed a competitive debut. Danjuma has played most of his career on the left flank, however, so some readjustment may be required: Ryan Fraser has played on the right wing in the past so one option would be for the Scot to switch sides. Philip Billing will challenge Andrew Surman and Jefferson Lerma for a start, while Dominic Solanke is an alternative to Josh King or Callum Wilson up top – although the former Liverpool man again seems set to provide backup from the bench. Howe said on Friday that he hasn’t seen much of new signing Harry Wilson yet, so the winger wouldn’t appear likely to be ready to feature from kick-off. The four-way goalkeeper battle is still to be resolved, although Mark Travers and Aaron Ramsdale racked up more pre-season minutes than senior pair Asmir Begovic and Artur Boruc. Ramsdale hasn’t played a single competitive game outside of Leagues One and Two, so a first Premier League start may be a lot to ask.\n\nForm Players: Wilson (three goals, two assists), Ibe (one goal, three assists), Fraser (two goals, one assist), Solanke (two goals), Stacey (one goal, one assist)\n\nPlayers In:\n\nDEF | Lloyd Kelly | Bristol City (£13m)DEF | Jack Stacey | Luton Town (£4m)MID | Philip Billing | Huddersfield Town (£15m)MID | Arnaut Danjuma | Club Brugges (£13.7m)MID | Harry Wilson | Liverpool (loan)\n\nPlayers Out:\n\nMID | Marc Pugh | Released DEF | Tyrone Mings | Aston Villa (£20m)FWD | Lys Mousset | Sheffield United (£10m)MID | Marc Pugh | QPR (free)FWD | Sam Surridge | Swansea City (loan)\n\nBrighton and Hove Albion\n\nView squad in Members Area\n\nContent\n\nThe effect new manager Graham Potter could have at Brighton\n\nWhether Pascal Groß will drop in price but increase in value for FPL 2019/20\n\nWhat FPL managers can expect from new Brighton winger Leandro Trossard\n\nThe tough task facing Graham Potter at Brighton\n\nPre-Season Fixtures/Results\n\nJul 13 | FC Liefering 2-5 Brighton and Hove Albion | Dunk (Groß assist), Murray (Locadia assist), Locadia (Suttner assist), Trossard (Jahanbakhsh assist), Andone (Jahanbakhsh assist)Jul 19 | Crawley Town 0-1 Brighton and Hove Albion | Richards pen (Sanders assist)Jul 20 | Fulham 2-1 Brighton and Hove Albion | GroßJul 27 | Birmingham City 0-4 Brighton and Hove Albion | Murray (Locadia assist), Locadia (Trossard assist), S Duffy (Trossard assist), S Duffy (Trossard assist)Aug 2 | Brighton and Hove Albion 2-1 Valencia | Murray pen, Duffy (Groß assist)\n\nScout Notes: Yves Bissouma (shoulder) and Jose Izquierdo (knee) will miss out for Brighton and Hove Albion in their Gameweek 1 opener, with further injury news awaited from manager Graham Potter in his pre-match press conference. We have been treated to the unfamiliar sight of the Seagulls playing a 3-4-3 this summer, with Albion’s new head coac having settled on that formation in their final two pre-season friendlies. Dan Burn has been drafted in to play alongside Lewis Dunk and Shane Duffy in a back three, although new signing Adam Webster will surely challenge for a start at centre-half soon. Webster only signed last Saturday and may not be thrown in straight away at Vicarage Road and the same could be true of £20m capture Neal Maupay, with the former Brentford striker having only arrived on Tuesday. Glenn Murray started Albion’s last three pre-season friendlies and seems to have the edge over Florin Andone, while Jurgen Locadia and Leandro Trossard were selected either side of Murray in both instances in which Potter trialled the 3-4-3. Alireza Jahanbakhsh is another option out wide but there doesn’t seem to be any obvious spot for Pascal Gross in this current set-up, so the German midfielder may only be among the substitutes. Davy Propper and Dale Stephens look primed to line up in central midfield, with Solly March and Martin Montoya again have been favoured at wing-back in the Seagulls’ final two pre-season kickabouts.\n\nForm Players: Locadia (two goals, two assists), Trossard (one goal, three assists), Murray (three goals), Duffy (three goals), Groß (one goal, two assist), Jahanbakhsh (two assists).\n\nPlayers In:\n\nDEF | Matt Clarke | Portsmouth (undisclosed)MID | Leandro Trossard | Genk (undisclosed)DEF | Adam Webster | Bristol City (£20m)FWD | Neal Maupay | Brentford (undisclosed)MID | Aaron Mooy | Huddersfield Town (loan)DEF | Romaric Yapi | PSG (undisclosed)\n\nPlayers Out:\n\nDEF | Bruno | RetiredMID | Anthony Knockaert | Fulham (loan)GK | Christian Walton | Blackburn Rovers (loan)FWD | Percy Tau | Club Brugge (loan)DEF | Markus Suttner | Fortuna Dusseldorf (undisclosed)DEF | Matthew Clarke | Derby County (loan)\n\nBurnley\n\nView squad in Members Area\n\nContent\n\nImproving Burnley on FPL radar from Gameweek 5\n\nPre-Season Fixtures/Results\n\nJul 12 | Fulham 0-1 Burnley | Wood pen (Gibson assist)Jul 16 | Burnley 8-0 Accrington Stanley | Rodriguez (Westwood assist), Wood (Westwood assist), McNeil, Rodriguez, Wood (Westwood assist), Wood, Dunne (Vydra assist), PietersJul 16 | Burnley 2-3 Tranmere Rovers | Vydra (Dunne assist), Vydra (Lennon assist)Jul 20 | Crewe Alexandra 1-0 Burnley |Jul 20 | Port Vale 1-3 Burnley | Wood (Brady assist), Vydra (Wood assist), Brady (Lennon assist)Jul 23 | Fleetwood Town 0-2 Burnley | Koiki (Vydra assist), Wood (Bardsley assist)Jul 27 | Wigan Athletic 2-2 Burnley | Rodriguez (Gudmundsson assist), McNeil (Gudmundsson assist)Jul 30 | Burnley 6-1 Nice | Wood (Barnes assist), Wood (Gudmundsson assist), Hendrick (Mee assist), Gudmundsson (Barnes assist), Wood, Rodriguez (Lowton assist)Aug 3 | Burnley 2-0 Parma | Rodriguez (Lennon assist), Rodriguez (Lowton assist)\n\nScout Notes: Robbie Brady (fit) is a major doubt for Burnley’s season-opening fixture but, Steven Defour (calf) aside, Sean Dyche has a fully-fit squad to choose from. Dwight McNeil looks to have a clear run on the left flank, then, but there is plenty of competition on the opposite wing with Jeff Hendrick, Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Aaron Lennon all available. Hendrick was the preferred option at the end of 2018/19 and has more pre-season minutes to his name than the other two but a lot of his run-outs this summer have been in a central position, so there is still a great deal of doubt going into Saturday’s match. Jack Cork and Ashley Westwood were Dyche’s set-and-forget central midfield partnership last season, while James Tarkowski and Ben Mee are similarly first-choice picks at centre-half. Matthew Lowton has more pre-season minutes to his name than Phil Bardsley and may have the edge at right-back but the left-back situation looks tougher to call: Charlie Taylor was an ever-present last season but picked up an injury in pre-season and featured for the under-23s, along with Ben Gibson, on Tuesday night in a bid to build up match-fitness. It could be that new signing Erik Pieters, who has almost twice as many pre-season minutes to his name, is instead favoured. Chris Wood and Ashley Barnes have played in every single league match in 2019 so far but the capture of Jay Rodriguez provides stiff competition and indeed the ex-West Brom striker has scored six goals this summer. Wood himself has nine goals to his name but Barnes didn’t find the back of the net once and was benched for the final pre-season friendly against Parma. Dyche said afterwards that this was purely because he was levelling out minutes but there has to be an element of doubt regarding his security of starts going into Gameweek 1. Nick Pope played the full 90 minutes in Burnley’s final pre-season friendly and may have the upper hand over Joe Hart in goal.\n\nForm Players: Wood (nine goals, one assist), Rodriguez (six goals), Vydra (three goals, two assists), Westwood (three assists), McNeil (two goals), Gudmundsson (one goal, three assists), Lennon (three assists), Barnes (two assists), Lowton (two assists).\n\nPlayers In:\n\nDEF | Erik Pieters | Stoke City (undisclosed)FWD | Jay Rodriguez | West Bromwich Albion (£5m + add-ons)GK | Bailey Peacock-Farrell | Leeds United (£2.5m)MID | Danny Drinkwater | Chelsea (loan)\n\nPlayers Out:\n\nDEF | Stephen Ward | Stoke City (free transfer)GK | Anders Lindegaard | ReleasedMID | Jonathan Walters | RetiredGK | Tom Heaton | Aston Villa (£8m)FWD | Nakhi Wells | QPR (loan)\n\nChelsea\n\nView squad in Members Area\n\nContent\n\nCan Christian Pulisic become a viable Fantasy option at Chelsea?\n\nFPL lessons learned from Chelsea’s Europa League thrashing of Arsenal\n\nWhy Fantasy managers will miss Hazard this season\n\nHow Eden Hazard’s exit could affect Chelsea’s other FPL midfielders\n\nImpact of CONCACAF Gold Cup 2019 on start of Christian Pulisic’s Chelsea career\n\nFrank Lampard looks to youth after Chelsea appointment\n\nAnalysing the FPL assets Lampard has at his disposal\n\nPre-Season Fixtures/Results\n\nJul 10 | Bohemians 1-1 Chelsea | Batshuayi (Kenedy assist)Jul 13 | St. Patrick’s Athletic 0-4 Chelsea | Mount (Kovacic assist), Emerson (Barkley assist), Giroud (Kenedy assist), Giroud Jul 19 | Kawasaki Frontale 1-0 Chelsea | Jul 23 | Barcelona 1-2 Chelsea | Abraham (Jorginho assist), Barkley (Alonso assist)Jul 28 | Reading 3-4 Chelsea | Barkley (Giroud assist), Kenedy (Alonso assist), Mount (Abraham assist), Mount (Batshuayi assist)Jul 31 | RB Salzburg 3-5 Chelsea | Pulisic (Pedro assist), Barkley pen (Pulisic assist), Pulisic (Barkley assist), Pedro (Barkley assist), BatshuayiAug 3 | Borussia Mönchengladbach 2-2 Chelsea | Abraham penalty (Kovacic assist), Barkley penalty (Mount assist)\n\nScout Notes: The departure of David Luiz means that Kurt Zouma and Andreas Christensen look primed to start the season at centre-half for Chelsea, although Antonio Rudiger (knee) is back in training and Frank Lampard said he would make a late decision on the German defender. Cesar Azpilicueta can of course cover at the heart of the defence, so Davide Zappacosta will deputise at right-back if that happens. Emerson Palmieri has over 100 more pre-season minutes to his name than Marcos Alonso so appears to have the edge at left-back, meanwhile. Frank Lampard has experimented with different systems over the summer but a 4-2-3-1 was most commonly used, so it may be that we see that formation in operation at Old Trafford. Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho have been the pairing of choice in central midfield for much of the summer and will be expected to start in Manchester, with N’Golo Kante still battling back to full fitness. The Frenchman has only 18 pre-season minutes to his name after recovering from a troublesome knee problem and a start looks a tall order on Sunday, with Lampard again saying that he’d have to make a late call on the former Leicester man. Christian Pulisic and Pedro look poised to start out wide with Willian (knee) set to miss out (Lampard said Sunday’s game will probably come too soon for the Brazilian), so the tough call appears to be in the number ten slot, with Ross Barkley and Mason Mount having tussled for that role throughout the summer. Mount has more pre-season minutes to his name and indeed started the final friendly against Borussia Mönchengladbach last weekend but Barkley’s displays have arguably been even more impressive over the last month and his seniority may give him the slight edge at Old Trafford. There is plenty of competition up front, too, with Michy Batshuayi and Olivier Giroud options, but Tammy Abraham started the final two friendlies and could be Lampard’s initial preference. Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Callum Hudson-Odoi (both Achilles) remain sidelined.\n\nForm Players: Barkley (four goals, three assists), Mount (three goals, one assist), Abraham (two goals, one assist), Giroud (two goals, one assist), Batshuayi (two goals, one assist), Pulisic (two goals, one assist), Kenedy (one goal, two assists), , Pedro (one goal, one assist)\n\nPlayers In:\n\nMID | Christian Pulisic | Borussia DortmundMID | Mateo Kovacic | Real Madrid (£40.5m)\n\nPlayers Out:\n\nMID | Eden Hazard | Real Madrid (undisclosed)DEF | Gary Cahill | Crystal Palace (free transfer)MID | Ethan Ampadu | RB Leipzig (loan)DEF | David Luiz | Arsenal (£8m)MID | Danny Drinkwater | Burnley (loan)\n\nCrystal Palace\n\nView squad in Members Area\n\nContent\n\nPalace’s worrying reliance on Zaha and their defensive potential for the new season\n\nWhy Wilfried Zaha and Jeffrey Schlupp changed position for FPL 2019/20\n\nPre-Season Fixtures/Results\n\nJul 9 | Luzern 1-1 Crystal Palace (5-6 on pens) | Benteke (Meyer assist)Jul 13 | Young Boys 2-0 Crystal Palace |Jul 16 | Barnet 6-2 Crystal Palace | D.

Zaha hasn’t played a single pre-season minute since returning from Egypt so a start may be a tall order but Jordan Ayew’s place will likely be at risk if Hodgson deems the supposedly wantaway winger ready to feature from kick-off. Hodgson indeed said on Friday that he would consider Zaha for a start, despite the events of deadline day. With Schlupp out, Max Meyer looks likely to continue on the left of midfield should Hodgson stick with a 4-4-2. Loan signing Victor Camarasa is another option in midfield, though it remains to be seen how match-fit the former Cardiff man is. The back four has picked itself in pre-season given the lack of reinforcements but Gary Cahill has belatedly arrived from Chelsea and will challenge Martin Kelly and Scott Dann for a start in Gameweek 1. Vicente Guaita and Wayne Hennessey have played the same number of minutes in pre-season but Guaita got the nod at the end of 2018/19 and may still be in pole position between the sticks.\n\nForm Players: Benteke (two goals), Wickham (two goals, one assist), Meyer (one goal, one assist), Townsend (one goal, one assist).\n\nPlayers In:\n\nGK | Stephen Henderson | Nottingham Forest (free transfer)FWD | Jordan Ayew | Swansea City (£2.5m)DEF | Gary Cahill | Crystal Palace (free transfer)MID | Victor Camarasa | Real Betis (loan)\n\nPlayers Out:\n\nGK | Julian Speroni | ReleasedDEF | Pape Souare | Troyes (free transfer)MID | Jason Puncheon | Pafos (free transferMID | Bakary Sako | Denizlispor (free transfer)DEF| Aaron Wan-Bissaka | Manchester United (£50m)FWD | Alexander Sørloth | Trabzonspor (loan)\n\nEverton\n\nView squad in Members Area\n\nContent\n\nWhether Richarlison will change position in FPL 2019/20\n\nIs Richarlison or Gylfi Sigurdsson better FPL value at £8.0m?\n\nIs it worth paying extra to have Digne over Coleman?\n\nHow Kurt Zouma’s future could have an impact on Everton’s clean sheet prospects\n\nPre-Season Fixtures/Results\n\nJul 7 | Kariobangi Sharks 1-1 Everton | WilliamsJul 14 | FC Sion 0-0 Everton |Jul 19 | AS Monaco 0-1 Everton | Coleman (Niasse assist)Jul 24 | Wigan Athletic 0-0 Everton | Jul 27| Sevilla 1-0 Everton | Jul 27| FSV Mainz 05 3-1 Everton | Gibson (Mirallas assist)Aug 3| Werder Bremen 0-0 Everton |\n\nScout Notes: Fabian Delph (groin) will miss out on Everton’s trip to Selhurst Park but Leighton Baines (unspecified) has returned to training and a late decision will be made on his involvement. The Toffees’ inability to recruit a centre-half in the transfer window means that Yerry Mina will likely line up alongside Michael Keane in south London, although the capture of Djibril Sidibe puts real pressure on Seamus Coleman at right-back. Jean-Philippe Gbamin is the long-term successor to Idrissa Gueye but it may be Morgan Schneiderlin who gets the nod alongside Andre Gomes in Gameweek 1, with Gbamin not having featured for Marco Silva’s side in pre-season. The same is true for Moise Kean, who only arrived on Sunday – the ex-Juventus striker may be the long-term solution up top but Dominic Calvert-Lewin could retain his place for now. Alex Iwobi was signed on transfer deadline day and would seem likely to be among the substitutes at best, given that he will only have had one day of training with his new teammates before the Toffees head to Palace. Silva said in Friday’s press conference that he sees Iwobi as playing on the left or behind the striker, so Bernard and Gylfi Sigurdsson’s starts could be under threat in future.\n\nForm Players: None.\n\nPlayers In:\n\nGK | Jonas Lössl | Huddersfield TownMID | Andre Gomes | Barcelona (£22m)DEF | Fabian Delph | Manchester City (undisclosed)MID | Jean-Philippe Gbamin | Mainz (£25m)FWD | Moise Kean | Everton (undisclosed)DEF | Djibril Sidibe | Monaco (loan)MID | Alex Iwobi | Arsenal (£34m)\n\nPlayers Out:\n\nDEF | Ashley Williams | ReleasedDEF | Jonjoe Kenny | Schalke 04 (loan)DEF | Phil Jagielka | Sheffield United (free)DEF | Antonee Robinson | Wigan Athletic (free)MID | Ademola Lookman | RB Leipzig (£22.5m)MID | Idrissa Gueye | PSG (£30m)MID | Joe Williams | Wigan Athletic (undisclosed)MID | Nathan Broadhead | Burton Albion (loan)MID | Muhamed Besic | Sheffield United (loan)\n\nLeicester City\n\nView squad in Members Area\n\nContent\n\nHow Rodgers has unlocked Vardy’s Fantasy potential ahead of 2019/20\n\nFPL price change and Leicester move boost Ayoze Perez’s appeal\n\nThe Scout Report on Leicester’s new permanent signing Youri Tielemans\n\nHow will Tielemans affect Leicester’s other attacking assets?\n\nPre-Season Fixtures/Results\n\nJul 16 | Scunthorpe United 0-1 Leicester City | A Pérez (R Pereira assist)Jul 20 | Cheltenham Town1-2 Leicester City| Vardy (Tielemans assist), Albrighton (Mendy assist)Jul 23 | Cambridge United 0-3 Leicester City | Maguire (Chilwell assist), Iheanacho (H Barnes assist), ChoudhuryJul 27 | Stoke City 1-2 Leicester City | Albrighton (R Pereira assist), Tielemans (Chilwell assist)Jul 27 | Rotherham United 2-2 Leicester City | Iheanacho (H Barnes assist), IheanachoAug 2 | Leicester City 2-1 Atalanta | Pérez (R Pereira assist), Vardy (Fuchs assist)\n\nScout Notes: Brendan Rodgers didn’t report any fitness concerns in his pre-match press conference on Friday and said that Wilfred Ndidi will be in the squad this weekend, following a late return from the Africa Cup of Nations. Ndidi may take the place of Hamza Choudhury at the base of the midfield, although the two could potentially play in tandem should Rodgers deem Wolves a real attacking threat. Rodgers has experimented with a 4-4-2 diamond over the summer but a 4-1-4-1 (or 4-3-3, depending on the perspective) seems to be his preferred shape, as it was upon his appointment at the tail-end of 2018/19. Ayoze Perez has featured on the right flank (as well as up top) following his arrival from Newcastle and looks poised for a competitive debut at the King Power Stadium, while Marc Albrighton seems to have the edge over Harvey Barnes and Demarai Gray on the opposite flank having started the last two first-team friendlies on the left. Jamie Vardy, Kasper Schmeichel, Ben Chilwell and Ricardo Pereira look secure in their respective positions, while Caglar Soyuncu appears set to fill the void left by Harry Maguire having started alongside Jonny Evans against Atalanta last weekend. New signing Dennis Praet may be among the substitutes.\n\nForm Players: Iheanacho (three goals), R Pereira (three assists), Albrighton (two goals), Pérez (two goals), Vardy (two goals), Tielemans (one goal, one assist), H Barnes (two assists), Chilwell (two assists).\n\nPlayers In:\n\nDEF | James Justin | Luton Town (undisclosed)MID | Ayoze Perez | Newcastle United (£30m)MID | Youri Tielemans| AS Monaco (undisclosed)MID | Dennis Praet | Sampdoria (undisclosed)\n\nPlayers Out:\n\nDEF | Danny Simpson | ReleasedFWD | Shinji Okazaki | Malaga (free transfer)DEF | Harry Maguire | Manchester United (£80m)\n\nLiverpool\n\nView squad in Members Area\n\nContent\n\nWhat FPL lessons we learned from the Community Shield final\n\nSalah’s appeal boosted by Egypt’s early AFCON exit\n\nHow do Salah and Mané compare after new prices revealed for 2019/20\n\nAlisson’s success as a set-and-forget option in 2018/19\n\nDefender of the Year Alexander-Arnold could break Robertson record\n\nHow Robertson broke an FPL record and whether he can do it again\n\nWhy Sadio Mane was the best-value premium FPL midfielder in 2018/19\n\nSalah’s FPL value up for debate despite another fine season\n\nFPL lessons learned from the Champions League final\n\nPre-Season Fixtures/Results\n\nJul 11 | Tranmere Rovers 0-6 Liverpool | Clyne (Brewster assist), Brewster (Wilson assist), Brewster (Milner assist), C Jones (Woodburn assist), Origi, Duncan (Glatzel assist)Jul 14 | Bradford City 1-3 Liverpool | Milner (Kent assist), Milner pen (Kent assist), Brewster (Oxlade-Chamberlain assist)Jul 20 | Borussia Dortmund 3-2 Liverpool | Wilson (Fabinho assist), Brewster pen (Woodburn assist)Jul 21 | Sevilla 2-1 Liverpool| OrigiJul 25 | Sporting 2-2 Liverpool | Origi, Wijnaldum (Oxlade-Chamberlain assist)Jul 28 | Napoli 3-0 Liverpool | Jul 31 | Lyon 1-3 Liverpool | Firmino, own-goal (Hoever assist), Wilson (Duncan assist)Aug 4 | Community Shield: Liverpool 1-1 Manchester City | Matip (van Dijk assist)\n\nScout Notes: James Milner has recovered from a muscle injury ahead of Liverpool’s match against Norwich City, while Jurgen Klopp said on Thursday that Sadio Mane “looks fit” and is “an option” – so the Senegal international may well confound expectations to start against the Canaries. A cameo appearance off the bench is another scenario given that he only returned to training this week, so Divock Origi – as he did against Manchester City in the Community Shield – will be on standby to deputise on the left flank. Georginio Wijnaldum twice featured on the left wing in pre-season and is another alternative. It may be a four-way tussle between Wijnaldum, Milner, Jordan Henderson and Fabinho for a start in central midfield, with Klopp suggesting on Thursday that Naby Keita and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain are still building towards 100% fitness. Perhaps the biggest call comes at centre-half, with Joe Gomez having been handed a start alongside Virgil van Dijk at Wembley last Sunday. Joel Matip was the preferred option in the 2018/19 run-in and indeed came on to score against City last weekend, so it looks like a close call between the pair. Gomez is an alternative to Trent Alexander-Arnold at right-back, of course, but the latter’s attacking threat will surely be significant against the newly promoted Canaries. Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino both started in the Community Shield after returning from post-tournament breathers and look primed to line up again at Anfield on Friday.\n\nForm Players: Origi (three goals), Wilson (two goals, one assist) Milner (two goals), Brewster (two goals), Kent (one goal, one assist), Oxlade Chamberlain (two assists)\n\nPlayers In:\n\nDEF | Sepp van den Berg | PEC ZwolleFWD | Adrian | West Ham (free transfer)\n\nPlayers Out:\n\nGK | Adam Bogdan | ReleasedDEF | Alberto Moreno | Villarreal (free transfer)FWD | Daniel Sturridge | ReleasedFWD | Danny Ings | Southampton (£20m)MID | Rafael Camacho | Sporting CP (£5m)GK | Kamil Grabara | Huddersfield Town (loan)MID | Ben Woodburn | Oxford United (loan)GK | Simon Mignolet | Club Brugges (loan)MID | Harry Wilson | Bournemouth (loan)DEF | Nathaniel Phillips | Stuttgart (loan)\n\nManchester City\n\nView squad in Members Area\n\nContent\n\nWhat FPL lessons we learned from the Community Shield final\n\nHow Man City assets changed towards the end of lastseason\n\nWhether Kevin De Bruyne could prove better value than Raheem Sterling and Sergio Aguero\n\nPre-Season Fixtures/Results\n\nJul 17 | West Ham United 1-4 Manchester City| D.

Sergio Aguero hasn’t played a single minute since returning from the Copa America so it could be that Gabriel Jesus, who replaced Sane early on at Wembley, gets the nod to lead the line in east London. Riyad Mahrez is available for selection after a late return from the Africa Cup of Nations but Bernardo Silva looks poised to continue on the right flank, while the central midfield three that started in the Community Shield – Kevin De Bruyne, Rodri and David Silva – may well line up again against Manuel Pellegrini’s side. Ben Foden and Ilkay Gundogan are other options in the engine room, of course, but Fernandinho looks less likely to feature after only returning to training this week. Aymeric Laporte has been passed fit and will likely oust one of John Stones or Nicolas Otamendi at centre-half, while Kyle Walker looks a secure starter at right-back after Pep Guardiola revealed on Friday that Joao Cancelo is not yet ready to feature. Oleksandr Zinchenko was preferred at left-back in the 2018/19 run-in and again in the Community Shield, so will be expected to continue in that role with Benjamin Mendy (knee) still sidelined – although summer signing Angelino is another option there. Claudio Bravo played every single minute of pre-season but Ederson will be expected to take over between the posts after his return from the Copa America.\n\nForm Players: Sterling (five goals, two assists), de Bruyne (one goal, three assists), Sané (two goals, one assist), D Silva (two goals, one assist), Bernabe (two assists)\n\nPlayers In:\n\nMID | Rodri | Atletico Madrid (£62.8m)DEF | Angelino | PSV Eindhoven (£5.3m)DEF | Joao Cancelo | Juventus (£60m)GK | Scott Carson | Derby County (loan)\n\nPlayers Out:\n\nDEF | Vincent Kompany | Anderlecht (player-manager)MID | Patrick Roberts | Norwich City (season-long loan)GK | Arijnet Muric | Nottingham Forest (season-long loan)DEF | Fabian Delph | Everton (undisclosed)\n\nManchester United\n\nView squad in Members Area\n\nContent\n\nCan Daniel James be a viable FPL asset in 2019/20?\n\nIs Aaron Wan-Bissaka worth £5.5m in FPL after his move to Manchester United?\n\nPre-Season Fixtures/Results\n\nJul 13 | Perth Glory 0-2 Manchester United| Rashford (Pogba assist), GarnerJul 17 | Leeds United 0-4 Manchester United | Greenwood (Wan-Bissaka assist), Rashford (McTominay assist), Jones (A Pereira assist), Martial pen (Chong assist)Jul 20 | Inter Milan 0-1 Manchester United | Greenwood (Young assist)Jul 25 | Tottenham Hotspur 1-2 Manchester United | Martial (A Pereira assist), A Gomes (Mata assist)Jul 30 | Kristiansund 0-1 Manchester United | Mata penAug 3 | AC Milan 2-2 Manchester United | Rashford (Matic assist), Lingard (Martial assist)\n\nScout Notes: Paul Pogba has been passed fit to play against Chelsea on Sunday, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer confirming on Friday that all of his squad bar Eric Bailly (knee) are available – although Alexis Sanchez is still battling to prove his match-fitness. Solskjaer added that Harry Maguire is in contention to make his United debut after a full pre-season with Leicester, so the England stopper may well be paired with Victor Lindelof – a regular starter under the Norwegian last season and the United centre-back with the most pre-season minutes to his name – in defence. Luke Shaw and Aaron Wan-Bissaka look as good as nailed at full-back but there are decisions still to be made in midfield. Pogba will surely return in the engine room, while Scott McTominay has shone over the summer and Nemanja Matic – who has looked less impressive – are also tussling for a start. Solskjaer could potentially use all three in a 4-4-2 diamond and sacrifice some width but a 4-2-3-1 has been largely favoured in pre-season, so one of Matic or McTominay could lose out. Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford have been dovetailing between left wing and up front and look poised to start, although there is less certainty elsewhere. Daniel James and Jesse Lingard have generally been preferred in the remaining two positions this summer, with Andrea Pereira and Juan Mata having not particularly impressed when given a chance to start in the final friendly against AC Milan last weekend. Mason Greenwood is another option on the right, with Solskjaer saying in Friday’s presser that the youngster will be “involved a lot” in 2019/20.\n\nForm Players: Rashford (three goals), Martial (two goals, one assist)), Greenwood (two goals), A Pereira (two assists), Mata (one goal, one assist).\n\nPlayers In:\n\nMID | Daniel James | Swansea City (£15m)DEF | Aaron Wan-Bissaka | Crystal Palace (£50m)DEF | Harry Maguire | Leicester City (£80m)\n\nPlayers Out:\n\nMID | Ander Herrera | Paris Saint-Germain (free transfer)DEF | Antonio Valencia | LDU Quito (free transfer)GK | Dean Henderson | Sheffield United (loan)FWD | Romelu Lukaku | Inter Milan (£74m)\n\nNewcastle United\n\nView squad in Members Area\n\nContent\n\nAn analysis of Newcastle’s defence and attack\n\nWhat Joelinton will bring to Newcastle and whether he can be an FPL asset in 2019/20\n\nIs Steve Bruce damned at Newcastle United?\n\nWhy Matt Ritchie changed position for FPL 2019/20\n\nPre-Season Fixtures/Results\n\nJul 17 | Wolves 4-0 Newcastle United | Jul 20 | West Ham United 0-1 Newcastle United| Muto (Sterry assist)Jul 27 | Preston North End 2-1 Newcastle United | Shelvey (Schär assist)Jul 30 | Hibernian 1-3 Newcastle United | Joelinton (Manquillo assist), S Longstaff (Joelinton assist), Lascelles (Aarons assist)Aug 3 | Newcastle United 2-1 Saint-Etienne | Joelinton (Schär assist), M Longstaff (S Longstaff assist)\n\nScout Notes: Andy Carroll (match fitness) won’t be ready to feature against Arsenal and is set to remain sidelined for at least two or three weeks, while Florian Lejeune (knee) and DeAndre Yedlin (groin) are long-term absentees. Steve Bruce also reported “one or two little injuries” in Friday’s presser, which could mean Matt Ritchie (hamstring) and Jack Colback (groin). Should Ritchie not recover, then Jetro Willems is in line to deputise. Emil Krafth hasn’t even trained with the Magpies yet, meanwhile, so Javier Manquillo will likely continue on the opposite flank. The central midfield three of Jonjo Shelvey, Isaac Hayden and Sean Longstaff, plus the front two of Joelinton and Miguel Almiron, look fairly settled, with all five players having started the Magpies’ final two pre-season friendlies. Bruce’s other big decision is who plays alongside Fabian Schar and Jamaal Lascelles at the back – Paul Dummett was the preferred option under Rafael Benitez at the end of last season but Federico Fernandez has more pre-season minutes to his name and indeed started in the final friendly against St Etienne.\n\nForm Players: Joelinton (two goals, one assist), Schär (two assists), S Longstaff (one goal, one assist)\n\nPlayers In:\n\nFWD | Joelinton | Hoffenheim (undisclosed)DEF | Jetro Willems | Eintracht Frankfurt (loan)MID | Allan Saint-Maximin | Nice (undisclosed)DEF | Emil Krafth | Amiens (undisclosed)FWD | Andy Carroll | West Ham (free transfer)\n\nPlayers Out:\n\nMID | Ayoze Perez | Leicester City (£30m)MID | Mohamed Diame | ReleasedFWD | Joselu | Alaves (undisclosed)GK | Freddie Woodman | Swansea City (loan)MID | Jacob Murphy | Sheffield Wednesday (loan)\n\nNorwich City\n\nView squad in Members Area (Coming Soon)\n\nContent\n\nOur reaction to Teemu Pukki’s £6.5m price-tag\n\nThe impact Josip Drmic will have on Pukki and Norwich attack\n\nWhat to expect from Norwich City manager Daniel Farke in FPL\n\nWhat to expect from Norwich’s defence and attacking full-backs in FPL\n\nCan Teemu Pukki and Norwich’s attackers score goals for FPL managers?\n\nPre-Season Fixtures/Results\n\nJul 14 | DSC Arminia Bielefield 2-2 Norwich City| Srbeny, Drmic pen (McLean assist)Jul 16 | Bonner SC 1-4 Norwich City | Idah (Roberts assist), Idah (Heise assist), O Hernandez (Byram assist), Pukki (Buendia assist)Jul 19 | Schalke 1-2 Norwich City | Pukki (Roberts assist), Leitner (Pukki assist)Jul 24 | Norwich City1-3 Brentford| Buendia (O Hernandez assist)Jul 27 | Luton Town 1-5 Norwich City| Stiepermann (McLean assist), Drmic (Aarons assist), Drmic (Cantwell assist), Drmic (Roberts assist), RobertsJul 30 | Norwich City1-4 Atalanta| Cantwell (Leitner assist)Aug 3 | Norwich City 1-0 Toulouse| McLean (Buendía assist)\n\nScout Notes: Timm Klose (hip) and Christoph Zimmermann (knee) have been ruled out of Friday’s match against Liverpool, leaving Grant Hanley and Ben Godfrey as the club’s only two fit centre-halves. Jamal Lewis has deputised at centre-back in pre-season so could feature in that position if needed, with Philip Heise able to cover at left-back. The absence of Alex Tettey (calf) and Ibrahim Amadou (match fitness) leaves Tom Trybull as the Canaries’ only fit defensive midfielder but there is plenty of competition for the role alongside him, with Kenny McLean – who started and scored in City’s final pre-season outing – perhaps slightly ahead of Mario Vrancic and Moritz Leitner in the queue. Todd Cantwell has impressed this summer and is threatening a start either at the expense of Marco Stiepermann or Onel Hernandez, while Patrick Roberts is another option out wide. Josip Drmic looks set to play understudy to Teemu Pukki up front, meanwhile. Tim Krul and Ralf Fahrmann have shared game-time equally this summer but the latter has looked a little shaky in pre-season and the consensus among Norwich fans seems to be that Krul has the slight upper hand between the posts.\n\nForm Players: Drmic (four goals), Roberts (one goal, three assists), Pukki (two goals, one assist), Buendía (one goal, two assists), McLean (one goal, two assists), Idah (two goals), O Hernandez (one goal, one assist), Cantwell (one goal, one assist), Leitner (one goal, one assist).\n\nPlayers In:\n\nMID | Patrick Roberts | Manchester City (season-long loan)FWD | Josip Drmic | Borussia Mönchengladbach (free transfer)GK | Ralf Fahrmann | Schalke (season-long loan)DEF | Sam Byram | West Ham United (£750,000)MID | Ibrahim Amadou | Sevilla (loan)\n\nPlayers Out:\n\nDEF | Ivo Pinto | Dinamo Zagreb (free transfer)FWD | Carlton Morris | Rotherham United (loan)FWD | Mason Bloomfield | Crawley Town (loan)\n\nSheffield United\n\nView squad in Members Area (Coming Soon)\n\nContent\n\nWhat to expect from Sheffield United manager Chris Wilder in FPL\n\nSheffield United’s attack-minded defenders could be budget FPL gems\n\nWhat to expect from Sheffield United’s attacking options in FPL\n\nPre-Season Fixtures/Results\n\nJul 12 | Real Betis 0-1 Sheffield United | McGoldrick (Lundstram assist)Jul 16 | Burton Albion 2-1 Sheffield United| Sharp (Stevens assist)Jul 20 | Northampton Town 0-2 Sheffield United| Norwood pen (Robinson assist), Norwood pen (K.

O’Connell and Chris Basham were the regular “overlapping centre-halves” either side of John Egan last season and are expected to line up in Gameweek 1, with Basham and Egan having racked up more pre-season minutes than any of the Blades’ other stoppers. Wing-backs Enda Stevens and George Baldock will also likely continue where they left off in Championship on the flanks but there is less certainty in midfield and attack. John Fleck and Oliver Norwood were regulars in the second tier in 2018/19 and could make up a central midfield two behind a ‘number ten’ at Bournemouth but £4.0m defender John Lundstram has featured prominently in pre-season (registering more minutes than any other United asset in midfield) and could be included to provide added protection. Wilder is blessed with a multitude of options up front, with last season’s first-choice pairing of Billy Sharp and David McGoldrick now challenged by Oli McBurnie, Callum Robinson and Lys Mousset – although the latter already appears to be some way down the pecking order. Robinson has been the man in form in pre-season and indeed started United’s final pre-season friendly alongside McGoldrick, so it could be those two who get the nod. New signing McBurnie has only featured for 45 minutes for the Blades in pre-season so may be initially used as an impact sub on the south coast.\n\nForm Players: Robinson (four goals, one assist), L Freeman (two goals, three assists), Sharp (four goals), Lundstram (three assists), Stevens (three assists), Norwood (two goals), K Freeman (two assists).\n\nPlayers In:\n\nDEF | Phil Jagielka | Everton (free transfer)MID | Luke Freeman | QPR (undisclosed)FWD | Callum Robinson | Preston North End (undisclosed)MID | Ravel Morrison | Ostersunds FK (free transfer)FWD | Lys Mousset | Bournemouth (£10m)GK | Dean Henderson | Manchester United (loan)MID | Ben Osborn | Nottingham Forest (undisclosed)FWD | Oli McBurnie | Swansea City (£17.5m)MID | Muhamed Besic | Everton (loan)GK | Michael Verrips | Unattached (free transfer)\n\nPlayers Out:\n\nMID | Paul Coutts | ReleasedDEF | Martin Cranie | ReleasedFWD | Conor Washington | ReleasedDEF | Daniel Lafferty | ReleasedFWD | Caolan Lavery | ReleasedGK | Jake Eastwood | Scunthorpe (Loan)MID | Mark Duffy | Stoke City (loan)\n\nSouthampton\n\nView squad in Members Area\n\nContent\n\nThe stats that prove Southampton are being unfairly overlooked ahead of 2019/20\n\nWhether Nathan Redmond will change positions in FPL 2019/20\n\nWhat Moussa Djenepo will bring to Southampton and FPL in 2019/20\n\nWhat Fantasy managers can expect from Che Adams next season\n\nPre-Season Fixtures/Results\n\nJul 14 | SCR Altach 1-1 Southampton| Adams (Long assist)Jul 20 | Preston North End 1-3 Southampton | Ings, Ings (Bertrand assist), Vokins (Redmond assist)Jul 23 | Guangzhou R&F 0-4 Southampton | Valery (Slattery assist), Long, Klarer, AdamsJul 28 | Feyenoord 1-3 Southampton | Adams, Yoshida (Ward-Prowse assist), Boufal (Armstrong assist)Aug 3 | Southampton 2-0 FC Koln | Ings pen (Adams assist), Højbjerg (Adams assist)\n\nScout Notes: There were no injury updates in the first half of Ralph Hasenhuttl’s press conference (the second half is embargoed) so we are operating under the assumption that the Saints have a fully-fit squad. After flirting with a 4-2-2-2 in pre-season, Hasenhuttl has reverted to the wing-back system that he deployed in the second half of 2018/19. Nathan Redmond, Danny Ings and Che Adams played in a front three in the Saints’ final two pre-season games and would appear likely to start up top, although Michael Obafemi is another option. Moussa Djenepo will challenge for a start in the medium term too but is uncertain to feature after a late return from the Africa Cup of Nations. Oriel Romeu had an injury-ravaged pre-season but could return to add steel for this weekend’s clash with Burnley, perhaps at the expense of James Ward-Prowse – although the England international is an option at right wing-back or indeed as a third central midfielder should Hasenhuttl sacrifice one of Ings, Redmond or Adams. Maya Yoshida, Jan Vestergaard and Jan Bednarek seemed to be the Southampton boss’s first-choice first back three when fit last season but Jack Stephens is a possible alternative to Yoshida, while Angus Gunn has played more minutes over the summer than any of his positional rivals and looks likely to get the nod between the posts.\n\nForm Players: Adams (three goals, two assists), Ings (three goals)\n\nPlayers In:\n\nMID | Moussa Djenepo | Standard Liege (undisclosed)FWD | Danny Ings | Liverpool (£20m)FWD | Che Adams | Birmingham City (undisclosed)\n\nPlayers Out:\n\nMID | Steven Davis | Rangers (free transfer)DEF | Matt Targett | Aston Villa (undisclosed)FWD | Sam Gallagher | Blackburn Rovers (undisclosed) FWD | Charlie Austin | West Bromwich Albion (£4m)\n\nTottenham Hotspur\n\nView squad in Members Area\n\nContent\n\nFPL lessons learned from the Champions League final\n\nCan a price drop boost Harry Kane’s FPL appeal?\n\nWhether Son Heung-min or Lucas Moura will change positions in FPL 2019/20\n\nPre-Season Fixtures/Results\n\nJul 21 | Juventus 2-3 Tottenham Hotspur | Lamela (Parrott assist), Lucas Moura (Ndombele assist), Kane (Lucas Moura assist)Jul 25 | Manchester United 2-1 Tottenham Hotspur | Lucas Moura (Son assist)Jul 30 | Tottenham Hotspur 1-0 Real Madrid | KaneJul 31 | Tottenham Hotspur 2-2 Bayern Munich | Lamela (Nkoudou assist), Eriksen (Kane assist)Aug 4 | Tottenham Hotspur 1-1 Inter Milan | Lucas Moura (Lamela assist)\n\nScout Notes: Dele Alli (hamstring) is unavailable for the visit of Aston Villa and joins Ryan Sessegnon (hamstring), Son Heung-min (suspended) and Juan Foyth (suspended/injured) on the sidelines, while Ben Davies looks unlikely to feature having only just returned to training following a groin problem. Serge Aurier (hand), Victor Wanyama (knee) and Eric Dier (unspecified) are all back in training, at least, although there is a strong possibility that none of that trio will start against Dean Smith’s side even if fit. Aurier will challenge Kyle Walker-Peters for a start at right-back but, where Walker-Peters boasts the most pre-season minutes of any Spurs outfielder, Aurier has yet to kick a ball since the Africa Cup of Nations. Danny Rose will likely continue at left-back given that Davies and Sessegnon are out but Jan Vertonghen is another option in that position, with Davinson Sanchez able to deputise at centre-half. Mauricio Pochettino has played with wing-backs in the past but has favoured a flat back four in pre-season, either in a 4-4-2 diamond or 4-2-3-1. Speculation over Christian Eriksen’s future may see the Dane overlooked for this one, with Harry Winks, Moussa Sissoko, new signing Tanguy Ndombele and Erik Lamela possibly set to comprise the midfield four – as happened against Inter last weekend. Lucas Moura looks poised to feature in whatever formation is deployed, either alongside Harry Kane in a diamond or further back in a 4-2-3-1. Giovani Lo Celso could be involved but after signing on deadline day, a start would be a big ask.\n\nForm Players: Moura (three goals, one assist), Kane (two goals, one assist), Lamela (two goals, one assist)\n\nPlayers In:\n\nMID | Tanguy Ndombele | Lyon (£53.8m)MID | Ryan Sessegnon| Fulham (£25m)MID | Giovani Lo Celso | Real Betis (loan)\n\nPlayers Out:\n\nGK | Michel Vorm | ReleasedFWD | Fernando Llorente | ReleasedMID | Luke Amos | QPR (season-long loan)DEF | Kieran Trippier | Atletico Madrid (£20m)FWD | Vincent Janssen | Monterrey (undisclosed)\n\nWatford\n\nView squad in Members Area\n\nContent\n\nWhy Gerard Deulofeu changed position for FPL 2019/20\n\nPre-Season Fixtures/Results\n\nJul 18 | Ajax 2-1 Watford | A Gray pen (Doucoure assist)Jul 20 | Bayer Leverkusen 1-2 Watford | Hughes (Deeney assist), A GrayJul 27 | Queens Park Rangers 0-1 Watford | CapoueAug 3 | Watford 2-1 Real Sociedad | A Gray (Hughes assist), A Gray (Capoue assist)\n\nScout Notes: Deulofeu missed the last two pre-season friendlies with an injury.\n\nForm Players: A Gray (four goals), Hughes (one goal, one assist), Capoue (one goal, one assist)\n\nPlayers In:\n\nDEF | Craig Dawson | West Bromwich Albion (undisclosed)FWD | Danny Welbeck | Arsenal (free transfer)MID | Ismaila Sarr | Rennes (undisclosed)\n\nPlayers Out:\n\nDEF | Miguel Britos | ReleasedDEF | Marc Navarro | Leganes (loan)DEF | Ben Wilmot | Swansea City (loan)\n\nWest Ham United\n\nView squad in Members Area\n\nContent\n\nPromising new signing Haller must convince Fantasy managers he is worth the cost\n\nFornals must strive to compete with key West Ham midfielders\n\nWhy Arthur Masuaku changed position for FPL 2019/20\n\nPre-Season Fixtures/Results\n\nJul 11 | SCR Altach 2-3 West Ham United | C Sánchez (Snodgrass assist), Antonio (Noble assist), Diop (Wilshere assist)Jul 17 | Manchester City 4-1 West Ham United | Noble pen (Anderson assist)Jul 20 | Newcastle United 1-0 West Ham United | Jul 27 | Fulham 0-1 West Ham United | LanziniJul 31 | Hertha Berlin 3-5 West Ham United | Fornals (Haller assist), Lanzini (Fornals assist), Haller (Snodgrass assist), Diangana (Sanchez assist), Antonio (Hernandez assist)Aug 3 | West Ham United 2-2 Athletic Bilbao | Lanzini (Fornals assist), Wilshere (Haller assist)\n\nScout Notes: Mark Noble (dead leg) hasn’t recovered in time to face the reigning champions but Manuel Pellegrini said on Thursday that he otherwise has a fully-fit squad to choose from, meaning that Lukasz Fabianski has recovered from a groin injury. Jack Wilshere, who has impressed in pre-season, will likely deputise for Noble and potentially line up further back alongside Declan Rice in a double-pivot given the calibre of the Hammers’ opposition on Saturday. Pellegrini has plenty of options in the attacking midfield positions but Manuel Lanzini, Pablo Fornals and Felipe Anderson all started the last three pre-season friendlies in behind Sebastien Haller and look firm favourites to do so again against City. Andriy Yarmolenko, Robert Snodgrass and Michail Antonio are alternative options behind Haller, with Javier Hernandez appearing likely to be among the substitutes. Ryan Fredericks returned from injury in the Hammers’ final pre-season friendly and may see off the challenge of Pablo Zabaleta and Ben Johnson at right-back, while Aaron Cresswell has featured heavily over the summer on the opposite flank – although Arthur Masuaku has been on international duty at the Africa Cup of Nations and was the preferred option in last season’s run-in. Issa Diop and Fabian Balbuena are the favourites to start at centre-half, with Angelo Ogbonna set to warm the bench.\n\nForm Players: Antonio (three goals), Lanzini (two goals), Noble (one goal, one assist), Haller (one goal, two assists), Fornals (one goal, two assists), Sanchez (one goal, one assist), Wilshere (one goal, one assist) Snodgrass (two assists)\n\nPlayers In:\n\nGK | Roberto | Espanyol (free transfer)GK | David Martin | Millwall (free transfer)MID | Pablo Fornals | Villarreal (undisclosed)FWD| Sebastien Haller | Eintracht Frankfurt (£45m)DEF | Goncalo Cardosa | Boavista (£2.7m)FWD | Albian Ajeti | Basel (£8m)\n\nPlayers Out:\n\nGK | Adrián | Liverpool (free)MID | Edimilson Fernandes | FSV Mainz (undisclosed)MID | Samir Nasri | Anderlecht (free transfer)FWD | Andy Carroll | Newcastle (free transfer)FWD | Lucas Perez | Deportivo Alaves (undisclosed)FWD | Marko Arnautovic | Shanghai SIPG (£23m)DEF | Sam Byram | Norwich City (£750,000)MID | Pedro Obiang | Sassuolo (£7.3m)FWD | Jordan Hugill | QPR (loan)MID | Reece Oxford | Augsburg (undisclosed)MID | Grady Diangana | West Bromwich Albion (loan)\n\nWolverhampton Wanderers\n\nView squad in Members Area\n\nContent\n\nWhat impact with Cutrone have on Jiménez and Jota?\n\nThe FPL lessons learned from Wolves’ Europa League debut\n\nOur reaction to Raúl Jiménez’s £7.5m price-tag for 2019/20\n\nHow Jiménez became FPL favourite in excellent breakout season\n\nDoherty set for FPL price rise but underlying stats hint at more returns\n\nHow busy international summer and Europa League could cause problems for Wolves in 2019/20\n\nWhy Diogo Jota changed position for FPL 2019/20\n\nPre-Season Fixtures/Results\n\nJul 17 | Newcastle United 0-4 Wolverhampton Wanderers | Jota (Jonny assist), Gibbs-White (Jonny assist), Jota (Dendoncker assist), own-goal (Vinagre assist)Jul 20 | Manchester City 0-0 Wolverhampton Wanderers | Jul 25 | Europa League: Wolverhampton Wanderers 2-0 Crusaders | Jota (Traoré assist), Vinagre (Moutinho assist)Aug 1 | Europa League: Crusaders 1-4 Wolverhampton Wanderers | Jiménez (Jota assist), Bennett (Moutinho assist), Jiménez (Jota assist), own-goal (Moutinho assist)Aug 8 | Europa League: Pyunik 0-4 Wolverhampton Wanderers | Doherty (Jota assist), Jiménez (Jota assist), Jiménez (Jota assist), Neves penalty (Cutrone assist)\n\nScout Notes: Matt Doherty and Raul Jimenez returned from injury in Thursday’s comfortable win over FC Pyunik, so look set to be involved against Leicester City. Adama Traore, who missed the trip to Armenia after forgetting his passport, is an option to deputise for the Irish wing-back should two starts in three days prove too much, although the fact that Doherty, Jimenez and Diogo Jota were all substituted midway through the second half of that Europa League tie suggests Nuno Espirito Santo had one eye on the trip to the King Power Stadium. Santo said on Thursday that it will take new signing Patrick Cutrone time to fully integrate into the squad, further indicating that Jota and Jimenez will continue to start for now. Jonny and Ruben Neves were handed rests against Pyunik so should return at the expense of Ruben Vinagre and Romain Saiss. The regular back three of Willy Boly, Ryan Bennett and Conor Coady all started in Armenia but Jesus Vallejo now provides competition at centre-half following his arrival from Real Madrid. Morgan Gibbs-White (knock) is Wolves’ only injury doubt at the time of writing.\n\nForm Players: Jota (two goals, five assists), Jiménez (four goals), Moutinho (three assists), Vinagre (one goal, one assist), Jonny (two assists).\n\nPlayers In:\n\nFWD | Raúl Jiménez | Benfica (£30m)DEF| Leander Dendoncker | Anderlecht (£12m)FWD| Patrick Cutrone | AC Milan (£16m)DEF | Jesus Vallejo | Real Madrid (loan)\n\nPlayers Out:"
