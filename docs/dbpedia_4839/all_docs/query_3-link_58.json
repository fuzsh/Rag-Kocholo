Guitar hero, winged wonder and ex PFAI executive Ollie Cahill, joins us for a chat about Dan's dubious predictions, Away days in Kyiv, \"The Gaza Strip\" in Abbotstown, Paul Doolin, the other 'Ollie' at Shels and a whole heap of miscellany too random to work into this piece. All of this plus a roundup of the weekend games, Dan's twittering, the ever popular mailbag and the Porterhouse mystery voice. All of this as ever is brought to you in conjunction with Collar & Cuff, Future Ticketing and Malone Financial Services, so fire up the outdoor grill and tune in!"
