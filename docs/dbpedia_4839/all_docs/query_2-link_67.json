        "text": "July is now upon us - and Chelsea have still not appointed the successor to Maurizio Sarri.\n\nBlues legend Frank Lampard is still the firm favourite to take over at Stamford Bridge, but the former Chelsea midfielder has not yet been confirmed as the new man in the hotseat in west London.\n\nBut there is still plenty happening when it comes to Chelsea and the futures of certain players, including some that have left the club and some who are returning to the Blues.\n\nBelow we take a look at the latest news from Stamford Bridge.\n\nGonzalo Higuain's future\n\nThe Argentine has not had the best of times in west London, scoring just five goals in 18 appearances since joining the Blues on loan from Juventus in January.\n\nChelsea only had until yesterday (Sunday) to make the decision over whether or not to extend Higuain's stay in London, which seems unlikely following Sarri's departure to join Juventus.\n\nAnd now, Higuain's brother has provided clarification on social media, stating that he will \"only play for Juventus\" next season.\n\nWriting in a post on social networking website Twitter, Nicola Higuain said in Italian: \"Higuain will only play for Juventus in Italy. Two years of contract remain and will be respected. Happy Sunday everyone.\"\n\nInterest in Chelsea youngster\n\nFulham have reportedly entered the chase for West Bromwich Albion target Trevoh Chalobah.\n\nChalobah impressed with relegated Ipswich Town last season, with Football Insider suggesting the Baggies could face competition from relegated Fulham for his services.\n\nBut Chalobah's availability could hinge on incoming manager Frank Lampard's plans, with the Derby County boss expected to be appointed imminently.\n\nGary Cahill's next club\n\nHe left Chelsea yesterday after seven years at the club, but what next for Gary Cahill?\n\nWell, Arsenal have been linked with a move for the out-of-contract defender.\n\nThe England international, who was one of 11 players departing Chelsea when their contract expires this summer, is said to be of interest to Arsenal given their lack of financial clout this summer.\n\nTEAMtalk have linked Cahill to Arsenal, with the Gunners having just £40m to spend this window.\n\nHowever, one of Cahill's former clubs, Aston Villa, are the odds-on favourites to sign the 33-year-old, with Sky Bet pricing the newly-promoted side at 4/6 to sign the defender.\n\nWest Ham are second favourites at 9/2, with Birmingham City priced at 10/1 to sign Cahill.\n\nKeep up to date with the latest Chelsea news, features and exclusives from football.london via our free WhatsApp service .\n\nClick here to enroll or text NEWS to 07557204594 and then add the number to your phone contacts book as chelsea dot london (case sensitive, with spaces) to receive daily updates and breaking news from Oliver Harbord and the team on Chelsea."
