And from some posts on this board it looks like people are already resigned to losing him. \nThis kind of situation scares me, that we can't keep our best players.Why is this ? \n \nAm I being cynical but if you compare Cahills performances this season (his last under contract) versus those over the last few years, I don't think you can compare from a consistancy point of view. \nSpeaking of Judas's i'd take Woods back in a",

But you and me both know he'll be booed til all our ears are sore.\"\n\nGWA, I'm a City supporter and while I'm not an expert on football (I'd say I'd be one of the few people who'd do worse than Gunther) I think I do know about eL football having been following it since Cork United. Now while Cahill was here and looked even remotely like being here next season I gave him my full support even in games, and there were quiet a few, that he didn't seem interested. I also know that the people to blame for him leaving include the board and our \"manager\". But bottom line is the final decision is his own, (I'd have probably done the same myself). Now I've every intention of booing and verbally abusing Ollie for all the games I see him in a City shirt for the rest of the season, and with whatever team he's with next season.I've done the same in the past to whoever left City for another eL team, be it Morley, Cronin, Hill, Freyne, Napier and even players I was glad left us like Gloria Gaynor. It's part and parcel of following a team in my opinion. I've nothing personally against any of these people and if in the future Cahill came back he would then get my full support again as did Morley, Freyne and Napier.\n\nAre we the only supporters in the world who welcome back players who leave of their own free will and choice when they visit with their new team."
