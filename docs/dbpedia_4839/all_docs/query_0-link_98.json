I\n\nNORTH'S RUNAWAY WIN\n\nNew Town's Semifinal Collapse\n\nLaunceston s Narrow Victory\n\nSouth Melbourne Defeat Richmond\n\nTlie League semi-final at Hobart on Saturday was won in\n\nconvincing style by North Hobart, who secured a runaway lead\n\nin the second half of the game, and won by the big margin of\n\n46 points. New Town became demoralised after the half time\n\ninterval, and but for erratic kicking in front of goal on the part\n\nof North's forwards the difference in points would have been\n\nmuch bigger. North Hobart will meet Cananore in the final\n\nnext Saturday, and in the event of Cananore being defeated a\n\ngrand final will be necessary to decide the League premiership.\n\nIn the Northern Association matches Launceston secur-\n\ned a narrow win against North Launceston, and Longford de-\n\nfeated City.\n\nThe second semi-final of the Victorian League was won by\n\nSouth Melbourne, who defeated Richmond. Richmond and\n\nGeelong will meet next Saturday, and the winners of that .\n\nmatch will play South Melbourne for the premiership.>\n\nNORTH OUST NEW TOWN\n\nConvincing Win\n\nNew Town Collapse\n\nNew Town gave Its most disappoint-\n\ning display of the season in the match\n\nthat was vital to its premiership pros-\n\npects, and its second half collapse en-\n\nabled North to secure a-win without be-\n\ning extended towards the finish. Al-\n\nthough New Town held a slight lead at\n\nthe half time interval, North showed\n\nthe most convincing form throughout\n\ntho match, and when it made its third\n\nquarter bid for victory New Town col-\n\nlapsed completely, and thereafter of-\n\nfered weak opposition. North's form\n\nwas the best lt has shown, this season,\n\nand in the Becond halt it hold com-\n\nmand pf every key position on thc field.\n\nThis was most noticeable 'In the ruck,\n\nwhere North's dominating strength was\n\nreally the beginning of the end of tho\n\nI New Town debacle-for debacle it was\n\nI in every sense of the word. Perhaps\n\ntho most remarkable feature of North's\n\ngame was the sterling :piay by the vet-\n\neran coach of tho winning team, K. Ca\n\nzaly, who for throe quarters of thc game\n\nfollowed the ball and whose judgment in\n\ntapping out and direction of attacks\n\nplayed a big part in North's victory. In\n\nthe air Nortli held complete sway, and\n\nas a team it showed vast superiority.\n\nNorth utilised the loose man system\n\nwith great effect, and on tho forward\n\nlino invariably had a player unattended\n\nready to accept passes. Its tactics wero\n\nalso more effective. Its players always\n\ndirected, their attacks via tho proper\n\nwings and secured the advantage of the\n\nsea breeze throughout the match,\n\nwhereas New Town showed poor judg-\n\nment In that respect. For the first halt\n\nthe game was hard and fast, and there\n\nwas little to choose between the teams,\n\nbut once North established a lead in the\n\nsecond half New Town became demoral-\n\nised, and fell to pieces. Tho result was\n\na one-sided finish, with North having\n\n4G points to spare at tho finish. Tho\n\ncrowd numbered 5,500, and the gate re-\n\nceipts amounted to £222. The teams\n\nwere:\n\nNorth Hobart.-Backs, Goggins, Rich-\n\nardson, Bennett; half-backs, Ryan, Ed-\n\nwards, M. Felmlngham; centre, Dallon,\n\nCazaly, Walker; half-forwards, Jones, ¡\n\nPye, Ackerley; forwards, Mills, Pratt,1\n\nMcKay; followers, S. Felmlngham, F. '\n\nSmith, L. Smith, I9th man, Eiszele.\n\nNew Town.-Backs, c. Hughes, Hunt- !\n\nington, Hanlon; half-backs, Lane, Can-\n\nnan, Lobdale; centre, paul, Ling, Mar-\n\ntin; half-forwards, Kean, Scott, Simp-\n\nson; forwards, Kenna, D. ? Hughes,\n\nBrown; followers, Fletcher, Hislop, G.\n\nJames; 19lh man, Woolhouse.\n\nHARD AND EVEN PLAY.\n\n. Football of a hard and slogging type\n\nj was witnessed in the opening quarter.\n\nNorth was the moro convincing In the\n\nopening stages, and with S. Felmlngham\n\ndominating In tho air, lt swept New\n\nTown's defences repeatedly. North open-\n\ned the scoring with a couple of singles, j\n\nGoggins was outstanding In defence foi\n\nNorth whon New Town broke through\n\nfrom the centre. Six minutes after play\n\nhad been in progress Brown opened\n\nNew Town's account with a single, and\n\nan exchange between Cannan, Simpson,\n\nand Brown resulted In another. Wheel-\n\ning cleverly, in the centre, Paul\"- put\n\nKean in possession and his tap-on was\n\ntaken by James, who kicked first goal\n\nof the match eight minutes after tho\n\ncommencement. North missed a num-\n\nber of easy chances in front, the cross\n\nwind troubling tito players in their\n\nshooting. Marking in great stylo, D.\n\nHughes kicked New Town's second goal\n\nwith eight minutes of the quarter re-\n\nmaining. Both sides were using their\n\nweight freely and doing an equal part\n\nof tho attacking, but the shooting for\n\ngoal was erratic, and the scoring low.\n\nScores at quarter time were: North Ho-\n\nbart, 0.8 (8 points); New Town, 2.0 (18\n\npoints). .\n\nPlay liad been resumed seven minutes\n\nbefore Mills, receiving from Ackerloy,\n\nkicked North's first goal. The pace was\n\nfast, with both back lines defending\n\nstrongly. There was, however, early in tho\n\nquarter a noticeable tendency on the\n\npart of New Town to unsteadiness, and\n\nthere was not the same cohesion in its\n\nwork compared with- that of North's.\n\nScott, marking cleverly, passed to Kean,\n\nwho added New Town's third goal. Ca-\n\nzaly had come into tho ruck, Mills hav-\n\ning been transferred to the centre, and\n\nPye to the full forward position. North\n\nalmost immediately established mastery\n\nIn the ruck, getting tho ball away to tho\n\nrover at almost every tap out. Pye\n\nkicked North's next goal, and after the\n\nresolute play of. Edwards and Goggins\n\nhad kept New Town In-check for a time\n\nScott broke through to goal. The play\n\ncontinued to be fast, Cazaly and D.\n\nHughes goaling. Two more goals were\n\nadded for North by Ackerley and Dui-J\n\nton. M. Felmingham figured in several\n\nexhilarating dashes from tho half-back\n\nline. James gave New Town's forwards\n\na number of opportunities, but Its for-\n\nwards wore Invariably behind in the race\n\nfor tho ball with tho possible exception\n\not\"Simpson, who was performing useful\n\nwork. Kenna hit the post just on the\n\nbell, the half-time scores being: North\n\nHobart, 5.9 (39); New Town, 5.11 (ll).\n\nNEW TOWN COLLAPSE.\n\nNew Town completely collapsed In\n\nthe-third quarter, and North establish-\n\ned a superiority, which lt held to tho\n\nend. New Town's play lacked spirit,\n\nand lhere was almost a complete ab-\n\nsence ot leam work In Its' play. The\n\nteam persisted In trying to get through\n\nNorth defences from the press-box\n\nwing, and with a strong sea breeze\n\nblowing across the ground scoring\n\nfrom that quarter was almost out bf\n\nthe question. Cazaly and F. Smith were\n\nperforming most of the heavy work in\n\nthe ruck, ? with Cazaly tapping out .in\n\ngreat style. Ryan, S. Felmingham, and\n\nJones were dominating In the air, and\n\nEdwards- held sway on tho half-back\n\nUne. But for its erratic kicking North\n\nwould have secured un oven bigger lead\n\nthan 28 points by tho end of tho third\n\nquarter. Jones, who was in grand\n\nmarking form, with four successive\n\nshots could manage only ' singles. Play\n\nhad boen' in progress only three mtn\n\nutefi when Cazaly gave North tho load\n\nwith a goal, and Pye, marking In-front\n\not Huntington,. udded another.. New\n\nTown was breaking down on the half\n\nforward line, and North was making\n\nmost uso ot Dalton's wing, whore it\n\nwas gaining a decided advantage. North\n\nattacked for almost tho duration bf the\n\nquarter, but numerous eusy shots fail-\n\ned to produce tangible results.- Mark-\n\ning a chance kick out of a scrlmrmigt\n\nby Goggins, James goaled for No«\n\nTown eight minutes after tho resump-\n\ntion ot the play. After Pratt had fol\n\nlowed suit for North a. string ot singles\n\nwere added by the winning side. Cazaly\n\nwaa coming Into the attacking line,\n\nand was continually taking passes from\n\nthe wing. Ryan left the Held with an\n\ninjuied leg, and was replaced by Els\n\nzole, and Paull who had also left, was\n\nreplaced by Woolhouse. Goals were\n\nadded for North by Pratt and Cazaly,\n\nand D. Hughes shortly before the fin-\n\nish got his boot to the ball in time to\n\nsend it through the goal posts. Three\n\nquarter time scores were:-North Ho-\n\nbart, 10.22 (82); New Town, 7.12 (64).\n\nTho final quarter was uninteresting,\n\nas North's position was never threaten-\n\ned, and the opposition to its attacks I\n\nI was almost negligible. On the half\n\nforward line Jones continued to give a\n\nspectacular display of high marking.\n\nSoon after the resumption he and Mc-\n\nKay goaled, and Woolhouse followed\n\nsuit for New Town. North was playing\n\ndashing football, and Its team work\n\nwas precise. New Town had not re-\n\ncovered from Its third quarter debacle,\n\nand, although Hanlon, Lobdale, and\n\nCannan defended pluckily, it was a for-\n\nlorn game they were playing.' Eiszelo\n\nfrom a free goaled, and Pratt added\n\nanother. Kenna and Huntington, who\n\nhad been transferred to the forward\n\nline, hit the post for New Town, and\n\nD. Hughes from a snap out of a crush\n\nin front goaled. Jones followed ' with\n\nanother for North with a shot on the\n\nboundary line, the final scores being: -\n\nG. B. Pts.\n\nNorth Hobart .. 16 26 -122\n\nNew Town .... 10 16 - 76\n\n. North played at the peak of its form\n\nand there was not player who did not\n\ncontribute his shat1-- to its convincing\n\nwin. Cazaly has never played better\n\nIn Hobart, and lt was his work in the\n\nruck that first swung the game defi-\n\nnitely in North's favour. Ho received\n\ninvaluable support from F. Smith. Dal-\n\nton was brilliant on the wing, and S.\n\nFelmingham and D.. Jones dominated\n\nin tho air. In defence Edwards and\n\nGoggins were outstanding, and of the\n\nothers M. Felmingham, Richardson, L,\n\nSmith, Mills, and Ryan were promin-\n\nent.\n\nThere were few in New Town's ranks\n\nwho showed true form. James roved\n\ncleverly, and Ling played a solid and\n\neffective game In the centre. Hanlon\n\nand Cannan defended strongly, and\n\nScott was tho best In attack. Simpson\n\nLobdale, Martin, Paul, and C. Hughet\n\nwere the best of the others.\n\nTho goal-kfckers were:-North Ho-\n\nbart: Cazaly (3), Pratt (3), Jones. (3)\n\nPye (2), Mills, Aekerley, Dalton, Mc-\n\nKay, and Eiszele. New Town: D\n\nHughes (3), Kenna (2), James (2)\n\nScott, Kean, Woolhouse.\n\nC. Rodwell, of the Victorian League\n\numpired. He allowed the players lati-\n\ntude In tackling an opponent, and gav«\n\na pleasing display.\n\nSECONDS LEAGUE\n\nLEFROY DEFEATS NEW TOWN,\n\nBy defeating New Town oh Saturdas\n\nLefroy is assured of a place in tho fina\n\nthree in tho Seconds League rostei\n\nLefroy led throughout and finisher\n\nstrongly to win by 34 points.

Old Vlrgillans defeat-\n\ned the Friends' School Old Boys by a\n\npoint In tho grand final , of tho Public\n\nSchools' Old Boye' Association at tho St.\n\nVirgil's Colicuó ground at Hobart on\n\nSaturday* With five minutes only In\n\nwhich to piny Friends' «as three coals tn\n\ntho lead, but four succosslvo VirgUlan at-\n\ntacks, lu which Its opponents scarcely\n\nhandled the ball, yielded three coals and\n\na behind, tho winning point being scored\n\njust before the bell rang. t\n\nVlrglllaiiH displayed wonderful opirit\n\nwhen facing au apparently impossible\n\ntusk, and . thoroughly deserved its win.\n\nFor tlie greater part of the match Friends',\n\nseemed, tho superior team, although, ex-\n\ncept In tho carly stages, when lt built up\n\na big. lend, there was little difference be-\n\ntween thc sides. Vlrglllniis' finishing ef-\n\nfort, however, loft Friends' standing. Tho\n\nmatch ? was watched by a fairly large\n\ncrowd. ' ; *\n\nFriends' scored Us first goal within a\n\nminute of tho start, IC. Gourlay punting\n\naccurately. /For a considerable timo.play\n\nfluctuated between the half-back linee,\n\nalthough Berkery, from an out-of-bounds\n\nfree-kick, and Kirkham goaled to -.give\n\nVlrglllans tho lead. Towards tho end of\n\nthe quarter, however, Friends' was far\n\nloo good for the opposing team, and a\n\nseries of attacks brought four goals. F.\n\nand K. Gourlay wore to the fore in each\n\nscoring move, and the brilliant marking\n\nand kicking of tho brothers aroused the\n\ncrowd to gpthuslasm. Twice within a\n\nminute F. Gourlay marked on the half\n\nforward linc, and long drop kicks sent\n\nthe ball Into the goal mouth, where K.\n\nGourlay defeated Kiszelo for thc marks.1\n\nOf Friends' five goals during tho quarter\n\nIC Gourlay kicked four and F.

Friends' owed much to the solid\n\ndefence of Waters, who turned attack\n\nafter attack.\n\nTHRILLING FINISH,\n\nPlay In the third quarter was strenuous,\n\nand neither team was ablo to secure thc\n\nadvantage. Greater accuracy In front of\n\ngoal, however, enabled Vlrglllans -to load\n\nby a point nt three-quarter time. Shirley\n\nand Barker were winning in the ruck for\n\nVlrglllans, and Hooper, on the back, line,\n\nfrequently relieved with groat dash. A\n\nnumber of Friends' players were handi-\n\ncapping their side by falllnn to secure\n\ntheir kick thc resultant penalties proving\n\ncostly In front of goal. F. Gourinv scor-\n\ned two goals with lone kicks, and'Barker\n\nnnd Young replied tor Vlrglllans.

In tho first quarter\n\nFranklin kicked with a light wind, and P.\n\nRooke, from a free-kick, scored Its first\n\ngoal; , Franklin continued to attack, and\n\nin ground play and in the air showed a\n\nmarked superiority, the ball rarely pass-\n\ning'.tlie centre line. Huonville-was 15\n\npoints In arrear at quarter time. With the\n\n.wind, against it In the second quarter,\n\nFranklin again ntlocked, and Fitzmaurice\n\n'gonled. Huonville rallied, and a series of\n\npasses enabled G. Pago to kick Its first\n\ngoal. K. Pago, who was working hard itt\n\nthe Tuck, with a long kick from tho centre\n\nscored another, and Sproule, whoso mark-\n\ning and long kicking was a feature, also\n\ngoaled, and made the seores level. A for-\n\nward move by Franklin resulted In P.\n\nRooke scoring, giving bis loam a six-point\n\nadvantage nt hair-tlmc. ¡\n\nTrio third quarter was very fast, both\n\nsides using their weight and displaying a\n\nregrettable tendency to rough play. Sev-\n\neral players wero cautioned by tho umpire'\n\nand offenders were penalised- In a way that\n\nmaterially affected tho chances of their\n\nsides. -\n\n?Franklin attacked repeatedly, bul its\n\n.kicking was wild. In a Huonvlllo rally\n\nBurrows scored It» only goal of the quar-\n\nter, and lt iaccd a deficit of 21 points ut\n\nthree-quarter lime. Thc last quarter was\n\n? evenly contested for a time.

Longford\n\nwas eliminated from the competition\n\nbefore thc game was played, however,\n\nand the position now is that North\n\nLaunceston and City will contest the\n\nright next Saturday to play Launces-\n\nton for the premiership on the follow-\n\ning Saturday. ,\n\nPREMIERSHIP POINTS.\n\nP.

In addition,\n\nhowever, the fluctuating fortunes of the\n\ngame, in which tho stocks ot North Laun-\n\nceston and Launceston roso: und slumped\n\nwith almost every score, kept tho spec-\n\ntators In a constant slate of excitement.\n\nNorth Launceston, using \"shock tactics,\"\n\nhad tho best.of tho opening stages of thc\n\nfirst three quarters, hud in the third tillar-,\n\nter mudo a great effort, which almost gave\n\nthe side enough lead to ensure victory, but\n\nLaunceston made- it great .. last' quarter\n\noffort. Tho slippery conditions did not\n\nsuit tho weighty North Launceston play-\n\ners, nor thc light fast Launceston men,\n\nbul. Launceston battled so gamely and .at-\n\ntacked so mercilessly that North Launces-\n\nton failed to scoro in tho hist'- term, and\n\nLaunceston relentlessly wore down tho tir-\n\ning opposing players until Kelly, with the\n\ngreatest goal of the match-a punt kick\n\nfrom a crush which must havo travelled\n\n(¡0 yards-gave Launceston its whining\n\nmargin, a. bare two points.\n\nlt was one of. tho hardest and fastest\n\nroster games In recent seasons, and tho\n\ndrizzling vain made the task of the players\n\ndoubly difficult; Had tho weather remain-\n\ned lino for tho whole match, lt would he\n\nhard to say which side would have had thc\n\nadvantage, but both teams adapted them-\n\nselves admirably to, tho conditions, . and\n\nthere was no \"lob-up\" throughout thc\n\ngame. Tho teams were:\n\nLaunceston: L. McAulcy (capt.), R. 13.\n\nWard, L. Kelly, .T. Cuhlll, K. Phlllpots, H.\n\nHanson, lt. Swinton, lt. Cooper. P. Doyle; j\n\n15. WIlllaniB. W. Cahill, AV. Phillips, 13.\n\nWaddle, D. Wheeler. C. Clarke, T. Hanson,\n\nW. Xurquuy, J. Williams, and P; H. Dean\n\n(19th man).\n\nNorth Launceston: H. Cunningham\n\n(capt.), JJ. Russell, L. Healey, P. Snow-\n\nball, C.'Exton,-13. Spencer, .D. Elmer, ll.\n\nThompson, lr. Barnes, E. Lotte, E. Smith,\n\nA. von Schill, R. Summers, C. PalUser, .1.\n\nSankcy, .1. Munro, H. Dixon, F.. Rothwell,\n\nand C. Matthews (13lh man).\n\nEVEN PLAY.\n\nNorth Launceston broke away carly, and\n\nlaunched a few short, sharp attacks, but\n\nWilliams and W. Cahill effectively repulsed.\n\nEarly Launceston onslaughts were mar-\n\nred by tho short passing being overdone,\n\nbut Launceston made position nicely to\n\nallow Phillips to run in from a forward\n\npocket unmolested, and to goal. Munro\n\nat this stage was more than breaking even\n\nwith Cooper on tho grandstand wing, and\n\nClarke, on tho other flank, was launching\n\nattacks In electrical fashion. Play slowed\n\nup considerably, as the paco could not bu\n\nmaintained, and Launceston defended\n\nsolidly for several minutes, until E. Smith\n\nbroke through to goal with ? a snapshot.\n\nThoro was an unusual incident when F.\n\nBarnes was hit by tho hall on tho buck,ot\n\nthe nock, und was attended ^y tho train-\n\ners. Tho 19th man, C. Matthews, went on\n\ntho Held, and there was a roar ot protest\n\nfrom tho crowd, which had not realised\n\nthat in tho interim Sankey had gone otc\n\nwith, a cut over an eye.. Though North\n\nLaunceston was prevailing in tho air,\n\nLaunceston systematically attacked with\n\nlow passes, and ll. Hanson raced tho flying\n\npack to tho goal to score six points. Scores:\n\nLaunceston, 2.4 (IC points) ; North Laun-\n\nceston,'2.4-(10 points).\n\nNorth Launceston recommenced Hs\n\nshock Indies of tho opening stages ot tho\n\nfirst quarter In an endeavour to rattle its\n\nopponents, and' a goal was rushed before\n\nLaunceston settled down, Thompson scor-\n\ning after being freed In front. North Laun-\n\nceston continued to attack, and there wore\n\ntierce scrimmages In .-front of the Launces-\n\nton goal. Interference with Swinton on thu\n\nback-line, however, gave tho defenders n\n\nrespite, and Ward ran out. to meot tho\n\nforward move, and pounded down on tho\n\nforward Uno lo score with a long shot. A\n\nslight drízalo «ct in, and soon thc ball-was\n\ndifficult to handle, but Thompson held a\n\nsplendid, mark when he soared over tho\n\nLaunceston defenders and scored his tlih'd\n\n.goal. Spencer sped round tho wing, and\n\nforced his way goalwards, leaving a trail\n\nof Launceston defenders in his path till he\n\nwas brought lo earth 20 \"yards from goal\n\nwith a true Rugby tackle. Ho kicked in-\n\naccurately, however, and only a single was\n\nhoisted. Launceston had. to'defend hard\n\nthroughout the quarter, and onlr'the con-\n\ngested play prevented North from scor-\n\ning. Eventually play was transferred to-\n\nwards Launceston's goals so quickly ; that\n\nplay did not have time to become crowd-\n\ned, and Elmer led out to mark and goal,\n\ngiving his side tho lead. Scores: ' North\n\nLaunceston 4.10 (34); Launceston, 4.5 (20).\n\nVIGOROUS LAST HALF.\n\nThe weight of North Launceston was\n\nbeating the pace of Launceston, and by\n\ncrowding the play North Launceston was\n\neffectively throwing a. spanner into tho\n\nLaunceston machinery. Lotte took a grund\n\nmark at an acute anglo near Launceston's\n\ngoal, passed out to Thompson, and North\n\nLauncoston's fifth goal was registered.\n\nLaunceston was quick lo take advantage of\n\nthe open field at the bounce, and smartly\n\nforwarded, where H. Hanson won an In-\n\nteresting duel with If. Russell, und seónxl\n\na rather lucky goal. Launceston main-\n\ntained the pace, and again asserted Its\n\nascendancy when Kelly Unshed tho ball\n\ngoalwards once more, and Swinton ran\n\ninto an unguarded goalmouth .to score, giv-\n\ning North an advantage of but a single\n\npoint. Tho pace wns hot, and reminiscent\n\nof tho fierce opening. No quarter was\n\ngiven in tho crushes, and sheer weight,\n\ncoupled with splendid position play, en-\n\nabled von Schill (twice) and E. Smith to\n\nscore, and give North Launceston a com-\n\nfortable lead ot ID points. North Launces-\n\nton's successes had the Launceston players\n\nrattled, the three goals being invaluable in\n\na game which had hitherto been featured\n\nby lean scoring. Launceston attacked des-\n\nperately, and H. Raiisou scored another\n\nremarkable goal. Finding himself hemmed\n\nin, with lils buck to the goal, he scored\n\nfull points with a shot over his head In\n\nthc manner In which Funner scored for\n\nSouth Aiislrallu'.al the recent football car-\n\nnival. Ranson marked again just before\n\ntho bell, but kicked wretchedly, tho bal!\n\ngoing out. of bounds. Scores: North Laun-\n\nceston S.14 (02) : Launceston, 7.G (4S).\n\nNorth Launceston'» tactics did not suc-\n\nceed In the last tenn ns in Hie opening\n\nslagos ot previous quarters, and after u.\n\nscries of fruitless attacks, Waddle broke\n\nthrough to goal for Launceston, placing his\n\nside within a- goal of tho lcadet'B. Point\n\nby point Launceston bridged tho gap.\n\nNorth Launceston 'reshuffled positions, in\n\na desperate endeavour to retain the lessen-\n\ning advantage. Dean replaced Phlllpots on\n\nthe Launceston back-lino when lhere wore\n\neight minutes to go. Tho slippory ball led\n\nto Launceston making muny costly mis-\n\ntakes when In an advantageous position.\n\nTho players were throwing everything\n\nthey knew into tho game, and the pace on\n\nsuch a slippery oval was terrific. When\n\nNorth Launceston frequently forced the\n\nbrill out of bounds on the score box wing.\n\nLaunceston got tho desired break, .and\n\nlhere was a great roar from tho crowd\n\nwhen Kelly steered through the strong\n\nNorth Launceston defence to goal with a\n\ntremendous kick and give Launceston a\n\nvaluable two point advantage. ' Two\n\nminutes remained, but tho Launceston de-\n\nfence stood up to tho fierce North Laun-\n\nceston onslaughts. The final scores were:\n\nG. B. Pts.\n\nLaunceston. 9 10 - 64\n\nNorth Launceston .. 8 14 - 62\n\nLaunceston played well as a leain, and\n\nit would be difficult lo select tho outstand-\n\ning player. Wheeler and Ward bore tho\n\nbrunt of the heavy work In tho packs lu\n\ncommendable style, whilst AV. Cahill again\n\ndominated the defence, und was well back-\n\ned up by Swinton, E. Williams, McAuley,\n\nand T. nanson. Kelly, Cooper, and Clarke\n\nwere un effcctlvo trio across tho centre,\n\nwhilst H. Ranson, Phillips, ,1.
