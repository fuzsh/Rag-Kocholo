The frailties that undermined Arsene Wenger’s latter years continue to blight Unai Emery’s Arsenal; the Gunners’ porous defence remains and Emery went on record ahead of the window to say he would have liked to sign a centre-half to bolster his side’s quest to return to the Champions League. It was then revealed there was no cash available to make permanent signings.\n\nSo, a side top heavy with creative midfielders, signed Denis Suarez - a creative midfielder who is no discernable upgrade on what they already have; this while injuries ruled out Hector Bellerin, Sokratis and Laurent Koscielny. Baffling.\n\nEmile Smith Rowe potentially getting experience abroad marginally redeems the whole shambles.\n\nIns:\n\nDenis Suarez (Barcelona, loan)\n\nOuts\n\nEmiliano Martinez (Reading, loan)\n\nEmile Smith Rowe (RB Leipzig, loan)\n\nTotal spend: £0\n\nNet spend: £0\n\nGrade: E\n\n---\n\nBOURNEMOUTH\n\nA solid January transfer window befitting an established Premier League club, with manager Eddie Howe addressing weaknesses within the squad while also putting in place a succession plan should the sought-after Callum Wilson depart. Nathaniel Clyne provides an experienced, short-term fix to the losses of Simon Francis (cruciate ligament) and Adam Smith (knee cartilage damage) while U-20 World Cup and Golden Ball winner Dominic Solanke provides another option up front.\n\nIn\n\nDominic Solanke (Liverpool, £19m)\n\nNathaniel Clyne (Liverpool, loan)\n\nChris Mepham (Brentford, undisclosed)\n\nKeelan O'Connell (Morton, loan)\n\nOut\n\nJermain Defoe (Rangers, loan)\n\nAlex Dobre (Yeovil Town, loan)\n\nTyrell Hamilton (Salisbury, loan)\n\nJordan Holmes (St Mirren, loan)\n\nCorey Jordan (Eastbourne Borough, loan)\n\nTyrone Mings (Aston Villa, loan)\n\nMarc Pugh (Hull City, loan)\n\nAaron Ramsdale (AFC Wimbledon, loan)\n\nCharlie Seaman (Dundee United, loan)\n\nMatt Worthington (Yeovil Town, free)\n\nTotal spend: £19m\n\nNet spend: £19m\n\nGrade: A-\n\n---\n\nBRIGHTON & HOVE ALBION\n\nBrighton entered the window winter over-reliant on 35-year-old Glenn Murray for goals and exit the window over-reliant on 35-year-old Glenn Murray for goals. The forward has scored 37 per cent of the Seagull's goals this season, hitting 10 goals in 19 starts, leaving him two shy of his best-ever haul in the top flight. However, it is an unsustainable situation, and Chris Hughton's side could be left to rue a lack of a reliable back-up striker come season's end should Murray's output dip.\n\nTheir three signings this window appear to be a nod to the future with all three immediately loaned back - while this is prudent, Brighton have stood still as teams around them reinforced.\n\nGlenn Murray rejoined Brighton in 2016\n\nImage credit: PA Sport\n\nIn\n\nAlexis Mac Allister (Argentinos Juniors, £7m)\n\nJan Mlakar (NK Maribor, undisclosed)\n\nTudor-Cristian Baluta (Viitorul Constanta, undisclosed)\n\nOut\n\nAlexis Mac Allister (Argentinos Juniors, loan)\n\nJordan Maguire-Drew (Leyton Orient, undisclosed)\n\nBen White (Peterborough United, loan)\n\nBen Barclay (Notts County, loan)\n\nOliver Norwood (undisclosed, Sheffield United, undisclosed)\n\nGeorge Cox (Northampton Town, loan)\n\nMarkus Suttner (Fortuna Dusseldorf, loan)\n\nJosh Kerr (Derry City, loan)\n\nAnders Dreyer (St Mirren, loan)\n\nJan Mlakar (NK Maribor, loan)\n\nTudor-Cristian Baluta (Viitorul Constanta, loan)\n\nTotal spend: £7m\n\nNet spend: £7m\n\nGrade: D\n\n---\n\nBURNLEY\n\nBurnley's prospects of extending their Premier League status beyond 2019 looked bleak as the window opened.\n\nHowever, the return to the team of Tom Heaton has seen the Clarets begin the year with a five-game unbeaten run, with Sean Dyche’s team having conceded four goals in those five games after being breached 41 times in the previous 19. However, Burnley's toils at the other end of the pitch continue, where they have scored just 25 goals in 24 games.\n\nWith their defensive deficiencies seemingly addressed, more firepower became the priority as the window progressed. However, whether the acquisition of 38-year-old Peter Crouch represents firepower is open to question but he should give the Turf Moor club another dimension in attack.\n\nIn\n\nPeter Crouch (free, Stoke City)\n\nOut\n\nJimmy Dunne (Sunderland), loan)\n\nAli Koiki (Swindon Town, loan)\n\nNtumba Massanka (RWD Molenbeek, loan)\n\nGeorge McMahon (Ashton United), loan)\n\nConor Mitchell (Linfield, loan)\n\nSam Vokes (£7 million, Stoke City)\n\nTotal spend: £0m\n\nNet spend: -£7m\n\nGrade: C\n\n---\n\nCARDIFF CITY\n\nNeil Warnock identified and addressed Cardiff's biggest weakness: a chronic lack of goals. Jordon Mutch remains the club's all-time Premier League top scorer with seven. The Bluebirds signed Oumar Niasse on loan from Everton and Emiliano Sala from Nantes for £15 million to address a goal tally that sits at 20 after 24 games. However, the importance of transfer window acumen pales into insignificance when placed alongside the circumstances surrounding Sala's disappearance.\n\nIn\n\nOumar Niasse (Everton, loan)\n\nEmiliano Sala (Nantes, £15m)\n\nLeandro Bacuna (Reading, £3m)\n\nOut\n\nOmar Bogle (Portsmouth, loan)\n\nCiaron Brown (Livingston, loan)\n\nMark Harris (Port Vale, loan)\n\nGary Madine (Sheffield United, loan)\n\nPaul McKay (Morecambe, loan)\n\nAnthony Pilkington (released)\n\nLee Tomlin (Peterborough, loan)\n\nTotal spend: £0m\n\nNet spend: £18m\n\nGrade: C\n\n---\n\nCHELSEA\n\nChelsea needed a new striker and they got one. Whether a 31-year-old with no experience of the league is the answer remains to be seen. Gonzalo Higuain has the pedigree and an excellent relationship with Chelsea boss Maurizio Sarri but there are doubts whether the Argentine, a penalty box striker reliant on service, fits a team who play with inverted wingers. The success of Higuain will make or break Sarri's first season - but his league debut, a four-goal thrashing by Bournemouth, was hardly cause for optimism.\n\nAlthough on January's ledger, £58m acquisition Christian Pulisic is set to arrive in the summer, but his arrival has already had ramifications with Callum Hudson-Odoi reportedly set on leaving the club.\n\nIn\n\nChristian Pulisic (Borussia Dortmund, £58m)\n\nGonzalo Higuain (Juventus, loan)\n\nGonzalo Higuain\n\nImage credit: Getty Images\n\nOut\n\nLewis Baker (Reading, loan)\n\nCesc Fabregas (Monaco, £8.6m)\n\nJosh Grant (Yeovil Town, loan)\n\nMatt Miazga (Reading, loan)\n\nVictor Moses (Fenerbahce, loan)\n\nChristian Pulisic (Borussia Dortmund, loan)\n\nKasey Palmer (Bristol City, loan)\n\nKarlo Ziger (Sutton United, loan)\n\nAlvaro Morata (Atletico Madrid, loan)\n\nLucas Piazon (Chievo, loan)\n\nTotal spend: £58m\n\nNet spend: £49.4m\n\nGrade: C+\n\n---\n\nCRYSTAL PALACE\n\nThe signing of former player Bakary Sako adds depth to their attack but a player who turned out just five times for Championship side West Brom since moving there on a free in October is unlikely to lessen the over-reliance on Wilfried Zaha. Luka Milivojevic - with six goals - remains the club's stop scorer but reliable scorers are hard to come by in the January window, particularly when finances are hamstrung by Europe's 17th largest wage bill. Roy Hodgson got a deal over the line for Michy Batshuayi late in the window but his stock has fallen dramatically after a fruitless spell with Valencia.\n\nGoalkeeper Lucas Perri signed on loan from Sao Paulo provides a short-term fix to the injuries suffered by Vicente Guaita and Wayne Hennessey.\n\nIn\n\nLucas Perri (Sao Paulo, loan)\n\nBakary Sako (West Brom, free)\n\nMichy Batshuayi (Chelsea, loan)\n\nOut\n\nJoseph Hungbo (Margate, loan)\n\nSullay Kaikai (Breda, undisclosed)\n\nNya Kirby (Blackpool, loan)\n\nJordon Mutch (released)\n\nJason Puncheon (Huddersfield Town, loan)\n\nAlexander Sorloth (KAA Gent, loan)\n\nOliver Webber (Greenwich Borough, loan)\n\nJonny Williams (Charlton, undisclosed)\n\nTotal spend: £0\n\nNet spend: £0\n\nGrade: C\n\n---\n\nEVERTON\n\nEverton boss Marco Silva prefers a 4-2-3-1 set up, which makes sense considering how laden his squad is with creative, attacking midfield players. However, with a back four that contains Seamus Coleman, Lucas Digne and Michael Keane, the two in front of the back four must be mobile, tactically astute and capable to dictate from deep.\n\nSilva only really has Idrissa Gueye capable of performing that role. The Toffees are a far inferior side when the Senagalese star is absent from the team but were unable to add another player to compliment the former Villa star. A poor window, but it could have been far worse had PSG - who showed concrete interest late in the window - managed to prise the 29-year-old from Goodison.\n\nIdrissa Gueye\n\nImage credit: PA Sport\n\nIn\n\nN/A\n\nOut\n\nKieran Dowell (Sheffield Utd, loan)\n\nMason Holgate (West Brom, loan\n\nShayne Lavery (Falkirk, loan)\n\nOumar Niasse (Cardiff City, loan)\n\nCuco Martina (Feyenoord, loan)\n\nBeni Baningime (Wigan Athletic, loan)\n\nCallum Connolly (Bolton, loan)\n\nAntony Evans (Blackpool, loan)\n\nYannick Bolasie (Anderlecht, loan)\n\nTotal spend: £0\n\nNet spend: £0\n\nGrade: E\n\n---\n\nFULHAM\n\nFulham are still realising the consequences of a summer transfer policy based more around luck than judgement. They were in desperate need of shoring up a defence that has now shipped 53 goals already this season and were six points adrift of safety as the window shut.\n\nHowever, there is a suspicion that the club are already preparing for a return to the Championship with mooted moves for Danny Drinkwater and Gary Cahill not coming to fruition while Ryan Babel and Havard Nordtveit signed on a low-risk, short-term deals.\n\nIn\n\nRyan Babel (Besiktas, undisclosed)\n\nHavard Nordtveit (Hoffenheim, loan)\n\nLazar Markovic (Liverpool, free)\n\nOut\n\nStephen Humphrys (Southend, undisclosed)\n\nStefan Johansen (West Brom, loan)\n\nAboubakar Kamara (Yeni Malatyaspor, loan)\n\nTotal spend: £0\n\nNet spend: £0\n\nGrade: D\n\n---\n\nHUDDERSFIELD TOWN\n\nHuddersfield have scored 13 goals all season in the league. 13 goals. Karlan Grant, signed from Charlton, should help in that area but the Terriers are 12 points adrift at the foot of the table. The signings of England U19 left-back Jaden Brown and Jason Puncheon may prove astute in the longer term but are unlikely to spark a great escape. Truth be told, the Terriers are down so any transfer splurge would have been in vain; therefore, allowing new manager Jan Siewert the remainder of the season to assess his squad and plan accordingly represents a common-sense strategy.\n\nIn\n\nJaden Brown (Spurs, undisclosed)\n\nJason Puncheon (Crystal Palace, loan)\n\nKarlan Grant (Charlton Athletic, £2m)\n\nOut\n\nJaden Brown (Exeter City, loan)\n\nCollin Quaner (Ipswich Town, loan)\n\nRyan Schofield (Notts County, loan)\n\nRamadan Sobhi (Al Ahly, loan)\n\nRajiv van La Parra (Middlesbrough, loan)\n\nTotal spend: £2m\n\nNet spend: -£2m\n\nGrade: D\n\n---\n\nLEICESTER CITY\n\nThe Foxes are a comfortable mid-table Premier League team with an emerging young core led by Wilfred Ndidi, Ben Chilwell, and James Maddison, complemented by Hamza Choudhury, Demarai Gray and Harvey Barnes. Therefore, with the January transfer window notorious for lacking value, the Leicester club's decision to move on fringe players - and cut their wage bill - while bringing in the highly-rated Youri Tielemans on loan saw the club improve their squad while also turning a profit.\n\nLeicester City unveil new loan signing Youri Tielemans at King Power Stadium on January 31st , 2019 in Leicester, United Kingdom.\n\nImage credit: Getty Images\n\nIn:\n\nYouri Tielemans, (Monaco, loan)\n\nOut:\n\nCallum Elder (Ipswich Town, loan)\n\nYohan Benalouane (Nottingham Forest, undisclosed)\n\nFousseni Diabate (Sivasspor, loan)\n\nVicente Iborra (Villarreal, £9m)\n\nDarnell Johnson (Hibernian, loan)\n\nAndy King (Derby, loan)\n\nJosh Knight (Peterborough United, loan)\n\nAdrien Silva (Monaco, loan)\n\nTotal spend: £0\n\nNet spend: -£9m\n\nGrade: B\n\n---\n\nLIVERPOOL\n\nThe wisdom of allowing Nathaniel Clyne to leave on loan looks ill advised following injuries to Trent Alexander-Arnold and Joe Gomez, coupled with James Milner's suspension. Yet, that does not represent a long-term issue. However, the sale of Dominic Solanke, who made the sum total of zero Premier League appearances this season, represents excellent business.\n\nIn\n\nN/A\n\nOut\n\nNathaniel Clyne (AFC Bournemouth, loan)\n\nPedro Chirivella (Extremadura UD, loan)\n\nOvie Ejaria (Reading, loan)\n\nDominic Solanke (AFC Bournemouth, £19m)\n\nLiam Miller (Kilmarnock, loan)\n\nLazar Markovic (free, Fulham)\n\nTotal spend: £0\n\nNet spend: -£19m\n\nGrade: C\n\n---\n\nMANCHESTER CITY\n\nHowever, of deeper concern to Pep Guardiola as the window drew to a close was the lack of adequate cover for Fernandinho - two of City's three losses this season in the league have come with the Brazilian absent. The Citizens had been linked with a move for Lyon's Tanguy Ndombele but plumped for the cheaper option of Ante Palaversa before immediately loaning him back to Hajduk Split until 2020 meaning the Fernandinho issue remains unresolved.\n\nIt is remiss in the extreme for a club of City's wealth to have a hole in their squad that glaring.\n\nIn\n\nAnte Palaversa (Hajduk Split, £7m)\n\nKo Itakura (Kawasaki Frontale, undisclosed)\n\nOut\n\nBrahim Diaz (Real Madrid, £15m)\n\nEd Francis (Wolves, undisclosed)\n\nLuke Bolton (Wycombe, loan)\n\nRabbi Matondo (Schalke, £7m)\n\nAnte Palaversa (Hajduk Split, loan)\n\nTotal spend: £22m\n\nNet spend: -£15m\n\nGrade: E\n\n---\n\nMANCHESTER UNITED\n\nVictor Lindelof's renaissance under Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has lessened the urgency for a centre-half but, with all the incumbents having deficiencies, the acquisition of an elite-level centre-half will once again become a priority come the summer. The 'Solskjaer Bounce' has certainly masked a side that still requires an overhaul, but United could struggle to shift big money signings Fred and Alexis Sanchez.\n\nAnthony Martial poses with Caretaker Manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer after signing an extension to his contract at Aon Training Complex on January 31, 2019 in Manchester, England\n\nImage credit: Getty Images\n\nMarouane Fellaini looks set to leave for China but the club have until February 26th to get that deal over the line, and his departure coupled with Anthony Martial's new contract, seems to indicate a recalibration of ideals at the Old Trafford club. However, a season of transition with an interim manager at he helm was never likely to herald a plethora of signings.\n\nIn\n\nN/A\n\nOut\n\nEthan Hamilton (Rochdale, loan)\n\nRegan Poole (Newport, loan)\n\nJoel Pereira (Kortrijk, loan)\n\nRo-Shaun Williams (Shrewsbury Town, undisclosed)\n\nMatty Willock (Crawley, loan)\n\nTotal spend: £0\n\nNet spend: £0\n\nGrade: D\n\n---\n\nNEWCASTLE UNITED\n\nNewcastle United are a Premier League club this season due to the acumen of Rafael Benitez and if they stay up for next season it will largely be down to the Spaniard as well. Having scored a paltry 21 goals in 24 games this season, the Magpies needed a striker but a Sports Direct budget stymied any realistic hope of signing an upgrade on what they had.\n\nHowever, Benitez did get the playmaker this team has desperately needed for a few years now. And in Paraguayan international Miguel Almiron, the Magpies could not have found a better fit for Benitez, for the 24-year-old marries technical excellence with indefatigable workrate. The fee of £21 million, while a club record, could prove a bargain.\n\nIn\n\nMiguel Almiron (Atlanta United, £21m)\n\nAntonio Barreca (Monaco, loan)\n\nOut\n\nLiam Gibson (Accrington, loan)\n\nElias Sorensen (Blackpool, loan)\n\nJamie Sterry (Crewe, loan)\n\nRonaldo Aarons (Sheff Wed, loan)\n\nAchraf Lazaar (Sheff Wed, loan)\n\nJosef Yarney (Chesterfield, loan)\n\nTotal spend: £21m\n\nNet spend: £21m\n\nGrade: B\n\n---\n\nSOUTHAMPTON\n\nThere have been improvements under new boss Ralph Hasenhüttl but the Saints remain light in forward positions. However, the St Mary's hierarchy appear to have learned their lesson from a chastening window 12 months ago, where a panic purchase of Guido Carrillo from Monaco for £20 million bore little fruit.\n\nTherefore, trimming a bloated squad on inflated wages to make room for a summer refit makes sense. The improvement under Hasenhüttl confirms that a squad performing well below its potential under Mark Hughes needs slight personnel adjustments rather than sweeping changes.\n\nRalph Hasenhuttl\n\nImage credit: Getty Images\n\nIn\n\nN/A\n\nOut\n\nSteven Davis (Rangers, loan)\n\nManolo Gabbiadini (Sampdoria, undisclosed)\n\nWesley Hoedt (Celta Vigo, loan)\n\nCedric Soares (Inter Milan, loan)\n\nRyan Seager (Released)\n\nTotal spend: £0\n\nNet spend: £0\n\nGrade: B-\n\n---\n\nTOTTENHAM HOTSPUR\n\nThat's two windows on the bounce with zero additions - a concerning development considering the diminishing number of serviceable midfielders Mauricio Pochettino has at his disposal. However, Tottenham are in a rather unique position of having to prioritise homegrown talent given the fact they that are short in that area. Each Premier League squad of 25 needs eight home grown players, and Tottenham are currently one short.\n\nThat has complicated Spurs' attempts to add to their squad, given the premium put on those players. Regardless, Daniel Levy's inability to get deals done could come back to cost Spurs, particularly considering a resurgent Manchester United are closing in on the top four.\n\nMousa Dembele of Tottenham Hotspur is led off the pitch injured during the Premier League match between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Tottenham Hotspur at Molineux.\n\nImage credit: Eurosport\n\nOn the plus side, getting £11 million for the injury prone Mousa Dembele as he entered the last six months of his deal is some fine work.\n\nIn\n\nN/A\n\nOut\n\nJaden Brown (Huddersfield Town, undisclosed)\n\nMousa Dembele (Guangzhou R&F, £11m)\n\nGeorges-Kevin Nkoudou (Monaco, loan)\n\nKazaiah Sterling (Sunderland, loan)\n\nTotal spend: £0\n\nNet spend: -£11m\n\nGrade: F\n\n---\n\nWATFORD\n\nAny window that passes with Abdoulaye Doucoure still a Watford player must be deemed a success. However, it looks increasingly likely that the 26-year-old will almost certainly leave come the summer, and with the expected windfall from that sale, Watford and Javi Gracia should address their lack of firepower.\n\nThe club were said to be interested in bolstering their attack during the current window, with a move for Daniel Sturridge mooted in some quarters. However, given the 29-year-old will be available for a free in the summer, the Hornets may have elected to wait it out.\n\nJurgen Klopp (L) instructs Liverpool's English striker Daniel Sturridge during the English Premier League football match between Chelsea and Liverpool at Stamford Bridge in London on September 29, 2018.\n\nImage credit: Eurosport\n\nIn\n\nAdam Parkes (Southampton) Undisclosed Details\n\nOut\n\nStefano Okaka (Udinese, loan)\n\nAshley Charles (Barnet, loan)\n\nMichael Folivi (AFC Wimbledon, loan)\n\nRandell Williams (Exeter City, undisclosed)\n\nMarvin Zeegelaar (Udinese, loan)\n\nJerome Sinclair (Oxford United, loan)\n\nBen Wilmot (Udinese, loan)\n\nMarvin Zeegelaar (Udinese, loan)\n\nTotal spend: £0\n\nNet spend: £0\n\nGrade: B\n\n---\n\nWEST HAM UNITED\n\nSigning Declan Rice to a long-term deal in late December - and thus fending off any potential cut-price moves this window - coupled with the addition of Samir Nasri on a short-term deal means the Hammers have played the market fairly astutely.
