        "text": "EVANSVILLE â€” The Romain Cadillac Evansville Men's City Tournament field is chasing two names after the first round.\n\nCameron Weyer and Peyton Blackard are the co-leaders following 7-under 63s on Saturday at Fendrich. There were 27 players under par in the opening round. The second round is Sunday at Helfrich with the top 40 and ties, currently 1-over, advancing to next weekend.\n\nWeyer, who played collegiately at Evansville, had nine birdies in his opening round. Following a bogey at 10, he made the turn in 31 with five birdies in a six-hole stretch. Weyer recovered from a bogey at 8 with a birdie inside five feet at 9.\n\nMore: Bosse High School graduate awarded $45K Dan Scism Scholarship\n\n\"I was hitting it inside 10 feet on almost every single hole,\" said Weyer. \"I've played a lot of golf this summer. I knew coming into the City a big goal of mine is to finally win this thing. Helfrich will be tougher, but it's the same thing. Make a lot of pars and if I make a few birdies, it would be fantastic.\"\n\nBlackard had the low round in the morning with one of the better closing nines you'll see. The Gibson Southern senior bogeyed two of his first six holes before shooting a 29 on the front side after starting on 10. Blackard had five birdies and one eagle, a chip in at the par-4 third, over his final 10 holes.\n\n\"Everything was clicking on that nine,\" said Blackard. \"I feel like I had more confidence with my overall game this year. If I could hit my driver well here, I knew I could probably score pretty well if my wedges were like they normally are. It was a good all-around day.\"\n\nThomas Broshears is one shot back after a bogey-free 64 followed by Chase Emge and Brody Sorrell at 5-under.
