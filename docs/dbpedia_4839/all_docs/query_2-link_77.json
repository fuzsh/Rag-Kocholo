In 1888 New Zealand Natives was one of the country’s maiden national rugby sides, playing Hawke's Bay in their first ever match on June 23, with the Natives winning 5-0. Later that year they would play their initial international side, recording their first national win 13-4 when beating Ireland in Dublin.\n\nThe Māori All Blacks is a historic team representing the proud culture of New Zealand.
