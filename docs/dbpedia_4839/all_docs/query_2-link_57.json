        "text": "Two Hautapu Sports players have been named in the Maori All Blacks squad to play two matches against a Japan XV.\n\nProp Ollie Norris (24) and lock Laghlan McWhannell (25) have been selected for the 28-player squad, with McWhannell making the Maori All Blacks for the first time.\n\nMain photo: Ollie Norris (left) and Laghlan McWhannell.\n\nAfter playing loosehead prop for Hautapu Sports, Norris made his name with the Chiefs, making his Super Rugby debut against the Crusaders in 2020.\n\nNorris was a member of the wider New Zealand U-20 team in 2018 and was called up to travel to France for the closing match of the World Rugby U-20 Championship.\n\nBorn in Sydney, Norris went to St Peter’s, Cambridge, and was a member of their first XV that won the National Co-Ed title. He also previously represented New Zealand in the 2017 Barbarians Schools team.\n\nIn 2021, Norris was first named in the Māori All Blacks squad and made his debut against Manu Samoa on July 3, 2021.\n\nCambridge-born McWhannell is another player to emerge from St Peter’s, Cambridge, playing his club rugby for Hautapu.\n\nIn 2018, he won selection to the New Zealand U-20 team, and won selection for Waikato’s provincial rugby squad.\n\nIn 2019, McWhannell won the country’s top award for personal development awarded by the New Zealand Rugby Players Association (NZRPA).\n\nThe lock made his Chiefs debut in 2022 after injuries in 2020 and 2021 sidelined him. He joined the Auckland Blues in 2024.\n\nNew Zealand Māori Rugby Board chair Dame Farah Palmer said: “The Māori All Blacks serve a greater purpose than rugby. We want Māori to be successful as Māori and to pursue excellence. We are immensely proud and excited to support the players in this campaign.”\n\nMaori All Blacks squad\n\n*denotes new caps\n\nProps\n\nBenet Kumeroa* (Te Atihaunui a Paparangi/Bay of Plenty/Hurricanes)\n\nJoe Moody (Ngai Tahu/Canterbury/Crusaders)\n\nMarcel Renata (Ngati Whanaunga, Ngai Takoto/Auckland/Blues)\n\nOllie Norris (Ngapuhi/Waikato/Chiefs)\n\nPouri Rakete-Stones (Ngapuhi/Hawke’s Bay/Hurricanes)\n\nHookers\n\nKurt Eklund (Ngati Kahu/Bay of Plenty/Blues)\n\nTyrone Thompson (Ngati Kahungunu/Chiefs)\n\nLocks\n\nIsaia Walker-Leawere (Ngati Porou/Hawke’s Bay/Hurricanes)\n\nLaghlan McWhannell* (Ngati Kahungunu/Waikato/Blues)\n\nMax Hicks (Ngati Ranginui/Tasman/Highlanders)\n\nTahlor Cahill* (Ngapuhi/Canterbury/Crusaders)\n\nLoose forwards\n\nBilly Harmon (Ngai Tahu/Canterbury/Highlanders)\n\nCameron Suafoa (Ngapuhi/North Harbour/Blues)\n\nCullen Grace (Ngati Whakaue/Canterbury/Crusaders)\n\nNikora Broughton* (Nga Rauru, Ngati Ruanui/Bay of Plenty/Highlanders)\n\nTe Kamaka Howden (Tuhoe/Manawatu/Hurricanes)\n\nHalf backs\n\nSam Nock (Ngapuhi/Northland/Blues)\n\nTe Toiroa Tahuriorangi (Ngati Rangitihi, Ngati Pikiao, Tuhourangi, Ngati Whakaue, Ngati Awa/Bay of Plenty/Chiefs)\n\nFirst five-eighths\n\nRivez Reihana* (Ngai Tahu, Ngati Hine, Ngapuhi, Ngati Tuwharetoa/Northland/Crusaders)\n\nTaha Kemara* (Te Whanau a Apanui, Te Whakatohea/Waikato/Crusaders)\n\nMidfield\n\nBailyn Sullivan (Ngati Kahungunu/Waikato/Hurricanes)\n\nCorey Evans* (Te Aupouri, Ngati Kahu/Northland/Blues)\n\nDaniel Rona* (Te Atiawa/Taranaki/Chiefs)\n\nRameka Poihipi (Ngati Whakaue/Canterbury/Chiefs)\n\nQuinn Tupaea (Ngaati Tiipa, Ngaati Amaru, Waikato/Waikato/Chiefs)\n\nOutside backs\n\nCole Forbes* (Ngati Awa/Bay of Plenty/Blues)\n\nJosh Moorby (Ngati Maniapoto/Waikato/Hurricanes)\n\nTana Tuhakaraina* (Ngati Haua/Waikato/Chiefs)\n\nUnavailable for selection due to injury:\n\nManaaki Selby-Rickit (Ngati Raukawa)\n\nShaun Stevenson (Ngapuhi)\n\nJared Profitt (Ngati Porou)\n\nFixtures\n\nGame to be played on Saturday June 29, 2024\n\nMaori All Blacks v Japan XV\n\nChichibunomiya Rugby Stadium, Tokyo, 10pm (NZT)\n\nGame to be played on Saturday July 6, 2024\n\nMaori All Blacks v Japan XV\n\nToyota Stadium, Toyota, 9pm (NZT)\n\nHautapu Sports’ Roll of Honour\n\nClick here for our club’s Roll of Honour >>>>\n\nOur sponsors\n\nWhat’s happening at your club"
