We would encourage our members to join the campaign. All you have to do is grab a pen and a piece of paper and write the message - Who am I to judge? #tacklehomophobia and post it on your Twitter and Facebook pages. The more players who support the campaign, the further the message will travel.\"\n\n@FIFPro @NISO_sport"
