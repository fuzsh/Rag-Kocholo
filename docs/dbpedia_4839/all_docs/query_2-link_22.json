        "text": "Deveire, an Irish IT business supporting multinational companies, is preparing to bring its insurance portal product to the USA\n\nDeveire Founder and CEO, Ollie Cahill, creatively blended the abbreviation for “development” with the Irish word for Ireland, “Eire,” to form the name of his company – Deveire. The Limerick-based information technology company has supported world-leading companies for more than a decade. While the company built its reputation by offering web and software development services to its clients, it is also gearing up for the USA launch of its own product in the insurance sector.\n\nLike many of the most successful technology companies native to Ireland, Deveire is effectively invisible to most people, but it plays a vital role behind the scenes. Over the years, Deveire has worked with countless high-profile clients, including multiple Fortune 500 companies – an accomplishment based largely on positive word of mouth from satisfied customers. Some of the services it offers to clients are web development and managed services, systems architecture and development, platform consulting and implementation services.\n\nNotably for the last eight years, Deveire has been an implementation partner for Brightspot and their Content Business Platform. This partnership has provided services to the likes of Walmart, Johnson & Johnson, Hallmark Channel, and many other market leaders. Currently over 90 percent of Deveire’s clients are US-based.\n\nCahill, stated, “We are a high-tech solution provider for when companies’ internal teams face unexpected complex problems and need an outsider’s perspective on the best way to tackle the challenge. If businesses hit a wall with platform solutions, technology solutions, or when they go out of their comfort zone on replatforming, we can help them get back on track. Our value lies in our history of continuously delivering in that space.”\n\nIn 2021, Deveire is working to take a few steps out of its own comfort zone. Recently, it teamed up with Enterprise Ireland to create a commercial insurance portal for the Irish Insurance Industry, built on Deveire’s Databots360 engine. This product soon gained traction locally to the point of being used by 60 percent of brokers in Ireland. First, a company in the UK brought the portal to the British market, and now, investors from the USA aim to take Deveire’s insurance portal across the Atlantic.\n\nCahill described the present as a “very anxious and exciting time” for Deveire. The company is hard at work shoring up its skillset to support the insurance portal. Additionally, Deveire is planning for a seven-figure R&D investment into its insurance product line next year.\n\nDeveire’s head office is located in National Technology Park, Limerick. Along with Deveire, the 650-acre park houses facilities for many other multinationals and Irish-based companies, including Cook Medical, and Johnson & Johnson – and they all benefit from being adjacent to the University of Limerick. According to Cahill, being based in the technology park has proven “invaluable” to Deveire, both in terms of its location and the talent pool it provides.\n\nWhen questioned about being based in Limerick, Cahill added, “Today, companies are not just looking at outsourcing to Ireland for low tax rates. Ireland as a whole and Limerick in particular, have executives and management teams who have been competing with the best the world has to offer for up to 40 years, and they can add a great deal of value to businesses.”"
