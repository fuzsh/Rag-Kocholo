        "text": "Mr XSenior Writer I\n\nJanuary Transfer Window: Complete Transfer List with Key Transfers Assessed\n\n0 of 18\n\nWhile the January transfer window may be nowhere near as compelling, exciting or as interesting as the summer transfer window, it is undoubtedly one of the most important parts of the season.\n\nStruggling teams are given a second chance to put records straight, while clubs with ambitions of winning trophies can really make a huge statement by either taking key players from rivals or by signing that one player who may turn out to be the one who gets them over the finishing line.\n\nHere, we take a quick look at every single transfer and offer some analysis on what could be the key moves this winter, or indeed this season.\n\nJanuary 1: Key Transfer Nicolas Anelka: Chelsea to Shanghai Shenhua\n\n1 of 18\n\nThe January transfer window opened with a bang, as the oft-controversial French striker, Nicolas Anelka, completed a move from title-chasing Chelsea to new-world wonders Shanghai Shenhua.\n\nThe forward, frozen out of first-team affairs by Andre Villa Boas, chose to go to China instead of staying in the Premier League, where he would easily have commanded a place with practically any side in the division.\n\nOn further introspection, it was revealed that the French ex-international, who was banned by his home federation for 18 games for his part in the insurrection against Raymond Domenech during the last World Cup, was going to claim somewhere in the region of £175,000 per week for the duration of his time in China, almost double his take-home pay at Chelsea.\n\nPremier League\n\nDavid Button (Tottenham - Doncaster): Loan\n\nAndros Townsend (Tottenham - Leeds): Loan\n\nDanny Wilson (Liverpool - Blackpool): Loan\n\nNicolas Anelka (Chelsea - Shanghai Shenhua): Undisclosed Fee\n\nEmmanuel Frimpong (Arsenal -

The 22-year-old joined Villa in 2009 and was at one stage rated as the best young wide player in the country.\n\nSince then, he has enjoyed a miserable time a Villa Park and has only played 25 games for the Villains over the last three years. Alex McLeish will obviously be hoping that this loan move back to the Championship re-ignites the obvious latent talent within the youngster, but that remains to be seen.\n\nPremier League\n\nSam Walker (Chelsea - Yeovil): Loan\n\nDaniel Boateng (Arsenal - Swindon): Loan\n\nFabian Delph (Aston Villa - Leeds United): Loan\n\nNathan Delfouneso (Aston Villa - Leicester City): Loan\n\nDanny Drinkwater (Manchester United - Leicester City): Undisclosed\n\nTom Soares (Stoke - Hibernian): Loan\n\nFootball League and SPL\n\nKelvin Etuhu (Unattached - Portsmouth)\n\nDavid Gonzalez (Unattached - Brighton)\n\nJamie McAllister (Bristol City - Preston): Loan\n\nAndy Procter (Accrington - Preston): Loan\n\nGavin Massey (Watford - Colchester United): Loan\n\nRonan Murray (Ipswich - Swindon): Loan\n\nDeane Smalley (Oxford - Bradford): Loan\n\nKelly Youga (Unattached - Yeovil)\n\nBen Dickenson (Dorchester - Brighton): Undisclosed\n\nChris Holroyd (Rotherham - Preston): Undisclosed\n\nOli Johnson (Unattached - Oxford)\n\nGuy Madjo (Stevenage - Aldershot): Undisclosed\n\nDwayne Mattis (Chesterfield - Macclesfield): Free\n\nJermaine McGlashan (Aldershot - Cheltenham): Undisclosed\n\nJosh McQuoid (Millwall - Burnley): Loan\n\nChris Weale (Leicester - Northampton): Loan\n\nRabiu Ibrahim (PSV Eindhoven - Celtic): Free\n\nJames McPake (Coventry - Hibernian): Loan\n\nMervan Celik (GAIS - Rangers)\n\nLee Croft (Derby - St Johnstone): Loan\n\nJohn Fleck (Rangers - Blackpool): Loan\n\nJanuary 24: Key Transfer: Taye Taiwo: AC Milan to QPR on Loan\n\n9 of 18\n\nQPR and Mark Hughes pulled off the first major coup of the transfer window when they secured the signing of Taye Taiwo from AC Milan for the rest of the season with an option to buy him for £3.5 million in the summer.\n\nThe highly-rated Nigerian international was chased by anyone and everyone when AC Milan snapped him up at the start of this season, but a failure to settle in Serie A and Italy means that Mark Hughes may have signed a bargain, and possibly one of the best fullbacks in Europe.\n\nHis signing, rightfully, outshone the capture of Nedum Onuoha from Manchester City. However, given the youngster's potential, it looks as if Hughes has signed a possible England, or Nigerian, star of the future from his old club.\n\nPremier League\n\nTaye Taiwo [AC Milan - QPR]: Loan\n\nNedum Onuoha [Manchester City - QPR]: Undisclosed\n\nMichael Tonge [Stoke - Barnsley]: Loan\n\nJean Beausejour [Birmingham - Wigan]: Undisclosed\n\nLee Lucas [Swansea City - Burton Albion]: Loan\n\nTim Ream [New York Red Bulls - Bolton]: £2.5m\n\nJason Roberts [Blackburn - Reading]: Undisclosed\n\nSanchez Watt [Arsenal - Crawley Town]: Loan\n\nFootball League and SPL\n\nJames Harper [Hull City - Wycombe]: Loan\n\nJonny Howson [Leeds - Norwich]: Undisclosed\n\nSean Morrison [Reading - Huddersfield]: Loan\n\nBen Purkiss [Oxford - Hereford]: Free\n\nJack Redshaw [Altrincham - Morecambe]: Undisclosed\n\nTadanari Lee [Sanfrecce Hiroshima - Southampton]: Free\n\nKorey Smith [Norwich City - Barnsley]: Loan\n\nDieter van Tornhout [Unattached - Kilmarnock]\n\nWill Atkinson [Hull - Bradford]: Loan\n\nKieron Cadogan [Crystal Palace - Rotherham]: Loan\n\nTomasz Cywka [Derby - Reading]: Free\n\nAntonio German [unattached - Brentford]\n\nBen Parker [Leeds - Carlisle]: Loan\n\nSolomon Taiwo [Cardiff - Leyton Orient]: Loan\n\nSam Winnall [Wolves - Inverness]: Loan\n\nDieter van Tornhout [Unattached - Kilmarnock]\n\nJanuary 28: Key Transfer: Alex: Chelsea to PSG\n\n10 of 18\n\nChelsea moved their second major player on when Alex chose to join Carlo Ancelotti at the future kings of France, PSG. Bankrolled by Qatari billions the ex-Chelsea boss went back to his old club to sign the Brazilian defender on the cheap.\n\nAndre Villa Boas decision to ostracize the defender was strange considering the Blues defensive frailties, but his replacement, Gary Cahill, is a better option going forward, so all in all, this seems a good piece of business by the Portuguese.\n\nPremier League\n\nAlex (Chelsea - Paris Saint-Germain): £4.5m\n\nRyan Brunt (Stoke - Tranmere): Loan\n\nFlorent Cuvelier (Stoke - Walsall): Loan\n\nNouha Dicko (Wigan - Blackpool): Loan\n\nShane Lowry (Aston Villa - Millwall): Undisclosed\n\nRomaine Sawyers (West Brom - Shrewsbury): Loan\n\nMame Biram Diouf (Manchester United - Hannover 96): Undisclosed\n\nDiniyar Bilyaletdinov (Everton - Spartak Moscow): Undisclosed\n\nFootball League and SPL\n\nJonathan Forte (Southampton - Notts County): Loan\n\nLuke Guttridge (Aldershot - Northampton): Free\n\nKevin Long (Burnley - Rochdale): Loan\n\nAlex Marrow (Crystal Palace - Preston): Loan\n\nMarcus Marshall (Rotherham - Macclesfield): Loan\n\nJordan Obita (Reading - Barnet): Loan\n\nStefan Payne (Gillingham - Aldershot): Free\n\nSteven Leslie (Shrewsbury - Wrexham) Free\n\nRoman Bednar (West Brom - Blackpool): Free\n\nElliot Grandin (Blackpool - Nice): Loan\n\nAlan Smith (Newcastle - MK Dons) Loan\n\nStephen Hughes (unattached - Aberdeen)\n\nJanuary 30: Key Transfer: Danny Ward: Wrexham to Liverpool\n\n11 of 18\n\nWhile Tottenham Hotspur were easily the busiest team in terms of transfers on January 30, with three youngsters going on loan to various levels of the game across Britain, it was Liverpool who pulled off a deal for around £100,000 that could turn out to be the best bit of business Kenny Dalglish has ever pulled off.\n\nThe little-known Welsh youth is rated as one of the best young 'keepers in Britain and joins the Reds after four years in Wrexham's Academy, where he was capped at various levels for his country.\n\nFor Spurs fans, they will want to take note of young Tom Carroll and see how he gets on in the tough and tumble of the Championship. The diminutive midfielder featured in Tottenham's Europa League campaign this year and has been sent to Derby to toughen up. One for the future with Danny Ward.\n\nPremier League\n\nJohn Bostock (Tottenham - Sheffield Wednesday): Loan\n\nTom Carroll (Tottenham - Derby): Loan\n\nKudus Oyenuga (Tottenham - St Johnstone): Loan\n\nSamba Diakite (Nancy - QPR): Loan\n\nAdlene Guedioura (Wolves - Nottingham Forest): Loan\n\nAlex Kacaniklic (Fulham - Watford): Loan\n\nMatthew Lund (Stoke - Bristol Rovers): Loan\n\nRhys Murphy (Arsenal - Preston North End): Loan\n\nJordan Mustoe (Wigan - Barnet): Loan\n\nSam Vokes (Wolves - Brighton): Loan\n\nDanny Ward (Wrexham - Liverpool): Undisclosed\n\nFootball League and SPL\n\nPat Baldwin (Colchester - Southend): Free\n\nScott Golbourne (Exeter City - Barnsley): Undisclosed\n\nKadeem Harris (Wycombe Wanderers - Cardiff City): Undisclosed\n\nDaniel Lafferty (Derry City - Burnley): Undisclosed\n\nKeanu Marsh-Brown (Unattached - Oldham)\n\nWes Morgan (Nottingham Forest - Leicester): Undisclosed\n\nJamie Reckford (Wolves - Scunthorpe United): Loan\n\nBill Sharp (Doncaster - Southampton): Undisclosed\n\nRobbie Simpson (Huddersfield - Oldham): Free\n\nMatt Tubbs (Crawley - Bournemouth): Undisclosed\n\nSam Vokes (Wolves - Brighton): Loan\n\nRyan Stevenson (Hearts - Ipswich): Undisclosed\n\nJuan Manuel Ortiz (Rangers - Almeira): Loan\n\nJames Keatings (Celtic - St Johnstone): Loan\n\nPawel Brozek (Trabzonspor - Celtic): Loan\n\nMilos Lacny (Sparta Prague - Dundee United) Loan\n\nGavin Rae (Dundee - Aberdeen): Undisclosed\n\nLewis Toshney (Celtic - Kilmarnock): Loan\n\nJanuary 31 Part 1: Key Transfer: Bobby Zamora: Fulham to QPR\n\n12 of 18\n\nMark Hughes moved swiftly on transfer deadline day to secure two strikers with Premiership experience as he tries to stave off relegation at QPR.\n\nBobby Zamora and Djibril Cisse have come in and will provide some much-needed strength, pace, penetration, and without doubt, more goals than Rangers have managed so far this season.\n\nHughes was a major factor in Zamora choosing to cross London from Fulham, where the two enjoyed a good relationship before the Welshman resigned, and he will be hoping for a return to form, especially as Euro 2012 is only six months away.\n\nPremier League\n\nBobby Zamora [Fulham - QPR]: Undisclosed\n\nDjibril Cisse [Lazio - QPR]: £4m\n\nMatthew Connolly [QPR - Reading]: Loan\n\nBradley Orr [QPR - Blackburn]: Undisclosed\n\nPavel Pogrebnyak [Stuttgart - Fulham]: Undisclosed\n\nMartin Hansen [Liverpool - Viborg FF]: Undisclosed\n\nMarcus Olsson [Halmstads - Blackburn]: Free\n\nFootball League\n\nNicky Ajose [Peterborough - Chesterfield]: Loan\n\nClarke Carlisle [Burnley - Northampton]: Loan\n\nJanuary 31: Part 2: Key Transfer: Ravel Morrisson: Man United to West Ham Utd\n\n13 of 18\n\nManchester was busier than expected during transfer deadline day, with no less than seven players moving from the red and blue halves of the city for pastures new.\n\nWhile all eyes were on Carlos Tevez and what the errant striker might do next, it was Ravel Morrisson's shock transfer to West Ham that provided the most surprising transfer of the window.\n\nHailed as one of the best young talents ever to come out of Old Trafford, much was expected and hoped of the troubled teen. However, recent contract talks seem to have broken down, and it came as a huge shock to see the youngster packed off to the Championship and West Ham.\n\nMorrisson will go to the Hammers as one of the most highly-rated youngsters in Europe, and if current league standings remain the same, he will be playing against his old club in the Premiership next season.\n\nSam Allardyce is a known friend of Sir Alex Ferguson, and one can read into this transfer what they may, but this deal remains the most surprising of recent times.\n\nPremier League\n\nRavel Morrison [Manchester United - West Ham]: Undisclosed\n\nWayne Bridge [Man City - Sunderland]: Loan\n\nSotirios Kyrgiakos [Wolfsburg - Sunderland]: Loan\n\nRavel Morrison [Manchester United - West Ham]: Undisclosed\n\nOliver Norwood [Manchester United - Coventry]: Loan\n\nDavid Pizarro [Roma - Manchester City]: Loan\n\nFrederic Veselid [Manchester City - Manchester United]: Undisclosed\n\nScott Wootton [Manchester United - Nottingham Forest]: Loan\n\nFootball League\n\nPaul McCallum [West Ham - Rochdale]: Loan\n\nNicky Maynard [Bristol City - West Ham]: Undisclosed\n\nRicardo Vaz Te [Barnsley - West Ham]: Undisclosed\n\nJanuary 31: Part 3: Key Transfer: Nikika Jelavic: Rangers to Everton\n\n14 of 18\n\nTransfers involving Scottish Premier League teams were something of a rarity during this current window, with transfers involving cash proving to be even more illusive.\n\nThat changed on deadline day, when Everton signed Glasgow Rangers' highly-rated Croatian international, Nikica Jelavic, for just £5.5 million.\n\nThe move could prove to be a fantastic piece of business by David Moyes, who has signed a proven international for just a couple of milion. The Scot took full advantage of the Gers recent financial troubles, and it leaves Ally McCoist facing a run in with Celtic without his best player, and most importantly, without a proven striker.\n\nDark days ahead for Rangers, blue skies for Everton.\n\nSPL\n\nNikica Jelavic [Rangers - Everton]: Undisclosed\n\nJordan McMillan [Rangers - Dunfermline]: Undisclosed\n\nJohn Potter [Dunfermline - Queen of the South]: Loan\n\nPaul Slane [Celtic - MK Dons]: Loan\n\nMurray Wallace [Falkirk - Huddersfield]: £300,000\n\nMurray Wallace [Huddersfield - Falkirk]: Loan\n\nKallum Higginbotham [Falkirk - Huddersfield]: Undisclosed\n\nPa Saikou Kujabi [unattached - Hibernian]\n\nJorge Claros [Motagua - Hibernian]: Loan\n\nLee Cox [Inverness - Swindon]: Undisclosed\n\nFootball League\n\nMark Wilson [Doncaster - Oxford]: Free\n\nFabien Robert [FC Lorient - Doncaster]: Loan\n\nJanuary 31: Part 4: Key Transfer: Louis Saha: Everton to Tottenham Hotspur\n\n15 of 18\n\nTransfer deadline day would not be complete without a plethora of comings and goings at White Hart Lane, and this year was no exception.\n\nSix players either came or went for Harry Redknapp's side, with the wily manager snapping up veteran New Zealand international Ryan Nelson from Blackburn for free, while Louis Saha made the trip down south until the end of the season with a view to a permanent move next summer.\n\nThe Saha transfer could be vital for Spurs in the title run with the player, when fit...offering power, pace and very intelligent movement. He will provide Redknapp with another skill set that neither Emmanuel Adebayor nor Jermain Defoe possess.\n\nPremier League\n\nVedran Corluka [Tottenham - Bayer Leverkusen]: Loan\n\nLouis Saha [Everton - Tottenham]: Free\n\nSteven Pienaar (Tottenham - Everton): Loan\n\nRoman Pavlyuchenko (Tottenham - Lokamotiv Moscow): £8 million\n\nAdam Smith [Tottenham - Leeds]: Loan\n\nRyan Nelson (Blackburn - Tottenham): Free\n\nRyo Miyaichi [Arsenal - Bolton]: Loan\n\nFootball League\n\nLewis Wilson [Newport Pagnell Town - Northampton]: Free\n\nMichael Symes [Bournemouth - Rochdale]: Loan\n\nRobbie Gibbons [Unattached - Scunthorpe]\n\nMatty Whichelow [Watford - Wycombe]: Loan\n\nJanuary 31: Part 5: Key Transfer: Liam Ridgewell: Birmingham to West Brom\n\n16 of 18\n\nRoy Hodgson was a busy man on deadline day, as he snapped up Liam Ridgewell and Keith Andrews to boost the Baggies' push towards mid table security.\n\nRidgewell, the 14th player to leave Birmingham since they beat Arsenal in the Carling Cup final last season, will come in and tighten up the defence, while Irish international Andrews will offer strength and consistency in central midfield.\n\nThese moves to strengthen the spine of his team should not be underestimated and should move West Brom away from the relegation zone.\n\nPremier League\n\nLiam Ridgewell [Birmingham - West Brom]: Undisclosed\n\nGonzalo Jara Reyes [West Brom - Brighton]: Loan\n\nJoe Mattock [West Brom - Brighton]: Loan\n\nKeith Andrews [Blackburn - West Brom]: Free\n\nBen Marshall [Stoke - Leicester]: Undisclosed\n\nDanny Higginbotham [Stoke - Nottingham Forest]: Loan\n\nJames Tavernier [Newcastle - MK Dons]: Loan\n\nAndy Keogh [Wolves - Millwall]: Undisclosed\n\nFootball League\n\nMichael Chambers [Dulwich Hamlet - Crystal Palace]: Undisclosed\n\nBilly Clarke [Blackpool - Crawley]: Undisclosed\n\nGraham Cummins [Cork - Preston]: Undisclosed\n\nWill Hoskins [Brighton - Sheffield United]: Loan\n\nNeal Kitson [Rochester Rhinos - Northampton]: Free\n\nAlex MacDonald [Burnley - Plymouth]: Loan\n\nDonal McDermott [Huddersfield - Bournemouth]: Undisclosed\n\nDavid Mirfin [Watford - Scunthorpe]: Loan\n\nCurtis Obeng [Wrexham - Swansea]: Undisclosed\n\nLuke O'Brien [Bradford - Exeter]: Undisclosed\n\nJon Parkin [Cardiff - Scunthorpe]: Loan\n\nChris Robertson [Torquay - Preston]: Undisclosed\n\nJames Tavernier [Newcastle - MK Dons]: Loan\n\nJanuary 31: Part 6: Key Transfer: Kevin De Bruyne: FC Genk to Chelsea\n\n17 of 18\n\nChelsea pulled off two major coups on deadline day, as they signaled their intentions of building for the future by signing two of the most highly-rated young talents in Europe.\n\nEighteen-year-old Patrick Bamford joined the Blues for £1.5 million on a five-year deal after only playing two league games for Nottingham Forest, while Kevin de Bruyne comes in as one of the best young players in Europe from Belgian side Genk.\n\nThe Belgian coaching system is currently one of the best in Europe, with youngsters regularly leaving the Low Counties for pastures new. De Bruyne is an attacking midfielder by trade and has been a regular in the side since 2010 despite him only being 20 this year.\n\nPremier League\n\nPatrick Bamford [Nottingham Forest - Chelsea]: £1.5m\n\nKevin de Bruyne [Genk - Chelsea]: £6.7m\n\nKevin de Bruyne [Chelsea - Genk]: Loan\n\nFootball League\n\nKwesi Appiah [Margate - Crystal Palace]: Undisclosed\n\nStephen Dawson [Leyton Orient - Barnsley]: Undisclosed\n\nBen Harding [Wycombe - Northampton]: Free\n\nKarl Hawley [Notts County - Crawley]: Loan\n\nJim Paterson [Unattached - Bristol Rovers]\n\nJuvhel Tsoumou [Preston - Plymouth]: Loan\n\nScott Rendell [Wycombe - Oxford]: Loan\n\nAnthony McNamee [MK Dons - Wycombe]: Free\n\nTransfer Window: Quick Recap\n\n18 of 18\n\nMark Hughes was the busiest manager during the transfer window, as the newly-appointed QPR manager signed six players for a combined fee of around £12 million.\n\nThe six players in question will easily push Rangers away from the threat of relegation, and given the Welshman's track record, it might be prudent to place a bet on QPR finishing in the top half next season.\n\nSpurs, as ever, were busy also, with Harry Redknapp making two key signings. The most important may turn out to be the capture of 34-year-old veteran Ryan Nelson, with the centre half proving over the last couple of years what a capable defender he is. His age is against him, though, but his experience will be vital.\n\nLiverpool and Arsenal did practically no business between either of them, as a couple of fringe players went on loan from North London. This could prove decisive for both teams, as the race for the last Champions League space hots up.\n\nUnited and City were also conspicuous by their lack of business in the window, with perhaps the most intriguing move being Ravel Morrisson's transfer to West Ham.\n\nChelsea, in trouble in defence and midfield, only invested in the future with the capture of two stars for the future.\n\nGiven the title and relegtion races being what they are, one wonders what might have turned out to be if a chairman like Daniel Levy had perhaps invested a little more heavily like Tony Fernandes at QPR...\n\nAll in all, it was a pretty uninspiring window.\n\nThankfully, we have Jim White to make it sound exciting, though...\n\nX"
