        "text": "Tim Cahill has returned to a strong 23-man Socceroos squad for the World Cup qualifier against Kyrgyzstan.\n\nCahill, goalkeeper Eugene Galekovic and centre-back Matthew Spiranovic return to the Australian camp after missing the recent friendlies against Germany and Macedonia.\n\nAustralia will face Kyrgyzstan on June 16 in Bishtek.\n\n\"We've selected a relatively settled squad made up of the core of players that brought success at the Asian Cup but also the core of players that will take us through to the next World Cup,\" coach Ange Postecoglou said in an FFA statement.\n\nPostecoglou has described the team as \"full strength\", with no uncapped players and 19 of the 23 having featured in the winning Asian Cup campaign.\n\n\"From my perspective, this maybe puts a little bit of a full stop on the great afterglow of the Asian Cup,\" Postecoglou told a news gathering.\n\n\"Now's the time for us to form a strong foundation with this group of players. We're not closing the door on players coming in, they'll still be a part of our thinking going forward.\n\n\"The guys who went through the Asian Cup did fantastically well for us ... [but] no-one's going to be comfortable. The more we cast the net wider and wider, the more depth we've gained and more talent we find.\"\n\nPostecoglou ready for campaign after 'unique introduction'\n\nPostecoglou, who drew plaudits and criticism in equal measure for the Socceroos style of play during the 2014 World Cup, says the 2018 qualifying campaign presents a new opportunity for him.\n\nWith qualifying for the 2014 tournament and the Asian Cup already completed prior to his appointment as Socceroos coach, Postecoglou now has the chance to build his team through to 2018, starting in June against Kyrgyzstan.\n\nHe says the primary goal, other than qualifying for Russia, will be building the team to the best it can possibly be.\n\n\"It's been a unique introduction [for me] to the national team role, with two tournaments I didn't really qualify for,\" he said.\n\n\"I'm looking forward to the challenge of building through the qualification process.\n\n\"From our perspective it's not just about qualification, it's about through this period building a team that's going to be stronger than ever before.\n\n\"I guess my tenure's been unique in that the only meaningful games have been in tournaments.\"\n\nPostecoglou says he will only experiment with the make-up of the team in friendlies, but insists the door is not closed for up-and-coming players.\n\n\"The process of trialing things, experimenting and bringing in players ... I think with these gamess being World Cup qualifiers, we're not going to experiment in those times,\" he said.\n\n\"Now's the time for us to form a strong foundation with this group of players. We're not closing the door on players coming in, they'll still be a part of our thinking going forward.\""
