        "text": "Head Coach Johannes Neethling Gericke leads the USA Men’s U20s into their 2024 campaign next month, as the squad of 32 is named for the annual World Rugby U20s Trophy North American qualifier series against Canada.\n\nFollowing last year’s first U20s Trophy appearance since 2016, the program with returning names and a capped USA Eagle look to repeat and punch their ticket to Scotland. The USA will face off with Canada in a two-match series, on June 1 at Shawnigan Lake School and June 6 at Starlight Stadium in Langford, BC. Kickoff and live stream information will be confirmed shortly.\n\nHead Coach Neethling Gericke said on the player selections, “We are very excited about this group of young men, with a good mix of USA Rugby experience and some new energy to the U20s camp. Throughout the year, the wider group has kept aligned through different touch points, where they have shown dedication to the U20s campaign and earned this opportunity to represent the USA. Now the time has come to showcase what we can do together, I believe we have selected the right group of players to carry this program forward.”\n\nUSA Men’s U20s North American Qualifier Traveling Roster\n\nUSA Men’s U20s North American Qualifier Staff\n\nHead Coach | Johannes Neethling Gericke\n\nAssistant Coach | Elvis Seveali'i\n\nStrength & Conditioning Coach | Matoko Noudehou\n\nTeam Manager | Darran Coleman\n\nTeam Analyst | Luke Richmond\n\nUSA Men’s U20s North American Qualifier Schedule\n\nJune 1, 2024\n\nUSA vs Canada Match One\n\nShawnigan Lake School | Shawnigan Lake, BC\n\nJune 6, 2024\n\nUSA vs Canada Match Two\n\nStarlight Stadium | Langford, BC\n\nSelected from a identified pool of 52 players at or under the age of 20, the full traveling squad will arrive in Bellingham, WA on May 18 for a 10-day training camp at the deWilde Rugby & Polo Fields, before heading to Canada for the qualifier series. Men’s 15s General Manager Scott Lawrence and Pathways Manager Brendan Keane continue to commit assembly time to the core of development players, with new additions in 2024.\n\nOf the 32 selected, 11 return from the 2023 qualifier and Trophy rosters, with six elevated from the 2023 Men’s U18s touring roster in Amsterdam. The remaining half of those names will make their first USA Rugby camp appearance, both from college and club play and seven names invited out to the Winter Camp this past December in North Carolina, also under the tutelage of Gericke. 2023 Captain, Dominic Besag will return to the group, following his appearance with the USA Men’s National Team last summer, earning his first test cap against Georgia and bringing senior side experience to the young group.\n\nGericke and Pathways Manager Brendan Keane now look forward to a momentous 2024 off the back of great foundations set last year. A critical piece to the puzzle in long-term planning is a fundraising and support initiative aimed at offering the most time and resources possible to the Junior National Teams. Lawrence has laid out a grid of necessities that goes into funding a single player - from travel, accommodations, coaching and supplies, where there is a significant amount of player support required. While World Rugby grants support the team for competition windows, gifts from generous donors are a crucial part of the plan, and ultimate growth for the USA Eagles on the world stage."
