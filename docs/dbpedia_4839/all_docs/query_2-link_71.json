        "text": "The pitch ratings system is back for season 2015 by request of our members.\n\nEach delegate of the away team each week gives a rating based on the following criteria -\n\nThe pitch rating as a mark out of 5 is as follows -\n\n5 – Excellent\n\n4 – Very good\n\n3 – Good\n\n2 – Unsatisfactory\n\n1 – Poor\n\nDelegates consider each of the following to determine the quality of the pitch -\n\n- Run of the ball\n\n- Stability\n\n- General presentation\n\n- Grass coverage\n\n- Quality of remedial work being carried out at half time\n\nPOSPITCHAVG1Turner's Cross4.62Athlone Town Stadium42RSC44The Showgrounds3.65Ferrycarrig Park3.56Richmond Park3.47Eamonn Deacy Park3.27UCD Bowl3.29Carlisle Grounds2.8410City Calling Stadium2.7510Dalymount Park2.7512Tolka Park2.6713Tallaght Stadium2.614St Colmans Park2.515United Park2.416Finn Park2.2517Oriel Park218The Brandywell1.819Jackman Park1.520Stradbrook Park1\n\nPFA Ireland Player Executive, Ollie Cahill, said “Our members felt the quality of the playing surfaces needed to be highlighted, the good, but in particular, the bad. We understand the difficulties that clubs face trying to get pitches up to scratch during the off season but the players felt that some of the surfaces are not at the standard required by the top league in the country. Hopefully we will see the surfaces improve over the summer and that most pitches record an average mark of 3 and above.\n\n“We all saw the excellent playing surface at Turner’s Cross on Friday night and it helped produce a fantastic game of football and it’s no surprise it tops the table this month. If players could play on surfaces like this every week it can help improve the quality of football played each week.\n\n“We’ll pass on this information to the FAI and make them aware of the players’ feelings on this issue.”\n\nThe pitch ratings will be published at the end of each month and each mark is an average."
