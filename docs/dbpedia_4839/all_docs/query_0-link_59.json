Both games were fast and vigorous, and. the play\n\nintensely interesting, the results being in doubt until á few\n\nminutes before the finish. At the T.C.A. ground Cananore de-\n\nfeated North Hobart, and Lefroy secured a win against Nsw\n\nTown at the North Hobart ground. v vi.\n\nIn the Northern Association roster, North Launceston de-\n\nfeated City at York.

'\n\nCANANORE DEFEAT\n\nNORTH HOBART\n\nFast and Vigorous Game\n\nCondition the Deciding Factor\n\nAt tlio T.C.A.'.ground Cananore and\n\nNorth Hobart, traditional, but friendly\n\nrivals, provided a most interesting'tussle.\n\nThe scores fluctuated until shortly before\n\nthe finish, when Cunanorc's 'better physi-\n\ncal condition enabled them to\"\"wln,\" tho dif-\n\nference in tho scoring, viz., 20 p.oints, be-\n\ning a misleading ,lndlcatlon;>of the play\n\nduring tho four quarters. It\".was only in\n\nthc final stages that Cananore outstripped\n\ntheir opponents, -who .tired badly, but who,\n\nIn the first \"three quarters,- showed tho\n\ndetermination and tenacity that havO' for\n\nyears been features of North's play. On\n\nnearly a dozen occasions tho scores were\n\nlevel, and lt was. exhilarating to witness\n\nthc dogged defence of the respective back,\n\nt lines. Tho amended law ' In regard to\n\n\"holding the man, holding the bail,\" caus-\n\ned confusion, and there appears to bo little I\n\ndoubt that lt will bo some time before\n\nplayers become accustomed to the altered\n\nconditions. ...\n\n. The closeness of tho scoring in both\n\n¡matches indicated a most successful sea-\n\nson, probably the most successful for\n\nyears. \" At the T.C.A. ground 2,200 people\n\n?witnessed the game, the gate receipts be-\n\ning £B5 2s. Prior to the commencement\n\nof the match'tho* chairman of the league\n\n(Mr. J. Miller) presented Nortli Hobart\n\nwith the 1920 premiership pennant.,\n\nThe teams were: Cananore, backs, Géap\n\npen, , Maddock, Jackson; half-backs, P.\n\nTracey, Evans, Arthur; centre,- Lipscombe,\n\nCharlesworth, L. \"-Tracey; half forwards,\n\nGroombridge, Jolley, Green;. forwards,\n\nSculthorpe, Brain,' Knight; followers,- Bil-\n\nlett, Coward, Hill. .- -' ? \".\"\n\n. North. Hobart: Backs, Jolly; Finch,,\n\nMoore; half-backs, Sherrin, Felmlngham,\n\nShirley; centre, Dalton, Edwards, Parker;\n\nhalf-forwards, Bonnltcha, Pye, Hawkes;\n\nforwards, Batchelor, Rait, L>. Smith; fol-\n\nlowers, F. Smith,. Lynch, McKay.\n\nA FAST OPENING.\n\nThe game opened fast, and although play\n\n.was inclined to bo crowded, lt was strenu-\n\nous,, the standard being above that usu-,\n\nally witnessed In opening matches. - .The:\n\nplayers were not quick to. adapt them-:\n\nselves to tho amended rule In respect to\n\n\"holding tho man, holding the ball,\" de-\n\nspite the very consistent decisions given\n\nby the umpire. The play In-tho opening\n\nquarter was even. North Hobart showed\n\nsuperiority In the air, and in the crushes\n\nhad slightly the better of matters, but In\n\nthe open passages Cananore showed bet-\n\nter dash, and were moro nccurate In\n\ntheir foot passing. For the first several,\n\nminutes play swung between the back,\n\nlines, with Thoth sides , showing a tendency\n\nto work the-flanks, Dalton on one of the'\n\nwings putting in particularly good work.'\n\nBrain opened the scoring with a point for\n\nCananore six minutes after play had been\n\nIn progress, but Batchelor, in the space\n\nof a couple of minutes, followed suit for\n\nNorth. Both forward lines wore given\n\ngood chances, but Felmlngham proved a\n\nsolid defender for North, and Geappen\n\nand P. Tracey were effecting fine «aves\n\nfor Cananore. Kalt was being closely\n\nwatched. He started off with a Bingle.\n\nI and'on a couple of occasions just failed\n\nto hold the ball In front. Pye was do-\n\ning well on North's forward lino, showing\n\ngood Judgment In tho air. Cananore re-\n\ngistered four singles before L. Tracey, who\n\nwas opposed to Dalton, snapped tho ball\n\nup and goaled, the play having then\n\nbeen In progress 18 minutes. Rnit, re-\n\nceiving from L. Smith, mnde no mistake\n\nwith his next shot, but Jelley, who was\n\nfiguring prominently as centre forward for\n\nCananore. marked in good style from Bil-\n\nlett, and capped a good piece of play with\n\na goal. A fast and Interesting quarter\n\nended with the scores reading:\n\nG. B. Pt«.\n\nCananore. 2 4 - 16\n\nNorth Hobart .... 1 4-10\n\nVIGOROUS PLAY.\n\nTho Play In the second quarter was fast\n\nand vigorous, with both back lines offer-\n\ning stubborn resistance. . Perhaps on ac-\n\ncount -of tho anxiety of players to rid\n\nthemselves of tho ball, there was an ab-\n\nsence of snappy foot passing and system\n\nwas lacking, but this did not detract from\n\nthe exciting nature of the play. Bait start-\n\ned oft with a single six minutes after play\n\nhad boen in progress. He was working\n\nwell on the forward line, but was never\n\nallowed to scout out alono without the\n\nclosest attention from Maddock and Geap-\n\npen. Felmlngham and Sherrin were prov-\n\ning effective for North on the back line,\n\nand when Brnin and Jelley tried to open\n\na passage, the former relieved In good\n\nstylo. Pye continued to figure prominent-\n\nly with his high marking, but North's for-\n\nwards were being beaten by the dash of\n\nCananore's backs. P. Tracey on numerous\n\noccasions racing out ahead and driving the\n\nhall forward with well directed kicks.\n\nBrain scored the1 first single for Cananore\n\n13 minutes after tho resumption. Green,\n\nroving, was one of the most effective play-\n\ners on the ground, and was always placing\n\nthe ball to good advantage. A fine driv-\n\ning kick bv Parker from the wing went\n\nclose, and Rait, showing cleverness, work-\n\ned tho ball away from a scrimmage, and\n\ncoaled with eight minutes of the quarter\n\nleft. Hawkes was marklnc well for North\n\non the forward linc. Amid Intense ex-\n\ncitement Bonnltcha brought the scores\n\nlevel with a nolnt. and with two minuter\n\nbefore tho finish of the form Halt kicked\n\nhis third coal through ¡in uninterrupted\n\npassage, half time scores being:\n\nG. B. pti.\n\nCananore. 2 6 - 18\n\nNorth Hobart .. .. 3 6 - 24\n\nY THRILLING PLAY. . . ?? \"\n\nThe iU'li'd quarter was thrilling-in the\n\nextreme with both.sides nat out. and giv-\n\ning away enough In the vigour ot their\n\nbumps, but a pleasing feature of tho play\n\nwas the absence of ill-feeling, despite the\n\nstrenuous nature of the play. .Both sidos\n\nshowed determination In their sallies.\n\nNorth Hobart, who had had^-tho .better\n\nof things on the wings In tho first half,\n\ngradually lost their supremacy In this\n\ndirection; Li. Tracey and Lipscombo stead-\n\nily wearing down Dalton and Parker, who\n\nhad been outstanding in the'-first half.\n\nRaft just missed holding'a' difficult mark,\n\nwhich-was lucky for Cananore, and Green,\n\nwho was- effective In his work, added a\n\ngoal after receiving from Brain. Evans,\n\nwho had come into1 the ruck, ' added .-in\n\nother point for Cananore,. ibrliigihg tho\n\nscores level. Sherrin; showing; nice dash,\n\nbroke up tho next Cananore,offensive, am)\n\nMcKay, whose work around tho fringes\n\nof the crush was one of .the'-'.'outstanding\n\nfeatures of North's play, passed-to Hawkes,\n\nbut Arthur checked the move, Jelley con-\n\ntinued to stand out oh Cananore-'s forward\n\nlino, but his work on ' occasions was nulli-\n\nfied by faulty kicking. Knight goaled for\n\nCananore, but North's supporters cheered\n\nwhen Pye followed suit. Pye. continued\n\nto show out and once moro-tho scores\n\nwore brought lovel, when he added a point.\n\nCananore sneaked ahead once.more with a\n\npoint kicked by Oreen, but)Dalton onee\n\nmoro levelled tho figures. -., Cananero took\n\nthe lead when Brain,* receiving, a tap out,\n\ngoaled, but' a strong North offensive re-\n\nsulted In Hawkes gballng forfrUorth, the\n\nscores at, three-quarter time being:\n\n.; '.

Iii. a match, -which, on the\n\ngeneral play, was remarkably even. North\n\nInstituted several sallleH at the-.cOmnienuo\n\nment of the.last term, and had Cananore's\n\nbacks-not withstood UieJr'early shock at-\n\ntacks,' tho result would, for ascertain, have\n\nbeen different.''.. .As. .mattera.¿turned out\n\nNorth gradually petered -oul.'.nhd .Canan-\n\nore outstripped them In'the last t^vo min-\n\nutes. Sherrin, with an' exhilarating dash,\n\nbrought the scores level with .a , point In\n\nless than a minute after tlieV-rosumption,\n\nand Rait gave North the lead'with' another\n\npoint. N.orthts rallying efforts llièn (lied\n\nout and Cananore, showing superior dash\n\nand stnmlna, . were continually 'attacking.\n\nThey added two singles In quick succes-\n\nsion, \"but splendid ., marking.-by-.Pyo> enabl-\n\ned Dalton to add-a singlo for North.

Can-\n\nanore forced another point through, and\n\nSculthorpe, from a difficult angle shot,\n\ngoaled, giving Cananore a lead of 14 points\n\nnine minutes before- the finish. With vic-,\n\ntory tn sight, Cananore played with re-\n\nnewed dash, and Green put the result be-\n\nyond doubt by goaling,\"* most Interesting\n\ngame ending with tho scores reading:\n\n. ?' \" G.v\" B.

P. Tracey was outstanding on\n\nthe back lino, and Jelley, although dis-\n\nplaying Impetuosity, showed great promise\n\nof developing Into a player of representa-\n\ntivo class. Billett, after the first half, was\n\nhandicapped by an injury, .but performed\n\nsolid work, and Iv. Tracey, In tho second\n\nhalf, Bhowed clovorness and resource.\n\nGeappen was solid In defence, and of Hie\n\nothers. Evans, HUI, Maddock, Brain, and\n\nLipscombe were conspicuous.\n\nDalton, although opposed to one of Can-\n\nanore's outstanding players, wns effective\n\nand smart on the wing. Pyo showed great\n\npromise. Ho displayed coolness and linn\n\njudgment In tho air. McKay played a\n\nparticularly smart gama roving, and Park-\n\ner, from the wings, always drove tho ball\n\nforward with a fine long distance kick.\n\nHawkes showed fino form In the~.ilr, and\n\nFclmlngham, Smith. Sherrin, Batchelor,\n\nand Finch stood out.\n\nThe goal kickers were.-Cananore: Green\n\n(2), L.

Thc standard of play «us\n\ngood although there was an absence of\n\ntenm work. , Both teams played a hard\n\nand dashing game and there was novi-r\n\n1 much difference between the scores. Lef\n\ntoy attacked continually In. the last quarter\n\nand In a strong finish with which Nt*\n\nTown could not cope, ran out winners by\n\n15 points.\n\nTho new \"holding rule\" did not Impress\n\nfavourably. At times lt was Impossible\n\nfor a man to kick or punch tho ball, an\"\n\nibero was always confusion among flit\n\nplayers. The Interpretation wo» not con-\n\nsistent.

Tlbballs,\n\nCurtain: half-backs, Smith, Noye ? Exton ;\n\ncentres. Butler, Buckney, Parsons; half\n\nforwards, Upchurch, Hay, Parker; for-\n\nwards, McGlnniss, Chipman, Lester; fol-\n\nlowers.

Bloomfield. McPherson, Cole.\n\nA DASHING OPENING.\n\nThe opening was fast and vigorous and\n\nHay scored two goals for Lefroy within\n\ntwo minuten of (lio bounce. A tons kick\n\nby parsons enabled Hay to mark a good\n\ndistance out and kick the first uoal within\n\nhalf a minute of the bounce. Soon after-\n\nwards he marked again and repeated tho\n\nscore. Thero W.-IH little to choose between\n\nthe teams In dash and pace, but for the\n\nfirst 10 minutes New Town seemed .some-\n\nwhat disorganised. Leitch, however, was\n\na stumbling block for Lefroy, anil Cole was\n\nplaying a well indeed and dashing game.\n\nPierce was showing out well In tho centre.\n\nNew Town Improved their judgment and\n\nswept forward In a succession of attacks\n\nwhich had Lefroy'u backs working hard,\n\nExton, Noye, Nicholson and Murray show-\n\ning out particularly. Tlbbals was playing\n\na userul game in the goals and saved\n\nsplendidly on two occuslous In quick suc-\n\ncession. For a first club match thc game\n\nwas of a good standard,, but tho new \"hold\n\nliiir tho ball\" rulo did not impress favour-\n\nably. At timos lt was Impossible for a\n\nplayer to. kick or punch, the ball when held,\n\nand there .were several Inconsistencies.\n\nArter persistent attacking New Town\n\nbroko through with\" a goal from Young,\n\nfrom a free kick, and soon afterwards a\n\npaBs between Stacey und Brooks enabled\n\nthe latter to goal. In the closing stages\n\nof tho quarter New Town-had the better\n\nof tho play and. just before the bell Cole\n\ncoaled from an anglo .willi a tree kick.\n\nGourlay marked us tho bell sounded, and\n\ngoaled from a good distance. At the end\n\nof tho quarter the scores were:\n\nC. B. Pis.\n\nLefroy. 2 - 1Z\n\n\" New Town .... 4 2 26\n\nTho second quarter was even, bul New\n\nTown did not malto the best of their\n\nchances. Lefroy attacked Immediately,\"\n\nbut New Town swept tho ball to tho other\n\nend by sheer weight. Tlbballs cleared and\n\nLefroy launched a series of tenacious at-\n\ntacks which for a limo failed to reach\n\ntheir objective. Noyc, Exton and Curtain\n\nwere defending solidly and kent tho ball'\n\nmoving forward, but again Leitch was the\n\nmainstay, and with .Roberts and Bloom-\n\nfield formed a ' determined trio of backs.\n\nBucknoy,-who had been fnlrly qulet ln the\n\nfirst quarter, canto to light with: brilliant\n\nAN EVEN TERM.\n\nmarking In the centre. . upchurch I rom a\n\nfreo kick scored Lefroy's fourth coal soon\n\nafter Murray luoke through with a sue-:\n\ncessful snapshot. Lefroy were then a\n\nDoini behind New Town. New Town ral-\n\nlied strongly and there wero some exciting:\n\nexchanges round Lefroy's coals with;\n\nPierce, Brooks, Gourlay and Young prom-\n\ninent. : Exton, displaying vigour and dash,\n\nsaved on several occasions, and with Mur-\n\nray carried thc ball forward again. Rob-\n\nerts saved a dangerous situation and New\n\nTown prersed . forward in : dashing. style.\n\nHowever, there was fumbling on the. for-\n\nward lino and New Town could not.break\n\nthrough until Cole scored Now Town's only\n\ngoal of the quarter with a shot which\n\nstruck the.ground live yards Ur front of\n\nhim . a nd bounced over the players' heads\n\nInto tho goals. -Lefroy again attacked\n\npersistently and both Chesterman and Hay\n\nscored . with running shots out ot the\n\nscrum, placing Lefroy live pollita In frontr\n\nThe scores at half-time were:\n\nG. B. Pis.\n\nLefroy ...... .. 6 4 40\n\nNew Town. 5 5 35\n\nNEW TOWN LEAD.\n\nNow Town wero In the ascendancy in the\n\nthird quarter', .-ind although the teams were\n\nevenly matched In dash and naco, New\n\nTown were bettor In tho air and handled\n\ntho ball well. Nicholson placed-'Lefroy\n\nin attack at tho ' bounce, but Ferguson\n\ncarno to'light'with'a lornr driving kick and\n\nrelieved well. Buckney. who was domin-\n\nating the play at times; foreed the ball\n\ndown again, but Lefroy could not force the\n\nball past Roberts. Leitch and Williams. A\n\nfast counter-attack by \"Now Town'along\n\ntho wilie. had. Lefroj'-on the defensive nnd\n\nBloomfield from a free kick placed New\n\nTown, a point In Hie lead. Lefroy, with\n\nNoye. Buckney, Exton, and Smith promin-\n\nent, -pressed Into New Town's back linc,\n\nbut Roberts mid Leitch were'fighting vig-\n\norously and Pierce. Paul, McPherson and\n\nYoung Woro conspicuous. Now Town\n\ncaine, forward timo after time and two\n\nKoa ls came in rapid succession, .one from a\n\nmark by Gourlay, and tho second from a\n\n'running'shot out of tho ruck by Young.\n\nA vigorous counter-attack by Lefroy. waB\n\nstaved off, but Lefroy forced the ball for-\n\nward again and Hay scored willi a running\n\nshot.\" New Town were playlng-wltli spark-\n\nling dash and Lefroy were continually on\n\n! tho defensive. Nove, Curtain, Exton and\n\nBuckney .were consistent workers in Lef-\n\nroy's defence and held Now Town 'off time\n\nafter time. Lefroy were attacking at thc\n\nbell when tho scores were:- . .\n\nG. B. Pta. .\n\nLefroy. 7 7 4D\n\nNew Town. 8 7 50 '\n\nLEFROY'S FINE FINISH.\n\nLefroy's stubborn and persistent attacks\n\nIn tho last quarter had New Town badly\n\nrattled at times, and New Town, scored\n\nonly ono point. They wero on the de-\n\nfensive almost tho whole of- the quarter.\n\nLefroy fought their Way Into the forward\n\nlino and Lester lilt the post with an angle\n\nshot. New Town's backs tried to stem\n\ntho-persistent attacks of Lefroy.-and Wil-\n\nliams rose to Die occasion brilliantly In Hie\n\ngoals. Bloomfield at last shouldered lils\n\nway through the nack and placed New\n\nTown In attack, but Chesterman saved.\n\nExton relieved In dashing style when Ack\n\nerley and- Bloomfield again brought the ball\n\nforward. Tho pinv flashed back to Now\n\nTown's goals and Hay missed with a run-\n\nning shot from 10 yards .out. Nicholson\n\nthen placed Lefroy In the lead with a long\n\nkick which lust reached the coals. Both\n\nsides were lighting hard with New Town\n\ndefending desDerately and Lefroy forging\n\nahead stubbornly, superior to Now Town\n\nIn dash and vigour. Roberts and Leitch\n\nwore working hard and Williams rose high\n\nabove the pack and pulled down a magni-\n\nficent innrk saving an almost certain goal.\n\nA few minutes from the end Nicholson\n\nscored another goal, the ball bouncing\n\npast Williams and Lefroy were then seven\n\nnolnts in front. New Town fought a los-\n\ning battle In the last few minutes, but Lef-\n\nroy finished strongly and were still at-\n\ntacking at the bell. Just before the bell\n\nParker scored another coal. The final\n\nscores were:\n\nG. B. Pts.\n\nLefroy. .. 10 11 71\n\nNew Town ........ 8 8 56\n\nFor Lefroy Buckney was solid and ? do\n\npendablo In the. centre and pulled down\n\nsome brilliant marks. Noye, Exton and\n\nCurtain were a reliable trio of defenders,\n\nand Nicholson was the outstanding of the\n\nfollowers. He played a vigorous, hard\n\ngamo and 'was never lacking. . Parker\n\nand Murray were ternirions and useful rov-\n\ners, and Lester and Hay were useful in at-\n\ntack. TIbballs did well In the coals, and\n\nlils kicking- was consistently good. For\n\nNow Town Leitch, Roberts and Williams\n\nwere always solid fighters In New Town's\n\ndefence, and their splendid marking and\n\nkicking wero a feature; Bloomfield was\n\nthe best, of the followers. Pauli and An\n\nnells did well on tho wings and-Plerce was\n\nalways useful in the centre, althoush after\n\ntho first quarter ho was overshadowed by\n\nBuckney. Stacey and Young were re-\n\nliable forwards, and Colo figured promin-\n\nently on occasions..\n\nThe eoal-klckcrs were:\n\nLefroy: Hay (4) Nicholson (2), Murray,\n\nUpchurch, Chesterman and Parker. \\\n\nNew Town: Young (2).

Tho con-\n\nditions were favourable In every way, and\n\na most exciting gamo resulted. Kerman-\n\ndie led oft in the jittack, and scored a\n\ncouple of singles, which were followed by a\n\nsimilar record by the home team. Then\n\nKermandie got a goal, and just before\n\ntho bell rang, added a behind, and another\n\ncoal. Franklin monopolised the scoring\n\nIn tho second term The ball rarely\n\nreached tho visitors' half-forwards, and\n\nthe only try they had for goal fell short,\n\nand tho. leather was immediately trans-\n\nferred to tho opposite end of the ground.\n\nFranklin's coal kicking was very much at\n\nl.\n\nfault, the ball appearing to be tho cause\n\nof much of thc trouble, us lt behaved in a\n\nmost erratic way. From nine scoring shots.\n\nFranklin only once raised tho two flags,\n\nwhich made the score nt half-time: Frank-\n\nlin, 10 points; Kermandie, 15 points.\n\nThe third quarter was evenly contested,\n\nbut Kermandie were moro fortunate In\n\ntheir attempts for goal, getting four ma-\n\njors, while Franklin only got three out\n\nof six scoring shots. Thc final quarter\n\nsaw Kermandie at their best In general\n\nplay, but their goal' kicking was less ac-\n\ncurate than In the earlier stages, whilst\n\nthat of their opponents improved.

At York Park, North\n\nLaunceston registered an 18-point vic-\n\ntory over City, after a hard and inter\n\nostlng game. North's superior condi-\n\ntion was noticeable in the final quar-\n\nter. Launceston defeated Longford on\n\nthe country oval by nine points.\n\nThe game between City and North\n\nLaunceston at York Park on Saturday was\n\nwitnessed by u large crowd, who were\n\ntreated to an exhibition of stirring foot-\n\nball. Tho weather conditions wero Ideal,\n\nand tho oval was In good order. A feature\n\nof tho.match was tho high marking of both\n\nteams. Very little separated .the teams as\n\nregards actual play, but North showed\n\nbetter staying powers, und gaining the .up\n\noerhand towards tho close of tho game-put\n\nIn a great finish, und won by 18 points.\n\nCity Is undoubtedly a much Improved team,\n\nand played with great determination and\n\ngrit, but tho forward line became a little\n\nragged at times and several opportunities\n\nto score wero lost through erratic kick-\n\ning and crowding tho ball. The opening\n\nstages were In' favour or City, und both\n\nteams showed patches of good work In the\n\nair. As tho game progressed North gradu-\n\nally fell into their stride, and opening the\n\ngame up secured the lead. In the third\n\nquarter City retaliated strongly, and the\n\ngame became a keon, even tussle, with\n\nperiods of spectacular systematic football.\n\nCity failed to sustain their efforts, how-\n\never, and finishing with Irresistible dash\n\nNorth secured their second victory Terry\n\nand Farmer were absentees from North,\n\nand City were without the services of\n\nDavidson. The gate receipts amounted to\n\n£155 7s. The teams were:\n\nCity. - Cazoly (capt.). Elszele, Emms,\n\nJoolun. Lewis, Potter. Goodluck, Brown,\n\nSalter. R. Nash, Moir. Ferguson. L. Nash,\n\nCarroll. Huntington, Davies, Burrows,\n\nHorner, and Merrigan (19th).\n\nNorth Launceston. - Adams (capL),\n\nHealey, Bickford. Archer. Snowball. Sum-\n\nmers, Scott. Cooke, Cunnnlghnm, Stott,\n\nBrown, Palllser. McQueen, Ellis,) Hay, D.\n\nElmer,r Spencer, Exton, and Ford (19th). .\n\nCITY TAKE THE LEAD.\n\nAdams won the toss, and elected to kick\n\ntowards the rallwuy end. North began to\n\nattack strongly, and L. Nash was culled\n\nupon several times to defend lu tho first\n\ntow minutes. Cooke secured, and attempt-\n\ned a shot, but tho ball went out. North\n\nagain swept forward, and the ball was\n\nforced through goal by Adams out of a\n\nscrimmage. Clover play by Goodluck on\n\nHie grandstand wing sent the ball to the\n\nCity forwards, where Moir snapped up and\n\nopened City's account with a major. The\n\ngame was fast and Interesting, and after\n\na period of even play North again pressed\n\nforward, and Cunningham goaled. City ral-\n\nlied, but players showed over-cagerness,\n\nand wera fumbling badly. The play was of\n\na scrambly nature until City again broke\n\naway and Burrows, from a long kick, kick-\n\ned City's second goal. Clty'o play Improved\n\nconsiderably. Goodluck continually coming\n\nInto prominence on tbs wing. A magnifi-\n\ncent linge-r-tip mark In Uie centre earned\n\napplause for Cazaly, wbo drove the ball to\n\nMoir, who added another goal. Even play\n\nfollowed, with Nash and Burrows doing\n\nyeoman service In defence for City, and\n\nHay and Scott proving reliable defenders\n\nfor North. When the quarter ended the\n\nscores were:\n\nG. B. Pta.\n\nCity. .. ..3 4 - 22\n\nNorth ........ 2 2 - 14\n\nNORTH IMPROVE.\n\nSecuring at the bounce Adams forward-\n\ned, but the attack petered out owing to\n\nplayers continually being penalised for not\n\nobserving the new \"holding\" rule. Stott\n\nwas proving a great battler for North, and\n\nhis exhilarating dashes continually aroused\n\nenthusiasm. When repulsing a City attack\n\nBickford received a nasty knock, and was\n\nout of the game for several minutes. City\n\nwere playing with resouce and determina-'\n\nlion, but their shooting was erratic and\n\nonly singles resulted. Adams was showing\n\ngreat dash on North's forward line, and\n\nanother goal from a scrimmage in front\n\nwas secured. Both teams wero playing vig-\n\norously, and the play opened out. Break-\n\ning away from tho crush with character-\n\nistic dash Stott goaled for North, and only\n\ntwo points separated the scores. Burrows\n\nproved reliable In defence for City, pulling\n\ndown some beautiful marks, but North con-\n\ntinued to attack, and Adams goaled from\n\na long angle shot. North were having the\n\nbetter of the play, but met with spirited\n\nresistance from tho City defenders. City\n\nat last broke through, and a chain of marks\n\nbetween Cazally. Goodluck. and Joolen, and\n\nthe last-named goaled. North had return-\n\ned to the attack when the quarter ended,\n\nthe board showing:\n\na. B. pts.\n\nNorth. 6.5 - 41\n\nCity. 4 8 - 32\n\nAN EXCITING TERM.\n\nEven play ensued., until Cnzaly forward-\n\ned. whero> Huntington gathered In the ball\n\nand kicked an easy goal. North attacked, i\n\nbut Cazaly relieved, and passing to Joolen »\n\nCity again golaed by the medium of Hor- |\n\nner. Again and again City swept forward,\n\nbut North rallied desperately, and Adams I\n\ncleared with a fine-run down, tho wing.'\n\nTho game ivas fast and exciting, and play-\n\ners hurled themselves into the fray with\n\nabandon, and Cooko showed cleverness and\n\nresource In turning in tho pocket, but Lewis\n\nund Ii. Nash rose to thu occasion, and City\n\ncleared. City pressed forward, but missed\n\nopportunities through crowding, and Bick-\n\nford cleared. A magnillcent mark by\n\nAdams put tho City goal In danger, but\n\nCunningham., who received tho pass, failed\n\nto kick tho distance. He made amends a\n\nfew minutes later, when ho piloted a goal\n\nfrom an anglo shot. City applied tho pres-\n\nsure, and their determined efforts bore\n\nfruit, when Joolen goaled. North Teplled a\n\nfew minutes later when Adams added his\n\nfourth goal during a desperate struggle In\n\nfront of goal. The play continued wry will-\n\ning, and (wo City mei. were receiving at-\n\ntention from (ho trainers when the quarter\n\nended, with the scores:\n\nG. B. Pts.\n\nNorth. 8 7 -55\n\nCity. 7 9 - 51\n\nNORTH FORGE AHEAD.\n\nOnly four points separated tho. scores\n\nwhen tho last quarter began, und both\n\nteams started In with a will, Joolen for-\n\nwarded to Elszele. and tho attn ck was\n\ndriven home by lt. Nash, who pulled down\n\na great mark and goaled. Davis, who had\n\nreplaced Emms In the centre, set moving\n\nseveral attacks, but North rallied strongly,\n\nand breaking away sent tho leather down\n\ntho field with lighting speed, and Cunning-\n\nham goaled, putting North In the lead. The\n\nfluctuating fortunes of tho-teams, and the\n\nHashes of fast, scleutlllc football, roused\n\nthe crowd to great enthusiasm. The players\n\nhad also become excited, and Potter was\n\ncautioned. Summers goaled with a long\n\ndriving kick for North, but City were\n\nlighting every inch pf the way. Adams\n\ntried n place kick, but only a minor result-\n\ned. Up and down the oval tho game sway-\n\ned, until tho Bpeeily wingster, Healey, se-\n\ncured, and forwardt-d lo Cooke, who ran in\n\nand scored with ease. City hud begun to\n\ntiro, and when 'Summers goaled North's\n\nposition seemed Impregnable. North eased\n\nup a little, and City added another goal\n\njust beforo the bell sounded, leaving-North\n\nvictors by 18 points. Thc scores were:\n\nG. B. Pta.,\n\nNorth ......... ..12 10 - 82\n\nCity .. V. ... .. .... 9 10 - 64\n\nTHE PLAYERS.\n\nNorth Launceston were best served by\n\nStott, who was probably the beet man on\n\ntho ground. Playing with great dash he\n\ncleared from the crush time after time, and\n\nwas never beaten. , Adams again showed\n\nlino form, and though always scrupulously\n\nfair used his weight to good advantage, and\n\nkicked four goals. Cooke scouted and mark-\n\ned well, and Cunningham, although, watch-\n\ned closely, made good use ot his opportuni-\n\nties. Others who did-well wero: McQueen,\n\nHay; and Healey. ,\n\nI*or City. L. Nash was very reliable in\n\ndefence, and pullet! down some great\n\nmarks. Cazaly handled his team lu his\n\nusual good style, and put In a lot-of'effec-\n\ntive work.

It was fast and open, and\n\nin tho second and third auartcrs was ex-\n\nciting. Although Longford Wci-e defeated\n\nthey predominated for most of the carno,\n\nbut lt was Launceston's fast shock attacks\n\nand a great back linc-that cave them vic-\n\ntory. The weather 'was Ideal, and there\n\nwas a (air attendance, -tho cato receipts\n\namounting to £35.\n\nThe teams were:\n\nLaunceston.-Carruthers (capt.). Barry,\n\nThomson. Baker. Swinton, Room.

A sally by Launceston gave them an\n\nopportunity to score, but the chanco was\n\nlost.. Longford whipped tho ball through\n\ntho centro, and out of'a scramble In front,\n\nTaylor snapped a nolnt Tor tho country\n\nteam, tho first'score of thc.-match, after\n\n(Ivo minutes.; With forcing play Launces-\n\nton replied quickly with two singles. The\n\nteams had settled down, and soino really\n\nfine play was being staged. With a dash\n\nthrough .the opposition. Bean and H. Smith\n\nsent- tho ball well forward, and Dunn\n\nmarked well out. With, a long drlvo the\n\nexrSouthernor mado no mistake for goal,\n\nbut Launceston, forcing the leather away\n\nfrom tho bounce, regained tho lead, when\n\nWaddle, from a penalty, kicked a goal.\n\nTwo points followed for thé visitors with-\n\nin a minute. Stokes had a splendid oppor-\n\ntunity .when ho marked in trout of an un-\n\nguarded citadel. Through over-anxiety\n\nhis shot i-ealised a point only. In the\n\nclosing stages Launceston were well In the\n\nascendancy, but tho same fault of tho pre-\n\nvious week-erratic kicking-characterised\n\ntheir attack and singles resulted. The\n\nbell closed a fairly even quarter, the scores\n\nbeing:- ,\n\nG.\" B.

Ten minutes o\n\noven play followed, with tho ball see-saw-\n\ning across the centro Une. Longford'i\n\nfirst scoro ot tho.quarter carno as tho re-\n\nsult of a magnificent piece of play by H\n\nSmith. Tho diminutive Dlayer left ihre«\n\nLaunceston men helpless, and tearing in\n\nsnapped a great coal. Tho score Bcemet\n\nto spur Longford for there, followed som«\n\ndashing plav with both loams showlni\n\nsystem and high marking. Again, H\n\nSmith forced through hut only a ooint wai\n\nshown. Dunn repeated tho score. Long-\n\nford were sweeping all befpre them, and H\n\nSmith, Dunn and Odgers were forcing :\n\nconstant barrage on tho Launceston de\n\nfence. With rush tactics Launceston re\n\ntallated and in three kicks-Kelly had thi\n\nleather within 40 yards of the posts. Hi:\n\neasy kick saw Launceston's third goal ci\n\nor. tho board. Longford returned to th«\n\nattack, but again points were scored. Th«\n\nquarter closed with Longford seven point\n\nbehind. It had been the country players\n\nterm without doubt.

Botl\n\nteams were showing flashes of excellen\n\nfootball, but the forwards were ehootlnt\n\nerratically. Longford now revealed th«\n\nbest football they have shown this year\n\nTime and Hine again they launched ul\n\n! tacks, but a magnificent defence by Laun-\n\nceston's back line prevented Bcorlng. 1\n\nwas exhilarating football, with every mai\n\nrising to the occasion. There was HI\n\ndoubt about Longford's superiority, but I\n\nover a trio presented a wonderful resist-\n\nance, lt was Room, Thomson, and Mc\n\nAuley. Two minutes were left whet\n\nLongford pierced the defences, and Taylor\n\nwith a ' corkscrew shot, made thc scorei\n\nlevel with a great goal. In the second:\n\nthat wore left, Launceston fought desper-\n\nately, and two points gave (lie visitón\n\nthe lead again. lt had been a splendlc\n\nquarter, and had tho crowd buoyed wltl\n\nenthusiasm.

Stnglng\n\na snap attack, Launceston rushed forward,\n\nand Ryan, rising above the pack, held the\n\nball. With a place kick he sent the-lea-\n\nther- through, and the visitors' fourth goal\n\nwna raised, Longford tried attacks fron,\n\nboth wings, but Launceston-Avero finish-'\n\nlng In a way that was a credit to every,\n\nmember of the team. The prelude to thc\n\nend came when eight minuten were left,\n\nand.
