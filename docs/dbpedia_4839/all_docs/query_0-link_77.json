        "text": "By Richard Porter : 08/09/2010 : Comments (90) :\n\nI've been thinking about the depths to which some of our former players have sunk, partly inspired by the match report of last week's Cowdenbeath game, and partly by attending Lancaster v Warrington last night.\n\nThe Cowdenbeath game was against Partick Thistle, and Cowden won inspired by a brilliant performance by their right winger, ballet dancer Brian Fairbairn. Fairbairn ran the show, and the embarrassed man failing to mark him was our former reserve left back Paddy Boyle, who recently joined Partick from 3rd Div Dumbarton.\n\nThen, Warrington's 4-0 destruction of Lancaster featured as its midfield playmaker Gareth Farrelly, who famously scored the goal that saved us from relegation one year (Lancaster's side featured teenage former Everton academy players Alex Kenyon and Max Rothwell). Reading the Lancaster programme on the train home, I noticed that Burscough have recently signed Michael Branch, who seems to have been unattached since leaving Chester in 2006.\n\nOn the topic of Chester, their bankruptcy last season has seen them drop into the same division as Lancaster and Warrington (Evo-Stik League Div 1 North). Another effect of their folding was to make a free agent of one of our many former next big things, Nick Chadwick. Chadwick took advantage of free agency to move to Barrow.\n\nHe was briefly joined at Holker Street this summer by triallist JP Kissock who, since leaving Hamilton late last year, has largely been DJing in Merseyside. He also had trials at Hereford and Milton Keynes, but doesn't seem to have impressed anyone sufficiently to actually get a contract.\n\nPaddy Boyle got me thinking about reserve left backs, and I remembered Lee Molyneux, who I saw many times play for teh Reserves in Widnes. Molyneux was spectacular at set pieces but less so from open play. He left us in the January 2009 transfer window to play for Southampton, which turned out to be slightly optimistic. He made just four appearances in 18 months before signing for Peter Reid's Plymouth Argyle (along with Anton Peterlin) at the start of this season, making four appearances already, although he is team leader in fouls and yellow cards.\n\nNote: the following content is not moderated or vetted by the site owners at the time of submission.
