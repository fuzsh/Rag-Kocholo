KILMARNOCK have joined the list of admirers of Cork City winger Ollie Cahill, who is out of contract at the end of the season.

They will have a scout at Turner’s Cross on Sunday to see Cahill play for Cork against the Eircom League leaders Shelbourne.

Shelbourne are also interested in recruiting the speedy winger who has been an ever-present for Cork since he joined the club in the Summer of 1996. Cork secured his signature after he had returned following a year with Northampton Town. Dundalk and Galway United were also seeking to sign the 26-year-old who first came to prominence playing junior football with his local club, Clonmel Town.

Cahill yesterday said he had not been directly approached by any club and said: “I am aware of all the speculation but as of now I have not spoken to any club and I have no definite plans. The next contract I sign will be the most important and I want to see what my options are before I make up my mind.”

Cahill has been Cork’s most dynamic player once again this season and the club are anxious to retain him. And he did not rule out the possibility of staying.

He said: “I’ve enjoyed my time with Cork and I will discuss the possibility of extending my time here with them. I am hopeful I can have everything sorted before the end of the season.”

Cahill would welcome an approach from Kilmarnock or another cross-channel club. He said: “I would like to try for a full-time career again. I believe I am better fitted now to deal with the challenge and the experience of having been there as a younger man would stand to me.”

As regards playing against Shelbourne in front of a Kilmarnock scout, Cahill said: “I always go out to do my best for Cork City. I will not be trying any harder this week because I always give it everything, not matter who we are playing against.”

Kilmarnock are up-to-date with the situation in Cork because the assistant manager there is Gerry McCabe, who spent three seasons with Cork City.
