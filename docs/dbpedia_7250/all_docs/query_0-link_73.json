        "text": "This is from an interview that 57-year-old Leonard Cohen did with Q in 1991. It's easy to imagine a small chuckle bouncing off the page, him shaking his head a little, a slight smile on his lips.\n\nCohen was in his early 30s when he stepped into the spotlight, guitar in hand, a poet's worth of evocations pouring from his mouth. Wise and articulate, tender and alive, Cohen the songwriter was somehow even more compelling in this naked state, his vulnerabilities heightened, his confidence tilted by slight outsider/imposter feelings about claiming a space occupied by the likes of Judy Collins and Bob Dylan, Buffy Sainte-Marie and Phil Ochs.\n\nHis reservations, though, were tempered by his age, and the relative vastness of a grownup life already lived and abandoned by the time he hit New York. He was already a master of words by the age of 33 thanks to early successes: a published poet at age 15; the author of two critically acclaimed novels by 32. He was at least 10 years older than most of his disciples and fans, the women and men who worshipped at his feet, eager to manifest their connection to the man's works with the man himself.\n\nHe was a gentleman, prone to a self-deprecation that has come off as self-confidence since his youth. His pursuit of beauty, appreciation of beauty, the ways in which he exulted and coveted and captured beauty in his words — what man couldn't understand that? What woman wouldn't be flattered to be the focus of such a fiercely artistic, intellectual, romantic man? In 1967, Cohen told the Village Voice, \"I really am for the matriarchy.\"\n\nCohen's charisma was part prophecy (he claimed to be a direct descendant of Aaron), inheritance (his father died at the age of nine, leaving him the de facto \"man of the house\"), and learned behaviour. His charm was old-world and European, but it was not pure instinct or birthright. It was also observed and chosen, as if he realized early on the power of a man who could occupy the shape of a doomed romantic, who would be able to control and master, even subconsciously, gendered social conventions that would earn him favour with women and men, that would make him something of a legend or a hero on his artist's journey.\n\nHe was always good at approximating the angles and bent neck of a man who listened with understanding and appreciated women with his whole body. But he also projected the spirit of a wanderer, a rogue, a man who was restless and eventually reckless. Someone who would always see himself as the one who was left behind even as he was taking to the sea, putting cities and countries and oceans between himself and the goddesses who could no longer inspire brilliance, who were best preserved in memory rather than contend with their gradual transformation from muse to mere woman.\n\nSince the beginning, he was painted as equal parts long-suffering, lonely boy and lanky lothario, and to a certain extent, Cohen fed into both of those personas. In this Newsday article from 1992, he apparently found it amusing that he was \"an object of lust\" in the 1960s.\n\n\"It's so curious, because I couldn't get a date,\" he said. \"I couldn't find anybody to have dinner with. By the time that first record came out, which rescued me, I was already in such a shattered situation that I found myself living at the Henry Hudson Hotel on West 57th Street, going to the Morningstar Cafe on Eighth Avenue, trying to find some way to approach the waitress and ask her out. I would get letters of longing from around the world, and I would find myself walking the streets of New York at three in the morning, trying to strike up conversations with the women selling cigarettes in hotels. I think it's always like that. It's never delivered to you.\"\n\nReading Cohen's own words and thoughts about sex, marriage, women and dating, is both intoxicating and exhausting. His intellect was deep and precise — even his conversational musings were an intricate choreography of language — so much so that every sentence was a complex seduction. But in an effort to better understand a man like Leonard Cohen, we have to know a bit more about the women he loved and the women who loved him in return.\n\nJudy Collins\n\nCollins discovered Leonard Cohen, sort of. She told CBC Music about the event in a 2013 interview.\n\n\"When I met Leonard, in 1966, he came to my house and was sent to me by one of our mutual friends who said, 'This guy has just written some songs and he wants you to tell him whether you think they're songs and whether there's any point in sending them around to various singers, and he'd like to start with you.' When he came to see me, he sang a few songs to me and of course I started recording him right away, and actually launched his career.\"\n\nShe also wrote about their close relationship in her book, Judy Blue Eyes — My Life in Music: \"I remember being in bed with a man I did not know who was coming down from an acid trip and wanted me to 'comfort him,' no sex involved. Leonard sat in the room with us, singing 'The Stranger Song' softly to himself, not paying any attention at all to what was happening on the bed. The Chelsea Hotel indeed! I trusted Leonard completely in very intimate situations and although we never had an intimate exchange of that kind ourselves, he was a constant ally I could take into battle with no fear of betrayal.\"\n\nJoni Mitchell\n\nThe longtime friends and one-time lovers go back ages. These photos of them are lovely and allegedly represent the first time they met, backstage at a Judy Collins workshop at the Newport Folk Fest in 1967.\n\nAccording to Cohencentric, Cohen, who was nine years older than Mitchell, spent a month living at her Laurel Canyon home when Hollywood wanted him to score a movie based on his song \"Suzanne.\" The movie never happened.\n\nMitchell also told Malka Maron in the book Joni Mitchell: In Her Own Words, that Mitchell wrote \"Rainy Night House\" for Cohen as a farewell when their relationship ended.\n\n\"I went one time to his home and I fell asleep in his old room and he sat up and watched me sleep. He sat up all the night and he watched me to see who in the world I could be.\"\n\n\"A Case of You\" may also be about Cohen, but there's an equal chance it's about James Taylor.\n\nAnd after years of her constantly being told that Cohen was \"obviously\" an influence on her own songs (but never that Mitchell could have possibly been an influence on Cohen), Mitchell said this in a 2001 Border Crossings interview: \"I met him when I was around 24, around the time of my first record. But thematically I wanted to be broader than he was. In many ways Leonard was a boudoir poet.\""
