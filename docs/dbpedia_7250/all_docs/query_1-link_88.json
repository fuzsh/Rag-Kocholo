        "text": "\"Water\" hit No. 1 on the Billboard U.S. Afrobeats Songs and Hip-Hop/R&B charts, and became the first African song to enter the Billboard Hot 100 since 1968. The track peaked at No. 7, making Tyla the highest-charting African female solo musician in Billboard history. The \"Water\" dance challenge on TikTok further pushed the track into the global sphere, and the song has been featured in over 1.5 million videos.\n\nThe widespread appeal of \"Water\" is a culmination of elements, notably a fusion of Western pop with subtler amapiano influences. The song melds sleek American R&B and pop compositions with the log drums and piano trails synonymous with the South African amapiano genre.\n\nRead more: 10 African GRAMMY Winners Through The Years: From Miriam Makeba To Angélique Kidjo & Burna Boy\n\nIndeed, most musical genres (regardless of continent of origin) draw inspiration from and contribute back to each other. The resulting music transcends regional boundaries and appeals globally — and Tyla's \"Water\" is proof of this resonance. Yet it also reflects how a major Western influence is often necessary for African music to transcend the continent.\n\nThe Recording Academy's new Category was designed to highlight \"strong elements of African cultural significance,\" said Shawn Thwaites, Recording Academy Awards Project Manager and author of the Category. In describing eligibility for the Best African Music Performance Category, Thwaites noted that songs must feature \"a stylistic intention, song structure, lyrical content and/or musical representation found in Africa and the African diaspora.\"\n\nStill, when it comes to recognizing lesser known genres — from South Africa's gqom to Tanzania’s singeli and Ghana’s asakaa — the global audience still has a long way to go.\n\n\"We need to go deeper and in more detail within different genres of music. We know there are multiple different types of music — hundreds of genres, in fact — coming from Africa and from all 54 countries on the continent,\" Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. told GRAMMY.com after his three trips to the vibrant continent. \"I'd love to see us be able to honor even more music from Africa and other areas of the world.\"\n\nThwaites hopes that celebrating the diversity of African music will also lead to greater cultural exchange. Eventually, this could lead to \"more collaborations between artists of different genres and more artist relations between labels and executives in America,\" he said.\n\nBut for this progression to happen correctly, there has to be a cultural education about the music within the continent and it's something Ghazi Shami, CEO/Founder of Empire Records, Distribution and Publishing — who consulted with the Recording Academy on the new Category — is looking forward to watching develop.\n\n\"I think we'll see expanded categories in African music in the years to come, but this is a great start toward recognizing the merits and impact of African music,\" he told GRAMMY.com prior to the ceremony.\n\nVictony, however, is no novice when it comes to putting out pristine bodies of work. His 2020 EP Saturn sounded nothing like a 19-year-old’s debut; singles “Jo Riddim” and “Space and Time” revealed serious sonic maturity. His subsequent EP Outlaw, which followed his breakout as the feature on Mayorkun’s “Holy Father,” included addictive hits “Apollo,” “Jolene,” and “Soweto.” The latter, of course, took the world by storm and led to a remix featuring Don Toliver and Rema, which peaked at No. 5 on the Billboard Afrobeats chart.\n\nBetween this, his debut on the ColorsxStudios platform, Burna Boy’s “Different Size,” and his record deal with the L.A.-based Encore Records, it is difficult to tell just when this young boy from Ojo, Lagos became a continental and global star. What’s more, he’s soon to push his story outside of Nigerian borders, kicking off his Stubborn North American tour on Aug. 6.\n\nAhead of this tour, Victony sat down with GRAMMY.com to discuss his creative process, the importance of telling his story, and all things Stubborn.\n\n'Stubborn' features excellent songwriting about your life experiences, though it's not the first time you've done so. What makes 'Stubborn' different from the other work in your discography?\n\nStubborn has my story; it’s where I get to properly introduce myself. The [Outlaw] EP is like Yeah, this guy can sing, he knows all this Afrobeats stuff. Let’s put a good body of work together for people to enjoy. The Stubborn album is saying, This is Victony. This is where he’s from. This is what he’s about.\n\nYou’ve mentioned before that veteran Nigerian rapper Olamide encouraged you to make 'Stubborn' a full-length album as opposed to an EP. Had you been ready for an era shift at the time that you spoke to him?\n\nI was prepared for an era shift, but my mind was just stuck on an EP because that was the plan since last year. Sometimes, you can’t even see what everything looks like when you’re really in it. You have to extract yourself from the situation and really look at it. But speaking to Olamide, once he mentioned the album, it felt possible. I was like, Why am I not even thinking about an album?\n\n'Stubborn' is an incredible testament to resilience, but you also explore other themes like love and betrayal. What is the overarching message that you wanted the project to convey?\n\nResilience is the boldest statement that the project has. But within all that, there are other things that I’ve been through, like the stuff that you mentioned, that didn’t change me as a person.\n\nI still have the ability to love, and I still have the ability to receive love. So obviously, that reflected in a few songs on the project because I still go through those emotions. I’m still human regardless of everything I've been through.\n\nYour feature list is quite expansive — we have Shorae Moore, Shallipoppi, Saint JHN, Teezo Touchdown, and Asake. Did you have an idea of who you wanted on the project beforehand, or was your feature selection process more organic?\n\nI’m always curious to see what this and this will sound like, or what doing this and this will look like. So I just make songs and think about who will be perfect on those songs. I didn’t think of it as, I want an album, who are the guest features?\n\nOne thing that the features all have is authenticity. These people have a voice, they have a style, they have something that they stand for. And that is something that Stubborn is also preaching — authenticity. So collaborating with these people helped to bring very interesting ideas to life. Because one wouldn’t ordinarily imagine a Victony and Asake feature, or a Victony and Teezo feature. But when somebody who is authentic collaborates with somebody who is authentic, something has to happen. We were just trying to create something, and I love creating.\n\nLearn more: Meet The Latest Wave Of Rising Afrobeats Stars: AMAARAE, BNXN, Oladapo & More\n\nYou have a U.S. tour coming up which is extremely exciting. You’ve toured with Rema before, but this will be your first-ever solo tour. How are you feeling?\n\nI’m actually very excited. We’ve been planning what we want the tour to feel like, because it’s important to think about the feeling that you want to leave people with. I think that this tour is the biggest opportunity to showcase what the album is really about. Having to go on stage, perform for an hour plus. I don’t think I've ever done that nine times in a row in nine cities. So we’re planning everything to make that all come to life.\n\nWhat do you want your U.S. audience to take away from your tour?\n\nI want my U.S. audience to feel the essence of my journey and connect with my music. This tour is a journey through my experiences and my evolution as an artist. You'll get the party anthems as well as the soul-stirring ballads. I want them to leave each show thinking, This is what that Victony guy is about: raw talent, authenticity, and a sound that resonates deeply.\n\nGive us your Afrobeats predictions for the year — what should we expect from the scene?\n\nI just feel like it’s about to be a madhouse. Tems just dropped, Ayra Starr just dropped, Ruger & BNXN just dropped. And Wizkid is yet to drop, Davido is yet to drop, Fireboy DML is yet to drop. I don’t think we’ve had a year like this. Ever. It’s like everybody is dropping a project this year.\n\nRead more: Tems On How 'Born In The Wild' Represents Her Story Of \"Survival\" & Embracing Every Part Of Herself\n\nMy prediction is that this is the start of something for Afrobeats. Before now, what people would tell you is that Afrobeats artists all share one fanbase. But everything is about to change because of the volume of music coming out. It’s going to really push structure with the fans.\n\nLooking back from your debut EP to the present day, what comes to mind? Did you foresee yourself becoming what you are now?\n\nI always knew that everything that’s currently happening would happen. I just didn’t know what was going to make it happen. I didn’t know that this was the direction. It’s been interesting because at one point, you just have life experiences that influence your art, and then the direction changes. That’s what it’s been for me because I like my art to reflect who I am at any given time.\n\nSo, who knows what’s going to happen next? After Saturn, I didn't foresee my story changing. And now new experiences have come, and those have also changed me. I don’t know what’s going to happen next, but one thing’s for sure, the journey is just beginning. I’m excited to see where this path leads and to continue sharing my story with the world.\n\nIf you were online during the summer of 2022, chances are you’ve heard Pheelz’s viral hit single \"Finesse.\" The swanky Afro-fusion track (featuring fellow Nigerian artist Bnxn) ushered in a world of crossover success for Pheelz, who began his career as a producer for the likes of Omah Lay, Davido, and Fireboy DML.\n\nBorn Phillip Kayode Moses, Pheelz’s religious upbringing in Lagos state contributed to his development as a musician. He manned the choir at his father’s church while actively working on his solo music. Those solo efforts garnered praise from his peers and music executives, culminating in Pheelz's debut EP in 2021. Hear Me Out saw Pheelz fully embrace his talent as a vocalist, songwriter, and producer.\n\n\"I feel important, like I’m just molding clay, and I have control over each decision,\" Pheelz tells GRAMMY.com about creating his own music.\n\n2022 saw the release of the first two tapes in his Pheelz Good trilogy: Pheelz Good I and Pheelz Good (Triibe Tape), which was almost entirely self-produced. The 29-year-old's consistency has paid off: he produced and sang on Usher’s \"Ruin,\" the lead single from his latest album Coming Home, and also produced the album's title track featuring Burna Boy. But Pheelz isn't only about racking up big-name collaborators; the self-proclaimed African rockstar's forthcoming projects will center on profound vulnerability and interpersonal honesty. First up: Pheelz Good II EP, out May 10, followed by a studio album in late summer.\n\nBoth releases will see the multi-hyphenate \"being unapologetically myself,\" Pheelz tells GRAMMY.com. \"It will also be me being as vulnerable as I can be. And it’s going to be me embracing my \"crayge\" [crazy rage]...being myself, and allowing my people to gravitate towards me.\"\n\nAhead of his new project, Pheelz spoke with GRAMMY.com about his transition from producer artist, designing all his own 3D cover art, his rockstar aesthetic, and what listeners can expect from Pheelz Good II.\n\nThis interview has been edited for clarity.\n\nWhat sparked your transition from singing in church to realizing your passion for creating music?\n\nFor me, it wasn’t really a transition. I just always loved making music so for me I felt like it was just wherever I go to make music, that’s where I wanna be. I would be in church and I was the choirmaster at some point in my life, so I would write songs for Sunday service as well. And then I would go to school as well and write in school, and people heard me and they would love it. And I would want to do more of that as well.\n\nA friend of my dad played some of my records for the biggest producers in Nigeria back then and took me on as an intern in his studio. I guess that’s the transition from church music into the industry. My brothers and sisters were in the choir, but that came with the job of being the children of the pastor, I guess. None of them really did music like me; I’m the only one who took music as a career and pursued it.\n\nYou made a name for yourself as a producer before ever releasing your music, earning Producer Of The Year at Nigeria’s Headies Awards numerous times. What finally pushed you to get into the booth?\n\nI’ve always wanted to get into the booth. The reason why I actually started producing was to produce beats for songs that I had written. I’ve always been in the booth, but always had something holding me back. Like a kind of subconscious feeling over what my childhood has been. I wasn’t really outspoken as a child growing up, so I wouldn’t want people to really hear me and would shy away from the camera in a sense. I think that stuck with me and held me back.\n\nBut then COVID happened and then I caught COVID and I’m like Oh my god and like that [snaps fingers] What I am doing? Why am I not going full steam? Like why do I have all this amazing awesomeness inside of me and no one gets to it because I’m scared of this or that?\n\nThere was this phrase that kept ringing in my head: You have to die empty. You can’t leave this earth with all of this gift that God has given you; you have to make sure you empty yourself. And since then, it’s just been back-to-back, which just gave me the courage.\n\nHow did you react to \" Finesse\" in former President Barack Obama’s annual summer playlist in 2022?\n\nBro, I reacted crazy but my dad went bananas. [Laughs.] I was really grateful for that moment, but just watching my dad react like that to that experience was the highlight of that moment for me. He's such a fan of Barack Obama and to see that his son’s music is on the playlist, it just made his whole month. Literally. He still talks about it to this day.\n\nExperiences like that just make me feel very grateful to be here. Life has really been a movie, just watching a movie and just watching God work and being grateful for everything.\n\nAt first he [my dad] [didn’t support my career] because every parent wants their child to be a doctor, a lawyer, or an engineer. But when he saw the hunger [I have], and I was stubborn with [wanting] to do music, he just had to let me do it. And now he’s my number one fan.\n\nYour latest single, \"Go Low\" arrived just in time for festival season. What was it like exploring the live elements of your art at SXSW and your headlining show in London at the end of April?\n\nI have always wanted to perform live. I’ve always loved performing; Pheelz on stage is the best Pheelz. Coming from church every Sunday, I would perform, lead prayers and worship, so I’ve always wanted to experience that again.\n\nHaving to perform live with my band around the world is incredible man. And I’ll forever raise the flag of amazing Afro live music because there’s a difference, you know? [Laughs.] There are so many elements and so many rhythms and so many grooves\n\nI’ve noticed that much of your recent cover art for your singles and EPs is animated or digitally crafted. What’s the significance, if any, of this stylistic choice?\n\nIt still goes back to my childhood because I wasn’t expressive as a child; I wouldn’t really talk or say how I felt. I’d rather write about it, write a song about it, write a poem about it, or draw about it. I’d draw this mask and then put how I’m feeling into that character, so if I was angry, the mask would be raging and just angry.\n\nThe angry ones were the best ones, so that stuck with me even after I started coming out of my shell and talking and being expressive; that act of drawing a mask still stuck with me. And then I got into 3D, and I made a 3D version of the mask and I made a 3D character of the mask. So I made that the main character, and then I just started making my lyric videos, again post-COVID, and making them [lyric videos] to the characters and making the actual video mine as well.\n\nIn the future, I’m gonna get into fashion with the characters, I’m gonna get into animation and cartoons and video games, but I just wanna take it one step at a time with the music first. So, in all of my lyric videos, you get to experience the characters. There’s a fight [scene] among them in one of the lyric videos called \"Ewele\"; there is the lover boy in the lyric video for \"Stand by You\"; there are the bad boys in the lyric video for \"Balling.\" They all have their own different characters so hopefully in the near future, I will get to make a feature film with them and just tell their story [and] build a world with them. I make sure I put extra energy into that, make most of them myself so the imprint of my energy is gonna be on it as well because it’s very important to me.\n\nYou and Usher have a lengthy working relationship. You first performed together in 2022 at the Global Citizen Festival, then produced/co-wrote \"Coming Home\" and \"Ruin.\" Take us through the journey of how you two began collaborating.\n\nIt started through a meeting with [Epic Records CEO] L.A. Reid; he was telling me about the album that they were working on for Usher and I’m like, \"Get me into the studio and lemme see what I can cook up.\" And they got me into the studio, [with Warner Records A&R] Marc Byers, and I wrote and produced \"Coming Home.\" I already had \"Ruin\" a year before that.\n\n[\"Ruin\"] was inspired by a breakup I just went through. Some of the greatest art comes from pain, I guess. That record was gonna be for my album but after I came home I saw how L.A. Reid and Usher reacted and how they loved it. I told them, \"I have this other song, and I think you guys would like it for this album.\" And I played \"Ruin,\" and the rest was history.\n\nBefore your upcoming EP, you’ve worked with Pharrell Williams, Kail Uchis, and the Chainsmokers in the studio. What do you consider when selecting potential collaborators?\n\nTo be honest, I did not look for these collabs. It was like life just brought them my way, because for me I’m open to any experience. I’m open to life; I do it the best I can at any moment, you understand?\n\nHaving worked with Pharrell now, Dr. Dre, Timbaland, and the Chainsmokers, I’m still shocked at the fact that this is happening. But ultimately, I am grateful for the fact that this is happening. I am proud of myself as well for how far I’ve come. Someone like Timbaland — they are literally the reason why I started producing music; I would literally copy their beats, and try to sound like them growing up.\n\n[Now] I have them in the same room talking, and we’re teaching and learning, making music and feeding off of each others’ energy. It’s a dream come true, literally.\n\nWhat's it like working with am electro-pop group like the Chainsmokers? How’d you keep your musical authenticity on \"PTSD\"?\n\nThat experiment [\"PTSD\"] was actually something I would play with back home. But the crazy thing is, it’s gonna be on the album now, not the EP. I would play it back home, like just trying to get the EDM and Afrohouse world to connect, cause I get in my Albert Einstein bag sometimes and just try and experiment. So when I met the Chainsmokers and like. \"Okay, this is an opportunity to actually do it now,\" and we had a very lengthy conversation.\n\nWe bonded first as friends before we went into the studio. We had an amazing conversation talking about music, [them] talking about pop and electronic music, and me talking about African music. So it was just a bunch of producers geeking out on what they love to do. And then we just talk through how we think the sound would be like really technical terms. Then we get into the studio and just bang it out. Hopefully, we get to make some more music because I think we can create something for the world together.\n\nI’ve noticed you dress a bit eccentrically. Have you always had this aesthetic?\n\nI’ve always dabbled in fashion. Even growing up, I would sketch for my sister and make this little clothing, so like I would kick up my uniform as well, make it baggy, make it flare pants, make it fly.\n\nI think that stuck with me until now, trying different things with fashion. And now I have like stylists I can talk to and throw ideas off of and create something together. So yeah, I want to get into the fashion space and see what the world has in store for me.\n\nWhat can fans expect as you’re putting the finishing touches on your upcoming EP Pheelz Good II and your album?\n\nPheelz Good II, [will be] a close to the Pheelz Good trilogy of Pheelz Good I, Pheelz Good Triibe Tape and Pheelz Good II. The album is going to be me being unapologetically myself still. But it will also be me being as vulnerable as I can be.\n\nIt’s going to be me embracing my crayge [crazy rage]. Like just embracing me unapologetically and being me, being myself, and allowing my people to gravitate towards me, you get me. But I’m working on some really amazing music that I am so proud of. I’m so proud of the EP and the album.\n\nMr. Eazi’s Gallery: How The Afrobeats Star Brought His Long-Awaited Album To Life With African Art"
