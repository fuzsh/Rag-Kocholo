        "text": "You might have playlists loaded up with your favourite artists on Spotify or Apple, but how much do you know about how the song was made, and why it was made? And what was happening in the world for the artist to need to create that particular track, or that concert that became a cultural moment?\n\nWhether you’re joining recording sessions with Taylor Swift, WHAM!, Lady Gaga, BLACKPINK, or Keith Richards, or sitting in on rehearsals for Beyoncé’s iconic Coachella performance, getting to know the process and context of an artist whose work has valiantly soundtracked your own life is an act that takes the music itself even further, giving you a greater appreciation for the tracks in your pocket. That's where documentaries come in. At the very least, you’ll have something smug to tell your friends about next time you’re listening to a song.\n\nNetflix has a bunch of strong music documentaries, with some particularly standout films ready to stream, from Martin Scorsese's spin on the shape-shifting of Bob Dylan to the much-talked-about Miss Americana. Each comes practically brimming with music, along with behind-the-scenes interviews and footage of some of the most prolific artists of our time.\n\nWithout leaving your house, here’s your ticket to the best documentary films about music that you can find on Netflix, in no particular order…\n\n1. WHAM!\n\nMaking the sun shine brighter than Doris Day. Credit: Netflix\n\nDespite the fact that you'll probably have that infernal holiday earworm \"Last Christmas\" stuck in your head for a month after watching this doc on the '80s British pop super two-some consisting of George Michael and Andrew Ridgeley, it's still worth the risk! The latter name being the best reason why — we've all heard Michael's story by now, but Sr. director Chris Smith finally gives \"the other one\" Ridgeley the focus he deserves as the co-songwriter on all the duo's hits.\n\nWith the '80s feeling further away with every passing year (not to mention every passing superstar of the time), this doc will send you right back to those heady days of pegged jeans and puffy stickers. That \"Careless Whisper\" sax solo for the win. — Jason Adams, Entertainment Reporter\n\nHow to watch: WHAM! is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n2. Homecoming\n\nBow down. Credit: Netflix\n\nWhen you think of landmark concert films of the last ten years, Homecoming immediately springs to mind. Directed, written, and executive produced by Beyoncé, the electrifying two-hour film captures the creation and performance of the superstar’s unforgettable 2018 Coachella set, putting you both behind the scenes and centre stage of this historic cultural moment.\n\nSet on a now-iconic bespoke pyramid stage, Beyoncé’s set pays tribute to the creative spirit of Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) and features special guest appearances by Destiny's Child, Jay-Z, and Solange. Bow down, indeed.\n\nHow to watch: Homecoming is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n3. Hate To Love: Nickelback\n\nCanadians have a reputation for being incredibly nice people. So, how did the Canadian rock group Nickelback go from being chart-topping hitmakers selling 50 million records to a much-loathed punchline in basically the span of a decade? Hate To Love, the 2023 doc from filmmaker Leigh Brooks, takes a look at the band's career and tries to answer that question. Ultimately, it really seems beyond the group's control; sure, they make generic music, but so do 90 percent of the mainstream artists out there. Nickelback's problem is they became a meme, and there's really no coming back from that. But hey, it could be worse. They're rich as hell, and at least they're not Creed! — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: Hate To Love: Nickelback is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n4. Miss Americana\n\n\"Miss Americana\" is not just for fans. Credit: Netflix\n\nWhether you're a fan of Taylor Swift or just curious about her meteoric rise to fame, Miss Americana allows you a rare peek into the pop superstar's life. Director Lana Wilson crafts an intimate portrait of Swift, through plenty of interviews and behind-the-scenes footage, taking you into the songwriting sessions of her album Lover, backstage on the spectacular Reputation tour, through her relatively short journey from teen country singer to global superstar, through the sexual assault lawsuit she won against radio host David Mueller, and the breaking of her political silence.\n\nBut more than anything, the film makes plain that our loud opinion is the last thing that matters to Swift. As Mashable's Angie Han writes, \"Maybe it's not the movie everyone wanted. Maybe this latest reinvention of Taylor Swift, this time as a woman who's comfortable enough in her power to wield it fully, isn't for everyone, either. But maybe, also, that's the idea: Swift, Miss Americana tells us, is done worrying about what everyone else thinks.\"\n\nWhen you're done, watch the Reputation tour film on Netflix, knowing the story behind the scenes.* — S.C.\n\nHow to watch: Miss Americana is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n5. ReMastered: Tricky Dick and the Man in Black\n\nCo-directed by Sara Dosa and legendary documentarian Barbara Kopple (Harlan County, USA), this is a look back at the 1970 White House performance by country music firebrand Johnny Cash. The president at the time was none other than Richard M. Nixon, making this meeting the equivalent of spraying gasoline on a freshly lit fire. It's not hard to see in retrospect that these two gentlemen would never in a million years get along, so how the heck did this happen?\n\nThis was all Nixon's brilliant idea; he saw similarities in their poor childhoods and, more importantly, a possible political goldmine in associating himself with the God-fearing, down-home crowd that Cash represented. Cash is, of course, a far more complicated figure, and his sympathy for the underdogs and the downtrodden mixed with the horrors of the Vietnam War were at that moment in history reaching a boiling point. What happened when Cash walked into the White House that day makes for some truly combustible historical entertainment. – J.A.\n\nHow to watch: ReMastered: Tricky Dick and the Man in Black is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n6. Rolling Thunder Revue\n\nBob Dylan and Allen Ginsberg visit Jack Kerouac's grave. Credit: Netflix\n\nHalf-real and half-phony just like the musician that inspired it, Martin Scorsese’s 2019 pseudo-documentary Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story by Martin Scorsese (which is its full title) puts actual footage of Bob Dylan’s 1975 tour through the Northwest and Canada alongside faked interviews and footage, and leaves it up to the viewer to discern which is what. Did Dylan really put on white face after seeing KISS perform? Was Sharon Stone really a groupie turned costumer in her teenage years?\n\nAdd to this the fact that most of the real footage from the tour was filmed by Dylan himself for a semi-fictional and unreleased film called Renaldo and Clara, which complicates the original confusion further. Like the best Dylan song, this Revue contains meta multitudes. — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: Rolling Thunder Revue is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n7. Quincy\n\n\"Quincy\" moves through the decades of music alongside Jones' own life story. Credit: Arnold Turner / Getty Images for Netflix\n\nOver 2,900 songs and over 300 albums recorded. 51 film and TV scores. Over 1,000 original compositions. 79 Grammy nominations and 27 wins. You get it, yet? Quincy Jones has been busy for the last 70 years. Created by his daughter Rashida Jones with Alan Hicks, Quincy examines the immense impact the record producer, arranger, and musician has had on music over the last seven decades. It’s mostly narrated by Quincy himself, with archival audio from famous friends like Ray Charles and Frank Sinatra, alongside a treasure trove of home footage and new material.\n\nIt’s fascinating to watch just how much of the history of modern music Jones has been a part of, and how many \"firsts\" he achieved as a Black musician and producer in America. Quincy moves through the decades of music alongside Jones' own life story — he discovered music amongst a hard childhood on the South Side of Chicago during the Great Depression in the '30s, before diving into the be-bop scene in New York in the ‘50s. Then, he moved through pop, funk, jazz, and disco in the ‘70s and ‘80s in Los Angeles, and through the hip hip explosion in the ‘90s. Keep an eye out for the short but powerful heart-to-heart between Quincy and Kendrick Lamar.— S.C.\n\nHow to watch: Quincy is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n8. I'll Sleep When I'm Dead\n\nParty after party, scene after scene, cake after cake. Credit: Caesar Sebastian / Netflix\n\nSuperstar EDM artist Steve Aoki once played 300 shows in a single year, and that’s the breathless spirit this 2016 doc from filmmaker Justin Krook aims to capture.\n\nThe son of the Japanese wrestler turned Benihana restaurant entrepreneur Rocky Aoki, Steve gives more than a hint that his entire propulsive career has been a rebuke to his father’s lackluster parenting skills. But the lulls between the chaos come few and far between — much like Aoki's life and much like he seems to prefer it. Like the documentary's title suggests, this is party after party, scene after scene, and cake after cake after cake smashed in his fans' eager faces, with sleep rendered an extreme afterthought. — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: I'll Sleep When I'm Dead is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n9. Biggie: I Got a Story to Tell\n\nBiggie with 50 Grand. Credit: George DuBose\n\nA compelling, personal portrait of one of the greatest rappers of all time, Biggie: I Got A Story To Tell is an intimate look at the life of Christopher Wallace, AKA The Notorious B.I.G., whose death at 24 years old has also become the stuff of legend. But although the film starts at a tragic end, it actually concentrates more on Wallace's life through those who really knew him.\n\nDirected by Emmett Malloy and made in collaboration with Biggie's estate, the documentary features a huge amount of backstage, onstage, and on-the-road footage filmed by his best friend Damion \"D-Roc\" Butler, alongside interviews with family, including his wife Faith Evans, mother Violetta Wallace, grandmother Gwendolyn Wallace, uncle Dave Wallace, and friends from both childhood and later years. It was co-executive produced by Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, who also appears. Especially unique to this documentary is the short time spent on Wallace's visits to family in Jamaica, and unexpected musical influences — interviews with his neighbour, saxophonist Donald Harrison, about the impact of bebop and jazz on his rap techniques are a treat. — S.C.\n\nHow to watch: Biggie: I Got a Story to Tell is now streaming on Netflix.\n\nMashable Top Stories\n\nStay connected with the hottest stories of the day and the latest entertainment news.\n\nSign up for Mashable's Top Stories newsletter\n\nBy signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\n10. Shania Twain: Not Just a Girl\n\nIt's your perogative to watch this. Credit: Jim Bennett / Getty Images\n\nShe’s still the one we run to! Taking a page from the book of Tina Turner is never a bad idea, and country/pop superstar Shania Twain seems to've lifted the best page of all, having moved to a gorgeous house set against the majestic scenery of Lake Geneva, Switzerland. That’s where she’s mainly interviewed for this 2022 doc on her career, and where she talks about many of such influences — the earliest being Dolly Parton, because of course. Still holding the title of the best-selling studio album by a solo female artist ever for Come On Over in 1997 (it’s the ninth best-selling album of all time), Shania, smart, grounded, and funny, still impresses us much. — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: Shania Twain: Not Just a Girl is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n11. What Happened, Miss Simone?\n\nNina Simone's life was not an easy one. Credit: Netflix\n\nWhat do you know about Nina Simone? You’re about to learn a lot in this exceptional documentary about the singer, classical pianist, and Black Power activist, whose life was no easy path.\n\nDirected by Liz Garbus and tightly woven with Simone's music, What Happened, Miss Simone? examines the star’s public career and private life, her childhood in segregated North Carolina, her survival of domestic abuse, her struggle with addiction, the experience of living with undiagnosed bipolar disorder, revelations of abuse against her daughter, and her role in the civil rights movement and its impact on her career. This Best Documentary nominee will leave you with a complex picture of Miss Simone, and a thorough understanding of the impact of a song like \"Mississippi Goddamn\" on the music industry, on society, and on the artist herself. — S.C.\n\nHow to watch: What Happened Miss Simone? is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n12. The Other One: The Long, Strange Trip of Bob Weir\n\nCredit: Netflix\n\n\"You have to see it to see it,\" says Bob Weir, famed guitarist for legendary jam-band The Grateful Dead. And he’s not wrong — this 2014 doc from director Mike Fleiss (God Bless Ozzy Osbourne) trains its lens on the less famous member of the famous outfit in order to chart a lesser known voyage through rock history, and unearths all sorts of hidden gems from the road that was.\n\nRunning in at just 85 minutes, the film might be shorter than some of the Dead’s guitar solos, but it manages to capture that certain something that kept people coming back, and back, and back to the band for decades. Memories that are probably otherwise lost to many of the people who experienced it! — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: The Other One: The Long, Strange Trip of Bob Weir is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n13. BLACKPINK: Light Up the Sky\n\nHow much do you actually know about BLACKPINK? Credit: Netflix\n\nYou might have watched their videos, seen them live, or just watched this superstar K-pop group smash records all over the joint, but how much do you actually know about BLACKPINK? Directed by Caroline Suh, Light Up the Sky is a fascinating, fun, and sincere portrait of one of the biggest groups in the world right now.\n\nAmid behind-the-scenes footage of early auditions, childhood home movies, recording sessions, and touring, including that historic Coachella performance, the documentary sits you down with Lisa, Jisoo, Jennie, and Rosé, the four members of YG Entertainment's wildly popular South Korean girl group. These frank solo interviews, along with their heartfelt reflections on each other's roles in the group, give insight into these talented, determined young women who worked incredibly hard for years in YG's rigorous training program, debuting with chart-smashing single \"Whistle,\" and building their meteoric rise to fame (with all the perfectionist pressure that comes with it). — S.C.\n\nHow to watch: BLACKPINK: Light Up the Sky is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n14. Duran Duran: There's Something You Should Know\n\nDubbed \"Birmingham’s peacocks\" by none other than Boy George himself, the members of Duran Duran strutted their way to enormous stadium-filling fame in the 1980s. Led by their sneeringly sexy frontman Simon Le Bon, this fab foursome from England — who took their name from the movie Barbarella, of all places — blew up the New Romantic scene thanks to their unforgettable made-for-MTV videos. Hits like \"Girls on Film,\" \"Rio,\" and \"Hungry Like the Wolf\" ended up defining the era. This 2018 doc from director Zoe Dobson watches as the boys, here in their sixties, look back on their career album by album, still peacocking as much as ever. — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: Duran Duran: There's Something You Should Know is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n15. Halftime\n\nJ-Lo fans, assemble. Credit: Noam Galai/Getty Images\n\nJennifer Lopez has been entertaining us for decades, so you should take a second for Halftime. The documentary is focused on Lopez's SuperBowl halftime show with Shakira (and her daughter Emme) in 2020 that made a public statement about the border crisis, but also takes in the artist's career over the decades, from her beginnings in the '90s as a Fly Girl on In Living Colour to her incredible performance as pop star Selena Quintanilla-Pérez in the lauded biopic, to her Grammy-winning music career and its eras, to her critically acclaimed and Golden Globe nominated role in Hustlers.\n\nDirected by Amanda Micheli and edited by Carol Martori, Lopez maintains full control in this documentary, having not always felt this way across her career and speaking at length about being underestimated and not taken seriously. Halftime brings the receipts too, showing the unbridled racism and sexism she's endured from the press and entertainment industry. Despite it all, Lopez continues to kick every goal.\n\nHow to watch: Halftime is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n16. Clive Davis: The Soundtrack of our Lives\n\nAn idealized portrait but fascinating nonetheless. Credit: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images\n\nA hagiography can be just what the doctor ordered sometimes, when the subject demands such respect. And when it comes to the music industry, the legendary producer Clive Davis – the man behind Janis Joplin, Bruce Springsteen, Barry Manilow, Patti Smith, Alicia Keys, and his right-hand lady Whitney Houston, just to get us started — warrants a good old fashioned love-fest.\n\nBy all accounts a decent man (at least by all the accounts that they put on the screen here) blessed with a \"golden ear\", Davis knew how to find and nurture talent and take them to the top of the charts time and time and time again. And his story will make you long for the simplicity of his old-fashioned, personal, one-on-one approach, when everything wasn’t quite so soullessly corporate. — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: Clive Davis: The Soundtrack of Our Lives is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n17. Lewis Capaldi: How I'm Feeling Now\n\nA powerful portrait. Credit: Netflix\n\nScotland's celebrated and Grammy-nominated purveyor of fine sad songs, Lewis Capaldi's natural charm, candour, and signature cheeky humour make this documentary both an absolute treat and a deeply moving portrait. Directed by Joe Pearlman, How I'm Feeling Now checks in with Capaldi in Whitburn, Scotland, with 15 billion streams and sold out shows in 36 countries under his belt. He's writing his second album in his parents' shed, the follow-up to his incredibly successful debut Divinely Uninspired to a Hellish Extent, amid varying lockdowns around the world. Between reflections on fame, writing, and performing, the documentary paints a wonderful picture of Capaldi in his hometown; you'll meet Capaldi's parents, family, and friends, paired with plenty of sweet home movies and studio session recordings brimming with pure talent.\n\nNotably, having filmed with Capaldi during his experience with anxiety, ticks, and being diagnosed with Tourette's syndrome, Pearlman's documentary is an emotional, vulnerable, and powerful journey through some of the most challenging times in the artist's past few years. It's something Capaldi commented on after the film was released. \"I didn’t realise how much my anxiety and Tourette's was taking over my life until I watched [the footage] back,\" he told The Independent. \"When I saw the first draft, it was so depressing, I was surprised I didn’t die at the end! I mean, there’s always the sequel.\"\n\nHow to watch: Lewis Capaldi: How I'm Feeling Now is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n18. Barbra: The Music The Mem'ries The Magic\n\nBarbra! Credit: Steve Jennings / WireImage for BSB\n\nIt's Barbra doing what Barbra does best: belting out big music while running a single fingernail through her hair. This concert film from Streisand’s 2015 string of nine shows was filmed in Miami and the Golden Girls vibes are strong with her shimmery black pantsuit and string of special guest stars. We see a little backstage footage — hey there’s James Brolin, hey there’s her pampered pup — but mostly it’s just Barbra hitting the stage, beginning right off the bat with “The Way We Were” and not stopping the hit parade for nearly two straight hours. She tells some stories, she disco-dances, she says she’s on a diet but she wants the ice cream anyway. It’s all the hits! — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: Barbra: The Music The Mem’ries The Magic is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n19. Gaga: Five Foot Two\n\nEssential viewing for Gaga fans. Credit: Netflix\n\nHead into the studio with Lady Gaga amid the making of her fifth album, Joanne, in this characteristically raw, compelling documentary released in 2017 — before the \"Shallow\" madness, though there’s a lovely fleeting moment when she gets the part in A Star Is Born in there, too. ahs\n\nDirected by Chris Moukarbel, Gaga: Five Foot Two follows the superstar during the recording of her album with Mark Ronson (and for one excellent minute, \"Hey Girl\" collaborator Florence Welsh), and ahead of her Super Bowl halftime performance, all peppered with a stream of reflections on love, work, and self-confidence — all while living with chronic pain. But as Joanne is an album inspired by the death of her aunt Joanne, it also fittingly offers some moving glimpses into her family life.\n\nHow to watch: Gaga: Five Foot Two is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n20. Keith Richards: Under the Influence\n\nKeith Richards: a happier bullshitter you will never see. Credit: Jane Rose / Netflix\n\nIn Metric’s song \"Gimme Sympathy,\" the band asks the question: \"Who would you rather be / The Beatles or the Rolling Stones?\" Would you rather burn big and bright and fast, or long and steady, perhaps past your moment? This 2015 doc on Stones guitarist Keith Richards makes a good case for the latter.\n\nWatching Richards in the process of making his first solo record in several decades, Under the Influence (directed by 20 Feet From Stardom director Morgan Neville) is mainly just for Stones fans — thankfully, that’s a not small percentage of the population. Richards more than lives up to his status as the hard-living rock star with a parade of well-worn tales entertainingly re-told — five decades into his career and a happier bullshitter you will never see. Did Richards ever tell you about the time Chuck Berry famously popped him one? \"I was one of Chuck’s greatest hits,\" he laughs. — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: Keith Richards: Under the Influence is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n21. Ariana Grande: Excuse Me, I Love You\n\nAriana Grande's \"Sweetener World Tour\" at The O2 Arena on Aug. 17, 2019 in London. Credit: Kevin Mazur / Getty Images for AG\n\nReleased during the 2020 pandemic lockdowns, this one was a shining light for live music fans missing concerts at the time — and it remains a gorgeous example of how to film a live show. Shot at London's O2 Arena for Netflix during Ariana Grande's 2019 Sweetener World Tour, Excuse Me, I Love You is the concert film that'll remind you of those large-scale collective scream sessions many of us used to indulge in. As Mashable's Rachel Thompson writes, the film is \"a love letter to the Time Before. A time when singers pointed their mics to packed arenas, giggling as ecstatic crowds chanted back their lyrics word for word. A time when we'd throw our arms in the air and yell \"encore\" before pouring our weary bodies onto the last train home.\"\n\nFeaturing pitch-perfect performances of tracks from Grande's hit-heavy albums including thank u, next, Dangerous Woman, and of course, Sweetener, the film also throws in some fun footage of Grande with her crew on the road.\n\nHow to watch: Ariana Grande: Excuse Me, I Love You is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n22. The Greatest Night in Pop\n\nFollowing the creation of the gargantuan 1985 charity single \"We Are the World\" from conception to total chart dominance, this 2024 doc from director Bao Nguyen takes us behind that inescapable music. Along the way, we get also get a peek at the massive musician egos that had to get in sync to make it happen. It's sweaty, riveting, and funny stuff. (So sweaty!)\n\nThe film mainly focuses on footage of the epic recording session that happened on the night of January 28th, 1985. Quincy Jones and co-writers Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie pounded out their ear-worm tune, then used their influence to strong-arm the singing roster — which included Ray Charles, Billy Joel, Diana Ross, Cyndi Lauper, Bob Dylan, and many, many more — into spending their night making the world a better place. Promo and merch for the song, which was unavoidable that year, has ultimately raised over 80 million dollars for African famine relief. — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: The Greatest Night in Pop is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n23. It's Only Life After All\n\nAmy Ray and Emily Saliers, better known as the Indigo Girls, began making music together as teens in Decatur, Georgia. Since releasing their first full-length album in 1987, they've been working together steadily and successfully for over forty years. Their songwriting prowess is second only to their frank political passion and acoustic guitar skills.\n\nDirector Alexandria Bombach somehow managed to whittle 1,000 hours of footage (!!!!) down into two fleeting hours — including home movies and present-day interviews — illustrating how (and perhaps more importantly, why) these mavericks gathered a profoundly loyal following that rivals that of the Grateful Dead. This doc will have you feeling much, much closer to fine. — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: It's Only Life After All is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n24. The Black Godfather\n\nCredit: Netflix\n\n\"Life is about numbers. Nothing else.\" That was one of the catchphrases of Clarence Avant, the music executive who ultimately proved his catchphrase's truth through the sheer number of legends that director Reginald Hudlin was able to corral for this 2019 doc.\n\nAnd it's not just iconic musicians like Bill Withers, Quincy Jones, Clive Davis, and Lionel Richie who speak glowingly about Avant's influence on their lives; it's politicians like Barack Obama and Kamala Harris too, since Avant was also a massive Democratic fundraiser. The footprint that Avant left on culture — he passed away in 2023 at the ripe young age of 92 — is immeasurable. This doc proves to be a vital portrait of a person who worked behind the scenes to actualize real and lasting change in the world. — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: The Black Godfather is now streaming on Netflix.\n\n25. Hans Zimmer: Hollywood Rebel\n\nSure, maybe it's weird to have various sound effects that come to mind when people hear your name, but Hans Zimmer doesn't give a \"BRAAAM!\" In case you're curious, that's the infamous sound from his score for Christopher Nolan's Inception, and it's become something of an aural meme. The German composer has been Nolan's go-to guy since The Dark Knight; he's also composed scores for everything from Twister and Cool Runnings to Rain Man (which won him his first Oscar nomination) and Dune: Part One (which got him his second Oscar). His career stretches all the way back to Stephen Frears' classic 1985 gay romance My Beautiful Laundrette, starring Daniel Day-Lewis, for goodness' sake. He was even in the first music video MTV ever aired!\n\nZimmer is very nearly as celebrated and iconic a cinematic sound-man as John Williams himself, and this hour-long doc does a grand job peering into his colorful and atypical process. And that's no \"BRAAAM.\" — J.A.\n\nHow to watch: Hans Zimmer: Hollywood Rebel is now streaming on Netflix.\n\nUPDATE: Aug. 1, 2024, 6:02 p.m. UTC This list was originally published on Sept. 4, 2020.
