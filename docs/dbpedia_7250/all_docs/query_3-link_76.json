        "text": "Tell It To My HeartTaylor Dayne\n\nThe guy who wrote \"Tell It To My Heart\" owns a collection of famous baseballs, including the one that went through Bill Buckner's legs.\n\nGangnam StylePsy\n\nYouTube were forced into an upgrade after PSY's \"Gangnam Style\" broke the video-sharing website's hit counter. Once the tune reached 2,147,483,647 views, the maximum positive value for a 32-bit signed binary integer in computing, the view-counter could no longer work.\n\nI Will Always Love YouWhitney Houston\n\nDolly Parton is just fine with Whitney Houston's cover of \"I Will Always Love You.\" Said Parton: \"She can have the credit. I just want my cash.\"\n\nI Walk The LineJohnny Cash\n\nJohnny Cash promised to stay true to his first wife in \"I Walk The Line,\" but when the song became a hit he found himself on the road, having an affair with June Carter, who became his second wife.\n\nAchy Breaky HeartBilly Ray Cyrus\n\n\"Achy Breaky Heart\" was originally recorded in 1991 by The Marcy Brothers as \"Don't Tell My Heart.\" That original version had the lyrics: \"Don't tell my heart, my achy, breakin' heart...\"\n\nMambo No 5 (A Little Bit Of)Lou Bega\n\nThe party tune \"Mambo No 5 (A Little Bit Of)\" was the theme song for the 2000 Democratic Convention (the party of Bill Clinton), until someone noticed the line, \"A little bit of Monica in my life.\"\n\nWho's Johnny, And Why Does He Show Up In So Many SongsSong Writing\n\nFor songwriters, Johnny represents the American man. He has been angry, cool, magic, a rebel and, of course, marching home.\n\nThey Might Be GiantsSongwriter Interviews\n\nWho writes a song about a name they found in a phone book? That's just one of the everyday things these guys find to sing about. Anything in their field of vision or general scope of knowledge is fair game. If you cross paths with them, so are you."
