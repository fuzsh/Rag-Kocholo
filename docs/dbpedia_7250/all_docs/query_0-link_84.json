They found themselves gaining regional notoriety in May 1966 with their first single “Please Don’t Ever Change” on CFCF radio. The follow-up, “I Can’t Go On”, was released in September 1966 but did not receive any chart action. But, by January 1967 they were once again at the top of the charts with “A Someday Fool” which saw them hit Top10. The buzz on the group led to the prospect of recording a full-length LP in Texas which never materialized. Their fortunes changed for the worse, members abandoned ship and eventually the group changed its name to Graham Powers & The Escorts before calling it quits in the late 1960’s; Powers would move behind the scenes as a record executive at CBS Records and MCA Records. He died March 22, 2019; Billy Bryans died of cancer in April 23, 2012. with notes from Andre Gibeault and Dave Stacey.\n\nSingles\n\n1966 Please Don’t Ever Change/Sorry To Hear (REO/Quality) 8936\n\n1967 A Someday Fool/It’s Too Long (REO/Quality) 8975\n\n1967 I Can’t Go On/Next To Nowhere (REO/Quality) 8998\n\nM² AC\n\nMichael Murphy (vocal, guitar) / André Lavoie (guitar, vocal) / Claude Piché (bass) / Michel Gagnon (drums) / Paul Jocelyn (drums) / Yves “Bala” Blais (drums)\n\nA Yé Yé band from Sorel, Québec.\n\nSingles\n\n1967 La Course/Monsieur Martin (Citation) CN-9024\n\nM-APPEAL\n\nBorn: Tina Savoie in 1970 in Milton, Nova Scotia.\n\nM-Appeal (aka Mass Appeal) is a dance artist from Nova Scotia.

The band worked with producer Stacy Heydon on a four song recording they released as a cassette entitled ‘Fourplay’. One song from the sessions, “Evelaine”, landed them on Q107’s annual Homegrown album Volume 7 in 1985. In 1986 Brockway left to tour with Lee Aaron and Zon bassist Jim Samson was brought in as a replacement. Mach IV then rechristened itself as a Foreigner tribute band and revived the name of Sutherland’s old tribute to Foreigner as The Dirty White Boys. Urgent’s old live keyboardist, John McGoldrick, was then added in 1987. The band lasted until 1990; Hunt and Samson would go on to join a reformed version of Moxy in the late 1990s. with notes from Kim Hunt and Scott Sutherland.\n\nAlbums\n\n1985 Fourplay [cassette] (independent)\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1985 “Evelaine” on ‘Q107 Homegrown Album Volume 7’ (MCA) MCA-37272\n\nMacISAAC, Ashley\n\nBorn: Ashley Dwayne MacIsaac on February 24, 1975 in Creignish, Cape Breton Island\n\nAlthough raised around traditional Celtic music and fiddling, it was MacIsaac’s unique style of “grunge violin” that earned him an early notice in ‘Time Magazine’ around the time of the release of ‘Hi”! How Are You Today?’ At the end of 1996, Ashley MacIsaac was taken off Maclean’s honour roll of Canadians for his explicit descriptions of his sexual preferences, prompting some to denounce the national news magazine as homophobic. None of this hampered his popularity, however. By the end of March1997, approximately 300,000 copies of ‘Hi”! How Are You Today?’ had been sold and MacIsaac had successfully toured the U.S. which included a highly publicized appearance on ‘Late Night with Conan O’Brien’. For his next album, ‘Fine, Thank You Very Much’, he returned to his traditional Celtic roots. The album sold considerably less than its predecessor. In the fall of 1998, he went to Japan to appear in a feature film titled ‘First Love’. In it, MacIsaac plays an Irishman who comes to Okinawa to find his true love, a Japanese opera singer. The movie was released in 1999. MacIsaac also recorded half a dozen fiddle tunes for the soundtrack. In August of 1999, MacIsaac parted ways with his label Universal Music to sign with Loggerhead Records, a boutique label distributed by Universal and soon released the album ‘Helter’s Celtic’. Controversy surrounded MacIsaac for the next few years with obscenity-filled outbursts, public battles with his label, Loggerhead, plus threats of personal bankruptcy followed by his actual bankruptcy. In 2003 he sued the Ottawa Citizen for an ironic racist comment he made that had been taken out of context by the newspaper. He then signed with major independent label Linus Entertainment to refocus his life towards music and formed a band to back him on the 2006 album ‘Pride’. That year he announced he was entering politics and declared himself a candidate for the Liberal leadership race. He never followed through with the plan. In 2008, MacIsaac auctioned off 50% of all his future earnings on auction website eBay. The bidding ended at over $1.5 million. MacIsaac performed at the opening ceremonies for the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver and released his most recent album, ‘Crossover’, in 2011; MacIsaac’s cousins Alexis MacIsaac, Wendy MacIsaac and Natalie MacMaster are also professional fiddlers. MacIsaac is a distant cousin of Jack White (The White Stripes). MacIsaac would open for The White Stripes concert in Glace Bay during the White Stripes’ Arctic tour in 2007.\n\nSingles\n\n1995 The Devil In the Kitchen/The Gladstone/Christie Campbell [w/JALE] (Ancient) MAC-1\n\n1995 Square Dance Song (I Wanna Go Higher) [w/BKS]\n\n1995 Sleepy Maggie (Ancient) MAC-CD2\n\n1996 Brenda Stubbert\n\n2002 Lay Me Down\n\nAlbums\n\n1993 A Cape Breton Christmas with Ashley MacIsaac & Friends (Ancient ) RT-19\n\n1995 Hi!

She later adopted her father’s middle name, MacKenzie, when she moved to the US in 1951. She demonstrated her gift for music early by playing the piano when she was only two years old. Her family took her musical gifts seriously (her mother was a musicians), and soon, she was playing the violin and learning to sing. Her first violin recital was at a Winnipeg hotel. After formal training at the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, MacKenzie found herself entertaining troops during World War II, where she met Robert Shuttleworth, a lieutenant who was a bandleader in the Royal Canadian Navy. He told her to look him up after the war. She did, and he hired her as a violinist, pianist and vocalist with his band. He became her manager and, eventually, husband and father of her two children – MacKenzie “Mac” Shuttleworth and Gisele “Gigi” (Downs). In 1946, her rich contralto singing voice caught the attention of the CBC, which resulted in her own quarter-hour radio show, ‘Meet Gisele.’ The folks at Campbell’s Soups heard the show, and offered her a position on their US radio show, “Club 15” with Bob Crosby (Bing’s brother), where she alternated with Jo Stafford, and also was selected by Mario Lanza as the female vocalist on his ‘Coke Time’ radio show. During her time in Hollywood, the ambitious MacKenzie found time for other creative activities. She recorded songs for Capitol Records, appeared at top Las Vegas night clubs, and was a regular on Mario Lanza’s radio program. While Bob Crosby was away due to the death of his sister-in-law (Bing Crosby’s wife Dixie), Jack Benny substituted as host for ‘Club 15’ where he met Gisele for the first time. What neither she nor Benny remembered was that he had been a guest on MacKenzie’s ‘Meet Gisele’ Canadian radio show some years earlier with Benny recording his part in Hollywood. Gisele MacKenzie also appeared as a guest on the ‘Jack Benny Show’ once or twice a year. In 1953 she did a summer tour with Jack Benny and Sammy Davis, Jr. Benny then learned that June Valli was leaving ‘Your Hit Parade’ TV show and turned one of his shows into an audition for Gisele MacKenzie. Shows were sponsored by Lucky Strike cigarettes and so Benny made sure ‘Hit Parade’s’ producers and the sponsors were viewing his show. MacKenzie got the job. MacKenzie was a star of ‘Your Hit Parade’, along with Snooky Lanson, Russell Arms and Dorothy Collins, from the Fall of 1953 through the spring of 1957 where they counted down the Top 7 songs of the week, and also offered two oldies, called ‘Extras’, to fill out the programme. Her success on the show coincided with her own personal recording triumphs. In 1955, she became the first Hit Parader to sing her own personal number one hit (for thirteen weeks), “Hard To Get,” on the show. At the end of the 1957 season, ‘Your Hit Parade’ decided to fire the entire cast, except Gisele. But Gisele announced she wouldn’t return to the show under any conditions and went on to star on NBC-TV’s “The Gisele MacKenzie Show” (1957-1958) which was co-produced by Jack Benny’s program. Her guests included Dean Martin, Eddie Fisher, Ronald Reagan, Boris Karloff, and Jimmy Rodgers among others. Besides television and recording projects, she toured the country in musical stage productions such as ‘The King And I’, ‘Mame’ and ‘Gypsy’ since the 1960’s. She later was a regular on ‘The Sid Caesar Show,’ a 1963 ABC comedy-variety show. Later still she had guest spots on ‘Studio One,’ ‘The Hollywood Squares,’ ‘Murder, She Wrote,’ ‘MacGyver’ and ‘Boy Meets World.’ She retired from showbiz and lived in North Hollywood keeping herself busy by appearing on television talk shows and doing commercials until her death at the age of 76 from colon cancer on September 5, 2003. with notes from Pål C.

The duo began performing in 1972 when both were around 29 years old. The Guess Who’s Burton Cummings grew up with the brothers and on 1972’s ‘Live At the Paramount’ album by the Guess Who the band performed MacLean & MacLean’s “Glace Bay Blues”. The duo were best known for their raunchy, often scatological humour, combined with renditions of traditional folk, pop, and original songs. In 1974 they were signed to GRT Records and Lighthouse drummer Skip Prokop produced their debut album, ‘Toilet Rock’, which was recorded live at the comedy club The Chimney in Toronto, Ontario. Their second album, ‘Bitter Reality’, was a split live recording – produced by Jack Richardson (The Guess Who) – and studio recording produced by Burton Cummings. By the time the album was finished Cummings’ management attempted to have two off-colour comedy bits featuring Cummings removed fearing it would damage his career and that of the Guess Who. The action delayed the album’s release. However, the controversy made it to the media and a Toronto radio station played leaked versions of the album on one of their late-night comedy programs. The album was released, as is, in 1976, on GRT Records. In 1980, the newly formed El Mocambo Records signed the act and their ‘Bitter Reality’ album for re-issue. The duo’s first new release for the label was 1980’s ‘MacLean & MacLean Suck Their Way to the Top/MacLean & MacLean Take the “O” Out of Country’. The A-side was recorded, cleverly, at the El Mocambo Club in Toronto while the B-side was a studio recording simulating a mock country music station radio broadcast. The album spawned the single “Dolly Parton’s Tits” which, in a strange twist, made the British music charts after it was used as the theme music for BBC-TV show ‘O.T.T.’. Controversy followed them wherever they played and their 1981 album ‘Locked Up For Laughs’ refers to an incident where they were put in jail, briefly, on a charge of public indecency while performing in Kingston, Ontario. Because of this an previous incidents MacLean & MacLean went to the Supreme Court of Canada to fight for their right to perform their shows throughout Canada uncensored. During the height of their popularity they played the Commodore Ballroom in Vancouver, British Columbia, the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, and in 1983 at the ‘Just for Laughs’ Festival in Montreal, Québec while promoting their Attic Records debut album ‘Go To Hell’. On the 1985 album ‘Cruel Cuts’, the duo created a comedy bit called ‘The Champ’ about a retired boxer attempting to adjust to domestic life featuring racy double entendres. The character was licensed and fully developed by disc jockey “Brother” Jake Edwards, who performed a daily ‘Champ’ monologue which was syndicated to radio stations across Canada for over 20 years. In all, the dup performed their routines on and off for more than 30 years. After retiring the act Gary MacLean became a radio personality in Winnipeg, while his brother Blair became a landscape painter. Their final show together was shortly before Gary MacLean’s death from throat cancer 2001. As a tribute to their legacy Blair MacLean released an independent CD entitled ‘Live at Watts’ in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan 1996′ to raise trust fund money for Gary’s children. Blair MacLean would die of a heart attack in October 2008. The duo’s recorded legacy rests in the hands of Burton Cummings for archiving and possible future re-issue; Gary MacLean’s three sons also entered show business and now perform as The MacLean Brothers.\n\nSingles\n\n1980 Dolly Parton’s Tits/Diary Of A Jealous Boyfriend (El Mocambo/A & M) ESMO-505\n\n1981 Locked Up For Laughs/I Married The Wrong Di (El Mocambo/A & M) ESMO-523\n\nAlbums\n\n1974 Toilet Rock (GRT) 9230-1048\n\n1976 Bitter Reality (GRT) 9230-1056\n\n1980 Bitter Reality [re-issue] (El Mocambo) ELMO-753\n\n1980 MacLean & MacLean Suck Their Way to the Top / MacLean & MacLean Take the “O” Out of Country (El Mocambo) ELMO-754\n\n1981 Locked Up for Laughs (El Mocambo) ESMO-763\n\n1982 Bitter Reality [2nd re-issue] (Attic) LAT-1154\n\n1983 Go To Hell (Attic) LAT-1177\n\n1985 Cruel Cuts (Attic) LAT-1199\n\n1989 The Dirty Thirty (Attic) ACDM-1256\n\n2003 Live at Watts, Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, 1996\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1981 “Dolly Parton’s Tits” on ‘Hit Toons For Hip Teens’ (El Mocambo) ELMO-760\n\n1998 “Ken & Barbie” on ‘Attic Records Limited Twenty5’ [4CDs] (Attic) ATTIC-25\n\nwith BOWSER & BLUE\n\n1990 “Big & Hairy” on ‘Westmount Rhodesians’ (Justin Time) JUST-37\n\nMacLEAN, Kenny\n\nBorn: Kenneth Irving MacLean in Glasgow, Scotland on January 9, 1956\n\nDied: November 24, 2008\n\nMacLean was born in Glasgow and after emigrating to Canada got work as a hairdresser in the Greater Toronto Area while trying to get his music career off the ground. He was originally a member of the group The Hairdressers, and then was a founding member of The Suspects in 1979 and released an independent single called “Raining Over France” which gained them some airtime on Toronto radio stations. Meanwhile, members of Johnnie Lovesin’s backing band left him to form The Deserters which MacLean was asked to join. They soon came to the attention of Capitol-EMI Records in Canada and released their eponymous debut in 1980. The album sported a charting single in the track “Alien” and the Deserters was able to do opening slots for other Capitol New Wave acts in Canada. To augment and expand their sound beyond the obvious Police boundaries, they added keyboardist Greg Stephens for their follow-up album ‘Siberian Nightlife’ in 1981. Despite fervent touring the album failed to ignite. The band split up not long afterward. MacLean’s old friend Chris Steffler and MacLean briefly formed another band called The Next, before Steffler took a gig with Platinum Blonde. Later, when it came time to augment Platinum Blonde’s live line-up, MacLean was the natural choice to be added as keyboardist, bass player and vocalist. MacLean was officially added to the band for their 2nd album ‘Alien Shores’ in 1985 and recorded two more albums with the group – ‘Contact’ and ‘Yeah Yeah Yeah’ (under their revised name The Blondes) before the group split up in 1991. Meanwhile, MacLean had parlayed his Justin Entertainment association into a solo deal and released 1990’s ‘Don’t Look Back’. The title track became a radio hit and it won him a SOCAN Award for songwriting, as well as a JUNO Award nomination for ‘Most Promising Male Vocalist’ in 1991. In 1995, MacLean returned with another solo album, produced by Terry Brown (Klaatu, Rush, Max Webster) called ‘Clear’ and featuring one song written with Mark Holmes and a cover of the Sylum tune “Walk The Stranger”. The album also featured an all-star Canadian music line-up including Gowan, Tony “Wild T” Springer, Curtis Lee (Sweet Blindness), Sascha (Platinum Blonde), and Anne Bourne. In 2006, MacLean moved to Saint John, New Brunswick, working as a teacher at the city’s new School of Rock and Film. MacLean created the music company hMh Music, and was its artistic director. An academy officially opened in Toronto on September 2, 2008, and featured programs such as audio engineering and DJ arts. MacLean also became an integral part of Rock Through The Ages (or Rock TTA), a show featuring a line-up of seasoned musicians doing a decades spanning Rock and Roll revue. Kenny MacLean was found dead on November 24, 2008 of a heart related problem. His third solo CD, ‘Completely’, was released at a concert the night before his death. with notes from Kenny MacLean and Kevin Gordon [also see PLATINUM BLONDE, THE DESERTERS, THE SUSPECTS]\n\nSingles\n\n1990 Don’t Look Back (Justin/MCA) JED-9006\n\nAlbums\n\n1990 Don’t Look Back (Justin/MCA) JE-0001\n\n1995 Clear (MMP/Page) PP-61595\n\n2008 Completely (independent)\n\nMacLEAN, Tara\n\nBorn: Tara Margaret Charity MacLean on October 25, 1973 in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island\n\nPrince Edward Island’s Tara MacLean grew up with entertainer parents. Her mother is actress Sharlene MacLean and her father Danny Costain is a singer and dancer. She would find additional inspiration from her step father, Marty Reno, a singer/guitarist who recorded with legendary singer-songwriter Gene MacLellan. Her family would relocate to Victoria, British Columbia when she was 13 years old. Following high school graduation in 1991, MacLean pursued her music interests more seriously. One day in 1994 she was passing the time on the top deck of one of the Gulf Island ferries singing with some friends when two Nettwerk Records employees caught her ‘performance’. She was signed to Nettwerk Records in April 1995 after moving to Vancouver and recording her song “Let Her Feel the Rain” for the label’s ‘Lit from Within’ benefit compilation. The song managed some modest airplay and also popped up on Nettwerk’s ‘Slowbrew’ compilation as well. She made her Vancouver debut at the Vogue Theater as part of Nettwerk’s 10th anniversary show. She would also perform at the East Coast Music Awards with her step-father Marty Reno and Lennie Gallant in a tribute to Gene MacLellan. In October 1995 MacLean headed to San Francisco to work with producer Norm Kerner (American Music Club, Sky Cries Mary, Spain) and finished the album in early 1996 back in Vancouver. The album ‘Silence’ was released in the spring and MacLean went on tour for nearly two years to promote the album as an opener for Ashley MacIsaac, The Barenaked Ladies, Paula Cole, Ron Sexsmith and Tom Cochrane, and The Cure plus dates on Sarah McLachlan’s Lilith Fair tour. In 1997 MacLean released an EP of orphaned tracks entitled ‘If You See Me’. She then headed out to promote the release with guitarist, and (then) husband, Bill Bell (Tom Cochrane, Danko Jones) accompanying her. That year she won ‘Best New Solo Artist’ at the Canadian Radio Music Awards. MacLean’s remake of the traditional folk song ‘Rattlesnake Mountain’, retitled “On Springfield Mountain”, was featured on the ‘Inventing the Abbotts’ movie soundtrack. In early 1999 she went to New Orleans, Louisiana with Bill Bell to worked with producer Malcolm Burn (Daniel Lanois, Neville Brothers, Boys Brigade) to record her follow-up album. ‘Passenger’ was released by Nettwerk Records in October 1999 and spawned the radio singles “If I Fall” and “Divided”. MacLean would spend the next 18 months touring North America and Asia. The single “Settling” was released as a single in Taiwan. In the US she would tour extensively as the opening act for Dido. MacLean also joined Kendall Payne, Shannon McNally and Amy Correia for a 21 show ‘The Girls Room Tour Across America’ sponsored by Capitol Records. The tour generated $1,000 for women’s charities in each of the 21 cities they visited. A treasure trove of live recordings emerged and the ‘Live from Austin’ and ‘Live from Roots Lodge’ were soon added as bonus discs with the purchase of ‘Passenger’. The album would sell over 50,000 copies. MacLean would appear on the talk show ‘Late Night with Conan O’Brien’ and made cameo appearances in the film ‘Coyote Ugly’ and the TV show ‘Good vs Evil’. Following time off in 2001 to have her first child, EMI Canada concocted the idea of teaming MacLean with two other east coast female singer-songwriters -Kim Stockwood and Damhnait Doyle – to form the trio Shaye; The theory being that strength in numbers would lead to better record sales for all three solo performers. An album was released in 2003, several awards were won and Shaye even performed at the World Expo in Nagoya, Japan that Spring. A reality show was built around the group as they navigated their way through label politics, recording, touring and the stresses of everyday life. In 2006 Tara gave birth to her second child on the eve of the group’s second release, ‘Lake of Fire’. The group toured the new album through 2007 with MacLean squeezing in a seven song solo EP, ‘Signs of Life’, in March 2007. However, she found balancing home life, performing and the TV show to be too much and left Shaye in October 2007. In April 2008 she released another full-length album, ‘Wake’, but didn’t perform many live gigs as she gave birth to a third child. MacLean left Nettwerk Records in the fall of 2009 and has released one song – a Mother’s Day song on her website in 2012 called “Where I Am”.

He taught himself guitar and became an early member of R & B band Little Caesar and the Consuls through 1958/1959. He recorded one single with the group – “Runaway” b/w “I’m Happy” for the US Abel record company. After leaving the group MacLellan moved to Prince Edward Island in 1964. CBC television in Halifax had a vibrant music television department and MacLellan would soon appear on ‘The Don Messer Show’ and in the late 1960’s ‘Singalong Jubilee’ where he made the acquaintance of upcoming singer Anne Murray. Early on she began recording his songs particularly “Put Your Hand In the Hand” (which would become a huge hit for Ocean in 1971) and the million selling “Snowbird”. Murray’s stardom rise with Capitol Records allowed MacLellan to parlay that into his own record deal with the label. His self-titled debut was released in 1970 and yielded two minor hits with the singles ‘The Call’ and ‘Thorn in My Shoe’. He would win the ‘Composer of the Year’ JUNO Award that year. He released an immediate follow-up in 1971 with ‘Street Corner Preacher’ allowing MacLellan to spend the better part of 1971 and 1972 touring premiere venues such at the Canadian National Exhibition, Massey Hall, and return engagements to Yorkville’s Riverboat Coffeehouse. After a five year break, MacLellan finally returned with his third album, ‘If It’s Alright With You’, in 1977, featuring the Anne Murray duet “Shilo Song”. In 1979 MacLellan teamed up with guitarist Marty Reno (stepfather of future singer-songwriter Tara MacLean) and together they released the Pilgrim Records gospel album ‘Gene & Marty’ (Pilgrim PMC-7005). In the 1980s MacLellan was based in Burlington, Ontario and performed at churches, in penitentiaries with a team of other musicians including Skip Prokop (Lighthouse, The Paupers), retirement homes, and other charitable causes. He received PROCAN’s ‘William Harold Moon Award’ in 1987 for ‘International Achievement’. In 1992 he returned to live in Summerside, PEI where he stayed out of the spotlight except on special occasions. He attended Anne Murray’s induction into the JUNO Hall of Fame in 1993. MacLellan passed away in 1995. He was posthumously inducted into the CCMA’s Hall of Honour and received the ECMA’s ‘Helen Creighton Lifetime Achievement Award’ in 1996.Tribute albums and several festivals in his name have popped up in recent years. MacLellan’s songs have been recorded by artists from all over the world. “Snowbird” and “Put Your Hand in the Hand” are his most enduring tunes having been covered by acts as diverse as Elvis Presley, Joan Baez, and Bing Crosby with Count Basie.\n\nSingles\n\n1970 The Call/Snowbird (Capitol) 72607\n\n1970 Thorn In My Shoe/The Robin (Capitol) 72628\n\n1971 Isle of St. Jean/Pages of Time (Capitol) 72644\n\n1971 I Got Drunk On Monday (Gene’s Blues)/Lonesome River (Capitol) 72660\n\n1974 Mommy/Come To The Saviour (Pilgrim) PMC74-515\n\nwith GENE MACLELLAN AND JANICE (LA POINTE) MCLAUGHLIN\n\n1982 Reunion/Shiloh (Heaven Bent) ACS-8276\n\nAlbums\n\n1970 Gene MacLellan (Capitol) ST-6348\n\n1971 Street Corner Preacher (Capitol) ST-660\n\n1977 If It’s Alright With You (Capitol) ST-11535\n\n1997 Lonesome River (EMI) 72438-57587-2-0\n\nwith LITTLE CAESAR & THE CONSULS\n\n1959 Runaway/I’m Happy (Abel Records – US) ABEL-222\n\nwith GENE AND MARTY\n\n1979 Gene and Marty (Pilgrim) PMC-7005\n\nwith GENE MACLELLAN, JANICE MCLAUGHLIN\n\n1982 Reunion (Heaven Bent) ACR-8280\n\nMacLEOD, Johnny\n\nFollowing the collapse of his previous band Johnny & the G-Rays, Johnny MacLeod assembled a new band, The Young Pioneers, to back him on his True North Records debut. ‘Dynamite in the Stove’ was also released in Italy in July 1985; the video for “The Price is Rising” single was directed by Don Shebib.

Using a fiddle given to her by a great-uncle, MacMaster took formal lessons along with her cousin, Ashley MacIsaac. After releasing two self-produced cassette-only albums ‘Four On the Floor’ (1989) and ‘Road To the Isle’ (1991) MacMaster expanded her following with her first release on CD called ‘Fit As A Fiddle’ in 1993 which was recorded at the CBC studio ‘H’ in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Musicians featured include Dave MacIsaac on guitars, Howie MacDonald and Tracy Dares on piano, Tom Roach on drums and guest spots by Jamie MacInnis on highland pipes and Sandy Moore on Celtic harp. The disc received an East Coast Music Award as ‘Best Roots/Traditional Album’ of 1993. Her career and busy schedule became all consuming that she had to pass up an invitation to be featured member of the musical production of ‘Lord Of The Dance’. A highlight of her touring schedule was 1995’s performance before more than 80, 000 people as the opening act for Santana in Chattanooga, Tennessee. She was soon signed to Warner Music Canada and her first album for the label was ‘No Boundaries’ which included, among other tracks, “Drunken Piper” featuring vocals support by Cookie Rankin of Rankin Family fame. In addition to hosting the East Coast Music Awards, MacMaster received awards as ‘Female Artist of the Year’, ‘Roots/Traditional Artist of the Year’ and ‘Instrumental Artist of the Year’. MacMaster has also been named ‘Fiddler of the Year’ by the Canadian Country Music Association in the past. In 1996, she spent four weeks as the opening act for the Chieftains’ US tour. Also that year, Rounder records in the US issued tracks from MacMaster’s first two indie cassettes as ‘A Compilation’. MacMaster has also become an in-demand session player and side-man on tours and her fiddling has also been heard on TV for both Tim Horton Donuts and General Motors Pontiac commercials. MacMaster’s follow-up album for Warner Music was 1998’s ‘My Roots Are Showing’. It was recorded at Lakewind Sound Studios, Point Aconi, Cape Breton, Nova Scotia in December 1997 and produced by MacMaster herself. Her latest CD, ‘In My Hands’, came out in August 1999 and included “Get Me Through December”, a duet with bluegrass phenomenon Alison Krauss. In November of the same year, she and guitarist Jesse Cook won a Gemini (Canadian TV) Award for “Best Performance or Host in a Variety Program or Series” for their duet on the 1999 JUNO Award broadcast.\n\nSingles\n\n1996 Fiddle & Bow (Warner)\n\n1996 The Drunken Piper (Warner)\n\n1997 Catharsis (Warner)\n\n1999 Get Me Through December [featuring ALISON KRAUSS] [3 mixes] (Warner)\n\n2000 In My Hands (Rounder) CDPR-1175P\n\nAlbums\n\n1989 Four On the Floor [cassette] (Astro) CC-4979\n\n1993 Fit As A Fiddle (MacMaster) CD-16260\n\n1996 No Boundaries (Warner Music) CD-15697\n\n1998 My Roots Are Showing (Warner) CD- 22715\n\n1999 In My Hands (Warner) 2 28398\n\n2002 Live (Rounder – US) 617048\n\n2003 Blueprint (Vik./BMG) 82876-56971-2\n\n2006 Yours Truly (Rounder – US) 617065\n\n2019 Sketches (Linus) 270431\n\nas NATALIE MacMASTER with JOHN MORRIS RANKIN, DAVE MacISAAC AND SEAMUS EGAN\n\n1991 Road To The Isle [cassette] (Astro) ACC-49290\n\nas NATALIE MacMASTER, DONNELL LEAHY\n\n2015 One (independent) 03057\n\n2016 A Celtic Family Christmas (Linus) 270245\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1998 “Catharsis” on ‘Celtic Tides – A Musical Odyssey’ (Putumayo World Music) PUTU-141-2\n\n1999 “In My Hands (Album Version Edit)” on ‘Women & Songs 3′(WEA) WTVD-38141\n\nCollaborations\n\nwith THE CHIEFTAINS\n\n1998 “Fingal’s Cave” on ‘Fire In the Kitchen’ (Wicklow – UK) 663133\n\nMacMICHAEL, Kevin\n\nBorn: Kevin Scott MacMichael on November 7, 1951 in Halifax, NS\n\nDied: December 31, 2002 in Halifax, NS\n\nMacMichael was born in New Brunswick and raised in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia. He gained some east coast notoriety with the band Chalice and then joined Eric McDow’s Beatles tribute band Spice. In the early 1980s he was part of the Halifax band, Fast Forward (not to be confused with the Ian Lloyd/Bruce Fairbairn project of the same name). Fast Forward toured with British band The Drivers in Canada. Dallcorte Records’ had signed The Drivers but upon release of the The Drivers’ radio hit “Tears On My Anarak”, Leonard Rosenberg’s GreyMac Development Corporation, who was an investor in Dallcorte, had its assets frozen and was forced into bankruptcy after the Ontario Government halted a controversial condominium sale. This left The Drivers stranded in Canada and their career in limbo. The band’s guitarist, Nick Van Eede, hooked up with Kevin MacMichael to write some songs. They then demoed the tracks with Terry Brown, who had produced The Drivers’ debut album, in Toronto and Van Eede soon convinced MacMichael to move to England and start up a new band. In 1985 that band was The Cutting Crew — also featuring Colin Farley (bass) and Martin Beedle (drums) – who were signed to Virgin Records in September 1985 upon the strength of Eede’s and MacMichael’s songwriting. They then called upon Terry Brown in 1986, once again, to produce their first album in New York called ‘Broadcast’ which managed to spawn Virgin Records’ first two US hit singles: “(I Just Died) In Your Arms Tonight” and “I’ve Been In Love Before” plus a third charting single in “One For The Mocking Bird”. They subsequently received a Grammy nomination in 1987. The sophomore release, ‘The Scattering’, was released in early 1989. Its lead single, “(Between a) Rock And a Hard Place,” failed to crack the Top 40. However, they did manage a noteworthy U.S. Adult Contemporary hit with “Everything But My Pride” managing to reach No.4 on the chart – lasting 22 weeks in the Top50. The next single in 1990, “The Last Thing”, hit No.17 on the A/C charts which would be their final hit. Cutting Crew’s third album, ‘Compus Mentus’, was released in 1992, failed to chart and the band split up following a short tour in 1993. MacMichael then joined forces with Led Zeppelin’s Robert Plant, composing songs and playing on Plant’s ‘Fate of Nations’ album. After nine years in the UK, MacMichael returned to Nova Scotia where he collaborated with several number of Canadian artists including Chris Colepaugh & The Cosmic Crew, The Rankin Family and Sons Of Maxwell; MacMichael died of lung cancer on New Year’s Eve 2002 at his home in Nova Scotia at the age of 51.

At seventeen, Rita MacNeil moved to Toronto, married, and had two children. Divorced in 1978, she moved to Ottawa, where she scrubbed floors for a living. She later returned to Big Pond where she formed a trio. Her big break came at Expo 86 in Vancouver where she played at the Canadian Pavilion for a six-week run. She recorded her first album, ‘Born a Woman’, in 1975, the first of three recorded independently. Her major label debut came in 1987 with ‘Flying On Her Own’ on Virgin Records. Her accomplishments are many: She is the only female singer ever to have three albums in Australia’s Top 100 in the same year. In 1990 she sold more records in Canada than Garth Brooks and Clint Black. In 1991 she was invited to play at Royal Albert Hall in London, England. In 1992 she was named a member of the Order of Canada by Governor-General Ray Hnatyshyn. MacNeil hosted her own CBC Television variety show, ‘Rita and Friends’, from 1994 to 1997. The show won a Gemini Award in 1996. MacNeil wrote her memoirs entitled ‘On a Personal Note’ with Anne Simpson in 1998. A music-based play based on her life entitled ‘Flying On Her Own’ premiered at Live Bait Theatre in Sackville, New Brunswick in 2000. The play also had a subsequent production mounted at the Neptune Theatre in Halifax, Nova Scotia in 2002. MacNeil released several new albums in – ‘Common Dream’ and ‘Late December’ in 2002 and ‘Blue Roses’ in 2004. She was awarded the Order of Nova Scotia in 2005. She then released ‘Songs My Mother Loved’ in 2006, ‘Pocket Full of Dreams’ in 2008 and ‘The Spirit of Christmas’ in 2010. In November–December 2012 MacNeil planned to accompany pianist Frank “Music Box Dancer” Mills on a national tour leading up to Christmas that year. Besides her music, MacNeil was proprietor of Rita’s Tea Room in Big Pond, Nova Scotia now a popular Cape Breton Island tourist attraction; MacNeil died April 16, 2013 due to complications following surgery.\n\nSingles\n\n1987 Flying On Your Own/[same] (Lupins/Virgin) RMS-101\n\n1987 Used to You/She’s Called Nova Scotia (Lupins/Virgin) RMS-102\n\n1987 Fast Train to Tokyo/Leave Her Memory (Lupins/Virgin) RMS-103\n\n1987 Christmas [4 song EP] (Lupins/Virgin) RMS-104\n\n1988 Working Man/Sound Your Own Horn (Lupins/Virgin) RMS-106\n\n1988 Walk On Through (Edit)/Walk On Through (Lupins/Virgin) VJD-107\n\n1988 Now Rings the Bell/Christmas At Home (Lupins/Virgin) RMS-108\n\n1988 Reason To Believe/Good Friends (Lupins/Virgin) RMS-109\n\n1989 We’ll Reach the Sky Tonight/ I’ll Accept the Rose (Lupins/Virgin) RMS-111\n\n1990 Crazy Love/She’s Called Nova Scotia (Interfusion – AUSTRALIA) PR-9110\n\n1990 When Love Surrounded You and I (Lupins/Virgin)\n\n1990 Why Do I Think of You Today (Lupins/Virgin)\n\n1990 You Taught Me Well (Lupins/Virgin)\n\n1991 Watch Love Grow Strong (Lupins/Virgin)\n\n1991 Call Me and I’ll Be There (Lupins/Virgin)\n\n1991 Leave Her Memory/When the Lovin’ Is Through (Polydor – UK) PO-143\n\n1992 Bring It On Home to Me (Lupins)\n\n1993 Shining Strong (Lupins)\n\n1995 Steal Me Away (Luprock)\n\n1995 Rolling Thunder (Luprock)\n\nAlbums\n\n1975 Born A Woman (Boot) BOS-7154\n\n1981 Part of the Mystery (Big Pond) SR-58\n\n1982 Cape Breton Night At The Cohn (Big Pond)\n\n1983 I’m Not What I Seem (University College of Cape Breton Press) UCCBP-1006\n\n1987 Flying On Your Own (Lupins) RM-1001\n\n1988 Reason To Believe (Virgin) RM-2001\n\n1989 Now The Bells Ring (Lupins) RM-3001\n\n1989 Rita (Lupins/Virgin) RM-4001\n\n1990 Home I’ll Be: Songs of Home (Lupins/Virgin) RM-5001\n\n1992 Thinking of You (Lupins/Virgin) RM-6001\n\n1993 Once Upon A Christmas (Lupins/Virgin) RMCD-7001\n\n1993 Working Man: The Best of Rita MacNeil (Polydor – UK) 517-861\n\n1994 Volume 1: Songs From the Collection\n\n1995 Porch Songs (Luprock)\n\n1996 Joyful Sounds (Luprock)\n\n1997 Music of a Thousand Nights (Luprock)\n\n1998 Full Circle (Luprock)\n\n1999 A Night at the Orpheum (Luprock)\n\n2000 Mining the Soul (Luprock)\n\n2002 Late December (Luprock) 70012\n\n2002 Common Dream (Luprock)\n\n2004 The Ultimate Collection\n\n2004 Blue Roses (Luprock) 70013\n\n2006 Songs My Mother Loved (Luprock)\n\n2006 High Power: The Songs of Praise (Luprock)\n\n2008 Pocket Full of Dreams (Luprock)\n\n2010 The Spirit of Christmas (Luprock)\n\n2012 Saving Grace (eOne Music) Big Pond 2012\n\nCompilation Tracks\n\n1987 “Flying On Your Own” on ‘Canadian Gold’ (Quality) QRPS-1061\n\n1995 “Walk On Through” on ‘In Between Dances (Canadian Artists In Aid Of Breast Cancer Research)’ (Attic) ACD-1431\n\n1996 “Flying On Your Own” on ‘Oh What a Feeling: A Vital Collection of Canadian Music (MCA) JUNO-25\n\nCollaborations\n\nwith THE CHIEFTAINS\n\n1998 “Come By the Hills” on ‘Fire In the Kitchen’ (Wicklow – UK) 663133\n\nMacRAE, Alan\n\nFormer guitarist for early 1960s folk act The Chanteclairs.

Having recruited three other musicians, Madame played Rideau in May 1985. The song “On veut pas payer” was released from their self-titled debut album and allowed then to tour of Québec. Madame won the ADISQ 1986 Felix Award for ‘Francophone Group of the Year’. Boudreau, Gatignol and Marchand continued on as a trio and released the album ‘Eldorado’ in 1987 which featured two singles “Propriétaire” and “Tous les jours” and won the Felix Award for ‘Francophone Group of the Year’ in 1988. After touring in 1990 Madame recorded their next album, “Weke!”, in 1991. They participated in the Francofolies in Montreal that year followed by La Rochelle in the summer of 1992. After the release of the album “Le beau pays” in 1994, Madame toured for a year before the departure of Jacques Marchand. After being chosen to do a French adaptation of the song “Mini, Mini, Mini” for a commercial by the Cooper car company, the new duo released ‘Madame sing Dutronc’ in the fall of 1997 – an album of songs devoted to the 1960’s French singer.\n\nSingles\n\n1985 Hello/Hello (Instrumentale) (Hello) HLO-101\n\n1986 Frole-frole/Avoue (Hello) HLO-103\n\n1986 Frole-frole/Bonsai/Hello [12”] (Hello) HLO-12-103\n\n1987 Nord-sud/Tous les jours (Hello) HLO-202\n\n1987 La Grand Sommeil/La Grand Sommeil (Instrumentale) (Hello) HLO-204\n\n1988 On veut pas payer/Qu est passe Roger?

They were signed to Skyline Records and their self-titled debut was released, with a very risqué front cover of a straight-jacketed woman in a cage, in 1978 through Quality Records. The album was picked up by Buddah/Arista for the US in 1979, and the cover art was altered so that a similar photo of the straight-jacketed woman was not caged. The record failed to ignite the US market and the band was dropped. Domenic Troiano’s Freedom label picked up the band for their second album, ‘Streetgame’, which was released in 1981. By this time bassist John Erdman had been replaced by Clarence Greer. The band was able to do some moderately successful touring but split up as the ’80s wore on; Glen Gratto died August 31, 2021. with notes from Brad MacDonald.

Simon Bedford-James had been in Moving Targetz, Swedish Fish and his own group Simon Truth And The Last Band. With former Last Band alumni John Bowker (Daughaus) and Jason Taylor, they found the drum skills of Queen Street fixture Alison McLean. Following their debut in Toronto clubs in 1994, Made, started the rumble that they were the next-big-thing. They issued an independent cassette shortly thereafter, produced by Dale Morningstar (Dinner Is Ruined) called ‘Rumball’ that added fuel to the critical fire. As a means to continue their momentum they played a showcase gig at Canada Music Week in Toronto to continue the buzz. A full length cassette called ‘Big Bother’ followed with a cover version of Slade’s “Cum On Feel The Noize”. With some serious overtures brewing within the music industry, Alison McLean called her brother, James (manager for Doughboys Voivod), who felt the band was finally ready for the big leagues. They had a minor setback with the departure of John Bowker who, and with studio time booked, a quick replacement was found in Scott Fairbrother. The band begin a seven week stint recording at Tom Treumuth’s Hypnotic Studios where the studio’s owner had fallen ill leaving these kids running the candy store. Some would find it insane to leave a band with no label, no manager, and two producers free to navigate a recording studio, and despite the ability to tinker without A & R or the clock ticking, the band was stuck with a $25,000 bill. The band began to panic over the debt because most of the labels heard the recordings as merely demos of tunes that would have to be refined in a bigger, more lavish studio. However, the results were enough to impress Universal Records into fronting enough cash to properly remix the bedtracks, at which time it was decided that Fairbrother would be let go and Frank Guidoccio would be brought in. Universal released the band’s debut CD, ‘Bedazzler’, in February 1997. The success of the album’s first single/video “Hairdown” led to extensive tours with the likes of Dinosaur Jr., Pluto and Chixdiggit. Made were able to parlay that into unexpected sales in Québec. Bedford-James left the band shortly after MAdE carried on for one more album before calling it quits; Simon-Bedford James would reform his old band Swedish Fish from 2006 until 2016. In 2018 he formed Mr! Mouray; Alison MacLean would go on to join It’s Patrick!; Jason Taylor lives in Mexico; John Bowker is a political journalist.

The track reached the Canadian Top20 and spent six weeks riding the Top40. The song was part of their debut album ‘Sunshine And Baked Beans’. The follow up single was 1971’s “Hallelujah” which didn’t appear on the album. The band broke up in 1973 but reunited with a different line-up in 1975 but that too was short lived.

At age seven he was writing poetry and at age eleven he was rapping with influences from New York rap acts like Grandmaster Flash and Kurtis Blow. As Melody MC in 1979, Williams entered a rap festival sponsored by radio station CKLN in 1983. With fellow rapper Ebony MC (Marlon Bruce) they formed the Vision Crew and played around Toronto until 1987. 1988 Williams adopted the name Maestro Fresh-Wes and recorded his independent demo ‘You Can’t Stop Us Now’. This was followed by ‘I’m Showin’ You’ with DJ LTD (Alva Swaby). With the addition of Farley Flex, Maestro and DJ LTD recorded “Let Your Backbone Slide” in 1989. He attended the annual New Music Seminar in New York City and walked away with a record deal through the independent label LMR Records (Lefrak-Moelis). Upon his return to Toronto, Attic Records agreed to distribute the imprint in Canada. His debut album, ‘Symphony In Effect’, sold in excess of 200,000 copies in Canada. Maestro became the first rapper to ever perform on the annual JUNO Awards telecast. In 1991 he won two JUNO Awards, including ‘Rap Recording of the Year’. Three MuchMusic Video Awards soon followed. He was named most popular performer of the year in 1991 by the Toronto Student Councils and became their role model in Toronto Mayor Art Eggleton’s ‘Task Force Against Drugs’. Following the release of 1991’s ‘The Black Tie Affair’ album, Maestro realized that the debilitating restrictions of Canadian radio was preventing him from reaching the masses and so, with a reciprocal distribution deal via Polydor in the US he began tackling the US market in 1992 and eventually moving to Brooklyn, New York to push his ‘Naaah, Dis Kid Can’t Be From Canada?!!’ After the commercial failure of that album, he laid low for the better part of four years, finally returning in late 1998 with the well-received ‘Built To Last’. The album featured a slew of guest artists, including Ghetto Concept, Michie Mee, Snow, Carla Marshal, and Glenn Lewis. The debut single, “Stick To Your Vision”, was built around a sample of The Guess Who’s “These Eyes”. The follow-up single was also a modest video hit called “416/905 (T.O. Party Anthem)”. In 2000, the album ‘Ever Since’ was released and featured the single “Bustin Loose” featuring a team up with Kardinal Offishall. In 2005, Maestro crossed over radio genres when he did a cover of Gowan’s 1985 hit “A Criminal Mind” which featured additional vocals by rapper Infinite along with sampled vocals by Gowan. Lawrence Gowan appearrf in the video and Maestro would duet with Gowan at the 2006 Canadian Urban Music Awards. Also that year, Maestro teamed up with Rochester AKA Juice in The Dope Poet Society for a performance in Cannes, France who as the first Canadian Hip Hop act to showcase at the annual Midem Conference. The same year Maestro was inducted into the Scarborough Walk of Fame. In 2012, Maestro released new material on the EP ‘Black Tuxedo’. Maestro’s 7th studio album was released in 2013 entitled ‘Orchestrated Noise’ and featured appearances by Sam Roberts, The Trews, opera singer Measha Brueggergosman and rapper Saukrates; Maestro has also appeared on albums by Kish, Classified and Da Grassroots.\n\nSingles\n\n1989 Let Your Backbone Slide [12″] (independent)\n\n1990 Let Your Backbone Slide (Remix) (LMR/Attic) ATT-2005\n\n1990 Drop the Needle (LMR/Attic) ATT-2009\n\n1990 Private Symphony (LMR/Attic)\n\n1990 Don’t Play SHARE-AIDS [w/D-SHAN] (LMR/Attic)\n\n1990 Louie Louie [from the ‘Coupe De Ville’ Soundtrack] (Cypress) CTI-1200\n\n1991 Conductin’ Thangs (LMR/Attic) WES-91\n\n1991 Nothing At All (LMR/Attic)\n\n1992 Another Funky Break (From My Pap’s Crate)/On the Jazz Tip (Polydor – US)\n\n865-677\n\n1992 Bring It On (Censored)/Bring It On (Showbiz Remix) (Polydor) CDP-701\n\n1993 It’s On the Mike Mechanism (LMS/Attic)\n\n1993 Fine Tune Da Mic/Make It For The Ruff/Dat’s My Nigga (LMS/Attic) LMS-1202\n\n1994 Certs Wid Out Da Retsyn/I’m Drinkin’ Milk Now (LMS/Attic) LMS-1203\n\n1994 How Many Styles/Party To Da East Part 2 (LMS/Attic) LMS-1204\n\n1996 Death Ministry/Pushin’ Wiggz Back [12”] (Maestro) MR-0011\n\n1998 Clap Ya Handz/Turn It Out/Trigonometry [12″] (Attic) ATTP-9803\n\n1998 Stick To Your Vision [12”] (Attic) ATTP-9804\n\n1998 Holy Water/The Visine [12″] (Attic) ATTP-9805\n\n1999 416/905 (T.O.

Many of the songs were composed by Frank Rondell and Alex MacDougall (Bond, Crowbar) and landed them a deal with Columbia Records in 1970. Following Magic Bubble’s demise, Rita Rondell (aka Marcus) would join Battle Axe, and Ronnie Hawkins And The Hawks before growing tired of the Canadian music scene and the limitations of a female guitarist in Canada. She headed to Italy for five years. Upon returning to Canada she launched a successful solo career as blues guitarist Rita Chiarelli; Frank Rondell would join Custer’s Last Band before going solo to record for the Roto Noto label and in recent years has toured on his own in a “Tribute To Ray Charles” revue; Wade Brown died February 19, 2010 due to complications from Crohn’s Disease. with notes from Richard Smith.

This was followed by “Give Me The Right” but failing any significant chart action they moved over to Ben McPeek’s Giant Records for the song “Doctor Lollipop” which made it to No.68 on the Canadian charts. Several years passed of struggling on the circuit and after releasing the “Groovy Things” single in the Fall of 1969, they decided to augment their sound with keyboards and brought in Goodale. They also left the Fingerprint label. By this time, the musical climate was changing – bands were simplifying their names and so, in 1970, The Magic Cycle became The Cycle and signed with Tamarac Records which was being run by former Red Leaf owner Stan Klees (co-editor of RPM Magazine). More struggling occurred over 3 years with a series of singles and and two LPs before splitting up in 1974. Clinch would continue on with Choya in 1976 and continued a solo career until his death in 1988; Joey Rome [aka Dinardo] would join Abraham’s Children; Goodale joined Surrender. with notes from Sebastian Agnello.

In 1971 they created another original score for the play ‘Up Against the Wall Oedipus’ by Marshall McLuhan-colleague Wilfred Watson followed as well as two commissioned symphonic pieces for the University of Alberta Symphony Orchestra. Beginning in 1972, the duo began composing incidental music for radio and theatre which included a thirteen part radio series for CKUA called ‘Man And His Music’. As songwriters they finally grabbed the attention of fledgling label Attic Records in 1974 for two 7″ single releases in 1975. “Someone Like You” broke Top 20 on the RPM Adult Contemporary Singles chart in August 1975 but their second single failed to chart. Frustrated by a lack of commercial success, they found other jobs and other outlets for their musical talents and re-convened in 1979 to create their own First International Records label that allowed them to put out 7″ singles as desired. In 1995 they reworked the 1980s material and released it as a CD called ‘Dark To Light’ on Century II Records. To mark more than 35 years together as musical partners, the duo released a retrospective of recordings from 1969 to 1996 called ‘Not For Everyone’ in 2007 which featured a new single released to radio entitled “Just A Passionate Guy”. Despite constant rejection by record labels, they have written two songs that were Canadian Top10 charted songs for others – “Carry On” (by Cliff & Anne Edwards in 1976) and “Baby Pictures” (by Chris Neilson in 1977). As well, Magic Music has won artist grants from the Canada Council and Ontario Arts Council commissions for theatre and radio. They have also performed across Canada including appearances at Man And His World, the Hotel Iroquois, George’s and Grossman’s in Toronto, and every university and college between Montreal and Victoria – including MoMo Latino’s Striptease And Bar. In 2011 Magic Music announced that they are working on a new studio album with engineer Jerry Woolsey.\n\nSingles\n\n1975 Someone Like You/Message of Love (Attic) AT-108\n\n1975 Love Oh Love What a Feeling/In Love Forever (Attic) AT-122\n\n1979 You Don’t Remember Me (But That’s All Right)/Never Stop Lovin’ Me (First International) FI-1004\n\n1983 Carry On/Tu’n te souvenirs pas de moi (First International) FI-1005\n\n1984 Females On My Mind/Lay Me Down (First International) FI-1006\n\n1984 Half Told Lies/It’s Just My Foolish Hear//Love At Last/Victim of Love (First International) FI-1007\n\n1987 Lifeforce; Deathforce/On A Stairway To The Stars//Under Another Moon/Friday Night At The Bookclub (First International) FI-1008\n\n2007 Just A Passionate Guy (First International)\n\nAlbums\n\n1995 Dark To Light (Century II) [no cat.#]\n\n2007 Not For Everyone (First International)\n\nMAGNETA LANE\n\nFrench (bass) / Lexi Valentine (guitar, vocals) / Nadia King (drums)\n\nFormed in Toronto, Ontario in 2003.\n\nSingles\n\n2005 The Constant Lover/Cheap Linguistics [7″] (Paper Bag) PAPER-7014\n\n2006 Broken Plates (Album Version) (Fontana North)\n\n2006 Bridge To Terabithia (Album Version) (Fontana North)\n\nAlbums\n\n2004 The Constant Lover (Paper Bag) PAPER-014\n\n2005 Dancing With Daggers (Paper Bag) PAPER-019\n\n2009 Gambling With God – 3 Song Sampler [3-song EP] (Paper Bag) [no cat.#]\n\n2009 Gambling With God (Shock/Last Gang – AUSTRALIA) CTX-518CD\n\nMAHOGANY RUSH [see FRANK MARINO]\n\nMAHONES, The\n\nFinny McConnell (lead vocals, guitar, banjo) / Owen Warnica (bass, guitar, backing vocals) / Mauro Sepe (drums, percussion, backing vocals) / Dave Allen (violin, mandolin, backing vocals) / Andrew Brown (whistle, accordion, backing vocals) / Joe Chithalen (bass, backing vocals) / Domenic Whelan (drums, vocals; 2001-present) / Katie “Kaboom” McConnell (accordion, vocals) / Sean Winter (banjo, mandolin, harmonica) / Paul Mancuso (bass, backing vocals)\n\nOriginally formed as a one-off St. Patrick’s Day party band in 1990 in Kingston, Ontario by Finny McConnell, the group received such a warm reception by friends and colleagues that he decided to pursue the act as a full-time concern. The Mahones’ first two CDs were independent productions but their third album, ‘The Hellfire Club Sessions’, was produced by Tragically Hip’s Johnny Fay and released on True North Records. While touring the album, bassist Joe Chithalen accidentally ingested food containing peanuts, to which he was allergic, and died shortly after a Mahones show in Amsterdam; The Mahones\n\nhave become an internationally successful Celtic punk act based in Toronto, Ontario. They’ve toured with the likes of The Pogues, Billy Bragg, Agnostic Front, The Dropkick Murphys, DOA, UK Subs among many others and were honoured with a tribute album in 2011 featuring 20 international acts.

The single reached #17 on RPM Canadian Content Chart on December 7, 1964 but failed to make the magazine’s main chart. The group became popular on the Southern Ontario circuit but split up briefly when Smith left the group. The remaining band reconvened and tried several singers before discovering Shawne Jackson who had been with Jack Hardin And The Silhouettes and then The Tiaras. Several months later they added her brother, and ex-Pharaohs member, Jay Jackson on additional lead vocals. Fred Keeler was brought in from David Clayton-Thomas And The Shays; Drummer Wes Morris started out in Jon And Lee And The Checkmates; Crone had played with Bobby Kris; Cudmore had been a member of Robbie Lane And The Disciples. This later version of the band released several albums and singles on the ARC Records label. Their version of Arthur Conley’s “Sweet Soul Music” was found on the compilation ‘CTV’s After Four’ while Aretha Franklin’s “Respect” was found on the Yorkville ‘Evolution’ compilation. This version of the group split up in 1969 but have reunited for many successful shows over the last 50 years; Shawne Jackson would later play with The Stone Soul Children alongside future Bush member Prakash John before embarking on a successful solo career in the 1970’s and would marry Domenic Troiano; Starr went on to play with Ronnie Hawkins And The Hawks and Robbie Lane & The Disciples, while his replacement, Dave Konvalinka, would subsequently play with Bobby Kris And The Imperials; Fred Keeler would later form Jericho with Denny Gerrard of The Paupers; Vickery would later join Damage; Robertson would become a top session player for Murray McLauchlan, record several easy listening solo records and did frequent musical arrangements for bands like Klaatu and the CBC; Eugene Smith has had a successful solo career and is based in British Columbia. with notes from John Crone, Rick Oskirko, and Dave Hopping [also see JAY JACKSON, SHAWNE JACKSON, EUGENE SMITH]\n\nSingles\n\nas J.

Following high school, the troop decided to go professional under the management of Larry Shannon, a disc-jockey from a local Kitchener radio station CHYM-AM. They would then switch to manager Dan Mombourquette and added vocalist and bassist David Lodge.Later in 1967 they would sign to 4 Square Records and release the single “Can’t Mend A Broken Heart” giving them a larger local following. In 1968 the band added keyboardist Gail Selkirk. By After asking as far back as 1967 the band finally received permission from the makers of the long running Gene Ahern “Our Boarding House/Major Hoople” comic strip to use the name Major Hoople’s Boarding House. They continued to work the southern Ontario bar circuit from Kitchener to Kingston which helped solidify their first label signing to Much Records in 1970 where they released the non-charting “Lady” single. A move to Polydor later that year allowed them some radio exposure with the song “Beautiful Morning”, but subsequent singles for the label did not phase radio. The band found itself in a frenzy of activity through 1975-1976. The tide finally turned after being signed to Greg Hambleton’s to Axe Records allowing for the release of their first and biggest hit in August 1975 called “I’m Running After You”. After the departure of Dave Lodge and Peter Padalino, they added Keith Sahlbaum (bass), David Gregg (trombone) and David Gooding (saxophone/flute) and loss no time in capitalizing on their new radio success with a tour from Sydney, Nova Scotia to Vancouver, British Columbia and a second hit single “You Girl”. But the group changed its lineup again with the addition of James Leroy (formerly of James Leroy & Denim) and the departure of Gregg and Gooding. The band also truncated its name to Hooples. By the ’80s, the group was being led by Howell and another succession of singles and even performed with the Kitchener-Waterloo Symphony in 1982. In 1985 after the release of the ‘New Adventures Of Hooples’ album, the group made the Top-10 on the Adult Contemporary charts in Canada with the Heywood/Lodge penned song “Late Night Invitation” on the Major Records label. The single was also released as a video receiving medium rotation on MuchMusic. Original bass player/singer David Lodge was also working as a songwriter for Peermusic/Southern International during this time and was a co-writer of the international hit by Peter Schilling, “Major Tom”, as well as “Lifetime Guarantee” both from the album ‘Error In The System’. Lodge toured with Hooples in 1985 and 1986 but passed away suddenly at the end of 1986. Hooples then re-grouped in late 1987 with Rocky Howell, Grant Heywood, Gary Hintz and Ralph Hetke. They continued playing festivals, one-nighters and corporate shows into the early 1990’s and then disbanded. In 2008, a new band, under the name The Fossilz, was formed featuring original Hooples members Beacock and Stahlbaum, as well as former Gaslight lead guitarist Brian Tozer, former Trollie drummer John Rankin, and former Eddie & The Edsels drummer/vocalist Ron Duke. In 2010, with the return of Dave Gooding, Ed Miller and the addition of keyboardist Bobby Becker (Yukon), the band returned to using the name Major Hoople’s. The current line-up includes Keith Stahlbaum, Brian Tozer, Dave Gooding, Ed Miller & Brad Stahlbaum.
