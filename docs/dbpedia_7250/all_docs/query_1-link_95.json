Explain what makes you unique and what you can do for your audience.\n\nIn the Later example, they do this in two different ways:\n\nIn their profile name, they showcase their company name with a clear description of what they do\n\nThey provide even more explanation and boost their brand up, saying they are the #1 marketing platform for Instagram\n\nStep 2: Pitch Your Service [And Use Relevant Keywords]\n\nWhile it's important to explain what type of company you are, it's also critical to pitch your product or service.\n\nWhen creating a website, this is often the first thing people see on your site to really understand what you are offering and what makes you stand out from the rest.\n\nLater does this using one line on their bio, and 8 relevant keywords:\n\nStep 3: Provide A Clear Call To Action\n\nYour call to action should be something you are encouraging your audience to do.\n\nThis could be in the form of a recent promotion you are offering, a link to a specific article you want eyes on, or just a way for users to get directed to your website.\n\nIn any case, you should always provide the user with easy access to whatever it is you'd like them to do. You can do this by providing a direct, embedded link on your bio.\n\nFor the Later example, they encourage users to check out their blog where they showcase tips and guides. This is a common strategy that brands use to get more traffic to their blog, and eventually, turn leads into customers.\n\nStep 4: Use Emojis\n\nLastly, emojis are a great way to break up any text-heavy sections in your Instagram bio.\n\nBe sure to use emojis that are relevant to your brand or to highlight the items you are discussing in your bio.\n\nLater adds emojis to draw the readers eyes to certain aspects of their bio, such as what they do and their call to action:\n\nmeet the author\n\nPat Walls\n\nI'm Pat Walls and I created Starter Story - a website dedicated to helping people start businesses.
