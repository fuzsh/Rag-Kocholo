        "text": "Autism can be challenging but there are many people on the spectrum who have achieved great heights.\n\nAutism spectrum disorder is a diagnosis that is characterized by differences from the general population in the area of social skills, communication skills, as well as the presence of certain behaviors which may look atypical from other people. These behaviors are known as restrictive or repetitive behaviors.\n\nASD Traits Can Contribute to Accomplishing Great Things\n\nNo matter what traits of autism you or your loved one may have, a person with autism has their own unique strengths and abilities. There are many famous people with autism spectrum disorder who have used their strengths and abilities to achieve success, fame, or to accomplish amazing things.\n\nStrong Interests Support Success\n\nOne example of a trait of autism is called restricted interests. This is a type of restrictive behavior. Restricted interests have to do with how the person with ASD has an intense passion for a certain topic. Whereas people without autism often have a range of interests and can easily switch focus from one topic or activity to another and may not commit to excelling at one particular thing, people with autism may have a limited and narrow range of interests.\n\nThis characteristic may contribute to the success that many people with ASD experience in life. By being able to focus and maintain one core interest for years or even for most of one’s life, the person with ASD can use this interest to accomplish great things.\n\nThe ASD Social Way of Being\n\nAdditionally, the way in which a person with autism experiences social interactions and their general social way of being may also contribute to their success. Although social skills vary widely from one person with ASD to another, in general, social skills for people with ASD may include things like having few (if any) friends, getting overwhelmed by too much social interaction, and limited tendency to share one’s interests, thoughts, and feelings with others.\n\nThe way a person with autism approaches social experiences can support their success in life. For instance, having only a few close friends can support the person’s well-being. Their friends may have similar interests and may be truly supportive of the person’s goals.\n\nNeeding alone time and space from others can help the person with ASD to have a clearer and more focused mind. Not spending so much time socializing and on small talk and being more straightforward and logical in the way the person communicates with others can help them stay focused on their goals and reaching the next step for success.\n\nThis way of living can contribute not only to the person’s success but also to their overall life satisfaction.\n\nFamous People with Autism Spectrum Disorder\n\nWe’ve reviewed some of the factors that may contribute to success and accomplishments in the life of a person with autism spectrum disorder. Let’s now introduce some famous people who many people believe to have ASD.\n\nSome of the people we discuss have an official diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder or what was previously known as Asperger’s Disorder. Others may not have an official diagnosis but may have self-diagnosed as autistic. And for some of the people we’ll mention, many people speculate that these individuals would likely qualify as having an autism spectrum disorder.\n\n1.

Henry Cavendish – Scientist\n\nCavendish is an renowned scientist. He was born in 1731 and passed away in 1810. He is most known for discovering hydrogen. Traits of ASD experienced by Cavendish included avoiding company and difficulty with eye contact. He would communicate with his servants in writing instead of verbally. He ordered his meals by leaving a note on the table. He had a private staircase built on the back of his house so he could avoid the housekeeper, as well.\n\n8.

He is thought to have basically invented the field of experimental economics which led to winning a Nobel Prize.
