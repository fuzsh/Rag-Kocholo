        "text": "Aside from three unreleased tracks, did we need a folder of ambient Miami storm videos?\n\nHaven't we had enough of Drake this year? Too much, some (most?) would say, but that didn't keep Toronto's most beloved rapper from dropping 100GB of data for seemingly no reason except maybe to clean out his hard drive.\n\nThe drop includes three unreleased tracks — “It’s Up” featuring Young Thug and 21 Savage, “Blue Green Red,\" and “Housekeeping Knows” featuring Latto — which don't add much to Drake's already bloated discography.\n\nRelated: The Drake versus Kendrick Lamar rap feud explained\n\nThat's the headline(s), but then there's the other 90-something gigs of content, consisting of videos, photographs, and who knows what else because to sift through this entire dump requires a level of commitment reserved for true Drake stans and/or Kendrick Lamar looking to finish the job he started.\n\nFor the Drake heads and casual observers, there are a lot of behind-the-scenes clips of Drake's recording process, his video shoot for \"Hotline Bling,\" and, inexplicably, an entire folder dedicated to a storm in Miami as documented on a cell phone. It's literally 13 videos of rain falling and wind knocking around palm trees. An entire folder. This dump could've been an email.\n\nBut perhaps the most telling, or at least the most insufferable, video arrives in the folder marked \"40_Keys.\" It features two dozen clips of Noah James Shebib, better known as 40, a fellow Toronto native and record producer, songwriter, record executive, and former child actor who's worked with Drake since 2009.\n\nRelated: Drake's Toronto home flooded by noted Kendrick Lamar fan, Mother Nature\n\nIn one video (among the longest in the drop at a lethargic 11 minutes) Shebib, with a broken finger and an unlit joint perpetually hanging from his mouth, tinkers away at a piano and waxes poetically on Drake's incomparable-ish career. And one begins to understand why the artist would release so much boring, uninspired content in the first place.\n\n\"The later in the career we get, the bigger the songs get, the better he gets, it's pretty phenomenal,\" Shebib says, noting that there's literally no one who can compare to Drake's career trajectory. He adds that people often mention Michael Jackson as a comparison, but he's not sure \"Michael even had as long as a run in the place that Drake's been.\"\n\nMeanwhile, somewhere on a private yacht, Beyoncé just inexplicably rolled her eyes.\n\nRelated: Ice Cube approves of Drake and Kendrick Lamar's beef – as long as it doesn't get violent\n\nAccording to Shebib, who's in the middle of working on Drake's 2021 album Certified Lover Boy, MJ had peaks and valleys in his career but Drake has been on a nonstop rocket ride and he doesn't know \"if it will ever stop.\"\n\nThey then have the audacity, the unmitigated cheek, to bring Stevie Wonder — arguably, the greatest talent popular music has ever seen — into the conversation. Listen. Stevie Wonder produced (literally produced, arranged, composed, and performed) some of the greatest albums, period, including the greatest album, period, Songs in the Key of Life when he was 26. You do not compare Drake to Stevie Wonder.\n\nSign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\nYou also don't compare Drake to Michael Jackson. Drake has had some hits, he's had some good albums, he's had a couple great songs, but when you're surrounded by people who tell you how incomparable you are, it might seem like a good idea to release 100 gigabyte of useless content under the pretense of it being worthwhile simply because of the artist releasing it.\n\nNow, if Beyoncé released 100 gigabytes of data — oh, who are we kidding, Beyoncé hasn't even released Renaissance visuals. And that mystique is far more interesting, if frustrating, than a tendency to overshare."
