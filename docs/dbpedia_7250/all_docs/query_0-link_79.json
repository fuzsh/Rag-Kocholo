(SINGING) I need you, baby.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHey, it’s Michael. Today a special episode from my colleagues, Andy Mills and Bianca Giaever. It’s Monday, December 21.\n\n[static]\n\nandy mills\n\nThe year 2020 was difficult, painful at times. And I spent much of the past year essentially on the America is divided beat. I traveled through dozens of states, attended a bunch of political rallies, talked to voters who lived in increasingly different realities. And because of the coronavirus, instead of flying around from place to place, I found myself for the first time in over a decade, back driving—\n\n[car engine starts]\n\n—a car.\n\nAnd as I drove for hundreds and thousands of miles, I listened to the radio.\n\n[flipping through radio music channels]\n\narchived recording\n\n(SINGING) You need to come by. (SINGING) It’s been a long time.\n\nandy mills\n\nAnd I loved it.\n\n[music - the doobie brothers, \"listen to the music\"]\n\nI loved getting to know—\n\narchived recording\n\n(SINGING) You try to— —all the new pop songs.\n\n[music - harry styles, \"adore you\"]\n\narchived recording (harry styles)\n\nJust let me adore you.\n\nandy mills\n\nI loved finally figuring out why it is everybody likes this Harry Styles guy. And it was there, in the car one night, I was scanning through the stations, and I rediscovered—\n\n[music - theme, \"delilah\"]\n\narchived recording\n\nDelilah.\n\nandy mills\n\n—Delilah.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nGood evening, Helen. I’m Delilah.\n\narchived recording (caller 1)\n\nHi, Delilah. Thank you for such a great show every night.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nWell, thank you for being so patient. What can I do for you?\n\narchived recording (caller 1)\n\nI would just like to know if you have Kenny Rogers’ “Through The Years” you can play for me?\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nOh, I love that song.\n\narchived recording (caller 1)\n\nI do, too.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nIs it a dedication or just a favorite?\n\narchived recording (caller 1)\n\nNo. My husband passed away the year that came out in ‘82. And it was everything our life was for 31 years of marriage, a good marriage. And he died much too young. So if you could find it in your records there, I would appreciate your playing it for me.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nAnd what’s your late husband’s name, Helen?\n\narchived recording (caller 1)\n\nJack.\n\n[music - kenny rogers, \"through the years\"]\n\narchived recording (kenny rogers)\n\nI can’t remember when you weren’t there, when I didn’t care.\n\nandy mills\n\nAnd hearing her show again, there in my car, I felt emotional. I started doing this, like, laugh, cry thing that I do sometimes whenever I get overwhelmed by emotions that are confusing, but powerful. And I was, like, why is this hitting me so hard right now?\n\nAnd at first I assumed, like, obviously, some of this is just nostalgia.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nWe are here to put a smile on your face as we share great music.\n\nandy mills\n\nI had originally become a fan of Delilah’s radio show back when I was just in junior high.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nI’m Delilah on the new 94.1, The Sound.\n\nandy mills\n\nAt the time, I was too small for my age. I wasn’t getting along with my parents who weren’t getting along with each other. I was grounded all the time. I was living in this small town. And I wanted nothing more than to grow up, to get out of that small town, fall in love, and become an adult.\n\n[music - leann rimes, \"how do i live without you\"]\n\narchived recording (leann rimes)\n\nAnd tell me now.\n\nandy mills\n\nAnd listening to this show up in my room in my headphones, it was like my first real peek into the lives of grown ups.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nMelanie, what can I do for ya?\n\narchived recording (caller 2)\n\nActually, I was wondering if you could possibly request a song for me and my husband. We’ve been married for the past three years. And we’ve just gone through a lot, a lot of problems almost on the verge of—\n\narchived recording (caller 3)\n\nI was a practicing alcoholic for quite so many years. And recently that has changed.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nPracticing, or did you have it perfected?\n\narchived recording (caller 3)\n\nOh, I had it more than perfected.\n\n[laughter]\n\nI was a true professional. And what has happened over the last year is that a woman that I loved very much and still do very much has come back into my life. And that’s the mother of my daughter.\n\nandy mills\n\nWhat Delilah was doing was simple. She was taking calls from all sorts of people from all over the country.\n\narchived recording (caller 4)\n\n—for quite a long time. I drive a truck. And I’m on the road all the time. And I spend a lot of time away from my wife and my kids.\n\nandy mills\n\nListening to them.\n\narchived recording (caller 5)\n\nI’m going through a divorce. And I have two young children. And it’s been quite difficult. And I sometimes feel that there’s nobody out there for me.\n\nandy mills\n\nAnd whatever it was they were calling to say.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nWhat can I do for you?\n\narchived recording (caller 6)\n\nI’d like to know if you can dedicate a song to my wife.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nWhat’s her name?\n\narchived recording (caller 6)\n\nHer name is Margaret. I goofed up. And I’m very sorry.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nWhat did you do?\n\narchived recording (caller 6)\n\nI lied to her.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nAbout?\n\narchived recording (caller 6)\n\nI got hurt on the job. I got addicted to drugs. And I lied to her. And I’m very sorry.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nAre you going to go get help for your addiction?\n\narchived recording (caller 6)\n\nI already am.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nGood for you? Do you think she might have a forgiving heart and see you through this?\n\narchived recording (caller 6)\n\nI’m hoping. Right now, I’m not at the house. And I’m begging for her forgiveness.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nWell, let’s hope then that she’s—\n\nandy mills\n\nAnd then, at the end of the call, she would pick out a pop song for them—\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nLet me find a song for you.\n\narchived recording (caller 6)\n\nI appreciate it. Thanks a lot.\n\nandy mills\n\n—that was in some way connected to their situation.\n\n[music]\n\narchived recording (mariah carey)\n\n(HUMMING)\n\nandy mills\n\nAnd this combination of being confessional and then together, sitting and listening to pop music, and just being awash in the mysterious power that pop music has to make people feel.\n\n[music - celine dion, \"because you loved me\"]\n\narchived recording (celine dion)\n\nFor all those times you stood for me. For all the truth that you made me see.\n\nandy mills\n\nI loved it as a kid. But hearing it right now, as an adult—\n\narchived recording (celine dion)\n\nFor all the wrong that you’ve made right.\n\nandy mills\n\n—it seemed more powerful somehow.\n\nAnd I didn’t know why. And so I decided to reach out to a bunch of my friends, ask them to listen to Delilah, and essentially let me know, like, if it hit them the way it hit me.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nI know we’ve been dealing with the new reality, the Covid-19 reality, a long time. And even though there’s a lot of negative in the pandemic, a lot of sadness, there are some things that are good.\n\n[music - redbone, \"come and get your love\"]\n\nI’ll be sharing words of love and hope and inspiration and, of course, fabulous songs all day long.\n\narchived recording\n\nHail. What’s the matter with you? Hail. Hail.\n\nHail.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nSo one day, I’m sitting in my apartment. And I hear from my friend Andy. And he asks me to listen to this lady on the radio called Delilah. And I was, like, oh, I know Delilah. She got her start in Seattle, where I grew up, and I’d hear her all the time on the radio. But my association with the show was basically just that super cheesy intro.\n\n[music - theme, \"delilah\"]\n\narchived recording\n\nDelilah. Love someone tonight.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nAnd that she played pop music, which I don’t really listen to. When Andy called me months into the pandemic, I was deep in a sad folk music phase.\n\n[folk music]\n\nI was spending a lot of time alone. I was single for the first time in a while. I missed my friends. I even missed strangers. So one night in quarantine, I turned on Delilah.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nHi, good evening. Is this Bob?\n\narchived recording (caller)\n\nThis is Bob.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nHi, Bob. What can I do to make your night a little better, just for you?\n\narchived recording (caller)\n\nI just want to tell you about the most incredible lady I ever met.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nOK. What’s her name?\n\narchived recording (caller)\n\nHer name is BJ.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nNow are you guys dating? are? You together? Are you a couple?\n\narchived recording (caller)\n\nI was an idiot. I let her walk out of my life about seven, eight years ago.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nOh. Bob. What were you thinking?\n\nbianca giaever\n\nAnd pretty quickly, I was taken by the callers.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nYou knucklehead, you.\n\narchived recording (caller)\n\nYes. I agree, 1,000 percent.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nSo what we have to do here is, number one, hope she may, by some stretch of the imagination, be listening.\n\narchived recording (caller)\n\nShe probably is. You know—\n\nbianca giaever\n\nAt first, it was a voyeuristic pleasure, like, almost a little schadenfreude. When you’re single, it’s kind of nice to hear that not everyone’s relationships are going great. But after a while—\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nHow are you?\n\narchived recording (caller 2)\n\nI’m kind of in a melancholy mode tonight. I broke the trust of the woman that I love. And I’m doing everything I can to try to get it back again.\n\nbianca giaever\n\narchived recording (caller 2)\n\nI love her a whole lot, Delilah.\n\nbianca giaever\n\narchived recording (caller 3)\n\nYou know, it’s just been really tough, really tough. We’ve been up and down like a roller coaster. And trying to get it together has just been the toughest of all. And we listen to your show every night. And you’re so compassionate. And we wanted to call you.\n\nbianca giaever\n\narchived recording\n\n(SINGING) There were times when I look above.\n\nbianca giaever\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nSo many folks angry with one another, arguing, up in each other’s faces saying unkind things. Choose your words carefully. And make sure your words are seasoned with love.\n\nbianca giaever\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nCan you hear me? Can you hear me now?\n\nandy mills\n\nAnd so, hoping to better understand what it was that she had tapped into, Bianca and I did what millions of Americans before us have done.\n\nandy mills\n\nHello.\n\ndelilah\n\nHi. Who am I talking to?\n\nandy mills\n\nWe called Delilah.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nI’m Bianca.\n\nandy mills\n\nAnd I’m Andy.\n\ndelilah\n\nHi, Bianca. Hi, Andy.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nSo are you recording on your end, Delilah?\n\ndelilah\n\nYeah, it looks great on my end.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nAre we good to go? OK, great.\n\ndelilah\n\nI grew up on the Southern Oregon coast.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nWe started at the beginning.\n\ndelilah\n\nMy parents were caretakers. They rented an old farmhouse. And they could work off the rent by milking cows. It was a little dairy farm.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nShe grew up in the ‘60s and ‘70s in the small town of Reedsport, Oregon.\n\ndelilah\n\nEverybody went fishing together and crabbing together. And everybody knew when Mrs. Luke, my mom, had the hair clippers out. Because she would cut everybody’s hair in the neighborhood for free.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nAnd from her earliest memories—\n\ndelilah\n\nI, sadly, had the show off gene and not a lick of talent.\n\nbianca giaever\n\n—she loved attention. But she says she wasn’t getting the kind of attention she wanted.\n\ndelilah\n\nI wasn’t an attractive child. I was a goofy, clumsy, chubby little girl with steel braces on my legs. If you ever saw Forrest Gump, I actually wore the braces for 10 years that he wore in that movie. And I never felt graceful or beautiful. And then puberty came knocking. [MUSIC] And wow, what a change. [LAUGHTER] So I left junior high this, you know, zit-faced, goofy, chubby girl. And I started high school looking like I was 19-years-old. And I think I would have gotten into a lot of trouble if it weren’t for the fact that I could channel my energies into radio.\n\nandy mills\n\nLuckily, it was right then that she got a job at KDUN, the AM radio station in her hometown.\n\ndelilah\n\nI had to be there at 5, 5:30 in the morning to go on the air at 6:00.\n\n[radio program music logo]\n\narchived recording\n\nGood morning from the good listening place.\n\ndelilah\n\nAnd so there was no going out on Friday or Saturday nights. There was no going to parties. There was no going and doing any of the things that all the kids in the ‘70s did. Because I had to have my butt up and in the station at 5:00 in the morning.\n\n[music - elton john, \"honky cat\"]\n\narchived recording (elton john)\n\nWhen I look back—\n\ndelilah\n\nElton John had hit the scene really big right when I started in radio.\n\n[music - jim croce, \"bad, bad leroy brown\"]\n\narchived recording (jim croce)\n\nWell, the South Side of Chicago—\n\ndelilah\n\nWe played Jim Croce.\n\narchived recording (jim croce)\n\n—the baddest part of town, and if you go down there—\n\n[music - bto, \"taking care of business\"]\n\ndelilah\n\nBTO, Bachman Turner Overdrive was my favorite.\n\nandy mills\n\nAnd what was it that you liked about it?\n\ndelilah\n\nTalk about being heaven for somebody with the show off gene, I could go on the air and say, hey, if you’re driving down 101, honk. And 15 people would drive by and honk. I was, like, that is the coolest sensation in the world. [LAUGHTER] So yeah, it fulfilled so many needs in me.\n\nandy mills\n\nListening to her tell this story, I was sort of amazed to hear that this woman who seemed to have spoken directly into the ear of this lonely kid up in his bedroom had herself also been a lonely kid.\n\ndelilah\n\nYou know, my mom had issues. And my dad had issues. I found out that my father had actually been married before my mother and had two children that lived half an hour away. And we never knew about them. It was this big deep dark secret. And they dealt with their issues by kind of shutting down emotionally. And the radio station was just like my sanctuary. It was a safe place. The people there loved me and encouraged me. They were rock solid people in my life.\n\nandy mills\n\nAnd so after she graduated, she wanted to move away from her small town. But she wanted to stay in the world of radio. And eventually, she landed a job working the late shift as a DJ at a soft rock radio station in Seattle.\n\ndelilah\n\nCalled Classy.\n\n[music - elton john, \"tiny dancer\"]\n\nIt was 1984. And it sounded like—\n\narchived recording (elton john)\n\nBlue jean baby.\n\ndelilah\n\n—Elton John’s softer side, you know, Tiny Dancer. Billy Joel—\n\narchived recording (billy joel)\n\nShe can kill with a smile. She can wound with her eyes.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nAnd she said that a lot of nights, she’d get these calls from people wanting to hear a certain song. And that off the air, while the music played, she’d talk with them. And these conversations gave her an idea for her own show. And she pitched it to her boss.\n\ndelilah\n\nI said people call me and tell me the most fascinating stories. This is really amazing. Can I put it on the air?\n\nbianca giaever\n\nAnd her boss was, like, sure. Sounds fine.\n\nandy mills\n\nAnd so this was the beginning of Delilah starting to find her own signature sound.\n\nandy mills\n\nWhat did that sound like?\n\ndelilah\n\nThe mood was more mellow. I was trying to put people to sleep. If you have to be out tonight driving, drive carefully. It’s wet and windy and cold. More of the same expected throughout the day tomorrow. There was more sound effects I used, gliss, it was called, where it sounds like wind chimes. I used a lot of seagulls and crashing waves. For Lisa and Kevin, congratulations, you two. People called mostly when they were falling in love, a lot of relationships just beginning, just budding. I had tons of teenagers calling in.\n\narchived recording (caller)\n\nWell, I want to dedicate a song to my best friend and then the guy she likes.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nWho?\n\narchived recording (caller)\n\nA guy named Joey in our class.\n\nandy mills\n\nBut she was also hearing from older listeners with more adult love stories.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nWhen you say ex-husband, I don’t feel like you want it to be ex anymore.\n\narchived recording (caller 1)\n\nHe’s my best friend. And he’s really a very special man.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nSo if you knew then what you know now, would he be your ex-husband?\n\narchived recording (caller 1)\n\nProbably not. But it’s too late now. But we’ve made the best of the situation and we’ll always be part of each other’s life.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nI will certainly get that on the air for you, Terry.\n\narchived recording\n\nThank you.\n\ndelilah\n\nAnd the show went from number 17 or 18 to number 1 in the market.\n\nIt struck a chord in a lot of hearts. And I grew a very strong and faithful audience quickly.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nBut from early on, Delilah wanted a bigger audience, beyond the city. And she started pitching the show around for syndication.\n\ndelilah\n\nAnd at each station, the bosses would say, ah, yeah, it’s not going to work. I mean, you’re number one in Seattle. But that’s because you’re Seattle’s darling daughter. Nobody else will like it.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nThen she decided to leave the West Coast completely, go to Boston.\n\ndelilah\n\nThen when I got to be number one in Boston, the boss was, like, if you want to be syndicated, you need to be in mornings or you need to do something like a top 40 countdown. This just won’t work. These phone calls won’t work.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nAnd she heard this over and over, that the phone calls were a fluke, that they wouldn’t work.\n\ndelilah\n\nOne of them goes, God, can somebody just tell that broad to sit down and shut up and play the damn music?\n\nbianca giaever\n\nBut she kept at it.\n\ndelilah\n\nI had moved to Boston. I had moved to Philly. I had moved back to Boston. And now I had two kids.\n\nandy mills\n\nAnd as her life experiences evolved—\n\narchived recording\n\nHi, mama.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nHi, sir. You have a good night’s sleep, OK?\n\nandy mills\n\n—she brought that onto the show, too.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nCan I have a couple of kisses when I come home?\n\narchived recording\n\nMhm.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nOK. I’ll just sneak them, all right?\n\narchived recording\n\nHow are you going to sneak them?\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nI’ll just kiss you real quietly.\n\narchived recording\n\nHow?\n\nandy mills\n\nAnd then, one day in 1990—\n\narchived recording\n\nThe skies of Baghdad have been filled up with the sound of gunfire here tonight.\n\nandy mills\n\n—the show unexpectedly broadened.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nThe tone of the show changed dramatically the night that Desert Storm happened.\n\narchived recording (george hw bush)\n\nThis conflict started August 2 when the dictator of Iraq invaded a small and helpless neighbor. Kuwait—\n\nandy mills\n\nFor whatever reason, in the midst of this geopolitical event, people turned to her.\n\ndelilah\n\nThe phone lines into my studio melted down. People were scared and they were upset and they were afraid for their children, their kids that were in the military, and what does this mean. And it was terrifying. So those things began to change the scope, the flavor of the show from just being about romance and falling in love and getting married and breaking up to, really, the human experience.\n\nandy mills\n\nAnd Delilah says that in her career, there’s essentially before that night and after that night.\n\narchived recording (caller)\n\nHi. Is this Delilah?\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nYes, it is. Who’s this?\n\narchived recording (caller)\n\nThis is Lorna. Three months ago I called you when my son got in an accident and he was burned.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nOh. I remember talking to you. How is he?\n\narchived recording (caller)\n\nHe’s sitting right here beside me. Would you like to talk to him?\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nI would love to!\n\narchived recording (caller 1)\n\nMy husband for six years was struggling with drug abuse and things like that. And our family was basically falling apart.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nThat’ll do it.\n\narchived recording (caller 1)\n\nYeah.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nDrug abuse—\n\nandy mills\n\nIt wasn’t just the nature of the calls that had changed. She also finally started to get that big audience that she had always wanted.\n\ndelilah\n\nI was high as a kite thinking, oh, my God! My dream has come true. I’m syndicated on four stations! I’m Delilah on the new 94.1 The Sound. And within a month or two, we were up to six stations.\n\narchived recording\n\nYou’re here with Delilah. KQXD, San Antonio.\n\ndelilah\n\nAnd then we hit a dozen stations. Oh! [RADIO LOGO MUSIC PLAYING]\n\narchived recording\n\nEasy 93.1. Join the conversation. Call Delilah.\n\ndelilah\n\nIt was so amazing. [MUSIC - THEME, “DELILAH”]\n\narchived recording\n\nDelilah.\n\nandy mills\n\nAnd that brings us to now. 25 years later, Delilah is syndicated on over 160 radio stations around the country, has many millions of listeners every night, more attention than even she ever dreamed. But when we went out looking for her, trying to track her down for this conversation, we were surprised by where we found her.\n\ndelilah\n\nI live my life. Take care of my kids and check homework and ride horses and can salsa, can pears, can apples, can applesauce. You know, what your grandma used to do.\n\nandy mills\n\nAfter years of jumping around from city to city, growing her show, Delilah had ultimately moved back to a small town in the Pacific Northwest where, again, she is living on a farm, just like she did when she was a little girl. But now, she’s surrounded by a family of her own creation.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nAnd how many kids do you have, can I ask?\n\ndelilah\n\nI have 15. And my husband has five.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nWow.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nShe lives with a lot of people.\n\ndelilah\n\nTwo elderly parents.\n\nbianca giaever\n\n10 horses. Two zebras.\n\ndelilah\n\nThree dogs.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nThree emus, some pigs, sheep, goats, chickens.\n\ndelilah\n\nTwo cats.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nAnd her husband.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nHow many times have you been married?\n\ndelilah\n\nOh, too many to count. [LAUGHTER]\n\nbianca giaever\n\nFour times by our count. And as we got to ask her the sorts of questions that she’s usually asking her listeners—\n\ndelilah\n\nI got married to my first husband, the man that I loved when I was 21, George. He was like a character in a movie. He was so charming. But not so faithful, if you know what I mean.\n\nandy mills\n\nWe saw just how familiar she is with so much of what it is that they’re going through.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nAnd then when we divorced, I jumped out of the frying pan into the fire. And I had a very brief six week marriage that was annulled to a man named Gary, who turned out to be a drug addict. It was a really bad decision made on the rebound. But really good for me in that it got me into 12 step programs.\n\nandy mills\n\nFrom heartache and addiction to all the complexities that come from being a part of a family.\n\ndelilah\n\nMy husband was black and our son is mixed. My second husband is Hispanic. And so our two children were mixed. Now I’ve added many, many, many more children through adoption. But what I didn’t realize when I started adopting kids with chronic illnesses is that sometimes they don’t survive.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nShe’s lost two children, one to sickle cell anemia, another to suicide.\n\ndelilah\n\nMy sister and my kids took turns babysitting me, basically, for a month or two until I could even breathe.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nAnd she said that the one thing that got her through all of this was other people.\n\ndelilah\n\nOh, my God. The calls, the letters, the cards, just unbelievable outpouring of love, not just from my listeners, but my community. So you know, love, love got us through and will get us through no matter what. But people who don’t have that kind of support, I hope that my show is support for them. I hope that my voice and my words is love for them.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nYeah, I mean, there’s so many people who don’t know that anybody loves them.\n\ndelilah\n\nYeah. And I try every day to say on the radio, you know, you are loved. When anybody listens, I want them to hear love. I want them to hear peace. I want them to hear hope, especially now.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nHi, Alyssa. What are you grateful for?\n\narchived recording (caller)\n\nI’m grateful for my boyfriend. I actually just got fired from my job yesterday. He’s been such an inspiration. I mean, I’ve put him through hell. And I honestly feel kind of guilty because I lost my job. But I was hoping that you could play a song for him just to show him how much I appreciate him and everything that he’s done for me, even though that I’m in a really rough spot right now.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nOK. Before we have this conversation, I want you to know that I have been fired 12 times. So there’s no judgment on my part, ever.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nThese days, Delilah is doing her show from the farm, five nights a week, five hours a night.\n\ndelilah\n\nI take the calls all night long, starting at about 6:30 or 7 o’clock. And I’m in the studio until 11 or 12 o’clock West Coast time.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nHow many calls are you typically getting in a night?\n\ndelilah\n\nWell, the number of calls we get is crazy. It’s, like, 20, 30,000 a night to our 800 number.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nOh, my gosh.\n\ndelilah\n\nYeah. [LAUGHTER]\n\nandy mills\n\nAnd while this past year she has been broadcasting amidst the pandemic and protests and through an incredibly polarizing election, when you listen to the show this year, it sounds almost identical to how it’s always sounded.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nHi. Good evening. Who is this?\n\narchived recording (caller)\n\nThis is Tracy.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nTracy, what can I do for you?\n\narchived recording (caller)\n\nI’m trying really hard to be in the Christmas spirit. But I lost my mom to breast cancer seven weeks ago today. And it’s the first Christmas that she won’t be with us. So I was hoping maybe you could play, I’ll Have A Blue christmas for me and my sisters as we try and get through this first holiday without her.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nI will do that. But here’s my only piece of advice to you, just give yourself permission to feel whatever it is you’re feeling without thinking, oh, it’s the holidays. I have to do this or I have to do that or I have to get into the holiday spirit. This is Delilah. How are you tonight?\n\narchived recording (caller 1)\n\nI’m OK. I’m missing my husband. He’s in the military. And he’s been gone for quite some time now.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nAs she fights back tears.\n\narchived recording (caller 1)\n\nOh, it’s pretty miserable.\n\ndelilah\n\nWhen anybody listens, I don’t want them to hear frustration. I don’t want them to hear panic. I don’t want them to hear politics or bipartisan division.\n\narchived recording (caller 2)\n\nI have been listening to you for years, my boyfriend and I both. He is currently in jail.\n\ndelilah\n\nI want people to feel love in a very tangible way.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nWhat is his drug of choice? And what is yours?\n\narchived recording (caller 3)\n\nHis drug of choice was heroin, as was mine. We have both been clean for four years.\n\narchived recording (delilah)\n\nWow. I’m really proud of you. I mean that from the bottom of my heart. You’re taking care of a lot of people.\n\nandy mills\n\nThe more that I’ve thought about it, the more I think that the reason I responded to Delilah the way that I did, driving around in my car, is exactly this. She sounds the same. Nothing about what Delilah is doing has changed. But everything else feels so profoundly different. So that in this moment, this super simple thing that she’s been doing for decades, it feels, in its sincerity, radical. To just listen to people, to perform the most essential act of love, giving people attention, this thing that she’s always understood that she wanted and she needed. Right now, it’s almost subversive in its earnestness.\n\ndelilah\n\nI want to touch hearts. And I want to bring joy. And even with all the craziness going on in the world, I believe I was born for such a time as this. That now more than ever we need hope. I know it sounds corny, but it’s true.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nDelilah, and I say this with complete respect can be corny, cheesy at times. But after this year and everything that we’ve been through, that cheesiness, that sincerity feels kind of perfect.\n\n[music - whitney houston, \"i will always love you\"]\n\narchived recording (whitney houston)\n\nIf I should stay—\n\ndelilah\n\nA love song needs a lyric that tells a story.\n\narchived recording (whitney houston)\n\nI would only be in your way.\n\ndelilah\n\nAnd touches your heart, either makes you laugh, or makes you cry, or makes you swoon.\n\narchived recording (whitney houston)\n\nBut I know I’ll think of you every step of the way.\n\ndelilah\n\nDolly Parton’s I Will Always Love You, later recorded by Whitney, one of the best love songs lyrically ever written.\n\narchived recording (whitney houston)\n\nAnd I will always love you.\n\ndelilah\n\nShe’s saying I can’t be with you. Because to be with you would hurt you. So it’s a Shakespearean tragedy in a four minute song.\n\narchived recording (whitney houston)\n\nLove you.\n\nYou.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nIs cheesiness an essential part of love?\n\ndelilah\n\nCheesiness is a definite essential part of love.\n\n[music - van morrison, \"crazy love\"]\n\narchived recording (van morrison)\n\nI can hear her heartbeat—\n\ndelilah\n\nSappy, cheesy, cliche is a part of love.\n\narchived recording (van morrison)\n\nYeah, the heavens open every time she smiles.\n\nbianca giaever\n\nWell, thank you so much, Delilah.\n\nandy mills\n\nYeah, thank you so much, Delilah. This has been really great.\n\ndelilah\n\nAll right, thank you, guys. Bye bye.\n\narchived recording (van morrison)\n\nYet I’m running to her like a river’s song. She give me love, love, love— [STATIC]\n\n[flipping through radio music channels]\n\narchived recording\n\n(SINGING) I saw a man brought to life. (SINGING) say that you want me.\n\n[music - tlc, \"waterfalls\"]\n\narchived recording\n\n(SINGING) Don’t go chasing waterfalls. [MULTIPLE SONGS PLAYING]:\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHere’s what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson)\n\nWhen the science changes, we must change our response. When the virus changes its method of attack, we must change our method of defense.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn a dramatic move, Britain locked down the greater London area over the weekend, citing the out of control transmission of a new variation of the coronavirus.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson)\n\nResidents in those areas must stay at home, apart from limited exemptions set out in law. Non-essential retail, indoor gyms and leisure facilities, and personal care services must close.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn a speech on Saturday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that the new variation may be 70 percent more transmissible than the original and would require major sacrifices during the holiday season.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson)\n\nGiven the early evidence we have on this new variant of the virus, the potential risk it poses, it is with a very heavy heart I must tell you we cannot continue with Christmas as planned.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSoon after, several neighboring European countries closed their borders to British citizens to avoid importing the new strain of the virus. And—\n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell)\n\nWe can finally report what our nation has needed to hear for a very long time. More help is on the way.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Sunday night, Congress finally reached a deal on a stimulus bill that will create enhanced federal unemployment benefits of $300 per week for up to 11 weeks and give many Americans $600 in one time direct payments. Those direct payments will go to both adults and children, meaning that an eligible family of four would receive $2,400. Today’s episode was produced by Andy Mills and Bianca Giaever with help from Leslye Davis. It was edited by Sara Sarasohn, Wendy Dorr, and Lisa Tobin and engineered by Chris Wood. That’s it for The Daily. I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow."
