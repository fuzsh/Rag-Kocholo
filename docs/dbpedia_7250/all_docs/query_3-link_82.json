        "text": "Woah there! Well how is this for a guilty pleasure?\n\n“Don't Wanna Fall In Love” is taken from Jane Child's self-titled debut album, which droppped in 1989. And boy, did this synthtastic track cling on to what was left of the 80s for dear fucking life!\n\nThis song sat at #2 on the US chart for three weeks, kept from the top spot by Sinead O'Connor's ballad-that-was-actually-penned-by-Prince, “Nothing Compares 2 U.” Not that we are bitter or anything...\n\nIn all honesty, there is little else to tell you about Child, as she pretty much defines “one hit wonder.” She's probably working as a lunch lady nowadays or something like that. Oh, and living with her husband, totally contradicting the lyrical content of this song...\n\nBut most importantly - we wonder if she's still rocking her nose chain?\n\nLyrics:\n\nAin't no personal thing boy\n\nbut you have got to stay away\n\nfar, far away from my heart, my heart\n\ndon't you know what your kiss is doing\n\nlet me tell it to you from the start, boy\n\nI don't wanna fall in love, no no\n\nLove cuts just like a knife, woo woo\n\nYou make the knife feel good baby\n\nI'll fight you to the end\n\nYou've been hanging around boy\n\nAnd you have started sinking in\n\nWhoa baby you're way out of line now\n\nunaware how this all got started\n\nlet me tell it to you one more time boy\n\nI don't wanna fall in love no no\n\nlove cuts just like a knife woo woo\n\nyou make the knife feel good baby\n\nI'll fight you to the end\n\nrepeat\n\nI learned something about myself\n\nlast night with you I knew\n\nI didn't want nobody else\n\nAnd your scaring me to death now baby\n\nI don't wanna fall in love no no\n\nlove cuts just like a knife woo woo\n\nyou make the knife feel good baby\n\nI'll fight you to the end\n\nI don't wanna fall in love no no\n\nLove cuts just like a knife woo woo\n\nyou make the knife feel good baby\n\nI'll fight you to the end\n\nLike, Follow or Talk Shit About us here:\n\nwww.Facebook.com/BitCandy\n\nwww.Twitter.com/BitCandy"
