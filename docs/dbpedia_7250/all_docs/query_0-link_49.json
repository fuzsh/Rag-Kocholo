        "text": "While Pride month is in full swing come June, the LGBTQ+ community should be celebrated year-round. The best way to let the world know you're queer and you're here is by playing the best gay songs on full blast. Blasting bops made by LGBTQ+ artists like Sam Smith and King Princess, as well as icons like Whitney Houston and Madonna, make life more colorful â€” especially during fierce Pride events and parades. Plus, you already know we've queued up gay anthems by drag performers like Katya, Priyanka, and TikTok's fave duo, Sugar and Spice.\n\nWith federal and state governments threatening to silence queer voices through anti-LGBTQ+ \"Don't Say Gay\" legislation and laws limiting and banning gender-affirming care, it is a crucial time to uplift the queer community, whether it's through the songs we listen to or the movies we watch. We can celebrate the rich history of the community by brushing up on the meanings behind LGBTQ+ flags, and we can help pave a bright future by donating to queer-led organizations like GLAAD, The Trevor Project, and the Human Rights Campaign.\n\nPassing the Pride month vibe check also extends to the aux cord. If you're headed to an event and need to throw on an epic playlist that honors and uplifts the queer community, look no further. Get ready to put viral singles courtesy of LGBTQ+ artists and producers on repeat. We can't forget about blasts from the past at the hands of music icons. Get ready to transform your playlist because here are our favorite Pride songs to get you in the spirit this month and beyond."
