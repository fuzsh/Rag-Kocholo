        "text": "The chain makes you nervous. Two gold lengths run from a ring in Jane Child's ear to a ring in her nose. The chain is not considered attractive by conventional American standards, although Child says it's a symbol of faith and marital devotion in India. Child _ an up-and-coming pop artist with one hit under her belt, the infectiously danceable Don't Wanna Fall in Love _ has her own reasons for wearing the chain. \"It's like a \"f--- you' to my face,\" she said recently by phone from her Los Angeles home. \"It's like I never saw myself as one of those model/singer types. It's like a \"f--- you' to that. I know people think it undercuts my looks, and that's why I like it.\"\n\nStill, she is pretty, with or without the chain; with or without the hairdo that mixes ankle-length braids and a flared-out spike (Child's real hair, her publicist swears).\n\nThe chain has created a buzz in the pop world via the video for Don't Wanna Fall in Love, which earned high rotation on MTV. Still, the chain creates a subtle tension. It makes you vaguely uneasy. What if she catches it on something? What if some creep reaches out and yanks it?\n\nChild snickers. But she knows it's not funny. As her fame increases, so do the chances that the chain could cause her physical pain. Acerbic comic Sandra Bernhard has made cracks about wanting to \"rip that thing,\" says Child. \"I don't think that's cool. I won't live in fear, although I don't know how much I'll go out in a crowd alone with it anymore. I used to wear it all the time.\"\n\nTo hear her tell it, alone is what Jane Child is most of the time. But never lonely. She lives alone, has no boyfriend, no crowd to hang with. \"I live in Hollywood, the land of bull----,\" she says. People try to befriend her now, pull her into their circle because of her celebrity. But she'll have none of it.\n\nAnother thing Child does alone is work. She wrote, produced and performed her self-titled debut album (to be totally accurate, guitar parts are credited to James Harrah). She's only the second artist at Warner Bros. Records to gain such autonomy straight away. The first: Prince.\n\nWorking meticulously with just an engineer, Child crafted an album that is taut and urgent, one that funks and rocks at the same time. The bubbly Don't Wanna Fall In Love is something of an aberration among nine tracks that tend to be a bit darker, more abrasive. Jane Child is a solid first step, if a bit uneven.\n\nShe's a complex kid, this 23-year-old from Toronto. Child wants to be known strictly as a musician. That's a tough one. Today's pop fans want glamor. She's young and exotic-looking, but will not play the stereotypical star. She builds walls while trying to reach out to millions with her music.\n\nFunny thing is, Child is likable _ she's candid, forthright, responsive to any and all questions. Unlike most other budding pop stars, she's not loath to tread on personal territory.\n\nShe was an outcast through most of her childhood. It caused her \"tons of pain.\"\n\n\"From the time I first started school to when I left at 15, I always desperately wanted to fit in,\" Child says. \"I never did. They never allowed it. I thought the best way to fit in was to be great at stuff. I strived to be the greatest _ at grades, music, track and field, whatever. They don't like you for that. They like you for being mediocre.\"\n\nBoth of Child's parents are highly regarded classical musicians. She began serious study at age 5: piano and voice from her mother, violin and harmony from her father. Child was accepted at Canada's Royal Conservatory of Music. Rock 'n' roll was not permitted in a home ruled by the classics, but Jane's clandestine bedroom listening sessions on a transistor radio made a profound impression. She dropped out of school and joined a regional rock band. Soon, Child began cutting demonstration tapes on her own around Toronto; she gravitated to New York, then Los Angeles, all the while making low-budget demos.\n\nAlthough Child wasn't represented by management, her tapes began to make the rounds at major record labels. One of her demos made it into Jonathan Demme's film Married to the Mob. Several record-biz moguls were impressed. A bidding war ensued.\n\n\"All of these labels wanted me to go with them,\" Child says. \"The money got ridiculous. I had poeple like David Geffen, other label heads calling me at home asking me what I wanted.\"\n\nShe wanted total control. \"I didn't think any (outside producer) could hear what was going on in my head,\" Child explains.\"\n\nFinally, Child says, all the labels gave up their arguments, relented and offered her autonomy. \"I'd be in a boardroom with like six (executives) and me,\" Child says. \"I wasn't exactly slamming my fist on the table, but I held firm.\"\n\nShe chose Warner Bros. for its reputation as an \"artists\" label with an eye toward a long-term career.\n\nThe sessions for Jane Child were slow and exacting. She layered virtually all the instrumental parts and did at least 32 vocal tracks per song. With no producer, Child worked without someone as a sounding board. \"The engineer would say, \"Jane, it's fine,' and then I'd sing it for another week,\" Child says ruefully, calling herself a \"raving perfectionist.\"\n\nDon't Wanna Fall in Love, with its stabbing synthesizer riff and soaring hook, glided up the charts. \"I've been asked if I was surprised when it became a hit,\" Child says. \"And in all honesty it wasn't the weirdest thing that ever happened.\"\n\nNow begins an even more crucial stage. Child's stardom could be boosted, or she could go the way of a one-hit-wonder.\n\nThe second single, Welcome to the Real World is not the obvious hit its predecessor was. It's an edgy rock track spiced with grinding guitar and a kicking backbeat. The melody is menacing, the message tough, bleak.\n\nJane Child may be a loner, but she doesn't lack for optimism.\n\n\"This is the song I wanted for first single,\" she says, proving that she doesn't call all the shots in her career. \"I think it better represents me and the album, but it still has a funk bass to it, it's still danceable, it's pretty infectious. I really believe black radio is gonna hear it and claim it.\""
