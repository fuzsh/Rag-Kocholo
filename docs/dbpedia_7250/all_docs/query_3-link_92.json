Teddy Riley liked Jane's original version so much that he made a remix version that ended up become more popular at the dance clubs (especially Club MTV & The Party Machine).\n\nTHINKTIMM\n\nThe Remix CD was one of the first CD's that I purchased... in 1990 CD's were still kind of a newer format... I remember taping the entire Remix CD on cassette for my walkman. It's crazy how times have progressed.\n\nTHINKTIMM... if nothing else!!!\n\nmusicman\n\nAlexdeParis said:\n\nlazycrockett said:\n\nThe lyrics \"you cut like a knife, you make the knife feel good\" always bothered me.\n\n\"I don't wanna fall in love\n\nLove cuts just like a knife\n\nYou make the knife feel good\"\n\nI like that line.

I really digged that chain she had on her lip..lol.\n\nI bet she works in a donut shop now--figures.\n\nJane Child's a great musician who no doubt keeps up with technological innovations. There's always work for someone who knows his/her instrument. Ask Chuckii Booker. Just because one's not in the public eye doesn't mean they're working \"in a donut shop\".\n\nMusicians are musicians - that's their trade/how they pay the bills. Shoot, giving music lessons is lucrative in itself. There are more than a few ways to make a living in music. I'm sure Miss Child is doing fine...\n\nMy author page: https://www.amazon.com/au...eretttruth\n\nChristopher\n\nAlexdeParis said:\n\nlazycrockett said:\n\nThe lyrics \"you cut like a knife, you make the knife feel good\" always bothered me.\n\n\"I don't wanna fall in love\n\nLove cuts just like a knife\n\nYou make the knife feel good\"\n\nI like that line.

I really digged that chain she had on her lip..lol.\n\nI bet she works in a donut shop now--figures.\n\nI think Jane Child is one of those people that is stil around, probably working on an album for like ten years now or something.\n\nThat song was the jam. The albumw as OK, too.\n\nTom\n\ndidn't Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis produce some of the songs off her debut album? I think I remember seeing their names in the liner notes.\n\nIt was a good album, but from the cover you almost got the impression it was going to be an industrial album or something, when the music inside sounded quite different.\n\nHer hair was freaky, it was like a cross between Crystal Gale and a mullet.\n\nSoulAlive\n\nEverlastingNow said:\n\nI thought it was Sheila E the first time I heard that song.\n\nsame here! I don't know why,but this sounds like a Sheila E. song to me.When I first heard it,I really thought it was Sheila's new single.\n\nBlaqueKnight\n\nTom said:\n\ndidn't Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis produce some of the songs off her debut album? I think I remember seeing their names in the liner notes.\n\nNo. Jimmy & Terry had nothing to do with her first record. Her brother contributed a little guitar work if I'm not mistaken but thats about it. She was self-produced.\n\nShe became very adept at programming the Fairlight synthesizer. In the 80s, it was a big, bulky and complex computer workstation that very few people knew how to use. She used it better than practically anyone in my opinion.\n\n[Edited 10/20/06 6:12am]"
