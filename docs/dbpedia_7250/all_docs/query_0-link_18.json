And soon, her numbers across streaming platforms, social media and YouTube followed suit.\n\n“I was like, this is so sick. This is a big show, and my song is on it,” said the 20-year-old artist. “Then I started seeing TikToks of people talking about my song specifically in the show. Not only was the show doing well, but this song stood out to a lot of the watchers, so I was kind of taken back because it wasn’t what I was expecting at all.”\n\nFans loved Constellations so much that they began posting their own covers and clips of the song.\n\n“That was so cool,” said LeMac.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWriting songs since she was age 12, LeMac says hearing music in shows has meant a lot to her as a viewer.\n\n“It’s such a great way to connect and relate to a song, finding them through shows,” said LeMac, pointing to Sleeping at Last’s songs on Grey’s Anatomy as personal favourites. “Not only are you relating to the show and connecting with these characters, but then once you find that perfect song in that perfect scene, it means so much more.”\n\nGetting that perfect song in that perfect scene is the job of the music supervisor. And in the case of LeMac’s big break, that came through Vancouver supervisor Natasha Duprey.\n\nA music supervisor since 2004, Duprey says that when she tells people her job title, the first response she gets is often: “What’s that?”\n\n“The short answer is, ‘I say I work in film. I work in music,'” said Duprey. “When you hear a song in a movie — I do that.”\n\nThe next thing she hears is usually, “Oh my God, that’s totally my dream job,” which prompts Duprey to explain the job isn’t just listening to music all day.\n\n“I explain to them a little more about all the negotiations of contracts and spreadsheets, and the people part of it. And then they don’t think it’s their dream job as much,” said the award-winning Duprey, whose company is called Must Be Nice Productions, as in “it must be nice to have a job where you get paid to listen to music all day.”\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWhile a music supervisor’s job does involve a lot of contracts and conversations, at its heart, it’s about enhancing the mood. Think about it: What would the scene where Barbie meets her creator be like without Billie Eilish’s What Was I Made For playing? Or what about the very last scene in The Sopranos without Journey’s Don’t Stop Believin’?\n\nHard to imagine, right?\n\n“Try and watch a show without music and the emotions are totally different,” said Duprey. “That’s the thing when there are the big moments in movies … That song, that score it is really playing up the tragedy, or playing up the romance, or the sadness. If you turn the music off in those really big moments, it doesn’t turn up the intensity or bring the lump up in your throat in the same way.”\n\nWhen the music supervisor has done their job well, those on-screen marriages of music and mood are forever imprinted on the viewer.\n\n“I can’t hear Peter Gabriel’s In Your Eyes without seeing that scene. I bet that’s the same for a lot of people,” said Duprey about the moment in the John Hughes film Say Anything when Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) holds up the boombox and blasts the track toward Diane Court’s (Ione Skye’s) bedroom window.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nA curving path\n\nDuprey’s work — like the many people who work in TV and film — is building back to full steam after a handful of years marked by industry-wide shutdowns due to COVID-19 and the writers’ and actors’ strikes.\n\nThis year so far, Duprey has been contracted to work on 12 TV series and 12 movies.\n\nDuprey, whose recent credits include the summer box-office hit and the highest grossing indie/horror film of the last decade, Longlegs starring Nicholas Cage, and the upcoming horror thriller feature Heretic starring Hugh Grant, and the TV shows Animal Control, Murder in a Small Town, My Life With the Walter Boys, and Snowpiercer, didn’t start out with plans to become a music supervisor.\n\n“I have a degree in communications from SFU,” said Duprey. “I kind of wanted to do a Don Draper in Mad Men for some weird reason, be an ad person. But I took a little bit of a detour along the way.”\n\nThat detour was into the Canadian music business and a decade-long career in artist management working with acts like 54-40, Junkhouse and Copyright. But, as digital technology hammered artists’ bottom lines, she realized she wanted a more stable financial future.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“I wanted to make money. And there was no money in the music industry — with MP3s and everything, the industry was really shrinking,” said Duprey. “I had always been a bit more of a film nerd than a music nerd, and so I just kind of figured out a way to weasel my way into the industry.”\n\nRight out of the gate, she landed jobs on the TV shows The Dead Zone and the L-Word.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nThe start of something big\n\nDuprey begins her relationship with a project by reading the script.\n\nFrom there, she gets a sense of “the vibe,” and with the project’s budget firmly top of mind, she sets out to build a “palette” for the show or film.\n\nShe digs into a vast personal iTunes library filled with hundreds of thousands of songs that she has separated into folders with names like: Heroic Defeat, Aggressive Empowerment, Country Beers and Boys, Break-up Songs Good News, and Break-up Songs Bad News. She then compiles a playlist for the showrunner and director, who have the final say.\n\n“If you’re doing a Netflix series for young adults, you’re not going to send them some Frank Sinatra croony jazz for boomers,” said Duprey.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe director and showrunner are presented with many options, sometimes up to 20 songs for one scene.\n\n“She was hugely involved in the Vancouver music scene in the ’80s and ’90s, so she just has this sort of bedrock knowledge, but it is also the approach of a fan, in a way. She loves music,” said Michael MacLennan, a Toronto- and Los Angeles-based screenwriter/producer/showrunner who has worked many times with Duprey, including on the shows Tiny Pretty Things, The Guard and Bletchley Circle.\n\n“She has really varied tastes. And she just has that ability, a sort of encyclopedic knowledge combined with impeccable instincts, and that’s what you are looking for in a music supervisor. Somebody that is going to take you out of the obvious and introduce you to things that are maybe more cutting edge, maybe more affordable and maybe not the usual suspects,” added MacLennan.\n\nMore than just music\n\nDuprey’s deep-cut knowledge is a huge plus in her role.\n\n“It’s mind-boggling the depth of what she knows across all genres,” said Todd Giroux, a Vancouver-based associate producer/post-producer who has worked with Duprey for a decade and a half.\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThis wide knowledge of obscure and indie music is very much a bonus as not every production has enough money to license a Coldplay cut or Beatles tune.\n\nDuprey says, when it comes to costs, she has secured songs from anywhere between $500 all the way up to $300,000. As for the question of what it costs to license a Coldplay or Beatles song, Duprey says there is no Blue Book for music licensing. Every situation is different and the cost depends on various factors.\n\nIn addition to meeting budget demands, Duprey admits licensing a lesser-known artist pleases her as a former artist manager.\n\n“Their revenue streams have really shrunk,” said Duprey. “I’m putting some money in their pockets that they’re not getting anywhere else.”\n\nPlus, it’s great advertising for an artist.\n\n“The fan base can exponentially grow. You get your song in a Netflix show, there could be like 70 million people hearing your song. And 70 million people are not hearing it on Spotify or the radio,” added Duprey.\n\nMy Life With the Walter Boys showrunner Melanie Halsall says getting the music right in a show, especially one geared to teens and young adults, is paramount.\n\nAdvertisement 9\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“Music is such a big part of any show,” said Halsall, who is currently shooting the second season of the series in Calgary. “Music affects all different kinds of things, from emotions to situations … for young audiences. They have very specific music tastes.”\n\nA restrictive music budget can be the mother of invention, adds Halsall.\n\n“You have to be more creative when you have a lesser budget because you can’t get all the really well-known songs by big names,” said Halsall. “It’s a chance to be more creative and think outside the box. And to look for more unusual artists and talent. And Natasha is amazing at that.”\n\nIn addition to licensing songs, Duprey is responsible for anything musical in the show or film that isn’t a composed score. So, if somebody is singing a song, if somebody is humming a song, if there’s a violinist playing a song, it all falls to her to get the music cleared and licensed.\n\n“It’s not that we have great taste in music. We kind of have to have no taste in music, in a way, because we have to fit ourselves into what that show needs,” said Duprey. “It’s not about what we like, it’s what is best for the scene, the show and the creatives involved.”\n\nAdvertisement 10\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWhile she considers herself a connector not a creator, she admits she leans into the creative aspect of her job, noting that different productions afford different levels of creativity.\n\n“You kind of have to think of your audience. You don’t want to take them out of the vibe they’re in,” said Duprey. “If you’re in a rom com you can kind of twist it a little, but you don’t want to twist it too much.\n\n“Where I find I can twist it the most is in more of a horror sci-fi genre. Snowpiercer is a good example of that. The world has ended, we’re all on a train in the frozen Earth with all the last humans in humanity going around the world. And f—ed things are happening on the train. So the showrunner on that show kind of gave a lot of licence to do something weird because you’re already suspending disbelief.”\n\nEnter: Tiny Tim’s Tiptoe Through the Tulips during a murder scene.\n\nAs for whether Duprey has a favourite song placement as a viewer of TV and film, she does: “I love the show Six Feet Under and the Sia song Breathe Me that ends the entire series is insane,” said Duprey. “Basically, they play the whole song and they show all the main characters aging then dying.\n\nAdvertisement 11\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n“So, it ties everything up with a bow.”\n\n25 most memorable movie/TV song moments\n\nWhen it comes to a scene in a TV show or film, the right song in the right place is truly a vibe-enhancer. Here are some of our favourite song-and-scene combinations:\n\nSinging in the Rain, by Gene Kelly\n\nFrom the film: Singing in the Rain (1952)\n\nThis is by far one of the most famous songs from a movie. Kelly’s song and dance in the film is legendary. But the song gets a reboot when Alex (Malcolm McDowell) sings it during a truly terrifying scene in A Clockwork Orange in 1971.\n\nEverybody’s Talkin’ (Echoes), by Harry Nilsson\n\nFrom the film: Midnight Cowboy (1969)\n\nWritten and recorded by American singer-songwriter Fred Neil in 1966, Nilsson’s version became a hit in 1969 after it was featured in the beginning of the film Midnight Cowboy.\n\nOld Time Rock & Roll, by Bob Seger\n\nFrom the film: Risky Business (1983)\n\nTom Cruise wearing only a shirt, underpants, sports socks and, of course, those Ray-Ban Wayfarer sunglasses, sliding into the frame lip-synching to this 1979 classic rock staple is the definition of iconic.\n\nAdvertisement 12\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 13\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nPurple Rain, by Prince\n\nFrom the film: Purple Rain (1984)\n\nPrince on a motorbike in purple leathers is an image no one can (or wants to) forget. This song became one of his biggest hits. And if the artist had a theme song, this would probably be it.\n\nDon’t You (Forget About Me), by Simple Minds\n\nFrom the film: The Breakfast Club (1985) and The Handmaid’s Tale (2017)\n\nThis song has two iconic placements. First it played as a finally happy Bender (Judd Nelson) strode across the football field and gave the perfect fist pump. It came back in 2017 for the ending of The Handmaid’s Tale Season 1, Episode 2 and succinctly expressed what Offred (Elizabeth Moss), and other women can’t: a deep urge to rebel against the horrifying and oppressive system of Gilead.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 14\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n9 to 5, by Dolly Parton\n\nFrom the film: 9 to 5 (1985)\n\nBecause you must include Dolly Parton whenever you can — it’s the law — 9 to 5 comes from the movie of the same name co-starring Jane Fonda and Lilly Tomlin. The tune went on to become one of Parton’s biggest hits and a feminist anthem. Oh, and there’s this: “When I actually wrote this song, I used my acrylic nails on the set when I was writing it,” Parton told Vogue in 2019. “They make noise that kind of sounds like a typewriter.”\n\nStand by Me, by Ben E. King\n\nFrom the film: Stand By Me (1986)\n\nFor the 1986 film of the same name, the King soul classic found a whole new audience thanks to its use in this perfect coming-of-age film from Rob Reiner.\n\n(I’ve Had the) Time of My Life, by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes\n\nFrom the film: Dirty Dancing (1987)\n\nThis top pick karaoke duo track is the perfect build-up song for that big dance finale. Warning: don’t try the lift, as YouTube can confirm, it often goes sideways.\n\nIn Your Eyes, by Peter Gabriel\n\nFrom the film: Say Anything (1989)\n\nFrom John Hughes’ classic film this boombox serenade went on to become a go-to tune for the first dance at Gen X weddings.\n\nAdvertisement 15\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 16\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBohemian Rhapsody, by Queen\n\nFrom the film: Wayne’s World (1992)\n\nWayne and Garth’s (Mike Myers and Dana Carvey) headbanging along to this Queen anthem in the Mirthmobile, Garth’s 1976 AMC Pacer, is pure joy and may make you hurl from laughing so hard.\n\nI Will Always Love You, by Whitney Houston\n\nFrom the film: The Bodyguard (1992)\n\nOh, look we can mention Parton again, yeah. Parton’s 1973 track got a David Foster and Whitney Houston makeover for the soundtrack for the movie The Bodyguard. And boom, it became a massive hit.\n\nStuck in the Middle with You, by Stealers Wheel\n\nFrom the film: Reservoir Dogs (1992)\n\nThis track (recorded in 1972) plays in the Quentin Tarantino film as Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) dances around and gets serious with a knife during a gruesome torture scene. This placement is a great example of how a scene can change the way we hear a song forever.\n\nI’ll Be There For You, by The Rembrandts\n\nFrom the show: Friends (1994)\n\nThe song, written for the show Friends, gained immense fame as it played during the show’s iconic opening sequence. Soon, radio picked up the short theme and then, clap, clap, clap, clap, the band wrote additional verses and, in 1995, put it on their third studio album.\n\nAdvertisement 17\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nLust for Life, by Iggy Pop\n\nFrom the film: Trainspotting (1996)\n\nPop’s 1977 banger, co-written by David Bowie, opens the Danny Boyle film with a kinetic bang.

The song was back on the big screen 19 years later in the Elton John biopic, Rocketman.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 19\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nI’m a Believer, by Donkey (Eddie Murphy)\n\nFrom the film: Shrek (2001)\n\nThe song was first written by Neil Diamond and recorded by The Monkeys in 1966, but a whole new generation fell in love with it when Donkey (Eddie Murphy) sang it at the party after Shrek (Myers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz) got married. Smash Mouth, which also gave us the catchy All Star to open the 2001 film, do I’m a Believer on the soundtrack album.\n\nLose Yourself (8 Mile), by Eminem\n\nFrom the film: 8 Mile (2002)\n\nEminem’s autobiographical movie was a resounding success for the rapper. Anchoring the super-successful soundtrack was Lose Yourself. Masterfully produced by Dr. Dre, the song is like a plot map for the movie.\n\nBreathe Me, by Sia\n\nFrom the show: Six Feet Under (2005)\n\nOne of the best finales to any TV show — ever — was Six Feet Under’s exit. While Breathe Me played, viewers saw the characters age and then die.\n\nHow to Save a Life, by The Fray\n\nFrom the show: Grey’s Anatomy (2006)\n\nThis song fittingly plays in Season 2 of Grey’s Anatomy during a montage of surgery scenes.

While the Soprano family trickled into the diner, the song played, and viewers wondered who was going to get whacked. And, in the spirit of omertà, that’s all we are going to say.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAdvertisement 21\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nI Think We’re Alone Now, by Tiffany\n\nFrom the show: The Umbrella Academy (2019)\n\nIn the very first episode of the Netflix show, the Hargreeves kids dance, in separate rooms, to Tiffany’s 1987 cover of I Think We’re Alone Now.
