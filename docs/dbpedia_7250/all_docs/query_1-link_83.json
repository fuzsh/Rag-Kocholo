        "text": "Kara Young is the first black actress to be nominated three consecutive times for a Tony Award. Previously receiving nominations for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play: in 2022 for the role of Letitia in Clyde's, in 2023 for the role of Jess in Cost of Living, and winning in 2024 for the role of Lutiebell Gussie Mae Jenkins in Purlie Victorious.\n\nHamilton (2016) holds the record as the most-nominated production in Tony history, with 16. In second place are The Producers, the new Mel Brooks musical (2001), Billy Elliot, The Musical (2009), and Jagged Little Pill (2020) with 15 each. The Producers is the most-winning production, triumphing in 12 categories including Best Musical.\n\nDirector/producer Harold Prince received 21 Tonys, the most for any individual in multiple categories. These include eight for directing, eight for producing, two as producer of the year’s Best Musical, and three special Tony Awards. (Roger Berlind won 25 Tony Awards, all for producing.)\n\nStephen Sondheim received eight Tony Awards, more than any other composer. He won seven times: Best Music and Best Lyrics for Company (1971); and Best Score for Follies (1972), A Little Night Music (1973), Sweeney Todd (1979), Into the Woods (1988) and Passion (1994). His eighth honor was a 2008 Special Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Theatre.\n\nAngela Lansbury has hosted or co-hosted more Tony telecasts than any other individual, with five telecasts (1968, 1971, 1987, 1988, and 1989). In second place, with four telecasts each, are Neil Patrick Harris (2009, 2011, 2012, and 2013) and Hugh Jackman (2003, 2004, 2005, and 2014).\n\nJason Robards Jr. received more Tony Award nominations than any other male actor. His eight nominations were for Long Day's Journey Into Night (1957), The Disenchanted (1959), Toys in the Attic (1960), After the Fall (1964), Hughie (1965), The Country Girl (1972), A Moon for the Misbegotten (1974), and A Touch of the Poet (1978). Out of all of those nominations, he only won one Tony Award, for The Disenchanted.\n\nBoyd Gaines and Raúl Esparza are the only men to have been nominated in all four performance categories in which an actor may be eligible: Best Actor in a Play, Best Actor in a Musical, Best Featured Actor in a Play, and Best Featured Actor in a Musical. Three women have been nominated in all four corresponding performance categories: Angela Lansbury, Jan Maxwell, and Audra McDonald.\n\nThe productions that fared most poorly on Tony night were The Scottsboro Boys in 2011 and Mean Girls in 2018. The musicals each received 12 nominations but won no awards. Same with Slave Play by Jeremy O. Harris in 2020—12 nominations including Best Play, but no awards.\n\nMichael Blakemore is the only director to win Tony Awards as Best Director of a Play and Best Director of a Musical in the same year. He won for Copenhagen (play) and Kiss Me, Kate (musical) in 2000.\n\nBob Fosse was the only director to win a Tony, an Oscar, and an Emmy in the same year (1973). He won two Tonys (direction and choreography) for Pippin, an Oscar for Cabaret and an Emmy for “Liza with a Z.”\n\nMike Nichols won more Tony Awards for Best Direction of a Play than any other individual. His six nods were for Barefoot in the Park (1964), Luv and The Odd Couple (1965), Plaza Suite (1968), The Prisoner of Second Avenue (1972), The Real Thing (1984), and Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman (2012). He also won in other categories for directing the musical Monty Python's Spamalot (2005), and for producing Annie (1977) and The Real Thing (1984). That makes a total of nine Tonys.\n\nAmanda Plummer is the only Tony Award winner whose parents have both won Tonys. She won as Best Featured Actress in a Play for Agnes of God (1982). Her father, Christopher Plummer, won as Best Actor in a Musical for Cyrano (1974) and Best Actor in a Play for Barrymore (1997). Her mother, Tammy Grimes, won as Featured Actress in a Musical for The Unsinkable Molly Brown (1961) and Best Actress in a Play for Private Lives (1970).\n\nFive actresses have won a Tony and an Oscar in the same year. Shirley Booth won a Tony for The Time of the Cuckoo and an Oscar for Come Back, Little Sheba (1953). Audrey Hepburn won a Tony for Ondine and an Oscar for Roman Holiday (1954). Ellen Burstyn won a Tony for Same Time, Next Year and an Oscar for Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore (1975). Mercedes Ruehl won a Tony for Lost in Yonkers and an Oscar for The Fisher King (1991). Judi Dench won a Tony for Amy's View and an Oscar for Shakespeare in Love (1999).\n\nAudra McDonald has won six Tony Awards for performance, more than any other individual. She is the only person to have won Tony Awards in four different acting categories. Julie Harris and Angela Lansbury also earned six Tony Awards. Both won five competitive awards for performance, and both received a Special Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Theatre.\n\nBoyd Gaines and Frank Langella are the male performers with the most Tony Awards in acting categories. Both have won four to date. Gaines won for performances in The Heidi Chronicles (1989); She Loves Me (1994); Contact (2000) and Gypsy (2008). Langella was honored for Seascape (1975); Fortune’s Fool (2002); Frost/Nixon (2007) and The Father (2016).\n\nAngela Lansbury and Gwen Verdon have each won four Tony Awards in the musical categories, more than any other actress. Ms. Lansbury won for Mame (1966), Dear World (1969), Gypsy (1975), and Sweeney Todd (1979). She earned a fifth Tony for her work in the Noël Coward play Blithe Spirit in 2009. Ms. Verdon won for Can-Can (1954), Damn Yankees (1956), New Girl in Town (1958) and Redhead (1959).\n\nNine performers have won a Tony and later an Oscar for the same role (plus a tenth who did it the other way around):\n\nJosé Ferrer in Cyrano de Bergerac (Tony: 1947/Oscar: 1950)\n\nShirley Booth in Come Back, Little Sheba (1950/1953)\n\nYul Brynner in The King and I (1952/1956)\n\nRex Harrison in My Fair Lady (1957/1964)\n\nAnne Bancroft in The Miracle Worker (1960/1962)\n\nPaul Scofield in A Man for All Seasons (1962/1966)\n\nJack Albertson in The Subject Was Roses (1965/1968)\n\nJoel Grey in Cabaret (1967/1973)\n\nViola Davis in Fences (2010/2017)\n\nLila Kedrova did it backwards. She won an Oscar for Zorba the Greek, and 20 years later earned a Tony for the same role in Zorba (Oscar: 1964/Tony: 1984).\n\nAt the 1950 Tony Awards, the original production of South Pacific became the first — and so far only — show to win Tony Awards in all four musical acting categories. The four honored performers were Ezio Pinza (Lead Actor in a Musical), Mary Martin (Lead Actress in a Musical), Myron McCormick (Featured Actor in a Musical), and Juanita Hall (Featured Actress in a Musical). No play has yet to achieve a similar acting award sweep.\n\nThe Tony Award-winning play with the longest title was The Persecution and Assassination of Jean-Paul Marat as Performed by the Inmates of the Asylum of Charenton Under the Direction of the Marquis de Sade by Peter Weiss (1966). That’s 151 letters, 26 words, 44 syllables — and four Tonys. It was known as Marat/Sade for short.\n\nIn 2015, Fun Home became the first show written entirely by women to win the Tony Award as Best Musical. Its authors are Lisa Kron (Best Book, Best Score - lyrics) and Jeanine Tesori (Best Score - music); the show’s source material is a graphic memoir by Alison Bechdel.\n\nBen Vereen and Patina Miller are the only pair of individuals who identify with different genders to win a Tony Award for portraying the same character. They were honored for their performances as “Leading Player” in Pippin, he in 1973 for the original Broadway production (Best Actor in a Musical); she for the 2013 revival (Best Actress in a Musical).\n\nAdam Guettel is the only Tony winner who is both the grandson of another winner and the son of a Tony nominee. Guettel earned two Tonys in 2005: Best Score and Best Orchestrations for The Light in the Piazza. His grandfather, Richard Rodgers, won six Tonys as a composer and producer of such shows as South Pacific, The King and I, No Strings, and The Sound of Music. He also received three Special Tony Awards. Guettel’s mother, Mary Rodgers (Richard’s daughter) was a 1960 Tony nominee as the composer of Once Upon a Mattress.\n\nOnly one cast replacement has ever been nominated for a Tony Award in a competitive category. Larry Kert was nominated for Best Actor in a Musical for his performance in Company (1971). Dean Jones originated the role (and can be heard on the cast album), but left the production soon after the opening.\n\nSeveral performers won a Tony Award while they were hosting or co-hosting a nationally-televised Tony Awards ceremony:\n\nRobert Preston – Best Actor in a Musical for I Do! I Do! (1967)\n\nGlenn Close – Best Actress in a Play for Death and the Maiden (1992) and Best Actress in a Musical for Sunset Boulevard (1995)\n\nNathan Lane – Best Actor in a Musical for A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum (1996) and again for The Producers (2001)\n\nHugh Jackman – Best Actor in a Musical for The Boy from Oz (2004)\n\nIn addition, Richard Burton (1967) and Mary Tyler Moore (1980) received Special Awards when they co-hosted the Tony Awards telecast.\n\nThe Richard Rodgers Theatre (formerly the 46th Street Theatre) has housed the most Tony Award-winning Best Plays and Best Musicals: 11, including Guys and Dolls (1951), Damn Yankees (1956), Redhead (1959), How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (1962), 1776 (1969), Raisin (1974), Nine (1982), Fences (1987), Lost in Yonkers (1991), In The Heights (2008), and Hamilton (2016).\n\nWhen she won a Tony Award for Best Costume Design of a Play in 2017, Jane Greenwood ended a record-breaking streak of nominations without a win. The designer received her first nomination in 1965, and her 21st nomination (and first win) 52 years later. Along the way she also received a Special Tony Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Theatre, in 2014.\n\nOliver Smith is the scenic designer with the most Tony Awards. He collected eight Tonys, all within a nine-year period: My Fair Lady (1957), West Side Story (1958), The Sound of Music (1960), Becket (1961), Camelot (1961), Hello, Dolly! (1964) and Baker Street (1965), as well as a special Tony Award (1965).\n\nCatherine Zuber is the individual with the most Tony Awards for costume design, with eight. Her Tony wins include The Light in the Piazza (2005), Awake and Sing! (2006), The Coast of Utopia (2007), South Pacific (2008), The Royal Family (2010), The King and I (2015), My Fair Lady (2018), and Moulin Rouge! The Musical (2020).\n\nJules Fisher has won nine Tony Awards, more than any other lighting designer. He won for Pippin (1973), Ulysses in Nighttown (1974), Dancin’ (1978), Grand Hotel: the Musical (1990), The Will Rogers Follies (1991), Jelly’s Last Jam (1992), and, with Peggy Eisenhauer, Bring in ’da Noise, Bring in ’da Funk (1996), Assassins (2004), and Lucky Guy (2013). He has received more than 20 nominations as a lighting designer and one as a producer, of Dancin’.\n\nThe only one-person play to win the Best Play Tony Award was I Am My Own Wife by Douglas Wright (2004). Its star, Jefferson Mays, also won a Tony that year, as Best Actor in a Play.\n\nBarbara Cook received her first Tony Award and nomination in 1958, for creating the role of Marian (the Librarian) Paroo in The Music Man. She was next nominated in 2010 for her performance in Sondheim on Sondheim. That’s a 52-year gap, the longest any individual has had to wait between nominations (though in the interim, she starred in the 2002 revue Barbara Cook in Mostly Sondheim, which earned a nomination as Best Special Theatrical Event for the show’s producers). Cook beat out Jane Fonda, who received her first nomination in 1960 and her second 49 years later, in 2009.\n\nThe only play to have won a Best Revival Tony in three different productions is Death of a Salesman, in 1984, 1999, and 2012. In addition, the original production of Arthur Miller’s drama won the Best Play award in 1949.\n\nThe first Tony ceremony began with supper at 9:00 p.m. at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. Entertainment and dancing continued until midnight, at which time the awards were announced live over the radio.\n\nDuring the first two years of the Tonys (1947 and 1948), there was no official Tony Award. The winners were presented with a scroll and, in addition, a money clip, a cigarette lighter (for the men) or a compact (for the women).\n\nThe Tony Award itself is a disk-shaped silver medallion with the masks of comedy and tragedy on one side and the name of the winner, the category, and year on the other. Since 1967 the medallion has been mounted on a curved armature atop a black pedestal."
