That was one of the all time WTF AT40s!\n\nPost by dukelightning on\n\nFor me, it goes back to when I first discovered Billboard in my high school library. No Whitburn books, no internet of course, no AT40 for me at the time the song was on the charts. So when I found out \"Call on Me\" by Chicago did not hit #1, I could not believe it. Personal opinion of course but I thought it 'sounded' like a #1 song.\n\nPost by chrislc on\n\nFor me, it goes back to when I first discovered Billboard in my high school library. No Whitburn books, no internet of course, no AT40 for me at the time the song was on the charts. So when I found out \"Call on Me\" by Chicago did not hit #1, I could not believe it. Personal opinion of course but I thought it 'sounded' like a #1 song.\n\nI was just thinking of them tonight, seeing them in the Top 10 this week in 1970. Other than the Eagles (and maybe even more so) I can't think of a mainstream 70s act whose hits have held up so well. Very catchy and high quality hits.\n\nPost by woolebull on\n\nFor me, I never have understood how \"Don't Wanna Fall In Love\" by Jane Child did not make it to one in 1990. It was a very hot song, stalled at 6 for two weeks, then leaped to 2. However, I think it should have gone to 1 for at least a week. The song that stopped it, \"I'll Be Your Everything\" by Tommy Page, seemed that it had peaked. Even Page himself thought Child was going to jump him after a record executive from his company called him and told him it looked like Child would jump him the day before the chart came out. Yet, he somehow pulled it off.\n\nChild had no shot the next week as Sinead O' Connor jumped from nine to four the same week that Child jumped to 2 and would leap to one over \"Love\" the next week.\n\nFor the record, \"Don't Wanna Fall In Love\", spent two weeks at one on R and R.\n\nPost by dmvden on\n\nSome surprises for me:\n\nWorking My Way Back to You / Forgive Me Girl - The Spinners\n\nWoman - John Lennon\n\nGloria - Laura Branigan\n\nThe Wild Boys - Duran Duran\n\nThen there are some songs where I wondered \"How did they make it all the way to #2???\":\n\nLonger - Dan Fogelberg\n\nAll I Need - Jack Wagner (\"huh hah hah haaaaaaa-aa-aa-aa ahhhhhh\")\n\nPost by MrGeno502 on\n\nI would have to say that Imagine by John Lennon should have hit #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 instead of #3. It hit #2 on Cash Box but at least it hit # 1 on the Record World charts.\n\nPost by pgfromwp on\n\nFrom the late spring of 1973, I was surprised that \"Playground in My Mind\" stalled at #2, since it was the catchy type of pop tune that typically would have hit #1 -- I believe \"My Love\" was #1 at the time on Billboard's hot 100 chart.\n\nPost by mga707 on\n\nAgree with the two Lennon songs and the McCartney song already mentioned.\n\nAlso from the 70s, all #2 songs:\n\n\"Burning Love\"--Elvis\n\n\"When Will I See You Again\"--Three Degrees\n\n\"Boogie Nights\"--Heatwave, if only for one week amidst the 10 weeks of Debby\n\n80s #2s:\n\n\"Waiting For a Girl Like You\"--Foreigner (ditto the above, subbing Olivia for Debby)\n\n\"Dancing In the Dark\"--Bruce Springsteen\n\nearly 90s #2s:\n\n\"All I Wanna Do Is Make Love To You'--Heart\n\nAfter SoundScan, didn't really care about the hot 100 any more...\n\nPost by pointpark04 on\n\nSome easy ones off of the top of my head:\n\n1) Any of the five songs that Credence Clearwater Revival took to number two.\n\n2) \"Lyin' Eyes\" by the Eagles.\n\n3) \"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\" by Elton.\n\n4) \"Material Girl\" by Madonna.\n\n5) \"Something Happened on the Way to Heaven\" by Phil Collins.\n\n6) \"Rubberband Man\" by the Spinners.\n\n7) \"Baby, What a Big Surprise\" and \"Old Days\" by Chicago.\n\nPost by rayshae3 on\n\nObvious signature songs-\n\nBob Dylan-Like a Rolling Stone (#2 for 2 weeks)\n\nMarvin Gaye-What’s Going on (#2 for 3 weeks)\n\nCarpenters: Yesterday Once More (#2; but #1 Cashbox) among others.\n\nclassic Chuck Berry too many like: “Maybelle”, and “Johnny B. Goode” missed #1 on all pop charts. His only #1 ended up to be “My Ding-a-Ling”!!\n\nManilow “Copacabana” only got to #8.\n\nMadness-Our House (#7)\n\nQueen: Okay “Bohemian Rhapsody’ might have been a little adventurous for the average record buyer or radio in the mid-70s to be a top song, but I’m surprised “We Are the Champions” only peaked at #4.\n\nBohemian’s Rhapsody’s revival was bigger in 92 (peaking at #2 on the Hot 100) thanks to Wayne’s World, but still not a number one.\n\nElton John: almost any of his non-#1 top 10 hits of the 70s like “Your Song”(#8)\n\nPost by OldSchoolAT40Fan on\n\nBecause of being known for having the highest-debuting song on the Hot 100 in the 1980s (#20 in February 1984), and jumping into the top 10 the following week, I was expecting Michael Jackson's \"Thriller\" to be #1. But it turned out that MJ was a far cry behind Van Halen when \"Thriller\" peaked at #4 in March 1984."
