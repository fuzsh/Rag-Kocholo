        "text": "The algorithmic world has, some might argue, dampened the element of surprise. But these 10 albums that came out in the thick of the streaming age are all full of pleasant shocks‚Äîsometimes ones that seem to be even felt by the artists themselves.\n\nHere are the 10 best albums of the year, so far.\n\nTierra Whack, WORLD WIDE WHACK\n\nSince releasing her written-in-sketches 2018 debut mixtape Whack World, the Philadelphia MC and singer Tierra Whack has become beloved for her wild creativity, which she distills into brief, yet far-flung trips into different dimensions. On her first proper album, Whack whirls around her own set of frequencies, following the underworld marching-band stomp of ‚ÄúX‚Äù with the couples-skate-ready yet lovelorn ‚ÄúMOOVIES‚Äù and reflecting on depression‚Äôs ripple effects on the glassy ‚Äú27 CLUB.‚Äù\n\nShellac, To All Trains\n\nFamed engineer and critic (and poker champ) Steve Albini passed away unexpectedly in May, and his band‚Äôs sixth album, recorded at his Chicago homebase Electrical Audio with bandmates Bob Weston and Todd Trainer, only added to the weight of the loss. Shellac‚Äôs lye-dipped noise rock sounds absolutely alive, with To All Trains‚Äô 10 tracks allowing each member to flex their musical muscles in a way that winks at virtuosic excess while also being utterly self-assured‚Äîperhaps unsurprising for an album that ends with a grimy cut called ‚ÄúI Don‚Äôt Feel Hell.‚Äù\n\nEnglish Teacher, This Could Be Texas\n\nThe Leeds foursome English Teacher‚Äôs debut full-length balances the pensive with the punky on songs that vibrate with curiosity, even when their lyrics feel world-weary. The galloping ‚ÄúNearly Daffodils‚Äù and the gleaming ‚ÄúNot Everybody Goes To Space‚Äù contend with life getting in the way of dreams. Closer ‚ÄúAlbert Road‚Äù is a slow-to-combust ballad about a town where ‚Äúthe world around us never showed/ how loving can be fun,‚Äù an ideal that‚Äôs espoused by English Teacher channeling its frustrations into music that often sounds like it‚Äôs surprising itself.\n\nWILLOW, empathogen\n\nWillow Smith‚Äôs pop career is in its early teens, and over that time she‚Äôs amassed a singular catalog with forays into bedroom-R&B, pop-punk, and other hyphenated genres that show off her robust yet sprightly voice and penchant for writing sneaky hooks. On her sixth album, she‚Äôs bringing even more elements into the mix‚Äî‚Äúno words 1 & 2‚Äù veers between feather-light scatting and heavy shredding before showing off Smith‚Äôs talent for stacking harmonies, while ‚Äúi know that face.‚Äù is the sort of sprint that makes you marvel at just how fast her mind works.\n\nJane Weaver, Love in Constant Spectacle\n\nFor more than 20 years, the English songwriter, producer, and composer Jane Weaver has made music to accompany her inquisitive journeys through the world. On her 12th album, she breaks down the building blocks of reality before reconstituting them in ways that incorporate resolute basslines, fluttering synthesizers, and home-movie haze. Take the dreamy ‚ÄúRomantic Worlds,‚Äù a potent meditation on modern love topped by a singsong melody and framed in fizzy guitars.\n\nSprints, Letter to Self\n\nIrish punkers Sprints make ferocious, cathartic anthems designed to lift up those who might feel ground down by the world‚Äôs churn. Vocalist-guitarist Karla Chubb has a mighty instrument that feels as menacing when she‚Äôs in steely-eyed mode as it does when she‚Äôs in full wail (she‚Äôs cited PJ Harvey as an influence), and she takes no prisoners; the careening ‚ÄúAdore Adore Adore‚Äù takes on the careless ways female musicians are discussed and discarded, while ‚ÄúA Wreck, A Mess‚Äù is a stop-start travelogue through those claustrophobic moments when one wonders, ‚ÄúIs everyone a wreck? Is everyone stressed?‚Äù\n\nBillie Eilish, HIT ME HARD AND SOFT\n\nHalfway to EGOT status before she turned 20, Billie Eilish shows no signs of resting on her laurels with her third album. Defiantly brief‚Äîit‚Äôs a slim 10 tracks, confounding streaming-era sales mandates‚Äîand placing her whisper-soft voice at its core, HIT ME HARD AND SOFT marinates in a very self-aware darkness: ‚ÄúThe internet is hungry for the meanest kind of funny/ and somebody‚Äôs gotta feed it,‚Äù she muses on the bleakly lacerating opening track ‚ÄúSKINNY.‚Äù But Eilish‚Äôs music has a lightness about it that makes it undeniably pop, particularly on tracks like the glitchy ‚ÄúLUNCH‚Äù and the stages-of-heartbreak diptych ‚ÄúL‚ÄôAMOUR DE MA VIE.‚Äù\n\nKali Uchis, Orquid√©as\n\nKali Uchis‚Äô follow-up to last year‚Äôs winning Red Moon In Venus is another statement of self, with the Colombian-American singer asserting her excellence while exploring musical ideas from the Spanish-language diaspora alongside fellow travelers like the regional Mexican breakout star Peso Pluma (her foil on the starlit ‚ÄúIguial Que Un Angel‚Äù) and the reggaeton hitmaker Karol G (who joins her for the coquettish ‚ÄúLabios Mordidos‚Äù). Even in its most beat-heavy moments, Uchis‚Äô music retains a dreaminess that makes each one of her songs feel like another piece of her ever-growing puzzle.\n\nMdou Moctar, Funeral for Justice\n\nThe latest album from desert blues outfit Mdou Moctar is heavy in sound and subject, with its eponymous guitarist‚Äôs virtuosic playing and his bandmates‚Äô chugging rhythms grounding lyrics that denounce the history of colonialism in his homeland Niger and throughout Africa. With a playing style that marries the nimble fingerwork of Eddie Van Halen and Jimi Hendrix to traditions borrowed from traditional Tuareg music, Moctar‚Äôs spellbinding riffs and unyielding sense of purpose turbo-charge tracks like the propulsive \"Tchinta\" and the psychedelic ‚ÄúSousoume Tamacheq.‚Äù\n\nBeyonc√©, COWBOY CARTER"
