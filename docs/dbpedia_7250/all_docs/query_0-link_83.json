        "text": "The five acts joining Taylor Swift for the second round of The Eras Tour in London have been named. The star revealed five more acts who will grace the Wembley Stadium stage during the five-night run of London dates this month.\n\nThey are RAYE, Holly Humberstone, Maisie Peters, Sofia Isella and Suki Waterhouse. Paramore will perform as chief support act for all five dates from Thursday, August 15, to Tuesday, August 20.\n\nBelow is what we know about the five dates in August, plus each support act's top song on Spotify if you are yet to check them out.\n\nREAD MORE: More tickets released for Taylor Swift Eras Tour at Wembley today\n\nSofia Isella - Thursday, August 15\n\nSofia Isella is the first of Taylor's support acts and she will open for the US popstar at Wembley Stadium ahead of Paramore on Thursday, August 15. A classically trained violinist, songwriter, producer and poet, London-born Sofia was inspired by her love of Trent Reznor, Beck, Sylvia Plath, Margaret Atwood, Mona Awad and Anne Sexton among other influences to forge a unique brand of alternative, confessional pop music.\n\nAged just 19 years old, Isella has enjoyed a steady rise to stardom, her biggest song 'Hot Gum' has accrued over 10.2 million plays on Spotify. She opened for Tom Odell on his UK tour last year, as well as dates supporting Melanie Martinez in the United States and Mexico.\n\nHolly Humberstone - Friday, August 16\n\nHolly Humberstone is the second of Taylor's support acts who will take to the stage at Wembley on Friday, August 16. A singer-songwriter with a penchant for an electric guitar, and an aesthetic noticeably similar to Taylor. Holly won the Brit Sward for Rising Star in 2022, and an Ivor Novello Award for Best Song for her single 'Haunted House'.\n\nHailing from Grantham, Lincolnshire, where as a teenager she wrote many a song in her bedroom, Holly's debut single 'Deep End' catapulted her into the mainstream hit and was the name behind her first UK and Ireland tour in 2021. Holly has opened for Olivia Rodrigo and Girl in Red on their tours; and was recently profiled in UK Vogue magazine.\n\nSuki Waterhouse - Saturday, August 17\n\nBritish singer-songwriter Suki Waterhouse is the third opening act for Taylor Swift, appearing at Wembley on Saturday, August 17. A cursory glance at any celeb magazine will reveal the actress and former model is the fianc√©e of actor Robert Pattinson; the pair have been photographed with Taylor in New York attending several events.\n\nBut beyond the pap shots, Suki is an indie pop performer in her own right, who released her second full-length album 'Memoir of a Sparklemuffin' last September.\n\nSuki's biggest single 'Good Looking' has amassed an impressive 422 million hits on Spotify, putting her close to some of Taylor's best-known numbers. After her stint at Wembley, Suki will be performing at the All Points East festival in Victoria Park the next day on Sunday, August 18.\n\nMaisie Peters - Monday, August 19\n\nSussex-born singer-songwriter Maisie Peters, 24, is the fourth opening act for The Eras Tour at Wembley, scheduled to appear on Monday, August 19. Maisie's brand of power pop has strong echoes of Taylor, with her hits 'Worst of You' and 'Psycho' racking of millions of views on Spotify and YouTube.\n\nMaisie was one of the big success stories of Ed Sheeran's label Gingerbread Man Records when her debut album You Signed Up For This appeared in 2021. Last year, she became the youngest solo British female artist to top the UK album charts in almost ten years with her second full-length record, The Good Witch\n\nRAYE - Tuesday, August 20\n\nUK chart-topper RAYE is the final support act to open for Taylor Swift at Wembley on Tuesday, August 20. For years, RAYE was a successful singer-songwriter for other artists such as Beyonce, Rihanna, David Guetta, Little Mix and Ellie Goulding. She first gained fame when she appeared on the 2016 singles 'By Your Side' by Jonas Blue and 'You Don't Know Me' by Jax Jones.\n\nBut it was their debut solo album, last year's My 21st Century Blues, that catapulted RAYE to stardom, earning the Brit Award for Best Album of the Year, while she also picked up Best Song for Escapism, Best New Artist and British Artist of the Yea gongs.\n\nTaylor Swift's Eras Tour - which broke all records as the first concert tour to surpass $1 billion in ticket sales - began on March 17 last year in Glendale, Arizona, and first came to London's Wembley Stadium on June 21, 22 and 23.\n\nIt returns to London this month on August 15, 16, 17, 19 and 20.\n\nTaylor will be performing on 152 dates in total for The Eras Tour, ending on December 8, 2024, and it has met with universal acclaim and comparisons to 1960s Beatlemania. Politicians in Canada and Chile have lobbied for the sell-out tour to stop by in their countries, with campaigns launched for more tour dates in South Eastern Asia.\n\nTaylor's personal wealth, which was estimated at $740 million before the tour, rose to ¬£1.1 billion after the first 57 shows of the Eras Tour as overwhelming interest from fans saw sales of her back-catalogue soar."
