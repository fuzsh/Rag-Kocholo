Reich's work is marked by its use of repetitive figures, slow harmonic rhythm, and canons. Reich describes this concept in his essay, \"Music as a Gradual Process\", by stating, \"I am interested in perceptible processes. I want to be able to hear the process happening throughout the sounding music.\" For example, his early works experiment with phase shifting, in which one or more repeated phrases plays slower or faster than the others, causing it to go \"out of phase.\" This creates new musical patterns in a perceptible flow.\n\nWynton Marsalis\n\nBorn in\n\nUnited States\n\nYears\n\n1961-..
