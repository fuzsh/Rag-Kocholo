Jane Child (born 15 February 1967, Toronto) is a Canadian dance-pop singer, producer and musician. She is perhaps best known for her 1990 hit song “Don’t Wanna Fall in Love”, which peaked at #1 on “Radio & Records”, and #2 on Billboard’s Hot 100 chart for three weeks in the spring of that year. A remix of the single earned her a 1991 Juno Award for Dance Recording of the Year. She was known for her eclectic fashion style, which included spiked hair with long braids and wearing a nose chain.
