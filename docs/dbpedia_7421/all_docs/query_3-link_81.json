People think it's a cool parlor trick that I can rattle off the names of all the solar system's major round satellites (that would be the Moon, Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, Iapetus, Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, Oberon, maybe Proteus, and Triton), But Hope has me beat by a mile here.\n\nHope Johnson is half of a pair of Brooklyn teens who go by \"WeSingHappySongs.\" You do, girls, you do! Nice work!\n\nHere are the lyrics, copied from the WeSingHappySongs YouTube page:\n\nBecome A Member\n\nWhen you become a member, you join our mission to increase discoveries in our solar system and beyond, elevate the search for life outside our planet, and decrease the risk of Earth being hit by an asteroid.\n\nYour role in space exploration starts now."
