        "text": "This timeline of discovery of Solar System planets and their natural satellites charts the progress of the discovery of new bodies over history.\n\nHistorically the naming of natural satellites did not always match the times of their discovery.\n\nIn the following tables, planetary satellites are indicated in bold type (e.g. Moon) while planets, major or minor, which directly circle the Sun are in italic type (e.g. Earth). The tables are sorted by publication/announcement date. Dates are annotated with the following symbols:\n\ni: for date of first imaging (photography, etc.);\n\no: for date of first human visual observation, either through telescope or on photographic plate (the true \"discovery\" moment);\n\np: for date of announcement or publication.\n\n*Note: Marked moons had complicated discoveries. Several moons took several years to be confirmed, and in several cases were actually lost and rediscovered. Others were found in Voyager photographs years after they were taken.\n\nColour legend\n\nThe planets and their natural satellites are marked in the following colors:\n\nPlanets\n\nEarth and satellite\n\nMars and satellites\n\nJupiter and satellites\n\nSaturn and satellites\n\nUranus and satellites\n\nNeptune and satellites\n\nDwarf planets\n\nPluto and satellites\n\nEris and satellite\n\nPrehistory\n\nPrehistory Name Image Planet/Number Designation References/Notes Sun Star In the Ptolemaic system, the Earth was believed to be at the centre of the cosmos. Seven planets were placed in orbit around it in an order of increasing distance from the Earth, first established by the Greek Stoics: the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. This list included two objects, the Sun and the Moon, which are no longer considered to be planets; it also excluded the Earth. Mercury 1st Planet In Nicolaus Copernicus' heliocentric system ( De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium, 1543) the Earth came to be considered a planet revolving with the other planets around the Sun, in the following order of distance from the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. The Sun, now situated near the centre of revolution, was no longer considered a planet. Venus 2nd Planet Earth 3rd Planet Mars 4th Planet Jupiter 5th Planet Saturn 6th Planet Moon Earth I In the Copernican system, the Moon was considered to be no longer a planet but a natural satellite of the Earth, and was the only body in that system whose revolution was not centered on the Sun.\n\n17th century\n\n17th century Date Name Image Planet/Number Designation References/Notes 1610s o: January 7 1610\n\np: March 13 1610 Callisto Jupiter IV Galileo.
