        "text": "Halloween is nearly here, and it’s time to evaluate this year’s harvest. And possibly think about gratitude for what the past season has brought me. Or not. Spoiler alert–it wasn’t my greatest ever harvest.\n\nWhenever I read about someone who claims to have fed his or her whole family from a four by eight garden bed, I laugh. You have to wonder what they were eating during that time. Cherry tomatoes and turnips? Zucchini? I may not have a particularly green thumb (on occasion I’ve claimed I have a plaid thumb because my results are so wildly erratic), but I know that even with a green house and great care, you’re not going to get a whole summer’s worth, much less a whole year of food out of one four by eight bed for even a family of three.\n\nA hunter-gatherer, depending on the climate and vegetative coverage, needs from seven to five hundred square miles to subsist. Obviously, gardening is intended to concentrate that food so you don’t have to range over miles to get your fruit and vegetables, but four by eight feet? I doubt it. Except, perhaps if you are a zucchinitarian subsisting solely on that vegetable. It is a well know fact that zucchini exist in only two states: none or too many.\n\nMy folks had a huge garden and fought off deer and other critters. They managed to grow a lot of food, but what and how much varied a lot from year to year. My garden consists of three four-by-eight beds and LOTS of pots. Even when I am able to fight off the squirrels, chipmunks, rabbits, opossums, raccoons, birds, and assorted bugs, my yields can vary from so many cucumbers that I chase down people on the street and force vegetables on them, to nothing at all. One year I had so much chard that I was freezing bags of it, and the next it didn’t come up at all. This year, I only got it to grow in a planter, and it was puny at best. Also this year, I planted eggplants twice and eventually got three plants that didn’t even start blooming until late September. So far, they have produced nothing but one eggplant that is the size of a pea. After the rabbits ate the baby sunflower plants to the ground, I replanted (with sturdy fencing) and got some nice sunflowers that the birds thought were a really nice treat, thank you very much. I have enough Hungarian wax peppers that there will be a lot of goulash in my future, but the pablanos were a complete bust. So, you may ask yourself (I certainly ask myself), why bother? The supermarket is so much easier and even, one might argue, cheaper (cue the jokes about the $50 tomato).\n\nThe answers to why bother for me are as follows. 1) After three attempts, I finally got two tomato plants to survive into productivity, one of which made a few perfect, aromatic, delicious tomatoes every week or so. Those tomatoes, carefully fenced against all manner of beasts, made a salad or sandwich taste like paradise. 2) Remember Schrödinger’s potatoes–the tops of the plants were lush and green with lots of blossoms? Were there potato tubers underneath those plants or not? Until I dug up the plants, I couldn’t know. As luck would have it, I had a nice little crop of potatoes–not enough to feed a family of three or four, but enough for a few meals. That potato patch took up just about half of one four by eight bed. 3) Two pepper plants, one a Serrano and one a Hungarian wax, have made enough peppers that I’ve used them as needed, and I’m keeping the rest in the freezer for later use. 4) I harvested enough green beans, a small handful at a time, to freeze a few and to eat as a side dish from time to time. 5) The radishes never made any radishes, but the seed pods were delicious pickled. 6) The one and only little bitty cantaloupe that made it to ripeness (produced on a prodigious vine) was aromatic and richly sweet. 7) One of the four blueberry bushes made a few berries every day, and they were lovely. And the gooseberry bushes were wonderfully generous. 8) My third planting of sage produced nice perennial plants that will last me for years, the basil plants survived after the second planting, the volunteer dill was a treat, the oregano, mint, and thyme still look great, and the bay tree came back from the brink of death. There is nothing like walking out the door and gathering herbs to bring into your kitchen. And finally 9) the cucumber plants made more than I could eat, more than I could pickle, and more than I could give away. Seems like there is always one overachiever.\n\nI’m probably not going to save any money by growing my own food, nor am I going to feed myself and others (except maybe critters) by the sweat of my brow. But being in the garden is its own reward, and its own lesson in survival, life and death, gratitude, and why everyone needs a breeding pair of pine martens–they eat squirrels.\n\nImage: Cucumber that died of exhaustion. By Marilyn Evans\n\nFor a while now, I’ve been a fan of Michael Brecht, one of the premier rat ticklers in the world. His lab in Berlin studies play and the brain, in part by tickling rats. When rats play with each other, whether it’s hide-and-seek or wrestling with lots of tickling, they make sounds that are the ratty equivalent of giggling. Play isn’t really well understood in humans or other animals though there is good research going on in the field by Brecht and others. What has been learned so far is that play is pretty important to health, happiness, and sanity. When you have friends and family you can play with, that’s a good thing at any stage of life.\n\nOne branch of my family is into board games. Another is all over jigsaw puzzles as a team sport. My immediate family liked card games, among other pursuits. I’m pretty sure I played enough games of Spades with my friends in the student union during undergraduate school to have earned a minor in it. That is at least one good reason to have friends: they are who we play with, and that makes us happy.\n\nWhat else are friends good for? Dan Buettner, explorer and author, found that in the Blue Zones, the places on Earth where unusually large numbers of people live in good health into their 100’s, having friends is a major contributor to their longevity. Friendships with people who have similar interests and goals, and sustaining those friendships often for decades can contribute to a long and happy life.\n\nBut if happiness and longevity aren’t good enough reasons to have friends, how about mutual aid? Lifting a tree off your shed after a wind storm can be pretty daunting, but friends can literally make the load lighter. Who do you call when your car breaks down? AAA, sure, but you might also call a friend. You can hire a service for practically everything these days, but it’s nice to have a friend drop you at the airport and a friendly face greet you when you come home again. Friends help each other out, and you need never fear that you are alone in facing the world.\n\nA friend of mine who just had some pretty major surgery is staying with us for a couple of weeks while he gets through doctor’s appointments and recovery. I can’t imagine not being with a friend or close family member under these circumstances. That’s what friends are for. And friends are for telling you when you really, really need to take a bath, or for warning you not to invest in that dodgy deal, or for begging you to get the heck out of that job before it kills you. Of course, friends can get nosy and can intrude too much, but wouldn’t you rather have an honest opinion from someone who really cares about you than a whole lot of polite indifference while you careen toward the edge of disaster?\n\nSo who are these friends, anyway? My cats like to play with me. Cat tickling can be a rather bloody affair, so instead we enjoy hide-and-go-eek and pounce-a-boo, though, like Calvin Ball, I’m not sure anyone really knows what the rules are. Doesn’t matter. They make us laugh in our own ways. And Mikey sits with me in companionable silence in the evenings and sometimes brings me mice for breakfast (though they really aren’t on my diet, I appreciate the effort). My best friend, of course, is my amazing husband, but there are many others. Some of my friends are holdovers from my working days, some I have worshiped with, some are neighbors. I have friends who live close by and others continents away.\n\nAnd what do we owe our friends? I would say to advise without intrusion, suggest without dictating, watch each others backs, make each other’s bail, help hide the body…. Well, maybe not that last one. But certainly we need to care for and about our friends and to make them laugh, with or without the tickling.\n\nImage: Jan, Chris and me, hanging in the desert. Photographer unknown.\n\nThose who follow me regularly know I love movies. I love them so much that I am fascinated by how they are made. Best thing about getting a DVD is the bonus material on “the making of”. Though I loved everything Dick Francis wrote, I especially loved his novel Wild Horses about the madness that is making a movie.\n\nSince I’ve been reading about how to write screen plays, I’ve seen a whole new dimension to how a movie comes into being. The amazing Blake Snyder in his series of Save the Cat! books on writing screen plays tells what a person needs to know to get the bones of a movie into writing. Sadly, Mr. Snyder died in 2009, but his books and methods are as popular as ever.\n\nAs I’ve said in this blog before, when you have a new way of seeing things, suddenly all the world is new. I’ve begun to think about all the stories that “would make a great screen play!” If only that were true.\n\nI recently watched Cocaine Bear. It was every bit as terrible and wonderful, hilarious and disgusting as you might imagine. And, yes, I have committed Barbenheimer, not all at once like some brave souls, but about a week apart. I can’t make a stand on which one to watch first, but as it happens, I saw Oppenheimer first. It was a great movie, but only part of that had to do with the script. It was visually stunning along with sound, acting, timing, all the bits that come together to make a movie happen well when it all comes together. Barbie had a very clever script and amazing sets. I have to confess, I was slightly disappointed and can’t exactly put my finger on why–perhaps because the pacing in the middle fell apart a bit. Still, the opening sequence alone was priceless.\n\nThe tricky thing about movies is they are such a collaboration. Even with great actors, a bad director can scupper the whole thing. Bad editing, inappropriate or lifeless score and sound, lousy effects all can hurt an otherwise great movie. Mr. Snyder points to the Tomb Raider sequel as an example of a movie that just didn’t work because we couldn’t care about the main character. Everything else can be right, but a “so what?” lead in his opinion doomed the end result. The poor performance at the box office bears him out.\n\nI’ve begun to see patterns in movies and television shows that meet the requirements for the” beats” that must come to keep the story interesting. You might suspect that would be a problem like seeing the strings making the puppets dance across the stage. Instead, it fascinates me. I suspect it’s going to make me a better author of books and stories in general. Mind you, I haven’t gotten very deep into trying to write screen plays yet, but that is coming. And hopefully this awareness will help me succeed.\n\nI just finished Mr. Snyder’s second book, Save the Cat ! Goes to the Movies. In it he breaks down movies into 10 popular genres and describes the beats of 50 landmark movies showing how they achieved their greatness. It makes me want to sit down with my streaming services and soak myself in great film. Alas, I have a garden to tend, a blog to write now and again, and my own adventures in writing a screenplay. Wish me luck.\n\nImage: Cloud, a cat not currently in need of saving. By Jonathan Hutchins\n\nI went to CryptiCon this year with my pal Dennis Young and had a pretty good time. The con had been on hiatus for a year but was back with lots of blood and mayhem, as is the way with horror cons. The guests were, as always, amazingly gracious and patient with all the fans, the vendors were interesting and in some cases horrifically creative, and the attendees sported some genuinely disturbing cosplay. My personal favorites were a dead ringer (see what I did there?) for Regan, the Linda Blair character in The Exorcist, and a couple of ladies dressed as xenomorphs from Alien. It was fortunate that I acquired a novel to read from the fellow with a booth next to ours because I also acquired a case of Covid. Mind you, I’ve had ALL the shots and wash my hands obsessively, but still….\n\nSo, the good thing about being a retiree who takes a few sick days is you get to read guilt free for hours on end. The bad thing is you feel really rotten for days on end. I’m better now, thank you, but this got me to thinking about books, what we read, how much we read, and recommendations from friends. I use the term friends here in the loosest possible way. Chris (you remember Chris, my good friend down in Tucson?) is reading The Kaiju Presevation Society by John Scalzi and finding it tremendously entertaining. I just finished my latest read, so I’ve started it myself. It is, so far, hilarious. The problem is, the author refers to Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson more than once. I haven’t read it in years, so now I’m going to have to go back and read it again. He also refers to the Murderbot stories, which Chris also enjoyed a lot, so, well, you see the problem.\n\nYou can get recommendations from all kinds of places, and there are a lot of books out there in the universe, more than any one person can possibly ever read. Most of the time, we have to be selective with our limited time and usually choose books we know we’ll enjoy. Our time is precious and must be spent wisely lest we rot our brains by: reading novels, watching television, or using social media (depending on which century you live in, 19th, 20th, and 21st, respectively).\n\nNBC News sometimes asks Retired Admiral James Stavridis to comment on security and the world, and he invariably has some interesting looking book prominently displayed in his office. I’ve suckered to his recommendations more than once. After all, the man reads a lot, has written several books and seems to know his onions. The problem is, one of his books, The Sailor’s Bookshelf: Fifty Books to Know the Sea, is a book about books. If you go down that rabbit hole, it may be a while before we see you again.\n\nJane Austen, everybody’s friend, refers to several books in her writing, some of them Gothic novels. In fact, her heroine in Northanger Abbey is so enthralled by Gothic stories that she succumbs to suspicion and fantasy about her hosts and their lives. A rather good article in Book Riot discusses Jane’s reference to “the Horrid Novels” and how she resurrected some of them from probably well-deserved obscurity. Still, more than one person would have been enticed to seek out those books and rot their brain by reading them.\n\nIf you want to read, and want more time to read, please, DON’T contract Covid, but do take some time each day to enjoy books. Paper, electronic, audio–it’s all good. And my personal recommendations, besides everything listed above: while Hanging Chads by Evan Clouse was amusing enough and kept me occupied during my illness, I’m still a bit disappointed that the folks from Death’s Head Press weren’t at Crypticon again this year. I could love me some more Splatter Westerns.\n\nImage: One shelf of many. By Marilyn Evans\n\nPeople who read my blog: So, Marilyn, what have you been up to (instead of writing blog posts)?\n\nMe: Grab a beverage, sit down. This might take a while.\n\nFirst and foremost, sometimes I feel like I’ve got nothing to contribute to the world of literature at large. Other times I have lots of ideas but don’t seem to get them down and in the ether before they slide away. Either way, there can be a long pause. I apologize to my teeming masses of adoring fans.\n\nOf course, there are other things in my life than writing blog posts. There is the eternal struggle with my garden, for example. Cloud, our opera singing cat, has taken it upon himself to keep the bunnies and chipmunks in hand (paw?) which my growing things much appreciate. At least those of the growing things that could be bothered to come out of the ground. I have discovered that our house is too cold in the winter for seeds to germinate. Maybe next year starting in February or March we’ll all snuggle together under the electric blanket. Then in the spring, out of doors it was first too cold, then too wet, then too dry, then too hot. The seeds stayed in bed. Not sure I blame them. But there is always one showoff—the cucumbers are going berserk. I have so many that pickles are inevitable. As for the rest? The tomatoes keep losing focus, the radishes have forgotten that they exist for roots, the cantaloupe and watermelon have all the vines in the world but not much else. I may have potatoes some day, but I’m afraid to look. I’ll just believe and hold out hope until I’m forced to dig them up. Schrodinger’s potatoes.\n\nIn other adventures, when I couldn’t get glasses to make things pretty and clear, cataract surgery it was. Since the worse of the two eyes is always done first, for a week or so you get to walk around switching eyes and saying, “Holy mackerel! I had no idea I have been looking through pond water!” Now I get to see without glasses for the first time since first grade, except when I want to read. Putting on glasses instead of taking them off to read is sort of weird.\n\nAnd finally, what have I been writing instead of blogs? Query letters, synopses, cover letters, the things I hate most in the world. I know Stephen King says he loves all aspects of writing, but honestly, these are harder for me than anything. I’ve now sent off my father’s memoir to a publisher and The Gingerbread House, as well. I should be getting rejection letters in a few months, and then I’ll do it all over again. But now that those odious tasks are out of the way, on to the fun stuff.\n\nFirst, I get to write a blog post moaning about my garden and the agony of trying to get things published. Next I’ll start working on my very first screen play, which I’m pretty pumped about. Mind you, I haven’t a clue what I’m doing, but that has seldom stopped me in the past. Between the scenes, I’ve started working on a nonfiction book. I’ve written way more nonfiction than fiction, so this should be easyish. Maybe. Perhaps. We’ll see. After those, there is probably going to be a Gingerbread House sequel, I need to finish Wickham’s Daughter, there is still The Iliad in Space (working title), and Jocasta of Thebes hasn’t even loaded into the starting gate. If I have a great time with the screen play (I’m doing my friend, Dennis Young’s, Mercenary because the tutorials say you should never do your own adaptation first), I will go on to do a screenplay for Beloved Lives.\n\nSo that’s what I’m doing on my summer vacation. You?\n\nImage: Cloud taking a break from bunny wrangling. By Jonathan Hutchins.\n\nPart II of notes from the panel Jonathan Hutchins, Rachel Ellyn, and I had the great pleasure presenting a panel at Planet Comicon Kansas City. Anyone who didn’t make it, or anyone who did and is curious about our list of works and authors and a few other fun facts, here it is!\n\nAgain, let me say, for the purposes of this panel, the 1800’s included 1800 to 1899. Some of the authors wrote into the 20th century, but we did not include these. Also, we excluded for the most part, fantasy and gothic novels. Science fiction we defined (as did Mary Shelley) stories where the action is based on scientific possibility whereas fantasy usually has some magical element. Also please not, many of these stories have elements of misogyny, racism, nationalism, and other things that were current to the time and should be read with that in mind.\n\n1870 Verne Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas. Another adventure story using advanced technologies including an electric submarine, gas-discharge lamp and a taser. It contains detailed descriptions of undersea life which would have been unknown to the readers of the day.\n\n1870 Annie Denton Cridge “Man’s Rights; Or, How Would You Like It? Comprising Dreams”\n\nMan’s Rights, a work of Utopian science fiction and satire, is the first known feminist utopian novel written by a woman.\n\nIn a series of dreams, the female narrator visits the planet Mars, finding a society where traditional sex roles and stereotypes are reversed. The narrator witnesses the oppression of the men and their struggle for equality. They start working towards their liberation after technological advancements free them from some of their grueling domestic chores. In the last two dreams, the narrator visits a future United States, ruled by a woman president and with an equal balance of men and women in the House and Senate. Legislators have begun to stop fining and imprisoning female prostitutes, and it is now the male clients who get arrested and sent to reformatories. A large number of women have taken up farming, and the nation has a promising economic future. The narrator concludes by asking whether this dream might not, after all, be a prophecy?\n\n1871 George T. Chesney The Battle of Dorking First published as a magazine serial. Future war with the British navy defeated by a wonder weapon. The enemy wins and breaks up the British empire (US gets Canada). Futurism and advanced technologies.\n\n1871Edward Bulwer-Lytton The Coming Race Subterranean super race is discovered by accident by a young traveler while visiting a deep mine. The Vril-ya use the force called Vril for destruction or healing (due to the popularity of the book, any health food or elixir was called Vril, i.e. Bovril). In the end the narrator returns to Earth and warns of the coming of this superior race.\n\nThis is the Bulwer-Lytton that the bad writing contest is named after.\n\n1872 Samual Butler Erewhon; or, Over the Range A satire describing what at first seems a utopia, but on further examination is more like a distopia. “The Book of Machines”, a three chapter section warns that machines might become sentient and dangerous. In Erewhon, machines are not used for fear of this. This is one of the pastoral utopian stories.\n\n1877 Verne Off on a CometAnother space travel adventure.\n\n1880 James De Mille A Strange Manuscript Found in a Copper Cylinder Published and serialized posthuously and anonymously, its writing predated She and King Solomon’s Mines but is often compared to them. A lost world story with satire civilization in opposition to culture of the day. In a copper cylinder is the account of a man who, after being separated from his ship in a little row boat with boat mate, finds himself in a tropical paradise in the Anarctic.\n\n1880 Percy Gregg Across the Zodiac; The Story of a Wrecked Record The first sword and planet fiction. Centering around the creation of a substance called “apergy”, a form of anti-gravitational energy, this details a flight to Mars taken in 1830. The planet is inhabited by small beings who, convinced that life couldn’t exist any where else apart from on their world, refuse to believe that the narrator is actually from Earth, deciding instead he is an unusually tall Martian from a remote corner of their planet. The book contains what is probably the first alien language in any work of fiction to be described with linguistic and grammatical terminology, and likely the first instance in the English language of the word “Astronaut”, the name of the narrator’s spacecraft. In 2010 a crater on Mars was named Greg in recognition of his contribution to the lore of Mars. Not an easy read for writing style, sexism and racism, not much plot, lots of political nonsense.\n\n1883 Albert Robida The 20th Century (This and two other novels were combined into one book, including in 1887 War in the 20th Century, and in 1890 The 20th Century, the Life Electric) These are fun for checking against the predicted and the real. Takes place in 1952. Predictions include the world-wide media saturation, news and entertainment merging, and advertising dominating broadcasts; the English Channel tunnel; merging and homogenizing of cultures; the dominance of multinational corporations. Unlike Verne, he proposed inventions integrated into everyday life (like Mary Webb did), and the social developments that arose from them like the social advancement of women, mass tourism, and pollution. He describes modern warfare with robotic missiles and poison gas, a flat screen television display that delivers news 24-hours a day, plays, educational courses, and teleconferences.\n\n1886 Verne Robur the Conqueror. The Clipper of the Clouds Robur develops a heavier than air ship, the Albatross. Screw driven by electrical energy. A bit like a helicopter, downward rotors and two for push, pull actions.\n\n1886 Robert Lewis Stevenson The Strange Cast of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde Scientist experiments with splitting out his baser self with whom he has struggled all his life. When Hyde appears without the serum, large and more frequent doses are needed to remain Jekyll. Finally, a salt that is essential to the potion runs out and new batches don’t work, apparently because the original had an impurity that allowed the reaction. A “mad scientist” story.\n\n1887 Flammarion Stories Of Infinity: Lumen; History Of A Comet; In Infinity Conversation between a spirit who travels through the universe and a man. One of the earliest works to consider the matters of relativity, alien life, and the advancement of mankind. Flammarion tended touse elaborate explanations of scientific principles and even included mathematical calculations in some of his stories\n\n1887 W. H. Hudson A Crystal Age Pastoral utopian novel (like News from Nowhere), published anonymously originally. Man wakes up more than 100 centuries in the future. (Author also wrote the more famous Green Mansions). The people of his imagined future possess only one piece of technology, a system of “brass globes” that produces a form of ambient music. Otherwise they have no machines and only simple devices. Only the “father” and “Mother” of the commune breed; everyone else lives like siblings.\n\n1888 Edward Bellamy Looking BackwardTime travelnovel with strong socialism and anti-captalism themes. Julian West, a young American, who towards the end of the 19th century, falls into a deep, hypnosis-induced sleep and wakes up 113 years later. He finds himself in the year 2000, and the United States has been transformed into a socialistutopia with nationalization of all industry, and the use of an “industrial army” to organize production and distribution, as well as how to ensure free cultural production under such conditions.\n\n1889 Mark Twain A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court Time travel. Use of future technology (1880’s) in a past time.\n\n1890 Mary E. Bradley Lane Mizora: A Prophecy: A Mss. Found Among the Private Papers of Princess Vera Zarovitch: Being a True and Faithful Account of her Journey to the Interior of the Earth, with a Careful Description of the Country and its Inhabitants, their Customs, Manners, and Government. A hollow Earth and utopian story. First serialized then published as a book, “the first portrait of an all-female, self-sufficient society,” and “the first feminist technological Utopia.” The narrator Vera is sent to Siberia and goes over a waterfall to the center of the Earth where she finds a women only culture that practice eugenics. They are Aryan and abhor dark colored skin. The futuristic technology includes “videophones” and making rain by discharging electricity into the air. Though Mizora has no domestic animals, its women eat chemically-prepared artificial meat.\n\n1890 William Morris News From Nowhere; or, An Epic of Rest Being Some Chapters From a Utopian Romance Pastoral utopian novel with utopian socialism. William Guest falls asleep and finds himself in a future society.\n\n1891 Milton Ramsey Six Thousand Years Hence Includes space travel, hollow Earth and futurism. Proposes machine translators.\n\n1893 George Griffith The Angel or the Revolution: A Tale of the Coming Terror Aerial battleships and surface to air missles are predicted.\n\n1894 Flammarion Omega: The Last Days of the World Another apocalyptic story in a future with international telephone service and the European Union.\n\n1894 John Jacob Astor IV A Journey in Other Worlds Two interesting ideas in this: Earth axis straightening to end seasons, and a voyager to Jupiter and Saturn via a vehicle powered by “apergy” (fictious anti-gravity energy seen in a previous novel) and assisted by gravity (gravity assisted acceleration). Huge dams are used to power shifting the Earth, one at Niagra Falls (actually built 23 years later) and a tidal energy plant in the Bay of Fundy (built in 1980). Also proposes using Earth’s mantle heat for power.\n\nA portion of the story involves looking back to the year 2000. Electricity does all the work including solar energy. (First solar cell 1883, ~1% efficient, in 2000 ~11% and today greater than 32 %). An explosive no power can resist causes people to abandon war; the Great War never happens. US ends up with most of the Western hemisphere (Canada, Central America).\n\nDescription of space craft is surprisingly close in some aspects. Today, beryllium is used and the dimensions of the interior are not off much those of the Apollo modules. But the story also includes packing fishing tackle, guns and canned food cooked on an electric stove in the space craft. The space travelers collect samples by shooting them; they have explosive bullets in guns. They describe strange and unique plants and animals including dinosaur-like creatures, pneumatic powered snakes and flowers that attract pollenators by sound. The travelers eat and drink from Jupiter’s animals and streams. On Saturn, spirits of the dead dwell.\n\n(Astor died on the Titanic and was at the time, the richest man in the world.)\n\n1895 Robert Comie The Crack of Doom A strange group proposes blowing up the world with what might be described as an atomic bomb.\n\n1895 H.G. Wells The Time Machine Time travel, futurism, dystopia. A future where passive race of humans serve as “livestock” for a subterranean race of humans. In one version of the novel, the traveler goes to see the time near the end of the world when all life is gone and the atmosphere barely breathable.\n\n1895 H.G. Wells “Argonauts of the Air”Men successfully fly but die when they can’t control the plane. Omitted from collections of the author’s works after the Wright brothers’ success.\n\n1896 H.G. Wells “The Plattner Story” An alternate universe experienced.\n\n1896 H.G. Wells “Under the Knife” An astral trip through the solar system and universe.\n\n1896 H.G.

Wells “The Crystal Egg” Television-like method of viewing life on Mars.\n\n1897 Wells The Invisible Man Originally serialized then in a book. An evil genius uses alterations in optical properties of tissues through chemical and electrical means. First he makes white cloth then a white cat invisible. Griffin is an albino. Issue of retinas needing to be able to absorb light to see explained away. He is the worst of the evil geniuses in literature.\n\n1897 Kurd Lasswitz Two Planets Describes an encounter between humans and a Martian civilization that is older and more advanced. Martians are running out of water, eating synthetic foods, traveling by rolling roads, and using space stations. The spaceships use anti-gravity, but travel realistic orbital trajectories, and use occasional mid-course corrections in traveling between Mars and the Earth; the book depicted the technically correct transit between the orbits of two planets, something poorly understood by other early science fiction writers. It influenced Walter Hohmann and Wernher von Braun. The book was not translated into English until 1971 (as Two Planets), and the translation is incomplete. Auf zwei Planeten was his most successful novel.\n\n1898 Wells The War of the Worlds First serialised in 1897. The novel’s first appearance in hardcover was in 1898. Alien invasion. Descritions of technology that accomodates a non-bipedal alien. Poison gas and death ray.\n\n1899 Wells When the Sleeper Wakes Originally published as a serial. Reworked and rereleased in 1910 as The Sleeper Awakes. Dystopia future; a man sleeps for two hundred and three years, waking up in a completely transformed London in which he has become the richest man in the world. The main character awakes to see his dreams realised, and the future revealed to him in all its horrors and malformities.\n\nAlso, two stories by Rudyard Kipling, “.007” and “The Ship that Found Herself” suggesting machines that are self aware.\n\nJonathan Hutchins, Rachel Ellyn, and I had the great pleasure presenting a panel at Planet Comicon Kansas City on the science fiction of the 19th Century. Anyone who didn’t make it, or anyone who did and is curious about our list of works and authors and a few other fun facts, here it is! At least as much as I have time, space, and stamina to put down.\n\nFor the purposes of this panel, the 1800’s included 1800 to 1899. Some of the authors wrote into the 20th century, but we did not include these. Also, we excluded for the most part, fantasy and gothic novels. Science fiction we defined (as did Mary Shelley) stories where the action is based on scientific possibility whereas fantasy usually has some magical element. Also please not, many of these stories have elements of misogyny, racism, nationalism, and other things that were current to the time and should be read with that in mind.\n\n1805 Jean-Baptiste Cousin de Grainville publishes The Last Man, a novel about the end of humanity (and the world). Includes balloon flight from Europe to Brasil. The planet has lost fertility from overuse, and only one man and one woman remain fertile. Apocalyptic and futuristic.\n\n1818 Mary Shelley publishes Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, considered proto-science fiction. Published in three volumes, sometimes called a three-decker or triple decker, this was a standard form of publishingfor British fictionduring the nineteenth century.\n\nThe 1831 “popular” edition was heavily revised by Mary Shelley to make the story less radical. The one most widely published and read although a few editions follow the 1818 text. Some scholars prefer the original version, arguing that it preserves the spirit of Mary Shelley’s vision (see Anne K. Mellor’s “Choosing a Text of Frankenstein to Teach” in the W. W. Norton Critical edition).\n\n1826 Mary Shelley publishes The Last Man, an apocalyptic and dystopian novel set in the 21st Century after a global plague, one of the first pieces of dystopian fictionpublished. It was critically savaged and remained largely obscure at the time of its publication. Itfollowed several other last-man themed works including a French narrative (Le Dernier Homme de Grainville’s book[1805)]), Byron’s poem “Darkness” (1816), and Thomas Campbell’s poem “The Last Man” (1824).\n\nReceiving the worst reviews of all of Mary Shelley’s novels, but she later spoke of The Last Man as one of her favorite works.\n\n1827 Jane Webb The Mummy! A Tale of the Twenty-Second Century Published anonymously in 1827 by Henry Colburnin three volumes. It drew many favourable reviews. In 1830, a 46-year-old reviewer, John Claudius Loudon tracked down the 22-year-old author and married her. She filled her world with foreseeable changes in technology, society, and even fashion. England is Catholic and ruled by Queen Claudia. Her court ladies wear trousers and hair ornaments of controlled flame. Surgeons and lawyers may be steam-powered automatons. Air travel, by balloon, is commonplace. A kind of Internet is predicted in it. Besides trying to account for the revivification of the mummy in scientific terms—galvanic shockrather than incantations—”she embodied ideas of scientific progress and discovery, that now read like prophecies” to those later in the 19th century.\n\n1830 First intercity passenger railroad, Manchester to Liverpool\n\n1833 Edgar Allan Poe publishes “MS Found in a Bottle”, a hollow earth story, submitted as an entry to a writing contest offered by a weekly magazine. The judges unanimously chose “MS. Found in a Bottle” as the contest’s winner, earning Poe a $50 prize. The story was then published in the October 19, 1833, issue of the Visiter.\n\n1834Cambridge University historian and philosopher of science William Whewell coined the term “scientist” to replace such terms as “cultivators of science” or “natural philosopher”. It was used to describe Mary Somerville, astronomical mathematician whose calculations, among other things, led to the discovery of Neptune.\n\n1835 Poe publishes “The Unparalleled Adventure of One Hans Pfaall“, a short storypublished in the June issue of a monthly magazine as “Hans Phaall — A Tale”, intended by Poe to be a hoax. He uses meticulous technical descriptions. The story traces the journey of a voyage to the moon. Poe planned to continue the hoax in further installments, but was pre-empted by the “Great Moon Hoax” which started in the August 25, 1835 issue of the New York Sundaily newspaper.\n\nThe “Great Moon Hoax“, also known as the “Great Moon Hoax of 1835“, was a series of six articles published in The Sun beginning on August 25, 1835, about the supposed discovery of life and even civilization on the Moon. The discoveries were falsely attributed to Sir John Herschel, one of the best-known astronomers of that time. Authorship of the article has been attributed to Richard Adams Locke (1800–1871), a reporter who, in August 1835, was working for The Sun. Locke publicly admitted to being the author in 1840, in a letter to the weekly paper New World.\n\n1836 First long distance balloon free flight\n\n1838 Poe publishes the novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket first as a few serialized installments, though never completed. The full novel was published in July 1838 in two volumes. Some critics panned the work for being too gruesome and for cribbing heavily from other works, while others praised its exciting adventures. Some hollow earth elements. Considered an influence on Melville and Verne.\n\n1839 Poe publishes “The Conversation of Eiros and Charmion” an apocalyptic story first published in December 1839, and was included that same month in the collection Tales of the Grotesque and Arabesque. Inspired by comets and religious end of the world predictions (1842 was proposed).\n\n1844 Nathaniel Hawthorne “Rappaccini’s Daughter” is a Gothicshort storyby Nathaniel Hawthornefirst published in the December 1844, and later in the 1846 collection Mosses from an Old Manse. Giacomo Rappaccini, a medical researcher, grows a garden of poisonous plants. He brings up his daughter to tend the plants, and she becomes resistant to the poisons, but in the process she herself becomes poisonous to others. Scientist who experiemnts on his own daughter, her lover tries to “detox” her but she is a poison herself and dies.\n\n1851 Jules Verne A Voyage in a Balloon has been described as a techno thriller. Verne uses the devise of the balloon travel to describe the then fairly unknown (to Europeans) areas of Africa. The first of Verne’s stories to appear in English. His works were widely plagerized largely due to the lack of copyright laws at the time.\n\n1859 Hermann Lang The Air Battle: A Vision of the Future Ostensibly Lang is a German professor, but, there is no German edition of his novel and Lang is likely a pseudonym of a UK author. The novel presents a world several millennia in the future, long after European civilization has been destroyed by floods, earthquakes and other disasters. Peace-loving Black rulers of the country of Sahara dominate Africa, and in a final battle with other powers using their great heavier-than-air machine weapons establish a beneficial worldwide Pax Aeronautica, possibly the first use of air power in science fiction. Remarkably for this period, mixed race marriage is strongly approved of.\n\n1864 Jules Verne Journey to the Center of the Earth Subterranean world. This is not strictly a hollow Earth story as the travelers only go a few miles underground but they encounter a lost world. A great adventure story.\n\nArthur B. Evans is regarded as the best translation of Jules Verne. Recognizing that there were so many bad and abridged and redacted versions, new translations are available including by Walter James Miller and Frederick Paul Walter. The translations available on Project Gutenburg are considered quite good.\n\n1865 Verne From Earth to the Moon Space travel by means of a “gun”. Detailed technical descritions are included in this story. Suggests the use of a solar sail.\n\n1865 Lewis Carroll Alice’s Adventures Underground Subterranean adventure\n\n1868 Edward S. Ellis The Steam Man of the Prairies Possibly the first science fiction “dime novel”, preqels to “pulp fiction”. The Steam Man is based on a real invention, built by and patented by Zadoc P. Dederick and Isaac Grass (U. S. patent no. 75874). A fur trapper, two gold miners and a teenaged boy who is a brilliant inventor as well as a hunchbacked dwarf, use the steam man to aid them on their adventures to mine for gold. Many steam powered, robot-like mechanisms appear later in the Frank Reade series 1876-1893. Indians are encountered (during the 1800’s there were continuous Indian wars until 1891) as well as a gigantic trapper who wants to rob them.\n\n1869 Edward Everett Hale “The Brick Moon”, a novella. Friends discuss the need for something akin to the North Star to navigate by but allowing east to west not just north to south; they propose building a brick moon. They build a huge satellite of hollow bricks, and a fly wheel, powered by a dam, to fling it into the air. A storm causes the families of the builders and others to shelter in the nearly finished moon when an accident causes it to launch prematurely. The narrator, with the help of an incredibly strong telescope, discovers the people are still alive and getting along just fine. They communicate with Earth by jumping up and down to send Morse code. The Earth people figure out how to send messages by huge sheets (reminiscent of how The Martian communicated in the film). They send some things by the flinging fly wheel (the ladies insist on sending baby clothes). In the end, they decide to just live and let live like letting a grown child go.\n\n1869 Verne Around the Moon The sequel to From Earth to the Moon. Again, many detailed technical descriptions.\n\nI was one of those little girls who was mad for horses. And ponies. And equine creatures generally. On my fifth birthday, I blew out the candles on my cake and ran to see if my pony was standing in the snow. My father couldn’t get me a pony, of course, but that didn’t stop me from wanting and dreaming and loving, and it didn’t stop him from trying every way he knew how to make it up to me. When he built a house for himself and my two brothers and me, the wall paper in my room had horses, the lamp on my dresser was a black knight on a black horse, pictures of horses cut from magazines and traced from books covered the wall by my bed. When we went to the Kansas City Zoo, I always got to ride the ponies, a slow plod up and down a narrow track, once when we first arrived and once just before we left to go home. I must have been a strange figure, sitting completely still, holding on to the little bar on the saddle, solemn in the moment of bliss that had to last me until the next trip to Kansas City.\n\nFifty years after blowing out those candles, I finally got a horse. She was slender and delicate, a lady’s horse, copper colored like a bright new penny. I loved her more than I can say. When, after years of great adventures together, she developed severe laminitis, a terrible and painful affliction, she had to be put down. My heart was broken.\n\nMy husband still has a horse, and we ride her one or two times a week. I no longer fox hunt or go over jumps or even really gallop. But the little girl I once was needs to ride a horse sometimes. To have wanted something so much for so long, it would be wrong to deprive myself of that. On a cold day when it would have been easier to stay home and read than to go out to the stable and brush all the mud off of the horse and clean her feet and tack her up, I realized that the little girl I had been would have done nearly anything for the opportunity to brush that horse and ride her. That made me wonder what other things she had longed for, prompted me to try to remember what that the girl I once was longed dreamed about. I’m a grownup now and can fulfill her wishes. I can see an ocean, walk on a mountain, write a book, visit friends late into the evening. I can have a pet who sleeps in the bed with me. I can paint and learn to play the piano and write poetry. No one says I have to do any of it well. But she can. I can do that for her. For me.\n\nImage: Amish Honey and me, by Jonathan Hutchins.\n\nHappy New Year everyone! This was supposed to go out yesterday, but as Bob Cratchit said in A Christmas Carol, “I was making rather merry yesterday.” So here is the last post of 2022 or the first of 2023, however you care to count it.\n\nOver the holidays I did a lot of baking. I made cookies and candy and various quick breads, most to give away as gifts and most from old family recipes. While I was making all these holiday treats, I was remembering every person who had given me a recipe or a cooking implement or who had taught me some baking skill or who had been in my kitchen or whose kitchen I had been in.\n\nFood is so often the language of love. We have our personal favorites , and when someone makes that dish for us, we know we are loved. I used a bundt pan that formed a ring of pine trees to make a cake for a Christmas party. At the party was the woman who had given me that pan, one that her dearest friend had bought some time before she died and, as far as I know, had never been used. I made the cake as a gift of remembrance and affection.\n\nMy stepmother and I, at times, had a rocky relationship, but time mellowed us both, and we came to have a great affection for one another. One thing she did touched me more than any other. When I was visiting my childhood home, I commented that her date pudding was my favorite dessert. Every time after that when I came to visit, she made sure to have that special dessert waiting for me. Eventually, I got the recipe, so now that she is gone, I can make it and remember her and the love she and my father bore for one another.\n\nSome of the cooking I do for my husband has been reverse engineered. He will tell me what he remembers about the dish, and I will acquire recipes that approximate it and modify as required. My mother-in-law gifted me with the family recipes for some of the more exotic family favorites. One is a lebkuchen that is different from the ones most people are familiar with. This is because Jonathan’s Nana was Swiss and not German. He has always called them shuttle tiles (with a frosting that is obviously the tile adhesive) because of their intense crunchiness. They are spicy and crispy and amazing, and definitely not German.\n\nI consider the maintaining of gifted family recipes and utensils a sacred trust. My aunt’s pickles, my mom’s date pudding, the Swiss Lebkuchen, and all the other gifts of cookie cutters and pans and assorted utensils I’ll use, and I will remember every person who brought the foods of love into my life.\n\nImage: Holiday cookies, by Marilyn Evans\n\nIn An Essay on Man, Alexander Pope wrote, “Hope springs eternal in the human breast.” We quote him all the time, and because we dare not do anything but hope, because it is easier than wearing ourselves out with despair, or because we are fools, we keep hoping. I hope that next year my democracy will be intact, the climate will not kill us all, wars and assassinations will go away, and people will be civil to one another. I hope famine and homelessness will abate. But more than all of those, I hope my family and friends will stop dying for a little while, if only so I can catch my breath. And in addition to all this, I hope my garden will stop being an unmitigated disaster.\n\nYes, I know. With all the woes in the world, I shouldn’t be moaning about my garden. But honestly, the thing that is supposed to bring me joy and respite from the weary world is making me unhappy. Now that the beds are put to sleep and any pots that can be have been moved indoors, it’s time to take stock. In the war to have a few fresh fruits, vegetables, and flowers, I’ve lost most of the battles. But I have arms and armor. I have the entire winter to lay out a plan. So next year….\n\nI keep hoping that rabbit-proof fencing will spare the greens, that diligence will thwart the squash bugs, that drip lines will make up for a complete lack of rain for weeks on end. I hope the squirrels will find someplace else to dig than in my flower pots. I hope I can give my poor, sad lilies of the valley some friends to fill their bed. I hope the stressed trees and shrubs survive the winter, the perennials come back, and the invasive species stay dead.\n\nGardening is always an act of faith. We trust the the dead-looking seed really is waiting to burst into life. We believe dirt and water and time will make a little sprout peek out into the daylight and reach for the sky. I watch eagerly as blossoms appear and insects travel from one to another, dispersing fertility. Every spring–in fact, every winter after the initial disappointment of the fall has faded a bit–I am wildly, madly hopeful that the spring will be wonderful, the summer will be bountiful, the autumn will be a celebration of abundant harvest. I hope the frosts will end early and return late. I hope to can and freeze and cook for everyone I love. I hope to foist excess produce off on unsuspecting strangers.\n\nSo as we go into winter, I will lay out my battle plan for my garden. And I will vote in every election. I will reduce my carbon footprint. I will give plasma. I will donate to Harvesters and the DAV and anyplace else that is fighting to stave off hopelessness. I will speak out against hate and violence, and I will strive to be kind. Because just hoping isn’t enough."
