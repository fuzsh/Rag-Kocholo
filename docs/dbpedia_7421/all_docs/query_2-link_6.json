        "text": "Iocaste, also known as Jupiter XXIV, is a retrograde irregular satellite of Jupiter. It was discovered by a team of astronomers from the University of Hawaii led by Scott S. Sheppard in 2000, and given the temporary designation S/2000 J 3.\n\nIocaste orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 20,723 million kilometres in 609.427 days, at an inclination of 147° to the ecliptic (146° to Jupiter's equator) with an eccentricity of 0.2874.\n\nIt was named in October 2002 after Jocasta, the mother/wife of Oedipus in Greek mythology.\n\nIocaste belongs to the Ananke group, believed to be the remnants of a break-up of a captured heliocentric asteroid.\n\nThe satellite is about 5 kilometres in diameter and appears grey (colour indices B−V=0.63, R−V=0.36), similar to C-type asteroids.\n\nIn the Timeline[]\n\nSpace Travel (1969)[]\n\nIn Space Travel a ship is tested by travelling to and landing on various planets and moons in the Solar System. Since Jupiter was one of the planets used in the testing process it is probable that some of its moons were used as well.\n\nNotes[]"
