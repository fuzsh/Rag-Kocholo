        "text": "MOONS OF ALL THE PLANETS\n\nDo you know all 294 moons of the planets (and dwarf planets) in our solar system? Well here they are! Every so often new moons are discovered for Jupiter and Saturn. Moons are listed by size from largest to smallest for a given planet.\n\nMercury moons = 0\n\nPlanet Mercury is too close to the Sun to hold on to a moon.\n\nVenus moons = 0\n\nPlanet Venus may have had a moon in the distant past, which collided with another object and then impacted Venus.\n\nEarth moons = 1\n\nPlanet Earth has a single, exceptionally large moon. Earth also has several quasi-satellites - asteroids 2020-CD3 and 2020-HO3 being the closest with the most stable temporary orbits.\n\nMars moons = 2\n\nPlanet Mars has two small moons - both of which may be captured asteroids. Deimos and Phobos are very difficult to see except in large telescopes due to being so close to Mars. Moons are listed by size.\n\nDwarf Ceres moons = 0\n\nDwarf planet Ceres located in the asteroid belt has no moons, which is surprising for its size.\n\nDwarf Hygiea moons = 0\n\nDwarf planet Hygiea in the asteroid belt also has no moon. However, a number of smaller asteroids (also called minor planets) do have moons, but they are all too faint to see in any amateur telescope.\n\nJupiter moons = 92\n\nPlanet Jupiter has 92 known moons, and up to 600 tiny moons lurking around it. The four Galilean moons Ganymede, Callisto, Io, and Europa are large enough and bright enough to see in binoculars. Moons are listed by size. See also Moons of Jupiter for A-Z list and facts.\n\nSaturn moons = 145\n\nPlanet Saturn has 145 known moons. The first 6 moons are viewable using a telescope, and the largest moon Titan, is visible through good binoculars. Saturn also has hundreds to thousands of moonlets embedded in its ring system. Moons are listed by size. See also Moons of Saturn for A-Z list and facts.\n\nUranus moons = 27\n\nPlanet Uranus has 27 known moons. The first 4 moons are viewable using a medium-to-large telescope. Moons are listed by size. See also Moons of Uranus for A-Z list and facts.\n\nNeptune moons = 14\n\nPlanet Neptune has 14 known moons. The largest moon, Triton, is visible using a large telescope. Triton is a captured dwarf planet from the Kuiper Belt. Moons are listed by size. See also Moons of Neptune for A-Z list and facts.\n\nPluto moons = 5\n\nDwarf planet Pluto has 5 moons. Pluto and Charon are considered a binary dwarf planet system due to Charon's exceptionally large size. None of the moons are visible in any amateur telescope. Moons are listed by size. See also Moons of Pluto for A-Z list and facts.\n\nKuiper Belt dwarf planet moons"
