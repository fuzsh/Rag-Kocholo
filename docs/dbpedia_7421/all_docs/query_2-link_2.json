        "text": "Iocaste is an retrograde irregular moon of Jupiter. Iocaste is a member of the Ananke group, a family of Jovian satellites which have similar orbits and are believed to have a common origin. Iocaste orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 20723 million kilometers in 609427 days, at an inclination tilt of 147° to the ecliptic (146° to Jupiter's equator) with an eccentricity of 0.2874 and about 632 Earth days of full orbit.\n\nDetails[]\n\nlocaste has a gray shade similar to Praxidike and Harpalyke, similar to C-type asteroids. Since it's part of the Ananke group, some people believes that it has a brown surface."
