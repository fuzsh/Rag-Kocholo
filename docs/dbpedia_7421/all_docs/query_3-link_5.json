        "text": "Iocaste is one of the 100 moons discovered orbiting the planet Jupiter. Iocaste was discovered on 23 November 2000 by Scott S. Sheppard, David C. Jewitt, Yanga R. Fernandez, and Eugene Magnier. Iocaste is a member of the Ananke group of Jupiter moons.\n\nIocaste's mass is estimated/calculated at 194,826,896,302,635 kg. Its density has been calculated at being 2.6 g/cm^3. Iocaste volume is 74.00 (km^3). The albedo of the Iocaste is 0.04. The albedo is the amount of radiation reflected into space Iocaste. Iocaste's equatorial radius is 3.00km. The Equatorial Radius is based on the assumption of the albedo value. The escape velocity of Iocaste is 11 km/h. The escape velocity is the speed an object needs to be travelling in order to break free from the objects gravity. The larger an object is, the more velocity (speed) is needed to break free from the object.\n\nThe equatorial circumference of Iocaste is 16.3 km. The surface area of Iocaste is 84.95 Km^2. The surface gravity of the Iocaste is 0.002 m/s². For comparison, the Earth's surface gravity is 9.807 m/s². The larger an object is, the stronger the surface gravity is.The Mean Orbit Velocity (M.O.V.) is the speed at which it orbits is 8714.40 km/h. The average distance of the object from its parent is 21272000.00km.\n\nOrbital Details\n\nIocaste orbital period, i.e. the period it takes to complete an orbit round Jupiter is 631.5 days. The figure is also known as the sidereel period. The figure comes from N.A.S.A.. The orbital inclination of Iocaste, the angle at which Iocaste orbits to the orbital plane, is 159.7 degrees. The orbital eccentricity is 0.2151 of Iocaste, the degree at which Iocaste orbits close to a circular (0) orbit as opposed to an elliptical (1). The semi-major axis of the orbit is 21270 10^3Km, which is the furthest point from the centre to the edge of an elliptical point.\n\nAnanke Moon Group\n\nAnanke group of Jovian moons are all believed to have the same source, probably the result of a asteroid collision. The remnants were caught by the immense gravitational pull of Jupiter and remain in orbit ever since. The name derives it name from the largest in the group. All the members of the group orbit in a retrograde orbit hence why they all finish with the letter 'e' in their name.\n\nList of Members in Ananke Group\n\nAnanke\n\nEuanthe\n\nEuporie\n\nHarpalyke\n\nHelike\n\nHermippe\n\nMneme\n\nOrthosie\n\nPraxidike\n\nThelxinoe\n\nThyone\n\nFacts and Figures\n\nDate of Discovery23 November 2000DiscovererScott S.
