        "text": "Moon phase and lunation details\n\nMoon in ♑ Capricorn\n\nMoon is passing about ∠24° of ♑ Capricorn tropical zodiac sector.\n\n4 days after First Quarter\n\nPrevious main lunar phase is the First Quarter before 4 days on 12 August 2024 at 15:19.\n\nSturgeon Moon after 2 days\n\nNext Full Moon is the Sturgeon Moon of August 2024 after 2 days on 19 August 2024 at 18:26.\n\nNeap tide\n\nThere is low ocean tide today. Sun and Moon gravitational forces are not aligned, but meet at big angle, so their combined tidal force is weak.\n\nApparent angular diameter ∠1905\"\n\nLunar disc appears visually 0.5% wider than solar disc. Moon and Sun apparent angular diameters are ∠1905\" and ∠1896\".\n\nLunation 304 / 1257\n\nThe Moon is 12 days young and navigating from the first to the middle part of the current synodic month. This is lunation 304 of Meeus index or 1257 from Brown series.\n\nSynodic month length 29.61 days\n\nThe length of this lunation is 29 days, 14 hours and 43 minutes and it is 2 hours and 11 minutes shorter than the upcoming lunation's length. The lengths of the following synodic months are going to increase with the lunar orbit true anomaly getting closer to the value it has at the point of New Moon at apogee (∠180°).\n\nLunation length longer than mean\n\nThe length of the current synodic month is 1 hour and 58 minutes longer than the mean synodic month length. It is 5 hours and 4 minutes shorter compared to 21st century's longest synodic month length.\n\nLunar orbit details for 08/17/2024\n\nTrue anomaly ∠127.3°\n\nThe true anomaly of the Moon orbit at the beginning of this lunation cycle is ∠127.3° and at the beginning of the next lunar synodic month the true anomaly is going to be ∠155.7°.\n\nMoon before perigee\n\n8 days since point of apogee on 9 August 2024 at 01:32 in ♎ Libra the lunar orbit is getting narrow while the Moon is moving towards the Earth. It will keep this direction over the next 3 days until the Moon reaches the point of next perigee on 21 August 2024 at 05:05 in ♓ Pisces.\n\nDistance to Moon 376 311 km\n\nThe Moon is 376 311 km (233 829 mi) away from Earth and getting closer over the next 3 days until the point perigee when Earth-Moon distance is going to be 360 199 km (223 817 mi).\n\nMoon before ascending node\n\n8 days after descending node on 9 August 2024 at 01:06 in ♎ Libra the Moon is positioned south of the ecliptic over the following 4 days until the lunar crosses the ecliptic again from South to North in ascending node on 22 August 2024 at 10:27 in ♈ Aries.\n\nMoon after southern standstill\n\n1 day since the last southern standstill on 15 August 2024 at 20:10 in ♐ Sagittarius when the Moon has reached South declination of ∠-28.546° the lunar orbit is extending northward over the next 10 days to face maximum declination of ∠28.606° at the point of next northern standstill on 28 August 2024 at 11:09 in ♋ Cancer.\n\nDraconic month\n\n22 days since the beginning of this draconic month in ♈ Aries the Moon is navigating from the second to the final part of the lunar cycle.\n\nSyzygy in 2 days\n\nIn 2 days on 19 August 2024 at 18:26 in ♒ Aquarius the Moon is going to be in a Full Moon geocentric opposition with the Sun and thus forming the next Sun-Earth-Moon syzygy alignment."
