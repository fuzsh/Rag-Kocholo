        "text": "As Spring progresses, many residents of Central Indiana begin to think of planting flowers and vegetables, and often wonder exactly when the threat of a freeze (defined here as a low temperature of 32 degrees or lower) will pass.\n\nAbove are maps of the dates of the average final 32 degree and 28 degree temperatures of the Spring. Maps are courtesy of the Midwest Regional Climate Center. Click the maps for a larger version.\n\nHere is some information on the final spring freeze (32 degrees), including its average date of occurrence, and the earliest and latest dates in the spring that the final freeze has happened. All data is from Co-op and ASOS observations."
