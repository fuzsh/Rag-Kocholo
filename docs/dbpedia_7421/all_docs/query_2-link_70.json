        "text": "About 11.30 last night I had a good clear view of Jupiter with the 4 galileans clearly visible - with Io and Europa really close to each other, really impressive in itself.\n\nHowever, I was sure that I could see something else. On the same side of Jupieter's globe as IO and Europa (viewed through a SCT) at about seven o'clock I could see a speck of light, about the same distance away as Callisto was at the time. (Sorry I can't give the distances in degrees etc).\n\nQuestion is, was this a fifth moon or was it a star?\n\nCheers\n\nCan't say I'm not a little disappointed. I reall thought I'd got one there!\n\nWhat's the likelyhood of coming across any of the other moons?\n\nI'm using an 8\" SCT.\n\nHaving made a similar \"non-discovery\" quite RECENTLY (But with correct hunch-ed), I'm still quite impressed. Perhaps there are quite a lot of instances, where a star masquerades quite well as a Jovian satellite... or NOT, as the case may be?\n\nMore common still when, as with Saturn, satellites don't \"line up\", 'cos of it's axial tilt and there are a few more (mag 10 or so) + Titan (mag 8.3) candidates.\n\nI would imagine that Triton is going to remain somewhat elusive for me from my back garden.\n\nI did manage to spot Neptune last night though, which was encouraging.\n\nWhat sort of mag would you recommend to get the most out of Neptune?\n\nI would imagine that Triton is going to remain somewhat elusive for me from my back garden.\n\nI did manage to spot Neptune last night though, which was encouraging.\n\nWhat sort of mag would you recommend to get the most out of Neptune?\n\nNeptunes disk is ony 2.5' across, so to resolve this to a disk I would say at least x250. The higher the better really.\n\nBut to see it's moon I found about x150 mag was perfect to see it glimpse in and out of good seeing.\n\nI spotted Neptune for the 1st time last week with my 4\" refractor. At 189x I could discern a disk as opposed to a point of light but it is a very tiny disk !. No chance of Triton with my 4\" frac methinks although I have seen a mag 13ish supernova with a 12\" dob at the SGL4 starparty so there is hope with my Lightbridge 12\" on an excellent night I guess.\n\nJohn\n\nYeah, i saw a planet and four of its moons last night. I didn't really observe it that much because i've only just got my new telescope and i'm still getting use to it. It was either Neptune or Jupiter, It looked like a very bright star to the naked eye and Jupiter is the brightest thing other than the moon so i think that it was Jupiter.\n\n-Lennon890"
