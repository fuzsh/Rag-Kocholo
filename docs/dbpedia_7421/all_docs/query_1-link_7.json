        "text": "Saturn has 145 moons recognized by the International Astronomical Union.\n\nThe number of moons increased substantially in May 2023 when 62 new moons were discovered by a team led by Edward Ashton, a postdoctoral fellow at the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics.\n\nIts impressive moon tally means it has the most moons of any other planet in the solar system.\n\nSaturn's satellites differ greatly in their composition, from icy giants with subsurface oceans to small, heavily cratered rocky worlds that look like something straight out of a sci-fi drama. While some travel within gaps in Saturn's rings and clear a path through the debris, others orbit farther out.\n\nThe ringed giant's moons also vary considerably in size. The largest, Titan, is bigger than the planet Mercury, while the smallest is no larger than a sports arena, according to NASA. Seven of Saturn's moons are so bright that they are visible from Earth through a telescope. With the right equipment and conditions, it's possible to spot Titan, Rhea, Tethys, Dione, Enceladus, Iapetus and Mimas.\n\nRelated: The 10 weirdest moons in the solar system\n\nSaturn's moons were thrust into the spotlight during the Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 flybys in the 1970s and 1980s, but it wasn't until NASA's Cassini mission reached Saturn in 2004 that we started to see the moons in a whole new — and far more detailed — light. For more than 10 years, Cassini observed Saturn and its family of strange moons, providing us with a window into the unique worlds in our outer solar system.\n\nHere is a list of Saturn's 63 officially named moons, along with the dates of their discovery, according to NASA:\n\nAegaeon: The smallest known moon of Saturn was imaged on Aug. 15, 2008, and its presence was confirmed when scientists found it in two earlier Cassini images.\n\nAegir: Discovered on December 12, 2004, by Scott S.

At that time, astronomers believed they were observing one moon known unofficially as \"Janus.\" But in October 1978, Stephen M. Larson and John W. Fountain realized that the 1966 observations were of two separate objects (Janus and Epimetheus). This was confirmed by Voyager 1 in 1980. Therefore Larson and Fountain, along with Walker, officially share the discovery of Epimetheus.\n\nErriapus: Discovered on September 23, 2000, by Brett J. Gladman, John J.

Burns using the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii reflector on Mauna Kea, Hawaii.\n\nSaturn's 8 biggest moons\n\n1. Titan\n\nMean diameter: 3,200 miles (5,150 kilometers)\n\nThe largest of Saturn's moons and the first to be discovered is Titan. It is the only moon in the solar system known to have a substantial atmosphere. Nitrogen and methane extend around the moon 10 times as far into space as Earth's atmosphere, sometimes falling to Titan's surface as methane rain.\n\n2. Rhea\n\nMean diameter: 950 miles (1,500 km)\n\nRhea is a heavily cratered moon composed of ice and rock. The frozen dirty snowball is tidally locked with Saturn, meaning one side always faces toward the ringed giant. In 2010, the Cassini spacecraft detected a thin atmosphere — known as an exosphere — composed of oxygen and carbon dioxide.\n\n3. Iapetus\n\nMean diameter: 914 miles (1,470 km)\n\nIapetus features a high-contrast surface of light and dark. As such, it has been dubbed the yin and yang of the Saturn moons. Iapetus, like Rhea, is thought to be composed of ice and rock. When Giovanni Cassini discovered Iapetus in 1671, he noted that the moon had one side much darker than the other, as he could only see Iapetus when it was on the west side of Saturn. Iapetus also contains some of the highest mountains in the solar system. A chain of 6-mile (10 km) high mountains stretch along the moon's equator.\n\n4. Dione\n\nMean diameter: 698 miles (1,120 km)\n\nDione is a heavily cratered moon with a dense core. It is likely composed of silicate rock with the remainder of the moon made of ice. Unusually, the tidally locked moon is more heavily cratered on its trailing hemisphere compared to its leading hemisphere. (Usually, a leading hemisphere is more cratered as it faces impactors like meteors head-on). Scientists have theorized that a recent impact could have knocked Dione, but exactly how the moon spun exactly 180 degrees remains a mystery.\n\n5. Tethys\n\nMean diameter: 662 miles (1,066 km)\n\nTethys travels close to Saturn and feels the gravitational pull of the planet particularly strongly. The heat from Saturn may allow the moon's icy surface to melt slightly, filling in craters and other signs of impact. Made up almost entirely of water ice, the surface is highly reflective. A large trench crosses the moon, running diagonally from its north to south pole and spanning three-quarters of the satellite's circumference. A large crater on the other side of the moon covers nearly two-fifths of the moon's diameter and is nearly the size of fellow moon Mimas. Scientists have found strange red arcs on Tethys that they can't yet explain.\n\n6. Enceladus\n\nMean diameter: 313 miles (504 km)\n\nSaturn's icy ocean moon, Enceladus, has the whitest, most reflective surface in the solar system. Below its frozen shell lies a subsurface ocean sporting conditions that might harbor life. The strange moon spews its ocean out into space; in 2005, NASA's Cassini spacecraft found icy water particles gushing from the surface at approximately 800 miles per hour (400 meters per second). The ejected material forms Saturn's E ring and scientists study the ring to learn more about Enceladus' ocean. Nanograins of silica have been found in Saturn's E-ring, which suggests the presence of hydrothermal vents within Enceladus' ocean. Silica can only be generated in super-hot conditions such as in hydrothermal vents, when liquid water and rock interact at temperatures above 200 degrees Fahrenheit (90 degrees Celsius).\n\n7. Mimas\n\nMean diameter: 246 miles (396 km)\n\nMimas has a gaping crater that gives the rocky moon a strong resemblance to the fictional Death Star in the \"Star Wars\" movies. The impact stands out despite the fact that Mimas is one of the most heavily cratered bodies in the solar system, with overlapping impacts covering the surface. The small moon is composed of mainly water ice — this is also the only substance ever detected on Mimas.\n\nBut Mimas continues to puzzle scientists.\n\nThe small moon orbits closer to Saturn than Enceladus and has a much larger eccentric (elongated) orbit. In theory, Mimas should receive more tidal heating than Enceladus. But while Enceladus displays evidence of internal heat through geysers of water, Mimas' heavily cratered surface implies it's been frozen for a long time. This paradoxical observation of Mimas' geological history has given rise to the \"Mimas Test\", which states \"any theory that claims to explain the partially thawed water of Enceladus must also explain the entirely frozen water of Mimas\", according to NASA Science.\n\n8. Hyperion\n\nMean diameter along its three axes: 255 x 163 x 137 miles (410 x 260 x 220 km, respectively)\n\nHyperion was the last of Saturn's major satellites to be discovered. It is a small, potato-shaped moon with a spongy-looking texture. Scientists suggest that Hyperion's odd shape is indicative that Hyperion may be a remnant of a much larger moon that was destroyed by an impact.\n\nHow to see Saturn's moons\n\nSeven of Saturn's moons are so bright that they're visible through a telescope.\n\nThe easiest Saturnian moon to spot is Titan, as the giant moon can reach magnitude +8. At this brightness, you could spot it using a pair of binoculars or a small telescope. (On the magnitude scale used by astronomers, lower numbers signify brighter objects. For example, at its brightest, the planet Venus shines with a magnitude of about -4.6.)\n\nThe other six moons shine at the following magnitudes, according to astronomy technique and guides website lovethenightsky.com:\n\nRhea: +9\n\nTethys: +10\n\nDione: +10\n\nEnceladus: +11.5\n\nIapetus: +10.5\n\nMimas: +12.5\n\nTo find out where and when to look out for Saturn's moons, we recommend using skywatching apps like SkySafari or software like Starry Night. Our picks for the best stargazing apps may help you with your planning.\n\nIf you're looking for a telescope or binoculars to observe Saturn and its moons, our best telescopes for seeing planets guide can help.
