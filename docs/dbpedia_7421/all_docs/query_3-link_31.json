        "text": "* Jocasta was the wife of Laios and mother, then wife, of Oedipus by whom she had Ismene, Antigone, Eteokles and Polyneikes. She lived in Thebes in the heroic period before the Trojan war. In Homer when Odysseus sees her in the Underworld she is called Epikaste, In Homer and Sophocles she kills herself when she realises she has married her son, but in Euripides' Phoinissai she is still alive at the time of the expedition of the Seven against Thebes. In this play she commits suicide with a sword over the bodies of her sons. \"What should a man fear, whose life is ruled by fate,\n\nFor whom there is clear foreknowledge of nothing?\n\nIt is best to live by chance, however you can.\n\nBe not afraid of marriage with your mother;\n\nAlready many mortals in their dreams\n\nHave shared a mother's bed. But he who counts\n\nThis dream as nothing, easiest bears his life.\"\n\nSummary\n\nJocasta was a famed queen of Thebes. Jocasta had a long line of close relatives. She was the wife of Lauis, mother and later wife of Oedipus, mother of Antigone, Eteocles, Polynices, and Ismene, and daughter of Menocenes. Unfortunately, Jocasta was carrying Lauis' baby who was destined to kill his father. Hearing this Lauis sent Oedipus up to the mountains. Oedipus somehow managed to survive and came back to where he was born. Eventually, he accidentally killed his father and married his mother (Jocasta). When Jocasta realized this, she hung herself; thus becoming one more victim of the curse that rested upon the family of the Labdacids.\n\nMikado In Greek mythology, Jocasta, also Iocaste or EpikastÃª, was a daughter of Menocenes. She was the wife of Laius and, by him, mother (and wife) of Oedipus, and mother (by Oedipus) of Antigone, Eteocles, Polynices and Ismene. Her husband, King Laius of Thebes, consulted an oracle when she was pregnant with her first child, Oedipus. The oracle claimed he was destined to kill his father and marry his own mother. Laius had the baby left out in the woods to die. He was found by a shepherd and given to King Polybus and Queen Merope (or Periboea) of Corinth.\n\nLater, Oedipus killed Laius, not knowing who he was, and married Jocasta, not knowing who she was. When this was discovered, Oedipus tore out his own eyes and Jocasta committed suicide by hanging.\n\nIn astronomy, Jocasta (Iocaste) the name of a small moon of the planet Jupiter.\n\nQuestions\n\nIs Jocasta actually willing to live in incest with her son as long as the information isn't public? Since it was Jocasta, according to the herdsman in the next scene, who actually gave the baby to him and commanded him to abandon it on the mountainside, does Jocasta kill herself because she can't face Oedipus or because she can't face the public shame of their incest?\n\n\"Jocasta is aware that the truth may lead her family into ruins and begs Oedipus to 'give up now' [1160]. She says for him to 'Stop- in the name of god,/ if you love your own life, call off this search!/ My suffering is enough.' [1163] But Oedipus had the courage it took to find out even if it destroyed him, the truth about his birth. Jocasta tells Oedipus to 'have no fear. Many a man before you,/ in his dreams, has shared his mother's bed./ Take such things for shadows, nothing at all- /Live Oedipus,/ as if there is no tomorrow!' [1078].\n\nNotes\n\n\"Jocasta begs Oedipus to stop, for she wants Oedipus to never find out the truth because it will reveal her part in the prophecy that SHE gave him to be killed so that he could not harm her and her husband. The shepherd tells Oedipus what he has feared and he is devastated: 'O- god-/ all come true, all burst to light! /O light - now let me look my last on you!/ I stand revealed at last -/ cursed in my birth, cursed in my marriage,/ cursed in the lives I cut down with these hands!' [1310] These were the feelings too that Jocasta had been burdened with, and her burden was too much to bear, as the soldier reported: 'Flinging herself across the bridal-bed, doors slamming behind her-/ once inside she wailed for Laius, dead so long ago,/ the life that rose up to destroy him, leaving/ its mother to mother living creatures/ with the very son she'd borne./ Oh how she wept, mourning the marriage-bed where she let loose that double brood- monsters-/husband by her husband, children by her child.' Oedipus was enraged by the knowledge he had learned and ran to Jocasta with a sword. And 'there we saw the woman hanging by the neck' [1395]. She could not bear the agony of looking at her son, her husband, Oedipus, in the eyes. He was so grief-stricken that he took the brooches, 'the long gold pins/ holding her robes- and lifting them high, looking straight up into the points, he digs them down the sockets of his eyes' [1405]. She could not look at him nor the townspeople with the dreadful life she was apart of, just as he could not look at her and their life together.\" bach3.mid *\n\nNews Alert:\n\nDouble Tragedy on the Royal Family\n\nIn a shocking twist today, Queen Iocaste is dead. She committed suicide shortly after a Corinthian messenger revealed that Oedipus was not King Polybus' son. King Polybus was the king of Corinth, having passed away recently. To intensify the enormity of the situation, King Oedipus, having realized that he is indeed Laios' son who was destined to kill his father and marry his mother, blinded himself today. He reportedly exclaimed: \"No more, No more shall you look on the misery about me, The horrors of my own doing! Too long you have known the faces of those whom I should never have seen, too long been blind to those for whom I was searching! From this hour, go in darkness.\" According to a messenger who witnessed the entire thing, Oedipus used Iocaste's brooch to \"struck at his eyes--not once, but many times; and the blood spattered his beard, bursting from his ruined sockets like red hail.\"\n\nAs for the queen, she hanged herself when she found out that she had unknowingly married her son and had four children with him. The same messenger who witnessed Oedipus piercing his eyes also saw what happened to Iocaste. He told us: \"When she had left us, in passionate silence, passing through the court, she ran to her apartment in the house, her hair clutched by the fingers both hands. She closed the doors behind her then, by that bed where long ago the fatal son was conceived--That son who should bring about his father's death--We heard her call upon Laios, dead so many years, and heard her wail for the double fruit of her marriage, a husband by her husband, children by her child.\"\n\nThis tragic turn of events devastated all of Thebes, from the fields of fruitless farms to the lonely streets of the capital city. Many can only shake their heads in disbelief that their troubles was caused by their own king, who had committed the horrible sin of killing his father and marrying his mother. Many feel that Thebes has had suffered enough with the famine and unborn babies. Why have the gods continued to plague Thebes with misfortune? However, nobody knows what will happen now.\n\nSophocles:"
