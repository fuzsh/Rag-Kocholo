        "text": "Archives have an important role in this dramatic girl’s love webcomic, Vowrune, written by Caetano Capriolli. This begins in the issue “Ratslayer,” when Hilda and her vowshield, Viwyn, are set to organize the collection at the national archives.\n\nThat isn’t the only issue archives appear. In the next issue, it is noted that the archives stores hundreds of years of history, and it is said to be an important place for anyone interested in learning about the past, especially scholars of the history of magic. They work to implement a new cataloguing system which is better and more precise, working with Mwajala who is their supervisor, and an assistant named Rehin, being one of the teams working on this project. They even wear masks in the archives, check the contents of boxes, verify their location, and note when any documents were missing. Any damaged documents would be restored, while documents were prepared for enchantment. There were even scrolls which would allow you to find locations of documents, and they even freeze a moment in time in a sort of photograph. [1]\n\nIn the issue after that, Viwyn and Hilda bond more, as working with archivists, and romantically are closer together. Later, they search through documents, and Rehin comes to bring them a ladder, embarrassing them both. Following that, they sneeze with all the dust in the archives, and later realize they a romantic couple. [2] In many ways, these issues, despite the fact that they are relatively positive, and seem to have archivists of color (like Mwajala and possibly Rehin) share some of the stereotypes of archives, particularly that they are dusty. Perhaps they aren’t “dustier than Dusty’s dustbin” like in Amphibia, but they embody these stereotypes regardless.\n\nAs the National Archives puts it, maintaining a clean storage environment is an important “ongoing responsibility”, with great care when dusting fragile, damaged, or brittle archival records, and not using dust clothes to clean or wipe photographs or textual records but only shelves and box exteriors. Dusty and dirty documents, NARA states, can only be dusted with a recommended “clean, soft brush”, with the same for photographs and exteriors of bound volumes. At the same time, shelves need to be cleaned before “refiling storage boxes and bound volumes” and states that shelves have to be “completely dry before records are reshelved.” The guidance continues by saying:\n\nWork areas should be kept clean. Dust cloths must be discarded when they become dirty, and brushes must be washed with soap and water and air-dried on a regular basis to avoid transferring dirt from one surface to another.\n\nThis is something I wish was reflected in pop culture depictions, although it isn’t because it is “too easy” to go with inaccurate stereotypes and not put in the work to base fiction on what archives are really like. On the other hand, Viwyn and Hilda seem to be doing archival tasks, especially when it comes to checking box contents, verifying location of materials, note when documents are missing, restoring damaged documents, and even using (magical) finding aids. Specifically they are engaging in the duties of preservation (to an extent) and processing. The latter entails “sorting, filing, labeling, and rehousing” records within “specific archival containers” and is within the archival arrangement. Processing itself is simply defined by the Dictionary of Archives Terminology as “preparing archival materials for use”, which is something they did.\n\nArrangement is defined by the same definition as “organization and sequence of items within a collection” but also the process of organizing materials with “respect to their provenance and original order, to protect their context and to achieve physical or intellectual control over the materials”. It is implied that Viwyn and Hilda, along with unnamed others working on this task, are doing this. At the same time, there is some implied preservation (keeping records “from harm, injury, decay, or destruction, especially through noninvasive treatment”), conservation, and restoration, although it is not shown.\n\nBased on these issues, I believe that both Viwyn and Hilda would be skilled to engage in diplomatics, meaning the study of “creation, form, and transmission of records, and their relationship to the facts represented in them and to their creator” in an effort to evaluate, identify, and communicate “their nature and authenticity.” There are also narrower terms like general diplomatics and special diplomatics. While I first mentioned this on this blog in February of last year, summarizing the call by scholar Francis Blouin for new principles about diplomatics, I have not yet seen this in a fictional series, but would love to see it in some series in the future.\n\n© 2023 Burkely Hermann.

She also described Zootopia as feeding into “the stereotype of records and archives being distant,” and the almost useless archivist in Voltron: Legendary Defender. One of the best examples of what she describes as the “go-to depiction” of an archivist is Archie in Regular Show, but there are others as well, which align and buck this depiction.\n\nIf he can be considered an archivist, there is the Librarian in an episode of She-Ra: Princess of Power. He oversees the Library in the Valley of the Lost, and is said to be a hermit. He is an elderly man with White hair and is White. He also manages what is known as the Inner Library, which has books “in a language not used in a thousand years.” It is, arguably, a bit archivy. He is not the only White archivist I’ve written about on this blog. One of the oft-mentioned on here is Jocasta Nu, an elderly White woman, who runs the Jedi Archives. Another example I sometimes forget is the White female archivist who is manipulated by Anna to change a birth record in My Dictator Boyfriend. [1]\n\nSome fan fics seem to feed into the idea that archivists are White people. These fics show archivists as stereotypical with grey hair, for instance. Others showcase archivists of color, even making Bow’s dads archivists, even though they are historians in the original series, She-Ra and the Princesses of Power. This is a bit of an oddity, however. As, others example of a White archivist are the records clerks shown briefly in an episode of 180 Angel, Abigail Chase in the National Treasure franchise, and a reference librarian in Can You Ever Forgive Me?. Additionally, it could also be argued that Theoda and Pothina in Cleopatra in Space are archivists, or at least information professionals of some kind as they work in a museum of the show’s protagonist.\n\nApart from Hermes Conrad, a bureaucrat who you could argue is an archivist I suppose, there’s the Japanese man, Ura, in Pale Cocoon, a green Gem named Peridot in Steven Universe. The latter two could be either be said to be archivists, each in their own way, or engaging in some archivist tasks. In any case, Peridot’s voice actor is Shelby Rabara, a Filipino-American actress and dancer. More directly than any of these examples is the Black male record clerk, Clark, in Joker (played by Brian Tyree Henry), who tries to help Arthur Fleck get his hands on records of his mother. However, he is determined to stick to the rules, leading Fleck to literally steal the records from him to avoid the red tape.\n\nThere are two characters other than Hermes, Ura, Peridot, or the unnamed record clerk which can undoubtedly be described as archivists: Arizal in Recorded by Arizal and Grandpa Park in Stretch Armstrong. Neither seems to have professional training (Arizal may be on the path to such training), but both engage in actions which make them archivists in one way or another. There’s a solo archivist in Ultraman Taiga, a presidential archivist named Briony in Leif & Thorn, and a 26-year-old archivist named Cortez Velasquez in Heirs of the Veil, the blue-skinned sisters (and archivists) in Lore Olympus, and Rae, an aspiring archivist in Always Human.\n\nThere are many other examples and characters who engage in archivist duties like arrangement, description, preservation, appraisal, reference, collaboration, outreach, administrative tasks, and selection, so in that sense, this is only scratching the surface. That is in part because the number of posts on this blog are minimal, not even reaching 100 posts at present, so I don’t have many other examples to use for this post. But, if I decide to pursue this in the future, I may come back to this post and build on it again.\n\n© 2022 Burkely Hermann. All rights reserved.\n\nIn late January 2021, Jennifer Snoek-Brown of Reel Librarians wrote about the lack of reel librarians of color on her site, committing herself to have at least half of her posts which “focus on reel librarians of color and more diverse portrayals of librarians onscreen,” after reading a SNAP discussion (which I participated in), with archivists lamenting the lack of diverse representation onscreen. She noted that she spent a lot of time “reading through this discussion thread and reflecting on my own years-long journey to learn more about my White privilege, how to be a better ally, and how to be intentionally anti-racist in my own personal and professional spheres,” and said that we can do better with representation when it comes to diverse portrayals of librarians, and went back through her blog after creating a “librarians of color” category and tag, noting that after “9 years of blogging and 492 published posts about librarians in film, only 42 posts focus on or include librarians of color,” meaning that less than 10% of her “posts focus on the racial diversity of librarians.”\n\nShe further noted that “the librarian profession continues to be overwhelmingly female…and White,” committing herself to being more intentional in applying “anti-racist values and principles” by intentionally highlighting more reel librarians of color, making posts about reel librarians of color “more visible and discoverable,” while doing more “research about cinematic portrayals of POC librarians.” She made caveats in the sense that she is a White woman, that it is a sensitive issue, and that “there are many other lenses with which to analyze librarians onscreen,” further stating that when White actors play “characters of color” she will not include them, and added that she is “focusing on American films and films primarily in the English language” but not international films.\n\nYou may be asking, what does this have to do with archives, archivists, and even this blog? Well, I have an “Archivist of Color” tag. I haven’t done what Snoek-Brown did with making it a category too, because I wanted the categories to be broader and the tags to be more specific.\n\nThis year, I highlighted two archivists of color in a guest post on Jennifer’s blog, Reel Librarians, specifically Grampa Park in Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters and Arizal in Recorded by Arizal. Coincidentally, one of my first posts on this blog which focused on an archivist of color was Grampa Park in Stretch Armstrong and the Flex Fighters. In that post, I wrote that archives being in basements is a common theme in fictional works, that the archives in this series is messy, and asking what “kind of organizational methods” are being used, wondering if there is any “rhyme or reason for how the information is stored,” since Park is a former reporter.\n\nIn retrospect, I wish I had analyzed the series a bit more and not used as many screenshots, but it was in the early days of my blog. Even so, it was an inspiration for me to do further research. The same could be said of the two archivists in webcomics I mentioned in a short post back in February: Cortez Valesquez in Heirs by the Veil and Briony in Leif & Thorn. However, in November of last year, I wrote about Lachesis, Clotho, and Atropos, sisters and archivists in 80s style clothes who work at the records department in Lore Olympus. While they are literally a different color and aren’t White (they are blue), so I put them in this category, as they are literally of color. Perhaps that inclusion doesn’t make sense to some, but I can easily rationalize it. Anyway, in that post, I note that Lachesis asks him for paperwork, including “signed consent from Kore, and Hades asks to go around it,” with Clotho and Lachesis agreeing to this “on the condition that he give them some wine. I also noted that Lachesis is “responsible for records of enduring value” and is “also a custodian of the records themselves.”\n\nMoving back to animated series, there is aspiring recordkeeper Arizal in Recorded by Arizal, which I wrote about for the American Archivist Archives Portal and recently in a guest post for Reel Librarians. Arizal has a dream to be a recordkeeper, learning more about herself, and even laments about leaving her stuff behind if she becomes a keeper. I also noted that as Arizal explores the world, she will be “bound to the records themselves, and their creation” and will make “the annals of history richer for all the people of Maktaba.”\n\nJust as important is the unnamed Black record clerk in the film, Joker and Rae in Always Human, the latter was a webcomic. In the case of Joker, the records clerk, Clark (voiced by Brian Tyree Henry) works at Arkham State Hospital and has a heavy storage box, giving Arthur Fleck records about his mother, and Arthur grabs the file and runs away with it. Fleck has been seeking information about his past, with the records clerk behind a metal grate “symbolizing a division between those who can access records and those who can’t,” and a flashback where Fleck’s mother is “being interviewed while Fleck simultaneously pages through the files, including newspaper clippings.”\n\nThis film shows that for one, “the records center is part of the system which is oppressing people,” secondly that clerks “are hemmed in by bureaucracy which limits their ability to provide access to records,” and thirdly the “division between those who can access records and those who can’t. These are all relevant when it comes to the archives.”\n\nThen we get to Rae in Always Human, as I talked about earlier. Rae, as I noted in that post, like Arizal, dreams of becoming an archivist and gets a proper job as an archivist, in an entry-level position, which includes some VR work. She later makes up with her friend, Sunati, and the latter assures her that “she is hardworking.” Later she convinces Sunati to “do real-time archiving in space.” Again, I wish I had done some more analysis there. But, I was still really excited to write it. Just as valuable were my writings about\n\nPossible archivists George and Lance (if you stretch it) in She-Ra and the Princesses of Power in August 2020\n\nExs of Meera, like Diane, Emmy, and others who work in archives, in the webcomic Power Ballad (all people of color)\n\nArchivists in Vatican Miracle Examiner (Robert Nicholas), Tsurune (Seiya), and Children of the Whales (Chakuro), and Tri-Squad VoiceDrama (Filis)\n\nDue to the fact that there are articles in Anime News Network which mention archivists in most of the above-mentioned series and others, I’ll have to do reviews of all or most of them, even though only one is an anime, specifically Tsurane. [1] Somewhat close, arguably, could be Khensu in Cleopatra in Space, as he is voiced by an Indian man, but he is not an archivist in any sense of the word, so I couldn’t add the tag here.\n\nUnlike Snoek-Brown, I’ve only made 59 posts on this blog, and 15 posts have the tag “Archivist of Color,” which is about 25.5% of my posts at the present. So, I could do better, although that is pretty good, to say the least. However, there is a caveat here in that archivists are often not displayed in popular culture, at least not in animation, so the percentage would be even higher if all the posts (currently numbering 12) about archives that don’t feature archivists are removed. That would bring the percentage up to about 41%. Still, it could be higher, which I will try to improve in the coming year, but this depends on the media I consume and watch.\n\n© 2022 Burkely Hermann. All rights reserved.\n\nNotes\n\n[1] ANN reviewed or noted the Children of the Whales manga here, here, and here, the Vatican Miracle Examiner manga here and here, and the Tsurane anime here. Also, Junie Hoang in Super Dimension Fortress Macross is credited as an Archivist. There is a pornographic manga named Archives but I’m not sure whether it actually has archives in it, lol. Similarly, in Bravely Archive D, “the user plays a librarian travelling the world to gather knowledge for a library central to Luxendarc,” but I’m not sure that archives appear.\n\nThis OVA peaked by interest when I read a review by THEM Anime Reviews about it, which noted that it focuses on a person named URA who is “mining digital archives of the distant past for information,” finding in archival images a “long-gone world of green grass and animals and clouds and oceans” and his co-worker, Riko, often distracted, while he becomes “increasingly obsessed with trying to decipher a strange and disturbing record.”\n\nSo, the episode begins with Ura climbing stairs in a facility and him saying that “the archives we know of as history ended at some point.” Wee then see him looking over records from the past, leafing through a book, which is a way to communicate his supervisor, noting that he is looking through a visual record of some type from 2000 C.E. He agrees to send the record onward, through the bureaucracy, while secretly making a copy of the record himself, among others he is collecting. Basically, he is forming his own collection of records! As soon has is about to look at the next record, an audiovisual record, there is an air raid siren. He then talks about “wreckage of archives” scattered across the world, which contain “fragments of the former world,” saying he is evacuating archives because it is “the only way to understand the past.” He later tells Riko he is “obsessed” with evacuation/processing of records because of the archives. He tells about about a record he found and says to himself that through archives people were able to understand the reality of the present, with people only able to live on a part of the world.\n\nLater, Riko and Ura look at the record he saw the day before, which he partially restored. Riko says that books are a “medium for passing on archives” and they wonder whether the place shown in the video is an archival data storage facility or not. As she walks out, not interested at first, she recounts how all sorts of people use to work there, but now they are the only ones working there. He becomes dedicated to figuring out what this record is really saying, slowing deciphering it. His supervisor notes that Riko is planning on leaving and discusses with him about the value of archives, then says this:\n\nThat can’t be good! Ura says they have already been confirmed as fact, in response, and his supervisor says he wishes sometimes that they were all lies. Ura and Rika discuss the past and where people live in this world shaped by environmental modifications. When Ura says that looking through the archives can help change the world, Rika tells him it is “better not to understand,” since humans destroyed the world in the past, saying she doesn’t want to lose any more hope in reality. She goes as far as to say that archives shouldn’t have been “dug up” (processed and brought in) in the first place. Later, Ura is back looking at records about population growth affecting the earth’s environment (not sure why they couldn’t have just said “climate change”), saying that perhaps he wanted to immerse himself in archives to avoid reality. The last parts of the OVA are spent of Ura using clues from the audiovisual record, which I think is a music video, to find out something about the past, speeding on an elevator up into the sky. Rika is shown coming to his work cubicle and doesn’t find him there, later seeing a video which tells her more about the past. The OVA ends with Uta looking at what appears to be the Earth, meaning they are on the Moon (I think?)\n\nAnyway, there were some interesting archives themes in this, better than other anime like Little Witch Academia and Mystic Archives of Dantalian, both of which confused libraries and archives, to give two examples. It appears that Ura is doing some level of archival processing, which is “preparing archival materials for use,” although he is clearly not engaging in arranging, description, or analysis. Even so, he may be described as an archaeologist, but he seems like an archivist to some extent, albeit a strange one, as does his colleague, Rika.\n\nI wish this was a longer series where they could explore the archives more, but I would say I was relatively satisfied with this on the whole. I don’t know if its the best representation of archives, and archivists, but it is definitely a different one from anything I’ve seen recently and definitely more positive than the archives in Phineas and Ferb, Fluidium, and Meau that I’ve written about recently.\n\n© 2022 Burkely Hermann. All rights reserved.\n\nIn their glossary of tropes, #ArchivesInFiction talks about a “popular trope in which the Archivist is portrayed as an unapproachable curmudgeon who views the archives as their own personal fiefdom and is therefore protective of their records and their knowledge” which they call “keeper of secrets.” In this post I’d like to highlight some of those people, as I know them, in series I’ve seen up to this point. Even tough the second example isn’t a curmudgeon, he still is protective over records in his care but for a different reason.\n\nStar Wars: Attack of the Clones\n\nThis is the quintessential example of this trope and it was the subject of one my first posts on this blog. Putting aside the archives-library confusion in this film, which I, of course, wrote a whole post about, Madame Jocasta Nu, seemingly the Jedi Archives lone arranger, first asks Obi-Wan if he needs help, but then declares the archives are totally immutable, thinking there is no way that anyone could tamper with the records. Don’t they have records management tools or something to check the records? Why do they blindly trust that no one tampered with the records? After finding that Kamino DOES exist, was there any consequences for her? I sure hope so. There is no doubt that she, and the archives, were of little help to Obi-Wan, who was faulted for chasing something that didn’t exist. I have to disagree with what then-SAA President Randall Jimmerson said about the film: “George Lucas presents a more confident view of archives.” How in the world can that be the case? Isn’t this view of an archives very cynical? I mean, I’m taking away from this that archives shouldn’t be totally trusted. And also the fact that if items do not appear in archival records, they do exist. However, I can agree with him that this vision definitely “shows the limits of archival control” and the illusion of the power of the archivist, who has a powerful and crucial role.\n\nOther than this, in that post, Samantha Cross is right to call Nu a person of experience and age, and says that her confidence and complacency are worrisome,and argues there “a distinct lack of scrutiny and curiosity in Jocasta that’s endemic throughout the Republic.” In that post I also noted that she served as Archives Director for over 30 years, formerly on the Jedi Council for 10 years, and that she was reliant on data of the Jedi Archives. This also makes clear the impression, for archivists, that everything in their collections is, as I noted in that post, all there is, that they have everything, that records could not be tampered with, which is absurd, to say the least.\n\nNu sort of reminds me of Filis in Tri-Squad VoiceDrama, who is also a lone arranger. Currently, there are almost 300 fics which feature Nu on Archive of Our Own. However, only ONE fic specifically mentions her as an archivist, and even that fic doesn’t seem that positive to me, when it comes to archives, from what I can tell. [1] I did like this one (even though it slightly confuses libraries and archives) where she wonders what is hidden from them:\n\n…\n\nTwo hours later, having returned the youngling – Charzi, of Pod Kwinn – to her teachers, Jocasta was staring at the blank space on what should have been a top of the line star map of the entire known galaxy.\n\nIt was the best known star map of the galaxy, being updated daily as new information came in from the exploratory corps and other private enterprises. And yet, she was staring at clear proof that someone had sabotaged her archives.\n\nNo, not her archives. Pride and possessiveness were traits unbefitting a Master of her years and discipline. Still, this was a problem that needed to be rectified immediately.\n\n…\n\nJocasta’s eyebrows went up, but the scouting and exploring of a newly discovered system and interacting with the locals respectfully were long accepted parts of the Trials for those who chose the archival path.\n\n…\n\nShe was going to need to audit the entire library. Top to bottom just to see what else they’d missed. It was going to take years, even if the entire Education Corps and Archivists worked on it. Which they would be.\n\n…\n\nJocasta stared at the archives, gaze scanning over the shelves and shelves of books, scrolls, datapads.\n\nWhat else was being hidden from them?\n\nI think one fic writer put it well, that after the Kamino incident, she “made a whole whack of archive backups and stashed them in increasingly unlikely places, which allowed at least some to survive long enough for Rey to get to them,” adding that you don’t get to be “Head Archivist by being casual about data integrity and backups, especially once you’ve been shown a problem!”\n\nThe same issues with Nu also are somewhat reflected in the animated series, although you could argue the series is a bit more fair.\n\nJoker\n\nThe archivist, er actually records custodian/clerk is not a curmudgeon but he really wants to stick to the rules. As I noted in the post, Arthur Fleck wants to get records about his mother,but the records clerk lugs in a heavy storage box and does some digging for Fleck. He ultimately, however, says he can’t give the file to Fleck without the right forms, saying he needs his mom to sign a “patient disclosure form.” Fleck won’t stand for this, and he ultimately grabs the file and runs away.\n\nApart from the metal gate itself symbolizing, as I noted in the post, the division between those who can access records and those who can’t, there are other takeaways from this. For one, in this film, the records center is literally part of the system which is oppressing people. Secondly, the clerks are prevented by bureaucracy from providing patrons with access to records in a fair, equitable, and efficient way. Thirdly,is the division between those who can access the records and those who can’t access the records. I wish more series and fiction would discuss this, but sadly, they do not.\n\n© 2022 Burkely Hermann. All rights reserved.\n\nNotes\n\n[1] This expands when you only use the term “archives,” with some only mentioning it in passing as “Jedi Archives,” (same here, here, here, here, here, and here), another which confused libraries and archives sadly, along with those about flirting in the archives, one more specifically about her, missing records, various archivists, interactions between Nu and Jedi, surprise in the archives, finding a stray Padawan in the archives, vastness of information there, Anakin meeting Nu, and her dying during Order 66.\n\nArchives are often portrayed stereotypically in popular media and confused with libraries, as is the case in the Star Wars franchise, the Star Wars: The Clone Wars animated series, and The Mystic Archives of Dantalian. Archivists themselves are often portrayed similarly to librarians and, as such, embody many of the same stereotypes. Archives are places where people can access, in person or online, first-hand accounts of events, including various original materials, whether paper documents, maps, photographs, and digital records, and are staffed by specially trained individuals called archivists. The records within these repositories are kept due to their continuing, and long-term, value to users and those creating the record. Archivists often attempt to make their collections publicly available, whether through outreach or digitization of existing records. While libraries also make their collections available, they include secondary sources, like books, non-print, and other print materials which are organized by author and subject, and can be checked out for home use. Archives, in contrast, are arranged according to the person, organization, or community which created them. Their records cannot be checked out by patrons because they include inactive, and unique, documents no longer needed for day-to-day operations, with specific guidelines in place for accessing those records.\n\nArchivists are often shown negatively in popular culture, and when shown, they are mostly White women, with a lack of BIPOC (Black, Indigenous, and People of Color) archivists. This echoes the dynamics of the archival field, which is, as stated in the last census of archivists in 2004, and will be shown in the upcoming census of the field, majority White. Furthermore, Samantha Cross of POP Archives, a fellow archivist who has examined portrayals in popular culture, mostly points to White archivists and archives in her reviews. I have found the same when examining animated series with archives and archivists.\n\nTwo animated shows stand out in featuring BIPOC archivists: Stretch Armstrong & The Flex Fighters and Recorded by Arizal. Both series will be highlighted in this post.\n\nWhen I came across the animated series Stretch Armstrong & The Flex Fighters, I was excited to see an archivist of color, voiced by Sab Shimono (a Japanese–American actor), which inspired me to every episode of the series. While he never gets a proper name — only called Grampa Park — this archivist is the grandfather of a Korean-American kid named Nathan, who helps his grandson and his friend, Ricardo, do research in his “newspaper archives,” when the internet goes down. Unfortunately, the archives is in his basement, perpetrating another common stereotype of archives which is repeated in fictional works. Even so, federal records were once stored in basements of government buildings, although this soon ended after the National Archives began managing federal records. As for his newspaper archives, there are questions as to how well the newspapers are preserved and the fact the archives itself is his personal hobby, with archivists having a professional job to preserve records, not because it is their hobby to do so. There are some hobbyists who archive documents, but they likely do not have the professional training to do such archival work. While the basement archives of Nathan’s grandfather are a bit messy, with some records which are melting, he, a former reporter, asks what they need (engaging in reference work). They look through the stacks, organized by newspapers which are either local or worldwide. The newspaper archives reappear several times and the characters use it to access information which the villains try to keep hidden. Even with the reservations about the series, as I’ve previously explained, I still chuckled at his joyful declaration in one episode: “some say I’m packrat, archivist I say!” A proud archivist indeed.\n\nA much more positive portrayal of archives is embodied in the protagonist of Recorded by Arizal, a 16-year-old Filipina girl named Arizal (voiced by Christine Marie Cabanos, an American voice actress of Filipino descent). She is an aspiring recordkeeper, known as keeper for short, who will travel across the world, gathering materials along the way to add to the global archive, to preserve the history of humanity. Arizal lives in a futuristic city named Maktaba with her cousin, uncle, and aunt. She composes a series of vlogs during her summer vacation, as an extra credit assignment and part of a formal application to become a keeper. While she decides whether she wants to pursue this career path, and the episodes released so far are a coming-of-age story, a main driving theme is “the discussion of record keeping and learning” as confirmed by series creator Yssa Badiola. On other occasions, Badiola has stated that future record keeping and vlogging is archival in and of itself. As an aside, the word “maktaba” means library or place of study in Arabic, showing that the show paid close attention to cultural and historical notions.\n\nThroughout the series, Arizal struggles to define why she wants to be a keeper. She begins the series by saying she became interested in becoming a keeper because of her friends Lia and Rizella. Afterward, a keeper tells her the harsh reality of gathering information, causing her to have a personal crisis, as she worries about leaving her prized possessions behind before making the journey. Later, she reflects on her dream when standing on a secretive overlook and how she got through it with the help of friends. In the final part of the series, it is shown that her application to become a record keeper is accepted by the athenaeum, a literary and scientific organization that advances learning. If the series is greenlighted for a full season, her role as a keeper will be explored as she “records her journey to adulthood” and tries to make the history of humanity all the more complete.\n\nThere is one character who gets honorable mention in this post: Hermes Conrad (voiced by Phil LaMarr, a Black American actor and writer) in the mature animation, Futurama. It is worth asking if he can even be considered an archivist since he is described, and shown, as the Planet Express company bureaucrat who has a deep love for filing and organization. He is able to quickly look through the Physical File Archive so effectively that he secretly takes out a file hiding his role as an inspector of Bender Rodriguez, a robot who is part of the company’s crew. In order to spare himself from Bender’s wrath, he later destroys the file. The so-called “archive” is a single file cabinet with three drawers in an out-of-the-way location, hidden deep in the Central Bureaucracy. Brad Houston, an archivist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, countered the notion, saying that this “physical file archive” is a records center because it contains semi-active records, rather than an archive.\n\nI am optimistic there will be further BIPOC archivists in future animations, due to the hopeful premiere this year of shows like S.A.L.E.M.: The Secret Archive of Legends, Enchantments, and Monsters on YouTube and the other shows on a growing number of streaming platforms. I say this because popular animated series such as Amphibia, Carmen Sandiego, Little Witch Academia, and Bloom Into You, all feature either archives or archivy settings. The same can be said about The Bravest Knight, Rapunzel’s Tangled Adventure, Steven Universe, and Manaria Friends all of which feature archives. Even so, these shows are cases of archives that have absent archivists, with some of these archives literally being abandoned. Furthermore, this article could be expanded further if George and Lance, the self-declared historians of the archive-library-museum in She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, and the possible manager of the Ancient Egypt special collections room of the PYRAMID school library in Cleopatra in Space, Khensu, the mentor of the show’s protagonist, Cleopatra, are included. In the latter case, however, it is not known if Khensu is the one that organized the information or if it was someone else instead. In the end, I’ll keep writing about this subject to engender continued discussion while pushing for more, and better, representation of the archives profession in popular culture.\n\n© 2022 Burkely Hermann.

I recently came across two posts by archivist Samantha Thompson in April 2018 and July 2015 about the duties of archivists and what information they keep. In April 2018 post, where she notes that in film, archives “are generally mysterious places,” hiding and revealing secrets that move the plot forward, with one of the biggest mysteries is “how all that stuff got into the archives in the first place,” with old documents somehow ending up in the archives, but it’s never shown how this happens. That’s definitely true. I mean, there are even series where characters literally set the archives on fire and there are no consequences for their actions. With that, I’d like to compare what she says to the archivists that I’ve found in popular culture up to this point.\n\nArrangement\n\nThompson writes about how archivists organize and store records, engaging in an arrangement of records in a way that doesn’t disturb “important connections, clarifies how the records were used, related, or collected,” while making it easier “to navigate the records.” This includes physically processing records based on the organization established, when sorting, filing, labeling, and rehousing them in specific archival containers. This connects to Lore Olympus, where, at the end of episode 111 (“You Tell Me”), the two of the Fates (Atropos and Lachesis) talk about how they need to refine their filing system for records. This is alluding, I would argue, to the arrangement that archivists engage in, as these records, memories stored in a videotape format akin to VHS, have to be stored and organized in a specific way. Unlike Steven in Steven Universe, these tapes are stored correctly.\n\nThis contrasts with the infinity archive, confused with a library, in the Mystic Archives of Dantalian. How, in the world, are all those records arranged, described, and selected? That is, of course, never explained.\n\nDescription\n\nThat connects to description, which are ways to systematically summarize descriptions, giving “researchers snapshots of what they can expect to find in collections,” with these descriptions forming finding aids or guides to the collections themselves. As she puts it rightly, not every individual item can be listed, but a description can help see if a collection is good for research. It could be said that Futurama touched on this with the Physical File Archive, although there is some debate as to whether that is an archive or a records center since it has semi-active records. However, no archivists were seen in the episode. There is implied description by archivists like Filis in Tri-Squad VoiceDrama, Destiny in the X-Men comics, and Robert Nicholas in Vatican Miracle Examiner. The same can be said of the books and materials collected in the family library, or more accurately a library-museum-archive hybrid, in the Whispering Woods in She-Ra and the Princesses of Power.\n\nPreservation\n\nIn one of her posts, Thompson talks about the preservation and conservation of records, whether older records or newer ones. Related to that, perhaps, is the underground newspaper archive of Nathan’s grandfather in Stretch Armstrong. Are the newspapers really being preserved correctly? It’s hard to know. The area may be dusty, but none of the newspapers are moldy from what I remember.\n\nYou could also say that Abigail Chase, a NARA archivist, in the National Treasure franchise is focused on preservation, especially in the first film, despite the stereotypes in that film. The same could be said about the Yale University librarian in Can You Ever Forgive Me? who gives Lee Israel access to historical letters. Sadly, she does not know that Israel wants to exploit the institution for her own financial gain and ego. However, Seiya in Tsurune sees himself as “Minato’s archivist, his preserver and protector” and in the manga series, Children of the Whales, Chakuro is the “Archivist for the Mud Whale, diligently chronicling the lives and deaths of his people,” to give two examples.\n\nAppraisal\n\nIn her July 2015 post, Thompson notes that a lot of what archivists do is “behind the scenes,” using unique terminology, obtaining and assessing records. For the latter, this means selection, appraisal, and acquisition. Appraisal, as she defines it, means:\n\nIn an episode of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars animated series, titled “The Lost One,” Madame Jocasta Nu, the archivist of the Jedi Temple archives, who embodies many stereotypes about archivists and librarians, says that a record is sealed by the Supreme Chancellor. This isn’t appraisal, obviously, but can be assessing the records and providing access to them. I’ll talk more about Madame Nu later in this post. When it comes to George and Lance in She-Ra and the Princesses of Power, Samantha Cross put it well, that you have to “squint and imagine George and Lance appraising, selecting, arranging, and describing their First Ones collection.” No doubt about that. There had to be some appraisal when it came to the special collections room in Cleopatra in Space, within the PYRAMID school library, as they couldn’t have been organized so well without it, I would argue. Still, I haven’t seen, in any of the animations or popular culture I’ve read, archivists engaging in appraisal. I’d like to see it, but I’m not going to hold my breath and assume it will happen.\n\nSome people have written about appraisal directly in their fan fictions, which mention archives, but they have talked about accession numbers, transferring inactive records to archives and the difference between archives and libraries.\n\nReference, collaboration, outreach, and administrative tasks\n\nThompson writes about the ways to connect people with records, whether through reference activities (helping people use the records), collaboration, outreach, and administrative tasks. She is undoubtedly right that “taking care of archives can be a surprisingly busy occupation.” Now, we actually do have an example of collaboration and outreach. In the comic Leif & Thorn, Broiny, the archivist, gives information to the President about people named “Thorn”:\n\nIn later comics, she gives information on Thorn and describes his achievements. She acts as a presidential adviser. In any case, she is helping people with outreach and collaboration. What about reference and administrative tasks? I believe that Nathan’s grandfather in Stretch Armstrong would be engaging in reference, as he points to Ricardo and Nathan to the newspapers he has organized, where they can look for information. The newspaper archives seem like his personal hobby.\n\nWhat about administrative tasks? Well, I haven’t seen an archivist engage in that in any of the media I’ve seen as of yet. Despite the stereotypes in Attack of the Clones, as I’ve talked about time and time again, especially confusing libraries for archives, Madame Nu is shown helping Obi-Wan with his inquiry before her infamous line, which is talked about later in this post. We do see her, in the animation, trying to serve as a mentor to Ahsoka Tano and help her with her studies. So, that’s a positive. Additionally, in Hilda, the librarian definitely engages in reference and outreach by helping Hilda in various episodes. She isn’t an archivist, but she is very close to it because she runs the special collections room in the town library. Perhaps Arizal will engage in some administrative tasks if the Recorded by Arizal series moves into a full season, but I kinda doubt it, because that would be seen as “too boring” for animation.\n\nSelection\n\nIn an April 2018 post, Thompson says that modern archives aren’t an accident are shaped by “the decisions of archivists working together with other professionals,” with more to archival records than their age, archives not keeping everything, and the fact that everything doesn’t need to be preserved. This is connected to the interrelated tasks of acquisition and appraisal, and the important responsibility of archivists to “help determine how the future views the past” through their judgment, making people uneasy. She also talks about the selection of records:\n\nArchivists themselves don’t create the records they collect in archives…They are created in as many places and circumstances as people are found. A record can be as ephemeral…Records reveal events as they unfold…Because records are created for specific purposes, they don’t always survive beyond their initial usefulness…Some records, however, do survive…But no records automatically come into archives. For this to happen requires decisions and planning both outside and inside the archives…Archivists themselves have varying levels of control over whether records ever reach their doors…Some archives acquire records through the organization the archives serves…In contrast, records can also come to an archives from the wide world outside the archival institution’s organization…Over time archivists have devised ways to winnow down and control the deluge of records to those worth permanently saving. Archival records are a further small subset of all the records that survive. The act of making judgements about what records are archivally valuable and worth saving permanently is called archival appraisal…Archivists are always considering and reconsidering their role in shaping the historical and evidential record.\n\nThis runs completely counter to Madame Nu’s infamous line in Attack of the Clones: “if an item doesn’t appear in our records, it does not exist.” Before that, she had been questioning Obi-Wan and acting like he was bonkers, thinking the Jedi Temple archive is immutable, without error. Any archivist knows that is not true. An archive never has every record. It only has specific records. If even Yoda can recognize that someone can erase files from the archive, then why can’t Madame Nu? She is the lone arranger of the archives, as shown in the animation, so she should know about this, but she doesn’t for some reason. My friend talks about selection in one of their fan fictions, where one character becomes head of the archives, which I’d like to quote here:\n\nGeorge and Lance worked with Angella, Bow, and his other 12 siblings, to plan construction of a new building, atop the Fright Zone’s previous location, called the Archives of Etheria…As a kind gesture, Stevonnie gave the diary, The tale of Rainbow Quartz and Pink Diamond, back to Angella. She gifted it, along with other books and materials from her personal library to the growing archives, a new institution of knowledge, where she would serve as a special adviser, helping them choose the right items to add to their collections…Bow accepted her sword and promised it would be added to the growing collections of the new archives.\n\nMy friend says they could have done more here, but I applaud their effort to represent archives positively. Apart from these, are some actions in terms of selecting records among some assorted films, video games, and novels I reviewed in October.\n\nThat’s all for this week. Until the next post!\n\n© 2022 Burkely Hermann. All rights reserved.\n\nSome time ago, I came across an old LISTSERV from June 2001. In it, David Miller of the Philadelphia Department of Records notes that Entertainment Weekly has an article about new summer shows in the U.S. including a character in The Chronicle named Pig Boy, voiced by Curtis “Booger” Armstrong, as a “snout-nosed archivist,” and says may have to “pass on this one.” In response, Russell P. Baker of the Arkansas History Commission and State Archives jokes that he happens to “know some other “snot – nosed” archivists in my time.” I looked it up and found, that yes, he literally has a pig nose! Oh no.\n\nSo much for a good representation of archivists! It brings me to a post by Cate Peebles in Issues & Advocacy back in January 2018. In the post, she notes the “omnipresence of records-related headlines” and the ongoing “relevance of archival work,” along with the proliferation of archives, archival documents, and “the archive” in popular culture, even as archivists are missing in these depictions. She specifically notes that the “true crime documentary” relies on archives, in films like The Thin Blue Line, Making a Murderer, The Jinx, Serial (podcast), OJ; Made in America, The Keepers, and Wormwood. She goes onto say that these series focus on the “visual power of records,” with archival footage and footage of those materials driving the action while providing the “viewer with access to potential answers and a satisfying resolution.” Peebles goes onto explain the use of records in three series. First is The Jinx, specifically in the form of crime scene photos, samples of handwriting, interview transcripts, and various paper media, along with oral history interviews. Second is Making a Murder, with the “importance of evidentiary records over time and the need for adequate stewardship of legal and public records” a major highlight of the series. Finally, there is The Keepers, which has the protagonists as “keepers of memory, truth-seekers and literal stewards.” Peebles, after noting how film can invigorate archival records, the value of those records in various series, the importance of ongoing stewardship and preservation of archival records, even when actual archives and archivists are absent from narratives concludes with some poignant lines about archives in popular culture which still ring true to this day:\n\n“There is no “popular” image of an archivist and yet we are more present than ever, however unseen we may be. Without records and their keepers, there are no stories to tell.”\n\nI couldn’t have said it better myself! This also highlights two pieces that I added to the Bibliography page on this blog. One is a 1993 piece by James O’Toole which talks about the “symbolic” aspects of recordkeeping and record making, saying that archivists should understand these aspects as they try to preserve their collections, and another by Gabriel Palatz, in 2011, which talks about archival material front and center in many documentaries at the present.\n\nWhat Peebles writes about makes me think about the archivists I’ve written about on this blog before, which makes clear her point. Some, like Abigail Chase in the National Treasure franchise, are glamorous. Others are spinsters, old and stubborn, like Madame Nu in Attack of the Clones and the Star Wars: The Clone Wars animated series. Then there are those who are strict, run basement newspaper archives (like Nathan’s grandfather in Stretch Armstrong), or the 80s-style archivists in Lore Olympus. This becomes even more diverse if we consider George and Lance in She-Ra and the Princesses of Power (although they call themselves historians), along with Khensu in Cleopatra in Space, Dantalian in Mystic Archives of Dantalian, and the Librarian in Hilda to be archivists or at least engage in some archivy duties, then it becomes an even more diverse group! Hopefully, this list is expanded further if Recorded by Arizal gets a proper season, as the protagonist, Arizal, wants to be a keeper, which means that she is engaging in some archivist duties. Additionally, fan fiction itself serves as a place where people can write about archivists, along with various archivists in Hollywood films, and in other parts of popular culture. I’m not sure if I will reach a moment again like what I wrote about in September 2020, stating that it is becoming hard to publish posts on the blog because “of the lack of archives or archivists in any of the media I’m watching now,” mostly talking about animation, but also feature films. That was supposed to be a way to cover me if I end up putting this blog on temporary hiatus. I doubt that will happen at this point.\n\nAnyway, here are two favorite archivists from the above-named animations and comics: Nathan’s grandfather and Clotho in Lore Olympus. I love that Clotho is reeling up the magnetic tape here. That’s cool. I hope it stays in the upcoming animated series.\n\n© 2022 Burkely Hermann. All rights reserved.\n\nRecently, I was reading one of my favorite webcomics by Ari North, Always Human, and came across an issue of the comic [1] where one of the protagonists, Sunati, meets a girl named Rae who has a dream of becoming an archivist! She calls them people who “digitally duplicate heritage sites” and “guardians of history.” She ends up inspiring Sunati and becomes her best friend, which is cool. While I would never describe archivists by using the first descriptor, calling them guardians of history is accurate, as identifying and preserving records is part of what archivists do. However, there is a move to move away from being gatekeepers, instead of focusing on maintaining and organizing records, the process of interpreting documentation of the past, and serving those who wish to use and locate information in the records themselves, to summarize from the SAA Core Values Statement. This issue of the webcomic is not the only one that features archivists, as Rae appears at various other points too. As such, Always Human goes further than other webcomics I’ve discussed on here like That Awkward Magic!! and even Lore Olympus.\n\nIn a later issue of the comic [2] Sunati tells Rae that she hopes a cool project will come her way, including the government outsourcing some of their archival work. Right after that Rae tells Sunati that she won’t be there in the coming year because she is getting a proper job as an archivist! As she describes it, she will be getting an entry-level position, although she describes it as getting people coffee, looking up primary sources, and a “tiny bit of VR work,” as she is skilled with constructing virtual reality. After Sunati calls this “incredible,” she says she will be traveling to Peru and that she will be engaging in “evaluation-based archiving” in a VR (virtual reality) lab in a part of Peru. Sunati is happy for her, even though she is sad to see her go. While archivists don’t usually deal with VR, since, as wrote in August 2018, VR technology has “incredibly exciting possibilities for archives” and allowing users to interact with archival collections in a new way. Of course, this is controversial. In the past, there was controversy over YouTubers colorizing historical videos with AI even when historians (and curators) are telling them to stop, so there are likely similar issues if it was applied more broadly to archival collections.\n\nLater, Sunati expresses her insecurities to her girlfriend, Austen, about Rae and asks herself why she can’t feel happy for her, with Austen comforting her, saying that people have contradictory thoughts. [3] She goes onto suggest that Sunati should just say “I miss you,” which Sunati hadn’t even thought of! In the following issue, she talks with Rae, telling her “I’m really going to miss you,” with Rae admitting she is scared to go somewhere new, with Sunati saying that she was just following in the footsteps of Rae and has no direction in her life. [4] Following that, Rae says that Sunati is wrong and that she has relied too much on her, using a teddy bear to show her emotions, and worrying what will happen if she doesn’t like her co-workers, she only ends up doing busy work and messes up this opportunity to live out her dreams. [5] After some crosstalk, Sunati then assures Rae that she is hardworking, and they bond as the issue ends. They spend time together in Rae’s final hours there and know that they will see each other again, as they will stay in touch. [6] It’s bittersweet, but it also serves as an important point in the lives of Sunati and Rae alike.\n\nSometime later, Sunati is debating whether to go on a year-long mission to a Mars space colony known as Enceladus and is unsure if she should contact Austen, her girlfriend. [7] Rae returns and talks with Sunati, saying that the opportunity is awesome, as she will be able to do real-time archiving in space, with Sunati calling it incredible, but worrying about how long she will be away. The comic ends on a happy note, as Austen and Sunati reunite, Sunati goes to space, and she comes to visit every so often. Yay!\n\n© 2022 Burkely Hermann.
