Malalas writes a repetitive post-Classical Greek, cruder than that of his contemporary Procopius. Drawing seemingly at random from a grab-bag of mostly third-hand sources, he glues together garbled Greek and Syrian myth and history into something a pious Christian could tolerate. He is the most detailed surviving source in Greek for Antioch on the Orontes, his home town, and offers many unique factoids. Corrections gratefully accepted (JBK 2019). This text has 1756 tagged references to 302 ancient places.\n\nCTS URN: urn:cts:greekLit:tlg2871.tlg001; Wikidata ID: Q19738955; Trismegistos: authorwork/205\n\n§ P Elementary handbook of Ioannes brought from the times of Constantine the Great from the years of the creation of the world.\n\nI considered it just, after chopping off bits of the Hebrew chapters written by Moses and the chronographers Africanus and Eusebius of Pamphilus, and Pausanias and Didymus and Theophilus and Clement and Diodorus and Domninus and Eustathius and many other painstaking chroniclers and poets and wise men, to expound for you in full truth a partial account of the events that took place in the time of the kings, up till the events of my times that came to my hearing; I mean, from Adam to the reign of Zeno and those reigning afterwards. It is necessary for those who come after to write the rest, for virtue’s sake. The majority of authors have put forward the exposition of the world as follows.\n\nEvent Date: 565\n\n§ 1.1 BOOK 1 (from Thurn text) OF THE TIMES OF ADAM\n\nThe first human being on earth, Adam, was built or created by God. He had the measurement of his age, 6 feet, including his head, to make 96 finger-widths of this age, his hand-span 16 fingers, his forearm (cubit) 24 fingers, his foot 16 fingers. He lived 930 years.\n\nHis wife was called Eva, and she bore three sons, Cain, Abel, and Seth, and two daughters Azouran (Azura) and Asouam (Awan). At God’s command, Adam put names to all the quadrupeds and winged things and amphibians and reptiles and fish and their offspring. His own name and the name of his wife were spoken to them by an angel.\n\nHis son Seth had wisdom from God, and by God’s command put names on all the stars, and the five planets so they would be recognized by mankind. The first planet star he called Kronos, the second Hera, the third Ares, the fourth Aphrodite, the fifth Hermes. He expounded the seven vowels from the five planets and two heavenly lights. He first discovered Hebrew letters and wrote them down. God called the two great heavenly lights, to the authority of the day the Sun, to the authority of the night the Moon. The very wise Fortunus the Roman chronicler wrote this, in an account I found in Constantinople.\n\nSeth lived 912 years and took as his wife Asouam his own sister and had children with her, and there was a large generation of people and women. Kain took his sister Azouran for his wife.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 1.2 So in the meantime, Enoch the just was born, the son of Jareth, and he did not die. After 1287 years, Enoch was transferred. He was seventh from Adam, as Aquila the Judaean interpreted the Hebrew scriptures expounded by Moses. The priests of the Judaeans interpreted these Hebrew accounts of Moses as follows: The sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were fair, and took wives for themselves from all who were chosen, and they went in to them, as Moses puts it. Sons were born to them, and they were giants upon the earth in those days, the named men from the aeon. From Adam until when the angels desired the sons of Seth to wed the daughters of men of the tribe of Cain, 2122 years.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 1.3 In these times, God sent from the heavens a sphere of fire against the giants in the Celtic country and burned it and them. The sphere came down in the Jordan river and was extinguished. They tell this story about the fire, and say Phaethon was the son of the Sun, and that he fell from the chariot to earth, which story Ovid wrote poetically. The Chaeroneian Plutarch told it more accurately. He said a sphere of fire came down in the Celtic country. The rest of the giants saw so many of them struck by lightning but remained unpersuaded. God was angry, and said to them, “Let my spirit not remain in these men, because they are flesh,” as is contained in the Mosaic scriptures. The most wise Peisander, a poet of the Hellenes after the time of Moses, expressed poetically that these giants were men born from the earth, having feet of snakes, and daring somehow to attack the highest divine forces. He called them dragon-footed, and said they were consumed with various punishments by the gods.\n\nThe most wise Timotheus interpreted this poetry as follows, that for this reason the poet called these men dragon-footed, because their wits had been bestialized and they reckoned nothing of human virtues, but having feet they walked toward evil and unjust things of the earth. […] movement of the sun and the moon, he commanded some to be killed by lightning fire, others to have their bodies turned to stone, others to be shot with the swiftest arrows of death, others to be ripped apart with wounds as from a spear, the rest to be sunk under lots of water. Thus the giants or dragon-footed paid with their lives, dying nastily. The wise Servius said they were held in a deep plain, war with some in the high mountains and on land and in the hollows were dragged as creeping serpents against them and were killed by those dwelling in the heights.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 1.4 And there was a man named Noah beloved of God. Noah was 500 years old and begot three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. God ordered Noah to make a chest, and he made it as the Lord ordered. Noah was 600 years old, and the Lord ordered him to bring everything into the chest with him. Noah brought everything into the chest with him, and all his lineage and all the quadrupeds and reptiles and winged things and amphibians, male and female, as the Lord commanded him. There was a flood on earth for 40 days and 40 nights, and all flesh died, whatever had breath of life, as is contained in the Hebrew scriptures. Altogether, from Adam until the Flood of Noah, 2552 years and 10 generations. In the 601st year of Noah’s life, he emerged from the chest, with his wife and daughters and sons and sons’ wives and every soul of his lineage, and all the beings in the chest, quadrupeds and winged and amphibious and creeping, and everything grew larger in accordance with its kind.\n\nAfter the flood stopped and the waters abated, the chest found itself resting on the mountains of Ararat in Pisidia province, of which the metropolis is Apameia. The wood of it is still there until now, as Pergamus the Pamphylian wrote. Josephus and Eusebius of Pamphilus and other chroniclers wrote that the Ararat mountains are in Armenia and between the Parthians, Armenians, and Adiabenians, and that is where the chest settled.\n\nThe races of Noah had offspring, and there was a crowd of humans and women, and they did a tower-making. Those involved in making the chest were the first to devise ships and put them to swim on the waters. From the flood until the tower-making were 370 years.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 1.5 In this middle time after the flood, Shem the son of Noah begot Arphaxad, a wise man, and Arphaxad begot Kainan, who after the flood wrote an astronomy, having found the names given by Seth the son of Adam, and his children, to the stars, carved on a stone plaque. As the most wise Josephus wrote in the second book of his Archaeology, the grandsons of Seth were pious men who foreknew the coming destruction or alternation of mankind. They made two columns, one stone and the other brick, and wrote on them all the heavenly things expounded by their grandfather Seth, calculating that if the earthly order of mankind were altered by water, the stone column would stay, along with what was written on it, while if it was by fire, the brick and what was written on it would be preserved and become known to the people who survived. The stone stele remained on Siris mountain after the flood, and is there until just now, as Josephus expounded.\n\nSo the race of Arphaxad endured until the making of the tower. Arphaxad lived 135 years. So from Adam until the completion of the tower-building, 2922 years.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 1.6 So the tribes of the sons of Noah were divided, I mean of Shem, Ham, Iapheth, the three brothers. The tribe of Shem took from Persis and Bactria until the Indian land, the length and width as far as Rinokouroura, that is, from the east until part of the south, and Syria and Media and the river Euphrates. The tribe of Ham, the 2nd son of Noah, took from Rinokouroura of Egypt, looking to the south, until part of the west and all Libya and the Nile river, the Chrysorua, and Africa as far as Mauretania and the Herakleotic Pillars and the great sea of Adria. The tribe of Iapheth the third son took from Media on the north until the Britannic Isles and all of Pontus until the part of the west and the Danube and Tanais rivers and the mountains on Caucasia and the Abasgi. All those nations, beginning from the Tigris river which separates Media and Babylonia and until the Pontic Sea, the parts toward Rhodes and Cyprus and the Attalids[?}. The three tribes were separated into 72 nations, as Eusebius of Pamphilus the most wise chronicler expounded.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 1.7 In these years from the race of Arphaxad a certain wise Indian appeared, an astronomer named Gandoubarius, who first wrote astronomy for the Indians. Another was born from the race of Shem, Chous by name, an Ethiopian, who begot Nebrod, the giant who founded Babylonia, whom the Persians say was divinized and became a star in the sky, the one they call Orion. He first revealed hunting and gave beasts to all for eating, and was first among the Persians.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 1.8 From the tribe of Shem, which held Syria and Persia and the rest of the East, of the first son of Noah, was born and made an appearance a giant-born named Kronos, called by Damno, his father, with the name of the planet. He became strong, and was the first to invent being king over and ruling and dominating other people. He was king of Assyria for many years, and subjugated all the land of Persia, beginning from Assyria. He was held in fear by all as bitter and warlike and a killer of many.\n\nHe had a wife, Semiramis or Rhea, so called by the Assyrians because she was proud and arrogant. She was of the same tribe of Shem, son of Noah. Kronos had a son named Picus, who was called Zeus by his parents from the name of the planet. Kronos had another son named Ninus, and a daughter named Hera. Picus Zeus took his own sister Hera as his wife, whom some call Zygia (of the Yoke) Nemesis since they are pleased with her as good and wishing all just things. From her, Picus had a son he named Belus (arrow), because the child was very sharp.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 1.9 Forefather Kronos left his son Picus in Assyria and his own wife Rhea Semiramis with Picus Zeus his son. Taking a large accompaniment, a crowd of brave men, he went to the west, which was kingless and not controlled by some commander, and controlled the western parts, while vanishing from Assyria. He stayed controlling and ruling the whole west for many years, and had a wife there named Philyra, from whom he had a son Afros, to whom he gave the land toward Libya. Afros controlled that region as king, and married Astynome from the island Laceria. He had a daughter he called Aphrodite, naming her too after the planet of heavenly Aphrodite. She became a philosopher and married Adonides an Athenian, also a philosopher, who was the son of Kinyros with his own daughter.\n\nThis Kinyros, having acted in a way to violate nature, exposed the child in the mountains. He was raised by the so-called Oreionian (mountain) nymphs. He grew up very handsome, and Aphrodite fell in love with him. Ares got angry and smote him, for he was a rival lover of Aphrodite. They say Aphrodite went down to Hades together with Adonides, even though she hadn’t died, but because she loved him greatly, and resurrected him. They tell other stories about him, which they call mysteries. They are said to have philosophized together until death. From Philyra, Kronos had another son Cheiron, also a philosopher.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 1.10 After Picus Zeus had been king of Assyria for 30 years, he left his mother and Hera, his sister and wife, and made his son Belus the king of Assyria. He went away to the west toward his father Kronos. Belus was king of the Assyrians for 2 years and died, and the Persians deified him. Kronos saw his son Picus Zeus coming toward him in the west and yielded the kingdom of the west to him, since Kronos was weak and having a difficult time. Picus Zeus was king of the west, i.e. of Italy, another 62 years. After Belus, Ninus the other son of Kronos was king of Assyria. He took his mother Semiramis as his wife, from which it is the custom for the Persians to marry their own mothers and sisters. For this reason, Picus Zeus also took his sister Hera as his wife, as the most wise Homer expounds as follows: “Hera he addressed, his sister and bedmate.” (Il. 16.432) Then Kronos died.\n\nEvent Date: 1000\n\n§ 1.11 Ninus, having become master of Assyria, found Nineveh the city of the Assyrians and was the first to rule in it. He had Semiramis Rhea his wife and mother with him. From his lineage was born Zoroastrius the famous Persian astronomer, who, when he was about to die, prayed to be consumed by heavenly fire. He told the Persians, “If the fire burns me, take my burnt bones and guard them, and the kingship will not fail in your country for as long as you guard my bones. Having prayed to Orion, he was consumed by the fire of the air, and the Persians did what he told them, and keep his remains, turned to ash, until now.\n\nEvent Date: 1000\n\n§ 1.12 After Ninus, Thouras was king of the Assyrians. His father Zames, the brother of Rhea, renamed him for the planet Ares. He became a fierce warrior, who warred against the northern parts. He attacked Caucasus a powerful man, giant-born and very warlike, descended from the tribe of Iapheth the son of Noah. Fighting Caucasus, he defeated him and took his country. Then he came to Thrace, died, and lies there. The Assyrians erected the first statue to this Ares, and did proskynesis to him as to a god. They call him until today in Persian Baal theon, which translates Ares the warring god. A memorial of this is the prophetic voice of Daniel and the three children, because they were compelled to make proskynesis to him. After the death of Ares, Lames was king, and after Lames, Sardanapalus the great was king of the Assyrians. Perseus the son of Danae slew him and took the kingship from the Assyrians. As their king, he called them Persians from his own name. Membronius the Babylonian wrote this for the Persians.\n\nEvent Date: 1000\n\n§ 1.13 The brother of Ninus, Picus Zeus, kept reigning over Italy. In those years there was neither a city nor a government in the west, but all that earth was simply occupied by those from the tribe of Iapheth who had moved there. Picus Zeus lived 120 years, controlling the west and being king over it. He had many sons and daughters from the beautiful women (he seduced them, being a mystic who made various apparitions and overawed them). These women who were debauched by him held him up as a god, because by trickery he showed them apparitions. Picus Zeus had a son named Faunus, whom he called Hermes from the name of the planet. When he was about to die, Picus Zeus commanded that his remains be buried on the island of Crete. His sons built him a temple and put him in Crete island in a tomb, which tomb was in Crete and he lies there up to the present, with an inscription, “Here lies, having died, Picus Zeus, whom they also call Dia. The most wise chronicler Diodorus wrote about him, saying in his exposition concerning the gods, that Zeus the son of Kronos lies in Crete.\n\nEvent Date: 1000\n\n§ 1.14 After the death of Picus Zeus, his son Faunus Hermes was king of Italy for 35 years. He was a crafty man, a mathematician, who first discovered the metal gold in the west, and smelting. He recognized that his brothers envied him, the ones from the women his father Picus Zeus had. They wanted to kill him, and they were many, about 70 of them. For Zeus had impregnated a lot of women having sex with them. A son of Maias was born. To the Theban Alcmene, the wife of Amphitryon, after he had sex with her, was born another son named Heracles the son of Alcmene. He was called Triesperos (of the triple evening). He first revealed philosophizing in the hesperian parts, that is in the west. The people of his lineage deified him after his death, and called a star in the sky with his name, the Chiton of Heracles. They wrote that he wore a lion skin, carried a club, and held three apples. They mythologized that he took the three apples having killed the dragon with his club, that is, having defeated the variegated calculation of evil desire through the club of philosophy, having brave thought as a mantle, like a lion’s skin, and thereby taking away the three apples, which are the three virtues, to not get angry, to not be greedy, to not love pleasure. For through the club of an steadfast soul and the pelt of boldest propriety of thought he won the earthly contest over base desire, philosophizing until he died, as the most wise Herodotus wrote. He told a story that seven other Heracleses were born.\n\nTheophilus the most wise chronicler expounded what was said about Heracles allegorically. Hermes, knowing his brothers’ plot against him, left with an excessive amount of gold in his garments, and went to Egypt to the tribe of Ham, the son of Noah. They received him in honor. He remained there, looking down on everyone and wearing a gold uniform. He philosophized to the Egyptians, telling them oracles. For by nature he was extremely logical. So they did proskynesis to him, calling Hermes a god because he told future events and ministered to them the response from God regarding the future, and provided them with money. They also called him Ploutodotes (wealthgiver) since they believed gold was a god.\n\nEvent Date: 1000\n\n§ 1.15 When Hermes came to Egypt, the king of the Egyptians then was Mestraim from the race of Ham. When he died, the Egyptians made Hermes king. He was king of the Egyptians for 39 years, in pride. After him Hephaestus was king of the Egyptians for 1680 days, which becomes four and a half years and 38 days. The Egyptians did not know then how to count years, abut they called the period of a day a year. They called Hephaestus a god. For he was a warrior and a mystic. Attacking in war, he fell together with his horse, and was wounded, remaining lame. Hephaestus made a law that Egyptian women must be monogamous and behave properly, and that women found in adultery would be punished. The Egyptians were pleased at this, because for the first time they had a law regarding propriety. Hephaestus from some mystic prayer received tongs from the air for making iron weapons. Whence he became dominant in warfare. They deified him for legislating propriety, and finding nourishment for mankind through the manufacture of weapons, and for creating force and safety in war. For before him they used to fight with clubs and stones.\n\nEvent Date: 1000\n\n§ 2.23 BOOK 2\n\nAfter the death of Hephaestus his son Helios ruled the Egyptians for 4467 days, or 12 years and 97 days. The Egyptians then, or some others, did not know how to reckon the number, but some counted the periods of the moon in years, and others the periods of days in years. For the number of the 12 months was thought up after this,\n\nEvent Date: 1000\n\n§ 2.24 from the time when a name was applied to people being subject to kings. Helios, the son of Hephaestus, was strong in loving honor. He learned from someone that an Egyptian women, one of those in wealth and honor among them, had fallen in love and committed adultery with him. Hearing this, Helios sought to catch her by the legislation of his father Hephaestus, so it not be abrogated. He took solders from his army, and learning that the opportunity for her adultery was at night, when her husband wasn’t there, he found her sleeping with her lover beside her. He immediately punished her by parading her through the whole land of Egypt. There was great propriety in the land of Egypt. The adulterer he had executed, and he was pleased. Homer the poet tells this story poetically, how Helios, he says, made a control on Aphrodite when she was having sex at night with Ares. He called “Aphrodite” the desire for harlotry that was controlled by King Helios. The true story, as written above, was composed by Palaephatus, the very wise chronicler. After the death of King Helios, the son of Hephaestus, Sosis was king of the Egyptians. After him, Osiris ruled the kingdom, and after Osiris, Horus was king, and after Horus, Thoulis was king, who captured with a great force the whole earth\n\nEvent Date: 1000\n\n§ 2.25 as far as Ocean. On his return he came to Africa to the oracle, pridefully. He sacrificed and made his inquiry, saying, “Tell me, fire-strong, blessed, who does not lie, who causes the aetherial road to bend back: Who before my reign was able to subdue everything, or who after me?” He was given the following oracle: “First God, afterwards Logos, and Spirit with them, all with joined nature and going to one, whose rule is eternal. Go with a swift foot, mortal, to reach the end of an obscure life.” Immediately on exiting the oracle, he was murdered in Africa, his own people having plotted against him. Manetho wrote about these old and ancient kingships of the Egyptians. In his writings he includes that the names of the five wandering stars are said differently. The star called Kronos they called the Shining (Lampon); Zeus (Jupiter) they call Phaethon; Ares (Mars) the Fiery (Pyrodes); Aphrodite (Venus) most beautiful (Kalliston); Hermes (Mercury) the Polished (Stilbon). Which names the most wise Sotates interpreted.\n\nSo in the years after this, Sostris was first of the tribe of Ham to be king of the Egyptians. He armed and waged war on the Assyrians, and subjected them and the Chaldaeans and Persians, as far as Babylon. He similarly subjected Asia and all Europe, and Scythia and Mysia.\n\nEvent Date: 1000\n\n§ 2.26 When he was returning to Egypt from Scythia, he chose 15 thousand young men as warriors. He made them migrate and commanded them to settle in Persis. He gave them land there of whatever sort they chose. These Scythians remained in Persia from that time until now. They were called Parthians by the Persians, which translated in Persian dialect means Scythian. They have Scythian clothing and language and laws until now, and are extremely serviceable in warfare, as the most wise Herodotus wrote. In the years of the kingship of the aforementioned Sostris was Hermes Trismegistus the Egyptian, a fearsome man for wisdom. He expressed that the name of the ineffable and creator was three great hypostaseis, one godhead. On which account he was called by the Egyptians Trismegistus Hermes. It is contained in various of his speeches to Asclepius these things he said concerning the nature of God. If there were no providence of the lord of everything so as for me to reveal this account, neither would such love possess you so that you would seek concerning it. For it is not doable to provide such mysteries to the uninitiated, but you hear in mind, one alone is the mindful light, before the mindful light. Mind was always illuminated mind,\n\nEvent Date: 1000\n\n§ 2.27 and nothing other was there than the oneness of this, being always in him, always contains everything by his mind and light and spirit. Apart from him, not God, not angel, not daemon, not any other being. For of all he is lord and God, and everything is under him and in him. For his word came all-perfect and fertile and creating, falling on fertile nature, in fertile water, made the water pregnant. And having said this, he prayed, saying, “I swear by you, sky, wise work of great God, propitious… I swear by you, voice of the father, which was uttered first, his only-begotten word. This is contained also in the works compiled by the most blessed Kyrillos against Julian the king, that Trismegistus Hermes, while ignorant of the future trinity, admitted the omoousion.\n\nKing Sostris took Egypt after the victory and died. Pharao also called Maracho was king of the Egyptian land after him. The rest of those who ruled Egypt were from his lineage.\n\nEvent Date: 1000\n\n§ 2.28 In the aforementioned years of Picus Zeus, a certain person from the tribe of Iapheth appeared in western parts, in the land of the Argives, whose name was Inachus. He it was who first ruled in that country, and he founded a city there, which he called Iopolis, from the name of the Moon [Selene], whom he honored. The Argives have a hidden name for the Moon, and secretly called her Io until lately. He built a sanctuary to Selene in the city, and erected a bronze stele/statue to her, on which he wrote “Io Blessed Torch-Bearer.” This Inachus took to wife a woman named Melia, by whom he had three children, Kasos, Belus, and a daughter he named Io from the name of the Moon. The daughter was extremely beautiful. Then Picus or Zeus heard about Inachus, that he had a beautiful virgin daughter. So the king of the western parts sent for and kidnapped Io, the daughter of Inachus, and ravished her, making her pregnant. From her he had a daughter he named Libye. But Io reacted negatively to this incident, and did not want to be with Picus. She gave him and everyone the slip. Humiliated, she left behind her daughter and her father Inachus, and sailed away to Egypt. Having reached the land of Egypt, Io stayed there. After a time, she learned that Hermes, the son of Picus Zeus, was king of Egypt. Afraid of Hermes, she left for Syria, to the Silpion mountain.\n\nEvent Date: 1000\n\n§ 2.29 This is where Seleucus Nicator, the Macedonian, built a city in later years, and he called it Antioch the Great, after his own son. Io died after reaching Syria, as the most wise Theophilos records. But others write that Io died in Egypt. Inachus her father sent her brothers in search of her, along with relatives and Triptolemos and Argives with them. They searched everywhere but did not find her. When the Argive Iopolitans learned that Io died in Syria, they came and stayed there briefly, trying every house while saying, “Let the soul of Io be saved.” Then in a prophetic dream they saw a heifer, which told them in a human voice, “Here I am, Io.” When they awoke, they were astonished at the force of the vision. They concluded that Io lay on this mountain, so they built her a sanctuary and settled there on Mt. Silpion, founding a city for themselves, which they called Iopolis. They have been called Ionitai by the Syrians to this day. So the Syrian Antiochenes, from that time, when the Argives came looking for Io, until now, make this memorial, every year at this time trying the houses of the Greeks. The Argives remained there in Syria for this reason: when they were sent from the Argive land by the command of King Inachus, Io’s father, he told them,\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.30 “If you don’t bring my daughter Io, don’t come back to the Argive land.” So these Ionitai founded a sanctuary of Kronos on Mt. Silpion.\n\nLibye the daughter of Io and Picus or Zeus, got married to someone named Poseidon. They bore three children, Agenor and Belus and Enyalios. Agenor and Belus also came to Syria in quest of Io, if she still lived, and her brothers, since they were their relatives. Finding nothing, they returned. Belus went to Egypt, where he married Sida and had two sons, Aegyptus and Danaos. Agenor came to Phoenicia and married Tyro. He built a city he called Tyre after his spouse. He was king there, and had sons from Tyro: Cadmus, Phoenix, Syros, and Cilix, and a daughter Europa. Agenor was king of those parts for 63 years. The poets, disagreeing with the chroniclers, wrote that Europa was the daughter of Phoenix, the son of King Agenor.\n\nTaurus the king of Crete attacked Tyre, and after fighting a sea battle captured the city at evening time. He plundered it and took many prisoners from the city, including Europe the daughter of King Agenor. Agenor and his sons were fighting on the border.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.31 This incident - Taurus the king of Crete suddenly attacked the country by sea. The Tyrians keep a memorial of that evening until now, calling it Bad Late-Night (κακή οψινή). Taurus took Europa back to his homeland and made her his wife, since she was a beautiful virgin. He called those parts by her name, Europeia. By her he had a son Minos, as Euripides the very wise poet writes. He says Zeus transformed into Taurus (a bull) kidnapped Europe. King Taurus founded in the island of Crete a large city, which he called Gortyna from the name of his mother, who was of the lineage of Picus Zeus. He called the Tyche (fortune) of the city Kallinike, after his daughter whom he had murdered. King Agenor returned to Tyre from the war and learned about Taurus’ surprise attack and the kidnapping, and immediately sent Cadmus for Europa with much money and an army. When he was about to die, King Agenor order that all the land he had conquered be divided among his three sons. Phoenix took Tyre and its hinterland, and called the country Phoenicia after himself. Similarly, Syros call the country allotted to him Syria. Likewise, Cilix called the latitudes allotted to him Cilicia.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.32 Herakles the philosopher, called the Tyrian, lived in the reign of King Phoenix. It was he who discovered the purple-shell. He was wandering on the coastal part of Tyre city when he saw a shepherd dog eating the so-called purple-shell, which is a small maritime species like a sea snail. The shepherd thought the dog was bleeding, and took a clump of sheep’s wool and wiped off what was coming out of the dog’s mouth, and it dyed the wool. Herakles noticed that it wasn’t blood but the virtue of a strange dye, and wondered at it. Recognizing that the dye deposited on the wool came from the purple-shell, and having taken the wool from the shepherd as a great gift, he brought it to Phoenix, the King of Tyre. He too was surprised by the sight of the strange color of the dye. Admiring his discovery, he ordered that wool be dyed from this purple-shell dye and become a royal mantle for him. He was the first to wear this purple mantle, and everyone marveled at his royal raiment, as a foreign spectacle. From then, King Phoenix commanded that no one under his rule dare to wear such virtuous clothing on land or sea, except himself and those who ruled Phoenicia after him, so that they would recognize the King in the army and the crowd from his marvelous and strange clothing.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.33 For in the past people did not know how to dye shades of clothing, but whatever color the sheep’s wool was of that they made their clothing and wore it. The kings were not easily recognized by the subject crowd. So the kings in each place, and reges or toparchs, when they heard this, some designed mantles for themselves, others gold fibulae and cloaks, which they dyed purple or red from some plants, and wore them to be recognized by the crowd, as the most wise Palaephatus wrote. Many years later, the Romans subjugated Phoenicia and began to wear the true royal outfit from the purple-shell, as it was revealed in the beginning. They called it “toga” in the Roman language. The consuls of the Romans wear them even today. Numa Pompelius, who was king of the Romans after Romus and Remus, received ambassadors from the country of the Pelasgians, who wore chlamydes with red stripes, like those from the land of the Isaurians. He liked the style, and was the first in Rome who instituted wearing chlamydes, some in royal purple, with gold stripes, others of his senators and those in magistracies and military ranks chlamydes with purple stripes, the hallmark of royal dress, which showed the rank in the Roman state and the subordinate position.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.34 He ordered that no one be permitted to enter the palace to see him without the uniform of this chlamys, and those guarding the palace did not allow anyone to enter unless he wore a chlamys with the ostentation of royal clothing, as the most wise Tranquillus, the Roman historian, has written.\n\nSyros the son of Agenor was a wise man who wrote arithmetic philosophy in Phoenician letters. He supposed that the authorities were bodyless, and bodies and souls were transferred into other kinds of animals. He was the first to expound these things, as the most wise Clement wrote.\n\nIn these years, Phalek, son of Heber, a pious and wise man, lived 339 years, about whom Moses the prophet wrote. So there are from Adam until Phalek 3000 years, according to the prophecy.\n\nThe aforementioned Picus Zeus in the above years had after Hermes and Herakles another son, Perseus, from a beautiful woman named Danae, the daughter of Acrisius, who was by origin from the Argive country. About her, the most wise Euripides has mythologized, in writing his play, how Danae was put in some chest and cast away, because she had been debauched by Zeus transformed into gold. The most wise Bouttios, the historian chronicler,\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.35 expounded how Picus Zeus had been unable to persuade her with much gold when she was in her bedroom lying near the sea. So he kidnapped her, since she was very good-looking, and ravished her. From her he had a son named Perseus, the aforementioned. They write that he had wings, because from childhood he was very quick-moving. Hence his father Picus Zeus taught him to perform and carry out the Manganeia [witchcraft] of the abominable cup (myseros skyphos), teaching him everything about mystic and impious errors. He told him that “You will defeat all warriors with this, your enemies and every man opposed, and everyone who looks at this face with be blinded and remain so until they are dead and slaughtered by you.” So Perseus was persuaded by his father Picus Zeus. In later times, after the death of his father Picus, when he had come to full age, he coveted the kingdom of the Assyrians, envying the children of Ninus, his uncle, the brother of his father. Having received a prophecy, he went to Libya. On the road a virgin, a village girl, met Perseus. She had wild hair and eyes. Standing in front of her he asked her, “What is your name?” She freely replied, “Medousa.” Holding her hair, with the sickle-spear sword he carried, he cut off her head. Perseus took it and immediately performed mystic rites on the head, as he had been taught by his father Picus the error of the hateful Manganeia.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.36 He carried it in his train to every enemy and warrior to subdue and kill them. He called the head “Gorgon” because of the sharpness of the accessory and its effect on foes. From there he crossed and came to Ethiopia, which was ruled by Cepheus. He found there a sanctuary of Poseidon, entered it, and saw a girl abiding in the sanctuary, by an order given by her father Cepheus, Andromeda, a virgin. He took her from the sanctuary and debauched her, since she was beautiful, and made her his wife. Sailing away, he left that country. When he was coming to the land of the Assyrians, he arrived in the land of Lykaonia. They recognized him and resisted him. He used the help of the Gorgon head and defeated the Lykaonians. Finding a village called Amandra, he made it a city and erected a statue of himself outside the gates, bearing the image of the Gorgon. He made a sacrifice, and called the Tyche of the city Persis from his own name. The statue still stands there until the present. He called the city Ikonion, because he took the image of his first victory with the Gorgon there. He subjected the other countries with no one resisting. When he came to Isauria and Cilicia, and had to undergo resistance from his foes, the following was prophesied, that “When you get off your horse, sticking the flat part (tarsos) of your foot to the ground, you would obtain victory.”\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.37 When he got off his horse in the village called Andrasos, there the flat of his foot stuck. He was victorious through the use of the Gorgon, and made the village a city, which he called Tarsus from the oracle about his foot. He sacrificed an unknowing girl named Parthenope to purify the city. Pleased, he launched an attack from there via Mt. Argaeus against the Assyrians. He defeated them, killed Sardanapalus, their king, who was descended from his lineage, and subjugated them. He ruled over them for 53 years, and he called them Persians from his name, taking from the Assyrians both the kingdom and the name. He planted trees he called perseas, not only there but also in the Egyptian parts he also planted perseas as a memorial to himself. He taught the Persians the rite of the hateful and godless skyphos of Medousa, and they called it the country of the Medes because of the lesson.\n\nPerseus, after ruling the Persian land for many years, learned that Ionitai from Argos were living in Syria. He came to them in Syria on Mt. Silpion, since they were his relatives. They received him with all honor and greeted him (made proskynesis), since the Argive Iopolitans knew that he was from the race of the Argives, and they happily celebrated him in song.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.38 When a winter storm came, and the river running past the city of the Ionitai, then called the Drakon and now the Orontes, was flooding badly, he asked the Ionitai to pray. While they were praying and carrying out the rites, a sphere of fire-lightning came down from the sky, which caused the storm to cease and the flow of the river to be contained. As they marveled, Perseus from that fire lit a fire, and kept it guarded. This fire he carried back to Persian territory, to his own kingdom, and he taught them to honor that fire, which he told them he had seen being brought down from the sky. The Persians continue to honor that fire as divine, up to the present day. Perseus built a sanctuary for the Ionitai, which he called “of the immortal fire.” He built in Persia, similarly, a fire sanctuary, installing pious men to minister to it, whom he called Magi. The very wise chronicler Pausanias has recorded this.\n\nAfter some time, King Cepheus, the father of Andromeda, came from Ethiopia to attack him. Cepheus couldn’t see, due to his age. When Perseus heard that he was attacking, he was furious, and went out against him carrying the head, and showed it to him.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.39 Unable to see, Cepheus rode at him on horseback. Perseus didn’t know that he didn’t see, and concluded that the Gorgon head he was holding no longer functioned. So he turned it toward himself and looked at it. Blinded, he remained that way until he was killed. So then, the son of Perseus and Andromeda ruled over the Persians. He was appointed by his grandfather Cepheus, the king of Ethiopia. Cepheus commanded that the hateful head of the Gorgon be burned, and left for his own country. So the lineage of Perseus continued to rule the land of Babylonia. During the years mentioned above, Cadmus from Phoenicia, the son of Agenor, took Boeotia. His father had sent him to look for and rescue Europa, his sister. When Cadmus learned that she was ruling over Crete, he set out for Boeotia and stayed in Boeotia, where he taught them the Phoenician letters, which they didn’t know. They honored him and made him king of Boeotia. He was, after all, quite handsome to look at. He ruled the Boeotians for 62 years, and married a woman from there named Harmonia. With her he had six daughters: Ino, Agaue, Semele, Eurynome, Kleantho, and Eurydike, who took the name Cadmiades when they grew up.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.40 He founded a great city in Boeotia, which he called Cadmeia after himself, and reigned there. He recalled Teiresias from exile, the Boeotian philosopher, the beast-slayer, who was wealthy in money and worth and wisdom. It was he who introduced to the Greeks the doctrine that everything happened of its own accord and that the world was unforeseeable. So the priests plotted against him, and he was exiled to the sanctuary of Daphnaean Apollo, on the grounds that he had a womanly mind. Also he was overly inquisitive about how women get pregnant having sex with men, and the nature of blood gets separated into bones, flesh, veins, nerves, and blood, and an infant is given life and gets born, as the most wise Cephalion wrote. The most wise Sophocles published a play, and said in a poetic manner that Teiresias saw Pallas bathing and became a woman, meaning, he was seeking to know the wisdom of the creator and was unable. Hence Sophocles expounded in his writings these truthful things: God is one, who made sky and the long earth and the swell of the blue-gray sea and the violence of the winds. Mortals stray much in their heart, we set up statues of gods from stone and wood,\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.41 or gold or ivory reliefs, as consolation for woes, and by making sacrifices to them and vain festivals we think we are being pious. Sophocles appears to praise monarchy.\n\nCadmus gave his daughter Agaue to a senator named Echion. This Echion had with her a son named Pentheus, a sensible man in thinking and everything. Semele, his other daughter, very beautiful indeed, was loved by a certain Polymedon, the son of the senator Aetherion, descended from the race of Picus Zeus. He seduced and debauched her, and by her had a son. While she still had the child in her belly, it being winter, there was great lightning and thunder. The girl Semele was frightened, and the infant was born there and then, at seven months. She did not withstand the pains, and died, and Cadmus sent the infant to the Nysian country, and he was raised there. This is why it was written that Zeus guarded him in his concavity (κόλπος) for the remaining time of the maternal womb, because, having been born untimely, he had part of his life, relative to the time of birth, as the very wise Palaephatus wrote. His grandfather Cadmus called him Nysios, but the others called him Dionysos as having worked some wonders from the solar prayer, since he was of the paternal race [from Zeus], and deified him for having found nourishment for mankind in grapevines.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.42 For he expounded things about grapevines and farming. Dionysos also learned some mystic things and became a wise man in mystagogy, and made some seemingly miraculous apparitions. He attacked the Persians and Indians and other countries. When fighting, he used to show miraculous apparitions, and he had a large army with him. When Cadmus grew old, he yielded the administration of the Boeotian kingdom to his grandson Pentheus, the son of Echion, who was praised by the senators and by everyone. Cadmus took Teiresias and passed a long time in Boeotia on the Cithaeronian mountain. When Dionysos heard that his grandfather had gotten old, he came to the city of Cadmeia with great pomp and weaponry, as if he ought to be king. Pentheus saw him making apparitions, having armed soldiers, inviting all his relatives, teaching his female relatives the mystagogy of solar Bacchic revelries, and calling them Bacchae, similarly teaching the citizens the rites of certain solar prayers in order to persuade the Boeotians that he could lay claim to the kingship.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.43 He was equipped with weapons and an army, whom they say, he called Leapers, since they were quick and springing about. They were from the Bessic country, and trained in mystic wisdom. Recognizing this, Pentheus was jealous of him, since he heard that he desired the kingship of the Boeotians. They became enemies and clashed in battle in the city. Pentheus won and captured him. He tied him up and guarded him for the presence of Cadmus, his grandfather. Agaue, his aunt and the mother of Pentheus, persuaded her son to have him released. Once released, he plotted to kill Pentheus. Arming himself, he sent for Agaue and asked her to reconcile him to Pentheus and to go with him to Cadmus. She worked hard on Pentheus, her son, and persuaded him to reconcile with him and to go to Cadmus, who was grieving over them, and Agaue agreed to come with them and persuade her father. Dionysos was furious against Pentheus, because he had been tied up and insulted by him. For he had told everyone that Dionysos had been born from harlotry. For this reason, in after years Euripides found such a written account and published a play, the Bacchae, with Pentheus saying the following: “Semele having been brought to child-bed by some mortal, laid the sin on Zeus.”\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.44 When they had been reconciled, Dionysos commanded his army to take position in advance in a narrow place on the road and arrest Pentheus. When he was about to go out, Dionysos came to him with a few men, so Pentheus, not knowing the plot, also took a few men with him. Agaue was with him. As they were going, the army of Dionysos attacked and captured Pentheus. Dionysos immediately order him to be beheaded, and the head given to his mother, since she had insulted Dionysos. Dionysos returned to the Cadmeia to be king. On account of this, they say that Agaue decapitated her own son, being she persuaded Pentheus to reconcile with Dionysos and became the cause of her son’s death. The senators and citizens of Cadmeia city did not accept Dionysos to administer their kingdom. They said that he murdered his own cousin, while not a king. If he became king, he would destroy Boeotia. They appealed to Lycurgus, a wise man, telling him what happened, asking him to take up arms against him and drive him from Cadmeia city and Boeotia. When Dionysos learned this, that Lycurgus has taken arms against him,\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.45 he fled from him, went away to Delphi and died there. The corpse of Dionysos was put in a tomb there, and he hung his weapons in the sanctuary, as the most wise Deinarchus wrote about Dionysos. Likewise the most wise Philochorus wrote this, and in his account said about Dionysos that his tomb can be seen in Delphi beside the golden Apollo. The grave is supposedly a certain pit, at which is written, “Here, having died, lies Dionysos of Semele.” The very wise Cephalion similarly wrote this in his own account.\n\nSo after the death of Cadmus, the King of Boeotia, Nycteus was king. He had a daughter, the priestess of the temple of the Sun, named Antiope. She was taught the solar prayer, or mystagogy of the Dionysiac Bacchanalia, and from that was called Bacche. Her father Nycteus had a brother named Lycus, the king of Argos. This King Lycus had a senator named Theoboos, the son of some Bronton, cousin of Dirce, of the race of Picus Zeus. Theoboos the senator came from Argos by order to sleep in the sanctuary of the Sun. Seeing the priestess Antiope, who was very beautiful and tall, he fell in love with her.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.46 He remained in the sanctuary, on the pretext of a vow, as her relative, seduced her, and made her pregnant. Afraid of Nycteus, the King of Boeotia, he left to his own country. When King Nycteus her father learned that she had been debauched, he took her from the sanctuary. Questioning her, he learned from her that her debaucher was Theoboos, that he was a senator of his brother Lycus and of his wife’s race. Nycteus her father did not know that she was pregnant, and sent her to his brother Lycus, King of Argos, so he too could examine the matter of her debauchery, and if it was true that the debaucher was from Argos, he would punish her as a debauched priestess, and would guard himself against that one, as the sort of person who dared such things against a priestly body. King Lycus brought Antiope in for questioning and saw her beauty. Learning that she was pregnant, he took pity on her, and said it was necessary to wait until she gave birth and then she would be punished for doing violence to her priestly uniform. Lycus’ wife was Dirce, and he gave Antiope to her, telling her to guard her next to herself until she gave birth. King Lycus was Antiope’s uncle. Antiope gave birth to twins, who were called Amphion and Zethus.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.47 At the command of King Lycus, the newborns were thrown away in the village Rasthea near the Cithaeronian mountain. Out of pity, a farmer named Ordion, who was childless, took the babies from the throwers. He recognized that the children were the priestess Antiope’s. For he knew her as a priestess. He raised them. After a time, war stirred for the Argive country, and King Lycus went off to the war. He stayed a long time fighting. Dirce the wife of King Lycus assumed from the fact that he had not yet punished Antiope after the birth, but had let her go, that he was in love with her and having sex with her secretly, since she was very beautiful. Taking her, with a few soldiers, as if to the country, she went to Mt. Cithaeron to the village where her sons had been raised. Dirce didn’t know this. So she took from the place a wild bull, and affixed a torch to its horns. She commanded that Antiope be tied up, and the rope wrapped around the bull’s neck, so that Antiope would be dragged by the bull and killed. When everyone from the estate heard about the death awaiting Antiope, and heard her shrieks, they came from the Dera Goddess, as the place was called. There were many rustics there in the crowd,\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.48 and likewise the two sons of Antiope with them, along with Ordion the farmer who raised them. They begged Dirce not to kill her with such a death. She spoke out to them that she was a priestess of the Sun, and had been debauched and had born two children in harlotry, and it was necessary for her to be punished. The sons of Antiope, Zethus and Amphion, heard from Ordion, who had raised them, that it was there mother who was about to be punished, Antiope. They gathered all the rural population and attacked together. They killed the soldiers, captured Dirce, took the royal ornaments she was wearing, and freed Antiope. Released from her bonds, Antiope permitted her sons Amphion and Zethus to kill Dirce. So they took Dirce and tied her to the same wild bull. Dragged by the bull, she died. Thirsty from being driven, the bull found a spring to drink at. The rope was cut and the corpse of Dirce was left by the spring. So this spring, from that, has been called Dirce until now in that country. Zethus and Amphion took their mother Antiope and left for their country, Boeotia. When they appeared there, they were recognized by the Boeotians. Their grandfather Nycteus, the king of Boeotia, had grown old, fallen ill, and died.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.49 So after the death of King Nycteus, all the Boeotians asked Amphion and Zethus to be king, since they were of the royal lineage of Nycteus. They were proclaimed kings, and the musicians Amphion and Zethus ruled the Boeotian country. Immediately Amphion the lyre-player built a very large city with twelve gates, where there had previously been a village Enchelia. The brothers named the city Thebes for the name of their father, at the command of their mother Antiope. They reigned many years over the Thebes. So the land was called Thebes. King Lycus, the husband of Dirce, their uncle, died in the war. Cephalion wrote this truthfully. The very wise Euripides poetically published a play, that Zeus as a Satyr debauched Antiope, and from that the musicians Zethus and Amphion were born. In accordance with the change of metempsychosis (reincarnation), he said their father Theoboos was descended from Picus Zeus, because Zeus transformed into a Satyr, which in the Boeotian language is another, more worthless body, debauched Antiope. After the reign of Amphion and Zethus, those of their lineage were kings of Thebes until the reign of Oedipus, son of Laius and Jocasta.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.50 This Laius, the King of Thebes, had a son Ioakkas, who was renamed Oedipus as above. It was prophesied that he would have sex with his own mother Jocasta, so he commanded the soldiers around him to take Oedipus into the swamps and to put his feet in carved wood having holes, and to drive nails in the wood. From this was devised what soldiers even today call the cuspus [a torture device]. Having done what he commanded, the soldiers left Oedipus in the swamps, as food for wild animals. A rustic called Meliboeus came to cut wood in the swamp and found in dragging on the ground with his feet swollen. Taking the axe he carried, he broke the wood securing his feet, and took him and raised him. He called his Oedipus from his feet being swollen. He became brave as he grew.\n\nIn that land, a certain widow named Sphinx appeared, ugly, with big, saggy breasts, a peasant. After the loss of her husband, she collected a crowd of like-minded rustic brigands in her village, named Moabe, lying between two mountains with only one narrow road in between. She used to sit on one summit of the mountain with her band of brigands beside her, and she murdered all the passing travelers and merchants and took their things. She became notorious in Thebes. Many generals were sent out with large armies by King Laius,\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.51 but no one was able to prevail due to the strength of the mountains and the number of rustic brigands with whom she shared the belongings of passing foreigners and citizens. When Oedipus grew up, he learned that he was from Thebes. He heard about the woman named Sphinx, the brigandess, who despoiled all those coming from Thebes and oppressed the city. Having thought of a wise way to kill Sphinx, he took brave rustics from the farm where he was raised, claiming that they would become brigands with Sphinx. He went to her and asked if they could be co-brigands. She checked out the appearance of the youth and those with him, and accepted them. He started attacking passers-by. When he found an opportunity when she did not have a crowd of brigands with her, he took a spear and killed her. He took all her possessions, and killed many of those with her, and brought her corpse back to Thebes city, so that he and those with him would collect money from King Laius. All the Theban citizens marveled and sang his praises, and shouted for him to be king of Thebes.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.52 The king was annoyed at those in the city, and sent an army against them. Civil war began, and Laius came out to speak in his own defense. Laius was killed by an arrow someone shot at him. So Jocasta, not wanting to be expelled from the kingship, immediately brought Oedipus and made him king. Learning that he didn’t have a wife, she married him, to appease the citizens and Senate. Oedipus was king of Thebes for 19 years, and neither Jocasta nor Oedipus knew that she was his mother. He had two sons with her, Eteocles and Polyneices, and two daughters, Ismene and Antigone. After some time, Jocasta asked Oedipus where he was from and who his father was. He said Meliboeus, who had raised him. She sent for Meliboeus, who had raised him, and learned from him that he was not his son, but he had found him in the swamps. She asked the year, and realized that he was her son. She told him. Hearing this, Oedipus took nails, stuck them in his eyes, and died, leaving the kingdom to his two sons, after commanding them to be king in alternate years. They fell out over the kingship, waged war on each other, and killed each other in single combat. For Polyneices had been expelled from the kingship and chased out of Thebes by Eteocles, his brother.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.53 He went to Argos and married the daughter of Adrastus, king of Argos. He induced King Adrastus and other kings to come against his brother in Thebes with a large army. The ones he persuaded to mobilize with him were Adrastus, Capaneus, Amphiaraus, Parthenopaeus, Hippomedon. When the two brothers died, as noted above, the kings went back with their armies to their own countries, and the kingship of the Thebans or Boeotians was dissolved, having lasted 368 years. All what is written before was expounded truthfully by the most wise Palaephatus. The most wise Euripides poetically published a play about Oedipus and Jocasta and the Sphinx. The material about the kingdom of Thebes was expounded by Africanus the chronicler.\n\nIn the above-written years, Serouch was born of the tribe of Iapheth. He first initiated the practice of the dogma of Hellenism through idolatry, as Eusebius of Pamphilus wrote.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.54 In the past, warriors, leaders, or those who performed something courageous or virtuous in their life were worthy of being commemorated, especially those who performed mysteries through some power, and as their forefathers they honored them with statues. Everyone used to do proskynesis and sacrifice, honoring them as benefactors to God, because they had discovered a good thing or by art or building or wisdom or whatever other virtues had come to the point of being deified, as the most wise Reginus wrote the names of those deified. People in after times did not know the opinion of their ancestors, that they were honoring them as forefathers and as the inventors of good things, for memory’s sake only. They honored them as heavenly gods and sacrificed to them, not as human-born and mortal and with human feelings. The most wise Diodorus says about them in his writings, that the gods were born human beings, whom men have by custom on account of their benefactions acclaimed as immortal. Some of them were addressed as the ones who held in charge the countries they had ruled. The men who did this were full of ignorance. The form of apotheosis was as follows:\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.55 in their priestly books their names were listed, when they died; at that time they would make a festival and perform a sacrifice to them at the grave monument where they lay, saying that their souls had passed to the Isles of the Blessed and were no longer judged or burned with fire. They stayed that way until the time of Tharra, the father of Abraham. Tharra was a statue-maker, who shaped gods from stone and wood and sold them. He introduced to mankind the error of cult statues and idol-worship, through the depictions of their ancestors, particularly of those who had discovered writing and the arts. The Egyptians, Babylonians, and Phrygians from Greece contributed importantly to this. For they were of this religion. They too were makers of statues and explainers and initiates of mysteries. From them, indeed, this worship was brought to the Hellenes, from someone called Hellen, also a son of Picus Zeus, a man who worked some mysterious things among those living in Hellas. He was from the tribe of Iapheth, the third son of Noah. The Ionians who are from Io became their leader. For they had been taught by Ioaneis the giant who built the tower with the others.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 2.56 For their tongues were divided up, since men are also called Meropes from their speech being divided into many tongues and voices. The Chaeroneian Plutarch reproached them; the old philosophy among the Hellenes and barbarians was exposed as an error of statues that some had introduced. He, they say, seemed to deify the shining lights in the sky, introducing the sun and the moon, as the Egyptian theology has it, administering the whole cosmos, raising and increasing everything in the third movement of the five planets and the remaining star arrangement, in accordance with birth and air. Porphyry praised Plutarch the Chaeroneian in his wisdom-loving chronicle.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 3.57 BOOK 3: Times of the Divine Knowledge of Abraham\n\nAbraham knew divine knowledge (theognosia) and concluded that the statues his father Tharras made were of dead human beings, and it was not necessary to honor them as gods in heaven, when they had become earth and dust. He confronted his father Tharras, saying, “Why do you mislead people for profit? There is no other god, except the one in the heavens, who created all these visible things. He took the statues and broke them all, and went away to Mesopotamia, as Eusebius of Pamphilus the wise chronicler relates. In the years of Abraham, there was a pious man Melchisedek, a gentile, descended from the lineage of Sidus, son of Aegyptus, king of Libya, from whom the Egyptians get their name.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 3.58 This Sidus came from Egypt and took the country from the Canaanite gentiles, the land now called Palestine. He subjugated it and settled there in it. He founded a city he called Sidon for himself, which is now in Phoenicia. So from the lineage of Sidus came Melchi, the father of Sedek, who on becoming priest and king was called Melchisedek, as written previously. He was priest and king of the Canaanites, and founded a city in Mt. Sion, which he called Salem, the city of peace. He was king in it for 113 years. He died just and a virgin, as Josephus relates in the Archaeology. Ioannes and Cyrillus the most blessed bishops say the same thing.\n\nSo from the Flood until Abraham are 893 years, from the tower-making are 523 years. After Abraham and Isaac, his son, and Jacob, his grandson, and their seed, out of which the Hebrews com from the years of Abraham, taking the character of a nation through circumcision. So from Adam until Abraham there are ?745 years.\n\nAbraham was 100 years old when he begot Isaac, and Isaak Jacob called Israel.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 3.59 The Judaeans were called from Judah the fourth son of Jacob. He had 12 sons. The tribe of Judah controlled and administered the Judaeans, whence they took the name.\n\nIn these years, from the tribe of Iapheth, appeared someone named Hesiod, who invented Greek letters and wrote. He was the first to expound letters to the Hellenes.\n\nIn the years of Abraham, Endelechus from the tribe of Shem, the son of Noah, was king over the Assyrians. He was the first to reign after the race of Perseus failed, and the kingship came back to the Assyrians.\n\nThe first king of the Egyptians from the tribe of Ham, the son of Noah, was Pharaoh called Naracho. The most wise Manetho, as mentioned before, related the old kingdoms of the Egyptians before him. The subsequent kingships of the Egyptians, I mean from Naracho on, were written about by Theophilus the most wise chronicler.\n\nIn the years of Abraham, Naracho from the tribe of Ham ruled the Egyptians. Petephres, the chief cook of king Pharaoh, bought from the Saracens Joseph, the son of Jacob. His brothers sold him to the Saracens, envying him because he was his father’s favorite.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 3.60 Joseph was handsome to look at. Joseph interpreted the dream which king Pharaoh had, about a future famine in Egypt and the whole country for seven years. The king marveled at Joseph’s judgment, freed him, and gave him a high rank and the daughter of the high priest of Heliopolis in Egypt for his wife. He ordered him to administer all Egypt for seven years and have power to do what he wished. Joseph built horrea (warehouses) and stored grain in them for the seven years. He supplied everywhere through himself the purchase and sale payment, doing what he wished. When the famine occurred in all the land, his brothers came from Canaan to Egypt to buy grain. Recognizing them, Joseph ordered them to be held. He assured them that he was their brother, and compelled them to go and bring his younger brother Benjamin and his father Jacob and all their clan. The brothers left and brought back their father and brother Benjamin and all their clan, 75 names of males and females. Joseph kept them there, and they lived in Egypt for many years, and a vast crowd of Hebrews came to be dwelling in Egypt,\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 3.61 until Moses was commanded by God to take the people of the Hebrews from the land of Egypt, as all these things are composed accurately in the Hebrew scriptures.\n\nIn the times of the kings previously noted, there arose in Caria a giant-born philosopher from the tribe of Iapheth named Endymion. He made mystic prayers to the Moon, asking to learn from her the divine name in a dream. As he prayed, he fell asleep, and heard the divine name in a dream, and never arose. His remains are in Caria until now, dead but vibrating. Each year they open his grave in that country and see his vibrating dead remains, as they say. The very wise Auleas wrote this, about a man whom, he says, they write stories about the moon falling in love with Endymion.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 3.62 In the years of Jesus son of Naue of the tribe of Iapheth, someone named Ogyges, an autochthon, was king of the Attic land, for 32 years. A great cataclysm took place in his reign, and he and that whole country were destroyed, and every soul dwelling in the country of Attica alone. The land remained from then desert and uninhabited for 260 years, as is reported in the writings of Africanus.\n\nIn the days when the exodus from Egypt of the sons of Israel with Moses was about to happen, an autochthon named Aides was the king of the Molossian country. He married Melindia, and had with her a beautiful daughter they called Persephone. The Molossaians call beautiful women Kore in their language. Perithous, a senator of King Aides, younger and wealthy, seemed to love her passionately. By arrangement with the Kore he wanted to kidnap her at night. Learning this, King Aides was angry. Taking counsel in secret to defend himself from Perithous, so that he could use ignorance as an excuse to everyone. He had a huge wild shepherd dog, named Tricerberus because it had the head and body size of three dogs, and he shut it outside where the Kore was staying. So after the death of her mother, with Kore unaware of this, Perithous showed up at night and came in to kidnap the Kore. The dog attacked and killed him. When the girl heard the disturbance, she went out and the dog killed her too. They claim it is said about her that Plouton snatched the Kore. This is what the most wise Palaephatus wrote.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 3.63 In the years of Moses, Erechtheus was king of the Assyrians, and Petissionios king of the Egyptians, the comic-poet pharaoh. He had powerful magi with him, Iannes and Iambres. In his reign, to race of the Jews in Egypt was multiplied, from the generation of Jacob, who came to Egypt, to his son Joseph, until Moses their leader and Aaron his brother. Moses took an Egyptian woman, the daughter of Iothor, the high priest of the Hellenes, a man honored by King Pharaoh and the Egyptians. Moses was trained in all the wisdom of Egypt. The Egyptians feared the Jews, since they had become numerous, and complained to Pharaoh about them. King Pharaoh ordered the Jews to labor for the Egyptians and to make bricks by compulsion. If any Egyptian wanted to build a house or farm, he compelled them to do labor and make bricks, and all the Judaeans sighed with weariness. Moses and his brother Aaron noticed the sighs of the sons of Israel, and prayed to God. The Lord God commanded Moses to go to King Pharaoh of Egypt and tell him, “Release the people of Israel to serve him.”\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 3.64 Moses took his brother Aaron and went to Petissonios Pharaoh, King of Egypt. He had the right to speak freely, as the son in law of Iothor, the priest of the Hellenes, and as leader of the Judaeans. He announced to him God’s command, and said that the God who made the earth and land and sea and everything in them said to release his people to serve him. Pharaoh heard this and told him, “If it is true that your god commanded you to tell me this, Look, there are Egyptians with me who perform miracles. If you defeat them by asking your god, I will grant to you what he commanded you to say.” He set opposite one another Iannes and Iambres and Moses and Aaron. Pharaoh and his nobles sat down. Ioannes and Iambres through a charm made their staff a snake, and it attacked Moses. Praying, Moses through down the staff he held on the ground. It too became a very large snake, which swallowed the snake Iannes and Iambres had made. So Moses won, and the King and everyone marveled. Similarly, Iannes and Iambres made a river of very transparent water to become blood, in the presence of the King and everyone. Moses prayed, and it became pure water from the flows of the river, as before. They did some other things against each other, and Moses defeated them.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 3.65 Moses said to Pharaoh, Behold! You see the power of the God Israel. Let us go, so that we may serve him. Pharaoh put off doing what he agreed. Moses prayed for God to send blows against the Egyptians, so their king would be compelled to let Israel go. The God Israel send a seven-blow anger, so the king would beg Moses and say to him, “Pray to your God to free the country from such evils, and may your God live as Lord. I will not hinder you from taking your people Israel to serve him.” This is contained in the Hebrew scriptures. Moses heard this from the King, and went out to pray to God Israel, and he said to the Judaeans, “The King has freed you all to go serve God.” Petissonios Pharaoh the king immediately went to Memphis to the celebrated oracle. He sacrificed and asked the Pythia, saying, “Clarify for me who is the first of you, the great God of Israel?” This oracle was given to him: “There is descended from the great sky a flame, an exceeding clear, ever-flowing, immortal fire, which trembles all, sky, earth, sea, and Tartarus-dwelling daemons of the depths shuddered.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 3.66 This self-fathered, unfathered God, Father Son himself of himself, thrice-blessed. We in one small part of the angels. Learn and go away in silence.”\n\nKing Pharaoh heard this from the oracle, and commanded that the words given to him in the prophecy be carved on a stone plaque. Until now these word remain written, carved on the plaque in the sanctuary of Memphis, where the Nile river flows. King Pharaoh returned from the oracle and immediately let Israel and Moses and Aaron go. All the people of the Judaeans left Egypt, and they took trappings (jewelry?) as were in use among Egyptian women and men and abundant silver. After they left, Pharaoh the King of Egypt repented his decision, on learning that they had borrowed trappings and silver and money and departed. He pursued them with his chariots and all his armed force. He reached them by the sea. The Israelites turned and saw king Pharaoh and his army coming behind them and the sea in front of them, and they raised a great cry to God. Moses who was going ahead leading the people struck the sea water with his staff and it became dry, and they walked on. Moses remained behind his whole people and turning back, he again struck the dry land with his staff, and it became sea tossing with waves.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 3.67 Petissonios pharaoh, the king of the Egyptians, was drowned in the sea, with his chariots and all his forces, and the waves of the sea covered him and those with him. The Lord saved the people of the Judaeans with Moses and Aaron, walking on the waves of the sea as on dry land, fleeing out of Egypt with 630,000, as Moses wrote in his very wise chronicle.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.68 BOOK 4 The times of the Kingdom of the Argive Country\n\nAfter Inachus, Phoroneus was king of the Argives, and many others, until the reign of Lynceus who married Hypermnestra, one of the daughters of Danaos. This Lynceus fought with King Danaos, killed him, and took the kingdom and his daughter, as the most wise Archilochus has written. After the reign of Lynceus, Triopas was king in the Argive land for five years. In the fifth year of his reign, the Argive kingdom was dissolved, and the Sicyonians possessed their kingdom. The kingdom or toparchia of the Argives lasted 549 years, as the most wise Diodoros has written. The first to reign over the Sicyonians, now called Helladics, was Aegialeus, for 52 years,\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.69 and there were another 26 kings until Zeuxippus, who reigned over them 32 years. Then their priests administered the country. Their kingdom lasted 985 years, as the very wise Africanus has written.\n\nThe west, the lands toward Italy, were then without a king, but administered by the sons of Picus and/or Zeus and their lineage. In those years, Moses and Aaron died in the desert, and Jesus the son of Naue administered Israel, as was said before. He waged war and captured Jericho and the above-mentioned city of Jerusalem, which Jesus son of Nave renamed Jebun. He captured the country and settled the city Sychem, renaming it Neapolis. After the death of Jesus son of Nave, who made the Jewish people cross the Jordan river by God’s command and come to Palestine, and who destroyed the walls of Jericho with a mystic trumpet, after him Phineas led Israel. After Phineas, 13 judges chosen by the people administered Israel.\n\nIn these years there were among the Hellenes Prometheus, Epimetheus, Atlas, and all-seeing Argus called the hundred-eyed because he was looked at by all sides, and was fierce,\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.70 and Deucalion, the son of Hellen son of Picus. Argus discovered craftsmanship in the western parts; Atlas interpreted Astronomy. This is why they say he holds up the sky, because he has heavenly matters in his heart. Prometheus discovered grammatical philosophy; about him they say that he shaped mankind, because to the extent they were ignoramuses, he made them to know the events of former times through philosophy. Epimetheus discovered music. Deucalion reported the events of the partial flood, as the most wise Eusebius of Pamphilus wrote.\n\nAfter the judges of the Judaeans died, Barach the son of Abinoem led the people. There was a woman prophet Debbora, who told the future to the Judaeans.\n\nIn those times there was a prophetess among the Greeks, Sibyl. In those years, the King of the Egyptians was Pharaoh or Naracho. A certain Cecrops was king of the Athenians, who was Egyptian by descent. He was completely huge, so they also called him double natured. He was the first king of the Athenians after the flood of Attica. The capital came to the Athenians after the flood of Attica.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.71 As soon as he became king of the Athenians, Cecrops commanded that a law be passed that the women who were under his rule be married as virgins to one man. He call them nymphs in this legislation because virgin girls were like wellsprings, who give birth and produce milk from unseen resources. Before his reign, all the women of Attica, both the Athenians and the nearby country, used to have intercourse with a bestial mixing, having sex with each man who was attracted to them, if she too wanted it. A woman who was kidnapped was called the wife of no one, but would have sex with everyone, and they gave themselves to harlotry. Someone would keep as many women as he wished in those days, and would send her away again to whomever wanted her. This was barred from Attica, not to be compelled to have sex with the man they wanted. So no one knew whose son or daughter they were; once born, the child was given to whatever man she wanted of those who had slept with her, whether the child was male or female, and the men were happy to accept them. Cecrops was of Egyptian origin, and pronounced this law. He said that Attica was being ruined by this, and henceforth all the women started behaving properly, and the unmarried virgins yoked themselves to men, and she who had been a harlot married a man she wanted. The Athenians marveled at the King’s law. As some have expressed it, it was on account of this that the Athenians called him two-natured, because he ennobled the children because they knew their parents. Cecrops ruled the Athenians 50 years,\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.72 and after him Cranaus was king for nine years. In those years, Sappho became known as the first musician. After Cranaus, Phoroneus and others were kings, until Codrus, who reigned over them for 25 years. So their kingdom lasted 492 years.\n\nIn the years of the Archons, the first to make laws for the Athenians was named Draco, and after him Solon, and Solon abolished the laws of Draco. And again, Thales the Milesian made laws. First Aeschylus was king over them again, for 25 years, and after Aeschylus their king was Acmaeon for two years. The most wise Euripides published a play about him. After Acmaeon, there were 15 other kings until Arexion, who ruled them for 12 years. The kingdom of the Athenians was dissolved after lasting 907 years, as the most wise chronicler Africanus published.\n\nSoon after, Gideon was leader of Israel. In that year was Orpheus the Thracian, the lyric Odrysian, the most wise and famous poet. He expounded theogony and the founding of the cosmos and the shaping of human beings. He said in the beginning of his composition that he was not expounding anything from his own ideas regarding god or cosmic foundations,\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.73 but said he had asked in prayer to learn the theogony and founding of the cosmos and who made it from the Titan Phoebus, the sun. It is contained in his exposition in poetic verses as follows:\n\nO Lord, son of Leto, far-shooter, mighty Phoebus,\n\nO Master, son of the day, who from afar shoots everything with your rays, Undefiled and powerful\n\nAll-seeing, lording over mortals and immortals,\n\nOverseeing everything, reigning over mortals and immortals.\n\nSun rising on golden wings,\n\nSun raised in the air on honorable wings,\n\nI heard this twelfth utterance from you,\n\nthis twelfth divine voice I heard from you\n\nSaid by you, far-shooter, divine witness.\n\nYou having told me, you who shine from afar,\n\nOrpheus spoke many other verses about this. He expressed it as he expounded it in the above poetic verses. It wasn’t possible to include in this composition (of mine) the full number of verses.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.74 This is what Orpheus expounded: That from the beginning the aether created by God was displayed to time, and on this side and that side of the aether was chaos, and gloomy night held everything and covered what was under the aether, signifying that the night was first. He said in the same exposition that there is something incomprehensible, and above everything, and earlier, and the creator of all things, and of aether and night and everything under the aether and the covered creation. He said the earth was invisible under the darkness. He expressed that the light shattered the aether and illuminated the earth and all creation, and said the aforementioned light that shattered the aether was supreme over everything. Orpheus heard its name in a prophesy and declared it, Metis, Phanes, Epicepaeus. Which are translated in the common language, Counsel (Boule), Light, Life-giver. He said in the same exposition that the three divine powers of the name are one power and the might of the only God, whom no one sees, of whose power no one can know the idea or nature. From this power all things came to be: the bodiless authorities and the sun and moon, the offices (exousies) and all the stars and earth and sea, and all the visible and invisible things in them.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.75 He said the race of men was formed by God from earth and took a logical soul from him, as the all-wise Moses expounded. Orpheus in his book wrote that through the three names, of one godhead, everything came to be, and it is everything.\n\nConcerning the suffering race of human beings, Orpheus expounded many verses poetically, some of which are as follows:\n\n“Beasts and birds the sinful tribes of mortals.” Translation: Beasts and birds, the squandered nations of mankind.\n\n”Burdens to the earth, manufactured phantoms, not for nothing…” Translation: The weight of the earth, a constructed species, not knowing for what they were born, nor for what they die.\n\n“Nor knowing how to take thought for coming evil.” Translation: Not perceiving the evil coming against them.\n\nShrewd, not even which evil to avert to safeguard themselves… Nor from very far away to avert from evil\n\nNor of present good to turn toward and fence in.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.76 [Translation:] Nor of coming good to divert from evil and keep good.\n\nSkilful, but in vain, ignorant, improvident. [Translation:] Experienced, but randomly, behaving ignorantly, foreseeing nothing.\n\nThis very wise Orpheus expounded many other verses. The very wise chronicler Timotheus published them all, saying that Orpheus, so many years ago, had said the homoousios Trinity created everything.\n\nAfter Gideon, Tholas was leader of Israel. In the times of Tholas, there was in Phrygia Marsyas the philosopher, who discovered flutes and reeds for music. He lost his good sense, and deified himself, saying “I have found nourishment for mankind through the melody of musical reads. Marsyas lived on his farm the whole time. Having incurred God’s wrath, he lost his senses and threw himself into the river and died. This river the people of that country call Marsyas until now. The poets tell about him that he came in conflict with Apollo. They say this, it is said, because having committed blasphemy he lost his mind and was killed, which is what the most wise Ninus wrote.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.77 The most wise Lucian records the following story. He said it is from Colchis. It was during the times of Tholas [Tola] that Herakles the hero, and the Argonauts with Jason the Thessalian, and Castor and Polydeuces and Hylas and Telamon and the rest were ascending the Hellespont. They were attacked suddenly by Cyzicus the king of the Hellespont. They clashed in a sea battle and killed King Cyzicus. Attacking at night, they captured Cyzicus the metropolis of the Hellespont province. When they learned from the citizens and senators that it was Cyzicus they had killed, they mourned him, because he was a relative of theirs and had brought his clan from their country. They asked forgiveness for the mutual ignorance, explained their actions to them, and founded a sanctuary in the city of Cyzicus after the victory. Then the Argonauts went to the oracle which is called the Pythia Therma [Pythian hot waters]. After sacrificing they asked, “Prophesy to us, prophet, Titan, Phoebus Apollo, whose house is this, and what will it be?” The following answer was given them by the Pythia: “Do what summons you to virtue and order (πρὸς ἀρετὴν καὶ κόσμον). I ordain you to fear a single high-ruling god, whose imperishable logos will become pregnant in an unknowing girl, and he will sweep through the whole world like a bow of fire giving life and bring a gift to the Father. Hers shall be the house, Maria her name.”\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.78 The heroes wrote the oracle on stone, marble, with bronze letters, and put it above the doorway of the temple, and called it the house of Rhea, mother of the gods. Many years later, under King Zeno, this house became a church of the holy Theotokos Maria.\n\nThe Argonauts set forth from the Hellespont and sailed for the Princess Islands. From there they set their course for Chalcedon, hoping to sail up to the Pontic Sea. Again they were attacked, by Amycus. Afraid of his power, they took refuge in a gulf, thickly wooded and wild. Then they saw in a vision a host driving toward them as if from heaven, and a fearsome man with wings on his shoulders like an eagle's, and he prophesied their victory over Amycus. Encouraged, they attacked Amycus and defeated him. Giving thanks, they built a sanctuary where they had seen the host, and they erected there a stamped image of the host they had seen. They called the place and the sanctuary Sosthenes, because they were saved after fleeing there. The place is called this up to the present.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.79 After Byzantium became the capital, the great King Constantine came to secure the area and saw the sanctuary. He had become a Christian. Noticing the stamped image on the stele standing there, he said it was the sign in the shape of a solitary angel from the Christian faith. Struck by the place and the building, he prayed to learn what was the power of the stamped image of the angel and lay down to sleep there. In a dream, he heard the name of the power, and immediately roused up and adorned the place, making a prayer toward the east. He named the prayer-hall after the archangel St. Michael.\n\nAfter the victory over Amycus, the Argonauts set out from there on the Pontic sea for the Golden Fleece. They took it, and Medeia as well, the daughter of Aetes the king of Scythia, from the land of Colchis. The rest, about Jason and Glauce the daughter of Creon the king of Thessaly, who was burned up together with her father by some mischance at her wedding, was recorded by the very wise historian Apollonius.\n\nAfter Tholas, Aeglon [Elon] the Zebulonite ruled Israel. In those years the Hellenes had another prophetess, the Erythraean Sibyl. Troos ruled over Phrygia in those times, the father of Ilios and Ganymedes. He built two cities, Troy in his own name and Ilion named for his older son.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.80 He completed the city walls and invited all the toparchs and reigning kings of Europe except Tantalus the king of the Mycenaean country. Tantalus was aggrieved at this, and bore a grudge against him. Before beginning to build the cities, Troos had offered to send gifts and make sacrifices in the sanctuary of Zeus in Europe. When he finished the walls after two years, he sent his younger brother, the one called Ganymede, whom he loved, being younger and handsome, to bring the gifts to the sanctuary of Zeus and fulfill the allotted sacrifice. He gave him 50 men. He crossed over the sea and went to the sanctuary of Zeus. Tantalus learned this and thought he had come to spy on Europe. He sent many armed men and caught Ganymede and those with him before they arrived at the sanctuary. Ganymede fell ill, due to his fearfulness. Tantalus questioned him: “How dare you come as a spy to other people’s kingdoms?” He told him “I and my companions came to sacrifice to Zeus.” Learning this, Tantalus ordered him to wait and recover from the illness. After being ill for three days, Ganymede died. Tantalus ordered that the gifts and sacrifice he brought be given over to the sanctuary of Zeus, and that the body of Ganymede be place in the temple of Zeus as an honor.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.81 Those who were sent with him made a tomb for him, and placed him in it with this inscription: “Troos, King of Asia, dedicates to Zeus his son Ganymede, who lies here, with the sacrifice.” Tantalus did this as a divine service for his father, for it was not the custom of the Greeks to bury the corpse of a mortal man inside a sacred house, so as not to defile the divine. The most wise Didymus the historian chronicler wrote this. Some say that Ganymede was snatched by an eagle, because this event was more painful than death.\n\nAfter Troos, Ilios was king of the Phrygians. In that time, the victory in the contest of Pelops the Lydian and Oenomaus the Pisaean, accomplished during the solar festival, was the talk of everyone. Charax the historian wrote about this.\n\nAfter these years, Sampson, a brave man, a mystic and miracle-worker, was the judge and leader of Israel, as is reported in Hebrew scripture. In those years, Lapathus was king of Egypt. He had two sons, Achaus and Lacon. When he was about to die he ordered his two sons to divide his king and the country in two.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.82 Achaus, after his father’s death, divided the country in two and gave half of it to his brother Lacon from their paternal kingdom. He called the country he ruled by his own name, Laconike. Lacon ruled for 33 years, and built a city Githillia [Gythion?] on the shore. After him there were many other kings of the Laconians until the reign of Thestius, king of the Laconians, who built a city Thestia by the river Eurotas. Thestius had three daughters, beautiful beyond exaggeration, Leda, Clytia, and Melanippe, who as time passed were called Laconides. Her father Thestius gave Leda in marriage to someone named Tyndarius, who ruled the Laconian land after the death of Thestius. This Tyndarus had a daughter by Leda named Clytemnestra. When she grew up, Agamemnon the King of the land of the Mycenaeans married her. She was a slut and committed adultery with a young senator named Cycnus, the son of Ederion, king of Achaea, who was descended from Picus Zeus, while Tyndarius, Leda’s husband, was unaware of the adultery. Leda fornicated up high in a suburb beside the Eurotas river. She became pregnant by Cycnus the adulterer, the son of King Ederion, and gave birth to triplets, Castor, Polydeuces, and Helene.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.83 Helene was terribly beautiful, and Tyndarius afterwards gave her in marriage to Menelaus, the king of the Argives and companion of Agamemnon, as the most wise Palaephatus writes, that the poets idly recount this in poetic terms, saying the Zeus became a swan (kyknos) and shamed Leda.\n\nDuring the time of Sampson, Dardanus the son of Ilios ruled the Phrygian country.\n\nIn these years, the king of the Hellenes, that is of Hellas, was someone named Abas, for 23 years. After him, Proetus ruled 17 years. His wife Stheneboea or Anteia loved Bellerophontes. She sent messengers to him, but he didn’t agree, saying, “King Proetus found me on lying on the ground in front of his palace and raised me and thought me worthy to eat with him, honoring me like a son. So I should do something like this against him? This is not lawful for Hellenes.” Stheneboea heard this and thought, maybe, since he speaks freely to him, like a son, he will tell him that she was in love with him and had sent people to him. Secretly she told her husband, “Bellerophontes is in love with me and comes for me, and I am afraid that he will give me poison and I will die, because I keep my self-restraint for you as someone who loves her husband.”\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.84 So Proetus told her, “The law for the Greeks is not to harm someone you eat with. So I will send him to your father Iobates, someone he has never eaten with, and will write asking him to kill him for plotting against my kingdom and yours.” He did this and gave him a letter stamped with the royal seal. Bellerophontes took the letter, not knowing the plot against him, and went to King Iobates, and found him at breakfast. When Iobates learned that he had come, he summoned him as someone dear to his son-in-law Proetus, and ordered him to eat with him, like a son. When he accepted the letters and read what was written, and realized that they had eaten together, he said to himself, that this man is accused rather, but if he were planning something evil, justice would not have made him eat with me, since the law for the Greeks is not to harm the person you eat with. He wrote this to his son-in-law and the rest is as Euripides the tragic poet wrote, fulfilling the play.\n\nAfter the reign of Proetus, the second Acrisius was king for 31 years, and after the victory against Oenomaus, Pelops was king for 32 years, from whom the Helladics were called Peloponnesians. He built a city, which he called Peloponnesos. From then on, the kingdom of Hellas was also called Peloponnese.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.85 In these years, Democritus taught philosophical things. In his philosophical writing he wrote this, that someone who wanted to be a philosopher must practice self-restraint, must abstain from all evils, always think and do properly. When someone philosophizes in this way, then he will learn the nine-letter name and will see the Son of God, the Impassible Word, the suffering one, the one about to appear. This is treated in the composition of Theophilus the most wise chronicler.\n\nIn these years Hippocrates used to philosophize, expounding medical philosophy.\n\nAfter the reign of Pelops, Atreus was king for 20 years, and after him Thyestes for 16 years, and after him Agamemnon for 18 years, and after him Aegisthus for 7 years. The kingdom of the Hellenes or Peloponnesians lasted 174 years.\n\nIn the above-mentioned years, first Minoos was king of Crete, the son of Europa. He ruled the seas, after waging war on the Athenians, and established laws. The most wise Plato, they say, wrote about him in his memoranda on the laws.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.86 Daedalus and Icarus were in those years, famous because of Pasiphae, the wife of King Minoos, and Taurus her clerk. In adultery with him, she bore a son called Minotaur, with Daedalus and Icarus the intermediaries in her prostituting herself. King Minoos shut up Pasiphae in the bedroom with two slave girls to bring her food, and he left her there and no longer saw her. Depressed at the loss of her royal status, she was struck by illness and died. Daedalus and Icarus were killed. Icarus escaped the guard, but sank while sailing, while Daedalus had his throat cut. Euripides the poet published a play about Pasiphae.\n\nIn those years Herakles the mystic initiate performed labors. He went to Libya and fought with Antaeus, who was also a mystic doing Earth-related things. Herakles defeated and killed him. Herakles was struck by illness after the victory, and threw himself into a fire and died, concerning which the most wise Didymus has written. After Dardanus, his son Laomedon ruled over Ilion.\n\nAfter Sampson, Eli the priest ruled over Israel.\n\nIn the above years, Androgeus the son of Pasiphae and Minoos, the king of Crete, died.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.87 Minoos himself likewise died. When about to die, he commanded that the Minotaur be king of Crete. After his death, the Minotaur ruled Crete, the son of Pasiphae and Taurus her clerk. Considering it an insult to be ruled by the Minotaur, the child of adultery, the Senate plotted against him and incited Theseus, since he was brave, the son of Aegeus the king of Thessaly, to fight him. They agreed to betray the Minotaur and the whole country, and to give him as his wife the sister, Ariadne, the daughter of Pasiphae and King Minoos – he had from Pasiphae and Minoos Androgeus and Ariadne. Theseus came to Crete suddenly against him, and all the senators and the army left the Minotaur and decided to flee the city Gortyn. Learning of their treachery, the Minotaur fled into the Labyrinth country. He went up a mountain and entered a cave to hide. Chasing him, Theseus learned from someone where he was hiding. He ejected him and killed him immediately. Entering Gortyn, he celebrated a triumph for his victory over the Minotaur. He was acclaimed by the senators and the whole country. He asked to go back to Aegeus his father in order to celebrate a triumph for his victory with him too. Before he sailed to his father, some sailor went and told King Aegeus, Theseus’ father,\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.88 that the Minotaur had escaped from the city. He assumed that the Cretans had made a deception. So he said this about them, “Cretans are always liars,” and threw himself in the sea and died. Theseus came and found him dead, and was persuaded by his own Senate to spurn the kingdom of Crete and Ariadne and rule his father’s Thessaly. He brought a wife Ilia called Phaedra. Ariadne went into the sanctuary of Zeus and remained a virgin priestess, until she died.\n\nIn those years, the lying desire of Phaedra for Hippolytus her stepson, son of Theseus by a concubine, became widely known. The very wise Euripides wrote a poetic play about her afterwards. The events regarding Phaedra took place 52 years after the death of Pasiphae, as the most wise chronicler Domninus noted. Phaedra was perfect in appearance, well-dressed, long-faced, proper. Hippolytus was perfect in appearance, muscular, dark-complected, short-haired, a bit snub-nosed, flat-faced, with big teeth, sparse-bearded, a hunter, calm and proper. King Theseus heard what was widely known in the city about his wife Ilia Phaedra, and was unhappy with her. Though angry at his son Hippolytus, he didn’t show it to them.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.89 He took a white bull and gave it as a sacrifice to Poseidon, cursing his son Hippolytus and asking that he died unpleasantly. After three months it happened. As Hippolytus went out hunting on horseback to chase a wild boar, his horse stumbled, and he was unseated and fell on the ground, his left hand still holding the horse’s bridle. The strap got wrapped around his arm, and he was dragged by the horse. Wounded in the head, he was brought by the slaves to the city and the palace. On the sixth day after the head wound he died, age 22. King Theseus mourned him and spoke out to Phaedra about his grief, reproaching her. He told her what was talked about in the city and country regarding Hippolytus and her. Phaedra heard this and admitted that she did not know any such thing, but the people of the city had wrongly suspected her in spreading this abuse. Theseus did not believe her, but ashamed, including before the Senate, put her out of his sight and commanded that he never see her. He was sorry for the death of his son, whom he loved. Phaedra, as a very proper person, was distraught at the false accusation from the city and country, and ashamed at being putting away by her husband. She did away with herself, and died age 39, as the very wise Kephalion wrote, saying they falsely mythologized about the proper Phaedra, her desire for Hippolytus, shaping the story about her poetically.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 4.90 In those years, first Eurystheus was king of the Lacedaemonians for 32 years. There were eight other kings after him, altogether reigning for 246 years. And Alkmainos 37 years. The Kingdom of the Lacedaemonians lasted 325 years in all, as the most wise Africanus wrote.\n\nAfter Eli the prophet of the Judaeans, the first king of the Judaeans was Saul, the son of Kis, from the tribe of Benjamin, for 20 years, in the city Gabaon. Of the Corinthians after the Lacedaemonians, Aletes was king then for 35 years. Another 11 kings, 267 years. Last, […] ruled, for one year. The kingdom of the Corinthians lasted in all 313 years.\n\nIn the years of Saul, the Pisaeans first thought up the Olympic competition, and celebrated the secular festival of Olympian Zeus, about which the most wise Africanus has chronicled. In this time, Samuel the prophet was the priest of the Judaeans. He put forward by God’s command King David of the Judaean nation, the son of Jesse.\n\nEvent Date: -1000\n\n§ 5.91 BOOK 5 TROJAN TIMES\n\nIn the times of David, Priam "
