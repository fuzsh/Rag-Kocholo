        "text": "Isonoe, also known as Jupiter XXVI, is a retrograde, irregular natural satellite belonging to the outer planet of Jupiter. This satellite was discovered by Scott S. Sheppard, Yanga R. Fernandez, David C. Jewett, and Eugene A. Magnier on November 23, 2000 at the Mauna Kea Observatory. This satellite belongs to the Carme group, a group of retrograde irregular satellites that orbit the Jovian.\n\nFormation[]\n\nIt is believed that a D-type asteroid, from the Hilda family or Jupiter Trojans, went stray into deep space. After being pulled into Jupiter's gravitational pull, it suffered numerous collisions. The leftover debris became the other sixteen satellites of the Carme group, with Carme being the largest. It is believed that Isonoe is one of these fragments.\n\nSurface[]\n\nAll of the moons in the Carme group are red, with Kalyke being notably redder than the others.\n\nGallery[]"
