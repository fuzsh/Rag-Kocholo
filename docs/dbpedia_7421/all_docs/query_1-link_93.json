        "text": "So you know your Sun sign and Moon sign and are well on your way to being able to astrologically analyze everyone from your mom to your coworkers. But did you know that the phase the Moon was in when you were born can also speak to some of your personality traits? The fun *really* never ends with astrology!\n\nHow to find what phase of the Moon you were born under\n\nThere are two ways to figure out which phase of the Moon you were born under. The first and easiest way is to enter your birth time, date, and location into a free birth chart calculator that includes Moon phases, like this one from Astro-Seek or .\n\nIf you want to do it yourself, get ready for some math. Pull up your birth chart and take a look at the degrees of your Sun sign and Moon sign. Then count how many degrees the Moon is from the Sun. (FYI, each sign represents 30 degrees in the zodiac.) Let’s say you’re a Virgo Sun at 0 degrees and you’re also a Sagittarius Moon at 0 degrees. That’s 30 degrees for all of Virgo plus another 30 each for Libra and Scorpio, for a total of 90 degrees. Then check this list for where your Moon sign is relative to your Sun sign:\n\n0 to 45 degrees from the Sun: New Moon\n\n45 to 90 degrees from the Sun: Waxing Crescent Moon\n\n90 to 135 degrees from the Sun: First Quarter Moon\n\n135 to 180 degrees from the Sun: Waxing Gibbous Moon\n\n180 to 225 degrees from the Sun: Full Moon\n\n225 to 270 degrees from the Sun: Waning Crescent Moon\n\n270 to 315 degrees from the Sun: Third Quarter Moon\n\n315 to 360 degrees from the Sun: Waning Gibbous Moon\n\nFound your Moon phase? Okay, here’s what it means:\n\nNew Moon\n\nThe New Moon begins when the Sun and Moon are in the same zodiac sign. It’s always darkest during the New Moon, when the Moon lines up between the Earth and the Sun. Very ~mysterious~, right?\n\nMany people born under the New Moon have strong intuition. You learn how to listen to yourself and your instincts, as there was no guiding light present when you were born. This energy can make you self-reliant and just a little headstrong. New Moons represent new beginnings or the start of a journey—you’re here to embrace new experiences and opportunities. People born under this Moon phase generally have a lot of enthusiasm but need help with the follow-through.\n\nWaxing Crescent Moon\n\nAfter the New Moon plants seeds and new beginnings, the Waxing Crescent Moon phase begins to create structure and turn those ideas into something tangible. A Waxing Crescent Moon is the first step toward the Full Moon, and although it’s still mostly dark, the Moon is once again gaining light.\n\nPeople born under this Moon phase tend to have a natural sense of positivity and the ability to have faith even in troubling or trying times. This is one motivated placement, and you can feel increased pressure to do or to create. People born under the Waxing Crescent Moon charge ahead with focused energy and curiosity.\n\nFirst Quarter Moon\n\nHello, growing pains! A First Quarter Moon is halfway between a New Moon and a Full Moon, and half the Moon’s face can be seen in the sky. We’ve planted our seeds and they’re sprouting above ground, but now what?\n\nPeople born under the First Quarter Moon can feel like they’re in an ongoing crisis point. You have an increased desire to make a name for yourself—you feel a need to prove yourself to your parents and others around you. In this phase, the Sun and the Moon form an angle called a square to one another—which, in astrology, increases ~tension~. People born during this phase feel this natural tension, which causes you to take action and remain motivated no matter what. Your determination is next-level.\n\nWaxing Gibbous Moon\n\nAs the Moon continues to gain in light and clarity, it forms a Waxing Gibbous Moon. During this phase, three-quarters of the Moon’s face is illuminated, and we’re getting closer to a Full Moon. This phase is linked to a deeper understanding of planning and preparation.\n\nDuring the Waxing Gibbous Moon, the light from the Moon allows for some deeper introspection—people born during this phase know how to see more of themselves. This Moon phase also encourages individual development and growth. If you were born under a Waxing Gibbous Moon, you may find yourself developing many different skills throughout your life, especially through mentorship.\n\nFull Moon\n\nHello, angel, you’re meant to shine! If you were born under a Full Moon, your seeds have bloomed into full-blown stunning flowers or an adorable houseplant. During this phase, the Sun and Moon sit opposite one another in the sky, bringing an intense focus on relationships and partnerships.\n\nFull Moon babies can develop and learn most about themselves through relationships—romantic, platonic, and even family relationships. This Moon phase also brings some tension with it, as you have to learn to delicately balance two opposing sides to your personality. You may often be drawn to people very different from you, which in turn spurs more growth.\n\nWaning Gibbous Moon\n\nThe Moon may now be losing light, but that doesn’t mean this Moon phase doesn’t have a lot to offer. During a Waning Gibbous Moon, the Full Moon’s light has begun to fade and the Moon is on its way toward becoming a New Moon again.\n\nThe Waning Gibbous Moon is all about spreading information and giving back to others. People born under this Moon phase are eager to share life lessons and inspiration with others. This Moon phase embodies the teacher, and if you were born during this phase, you have an intuitive wisdom.\n\nLast Quarter Moon\n\nAh, the Last Quarter Moon. We’ve reached our final point of tension. The Sun and Moon are again in a tense square aspect, but this time, the Moon is losing its light rather than gaining it. This Moon phase embodies a turning point later in life—a dramatic shift in personality and perspective.\n\nIf you were born under this phase, you may find that your journey leads you to shed what you once knew as you head off in a new direction, which can leave many of your closest loved ones confused. Your intuition leads you somewhere new, course-correcting your fate.\n\nWaning Crescent Moon\n\nThe Moon now has just a little light left, and we’re very close to a New Moon. As the light dwindles and darkness creeps in, this phase requires solitude for recharging and processing.\n\nPeople born under this Moon phase feel a strong pull toward endings throughout their lives. This can be a very karmic placement, wrapping up old stories from past lives. It can feel emotionally heavy, but you’re clearing the path for a fresh start. This is an incredibly spiritual placement that has a strong intuition, is resilient beyond belief, and has the urge to transform.\n\nAnd what about your Moon sign?\n\nOf course, the zodiac sign the Moon was in says a lot about you, too! In astrology, your Moon sign says a lot about your emotional inner world, as well as your relationships. Here's a bit more about the personality traits for each Moon sign.\n\nAries Moon\n\nYour emotions are fast-moving and strong! You're a natural leader and you're very independent. When you fall for someone, you tend to fall hard and fast...and you might move on just as quickly. You also have a bit of a temper, and can act a little immature when you don't get your way.\n\nTaurus Moon\n\n\"Slow and steady\" is your motto. You're usually calm and level-headed, but when something or someone gets you angry, watch out! You're extremely stubborn and yo know how to hold a grudge. In relationships, you value stability and security, and you like to stay cozy and comfy at home.\n\nGemini Moon\n\nYour word is change. Your emotions and thoughts are always moving and changing, and your interest can flit from person to person and subject to subject like *that*. This makes you playful, curious, and a ton of fun to be around, but it means that long-term relationships might be just a bit, well, boring to you.\n\nCancer Moon\n\nCancer is ruled by the Moon, so you are *super* in touch with your emotions... some would say a little *too* in touch. You're very sensitive, as well as intuitive. You're incredibly caring and nurturing with romantic partners, as well as your friend and family. You crave security and are a natural in LTRs, plus you probably have some friends you've known since kindergarten.\n\nLeo Moon\n\nYou love the spotlight and big displays of affection. You're generous and caring with your friends and fan, and you thrive as part of a power couple. You have a stubborn streak and you like to call the shots. You thrive when you can be creative...bonus points if you have an audience cheering you on.\n\nVirgo Moon\n\nYou deal with your emotions in a very logical way, analyzing and processing them and likely even recoding them so you can go back and track your mood changes. You're incredibly caring and giving to your romantic partner and loved ones; some call Virgo a \"sign of service.\" You tend to be very self-critical—it's a challenge to see yourself like others see you!\n\nLibra Moon\n\nHey, Mx. Popular! You're a social butterfly with tons of friends, and you know how to charm every first date. You love pretty things and people, and you're a natural artist. You love to gossip, but you're also non-confrontational; you're just too much of a people-pleaser. Libra is the sign of balance, so you feel extra secure and confident when you're in a relationship.\n\nScorpio Moon\n\nYour emotions run deep! You feel things very intensely, but you might not let others know. You tend to be secretive and process your feelings alone, rather than with others. You know how to present as cool and collected, but you will hold a grudge if you feel like you've been wronged. You crave a deep, all-consuming love; you don't do superficial.\n\nSagittarius Moon\n\nYou're a natural adventurer, always seeking new places, hobbies, and knowledge. You thrive when you're trying something new! You're naturally optimistic, and it's not hard to see why—thanks to Jupiter's influence, you're cosmically lucky. You tend to be single or in situationships, but you can commit when you find a partner who's just as free-spirited as you are.\n\nCapricorn Moon\n\nYou are the HBIC, and you make sure everyone knows it! You tend to prioritize logic over feelings; you can sometimes struggle to process your own emotions. You're naturally ambitious and driven; whatever your goal is, you will dedicate yourself to it until it's achieved. You value security and stability, and you need a reliable partner who supports you.\n\nAquarius Moon\n\nSome people call Aquarius the \"weirdo\" of the zodiac—take it as a compliment! You're one of a kind, and you see the world in a totally unique way. You're both creative and science-minded, with wide-ranging interests and hobbies. You care a lot about social causes and you have a huge heart, but you sometimes find it hard to relate to people one-on-one. In a relationship, you need a partner who celebrates your quirks and who is comfortable with you taking your \"me time\" when you need it.\n\nPisces Moon\n\nYou might be *the* most imaginative and creative sign of the zodiac. You have a rich fantasy life and are sometimes said to have your head in the clouds. You're very emotional and intuitive, and you value your close bonds with friends, family, and lovers. In a relationship, you need someone who appreciates and celebrates your sensitive feelings."
