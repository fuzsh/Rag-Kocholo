        "text": "Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system is surrounded by more than 60 moons.\n\nThe moons of Jupiter were first discovered in 1610. Galileo Galilei discovered at that time the four largest Jovian System satellites Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. These Galilean moons called for, were the first to be observed except that of the Earth.\n\nToday, thanks to space probes, we have a more complete view of Jovian system. This series of Voyager has lifted the veil on the Jovian system (1979: Metis, Adrastea and Thebe).\n\nBefore the space age, astronomers have discovered: Amalthea (1892), Himalia (1904), Elara (1905), Pasiphae (1908), Sinope (1914), Lysithea Carme and (1938), Ananke (1951), Leda ( 1974) and Themisto (1975.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1999, no new satellite of Jupiter was discovered and it was not until October 6, 1999, to Spacewatch program discovers a new moon to Jupiter, Callirrhoe.\n\nThe observations in 2000 revealed ten new moons, bringing the number of satellites to 28 after the rediscovery of Themisto, Kalyke, Jocasta, Erinome, Harpalyke, Isono, Praxidike, Megaclite, Taygete, Chaldene and S/2000 J 11.\n\nThe following year, eleven other moons were discovered, bringing the total to 39, Hermippe, Eurydome, Sponde, Kale, Autonoe, Thyone, Pasithee, Euanthe, orthoclase, Euporie and Aitne. In 2002, one moon, Archy, was discovered. In 2003 there is the discovery of 23 new satellites, EukÃ©lade, S/2003 J 2, S/2003 J 3 S/2003 J 4, S/2003 J 5, Helice, Aoede, Hegemone, S/2003 J 9, S / 2003 J 10, Kallichore, S/2003 J 12, Cyllene, S/2003 J 14 S/2003 J 15 S/2003 J 16 S/2003 J 17 S/2003 J 18 S/2003 J 19 , Carpo, Mneme, ThelxinoÃ© and S/2003 J 23. Most of the 47 satellites discovered after the 2000s are small moons of a few kilometers in diameter, the largest reaching only 9 km. In 2006, 63 known moons of Jupiter, the record of the solar system.\n\nGanymede is the largest moon of Jupiter, but also the solar system. It is bigger than Mercury. Ganymede has roughly half the mass of Mercury.\n\nIt was discovered in 1610 by Galileo Galilei and Simon Marius, who named it in honor of Ganymede, the Trojan prince of great beauty, abducted by Zeus, an eagle, while he was tending his flock on Mount Ida in Troad.\n\nGanymede is composed of silicate and water ice based on a liquid mantle could contain liquid water.\n\nLike our own moon, Ganymede always presents the same face toward the planet Jupiter.\n\nImage: Ganymede has an area dotted with craters brilliant. In this detailed mosaic taken by the Galileo spacecraft around Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, the colors of the moon were very different.\n\nCredit: Galileo Project, DLR, JPL, NASA\n\nCallisto was discovered in 1610 by Galilee and Simon Marius.\n\nThis last one so named it in honor of Callisto, a nymph of a very big beauty, a following one of Artemis and loving conquest of Zeus, of which she had Arcas.\n\nCallisto has a surface intensely craterised. Its size in fact the third biggest moon of the system solar and comparable to Mercury.\n\nCallisto an enormous ice floe of several kilometers in thickness under which exists probably a liquid ocean.\n\nImage: photography taken by the probe Galileo.\n\nIo is one of four Galilean moons of Jupiter, the closest to the planet. it pulls its name of Io, loving conquest of Zeus persecuted by the wife of this last one, Hera, whose a priestess she had been. Io is especially remarkable for its active, observed volcanism that on the Earth, Triton and Enceladus.\n\nThe energy necessary for this activity results probably from interactions of tide between Io, Europe, Ganymede and Jupiter. Although Io always presents the same in front of Jupiter, the presence of Europe and Ganymede makes it vacillate a little.\n\nThis interaction deforms the surface of Io which lifts up itself and falls up to 100 meters and produces of the heat by internal friction.\n\nEuropa is one of four Galilean moons, discovered by Galilee and Simon Marius who so named it in honor of Europa, princess Phoenician, delighted on a beach of Sidon by Zeus transformed in white bull. Of their union were born Minos, Rhadamanthe and Sarpedon.\n\nEurope is subjected to the strong gravitational strengths of Jupiter.\n\nThe Galileo probe revealed the presence on its surface of crystals of sulfate of magnesium, which on Earth are in the dried up lakes.\n\nThe ice of surface of several kilometers in thickness ache a maintained liquid ocean by the heating produced by the strengths of tide due to the nearness with Jupiter.\n\nImage: photography taken by the probe Galileo.\n\nAmalthea was discovered in 1892 by the American astronomer Edward Emerson Barnard using the 91 cm telescope at Lick Observatory.\n\nThis is the first satellite of Jupiter discovered since the Galilean moons in 1610.\n\nThe surface of Amalthea is very red, its reflectivity increases with wavelength from the green to the infrared.\n\nThe period of revolution of Amalthea is 12 days.\n\nThe rotation around its axis is synchronous, ie, 12 days.\n\nIts surface is cratered. Its craters are very large compared to the size of Amalthea. Amalthea is made of ice and debris very porous.\n\nPan crater, the largest, measuring 100 km in diameter and is deep at least 8 km.\n\nThe crater, Gaea, measuring 80 km, it is about twice as deep as Pan. Amalthea has two mountains, and Mons Ida Mons Lyctas. Amalthea orbits Jupiter at a distance of 181,000 km. The orbit of Amalthea is very close to the outer edge of the ring Gossamer. This ring is composed of dust ejected from the satellite. Amalthea is not to be confused with the asteroid (113) Amalthea. Name Amalthea comes from the nymph feeds Jupiter."
