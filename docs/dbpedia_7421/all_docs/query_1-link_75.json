        "text": "From the start of space activity, scientists recognized that spacecraft could gather scientifically valuable data about the various planets, moons, and smaller bodies in the solar system. Both the United States and the U.S.S.R. attempted to send robotic missions to the Moon in the late 1950s. The first four U.S. Pioneer spacecraft, Pioneer 0–3, launched in 1958, were not successful in returning data about the Moon. The fifth mission, Pioneer 4 (1959), was the first U.S. spacecraft to escape Earth’s gravitational pull; it flew by the Moon at twice the planned distance but returned some useful data. Three Soviet missions, Luna 1–3, explored the vicinity of the Moon in 1959, confirming that it had no appreciable magnetic field and sending back the first-ever images of its far side. Luna 1 was the first spacecraft to fly past the Moon, beating Pioneer 4 by two months. Luna 2, in making a hard landing on the lunar surface, was the first spacecraft to strike another celestial object. Later, in the 1960s and early 1970s, Luna and Lunokhod spacecraft soft-landed on the Moon, and some gathered soil samples and returned them to Earth.\n\nIn the 1960s the United States became the first country to send a spacecraft to the vicinity of other planets; Mariner 2 flew by Venus in December 1962, and Mariner 4 flew past Mars in July 1965. Among significant accomplishments of planetary missions in succeeding decades were the U.S. Viking landings on Mars in 1976 and the Soviet Venera explorations of the atmosphere and surface of Venus from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s. In the years since, the United States has continued an active program of solar system exploration, as did the Soviet Union until its dissolution in 1991. Japan launched missions to the Moon, Mars, Halley’s Comet, and Venus and returned samples from the asteroids Itokawa and Ryugu. Europe’s first independent solar system mission, Giotto, also flew by Halley. After the turn of the 21st century, it sent missions to the Moon, Venus, and Mars and an orbiter-lander, Rosetta-Philae, to a comet. India and China sent the Chandrayaan-1 (2008) and two Chang’e (2007, 2010) missions, respectively, to orbit the Moon. China’s Chang’e 3 mission landed a small rover, Yutu, on the Moon in 2013, and Chang’e 4 made the first landing on the far side of the Moon in 2019. India’s Mars Orbiter Mission entered orbit around that planet in 2014. China placed the Tianwen-1 lander and the Zhurong rover on Mars in 2021, and that same year Hope, an orbiter from the United Arab Emirates, entered Mars orbit. NASA’s Dawn mission (2007) orbited the large asteroid Vesta from 2011 to 2012 and entered orbit around the dwarf planet Ceres in 2015.\n\nEarly on, scientists planned to conduct solar system exploration in three stages: initial reconnaissance from spacecraft flying by a planet, comet, or asteroid; detailed surveillance from a spacecraft orbiting the object; and on-site research after landing on the object or, in the case of a giant gas planet, by sending a probe into its atmosphere. All three of those stages have been carried out for the Moon, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, a comet, and several asteroids. Several Soviet and U.S. robotic spacecraft have landed on Venus and the Moon, and the United States has landed spacecraft on the surface of Mars. A long-term detailed surveillance of Jupiter and its moons began in 1995 when the U.S. Galileo spacecraft took up orbit around the planet, at the same time releasing a probe into the turbulent Jovian atmosphere. In 2001 the U.S. Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft landed on the asteroid Eros and transmitted information from its surface for more than two weeks.\n\nAmong the rocky inner planets, only Mercury was for some time relatively neglected. In the first half century of space exploration, Mercury was visited just once; the U.S. Mariner 10 probe made three flybys of the planet in 1974–75. In 2004 the U.S. Messenger spacecraft was launched to Mercury for a series of flybys beginning in 2008 and entered orbit around the planet in 2011. A joint European-Japanese probe, BepiColombo, was launched toward Mercury in 2018 and is scheduled to enter orbit there in 2025.\n\nAs of 2020, the exploration of the two outer giant gas planets—Uranus and Neptune—remained at the first stage. In a series of U.S. missions launched in the 1970s, Pioneer 10 flew by Jupiter, whereas Pioneer 11 and Voyager 1 and 2 flew by both Jupiter and Saturn. Voyager 2 then went on to travel past Uranus and Neptune. On August 25, 2012, Voyager 1 became the first space probe to enter interstellar space when it crossed the heliopause, the outer limit of the Sun’s magnetic field and solar wind. The Voyagers were expected to still be returning data through 2020. The U.S. Cassini spacecraft, launched in 1997, began a long-term surveillance mission in the Saturnian system in 2004; the following year its European-built Huygens probe descended to the surface of Titan, Saturn’s largest moon. In 2017 the Cassini mission ended when it burned up in Saturn’s atmosphere. In 2011 the United States launched the Juno mission, which studied the origin and evolution of Jupiter after it arrived at the giant planet in 2016. Thus, every significant body in the solar system, even the dwarf planet Pluto and its largest moon, Charon, has been visited at least once by a spacecraft. (The U.S. New Horizons spacecraft, launched in 2006, flew by Pluto and Charon in 2015 and by a much smaller Kuiper belt object, Arrokoth, in 2019.)\n\nThese exploratory missions sought information on the origin and evolution of the solar system and on the various objects that it comprises, including chemical composition; surface topography; data on magnetic fields, atmospheres, and volcanic activity; and, particularly for Mars, evidence of water in the present or past and perhaps even of extraterrestrial life in some form.\n\nWhat has been learned to date confirms that Earth and the rest of the solar system formed at about the same time from the same cloud of gas and dust surrounding the Sun. The four outer giant gas planets are roughly similar in size and chemical composition, but each has a set of moons that differ widely in their characteristics, and in some ways they and their satellites resemble miniature solar systems. The four rocky inner planets had a common origin but followed very different evolutionary paths and today have very different surfaces, atmospheres, and internal activity. Ongoing comparative study of the evolution of Venus, Mars, and Earth could provide important insights into Earth’s future and its continued ability to support life.\n\nThe question of whether life has ever existed elsewhere in the solar system continues to intrigue both scientists and the general public. The United States sent two Viking spacecraft to land on the surface of Mars in 1976. Each contained three experiments intended to search for traces of organic material that might indicate the presence of past or present life-forms; none of the experiments produced positive results. Twenty years later, a team of scientists studying a meteorite of Martian origin found in Antarctica announced the discovery of possible microscopic fossils resulting from past organic life. Their claim was not universally accepted, but it led to an accelerated program of Martian exploration focused on the search for evidence of the action of liquid water, thought necessary for life to have evolved. Beginning in 2001, the United States sent a series of “follow the water” missions to orbit or land on Mars, including 2001 Mars Odyssey (2001), two Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity (2003), Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (2005), the Curiosity rover (2011), the MAVEN orbiter (2013), the InSight lander (2018), and the Perseverance rover and Ingenuity helicopter (2020). Europe launched the Mars Express mission in 2003 and the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter in 2016. A major long-term goal of the Mars exploration program is to return samples of the Martian surface to Earth for laboratory analysis, and Perseverance collected samples in 2021 for a future sample return mission."
