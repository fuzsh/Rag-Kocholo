My dream is to one day visit the moon and ride on the Space Shuttle and maybe perhaps see an actual UFO and an alien from outer space. I am 42 years old and have not yet given up on my dreams. In the meantime, I will keep observing the cosmos from the earth. I would love to hear from others who love the stars, the moon, our Solar System and who share my dream of visiting outer space. Also, I would love to hear from those who have witnessed a UFO and E.T's relatives. Sincerely, Miss Tori Kaufmann\n\nSaturday, December 30, 2000 at 06:31:11\n\nfrom Paul in Glenbrook\n\nFound the Inconstant Moon site invaluable while reading about moon landings.

Carney in Medford MA\n\nDear Sirs, I reached your site via Encarta, intrigued and puzzled by their saying that you assert that Alexei Leonov was the 1st man to walk on the moon, rather than being the first man to make a spacewalk. I would suggest that this be corrected, although I am sure that your site traffic is increased because of it :). Thanks.\n\nreply: Actually I made no such claim. As I state (more than once) on this site, Neil Armstrong was the first to walk on the Moon. In fact when I heard about it I wrote to Encarta to point out the error, which they have now corrected, and it has cost me a nice link. Pity!\n\nFriday, October 13, 2000 at 04:04:55\n\nfrom Wilbert Tidwell in Oklahoma City, Okla.\n\nVery educational.\n\nThursday, October 12, 2000 at 21:56:04\n\nfrom Rick Ellis in Toronto Canada\n\nThanks.

Regards REC\n\nSunday, August 13, 2000 at 20:06:49\n\nfrom Nathan B. Miron, Ph.D. in Kenwood, CA\n\nGreat idea! As an observing astronomer since 1935 (back when we used to talk about the Andromeda Nebula) I have ground and polished telescopes since I was 14, and have seen the styles go from \"elaborate\" meant a 2\" refractor with an equatorial mounting to the huge light buckets we amateurs now have that compete with major observatories. I have seen the status of the amateur rise, both in quality and quantity (but with only grudging acceptance from the professionals), but somehow, through all this, our nearest neighbor, the moon, has been relatively ignored. Let me share an incident that happened last week in a public night at the Ferguson Observatory (www.rfo.org. I had my 10\" dobsonian on the parking lot outside the observatory, on a public night. A young man came with his daughter in his arms. It was not yet dark enough to see stars, but an almost-first quarter moon was there. I showed it to him, and he was enthralled. He bent down to let his daughter (whom he was holding in his arms) also look. I could see the light shining on her iris, and she was obviously seeing something there. The thing that made this stand out in my mind was the fact that when he stood up and took her away from the eyepiece, she cried and reached for it, again and again and again. She couldn't get enough of the moon! But the thing that impressed me the most was that this young lady was only 16 months old--too young to talk and too young to walk, but not too young to enjoy seeing the moon!\n\nSunday, August 13, 2000 at 15:48:26\n\nfrom Ray Wartinger in Rochester, NY\n\nThanks for a GREAT website! I'm doing a star party tonite and the almost full moon will be the highlight (naturally). I picked up a few tidbits from your Q&A and trivia that will be useful.

Some other reservations but mostly a nice site! Thank you. Fabac\n\nreply: As I explain elsewhere, I have tried always to use photos for the correct day. However, for understandable reasons most observations are made during the earlier part of the night rather than the hours before dawn. Consequently there are many fewer photos of the later stages of the lunation and in some cases I have had to use images taken under the opposite illumination (but from roughly the correct altitude) to that which you would actually see.\n\nSaturday, June 17, 2000 at 14:11:24\n\nfrom joe thorburn in greeley colorado\n\nSaturday, June 17, 2000 at 13:39:21\n\nfrom tony symonds in worcester\n\ngreat site well impressed\n\nSaturday, June 17, 2000 at 07:32:45\n\nfrom Allen in Chester,SC\n\nFound site in Popular Science, checked it out at 2am after being outside.
