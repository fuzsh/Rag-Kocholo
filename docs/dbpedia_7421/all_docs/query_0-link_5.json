        "text": "Iocaste, also known as Jupiter XXIV, is a retrograde irregular satellite belonging to the outer planet of Jupiter. This satellite was discovered by Scott S. Sheppard, Yanga R. Fernandez, David C. Jewett, and Eugene A. Magnier on November 23, 2000 at the Mauna Kea Observatory. This satellite belongs to the Ananke group, a group of irregular retrograde satellites with the largest satellite of the group being Ananke.\n\nFormation[]\n\nIocaste is part of the Ananke group, which means it was created from the remains of the creation of this group. When an asteroid from the Asteroid belt was brought in by Jupiter's gravitational pull, it suffered several collisions. The broken pieces became the satellites of the Ananke group, with Ananke being the largest.\n\nSurface[]\n\nThe satellite is about 5 kilometres in diameter and appears grey (colour indices B−V=0.63, R−V=0.36), similar to C-type asteroids."
