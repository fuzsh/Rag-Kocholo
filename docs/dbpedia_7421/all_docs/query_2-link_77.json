In fact, it is 2.5 times the combined mass of all the other planets put together.\n\nSo it's no surprise that the gas giant also has a lot of moons. Here's all you need to know.\n\nHow many moons does Jupiter have?\n\nJupiter has 79 moons, 53 of which have been named and 26 which have no name.\n\nThe planet can support so many moons because its size and mass give it gravitational stability.\n\nThis means asteroids near Jupiter are either pulled in and destroyed - or go into orbit.\n\nJupiter also has the strongest magnetic field of all the planets in our solar system.\n\nPlus, Jupiter has some moons orbiting in the opposite direction to the others, and so also in the opposite direction to Jupiter’s rotation.\n\nSome of Jupiter’s moons are tiny, around 2km in diameter, such as Pandea, Dia, and Ersa.\n\nMany of these were discovered as recently as 2017, using high-tech Earth telescopes.\n\nOthers were found much earlier, such as Pasiphae in 1908 and Lysethea in 1938.\n\nWhat is Jupiter's biggest moon?\n\nGanymede is Jupiter’s biggest moon.\n\nIn fact, it is the largest satellite in our solar system - larger than Mercury and three-quarters the size of Mars.\n\nIt is the only moon in the solar system to have its own magnetic field.\n\nGanymede is one of the Galilean satellites - the four largest moons of Jupiter - which were discovered by Galileo.\n\nThey were the first to be found and are also the most scientifically interesting.\n\nAlthough Ganymede is as big as Mercury, it is only half the density.\n\nIt is the most volcanically-active body in our solar system, and the only one other than Earth.\n\nThe moon Europa is one of the brightest in our solar system. Its surface is almost all water and ice, and it is thought to be the most likely planet other than Earth for life to exist.\n\nCallisto is the most heavily cratered object in our solar system.\n\nWhich planet has the most moons?\n\nSaturn is the planet with the most moons in our solar system - it has 82 compared to Jupiter’s 79.\n\nJupiter was the planet with the most moons until 2019, when 20 new moons were found in orbit around Saturn.\n\nThese moons average five kilometres in diameter, and 17 of them orbit Saturn in the direction opposite to its rotation, and to the other moons."
