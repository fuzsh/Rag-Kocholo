        "text": "IFA Hawaii\n\nIocaste ( Jupiter XXIV) is one of the smaller outer moons of Jupiter.\n\nDiscovery\n\nIocaste was discovered on 23 November 2000 by astronomers at the University of Hawaii. It was initially provisional designation S/2000 J 3\n\nNamed the moon after Jocasta, mother of Oedipus in Greek mythology.\n\nPath data\n\nIocaste orbits Jupiter at an average distance of 21,269,000 km in 631 days and 12 hours. The track has an eccentricity of 0.216. With an inclination of 149.4 ° to the local Laplace plane the web is retrograde, that is, the moon moves against the direction of rotation of Jupiter around the planet.\n\nBecause of their web properties is Iocaste the Ananke group, named after Jupiter's moon Ananke assigned.\n\nPhysical data\n\nIocaste has a diameter of about 5 km. Their density is estimated to be 2.6 g / cm ³. It is believed to be predominantly composed of siliceous rock, and has a very dark surface with an albedo of 0.04, i.e., only 4% of the incident solar light is reflected. Their apparent brightness is 21.8 m."
