        "text": "1947\n\nFollowing WW11 racing resumed with the Club creating new classes formed based on length and performance. Class 1 (LWL 38+ft<60ft rating), Class 11 (LWL 27.5-38 27.5<38ft rating), Class 111 (LWL 19-27.5ft<27.5 rating). Class 1 and 11 were eligible for the Fastnet race. The season was dominated by John Illingworth’s new Myth of Malham - a Laurent Giles design to Illingworth’s conception with a light displacement, no sheer or bulwarks and short overhangs, plus a headsail dominant rig, exploiting the RORC rule. She wins the Channel Race and Fastnet Race.\n\nMacLean Buckley becomes Admiral.\n\n1948\n\nTwo of the RORC’s longest-serving staff appointed: Secretary Alan Paul (known as The Apostle or “Possle” for short. He was an amateur yacht designer qualified for the Club in 1935 and a committee member since 1937. His Assistant Hope Kirkpatrick, an ex-ATS officer and a one-time concert pianist.\n\nJohn Illingworth becomes Commodore.\n\n1949\n\nFor the first time the Fastnet Race starts from the RYS line in Cowes, heading westwards, leaving the Scillies to port on the return leg. A building westerly wind caused many of the fleet to retire due to sea sickness or gear failure. The last arrivals finished after 10 days. Myth of Malham wins her second Fastnet Race by eight hours over Bloodhound.\n\n1950\n\nA very varied programme with most races being over 200 miles. Races included:- Dover to Kristiansand (480 miles), Arendal to Copenhagen (220 miles); Copenhagen to Kiel (200 Miles); Transatlantic (Bermuda to Plymouth 2870 miles), Plymouth to Santander (440 miles); Santander to Belle Ile (233 miles). The North Sea, Cowes-Dinard and Channel Race were established regular events.\n\nFreehold acquired for 20 St James’s Place for £17,500\n\nRobert Somerset appointed Commodore.\n\n1951\n\nFastnet winner, Yeoman, is presented to the Club by Owen Aisher and his partners and renamed Griffin II. 15 races held – the most in the RORC’s annual calendar to date. The Fastnet attracts 29 starters from seven nations, including Australia making its debut with Phil Davenport’s Waltzing Matilda. Sever weather causes many retirements. Line honours go to the Swedish-owned Circe, designed by Olin Stephens and skippered by brother Rod, but Owen Aisher’s Yeoman III wins by five and a half hours on corrected time.\n\n1953\n\nAnnual membership subscription raised to six guineas and race entry fees changed to a ‘per crew’ basis. Hot topic of debate: Allowing small boats to compete in the Fastnet Race as they are permitted to in the Bermuda Race. This was eventually passed with Class 3 cleaning up – Sir Michael Newton’s Favona winning the Fastnet Challenge Cup.\n\nThe Club’s first lady Rear Commodore elected – the Hon. Ray Pitt-Rivers (owner of Foxhound).\n\nMyles Wyatt appointed Commodore.\n\n1955\n\nNew race from Dartmouth to Gibraltar introduced, albeit with only three starters. The technology game increases pace: John Illingworth’s Mouse of Malham, with a mere 24ft LWL, sets a new trend in yacht design by separating its skeg rudder from the keel while Fastnet winner Dick Nye’s Carina II is the first to use synthetic sails.\n\n1956\n\nSevere weather dogs the Cowes-Plymouth Race and Plymouth-Belle, but especially the Channel Race when a four day long gale destroys Bloodhound’s storm sails. She is saved by successfully anchoring just of Selsey Bill, while Selwyn Slater’s cutter Uomie is abandoned and Fred Cartwright’s Tilly Twin is run up the Bognor Regis beach.\n\n1957\n\nAdmiral’s Cup: Following discussions over how to get more American teams to compete in the UK, the Admiral’s Cup is conceived. Teams from the USA and Great Britain compete for a trophy donated by Peter Green, Sir Myles Wyatt, John Illingworth, Geoff Pattinson and Selwyn Slater, initially known as the 1957 Gold Cup. Admiral’s Cup races include Cowes Week’s Britannia Cup and New York Yacht Club Cup, plus the Channel Race (counting double points) and culminates in the Fastnet Race (counting triple).\n\nIn future years the Admiral’s Cup spawns the Southern Cross (Australia), Onion Patch (USA East Coast), Kenwood Cup (Hawaii), Sardinia Cup, and IOR Ton Cups. The Fastnet is one of the toughest on record so far, alongside 1927, 1930 and 1949, with 29 retirements from 41 starters. The Admiral’s Cup is contested by three boat teams, with England fielding Jocasta, Myth of Malham and Uomie against the US trio of White Mist, Bill Snaith’s Figaro and Carina II. The English won by just 70 points to 68. Carina II is the overall Fastnet Race winner, her second consecutive victory.\n\n1951 Fastnet winner Yeoman III is given to the club by Owen Aisher, Sir Giles Guthrie and Charles Gardner to become the new Griffin training boat. Simba sounders now permitted equipment.\n\nVernon Salisbury appointed Commodore, Sir Myles Wyatt becomes Admiral.\n\n1958\n\nRORC purchases No. 19 St James’s Place for £18,050 but cannot move in because of a tenant. Programme of 14 races considered as excessive by some members.\n\n1959\n\nIn the second Admiral’s Cup, England, represented by Myth of Malham, Griffin II and Selwyn Slater’s new yacht Ramrod, again Britain narrowly wins, this time beating a Dutch team by 135 points to 123. The Swede S&S designed Class II yawl, Anitra, wins the Fastnet Race with Mike Richey as navigator.\n\n1961\n\nOver three years the total number of RORC race starters almost doubles to 590. Classes refined: Class 1 - 30-70ft rating; Class 2 - 24-30ft rating; Class 3 - 19-24ft rating. Channel Race has 110 entries. Admiral’s Cup teams include the USA, France, Holland and Sweden, while Britain once again fields Bloodhound and Griffin II plus its only new boat, Ren Clarke’s Quiver III and is roundly beaten by the US team. A heavy weather Fastnet attracts 95 starters and is won by Dutchman Otto van der Vorm’s Zwerver, despite being hove to for five hours.\n\nAt 37, Peter Green becomes the club’s youngest ever Commodore.\n\n1962\n\nLong distance race was Cowes to San Sebastian followed by a race from San Sebastian to Belle Ile. To coincide, a race from Cowes to Dartmouth and then to Belle Ile was organised. The Duke of Edinburgh acquires Bloodhound. Rating-wise, 2000 yachts in Britain are measured, 700 in Scandinavia, 80 in Germany, 700 in Holland and 500 in France.\n\n1963\n\nDerek Boyer and Dennis Miller’s Clarion of Wight, Ron Amey’s Noryema III and Max Aitken’s Outlaw chosen for English Admiral’s Cup team, winning against six nations and, for the first time since the war, Germany. Clarion wins the Fastnet Challenge Cup, after a hard race causes carnage across the fleet. Transatlantic race – Newport, Rhode Island to the Eddystone. Organised by the Annapolis Yacht Club, the New York Yacht Club and the RORC.\n\n1964\n\nLong distance race – Solent to Santander (500 miles) followed by Santander to La Trinite (240 miles). First GRP boats – Nicholson 32s – compete. Record number of starters in the Cowes Dinard Race – 129, with 652 yachts competing across 12 events during the year.\n\n1965\n\nTechnical developments include rod rigging on Firebrand and America’s Cup tank test data being used. The Dick Carter-designed Rabbit features a spade rudder completely separate from her keel. Baron de Rothschild’s Gitana IV sets a new Fastnet course record of 3 days, 9 hours and 40 minutes. First One Ton Cup held in Le Havre, boats having a maximum RORC rule rating of 22ft, racing boat-on-boat without handicap. The event is won by the Danish Diana III. The event strikes such a chord that it inspires many purpose-built One Tonners to be built. Mike Vernon becomes Commodore. 965 starters across the club’s events with Class 3 swelling as Class 1 declines. Classes 2 and 3 are split.\n\n1966\n\nLong distance races Harwich-Copenhagen (630 miles), Yarmouth to Lequeitio (500 miles), Lequeitio to La Trinite (240 miles)\n\n1967\n\nNine nations compete for the Admiral’s Cup including, for the first time, Finland and Spain. Australia fight hard and earns its inaugural victory with Robert Crichton-Brown’s Balandra, Caprice of Huon and Mercedes III. French offshore legend, Eric Tabarly and Pen Duick III, win the Fastnet Race.\n\nDiscussions start between RORC and the Cruising Club of America to consider each club giving up its own rule for a new international one. Olin Stephens and Dick Carter were two of the new rule’s most active supporters. A technical committee, chaired by Olin Stephens, started work on the new rule.\n\n1968\n\nInternational Offshore Rule (IOR) announced by EP De Guingand, Chairman of the Co-ordinating Committee, David Fayle and Robin Glover, RORC Chief Measurers, US designers Olin J Stephens II and Dick Carter and Commodore David Edwards. It will become the most successful rule of all time in yachting. Hot topic: Sponsorship in yachting.\n\nDavid Edwards is appointed Commodore, while Owen Aisher becomes Admiral upon the death of Sir Myles Whatt.\n\n1969\n\nIn January 1969 the Commodore, David Edwards, announced the new International Offshore Rule (IOR) would be ready in its final form in the Spring.\n\nClass 3c introduced for the smallest boats with a minimum of 22ft LWL and 17.5ft rating. There are 18 contenders for the three-boat British Admiral's Cup team, eight purpose built. The Swan 43 Casse Tete is the first GRP production boat to race the Admiral's Cup. Dunhill sponsors British team. Dick Carter design, Red Rooster featuring a lifting keel won the Fastnet Race and was the top placed yacht in the winning American team.\n\nFirst issue of Seahorse magazine is published.\n\nJanet Grosvenor joins the club. 824 yachts compete in 14 events.\n\n1970\n\nDespite the strain put on measurers, IOR MK 11 (Mk1 was never used) was introduced for all RORC races. Classes are regrouped: Class 1 – 33-70ft rating, Class 2 – 29-33ft, Class 3 – 25.5-29ft, Class 4 – 23-25.5ft, Class 5 – 21-23ft.\n\nE. Alan Green joins as Assistant Secretary (Racing). A RORC member, he had trained in England in 1967 to be a Club measurer in Malta. Alan was instrumental at establishing the 604 mile Middle Sea race.\n\nWestminster Council gives permission for No19 St James’s Place to be used for club purposes. It is subsequently knocked through to No20.\n\n1971\n\nSponsorship from Dunhill enables a temporary clubhouse to be erected in Groves & Gutteridge in Cowes. Intense interest in the Admiral’s Cup is fuelled by Prime Minister Ted Heath captaining the British team to victory, the team featuring his S&S 42 Morning Cloud II, Prospect of Whitby and Bob Watson’s Cervantes IV. 17 nations compete with the strong entries again from Australia and the USA. For the first time it is raced under IOR. Due to the size of the fleet, the Cowes Week races are dropped in favour of 30 mile stand-alone.\n\nAustralian Syd Fischer’s Ragamuffin wins the Fastnet Race by two hours on corrected time, while Ted Turner’s American Eagle sets a new course record of 3 days, 5 hours 11 minutes. Traffic Separation Scheme rules tightened, causing races in the eastern Channel or southern North Sea to be rerouted or terminated.\n\n1972\n\nLong distance races – Lymington – Lequeitio (500 miles) followed by Lequeitio – Lorient (260 miles). Royal Albert Yacht Club’s start line at Southsea used for the Le Havre-Royal Sovereign Race (225 miles).\n\nMary Pera (nee Mary Blewitt) author of Celestial Navigation for Yachtsman, RORC member since 1947.

The Austrian-chartered I-Punkt is disqualified for contravening IYRU Rule 22 (transferring water ballast). Membership stands at 3545.\n\n1988\n\nRelative merits of various rating systems hotly debated by the Committee. Although the IOR rules had been very effective over the years it was now producing boats which were unpleasant to race offshore for long periods of time, had no accommodation and were difficult to sell. John Dare builds a Humphreys-designed 36 ft wooden boat with CHS and IMS in mind. IMS promoted by the Club through seminars and awarding IMS prizes.\n\nJonathan Bradbeer appointed Commodore.\n\n1989\n\nAdmiral’s Cup is contested by 14 teams and includes an additional long inshore in Hayling Bay.

First sponsored British boat, the Two Tonner, Wings of Oracle, competes alongside the Farr 50, Juno V and the One Tonner, Port Pendennis.\n\nIMS is adopted by the Offshore Racing Council as the replacement for IOR in 1985, but it is subsequently run in parallel with IOR for some divisions in RORC races. Red Funnel Easter Challenge introduced, the RORC’s first all-inshore event and offering coaching to competitors.
