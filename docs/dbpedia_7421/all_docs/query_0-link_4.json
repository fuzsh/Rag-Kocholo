        "text": "Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system, boasts a whopping 92 moons, making it the second-most populous planet in terms of its companions.\n\n12 new Jovian moons were announced in Feb. 2023 and were published by the Minor Planet Center (MPC) operated by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, according to a new report from Sky and Telescope.\n\nFour of Jupiter's moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto — known as the Galilean moons — were the first celestial objects to be discovered orbiting an object other than the sun or Earth when Galileo Galilei first observed them in 1610.\n\nMost of Jupiter's moons are small, with about 60 of the satellites measuring less than 6.2 miles (10 kilometers) in diameter. Unusually, the outer moons orbit in the opposite direction to which Jupiter spins, suggesting they may have been captured by Jupiter's gravitational field after the initial system was formed.\n\nRelated: The 10 weirdest moons in the solar system\n\nHere is a list of 57 officially named moons of Jupiter along with details on their discovery, according to NASA.\n\nAdrastea: Discovered in July 1979 by the Voyager science team.\n\nAitne: Discovered on 9 December 2001 by Scott S.

Ganymede\n\nDiameter: 3,270 miles (5,260 kilometers)\n\nJupiter's moon Ganymede is the biggest moon in the solar system, it is even larger than the planet Mercury. It is also the only moon that we know of to have its own magnetic field, which causes impressive polar light shows — auroras. Furthermore, the giant moon could harbor a subsurface saltwater ocean which has been theorized to hold more water than all the water on Earth's surface, according to NASA Science.\n\n2. Europa\n\nDiameter: 1,940 miles (3,100 km)\n\nEuropa is thought to have an iron core, rocky mantle and a surface of frozen water ice that sits atop a vast saltwater ocean. According to NASA, the icy moon Europa is thought to be the most promising place to find an environment that could support life forms beyond Earth. The theorized subsurface saltwater ocean could contain twice as much water as Earth's oceans combined and have existed long enough for life to have possibly begun and even evolved.\n\n3. Io\n\nDiameter: 2,260 miles (3,640 km)\n\nThe most volcanically active place in the solar system, Io is a remarkable world locked in a \"tug-of-war\" between Jupiter's gravity and pulls from neighboring Galilean moons Europa and Ganymede. The turbid environment continually renews itself, smoothing out craters with vast lakes of lava spewed from one of the hundreds of volcanoes that blanket the landscape.\n\n4. Callisto\n\nDiameter: 2,995 miles (4,820 km)\n\nJupiter's second-largest moon Callisto is the third-largest moon in the solar system. The moon's surface is thought to be about 4 billion years old, making it the oldest icy surface in the solar system. After being pummeled for4 billion years by impactors such as meteors, it comes as no surprise that Callisto also holds the record for the most heavily cratered body in the solar system.\n\nExploration of Jupiter and its moons\n\nThe Jovian system is no stranger to guests. Since its first visitor in December 1973 when NASA's Pioneer 10 spacecraft conducted a flyby of the gas giant, Jupiter has attracted numerous flybys and close encounters from trailblazing probes. Pioneer 11 made a close approach a year after Pioneer 10 in December 1974 and Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 flew past Jupiter in 1979.\n\nBut it wasn't until NASA's Galileo spacecraft approached the Jovian system in December 1995 that the gas giant finally had a guest stay for any significant length of time. Galileo was the first spacecraft to orbit Jupiter and made substantial discoveries about the gas giant and its moons. The spacecraft spent almost eight years in Jupiter's neighborhood, revealing its many secrets, from a possible subsurface ocean on Jupiter's icy moon Europa, to volcanoes on the moon Io. At the end of its stay in September 2003, Galileo intentionally crashed into the gas giant to prevent collisions and subsequent contamination with the Jovian moons.\n\nThe NASA-ESA Ulysses mission used Jupiter for a couple of gravity-assist maneuvers in 1992 and 2004 while en route to the sun and NASA's Cassini-Huygens spacecraft also paid Jupiter a brief visit while journeying to Saturn. Cassini made its close approach to Jupiter in December 2000 and collected around 26,000 images of the gas giant in the process. Then NASA's New Horizons spacecraft called in on Jupiter in February 2007 during its trip to Pluto and revealed impressive nighttime auroras and lightning near the planet's poles.\n\nThe Jovian system is currently being explored by NASA's Juno mission which arrived in July 2016. Juno is only the second spacecraft to orbit Jupiter and is busy investigating its composition, atmosphere, gravity and magnetic field. Juno aims to learn more about the origin and evolution of Jupiter and the solar system.\n\nNext on the roster to visit the Jovian neighborhood is ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer, JUICE. JUICE successfully launched on April 14, 2023, at 8:14 a.m. EDT (1214 GMT) from Europe's Spaceport in Kourou, French Guiana. But be patient, it will take nearly eight years to reach the largest planet in the solar system. The mission will explore Jupiter and three of its Galilean moons: Ganymede, Callisto and Europa.\n\nNASA's Europa Clipper mission is scheduled to launch in October 2024. The mission will focus on Jupiter's icy moon Europa and investigate whether the strange world harbors conditions that could accommodate life.\n\nHow to see Jupiter's moons for yourself\n\nWith the right equipment, it is possible to spot Jupiter and its four Galilean moons. Our visible planets guide tells you where you can find the brightest planets that month and the best times to view them.\n\nJupiter can reach magnitude -2.94 at this brightness you can spot the gas giant with the naked eye, a pair of binoculars or a small telescope. (On the magnitude scale used by astronomers, lower numbers signify brighter objects. For example, at its brightest, the planet Venus shines with a magnitude of about -4.6). You'll need a good pair of binoculars (at least x10 magnification) or a small telescope to see the Galilean moons.\n\nTo find out where and when to look out for Jupiter's moons, we recommend using skywatching apps like SkySafari or software like Starry Night. Our picks for the best stargazing apps may help you with your planning.\n\nIf you're looking for a telescope or binoculars to observe Jupiter and its moons, our best telescopes for seeing planets guide can help. We also have guides on the best binoculars deals and the best telescope deals, which may come in useful when hunting for a bargain.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nLearn more about ESA's JUICE mission to Jupiter's icy moons with this video from ESA.
