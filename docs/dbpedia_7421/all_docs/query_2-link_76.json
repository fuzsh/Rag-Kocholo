        "text": "Map Basic Data Planetary Image Name: Jupiter Segmentum: Segmentum Solar Sector: Sector Solar Subsector: Subsector Sol System: Sol System Population: Unknown Affiliation: Imperium Class: Gas Giant / Forge World / Mining World[4] Tithe Grade: Unknown\n\nJupiter is a Forge World and Mining World in the Sol System and, as with all forge-worlds, it is a vast manufacturing center. It is the base of the orbital Jovian shipyards.\n\nHistory\n\nDuring the Age of Strife, Jupiter's moons became occupied by cruel Xenos overlords which enslaved the human inhabitants. These moons were not liberated from alien control until the coming of the Emperor in the early days of the Great Crusade.[2] The Human Jovian Void Clans were utilized by the Emperor during the Great Crusade.[3a] During the Great Crusade the Jovian Clans and their shipyards gained fame for producing massive amounts of high-quality warships thanks to technology they guarded even from the Mechanicum.\n\nDuring the Horus Heresy Jupiter was the center of Rogal Dorn's third defensive sphere under the command of Imperial Fists Captain Efried. In the later stages of the Solar War, the massive array of moons and orbital habitations of Jupiter were captured by Iron Warriors forces led by Perturabo. Instead of reducing every pocket of loyalist resistance or wasting his time during his drive to Terra to occupy the many habitation zones around Jupiter, Perturabo instead unleashed fleets of Pirates, traitor Imperial Army, Night Lords, and Emperor's Children to terrorize and subdue the region.[5a] Jupiter was subsequently reclaimed by the Imperium during the Great Scouring after the traitor defeat in the Siege of Terra.[6]\n\nAt some point after the Heresy, Jupiter's orbital shipyards were subjected to the Jovian Purge by the Adeptus Custodes, Ordo Malleus, Sisters of Silence, and Callidus Temple after Heretic elements were discovered there.[9]\n\nOverview\n\nThe space docks and workshops that circle Jupiter, like a ring of moons, are home to the millions of technomat and drone Servitors that work under the supervision of Artisan and Rune Priest Tech-priests to build the Imperial Navy's warships.\n\nIt is known that as far back as the Horus Heresy, Jupiter held industrial and colonial cohorts with clouds of satellites along with Trojan asteroids containing human colonies, factories along with forges. The Jovian colonies were powered by the radiation that surged from the massive planet and much of the industry fed on the mineral riches that had been yielded from centuries of exploitation, with its full potential having not been fully exhausted. Due to these factors, Jupiter served as Terra's shipyards and its skies were always filled with starships with spacedocks and fabricatories around the various moons that worked tirelessly to construct anything from single manned Raven Interceptors to gargantuan hulls of Emperor Class Battleships.[1a]\n\nEach of the Imperium's ship designs is associated with a single shipyard: the Emperor, Tyrant and Dominator are typical of the spaceships produced at the Jovian shipyards.[Needs Citation]\n\nGeography\n\nMoons\n\nAnanke : This moon is known to have had habitats on its surface by the era of the Horus Heresy.[1a]\n\nIocaste : This moon is known to have had habitats on its surface by the era of the Horus Heresy.[1a]\n\nEuropa : Located within the Galilean range, Europa had been geo-engineered into an ocean-moon by the Horus Heresy.[1a]\n\nIo : One of the moons in the Galilean range that had a seething orange mass by the Horus Heresy.[1a]\n\nGanymede : Another of the moons of Jupiter with the shipyards centering around it as well as the dozen other smaller moons.[1a] It has since been transformed into a Hub-Fortress for the Indomitus Crusade.[8]\n\nThule : An asteroid moon that served as the clandestine shipyard for the Furious Abyss and was destroyed by renegade members of the Adeptus Mechanicus during the Horus Heresy.[1a]\n\nCallisto : A moon of Jupiter known to hold residential orbitals above its surface by the Horus Heresy.[1b]\n\nLysithea: Moon of Jupiter that during the Age of Strife was occupied by Xenos. The moon was liberated by forces of the early XIXth Legion during the Great Crusade.[7]\n\nOrbitals\n\nPolar Shoal City-Stations: Vast space colony conglomerations that spread across Jupiter's northern pole. Home to the ruling class of Jupiter.[5b]\n\nSaros Station : This space station in orbit around Jupiter resembled a vast spindle bathing in crimson glow which made it appear as if it were crystal chandelier that had been severed from its mounting and thus cast free into the void. Unlike the majority of the gas giant's industrial and colonial cohorts, the station had been a resort platform before the Horus Heresy, where the Jovian elite found respite as well as diversion from the works of the shipyards and manufactories. It was said that only the Venus orbitals could surpass Saros Station in luxury with its avenues of gold and silver, null-gardens, auditoriums along with the finest opera houses outside the Imperial Palace.[1a]\n\nKadal: Satellite munitions fortress. It was the site of an Alpha Legion-instigated anti-Imperial revolt during the Horus Heresy. Subsequently destroyed during the Solar War.[3b]\n\nPlatform XI: Orbital shipyard that was the site of the Jovian Purge.[9]\n\nOther\n\nThe Caul: Sphere of debris that surrounds Jupiters shipyards which extends deep into space in every direction. This debris field is home to mazes of equatorial breaker yards that gather scrap and dissemble or retrofit vessels.[5b]\n\nSee also\n\nPlanets (List)\n\nSources\n\n1: Nemesis (Novel)\n\n1a: [Needs Citation], pg. 83\n\n1b: [Needs Citation], pg. 87\n\n2: The Horus Heresy Book One - Betrayal, pg. 18\n\n3: Praetorian of Dorn (Novel)\n\n3a: Part 2, Chapter 3\n\n3b: Part 4, Chapter 1\n\n4: Codex: Adeptus Custodes (8th Edition), pg. 29\n\n5: The Solar War (Novel)\n\n5a: Chapter 14\n\n5b: Chapter 16\n\n6: Warhammer 40,000 5th Edition Rulebook pg. 124\n\n7: The Horus Heresy Book Three - Extermination pg.131\n\n8: White Dwarf November 2019, pg. 47\n\n9: Codex: Adeptus Custodes (10th Edition), pg.\n\nUncited"
