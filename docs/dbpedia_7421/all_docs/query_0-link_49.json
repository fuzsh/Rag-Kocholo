MS 30982\n\nA small octavo verse miscellany, written from both ends, predominantly in a single hand in variant styles (ff. 1v-79v, 80r, 88v-96v, 119r-117r rev.), with additions in later hands (ff. 97r-104v, 116v-106r rev.), 164 leaves, in modern half red morocco. Inscribed (f. 1v, in a court hand) ‘Daniell Leare his Booke’, ‘witnesse William Strode’, and (f. 164r) ‘Mr Daniell Leare eius Liber’: i.e. compiled chiefly by Daniel Leare, a distant cousin of the poet William Strode, probably at Christ Church, Oxford, before he entered the Middle Temple in 1633. c.1633 [-late 17th century].\n\nThis suggestion, by Mary Hobbs, is supported by entries in the Caution Book of 1625-41 at Christ Church, where Strode is found (p. 22) paying £10 as college security for Leare and where Leare signs (p. 23) on this sum's repayment by Dr Fell on 13 May 1633. Forey suggests (p. lxxix) that he was the Daniell Leare of St Andrews, Holburne, whose will was proved in 1652; but it is more likely that he was the Daniel Leare to whom Henry King, Dean of Rochester, leased property at Chatham on 19 July 1655 (National Archives, Kew, SP 18/99/61). Daniel Leare's wife, Dorothy, was a member of the Hubert family with whom King was associated by virtue of the marriage of his sister Dorothy.\n\nThe volume includes 12 poems by Donne; 15 poems (plus a second copy of one and three of doubtful authorship) by Carew; 20 poems (plus two of uncertain authorship) by Corbett; and 84 poems (plus second copies of eight poems, four poems of doubtful authorship and some apocryphal poems) by Strode, the texts being closely related to, and in part probably transcribed from, the ‘Corpus MS’ of Strode's poems (StW Δ 1).\n\nInscribed also ‘John Leare’ (probably Daniel's younger brother); (f. 1r) ‘Anthony Euans his booke’ (who married Daniel Leare's niece Dorothy Leare in 1663); (f. 1v) ‘Alexander Croke his Book 1773’; and (f. 164v) ‘John Scott’ (who matriculated at Christ Church in 1632). Rimell & Son, 9 November 1878.\n\nCited in IELM, I.i (1980), and II.i-ii (1987-93), as the ‘Leare MS’: DnJ Δ 41, CwT Δ 15, CoR Δ 4, and StW Δ 10.\n\nDiscussed in Mary Hobbs, An Edition of the Stoughton Manuscript (unpub.
