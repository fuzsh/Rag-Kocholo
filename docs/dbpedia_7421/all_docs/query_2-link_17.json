        "text": "Jupiter's Moons\n\nCarme Group — currently consist of 16 moons Carme being the largest, possibly retaining 99% of the original mass. The primary moons in this group are Taygete, Eukelade, S/2003 J 5, Chaldene, Isonoe, Kalyke, Erinome, Aitne, Kale, Pasithee, Arche, Kallichore, Herse, S/2003 J5, S/2003 J 9, S/2003 J19, and S/2003 J 10. These moons have a retrograde orbit, meaning they rotate in an opposite direction of its parent object.\n\nAnanke Group — consist of 15 moons Praxidike, Iocaste, Harpalyke, Thyone, Euanthe, Euporie, Hermippe, Orthosie, Mneme, Thelxinoe, Helike, S/2003 J3, S/2003 J15, S/2003 J16, S/2003 J18, and the groups name sake Ananke. Like the other groups and pretty much all moons in Jupiter's orbit, it is believed that the moons were part of a larger asteroid that was broken apart in a collision. It is assumed that the original asteroid may have been approximately 28 km in diameter (17.4 miles).\n\nCarpo — is another of Jupiter's \"loner\" moons but unlike all its other moons, Carpo orbits prograde rather than retrograde. That is to say, the it orbits in the same direction as Jupiter. Carpo is also Jupiter's furthest moon to date and was only recently discovered in 2003. So little is known about this moon at this time other than it is approximately 3 km across and it takes 456 Earth days to complete its rotation."
