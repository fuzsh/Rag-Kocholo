        "text": "Tribute\n\nOn the evening of November 4, 2014, Mike passed away suddenly but peacefully in his home in Abbotsford, B.C. in the presence of his loving wife of 15 years, Beverley Kendall.\n\nMike was predeceased by his mother, Brenda, on October 17, 2012. He is survived by his father, William, of Abbotsford; his sister, Beverley (Roy) Arthur of Aldergrove; two nephews, Ryan (Nicole) Arthur and Roy Arthur Jr., and his niece, Danica (Geoff) Taron. He also leaves behind his mother-in-law, Lydia Kendall and brother-in-law, Larry (Suzy) Kendall of Billings, Montana as well as many other extended family members and numerous friends.\n\nMike was born to Bill and Brenda Drebit on October 26, 1968 in Surrey, B.C. where he spent the greater part of his formative years. Following high school, he decided on a life path which took him to Kwantlen College where he graduated in 1988 with his diploma in Criminology. After working as a Correctional Officer for 2 years, he went on to complete his police training at the Justice Institute of B.C., having been hired by the Matsqui Police Dept. (now Abbotsford Police Dept.). In 1998 he met the love of his life and best friend, Bev, at the gym. After 3 years of spending almost every day together, they married on a beach in Maui on February 1, 2001. Recently he completed his mediation training and certification, with the intention of joining his wife in her practice after retirement.\n\nMike was characterized by his laugh, his positive disposition and his unique sense of humor. He had an unmatched zest for life and was noted for his ethics, honesty and dependability. He had a profound love for animals, a passion for good food and wine, and a keen interest in sports, physical activity and travel. Mike touched the lives of everyone who knew him and the world is a better place because of him.\n\nThe family wishes to thank everyone for their overwhelming support and kindness at this most difficult time.\n\nIn lieu of flowers/gifts, please consider a donation in Mike's name to the Abbotsford SPCA."
