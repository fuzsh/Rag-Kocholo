        "text": "Digitally remastered edition. Today was recorded in 1971, during a hugely successful three-week tour of Australia involving concerts in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Canberra.\n\nDudley was accompanied by stalwart drummer Chris Karan and his new permanent bass player Peter Morgan. It is the point at which the Trio found full expression, the sessions spawning a deliciously swinging 'Waterloo', the elegant 'Staircase', a seductive interpretation of Burt Bacharach's 'The Look of Love' and a Top 10 single, the irresistible scat-style 'Song for Suzy', dedicated to Dudley's first wife, the actress Suzy Kendall.\n\nRegardless of the brilliance of Dudley Moore's celebrated comic partnership with Peter Cook, his marriages and abundant romantic assignations, the relationship which was surely most dear to him was with music. He could pull hilarious classical pastiches - like Beethoven 'variations on Colonel Bogey', and Britten's 'Little Miss Muffett' - out of seemingly thin air.\n\nThe music he wrote with such nuance in 1968 for Stanley Donen's film Bedazzled has established an incredible reputation for that score as one of the best of the decade, while the popular Dudley Moore Trio proved to be the perfect vehicle for both his compositional explorations and joyful performance skills."
