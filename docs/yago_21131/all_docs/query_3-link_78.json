        "text": "Her tomboyish turn as the tight-jeans-and-wellies-wearing Barbara helped the Seventies sitcom rake in audiences of 18 million a week and turned the petite actress into one of this country’s most wholesome sex symbols.\n\nOne commentator at the time declared that half the male population were secretly in love with her, while the other half made no secret of it whatsoever.\n\nBut Felicity found the super-sweet Barbara, who was always gigglingly subservient to her husband Tom, a bit of a turn off. She has confessed she would be tempted to “hit her with a stick” if ever she met Barbara in real life for taking “three steps forward, four steps back for women”.\n\nFelicity does, however, feel closer to her current role. The ­actress, who still boasts the award-winning derriere that led her to be voted Rear Of The Year and who, at 62, is still as infectiously gleeful as she was in her 30s, is treading the boards in The Last Cigarette, a play adapted from the diaries of the late Simon Gray, written when the playwright was succumbing to lung cancer.\n\nIt is a disease which claimed Felicity’s own sister, Jennifer, 26 years ago. “I knew Simon well and he was so very honest and open about his illness in a way that Jennifer was never able to be,” Felicity has said.\n\n“These days, we are so much more open about serious illness and death. Back then it was ­almost seen as an embarrassment. I was with Jennifer when she was diagnosed and told her cancer was likely to be fatal. The doctor couldn’t even meet her eyes. She was never able to write about it or talk about it – joke about it even, as Simon did. She wasn’t able to die with any real dignity.’’\n\nFelicity was always very close to Jennifer, who was 13 years her senior and who, in Felicity’s words, “sort of brought me up”.\n\nTheirs was an unconventional upbringing. In 1947, when Felicity was a year old, her parents decided to move to India and the family toured relentlessly in her father’s theatre company, bringing Shakespeare to the poorest of Indian villages.\n\nTheir lives were immortalised in the first major Merchant Ivory film, ­Shakespeare Wallah, in which Felicity’s father Geoffrey Kendal starred as a character based on himself and ­Felicity was cast as his daughter. But it was Jennifer, not Felicity, who was always considered the beauty of the family.\n\nSays Felicity: “I was young, I thought my mother was beautiful and my big sister was absolutely, heartbreakingly beautiful. I sort of grew up in Jennifer’s shadow. She married Shashi Kapoor, the film star, and I always felt that the fairy had come to her, and I was left to struggle for attention.”\n\nFelicity insists, however, that there was no tension between the two. “I was never jealous of her but not being able to rely on my looks made me feel I had to prove I could act. I became the clown.”\n\nFelicity describes her sister as “the favourite” but her marriage to Kapoor forced a rift between her and their overbearing father, who was supremely possessive over his daughters. He told Jennifer that if she married Kapoor, he never wanted to see her again.\n\nEXPRESS ENTERTAINMENT: THE LAST CIGARETTE THEATRE REVIEW\n\n“When we stood on the verandah and Jennifer, red-eyed, threw her arms about his neck, her tiny shoulders shaking with sobs, he stood stiff and straight, his arms plastered to his sides, looking ahead and silent, until I pulled her from him and hugged her into a taxi,” Felicity recalled in her memoirs, White Cargo.\n\nWhen Jennifer died of cancer at the age of 49, Felicity, who was then 36, was devastated. “She had three children and the awfulness of leaving them crucified her,” says Felicity, who immediately became a second mother to her two nephews and niece.\n\n“Jennifer’s children have become my children. I go to India regularly to see the two who live there,” she says. By all accounts, Felicity still finds it difficult to speak about her sister’s death and it cannot have escaped her knowledge, either, that she is now the head of her family, which has now swelled to include several grandchildren, her own and her sister’s. “I love having them all around,” she says.\n\nOf her own parents, her father was the last to go. Her mother Laura died in 1992 and a year later Geoffrey ­became gravely ill following a series of strokes. Felicity nursed him until the end and found some catharsis by ­writing about their relationship.\n\n“White Cargo, my book, was written in his room at the nursing home over three years. I finished it the night ­before he died, which was very strange but also wonderful. I took his ashes to India and going there brought the whole thing full circle for me,” says Felicity.\n\n“When I was growing up I was furious at the amount of influence he had on the way I thought and felt. I have tried to be honest about those moments in my book and not sanitise our relationship by making it sweet.”\n\nIf she sought her father’s approval throughout her life, she also gained his disapprobation on a number of occasions, not least when she decided to leave India. She was 18 at the time and wanted to capitalise on her role in the 1965 film Shakespeare Wallah by pursuing her career in the UK.\n\n“You’re a stupid little b*****,” her ­father told her in no uncertain terms. “You’ll end up marrying the first clot you meet, who will want you to settle down with a bunch of screaming kids. You’ll end up in hell with mortgages and misery!”\n\nIronically, it seems her father’s domineering influence actually ­instilled an independent spirit in his daughter and a reluctance to be too heavily tied to any other man. She has married twice but she has also had an astonishing number of affairs – most famously with the playwright Sir Tom Stoppard – and has always had “a compulsion to move on, to leave places and people behind without a backward glance”.\n\nShe once said: “My marriages broke up because I’m hellish to live with. I’m overly independent, which is unattractive,” although this assessment is probably overly harsh.\n\nHer first marriage, to the ­actor Drewe Henley – with whom she has a son Charley – ended in the late Seventies but it is likely that his depression played as much a part in the relationship’s demise as her career drive and independent spirit.\n\nShe says the Sixties passed her by – “I didn’t swing in the Sixties! I wish I had. I was very prudish. I really didn’t understand what was going on” – but that she decided belatedly to indulge in its spirit a decade later and was never without a man. In her memoirs she boasted she could “flirt my way into any pair of arms I wanted”.\n\nIn 1983 when her affair with the screenwriter Michael Bolt ended, she married theatre producer Michael Rudman and had a second son, Jacob. But in 1991 she left ­Rudman and began an affair with Stoppard, an affair which was ­considered scandalous at the time and which caused Stoppard to leave his wife Miriam. It ended after eight years but Felicity still speaks of her former partner affectionately: “He’s lovely. Nobody would say a bad word about him. There’s nothing to say a bad word about.”\n\nFor a decade, she has been back with Rudman, for whom she converted to Judaism. But while journalists, myself included, have frequently asked her whether the pair will remarry, she doesn’t see the point. “Having done it, you don’t need to do it again to the same ­person,” she says. “The moment has passed and it would be slightly ­embarrassing.”\n\nGiven Felicity’s nomadic background, it is easy to see why she might prefer the status quo – but she insists that Rudman is the one man who really makes her laugh.\n\n“He’s an American Jew,” she says, “and that typical type of humour gets me any time of day or night. It’s just sublime.”\n\nAnd sublime is, one suspects, the word that many of her admirers will continue to use of her.\n\nThe Last Cigarette, Trafalgar Studios, London, 0870 060 6632"
