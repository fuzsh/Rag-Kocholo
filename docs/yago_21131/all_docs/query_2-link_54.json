        "text": "Sort name:\n\nMoore, Dudley\n\nRole:\n\nPhoto:\n\nGender:\n\nmale\n\nArthur 2: On The Rocks\n\n\"I lost $750 million,\" Arthur says, \"Of course, that was when $750 million was a lot of money.\" His loss is your entertainment gain in this delightful riches-to-rags-to-riches sequel directed by comedy veteran Bud Yorkin (All In the Family). Effervescent Dudley Moore takes up where he left of as the multimillionaire title prankster. Liza Minnelli is his scintillatingly sassy spouse Linda and with a dash of divine intervention, stately John Gielgud also reappears in his Oscar-winning role as Arthur's acerbic valet.\n\nThose Daring Young Men In Their Jaunty Jalopies\n\nScreen legend Tony Curtis leads an all-star international cast in this hilarious, romantic and action-packed romp! Set in glorious Monte Carlo, this hugely entertaining follow-up to Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines follows the dashing Schofield (Curtis) as he teams up with the scheming Sir Cuthbert Ware-Armitage (Terry-Thomas) in a zany, winner-take-all car rally beset with scheming competitors, treacherous cliffs - and a very beguiling blonde (Susan Hampshire.)\n\nBedazzled\n\nWhen the Devil (Peter Cook) offers suicidal short-order cook Stanley (Dudley Moore) seven wishes, Stanley easily surrenders his soul. All of his wishes are granted, to the letter. Unfortunately, as each wish comes to life, the Devil--cheeky sod!--manages to slip some unexpected problem into the mix, ruining everything in a deliciously funny way. Bedazzled was made long before 10 and Arthur made Dudley Moore an unlikely movie star.\n\nUnfaithfully Yours\n\nThis remake of Preston Sturges's 1948 comedy follows the same plot and has its amusing moments. Dudley Moore is a famous orchestra conductor who is convinced that his wife (Nastassja Kinski) is having an affair with his best friend, a flamboyant violinist (Armand Assante). So he plots an elaborate scheme by which he will kill them both and get away with murder. That fantasy, which he has while conducting an orchestra, rapidly falls apart once he actually tries to put it into motion. Moore and Assante compete for overacting awards, while Kinski was never much of an actress to begin with.\n\nMicki & Maude\n\nDudley Moore stars as Rob, a TV reporter married to a dedicated career woman. As a result, they rarely spend time together and he falls for a cellist. When she becomes pregnant, Rob decides to marry her—but when he decides to tell his wife, she tells him she’s pregnant. He secretly marries the cellist and has a busy time taking care of both wives and keeping them from discovering the truth. Stars Dudley Moore (Arthur), Amy Irving (TV's \"Alias\"), Ann Reinking (All That Jazz) and Richard Mulligan (TV's \"Soap\").\n\nFoul Play\n\nNot short on murder, mayhem, or any other screwball '70s conventions, Foul Play is a wonderful vehicle for Goldie Hawn. She plays Gloria, a librarian \"ready to take a chance again,\" who ends up the target of an assassination ring. Chevy Chase, fresh off of Saturday Night Live, does the closest thing to real acting he would ever achieve (okay, maybe Fletch) as Tony, the cop assigned to protect Gloria. Dudley Moore made an indelible impression on American audiences as Stanley Tibbets, a surprisingly kinky symphony conductor.\n\nCrazy People\n\nWhen a stressed out ad exec (Moore) proposes a \"truth in advertising\" scheme, he is promptly shipped off to a mental institution. There he teams up with a kooky blonde (Hannah) and a slew of nutty patients. What happens next is absolutely crazy because the public goes absolutely nuts for the new way of advertising. You'll chortle over the advertising slogans you've always wished Madison Avenue would use!\n\nArthur\n\nWhen you get lost between the moon and New York City (ahem), chances are you'll find yourself taking another look at this hit comedy starring Oscar-nominated Dudley Moore as the charmingly witty, perpetually drunken millionaire Arthur Bach. Arthur falls in love with a waitress (Liza Minelli) who doesn't care about his money, but unfortunately Arthur's stern father wants him to marry a Waspy prima donna. The young lush turns to his wise and loyal butler (Oscar-winner John Gielgud) for assistance and advice."
