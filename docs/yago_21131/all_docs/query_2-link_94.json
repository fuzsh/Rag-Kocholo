        "text": "Dudley Moore (April 19, 1935 - March 27, 2002), was a British actor and comedian who became a star after making the film 10. He came from a working-class background and was notably short, at 5 foot 2 1/2 inches.\n\nWhile studying music at Oxford University (Magdalen College, where he was an organ scholar), Moore became friends with Peter Cook, Jonathan Miller[?] and Alan Bennett. In the early 1960s, they appeared in Beyond the Fringe, a comedy revue which many see as a forerunner to Monty Python's Flying Circus. Arguably, Beyond the Fringe launched the 1960s Satire Boom[?]. After enormous success in Britain, it transferred to the USA, where it was also a hit.\n\nMoore teamed up with Cook several times in his career, most notably in the television series Not Only But Also...[?]. Cook and Moore often appeared in sketches as two working-class men (Pete and Dud) in macs and cloth caps, commenting on politics and the arts. Moore was famous for \"corpsing\" - the programmes often went out live, and Cook would deliberately make him laugh in order to get an even bigger reaction from the studio audience.\n\nThey later appeared together in the original film Bedazzled[?] (1967) with Eleanor Bron, and also had a tour called Behind the Fridge. However, their three albums of the late 1970s as Derek and Clive[?], were widely condemned for their use of bad language. Shortly following the last of these, Ad Nauseum, Moore made a break with Cook, whose alcoholism was affecting his work, to concentrate on his Hollywood career.\n\nIn the 1970s, Moore moved to Hollywood, where he appeared in Foul Play (1978) with Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase. The following year, saw his breakout role in Blake Edwards' 10, which he followed up with the movie Arthur (1981). His subsequent films were more hit and miss.\n\nIn addition to acting, Moore continued to work as a composer and pianist, composing scores for numerous films and giving piano concerts. He specialised in jazz, and headed his own trio.\n\nHe was married four times and has children from his marriage to Tuesday Weld[?] and Nicole Rothschild[?]. All of his marriages ended in divorce.\n\nIn June, 2001, Moore was knighted as a Commander of the British Empire (CBE).\n\nIn September, 1999, Moore announced he suffered from Progressive Supranuclear Palsy[?], for which there is no treatment. He eventually succumbed to pneumonia which was a side effect of PSP.\n\nUK chart singles - Goodbye-ee (1965) Peter Cook and Dudley Moore"
