She accused him of assault and told of drug and sex parties at his beach front home.\n\nIn a lawsuit, she claimed he spent more than [pound]6000 a month on drugs and prostitutes.\n\nHe in turn said her allegations had wrecked his career.\n\nThe marriage break-up is also thought to have contributed to his ill health.\n\nRothschild's version of events prompted actress Prunella Scales, a close friend of Moore, to speak of her fears yesterday.\n\nShe met the 5ft 2in funnyman when he was a student at Oxford and said: \"I'm very upset to find out he's not well.\n\n\"He must try to get in touch. If he's over here, I will try to get in touch.\""
