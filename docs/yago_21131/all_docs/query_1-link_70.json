        "text": "Actor Dudley Moore, an unlikely Hollywood heartthrob in \"10\" and \"Arthur\" as a cuddly pip-squeak whose charm melted female hearts, died today. He was 66.\n\nMoore died at 11 am EST (0300 AEDT) at his home in New Jersey, said publicist Michelle Bega in Los Angeles.\n\nHe died of pneumonia as a complication of progressive supranuclear palsy, she said.\n\nThere was more than a touch of autobiography in \"10,\" the 1979 film in which Moore played a musician determined to marry a perfect woman. But the happy ending eluded him in real life. Four marriages ended in divorce.\n\nHe confessed to being driven by feelings of inferiority about his working-class origins in Dagenham, east London, and because of his height of five feet, two-and-a-half inches (156 centimetres). In later life he also spoke of the pain of being rejected by his mother because he was born with a deformed left foot.\n\nComedians, he said in an interview with Newsday in 1980, are often driven by such feelings.\n\n\"I certainly did feel inferior. Because of class. Because of strength. Because of height. ... I guess if I'd been able to hit somebody in the nose, I wouldn't have been a comic.\"\n\nMusic was Moore's entree into public performance, first as a chorister and organist in his parish church in Dagenham and then in 1960 as a young Oxford graduate recruited for the hit four-man comedy review Beyond the Fringe.\n\n\"Fringe,\" which played two years in London and then moved to Broadway, was perhaps the greatest assembly of young comic talent in Britain in this century. Moore was teamed with Alan Bennett, later a successful playwright, Jonathan Miller, the cerebral opera producer and medical doctor, and Peter Cook, a surreal comic and a famously dissipated talent.\n\nMoore's whimsical sense of humour fitted oddly with the more savage satirical style of his partners. \"Apart from his musical contributions to the show,\" Cook wrote in Esquire in 1974, \"Dudley's suggestions were treated with benign contempt by the rest of us.\"\n\nOne of Moore's celebrated contributions to the show was his impersonation of the pianist Dame Myra Hess, playing a bombastic version of \"Colonel Bogey's March\" which he couldn't seem to end.\n\nMoore and Cook formed a fast friendship and later teamed on television as Dud and Pete on \"Not Only ... but Also,\" a sketch comedy series. They also plumbed the depths of taste and decency in a series of recordings as \"Derek and Clive\".\n\nCook and Moore made their screen debuts in \"The Wrong Box\" in 1966, and followed up the next year with another success, \"Bedazzled\".\n\nMoore wrote, starred in and composed the score for his next film, \"30 is a Dangerous Age,\" in 1968.\n\nMoore and Cook teamed again in 1971 for a comedy review titled \"Beyond the Fridge,\" which was a success in London and a smash on Broadway in the 1973-74 season, with the pair winning a special Tony award for their \"unique contribution to the theatre of comedy\".\n\nCook returned to England but Moore settled in Southern California, where he met the director Blake Edwards in a therapy group. When George Segal walked out of Edwards' production of \"10\", the director turned to Moore.\n\nThe 1979 film, co-starring Bo Derek, established Moore as a Hollywood star. Two years later, he had another: \"Arthur\", playing a rich drunk who falls for Liza Minnelli.\n\nThat marked the peak of Moore's film career, though he made several more films including a sequel to \"Arthur\" in 1988.\n\nMusic remained part of Moore's life, both as a jazz pianist and as a parodist."
