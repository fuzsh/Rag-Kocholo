        "text": "biography\n\nBorn Diana Fluck in Swindon, England, on October 23, 1931, beautiful Diana Dors was billed as Britain's answer to Marilyn Monroe in the 1950s, but in reality she and Monroe were two different types. Dors harbored acting aspirations at an early age, and after winning a beauty contest at the age of 13, she went to acting school. Once referring to herself as \"The only sex symbol England produced since Lady Godiva\", Dors made her film debut at age 15 in The Shop at Sly Corner (1947). Bigger and better roles soon followed, and by the early 1950s, Dors was starring in numerous potboiler films. In 1951, at the age of 19, Dors married Dennis Hamilton. Along with her husband's help, she cultivated a sexy bad-girl image that played well in her early films, including Dance Hall (1950), The Weak and the Wicked (1953), and Blonde Sinner (1956; with Michael Craig). By 1956, Dors was the highest paid actress in Britain, earning more than $3 million per year. However, her first marriage didn't survive her career, and the couple separated in 1958. Hamilton passed away in early 1959, before their divorce was finalized. Later that year, Dors married actor and game show host Richard Dawson, with whom she had two sons.\n\nCheesecake photos of Diana Dors from the early 1950s through the early 1960s\n\nIn the mid 1950s, Dors gambled for international stardom and went to Hollywood to make a handful of films. In 1957 and 1958, she starred in the British noir The Long Haul (1957; with Victor Mature), the noir thriller The Unholy Wife (1957; with Rod Steiger, Tom Tryon, and Marie Windsor), and the comedy I Married a Woman (1958; with George Gobel and Nita Talbot). While Dors received good notices in these films, she eventually left Hollywood and went back to Britain. After her divorce from actor Richard Dawson in 1967, Dors married actor Alan Lake in 1968.\n\nthe films of diana dors\n\nDiamond City (1949)\n\nDors fights with Honor Blackman in the Rank adventure Diamond City\n\nA Kid for Two Farthings (1955)\n\nFrom the comedy/drama A Kid for Two Farthings with Joe Robinson\n\nThe Long Haul (1957)\n\nWith Victor Mature in The Long Haul\n\nThe Lady and the Prowler (1958)\n\nLEFT and CENTER: Studio shots of Diana Dors from The Lady and the Prowler.

She also made a number of horror films later in her career, including Nothing But the Night (1972; with Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing), Theater of Blood (1973; with Vincent Price and Diana Rigg), and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1980; with David Hemmings). Enjoying her legendary status, she even appeared as a fairy godmother to Adam Ant in his 1981 video Prince Charming. In 1982, Dors was diagnosed with cancer and passed away on May 4, 1984, at the age of 52. Sadly, her husband Alan Lake committed suicide six months after Dors passed away. She was survived by three sons."
