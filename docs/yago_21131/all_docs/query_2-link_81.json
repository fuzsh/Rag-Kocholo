        "text": "He got MMT, Bo Derek and Liza! Maybe Goldie Hawn, I don’t recall the plot of Foul Play. He was a trollish unattractive man, like a pervy uncle of Davy Jones, but not cute. He had some comic timing, but nothing the way of talent to justify a career in movies? That nose is repulsive.\n\nThis was back when everything was geared to straight males, even romantic movies--because people went to the movie theater to see movies on dates and the man paid for the tickets. Straight males don't like movie stars to be too attractive in date movies, since it sets a high standard for them with women. It's the same reason John Belushi became so popular among straight males--an ugly, rude, fat guy plays the most popular dude on campus. It made straight men of a certain era feel good.\n\nHe was likeable, he was funny.\n\nNow we get Ken dolls with zero personality as romantic leads.\n\nGive me Dudley over them any day.\n\nThe show was a huge hit throughout all the world in all the Commonwealth countries. But typically never made it to America because of its off-beat English humour and America's cultural inwardness. It's interesting to contrast it with Laugh-In which was happening at the same time in the US. Neither particulary funny now, but both innovative then.\n\nHe was a lovelorn loser in \"Foul Play,\" but the movie was a smash and when George Segal quit \"10\" Blake Edwards took a chance and cast Moore in a comic-romantic lead role. \"10\" was a hit, then \"Arthur\" was a hit and got him an Oscar nom and lots more lead roles, if fewer hits.\n\nApparently OP doesn't realize Dudley was part of the famous British comedy team, Peter Cook & Dudley Moore, as well as an accomplished pianist who led a jazz group.\n\nPeter Cook and Dudley Moore are still considered to be one of Britain's most famous and talented comedic double acts. Their Broadway show \"Good Evening\" had a decent run, about a year, and was always sold out.\n\nAll DL seems to care about, a person's looks. This certainly explains why so many untalented actual trolls become 'stars' these days.\n\nOP, if you can watch Arthur and still wonder why he was a star, I can’t help you. Even though Gielgud ran away with the movie, DM was hilarious and so sweet.\n\nHe would never have been a lead if George Segal had not walked days before shooting was to start on 10. The film was actually cancelled, when they nabbed Moore as a last minute replacement.\n\nHe was probably not the first choice to replace Segal, but he was the one they could get. And that part established him as a Lead Actor.\n\nMy late father was a rather short man, but was incredibly popular with women. He was handsome and shy when he was younger, and maybe carried that confidence into his older years. He tended to draw people out and really listen to them. And he was a bit of a wounded bird, too. Women LOVE that.\n\nYou’d never know it to look at him, but he could wrap any woman around his little finger in a matter of minutes. For straight women, it’s not all about looks and money.\n\nR5\n\n[quote] It's the same reason John Belushi became so popular among straight males--an ugly, rude, fat guy plays the most popular dude on campus. It made straight men of a certain era feel good.\n\nThat explains a lot. Thank you.\n\nDudley was extremely talented and funny, he also died a terrible death. Who cares if he wasn't the most handsomest or tallest man, Dudley had talent.\n\nOP and his ilk are fucking clueless.\n\nMoore was a brilliant comedian, but he was also an accomplished musician who composed film scores, wrote songs, and was a skilled pianist. The man had tons of talent and intelligence -and those things make a man sexy, handsome or not."
