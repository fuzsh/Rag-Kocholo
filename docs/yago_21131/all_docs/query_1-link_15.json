        "text": "Dudley Moore's first wife Suzy Kendall has spoken out about her grief for the tragic star. The legendary comedy actor died on Wednesday (27 March 2002), after failing to battle off a bout of pneumonia, complicated by his rare progressive supranuclear palsy brain disorder.\n\nMoore, 66, was married four times, Kendall being the first. The couple tied the knot in 1968 and divorced four years later (72). But the former model says they stayed friends after the split, and she was deeply saddened at the news of his death.\n\nSuzy says, \"I've lost a best friend. We kept in touch over the years and stayed very close. He'd been very ill so, in a way, his death was a blessing. \"He will be missed by everyone. He had such a gift and brought so much laughter to people. \"I feel the laughter has gone now. He really did bring so much joy. \"\n\nSource: WENN"
