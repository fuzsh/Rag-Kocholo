        "text": "The 60th anniversary of the brilliant comic actress Kay Kendall’s death in September came and went very quietly. It saddened me. Kendall was a real breath of fresh air. A British version of Carole Lombard, Kendall was a beautiful, sophisticated and capable dramatic actress who turned into a slapstick goofball with the right material. And just like Lombard, who was 33 when she died in a plane crash in 1942, Kendall died young at just 32, after succumbing to myeloid leukemia.\n\n“Miss Kendall was that stage and screen rarity, a beautiful clown,” the New York Times obit stated. “The talents of a superb comedienne are so seldom conjoined with statuesque, classic beauty that producers along with Miss Kendall’s hard road to the top tended to distrust her qualities as mutually exclusive.”\n\nIn fact, the self-deprecating, often insecure Kendall proclaimed after the release of her best film, 1957’s LES GIRLS, that she looked like a “female impersonator with these long skinny legs. I’m 5 feet [sic] 9. I eat like a horse and I couldn’t become a ballet dancer because I got too big. When I rose up on my toes, I was 10 feet 6 and my feet collapsed.”\n\nKendall affected those whom she knew and worked with including Mitzi Gaynor, who starred with her in LES GIRLS. In 2018, I was doing a Q&A with Gaynor at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Hollywood for the 60th anniversary of SOUTH PACIFIC and asked her about Kendall. She started to gush about how great Kendall was, but started getting misty-eyed thinking about her, so I quickly went back to the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical.\n\nAnd I recall one time during an interview, a rather prickly Stanley Donen became effusive when I brought up Kendall, whom he directed in her last film ONCE MORE, WITH FEELING! (’60).\n\nKendall, who appeared in revues and variety shows as a teenager, got her first big movie role in 1946’s lavish LONDON TOWN, which was one of the British film industry's most expensive flops of the time. She was told by a film executive that she was “ugly, you have no talent. You’re too tall and you photograph badly. Go marry some nice man, settle down and have a nice family.”\n\nShe finally got the perfect role in the classic award-winning comedy GENEVIEVE, which was released in England in 1953. The comedy revolved around two young couples who participate annually in a vintage car rally from London to Brighton. John Gregson and Dinah Sheridan were the main stars with Kenneth More and Kendall as the supporting players.\n\nKendall stole the whole film as Rosalind Peters, More’s high-fashioned overly coiffed model girlfriend who is accompanied by her St. Bernard named Susie. The inventiveness of Kendall's performance, especially when a drunk Rosalind plays a trumpet at a nightclub, is as fresh and funny it was 66 years ago.\n\nHer life changed forever when she made THE CONSTANT HUSBAND with Rex Harrison and released in 1955. And of course, there was a scandal. Though Harrison was married to Lili Palmer at the time, he had a notorious reputation as a womanizer (his affair with Carole Landis in the late 1940s lead to her committing suicide). But the two married in 1957 shortly after Harrison learned from Kendall’s doctor that she had two years to live. Harrison decided not to tell her she was dying, giving her the excuse that she had anemia. Kendall’s own prognosis was never revealed to her, as was common with patients of mortal illnesses in the 1950s. Harrison did tell some of her friends, however, but did not tell her family.\n\nKendall came to Hollywood to make the Cole Porter musical LES GIRLS, directed by George Cukor and starring Gene Kelly, Gaynor and Taina Elg. Kendall won a Golden Globe for her hysterical performance as the British performer who is being sued for libel by another chorus girl. Kendall and Harrison then starred together in a delightful bit of fluff, THE RELUCTANT DEBUTANTE (’58), directed by Vincente Minnelli. Though sometimes real-life couples have no chemistry together on screen, that wasn’t the case with Kendall and Harrison. Not only do they have chemistry to spare, Harrison even seems to take a back seat in the proceedings and let his wife shine.\n\nIn the biography, The Brief, Madcap Life of Kay Kendall by Eve Golden and Kim Kendall, Minnelli’s wife Lee remembered that Kendall and Harrison “were wonderful together. He adored her. You could see when he looked at her, his eyes lit up. They balanced each other perfectly – they played off of each together.” She also noted, “if [Kay] came into a room, she had all laughing in five minutes. Even if you felt a little down, you talked to Kay and by the time you left you were floating, you were up in the air.”\n\nAccording to the book, by 1958 Kendall was “finding it more difficult to play innocent about her physical condition…Kay was not a stupid woman, and no one can be that sick for that long without knowing something is seriously wrong.” She even told her good friend Dirk Bogarde, who knew she was ill. “Diggy, I think I am dying. I've some terrible disease and they won’t tell me. I think I’ve got cancer.” Bogarde kept his promise to Harrison and tried to laugh off her fears.\n\nBy the time she filmed ONCE MORE, WITH FEELING! with Yul Brynner, she was frail. She eventually collapsed during filming and was hospitalized, with Harrison stating that she had a lung infection and anemia. After she sufficiently recovered, Kendall managed to finish the film. After going on a vacation with Harrison, she returned to London and entered a clinic where she died a week later. Even on her death bed, Harrison never told of the leukemia. According to to her biography, Kendall looked at Harrison and asked, “Mousey, you would tell me if I was dying?” To which he replied, “Don’t be stupid, of course I would. You’re not dying.” Shortly after, she sank into a coma. The press account of her last moments was highly romantic, with Kay sighing to Harrison, “’I love you very much, darling’ with her last breath.” ONCE MORE, WITH FEELING! opened in February 1960. And Bosley Crowther in the New York Times was disappointed Kendall’s swan song wasn’t better. “As for poor Miss Kendall (who has died since this picture was made), she works hard to be disagreeable, to virtually no avail. She screeches and fluffs up her feathers, throws things and breaks television sets, but only succeeds in being feverish. Lacking that obvious essential, she is merely fragile and sad. It is certainly too bad her last picture has to be as vapid as this.” But nearly 60 years after the film release, Kendall’s performance still has traces of manic brilliance and leaves you wondering what she would have done had she had lived."
