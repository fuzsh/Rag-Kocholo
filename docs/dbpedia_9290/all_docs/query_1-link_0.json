        "text": "American jazz keyboardist, arranger, and record producer\n\nFor other people named Bob James, see Bob James (disambiguation).\n\nMusical artist\n\nRobert McElhiney James (born December 25, 1939)[1] is an American jazz keyboardist, arranger, and record producer. He founded the band Fourplay and wrote \"Angela\", the theme song for the TV show Taxi.[2] According to VICE, music from his first seven albums has often been sampled and believed to have contributed to the formation of hip hop.[3][4] Among his most well known recordings are \"Nautilus\", \"Westchester Lady\", \"Tappan Zee\", and his version of \"Take Me to the Mardi Gras\".\n\nEarly life and family\n\n[edit]\n\nJames was born on Christmas Day of 1939 in Marshall, Missouri, United States.[1] He started playing the piano at age four.[1] His first piano teacher, Sister Mary Elizabeth, who taught at Mercy Academy, discovered that he had perfect pitch. At age seven, James began to study with R. T. Dufford, a teacher at Missouri Valley College. At age 15, James continued his studies with Franklin Launer, a teacher at Christian College in Columbia, Missouri, with more music instruction during high school from Harold Lickey, conductor of the Marshall High School Band and Orchestra. Apart from the piano, James learned to play trumpet, timpani, and percussion. From 1950 to 1956, he competed in the Missouri State Fair piano competitions and received several blue ribbons.\n\nJames attended the University of Michigan,[1] but during his second year transferred to Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. At Berklee his roommate was saxophonist Nick Brignola.\n\nMusic career\n\n[edit]\n\nHis first professional music job was when he was eight years old, playing for a tap dance class at Mercy Academy. During his adolescence, James's music career proliferated. Early jobs included being a member of the Earle Parsons Dance Band (c. 1952–55) which played various engagements around the Marshall area. During this time, he penned his first dance band arrangement.\n\nDuring the summer of 1955, at Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri, James played for dancing and occasional jam sessions with the Bob Falkenhainer Quartet on the Governor McClurg Excursion Boat in the evenings. He recalls that \"during the day we had free time and I became a proficient water skier that summer!\" At age 16, a solo engagement followed in the summer when James traveled with good friend Ben Swinger to Colorado and ended up with a job in the piano bar at the Steads Ranch resort in Estes Park.\n\nDiscovery by Quincy Jones\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile in college at Michigan, James played free jazz with musicians in Ann Arbor and Detroit. In 1962, his band entered the Notre Dame Collegiate Jazz Festival, where the judges included Henry Mancini and Quincy Jones. The trio entered the competition not expecting to win but wanting to provide some avant-garde music in a contest field that was primarily straight ahead music.[5] To the trio's surprise, they won the competition. Not long after, Jones signed James to an album deal with Mercury Records. Mercury released James's first album, Bold Conceptions (1963), a free jazz exploration that was produced by Quincy Jones and that differed from the smooth jazz for which he would later become known.[6][7][3]\n\nIn New York City, James worked as an arranger and was hired as piano accompanist for jazz singer Sarah Vaughan.[1] He reunited with Quincy Jones when Jones asked him to do some arranging for studio sessions.[1] Creed Taylor, producer and founder of CTI Records, was at the sessions and hired James to work for CTI as a producer, arranger, and studio musician.[1] In the 1970s, James worked on albums by Gabor Szabo, Milt Jackson, Stanley Turrentine, Grover Washington, Jr., and Maynard Ferguson.[6]\n\nSolo albums and collaborations\n\n[edit]\n\nCreed Taylor invited James to record a solo album. The result, One (CTI, 1974), contained the song \"Feel Like Making Love\", with which Roberta Flack had already had a hit. James had been hired to play piano for the song on Roberta Flack's album two weeks before recording a version of his own, using the same band. Radio stations played both and contributed to the commercial success of One.[6] The album was notable for adapting classical music to a modern-day scene, e.g. \"In The Garden\" was based on Pachelbel's Canon in D and \"Night on Bald Mountain\" was a cover of Modest Mussorgsky's composition of the same name.\n\nAfter three solo albums, James founded his own record label, Tappan Zee. Immediately thereafter, he cut a disco version of the Theme to Star Trek: The Motion Picture, a 45 of which was included with the soundtrack LP, and recorded the album Touchdown (Tappan Zee, 1978).[8] Among the songs on the album was \"Angela\", the theme song for the TV show Taxi. James provided all the music for Taxi and collected some of its music, including \"Angela\", on The Genie: Themes & Variations from the TV Series Taxi (1983).[9] When he toured in 1979, he was supported by a marketing campaign that included posters of him at the wheel of a New York yellow cab. The performances were documented on the album All Around the Town (Tappan Zee, 1980), with a cover of James at the wheel of a taxi.\n\nJames turned from smooth jazz to classical music to record Rameau (1984), his interpretations of Baroque-period composer Jean-Philippe Rameau.[10] In later albums, he interpreted the work of two more Baroque composers, J. S. Bach and Domenico Scarlatti.\n\nA year after Rameau, he collaborated with David Sanborn on Double Vision (Warner Bros, 1986). The album won a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Fusion Performance.[11] His collaboration with Earl Klugh, One on One, won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance in 1980 and has sold over one million copies. Another collaboration with Klugh, Cool, (Warner Bros., 1992) was nominated for a Grammy, as was Joined at the Hip (Warner Bros., 1996) with Kirk Whalum, recorded Flesh and Bone in 1995 and another solo album, Joyride (Warner Bros., 1999). Joined at the Hip will be reissued with a 2019 Remaster on evosound.\n\nFourplay\n\n[edit]\n\nJames was looking for a bass player while recording the album Grand Piano Canyon (Warner Bros., 1990) with drummer Harvey Mason and guitarist Lee Ritenour. Mason and Ritenour suggested Nathan East. After working with them for a while, James suggested they form a band, which resulted in the contemporary jazz quartet Fourplay. The band has recorded over ten albums and has seen a couple of personnel changes, with guitarist Larry Carlton replacing Ritenour and then Chuck Loeb replacing Carlton.[6] Fourplay celebrated its 25th anniversary with the album Silver (Heads Up, 2015).[12]\n\nInfluence in hip hop\n\n[edit]\n\nJames's music, especially his early albums, has been sampled often, with his songs \"Nautilus\" and \"Take Me to the Mardi Gras\" leading the field.[8][13]\n\nSelected songs that use James’s music\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Nautilus\" was sampled by Eric B. & Rakim in \"Let the Rhythm Hit 'em\", Run-D.M.C.'s \"Beats to the Rhyme\", Ghostface Killah's \"Daytona 500\",[14] DJ Jazzy Jeff's \"Jazzie's Groove\", Jeru the Damaja's \"My Mind Spray\", Freddie Gibbs's \"Extradite\", and \"Farandole (L'Arlesienne Suite No. 2)\". It appears on the Funcrusher Plus LP from Company Flow and Nangdo's \"Nikes\". The bassline from \"Nautilus\" appears in \"Children's Story\" by Slick Rick.\n\n\"Take Me to the Mardi Gras\" incorporates in its first four measures a bell-and-drum pattern that is one of hip hop's basic break beats. It has been sampled by Crash Crew's \"Breaking Bells (Take Me to the Mardi Gras)\", Run-D.M.C.'s \"Peter Piper\", the Beastie Boys' \"Hold it Now, Hit it\", Missy Elliott's \"Work It\", will.i.am's \"I Got it from My Mama\", \"This Is Me (Urban Remix)\" by Dream, \"I Want You\" by Common, and \"Take It Back\" by Wu-Tang Clan.\n\n\"Westchester Lady\" was sampled by DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince in \"Here We Go Again\", as well as by DJ T-Rock and Squashy Nice in their song \"Evolution\".\n\nJames's 1981 song \"Sign of the Times\" was sampled by Warren G and Nate Dogg in their 1994 single \"Regulate\".\n\nHis 1980 song \"Snowbird Fantasy\" was sampled by French house musician and Le Knight Club member Eric Chedeville, also Known as \"Rico the Wizard\", in his 2009 single \"Spell of Love\", which was remixed later by DJ Sneak.\n\nThe track \"Tappan Zee\", an ode to James' record label of the same name, was sampled in Arrested Development's \"People Everyday (Metamorphis Remix)\".\n\nIn the past, James has stated that he had \"a lot of respect\" for the creative process of hip hop production, only being unhappy when his music was plagiarized or illegally sampled.[15] James has begun to sample his own music, as shown on the composition \"Submarine\".[16] He has also been collaborating in recent years with DJ Jazzy Jeff, Ghostface Killah, 9th Wonder, and Slick Rick.[17]\n\nAwards and honors\n\n[edit]\n\nGrammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance, with Earl Klugh, One on One (1979)\n\nGrammy Award for Best Jazz Fusion Performance, Vocal or Instrumental, with David Sanborn, Double Vision (1986)[18]\n\nGrammy nomination, Cool with Earl Klugh (1992)\n\nGrammy nomination, Joined at the Hip with Kirk Whalum (1996)\n\nGrammy nomination, Joyride (1999)\n\nGeorge Benson Lifetime Achievement Award (2006)\n\nGrammy nomination for Best Pop Instrumental, \"Fortune Teller\" by Fourplay (2008)\n\nInternational Achievement Award, State of Michigan (2008)\n\nBest Group of the Year nomination, American Smooth Jazz Awards, Fourplay (2010)\n\nGrammy nomination for Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella, \"Ghost of a Chance\" (2016)[19]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\nAs leader\n\n[edit]\n\nBold Conceptions (Mercury, 1963) – rec. 1962\n\nExplosions (ESP Disk, 1965)\n\nOne (CTI, 1974; Tappan Zee/Columbia, 1981)\n\nTwo (CTI, 1975; Tappan Zee/Columbia, 1981)\n\nThree (CTI, 1976; Tappan Zee/Columbia, 1981) – rec. 1975–76\n\nBJ4 (CTI, 1977; Tappan Zee/Columbia, 1981) – rec. 1976\n\nHeads (Tappan Zee/Columbia, 1977)\n\nTouchdown (Tappan Zee/Columbia, 1978)\n\nLucky Seven (Tappan Zee/Columbia, 1979)\n\nOne on One with Earl Klugh (Tappan Zee/Columbia, 1979)\n\nH (Tappan Zee/Columbia, 1980)\n\nAll Around the Town (Tappan Zee/Columbia, 1981)[2LP] – live\n\nSign of the Times (Tappan Zee/Columbia, 1981)\n\nHands Down (Tappan Zee/Columbia, 1982)\n\nTwo of a Kind with Earl Klugh (Capitol, 1982)\n\nThe Genie: Themes & Variations from the TV Series \"Taxi\" (Tappan Zee/Columbia, 1983)\n\nFoxie (Tappan Zee/Columbia, 1983)\n\nRameau (CBS Masterworks, 1984)\n\n12 (Tappan Zee/Columbia, 1984)\n\nThe Swan (Tappan Zee/CBS/Sony [jp], 1984)\n\nDouble Vision with David Sanborn (Warner Bros., 1986)\n\nObsession (Warner Bros., 1986)\n\nThe Scarlatti Dialogues (CBS Masterworks, 1988)\n\nIvory Coast (Warner Bros., 1988)\n\nConcertos for Two & Three Keyboards with Guher Pekinel (CBS Masterworks, 1989)\n\nGrand Piano Canyon (Warner Bros., 1990)\n\nCool with Earl Klugh (Warner Bros., 1992)\n\nRestless (Warner Bros., 1994)\n\nFlesh and Blood with Hilary James (Warner Bros., 1995)\n\nStraight Up (Warner Bros., 1996) – rec. 1995\n\nJoined at the Hip with Kirk Whalum (Warner Bros., 1996)\n\nPlayin' Hooky (Warner Bros., 1997)\n\nJoy Ride (Warner Bros., 1999)\n\nDancing on the Water (Warner Bros., 2001)\n\nMorning, Noon & Night (Warner Bros., 2002)\n\nTake It from the Top (Koch, 2004)\n\nUrban Flamingo (Koch, 2006)\n\nAngels of Shanghai (Koch, 2007)\n\nChristmas Eyes with Hilary James (Koch, 2008)\n\nBotero with Jack Lee (VideoArts [jp], 2009)\n\nJust Friends with Howard Paul (BJHP Music, 2011)\n\nAltair & Vega with Keiko Matsui (eOne Music, 2012)\n\nQuartette Humaine with David Sanborn (OKeh/Sony Masterworks, 2013)\n\nAlone: Kaleidoscope by Solo Piano (Red River, 2013)\n\nThe New Cool with Nathan East (Yamaha, 2015)\n\nLive at Milliken Auditorium (Tappan Zee, 2015)\n\nEspresso (Evosound, 2018)[20]\n\nOnce Upon a Time: The Lost 1965 New York Studio Sessions (Resonance, 2020)\n\nOn Vacation with Till Brönner (Sony Masterworks, 2020)\n\nFeel Like Making Live! with Billy Kilson and Michael Palazzolo (Evosound, 2022)\n\nSingles\n\n\"Nautilus\" b/w \"Submarine (Remix)\" (RSD Exclusive/Limited Edition 7\" Vinyl Single) (Evosound, 2020)\n\nWith Fourplay\n\n[edit]\n\nFourplay (Warner Bros., 1991) – rec. 1990–91\n\nBetween the Sheets (Warner Bros., 1993)\n\nElixir (Warner Bros., 1995)\n\n4 (Warner Bros., 1998)\n\nSnowbound (Warner Bros., 1999)\n\nYes, Please!
