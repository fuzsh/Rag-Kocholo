        "text": "Whenever I want to fall asleep I simply put on a CD by Bob James and drift off to dream land. The entire band really knows how to work together to create something truly magically and Bob is one of the best piano players still alive today. He is a master of creating feelings through music and his timing is the best that you will see in music today. He takes Jazz with his piano and makes it into something that even the staunchest of Jazz detractors can't help but enjoy the sound. It's almost as if Bob is talking through his music as he plays and I really enjoyed the fact that he was constantly smiling and laughing toward the crowd as he played. Additionally, during each one of his key strokes he would move and make hand gestures to the sound and incumbent of the music as if to draw a picture of what he was feeling to the audience as he was playing. The fact that I saw Bob use no sheet music at all is a testament to his extreme skill not only as an artist, but as a piano player. The fact that he is able to play every song from his many albums without difficulty or reference is truly an amazing sight to see. The crowd was so silent during each one of his songs that I swear if someone had dropped a small pen you could hear it echo through the whole building. I didn't hear a person so much as cough or sneeze until the song was done.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nThis ranks as one of the best jazz performances I've ever witnessed! At 78 years old, Bob had as much - if not more - energy as his sidemen and kept up that energy throughout the entire set. Speaking of the sidemen, they were phenomenal. The bass player looked like he couldn't have been more than 25 years old, but he had the chops of a seasoned jazz performer. The drummer was a beast! He was precise, deeply musical and a thrill to watch.\n\nWhile Bob is known in many circles as a smooth jazz artist, don't let that label fool you. This was a smoldering jazz trio who cooked from beginning to end. If he brings the band to your town, do yourself a favor and go see them. A night to remember.\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate\n\nBob James at Jazz Cafe, Camden London, 2nd May 2018\n\nJazz cafe is a nightclub where you stand to see the act\n\nBy the time bob James came on at 9:30 we had already been standing for 2.5 hours,long leg aching Hours. We forgot all that pain as he bounced onstage and gave us 90 minutes of spellbinding Jazz, playing both old tunes and showcasing some from his up coming album, his piano trio played with aplomb. We left exhilarated by the group with aching legs and a wish that next time bob comes to London he chooses a venue with seats!\n\nRead more\n\nReport as inappropriate"
