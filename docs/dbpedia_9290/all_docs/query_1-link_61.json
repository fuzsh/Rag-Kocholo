        "text": "180g Vinyl Double LP!\n\nTAS Rated 3.5/5 Music, 4.5/5 Sonics in the May/June 2022 Issue of The Absolute Sound!\n\nIn the eyes of the rap generation, an older musician's hipness is often defined by how many times he or she has been sampled for beats and breaks. That means that keyboard wizard Bob James - whose records have been sampled a staggering 1,435 times, according to the website WhoSampled.Com - is a bona fide legend and cooler than cool. Although he's just celebrated his 81st birthday, Bob James is not about to close the piano lid for the last time and embrace retirement.\n\nAlongside the same trio, bassist Michael Palazzolo and drummer Billy Kilson, that made 2018's critically-acclaimed Espresso album, Feel Like Making Live! captures James performing a career-spanning selection of material live in the studio. Feel Like Making Live! includes James's most well known hits like \"Angela\", \"Maputo\", \"Westchester Lady\" and \"Nautilus\", as well as an instrumental cover of Elton John's \"Rocket Man\".\n\nThis New Jazz Trio live-studio recording is released on a 180-gram black double vinyl LP.\n\nFeel Like Making Live! is smooth jazz front to back. From the opening cut ('Angela,' better known as the theme song to Taxi) to the closer ('Westchester Lady,' which originally paired James with Grover Washington), the Bob James Trio delivers the aural equivalent of comfort food, with performances as polished as the recording, which warrants very high marks for its clarity, dynamic range, and immediacy.\n\n-Jeff Wilson, The Absolute Sound, May/June 2022, Music 3.5/5, Sonics 4.5/5\n\nFeatures\n\n180g Vinyl\n\nDouble LP\n\nHi-Res Audiophile Black Vinyl\n\nLive studio recording\n\nGatefold jacket\n\nMusicians\n\nBob James piano Michael Palazzolo bass Billy Kilson drums"
