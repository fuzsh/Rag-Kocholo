        "text": "New York’s Blue Note Jazz Club announces an important run of Talib Kweli (one half of iconic duo Black Star) shows alongside heavily-sampled jazz pioneer Bob James. Taking place this February 7-9, the shows promise to be the can’t-miss kick-off to 2023’s 50th Anniversary of Hip-Hop celebrations. Living legends Rakim, DMC and Slick Rick, who will receive a Lifetime Achieve Award from The Recording Academy next month, are confirmed as special guests joining this culture-filled run. Slick Rick, Talib Kweli and Bob James performed together for the first time last year at Blue Note.\n\nWatch footage of Talib Kweli, Bob James and Slick Rick’s\n\n2022 Blue Note performance here:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CZKkELYJdPA\n\n“I’m very happy for this opportunity to join up with my friend Talib Kweli to perform with Slick Rick again on the Blue Note stage,” states Bob James. “We had so much fun last year, and I'm excited to have legendary artists DMC and Rakim join us this time around to revisit the past and make new history together.”\n\n“The re-joining of forces at Blue Note between icon Bob James and Talib Kweli with legends Rakim, Slick Rick and DMC is an exceptional moment,” states Blue Note Director of Programming Alex Kurland. “Bob James' depth of history and contribution to hip hop and musical culture is remarkable. Our inspiration with these shows is to revisit that history and vibe through the samples originating from Bob James, in collaboration with three of the most prolific, powerhouse and pioneering MCs of all time who have a legendary connection of drawing from Bob's music.”\n\n18-time Grammy-Nominated artist Bob James forever cemented his place in hip-hop history with the release of his 1974 album One. The groove-heavy closing track “Nautilus,” featuring James on keyboard, Gary King on bass, and Idris Muhammad on drums, is one of the most sampled and interpolated songs of all time, beginning with Ultramagnetic MC’s using the bassline in their 1986 single “Bait.” In 1988, elements of the song found their way into Run DMC’s “Beats To The Rhyme” and Eric B & Rakim’s “Follow The Leader.” Slick Rick then famously used “Nautilus” as the backbone to his groundbreaking single “Children’s Story.” The list of artists who have since sampled or interpolated “Nautilus” is a who’s who of hip-hop history: 9th Wonder, A Tribe Called Quest, Ghostface Killah, Jeru the Damaja, Wu-Tang Clan, Pete Rock & C.L. Smooth, Big L, El-P, Onyx, Ice T, Wale, The Game, EARTHGANG, Yung Lean, Salt-N-Peppa, and dozens more."
