        "text": "Description\n\nOne of the unexpected paths James takes on his new album, \"Jazz Hands\", that might surprise a few of his older fans is his collaboration with the legendary hip-hop turntablist and producer DJ Jazzy Jeff. Best remembered for his partnership with the rapper Will Smith in the duo DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince, the duo won the first rap Grammy as well as scoring some big pop hits back in the day, including their 1987 smash, \"A Touch Of Jazz,\" which famously sampled Bob James' classic track \"Westchester Lady.\"\n\nIn a full circle moment, James and Jeff have joined forces on the tune \"That Bop,\" a thumping dance track overlain with elegant piano hooks. \"It was fun to work with him so many years after he had sampled me in the past,\" says James, who reveals they collaborated by sharing music files across the internet during the pandemic. \"We also did a couple of other tunes that may see the light of day soon,\" discloses James, who is keen to work with the hip-hop legend again. \"I hope the next time we'll actually be in the studio at the same time so that we can interact,\" he says. The B-side features Bob James' original jazz-funk classic and DJ favorite, \"Shamboozie\", available for the first time on 7\" vinyl.\n\nReleased by evosound on a 7\" Vinyl Single on the 6th of October, 2023. Limited Edition of 1,200 copies worldwide."
