Check out these videos as three master pianists talk about the impact music has had on their lives.\n\nMichael McDonald\n\n“I believe that making waves is something that every single human being does, in ways they maybe don’t even imagine,” says superstar singer/pianist Michael McDonald. “The simple act of love and kindness ripples out, and music is just another form of that. Music and art are what truly make us human.”\n\nBob James\n\n“You don’t have to use any words to have an emotional experience with music,” observes jazz pianist and arranger Bob James. “I can go to any country in the world and if I go to a piano and play notes, I can speak to [my audience] in this unique way with sound: it’s its own language.”\n\nJon McLaughlin\n\n“Music helps me be empathetic,” pianist/songwriter Jon McLaughlin says. “It helps me understand someone else, understand myself, and feel connected. With everything I do, I want to be creating a positive wave.”\n\nLooking for more inspiration? Check out this video:"
