        "text": "Saxophonist David Sanborn has won six Grammy Awards and made eight gold-selling albums in his career.\n\nSt. Cecilia Music Center\n\nWhat: Great Artist Concert\n\nGuest artists: Pianist Bob James, saxophonist David Sanborn\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Thursday Oct. 24, 2013\n\nWhere: 24 Ransom Ave. NE\n\nTickets: $75 for the concert and post-concert reception; $250 for a pre-concert dinner, concert and reception\n\nCall: St. Cecilia Music Center at 616-459-2224\n\nGRAND RAPIDS, MI – Their debut album won a Grammy Award and sold over a million copies but not a single concert ticket.\n\nKeyboardist Bob James and alto saxophonist David Sanborn, with “Double Vision” behind them, would have been a promoter’s dream come true.\n\nYet James, who wrote well-known theme for the TV show “Taxi,” and Sanborn, who played at Woodstock, had no plans tour after recording their highly successful album in 1986.\n\nNo plans until now.\n\nJames and Sanborn will be in Grand Rapids this week for St. Cecilia Music Center's Great Artist Concert.\n\nThe duo’s appearance is for St. Cecilia’s annual Great Artist Series, a fundraising concert with a major artist, to raise money for the organization’s programs and to maintain its 19th century building.\n\n\"Either of these artists would be Great Artist contenders as solo performers,\" said St. Cecilia Music Center executive director Cathy Holbrook. \"But St. Cecilia was able to secure a date with both of them on the same bill, performing together, as they tour to support a new album.\"\n\nSome 27 years after the release of their first album, James and Sanborn returned to the studio to record \"Quartette Humaine,\" which debuted earlier this year.\n\nTheir appearance in Grand Rapids is the first date on tour that begins in the United States with several shows before heading overseas for a longer European tour along with bassist James Genus and drummer Steve Gadd.\n\n“Double Vision” was a surprise success even for its creators.\n\n“It always was conceived as a special project,” Sanborn said. “Both Bob and I had very full careers at that point.”\n\nSaxophonist David Sanborn, longtime host of his own syndicated radio show, \"The Jazz Show with David Sanborn, was developing a TV show as well. The short-lived \"Night Music\" aired on NBC from 1988-89.\n\nPianist Bob James, whose instrumental \"Angela\" was a hit from \"Taxi,\" was busy as an arranger and artist in his own right.\n\n“We kind of regretted it,” Sanborn said.\n\nYears later, James and Sanborn played live together at the Tokyo Jazz Festival, and they rediscovered the thrill of making music together.\n\n“We had such a great time, we thought, we have to make a record,” Sanborn said.\n\nLast year, James and Sanborn finally returned to the studio in mid-December to record “Quartette Humaine,” an all-acoustic album of jazz.\n\nThe inspiration for the album was by the music of Dave Brubeck, legendary jazz pianist and composer, who fronted the Dave Brubeck Quartet but who enjoyed a longtime partnership with alto saxophonist Paul Desmond.\n\n“Brubeck always was our kind of model,” Sanborn said. “Not so much a direct influence, but in the more abstract sense of taking some of the interplay that Dave and Paul had and taking our cue from that.”\n\nThe inspiration soon would become even deeper and more poignant.\n\n“It was ironic,” Sanborn said. “One of the first days in the studio, Dave passed away.”\n\nBoth James and Sanborn contributed original material on “Quartette Humaine,”\n\n“I think Bob more overtly paid tribute to Dave with a couple of songs,” Sanborn said.\n\nJames, 73, as an artist, is known for his collaborations with Earl Klugh, including a 1980 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance for “One On One,” which has sold over a million copies. The pioneer of the smooth jazz movement also is a member of the celebrated jazz group, Fourplay.\n\nSanborn, 68, winner of six Grammy Awards, with eight gold-selling albums to his credit, is best known for his years in rhythm and blues, but traditional jazz always has been a part of his repertoire.\n\n“It’s just I became more known for my R&B and pop,” said Sanborn, who recorded the theme for the TV drama show “L.A. Law” on NBC-TV. “When you make a record, you always need to have a singular point of view. The records I was making under my own name were things that had a pop and R&B point of view.”\n\n“The ironic thing is, I was hugely influenced by Paul – his lyricism and his humor,” Sanborn said. “It was very singular and very unique.”\n\n“In terms of sound, I was more drawn to a harder-edged sound.”\n\nTheir show in Grand Rapids – their only Midwest stop on this tour – will include some material from “Double Vision” as well as from “Quartette Humaine.”\n\nThe pair usually plays “Maputo.”\n\n“That was the unexpected hit, the break out song from that album.”\n\nOne song that shouldn’t be expected is “Angela,” from “Taxi.”\n\n“I don’t think Bob avoids it,” Sanborn said. “Just in this context, it’s didn’t necessarily fit.”"
