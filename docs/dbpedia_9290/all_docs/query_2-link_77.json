In addition to his psychology practice, Bob also provides diversity training to business, universities and other organizations. His work is informed by his training and his participation in the service and community-building activities of the Baha'i community. Bob's uncle was the first Baha'i of the family. He embraced the Baha'i teachings in 1934, after meeting the celebrated Baha'i teacher Louis Gregory, and more than 40 other relatives later also joined the Baha'i community."
