        "text": "Robert (Bob) James Dolan, Jr., 60, passed away at his home in Largo, Florida surrounded by friends and family on May 25, 2019. He was born in New Haven, Connecticut and had been a long-time resident in Florida.\n\nHe loved sports all his life, played baseball as a kid and had skills and ability to play pro ball; but, life didn’t take him in that direction. He went into the United States Navy and served more than 20 plus years in Active Service. He was an Aviation Electrician’s Mate Petty Officer 1st Class. (AE1). He worked on F-14 systems. The Navy took him to many places and he retired from the Navy October 31, 2000.\n\nFollowing his retirement, Bob continued to travel. His four-legged canine sidekick, Rocky, was always with him. They could often be seen at the dog park or traveling together with Rocky riding shot gun. He loved to camp, and would load up his tent and hit the road.\n\nBob’s greatest joy was family. He enjoyed being the loveable and fun Uncle Bobby to his nieces and nephews. His favorite sports teams were the San Diego Padres and the Chargers and he enjoyed attending their Spring Training games. Anyone who knew Bob, knew he loved food and if it he could use a coupon or go on half price day, it was even better. He loved a bargain, and while he would call himself cheap, he had a very generous heart. He gave of his time, volunteering at the USO and participating in ALS walks, when his health permitted, to honor the memory of his brother Mark and his mom.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents, oldest brother Mark and 2 sisters, Katheryn Crown and Elizabeth Boyd. He is survived by brothers’ Sean Dolan, Harold (Doc) Dolan, a sister, Margaret (Maggie) King and 7 nieces and nephews.\n\nA service with Military Honors will be take place at Bay Pines National Cemetery at 3:00PM on Friday, May 31, 2019. The cemetery is located at 10000 Bay Pines Blvd, St. Petersburg, Florida, 33708."
