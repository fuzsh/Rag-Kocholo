        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio - The 45th Tri-C JazzFest got underway on Thursday night with a show by the acapella group Take 6, but Friday and Saturday is when Playhouse Square really comes alive with full evenings filled with the sounds of live jazz and music from around the country and the world.\n\nOn Friday night, there were four concerts: the pianist Jason Moran and The Bandwagon, singer-composer Cecile McLorin Salvant, the double-shot of living legends Marcus Miller and Bob James and the funky sounds of the organ-led group Scary Goldings.\n\nBob James has been writing, recording and performing for more than 60 years. Across those decades, he has made jazz and classical a part of the supergroup fOURPLAY’s cool melodic sounds. His playing has been a major influence on what’s known as smooth jazz, and he has influenced countless keyboardists.\n\nFriday night, James, resplendent in loose pants with an exciting pattern emblazoned on them, brought his current batch of young talented players: drummer James Adkins, bassist Michael Palazzolo and saxophonist Andrey Chmut, who is from Kyiv, Ukraine. The crowd gave Chmut a standing ovation after James told a story about recording with Chmut and dropping him off at the airport, only to discover upon returning home that Russia had invaded Chmut’s homeland that very same day.\n\nThe acoustic band was indeed pretty smooth but also quietly fiery. The acoustic take on Chmut’s solo tune “Moving Forward,” with its gentle melody and a light R&B groove, featured a classical-infused solo from James with spinning exploratory, delicate arpeggiated variations on the song and a heartfelt solo from the demonstrative Chmut, who again got the crowd on its feet.\n\nJames performed a lovely, seemingly through-composed solo piece, then quickly transitioned into a spiky take on Duke Ellington’s standard “Caravan,” featuring a hot staccato solo from Palazzolo, which drew whoops from the packed room, and drummer Adkins, who used every inch of his drums and cymbals to deftly switch from traditional swinging to complex splashy syncopated fills and back again.\n\nJames also gave the excited crowd some of the hits. His oft-sampled 1974 hit, “Westchester Lady,” was played with an up-tempo groove, with the band members trading solos, following and leading each other melodically, making for one of the highlights of the evening.\n\nThat highlight was quickly matched with the set ending “Angela (Theme from “Taxi”), which was played softer than the familiar recording, with James pulling the melody apart and Palazzolo showing his softer side with a calm melodic solo that again excited the crowd. The spry, 84-year-old James has a quartet that matches its leader’s calm and positive energy, and after the show, he and much of the band signed copies of his Grammy-nominated 2023 album “Jazz Hands.”\n\nBassist, composer, producer Marcus Miller, whose resume includes writing, producing and playing with Miles Davis, David Sanborn, James and hundreds of others, brought his own fiery and funky quintet to close the show.\n\nThe svelte sexagenarian, wearing his signature porkpie hat, quickly upped the evening’s funk quotient with the thumping opener “Panther,” featuring Miller’s bag of bass tricks from percussive slapping to melodic slapping, fancy hammer-ons and fleet-fingered runs on his signature Fender jazz bass.\n\nMiller’s roots are in jazz, but he has always drawn from the entirety of black music, and R&B and funk and hip hop. The burbling groove of “Untamed” from his most recent studio album, 2018′s “Laid Back,” had heads bobbing and let the band members stretch out.\n\nTrumpeter Russell Gunn’s bluesy muted solo gave way, while Miller worked the melody and drummer Anwar Marshall flipped the groove and beat inside out. Alto saxophonist Donald Hayes unleashed one of his many heated and physical solos, drawing vocal approval from the crowd.\n\nMiller told a sweet story about his South African-born mother-in-law, nicknamed Bunny, as an intro to the pretty, gentle South African groove of “Sublimity (Bunny’s Dream),” with a cool coda that saw Miller and Hayes trading fours and Miller playing some lovely harmonics, matched and varied by Hayes.\n\nJames and Chmut returned to the stage for an extended take on “Maputo” a song Miller wrote for James’ popular, Grammy-winning 1986 duet album with David Sanborn, “Double Vision” and played in the late alto sax legend’s honor.\n\nThe band took the mostly mellow tune and funked it up. The saxophonists “tried to take each other’s heads off,” as Miller said, as they dueled, and prompted and prodded each other with funky and bluesy phrases and high notes. Then James, with Rhodes and Miller, traded solos with the latter dropping a little “Westchester Lady” into his solo.\n\nMiller also praised Cleveland’s own Tommy LiPuma, the longtime producer and Tri-C’s Jazz Fest champion for whom the school’s Creative Center of Arts was named. Miller asked how much time was left. He was told they had about 10 minutes. He replied, “cool, that means we can play another ... 30.”\n\nAnd they nearly did, stretching out on “Mr. Pastorius,” written by Miller and recorded and later performed by Miles Davis. Gunn again worked his mute before the band’s members settled into some of the the most traditional jazz swing of the evening; they shifted the tempo, doubling, then slowing it and finally closing with an incredible solo coda from Gunn.\n\nThe show closed with a hard funk jam, giving Miller space for one more extended flashy display of his melodic and percussive style before ending a solid 20 minutes late, with no complaints from the crowd."
