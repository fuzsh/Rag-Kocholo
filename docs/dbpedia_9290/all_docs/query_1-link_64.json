        "text": "About Raymond James\n\nIn 1962, Bob James set out to build a different kind of financial services firm – one that put people, planning and principles first. And now, more than 60 years later, Bob’s different kind of firm is one of the leading independent financial services companies in the United States.\n\nRaymond James has grown to become a well-respected, widely recognized multinational firm with distinct business units that serve a variety of clients, from individuals and small business owners to municipalities and major corporations.\n\nRaymond James is committed to diversity and inclusion – to foster an environment where everyone feels valued and everyone can prosper, throughout the firm as well as the communities it serves.\n\nMilestone spotlight\n\nOctober 19, 1987: Black Monday. While other firms closed their trading desks to minimize internal losses, Raymond James kept its desks open to meet clients’ needs. Because of Raymond James’ agency-based business model and commitment to client service, this was our first, last and only unprofitable quarter since the firm went public.\n\nWe can be sure the markets will change over the next 25 years, and that our industry and firm will continue to evolve. What won’t change is our commitment to the values that have driven our success.\n\nBy the numbers*\n\n146 consecutive quarters of profitability1\n\nApproximately 8,800 financial advisors\n\nApproximately $1.48 trillion in total client assets\n\nStable outlook credit ratings of A-, A- and A3 from Fitch, S&P and Moody’s2\n\nIt’s been our privilege for more than 60 years to support the goals of our clients and to give back to the communities in which we live and work – and we look forward to continuing to do so for many, many years to come. To take a “scroll” down memory lane, explore our history at raymondjames.com.\n\n*As of 6/30/2024\n\n1Past performance is not indicative of future results.
