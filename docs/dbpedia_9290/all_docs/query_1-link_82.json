From his first days in Marshall, Missouri, the music of Bob James has captivated audiences throughout the world. In 2022, Bob James released the album ‘Feel Like Making Live!” to rave reviews, and James' 2023 album, 'Jazz Hands', was been Nominated for a 2024 GRAMMY® Award for \"Best Contemporary Instrumental Album\"! AMAZING!!\n\n𝐃𝐢𝐬𝐜𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐞𝐝 𝐛𝐲 𝐐𝐮𝐢𝐧𝐜𝐲 𝐉𝐨𝐧𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐍𝐨𝐭𝐫𝐞 𝐃𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐉𝐚𝐳𝐳 𝐅𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐚𝐥 𝐢𝐧 𝟏𝟗𝟔𝟑, 𝐉𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐞𝐝 𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐨 𝐚𝐥𝐛𝐮𝐦, '𝐁𝐨𝐥𝐝 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐩𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬', 𝐭𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐌𝐞𝐫𝐜𝐮𝐫𝐲 𝐑𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐬. 60+ albums and innumerable awards would follow through five decades. He honed his skills working with Creed Taylor, working on albums for artists like Hank Crawford, Grover Washington, Jr, among others. While with CTI, James found great popular success overseeing significant hits for Paul Simon, Neil Diamond, Maynard Ferguson, and Kenny Loggins.\n\n𝐈𝐧 𝟏𝟗𝟕𝟒, 𝐉𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐞𝐝 𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐚𝐥𝐛𝐮𝐦, '𝐎𝐧𝐞', 𝐰𝐡𝐢𝐜𝐡 𝐥𝐚𝐮𝐧𝐜𝐡𝐞𝐝 𝐚 𝐥𝐢𝐟𝐞𝐥𝐨𝐧𝐠 𝐜𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐫 𝐨𝐟 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐥𝐢𝐯𝐞. After three more albums, James began his own label, Tappan Zee Records. This allowed James to spend more time in the studio, focusing on his own creative works. It was during this time that he recorded his own Gold-Selling album, 'Touchdown', which included his composition, “Angela”, the instrumental theme from the sitcom Taxi, and possibly James’ best known work. Bob composed all the original music used in that television series for its entire run!\n\n𝐉𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐬’ 𝐚𝐥𝐛𝐮𝐦, '𝐎𝐧𝐞 𝐎𝐧 𝐎𝐧𝐞', 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐢𝐫𝐬𝐭 𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐫𝐞𝐞 𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐄𝐚𝐫𝐥 𝐊𝐥𝐮𝐠𝐡, 𝐰𝐨𝐧 𝐚 𝐆𝐑𝐀𝐌𝐌𝐘® 𝐀𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐢𝐧 𝟏𝟗𝟖𝟎 𝐟𝐨𝐫 \"𝐁𝐞𝐬𝐭 𝐏𝐨𝐩 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐚𝐥 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞\", 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐡𝐚𝐬 𝐬𝐨𝐥𝐝 𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫 𝐚 𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐜𝐨𝐩𝐢𝐞𝐬. During this time, James set the standard for the smooth jazz sound in the late 1970s. In 1985, James moved to Warner Bros Records, and kicked things off with 'Double Vision', a collaboration with David Sanborn. 'Double Vision' was another GRAMMY® Award-Winner, selling over a million albums.\n\n𝐖𝐡𝐢𝐥𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐡𝐢𝐬 𝐚𝐥𝐛𝐮𝐦, '𝐆𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐏𝐢𝐚𝐧𝐨 𝐂𝐚𝐧𝐲𝐨𝐧' 𝐢𝐧 𝟏𝟗𝟗𝟎, 𝐉𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐮𝐧𝐢𝐭𝐞𝐝 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐥𝐨𝐧𝐠𝐭𝐢𝐦𝐞 𝐟𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐝, 𝐝𝐫𝐮𝐦𝐦𝐞𝐫 𝐇𝐚𝐫𝐯𝐞𝐲 𝐌𝐚𝐬𝐨𝐧, 𝐉𝐫.

This would be the start of something beautiful, as these early sessions ignited a spark which would engulf the Jazz world as FOURPLAY. Fourplay’s first album was recorded and released in 1991, entitled 'Fourplay', sold over a million copies and remained at the #1 position on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz Chart for 33 weeks. Their next album, 'Between the Sheets' (1993), reached #1, went Gold, and received a GRAMMY® Award Nomination. In 1995, their third gold album, 'Elixir', also reached the #1 position and remained on the chart for more than 90 weeks. The group would collaborate until 1998 when Ritenour left and Larry Carlton took over. This version of Fourplay continued the group’s huge success for seven more albums. After 12 years, Carlton decided to delve further into his solo career, and the band brought in guitarist Chuck Loeb in 2010.\n\n𝐉𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐬 𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐮𝐞𝐝 𝐜𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐚𝐛𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐨𝐧 𝐬𝐞𝐩𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞 𝐩𝐫𝐨𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐬 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐄𝐚𝐫𝐥 𝐊𝐥𝐮𝐠𝐡, ('𝐂𝐨𝐨𝐥' 𝐢𝐧 𝟏𝟗𝟗𝟐) 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐊𝐢𝐫𝐤 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐥𝐮𝐦 ('𝐉𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐝 𝐀𝐭 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐇𝐢𝐩' 𝐢𝐧 𝟏𝟗𝟗𝟔). Both albums were Nominated for GRAMMY® Awards. His solo career continued throughout the 90’s, culminating with 'Joy Ride' in 1999, garnering him another GRAMMY® Award Nomination.\n\n𝐈𝐧 𝟐𝟎𝟎𝟏, '𝐃𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐎𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐖𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐫', 𝐰𝐚𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐝, 𝐨𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐚𝐠𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐬𝐡𝐨𝐰𝐜𝐚𝐬𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐉𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐬’ 𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐲. The album includes performances with Keiko Matsui, Joe Sample, Dave Holland, and Chuck Loeb. Fourplay released 'Heartfelt' in 2002, and spent much of the year touring across the globe. That same year, James released 'Morning, Noon, & Night', whose title track went to #1 in Contemporary Jazz Radio.\n\n𝐉𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐬 𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐲𝐞𝐝 𝐛𝐮𝐬𝐲 𝐢𝐧 𝟐𝟎𝟎𝟔, releasing 'Urban Flamingo' in February, and on April 7, was awarded the \"George Benson Lifetime Achievement Award\" by the Canadian Smooth Jazz Awards. Summer saw the release of Fourplay’s tenth record, appropriately called 'X'. This tour literally took James around the world again with stops in Spain, London, California, Hong Kong, Japan, Kuala Lumpur, and Indonesia.\n\n𝐈𝐧 𝟐𝟎𝟎𝟖, 𝐉𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐚 𝐂𝐡𝐫𝐢𝐬𝐭𝐦𝐚𝐬 𝐚𝐥𝐛𝐮𝐦 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐇𝐢𝐥𝐚𝐫𝐲 𝐉𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐬, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐚𝐧𝐨𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐅𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐲 𝐚𝐥𝐛𝐮𝐦 '𝐄𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐠𝐲'.

Then, in September 2011, 'Altair & Vega', the Four-Hand piano duet collaboration with Keiko Matsui, was released. Their unique collaboration, which took nearly 10 years, resulted in several memorable live tour performances, before being completed as a recorded album, along with a live performance DVD recorded at the Manchester Craftsmen’s Guild. Later that same year, James released a collaboration with Savannah guitarist Howard Paul with 'Just Friends: The Hamilton Hall Sessions'. All this, while still touring with Fourplay, including headlining the Playboy Jazz Festival at the Hollywood Bowl, and receiving the Oasis Contemporary Jazz Award for \"Group of the Year\".\n\n𝐅𝐎𝐔𝐑𝐏𝐋𝐀𝐘 𝐣𝐨𝐢𝐧𝐞𝐝 𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐜𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐠𝐚𝐢𝐧 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐟𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐲𝐞𝐚𝐫 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐨𝐟 '𝐄𝐬𝐩𝐫𝐢𝐭 𝐝𝐞 𝐅𝐨𝐮𝐫'. The album hit the charts, producing several successful tracks, including the powerful “Put Our Hearts Together”, which featured vocals by Seiko Matsuda. The song was a tribute to the regions of Japan devastated by the natural disasters just months earlier, and spawned several benefit concerts, such as the Iwate Jazz Festival, and a full-length documentary of James’ visit to the region.\n\n𝐈𝐧 𝟐𝟎𝟏𝟑, '𝐐𝐮𝐚𝐫𝐭𝐞𝐭𝐭𝐞 𝐇𝐮𝐦𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐞' 𝐰𝐚𝐬 𝐫𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐞𝐝, this was the first creative collaboration between keyboardist-composer Bob James and alto saxophonist David Sanborn since their million-selling, GRAMMY® Award-Winning album, 'Double Vision', twenty-five years ago. In 2015, James’ first live album was released, 'Live at the Milliken Auditorium', which was captured on a magical night in his hometown of Traverse City, Michigan. This same year also brought the first release from James and longtime collaborator Nathan East, 'The New Cool', a masterful work of art which truly redefines the essence of cool.\n\n𝐉𝐚𝐦𝐞𝐬 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐅𝐨𝐮𝐫𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐲 𝐚𝐥𝐬𝐨 𝐜𝐚𝐦𝐞 𝐭𝐨𝐠𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐫 𝐢𝐧 𝟐𝟎𝟏𝟓 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐫𝐞𝐥𝐞𝐚𝐬𝐞 𝐨𝐟 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐠𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐩’𝐬 𝟐𝟓𝐭𝐡 𝐚𝐧𝐧𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐚𝐫𝐲, 𝐰𝐢𝐭𝐡 '𝐒𝐢𝐥𝐯𝐞𝐫', which was recorded at old school at Sunset Sound Studios, where the group recorded their first album 25 years earlier.\n\n“𝑰𝒕'𝒔 𝑱𝒂𝒎𝒆𝒔' 𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒌 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒕𝒆𝒏𝒅𝒔 𝒕𝒐 𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒈𝒆𝒓 𝒊𝒏 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒎𝒊𝒏𝒅 𝒘𝒉𝒆𝒏 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒂𝒍𝒃𝒖𝒎 𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒄𝒉𝒆𝒔 𝒊𝒕𝒔 𝒄𝒐𝒏𝒄𝒍𝒖𝒔𝒊𝒐𝒏.
