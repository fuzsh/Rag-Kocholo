This season, Houston started all 14 games for the Bobcats, recording 76 tackles, 40 of which were solo, with 11 tackles for loss. He led the team with 5.5 sacks and had two fumble recoveries, highlighted by a 42-yard fumble recovery for a touchdown to extend Ohio's lead over Fordham (Sept. 24). Houston was a 2022 Team captain and was named Academic All-MAC. Throughout his career, Houston has been named to the All-MAC Third Team and has been an Academic All-MAC selection a total of three times.\n\n\"Bryce is a remarkable leader, student-athlete and person both on and off the field,\" said Ohio Director of Athletics Julie Cromer. \"He epitomizes the spirit of the Bob James Award and is a great representative for the Bobcats.\"\n\nAbout the Mid-American Conference\n\nThe Mid-American Conference office is based in Cleveland, Ohio as the Conference office serves 12 full-time members and offer championships in 23 sports.\n\nFounded in 1946, the Mid-American Conference is an NCAA Division I, 12-member conference that sponsors 23 championships and is one of ten members of the Football Bowl Subdivison (FBS).
