The students are nominated during the year in which they complete their final season of eligibility. The $5,000 post-graduate scholarship is awarded in honor of Bob James, the second commissioner in Mid-American Conference history (1964-71).\n\nJensen punctuated her time on at BGSU by winning the 2023 Mid-American Conference (MAC) championship, the first of her career, on beam with a personal-record score of 9.900. Jensen also finished second on vault to earn All-MAC Tournament distinction. In addition to her athletic achievements, Jensen has been named to the College Sports Communicators' Academic All-District® Team, and received Academic All-MAC Team honors on three occasions in addition to multiple WCGA (Women's Collegiate Gymnastics Association) Scholastic All-America nods. Most recently, Jensen was bestowed the Chi Alpha Sigma Nick Mourouzis Postgraduate Scholarship by the National College Athlete Honor Society. Jensen is set to use her postgraduate scholarship at Georgia Tech in pursuit of a master's degree in architecture with a concentration in high-performance building systems.\n\n“On behalf of Bowling Green State University, I want to extend our heartfelt congratulations to Taylor Jensen for being awarded one of the most prestigious individual honors presented by the Mid-American Conference,\" said Bowling Green Director of Athletics Derek van der Merwe. \"Taylor maintained a perfect 4.0 GPA during her time at BGSU and achieved a MAC championship on the balance beam this past spring. With the MAC's presentation of the Bob James Memorial Scholarship Award to her, Taylor firmly establishes her name among the many outstanding Falcons who have previously received this honor. Taylor exemplifies the qualities that we aspire for in our student-athletes, and we wholeheartedly wish her the very best as she utilizes her scholarship award at Georgia Tech, where beginning this fall she is pursuing a graduate degree in architecture.”\n\nHouston graduated with an undergraduate degree in finance with a 3.50 GPA. This season, Houston started all 14 games for the Bobcats, recording 76 tackles, 40 of which were solo, with 11 tackles for loss.
