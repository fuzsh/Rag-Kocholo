        "text": "One of the biggest stars of smooth jazz.\n\n—JazzTimes\n\nAt 84 years old, Bob James, one of the fathers of smooth and contemporary jazz, is still working hard on the stage and in the studio. Last September, James released his 36th solo album, Jazz Hands, which captures the veteran pianist, composer, and producer—and two-time Grammy winner—at the very top of his game.\n\nSince the early 1970s, when he famously ignited his career with producer Creed Taylor’s CTI label, James has forged a reputation as a remarkable musical alchemist. His music erases the boundaries between disparate sonic elements—such as jazz, soul, funk, classical music, and, most recently, hip hop—and transforms them into a unique musical style. Simultaneously classic and contemporary, the Grammy-nominated Jazz Hands is packed with musical surprises, shifting between lively jazz-funk workouts, soft cinematic soundscapes, bouncy hip hop jams and stomping disco grooves."
