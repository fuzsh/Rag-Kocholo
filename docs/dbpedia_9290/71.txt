Robert (Bob) James Dolan, Jr., 60, passed away at his home in Largo, Florida surrounded by friends and family on May 25, 2019. He was born in New Haven, Connecticut and had been a long-time resident in Florida.

He loved sports all his life, played baseball as a kid and had skills and ability to play pro ball; but, life didn’t take him in that direction.

Following his retirement, Bob continued to travel. His four-legged canine sidekick, Rocky, was always with him. They could often be seen at the dog park or traveling together with Rocky riding shot gun. He loved to camp, and would load up his tent and hit the road.

Bob’s greatest joy was family. He enjoyed being the loveable and fun Uncle Bobby to his nieces and nephews. His favorite sports teams were the San Diego Padres and the Chargers and he enjoyed attending their Spring Training games. Anyone who knew Bob, knew he loved food and if it he could use a coupon or go on half price day, it was even better. He loved a bargain, and while he would call himself cheap, he had a very generous heart. He gave of his time, volunteering at the USO and participating in ALS walks, when his health permitted, to honor the memory of his brother Mark and his mom.

He was preceded in death by his parents, oldest brother Mark and 2 sisters, Katheryn Crown and Elizabeth Boyd. He is survived by brothers’ Sean Dolan, Harold (Doc) Dolan, a sister, Margaret (Maggie) King and 7 nieces and nephews.
