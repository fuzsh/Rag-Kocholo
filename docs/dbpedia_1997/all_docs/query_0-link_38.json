        "text": "Nuni Moses's life and career have been marked by his influential role in Israeli media and the controversies surrounding his editorial choices and business dealings. As a media mogul, he has left a significant footprint on the Israeli media landscape, shaping the trajectory of \"Yedioth Ahronoth\" and its affiliated publications. His story highlights the complex interplay between media ownership, editorial independence, and the responsibilities of journalism in a dynamic and competitive media environment.\n\nArnnon \"Nuni\" Moses, born on April 1, 1953, is a media tycoon and the chairman of the board of directors of \"Yedioth Ahronoth Group,\" which publishes the daily newspaper \"Yedioth Ahronoth\" and owns the internet portal \"ynet.\" He also serves as the newspaper's responsible editor. Moses, a significant figure in Israeli media, has a colorful background filled with both professional achievements and controversies. This documentary-style article delves into his life and career.\n\nBiography:\n\nNuni Moses was born in Ramat Gan, Israel, as the second of four children to Nahum Moses and Paula, who owned and edited \"Yedioth Ahronoth.\" He received his early education in Ramat Gan at \"Nitzanim\" elementary school on Nitzanim Street, named after his father, Nahum Moses, and later attended \"Ohel Shem\" high school. At the age of 14, in September 1967, a tragic accident occurred when Nuni, driving his father's car in their Ramat Gan neighborhood and under his father's supervision, lost control of the vehicle and accidentally ran over and killed 10-year-old Rachel Shabai, who was walking on the sidewalk. As a result, his father was sentenced to prison, but he was released after five months when President Zalman Shazar commuted his sentence.\n\nAfter completing his military service, Nuni Moses earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Tel Aviv University and pursued one year of postgraduate studies in economics at Boston University, although he did not complete his second degree. During those years, he played basketball for both Maccabi Ramat Gan and later Hapoel Ramat Gan, two prominent teams in the Israeli national league.\n\nProfessional Career:\n\nIn his twenties, Moses began to immerse himself in the \"Yedioth Ahronoth\" media enterprise, initially as a sports writer. Under the guidance of his father, he started to take on editorial and production roles within the newspaper. In 1985, following his father's death in a tragic accident, Nuni Moses became deeply involved in the newspaper's operations and the inheritance battle that ensued among family members and editors, including his sister Judy Nir-Moses and his cousin Tami Moses-Borovitz.\n\nInitially, Moses served as both a sports writer and the de facto editor, and he was deeply involved in shaping the newspaper's content. He didn't appoint a CEO for \"Yedioth Ahronoth\" but rather distributed management responsibilities among several deputy CEOs.\n\nMoses made significant changes to the newspaper's content during his tenure. In 1996, he dismissed the editor-in-chief, Moshe Vardi, after Vardi faced criminal charges related to eavesdropping. Moses appointed Ilan Shalev as his replacement. However, in 1999, he reinstated Vardi as the editor-in-chief.\n\nDuring his time as chairman, Moses expanded \"Yedioth Ahronoth Group\" by launching various magazines, including \"Pnai Plus,\" \"Blazer,\" \"Go Style,\" and others. In 2008, the economic journal \"Calcalist\" was introduced.\n\nTensions within the organization escalated, leading to veteran journalist Motti Gilat's resignation from the newspaper in 2007 due to a dispute with Moses. After unsuccessful mediation attempts, Gilat filed a lawsuit against Yedioth Ahronoth, accusing Moses of censoring or omitting articles exposing government wrongdoing or corruption. Other editors and journalists also claimed that Moses had a direct hand in determining the newspaper's content, favoring individuals such as Avigdor Lieberman, Ehud Olmert, and Haim Ramon.\n\nIn November 2004, Moshe Vardi retired to retirement, and unexpectedly, Moses appointed Rafi Ginat, who had limited journalistic experience, as the editor-in-chief. However, in 2009, Vardi returned to the role.\n\nIn the early 21st century, \"Yedioth Ahronoth\" faced intense competition with the free daily newspaper \"Israel Hayom.\" During this period, Moses also oversaw the relocation of the \"Yedioth Ahronoth\" group from separate buildings in Tel Aviv to a shared facility in Rishon LeZion in 2008. In 2013, he sold the \"Yedioth Ahronoth\" building in Tel Aviv to David Azrieli for 374 million ILS.\n\nMedia Ownership and Influence:\n\nNuni Moses holds approximately 30% of the shares in Yedioth Ahronoth Ltd. With the support of his close family members, such as Judy Shalom Nir-Moses and Miriam Nofach-Moses, he effectively controls 60% of the opinion in the company, making him the de facto owner. Eliezer Fishman, a prominent businessman, was one of Moses's key business partners. Through Yedioth Communication Ltd., Moses also has significant ownership in the cable television companies in Israel. In 2011, he sold approximately 13% of his shares in HOT cable company for approximately 650 million ILS to businessman Patrick Drahi, retaining about 3% of the company's shares.\n\nPersonal Life:\n\nIn 2004, Moses divorced his wife and mother of his four children, Michal. In October 2005, he married Daliah Bar. He resides in Savion. In 2016, he sold his Savion home to Lev Leviev for 10.5 million ILS.\n\nHis daughter, Hadar Moses-Lichtstein, formerly worked for Yedioth Ahronoth, holding various managerial positions both in Israel and abroad. She was also responsible for legal affairs at the modeling and talent agency ADD. In June 2021, his second daughter, Keren Moses, was appointed as the CEO of the Israeli Women's Basketball League.\n\nארנון מוזס – ויקיפדיה\n\nhe.wikipedia.org"
