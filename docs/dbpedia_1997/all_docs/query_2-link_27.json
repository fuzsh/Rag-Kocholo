Men of all ages are getting called to their reserve units, hundreds of thousands throwing on uniforms.\n\nIsrael is preparing to destroy the Hamas military infrastructure in the Gaza Strip after the horrific attack that killed hundreds of Israelis, most of them civilians. Political divisions, which have driven anti-government protesters into the streets for nine months, have vanished in the face of Hamasâ€™s slaughter at the weekend and fears the conflict could spread to Lebanon."
