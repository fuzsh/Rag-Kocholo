        "text": "Newspapers\n\nA deal that confronts a painful history\n\nIt was essentially a deal between two old men. Amos Schocken, the 61-year-old publisher of Haaretz, whose father and grandfather had owned the paper before him, agreed to sell 25% of the company to Alfred Neven DuMont, the 79-year-old patriarch of a family whose roots in the publishing business went back 200 years.\n\nBut it also had a deeper significance: Israel's newspaper of record, which had belonged to the Schocken family since they fled Nazism, was now part-owned by a German company.\n\nNot only that, Alfred Neven DuMont's father had been a member of the Nazi party. At the time the acquisition was announced in August, his company DuMont Schauberg was in a legal battle with German news magazine Der Spiegel over allegations, first made in February, that it had also profited from the appropriation of Jewish property in Cologne during the second world war. Two weeks ago, Der Spiegel was forced to print a retraction.\n\nWhen the deal was announced, Israel was at war. But since then, as more has become known about DuMont's past, a storm has brewed in Israel. Competitors Ma'ariv and Yedioth Ahronoth accused Haaretz of hypocrisy (it had criticised Ma'ariv when it was sold to Robert Maxwell in 1991). Some Haaretz staff are also outraged and readers have cancelled their subscriptions.\n\nHaaretz was founded in 1919 by a group of Zionist immigrants and acquired in 1935 by Salman Shocken, Amos Schocken's grandfather, a year after he had fled Germany for Palestine. Amos Schocken, whose father had refused even to buy German printing presses, approached Alfred Neven DuMont through Avi Primor, the former Israeli ambassador to Germany, whose son is the editor of the English-language edition of Haaretz. The two companies stressed that Alfred Neven DuMont, who was 17 at the end of the war, had been a supporter of Israel and funded Jewish organisations such as the Peres Center for Peace. The deal was made \"in full awareness of the painful histories of both countries\".\n\nA timeline on DuMont's website glosses over the Nazi period, skipping from 1928 to 1949 and omitting any mention of the fact that Kurt Neven DuMont, Alfred's father, joined the Nazi party in 1937. \"He had no choice,\" Alfred Neven DuMont told Haaretz in an interview after the acquisition. \"If he had not done so, the Nazis would have liquidated the company.\"\n\nHowever, it is already apparent that DuMont's history - like that of many German companies in the 20th century - is more complicated than it at first seems. For example, the DuMont family hid two Jewish sisters who worked for them until the end of the war. \"It's not all black and white,\" says Manfred Pohl, an eminent historian who has been commissioned to research DuMont's corporate history.\n\nHans Kundnani\n\nEthical\n\nGreater openness will lead to trust\n\nNewspapers owe a good deal of their living to shedding light on the failings of others and urging governments, organisations and individuals to act more responsibly. But the press rarely turns the searchlight of publicity on its own internal workings, and this perceived lack of transparency is considered one of the key reasons why trust in newspapers is so low.\n\nThe Guardian and Observer remain alone among the world's newspapers in opening up their editorial and business practices to the scrutiny of an independent social auditor, and producing an annual social, ethical and environmental audit, the fourth of which is published today.\n\nThe award-winning Living our Values audit measures the performance of our company against the values set out by the Manchester Guardian's esteemed former editor of 57 years CP Scott: \"Honesty, cleanness [integrity], courage, fairness, a sense of duty to the reader and the community.\"\n\nIt reports on the impacts of our editorial content, the commercial challenges being faced, the company's environmental impacts and the numerous community projects we are involved in. The main thrust of this year's document is how we are going about transforming ourselves from a traditional text-based newspaper company, whose resources have largely been concentrated on a UK readership, to a multi-media business offering text, audio and video to users around the world. Social auditor Richard Evans, in his auditor's statement, concludes the report provides \"a credible and detailed disclosure of the company's vision and objectives in relation to global sustainability, social justice and its responsibilities to its stakeholders.\"\n\nGuardian editor Alan Rusbridger, in a speech earlier this month at Harvard, made it clear newspaper groups would need to be more open if they were to build trust with their readers.\n\nRusbridger said: \"Why do newspapers find some of this stuff so hard to do? Many in the so-called mainstream media feel besieged enough. They wonder what is happening to notions of journalistic authority. They're taken aback by the bitterness and hostility to what we do. So it's a perfectly understandable reaction not to give 'them' - the baying mob - the material to attack us any further. Show any weakness and they'll scent blood.\n\n\"But - whoever owns you and whatever the business model - that's not going to work in future, if it ever did. Whatever scepticism any of us have about any of the new media dogmas - wiki, 'we the media', 'the wisdom of crowds' - I really do believe the benefits of opening up outweigh any pain.\"\n\nJo Confino"
