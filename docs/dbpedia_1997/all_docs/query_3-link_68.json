We are humbled to be in the company of all 50 Israeli startups that were recognized by the publisher, including Kaltura, Playbuzz, Infinidat, Similar Web, eToro, Fiverr, and others.\n\nThis distinction could not have been achieved without the unique team we call Taboolars – from our engineers that work around the clock in Tel Aviv to our top notch account managers around the world. We are extremely grateful to Calcalist for acknowledging our team’s achievements and rapid growth."
