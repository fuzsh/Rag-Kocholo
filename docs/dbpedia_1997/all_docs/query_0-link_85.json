        "text": "Gaza Digest 114, 7/3/09\n\nNews Clips: Israeli forces forcibly evicted two extended Palestinian families from their houses in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in East Jerusalem early in the morning on Sunday, and the move was immediately condemned by the U.N. and the U.K., as settlers moved quickly into the vacated homes; Thousands of Israelis turned out in Tel Aviv on Sunday to protest an attack on the previous day in which a masked gunman opened fire inside a gay and lesbian youth center, killing two people and wounding 15; Israeli Police on Sunday recommended that the state prosecution indict Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman on charges of bribery, fraud, money laundering, witness harassment and obstruction of justice; Recent revelations about foreign government funding for local NGOs involved in political activity (such as Breaking the Silence, Peace Now, B'Tselem and Machsom Watch) have triggered discussions by senior Israeli officials about the possibility of making such aid illegal, The Jerusalem Post has learned; Hamas leader-in-exile Khaled Meshal says the Islamic militant group is ready to accept a Palestinian state based on the 1967 lines, according to an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Friday; Israel's offensive against Hamas in Gaza at the beginning of the year was a \"proportional response\" to attacks by the Islamist group, the Foreign Ministry said in a defense brief on Operation Cast Lead released Thursday intended to pre-empt two U.N. reports due within the next week.\n\n1. Really clear article from the Electronic Intifada about the growing strength of the BDS movement by Omar Barghouti, founding member of the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI) and Sid Shniad, a co-chair of Independent Jewish Voices Canada.\n\nUnited for Freedom & Universal Justice, Omar Barghouti and Sid Shniad, The Electronic Intifada, 7/31/09\n\nFor several decades, the world has watched in frustration as the crisis in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories deepened. Confused by the details of what is alleged to be a highly complicated situation and loathe to be attacked for criticizing Israel lest they be vilified as anti-Semites, people who would otherwise be expected to play an active role in striving for an end to Israel's occupation, colonization and system of discrimination, in accordance with international law have chosen to focus their attention elsewhere.\n\nIn recent years, however, this state of affairs has begun to change dramatically as a growing number of activists and intellectuals -- including members of the Jewish communities in the West, who could once be counted upon by Israel to be either unquestioning supporters or silent in their acquiescence to its actions -- have begun to find their voice on this matter.\n\nThe fact that Israel's decades-old oppression of the indigenous people of Palestine defies the fundamental notions of justice and respect of the rule of law has informed this gradual transformation of people of conscience advocating social justice everywhere. The most recent scenes of Israeli jets and heavy armor mounting savage attacks on defenseless civilian populations first in Lebanon in 2006, and then in Gaza at the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 -- compounded a growing perception among international civil society of Israel as a pariah state that is flouting international law and basic human rights with utter impunity.\n\nThere is a growing understanding of the fundamental issues that drive the crisis: the occupation of Palestinian land by Zionist Jews claiming a right to do so by virtue of an alleged historical-Biblical entitlement; the expulsion of masses of Palestinians from their homeland -- first by Zionist militias and, later, the state of Israel -- at the time of Israel's establishment; the legalized and institutionalized discrimination against Palestinian citizens of Israel; and the ongoing military occupation and colonization of Palestinian and other Arab lands conquered in 1967.\n\nAs a result, a long-overdue determination has arisen in the ranks of civil society around the world, a determination to take concrete steps to generate tactics and strategies to bring a satisfactory resolution to this ongoing crisis by addressing its root causes. One of the most important manifestations of this new determination is the rise of an international movement endorsing the nonviolent, morally-consistent, universalist strategy of boycott, divestment and sanctions (BDS) against the state of Israel to compel it to comply with international law and human rights principles. The struggle against apartheid in South Africa was one of the key inspirations behind this fast spreading movement.\n\nAs expected, the prevailing Zionist response to this development has been a vitriolic denunciation of the individuals and organizations involved and a sustained attempt to bully them into silence. This usually involves an ascription of anti-Semitism as the motive for such action. In April of this year, however, when Independent Jewish Voices Canada joined the growing number of organizations endorsing BDS to promote a just peace based on international law, the Zionist establishment chose to ignore the development -- presumably because the fact that it was Jews endorsing the strategy strongly challenged the false notion of a monolithic Jewish voice in support of Zionism and Israel. From the Zionists' perspective, engaging IJV on the subject would focus increased attention on the underlying substantive issues and neutralize their most powerful tools: brow beating and intimidation.\n\n2. From the Alternative Information CenterU.N. and international aid agencies, worried about the new school year about to start in Gaza, decry and call for the immediate lifting of the blockade.\n\nU.N. and International Aid Agencies Fear Gaza Educational System Unprepared for New School Year, Call for Immediate Opening of Borders, The Alternative Information Center, 7/30/09\n\nExcerpt: The UN Humanitarian Coordinator, representing UN aid agencies in the occupied Palestinian territory (oPt), and the Association of International Development Agencies (AIDA), represented by at least 25 NGOs, today demand full and unfettered access into and out of Gaza in particular to restore the Gazan educational system.\n\nDuring the 23 days of Israel's operation Cast Lead in Gaza, 18 schools were completely destroyed and at least 280 were damaged. Today, one month before the start of the new school year, more than six months after the ceasefires, none of these schools have been properly rebuilt or rehabilitated due to lack of construction materials. Since the imposition of the blockade, students have faced chronic shortages of educational supplies including textbooks, paper and uniforms, though we acknowledge the recent moves to allow textbooks, uniforms, and stationary into Gaza. These are welcome first steps. However, the quantities, kinds and predictability of goods being permitted into Gaza are still far below what is required for normal life. Even prior to Cast Lead the education system was already under severe duress due to the two year blockade that has caused a crisis of human dignity in Gaza.\n\nThe right to learn and be educated is a fundamental child right that is uniquely central to every child's ability to realize his or her potential - and by extension, that of their communities and countries. In the context of protracted conflict and occupation, safe schools also offer an unparalleled means of restoring a sense of normalcy and hope for children and their families. Despite the extraordinary odds stacked against them, going to school and becoming educated remains the single most cherished priority among Palestinian children. The continuing blockade on Gaza jeopardizes this fundamental child right, along with the remarkable progress in education that has been achieved thus far.\n\nThe blockade has caused untold suffering to children in Gaza, who face another academic year in terrible conditions, said Philippe Lazzarini, acting Humanitarian Coordinator of oPt.\n\nTogether with the communities we serve, the United Nations and non-governmental humanitarian organizations working in oPt collectively call for immediate steps to end the blockade, as is required by international humanitarian and human rights law. We call on the Government of Israel to urgently facilitate entry of construction materials and supplies for schools in the coming weeks, and to ensure that students, teachers and trainers can freely exit and enter Gaza to continue learning.\n\n3. An article from IRIN (the U.N. Humanitarian News and Information Agency) about children swimming in raw sewage on the shores of Gaza.\n\nGaza: Swimming in Sewage, IRIN News Agency, 8/2/09\n\nExcerpt: Less than 50m from a black, barrel-sized pipe pouring raw sewage directly into the sea, children are playing in the waves.\n\nThe pipe runs from one of three main sewage pumping stations in Gaza, with multiple outlets into the sea. The water authority in the Gaza Strip has been unable to import the parts necessary for the maintenance and repairs at water and sewage pumping stations since Israel imposed its two-year long blockade of the territory, according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) in Gaza.\n\nWe know there is sewage in the water, but the borders are closed and we can't travel, said Mariam Al-Halu, who brought her two sons to swim. With scorching temperatures and intermittent electricity, many Gazans seek refuge from the heat in the polluted waters, residents say.\n\nAccording to a July 2009 report (not available online) on the quality of Gaza's seawater by the World Health Organization (WHO), seawater samples collected monthly from April to June by the public health laboratory in Gaza were polluted with faecal bacteria, specifically coliforms and streptococcus .\n\n4. Three-minute clip from Ayman Moyheldin of Al-Jazeera of a recent mass wedding of 450 couples in Gaza. Great visuals and interesting analysis.\n\nHamas Organizes Mass Wedding in Gaza, Ayman Mohyeldin, Al-Jazeera, 8/2/09\n\nGaza Digest 113, 7/30/09\n\nNews Clips: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has frozen a project for the construction of some 900 apartments in East Jerusalem, Channel 10 television reported late Wednesday; In reaction to a recent report by Breaking the Silence, containing testimonies of Israeli soldiers, discussing possible Israeli military violations of international law during the Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip earlier this year, it was reported that Israeli government officials have been pressuring their Dutch and British counterparts to cut off their funding to the organization; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with U.S. National Security Adviser James Jones in Jerusalem Wednesday evening, for a private meeting on Israeli-Palestinian peace process, during which Netanyahu told Jones that Israel would not fully open the Gaza border crossings until captive Israel Defense Forces soldier Gilad Shalit was released; A statement released jointly by five left-leaning, pro-Israel organizations Ameinu, Americans for Peace Now, Brit Tzedek v'Shalom, Meretz USA and J Street says that \"issues of borders and sovereignty related to Jerusalem should be determined through negotiations in the context of a regional, comprehensive resolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict\" and \"unilateral actions that inflame tensions, impair negotiations and make the ultimate resolution of issues surrounding Jerusalem more difficult are unhelpful and should be avoided at this particularly sensitive moment.\"\n\n1. This article from Haaretz posits that the glamour of the Gaza assault has resulted in an uptick in the number of young recruits requesting placement in combat units.\n\nIDF: More recruits request combat service since Gaza war, Anshil Pfeffer, Haaretz, 7/29/09\n\nSince the beginning of 2009, the Israel Defense Forces have seen a sharp increase in the number of recruits interested in joining combat units, IDF data shows. The IDF attributes this trend to the massive media exposure the combat units received during Israel's three-week offensive in the Gaza Strip last winter.\n\nThe data, however, also shows a slight decline in the popularity of the less \"glamorous\" field units.\n\nInfantry units continue to draw most high school students eligible for combat service, as 45 percent of potential recruits said they wanted to serve in one of the infantry brigades.\n\nIn total, 71.5 percent of new recruits specified they wanted to join a field unit, representing a 4 percent increase over figures recorded in 2008.\n\nThe Golani Brigade retains its place as the most sought after among the infantry units, with an average of 4.8 recruits asking to serve in the brigade for every available space. Givati ranks second among the infantry brigades, with 4 recruits for each available slot, followed by the Nahal Brigade with 2.5 recruits per slot.\n\n2. Reuters reports that Israel will allow some cement into Gaza.\n\nAs US wades in, Israel to let Gaza get some cement, Dan Williams, Reuters, 7/29/09\n\nExcerpt: Israel will allow some cement into the Gaza Strip for reconstruction, officials said on Wednesday, signalling flexibility on a blockade as Washington intensified efforts to broker peacemaking with the Palestinians.\n\nAfter Hamas Islamists seized Gaza in 2007, Israel curbed imports that it said could be used to make arms or bunkers. The lack of cement and steel has been especially felt since Israel's December-January offensive, which devastated the coastal strip.\n\nThough the West shuns Hamas, Gaza's deepening privation and isolation have hindered the U.S.-led campaign to revive peace talks between Israel and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who is locked in a power-struggle with the Islamists.\n\nThe announcement that cement would be admitted for three Gazan projects coincided with a visit to Israel by U.S. national security adviser Jim Jones. He follows closely on U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and senior U.S. envoy George Mitchell.\n\nAfter meeting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday, Mitchell said he saw \"good progress\". Netanyahu and President Barack Obama are trying to bridge a rift over Jewish settlements on West Bank land Palestinians want for a state.\n\nOne Israeli official said that Defence Minister Ehud Barak gave his approval in principle to the cement imports before this week's influx of American officials, but added: \"Shall I say the timing of this publication isn't good? Of course it's good.\"\n\n3. Short blog post by Phil Weiss on Mondoweiss gives the translation for a Hebrew poster that Peace Now has put up around Jerusalem in commemoration of the holiday of Tisha B'av. Weiss says the translation of the poster comes from Ynet.\n\nSettlements have turned us into the loathsome scum among nations,' prophetic Peace Now poster cries, Philip Weiss on July 29, 2009\n\nExcerpt: \"For this I mourn,\" the poster continues,\" for the settlements that were built in the heart of Palestinian territory and that keep peace and quiet from our land. For the settlements that were built, with or without permit, and that turn us into the loathsome scum among the nations.\n\n\"For the outposts that were built by deception and by turning blind eyes. For Jerusalem, the joy of the land, that has been turned into a city of strife and quarrel. For the continued investment and construction in the settlements, that will ultimately lead to one state for two people  and thus put an end to the Zionist enterprise.\"\n\n4. Ma'an News Agency reports on the demolition order given for electric pylons built in the West Bank after Tony Blair assured Palestinian government officials that they would be permitted. NOT.\n\nBlair gives construction go ahead; Israel issues demolition orders, Ma'an News Agency, 7/29/09\n\nIsraeli forces delivered demolition orders for electricity pylons under construction in the village of At-Tuwani, located in the South Hebron hills on Tuesday.\n\nFour months earlier Quartet Envoy Tony Blair promised villagers that he had oral permission from the Israeli District Coordination Office (DCO) for a go-ahead with the project. On 25 May, just two months after Blair's visit, Israeli forces ordered a halt work on the structures, according to the Christian Peacemaker Teams (CPT) observing Israeli action in the area. The move usually precedes demolition orders.\n\nCPT said Head of the At-Tuwani Village Council Saber Hreini wrote to Blair on 26 May, requesting written permission for the electricity work to continue.\n\nThe group said Hreini received no response from the Quartet representative.\n\nA spokesman for Blair said that the Office of the Quartet Representative is still working at all levels to secure the Israeli permits needed for the electrical project.\n\nGaza Digest 112, 7/29/09\n\nNews Clips: Far-right activists distributed fliers to fresh draftees at the Israel Defense Forces induction center in Tel Hashomer on Tuesday urging them not to confide in their commanders and to refrain from cooperating with investigators if they physically abuse Palestinians in the territories; Israeli settler groups have set up 11 new outposts in the occupied West Bank, in a direct rebuttal of mounting US calls to freeze settlement activity; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the top U.S. Mideast envoy said they made progress Tuesday on their dispute over West Bank settlements, but offered no sign of a breakthrough at a meeting in Jerusalem; Hundreds of extremist Israeli right-wingers marched in Jerusalem on Tuesday at night while chanting slogans against the US president, Barrack Obama, and US Middle East Envoy, George Mitchell, for their Middle East policies.\n\n1. This long and detailed article from ZMag by Israeli historian Ilan Pappe (who now teaches in the U.K.) covers the early days of the Zionist movement, the creation of the state of Israel, which he says grew increasingly militarized until it became an army with a state, and ends with suggestions for how to demilitarize Israel both ideologically and literally. He makes a cogent argument for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) towards the end of the piece.\n\nDisarm Israel: A Utopia or a Vision for Peace, Ilan Pappe, ZSpace, 7/28/09\n\nExcerpt: This qualitative change in public opinion and mood is visible in other Western countries; needless to say that in the vast world this has the been the case for years now. Similar mood prevailed at the hey day of Apartheid in South Africa. The reality there, then, and the reality in Palestine, now, prods decent people, either as individuals or as members of organizations, to voice their outrage against the continued oppression, colonization, ethnic cleansing and starvation in Palestine. They are looking for ways of showing their protest and some even hope to convince their governments to change their old policy of indifference and inaction in the face of the continued destruction of Palestine and the Palestinians. Many among them are Jews, as these atrocities are done in their name according to the logic of the Zionist ideology, and quite a few among them are veterans of previous civil struggles in this country for similar causes all over the world. They are not confined any more to one political party and they come from all walks of life.\n\nSo far the British government, and the other Western governments, are not moved. They was also passive when the anti-apartheid movement in Britain demanded of its government to impose sanctions on South Africa. It took several decades for that activism from below to reach the political top. It takes longer in the case of Palestine: guilt about the Holocaust, distorted historical narratives and contemporary misrepresentation of Israel as a democracy seeking peace and the Palestinians as eternal Islamic terrorists blocked the flow of the popular impulse. But it is beginning to find its way and presence, despite the continued accusation of any such demand as being anti-Semitic and the demonization of Islam and Arabs. The third sector, that important link between civilians and government agencies, has shown us the way. One trade union after the other, one professional group after the other, have all sent recently a clear message: enough is enough. It is done in the name of decency, human morality and basic civil commitment not to remain idle in the face of atrocities of the kind Israel has and still is committing against the Palestinian people.\n\nThe validity of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions option is a first step in triggering a process of disarming Israel from its lethal ideology and its practical and real arms. Boycotts and outside pressure have never been attempted in the case of Israel, a state that wishes to be included in the civilised democratic world. Israel has indeed enjoyed such a status since its creation in 1948 and, therefore, succeeded in fending off the many United Nations' resolutions that condemned its policies and, moreover, managed to obtain a preferential status in the European Union. Israeli academia's elevated position in the global scholarly community epitomises this western support for Israel as the only democracy' in the Middle East. Shielded by this particular support for academia, and other cultural media, the Israeli army and security services can go on, and will go on, demolishing houses, expelling families, abusing citizens and killing, almost every day, children and women without being accountable regionally and globally for their crimes.\n\nMilitary and financial support to Israel is significant in enabling the Jewish state to pursue the policies it does. Any possible measure of decreasing such aid is most welcome in the struggle for peace and justice in the Middle East. But the cultural image in Israel feeds the political decision in the west to support unconditionally the Israeli destruction of Palestine and the Palestinians. The message that will be directed specifically against those who represent offiiccally the Israeli culture (spearhead by the state's academic institutes which have been particularly culpable in sustaining the oppression since 1948 and the occupation since 1967), can be a start for a successful campaign for disarming the state from its ideological constraints(as similar acts at the time had activated the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa).\n\n2. A piece by Jonathan Cook from The Electronic Intifada covers the controversy surrounding a recent Israeli Education Department edict that Palestinian children in Israel, who are in segregated schools, must learn the Israeli national anthem.\n\nPalestinians in Israel forced to study Zionist anthem, Jonathan Cook, The Electronic Intifada, 7/28/09\n\nExcerpt: A leading Arab educator in Israel has denounced the decision of Gideon Saar, the education minister, to require schools to study the Israeli national anthem.\n\nOfficials announced last week that they were sending out special \"national anthem kits\" to 8,000 schools, including those in the separate Arab education system, in time for the start of the new academic year in September.\n\nThe kits have been designed to be suitable for all age groups and for use across the curriculum, from civics and history classes to music and literature lessons.\n\nThe anthem, known as Hatikva, or The Hope, has long been unpopular with Israel's Palestinian minority because its lyrics refer only to a Jewish historical connection to the land.\n\nSaar's initiative is widely seen among Israel's 1.3 million Palestinian citizens as a further indication of the rising nationalistic tide sweeping policymakers.\n\nLast week the ministry also announced that textbooks recently issued to Arab schoolchildren would have expunged the word \"nakba,\" or catastrophe, to describe the Palestinians' dispossession at Israel's founding in 1948.\n\nHala Espanioly, who chairs the education committee of the Arab minority's supreme political body, the Higher Follow-Up Committee, told the Israeli news website Ynet: \"If there is an attempt to force the Hatikva anthem on Arab schools and Arab pupils, it will be akin to a kind of attempted rape of their identity.\"\n\nThe issue of the national anthem, based on a 120-year-old poem by Naftali Hertz Imber and an ancient folk melody, has been a running sore between Israel's Jewish and Arab populations for decades.\n\nArab citizens are unhappy with its heavily Zionist lyrics, which speak of how the \"soul of a Jew yearns\" to return to Zion, as well as referring to \"The hope of two thousand years, To be a free nation in our land.\"\n\nIn 2005 some legislators were outraged when an Israeli parliamentary committee considered, among possible constitution changes, revising the anthem's lyrics from \"the soul of a Jew'\" to \"the soul of an Israeli.\" The change was not approved.\n\n3. Rather depressing piece from The Electronic Intifada about abuses of human rights by Hamas in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.\n\nFatah, Hamas rule increasingly authoritarian, Mel Frykberg, The Electronic Intifada, 7/28/09\n\nExcerpt: What remains of Palestinian civil rights is rapidly being eroded by the dictatorial Palestinian governments that respectively control the divided Occupied Palestinian Territories.\n\nPalestinian civilians are paying the price as the Islamic resistance movement Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, and the Fatah-affiliated and western-backed Palestinian Authority (PA), which rules the West Bank, continue to target their political opponents as part of their bitter power struggle.\n\n\"We don't have a police state here in Palestine. We have two police states. One in Gaza and one in the West Bank,\" says Rabie Latifah from the Palestinian human rights organization Al Haq.\n\n\"The abuse of Palestinian civilians by both Fatah and Hamas security forces has become systematic and is no longer the exception to the rule,\" Latifah told IPS.\n\nMysterious bomb blasts, assassinations by masked gunmen, detainees denied access to their lawyers, torture and death in detention, the random arrest of critical journalists, and the banning of peaceful demonstrations are but a few of the human rights violations sweeping the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\n\nWhile armed men are being arrested, politically motivated arrest campaigns are also targeting citizens suspected of merely sympathizing with the opposition.\n\n\"We have endured over 40 years of occupation and human rights abuses by the Israelis, and now we are doing it to ourselves,\" says Raji Sourani, director of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR).\n\nGaza Digest 111, 7/28/09\n\nNews Clips: A delegation of eight US congressmen and women entered the Gaza Strip on Monday morning through the Erez crossing point between Israel and the northern Gaza Strip; U.S. Middle East envoy George Mitchell told Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Monday he was still working on a deal with Israel to halt West Bank settlement activity so peace talks can resume; At least seven Palestinians were killed overnight when fuel exploded in a smuggling tunnel beneath the border between Egypt and the Gaza Strip, Palestinian officials in Gaza said on Monday;\n\n1. As a counter-point to yesterday's upbeat piece by Bronner and Kershner from the New York Times, the International Crisis Group published a study about the settlements that paints a much grimmer picture.\n\nIsrael's Religious Right and the Question of Settlements: Middle East Report N°89, International Crisis Group, 7/20/09\n\nExcerpt: The effort to settle in the occupied territories once was led by secular Zionists. No more. Today, the settlement issue is being quickly transformed by the shifting dynamics of the religious right. Tens of thousands of national-religious Jews populate the settlements; they enjoy political, logistical and other forms of support from hundreds of thousands inside Israel proper. In addition, an equal if not larger number of ultra-orthodox who initially shared little of the national-religious outlook, gradually have been gravitating toward their view; many among them are now settlers. Together, the national-religious and ultra-orthodox carry weight far in excess of their numbers. They occupy key positions in the military, the government and the education and legal sectors, as well as various layers of the bureaucracy. They help shape decision-making and provide a support base for religious militants, thereby strengthening the struggle against future territorial withdrawals from both within and without state institutions.\n\nThe religious right believes it has time on its side. Its two principal camps  the national-religious and ultra-orthodox  boast the country's highest birth rates. They have doubled their population in West Bank settlements in a decade. They are rising up military ranks. Their political parties traditionally play important roles within ruling government coalitions. Many  in the leadership and among the grassroots  are preparing the ground for the next battle over settlements and territorial withdrawal, animated by a deeply rooted conviction in the rightness of their cause. Treating every confrontation  however insignificant the apparent stake  as a test of wills, religious militants have responded to the demolition of plyboard huts with revenge strikes on Palestinians, stoning their cars, burning their crops, cutting their trees and occasionally opening fire. Mainstream religious leaders for the most part appear powerless to condemn, let alone tamp down the violence.\n\n2. Excellent piece by Rabbi Lynn Gottlieb on Mondoweiss about a screening of a new documentary about Rachel Corrie and the controversy around its screening at the San Francisco Jewish Film Festival.\n\nRachel' screening in San Francisco shows a growing movement tired of being censored about Israel, Rabbi Lynn Gottlieb, Mondoweiss, 7/27/09\n\nExcerpt: The fact that the vast majority of people in the crowd at the Castro Theatre would not let the Voice of Israel representative speak his mind without interruption reflects growing frustration with the use of pubic slander, character assassination, cancellation of speakers, firing of faculty and demand for resignations by the so-called defenders of Israel. Since when are people with views that differ from AIPAC, for instance, invited into mainstream circles to speak for five minutes before a pro-Israel speech or film? The representative of Voice of Israel was not there to dialogue. Only to chastise. The crowd refused to be chastised. When the impassioned proponent of Israel mentioned JVP and AFSC in order to condemn them as virulent anti-Semites, the crowd burst into cheers and applause to honor them instead.\n\nThe crowd at the Castro represents a growing movement of individuals and groups who believe that peace between Israelis and Palestinians can never be achieved without addressing and redressing the issue of Palestinian human rights. Resistance is sometimes rowdy. Naturally, the side of privilege and status quo demand politeness from resisters in order to maintain decorum. Well, politeness isn't always the best way to go in a situation where you have never been given a voice in the first place. While I am a proponent of compassionate listening, I learned from people of color that interrupting the language of hatred and racism also has a place.\n\n3. In The Nation, Robert Dreyfuss writes about the current negotiations between members of the Obama Administration and the Israeli government. (Hillary Clinton is noticeably absent from the scene.)\n\nReal Peaceor a Mirage? Robert Dreyfuss, The Nation, 7/27/09\n\nExcerpt: One way to keep Bibi Netanyahu from making trouble is to keep him so busy meeting US envoys and diplomats that he doesn't have time for anything else. That appears to be President Obama's strategy this week, since Netanyahu will be meeting with a veritable avalanche of Americans, including: George Mitchell, the US special envoy; Jim Jones, Obama's national security adviser; Robert Gates, the holdover secretary of defense who is showing no signs that he intends to go away; and Dennis Ross, the neocon-linked NSC official whose actual job remains ever vague.\n\nUnless this is a covert effort to push Israeli hotel prices higher during the tourist season, the goal of the US effort seems to be to prepare Israel for what may, in fact, be a serious effort by the United States to resolve the Palestine conflict. There've been rumors floating that Obama may be thinking about proposing the outlines of a comprehensive US peace plan as early as this September. If so, it would be a plan that goes far beyond the nasty dispute over Jewish \"settlements\" -- i.e., massive, concrete and asphalt cities being built in the environs of Jerusalem and around the West Bank -- to include the elements of a final status agreement.\n\nOr, on the other hand, Obama can do what AIPAC wants, namely, to continue to call for endless negotiations between the two sides.\n\nIt's been known for many years, or decades, what that might look like: the establishment of state called Palestine in the West Bank and Gaza, within borders slightly modified from the 1967 lines acceptable to both sides, with Palestine's capital in now-occupied East Jerusalem, an accord on Palestinian refugees' right to return to their homeland, etc.\n\nA question is: what sort of guarantees will Obama promise Israel to get them to feel more secure? General Jones, the former NATO commander, is an advocate for stationing US and/or NATO troops in between Israel and Palestine, not as a fighting force but as observers and guarantors. Presumably, though Israel would insist that Palestine be \"demilitarized,\" General Dayton and his US team of military advisers, who've been working closely with Jordan and the Palestinians, would accelerate their efforts to create Palestinian army and police units. There's talk about a formal US security guarantee for Israel, though what form that would take isn't clear. And some, including pro-Israel neocons in the United States, have proposed bringing Israel into NATO. Last week, Hillary Clinton proposed what sounded like a \"nuclear umbrella\" over Israel and the Arab states as a guarantee against an acquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran, and there's no doubt that the US will provide assurances to Israel about Iran. (In fact, however, the threat from Iran is wildly hyped by Israel and its allies, and there is much less there than meets the eye.)\n\n4. Australian journalist Antony Loewenstein is currently in Gaza and posting his reports to Mondoweiss.\n\nHope lives in Gaza despite siege, desperation and anger, Antony Loewenstein, Mondoweiss, 7/26/09\n\nExcerpt: While the devastation, desperation and anger permeates every level of existence here and the siege is the topic of every second conversation, hope lives. Although many have said they would love to leave and go somewhere else, there's a spark of proud survival. It is clear that the Palestinians here are victims of an insane experiment that aims to overthrow Hamas but in fact only strengthens the hatred towards Israel. I'm hearing it every day. Dislike of Jews has only been occasionally expressed. Rampant homophobia is sadly common. In the main, this is not a religious conflict. I even heard from my hotel tonight, situated right on Gaza's beach promenade, a Hamas wedding with a DJ and cheesy, Western pop music. Sometimes, dancing comes before faith.\n\nThe streets, alleys and laneways are cluttered, dusty, often smelly and crowded. Cracked windshields can't be replaced because the right size of glass is unavailable. Criss-crossing the Strip in countless battered cars, I've met drivers who live on a few shekels per ride. Yesterday I tried to give one younger man my change as a tip, but he insisted I take back the less than two shekels. It was humbling from a man who soon after was stopped and verbally abused by a Hamas policeman.\n\nGaza Digest 110, 7/27/09\n\nNews Clips: U.S. envoy to the Middle East George Mitchell arrived in Israel Sunday and met with Defense Minister Ehud Barak as part of an ongoing effort to reach an agreement on construction in the settlements; There are now more than 300,000 residents living in Jewish West Bank settlements, according to a Israel Defense Forces Civil Administration report covering the first half of 2009; On July 26th a group of settlers led by Arie King took over a Palestinian house in Sheikh Jarrah to which they where given custody of in a very controversial decision of the Israeli courtwhile trying to prevent the settlers from taking over the house and demolishing it, 11 activists (three Palestinians, seven internationals and one Israeli) where arrested.\n\n1. The Israeli Foreign Ministry is reported in Haaretz to be writing a defense brief as a pre-emptive response to the two U.N. reports on Operation Cast Lead that are expected from the U.N. later this summer.\n\nIsrael prepares 'defense brief' ahead of UN Gaza reports, Barak Ravid, Haaretz, 7/27/09\n\nExcerpt: A group of legal experts from the Foreign Ministry is writing a defense brief for the government in advance of two harsh reports on Operation Cast Lead expected to be released soon.\n\nThe ministry's defense brief is expected to be finished in a week or two, ahead of two United Nations reports that are expected to be highly critical of the extent of civilian injuries in the Gaza Strip during the operation.\n\nA draft of the two reports is expected to be given to Israel around the end of August, before they are officially presented to the Human Rights Council in mid-September.\n\nSources in Israel believe that the release of the UN reports could lead to legal action against Israel in one of the two international courts in The Hague.\n\n2. According to Reuters, UNWRA denied reports that its director John Ging had fled Gaza because of death threats by Hamas.\n\nU.N. agency denies boss fled Gaza death threat, John Hamilton, Reuters, 7/24/09\n\nExcerpt: The main United Nations agency supplying aid to the Palestinians strongly denied an Israeli newspaper report on Friday that its director had fled Gaza after death threats from the enclave's Islamist rulers.\n\nThe assertion that John Ging fled after threats from Hamas because he refused to hand over millions of dollars in aid funds was completely baseless and \"entirely false\", said Chris Gunness, spokesman for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency UNRWA.\n\n\"At no stage has Mr Ging ever fled Gaza and any suggestion that Hamas has any control or influence over UNRWA aid is as baseless as the absurdity about John Ging, (whose) track record in the face of previous threats and attack is a matter of public record,\" he said in a statement.\n\n3. This article from the front page of today's New York Times posits that the Haredi (Orthodox) communities in two West Bank settlements don't have a strong ideological commitment to their current locations and might be amenable to a deal.\n\nIn Two West Bank Settlements, Sign of Hope for a Deal, Ethan Bronner and Isabel Kershner, The New York Times, 7/27/09\n\nExcerpt: Seen from afar, this fast-growing settlement embodies everything that the Obama administration wants to address through its demand for a freeze on settlement building: it sits on land captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war and, with 45,000 residents and 60 births a week, it is the largest and fastest-growing Jewish community in the West Bank.\n\nIf, as is widely believed abroad, natural growth by Israeli settlers is blocking the creation of a viable Palestinian state, this community should show why.\n\nBut appearances are deceiving. Modiin Illit and its sister community, Beitar Illit, are entirely ultra-Orthodox, a world apart, one of strict religious observance and study. They offer surprising potential for compromise.\n\nUnlike settlers who believe they are continuing the historic Zionist mission of reclaiming the Jewish homeland, most ultra-Orthodox do not consider themselves settlers or Zionists and express no commitment to being in the West Bank, so their growth in these settlement towns, situated just inside the pre-1967 boundary, could be redirected westward to within Israel.\n\n4. Another article from Ethan Bronner in the Times about a change in tactics by Hamasfor the moment they are opting for cultural resistance over armed resistance.\n\nHamas Switches from Rockets to Public Relations, Ethan Bronner, New York Times, 7/24/09\n\nExcerpt: Seven months after Israel started a fierce three-week military campaign here to stop rockets from being fired on its southern communities, Hamas has suspended its use of rockets and shifted focus to winning support at home and abroad through cultural initiatives and public relations.\n\nThe aim is to build what leaders here call a culture of resistance, the topic of a recent two-day conference. In recent days, a play has been staged, a movie premiered, an art exhibit mounted, a book of poems published and a television series begun, most of it state-sponsored and all focused on the plight of Palestinians in Gaza. There are plans for a documentary competition.\n\nArmed resistance is still important and legitimate, but we have a new emphasis on cultural resistance, noted Ayman Taha, a Hamas leader and former fighter. The current situation required a stoppage of rockets. After the war, the fighters needed a break and the people needed a break.\n\nMr. Taha and others say that the military has replaced field commanders and restructured itself as it learns lessons from the war. The decision to suspend the use of the short-range Qassam rockets that for years have flown into Israel, often dozens a day, has been partly the result of popular pressure. Increasingly, people here are questioning the value of the rockets, not because they hit civilians but because they are seen as relatively ineffective.\n\nGaza Digest 109, 7/24/09\n\nNews Clips: The White House on Thursday brushed aside any suggestion that the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama was planning to exert economic pressure on Israel to halt West Bank settlement construction; The U.S. administration has issued a stiff warning to Israel not to build in the area known as E-1, which lies between Jerusalem and the West Bank settlement of Ma'aleh Adumim--any change in the status quo in E-1 would be \"extremely damaging,\" even \"corrosive,\" the message said: Israel's Arrow II missile defense system, which is partly underwritten by U.S. tax dollars, was tested at a U.S. range off the California coast early Thursday morning but problems prevented the launch of the system's interceptor, the U.S. Pentagon said; Israel does not expect the United States to limit use of loan guarantees despite a dispute with Washington over building in East Jerusalem and in West Bank settlements, Israeli Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz said on Thursday.\n\n1. Bernard Avishai argues in Haaretz that rather than pushing for a settlement freeze, the Obama Administration should help broker an agreement over borders for a two-state solution.\n\nGive Us a Border, Bernard Avishai, Haaretz, 7/24/09\n\nExcerpt: Clearly, the issue here is not a settlement freeze. The freeze has become a proxy for the larger question of where to locate an internationally recognized border between two states. Why, then, should Obama fight - with little chance of success - over a symbol and defer the fight over what is symbolized, which will eventually require a hard line from America and the world anyway?\n\nConsider another approach, that taken in Geneva. The fact that large settlements are immovable means the June 4, 1967, border is not feasible, but the principle of defining a border on the basis of June 4 certainly is. America needs to offer support, and fast, for a 1:1 land swap to insure that territories allotted to Israel and Palestine are equivalent in area to what existed on June 4. It should appoint a Quartet commission, answerable to Senator Mitchell, to suggest a map. Palestine is not Israel's internal affair, nor will Palestinians ever accept the border envisioned by Netanyahu. Only a new \"international\" map will reconcile the Arab League peace initiative with the difficulties of moving settlers back into Israel.\n\nSketching a border will bring obvious immediate benefits, such as helping government officials, businesspeople and others on both sides to plan and invest. But it will also help prepare the ground to evacuate those who must ultimately be moved. This will take years, just like moderating Hamas by rehabilitating the Palestinian Authority will take years. The Israel Defense Forces and the police could never muster enough manpower to simply move these settlers by force - anyway, many IDF officers sympathize with settlement.\n\n2. This article by Hedva Isschar recounts the difficult employmentand unemploymentconditions for Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nNot Only in Tunnels, Not Only in Gaza, Hedva Isschar, Hagada Hasmalit (translated into English and re-published by the Alternative Information Center), 7/23/09\n\nIn a shocking report published earlier this month about children employed in Gaza tunnels, Anwar, a 15 year old boy from Gaza, relates how he has been made redundant following destruction by the Israeli air force of the tunnel in which he worked. Approximately half of the 16,000 Palestinians who work in tunnels in Gaza, the aforementioned report contends, are youth and children. They work at difficult and dangerous physical labor for about NIS 10 each hour. Many of them suffer from fears and are addicted to pain killers. Anwar is now unemployed, but it appears he hopes to return to his dangerous work and not to school. Anwar told the journalist that school is pointless. The boy is smart. What is the point of studying when your economic horizon is limited to employment in tunnels? And how can you study when your family's economic survival depends on you?\n\nA report of the International Labor Organization (ILO) about the situation of Palestinian workers in the Occupied Palestinian Territories, published in May of this year, determines that every worker in Gaza supports approximately 8.8 people. This is the bad news. The good news is that in the West Bank each worker supports only 4.4 people, on average. These workers have still not been told how the planned economic peace will look for them, but they know only too well the economic reality in which they live under occupation, which from the onset has subsumed the Palestinian economy to the needs of Israel.\n\nAccording to data of the World Bank, the per capita gross national product in the West Bank is US$487. The level of official unemployment is approaching 20%. In the industrial and agricultural areas of settlements we find approximately 26,000 Palestinian workers, women and men, including approximately 2,000 minors. A majority of the youth and children work in fields and orchards in the Jordan Valley. Some of them replace their fathers and uncles who worked in Israel or in the settlements until their work permits were annulled for various reasons, which are never explained. According to the ILO, the employment level of those 15 and older in the West Bank was a bit more than 34% at the end of 2008. However, more than half of the young people from the age of high school to 29 do not work and do not study. The ILO describes this phenomenon as a waste of precious manpower.\n\n3. James Besser writes in The Jewish Week about the recent convention of Christians United for Israel (CUFI), a pro-Israel evangelical group, and CUFI's support of the Israeli Jewish settlers in the West Bank. (You can go here to see the Rapture Ready video by Max Blumenthal mentioned in Besser's piece.)\n\nChristians United for Settlements? James Besser, The Jewish Week, 7/23/09\n\nFrom the beginning, CUFI has embraced the Israeli settlers movement in a way no major Jewish group has.\n\nCUFI conventions have a highly visible and still growing settlers presence; at an AIPAC policy conference, you'd be hard pressed to find any identifiable representative of a settler organization or community, certainly none on the official program.\n\nThis week CUFI's John Hagee, in a public message to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said he backs Israel's sovereign right to grow and develop the settlements of Israel as you see fit and not yield to the pressure of the United States government.\n\nThat's a formulation you won't hear any major American Jewish pro-Israel group use. They agree on the sovereign part, they'll rally their troops to fight pressure on the Jewish state and they might even talk positively but carefully about natural growth, but they'll do everything possible to avoid using the term settlements or give the appearance that they support leaving them on the West Bank.\n\nThere are many Christians at any CUFI event who believe that God gave all the land to the Jews  meaning Gaza and the West Bank, as well as Israel proper. Only a very small proportion of American Jews share that belief, and it's not the policy of any major Jewish group.\n\nOne wonders: if CUFI is, indeed, the largest pro-Israel group in the nation in terms of membership, and if it is winning growing acceptance among the Jewish pro-Israel leadership, how might that impact a broader pro-Israel movement that has generally regarded the issue of settlements and settlers as too radioactive to touch? How might that influence a movement that has regarded supporting settlements as a losing issue, both with politicians and the public?\n\nGaza Digest 108, 7/23/09\n\nNews Clips: Israel will remove from school textbooks an Arabic term (nakba) that describes its creation in 1948 as a \"catastrophe\", the Education Ministry said on Wednesday; Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Wednesday that Israel has no intention of dismantling the West Bank separation fence (also known as the apartheid wall or the annexation barrier) which he called \"a critical component of Israel's security\"; A group of Israeli rabbis, headed by Chief Rabbi Shlomo Amar, have sent a letter to U.S. rabbis and the President's Conference, urging them to exert political leverage in Israel's favor, Israel Radio reported on Wednesday; Relations between the Obama administration and the Israeli government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continue to worsen over Israel's refusal to halt new construction in Jewish settlements, but as the Obama administration continues to press for a freeze to all new units, real estate agents are reporting a rush by Israeli Jews to buy apartments both in east Jerusalem and the West Bank; On Tuesday, 21 July 2009, a wedding party of the Dahlan family in Khan Younis in Gaza was attacked when an explosive device exploded in the area and 61 civilians were injured.\n\n1. This week, CODEPINK announced the launch of its Stolen Beauty AHAVA boycott campaign. I penned a piece that is posted on the Pink Tank, and yesterday was posted on Common Dreams and Altnernet. If you feel inspired, please go to these sites and make comments so we can generate some buzz for our Stolen Beauty campaign.\n\nStolen Beauty: The Struggle for a Just Peace in the Middle East Coming to a Store Near You, Nancy Kricorian, 7/22/09, Common Dreams & Alternet\n\nhttp://www.commondreams.org/view/2009/07/22-10\n\nhttp://www.alternet.org/action/141483/\n\nExcerpt: As the dust settled on the destroyed homes, schools and lives in the aftermath of Israel's assault on Gaza earlier this year, mainstream human rights groups from Amnesty International to Physicians for Human Rights/Israel issued reports condemning Israel's attack and alleging that the Israeli government and the Israeli Defense Forces had committed war crimes and crimes against humanity. The staff of CODEPINK Women for Peace re-opened a discussion of what we could do about Israel's flagrant flouting of international law and the brutality of the ongoing blockade of Gaza, the occupation of the West Bank and the home demolitions in East Jerusalem. We decided to revisit the idea of a boycott against Israeli productsa boycott that was having more difficulty gaining traction here in the United States than in Europe. But the best way to end an occupation is to make it unprofitable, and one of the best peaceful ways to make something unprofitable is to organize a boycott.\n\n2. As a direct response to the rising power of J Street, the pro-Israel, pro-peace lobbying group, a new group called Z Street has been born, as reported in the Palestine Chronicle.\n\nZ Street: The New Zionist Extremist Group, Stephen Lendman, The Palestine Chronicle, 7/22/09\n\nOn July 6, co-founders Lori Lowenthal Marcus and Allyson Rowen Taylor announced: \"Z Street is launched, Will end J Street Treason.\"\n\nContinuing they said: \"welcome to Z street! No more appeasement, no more negotiating with terrorists, no more enabling cowards who fear offending more than they fear another Holocaust. Z STREET is for those who are willing not only to support - but to defend - Israel, the Jewish State.\"\n\nNever mind that no nation threatens Israel nor has for decades. It's a regional superpower - nuclearized and defended by the world's fourth most powerful military, armed with the latest state-of-the-art weapons and technology, and not reluctant to use them.\n\nIts only adversaries are self-made and are needed to justify oppression, a culture of violence, an ethnocracy, exclusivity, privilege, and Jewish exceptionalism over others deemed inferior, legitimate enemies, and terrorists.\n\nZionism is corrosive, destructive, racist, extremist, undemocratic and hateful.\n\n-- it claims Jewish supremacy, specialness and uniqueness as God's \"chosen people;\"\n\n-- espouses violence, not peaceful coexistence;\n\n-- confrontation over diplomacy;\n\n-- strength through militarism, intimidation, and naked aggression;\n\n-- is what Joel Kovel calls \"a machine for the manufacture of human rights abuses\" led by real terrorists posing as democrats;\n\n-- what others say is repugnant, indefensible, destructive and malignant; and\n\n-- what author Alan Hart calls \"the real enemy of the Jews;\"\n\n-- an ideology contemptuous of Judaism's moral values and ethical principles;\n\n-- the driving force behind a re-awakened anti-Semitism; and\n\n-- a monster that's consuming its host and threatening humanity.\n\nThat's what Z Street supports.\n\nIts Founders Have Disturbing Resumes\n\nBased in Philadelphia, Lori Lowenthal Marcus writes about Israel and the Middle East for media outlets like the pro-Israeli American Thinker. She's also affiliated with the extremist Zionist Organization of America (ZOA).\n\nFrom Los Angeles, Allyson Rowen Taylor is associate director of the 2001-founded Stand With Us, a pro-Israeli front group calling itself:\n\n-- \"an international education organization that ensures that Israel's side of the story is told in communities, campuses, libraries, the media and churches through brochures, speakers, conferences, missions to Israel, and thousands of pages of Internet resources.\"\n\nIn other words, it's a pro-Israeli mouthpiece promoting Zionist extremism at the expense of truth and an equitable resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n3. In Haaretz, Amira Hass gives her analysis of the recent Breaking the Silence report on Israeli Defense Forces testimonies about what happened in Gaza during Operation Cast Lead.\n\nThe IDF Price Tag, Amira Hass, Haaretz, 7/23/09\n\nExcerpt: Something in the soldiers' testimonies published by the organization Breaking the Silence last week must be scaring the Israel Defense Forces. Otherwise, its battery of spokespeople - official and unofficial - would not be taking part in such a violent campaign to silence it.\n\nOur media is independent. It isn't the delegitimization campaign that has caused it to be dismissive of these testimonies. Unlike the Second Lebanon War, Operation Cast Lead has been relegated to the archaeology department as far as public interest goes, because the number of Israelis killed was low. Even without the lobbying of the IDF Spokesman's Office, the media did not intend to waste much energy on these testimonies.\n\nBreaking the Silence managed to reach soldiers who were not selected by the army, and to speak to them despite their commanders' strict prohibition against divulging details of the operation outside the military complex. However, the IDF can still be proud of its ability to impose discipline. Not one of the soldiers interviewed contacted the organization on their own. Of the thousands of soldiers whom Breaking the Silence and its volunteers contacted, only a few dozen agreed to talk. The interviewees, incidentally, think the military onslaught was justified but their consciences were bothered by a number of phenomena. All of them participated in the ground offensive. Not one was a pilot or someone who by pressing a button released missiles from unmanned aircraft, though most of the killing and destruction was caused from the air.\n\nBreaking the Silence's policy is to publish cases about which two or more soldiers from the same unit have given evidence. They have other testimonies about far graver incidents, but these have not been corroborated. So in the booklet published last week there are only a few testimonies about killings of civilians that could have been prevented without a doubt.\n\nThe silencing and slander campaign is directed at the members of Breaking the Silence, but its aim is different. The mudslinging is the IDF's price tag, like the fires that outpost inhabitants set in Palestinian fields. The settlers are warning the authorities against an attempt to evacuate them, and the IDF is warning soldiers who have not yet defied the order to remain silent. It is doing this to make it harder for Breaking the Silence to continue carrying out its moral obligation to talk with soldiers and paint a complete picture of the attack - the picture Israel is trying to blur at any price.\n\nTruths ultimately come out in a society like ours, but time is a critical factor. Testimony published five years from now is not the same as testimony published today, when Palestinian and foreign human rights activists are preparing lawsuits abroad against top government and military officials for violating international law and worse.\n\nThe current booklet documents the \"lighter\" things - relatively. The testimonies taken down and published by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the international commission of inquiry, the foreign press and Haaretz include far graver cases.\n\nThe testimonies in the booklet prove again and again the reliability of the testimony by Palestinians. And vice versa: The Palestinian affidavits prove the authenticity of the soldiers' statements.\n\nGaza Digest 107, 7/22/09\n\nNews Clips: Former U.S. presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee plans to broadcast his weekend show on Fox News from the site of a disputed Israeli construction project in East Jerusalem, a New York State Assemblyman Dov Hikind has told Haaretz; The Israeli police's Shai District, which is responsible for the West Bank, has set up a special dedicated command to handle preparations for a large-scale evacuation of illegal settlement outposts; Israel is planning to remove 23 \"illegal outposts\" from the West Bank in the course of a single day in response to mounting US demands that it halt all settlement activity, it was reported today; Jewish settlements in the West Bank get significantly bigger slice of Israeli government financial help than municipalities in Israel itself, according to a study published on Tuesday; Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said Tuesday that Israel had an \"indisputable\" right to build anywhere in Jerusalem, including East Jerusalem, following international calls on Israel to halt construction in the disputed area; U.S. Middle East peace envoy George Mitchell is calling an \"utter fabrication\" a claim by Elliott Abrams, a former Bush administration official, that he \"reportedly\" plans to retire by the end of the year, according to a State Department official who spoke to Foreign Policy on Mitchell's behalf;\n\n1. An undercover army of Israeli Jewish young people is being mobilized to help Brand Israel promote a positive image on the internet, according to this report by Jonathan Cook from Countercurrents.\n\nTwitterers Paid to Spread Israeli Propaganda, Jonathan Cook, Countercurrents.org, 7/21/09\n\nExcerpt: The passionate support for Israel expressed on talkback sections of websites, internet chat forums, blogs, Twitters and Facebook may not be all that it seems. Israel's foreign ministry is reported to be establishing a special undercover team of paid workers whose job it will be to surf the internet 24 hours a day spreading positive news about Israel.\n\nInternet-savvy Israeli youngsters, mainly recent graduates and demobilised soldiers with language skills, are being recruited to pose as ordinary surfers while they provide the government's line on the Middle East conflict.\n\nTo all intents and purposes the internet is a theatre in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and we must be active in that theatre, otherwise we will lose, said Ilan Shturman, who is responsible for the project. The existence of an internet warfare team came to light when it was included in this year's foreign ministry budget.\n\nAbout $150,000 has been set aside for the first stage of development, with increased funding expected next year. The team will fall under the authority of a large department already dealing with what Israelis term hasbara, officially translated as public explanation but more usually meaning propaganda. That includes not only government public relations work but more secretive dealings the ministry has with a battery of private organisations and initiatives that promote Israel's image in print, on TV and online.\n\nIn an interview this month with the Calcalist, an Israeli business newspaper, Mr Shturman, the deputy director of the ministry's hasbara department, admitted his team would be working undercover. Our people will not say: Hello, I am from the hasbara department of the Israeli foreign ministry and I want to tell you the following.' Nor will they necessarily identify themselves as Israelis, he said. They will speak as net-surfers and as citizens, and will write responses that will look personal but will be based on a prepared list of messages that the foreign ministry developed.\n\n2. More land expropriation as Israel prepares to declare the Dead Sea Shore in the Palestinian West Bank as state land, according to this report from Agence France Presse.\n\nIsrael to declare Dead Sea shore state land: Peace Now, Agence France Presse, 7/21/09\n\nExcerpt: The Israeli government has decided to register as state property West Bank land that has emerged as a result of Dead Sea shrinkage, an anti-settlement group said on Tuesday.\n\n\"Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to declare as state land some 138,600 dunums (34,650 acres) that has appeared along the Dead Sea in the occupied West Bank due to the drop in the water level,\" Hagit Ofran of the Peace Now group told AFP.\n\nThe government published its decision in the Arabic-language press on June 28 and the public has 45 days from that date to file any objections. The land is located along the shore of the Dead Sea in the West Bank.\n\nThe group said that based on public announcements, the amount of land involved may go beyond the shoreline that has been exposed as a result of the drop in the sea's water level, an estimated metre (yard) every year.\n\n\"It would appear that the primary purpose of registering this area as 'state land' is to prevent Palestinian use of the land or any Palestinian assertion of ownership over it,\" the group said in a statement.\n\n3. Prime Minister Netanyahu's claim that Jerusalem is an open city where Palestinians can purchase homes in West Jerusalem while Jewish Israelis move into East Jerusalem is debunked by this report from Haaretz.\n\nMost Arabs can't buy most homes in West Jerusalem, Nir Hasson, 7/21/09\n\nExcerpt: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu claimed this week that Jerusalem is an \"open city\" that permits all its inhabitants, Jewish and Palestinian, to purchase homes in both its eastern and western parts.\n\n\"Our policy is that Jerusalem residents can purchase apartments anywhere in the city. There is no ban on Arabs buying apartments in the west of the city, and there is no ban on Jews building or buying in the city's east,\" Netanyahu said in response to the U.S. request to halt a Jewish construction project in East Jerusalem.\n\nAn examination by Haaretz, however, presented a rather different situation on the ground. According to Israel Lands Administration rules, residents of East Jerusalem cannot take ownership of the vast majority of Jerusalem homes.\n\nWhen an Israeli citizen purchases an apartment or house, ownership of the land remains with the ILA, which leases it to the purchaser for a period of 49 years, enabling the registration of the home (\"tabu\"). Article 19 of the ILA lease specifies that a foreign national cannot lease - much less own - ILA land.\n\nAttorney Yael Azoulay, of Zeev and Naomi Weil Lawyers and Notary Office, explains that if a foreign national purchases an apartment they must show the ILA proof of eligibility to immigrate to Israel in accordance with the Law of Return. Non-Jewish foreigners cannot purchase apartments. This group includes Palestinians from the east of the city, who have Israeli identity cards but are residents rather than citizens of Israel.\n\n4. And finally, an article from The Electronic Intifada about the boom in settlement construction and expansion in the West Bank.\n\nSettlers expand in West Bank, Mel Frykberg, The Electronic Intifada, 7/21/09\n\nExcerpt: While settlement construction booms and the number of settlers in Beitar and its outposts continues to swell, Palestinians in Wadi Fuqin are forbidden by the Israeli authorities from building new homes, or enlarging current ones to accommodate new generations.\n\nIPS accompanied Palestinian Authority (PA) agricultural ministry officials on a tour of Bethlehem and surrounding villages to assess first-hand the shrinking land available to Palestinians as settlement expansion in the West Bank accelerates.\n\n\"We are facing a disaster,\" says PA Agriculture Minister Dr Ismail Da'iq. \"We are losing land at an unprecedented rate due to Israeli settlement expansion and its closed military zones.\"\n\n\"In order to combat this continual land theft we have launched a project which aims to plant five million trees on land in the Bethlehem governorate over the next five years,\" Da'iq told IPS. \"We hope this will make it harder for Israel to expropriate our land, but this is not a guarantee.\"\n\nIndeed, on way from Ramallah to Bethlehem this IPS correspondent saw several dozen Palestinian trees that had been sawed off just above ground level by the Israeli authorities.\n\nUnder the 1993 Oslo accords, 66 percent of the Bethlehem governorate was designated as part of Area C of the West Bank, which falls under complete Israeli jurisdiction in regard to planning and construction.\n\n\"The PA made a mistake by agreeing to this during Oslo, but it is one we hope to rectify. We are determined that there will be no resumption of peace talks until Israel freezes all settlement activity in the West Bank,\" Da'iq told IPS.\n\nGaza Digest 106, 7/21/09\n\nNews Clips: The Israeli government is considering confiscating privately-owned Palestinian land near the West Bank settlement of Ofra, contrary to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's pledge during his Bar-Ilan speech not to take such actions; US Mideast envoy George Mitchell may want to leave his negotiator position at the end of 2009 because of professional differences' with Hillary Clinton and his displeasure at the appointment of Dennis Ross as a Special Advisor on the Middle East, Elliott Abrams said in an editorial published by the National Review on Monday; The United States believes that unilateral moves on the part of either Israel or the Palestinians could prejudice the result of final status negotiations, the State Department said on Monday, in response to questions about a conflict between the U.S. and Israel over new construction of housing for Israeli Jews in East Jerusalem (more on this topic below); Israeli settlers on horseback set fire on Monday to at least 1,500 Palestinian-owned olive trees in the West Bank as others stoned cars after security forces a few hours before had razed a number of structures built in unauthorized outposts in the West Bank; An Israeli Cabinet committee approved a new bill that prohibits state funding for activities that mark the Palestinian Nakba, or the Catastrophe, which takes place on Israel's Independence Day and is marked as a day of mourning by Palestinians.\n\n1. Last week (Gaza Digest 102, 7/13/09) I reported on an Israeli Cellcom ad that created a stir because it showed IDF soldiers happily kicking a ball back and forth over the annexation wall (best locution yet!) with unseen Palestinians. You can see the ad here. And today some Palestinians from Bilin posted on YouTube their brilliant response to the ad, which includes footage from this past Friday's weekly protest at the annexation barrier.\n\n2. Last Thursday, the U.S. State Department voiced its objections to a proposed plan to build 20 apartments for Israeli Jews in a Palestinian neighborhood in East Jerusalem. This article from Haaretz details Netanhayu's reponse, as well as the U.S. position that East Jerusalem is an occupied territory whose disposition will be part of a final settlement of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.\n\nExcerpt: The United States views East Jerusalem as no different than an illegal West Bank outpost with regard to its demand for a freeze on settlement construction, American sources have informed both Israel and the Palestinian Authority.\n\nThis clarification came in the context of a growing crisis in U.S.-Israel relations over the planned construction of some 20 apartments for Jews in the Shepherd Hotel, in East Jerusalem's Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. The U.S. has demanded that the project be halted, but Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the cabinet meeting Sunday that \"Israel will not agree to edicts of this kind in East Jerusalem.\"\n\n\"United Jerusalem is the capital of the Jewish people in the State of Israel, and our sovereignty over the city is not subject to appeal,\" he continued. \"Our policy is that Jerusalem residents can purchase apartments anywhere in the city. This has been the policy of all Israeli governments. There is no ban on Arabs buying apartments in the west of the city, and there is no ban on Jews building or buying in the city's east. This is the policy of an open city.\"\n\nSaying that Israel could not accept Jews being forbidden to live in anywhere in Jerusalem, Netanyahu added: \"I can imagine what would happen if someone proposed that Jews could not live or buy in certain neighborhoods of London, New York, Paris or Rome. A huge international outcry would surely ensue. It is even more impossible to agree to such an edict in East Jerusalem.\"\n\n3. Prime Minister Netanyahu has actually uttered the words two states for two peoples, but the Israeli right is uncharacteristically silent about this betrayal because no one believes that Netanyahu is doing anything more than parroting phrases he has no intention of working towards. Isabel Kershner outlines the situation in this article from the New York Times.\n\nNetanhyahu's Talk of Peace Finds Few True Believers, Isabel Kershner, 7/20/09\n\nEscerpt: Mr. Netanyahu has been explicit, though, about his conditions for a deal. He says the Palestinians must recognize Israel as the state of the Jewish people. Palestinian negotiators reject such recognition, contending it would preclude the demand of the Palestinian refugees of 1948 and their descendants for the right of return to their former homes, and be detrimental to the status of Israel's Arab minority.\n\nMr. Netanyahu adds that the problem of the refugees has to be resolved outside the borders of Israel and that Israel will only accept defensible borders, and he wants international guarantees that any Palestinian state will be fully demilitarized.\n\nTo that his aides have lately added that there is currently no Palestinian partner who can deliver the essential conditions for statehood as outlined by Mr. Netanyahu, or who is capable of making the historic compromise necessary for a final peace deal.\n\nIt is a familiar refrain: For years, leaders from the Likud Party refused to negotiate on grounds that Yasir Arafat, the strongman of Palestinian nationalism who many Israelis viewed as a dictatorial terrorist, was no partner for peace. Now his successor, Mahmoud Abbas, the Western-backed Palestinian president who has shunned violence against Israelis, is held in disregard for being domestically weak.\n\nThe Israeli leaders note that Mr. Abbas does not control Gaza, which was taken over by his Hamas rivals two years ago. They add that it is doubtful how much he controls what they call Judea and Samaria, the biblical name for the West Bank, and say that if the Israeli Army were to leave the area it could turn into another Hamastan.\n\nMr. Netanyahu's string of conditions for a Palestinian state do seem to have ameliorated opposition from the Israeli right.\n\nIn the past, Israeli discourse on diplomacy has chiefly addressed the Palestinian need for a state but did not establish parallel Israeli rights, said Dore Gold, president of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, a research institute, and a former ambassador who has long been close to Mr. Netanyahu.\n\nThe prime minister, he said, tried to correct that asymmetry by publicly defining fundamental Israeli interests for the first time.\n\nBut Mr. Netanyahu's father, Benzion Netanyahu, the 100-year-old historian and staunch right-wing ideologue, told Israel's Channel 2 News on July 8 that his son had set conditions he knew the Palestinians would never be able to accept.\n\n4. Al-Jazeera's Ayman Mohyeldin reports on a thriving business of Israeli Jewish guided tours to the settlements in the West Bank. The video clip is only three minutes long and is posted on YouTube.\n\nSettlement Tourism Takes Root in West Bank, Ayman Mohyeldin, Al-Jazeera, 7/16/09\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch? v=scLleNsMc2U\n\nExcerpt: Thousands of tourists visiting the Middle East each year have plenty of reasons to travel to the region. But for a small minority the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a draw, prompting enterprising tour operators to take people on guided tours of the illegal settlements in the West Bank.\n\nGaza Digest 105, 7/17/09\n\nNews Clips: Israeli warships opened fire on the shores of the Gaza Strip on Friday morning, scaring Palestinian fishermen, but no damage or injuries were reported; Representatives of an anti-Zionist, ultra-Orthodox Jewish sect paid a brief visit to the Gaza Strip on Thursday on a solidarity mission with the area's militantly anti-Israel Hamas leaders; While the military has attacked the credibility of soldiers' testimonies regarding Operation Cast Lead, including the latest report from Breaking the Silence, it has failed to open a single serious investigation into events detailed by Palestinian witnesses to the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem; A freeze on Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank could help restart the peace process in the region, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said on Thursday; Palestinian militants fired a Qassam rocket from the northern Gaza Strip into Southern Israel Thursday evening, but no injuries were reported; The Palestinian Authority ordered the closure of Al-Jazeera television in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday for airing \"false\" information in a broadcast that reported on conspiracy allegations that Palestinian Authority President Abbas had been involved in the death of Yasser Arafat; In Gaza, Hamas \"condemned\" the closure of Al-Jazeera, saying in a statement that the move was \"further proof of the scale of violations committed against the media on the part of the government in Ramallah\"; The Palestinian Center for Human Rights (PCHR) has been denied access to clients detained by the Internal Security Service (ISS) of the Government in Gaza.\n\n1. The Washington Post revealed that former U.S. senior diplomat Thomas Pickering met with Hamas leaders in Switzerland last month. U.S. officials claim the meeting happened without official government approval and they only learned about it after the fact. While the U.S. is pushing hard for a negotiated settlement in the region, there is, as the Post puts it, no clear plan for how to address the presence of an organization that won 2006 Palestinian legislative elections but does not recognize Israel and remains committed to armed insurrection against the Jewish state.\n\nEx-U.S. Diplomat Talks With Hamas, Howard Schneider and Glenn Kessler, The Washington Post, 7/16/09\n\nExcerpt: A recent lull in rocket fire and other attacks, coupled with Meshal's speech and a visit to Gaza by former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, has led to speculation that Hamas is trying to earn a place at the negotiating table. Others argue that the group is simply pausing to rearm and will never accept the conditions laid out by the United States and others -- including a renunciation of violence and acceptance of earlier Palestinian agreements acknowledging Israel.\n\nYuval Diskin, head of Israel's internal security organization, Shin Bet, said at a closed briefing in May that he saw practically no chance of a political compromise and that Israel would ultimately have to overthrow Hamas in Gaza, according to an account of his comments provided by someone who attended the briefing.\n\nMeshal's speech, delivered from Damascus, the Syrian capital, was considered an overture to Obama. \"The purpose of the speech was to convince the West that Hamas is a partner for dialogue,\" retired Israeli Brig. Gen. Shlomo Brom, director of the Israeli-Palestinian Relations Program at Tel Aviv University, wrote in a recent paper. \"The speech will make it easier for elements in Western Europe and within Obama's administration that support dialogue with Hamas to advance their position.\"\n\nBut U.S. and Israeli officials say they see little substantive change in Meshal's position. Meshal and other Hamas officials have said that hostilities might end for a decade or more through an extended truce, but that they are not interested in reconciling with Israel over the long term.\n\n\"There is a recognition that Israel exists,\" said Omar Abdel-Razeq, who was elected to the Palestinian Legislative Council from Hamas in 2006 and was recently released from Israeli prison. \"The recognition of its right to exist is another matter. I don't think time lies on the Israeli side. What if the balance of power shifts?\"\n\n2. This article by Jonathan Cook from The Electronic Intifada examines the West Bank town of Jenin as the model of economic peace that Netanyahu is holding out to the Palestinians. With a bridge that connects the town to Israel now open 7 days a week and 24-hours a day, the Israeli government is encouraging Israeli Palestinians to go shopping in Jenin on the weekends (when Israeli Jewish stores are closed for Shabbat).\n\nIsrael offers Palestinians day shoppers, not statehood, Jonathan Cook, The Electronic Intifada, 7/15/09\n\nExcerpt: If few of Jenin's inhabitants question the financial benefits of Israel's more liberal policy, there is a widespread belief that \"economic peace\" is being tailor-made for Israel's benefit in much the same manner as the rebuilt camp.\n\n\"If Netanyahu thinks we'll be satisfied with a few more Israeli shoppers, he's kidding himself,\" said Mohammed Larool, a melon seller. \"Our rights as a nation are more important than my selling a few extra melons.\"\n\nKhaled Hamour, 26, who runs the Mankal restaurant in Jenin, said the prosperity felt by businesses was relative. \"Things have been so dire here that just a little relief feels like a major change.\"\n\nBut \"as long as the settlements are still here, our farmers are being shot at, and we have no control over our borders, then economic peace is hollow.\"\n\nShir Hever, an Israeli economist based in Jerusalem, said he was skeptical Jenin's industrial park would ever open, or that the fruits of economic peace would be more than temporary.\n\n\"Netanyahu has no long-term plan for peace,\" he said. \"This is a delaying tactic and an attempt to improve Israel's image internationally without making significant concessions.\"\n\nHe added: \"There is also a political message for Jenin and the rest of the West Bank in this policy. It says: remember you're lucky not to be in the same situation as Gaza. Don't resist or you'll end up like them.\"\n\n3. This article from the Jerusalem Post details the use of undercover cops, disguised as Palestinian protestors, at the anti-wall demonstrations in Nil'in.\n\nUndercover Cops Used in Fence Protest, Yaakov Katz, Jerusalem Post, 7/15/09\n\nExcerpt: Last Friday, officers from the [IDF] Border Police's elite YAMAS undercover unit disguised themselves as Palestinians and stood among a crowd of demonstrators from Nil'in who were protesting against the construction of the security fence nearby.\n\nIn a video posted on the Web site of the International Solidarity Movement (ISM), three Palestinians wearing shirts over their heads to cover their faces are seen using a metal cutter to dismantle part of the chain-linked security barrier.\n\nSuddenly, two other demonstrators approach, pull out guns and knock two of the Palestinian demonstrators to the ground. The crowd realizes that the so-called demonstrators are actually undercover policemen and begins hurling rocks at them. The policemen are then seen firing several shots into the air before herding away the two captured demonstrators.\n\nSources in the Central Command confirmed on Tuesday that undercover YAMAS border policemen were used to help suppress the demonstrators at Nil'in as part of the IDF's increasing efforts to prevent clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and security forces.\n\nGaza Digest 104, 7/15/09\n\nNews Clips: On Tuesday witnesses said that Israeli tanks rolled into farm lands in Bit Hanon town in Northern Gaza and opened fire at residents' homes, then bulldozers destroyed nearby fields; The American Jewish The Orthodox Union says it is \"deeply troubled\" by President Obama's desire to play an \"evenhanded\" role in the Middle East; Yisrael Katz, Israel's new right-wing minister of transport, has revealed a plan to change the names of more than 2,500 road signs, doing away with Arabic place names and replacing them with simple translations of Hebrew names in a move that has stirred up accusations of ethnic cleansing of road signage; Israeli authorities on Tuesday refused to allow more than a dozen French diplomats entry into the Gaza Strip as part of an Israeli protest over the fact that Israel Defense Forces soldier Gilad Shalit is still captive in the Gaza Strip without basic rights; A Leonard Cohen concert planned in Ramallah on the West Bank in September has been cancelled by its hosts who felt the Ramallah appearance was a hollow attempt to balance his planned Tel Aviv performance in the face of calls for Cohen to join the cultural boycott of Israel;\n\n1. While a recent Amnesty International report on the Gaza assault found no evidence that Hamas used civilians as human shields, as had been claimed by the Israeli government, this piece from The Independent reports that the IDF used Palestinian civilians as human shields and gives other damning details from a new document released by Breaking the Silence. Coverage of Breaking the Silence's report has been wide, with articles from Agence France Presse, The Associated Press, Reuters, and The Toronto Star, among others.\n\nIsraeli soldiers reveal the brutal truth of Gaza attack, Donald McIntyre, The Independent, 7/15/09\n\nExcerpt: The first eye-witness accounts of the war by serving Israeli reservists and conscripts describes the Israeli use of Palestinian civilians as \"human shields\". They detail the killing of at least two civilians, the vandalism, looting and wholesale destruction of Palestinian houses, the use of deadly white phosphorus, bellicose religious advice from army rabbis and what another battalion commander described to his troops as \"insane firepower with artillery and air force\". The reports amount to the most formidable challenge by Israelis since the Gaza war to the military's own considered view that it conducted the operation according to international law and made \"an enormous effort to focus its fire only against the terrorists whilst doing the utmost to avoid harming uninvolved civilians\".\n\nThey are contained in testimonies from about 30 soldiers that were collected by Breaking the Silence, an army veterans organisation that seeks to \"expose the Israeli public to the routine situations of everyday life in the occupied territories\". Although the organisation has collected hundreds of testimonies from ex-soldiers before, this is the first time that it has done so from serving soldiers so soon after the events they describe.\n\n2. A long, elegantly written and wry commentary by Saree Makdisi, professor of English and comparative literature at UCLA and author of Palestine Inside Out: An Everyday Occupation, from Al-Ahram Weekly. If you have the time, you should read the entire piece. I've excerpted a few representative paragraphs.\n\nCommentary: Take it or leave it, Saree Makdisi, Al-Ahram Weekly, July 9-15 09\n\nExcerpt: What Netanyahu was saying to any Palestinians foolish enough to accept his terms is that if they want to stick a flag in their archipelago of little impoverished islands of territory and call it a state, they can go right ahead.\n\nBut for them to get even that far, they must first, he now says, recognise Israel as a Jewish state. This is a new Israeli demand (it first came up during the build-up to the doomed Annapolis summit in November 2007), the latest in a sequence of such demands going back to the 1970s. First the Palestinians had to renounce terrorism; then they had to recognise Israel; then they had to rewrite their national charter; then they had to tear the charter up; then they had to say -- again, louder -- that they recognise Israel's right to exist; then they had to end all resistance to four decades of brutal military occupation. Tzipi Livni, Israel's previous foreign minister, even said that the Palestinians had to learn to purge the word Nakba (referring to the catastrophe of 1948) from their vocabulary if they wanted to have a state. The one thing that Palestinians have not formally been asked to do is to say that they are terribly sorry for having dared to resist the occupation in the first place -- and no doubt that demand is on the way as well.\n\nIn return, Israel has had to commit to nothing other than a few vague and craftily-worded -- and endlessly deferrable -- promises. And it has carried out (at its own pace and according to its own terms) a few tactical redeployments of troops and colonists (from a grand total of 18 per cent of the West Bank, at the very peak of Oslo). Some of those redeployments have actually, as in Gaza, made the process of dominating and controlling the Palestinians that much easier (Israel could never have subjected the people of Gaza to the indiscriminate violence it rained on them day and night in late 2008 and early 2009 had the Jewish colonists there remained in place).\n\n3. From the German newspaper Der Spiegel, an article about a move to put customs duties on products made in an Israeli settlement in the West Bank. Another way to make occupation less profitable and thereby less attractive.\n\nWill EU Penalize Exports from Israeli Settlements? Von Ralf Beste and Christoph Schult, Der Spiegel, 7/14/09\n\nExcerpt: Is Europe really willing to express its aversion to Israeli settlements in the West Bank by slapping customs duties on products made in them? A tax court in Hamburg might soon provide an answer to this touchy issue.\n\n**\n\nAs the largest Israeli settlement in the Palestinian-administered areas of the West Bank, Maale Adumim is home to 40,000 people. Bulldozers are clearing lots for new houses on its outskirts. Its population is growing by the week and, in recent years, it has grown faster than any other settlement.\n\nOn the edge of the settlement's industrial zone, there is a factory operated by a company called Soda-Club. The steel gate is painted blue and green to match the company's curvy, modern-looking logo. A camera records the movements of anyone approaching the gate. The plant produces tabletop devices that add carbonation to flat water, like the ones used in many German kitchens. And for those who prefer a sweeter taste, there's also syrup coming out of Maale Adumim.\n\nJournalists are not welcome to visit Soda-Club. As Marketing Director Asaf Snear claims on the telephone, it's to protect against industrial espionage.\n\nBut there's another reason behind this aversion to media attention: Soda-Club's products are at the center of a legal dispute with Germany that could significantly intensify the already heated debate over Israel's settlement policy.\n\nThe Hamburg Finance Court must now decide whether Soda-Club devices made in Maale Adumim can be imported into the European Union duty-free, like all other Israeli industrial products. Brussels doesn't want the company's products to fall into this category because they are manufactured in Israeli settlements located in the occupied territories.\n\nThe real question revolves around whether Maale Adumim is part of Israel. The EU has not formally recognized Israel's claim to Maale Adumim and other settlements. But, in practice, it has done little to stand in the way of Israeli settlement activities.\n\nBut that could now change. The Hamburg court has consulted with the European Court of Justice about obtaining a \"preliminary ruling\" that would settle the issue in a binding manner for all 27 EU member states. The decision is expected to come down in the coming months. If the court decides that a customs duty can be assessed, it will be tantamount to handing down a decision against Israel's settlement policy. The delicate question at hand is whether Germany and the EU should accept how Israel handles the occupied territories or should wield their sharpest sword -- economic sanction.\n\nGaza Digest 103, 7/14/09\n\nNews Clips: Palestinian bulldozers and construction vehicles began removing the rubble of the Saraya security compound in Gaza on Monday, more than six months after Israeli warplanes leveled it; Palestinian sources said Sunday that the Egyptian authorities are preventing a new humanitarian aid convoy, Viva Palestina US, from reaching the Gaza Strip, but the members of the convoy are hoping to reach their destination by Wednesday; The Dead Sea has made the list of candidates for the new \"Seven Natural Wonders of the World\" Friday, after Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas agreed earlier in the week to support the initiative;\n\n1. In an editorial in Haaretz about a new eco-friendly school being built, without impossible to procure legal permits, by the Jahalin Bedouin tribe with the help of an Italian NGO (Vento di Terra/Wind of the Earth) in the West Bank, Amira Hass compares the Israeli Jewish worldview to that of whites under South African apartheid and during the time of slavery in the United States. You can read more about the school project on Jezebel.\n\nIsraeli Jewish Worldview Justifies West Bank Inequality, Amira Hass, Haaretz, 7/13/09\n\nExcerpt: The root of the problem is not the illegality of the settlements and outposts, but the Israeli Jewish worldview that sanctifies inequality. In other words, what is naturally befitting for the Jews ought to be denied the Palestinians. What is painful and lacking for the Jews is not a problem for the Palestinians. The official talk of two states conceals the prevailing reality of one state, from the river to the sea, a state that embraces the South African ideology of \"separate but unequal development of the races.\" All on the same strip of land, all under the rule of the same government.\n\nThe Jews' natural growth and their right to enclose balconies on territories that Israel conquered in 1967 have been the subject of discussions between its top officials and world leaders. The Bedouin exercising their right to educate their children under humane conditions in a place they have lived for the last 61 years has come to be considered a violation of the law.\n\nThe law is determined by man and reflects the current balance of power, either on a global or local scale. Equality, on the other hand, is a human attribute. Throughout history, this attribute has become clearer thanks to never-ending social struggles. Their success - either full or partial - influences the laws.\n\nThere once was a law that forbade black slaves from learning to read and write. There were also criminals who broke the law by studying and teaching. Anyone who issues the order to raze a school for Bedouin, approves the order or carries it out aligns himself with the thinkers, jurists, and law enforcement officials of the slavery regime.\n\n2. Monday, July 13 was International day of solidarity with East Jerusalem residents facing eviction or demolition of their homes, and there were events in the USA, the UK, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Ireland, France, Spain, Denmark, Holland and Egypt. Here is a report from the Chicago banner drops via the International Solidarity Movement. Here is a detailed article from the Palestine Monitor about the different kinds of home demolitions and some individual stories of people whose homes were destroyed.\n\n Chicago activists drop 88 banners across city protesting Israeli eviction and demolition of Palestinian homes, International Solidarity Movement, 7/13/09\n\nExcerpt: Monday, July 13th 2009, 5am: In perhaps the largest campaign of its kind in Chicago's history, over a dozen activists dropped 88 banners across Chicagoland this morning decrying Israel's policies of evicting or destroying Palestinian homes. Each banner represents one of 88 Palestinian homes in the occupied East Jerusalem neighborhood of Silwan that have received demolition orders from Israeli authorities.\n\nToday's banners were dropped as part of an international day of action on July 13th in solidarity with Palestinian families facing house evictions or demolition in the West Bank and occupied East Jerusalem. In addition to Chicago, demonstrations and actions are planned for San Francisco, New York City, London, Paris, Copenhagen, Glasgow, and Jerusalem.\n\nChicago's action saw banners being hung from highway overpasses, bridges, and from the roofs of buildings. Some of the banners read, End the occupation of Palestine, or From Chicago to Palestine, communities are facing eviction, and call for onlookers to Support. Resist. Fight.\n\n3. This news brief from Ma'an about a speech Netanyahu gave on Sunday provides a clear and succinct description of the notion of the right of return and why Palestinians won't accede to the demand that they recognize a Jewish state.\n\n Netanyahu: Palestnian Refugees Must Never Return to Their Homes, Ma'an News Agency, 7/13/09\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged Palestinians to give up the right of return to their homes in what is now Israel as a precondition for a future peace deal.\n\nSpeaking on Sunday evening at a ceremony marking the 105th anniversary of the death of Zionist leader Theodore Herzl, Netanyahu said \"They [Palestinians] must abandon their demand to settle the descendents of Palestinian refugees in Israel and gradually 'eat away' at the State of Israel after a peace agreement is signed,\" according to Israel's Ynet news website.\n\nIn 1948, Jewish and Israeli forces expelled more than 726,000 Palestinians from their homes in the land on which the Israeli state was declared, according to United Nations figures. Today, Palestine refugees and their descendants are some 5.5 million people.\n\nThe Palestinian leadership currently refuses to negotiate with Netanyahu's right wing government because he refuses to order a halt to construction of illegal settlements in the West Bank, and rejects the notion of a fully sovereign Palestinian state.\n\nNetanyahu has also demanded that Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state, an indirect way of foreclosing the right of return, since Israel asserts that its Jewish nature is based on a Jewish majority, a situation that by definition prohibits the refugees' return.\n\nThe Israeli leader repeated this demand on Sunday. \"The Jewish state is the key to our existence and the key to achieving peace with our neighbors,\" he was quoted as saying.\n\nPalestinians argue that the right of return is both a collective and individual right, which, even if Palestinian and Israeli negotiators take it up, cannot legally be forfeited on the behalf of the individual refugees.\n\n4. And finally, a report from Haaretz on a meeting that President Obama held on Monday with Jewish American leaders. In addition to groups listed in the final paragraph, leaders from J Street and Americans for Peace Now were also present.\n\nObama to U.S. Jewish leaders: Israel must engage in self-reflection, Barak Ravid, Haaretz Correspondent, and Reuters, 7/14/09\n\nExcerpt: U.S. President Barack Obama met with 15 American Jewish leaders at the White House for the first time on Monday. The president and the Jewish officials huddled for talks aimed at clearing the air following allegations that his administration was taking a tough line with Israel over settlement activity.\n\nAt the meeting, Obama told the leaders that he wants to help Israel overcome its demographic problem by reaching an agreement on a two-state solution, but that in order to do so, Israel would need \"to engage in serious self-reflection.\"\n\nOn the Iranian nuclear issue, Obama told the leaders that \"the door to dialogue is open. If the Iranians do not walk through it, however, we will have to see how we proceed. But it would be a mistake to talk now about what we're going to do and how we're going to do it.\"\n\nOne of the participants at the meeting asked the president to take a lower profile regarding the public differences between his administration and the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over the United States' demand that Israel freeze all settlement construction activity in the West Bank.\n\n\"This situation is not helpful,\" he told the president, who rejected the request, saying that during the eight years of the Bush administration, such disagreements were never made public but that such an approach was not helpful in advancing the peace process.\n\nObama added that there is a narrow window of opportunity for advancing the peace process and that he plans to speak openly and honestly with Israel - \"a true friend of the U.S.\" - just as he did with the Arab nations in his speech at Cairo University in June.\n\nAmong the groups attending the meeting were the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, the Anti-Defamation League, Hadassah, the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, the National Jewish Democratic Council, the Orthodox Union, the United Jewish Communities, the Union for Reform Judaism, the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, the American Jewish Committee and the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, which is led by long-time Obama acquaintance Alan Solow, who requested the meeting.\n\nGaza Digest 102, 7/13/09\n\nNews Clips: Britain has slapped a partial arms embargo on Israel, refusing to supply replacement "
