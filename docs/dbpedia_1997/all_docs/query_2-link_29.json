        "text": "1\n\nAPPLICATION INSTITUTING PROCEEDINGS\n\nTo the Registrar of the International Court of Justice, the undersigned, being duly authorised by the\n\nGovernment of the Republic of South Africa, state as follows:\n\nIn accordance with Articles 36 (1) and 40 of the Statute of the Court and Article 38 of the Rules of\n\nCourt, I have the honour to submit this Application instituting proceedings in the name of the Republic\n\nof South Africa (“South Africa”) against the State of Israel (“Israel”). Pursuant to Article 41 of the\n\nStatute, the Application includes a request that the Court indicate provisional measures to protect the\n\nrights invoked herein from imminent and irreparable loss.\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\n\n1. This Application concerns acts threatened, adopted, condoned, taken and being taken by the\n\nGovernment and military of the State of Israel against the Palestinian people, a distinct national, racial\n\nand ethnical group, in the wake of the attacks in Israel on 7 October 2023. South Africa unequivocally\n\ncondemns all violations of international law by all parties, including the direct targeting of Israeli\n\ncivilians and other nationals and hostage-taking by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups. No\n\narmed attack on a State’s territory no matter how serious — even an attack involving atrocity crimes —\n\ncan, however, provide any possible justification for, or defence to, breaches of the 1948 Convention on\n\nthe Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (‘Genocide Convention’ or ‘Convention’),1\n\nwhether as a matter of law or morality. The acts and omissions by Israel complained of by South Africa\n\nare genocidal in character because they are intended to bring about the destruction of a substantial part\n\nof the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group, that being the part of the Palestinian group in the\n\nGaza Strip (‘Palestinians in Gaza’). The acts in question include killing Palestinians in Gaza, causing\n\nthem serious bodily and mental harm, and inflicting on them conditions of life calculated to bring about\n\ntheir physical destruction. The acts are all attributable to Israel, which has failed to prevent genocide\n\nand is committing genocide in manifest violation of the Genocide Convention, and which has also\n\nviolated and is continuing to violate its other fundamental obligations under the Genocide Convention,\n\nincluding by failing to prevent or punish the direct and public incitement to genocide by senior Israeli\n\nofficials and others.\n\n2. In preparing this Application, South Africa has paid close attention to the provisions of the\n\nGenocide Convention, to its interpretation, and to its application in the years following its entry into\n\nforce on 12 January 1951, as well as to the jurisprudence of this Court and that of other international\n\ncourts and tribunals, including the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, the\n\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the International Criminal Court. South Africa is highly\n\ncognisant of the fact that acts of genocide are distinct from other violations of international law\n\nsanctioned or perpetrated by the Israeli government and military in Gaza — including intentionally\n\ndirecting attacks against the civilian population, civilian objects and buildings dedicated to religion,\n\neducation, art, science, historic monuments, hospitals, and places where the sick and wounded are\n\ncollected; torture; the starvation of civilians as a method of warfare; and other war crimes and crimes\n\nagainst humanity — though there is often a close connection between all such acts. South Africa is also\n\naware that acts of genocide inevitably form part of a continuum — as Raphaël Lemkin who coined the\n\n1 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (adopted 9 December 1948, entered into force 12\n\nJanuary 1951), 78 UNTS 277.\n\n2\n\nterm ‘genocide’ himself recognised.2 For this reason it is important to place the acts of genocide in the\n\nbroader context of Israel’s conduct towards Palestinians during its 75-year-long apartheid, its 56-yearlong\n\nbelligerent occupation of Palestinian territory and its 16-year-long blockade of Gaza, including the\n\nserious and ongoing violations of international law associated therewith, including grave breaches of\n\nthe Fourth Geneva Convention,3 and other war crimes and crimes against humanity. However, when\n\nreferring in this Application to acts and omissions by Israel which are capable of amounting to other\n\nviolations of international law, South Africa’s case is that those acts and omissions are genocidal in\n\ncharacter, as they are committed with the requisite specific intent (dolus specialis) to destroy\n\nPalestinians in Gaza as a part of the broader Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group.\n\n3. South Africa is acutely aware of the particular weight of responsibility in initiating proceedings\n\nagainst Israel for violations of the Genocide Convention. However, South Africa is also acutely aware\n\nof its own obligation — as a State party to the Genocide Convention — to prevent genocide. Israel’s\n\nacts and omissions in relation to Palestinians violate the Genocide Convention. That is the shared view\n\nof numerous other States parties to the Convention, including the State of Palestine itself, which has\n\ncalled on “world leaders” to “take responsibility… to stop the genocide against our people”.4 United\n\nNations experts have also repeatedly sounded “the alarm” for over 10 weeks that “[c]onsidering\n\nstatements made by Israeli political leaders and their allies, accompanied by military action in Gaza and\n\nescalation of arrests and killing in the West Bank” there is a “risk of genocide against the Palestinian\n\npeople”.5 United Nations experts have also expressed their “profound … concern” about “the failure of\n\nthe international system to mobilise to prevent genocide” against Palestinians, and have called on the\n\n“international community” to “do everything it can to immediately end the risk of genocide against the\n\nPalestinian people”.6 The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (‘CERD’), acting\n\nunder its ‘early warning and urgent action procedure’, has also called on “all State parties” to the\n\nGenocide Convention to “fully respect” their “obligation to prevent… genocide”.7 This application by\n\nSouth Africa and its request for the indication of provisional measures fall to be considered in that\n\ncontext and in the light of those calls. It is made against the background of South Africa’s foreign policy\n\nobjective for the attainment of a durable peace between Israel and the State of Palestine, with two States\n\nexisting side by side within internationally recognised borders, based on those existing on 4 June 1967,\n\nprior to the outbreak of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, in line with all relevant United Nations resolutions\n\nand international law.\n\n2 Raphaël Lemkin, Axis Rule in Occupied Europe: Laws of Occupation, Analysis of Government, Proposals for Redress\n\n(1944), Chapter IX.\n\n3 Geneva Convention Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, 12 August 1949, 75 UNTS 287.\n\n4 Speech by Mahmoud Abbas on Palestine TV, 18 November 2023, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uRGx02vULg;\n\ntranslated by WAFA: “President Abbas urges Biden to stop Israel’s ongoing genocide of Palestinians”, WAFA (18\n\nNovember 2023), https://english.wafa.ps/Pages/Details/139394.\n\n5 United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (‘UN OHCHR’), Gaza: UN experts decry bombing of\n\nhospitals and schools as crimes against humanity, call for prevention of genocide (19 October 2023) https://www.ohchr.org/\n\nen/press-releases/2023/10/gaza-un-experts-decry-bombing-hospitals-and-schools-crimes-against-humanity.\n\n6 UN OHCHR, Gaza: UN experts call on international community to prevent genocide against the Palestinian people (16\n\nNovember 2023), https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/11/gaza-un-experts-call-international-community-preventgenocide-\n\nagainst.\n\n7 UN OHCHR, Gaza Strip: States are obliged to prevent crimes against humanity and genocide, UN Committee stresses (21\n\nDecember 2023), https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/12/gaza-strip-states-are-obliged-prevent-crimes-againsthumanity-\n\nand-genocide. Under CERD's Early Warning and Urgent Action (‘EWUA’) procedure, CERD has extensive\n\nexpertise in compiling indicators relevant to the prevention of genocide; in 2015 it issued a Declaration on the Prevention of\n\nGenocide which recalled this work in its preamble: see CERD, Declaration on the Prevention of Genocide (CRD/C/66/1)\n\n(17 October 2005), https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/HRBodies/CERD/declaration_genocide.doc\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n3\n\n4. The facts relied on by South Africa in this application and to be further developed in these\n\nproceedings establish that — against a background of apartheid, expulsion, ethnic cleansing, annexation,\n\noccupation, discrimination, and the ongoing denial of the right of the Palestinian people to selfdetermination\n\n— Israel, since 7 October 2023 in particular, has failed to prevent genocide and has failed\n\nto prosecute the direct and public incitement to genocide. More gravely still, Israel has engaged in, is\n\nengaging in and risks further engaging in genocidal acts against the Palestinian people in Gaza. Those\n\nacts include killing them, causing them serious mental and bodily harm and deliberately inflicting on\n\nthem conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction as a group. Repeated\n\nstatements by Israeli State representatives, including at the highest levels, by the Israeli President, Prime\n\nMinister, and Minister of Defence express genocidal intent. That intent is also properly to be inferred\n\nfrom the nature and conduct of Israel’s military operation in Gaza, having regard inter alia to Israel’s\n\nfailure to provide or ensure essential food, water, medicine, fuel, shelter and other humanitarian\n\nassistance for the besieged and blockaded Palestinian people, which has pushed them to the brink of\n\nfamine. It is also clear from the nature, scope and extent of Israel’s military attacks on Gaza, which have\n\ninvolved the sustained bombardment over more than 11 weeks of one of the most densely populated\n\nplaces in the world, forcing the evacuation of 1.9 million people or 85% of the population of Gaza from\n\ntheir homes and herding them into ever smaller areas, without adequate shelter, in which they continue\n\nto be attacked, killed and harmed. Israel has now killed in excess of 21,110 named Palestinians,\n\nincluding over 7,729 children — with over 7,780 others missing, presumed dead under the rubble —\n\nand has injured over 55,243 other Palestinians, causing them severe bodily and mental harm. Israel has\n\nalso laid waste to vast areas of Gaza, including entire neighbourhoods, and has damaged or destroyed\n\nin excess of 355,000 Palestinian homes, alongside extensive tracts of agricultural land, bakeries, schools,\n\nuniversities, businesses, places of worship, cemeteries, cultural and archaeological sites, municipal and\n\ncourt buildings, and critical infrastructure, including water and sanitation facilities and electricity\n\nnetworks, while pursuing a relentless assault on the Palestinian medical and healthcare system. Israel\n\nhas reduced and is continuing to reduce Gaza to rubble, killing, harming and destroying its people, and\n\ncreating conditions of life calculated to bring about their physical destruction as a group.\n\n5. South Africa, mindful of the jus cogens character of the prohibition of genocide and the erga\n\nomnes and erga omnes partes character of the obligations owed by States under the Genocide\n\nConvention, is making the present application to establish Israel’s responsibility for violations of the\n\nGenocide Convention; to hold it fully accountable under international law for those violations; and —\n\nmost immediately — to have recourse to this Court to ensure the urgent and fullest possible protection\n\nfor Palestinians in Gaza who remain at grave and immediate risk of continuing and further acts of\n\ngenocide.\n\n6. In light of the extraordinary urgency of the situation, South Africa seeks an expedited hearing\n\nfor its request for the indication of provisional measures. In addition, pursuant to Article 74(4) of the\n\nRules of Court, South Africa requests the President of the Court to protect the Palestinian people in\n\nGaza by calling upon Israel immediately to halt all military attacks that constitute or give rise to\n\nviolations of the Genocide Convention pending the holding of such hearing, so as to enable any order\n\nthe Court may make on the request for the indication of provisional measures to have its appropriate\n\neffects. To that end, the Court should order Israel to cease killing and causing serious mental and bodily\n\nharm to Palestinian people in Gaza, to cease the deliberate infliction of conditions of life calculated to\n\nbring about their physical destruction as a group, to prevent and punish direct and public incitement to\n\ngenocide, and to rescind related policies and practices, including regarding the restriction on aid and\n\nthe issuing of evacuation directives.\n\n4\n\n7. Mindful of the Court’s important role and the exercise of its grave responsibility in\n\ncircumstances in which the genocidal acts of which South Africa complains have occurred very recently\n\nand are ongoing — and have not otherwise been subject to judicial determination or detailed fact-finding\n\n— South Africa’s application and request for provisional measures provide a more detailed factual\n\naccount than might otherwise be usual. That account draws in significant part on statements and reports\n\nby United Nations chiefs and bodies and non-governmental organisations (‘NGOs’), as well as eyewitness\n\naccounts from Gaza — including from Palestinian journalists on the ground — in circumstances\n\nwhere Israel continues to restrict access to Gaza by international journalists, investigators and factfinding\n\nteams. However, neither the Application nor the request for the indication of provisional\n\nmeasures depends on a determination by the Court of each individual incident or complaint referred to\n\nherein. Notably, as the Court’s caselaw makes clear, “[w]hat the Court is required to do at the stage of\n\nmaking an order on provisional measures is to establish whether… at least some of the acts alleged…\n\nare capable of falling within the provisions of the Convention”.8 At least some of the acts alleged by\n\nSouth Africa are clearly capable of falling within those provisions.\n\nII. JURISDICTION OF THE COURT\n\n8. South Africa and Israel are both Members of the United Nations and therefore bound by the\n\nStatute of the Court, including Article 36 (1), which provides that the Court’s jurisdiction “comprises .\n\n. . all matters specially provided for . . . in treaties and conventions in force”.\n\n9. South Africa and Israel are also parties to the Genocide Convention. Israel signed the Genocide\n\nConvention on 17 August 1949 and deposited its instrument of ratification on 9 March 1950, thereby\n\nbecoming a party when the Genocide Convention entered into force on 12 January 1951. South Africa\n\ndeposited its instrument of accession on 10 December 1998. It became applicable between the parties\n\non the ninetieth day thereafter, pursuant to Article XIII of the Convention.\n\n10. Article IX of the Genocide Convention provides:\n\n“Disputes between the Contracting Parties relating to the interpretation, application or\n\nfulfilment of the present Convention, including those relating to the responsibility of a State for\n\ngenocide or for any of the other acts enumerated in article III, shall be submitted to the\n\nInternational Court of Justice at the request of any of the parties to the dispute.”\n\n11. Neither South Africa nor Israel has entered any reservation to Article IX.\n\n12. South Africa has repeatedly and urgently expressed its concerns and condemnation in respect\n\nof Israel’s acts and omissions which form the basis of this Application. South Africa and other States\n\nParties to the Genocide Convention have, in particular, made clear that Israel’s actions in Gaza\n\nconstitute genocide against the Palestinian people. By way of example, the Presidents of Algeria,9\n\n8 Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (The Gambia v.

Having regard to the fact that the prohibition of genocide has the character of a peremptory\n\nnorm and that the obligations under the Convention are owed erga omnes and erga omnes partes,32\n\nIsrael has been made fully aware of the grave concerns expressed by the international community, by\n\nStates Parties to the Genocide Convention, and by South Africa in particular, as to Israel’s failure to\n\ncease, prevent and punish the commission of genocide. South Africa’s concern has been expressed,\n\ninter alia, as follows:\n\n— On 30 October 2023, the South African Department of International Relations and\n\nCooperation issued a statement calling on the international community to hold Israel\n\naccountable for breaches of international law. Warning that “the crime of genocide, sadly looms\n\nlarge” in Gaza, the statement recalled that “President Lula da Silva of Brazil has called the\n\nattacks on Gaza a genocide” and that the South African Minister of International Relations and\n\nCooperation, Naledi Pandor, addressing the United Nations Security Council on 24 October\n\n2023, had also “reminded the international community not to stand idle while another genocide\n\nis unfolding”.33\n\n— On 7 November, addressing the South African National Assembly, South Africa’s\n\nInternational Relations Minister warned that “[t]he crime of genocide sadly looms large in\n\nthe current situation in Gaza”, recalling that “in 1994, a genocide occurred on the African\n\ncontinent with much of the whole world watching as innocent people were massacred”, and\n\nunderscoring that South Africa could not stand by and allow that to happen again.34\n\n— On 10 November 2023, the Director-General of South Africa’s Department of\n\nInternational Relations and Cooperation (“DIRCO”), conducted a formal diplomatic\n\n28 United Nations, Meetings Coverage and Press Releases, 9451st Meeting, SC/15462, Amid Increasingly Dire Humanitarian\n\nSituation in Gaza, Secretary-General Tells Security Council Hamas Attacks Cannot Justify Collective Punishment of\n\nPalestinian People (24 October 2023), https://press.un.org/en/2023/sc15462.doc.htm.

of the Ambassador of the State of Israel to South Africa, advising him that while\n\nSouth Africa “condemned the attacks on civilians by Hamas” which “should be investigated\n\nfor war crimes”, “the response by Israel was unlawful”, and that South Africa “wants the ICC\n\nto investigate the leadership of Israel” for crimes including genocide.35\n\n— On 13 November 2023, at a meeting at the Presidential residence with the leadership of the\n\nSouth African Jewish Board of Deputies, at which they called inter alia for the re-opening of\n\nthe South African Embassy in Israel, the President of South Africa, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa\n\n“condemn[ed] the genocide that is being inflicted against the people of Palestine, including\n\nwomen and children, through collective punishment and ongoing bombardment of Gaza”.36\n\n— On 17 November 2023, during the course of a State visit to Qatar, the President of South\n\nAfrica, announced that South Africa was referring the Situation in the State of Palestine to the\n\nInternational Criminal Court, expressing his abhorrence for “what is happening right now in\n\nGaza, which has now turned into a concentration camp where genocide is taking place”.37\n\n— Later on 17 November 2023, the Embassy of South Africa in The Hague, acting on behalf\n\nof South Africa, jointly with three other States parties to the Genocide Convention — namely\n\nBangladesh, Bolivia, and Comoros — and Djibouti, referred the Situation in the State of\n\nPalestine to the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, requesting that the\n\nProsecutor vigorously investigate crimes within the jurisdictional scope of the Court, including\n\nthe crime of genocide, as provided for in Article 6 (a), (b) and (c) of the Rome Statute of the\n\nInternational Criminal Court (‘Rome Statute’).38\n\n— On 21 November 2023, addressing the Extraordinary Joint Meeting of BRICS (Brazil,\n\nRussia, India, China, and South Africa) Leaders and Leaders of invited BRICS members on the\n\nsituation in the Middle East called to address “a matter of grave global concern” in the Middle\n\nEast, the President of South Africa asserted that “[t]he deliberate denial of medicine, fuel,\n\nfood and water to the residents of Gaza is tantamount to genocide”.39\n\n— On 12 December 2023, speaking at the 10th Emergency Special Session of the United\n\nNations General Assembly — at which Israel was represented — the South African\n\nAmbassador to the United Nations stated that “[t]he events of the past six weeks in Gaza have\n\nillustrated that Israel is acting contrary to its obligations in terms of the Genocide Convention”.\n\nShe underscored that, “[a]s a UN Member State and owing to South Africa’s painful past\n\n35 South Africa,

impresses on us, as Member States to take action in\n\naccordance with international law.”40\n\n— On 21 December 2023, South Africa sent a Note Verbale to the Embassy of Israel in South\n\nAfrica, in which South Africa raised its concerns about “credible reports that acts meeting the\n\nthreshold of genocide or related crimes as defined in the 1948 Convention on the Prevention\n\nand Punishment of Genocide, have been and may still be committed in the context of the\n\nconflict” in Gaza. The Note Verbale recalled that “[a]s a State Party to the Convention on the\n\nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, South Africa is under a treaty obligation\n\nto prevent genocide from occurring, and therefore calls upon Israel which is also a State Party\n\nto the Convention to immediately cease hostilities in Gaza and to refrain from conduct\n\nconstituting or failing to prevent violations of its obligations under the Convention”. South\n\nAfrica, “[a]larmed by rhetoric from Israeli officials and others”, also called on Israel “to prevent\n\nand punish direct and public incitement to genocide”. This served to communicate directly to\n\nIsrael South Africa’s claims regarding the fulfilment of its own obligations under the Genocide\n\nConvention and breaches by Israel of its obligations under the Genocide Convention and the\n\ndetail thereof.41\n\n14. Israel has not responded directly to South Africa’s Note Verbale sent on 21 December 2023.\n\nHowever, Israel has publicly rejected any suggestion that it has violated international law in its military\n\ncampaign in Gaza. Notably, Israel has dismissed as “outrageous and false” the assertion that Israel’s\n\nmilitary attacks on Gaza meet “the legal definition of genocide” and are aimed at “not just simply the\n\nkilling of innocent people and the destruction of their livelihoods but a systematic effort to empty Gaza\n\nof its people”.42 Israel denies that its conduct in Gaza violates its obligations under the Genocide\n\nConvention, asserting that “[t]he accusation of genocide against Israel is not only wholly unfounded as\n\na matter of fact and law, it is morally repugnant” and “antisemitic”.43 Moreover, Israel has engaged and\n\ncontinues to engage in acts and omissions against the Palestinian people in Gaza as have been asserted\n\nto be genocidal and, by its attitude and conduct, has refuted any suggestion that its actions in Gaza are\n\nconstrained by its obligations under the Genocide Convention. Indeed, the Israeli Prime Minister\n\nasserted on 26 December 2023: “We are not stopping. We are continuing to fight, and we are deepening\n\nthe fighting in the coming days, and this will be a long battle and it is not close to being over.\"44 Israel’s\n\nown conduct therefore serves to underline the parties’ disagreement. South Africa has not resiled from\n\nits own position that it is responsible as a State party to the Genocide Convention to act to prevent\n\ngenocide or a risk thereof in Gaza.\n\n15. According to the established case law of the Court, a dispute is “a disagreement on a point of\n\nlaw or fact, a conflict of legal views or interests” between parties.45 Such a disagreement or “positive\n\n40 UN News, UN General Assembly votes by large majority for immediate humanitarian ceasefire during emergency session\n\n(video of the session at 1:13:37) (12 December 2023) https://news.un.org/en/story/2023/12/1144717.\n\n41 South Africa, DIRCO, Note Verbale (21 December 2023).\n\n42 “Jordan says Israel aims to expel Palestinians from Gaza”, Reuters (10 December 2023),\n\nhttps://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/jordan-says-israel-aims-expel-palestinians-gaza-2023-12-10/.\n\n43 Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, The War Against Hamas: Answering Your Most Pressing Questions (15 December\n\n2023), https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/hamas-israel-war-23/all-articles/the-war-against-hamas-answering-your-mostpressing-\n\nquestions/.\n\n44 Statement by Israeli Prime Minister to Likud Party, 25 December 2023: Jeremy Sharon, \"After rare visit to Gaza,\n\nNetanyahu says war ‘not close to being over’\", The Times of Israel (25 December 2023),\n\nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/after-gaza-visit-netanyahu-says-war-not-close-to-being-over/.\n\n45 The Gambia v.

There is plainly a dispute between Israel and South Africa relating to the interpretation and\n\napplication of the Genocide Convention, going both to South Africa’s compliance with its own\n\nobligation to prevent genocide, and to Israel’s compliance with its obligations not to commit genocide\n\nand to prevent and punish genocide — including the direct and public incitement to genocide — and to\n\nmake reparations to its victims and offer assurances and guarantees of non-repetition. Given that South\n\nAfrica’s claim concerns its own obligations as a State party to the Genocide Convention to act to prevent\n\ngenocide — to which Israel’s acts and omissions give rise — South Africa plainly has standing in\n\nrelation thereto. Moreover, given that “any State party to the Genocide Convention, and not only a\n\nspecially affected State, may invoke the responsibility of another State party with a view to ascertaining\n\nthe alleged failure to comply with its obligations erga omnes partes, and to bring that failure to an end”,\n\nSouth Africa also “has prima facie standing” to submit to the Court its dispute with Israel “on the basis\n\nof alleged violations of obligations under the Genocide Convention”.47\n\n17. Therefore, pursuant to Article 36 (1) of the Court’s Statute and Article IX of the Genocide\n\nConvention, the Court has jurisdiction to hear the claims submitted in the present Application by South\n\nAfrica against Israel.\n\nIII. THE FACTS\n\nA. Introduction\n\n18. Since 7 October 2023, Israel has engaged in a large-scale military assault by land, air and sea,\n\non the Gaza Strip (‘Gaza’), a narrow strip of land approximately of 365 square kilometres – one of the\n\nmost densely populated places in the world.48 Gaza — home to approximately 2.3 million people,\n\nalmost half of them children — has been subjected by Israel to what has been described as one of the\n\n“heaviest conventional bombing campaigns” in the history of modern warfare.49 By 29 October 2023\n\nalone, it was estimated that 6,000 bombs per week had been dropped on the tiny enclave.50 In just over\n\ntwo months, Israel’s military attacks had “wreaked more destruction than the razing of Syria’s Aleppo\n\nbetween 2012 and 2016, Ukraine’s Mariupol, or proportionally, the Allied bombing of Germany in\n\nWorld War II.”51 The destruction wrought by Israel is so extreme that “Gaza is now a different colour\n\n46 Ibid.\n\n47 The Gambia v.

It’s a different texture”.52 As stated by the United Nations Secretary-General, in a letter\n\ndated 6 December 2023 to the President of the United Nations Security Council,53 of which the United\n\nNations General Assembly took express “note” in Resolution ESIO/22 of 12 December 2023 on the\n\nProtection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations:54\n\n“Civilians throughout Gaza face grave danger. Since the start of Israel's military operation, more\n\nthan 15,000 people have reportedly been killed, over 40 per cent of whom were children.\n\nThousands of others have been injured. More than half of all homes have been destroyed. Some\n\n80 per cent of the population of 2.2 million has been forcibly displaced, into increasingly\n\nsmaller areas. More than 1.1 million people have sought refuge in UNRWA facilities across\n\nGaza, creating overcrowded, undignified, and unhygienic conditions. Others have nowhere to\n\nshelter and find themselves on the street. Explosive remnants of war are rendering areas\n\nuninhabitable. There is no effective protection of civilians.\n\nThe health care system in Gaza is collapsing. Hospitals have turned into battlegrounds. Only\n\n14 hospitals out of 36 facilities are even partially functional. The two major hospitals in south\n\nGaza are operating at three times their bed capacity and are running out of basic supplies and\n\nfuel. They are also sheltering thousands of displaced persons. Under these circumstances, more\n\npeople will die untreated in the coming days and weeks.\n\nNowhere is safe in Gaza.\n\nAmid constant bombardment by the Israel Defense Forces, and without shelter or the essentials\n\nto survive, I expect public order to completely break down soon due to the desperate conditions,\n\nrendering even limited humanitarian assistance impossible. An even worse situation could\n\nunfold, including epidemic diseases and increased pressure for mass displacement into\n\nneighbouring countries.\n\nWhile delivery of supplies through Rafah continues, quantities are insufficient and have\n\ndropped since the pause came to an end. We are simply unable to reach those in need inside\n\nGaza . . . We are facing a severe risk of collapse of the humanitarian system. The situation is\n\nfast deteriorating into a catastrophe with potentially irreversible implications for Palestinians as\n\na whole and for peace and security in the region. Such an outcome must be avoided at all cost.”55\n\n19. Since that letter was written, the numbers have risen even more starkly: at least 21,110\n\nPalestinians in Gaza have been killed and over 55,243 other Palestinians have been wounded, many\n\nseverely. 56 The death toll includes over 7,729 children,57 not including the 4,700 women and children\n\nstill missing, and presumed dead under the rubble.58 Entire multi-generational families have been wiped\n\nout completely. Over 355,000 homes equivalent to more than 60 per cent of Gaza’s housing stock in\n\n52 Ibid.\n\n53 The Secretary-General, Letter by the Secretary-General to the President of Security Council invoking Article 99 of the\n\nUnited Nations Charter (6 December 2023), https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/sg_letter_of_6_december_gaza.pdf.\n\n54 General Assembly resolution ES-10/22, Protection of civilians and upholding legal and humanitarian obligations,\n\nA/RES/ES-10/22 (12 December 2023), https://www.un.org/unispal/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/N2339709.pdf.\n\n55 The Secretary-General, Letter by the Secretary-General to the President of Security Council invoking Article 99 of the\n\nUnited Nations Charter (6 December 2023), https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/sg_letter_of_6_december_gaza.pdf.\n\n56 UN OCHA, Hostilities in the Gaza Strip and Israel | Flash Update #78 (27 December 2023),\n\nhttps://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israel-flash-update-78 ; UN OCHA, Hostilities in the Gaza Strip\n\nand Israel - reported impact| Day 82 (27 December 2023), https://www.ochaopt.org/content/hostilities-gaza-strip-and-israelreported-\n\nimpact-day-82 .

In the unprecedented letter, the Commissioner-General “predict[s] . . . the\n\ncollapse of the mandate [he] is expected to fulfil” and calls for “an end to the decimation of Gaza and\n\nof its people”.70\n\nB. Background\n\n1. The Gaza Strip (‘Gaza’)\n\n21. Gaza is a narrow strip of land, bordered to the west by the Mediterranean Sea, to the south by\n\nEgypt and to the north and east by Israel. Together with the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, it is\n\none of the two constituent territories of the occupied Palestinian territory (‘oPt’) — occupied by Israel\n\nin 1967 — and of the State of Palestine, recognised by South Africa on 15 February 1995, and accorded\n\nnon-member observer State status in the United Nations on 29 November 2012.71\n\n22. The population of Gaza consists of approximately 2.3 million people, over half of whom are\n\nchildren. 80 per cent of Palestinians in Gaza are refugees — and their descendants — from towns and\n\nvillages in what is now the State of Israel,72 expelled or forced to flee during the mass displacement of\n\nover 750,000 Palestinians or ‘Nakba’ during the establishment of the State of Israel.73 The Nakba and\n\nthe mass displacement associated with it therefore features prominently in the history and consciousness\n\nof Palestinians in Gaza, as it does for the wider Palestinian people. Palestinians in Gaza form a\n\nsubstantial part of the Palestinian national, racial and ethnical group: they are a prominent part of the\n\ngroup, making up the population of one of the two constituent territories of the State of Palestine. They\n\nare also a quantitively substantial part of the Palestinian population of the State of Palestine under\n\noccupation, which counts approximately 5.48 million people.74\n\n70 UNRWA, Letter from UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini to the UN General Assembly President Mr.\n\nDennis Francis dated 7 December 2023 (7 December 2023), https://www.unrwa.org/resources/un-unrwa/letter-unrwacommissioner-\n\ngeneral-philippe-lazzarini-un-general-assembly (emphasis added).\n\n71 General Assembly resolution 67/19, Status of Palestine in the United Nations, A/RES/67/19 (28 November 2012),\n\nhttps://digitallibrary.un.org/record/739031/files/A_RES_67_19-EN.pdf. 82 States had recognised the State of Palestine in\n\n1988, following the transmission of a declaration on the establishment of the State of Palestine by the Palestine Liberation\n\nOrganization (‘PLO’) to the UN Secretary-General on behalf of the Arab League (Declaration of State of Palestine –\n\nPalestine National Council, Letter dated 18 November 1988 from the Permanent Representative of Jordan to the United\n\nNations addressed to the Secretary-Genera (l8 November 1988), https://www.un.org/unispal/document/auto-insert-178680/).\n\nThe State of Palestine is now recognised by 138 States (Permanent Observer Mission of the State of Palestine to the United\n\nNations New York, Diplomatic Relations, http://palestineun.org/about-palestine/diplomatic-relations/).\n\n72 UNRWA, About UNRWA (2012), https://www.unrwa.org/userfiles/2012050753530.pdf, p. 17.\n\n73 UN OCHA, Right of return of Palestinian refugees must be prioritised over political considerations: UN experts (21 June\n\n2023), https://www.ohchr.org/en/statements/2023/06/right-return-palestinian-refugees-must-be-prioritised-over-political.\n\n74 State of Palestine – Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (‘PCBS’), The International Population Day, 11/07/2023 (10\n\nJuly 2023), https://www.pcbs.gov.ps/post.aspx?lang=en&ItemID=4544#:~:text=About%2014.5%20Million%20Palestinians\n\n%20in,the%20State%20of%20Palestine%3B%202.\n\n13\n\nMap of the Gaza Strip75\n\n23. Gaza comprises five Governorates. The Gaza North and Gaza Governorates constituting ‘the\n\nNorth’ stretch from the north of Wadi Gaza towards Erez Crossing, a pedestrian crossing into Israel\n\n(also known as the ‘Beit Hanoun Crossing’). ‘The North’ is ordinarily home to approximately 1.1\n\nmillion Palestinians,76 many concentrated in Gaza City (approximately 713,488 inhabitants),77 as well\n\nas in Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun, and in the Beach and Jabalia refugee camps. It is where Gaza’s largest\n\nhospital, Al Shifa Medical Hospital, is situated, as well as the Kamal Adwan Hospital. The Deir al Balah\n\nGovernorate (‘the Middle Area’) ordinarily counts 302,507 inhabitants,78 primarily in Deir al Balah\n\nCity, as well as in the Al Maghazi, An Nuseirat, Al Bureij and Deir al Balah refugee camps; it is where\n\nGaza’s only power plant is located. The Khan Yunis and Rafah Governorates (‘the South’) are below\n\nDeir al Balah Governorate and extend to the Rafah crossing with Egypt. The major population centres\n\nin the South are Khan Yunis and Rafah, as well as the Khan Yunis and Rafah refugee camps. The Karem\n\nShalom Crossing (also known as ‘Karem Abu Salem Crossing’) is located four km west of Rafah.

Until 2005, Gaza — like the West Bank today — was occupied by Israeli military forces on the\n\nground. However, in 2005, Israel unilaterally ‘disengaged’ from Gaza, dismantling its military bases\n\nand relocating Israeli settlers from settlements in Gaza back to Israel and into the occupied West Bank.85\n\nNotwithstanding its ‘disengagement’, Israel continues to exercise control over the airspace, territorial\n\nwaters, land crossings, water, electricity, electromagnetic sphere and civilian infrastructure in Gaza,86\n\nas well as over key governmental functions, such as the management of the Palestinian population\n\nregistry for Gaza.87 Given that continuing effective control by Israel over the territory, Gaza is still\n\nconsidered by the international community to be under belligerent occupation by Israel.88 The near total\n\ncontrol exercised by Israel over access to Gaza, and over its water, fuel, electricity and food supplies,\n\nhas been demonstrated starkly since 7 October 2023.\n\n25. Entry and exit by air and sea to Gaza has been prohibited since the early 1990s, with Israel\n\noperating only two crossing points – Erez (pedestrian) and Kerem Shalom (goods) – through which\n\nPalestinians in Gaza could access the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, for business, trade,\n\n80 State of Palestine – Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics, Estimated Population in Palestine Mid-Year by Governorate,\n\n1997-2021, https://tinyurl.com/34rb8w38.\n\n81 UNRWA, UNRWA Situation Report #53 on the Situation in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem\n\n(17 December 2023), https://www.unrwa.org/resources/reports/unrwa-situation-report-53-situation-gaza-strip-and-westbank-\n\nincluding-east-Jerusalem.\n\n82 UN Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), Al-Mawasi area, https://archive.unescwa.org/almawasi-\n\narea.\n\n83 Israel Defense Forces, “Based on the morals and values of our military establishment, the Israel Defence Army publishes a\n\nlist of the number of blocks to direct the inhabitants of Gaza in the evacuation of targeted areas” (1 December 2023),\n\nhttps://tinyurl.com/mtapebm7; “Palestinians displaced to south Gaza’s overcrowded areas living on streets”, AlJazeera (10\n\nDecember 2023), https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/12/9/palestinians-displaced-to-south-gazas-overcrowded-areasliving-\n\non-streets.\n\n84 UNRWA, UNRWA Situation Report #56 on the Situation in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem\n\n(22 December 2023), https://www.unrwa.org/resources/reports/unrwa-situation-report-56-situation-gaza-strip-and-westbank-\n\nincluding-east-Jerusalem.\n\n85 Human Rights Council, Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian\n\nTerritory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel, A/HRC/50/21 (9 May 2022), para. 16.\n\n86 GOV.UK, Guidance Overseas business risk: The Occupied Palestinian Territories (22 February 2022),\n\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/overseas-business-risk-palestinian-territories/overseas-business-risk-theoccupied-\n\npalestinian-territories, para. 2.5.\n\n87 Human Rights Council, Report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian\n\nTerritory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel, A/HRC/50/21 (9 May 2022), para. 16.\n\n88 See e.g., Security Council resolution 1860, S/RES/1860 (2009) (8 January 2009), where the Security Council stressed\n\n“that the Gaza Strip constitutes an integral part of the territory occupied in 1967 and will be a part of the Palestinian state,”\n\nhttps://digitallibrary.un.org/record/645525?ln=en#record-files-collapse-header.

Israel’s parallel implementation of a wide buffer zone inside Gaza’s eastern border fence\n\n(estimated to restrict access to approximately 24 per cent of Gaza) severely impacts internal food\n\nsupply, by reducing the main agricultural area for farming.97 Israel also made fishing extremely\n\nhazardous for Palestinians, who have not had full access to the fishing zone of 20 nautical miles\n\nstipulated in the Oslo Accords — interim agreements concluded between the PLO and Israel in the early\n\n1990s. The naval blockade — policed by Israeli forces through the use of force, arrests and the\n\nconfiscation of fishing equipment — severely reduced the fishing catchment area for Gaza’s fishermen\n\n89 Egypt operates a third crossing – the Rafah Crossing – between Gaza and Egypt.

Ban Ki-moon has called this political quarantining of the population\n\na “collective punishment”, which is a serious breach of international law. The World Bank\n\nreported in 2021 that Gaza had undergone a multi-decade process of dedevelopment and\n\ndeindustrialization, resulting in a 45 per cent unemployment rate and a 60 per cent poverty rate,\n\nwith 80 per cent of the population dependent on some form of international assistance, in\n\nsignificant part because of the hermetic sealing of the access of Gaza to the outside world. The\n\ncoastal aquifer, the sole source of natural drinking water in Gaza, has become polluted and unfit\n\nfor human consumption because of contamination by seawater and sewage, substantially\n\ndriving up water costs for an already destitute population. Gaza is heavily dependent on external\n\nsources — Israel and Egypt — for power, and Palestinians live with rolling power blackouts of\n\nbetween 12 and 20 hours daily, severely impairing daily living and the economy. The entry and\n\nexport of goods is strictly controlled by Israel, which has throttled the local economy. The\n\nhealth-care system in Gaza is flat on its back, with serious shortages of health-care\n\nprofessionals, inadequate treatment equipment and low supplies of drugs and medicines.\n\nPalestinians in Gaza can rarely travel outside of Gaza, which is a denial of their fundamental\n\nright to freedom of movement. More acutely, they have endured four highly asymmetrical wars\n\nwith Israel over the past 13 years, with enormous loss of civilian life and immense property\n\ndestruction. The suffering was acknowledged by Antonio Guterres in May 2021, when he\n\nstated: “If there is a hell on earth, it is the lives of children in Gaza”.”101\n\n27. Between 29 September 2000 and 7 October 2023, approximately 7,569 Palestinians,102\n\nincluding 1,699 children,103 were killed, including in those “four highly asymmetrical wars”, as well as\n\nother smaller military assaults, with tens of thousands of others injured.

Among those shot were children, paramedics, journalists, and persons with\n\ndisabilities.”107\n\n28. Those killed by Israeli soldiers, firing from behind the separation fence, included three medics\n\nand two journalists. A total of over 36,100 Palestinians, including nearly 8,800 children,108 were injured\n\nby Israel, including 4,903 people who were shot in the lower limbs, “many while standing hundreds of\n\nmetres away from the snipers, unarmed”.109 156 of them had to have at least one limb amputated,110 and\n\nover 1,200 required specialised limb reconstruction treatment.111 The Commission found that the\n\nmaiming was not accidental: the rules of engagement adopted by Israel permitted snipers to shoot at the\n\nlegs of the “major inciters”.112 One Israeli soldier admitted that he shot “42 knees in one day”.113\n\n29. The Commission found that there were reasonable grounds to believe that Israeli snipers\n\n“intentionally shot” children, knowing them to be children,114 and they also “intentionally shot” health\n\nworkers and journalists “despite seeing that they were clearly marked as such”.115 It further found\n\n“reasonable grounds to believe” that Israeli snipers shot disabled demonstrators “intentionally, despite\n\nseeing that they had visible disabilities” and despite them not presenting an imminent threat.116\n\n104 UN, The Question of Palestine, Two Years On: People Injured and Traumatized During the “Great March of Return” are\n\nStill Struggling (6 April 2020), https://www.un.org/unispal/document/two-years-on-people-injured-and-traumatized-duringthe-\n\ngreat-march-of-return-are-still-struggling/.\n\n105 Human Rights Council, Report of the detailed findings of the independent international Commission of inquiry on the\n\nprotests in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, A/HRC/40/CRP.2 (18 March 2019), https://undocs.org/A/HRC/40/CRP.2,\n\npara. 115.\n\n106 Human Rights Council, Report of the independent international commission of inquiry on the protests in the Occupied\n\nPalestinian Territory, A/HRC/40/74 (6 March 2019), https://undocs.org/A/HRC/40/74, para. 58.\n\n107 Human Rights Council, Report of the detailed findings of the independent international Commission of inquiry on the\n\nprotests in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, A/HRC/40/CRP.2 (18 March 2019), https://undocs.org/A/HRC/40/CRP.2,\n\nsummary.\n\n108 UN, The Question of Palestine, Two Years On: People Injured and Traumatized During the “Great March of Return”\n\nare Still Struggling (6 April 2020), https://www.un.org/unispal/document/two-years-on-people-injured-and-traumatizedduring-\n\nthe-great-march-of-return-are-still-struggling/.\n\n109 Human Rights Council, Report of the detailed findings of the independent international Commission of inquiry on the\n\nprotests in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, A/HRC/40/CRP.2 (18 March 2019), https://undocs.org/A/HRC/40/CRP.2,\n\nsummary.\n\n110 UN The Question of Palestine, Two Years On: People Injured and Traumatized During the “Great March of Return” are\n\nStill Struggling (6 April 2020), https://www.un.org/unispal/document/two-years-on-people-injured-and-traumatized-duringthe-\n\ngreat-march-of-return-are-still-struggling/.\n\n111 Ibid.\n\n112 “‘42 Knees in One Day’: Israeli Snipers Open up about Shooting Gaza Protesters”, Haaretz (6 March 2020),\n\nhttps://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2020-03-06/ty-article-magazine/.highlight/42-knees-in-one-day-israeli-snipers-openup-\n\nabout-shooting-gaza-protesters/0000017f-f2da-d497-a1ff-f2dab2520000.\n\n113 Ibid.\n\n114 Human Rights Council, Report of the detailed findings of the independent international Commission of inquiry on the\n\nprotests in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, A/HRC/40/CRP.2 (18 March 2019), https://undocs.org/A/HRC/40/CRP.2,\n\npara. 519.\n\n115 Ibid, paras. 526, 536.\n\n116 Ibid, para. 537.\n\n18\n\n30. Other reports by United Nations bodies and mandates have repeatedly found Israel to have acted\n\nin serious violation of international law in its previous military attacks on Gaza. By way of example:\n\n— Report of the human rights inquiry commission established pursuant to Commission\n\nresolution S-5/1 of 19 October 2000 (16 March 2001):117\n\n“50. . . . [T]he IDF apparently on grounds of military necessity, has destroyed homes and\n\nlaid to waste a significant amount of agricultural land, especially in Gaza, which is\n\nalready land starved. Statistics show that 94 homes have been demolished and 7,024\n\ndunums of agricultural land bulldozed in Gaza. Damage to private houses is put at US$\n\n9.5 million and damage to agricultural land at about US$ 27 million. . . . Houses situated\n\non this land had been destroyed and families compelled to live in tents. Water wells in\n\nthe vicinity had also been completely destroyed. The Commission found it difficult to\n\nbelieve that such destruction, generally carried out in the middle of the night and without\n\nadvance warning, was justified on grounds of military necessity. To the Commission it\n\nseemed that such destruction of property had been carried out in an intimidatory manner\n\nunrelated to security, disrespectful of civilian well-being and going well beyond the\n\nneeds of military necessity. The evidence suggests that destruction of property and\n\ndemolition of houses have been replicated elsewhere in the West Bank and Gaza.\n\nPalestinians, like other people, are deeply attached to their homes and agricultural land.\n\nThe demolition of homes and the destruction of olive and citrus trees, nurtured by farmers\n\nover many years, has caused untold human suffering to persons unconnected with the\n\npresent violence . . .\n\n51. The Commission concludes that the IDF has engaged in the excessive use of force at\n\nthe expense of life and property in Palestine.”\n\n— Report of the high-level fact-finding mission to Beit Hanoun established under Council\n\nresolution S-3/1 (1 September 2008, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and Professor Christine\n\nChinkin): 118\n\n“72. The mission expresses its sympathy to all victims of the shelling on 8 November\n\n2006 of Beit Hanoun. The attack took lives, inflicted horrendous physical and mental\n\ninjuries, tore families apart, destroyed homes, took away livelihoods and traumatized a\n\npopulation. Its aftermath compounded those ills . . .\n\n75. . . . In the absence of a well-founded explanation from the Israeli military (who is in\n\nsole possession of the relevant facts), the mission must conclude that there is a possibility\n\nthat the shelling of Beit Hanoun constituted a war crime as defined in the Rome Statute\n\nof the International Criminal Court. . . .\n\n76. One victim of the Beit Hanoun shelling was the rule of law. There has been no\n\naccountability for an act that killed 19 people and injured many more. . . .\n\n117 UN Economic and Social Council Commission on Human Rights, Report of the human rights inquiry commission\n\nestablished pursuant to Commission resolution S-5/1 of 19 October 2000, E/CN.4/2001/121 (16 March 2001),\n\nhttps://undocs.org/E/CN.4/2001/121, paras. 50 and 51 (emphasis added).\n\n118 Human Rights Council, Report of the high-level fact-finding mission to Beit Hanoun established under Council resolution\n\nS-3/1, A/HRC/9/26 (1 September 2008), https://undocs.org/A/HRC/9/26, paras. 72, 75 and 76.\n\n19\n\n— Report of the United Nations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict established\n\npursuant to Human Rights Council resolution S-9/1 of 12 January 2009 (25 September\n\n2009):119\n\n“36. . . . The Mission did not find any evidence to support the allegations that hospital\n\nfacilities were used by the Gaza authorities or by Palestinian armed groups to shield\n\nmilitary activities or that ambulances were used to transport combatants or for other\n\nmilitary purposes. On the basis of its own investigations and the statements by United\n\nNations officials, the Mission excludes that Palestinian armed groups engaged in combat\n\nactivities from United Nations facilities that were used as shelters during the military\n\noperations. . . .\n\n55. The Mission investigated four incidents in which the Israeli armed forces coerced\n\nPalestinian civilian men at gunpoint to take part in house searches during the military\n\noperations. . . . The Mission concludes that this practice amounts to the use of Palestinian\n\ncivilians as human shields and is therefore prohibited by international humanitarian law.\n\n. . . The Palestinian men used as human shields were questioned under threat of death or\n\ninjury to extract information about Hamas, Palestinian combatants and tunnels. This\n\nconstitutes a further violation of international humanitarian law. . . .\n\n60. In addition to arbitrary deprivation of liberty and violation of due process rights, the\n\ncases of the detained Palestinian civilians highlight a common thread of the interaction\n\nbetween Israeli soldiers and Palestinian civilians which also emerged clearly in many\n\ncases discussed elsewhere in the report: continuous and systematic abuse, outrages on\n\npersonal dignity, humiliating and degrading treatment contrary to fundamental\n\nprinciples of international humanitarian law and human rights law. The Mission\n\nconcludes that this treatment constitutes the infliction of a collective penalty on these\n\ncivilians and amounts to measures of intimidation and terror. . . .\n\n382. In assessing the Israeli strikes against the Legislative Council building and the main\n\nprison, the Mission first of all notes that Hamas is an organization with distinct political,\n\nmilitary and social welfare components. . . .\n\n391. The Mission rejects the analysis of present and former senior Israeli officials that,\n\nbecause of the alleged nature of the Hamas government in Gaza, the distinction between\n\ncivilian and military parts of the government infrastructure is no longer relevant in\n\nrelation to Israel’s conflict with Hamas. . . .\n\n392. The Mission is of the view that this is a dangerous argument that should be\n\nvigorously rejected as incompatible with the cardinal principle of distinction.\n\nInternational humanitarian law prohibits attacks against targets that do not make an\n\neffective contribution to military action. Attacks that are not directed against military (or\n\ndual use) objectives are violations of the laws of war, no matter how promising the\n\nattacker considers them from a strategic or political point of view. . . .\n\n522. The warning to go to city centres came at the start of the ground invasion. In the\n\nMission’s view it was unreasonable to assume, in the circumstances, that civilians would\n\nindeed leave their homes. As a consequence, the conclusion that allegedly formed part\n\nof the logic of soldiers on the ground that those who had stayed put had to be combatants\n\nwas wholly unwarranted. . . .\n\n119 Human Rights Council, Human Rights in Palestine and Other Occupied Arab Territories, Report of the United Nations\n\nFact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, A/HRC/12/48 (25 September 2009), https://undocs.org/A/HRC/12/48, paras. 36,\n\n55, 60, 382, 391-392, 522, 629, 1026-1027, 1214-1215, 1883, 1888-1093, 1905, 1927 and 1929 (emphasis added).\n\n20\n\n629. Taking into account the weapons used, and in particular the use of white\n\nphosphorous in and around a hospital that the Israeli armed forces knew was not only\n\ndealing with scores of injured and wounded but also giving shelter to several hundred\n\ncivilians, the Mission finds, based on all the information available to it, that in directly\n\nstriking the hospital and the ambulance depot the Israeli armed forces in these\n\ncircumstances violated article 18 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and violated\n\ncustomary international law in relation to proportionality. . . .\n\n1027. The Mission . . . found that the systematic destruction of food, production, water\n\nservices and construction industries was related to the overall policy of disproportionate\n\ndestruction of a significant part of Gaza’s infrastructure.\n\n1214. Through its overly broad framing of the “supporting infrastructure”, the Israeli\n\narmed forces have sought to construct a scope for their activities that, in the Mission’s\n\nview, was designed to have inevitably dire consequences for the non-combatants in\n\nGaza . . . .\n\n1215. Statements by political and military leaders prior to and during the military\n\noperations in Gaza leave little doubt that disproportionate destruction and violence\n\nagainst civilians were part of a deliberate policy. . . .\n\n1883. The Gaza military operations were, according to the Israeli Government,\n\nthoroughly and extensively planned. While the Israeli Government has sought to portray\n\nits operations as essentially a response to rocket attacks in the exercise of its right to selfdefence,\n\nthe Mission considers the plan to have been directed, at least in part, at a\n\ndifferent target: the people of Gaza as a whole. . . .\n\n1888. The Mission recognizes fully that the Israeli armed forces, like any army\n\nattempting to act within the parameters of international law, must avoid taking undue\n\nrisks with their soldiers’ lives, but neither can they transfer that risk onto the lives of\n\ncivilian men, women and children. The fundamental principles of distinction and\n\nproportionality apply on the battlefield, whether that battlefield is a built-up urban area\n\nor an open field.\n\n1889. The repeated failure to distinguish between combatants and civilians appears to\n\nthe Mission to have been the result of deliberate guidance issued to soldiers, as described\n\nby some of them, and not the result of occasional lapses. . . .\n\n1891. It is clear from evidence gathered by the Mission that the destruction of food supply\n\ninstallations, water sanitation systems, concrete factories and residential houses was the\n\nresult of a deliberate and systematic policy by the Israeli armed forces. It was not carried\n\nout because those objects presented a military threat or opportunity, but to make the daily\n\nprocess of living, and dignified living, more difficult for the civilian population. . . .\n\n1892. Allied to the systematic destruction of the economic capacity of the Gaza Strip,\n\nthere appears also to have been an assault on the dignity of the people. This was seen not\n\nonly in the use of human shields and unlawful detentions sometimes in unacceptable\n\nconditions, but also in the vandalizing of houses when occupied and the way in which\n\npeople were treated when their houses were entered. The graffiti on the walls, the\n\nobscenities and often racist slogans, all constituted an overall image of humiliation and\n\ndehumanization of the Palestinian population. . . .\n\n1893. The operations were carefully planned in all their phases. Legal opinions and advice\n\nwere given throughout the planning stages and at certain operational levels during the\n\ncampaign. There were almost no mistakes made according to the Government of Israel.\n\n21\n\nIts in these circumstances that the Mission concludes that what occurred in just over three\n\nweeks at the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2009 was a deliberately disproportionate\n\nattack designed to punish, humiliate and terrorize a civilian population, radically\n\ndiminish its local economic capacity both to work and to provide for itself, and to force\n\nupon it an ever increasing sense of dependency and vulnerability. . . .\n\n1927. The Mission found that the Israeli armed forces in Gaza rounded up and detained\n\nlarge groups of persons protected under the Fourth Geneva Convention. The Mission\n\nfinds that their detention cannot be justified either as detention of “unlawful combatants”\n\nor as internment of civilians for imperative reasons of security. . . .\n\n1929. The Mission also finds that the Israeli armed forces unlawfully and wantonly\n\nattacked and destroyed without military necessity a number of food production or food\n\nprocessing objects and facilities (including mills, land and greenhouses), drinking-water\n\ninstallations, farms and animals in violation of the principle of distinction. From the facts\n\nascertained by it, the Mission finds that this destruction was carried out with the purpose\n\nof denying sustenance to the civilian population, in violation of customary law reflected\n\nin article 54 (2) of the First Additional Protocol. The Mission further concludes that the\n\nIsraeli armed forces carried out widespread destruction of private residential houses,\n\nwater wells and water tanks unlawfully and wantonly.”\n\n— Report of the independent commission of inquiry established pursuant to Human\n\nRights Council resolution S-21/1 (24 June 2015):120\n\n“44. . . . the large number of targeted attacks against residential buildings and the fact\n\nthat such attacks continued throughout the operation, even after the dire impact of these\n\nattacks on civilians and civilian objects became apparent, raise concern that the strikes\n\nmay have constituted military tactics reflective of a broader policy, approved at least\n\ntacitly by decision-makers at the highest levels of the Government of Israel . . .\n\n51. . . . the fact that the Israel Defense Forces did not modify the manner in which they\n\nconducted their operations after initial episodes of shelling resulted in a large number of\n\ncivilian deaths indicates that their policies governing the use of artillery in densely\n\npopulated areas may not be in conformity with international humanitarian law.\n\n53. . . . destruction by artillery fire, air strikes and bulldozers may have been adopted as\n\na tactic of war. Some destruction may arguably be the result of the legitimate attempts of\n\nthe Israel Defense Forces to dismantle tunnels and to protect its soldiers. The\n\nconcentration of destruction in localities close to the Green Line, in some areas amounting\n\nto 100 per cent, and the systematic way in which these areas were flattened one after the\n\nother, however, raise concerns that such extensive destruction was not required by\n\nimperative military necessity. If confirmed, this would constitute a grave breach of\n\narticle 147 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, which is a war crime. . . .\n\n55. . . . warnings to evacuate were meant to create “sterile combat zones”, and the people\n\nremaining in the area would no longer be considered civilians and thus benefit from the\n\nprotection afforded by their civilian status. For example, the Head of the Doctrine Desk\n\nat the Infantry Corps Headquarters, . . . , reportedly stated: “… In peacetime security,\n\nsoldiers stand facing a civilian population, but in wartime, there is no civilian population,\n\njust an enemy.” . . .\n\n120 Human Rights Council, Report of the independent commission of inquiry established pursuant to Human Rights Council\n\nresolution S-21/1, A/HRC/29/52 (24 June 2015), https://undocs.org/A/HRC/29/52, paras. 26, 37, 44-45, 50-53 and 55-58\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n22\n\n56. . . . inferring that anyone remaining in an area that has been the object of a warning\n\nis an enemy or a person engaging in “terrorist activity”, or issuing instructions to this\n\neffect, contributes to creating an environment conducive to attacks against civilians.\n\nThose civilians choosing not to heed a warning do not lose the protection granted by their\n\nstatus. The only way in which civilians lose their protection from attack is by directly\n\nparticipating in the hostilities. Merely issuing a warning does not absolve the Israel\n\nDefense Forces of their legal obligations to protect civilian life . . .\n\n57. An examination of actions by the Israel Defense Forces in Shuja’iya in July and Rafah\n\non 1 August indicates that the protection of Israeli soldiers significantly influenced the\n\nconduct of the Israel Defense Forces in these operations, at times overriding any concern\n\nfor minimizing civilian casualties. While force protection is a legitimate objective, the\n\ncommission has the distinct impression that, when soldiers’ lives were at stake or there\n\nwas a risk of capture. . . .\n\n58. . . . The commission believes that the military culture created by such policy priorities\n\nmay have been a factor contributing to the decision to unleash massive firepower in Rafah\n\nand Shuja’iya, in utter disregard of its devastating impact on the civilian population.\n\nMoreover, applying this protocol in the context of a densely populated environment\n\nthrough the use of heavy weaponry predictably leads to violations of the principles of\n\ndistinction and proportionality.”\n\n— Report of the detailed findings of the independent commission of inquiry established\n\npursuant to Human Rights Council resolution S-21/1 of 23 July 2014 (24 June 2015):121\n\n293. The sheer number of shells fired, as well as the reported dropping of over 100 oneton\n\nbombs in a short period of time in a densely populated area, together with the reported\n\nuse of an artillery barrage, raise questions as to the respect by the IDF of the rules of\n\ndistinction, precautions and proportionality. These methods and means employed by the\n\nIDF could not, in such a small and densely populated area, be directed at a specific\n\nmilitary target and could not adequately distinguish between civilians and civilian\n\nobjects and military objectives as required by IHL. The information available also\n\nindicates that during the Shuja’iya operation on 19 and 20 July the IDF violated the\n\nprohibition of treating several distinct individual military objectives in a densely\n\npopulated area as one single military objective. Therefore, there are strong indications\n\nthat the IDF’s Shuja’iya operation on 19 and 20 July was conducted in violation of the\n\nprohibition of indiscriminate attacks and may amount to a war crime.\n\n294. The Shuja’iya operation also raises serious concerns that the IDF did not conform\n\nwith its obligation to take precautionary measures in attack. The choice of the methods\n\nand means used by the IDF cannot be reconciled with the obligation to take constant\n\ncare to spare civilians and civilian objects or at the very least to minimize incidental loss\n\nof civilian life and damage to civilian objects in a densely populated area. . . .\n\n340. . . . The extensive devastation, carried out by the IDF in Khuza’a, in particular the\n\nrazing of entire areas of the town by artillery fire, air strikes and bulldozers, indicates\n\nthat the IDF carried out destructions that were not required by military necessity. . . .\n\n341. The extent of the destruction combined with the statements made during the\n\noperation by the commander of the Brigade responsible for the Khuza’a operation to the\n\neffect that “Palestinians have to understand that this does not pay off,” are indicative of\n\n121 Human Rights Council, Report of the detailed findings of the independent commission of inquiry established pursuant to\n\nHuman Rights Council resolution S-21/1, A/HRC/29/CRP.4 (24 June 2015), https://undocs.org/A/HRC/29/CRP.4, paras.\n\n226, 293-294, 340-342, 348, 418, 576, 671 (emphasis added).\n\n23\n\na punitive intent in the action of the IDF in Khuza’a and may constitute collective\n\npunishment. . . .\n\n342. Information received by the commission suggests that in several cases Palestinians\n\nwho had been detained, mostly in their homes in Khuza’a, had been insulted, beaten,\n\nthreatened to be killed and otherwise ill-treated by IDF soldiers. In some cases the\n\ntreatment described by some of the witnesses could amount to torture. . . .\n\n348. Other incidents and alleged patterns of behavior in Khuza’a raise a number of\n\nconcerns under international law. . . . These incidents include: the incidents in which\n\ncivilians were allegedly shot at by IDF soldiers; attacks against ambulances; and the\n\nfailure to provide medical assistance to wounded persons. . . .\n\n418. The IDF has argued that the high number of buildings destroyed in Operation\n\n“Protective Edge” resulted from the targeting of terrorist infrastructure and intense\n\nfighting on the ground. However, the evidence gathered by the commission, including the\n\nassessment of the episodes above, video and photo materials, observations by UNITARUNOSAT\n\nand anecdotal testimonies by IDF soldiers, indicate that the vast scale of\n\ndestruction may have been adopted as tactics of war. . . .\n\n576. Alongside the toll on civilian lives, there was enormous destruction of civilian\n\nproperty in Gaza: 18 000 housing units were destroyed in whole or in part. . . . [H]aving\n\na home has an emotional dimension – the place where memories are stored – and often\n\nmany other items to which inhabitants’ memories relate. Having one’s home destroyed\n\nor severely damaged means being deprived of more than a physical structure; it also\n\ndirectly impacts on the very essence of one’s existence . . .\n\n671. Questions arise regarding the role of senior officials who set military policy in\n\nseveral areas examined by the commission, such as in the attacks of the Israel Defense\n\nForces on residential buildings; the use of artillery and other explosive weapons with\n\nwide-area effects in densely populated areas; the destruction of entire neighbourhoods in\n\nGaza; and the regular resort to live ammunition by the Israel Defense Forces, notably in\n\ncrowd-control situations, in the West Bank. In many cases, individual soldiers may have\n\nbeen following agreed military policy, but it may be that the policy itself violates the laws\n\nof war.”\n\n— Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian\n\nterritories occupied since 1967 (22 October 2021):122 The Special Rapporteur remarked that\n\n“[r]egrettably, the international community’s remarkable tolerance for Israeli exceptionalism\n\nin its conduct of the occupation has allowed realpolitik to trump rights, power to supplant justice\n\nand impunity to undercut accountability.”\n\n— Report of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian\n\nterritories occupied since 1967 (22 December 2020):123 The Special Rapporteur found that\n\n“the actions of Israel towards the protected population of Gaza amount to collective punishment\n\nunder international law.
