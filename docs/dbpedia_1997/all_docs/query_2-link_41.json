        "text": "Israel's foreign ministry has apologised after the British deputy ambassador to Tel Aviv was forced to strip for a security search at the Israeli prime minister's office.\n\nJanet Rogan, who is Britain's consul general in Tel Aviv, was with a delegation of British Treasury officials, led by Ed Balls, the economic secretary to the Treasury, earlier this month. They arrived at the Jerusalem office of the prime minister, Ehud Olmert, ahead of a meeting with his chief of staff and his political adviser. The names of the visitors had been given in advance, the Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper said yesterday.\n\nBut security guards ordered Ms Rogan to undergo a physical search, the paper said. She refused and presented her diplomatic identity card. However, she was then made to step behind a partition and to undergo a physical search, which included removing her blouse. The Yedioth described the search as a \"prolonged, needless and humiliating process\" and said the diplomat was visibly upset.\n\nLater, after Ms Rogan made a written complaint, the prime minister's office investigated the incident and an Israeli foreign ministry official met her to apologise. Ms Rogan has worked at the embassy in Tel Aviv for a year and a half after previous postings in Iraq, Sarajevo and Beijing.\n\nSecurity is tight at Israeli government offices and at Ben Gurion international airport in Tel Aviv, where checks involve sophisticated metal and explosives detectors and questioning. Diplomats are usually spared detailed physical checks.\n\nA spokesman for the Israeli prime minister's office told the Yedioth: \"Given reservations about the manner in which treatment was extended in this case, an investigative team was appointed. In light of the team's findings, the procedures were updated and lessons were learned, and an apology was issued for any emotional pain that was caused by the affair.\"\n\nZehavit Ben-Hillel, a spokeswoman for the Israeli foreign ministry, last night told the Guardian: \"The issue was checked and we are in touch with the British embassy to the satisfaction of both sides.\"\n\nA British embassy spokeswoman last night confirmed that the incident took place. \"She was subjected to an intrusive security check and the British embassy took up the issue with the prime minister's office who have since apologised and told us they have instituted procedures to ensure it doesn't happen again,\" the spokeswoman said."
