        "text": "Three of Sarah and Shlomo Ramati's children were kidnapped.\n\nThree.\n\nThe testimony of the sister, Michal Maoz:\n\nThe parents and siblings lived in the immigrant camps that were on one side, while the nursery in the Rosh Haayin transit camp was on the other side, within walking distance.\n\nAll our life was around this, we grew up with that talk. My mother always said they told her the girl was sick, pale, that she should put her in the nursery and come to breastfeed her. She always repeated that she came in to breastfeed the baby like every day of that week, and the room was simply empty. She yelled in Yemenite: \"where's my baby? Where's my baby ?!\".\n\nNo one around knew Yemenite. And no one talked to her. They didn't answer her. When my father arrived, he was given a handwritten note announcing that the baby had passed away.\n\nThe note is written on a piece paper with an inscription from a launderette on the other side.\n\nAt one point, all of us, the immigrants from Saawaan District in Yemen, were moved by truck to Beersheba, to the Shekhuna A neighborhood. My father told my mother \"If we move away, from Rosh Haayin, the story with the girl remains in the Rosh Haayin. No one from Be'er Sheva will listen to us.\" And so it was.\n\nMy parents always felt there were more parents like them, more stories like that. They started making reports in Yedioth Ahronoth with their personal stories.\n\nWhen my father moved to Beersheba, he received an I.D. that said Zahra was alive!\n\nMy father asked it to be corrected, but he was told that without a death certificate it could not be done, and when he asked for a death certificate - he was told that it couldn't be obtained.\n\nSeventeen years later, an investigation committee said the girl had died of an intestinal disease and was buried. They also wrote she was brought to burial in a children's ward, although when they announced her death to my parents, they told them that she had already been buried [as a baby, not as a girl].\n\nI personally went to the cemetery, to Zahra's plot. The graves look very new and do not look like fifty-year-old graves. When I asked there and insisted, I was told that they don't deal with this story."
