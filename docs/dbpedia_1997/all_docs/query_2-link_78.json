        "text": "Watan-Israeli activists and Twitter users launched campaigns targeting the family of Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas’s political bureau, specifically his sister, who the “Jerusalem Post” claimed was receiving treatment in a hospital in the occupied area of Beersheba.\n\nIn response, Twitter users argued that the land is Palestinian, and it’s the occupation and settlers who should leave, not the rightful owners of the land.\n\nThe “Jerusalem Post” claimed that some of Ismail Haniyeh’s sisters live in Tel Aviv within the Negev, and one of them gave birth to a child in recent days and received treatment with her newborn in a hospital in the occupied territories.\n\nThis sparked a series of tweets calling for their expulsion and deportation to the Gaza Strip due to the ongoing war there. However, the tweeters quickly emphasized that no Israeli settler has the right to speak about rights and demands in a place they occupy, with no basis for their presence there at all.\n\n“Our land, they are occupiers”\n\n“Tamer” commented on what happened, clarifying: “Ismail Haniyeh has sisters in the occupied city of Beersheba. One of them gave birth today at Soroka Hospital.”\n\nThe tweeter added that this turned into “Hebrew newspaper talk and Israeli accounts attacking them and demanding their expulsion to the Gaza Strip.”\n\nTamer commented on those demands: “The land is ours, and they are occupying terrorists. They should leave and return to their homelands. We exist wherever we want in our homeland, Palestine.”\n\nThe daughter of Ismail Haniyeh’s sister\n\nThe Hebrew website “Yedioth Ahronoth” mentioned that the one receiving treatment is the daughter of one of Haniyeh’s sisters, and her child was born prematurely and was admitted to the hospital in the neonatal intensive care unit. The hospital medical staff is working to save his life.\n\nIsmail Haniyeh, 62, currently resides in Doha, is married, and is the father of 13 children, with two brothers and eight sisters, three of whom live in Beersheba, according to the Jerusalem Post.\n\nThe newspaper “Maariv” quoted National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir as saying that “relatives of Ismail Haniyeh are not only not supposed to receive medical treatment in a hospital in Israel, but they are also supposed to be deported from Israel,” according to him."
