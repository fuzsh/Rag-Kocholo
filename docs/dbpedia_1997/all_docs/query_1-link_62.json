        "meta_description": "When the Tel Aviv University Alumni Organization was established in May 2015, it was decided that its primary goal would be to strengthen the ties not only between the alumni and the University, but also among alumni themselves. Such bonds are mutually beneficial &ndash; influential and inspiring alumni enhance the reputation of the University, while an outstanding university raises the value of every graduate&#39;s degree. &nbsp; Tel Aviv University alumni hold key positions in every area of Israel&#39;s economy - an enormous asset which the Organization wishes to highlight, cultivate and promote. One of its first initiatives was launching a series of Encounters with Inspiring Alumni. In these unique meetings successful TAU graduates from different fields share experiences with fellow alumni about their journey to the top. &nbsp; Most meetings consist of two parts. First, the main speaker tells his/her inspiring story, which is then followed by a special enrichment or entertainment program with top lecturers and/or performers. &nbsp; The unique series provides TAU alumni with an enjoyable platform for networking and personal enrichment in a friendly and pleasant social atmosphere. &nbsp; Although every inspiring alumni&nbsp;brings his/her unique experience to life, offering a different kind of personal story and inspiration, they all share a desire to give back, a joy in returning to their roots, and the satisfaction of inspiring their fellow alumni to grow personally and professionally. &nbsp; New events are continually advertised on the event calendar in this website and on the&nbsp;Facebook page of the Tel Aviv University Alumni Organization. &nbsp; We look forward to seeing you with us! &nbsp;",

        "text": "Tel Aviv University Alumni Organization, headed by Ms. Siglit Ben-Hayon, held an exciting master class event for alumni with the acclaimed and award-winning director, screenwriter and producer - Ari Pullman, a graduate of Steve Tisch School of Film and Television at the University, at The Steinhardt Museum of Natural History.\n\nDespite the stormy weather, many graduates honoured us with their presence.\n\nMs. Ben-Hayon thanked the participants and pointed out that on the Friday preceding the event, an Open Day was held on campus to which thousands of potential students flocked.\n\nThis year, the Alumni Organization in collaboration with the University's marketing department gave special benefits at the Open Day to graduates and their families who wish to re-enrol:\n\n50% discount on registration fees for graduates of the last 10 years, a free tour of the Natural History Museum as well as the \"Ano\" museum with the possibility of a free voucher to be redeemed during the month of February for those who did not have time to do so at the Open Day, in addition to the lectures and panels that took place on campus.\n\nThen Don Barak, the filmmaker, writer and editor, a graduate of the Eitan Berglas School of Economics and Steve Tisch School of Film and Television at the University, gave a speech, noting how studying at the University had contributed to his work and praised the activities of the Alumni Organization which are similar to the work done in the USA where he currently resides.\n\nDuring the fascinating and inspiring conversation with Mr. Pullman, he reviewed his life story from his days at the University, which he said were wonderful years, to his personal and professional success.\n\nThe moderator for the conversation was Binyamin Tobias, a film critic of Yedioth Ahronoth, who is also a graduate of the Tish Film School.\n\nThe talk was accompanied by a screening of selected clips from Mr. Pullman's acclaimed and award-winning films.\n\nThe Tel Aviv University Alumni Organization, Headed by Sigalit Ben Hayoun, in collaboration with the Yolanda and David Katz Faculty of the Arts, held an event for the new year for the TAU’s leading alumni community, on Entrepreneurship, Technology, Art and everything in between.\n\nThe event was opened by Amos Elad, VP of Public Affairs, Resource Development & Alumni Affairs at TAU, who said:\n\n\"I would like to thank all of you for joining and coming to this event and for being part of the Tel Aviv University alumni community, which allows our thousands of current students, the next generation of TAU alumni, to continue to develop and research and be whoever they want to become.\"\n\nProf. Eran Neuman, dean of TAU’s Yolanda and David Katz Faculty of the Arts, led the guests on a tour in the The Genia Schreiber Art Gallery through the exhibition \"Primary Sources\", which included various displays from the faculty's fields of research and creation. In his speech, later in the evening, he noted that \"even in an era of advanced technology, we see that we cannot do without the art that develops a mankind’s creative thinking.\n\nOur faculty promotes thinking outside the box, and creativity based on historical knowledge and in-depth research. We are proud and happy to establish the Center of Israeli Arts, which includes the archival collections of leading artists who worked here.\"\n\nThe event included a panel, with the participation of:\n\nGigi Levy Weiss, General Partner, NFX, Alumnus of TAU’s Coller School of Management\n\nSigalit Landau, Israeli Artist, specializing in Sculpture, video Art and installations\n\nRoni Gilat-Bahrav, moderator of the panel, International Senior Director & MD Christie's (Israel) Ltd. 20th Century Art specialist, Alumna of TAU’s Faculty of the Arts and Faculty of Social Sciences\n\nGigi Levy Weiss noted that:\n\n\"In my opinion, every artist is a type of entrepreneur, because they take something that burns inside them and carries it out despite all the difficulties, and on the other hand, every entrepreneur is a type of artist, because they take what they want to create, and executes it in their own unique way, which is often Very different from the advice they receive from the environment.\n\nThe connection between technology and artistic creation is an area that fascinates me. Sigalit Landau has been using various technologies for many years, but we are currently experiencing an acceleration in the use of machine learning in the creative process, in various production technologies, in digital art and in the representation of ownership of art through NFTs. All of these are in the swing of development.'\n\n\"There is a problem with the consumption of art by the younger generation - art is supposed to evoke emotion, provoke intellectual curiosity and take us out of our comfort zone, while TikTok videos have been engineered by thousands of engineers to release as much dopamine as possible in the brain and lead you to watch the next video and the next. It will be interesting to see how the younger generation who grew up like this manage to consume more complicated works of art.\n\nJust 3 days ago, a painting called \"Théâtre D'opéra Spatial\" won at the Colorado State Fair 2022, which turned out to have been created by the artist Jason Allen who used a machine learning program called Midjourney. In the future, as programs will know how to produce visual images, the thing that will constitute the uniqueness of an artist is the choice of software, its 'training' and the sentence that the artist will enter into the software to create the most unique image.\n\nI don't think the introduction of AI will replace the creative world, but it will certainly enrich it.”\n\nWhile playing live with the software Dall-E, Gigi Levy-Weiss and the artist Sigalit Landau tried to create works of art based on sentences they invented at that moment, and Sigalit pointed out how much respect this technology gives the spoken words, in a way that could become the great hour of poetry.\n\nTo the question of what the future of the art world is in the next decade, Gigi Levy-Weiss answered:\n\n\"In the past, before the industrial revolution, art was only the property of the rich. After the internet revolution, there was an expectation that art would be for everyone, but on the contrary, art became a more elitist and closed club that only caters to those with big money. I think this cannot be the future of art, and believe that the way our children will consume art - digital, online, in the Metaverse, produced by or with the help of machine learning - will be completely different from what we know today, which may lead to true democratization.\"\n\nSiglit Landau wanted to mention that behind every sketch in the wonderful exhibition now on display at the gallery there was/is an Israeli or an immigrant artist who apparently experienced a situation that is not simple and does not support creative work, and it is important to remember that. Culture is struggling and an artist needs a lot of persistence to realize and continue to create under conditions that in many cases seem impossible.\n\n\"I invented a new word that plays with the words Entrepreneurship and Contemplation in Hebrew - it comes from what I plot with the desire to initiate, although sometimes entrepreneurs have the ability to be more creative than artists.\n\nArtists, or at least I - sometimes don't know how to come and ask for things. I'm used to giving everything right from the start to later maybe get something back from society, especially since sometimes the museums don't even have a budget for racks to hang my works on. But art is not necessarily a political act, but simply a desire to do something because it will be really cool and it burns in me to find out if it could be realized successfully, and we need to find a way to finance it.'\n\nAmong the alumni who attended the event:\n\nDafna Meitar-Nechmad, Chairwoman of the Tel Aviv University (TAU) Board of Governors\n\nDov Kotler, Chief Executive Officer at Bank Hapoalim\n\nYossi Ben Shalom, Co-Founder, Co-Owner and DBSI Investments Ltd.\n\nAviad Meitar, Businessman, Social entrepreneur, and a philanthropist.

The connection between alumni of various faculties is a common thread in the multitude of nuances within the Israeli industry, and the extraordinary creation of this global production, is a great testament to the added value TAU gives to our alumni. This is the core of the activities of the TAU Alumni Organization, and the many achievements won by the world changing community of TAU alumni shows that we are doing it right. We are proud that a connection between an alumnus of TAU’s Steve Tisch School of Film and Television in the Faculty of the Arts, and an alumnus of the Faculty of Law, led at the end of a long and complex process to this masterpiece that we are now about to watch for the first time.\"\n\nGideon Tadmor said in his opening speech: \"The main part of my business activity in recent years has been centered on energy, the discoveries of natural gas in Israel and Cyprus and the establishment of the natural gas economy, and recently in the field of oil and gas production in the USA, but I have always had a passion for the world of cinema and television - and so I founded a studio for Indie films years ago in New York, and within this framework we produced several films.\n\nAs a result of this activity, I was exposed to talented Israeli creators, who were frustrated that they could not find their way to realize their work and bring it to the international audience, despite the fact that Israel was established in the world consciousness as an important source country for quality content. In light of this, I decided to get up and do something - to build a new and unique commercial studio, with the goal of building a bridge between the creators and their creation and the international television and film market, freed from the traditions of regulation in Israel. That's how Emilio and I set out two years ago on a new path. Happily, MGM's roaring lion joined us and became a first-rate financial and professional force multiplier.\n\nI am particularly proud that the first project of this joint venture is the series \"The Devil's Confession: The Lost Eichmann Tapes\", a high-quality, significant and one-off documentary series with lasting historical value, which will have traction in the international market. The shocking series is a historical document, the main of which is a young and scarred country, which faced its challenges and decisive and critical decisions for its survival and success in its early years.\"\n\nAdv. Tami Raveh Hausner, Chairperson of the Board of Directors of N12 News Israel and daughter of Gideon Hausner, who served as Attorney General and was the Prosecutor in the Eichmann trial: \"My dad’s soul was burned in front of the glass cell... Two weeks before Eichmann was captured he was appointed as Attorney General. He had doubts about whether he could do a faithful job and represent the survivors of the Holocaust because he did not experience the Holocaust first hand. I remember how he gathered us in the small family kitchen and told us that he intended to be the prosecutor himself. This was one of the first decisions he made and the first and last time the Israeli Attorney General appeared every day as a prosecutor in a case being handled in court.\n\nHe decided that there would be witnesses who would come to testify, in addition to the documents, but when they started contacting survivors, many refused. He would bring them to our house, mother would serve them tea and cookies and he would convince them to testify. Father really wanted the Sassen recordings, which are presented in this documentary, but I have no doubt that even if he had the recordings in his hands he would not have given up any of the 110 witnesses. When the witnesses began to testify, suddenly there was a huge influx of people who wanted to testify and it was impossible to add them. It was only at that point in time that people began to tell their families about their experiences from the Holocaust, and that is the tremendous achievement. It is increasingly important to show this series all over the world, to show the world who Eichmann was, and also against the background of the rise of global anti-Semitism - who his successors are.\"\n\nYariv Mozer, the series’ creator, said: \"Thank you very much to everyone - Kan 11, Gideon Tadmor and Tami Raveh, who accompanied me since the beginning of the project and gave me her father’s book, from which you can see what an effort was made to obtain the Sassen recordings. I am proud to say first and foremost as an alum of the Steve Tisch School of Film and Television at Tel Aviv University, that a long list of TAU alumni accompanied the making of this project, including of course Executive Producer Gideon Tadmor, Emilio Shenkar, Kobi Sitt and many more.\n\nI studied Film and Television between 2000-2004, close to the release of another documentary film, \"The Specialist\", based on Hannah Arendt's book. This tendentious film showed Eichmann as a small clerk who carried out orders. My Eichmann trial consciousness was based on this film. In our world, unfortunately, movies have more influence than books. The Sassen recordings provide a counterpoint to Arendt's theory, and that’s what provoked me to set out to make the series, with the mission to obtain them, and I am happy that I fulfilled the mission I undertook and am proud of the success of the series.\"\n\nProf. Roni Stauber, the Academic and Scientific Consultant of the series: \"Historically, Hausner's decision to base the trial on a large number of witnesses showed his greatness. Hausner applied the line set by Ben-Gurion to explain the story of the Holocaust through Eichmann's trial. That is why Eichmann was brought to Israel and was not assassinated in Buenos Aires. Unlike the Nuremberg Trials, which did not deal with the Holocaust as a unique event and generally avoided basing indictments on testimonies, Hausner sought to make the voice of the victim heard. He had educational goals. He wanted to explain through the trial to the youth growing up in Israel the impossible situations the Jews in Europe faced in the face of the Nazi murder policy. He sought to shatter the image of Holocaust Survivors as those who went like sheep to the slaughter. Making the voice of the victim heard is the main legacy of the Eichmann trial to the international criminal law regarding genocide and crimes against humanity. This is Hausner's greatness, as historians of The Eichmann trial emphasize\".\n\nAmong the alumni who attended the event:\n\nProf. Eran Neuman, Dean of the David and Yolanda Katz Faculty of the Arts, Tel Aviv University\n\nProf. Miriam Shefer Mossensohn, Head of TAU’s Zvi Yavetz School of Historical Studies\n\nYael Blecher, judge of the Tel Aviv District Court\n\nDana Yagur, Partner in the Meitar Liquornik Geva Leshem Tal Law Firm\n\nYoram Bechler, Co-Founder and CEO of AIO\n\nTamar Tunik Cohen, Foreign News Editor at Calcalist\n\nAyellet Hashahar Bitton Perla, Judge of the Krayot Magistrate Court\n\nAdv.

Our ability to create a connection between different fields and interfaces constitutes a significant growth engine for the entire economy and puts a unique spotlight, especially on unusual combinations combinations - for example between culinary and industry.\"\n\nProf. Miriam Shefer Mossensohn stated that \"the study of history allows us to think outside the box. Things that we take for granted today were not understood 20 years ago, let alone 200 years ago. Together with the departure from the ivory tower, study of the past combined with understanding of the present, allows us to make informed decisions going forward towards the future\".\n\nRoy Yerushalmi, a doctoral researcher of Culinary History, reviewed the change that has taken place in Humanities studies over the past two decades: \"Alumni of the Faculty of Humanities leave here with exceptional analytical abilities, tools for expression and thinking outside the box. This uniqueness has not gone unnoticed by employers and senior managers - today everyone understands that there is business and occupational significance in studying the Humanities. When Amos Shapira was CEO of Cellcom, he said he was interested in alumni of the Faculty of Humanities. At the time it sounded like a joke, but today this thinking is completely normative and graduates of Philosophy and History are also in demand in the High-Tech industry and Business Consulting. There has also been a profound change in the curricula themselves, which have not frozen in time: Today at the School of Historical Studies at Tel Aviv University, researchers are engaged in fields such as History of Culinary, of Football and more.\"\n\nJulia Zaher shared with audience the beginning of her career as Owner of the leading tahini brand, and the tribulations of the beginning:\n\n\"Anyone who dreams of doing something must remember that all beginnings are difficult. When I arrived at the factory 19 years ago, tahini was not a sought-after product and was certainly not an integral part of international cuisine. Our motto is that food connects people. We have never looked at the competitors but put our emphasis on quality. Since 1990 we have been using the same variety of sesame and producing the tahini with the same traditional production method. In 2015 we moved to a new factory and there was a debate about how to integrate the technology. We decided to continue to maintain the unique line and this is part of our international success. Today it is a family company, which invests in society, and it is important for us to promote disadvantaged populations, among them people with disabilities, the LGBTQ community, Encouraging women to enter the labor market and more.\"\n\nHer daughter Lana Zaher stated that \"over the years we have been able to promote our product - raw tahini - and establish it as an export industry. For years we were a niche at food exhibitions, but in recent years there has been a breakthrough in the perception of food, and suddenly tahini became a super food. Nowadays we are viewed as a healthy, sought-after food, which is served in restaurants all over the world. The USA is our largest market, where there’s a long-standing great demand, but we produce also for Europe and the Far East, where sesame has always been a sought-after flavor. We work a lot with Israeli chefs abroad, because tahini became a good base for any haute culinary cuisine. Tahini is popular all around the world today. Unfortunately, we cannot compete with the prices in Dubai or Jordan due to production costs, but the Israeli market has an advantage that also comes from the promotion of Israel’s great chefs.\"\n\nNir Gal, Deputy CEO of Barkan Vineyards spoke about the transformations that have taken place over the years in the Israeli wine market:\n\n\"In the beginning, the Israeli wine market was a fairly basic commodity market. In the 1990s, a revolution of quality began, focusing on popular international varietal wines.\n\nAt the beginning of the 2000s there was a further maturation and a greater emphasis on terroir in the preparation and marketing of the wine. Terroir is a word that expresses the character and uniqueness of the place where the wine is grown.\n\nIn the last decade we have undergone another evolution, and that is the search and promotion of local varieties. Ancient varieties have been found whose origins go back hundreds of years. Also, a number of wineries, led by Barkan, began to promote the scarlet variety that was developed in Israel in the 1970s. This promotion of local varieties is natural and important because wine is first an identity and a story with a cultural and historical context. In Israel you can find local varieties under the beta series, which is an experimental series of Barkan Vineyards, where we promote special projects.\n\nIn terms of exporting Israeli wine, 80% of it is for Jewish population outside of Israel, who are looking for both kosher and the connection to Israel as a place. The main challenge of the Israeli wine industry is to expand the target audience beyond the kosher world and to establish Israel as a wine country with a unique identity and quality. We see great interest among opinion leaders around the world in our local varieties and in stories that emphasize Israeli terroir.\"\n\nAmong the alumni who attended the event:\n\nEran Ron, Founder and Chairman of Rinsberg Holding Ltd. and Co-owner of E.R.D.S.

Among the reasons for this, he stated that the companies are interested in perfecting their understanding of how people think, ways to influence customers, build teams more effectively, make people find more interest in the content and on the other hand understand what causes addiction, or aversion to certain products.\n\nProf. Cerf said also that Brain Research makes it possible to give a broader explanation and interpretation to the results of psychological studies from recent years, with an emphasis on Behavioral Psychology. \"There were many studies in psychology that showed that humans frequently behave irrationally, but did not offer ways to change the existing situation. As if telling people: That’s just how we are. Here the neuroscientists came and said, \"It can't be. Everything happens in the brain and if we want to change something, then we will have to understand exactly how it works, what causes it and what affects it. And accordingly, to improve our way of thinking.\"\n\nIn his lecture, Prof. Cerf surveyed the variety of possibilities for using Brain Research in the business world. Contributing to the world of marketing, management, decision making, recruitment, team building and organizational behavior, accounting and finance. Referring to the field of financing, for example, he noted that: \"People find it difficult to give a realistic assessment regarding the question, 'How much risk are they willing to take when it comes to money. How much are they willing to risk or lose'\". Even professionals with years of experience in the field, often find it hard to accept the fact that a purchase fell through or that an investment did not succeed, despite knowing the risks from the start. This is where brain research comes in and helps to give those investors (beginners or experts) an indication from deeper areas of the brain that hold more personal information regarding decision-making and risks. A combination of knowledge about the conscious experience of risk, combined with the limited access we have to our brain, can help people assess risks more accurately. Brain research tools, which allow access to deeper areas of our brain, are an effective way to understand ourselves and the way we behave better.\"\n\nIn conclusion, Cerf pointed out that while Brain Research has already shown some important contributions to the business world, and many of the companies he works with find many uses for this world, it is still not sufficiently accessible to the general public, and his suggestion to the audience was to find a way to contact brain researchers who could help mediate the innovative studies for the business world and to help make technological capabilities accessible to businesses, small and large.\n\nAmong the alumni who tuned in to watch the webinar in real time:\n\nDafna Landau, Head of Real Estate division at Bank Leumi\n\nIris Ronly Riklis, Manager of the Cultural and Art Institutions Forum, Israel\n\nShira Bibas, Digital Experience Manager at the Strauss Group\n\nLilach Danin-Lavee, Founder & Owner of Speak Up Now\n\nChaim Rafalowski, Disaster Management and EU Projects Coordinator at Magen David Adom\n\nProf. Michael Schimmel, Director of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Shaare Zedek Hospital\n\n…and many, many others.\n\nWith the aim of strengthening TAU’s women alumni community, the organization holds an annual event to mark International Women's Day with World Changing Alumnae. International Women's Day 2022’s event was a return to our tradition of physical events (after two years of webinars imposed on us by the COVID-19 pandemic), with participation of:\n\nHilla Haddad Chemlnik, Director General of Israel’s Ministry of Innovation, Science and Technology, Alumna of TAU’s Faculty of Social Sciences and Coller School of Management\n\nLiran Avisar Ben Horin, Director General of Israel’s Ministry of Communications, Alumna of TAU’s Coller School of Management and the Buchmann Faculty of Law\n\nNaama Schultz, Director General of the Deputy Prime Minister's Office, Alumna of TAU’s Faculty of Social Sciences\n\nPanel moderator: Amalya Duek, Journalist, economics reporter and presenter at the News Company, Alumna of TAU’s Buchmann Faculty of Law\n\nThe event was opened with greetings from Prof. Neta Ziv, TAU’s Commissioner for Equity and Diversity: \"Every year on March 8th, the world celebrates International Women's Day, with the understanding that there is no one woman who can represent all women. Women today face the war in Ukraine, women in Afghanistan were excluded because of the takeover of the Taliban and of course there are also women in Academia. International Women's Day is the day when we try to create the common denominator for all women wherever they are.\n\nThe good news: in this academic year, there is a female majority of students in all Israeli institutions and in all degrees. The proportion of female board members is also on the rise. However, Sadly, the higher the ranks are, the number of women decreases. At a certain point, when you meet the top of the academic hierarchy (President-CEO-Rector) the number of women in senior positions comes to a complete halt. Encouragement and support programs are needed to narrow the gap. Over the years, women have been absent from senior management positions and this cannot be fixed in one day. Higher education institutions face a big challenge. Today is a reminder to men and women that the fight for Gender Equality is not over yet.\"\n\nSigalit Ben Hayoun, Co-Founder and Head of the TAU Alumni Organization: \"After two years, during which we had to refrain from holding face-to-face events, we are proud that the first frontal alumni event celebrates World Changing Alumnae. Women are about 55% of TAU’s 206K alumni, and many of them - although still not enough - hold senior positions in all fields of the economy and in all sectors.\n\nTel Aviv University promotes and encourages STEM studies - the studies of the technological professions - for women, and created a program that includes joint meetings and enriching workshops of the entire faculty of exact sciences and of each school in the faculty separately, which will provide tools to help students all through their academic journey.\"\n\nAmong the topics discussed in the panel was the question of academic studies at TAU and its effect on their professional and personal development. The alumnae also referred to a statement made recently by the Minister of Defense Benny Gantz (Also a TAU Alumnus) to the Minister of Transportation Merav Michaeli: \"Statements like Gantz's to Merav Michaeli are said less and less often, and even then, they do not pass nonchalantly nowadays. Perhaps there are some who are annoyed by Merav Michaeli's style of speaking, but there is no doubt that she did A very fundamental change in the Israeli discourse.\"\n\nCarmela Eldad, Naama Schultz’s mother, came to hear her daughter, who, among other things, also referred to the beginning of her career in the position:\n\n\"The beginning was very difficult. Eyebrows were raised because I'm not just a woman, I'm a deputy woman... but by now, no one raises an eyebrow anymore. Our office deals with complex processes that require cooperation between several government ministries. This position, like many Other positions, mainly requires a sharp head, a heart in the right place and a lot of desire to do good. Today we passed a resolution for the development of the Haifa Bay, that concerns 9 different government ministries. In this government specifically, there is a very clear awareness of the importance of women and there really are many women in the government and also in key positions in other ministries. Hopefully, we will only grow from here on.\"\n\nLiran Avisar Ben Horin commented on the differences between men's and women's attitudes when competing for senior positions: \"We are missing in the room when we are not present, and this develops in us the tendency to think that we are less suitable. Women always say, \"We do not meet the threshold conditions.\" For some reason, men always meet the threshold conditions. They do not have this hesitation.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with ambitious goals, but the first step should be the allocation of quotas for key positions to be filled by women. It is a process that builds itself. If we use quotas in the early stages we won't need them later. You have to overcome the butterflies in your stomach and let go of the fears that rule us. As soon as we sit on the chair and do what we know how to do best, everything works out.\"\n\nHilla Haddad Chemlnik addressed the question of whether the goal set by the ministry she manages, according to which 15% of the employees in the Israeli economy will work in high tech, is not megalomanic:\n\n\"Without government involvement we will reach a number slightly lower than the target, therefore 15% is certainly a worthy vision. But - without government involvement the majority of people who will join high tech will most likely be men from Tel Aviv. Herzliya is also starting to become far away for high tech workers. We must intervene to include more people from the periphery and from a variety of sectors. Regarding women - the proportion of women in high tech has been at 35 percent for almost 10 years. In the core of high tech, it decreases to about 25%. It is in the academia where we see the increase in participation in the studies of high-tech professions. We have set ourselves a goal of 45% Women among the addition. It is impossible to invent women who will study computer science, but we must strive to integrate more of those who are in the training courses in the academia into this industry.\"\n\nLater, Hila shared exactly when she realized what is the glass ceiling for women:\n\n\"My husband and I were reservists at the Technion together and studied aeronautics and space engineering together. We were 4 female students among dozens of men. I was told that today the situation is different and I really hope it is so. Later on, we enlisted together as aeronautics and space engineers in the Air Force. At the age of 27, just when you reach the stage in the army service when you’re supposed to be promoted to the next level, to the rank of Major, we decided to get married. From the moment I put on a ring, I felt the glass ceiling. We applied for the same positions, with the same commanders, but no one asked him about the upcoming wedding. The difference was dramatic, and it was then that I also decided not to pursue a military career. I studied an MA degree in Diplomacy at Tel Aviv University. I did it for the soul, but eventually it's the degree that helps me the most in my current job. A degree in engineering doesn't prepare you to manage a decision-making process or to be good in negotiation, whether overt or covert, and you can't develop in the public sector without being able to negotiate.\"\n\nThe artistic part of the evening was a show by the creative talents of TAU’s Buchmann-Mehta School of Music, titled \"All about Chava\", a musical tribute to Chava Alberstein named after the film ‘All About Eve’, under the artistic direction of Motti Pearlman and the musical direction and conducting of the school's Alumnus, Nitai Rach. The show was a moving musical journey through some of the best songs from Hebrew music icon Chava Alberstein, performed by singers Chen Wine, Yaara Attias, Maya Sayag, Mika Cohen, Netta Simchon and Rilli Willow, accompanied by a string quintet and piano.\n\nAmong the alumni who attended the event:\n\nKeren Shaked, Head of Experience Management at AKT Global\n\nHana Rado, Business and Social Entrepreneur\n\nDaphna Gazit Weiss, CEO of Marietta Holdings\n\nNoa Denai, Director of Knowledge and Information Management and Freedom of Information Law Supervisor, Clalit Health Services\n\nChaim Rafalowski, Disaster Management and EU Projects Coordinator at Magen David Adom\n\nGabi Joffe, General Manager, Israel of Allscripts – DbMotion\n\nDr. Dania Shapira, Board Member and Chair of Internet Committee of the Israeli Association of Periodical Press (IAPP)\n\nDina Niron, Founder and CEO of Sparks Advisory\n\nMeirav Schwartz Alon, Deputy of the Business Audit Department, Bank Hapoalim\n\nJoanna Landau, Founder and CEO of Vibe Israel, member of the Board of Trustees of Tel Aviv University\n\nand many others.\n\nThe Tel Aviv University Alumni Organization thanks the Jerusalem Vineyard Winery, who sponsored the event, and CEO and Head Winemaker Lior Lexer.\n\nView the photo album from the event on Facebook>\n\nThe Tel Aviv University Alumni Organization, Headed by Sigalit Ben Hayoun, thanks the hundreds of alumni who tuned in to the webinar \"How did a High Culture Film Project Became the Largest Documentary Project in Israel\", with the creator of the award-winning series \"The Hebrews\", Yair Qeder, Alumnus of the Multidisciplinary Program in Liberal Arts and the Department of Literature at TAU’s Faculty of Humanities, in conversation with Yedioth Ahronoth's film critic, Binyamin Tobias, Alumnus of the Steve Tisch School of Film and Television in TAU’s David and Yolanda Katz Faculty of the Arts.\n\nAt the beginning of the interview, Binyamin Tobias asked Yair Qeder about his time studying at TAU’s Faculty of Humanities, in light of the fact that he knew from a young age that his professional future would be in the world of Cinema. Qeder replied that he chose Humanities rather than Film School because he wanted to experience other fields, to get to know the world better before making his first film.\n\nLater in the interview, Yair Qeder referred to the contemporary projects he is currently engaged in as part of the ongoing project “The Hebrews\" and the challenges he faces as a creator: \"After the 16 films of The Hebrews, centering on the characters of the Jewish, Hebrew and Yiddish writers and poets, I felt the need to take a step back - towards the characters who stand Behind our identity – Half of which are in the realm of Judaism, another half in the realm of modernity, and all shaped some significant part of us. Three new films are now in the making – a film about Baruch Spinoza, directed by David Ofek, focusing on boycotts and freedom of thought; a film about Karl Marx, directed by Benjamin Friedberg, about Marx's place in our contemporary reality, his particular return to our reality, and the Israeli activism inspired by him, through his life story; and a film I'm directing about Sigmund Freud that celebrates the centenary of the invention of the Ego, an invention that no one is exempt from in modern times. The issue of funding is always a challenge - many films fall by the wayside, and I would be happy to have resources for the creation of many more films. We have a wonderful past, and the Hebrews are an excellent way to celebrate it, dive into it and get to know it. The whole past is still ahead of us, to quote A. B. Yehoshua in the film ‘The Last Chapter of A.B. Yehoshua’ the latest installment in ‘The Hebrews'.\n\nAmong the alumni who tuned in to watch the webinar in real time:\n\nDr. Nava Michael-Tsabari, Founder and co-director of the Raya Strauss Center for Family Firm at Tel Aviv University’s Coller School of Management\n\nJustice Ela Meiras\n\nAvi Nudler, Entrepreneur\n\n...And many others.\n\nRead more about ‘The Hebrews’ here>\n\nThe Tel Aviv University Alumni Organization, Headed by Sigalit Ben Hayoun hosted hundreds of participants for a webinar with the Media woman, Author and Lecturer Sivan Rahav Meir, Alumna of TAU’s Faculty of Social Sciences and Coller School of Management, on New Media, Old Media, family and career.\n\nThe meeting was opened with greetings by Amos Elad, TAU Vice President of Public Affairs, Resource Development & Alumni Affairs, who said: \"Tel Aviv University sees its alumni as the driving force of the Israeli economy and the world economy. Indeed, only recently was Tel Aviv University ranked first outside the United States (and eighth in the whole world) in the number of alumni entrepreneurs who raised capital in 2021, according to the Pitchbook index. This is of course a source of great pride for us and proof that we are successfully meeting the goal we set ourselves - to be the largest exporters of leaders in the global economy, but most of all it is the result of our uncompromising investment In the TAU Alumni Organization, under the leadership of Sigalit Ben Hayoun, who made it her goal to cultivate the world changing community of our alumni and future alumni.\"\n\nSivan Rahav Meir, who began her studies at Tel Aviv University at the age of 16, is an alumna of TAU’s Faculty of Social Sciences and Coller School of Management. In her words, she referred to her professional development and a number of current issues that are on the agenda of the media in the era of the COVID19 pandemic:\n\n\"In the last two years, since the outbreak of the pandemic, we have all become heavy consumers of media through screens. Even those who were not addicted before 'lost their antibodies' and got hooked, because it was our only way to communicate with each other. Although there is still something called a journalist's certificate from the Government Press Office, But in the age of social networks every smart phone is equivalent to a journalist's license and everyone who owns a cell phone here is an expert, commentator, epidemiologist and even the Chief of Staff. We journalists follow your pages on the networks - That's where most of the content comes from, both light and serious.\"\n\n\"From the saying that was once thrown at us, 'You there in the Media!' In a sort of criticism as if we are too left-wing, or too right-wing - I want to point the finger back at you, the audience: 'You there in the Media!' Because you really are the media today. Your cell phone produces the content.\"\n\n\"Trust in the Media, according to the data of the Israel Democracy Institute, is only 33%. We are unable to put order in the mess, to give you meaning and context. It's not for nothing that the word chosen for the word of the year by the academy of Hebrew language is Tirlul (wackiness), it's just that everyone says it about each other.\"\n\n\"There is a lot more fake news because everything runs faster and without filtering, but this is part of the new game. By the time I get a photographer out from the News Desk to the field, you’ll already be broadcasting live. This makes the conversation superficial on the one hand, but on the other hand, you used to have to go to the library to know what city is the capital of some country and today a quick search on the internet is enough. The rules are changing, period, and the root of things is, as mentioned, that we are all journalists. And if we are all journalists - then we should start taking responsibility for it.\"\n\nAs for the rising violence on social networks, Sivan, who has often experienced attacks herself, said: \"Today a person has to go through a workshop on dealing with shaming, really a preparation course. This has a lot of consequences, everyone at some point in their life can go through shaming, in the class WhatsApp group or in front of the entire feed on Facebook. If we are all journalists, then we should be prepared for it. There were several waves of vaccine opponents who 'settled' on my page this year, recently 'The Shadow' published posts against me and this brought another wave. One should also welcome criticism, The question is what kind of and how much. The main thing is to build mental resilience, especially in young people who encounter this phenomenon. How do you protect yourself when five thousand people an hour write against you?\"\n\n\"One of the most important news this year, in my opinion, was the news report that this year's main domain is 'TikTok' and not Google, for the first time. This means that humanity is less and less engaged in searching for content on Google and more and more looking for Tiktok videos. This indicates something.\"\n\nAmong the alumni who tuned in to watch the webinar in real time:\n\nDr. Alon Nevet, Deputy Director General of Beilinson Hospital\n\nVared Oren, Foreign Affairs Director, Communications at the Standards Institution of Israel\n\nChaim Rafalowski, Disaster Management and EU Projects Coordinator at Magen David Adom\n\nDr. Guy Korland, CTO Of Incubations at the Redis Labs technology company\n\nYehuda Ayalon, Head of Cyber Security Unit at Meptagon Group\n\nAriel Rubashkin, CEO of AllMeD Solutions\n\nAnd many others...\n\nThe Tel Aviv University Alumni Organization, Headed by Sigalit Ben Hayoun, continues its series of meetings with inspiring alumni for its alumni community, and this time directed a spotlight on the Israeli tourism industry, one of the most sensitive sectors in the economy at the moment.\n\nFour alumni who are among the leaders of the Israeli tourism world participated in a panel that focused on the trends, challenges and opportunities at this time, especially in light of its relevance in recent days:\n\nAmir Hayek, President of the Israel Hotel Association and Chairman of TAMIR, the Packaging Recycling Corporation in Israel, Alumnus of TAU’s Coller School of Management and Faculty of Social Sciences\n\nAsaf Zamir, former Minister of Tourism and current Israeli Consul General in New York, Alumnus of TAU’s Buchmann Faculty of Law\n\nAnat Starik-Dahan, Deputy CEO of Israel Canada Hotels, Former Co-CEO of Tamares Hotels, Alumna of TAU’s Faculty of Humanities\n\nRoni Pivko, Chairman, President & CEO of the Club Hotel Group and Vice President of the Israel Hotel Association, Alumnus of TAU’s Faculty of Social Sciences and the Coller School of Management\n\nThe webinar’s host was a TAU alumna who knows the tourism industry well and has been covering it for years - Lee Abramovich, Keshet's N12 News Consumerism and tourism Journalist, Alumna of TAU’s Faculty of Social Sciences.\n\nAmong the things that came up in the webinar:\n\nAmir Hayek:\n\n\"In my opinion, a target of 10 million tourists should be set, and this target should be accompanied by infrastructure, attractions, and an airport. The tourism industry is a very economic industry and employs workers all over the country, especially in the periphery where mobility is high, where a receptionist can become a CEO of a hotel or even a hotel group. It's a fascinating and a happy industry. An industry related to foreign relations - the more tourists arrive; the more people will see that it's worth visiting here again. The industry is everything: it's the aviation field, the agents, the tour guides, the restaurants; and it's connected to many factors that make up the Israeli tourism industry.\"\n\nAnat Starik-Dahan:\n\n\"There is a process of moving to automation in our industry. You can book a room online, arrive at a hotel, check in, and then also open the door of the room using an app without going through the reception. This is just one of many examples of how this industry reinvents itself and adapts itself to today's world all the time.\"\n\nRoni Pivko:\n\n\"Today around the world, the work week is shortened from six to five and from five to four days a week and thus more people are going to go on vacations. The countries of the East and the countries of the former USSR have opened up and their people are also looking to tour and see the world, that was closed to them before, and therefore there are now more tourists than there are hotels. There is an urgent need to build many, many hotels. It is in the clear interest of investors and countries, therefore more and more hotels of all types will be built with the encouragement of governments while providing investment grants to entrepreneurs.”\n\nThe Tel Aviv University Alumni Organization, headed by Sigalit Ben Hayoun, continues its tradition of meetings with inspiring alumni, with a Webinar that dealt with the High-Tech world of tomorrow, titled ‘From Startup Nation to Scale up Nation’.\n\nFour alumni who \"did it\", each in their own field, participated:\n\nKobi Marenko, Co-Founder and CEO of Arbe Robotics, Alumnus of the TAU Faculty of Humanities\n\nYifat Oron, Incoming Senior Managing Director at Blackstone and Head of the Firm's Tel Aviv Office, Alumna of the Coller School of Management\n\nOmer Keilaf, CEO and Co-Founder of Innoviz Technologies, Alumnus of the TAU Faculty of Engineering and the Coller School of Management\n\nKarin Mayer Rubinstein, CEO & President of Israel Advanced Technology Industries (IATI), Alumna of the TAU Faculties of Social Sciences and Law and the Coller School of Management\n\nThe event was moderated by Inbal Orpaz, Researcher at the Lipkin Shachak program in the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), Business Strategy Consultant in the fields of innovation and startups, Speaker and Lecturer, Alumna of the TAU Faculties of the Arts, and Social Sciences and the Coller School of Management.\n\nA few quotes from the significant things said in the panel:\n\nKarin Mayer Rubinstein:\n\n\"COVID19 has created a paradigm shift with a significant change in organizational culture and ways of working. A dichotomous period of significant high-tech growth, accompanied by an intense struggle between companies for quality workforce, alongside layoffs; and a record-breaking year of capital raising alongside a decline in the number of transactions\".\n\nYifat Oron:\n\n\"Employees are very essential to the success and value of companies. Almost the only ones who are needed are the employees. Funds understand that if employees do not get a large enough share - they should increase the employees’ share of options. Those who may be harmed are the Angels who invested in the beginning. Nowadays, the solution to that is in ‘Secondary form’, in which they are bought out by investors who come in later stages. But the employees are most needed here- they are the whole story\".\n\nKobi Marenko:\n\n\"I think the Israeli High-Tech market should not be disturbed by the capital market and money. It should be disturbed by what is happening in Jaffa, by what happened in Bat Yam and by Umm al-Fahm. Israel has no government and the state has lost its ability to control what’s going on. Even if the Nasdaq drops 30% - there will be enough money for startups in Israel... In the coming years, the High-Tech industry will suffer from the political situation in Israel and the state we are in....”\n\n“This is the best time in the history of the world to be an entrepreneur. One can really influence people’s lives, and there are many good things that can be done. In the past, High-Tech revolved around gambling and less nice things, but nowadays the industry is really changing the world, and Israeli entrepreneurs are in almost every field that is essential for the existence of the world in the next generation\".\n\nOmer Keilaf:\n\n\"If there is one area that Israel can be proud of and should continue to utilize, it is its ability to create innovation and bring about achievements. That’s the image that has built its reputation for decades, but it can be used to rectify the way the country is viewed. We won’t be able to explain why we are the poor victims, because we are big and strong. But we can be the nation that produces innovation and we must continue developing this aspect and thus correct the way Israel is perceived from the outside\".\n\nTowards the end of the event, Inbal Orpaz asked the participants if anyone had anything to add. To this, Omar Keilf replied: \"Study at Tel Aviv University!\". Kobi Marenko quickly agreed and said \"Absolutely! Statistically - this is surely the right path to becomming an entrepreneur\".\n\nAmong the viewers who viewed the live broadcast of the Webinar, were Lior Ovsiovich, Junior Partner at FIMI Opportunity Funds; Paz Gilboa, Founder & CTO at p-EcoSystems; Gadi Peretz, CEO at RGB Total Strategy; Inon Beracha, CEO at PrimeSense, and many more.\n\nThe State of Israel currently has 81 embassies, 21 consulates and another 6 delegations / economic offices around the world. Ahead of the 73rd Independence Day celebrations of the State of Israel, the Tel Aviv University Alumni Organization, led by Sigalit Ben Hayoun, invited four of their leaders, all TAU Alumni, to a Webinar that addressed the unique challenges of Israeli ambassadors in the international arena, and especially during the COVID19 crisis.\n\nThe event was Participated by:\n\nYaffa Ben-Ari, Ambassador of Israel to Japan, Alumna of the Faculty of Social Sciences\n\nShani Cooper, Ambassador of Israel to Ghana, Liberia and Sierra-Leone, Alumna of the Faculties of Social Sciences and Humanities\n\nSandra Simovich, Consul General at the Israeli Consulate General in Munich, Alunba of the Buchmann Faculty of Law\n\nRan Peleg, Consul General, Head of the Israeli Consulate General to South West China, Chengdu, Alumnus of the Buchmann Faculty of Law and the Coller School of Management\n\nThe event was moderated by Prof. Hanna Lerner, Head of TAU’s School of Political Science, Government and International Affairs, Alumna of the Faculty of Humanities.\n\nYaffa Ben-Ari, Ambassador of Israel to Japan, said:\n\n\"Israel's branding in Japan was revived during the COVID19 crisis. Not only did the success of the vaccine operation give Israel a positive image in the Japanese media, but also the exposure of the Israeli passengers on ‘the corona ship’ in the early days of the crisis. The embassy's increased activity in creating content on social media - when most of the population has switched to Home Office - has also attracted a lot of attention in the past year.\n\nThe treatment we gave the Israeli tourists on the Corona ship, both during the quarantine on the ship and in the process of their release and transfer to Israel, was difficult and complex, especially at the beginning of the epidemic, when anxiety and lack of knowledge about the nature of the epidemic made it difficult to deal with various factors. The treatment of the rescue of many other Israelis from around the world in those first months showed how much the State of Israel, through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its emissaries, treats its citizens with extraordinary devotion.\n\nThe COVID19 crisis has created many challenges. Beyond the medical and economic challenge arose the need to adapt to a new reality of uncertainty, and to find creative solutions for the continued functioning and achievement of goals.\n\nThe worlds of culture and the arts, as well as the tourism industry, have suffered a severe blow here as well. Israeli diplomacy has shown rapid adaptability. In accordance with the new normal we have created new platforms. We recruited relevant content and designed it for public media: a short story by Etgar Keret titled\"Outside\" was produced as a short video in Japanese in a unique co- production with Japanese artists. This work was widely circulated, including screening on billboards simultaneously in the main square in Shibuya in Tokyo, in Times Square in New York City and on the building of Habima – the Israeli National Theater in Tel Aviv. The work has been translated into 20 languages\".\n\nRan Peleg, Consul General, Head of the Israeli Consulate General to South West China, stated:\n\n\"Precisely in China, where everything is open on the one hand, but closed to the world and with no flights on the other, I feel that the diplomat's role returns to the traditional definition of representation on the ground, which bridges and connects Israeli factors – commercial and others – towards cooperation with the Chinese. This is through personal, unmediated contact with decision-makers, things that cannot be produced via a Zoom. When COVID19 broke out in China, only the Foreign Ministry staff at the consulate remained, with great uncertainty and in a somewhat apocalyptic atmosphere. The task was, first and foremost, to ensure the safe evacuations of Israelis who were here, in addition to conveying and reflecting the reality in China, in a credible manner. Today, Corona virus is hardly evident in China, and the random cases which are diagnosed are quarantined and taken care of well enough that a 2nd wave has not occurred here”.\n\nShani Cooper, Ambassador of Israel to Ghana, Liberia and Sierra-Leone, said:\n\n\"Malaria is more present here than COVID19. I admit that I asked my daughters to try not to get injured during this period... COVID19 arrived here late, and although the testing rate in Africa is lower than the World Health Organization’s requirements, a total of 4.5 million people got infected with COVID19, which constitutes about 3% of the total infections among the world population. In this context, it can be said that Africa was lucky.\"\n\nSandra Simovich, Consul General in Munich, commented on the role of the diplomat in this era:\n\n\"In the short term, Diplomats nowadays have ways of producing more speaker platforms today, digitally. But the joy in meeting face to face again is present, and we weren’t meant to create virtual diplomacy. Chemistry and interpersonal interaction are very important to diplomacy, and there is no substitute for that\".\n\nAmong the alumni who watched the Webinar live, in real time:\n\nEhud Eitam, Head of an Israeli Delegation abroad at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, former Israeli Ambassador to Turkey and Costa Rica; Adva Rogalin, CEO at Kibbutz Ga'ash Commercial Properties; Dr. Alon Nevet, Deputy Director of the Hillel Yaffe Medical Center; Irit Savion Waidergorn, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Training Department, and many others.\n\nAs part of its annual tradition, the Tel Aviv University Alumni Organization, led by Sigalit Ben Hayoun, celebrated International Women's Day in a festive Webinar with inspiring and world-changing alumnae.\n\nThe online event was opened by Prof. Ilana Eli, Gender Equality Adviser to the President of Tel Aviv University, who revealed some numbers: half of all Israeli university students are women, but they make up only 20 percent in the full professor rank.\n\nThe panel was moderated by Lee Abramovich, Consumer & Tourism correspondent at the Channel 12 news company, Alumna of the TAU Faculty of Social Sciences, and was participated by:\n\nDr. Sharon Shacham, Founder and President of Karyopharm Therapeutics, Alumna of the TAU Faculties of Exact Sciences, Life Sciences and the Coller School of Management\n\nAdv. Shulamit Geri, General Director of the Bank of Israel, Alumna of the Buchmann Faculty of Law\n\nTzipi Pines, Theatre Director & Producer, Director and Artistic Director of Beit Lisin Theater by Baruch Ivcher, Alumna of of the TAU Faculty of the Arts\n\nLee Abramovich arrived to TAU directly from the kibbutz and felt that she had reached the pinnacle of her ambitions: \"Many articles and research I did in the beginning of my career were based on the inspiration I received from my studies in the School of Psychology and the Department of Communication - I have acquired tools at TAU that serve me to this day\".\n\nTzipi Pines said that her parents, both Holocaust survivors, designated her to be a teacher \"because there are a lot of vacations\", and only when her son Guy was four years old did she begin her studies at TAU. \"I wanted to study theater but I was told it was not a profession, it was a way of life... so I took classes from other departments as well. I forgot about home and was only busy with studies\".\n\nThe other speakers asked Tzipi how does she react when she is said to be a strong woman. \"For me it was a matter of development, I had no other dream except being in the theater. I was not born here and Hebrew was not my mother tongue, things happened over time. Being strong is not a terrible thing, no need to be ashamed of it\".\n\nShulamit Geri revealed that she served in the IDF in the military band, and also worked as a model: “I grew up in a small moshav in the Upper Galilee, and I had a dream of doing justice and becoming a lawyer. TAU has summoned new challenges into my life, and my law studies have provided me with analytical tools, which I use to this day.\n\nFor 17 years I worked at the Weizmann Institute, and for the last 8 years at the institute I served as the institute's director general and vice president of administration and finance. Then, I ran for the position of General Director of the Bank of Israel and to my delight, I was chosen\".\n\nSharon Shacham shared that during her nine years of chemistry at TAU she gave birth to her two children, and so she did not get the full ‘sunbathing on the campus grass’ experience. \"The study environment has given me the most important tool – knowing how to think. How do you approach a problem, define it and present a solution? I pass that on to my employees today\".\n\nIn addition, she noted that \"in the United States, people are organized according to university alumni organizations, and it is very difficult to establish a company in the United States, and especially in Boston, when I am Sharon from Raanana, with no ties to any of these cliques. I was lucky that my husband is from this world, in the John Hopkins community and other places as well, and that is exactly why I am so happy that the Tel Aviv University Alumni Organization was established and creates this type of network for us in Israel as well. I hope it will achieve great things\".\n\nThey all agreed that female management differs from male management in a number of parameters - from loyalty to the workplace to listening methods; That the last year has been terrible and that we have learned a lot of things about ourselves as women.\n\nTheir tip: \"It is important to dream because dreams create reality, dreams strengthen and give power. Raise the bar time and time again.\"\n\nAmong the alumni and alumnae who watched the live event in real time:\n\nJudge Daniela Cherizli; Judge Varda ben Shahar; Adva Rogalin, CEO at Kibbutz Ga'ash Commercial Properties; Rivka Lazovsky, former Global Chairwoman of WIZO; Amir Abramovich, Group CEO at Plazit-Polygal, Dganit Palti, Former CFO at EL AL Israel Airlines,and many others\n\nIn the run-up to the inauguration of the incoming US president Joe Biden, and during the hours the congress decided on former President Trump's 2nd impeachment, the TAU Alumni Organization, Headed by Sigalit Ben Hayoun, held a previously planned webinar, which dealt with the dramatic results of the US presidential, senate and congressional elections, and their consequences, both globally and locally for Israel.\n\nThe webinar was participated by inspiring TAU Alumni who chose academia as a way of life and became Tel Aviv University faculty after graduating:\n\nDr. Udi Sommer, Head of the Center for the Study of the United States at TAU with the Fulbright Program, Alumnus of the TAU School of Psychological Sciences\n\nProf. Miriam (Miri) Shefer Mossensohn, Head of the Zvi Yazetz School of Historical Studies, Alumna of the Zvi Yavetz School of Historical Studies\n\nDr. Liora Hendelman-Baavur, Director of the Alliance Center for Iranian Studies at TAU, Alumna of the TAU Faculties of Social Sciences and Humanities.\n\nThe event was moderated by two prominent media people and TAU Alumni, who deal with current events and what is happening in the United States on a daily basis:\n\nTal Schneider, Diplomatic & Political correspondent, Zman Israel by The Times of Israel, Alumna of TAU's Buchmann Faculty of Law\n\nUri Pasovsky, Senior commentator, Globes, Alumnus of the Zvi Yavetz School of Historical Studies and the Shirley and Leslie Porter School of Cultural Studies in the TAU Faculty of Humanities, and the Coller School of Management\n\nThe panel discussed complex and major questions:\n\nHow will America recover from the storming of the United States Capitol that occured this past weekend?\n\nWhat can this week's events teach about the state of democracy in the United States, and the democratic rift around the world?\n\nWill Biden be able to bridge the gaps in American society?\n\nWhat are the consequences of violating the freedom of expression? And what are the limits of freedom of expression?\n\nHow will the end of Trump's tenure and the insane damage to his status affect US-Israel relations?\n\nWhat does Iran think?\n\nAnd are these historical times?\n\nProf. Miri Shefer Mossensohn:\n\n\"Leaders in the Middle East, led by Erdogan, are cynically saying to the United States today, 'Told you so': the image you radiated to the outside world as the guardian of democracy – Now even you can't tell us how to behave. Similar Hand-rubbing is taking place in Moscow and Tehran.\n\nAs a historian, I can say that when there is a sense of chaos and loss of compass, people do things they would not do in other situations. We have seen examples of this throughout history, when pandemics (such as COVID-19) have brought about dramatic changes.\"\n\nDr. Liora Hendelman-Baavur:\n\n\"From the point of view of Iran and other Middle Eastern countries, the US administration, which has been preaching morality on human rights issues for years, is at a low point when its own treatment of American citizens is revealed (like the George Floyd scandal). It seems that Iran's general feeling following the US election results is relief. Along with anti-American statements to which we are already accustomed, there is a keen anticipation for the future, especially for a removal of the sanctions Iran faced since Trump's withdrawal of the \"Iran Nuclear Deal\" in 2018.\n\nIran is expected to hold presidential elections in the summer of 2021 and there is great pressure to get Washington to lift the sanctions, or at least some of them, by then.\n\nBeyond that, there is a global trend where the balance of power is shifting, and the zeitgeist is calling for “strong” leaders of a certain kind. Biden is a politician with many years of experience in Congress, and there are many expectations of him. Many see him as a kind of knight on a white horse who will bring about a kind of world correction after 4 years of Trump.\"\n\nDr. Udi Sommer:\n\n\"If Trump is Impeached, he will be the first president in American history who'll be Impeached twice.\n\nThe ultimate criterion for democracy is the peaceful transfer of power. The idea that a party that lost an election peacefully transfers the reins to a winning party is a cornerstone of any democratic system. The violent incidents on Capitol Hill last week undermine these foundations.\n\nIn addition, one of the basic criteria in the American Constitution is the principle of separation of powers aimed at preventing the concentration of excessive power and the abuse of that power. The fact that the head of the executive branch has led to the cessation of a fundamental constitutional procedure that is at the core of the activity of the legislature, and violently, also undermines this fundamental principle.\n\nAnd yet, 74.2 million voters voted for Trump. A president whose many messages throughout his tenure have been in a similar spirit. And no less, many of the Republican politicians to this moment are in no hurry to distance themselves from Trump.\n\nOne of COVID-19's most notable influences on American politics stems from the unprecedented turnout in envelopes. It made possible, despite the difficult circumstances of a global pandemic, for an unprecedented number of voters to vote. Beyond that, many of those voters were Democrats. And that’s also what gave a lot of the dramatic garnet of Election Day and the days that followed, when the votes counted from the envelopes were from urban areas that are mostly Democratic strongholds.\n\nThe Abraham Accords are a paradigm shift in Middle Eastern reality. A change in light of American foreign policy in the Middle East will need to be updated. First, in contrast to the 1990s and the bilateral reality advocated by the US State Department at the time, it is a multilateral reality that affects the system of regional alliances, axes of power, and ways of dealing with Iran.\n\nSecond, the Palestinians, whose perception was that until there was no progress with them there would be no progress with any other factor in the Middle East, are no longer in the same status. Their status has changed radically from the moment the trend was established, according to which Israel and other regional factors are getting closer without the precondition of progress towards an agreement with the Palestinians.\"\n\nAmong the hundreds of Alumni who viewed the webinar in real time:\n\nMichael Kenny, Owner & CEO of Eastronics LTD\n\nEran Elizur, CEO of IKOMED Technologies Inc\n\nJustice Daniela Shirizli\n\nZeev Kirschenbaum, President and CEO of ACS Motion Control LTD\n\nGideon Reis, CEO of Pavilion-Spark\n\nJerry Mandel, Managing Director of Galil Capital Finance\n\nFormer TAU President Prof. Joseph Klafter and his wife Pirchiya\n\nand many more.\n\nThe Tel Aviv University Alumni Organization, headed by Sigalit Ben Hayoun, is currently celebrating its fifth anniversary and continues the tradition of meetings with inspiring alumni who has \"made it\". In an active community of over 85,000 alumni, inspiring people can be found from almost every field of research, activity and influence, but this meeting was a particularly delicious and surprising.\n\nThe organization invited the TAU Alumni community to a culinary-zoom-experiential event with four alumni, all well-known in the field of culinary:\n\nYuval Ben Neriah, chef and owner of the Taizu Group, who studied at the TAU Faculty of Humanities\n\nDushi (Andrea) Leitersdorf, Owner of House of Dallal, alumna of the TAU Faculties of Humanities and Social Sciences\n\nAsaf Abir, author of \"Not Another Cookbook\" which deals with the science and art of the perfect bite\n\nDr. Yasmine Meroz, Principal Investigator of the Meroz Lab of Growing Systems & Plant Behaviour at the TAU School of Plant Sciences and Food Security, alumna of the TAU Faculty of Exact Sciences.\n\nAsaf, a man of words, skipped between the three panelists lightly as he navigated the conversation between campus memories, flavors, boxes and deliveries.\n\nYuval Ben Neriah revealed that both his parents are both Medical doctors who are TAU Alumni as well. \"My parents agreed that I would become a chef, but insisted that I should first get a degree, which was very difficult. I was always behind, and to this day I have not completed my degree.\"\n\nDushi, on the other hand, admitted: \"I’m a nerd and always was one. I skipped the big post-military service trip around the world, enrolled in TAU and studied through 12 years and 4 degrees.\"\n\nYasmine, on the other hand, chose an academic career, and with a background in physics, she currently researches plant behavior and communication between plants, using methods from the world of physics.\n\nDushi and Yuval agreed on much of COVID’s effect on restaurants and on where the industry is headed. They admitted that a different and new experience had developed, of consuming boxed takeaways. \"The new takeaway allows us to preserve both our manpower, our teams, and also maintain our reputation,\" they said.\n\nAsaf asked the restaurateurs ‘Will anything change after it's all over? Did the pandemic teach people to understand the role of restaurants?\n\nYuval: \"Two genres will stay strong - fine dining at one end, and street food at the other end. People who started cooking at home now understand the cost of fish and appreciate the high prices better.\"\n\nDushi: \"COVID has brought with it new emphases, and if you are optimistic enough, alert enough, you can turn lemons not only into lemonade but also caipirinha: To meet the challenge, get the best out of the situation, while practicing creativity, responsibility and efficiency.\"\n\n\"Just like trees,\" Yasmine mentioned, \"if they feel threatened by strong winds they stop growing high and instead grow in width, allowing them to become stronger and survive. In general, plants excel at adapting to harsh and unpredictable environments, and know how to survive periods of drought, pandemics and fires. They are doing something right, and we still have what to learn from them”. By the way, she admitted that the COVID era taught her to bake homemade bread, and if that doesn't work, you can always order from Dallal.\n\nDuring the second part of the event, Yuval Ben Neriah took over for a practical “Cook-Along” workshop for preparing the \"Chef's Dish\" - filet of Sparus aurata or Sea Bass with tomato curry and yogurt.\n\nAmong the alumni who tuned in to watch the live webinar:\n\nAdi Gura, Partner at the Braverman Gallery, Tedy Kratenstein, Senior Executive at Dell Technologies, Michael Levkovitch, Owner and CEO of Tea and Lemon Ltd., Amir Fishler, CEO at Netivot Yetzira Real Estate, Mashav Balsam, Co-Founder & COO at TechedUp, Sharona Sagi, VP Product at Exlibris, Amir Wagner, Co-Founder and CEO of Respect Branding, and more.\n\nThe Tel Aviv University Alumni Organization, led by Sigalit Ben Hayoun, continues its tradition of meetings with inspiring alumni, and chose to shine the spotlight expected changes to everyday life in the big city, caused or enhanced by the COVID pandemic. The date was set, of course, on the World Urbanism Day, celebrated across the globe on November 8th.\n\nThree renowned experts met for a joined zoom Webinar, to discuss burning issues that are disrupting city life and changing the way we live.\n\nThe Panelists were:\n\nUdi Carmeli, Tel Aviv-Yafo City Engineer, Alumnus of the Azrieli School of Architecture, TAU Faculty of the Arts\n\nYaara Gooner, Head of Design at the London Real Estate Company Labtech, Alumna of the Azrieli School of Architecture, TAU Faculty of the Arts\n\nAvishay Kimeldorf, VP of Planning and Chief Architect at Shikun & Binui Real Estate, currently a student in the Executive MBA program of the TAU Coller School of Management\n\nThe panel was moderated by Prof. Tali Hatuka, founder and head of the Laboratory for Contemporary Urban Design in the TAU Department of Geography and the Human Environment.\n\nTo Hatuka's question about the significance of COVID regarding urban planning, the three answered in detail:\n\nUdi Carmeli: \"The crisis will make a difference, the question is how deep it is going to be, for how long and what to focus on. The typology will change. The city, as a concept of the human existence of all the desires of the human race, will not disappear for those who are looking for it. The crisis enhances both the good and bad sides of urbanism. Its too early to judge and make planning assumptions based on newspaper headlines. We plan 10-20 years ahead, but during the COVID pandemic we took tactical urbanity - following the outbreak of COVID we added 12 new pedestrian zones, small gardens and more bike paths, which would have taken us much more time without COVID.\"\n\nAvishay Kimeldorf admits \"today there is a need for agility and flexibility in planning, the small garden next to the house became a significant activity space for families, the high-rise building has become a safe space, the demand for apartments with balconies and gardens and apartments with a study has increased. Its about knowing what the public wants and needs right now.\" He also stressed \"that flexibility should come from both the developers and the approving bodies, and together we must find the right solutions. The concept of community has also been given a twist, and along with it planning is changing in a more participatory and enabling direction.\"\n\nYaara Gooner, from London: \"In London as well, there’s a sense of confusion and we are required to adopt flexibility and design creative and quick solutions for adapting our spaces to the new situation.\n\nLondon is an international commercial city, and proximity to the source of livelihood has become a more important planning factor than ever.\n\nCampuses based on pure mix of uses, enabling a full ecosystem, are now gaining momentum. A resident of the compound can live, work, purchase, eat and spend time in the same compound without having to leave it.\n\nThe complexes are not closed, but rather are connected with a number of public spaces and access roads to the city, which encourage pedestrians to walk through the campus and enjoy it too and not just the locals.\"\n\nThe discussion during the second half of the discourse was directed by Prof. Tali Hatuka to the future - what will the city look like following changes such as smart transportation and autonomous vehicles.\n\nUdi Carmeli: \"There is no one design solution that works for everyone everywhere. Urban architecture is closely linked to local character and tailor-made for it. Chemistry between people will continue to drive planning forward and leave people in the city, while others will want the opposite. I hope we won’t just live in bubbles. I want to continue to go out into the street and be surprised time and time again. The city has not yet exhausted itself in general, and especially in Israel, which is still considered a country in growth stages. The great educational challenge is the transition to the use of public or cooperative transportation in the future.\"\n\nAvishay Kimeldorf: \"There are a few trends that can currently be identified. I don’t think there’s a trend of leaving the city and returning to the village. This is a marginal phenomenon, and the apparent trend is less about development of agricultural lands into building of mega-neighborhoods outside the city, and more about shifting to work complexes within the cities, which will encourage urban renewal of older areas. In the complex projects, developers will have to adapt to the municipal strategy and develop the complex according to it.\n\nWe will see more use of entrepreneurial resources for social purposes, and more use of public land for economic enterprise purposes. There will be a much more substantial treatment of the soft issues that the developer did not touch on in the past, such as the participation of the public and the participation of diverse stakeholders as well as the innovation that trickles into the projects. We also produce flexibility in plans in agreement with municipal bodies. There are more collaborations with the city and there is feedback, where both sides can bring about much better solutions together. The real Real Estate map is the map of public transportation, cooperative transportation and mass transportation, as future centers will be built around them, and this is where the Real Estate world is headed.\n\nYaara Gooner: \"The user experience in the office spaces will change, the population density in spaces will decrease, emphasis will be placed on fresh air, the element of one desk for each employee is no longer relevant, but rather the multiplicity of interaction spaces and strengthening interpersonal connections which can’t be created through the virtual world.\n\nEach new building’s plan will have to meet a large number of strict standards, which will make it possible to brand the building on the market with a Green Building certificate. Bicycles, showers and lockers are now being planned instead of car parking spaces.\"\n\nAmong the viewers, all TAU Alumni:\n\nAshdod City Engineer Ram Aharoni, Or Yehuda Municipality City Architect Ziv Gadon, Omer Wolf - Senior City Planner in the Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality, Herzl Arviv - Board Member of the Israeli Export Institute, and many others.\n\nThe people behind the hit series \"Tehran\" met TAU Alumni from all over the world for a Zoom meeting\n\nThe TAU Alumni Organization, headed by Sigalit Ben Hayoun, continues it’s tradition of meetings with inspiring alumni, even during the COVID era. Hundreds of alumni from all over the world gathered last week to hear the alumni who created the acclaimed masterpiece series, the Israeli spy drama \"Tehran\".\n\nAt the center of the discourse, moderated by Dr. Liora Hendelman-Baavur - Director of the TAU Alliance Center for Iranian Studies and alumna of the TAU Faculties of Humanities and Social Sciences, were Omri Shenhar - Screenwriter and Co-Creator of \"Tehran\", alumnus of TAU’s Steve Tisch School of Film and Television, and Moshe Zonder - Creator and Head Writer of \"Tehran\", who studied as well at TAU’s Steve Tisch School of Film and Television.\n\nThe event started with greetings by Prof. Eran Neuman, Dean of TAU’s Yolanda and David Katz Faculty of the Arts, who greeted the attendees in three languages, promised not to spoil for those who had not yet seen ‘Tehran’, complimented the series' star Niv Sultan, and emphasized that the story is not about Nuclear War but the personal stories depicted in the series.\n\nOmri and Moshe are not of the same generation, and Moshe the senior among them, was the first to answer about his experience studying at TAU: \"The first year in TAU’s film department was one of the most significant years in my life, for example meeting the late Emil Knebel (Milek) as teacher of Film Direction\". “The person who introduced Omri and me was the Co-Creator and producer of Tehran, Dana Eden”.\n\nWhen asked by Dr. Hendelman-Baavur what about creating the series did the two like particularly, Omri said: \"Who is the good guy and who is the bad guy? Which one do you identify with more - with your side or with the opponent’s?\". Moshe: \"I loved writing the character of Faraz Kamali\". Omri added: \"We discover Tehran through Tamar’s eyes, and it was special to do it through the eyes of a modern woman\".\n\nMoshe: \"It was a challenge not to make mistakes based on ignorance or arrogance in presenting the Iranian figures, which led to a two-year research that preceded the writing process\". Omri: \"We met people who know Iran from the inside. You find these amazing stories, the ones that never reach the media. We brought that to the screen.\"\n\nMoshe stated: \" Responses to the series are coming from all over the world, but the most exciting, to me, came from second generation Jewish families who immigrated to Israel from Iran. Women and men aged 30-40, who came as children or were born in Israel and grew up ashamed of their parents’ Persian accent and their family heritage. Watching the series made them proud of their parents. I understand what they are talking about. I went through a similar process with my own family heritage\".\n\nOmri: \"I was afraid that people might watch the series based on prejudice, but there were none. We get compliments, from Iran, for showing a different, less threatening side of the country, and that people there live their lives\". Moshe added that \"The series deals with questions of identity, nationality, immigration, the possibility of breaking away from family roots and the price of such choices. Everyone in the world belongs to a tribe, that feeds us a narrative since we are little children. Thanks to Apple TV Plus’ streaming platforms, viewers from all around the world can watch the series and everyone may relate to it, no matter what nationality or religion they belong to\".\n\nTo curious attendee’s questions, they replied: \"We have many ideas for a second season\", but did not share more.\n\nMoshe’s advice for the future generation of creators: \"Write only about what interests you and excites you. Don’t try to aim at anyone's taste, and don’t despair if your scripts are rejected. The successful TV series ‘Fauda’ was initially rejected, as was ‘Tehran’. And most importantly - remember that writing is rewriting, over and over again\". Omri added about building a career: \"Even if you are involved in something else, keep writing. Until you succeed. It's not like in the movies, it's hard work.\"\n\nAmong the webinar’s attendees: Founder of Medivisor (a company that provides patients with medical information) Tal Givoly, CEO of DFM Dror Flomin (Flumin), Group CEO of Allium Medical Solutions Ariel Rubashkin and many more.\n\nHead of the TAU Alumni Organization, Sigalit Ben Hayoun, continues the organization's tradition of online events in a wide range of subjects with inspiring TAU alumni, and this time chose to put the issue of our food and beverages in the post-COVID era on the table.\n\nTitled \"Close to the Plate\", five leading TAU alumni who deal with the world of food at all levels in their daily life - solutions to food shortages in the world or in the country, development of new foods and online shopping were just some of the topics discussed.\n\nThe event was opened by Amos Elad, TAU Vice President of Public Affairs, Resource Development & Alumni Affairs. He spoke about the unemployment and distress students are experiencing during the COVID era, and called on TAU alumni to join the fundraising effort for scholarships to help TAU students.\n\nParticipated:\n\nEyal Shohat, CEO of Sodastream International, Alumnus of the Buchmann Faculty of Law and the Coller School of Management, including accounting studies at Tel Aviv University\n\nGuy Rosen, Vice Chairman at Tnuva and Chairman of Millennium Food Tech, Alumnus of the Buchmann Faculty of Law\n\nKeren Mimran, Entrepreneur, Founder, VP Business Development & Marketing at Edete Precision Technologies for Agriculture, Alumna of TAU's David and Yolanta Katz Faculty of the Arts\n\nAdv. Galia Sagy Gazit, Executive Director of the Association of Food Industries, Manufacturers' Association of Israel, Alumna of the TAU Faculty of Social Sciences\n\nThe event was moderated by Netally Binshtock, editor of Calcalist's advertising and marketing section, Alumna of the TAU Faculties of Humanities and Social Sciences\n\nEyal Shohat, CEO of Sodastream, shared how the COVID era has accelerated the company's online processes and said: “Consumers have shut themselves in their homes and avoided going out to grocery stores, and we have experienced a jump of hundreds of percent in online purchases of Sodastream devices.\n\nI guess the trend will moderate, but won't disappear. Online activities have high variable costs such as collection, packaging, shipping and more, but the consumer definitely indicates that it is his favorite channel during such periods.\"\n\nEyal revealed the brilliant idea of ​​converting Sodastream technology in favor of manufacturing respirators - \"It all started with a phone call I received from a senior official at Ein Kerem Hospital – Hadassah Medical Center, with a request that we try to produce high flow oxygen machines. Turns out there aren't many of those around the world, and of all things – our Soda machines that mix CO2 with water are suitable for it. Against the background of the apocalyptic prophecies of thousands of people needing respirators, we did not think twice and ran ahead to develop the device. We have a working device that is in clinical trials at Hadassah, which also receives backing from the Ministry of Health. We will wait for the results and make decisions.\"\n\nGuy Rosen, Vice Chairman at Tnuva and Chairman of Millennium Food Tech, said: \"The main lesson from the COVID era is that the State of Israel must cultivate and maintain an independent and strong food industry, and strong agriculture to ensure food security for its citizens even in times of crisis.\"\n\nHe also noted: \"COVID has not revolutionized the world of food, but it has certainly accelerated strong trends like switching to healthier foods and plant-based protein substitutes.\"\n\nKeren Mimran, Entrepreneur, Founder, VP Business Development & Marketing at Edete Precision Technologies for Agriculture, spoke about future foods from the Research & Development aspect, and explained about artificial pollination experiments: \"The pollination is basically the sex and fertilization process of plants. Our experiments from the last four years show good results of increasing crop yields without dependency on the weather. This is an area that deals with ensuring the supply of food and reducing the risks of food shortages.\"\n\nAdv. Galia Sagy Gazit, Executive Director of the Association of Food Industries, Manufacturers' Association of Israel, shed light on the interrelationship between purchasing Israeli food products and imported products: “The COVID crisis has reinforced the importance of a strong and independent food industry, which is economically and socially resilient. We can only rely on ourselves, while dealing with demand and supplies\". She also referred to the Ministry of Health's labeling reform: \"Technological innovation will help food manufacturers make food healthier. Companies have invested a lot of resources in developing new and healthier products and share the interest in the reform's success.\"\n\nEveryone agreed that the direct relationship between producers and customers, which stood out and gained momentum during the COVID era, is an issue that challenges the food industry. Questions like what to do with the information we get from online clients or how to maximize everything are still open, and there is still a long way to go.\n\nThe Tel Aviv University Alumni Organization, headed by Sigalit Ben Hayoun, took a literal Time-Out and invited its alumni to an online Webinar dedicated to the world of Sports.\n\nTitled ‘Time Out - Where is the world of sports headed?’ a selected group of TAU alumni spoke, each from their own point of view, about the hot issues in the post-COVID-19 sports world and the implications for the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nThe panelists included representatives from the fields of Refereeing, Tourism, Media and Academia:\n\nRonit Tirosh, current chairperson of the Israeli Football Referees Association, alumna of the TAU Faculty of Humanities, and former Director General of the Israeli Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports\n\nYoav Bruck, owner of Issta Sport, alumnus of the Coller School of Management and a former Swimmer. Israeli champion in swimming, who represented Israel in three Olympics (1992, 1996 & 2000)\n\nTalia Salant, Broadcast Journalist at the israeli sports channel, alumna of the Buchmann Faculty of Law\n\nProf. Mickey Sheinowitz, Director of TAU’s Sylvan Adams Sports Institute, alumnus of the Faculty of Medicine\n\nUriel Daskel, who moderated the panel, Sport Business Chief Editor at Calcalist, Founder and Podcaster at Kolyompod, and former Lecturer at TAU’s Department of Communication\n\nAt the beginning of the conversation, Daskel raised the hot issue of the day’s news headlines - the footballers and minors affair, and asked: Where does football stand as a transmitter of educational messages?\n\nRonit Tirosh was the first to speak, saying: \"Both sides should be examined, and I expect that to be the case. Celebrities have a tremendous influence on teenagers. They need to know that they are role models, and they should behave as if they are under a looking glass. On the other hand, parents and teachers need to teach teenagers to set boundaries, and not to be easily tempted.”\n\nTalia Salant, who has already expressed her opinion in a post that drew thousands of comments on Social Networks, said: \"I felt that in an event of this kind, women's voices are heard less. Gender equality is weakened, and that is a message I want to convey”. Salant revealed that she started an internship at the Yigal Arnon & Co. Law Firm just when the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, and shared what she went through during the COVID-19 crisis: “The Sports Channel went through a crazy period. It felt like the sky were falling, and I admit that I sided with the pessimistic warnings, and thought that it was going to be a while until Sports events returned. The crowds must return to the benches, yesterday”.\n\nIn a sharp transition to the 2021 Tokyo Olympics, Ronit Tirosh said she was not sure that countries would agree to host the Olympics, take risks and commit to huge investments if a 2nd wave of COVID-19 will arrive. In her opinion, countries that already have sports facilities may have to be chosen, and everything will be done much more modestly.\n\nWhile talking about philanthropy in sports, everyone agreed that there is going to be less money: Tirosh shared that the big concern is that there is a lot of black money as a conduit for money laundering, which the sports world does not want to be involved with. \"The global economic crisis affects philanthropists who have reduced or stopped their support, and it scares me that the industries that will be harmed first are the unpopular ones, or the women’s sports.\"\n\nProf. Mickey Sheinowitz thinks philanthropy will continue, but there will be less money. He also outlined a timeline and said that decisions regarding the Olympics will be made in the winter. \"If there is still COVID-19 in the winter the games may be canceled.\"\n\nEveryone agreed that we would experience a saner and more modest world of player salary - there was a pay bubble for players and it is no more, and there is also the fear that Olympic players will have to find additional sources of income because sponsored grants will not suffice. Everyone supported the step taken by Alona Barkat, because if there is no money in your pockets, it is impossible to maintain such a high salary for players.\n\nAt the same question stage, the participants were asked what would they like to happen to sports the day after the COVID-19 crisis ends?\n\nRonit - \"We are all equal and socially fragile. I would like to see more equality of opportunity for those who have been unjustly not expressed, such as women and youth.\"\n\nTalia - \"I want every sports supporter to continue buying subscriptions or tickets. Don’t stop.\"\n\nMickey - \"Sports activities, competitions or games should continue. not only have we lost muscle mass, we have also eaten more and gained fat mass. It will take some time but we have to go back to what we were, otherwise sports injuries will increase.\"\n\nThe Tel Aviv University alumni organization, headed by Sigalit Ben Hayoun, continues its tradition of meetings with inspiring alumni, which are currently conducted as online webinars. During an event titled “Many Ways to Exit”, which took place on 25 May 2020, three leading alumni from the High-Tech world, spoke openly about the many ways to exit at this time: Liad Agmon, Tzipi Ozer-Armon and Omer Keilaf.\n\nThe TAU alumni community from all over the world, as well as TAU donors and friends, were invited to the meeting, and even though the event took place during the American Memorial Day, the response was huge, with hundreds of people watching the event during the peak moments.\n\nThe event was opened by Amos Elad, TAU Vice President for Public Affairs , Resource Development & Alumni Affairs.\n\nIt was interesting to see what the background chosen by each participant. While Ozer-Armon and Keilaf chose professional backgrounds that reflected their companies, Agmon (who’s little daughter stopped by in the middle of the event and demanded a kiss) chose a soothing background of lakes and landscapes rather than a Big Mac.\n\nLiad Agmon - Entrepreneur, CEO and Founder of the Israeli Start-Up Dynamic Yield, alumnus of the Faculty of Exact Sciences and the Steve Tisch School of Film and Television at the Faculty of The Arts said:\n\n\"It's too early to say how the business world will change. the only certain thing is the acceleration of the digital realm, and specifically - the ability to digitally do things remotely: work meetings, medical diagnoses, shopping and even bureaucracy. A week ago, I signed a document in the presence of a notary… only the notary was in NYC, I was in Tel Aviv and the medium was Facetime. Two months ago, the chances of the New York State approving it were nil.\"\n\nReferring to the home office phenomenon, he said:\" I believe most people enjoy going to the office. Work is also a social event, not just a manufacturing event. On a daily basis, I have brief corridor conversations with colleagues, exchanging spontaneous information with employees. I do not see a situation where I make a random 3 minute zoom call to an employee just to ask her how her children are doing and how was their weekend trip. After COVID-19, we will continue to allow work from home, but we will formulate a plan for the right long-term balance. \"\n\nTzipi Ozer-Armon - CEO at Lumenis, alumna of the Faculty of Social Sciences and the Coller School of Management, said:\n\n“30% of our work is with China, where COVID-19 broke out, and we realized very early on that there would be a crisis. We spent the first quarter of 2020 preparing for the crisis. The dictatorship in chine enforced strict obedience which allowed work to go on comfortably"
