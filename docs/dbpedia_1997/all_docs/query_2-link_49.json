        "text": "üö® Caution! Extremely Politically Correct Context üö® My previous post was taken down after gaining thousands of views, dozens of shares, and numerous comments within hours. What was it that LinkedIn found so unsettling? It was real, unfiltered images from the recent events in Israel. You understand that if even the images were hard to witness on your screens, the reality on the ground is far worse. You realize that what was difficult to watch through a screen can also reach your doorstep - anywhere in the world, in any home, for every family and every individual, regardless of religion or citizenship. So, you may wonder why share these harsh realities here on LinkedIn? The answer is simple: LinkedIn is a professional networking platform, and those responsible for the terrible harm to civilians had a well-organized plan. They had objectives, received funding, and it was simply business - a bloody one. üíºüíî Unlike Facebook, Instagram, or TikTok, LinkedIn is a network for adults, shielding children from horror. Except for the kidnapped Israeli children in Gaza, who are enduring the indescribable right now. üë∂üíî War impacts all aspects of life, and it's crucial not to silence what's happening in Israel. Never Again. üåé‚úä I hope this time I've been politically correct enough for LinkedIn. #Hamasisisis #StandWithIsrael #FreeOurKids #IsraelPalestineConflict\n\nStand with Israel üáÆüá± Dear Friends & Colleagues. I do not use this platform for non-professional business related posts. But the circumstances are exceptional and as many of you expressed concern (and this is much appreciated) I will share a few words: I want to share some important facts about the current situation in Israel, which is affecting the lives of many innocent civilians. As of the most recent estimates, over 800 Israelis have lost their lives, and approximately 2,500 have been wounded in this vicious terror attack, marking it one of the deadliest acts of terror in recent history. Additionally, there are countless hostages, including women, children, and elders, who have been taken into Gaza by Hamas. The sheer terror and cruelness of this attack and slaughter reminds me of dark periods in humankind history. I strongly believe each person should take a very clear stance on the brutality of Hamas actions. It's vital that we raise public attention about this situation and hold Iran and Hamas accountable for their actions. Let's make sure the world knows about the impact of these events and the need for accountability. Don‚Äôt be silent! Make no mistake, Israel's resilience is unwavering. We are determined to overcome these challenges and ensure the safety and well-being of our people. Help spread the word, raise awareness, and stand strong with Israel. Together, we shall overcome. üáÆüá± #StandWithIsrael\n\nIn the midst of the bustling life and struggles shared by an individual who got rejected 100 times and more before getting into their dream company or a multi millionaire who had fallen bankrupt and had 10-15 failed startups or a best selling author who had their manuscript being rejected by dozens of publishing houses. In the middle of all these success and failure stories of 'great' men and women , are we forgetting the main motive for our existence ? Are we following the so called \"ideology\" that our success comes only through material gains and being content ? Around 1000+ children killed in Gaza just in the past 11 days. Now just think, are we failing as humans by not raising our voice against the atrocities and dehumanized treatment, these innocent civilans have been exposed to by the state of Israel? How can there be contentment when there's visuals of the bodies of babies being carried. How can there be contentment when you hear the doctor cry because the deceased were his children. How can there be contentment when you see visuals of bodies spread as if they were locusts. What's the use of success when a person is neutral in the matters of genocide !\n\nDear New York Times, We are writing to address your latest reports concerning the heartbreaking blast in the Gaza Ahli Arab Hospital. The first headlines published on your platform read ‚ÄúIsraeli Strike Kills Hundreds in Hospital, Palestinians say.‚Äù This short caption was extremely misleading to readers, as it gave the impression Israel‚Äôs responsibility for the explosion was a confirmed fact (as you know, this was later refuted). Additionally, the Palestinian sources cited in this article were the Gazan health authorities, a body under Hamas authority, whose integrity is questionable. The New York Times is known worldwide as a reputable source that fact-checks their reports. When an unconfirmed and inaccurate report is published by your outlet, it leads to hundreds of articles and videos on social media basing their arguments and reports on the New York Times. Even if your headline is retracted and corrected, the waves of the original article are still in motion and little can be done to stop and amend them. We acknowledge reporting on the current war between Israel and Hamas requires expediency in order to inform the public. However, if the reports published are misleading and not factual, they do a great deal of harm. Sincerely, Fight for Life Advocacy Office #HAMASisISIS #Gaza #Hamas #IDF #MiddleEastConflict #PeaceInTheMiddleEast #HumanRights #IsraelPalestine #PeaceProcess #ConflictResolution #InternationalRelations #GazaCrisis #MiddleEastPeace #WarAndPeace #ConflictZone #WorldAffairs #Geopolitics #GlobalSecurity #UnitedNations #Ceasefire #PalestinianRights\n\nLet The Truth Out! What have you been seeing in the last couple of weeks is an example of the 75-years long #Zionist and #American supported #terrorism taking place in occupied #Palestine! This #genocide in #Palestine and #Gaza has been lingering and getting worse recently. This horror is what your silence and support to #Israel is birthing! I know it is absolutely wrecking to the soul and possibly offensive to the professional #LinkedIn community rules to post it because it contains graphic content. But hey, this graphic content is actually created by an #apartheid #colonial state and our community rules are not sacred and could be bent, if needed, to allow a group of people facing genocide to be heard and have a clear and true voice in our LinkedIn and social media time. I mean, at least do it in the honor of murdered #Palestinian platform users who are mostly linguists, writers, content creators, designers, translators, editors and very talented business men and women during this escalated brutality against their homes and families. Do you actually have any idea about the statistics of those who the platform lost due to being murdered by Israeli #Occupation Forces #IOF? Do they deserve any recognition or grief from us? I mean what is the point of professionalism, business acumen, budgets and flat numbers when people are dying in scores because of a tyrant land grabber, in our time. I mean dogs in the #West have a voice, why not the Palestinians?! Come on, if it is not the cultured, educated, diverse and professional family of LinkedIn, Proz and others, who is going to do the writing, talking and creating the content to inform everyone on #Earth of the truth? I mean, is not it simpler and more honest to just take a picture or even a video of what is happening and let the audience see for themselves? When I post anything about Gaza, it is the truth! It‚Äôs my fight because I‚Äôm a human in the first place. I‚Äôm also a neighbor and a lawful historical eyewitness. It is our duty to let people know of the #massacres and #war #crimes really happening because it is really worth it! This is a test to our humanity and future legacy. Our silence could lead to a disaster and most likely catastrophic consequences. If a flood of anger and violence breaks out in this region, no one is ever ready for a world war. Do not let Israel or the #US government do it. They always have had different agendas and ulterior motives. This #criminal and insane #Israeli lashout is not isolated from the inner politics in Israel or America happening today! If Jews themselves are now standing up against Israel and the US, I have faith you can do it and remove the veil of hypocrisy and double standards and see the Palestinians for who they are, occupied, terrorized, displaced and slaughtered lawful owners of their lands, homes and families! The best thing, you can actually do something about it!\n\nEvery night I go through my LinkedIn feed and mostly I see pro Palestine posts and anti Palestine posts. And I compartmentalise and read the posts as objectively as I could (sincerely). And there‚Äôs always one thing that stands above the rest and that‚Äôs, I‚Äôve NEVER heard, read or seen someone say ‚Äúwell, that does it, the post changed my mind‚Äù. Same goes for in person discussions, I‚Äôve NEVER seen someone walking away from these conversations saying ‚Äúyep, fair play, mind changed‚Äù. Is this because we‚Äôve lost the art to debate? Or is this because we are so entrenched in our beliefs we‚Äôve forgone reason? Or is this because many of us are in digital echo chambers? *Reader! if there‚Äôs a part of your mind that is thinking, does this bloke want us to talk whilst kids in Gaza die / alternatively why captured Israeli citizens are being killed and under attack, the answer is yes* This is because the only way we can end the suffering is to engage in debate. Honest, open minded, persuasive and sincere discussion. Naming someone anti semite, Islamophobe or any label does nothing for anyone. What will help the kids in Gaza and the captured Israeli hostages is honest reflection. Ask yourselves, why I hold these beliefs? What evidence have I reviewed? What could I have missed? What would I do if I was in X situation? And keep asking yourselves these questions. This is the ONLY way to end the suffering and progress humanity. It‚Äôs up to you.\n\nI know that LinkedIn is a professional network and employment-focused social media platform .. But I have to explain in somehow here what is happening in Palestaine and Gaza and it has to spread worldwide .. üáµüá∏üáµüá∏üáµüá∏üáµüá∏üáµüá∏üáµüá∏ Advocating for the human rights of Palestinians does not mean you are pro-Hamas. Advocating for the human rights of Palestinians does not mean you are pro ending Jewish lives. Advocating for the human rights of Palestinians does not mean you are anti-Semitic. Being anti-Israeli government regime against Palestinians and their imposed apartheid on Palestinians does not mean you are anti-Semitic. Empathizing with the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians does not mean you don't empathize with the murders and violence against our Jewish brothers and sisters. Cutting water and electricity off for 2.3 million innocent Palestinians, half of whom are children, is not the answer. Ethnic cleansing is not the answer. Selective empathy is not the answer. Valuing one human life over the other is not the answer. Stand with the right side of story üáµüá∏‚úåÔ∏è Stop Gaza genocide . üî∫watch the video please üôè"
