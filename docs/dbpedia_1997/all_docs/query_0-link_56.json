        "text": "Social inclusion is a process of assisting the full participation of vulnerable groups of people in the social and economic life of society. It is the unconditional right of every person. The practices of social work are aimed at providing conditions for such inclusion. The purpose of this article is to analyze and investigate the impact of non-formal learning activities on the social inclusion of children and young people at risk of poverty and social exclusion. The research group is a contingent of the International Youth Center in Stara Zagora, Bulgaria. The survey covers the period 2014-2017. The basis of the analysis is an empirical study of the \"Social Inclusion Index\", which is seen as a set of activities, based on the implementation of inclusive practices, the introduction of inclusive policies and the formation of inclusive values.\n\nThe phenomenon of work migration and of the entry of foreign workers into the local labor market is explained as a part of the development of a global capitalist economy that creates inequality between countries with surplus capital and countries with surplus working hands. It is also possible to see this as a gap between core countries and peripheral countries and the relationships of the dependence of the latter on the former. Another possible way to examine this is through the mechanisms of social and economic welfare that exist in these countries that absorb migrant workers and that create a comfortable social infrastructure for the absorption of migrant workers and family members who are interested in ensuring for themselves a better future. In the peripheral countries, there are excess labor forces, which in practice are used to fill gaps in manpower in the economies of the core countries. Lacking sources of income, whether due to shortages or war, many residents of peripheral countries are forced to migrate to developed countries, the majority of which have, to some degree or another, mechanisms of a welfare state and which have developed the demand for unskilled workers who do not hesitate to take on any job. While the Palestinian workers worked in the areas of Israel on a daily basis and returned to their place of residence, the massive absorption of the migrant workers from distant countries led to the formation of foreign communities in the large cities and the agricultural communities in Israel. The steadily increasing process of the friction between the citizens of the state and the migrant workers, alongside the steadily increasing competition for work places, increased the social disputes between the low classes and the migrant workers. The process of the reduction of the number of migrant workers was only partially successful following the continual infiltration of illegal foreign workers and the entry of asylum seekers from Africa. From the moment that the government made the decision to deport migrant workers, the rights of migrant workers worsened. The maltreatment of the migrant workers by their employers worsened because of the workers’ constant fear of deportation. Simultaneously, the migrant workers found themselves suddenly stranded in a foreign country without any possibility of approaching the government authorities in cases of the violation of their basic rights."
