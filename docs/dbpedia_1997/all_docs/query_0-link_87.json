        "text": "Keep up-to-date with our collected news of the world!\n\nChina Fires Back at New Western Military Alliance With Violent Rhetoric: ‘No Mercy’ for Further Provocations (U.S. News & World Report)\n\n“The Australia-U.K.-U.S. security pact, to include granting nuclear propulsion technology for Australian submarines, prompted severe warnings from Beijing… China on Thursday expressed outrage at a new security pact between Australia, the U.K. and the U.S., blasting what it considers a new Western provocation and singling out Australian troops as the first to die as a result of ‘Beijing’s countermeasures so as to send a warning to others.’ ‘Australia has turned itself into an adversary of China,’ China’s English-language Global Times, considered a mouthpiece for the Chinese Communist Party, proclaimed in an editorial Thursday morning. ‘If Australia dares to provoke China more blatantly,’ it added, ‘or even find fault militarily, China will certainly punish it with no mercy.’ The violent rhetoric came a day after the leaders of the three Western powers announced the new alliance, dubbed ‘AUKUS.’ In joint remote remarks Thursday evening, President Joe Biden noted that the awkward AUKUS acronym ‘sounds strange’ but that the effort nonetheless ‘will update and enhance our shared ability to take on the threats of the 21st century just as we did in the 20th century: together.’ The pact represents an apparent consolation as the U.S. has yet to accomplish its stated goal of securing a broader alliance to contain China’s ambitions, namely to include regional powers Japan and India. But it succeeded in seizing Beijing’s attention, particularly the new provision that the U.S. will share technology with Australia for it to build a nuclear-propelled submarine – only the second time ever, after the U.K., that Washington has done so. Officials in Australia and the U.S. have insisted this does not represent an attempt by Canberra to eventually field nuclear weapons, though Chinese officials have subsequently doubted that assertion. ‘The nuclear submarine cooperation among the US, the UK & Australia severely undermines regional peace & stability, intensifies arms race and undercuts intl non-proliferation efforts,’ Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao wrote in a tweet. ‘It’s highly irresponsible and shows double standards on using nuclear export for geopolitical games.’ … There is no doubt that China serves as the primary focus of the new arrangement, particularly as Biden and other leaders have singled out Beijing as the main source of confrontation to these stated goals for maintaining order in the Asia-Pacific region and other parts of the world where China has ambitions. And regardless of their intention, China made clear its own interpretation of the security pact, its effects and how it plans to respond, beginning with Australia. ‘If it acts with bravado to show its allegiance to the US and takes the most prominent position in the US’ anti-China strategy, especially by being militarily assertive, then Canberra will most likely become a target of Beijing’s countermeasures so as to send a warning to others,’ the Global Times wrote. ‘Thus, Australian troops are also most likely to be the first batch of Western soldiers to waste their lives in the South China Sea.’ ‘Since Australia has become an anti-China spearhead, the country should prepare for the worst,’ it concluded. The latest confrontation represents hardly the first time China has attempted to single out for punishment the lead Western country in its neighborhood. In May 2020, for example, it began imposing crippling boycotts on Australian goods such as beef and barley after leaders there called for the World Health Organization to investigate the origins of the coronavirus – a form of retaliation that spurred widespread economic concerns in Australia. And in some ways it may serve as a test case for how China follows through on threats it makes to countries that break from historic impartiality and align themselves with either superpower. Both the Trump and Biden administrations increasingly sought to militarize a loose partnership with Australia, Japan and India known as ‘The Quad,’ even toying in recent months with the idea of expanding membership to other countries like the U.K. Japan, however, is constitutionally restricted in how it can employ its military. And India has historically practiced a policy of strategic autonomy, even as its own security concerns with China have grown in recent months, particularly along their shared border at the Himalayas.” (16.09.21) Read here.\n\nBiden announces security pact that would deliver nuclear submarines to Australia (NBC News)\n\n“President Joe Biden announced a security partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom on Wednesday evening as the administration ramps up efforts to counter China‘s rising power. One of the first U.S. moves as part of the agreement will be to assist Australia with the purchase of nuclear submarines, which offer more stealth capabilities, speed and range than traditional submarines, he said. Just a handful of countries, including China and Russia, have nuclear-powered submarines. ‘This initiative is about making sure that each of us has the most modern capabilities we need to maneuver and defend against rapidly evolving threats,’ Biden said. A senior administration official described the pact as ‘historic,’ and said it would increase cooperation among the three nations on military defense, cyber threats and supply chain security in the Indo-Pacific region. The officials said the move wasn’t aimed at any one country, but Biden has pointed to China as one of the biggest national security threats facing the United States. ‘The United States, Australia and the United Kingdom have long been faithful and capable partners and we are even closer today,’ Biden said. ‘Today we’re taking another historic step to deepen and formalize cooperation among all three of our nations because we all recognize the imperative of ensuring peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region over the long term.’ Biden was joined virtually Wednesday by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping had a lengthy conversation by phone last week, their first call in at least seven months, in what the White House described as a ‘candid’ conversation to discuss the ‘responsibility of both nations to ensure competition does not veer into conflict’ between the world’s two most powerful nations. Xi told Biden that U.S. policy on China had caused serious difficulties for the two countries’ relationship, according to a readout of the call published by Xinhua, China’s state-run news agency.” (15.09.21) Continue reading here.\n\nArizona becomes first state to sue over Biden vaccine mandate, even though the text isn’t out yet (Business Insider)\n\n“Arizona’s Attorney General Mark Brnovich filed a lawsuit against the Biden administration over its vaccine mandates, the first of several threatened cases from Republicans. In the complaint submitted Tuesday, Brnovich called the policy ‘unconstitutional,’ appearing to focus his argument on the claim that it unfairly does not apply to migrants who enter the U.S. illegally. President Joe Biden on Thursday announced sweeping vaccine mandates for federal employees and federal contractors, and mandatory vaccination or weekly testing for all businesses with more than 100 employees. However, officials did not publish the text and details of the rule, only giving a broad summary. It is unclear when the full text — against which any lawsuit would have to argue — is due to be published …Brnovich argued that the mandates favor ‘migrants who cross the southern border illegally’ who ‘are not subject to any vaccination requirements.’ ‘This reflects an unmistakable—and unconstitutional—brand of favoritism in favor of illegal migrants,’ Brnovich’s office said in a statement. He argues that the move violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, his office said. The Equal Protection Clause states that a government body cannot deny people equal protection under its governing laws, according to the Cornell law Legal Information Institute. The argument — though in tune with GOP messaging focused on US border crossings — was not one predicted by legal scholars. Those discussions focused more on potential government overreach and discrimination between different groups of U.S. citizens, rather than between them and others. The scholars generally predicted that challenges to the mandates would fail …The suit is against Biden, Alejandro Mayorkas, Secretary of Homeland Security, the United States Department of Homeland Security, Troy Miller, acting commissioner for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and Tae Johnson, acting Director for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. According to CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, the move may be rushed. The Labor Department and Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the agency tasked with enforcing the mandate for employers of over 100 people, have yet to come up with the rule to enforce Biden’s mandate…” (15.09.21) Read more here.\n\nBiden vaccine mandate will test OSHA, U.S. workplace regulator (Reuters)\n\n“The U.S. agency in charge of the Biden administration’s new rules requiring COVID-19 vaccination at many private workplaces faces stiff challenges in developing and enforcing the mandate… The Labor Department’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is in charge of formulating and enforcing the rule, which will be rolled out in the coming weeks. But the agency is significantly understaffed, and its emergency rulemaking mechanism has a mixed track record. The mandate already faces Republican political opposition and promised legal challenges. With more than 80 million workers covered, ‘OSHA won’t be able to police every employer,’ said A. Scott Hecker, a labor lawyer in Washington at Seyfarth Shaw. OSHA plans to publish an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) to enact the new requirements, the White House said Friday. That measure, which is used to accelerate urgent rules, has only been used 10 times in OSHA’s 50-year history. Courts have invalidated or halted four of those rules and partially blocked one, according to the Congressional Research Service. The ETS process was last used in June to institute healthcare workplace rules to stop the spread of coronavirus. Before that, OSHA’s last ETS was 38 years ago. The June rule took five months for OSHA to formulate after an executive order by Biden. Unions sued to challenge it, claiming that it did not do enough to protect workers outside healthcare. The new vaccination rule would likely be in effect while any legal challenges played out, but OSHA’s low success rate with ETS rules undercuts its ability to instill fear in scofflaws …OSHA’s effectiveness is also undermined by its shortage of inspectors and resources. While OSHA is empowered to fine employers up to $13,600 per violation of the new rule, it is spread too thin to catch some violators…In addition, the agency has largely failed to hold employers accountable for unsafe conditions during the pandemic, Reuters reported earlier this year, identifying dozens of workplaces where employees complained of slipshod pandemic safety. Regulators never inspected the facilities or, in some cases, took months to do so. Two-thirds of employers cited by OSHA for COVID-19 safety violations had not paid fines, and more than half appealed the OSHA citations. One weapon on OSHA’s side is news coverage and public attention. Last year, a former OSHA official posted on Twitter that an OSHA news release achieved as much compliance as 210 inspections.” (13.09.21) Read here.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Republican Attorneys General Plan To Create Legal Roadblocks For Biden Agenda (Daily Caller)\n\n“Republican attorneys general are determined to mount numerous legal challenges against President Joe Biden, creating a formidable roadblock to the president’s agenda… ‘We are sharpening the pencils and filling up the inkwells,’ Louisiana Attorney General and former Republican Attorneys General Association Chairman Jeff Landry, who is leading two of the ongoing lawsuits against the Biden administration, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. Landry said there will be plenty of legal action and success in court against the president and his administration. Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen said Republican attorneys general believe that with a gridlocked Congress, states are the last line of defense for Constitutional rights. The attorney general added that he will continue to focus his efforts on Biden’s reliance on executive action, which the president has used to forward several key policy items. ‘When you step in on day one and start issuing edicts and executive orders like King George, I and a lot of other conservative Republicans are going to start having problems,’ Knudsen said in an interview …Biden signed more executive orders in his first two days in office than Trump signed in his first two months, according to The Economist…” (10.09.21) Continue reading here.\n\nBiden’s Vaccine Mandate Is a Big Mistake (New York Times)\n\n“There’s one person that President Biden desperately needs to consult about his new federal vaccine mandate: President-elect Biden…He said he would not force anyone to get the jab. ‘No, I don’t think it should be mandatory,’ he told reporters. ‘I wouldn’t demand it be mandatory.’ Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, recently reiterated Mr. Biden’s position. ‘That’s not the role of the federal government,’ she declared on July 23, referring to the idea of a government mandate. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the same thing a week later: ‘There will be no nationwide mandate.’ So much for that . . .Forcing vaccines on a minority contingent of unwilling people is a huge error that risks shredding the social fabric of a country already being pulled apart by political tribalism. The president should not — and most likely does not — have the power to unilaterally compel millions of private-sector workers to get vaccinated or risk losing their jobs: Mr. Biden is presiding over a vast expansion of federal authority, one that Democrats will certainly come to regret the next time a Republican takes power. Moreover, the mechanism of enforcement — a presidential decree smuggled into law by the Department of Labor and its Occupational Safety and Health Administration — is fundamentally undemocratic. Congress is supposed to make new laws, not an unaccountable bureaucratic agency. While more than 70 percent of American adults have received a shot, a smaller but sizable group of people, for various reasons, are unvaccinated. Some members of this group have antibodies from a previous Covid case and are reasonably protected from future illness, according to recent data. There is little benefit to forcing vaccination on such people, and Mr. Biden’s decision to not exempt them is a significant misstep …[And] the coercive approach has major downsides. The most anti-vaccine Americans will probably not change their minds because the government is strong-arming employers. On the contrary, the federal mandate might actually be taken as confirmation of their paranoid suspicions that the vaccines have less to do with their health and more to do with social control. As a practical matter, it’s undeniable that the federal mandate will engender a titanic backlash and create a spate of lawsuits. Vaccine holdouts have already taken legal action against employers requiring vaccination: Todd Zywicki, a law professor at George Mason University in Virginia who had recovered from Covid and has antibodies, recently fought his institution’s mandate and prevailed. And Republican governors are certain to battle Mr. Biden over this policy. Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota, a Republican, tweeted at the president, ‘See you in court.’ It’s true that courts have upheld vaccine mandates in certain circumstances: In a 1922 case, the Supreme Court famously ruled that a city ordinance could deny admission to students who failed to get the smallpox vaccine. But the assertion that a public official can completely sidestep the legislative process and enact a much farther-reaching vaccine mandate via administrative action should elicit skepticism from even those who vigorously support vaccination …Some people would probably voluntarily get the shot if they knew for certain that a vaccination card was a ticket to living a normal life once again. Regrettably, Mr. Biden’s mandate moves in the exact opposite direction, with the White House saying his plan will ensure that ‘strong mask requirements remain in place.’ If the government is concerned about vaccine hesitancy, it should trust the vaccines and drop other restrictions. People should know that if they get vaccinated, they will be better off. Instead, the White House is sending the message that people must get vaccinated but should hardly expect things to be different afterward. It’s worth repeating that the federal vaccine mandate represents a broad expansion of the executive branch’s power. And Mr. Biden will not be the chief executive forever. Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, a plausible 2024 Republican presidential candidate, has used his current authority to prohibit private vaccine mandates in his state. Is this really the time to solidify the idea that the president is the ultimate authority on whether such things should be required or forbidden?” (10.09.21) Read here.\n\n*Author Robby Soave previously won the Southern California Journalism Award from the Los Angeles Press Club,[1] and has been named to Forbes Magazine’s “30 under 30” list.[2] The University of Michigan alumnus is a Novak Fellow at The Fund for American Studies,[3] and also serves on the D.C.

It has no place in America.’ [Article insert: Tweet issued by Governor Mark Gordon reads “This administration’s latest pronouncement demonstrates its complete disregard for the rule of law and the freedoms individuals and private companies enjoy under our Constitution. In Wyoming, we believe that government must be held in check.“] South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster said he will fight Biden ‘to the gates of hell’ to protect liberty and livelihood of every South Carolinian. [Inserted: Tweets issued by Governor McMaster read “The American Dream has turned into a nightmare under President Biden and the radical Democrats. They have declared war against capitalism, thumbed their noses at the Constitution, and empowered our enemies abroad” and “Rest assured, we will fight them to the gates of hell to protect the liberty and livelihood of every South Carolinian.”] Georgia Governor Brian Kemp said he will ‘pursue every legal option available’ to stop Joe Biden’s Covid vaccine mandate. Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts released a statement vowing to fight Joe Biden’s mandate: ‘President Biden’s announcement is a stunning violation of personal freedom and abuse of the federal government’s power,’ said Governor Ricketts. ‘This plan isn’t about public health – this is about government control and taking away personal liberties. Americans, not the federal government, are responsible for taking charge of their personal health. It is not the role of the federal government to mandate their choices. Nebraska will stand up to President Biden’s overreach, and we will be working with the Attorney General to explore all our options.’ Texas Governor Greg Abbott said his attorney general is already working to halt Joe Biden’s vaccine mandate. [Insert: Tweet issued by Governor Abbott reads “Biden’s vaccine mandate is an assault on private businesses. I issued an Executive Order protecting Texans’ right to choose whether they get the COVID vaccine & added it to the special session agenda. Texas is already working to halt this power grab.“] South Dakota Governor Krisi Noem vowed to fight Biden, ‘See you in court.’ [Insert: Tweet issued by Governor Noem reads “South Dakota will stand up to defend freedom. @JoeBiden see you in court.”] Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves said Biden has no authority to require Americans inject themselves and said the mandate is ‘unconstitutional.’ [Insert: Tweet issued by Governor Reeves reads “The President has no authority to require that Americans inject themselves because of their employment at a private business. The vaccine itself is life-saving, but this unconstitutional move is terrifying. This is still America, and we still believe in freedom from tyrants.”] Arizona Governor Doug Ducey said Arizona will not stand for Biden’s overreach. [Insert: Tweets issued by Governor Ducey read “The Biden-Harris administration plans on fining businesses $14,000 for every employee not tested or vaccinated — but somehow they’ve exempted one of their largest federal agencies from the mandate?” and “Maybe it’s because they realize this is pure government overreach. Maybe it’s because they realize this will only make workforce shortages worse. Or maybe it’s simply a case of ‘rules for thee, not for me.’ It’s hypocrisy and Arizona will not stand for it.”] Missouri Governor Mike Parson said his administration will fight back against Biden’s power grab. [Insert: Tweets issued by Governor Parson read “The Biden Administration’s recent announcement seeking to dictate personal freedom and private business decisions is an insult to our American principles of individual liberty and free enterprise” and “This heavy-handed action by the federal government is unwelcome in our state and has potentially dangerous consequences for working families” and “Vaccination protects us from serious illness, but the decision to get vaccinated is a private health care decision that should remain as such. My administration will always fight back against federal power grabs and government overreach that threatens to limit our freedoms.”] Alabama Governor Kay Ivey surprisingly shot back at Joe Biden on Thursday. [Insert: Tweet issued by Governor Ivey reads “Bring it on. Washington won’t be telling Alabama what to do. — KI #alpolitics”] Idaho Governor Brad Little released a very weak statement in response to Biden’s unconstitutional mandates. [Insert: Tweet issued by Governor Little reads “Today’s actions from President Biden amount to government overreach. Government should stay out of decisions involving employers and their employees as much as possible. I’ve advocated for and championed fewer government regulations and mandates on business.”]…” (09.09.21) Read more here.\n\n* * *\n\nSeveral more state governors are likewise standing against the Biden administration’s mandate but are not mentioned in the above report. For instance, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has confirmed that he will use courts and his state’s legislature to protect Floridians from the mandate. DeSantis called the executive order “not scientifically valid,” pointing out that Biden’s “plan” doesn’t even recognize the people who’ve gained natural immunity through infection. *According to the CDC, this group should already account for more than one-third of the U.S. population; the agency estimated that 35% of Americans had recovered naturally from a SARS‑CoV‑2 infection between February 2020 and March 2021.[1] Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb issued a statement Friday calling the vaccine mandates “a bridge too far.” He affirmed, “It’s not the state or federal government’s role to issue a vaccine mandate upon citizens and private businesses …it is fundamentally a citizen’s right to choose whether or not to get the vaccine.” New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu described Biden’s plan as “creating instability,” drawing attention to the more immediate effect of the vaccine mandate on public health: a grossly understaffed healthcare system. With so many nurses and frontline workers refusing to take the new vaccine―in parts of the country up to 60% have refused―hospitals are cancelling surgeries and even baby deliveries.[2][3] Sununu spoke to these issues in his own state, saying “New Hampshire’s workforce, most especially in health care, is at a critical level and unilateral mandates by the federal government could lead to shortages in multiple areas that are already at grave risk.”[4] Tennessee Governor Bill Lee has also vowed to fight Biden’s mandate, declaring “The Constitution won’t allow this power grab, and in the meantime, I will stand up for all Tennesseans…’This is not about freedom’ is a phrase that should never come out of a U.S. President’s mouth.” Montana Governor Greg Gianforte entered the fray too, proclaiming “President Biden’s vaccination mandate is unlawful and un-American … We are committed to protecting Montanans’ freedoms and liberties against this gross federal overreach.” Maryland Governor Larry Hogan asserted that his state will not be party to Biden’s mandates, that Maryland will stick to its tack of just “encouraging” vaccination. Iowa Governess Kim Reynolds more harshly criticized the Biden plan, calling it “dangerous and unprecedented.” Alaska Governor Mike Dunleavy has also taken a stand, saying that the novel vaccine mandate is “ill conceived, divisive, and un-American,” and went on to say “[F]orced medical procedures run counter to our collective sense of fairness and liberty … My administration is aggressively identifying every tool at our disposal to protect the inherent individual rights of all Alaskans.” North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum referred to the Biden mandate as a “dangerous path” and confirmed that his AG is reviewing the options for challenging it. Similarly, Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson warned that the mandate is “counterproductive” and that it will only “increase resistance.” Ohio Governor Mike DeWine said “the President made a mistake … people and business owners should make their own decisions about vaccination.” Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt also rebuked Biden, maintaining “It is not the government’s role to dictate to private businesses what to do …Once again, President Biden is demonstrating his complete disregard for individual freedoms and states’ rights.” Utah Governor Spencer Cox has said that Biden is “usurping the role of Congress” and―like many of the aforenamed governors―considers the mandate “unconstitutional.” And West Virginia Governor Jim Justice, who also spoke on the President’s new mandate, said “I absolutely think that is wrong. I am absolutely not in support of doing that in any way in the state of West Virginia.” (Justice also said that he does not believe the mandate will actually go into effect.)\n\nHere’s what a legal expert thinks of Biden’s vaccine mandate (11Alive News Atlanta)\n\n“…The rules mandate all employers with more than 100 workers require them to be vaccinated or test for the virus weekly, affecting about 80 million Americans. On top of that, the roughly 17 million workers at health facilities that receive federal Medicare or Medicaid also will have to be fully vaccinated… So, how is that possible? We asked 11Alive’s legal expert, attorney Page Pate. Pate explained there is a basis for the order and the way the Biden administration is trying to enforce the rule is through the Labor Department and OSHA. ‘OHSA does have the ability to require businesses, especially large companies to put in place safety regulations, things that will protect the health and security of the people that work there. So, the theory from the Biden administration, COVID’s a big risk, vaccinations work as least as far as serious illness is concerned mostly, so we are going to require people are vaccinated or regularly tested as a workplace safety issue,’ Pate said. ‘But, there’s never been anything like this done before.’ Pate anticipates challenges to the order, with some businesses refusing to follow the rule and even suing the government. He said it would be an uphill battle to enforce the regulation. ‘When we think about OSHA workplace safety rules, we think of things like making sure the roof isn’t falling, masking sure workers who are involved in hazardous duties have masks on, something that’s obvious to protect someone’s immediate risk of injury. This is very different,’ he said. Georgia-based businesses like Home Depot responded in a joint statement praising the requirement. ‘Business Roundtable welcomes the Biden Administration’s continued vigilance in the fight against COVID. America’s business leaders know how critical vaccination and testing are in defeating the pandemic,’ the statement read. But Pate doesn’t believe every company will be on board, and it could lead to lawsuits from CEOs hoping to seek a nationwide injunction. ‘The employer might ask to file an action against OSHA, asking a judge to say that this particular requirement you’re imposing on us, well you can’t do that,’ Pate explained. However, big companies may see pushing back on the requirement and filing a lawsuit as a PR nightmare, according to Pate. He thinks medium-sized companies would be more willing to change the order and added that a judge might see the order as a step too far. As for an employee, Pate said it would be difficult to sue their employer should they be fired for not following the requirement. ‘You can’t sue over that, especially not in Georgia. We’re an at-will state,’ said Pate. ‘You’re refusal to take a vaccine or test is not a protected class.’ In a tweet, Governor Brian Kemp responded to the order, writing he’s prepared to take ‘every legal option’ to challenge the order. But Pate said that would be difficult to do. ‘I can’t think of a single thing he can do legally to protect that. He doesn’t have the standing to file a lawsuit like a private business would. OSHA’s not requiring the governor’s staff to go get vaccinated. The requirement is placed on private businesses.

His administration will also require federal contractors to ensure their employees are vaccinated. The mandate affects some 100 million Americans, according to the Associated Press. The move was a reversal of the administration’s previous stance. Biden’s Press Secretary, Jen Psaki, was asked in July whether the federal government should step in and issue vaccine mandates. Psaki said such mandates were ‘not the role of the federal government’ …On July 4, Biden delivered a speech ‘celebrating Independence Day and independence from COVID-19.’ Psaki argued on Thursday that the declaration was ‘not premature,’ pointing at unvaccinated Americans as the cause of the current situation.

Decades of history show why they’re right. Their concern that the FDA may be moving too quickly heightened when FDA Commissioner Dr. Steven Hahn told the Financial Times that his agency could consider an emergency use authorization (EUA) for a Covid-19 vaccine before late stage clinical trials are complete… Only once before has the FDA given a vaccine this lesser standard approval of an EUA, but it was in an unusual circumstance. Soldiers had sued, claiming a mandatory anthrax vaccine made them sick, and a judge put a hold on the program. The Department of Defense asked for an EUA that then overrode the court ruling in 2005, so it could continue vaccinating military personnel — this time on a voluntary basis. Otherwise, vaccines have had to go through the entire clinical trial process and FDA approval process, which can take months or years. When the vaccine making process has been rushed, there have been bad outcomes. On April 12, 1955 the government announced the first vaccine to protect kids against polio. Within days, labs had made thousands of lots of the vaccine. Batches made by one company, Cutter Labs, accidentally contained live polio virus and it caused an outbreak. More than 200,000 children got the polio vaccine, but within days the government had to abandon the program. ‘Forty thousand kids got polio. Some had low levels, a couple hundred were left with paralysis, and about 10 died,’ said Dr. Howard Markel, a pediatrician, distinguished professor, and director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan. The government suspended the vaccination program until it could determine what went wrong. However, increased oversight failed to discover another problem with the polio vaccine. From 1955 to 1963, between 10% and 30% of polio vaccines were contaminated with simian virus 40 (SV40). ‘The way they would grow the virus was on monkey tissues. These rhesus macaques were imported from India, tens of thousands of them,’ medical anthropologist S. Lochlann Jain said. ‘They were gang caged and in those conditions, the ones that didn’t die on the journey, many got sick, and the viruses spread quickly,’ added Jain, who taught a history of vaccines course at Stanford and is working on a publication about the incident. Scientists wrongly thought the formaldehyde they used would kill the virus. ‘It was being transferred to millions of Americans,’ Jain said. ‘Many believe this issue wasn’t adequately pursued,’ Jain said. Some studies showed a possible link between the virus and cancer … In 1976, scientists predicted a pandemic of a new strain of influenza called swine flu. More than 40 years later, some historians call it [the] ‘flu epidemic that never was.’ ‘President Ford was basically told by his advisers, that look, we have a pandemic flu coming called swine flu that may be as bad as Spanish flu,’ said Michael Kinch, a professor of radiation oncology in the school of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis. His latest book, ‘Between Hope and Fear,’ explores the history of vaccines. ‘Ford was being cajoled to put forward a vaccine that was hastily put together. When you have a brand new strain situation like that, they had to do it on the fly,’ Kinch said. Ford made the decision to make the immunization compulsory. The government launched the program in about seven months and 40 million people got vaccinated against swine flu, according to the CDC. That vaccination campaign was later linked to cases of a neurological disorder called Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can develop after an infection or, rarely, after vaccination with a live vaccine… ‘It was kind of a fiasco,’ Markel said. ‘The good news is that there never was an epidemic of swine flu. So we were safe, but that shows you what could happen.’ It took several incidents for people to start distrusting vaccines. Even after thousands of kids got sick from the first polio vaccine in 1955, when the program restarted, parents made sure their children got vaccinated…Markel said people’s attitudes started to change between 1955 and the problematic 1976 swine flu vaccination project […] Markel said people’s mistrust of the system makes the idea that the FDA would rush this process before late stage clinical trials are complete ‘colossally stupid’ … FDA Commissioner Hahn said that the vaccine decision will be based on data, not politics, but Kinch shares Markel’s concern. ‘This could do substantial damage,’ Kinch said. Kinch, who is a patient in one of the vaccine trials himself, said the clinical trial process needs to be followed to the end. A too-early EUA for a vaccine could cause a ‘nightmare scenario,’ for a few reasons. One, the vaccine may not be safe. Two, if it is not safe, people will lose faith in vaccines. Three, if a vaccine doesn’t offer complete protection, people will have a false sense of security and increase their risk. Four, if a substandard vaccine gets an EUA, a better vaccine may never get approval, because people would be reluctant to enroll in trials and risk getting a placebo instead of a vaccine. ‘People are going to die unnecessarily if we take chances with this,’ Kinch said. ‘We’ve got to get this right.'” (01.09.20) Read here.\n\nCovid vaccine rush could make pandemic worse, say scientists (The Guardian)\n\n“The rush to immunise populations against Covid-19 could lead to the rollout of a vaccine that is not very effective and risk worsening the pandemic, leading scientists have said. Politicians and commercial companies are competing to be the first to license a vaccine, but experts say the world would be better served by waiting until comprehensive results showed at least 30-50% effectiveness. Ministers announced on Friday that the UK would take emergency powers to push any vaccine through the regulatory processes with unprecedented speed before the end of the year. Donald Trump wants to be able to announce the US has a vaccine before the presidential election on 3 November. A vaccine is vital to stopping the pandemic, but Prof Sir Richard Peto of Oxford University and an adviser to the World Health Organization, said the first vaccine would be bought and used all over the world even if it had low efficacy. Even if it protected only a minority of the population, it would be regarded as the standard by which later vaccines would be measured. That could even lead to inferior vaccines being approved, because they would not have to show that they were any better. ‘I think there’s a big rush, a somewhat nationalistic rush and also somewhat capitalistic rush as well, to be absolutely first to register a vaccine, and it will actually make it more difficult to evaluate other vaccines,’ Peto said … Peto is a member of the WHO’s Solidarity Vaccines Trial Expert Group, which is made up of leading scientists around the world who are advising on the establishment of the WHO’s trial to compare different vaccine candidates. The group said in the Lancet medical journal last week that a poor vaccine would be worse than no vaccine, not least because people who had it would assume they were no longer at risk and stop social distancing. ‘Deployment of a weakly effective vaccine could actually worsen the Covid-19 pandemic if authorities wrongly assume it causes a substantial reduction in risk, or if vaccinated individuals wrongly believe they are immune, hence reducing implementation of, or compliance with, other Covid-19 control measures,’ they said. They urged all regulators to stick to the WHO’s guidance, which says that no vaccine that is less than 30% effective should be approved. It recommends at least 50% effectiveness, but allowing for 95% accuracy that could mean 30% in practice…Good results on safety and effectiveness do not guarantee there will be no long-term problems, they add.” (30.08.20) Continue reading here.\n\nYour Coronavirus Test Is Positive. Maybe It Shouldn’t Be. (New York Times)\n\n“Some of the nation’s leading public health experts are raising a new concern in the endless debate over coronavirus testing in the United States: The standard tests are diagnosing huge numbers of people who may be carrying relatively insignificant amounts of the virus. Most of these people are not likely to be contagious… The PCR test amplifies genetic matter from the virus in cycles; the fewer cycles required, the greater the amount of virus, or viral load, in the sample. The greater the viral load, the more likely the patient is to be contagious. This number of amplification cycles needed to find the virus, called the cycle threshold, is never included in the results sent to doctors and coronavirus patients, although it could tell them how infectious the patients are. In three sets of testing data that include cycle thresholds, compiled by officials in Massachusetts, New York and Nevada, up to 90 percent of people testing positive carried barely any virus, a review by The Times found. On Thursday, the United States recorded 45,604 new coronavirus cases, according to a database maintained by The Times. If the rates of contagiousness in Massachusetts and New York were to apply nationwide, then perhaps only 4,500 of those people may actually need to isolate and submit to contact tracing.” (29.08.20) Read here.\n\nThe Rush for a Vaccine Leaves Little Recourse for Anyone It Harms (Bloomberg)\n\n“Americans who suffer adverse reactions to coronavirus vaccines that the U.S. is racing to develop will have a hard time getting compensated for injuries from the drugs. That’s because pandemic-related claims for vaccines will be routed to a rarely used federal program set up to encourage drugmakers to help combat public health emergencies. It spares pharmaceutical and device makers from costly liability lawsuits in exchange for taxpayers compensating injured patients — though it doesn’t guarantee there’s funding to do so. Since it began in 2009, the program has paid out less than $6 million, and it has yet to receive any dedicated U.S. government funding for Covid-19. ‘In the best case scenario, this is going to be a big deal. Worst case scenario? It will be a crisis,’ said Richard Topping, a former Justice Department attorney … ‘No vaccine or drug is 100% safe,’ said Cody Meissner, head of the Pediatric Infectious Disease Division at Tufts Medical Center and former chairman of the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines …Vaccines are designed to trigger the immune system into fighting off diseases. In rare instances, they can cause it to go into hyperdrive, resulting in severe allergic reactions and even paralysis. With potentially hundreds of millions of people getting vaccinated against one disease, even a very small percentage can translate into a lot of injured people. The potential volume of people affected ‘will be too much for some unfunded compensation program,’ said Topping, currently chief legal officer of CareSource Management Group Inc., a Dayton, Ohio-based non-profit that’s one of the nation’s largest Medicaid-managed health care plans. Having compensation handled through the countermeasures program ‘would be terrible,’ said Anne Carrión Toale of Maglio Christopher & Toale, former president of the Vaccine Injured Petitioner’s Bar Association.” (14.08.20) Read more here.\n\nAstraZeneca to be exempt from coronavirus vaccine liability claims in most countries (Reuters)\n\n“AstraZeneca has been granted protection from future product liability claims related to its COVID-19 vaccine hopeful by most of the countries with which it has struck supply agreements, a senior executive told Reuters.

The contamination made the tests uninterpretable, and—because testing is crucial for containment efforts—it lost the country invaluable time to get ahead of the advancing pandemic. The CDC had been vague about what went wrong with the tests, initially only saying that ‘a problem in the manufacturing of one of the reagents’ had led to the failure. Subsequent reporting suggested that the problem was with a negative control—that is, a part of the test meant to be free of any trace of the coronavirus as a critical reference for confirming that the test was working properly overall. Now, according to investigation results reported by The New York Times, federal officials confirm that sloppy laboratory practices at two of three CDC labs involved in the tests’ creation led to contamination of the tests and their uninterpretable results. Shortly after the problems became apparent in early February, the Food and Drug Administration sent Timothy Stenzel, chief of in vitro diagnostics and radiological health, to the CDC to investigate what was going wrong. According to the Times, he found a lack of coordination and inexperience in commercial manufacturing. Problems that led to the contamination included researchers coming and going from labs working on the test kits without changing their coats and researchers sharing lab space to both assemble test components and handle samples containing the coronavirus. The CDC said in a statement Saturday to the Times that the agency ‘did not manufacture its test consistent with its own protocol.’ Though the CDC appeared reluctant to admit contamination was at the root of the problem, the Times noted that in a separate statement the CDC seemed to acknowledge such problems, saying the agency has since ‘implemented enhanced quality control to address the issue and will be assessing the issue moving forward.’ After the CDC first sent its test kit to states in early February, it took the agency around a month to fix the problem. By then, the virus had invaded many communities unimpeded, and any chance that the U.S. had at containing its spread had virtually vanished. By mid-March, many states turned to mitigation efforts, such as social distancing, to try to blunt—rather than prevent—the life-threatening, healthcare-overwhelming effects of COVID-19. ‘It was just tragic,’ Scott Becker, executive director of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, told the Times. ‘All that time when we were sitting there waiting, I really felt like, here we were at one of the most critical junctures in public health history, and the biggest tool in our toolbox was missing.’ As of the morning of April 20, the U.S. has confirmed more than 760,000 cases of COVID-19 and more than 40,700 deaths. The numbers are expected to be underestimates due to the slow and still limited amount of testing.” (20.04.20) Read here.\n\n*Ars Technica (Latin, translated as ‘Art of Technology’[1]) is the online outlet for technology news from global media giant Condé Nast (Vanity Fair, The New Yorker, Vogue, GQ, Wired, Glamour, Architectural Digest, Allure, etc).

The cables have fueled discussions inside the U.S. government about whether this or another Wuhan lab was the source of the virus — even though conclusive proof has yet to emerge. In January 2018, the U.S. Embassy in Beijing took the unusual step of repeatedly sending U.S. science diplomats to the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), which had in 2015 become China’s first laboratory to achieve the highest level of international bioresearch safety (known as BSL-4). WIV issued a news release in English about the last of these visits, which occurred on March 27, 2018. The U.S. delegation was led by Jamison Fouss, the consul general in Wuhan, and Rick Switzer, the embassy’s counselor of environment, science, technology and health. Last week, WIV erased that statement from its website, though it remains archived on the Internet. What the U.S. officials learned during their visits concerned them so much that they dispatched two diplomatic cables categorized as Sensitive But Unclassified back to Washington. The cables warned about safety and management weaknesses at the WIV lab and proposed more attention and help. The first cable, which I obtained, also warns that the lab’s work on bat coronaviruses and their potential human transmission represented a risk of a new SARS-like pandemic. ‘During interactions with scientists at the WIV laboratory, they noted the new lab has a serious shortage of appropriately trained technicians and investigators needed to safely operate this high-containment laboratory,’ states the Jan. 19, 2018, cable, which was drafted by two officials from the embassy’s environment, science and health sections who met with the WIV scientists. (The State Department declined to comment on this and other details of the story.) The Chinese researchers at WIV were receiving assistance from the Galveston National Laboratory at the University of Texas Medical Branch and other U.S. organizations, but the Chinese requested additional help. The cables argued that the United States should give the Wuhan lab further support, mainly because its research on bat coronaviruses was important but also dangerous. As the cable noted, the U.S. visitors met with Shi Zhengli, the head of the research project, who had been publishing studies related to bat coronaviruses for many years. In November 2017, just before the U.S. officials’ visit, Shi’s team had published research showing that horseshoe bats they had collected from a cave in Yunnan province were very likely from the same bat population that spawned the SARS coronavirus in 2003 …But even in 2015, other scientists questioned whether Shi’s team was taking unnecessary risks. In October 2014, the U.S. government had imposed a moratorium on funding of any research that makes a virus more deadly or contagious, known as ‘gain-of-function’ experiments …Inside the Trump administration, many national security officials have long suspected either the WIV or the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention lab was the source of the novel coronavirus outbreak. According to the New York Times, the intelligence community has provided no evidence to confirm this. But one senior administration official told me that the cables provide one more piece of evidence to support the possibility that the pandemic is the result of a lab accident in Wuhan. ‘The idea that it was just a totally natural occurrence is circumstantial. The evidence it leaked from the lab is circumstantial.

That is an unknown,’ Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO’s emergencies program, said at a press conference at the organization’s Geneva headquarters on Monday. A preliminary study of patients in Shanghai found that some patients had ‘no detectable antibody response’ while others had a very high response, said Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO’s lead scientist on Covid-19. Whether the patients who had a strong antibody response were immune to a second infection is ‘a separate question,’ she added. More than 300,000 of the 1.87 million coronavirus cases across the world have recovered, WHO officials noted, adding that they need more data from recovered patients to understand their antibody response, whether that gives them immunity and [if so] for how long.” (13.04.20) Read here.\n\nBeijing tightens grip over coronavirus research, amid US-China row on virus origin (CNN)\n\n“China has imposed restrictions on the publication of academic research on the origins of the novel coronavirus, according to a central government directive and online notices published by two Chinese universities, that have since been removed from the web. Under the new policy, all academic papers on Covid-19 will be subject to extra vetting before being submitted for publication. Studies on the origin of the virus will receive extra scrutiny and must be approved by central government officials, according to the now-deleted posts. A medical expert in Hong Kong who collaborated with mainland researchers to publish a clinical analysis of Covid-19 cases in an international medical journal said his work did not undergo such vetting in February. The increased scrutiny appears to be the latest effort by the Chinese government to control the narrative on the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 100,000 lives and sickened 1.7 million people worldwide since it first broke out in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December. Since late January, Chinese researchers have published a series of Covid-19 studies in influential international medical journals. Some findings about early coronavirus cases — such as when human-to-human transition first appeared — have raised questions over the official government account of the outbreak and sparked controversy on Chinese social media. And now, Chinese authorities appear to be tightening their grip on the publication of Covid-19 research …The directive is based on instructions issued during a March 25 meeting held by the State Council’s task force on the prevention and control of Covid-19, it said. The document was first posted Friday morning on the website of the Fudan University in Shanghai, one of China’s leading universities. When CNN called a contact number left at the end of the notice, a staff member of the Education ministry’s science and technology department confirmed they had issued the directive. ‘It is not supposed to be made public — it is an internal document,’ said the person, who refused to reveal his name.

A new graph published this week by Dr. Maria Danilychev, a San Diego-based physician, showed the disease causes 1,970 deaths across the country per day, according to Newsweek. Meanwhile, the graph shows that 1,774 deaths per day are caused by heart disease and 1,641 by cancer, the mag reported. Only last week, COVID-19 was the third-leading cause of death, averaging about 748 deaths per day, taking the place of accidents, according to Danilychev’s previous report. The graph uses data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the daily average causes of death and compares them to Worldometers.info statistics about the deadly bug.

Workers in hazmat outfits were seen using a ladder to descend into a huge pit where the coffins were stacked. The location is Hart Island, used for New Yorkers with no next of kin or who could not afford a funeral. New York state now has more coronavirus cases than any single country, according to latest figures. The state’s confirmed caseload of Covid-19 jumped by 10,000 on Thursday to 159,937, of whom 7,000 have died. Spain has had 153,000 cases and Italy 143,000, while China, where the virus emerged last year, has reported 82,000 cases. The US as a whole has recorded 462,000 cases and nearly 16,500 deaths. Globally there are 1.6 million cases and 95,000 deaths. The drone footage comes from Hart Island, off the Bronx in Long Island Sound, which has been used for more than 150 years by city officials as a mass burial site for those with no next-of-kin, or families who cannot afford funerals. It is probable that many of the coffins are for coronavirus victims, but it is not clear whether they fall into the above categories. Burial operations at the site have ramped up amid the pandemic from one day a week to five days a week, according to the Department of Corrections. Prisoners from Rikers Island, the city’s main jail complex, usually do the job, but the rising workload has recently been taken over by contractors.

And they suggest that the current coronavirus death figures understate the real toll of the virus, either because of undercounting of coronavirus deaths, increases in deaths that are normally preventable, or both. Detailed data about deaths are hard to collect in real time, and the best available numbers, still incomplete, can lag by up to two weeks. That also means that they do not include the last few days, when the highest number of coronavirus deaths so far have been recorded in the city …The measurements in our chart rely on a New York Times analysis of provisional data from the National Center for Health Statistics, along with historical data from the C.D.C. and the city’s Department of Health. They capture the number of people who died within the city limits in each month since January 2000. The historical numbers include some small adjustments because of differences in how the two public health organizations measure deaths in the city. The recent numbers are most likely an undercount. Even in normal times, death certificates take time to be processed and collected, and complete death tallies can take weeks to become final. This is especially true for cases involving coronavirus. ‘Covid deaths all have to be manually coded,’ said Bob Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch at the C.D.C.’s National Center for Health Statistics, adding that death counts from New York City typically lag actual deaths by 10 or 11 days. But even if the current count is perfect, roughly 9,780 people have died of all causes over the past month in New York City, about 5,000 more than is typical. The numbers for the last two weeks of the period are even more stark: nearly 7,000 dead, more than three times as many deaths as would normally be expected this time of year. As our charts show, deaths are strongly seasonal: On average, more people die in winter and fewer in summer. These fluctuations aren’t just related to the flu. In a typical year, the vast majority of the variation in mortality is driven by seasonal variation in the number of heart disease deaths. But the deaths over the last month dwarf what would be expected from seasonal variations, and look more like a mass casualty event. The city’s medical examiner’s office is holding bodies in refrigerated trailers outside of hospitals. City emergency medical technicians are declaring deaths in homes and on the streets instead of bringing people to hospitals. Robert A. Jensen, the chairman of Kenyon International, a firm that helps communities respond to major disasters and attacks, said the scale of the event would leave a lasting mark on the city. ‘The reminders will be cemeteries,’ he said, describing European burial areas devoted to victims of the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic. ‘There will be whole sections that have March, April and May 2020.'” (10.04.20) Read more here.\n\nUp to 150 Members of the Saudi Royal Family Infected With Coronavirus (Newsweek)\n\n“As many as 150 members of the Saudi Arabian royal family may have been infected with coronavirus, according to a new report.

You say what are the things you could still do and still approach normal. One of them is absolute compulsive hand washing. The other is you don’t ever shake anybody’s hands.’ He also suggested that people might want to wear ‘cloth face protection’ if they could not avoid being within six feet of others as life starts its return to normal. When the host Kate Linebaugh pointed out that Fauci and others on the coronavirus task force did not stand six feet apart at pandemic briefings, the disease expert said: ‘Don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good here.

Trump was hopeful about the drug, so anti-Trump Democrats like Sisolak were against it. Gov. Sisolak banned (hydroxy)chloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19, ostensibly over concern of hoarders stockpiling the medicine and causing shortages for patients who use the drug for other ailments like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. But while the governor restricted the public from receiving the potentially life-saving drug, Nevada’s Department of Corrections began stockpiling the drug for prisoners… ‘According to sources at the drug maker, Concordia Pharmaceuticals Inc, Nevada prisons ordered a large number of their anti-malaria Hydroxychloroquine drug under the name, Plaquenli.

Fires on at least three towers have been reported over the past few days. In at least two instances, accompanying videos and online posts are raising concerns that the attacks may be linked to conspiracy theories that cast 5G networks as the actual cause of COVID-19. The first two fires — in Belfast, North Ireland, and Birmingham, England — occurred Thursday. A third occurred on a tower in England’s Liverpool area on Friday. The BBC reports that the government says there is no evidence of a link between the Birmingham and Liverpool fires. Though, the Guardian is reporting that Liverpool Mayor Joe Anderson had received threats over the ‘bizarre’ theory. Other reports say online video of a person attempting radiation readings of the Liverpool tower circulated within a week of the fire. And in Belfast, a video purports to show flames licking the base of the tower as a voice is heard cursing 5G networks and saying ‘viva la revolution.’ The Irish News says police are investigating the video. Conspiracy theories over 5G networks predate the virus. Generally, they say radiation from the telecom networks caused illness to those nearby. None of these claims have been backed up by any scientific evidence. Yet the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have given these theories new life with many rumors stating the outbreak is a cover-up for symptoms caused by the 5G networks. New apparent adherents to these theories included English singer-songwriter Anne-Marie and actor Woody Harrelson. The spread of these rumors, as well as the possible arson attacks, are prompting U.K. telecommunication organizations and agencies to counteract the message…Efforts to stanch the spread of misinformation over the coronavirus is also extending to traditional media outlets, with regulators saying they will go after broadcasters perpetuating false claims.

Some researchers say the daily death toll could more than double – to 2,200 or more – by mid-April. That figure would eclipse heart disease, the nation’s No. 1 killer with about 1,772 deaths per day, according to the CDC. … Lung cancer kills 433 people each day in the U.S. – that’s the same number of seats on a Boeing 747 airplane, according to the Lung Cancer Foundation of America. Breast cancer kills about 116 Americans a day. The flu, a chronic killer that the nation has come to expect in yearly cycles – and the reason millions of Americans get flu shots – killed an estimated 508 people per day in the U.S. during the 2017-18 flu season, the nation’s worst in the last decade, according to the CDC. This year’s flu season has recorded an average of 383 deaths per day, CDC figures show. . . Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, has cautioned that the virus could become a recurring event, much like the flu. He said that the U.S. needs to get ready for the next cycle, possibly to occur in the fall of 2020. ‘We really need to be prepared for another cycle,’ Fauci said. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, emphasized the need to continue developing a vaccine and test it quickly so it will be available ‘for that next cycle.’ A University of Washington study updated this week projects that if the entire nation makes an all-out effort to restrict contact, coronavirus deaths will peak in the next two weeks and patients will overwhelm hospitals in most states. Nationally, the University of Washington model predicts a peak daily death toll of 2,214 in mid-April, and a total of 84,000 Americans dead by the end of summer. That’s more than twice the lives claimed during the 2018-19 flu season, which killed 34,000 people, according to the CDC. But that figure represents the model’s most likely estimate. The range of scenarios spans from 36,000 COVID-19 deaths to more than 152,000, according to the research team led by Christopher Murray, founder and chair of the University of Washington’s Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation. As many as 240,000 Americans may die from the new coronavirus according to estimates released by the White House on Tuesday, a grim prediction that influenced Trump’s decision to extend social distancing guidelines. The daily coronavirus death toll likely won’t dip below 100 before June 11, the study predicts… Health experts say the future of the coronavirus depends on such factors as whether humans develop increasing immunity to it and whether an effective vaccine is developed. If neither occurs, the virus will likely continue to circulate and establish itself as a common respiratory virus like the flu.” (02.04.20) Read here.\n\nHow did covid-19 begin?
