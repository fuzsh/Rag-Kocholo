Eitan Paz, with intelligence information about what was happening on the Palestinian side, and asked him to maintain vigilance in the sector.” No one even searched Zikim beach for two days.\n\n“The events of October 7 will accompany the commander of the Southern Command, Yaron Finkelman, and the head of the National Security Agency, Aharon Haliva, until their last day, but now they are busy destroying Hamas. The head of the Shin Bet, Ronan Bar, who is tormented like them, has become a target for the ridicule of some of the detestable in the MKs – and a sharp response such as Even the elders of the political system do not remember his”…”October 7, Finkelman was on vacation in the North. He spent all the holidays, from New Year’s Eve through Yom Kippur to Sukkot, on the fence. The situation was hot, Sinwar threatened and lit fires, and the command was on high alert. A few days before the second holiday of Sukkot (Simchat Torah), Hamas got what it wanted from the Israeli government, and everything calmed down. “…”October 7, Finkelman was on vacation in the North. He spent all the holidays, from New Year’s Eve through Yom Kippur to Sukkot, on the fence. The situation was hot, Sinwar threatened and lit fires, and the command was on high alert. A few days before the second holiday of Sukkot (Simchat Torah), Hamas got what it wanted from the Israeli government, and everything calmed down. The alerts subsided. Finkelman allowed himself to spend one weekend with his family. On Saturday, at four o’clock in the morning, he began to feel, deep in his stomach, that something was wrong. He did not participate in the nightly consultations between the Chief of Staff and the head of the Shin Bet, but he He was familiar with the talk of a large Hamas exercise expected on Saturday. He was not calm and went south around 4:15 in the morning. When he arrived at the command, the fire broke out”…”General Aharon Haliva. Of all those taking responsibility for the October 7 default, Haliva is absorbing the most crossfire. He’s the kind of guy you love to hate. Confident, smiling, optimistic, sometimes too optimistic. He too, like Finkelman, as well as Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi, has not gone home since that Saturday, when he arrived at a mad gallop to Bur Bakria from a family vacation in Eilat. He too was on standby all holidays. He went up and down, north and south, sat with his wing chiefs, with Commander 8200, with the relevant bases, and tried to figure out what was going on. In retrospect, he didn’t understand what was going on. Nobody understood what was going o”….”\n\nThe problem is that their output didn’t include any hint of what’s in store for us on October 7th. Yahya Sanwar, Marwan Issa and Muhammad Daf succeeded in creating total wireless silence in Hamas. Why wasn’t there Yuminti coverage? In simpler words, what about intelligence that comes from sources, from informants, dangerous and spies, those that are activated personally and bring golden information or vital information in real time? This issue has weakened greatly in the last decade, at the same time as Israel’s addiction to Sigint (electronic intelligence) and cyber. The insane capabilities of the 8200 yielded vast amounts of strategic and tactical, life-saving and reality-changing intelligence, but along with it came a blindness to everything non-electronic. And when the sigint goes bankrupt or loses its eyesight, you get a deficiency of lights and system blindness.”…Saturday, at 03:22 in the morning, when General Haliva’s RLS woke him up with all kinds of faint signs or weak signals that something was happening. It was decided to increase vigilance and follow. “We’re on it,” they said to each other. Three Hours later, they were already under it.”…”These people will have to live until their last day with this terrible sense of loss. How did they know about Hamas’ capabilities, knew Hamas’ plans, but failed to understand Hamas’ intentions. How could one small, normal alert, which would have placed the tankmen in their tanks, the Golanchiks in their positions and a few more combat helicopters and drones above the seam line in the Strip, could have turned the bowl upside down and opened the gates of hell on the murderers, instead of on their victim”…Ronen Bar ” all of this, nothing prepared him for what was happening in the last month. That night he took himself to the Shin Bet headquarters at 4:00 a.m. and was sent to the Gaza fence The Shin Bet.”…”A commission of inquiry, should it be set up after the war, and examine how many times Netanyahu sat down with the head of Amman and the head of the Shin Bet compared to the corresponding period of Bennett/Lapid, would be surprised to find out that Netanyahu was hardly interested.”\n\nThe attack on Eilat.\n\nIDF raids Sinwar brother.\n\nPeople ripping down posters in US.
