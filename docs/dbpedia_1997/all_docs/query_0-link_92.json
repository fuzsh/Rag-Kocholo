        "text": "Controversial? chronicles the story with excerpted news coverage\n\n:\n\nApril 9, 2020\n\nIf the COVID-19 pandemic is not one of the most significant events in modern human history (it may be), it is certainly one of the most controversial… From the earliest days of the outbreak, for which the governments of both China[1][2][3] and the United States[4][5][6] were blamed, to the continuing political battles regarding mask mandates[7][8] (which exist despite previous warnings from the WHO[9][10][11][12] and CDC[13][14][15][16][17][18][19] that masks do not prevent infection) to compelled/coerced vaccinations[20][21][22][23][24] (which exist despite violating Article 6 of the UN Declaration on Human Rights), the event has drawn stark new lines of division through the world populace. NIAID director Anthony Fauci has even suggested there could be “two Americas”―one vaccinated, one unvaccinated.[25][26][27][28] Beginning with a WHO announcement that a new coronavirus would kill 3.4% of infected people[29] (CDC data would later be reported to show even the elderly had a 99.946% survival rate[30]), governments would ultimately place more than a third of the planet under lockdown![31] But the nightmare isn’t over yet. Stay tuned as Controversial? continues to update you with all the latest reports and related news items, appearing below in reverse chronological order. *Due to the sensitive nature of this topic, Controversial? wishes to refer all readers to the guidance of their personal physicians and of appropriate governing bodies. Likewise, we implore readers to view our disclaimer here.\n\nJewish community concerned about anti-Semitic flyers in South Florida (WPTV West Palm Beach)\n\n“South Florida’s Jewish community is on edge after hundreds of anti-Semitic flyers were found outside of homes in several cities over the weekend. Jewish federations across South Florida are calling this an act of hate and another example of how anti-Semitic incidents are expanding in our own community and across the nation. Hundreds of anti-Semitic flyers were delivered in the middle of the night to more than 200 homes in Miami Beach and Surfside Sunday targeting the Jewish community. The words of hate were stuffed inside a plastic bags with rocks inside. The bags were thrown outside people’s homes with anti-Semitic writings falsely saying ‘the COVID agenda is Jewish.’ The Jewish Federation of Palm Beach County is calling this an act of hate. Their concerns deepening after learning the same flyers were also reported in Denver and San Francisco…” (26.01.22) Continue reading here.\n\n* * *\n\nUPDATE: The story above made U.S. national and international headlines, with reports published by agencies that included ABC News, CNN, Newsweek, the Jerusalem Post, and London’s Daily Mail. Local reactions found the flyers’ message to be “jolting,” as CNN reported: “I took my morning walk with my wife on Sunday morning, and they were everywhere,’ Miami Beach Mayor Dan Gelber told CNN. ‘For me, it’s jolting because, look, I’m Jewish. … The idea that there are people out there who just are willing to spout out hate simply because who I am, is jolting to anybody,’ Gelber said. The Jewish Federation of Broward County said in a statement it was ‘another example of how anti-Semitic incidents are expanding across the nation and in our own community.’ It added: ‘Because Broward County is home to the third largest population of Holocaust Survivors in the world, we are acutely aware of what happens when hate is allowed to thrive unfettered and unchallenged. As a nation, we can do better and we will do better.” Bal Harbour Mayor Gabriel Groisman responded to the flyers by saying, “Your flyers do not intimidate us. We are a strong and proud people. There are Jews on all sides of the political spectrum”. Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava’s reaction appeared in Newsweek: “As the Mayor of our beautifully diverse, inclusive and caring community, and the first Jewish Mayor of Miami-Dade County, antisemitism and all acts of hatred and bigotry cut especially close to my heart.” Pasadena Mayor Victor Gordo said, “The distribution of [antisemitic] fliers in Pasadena and other Southern California communities over the weekend is abhorrent and totally goes against the values of our city and its residents.”\n\nBut further revelation shows that the scope of the flyer campaign is considerably larger than reported above: Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO and National Director of the Jewish Anti-Defamation League stated “We’re already living in a moment where we’ve seen a large rise in anti-Semitic incidents … Double the vandals and violence than we did just a few years ago and this weekend, we had these anti-Semitic flyers drop in six different states,” he told CNN. This, apparently, is only the latest flyer effort…as they were similarly distributed last year in at least eight states, reveals the Jewish Secure Community Network (SCN). Thus far we know the flyer has been read by citizens in cities across the following states: Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, North Carolina, Texas, and Vermont. The flyer itself (photographed here) suggests, anti-Semitically, that the top officials involved in the COVID-19 response are all Jewish. It specifically names the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Rochelle Walensky; the Deputy Director of the CDC, Anne Schuchat; the U.S. Coronavirus Response Coordinator, Jeffrey Zients; the Senior Advisor to the Coronavirus Response Coordinator (and Administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) Andrew Slavitt; U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra; the Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, Rachel Levine; the Chief Scientific Officer and President, Worldwide Research, Development and Medical of Pfizer, Inc., Mikael Dolsten; the Chairman and CEO of Pfizer, Inc., Albert Bourla; and the developer of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine (and Chief Medical Officer of Moderna, Inc.) Tal Zaks. The flyer likewise points out that (top shareholder of Pfizer, Inc.[1]) BlackRock, Inc.’s Chairman and CEO, Larry Fink, and President, Robert Kapito, are also each Jewish. *The aforementioned Mikael Dolsten is a top shareholder of Pfizer as well.[2] As CNN reported, the flyer “shows an image of the Star of David along with a list of top government health officials, pharmaceutical company leaders, and heads of investment management companies, which the flyer incorrectly states are all Jewish”.[3] Our fact check here at Controversial? can confirm CNN’s assessment to be accurate. One of the officials named above, Becerra, is verifiably not Jewish. As the Daily Mail noted, the writer of the flyer likely conflated U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) Xavier Becerra with U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS) Alejandro Mayorkas (who is a Jewish immigrant from Cuba[4]). The other officials mentioned here are in fact Jewish (see hyperlinks). But what does that mean? Nothing. Overrepresentation does not prove nefarious intent. (According to the American Jewish Population Project at Brandeis University, Jews comprise only 1.8% of the U.S. population.[5]) Furthermore, this overrepresentation is probably just an artifact of the coincidental overrepresentation of Jews in the Biden administration.[6] And this in turn is merely reflective of the likely circles in which President Biden would naturally travel―it is well known that the President belongs to a “very Jewish family.”[7][8][9][10][11] On top of this, we should also consider that people see what they are looking for (in this case, Jews involved in COVID-19). This is called the principle of motivated perception. In fact there are plenty more Jews involved in COVID-19―if you are looking for them. For example, the developer of the mRNA vaccine (the class of vaccines to which both the Pfizer and Moderna COVID vaccines belong) is Jewish scientist Andrew Weissman. The developer of the BriLife COVID-19 vaccine, Shmuel Shapira, is likewise Jewish. As is the developer of Russia’s Sputnik V COVID vaccine, Alexander Gintsburg. The developer of India’s Corbevax COVID-19 vaccine[43][44][45] is Peter Hotez, another Jewish scientist. The top shareholder[12] and Co-founder of Moderna[13] (whose sole product is its COVID-19 vaccine[14]) is Jewish chemical engineer Robert Langer. The Congresswoman who introduced and sponsored the Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act―the bill which secured $3,000,000,000+ in taxdollars for the development of the COVID-19 vaccines[15]―is Nita Lowey (who was also the Chair of the House Appropriations Committee). She’s also Jewish. And two-of-three Supreme Court justices which voted to enforce the life-saving COVID vaccine mandates were Jewish:[179] Justice Stephen Breyer and Justice Elena Kagan. President Biden’s top science advisor, Jewish geneticist Eric Lander, is a large shareholder of COVID vaccine maker BioNTech[16] and the founder[16] of biopharmaceutical company Codiak Biosciences―which also tried to make a COVID-19 vaccine.[17] One of the most prominent sources of public information on COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccine[18][19][20][21][22][23][24] has been Jewish physician and Pfizer director[25] Scott Gottlieb, who was Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) immediately prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.[26] There’s also Jewish academic David Kessler, another former FDA Commissioner,[27] who was the Head of Operation Warp Speed (OWS)[28]―the U.S. government program which facilitated the development, manufacturing, and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines―as well as the Chair of the COVID-19 Advisory Board[29] and the Chief Science Officer of the U.S. Coronavirus Task Force.[30] Additionally, this Coronavirus Task Force’s other advisors included the following: Lawrence Kudlow, Steven Mnuchin, Alex Azar, Scott Atlas, and Ezekiel Emanuel―all of Jewish heritage. *The Coronavirus Task Force transitioned to the name “COVID-19 Response Team” under the Biden administration.[31] Another task force, the U.S. COVID-19 Supply Chain Task Force was similarly formed and ran[32][33] by Jewish magnate Jared Kushner, the Senior Advisor to the President. While yet another task force, the COVID-19 Fraud Enforcement Task Force,[34] was established and directed by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. Garland’s DOJ so far appears to be successfully combating the fake vaccine cards.[35][36][37][38][39] Garland is Jewish. The previous Attorney General, William Barr (another official of Jewish heritage), is responsible for the COVID-19 prisoner release plan,[40][41] which possibly saved many thousand[42] prisoners’ lives from the ravages of the virus. Jewish statistician Susan Ellenberg oversaw the data and safety monitoring for Operation Warp Speed,[199] along with her Perelman School colleague (bioethicist) Steven Joffe, who also appears to be Jewish.[200][201][202][203] And Jewish lawyer Avril Haines is now famous, as the Director of National Intelligence, for her investigation of the origins of COVID-19. (Though, unfortunately, she’s already informed that she does not expect to determine where COVID came from.[46][47][48][49]) Another highly visible figure during the pandemic has been Jewish professor Eric Topol, an executive at the biomedical arm of news dynasty Scripps[97] and advisor of the board of the COVID Tracking Project[98]―the definitive source of COVID-19 data for the United States.[99][98] Importantly, Topol helped ensure that Donald Trump wouldn’t get a COVID vaccine released (prematurely) before Election Day.[100][101] Dr. Topol was also a foremost promoter of widespread, regular COVID testing[102][103][104][105][106][107][108][109] and, later, of vaccine boosters.[110][111][112][113][114]\n\nAnother luminary to have become especially prominent since the onslaught of COVID-19 is Jewish historian Yuval Harari. From the early days of the pandemic, Harari, a tenured professor at Hebrew University in Jerusalem,[246] has regularly lent his counsel on the world stage.[247][248][249][250][251][252][253][254][255][256][257][258] Already a favorite philosopher of global leaders like Barack Obama, the World Economic Forum’s Klaus Schwab, GAVI founder/director Bill Gates, G7 president (Chancellor) Olaf Scholz, as well as tech titans Mark Zuckerberg, Jack Dorsey, Reed Hastings and other Silicon Valley figures from Alphabet/Google,[259][260][261][262][263][264][265][266] Dr. Harari has become a very popular essayist and commentarian for major news media in the wake of the COVID outbreak.[267][268][269][270][271][272][273][274][275][276][277][278] As the world was mounted by concerns over the pandemic, the professor was there to remind that the biggest danger is not the virus itself but rather those bucking the global solidarity needed to overcome this crisis.[256] He genially offered advice to citizens on how to know which politicians to vote for during the pandemic,[256] and likewise stood up for citizens by proposing that the large surveillance systems set up to check the spread of the virus be matched by equally visible spending of taxdollars.[256] Harari also advised that under-the-skin monitoring could help the public make better informed decisions during COVID,[279][249] and indeed that easily observable biometric data could help us rebuild trust in public health authorities.[279][249] As part of his championing of public health authorities, Harari became a big-time funder of the World Health Organization in the pandemic as well.[280] His influence has become truly global, with Harari delivering the keynote address[281] at the 2020 World Economic Forum, where he is considered top advisor[262][282][283][284][285][286][287][288][289] to Schwab (the face of WEF, who published COVID-19: The Great Reset last July). In fact, veteran journalist Patrick Wood[290] identifies Harari as “the chief philosophical adviser to the World Economic Forum and one of the premiere authorities in WEF circles.”[262] This is an impressive stature considering the power represented at the WEF: as Forbes reported, 119 billionaires attended the Forum in 2020![291] The Forum also has 1,000 member companies, typically consisting of global enterprises with more than five trillion U.S. dollars in turnover.[292]\n\nAnd we’d be remiss if we didn’t note the important roles played by Jewish tech innovators during the pandemic. Few tech outfits have played as critical a role in everyday life since COVID as the e-commerce leviathan Amazon.[293][294] It was Amazon Web Services (AWS) that powered much of the public’s retreat from COVID into digital space, successfully facilitating the mass transition to remote work, e-learning etc.[293][295] And AWS client Moderna used the AWS platform’s analytics and machine learning to develop the COVID-19 vaccine.[296][297] Perhaps unsurprisingly, the head of AWS, Jewish tech whiz Andy Jassy, took control of (the rest of) Amazon during the pandemic, replacing founder Jeff Bezos.[29?][29?] As Fortune magazine acknowledges, Amazon became “the go-to source over the past two years for people around the globe looking for everything from essential goods like laundry detergent and toilet paper to work-from-home necessities”.[294] Since Jassy’s ascension, Amazon has played an active role in discouraging the possibly dangerous COVID treatment ivermectin,[29?] blocking autocomplete search results[29?] and deleting positive reviews for the product.[29?][29?] (In fact, Amazon removed over a million products that claimed to stop the spread of the coronavirus or otherwise treat such infection;[29?] instead, the online marketplace directs customers to the government websites of the CDC and FDA.[29?][29?]) Jassy has worked closely with the government, both in powering the government’s websites and securing its agencies’ classified data,[29?][29?][29?][29?][29?][29?][29?] and as a cybersecurity adviser for the White House[29?] as well as Commissioner of the national security commission NSCAI.[29?] It was Jassy’s decision to shut down social networking service Parler after the obscene Capitol protests during the inauguration of President Biden.[29?][29?][29?] Of course this has not been the only display of patriotism seen from Amazon during the era of COVID. Already running in overdrive, the company worked diligently to produce its own affordable COVID tests for citizens, a collaboration with Beijing genomics firm BGI[29?][29?][29?] that has already received FDA approval.[29?][29?] It likewise created the popular PerfectFit mask, an N95 covering (made of blown polypropylene micro-plastic fibers[29?][29?][29?]) which has been astutely marketed to cloth-mask wearers.[29?][29?][29?][29?] Amazon’s own Adam Siegel is responsible for the innovation, answering―and winning[29?][29?]―the challenge issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).[29?] The corporation also facilitated over 1,800 COVID-19 vaccination drives[29?] in addition to establishing the high-capacity SuperVax vaccine clinic at Seattle, WA.[29?][29?] And it was Amazon Web Services that initiated the “Folding@home” project, which borrows computing power from citizens’ personal computers to run COVID-19 simulations for scientists.[29?][29?] Additionally, AWS created the Coronavirus Genome Sequence Dataset for the NIH.[29?][29?][29?] Amazon is accurately described by NBC News as an “indispensable” part of pandemic life.[29?] The above are only a few of the contributions from Amazon leadership; read more here.\n\nVast amounts of dangerous misinformation regarding the COVID vaccines has been thwarted under the Google News Initiative.[50][51] Of course, the founders, controlling shareholders, and directors[52] of Google are Jewish computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin. Likewise, Google’s CFO is Jewish businesswoman Ruth Porat. And Jewish doctor David Feinberg is the head of Google Health―the division responsible for myriad COVID-related programs, tracking people who may be infected and collecting copious amounts of data for later analysis by health experts.[53] In launching the COVID-19 Vaccine Counter-Misinformation Open Fund,[54] Google has fostered tens of thousands of fact checks for 11 different fact-checking projects![55][56] Indeed since the very beginning of the COVID pandemic, Google has worked directly with more than 100 government agencies and organisations to promote COVID-19 vaccine education and run critical public service health announcements,[57] created 200 new products, features, and initiatives to assist pandemic clinicians,[53] and provided $100 million in advertising for the CDC Foundation and the World Health Organization.[57] Similarly, Jewish social media tycoon Mark Zuckerberg has mobilised his monolithic platform to provide real-time flagging and filtering of COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccine misinformation[58][59][60][61][77][78][79] for his 2.91 billion users.[62] Zuckerberg’s Facebook works closely with the White House to counter such misinformation,[63][64][65] using sophisticated algorithms to detect and flag warning labels on content it has determined may foster vaccine hesitancy[66][67] or support claims that are not yet proven (e.g. regarding the origins of COVID-19[68]). Research shows that the warnings deter an impressive 95 per cent of users from viewing the content.[61] Equally impressive is the volume of content that the network has filtered this way; for example, in a single month (April 2020) Facebook filtered 50 million pieces of COVID-related content.[61] Mr. Zuckerberg’s platform also warns users if they like, react, or comment on the misinformation.[60] Additionally, Facebook has partnered with pharmaceutical company Merck in a multiyear intiative to use behavioral science and social media to create confidence in the COVID vaccines.[69] Through all this, Facebook’s “VP of Integrity”―a new type of position apparently created to oversee “the company’s attempts to find and remove questionable content”[70]―has been World Jewish Congress liaison[71] Guy Rosen,[72][73] who credits the work at Facebook with reducing vaccine hesitancy in the population by 50 per cent![74] Rosen is the founder and former CEO of Israeli analytics company Onavo, acquired by Facebook in 2013.[75][76] And of course there’s Marne Levine, the head of Global Public Policy at Facebook,[204] who is also Jewish. Levine’s a big hitter: director at the National Endowment for Democracy[205] (which we’ll mention again soon), advisor to the Department of Defense,[206][207] and member of the Trilateral Commission.[205][207] Second-in-command at Facebook (after Zuckerberg) is billionaire Jewish philanthropist Sheryl Sandberg, who has vowed publicly to take down any COVID-related content deemed to be misinformation, even when it comes from elected officials.[80] Sandberg is also a former Vice President of Google.[81] Prior to her time at Google, she was Chief of Staff at the United States Treasury[82]…and before that she worked at the World Bank, where she had been hired to assist their chief economist.[83] Certainly the most important fact-checking institution―particularly since the pandemic[84][85][86]―is the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). A centralized authority for fact-checking projects, governing no less than 341 organizations,[87] the IFCN is paid for by the foundations of Jewish icons Craig Newmark (Craig Newmark Philanthropies), George Soros (Open Society Foundation), Carl Gershman and Allen Weinstein (National Endowment for Democracy), and Arthur Blank (Arthur M. Blank Foundation).[88][89] *Google and Facebook have also contributed significantly to finance the IFCN, as has the Duke Reporters’ Lab[88]―a Sanford School of Public Policy project[90] (whose principal benefactor[91] is Jewish lawyer David Rubenstein). As Wikipedia summarises:[92] the IFCN “sets a code of ethics for fact-checking organizations. The IFCN reviews fact-checkers for compliance with its code, and issues a certification to publishers who pass the audit. The certification lasts for one year, and fact-checkers must be re-examined annually to retain their certifications.[93] Google, Facebook, and other technology companies use the IFCN’s certification to vet publishers for fact-checking contracts.”[94][95][96] Since 2019, 88 per cent of this all-important institution’s funds have come from the entities named above.[88] The aforementioned financial speculator George Soros (b. György Schwartz[115]) is also owner[116] of wildly successful COVID test manufacturer Mologic Ltd.,[117][118][119][120][121][122] the world’s leading developer of lateral flow and rapid diagnostic technology.[123] Other Soros philanthropy includes paying tens of millions of dollars[124] to get low-income populations vaccinated against COVID-19. But even these contributions are dwarfed by the work of another figure: David Malpass, President of the World Bank since 2019, has been yet another Jewish force for good during the COVID-19 pandemic. Malpass had long said it was critical that the COVID vaccines be rolled out in poorer countries.[125] Accordingly, he announced that the World Bank would spend 20 billion(!) dollars[126] to “facilitate rapid vaccine deployment through national health systems and pay for vaccine purchases and shipments” throughout the developing world.[127] Indeed the official breakdown provided here shows the World Bank to be a prolific engine of COVID-19 vaccination. The Bank accomplished these ambitious vaccination goals through its procurator COVAX,[128] which has already delivered the billionth dose of COVID vaccine.[129]\n\nAnd recently, Secretary of State Antony Blinken engaged the COVID-19 Prioritized Global Action Plan (GAP),[217] convening an international summit to introduce further coordination in the war against COVID-19.[218][219][220] Blinken’s six-point plan is bulleted by the top-priority “Getting Shots in Arms” effort,[217][218][219] which intends to have 70 per cent fully vaccinated “in every country and income category” (5.5 billion people) by September.[217][219] This follows the Secretary’s formation of (and leadership of) the newly minted Multilateral Leaders’ Task Force, created to monitor and evaluate the progress in worldwide COVID vaccination.[221][222] He subsequently launched the dynamic Global COVID-19 Access Tracker (GCAT) to assist in accomplishing this.[223][224] Blinken has nobly suggested that America should not open its economy or resume travel prior to worldwide vaccination.[225] Antony Blinken is America’s third Jewish secretary of state since Henry Kissinger (the other was Madeleine Albright).\n\nThe world’s most influential think-tank,[208][209][210][211][212][213][214][215][236] the Council on Foreign Relations, has similarly stepped up to lead during COVID, promoting big global changes[216] in response to the pandemic. As many politicos know, the CFR’s role in advising the government is enormous. (Note: “Foreign Relations” is something of a misnomer as the Council’s role is by no means limited to foreign policy;[233] read what CFR’s Richard Stengel has to say about domestic influence.[234][235]) In 2009, speaking as Secretary of State (and former First Lady and U.S. Senator), Hillary Clinton graciously acknowledged that the Council tells the government “what we should be doing and how we should think”.[226] Likewise, storied political writer Gary Allen[227] recognized that the Council on Foreign Relations “unquestionably has become the most influential group in America” (p. 83). Spencer Abraham, the former Secretary of Energy, said: “For over 80 years the Council has played the leading role in guiding American foreign policy.”[228] Abraham ventured further to say that the CFR helped “guarantee” these (American) interests.[228] In fact, the Council actually presides over similar power-broker councils of other world powers, as part of its Council of Councils initiative.[229][230][231][232] Indeed we could say that the CFR is the power broker of power brokers.\n\nThankfully, the CFR is throwing its weight behind some much-needed global health reforms in this fearful age of COVID.[237] This includes support for a new “permanent global health security coordinator” seat at the U.N.,[238] as well as the creation of an “international sentinel surveillance network” for future COVID-like contingencies,[239] which will also have the power to “incentivize health-care facilities around the world to regularly share hospitalization data”.[239] These additions will help authorities prepare for the next global health emergency. The Council’s guidance utilizes U.S. resources for some additional reforms, including support for global allocation and delivery of COVID diagnostics and vaccines.[240] Likewise, the brain trust advises the U.S. to “spearhead the establishment of a Global Health Security Coordination Committee” to harmonize global emergency responses,[241] and requests funding for global epidemiological threat surveillance and response capabilities that is exempt “from any future budget caps and sequesters.”[242] At home, the CFR charges policymakers with funding and establishing a national strategy of testing, contact tracing and quarantine “that can be rapidly scaled up in any public health emergency”[243] and includes the hiring of “tens of thousands of contact tracers.”[243] Additionally, the Council recommends national policy enforcing a state of pandemic readiness,[244] as well as health equity―in particular, to make it standard practice to collect and share data on vulnerable populations, most notably Black Americans, Native Americans, Latinx Americans, low-income families etc.[244] Lastly, the Council on Foreign Relations entreats elected officials to accept their responsibility to communicate, and increase their reliance on, the public health messages of HHS authorities (CDC, NIH, FDA).[245]\n\nThe CFR’s contributions during the COVID era will likely be the most consequential in the long-term. Rapid global response to detected health threats will usher in a new dawn of auto-safety for citizens of the world. Like the other efforts and institutions outlined in this fact check, the CFR is keenly led by Jewish talents, including its Chairman, the forenamed David Rubenstein, and its President, Richard Haas.\n\nThe flyer in question also suggests that three additional officials are likewise Jewish: CDC Chief of Staff Sherri Berger, CDC Chief Medical Officer Mitchell Wolfe, and CDC Director (Washington) Jeffrey Reczek. But while their surnames do appear to be associated with the Jewish community,[130][131][132][133][134][135][136][137][138][139][140] our web search did not find any biographical data that would more directly inform us of their ethnicity. Despite national coverage of the flyer, and its assertion that “the COVID agenda is Jewish,”[141] none of the three appear to have felt pressured to reveal their heritage. And good for them! (If simply having a Jewish name is all that’s required to become a target of these anti-Semites, it would hardly be advisable to offer them further ammunition.) In fact, it’s surprising that the anti-Semites didn’t light on more important officials with even more prominent Jewish names. While not explicitly identified as Jewish (or otherwise), both Stephen Hahn and Peter Marks have particularly well-known Jewish surnames.[142][143][144][145][146][147][148][149][150] Hahn, of course, is the FDA Commissioner that granted emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the COVID-19 vaccines.[151][152][153] He’s now an executive at the venture capital group behind Moderna (Flagship Pioneering, Inc.[154][155]), serving as its CMO.[156][157][158] Similarly, Marks is the Director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, and “is directly responsible for assuring the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of [the COVID vaccine]”.[159][160] As Yale vaccine expert Jason Schwartz put it, Marks is “ultimately the single most critical figure in the COVID vaccine decision.”[161] Now, bigot conspiracy theorists may learn such things and yawp “Jewish plot!” (and again there’s not even any proof that the two are definitely Jewish), but we think two different words ought to be used regarding Jews involved in COVID-19: talented heroes. After all, officials from the United States and Israel have both said that COVID-19 came from a Chinese laboratory[180][181]―not a Jewish laboratory. It’s high time we start reminding the anti-Semites of this. The truth is that we are very fortunate to have the Jewish talents listed above, who’ve contributed so much to help us navigate this unforeseen crisis.\n\nFinally, the flyer refers to index fund executive Mortimer Buckley as a “shabbos goy.”[141] A goy is a derogatory term for a non-Jew used by members of the Jewish community.[162][163] Specifically, a shabbos goy is a non-Jew who is used to perform work that a Jew cannot do due to religious law.[164][165] Famous examples include Colin Powell,[166] Harry Truman,[167] and superspy Roy Bullock.[168] Mortimer Buckley is the head of Vanguard Group (president and chief executive officer[169])―the highly consequential fund manager that has been top shareholder of COVID vaccine manufacturers Pfizer (largest holder and largest mutual fund holder[170]), Johnson & Johnson (largest holder and largest mutual fund holder[171]), CureVac (largest mutual fund holder[172]), Moderna (second-largest holder and largest mutual fund holder[173]), AstraZeneca (largest mutual fund holder[174]), BioNTech (largest mutual fund holder[175]), and Novavax (largest holder and largest mutual fund holder[176]) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some readers may not be aware of the pervasive role that shareholders―especially large shareholders―play in such corporations. Large shareholders are able to control the management of companies by appointing the companies’ directors, removing the directors, deciding what powers directors have, and even by deciding how much a director is paid.[177] Moreover, these shareholders make the decisions that directors are not given power over (even including making changes to companies’ constitutions).[177] Interestingly, Vanguard is also the number one shareholder of BlackRock, Inc.[178] (We mentioned BlackRock earlier because the firm is, in itself, also a top shareholder of COVID vaccine manufacturers: it’s the second-largest shareholder of Pfizer,[170] the second-largest holder of Johnson & Johnson,[171] third-largest holder of Moderna,[173] the second-largest holder of Novavax,[176] and the third-largest holder of CureVac.[172]) This gives Vanguard a kind of super-ownership of COVID vaccine stock. But who owns Vanguard? Apparently, the Vanguard Group has a unique corporate structure,[182][183][184][185] which makes it difficult to discern ownership.[184] Investopedia explains that while other investment firms are publicly traded, Vanguard is special in that it has no outside investors.[185] Indeed, fund analyst Bridget Hughes reports: “Virtually every other fund family has to balance making money for its owners with serving fund owners [but] Vanguard’s shareholders are its fundholders.”[182] This of course means that “Vanguard shareholders” do not own Vanguard: instead, holders in the separate index funds are the true owners of Vanguard. This also means that we cannot simply “look up” the company’s major stockholders (the way we’ve done for all the other companies listed above[186]). But that alone does not sufficiently obscure large fundholders that may wish to exert a specific influence through the corporation. Because any entity holding ≥5 per cent of the fund shares will be disclosed in an SAI[187] (see fund prospectus Part B[188]), large fundholders that want to stay under the radar need to operate below this threshold (as holders of <5 per cent are never reported by Vanguard[187]). But this 5 per cent is a fairly arbitrary number because, as former SEC director Ari Gabinet notes, “Vanguard funds are so large that it is very unlikely any one shareholder, even an institution, owns 5%.”[187] So, any single entity holding, say, 4 per cent of the fund shares would definitely constitute a “major Vanguard shareholder.” And their ownership would go completely unreported by Vanguard. It’s also conceivable that two or more such holders could pool their influence as owners (and push their interest in concert) (and still go undetected). But we’re really drifting into conspiratorial nonsense now. There is zero evidence that any fundholder(s) is/are exerting nefarious influence through Vanguard. Which is precisely the amount of evidence we need to dismiss the contents of this racist flyer. We can’t even identify the fundholders except through blind trial-and-error searches. For example, we did find that Rothschild family investments own millions in shares of Vanguard.[189][190][191][192][193][194] As does Goldman Sachs.[195][196][197][198] But we have no idea how many other fundholders there are, or what percentage of shares they possess. And as for Mortimer Buckley, we still do not know if the author of the flyer is claiming that Buckley is a shabbos goy in the classical sense or simply that his work is serving Jewish interests. There is no publicly available information to suggest a special relationship with Jewish community members outside of fundholders. But that fits quite well with the rest of the flyer’s message, which is to say, uncompelling, unsubstantiated, and xenophobic―and certainly offering no proof that “the COVID agenda is Jewish.” Identifying officials as Jewish is not the same as demonstrating nefarious intent. We rate the flyer’s claim: FALSE.\n\nEarly Omicron Breakthroughs Show mRNA Vaccines’ Weakness (Bloomberg)\n\n“Booster shots with messenger RNA vaccines such as those made by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE failed to block omicron in a study of some of the first documented breakthrough cases caused by the highly contagious variant. Seven German visitors to Cape Town experienced symptomatic Covid-19 infections between late November and early December despite being boosted, the researchers, whose investigation was authorized by the University of Cape Town and Stellenbosch University, said in findings published Tuesday in The Lancet …[T]he findings demonstrate omicron’s ability to evade immunity generated by even the most powerful Covid-19 vaccine boosters. … Vaccines made with new mRNA technology have come to the fore during the Covid-19 pandemic. The shots instruct cells to make highly specific antibodies that block the coronavirus spike, a protein that allows it to enter cells. More traditional inoculations use inactivated or dead viruses to stimulate a response from immune systems. Preliminary data from an Israeli trial involving 154 health workers — released Monday, just two weeks after that study began — showed that a fourth dose of Pfizer’s shot didn’t prevent infection with omicron.” (19.01.22) Read here.\n\nOmicron variant now 99.5% of US COVID cases, CDC says (Fox News)\n\n“Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) showed Tuesday that the omicron variant of the coronavirus is now responsible for 99.5% of U.S. cases. Comparatively, the delta variant reportedly makes up 0.5% …this comes as hospitalizations in the eastern U.S. have fallen – slowing where the variant first hit – and jumped in other regions.” (18.01.22) Read here.\n\nIsraeli study shows 4th shot of COVID-19 vaccine not able to block Omicron (Reuters)\n\n“A fourth shot of COVID-19 vaccine boosts antibodies to even higher levels than the third jab but it is not enough to prevent Omicron infections, according to a preliminary study in Israel. Israel’s Sheba Medical Center has given second booster shots in a trial among its staff and is studying the effect of the Pfizer booster in 154 people after two weeks and the Moderna booster in 120 people after one week, said Gili Regev-Yochay, director of the Infectious Diseases Unit. These were compared to a control group that did not receive the fourth shot. Those in the Moderna group had previously received three shots of Pfizer’s vaccine, the hospital said. The vaccines led to a increase in the number of antibodies ‘even a little bit higher than what we had after the third dose,’ said Regev-Yochay. ‘Yet, this is probably not enough for the Omicron,’ she told reporters. ‘We know by now that the level of antibodies needed to protect and not to got infected from Omicron is probably too high for the vaccine, even if it’s a good vaccine.'” (17.01.22) Read here.\n\nMost hospital patients with Covid-19 have no viral symptoms, review finds (The Irish Times)\n\n“Most patients in hospital with Covid-19 have no symptoms of the disease, according to a review of nine Irish hospitals… The review was carried out by respiratory, infectious diseases and other specialist staff in the hospitals on January 11th.

Just 191 of Covid-positive patients (42 per cent) had symptoms of the disease at presentation. A total of 322 patients (71 per cent) were not on oxygen therapy … Some 27 of the 322 patients not requiring oxygen were not vaccinated – 8 per cent, while 42 of the 130 patients who did require oxygen or ventilation were unvaccinated (32 per cent).” (14.01.22) Read here.\n\n*The Irish Times is the award-winning[1][2][3] daily broadsheet published out of Dublin since 1859.[4]\n\nLocal handling of COVID vaccine troubles breeds medical mistrust (Mountain Xpress)\n\n“A day after getting his first dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine at A-B Tech, Matthew Cash, an asthmatic but otherwise healthy 31-year old from Asheville, developed tiny blisters on his palms. Two days later, he says, the rash had spread ‘everywhere,’ including inside his ears and on his lips, eyelids and the soles of his feet. ‘It itched and it burned and it hurt,’ Cash says. By the fourth day after the shot, he had a pounding headache and shortness of breath. Cash says his eyes, tongue and throat had swollen to the point where he ‘had a pretty hard time breathing or talking.’ He improved after being administered IV steroids at Mission Hospital, but six months later, he still has ‘hot spots.’ Cash says Mission doctors suggested his rash might have been caused by a change in detergent and diagnosed him with an unspecified allergic reaction. When he brought up that he’d recently gotten a COVID-19 shot, he says, they ‘did not want to entertain that it was anything to do with that vaccine whatsoever.’ But according to Cash, nothing else in his life had changed, including his detergent. ‘I’m a constant. … The only thing I did was get this shot,’ Cash says. His allergy doctor in Biltmore Village advised him not to get the second dose, which he has no plans to do. Stories such as Cash’s are supposed to be collected by the federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, a database of possible reactions to shots voluntarily submitted by health providers, vaccine makers and members of the public. (Neither Cash nor his doctors submitted a report.) Despite inconsistent reporting, VAERS is capturing many such events …Federal data, however, is only as good as local reporting. In speaking with Western North Carolina’s county health officials and hospitals, Mountain Xpress found inconsistencies in how adverse events are reported. And a local canvass of online groups, community members and health care providers by Xpress found at least 25 adverse events from the Asheville metro area, many of them serious. Only a handful had been reported to VAERS. Many WNC residents who spoke with Xpress say they shared their negative responses after vaccination with health providers. But they also say their concerns have been minimized or ignored, driving mistrust about COVID-19 vaccines and the medical establishment. According to the CDC, health care providers who administer COVID-19 vaccines are legally required to report any serious adverse event to VAERS, ‘regardless of whether the reporter thinks the vaccine caused the AE.’ No public entity enforces that reporting requirement. After giving tens of thousands of shots over the past year, the Haywood, Madison and Henderson county health departments have not filed any VAERS reports for COVID-19 vaccines. Buncombe County’s health department has filed 20 reports, says Wood, just one of them serious — an allergic reaction that required epinephrine injection and hospitalization. However, some workers with local emergency services say they regularly respond to vaccination-related events. A firefighter with a Buncombe County department, who asked to remain anonymous due to concern for his job security, says his station responds to ‘a couple’ of COVID-19 vaccine reaction calls every eight-day cycle, amounting to between 50 and 100 calls over the past year. ‘In the last week or two, I’ve run more strokes than I usually would in months,’ he says. ‘It’s just insane.’ Most people say they feel tired or want to pass out, he says. If he spots one of those common symptoms, he says, experience has taught him to ask whether that person has recently received a COVID-19 vaccine. The firefighter says that in his view, it’s ‘100% useless to send reports up the chain.’ He believes his department’s fire chief takes cues from county officials, who he says are pro-vaccine. And a Buncombe County EMT, who also asked to remain anonymous for job security, says crews have responded to dozens of calls for people who have had adverse events after receiving the vaccine, including a 20-year-old who got his first dose two hours before he ‘face-planted, unconscious’ while walking into a gas station in Asheville. The EMT says he woke up with neurological issues that have not gone away since. Neither the Asheville Fire Department nor Buncombe County Emergency Medical Services responded to requests for comment …Meanwhile, Henderson County’s health department has asked individuals to ‘self-report’ adverse reactions, says spokesperson Anthony Mundhenk. While he notes that the county has helped some people file VAERS reports, he did not share those numbers. Everyone who receives the vaccine at a Henderson County clinic is given a flyer with instructions on how to report a reaction, Mundhenk says, as is common practice with other county health departments. (Cash and several other local vaccine recipients who spoke with Xpress said they did not remember receiving that paperwork.) Local hospitals were also inconsistent in their description of reporting requirements. In contrast to the CDC’s mandate that adverse event reports be filed regardless of apparent causation, Adrienne Giddens, pharmacy director for Pardee UNC Health Care in Hendersonville, says that providers who treat events that occur after a 15- to 30-minute post-shot observation period are only responsible for reporting to VAERS ‘if they feel the symptoms are potentially a response to the vaccine.’ … Mission Hospital spokesperson Nancy Lindell emphasizes that staff members are only legally mandated to report adverse events to vaccines given at the hospital, not reactions of patients who have gotten the shot elsewhere. ‘If we didn’t administer it, then we’re not required to report. I’m not saying we’re not [reporting],’ she adds. She did not disclose whether the hospital had filed any reports for patients claiming to have had vaccine reactions. Although Mission did not offer the vaccine to the general public, the hospital did vaccinate many of its own staff. Lindell notes that some employees experienced adverse events but she did not provide specific numbers. Almost all of those who shared their experiences with Xpress say health care providers have downplayed any potential link between their adverse event and the vaccine. One 47-year old health care worker in Asheville, who requested anonymity due to fear of professional repercussions, says doctors think she’s ‘crazy’ for believing the vaccine injured her. ‘But I’m not. My body shows what’s going on,’ she continues. She says her life has been ‘hell’ since the day she got the Johnson & Johnson vaccine at an Ingles pharmacy in Fletcher. After two weeks of headaches and debilitating joint pain, her body broke out in blisters that scabbed over. ‘They just keep getting bigger and bigger, on my face, up my nose, in my ears, between my fingers, all over my body. It’s painful to the point where you don’t want to wear clothes,’ says the woman, whose employer mandated the shot. ‘I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy.’ About five months have passed since the shot, she says, but she still cannot return to work in person. She is often bedridden and has developed anxiety, depression and a rapid heartbeat, despite being previously healthy. Doctors have yet to offer a clear explanation for her illness or provide effective treatment. The woman says her social life has been ruined, as she often cannot get out of bed. She says she feels hopeless, alone and afraid to share her story with friends on social media out of fear it would jeopardize her career. ‘Is this ever going to end?’ she asks. ‘Will I ever get my life back, will I ever get back to my normal job, will I ever get to hang out or make plans again?’ Debra and Danny Jones, a married couple in Candler, both believe they were injured by their second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. The 67-year-olds complain that their primary care doctors have disregarded their suspicions and not filed VAERS reports. ‘I’ve had headaches worse than I’ve ever had in my life; every joint in my body ached,’ says Danny Jones, who previously operated heavy machinery 10-12 hours a day and walked 4 miles a day to keep his prediabetes in check but has been forced to stop both activities. ‘I fatigue out at nothing now.’ For months after receiving the vaccine, Debra Jones reports that she had ‘no energy’ and a combination of aches, pains and itching. Just as she began to improve, she had a heart attack. She now believes the vaccine is designed to ‘get rid of’ older people. … (The package insert for Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine lists pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache and muscle pain as the most common reactions. Vaccine reactions reported to VAERS have included seizures, paralysis, blood clots, brain bleeds, heart problems, extreme fatigue, menstrual irregularities, shingles, Bell’s palsy, anaphylaxis, worsening of autoimmune disorders and death.) To Dr. Patrick Hanaway, an integrative physician at Family to Family in Asheville and chair of the national nonprofit Institute for Functional Medicine’s COVID-19 task force, the medical community’s approach to talking about risk may be counterproductive. Questions about COVID-19 vaccines, he says, tend to be ‘minimized’ by authorities ‘so as not to create alarm. … The CDC’s saying, ‘There’s nothing to see here.’ That strategy, Hanaway continues, ‘can lead the public to see legitimate medical research as an agent of the medical-industrial complex, which is not to be believed, which is trying to serve itself, and that’s unfortunate.’ Hanaway believes VAERS signals and emerging studies challenge the idea that the shot is safe for everyone, especially given what he estimates to be a 40-fold underreporting of adverse events. One major study, published in 2011 by Harvard Pilgrim Health Care in Massachusetts, found that fewer than 1% of vaccine adverse events were reported …Some of the limited recording of adverse events by health officials may be due to the delayed onset reported by many vaccine recipients. Because those being vaccinated are typically only monitored at county sites for 15-30 minutes after their shot in accordance with CDC guidelines, says Mundhenk with Henderson County, reactions that occur after the observation period ‘would be difficult to attribute to vaccination’ and are ‘extremely rare.’ An October study published in Toxicology Reports found that 60% of all deaths reported to VAERS in association with COVID-19 vaccination between December 2020 and May 2021 occurred within eight days of receiving the vaccine, an acute temporal relationship. The CDC mandates that serious adverse events occurring within seven days be reported for most vaccines. Hanaway suggests that the technology behind the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines may be prone to generating delayed adverse events. Unlike most other vaccinations, which evoke a response by exposing the immune system to a weakened version of a pathogen, the coronavirus vaccines instruct the body to produce a piece of the coronavirus itself: part of the ‘spike protein’ found on the virus’s surface. According to the CDC, both the messenger RNA genetic instructions delivered by the vaccine and the coronavirus proteins made by the body are quickly broken down. But Hanaway points to a study conducted by Harvard University researchers that found spike proteins can endure in the body for at least a week; he says the true timeline remains a mystery. Those proteins and mRNA strands, Hanaway continues, may cause harm if they linger in the body. A study published by the Salk Institute in April, he says, determined ‘that the spike protein in and of itself induces vascular inflammation.’ ‘We may not yet clearly understand all the mechanisms at play when it comes to adverse reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines,’ [Buncombe County Health and Human Services spokesperson Stacey] Wood acknowledges, although she says ‘stimulation of the immune system’ is one possible cause. Asheville integrated and holistic medical practitioner Dr. Mark Hoch, who has treated three patients for what he believes are severe reactions to the COVID-19 vaccine, calls advising the vaccine for everyone without medical consultation a ‘cookie-cutter’ approach and ‘completely against good medical practice.’ ‘You don’t treat a two-year-old like an eight-year-old; you don’t treat a person with a million comorbidities as you treat a healthy person,’ Hoch continues. ‘There is no standard answer.’ And Sara Fields, a doctor of acupuncture with offices in Asheville and Brevard, says she has treated three patients for what she believes to be long-term side effects to COVID-19 vaccines: an older woman who suffered a blood clot and now has debilitating leg pain and trouble walking; a formerly healthy patient who experienced heart palpitations, can no longer do strenuous activity and now suffers from anxiety and depression; and a patient whose decline in cognition and energy levels have interrupted her ‘daily life tasks.’ Kristi Simmonds, a previously healthy 41-year-old nurse from Mitchell County, says she has felt abandoned by the medical system following her COVID-19 vaccination. A week after receiving the Moderna vaccine, Simmonds had 16 consecutive seizures and was transported to Mission Hospital by helicopter. Nearly a year later, she says she still has intermittent seizures, periodic Bell’s palsy and chronic pain in the left side of her head that radiates down the arm — the side where she got the injection. She can no longer work or drive. ‘I went from being completely independent to being dependent. I can’t be left home alone because some of the seizures cause me to stop breathing, and if I’m home alone, I could die. My husband has gotten very good at bringing me back,’ Simmonds says. After seeing dozens of doctors, Simmonds says, none will confirm her injury is related to the vaccine. Her adverse event report to VAERS does not mention seizures, and Simmonds believes it was altered after submission. She also says that Mission Hospital tried to pin her reaction on a decades-old psychiatric event. Simmonds’ medical records show that a variety of tests at Mission Hospital, including an electrocardiogram, failed to show any irregularities, and she was diagnosed with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures and conversion disorder. ‘They pretty much tried to say she was crazy and report her to psych, so I took her out of the hospital,’ says her husband, Nigel Simmonds. While Kristi Simmonds had mental health problems a dozen years ago after an abusive marriage, she says she has not seen a psychiatrist in a decade and has no history of seizure or tremor disorders. Mission medical staff failed to confirm that she was no longer on psychiatric medication, she says. Mission spokesperson Lindell said she could not comment on Simmonds’ specific case due to patient privacy laws. But she said the hospital treats symptoms as they appear in medical tests, not based on a patient’s claims. Anissa Sain, the North Carolina administrator of volunteer-run RealNotRare.com, says Simmonds’ account echoes many of the themes found in the website’s thousands of self-reported reaction stories. Complaints about doctors, she notes, are common among those claiming to be injured by COVID-19 vaccines. Those reporting to RealNotRare, Sain continues, often say their health providers haven’t read manufacturer fact sheets on the risks posed by COVID-19 vaccines, fail to include a full accounting of post-vaccine symptoms in their medical charts and imply that the suffering from coronavirus infection is greater than that from the vaccine. ‘We are literally begging for awareness,’ she says. ‘Until we get recognition and awareness, we are not going to get the appropriate support and medical care.’ Those who believe they were injured by the vaccine, Sain says, are socially stigmatized and often called ‘anti-vaxxers,’ despite having gotten the shot. ‘Some nurses go so far as to advise people not to mention the vaccine to their doctors, since once a doctor hears anything about this vaccine, we are looked at totally differently,’ she notes. ‘They do not want us on their case list.’ ‘The suicide rate in our group is astounding because of the social stigma and health issues we go through. People live in dark days,’ Sain continues. ‘It’s one of the saddest parts of this.'” (14.01.22) Read here.\n\n*The Mountain Xpress is the award-winning[1] newspaper serving Western North Carolina (WNC), including the Asheville metro area (pop. 469,015[2]).\n\nCovid Scotland: Case rates lowest in unvaccinated as double-jabbed elderly drive rise in hospital admissions (The Herald)\n\n“Double-jabbed Scots are now more likely to be admitted to hospital with Covid than the unvaccinated amid an increase in elderly people falling ill due to waning immunity.

The Delta variant, which dominated the latter half of 2021, is now relegated to only around two percent of cases, the report said.” (13.01.22) Read here.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s Covid Case Confusion (Wall Street Journal)\n\n“[T]he Supreme Court’s performance during oral arguments over the Biden vaccine mandate for private workplaces was hardly the Court’s finest hour. Half way around the world, Australia’s big national newspaper took notice with the headline, ‘Top US judges slip up on facts of pandemic.’ … Justice Stephen Breyer declared it ‘unbelievable that it could be in the public interest to suddenly stop these vaccinations,’ as if he imagined the Biden mandate had already taken effect and was playing an important role in the vaccinating of America. Not true. A large majority of the U.S. population has already been vaccinated; the mandate targets only 25% of the population, the private workforce, most of whom have already received the shot voluntarily or at their employer’s behest. At least half have also likely been infected and acquired natural immunity. And given an average age of 42, this sub-population hardly represents a bullseye on the lingering unvaccinated older cohort most likely to end up in the hospital. In other words, the Biden workplace mandate, even if approved, is destined to have a negligible, almost invisible, impact on either vaccination rates or the unfolding of the pandemic. On the latter point, the well-advertised blunder of Justice Kagan, her statement that vaccination was the ‘best way to prevent spread,’ suggested she hadn’t heard of Delta or Omicron, both of which the vaccinated can transmit. This alone guts the incoherent argument for requiring workers in private workplaces to be vaccinated so private workplaces can be safe for unvaccinated workers. The worst moment was Justice Sotomayor’s claim that Omicron was filling up the hospitals with kids, ‘many on ventilators.’ The Washington Post awarded her four Pinocchios, adding censoriously, ‘It’s important for Supreme Court justices to make rulings based on correct data.'” (11.01.22) Read here.\n\nBreyer phoned in to Supreme Court oral arguments Tuesday due to a false positive Covid test (CNN)\n\n“Justice Stephen Breyer participated in oral arguments remotely on Tuesday after a ‘false positive’ Covid-19 test, the Supreme Court announced.

Repeat booster doses every four months could eventually weaken the immune system and tire out people, according to the European Medicines Agency. Instead, countries should leave more time between booster programs and tie them to the onset of the cold season in each hemisphere, following the blueprint set out by influenza vaccination strategies, the agency said. The advice comes as some countries consider the possibility of offering people second booster shots in a bid to provide further protection against surging omicron infections. Earlier this month Israel became the first nation to start administering a second booster, or fourth shot …Boosters ‘can be done once, or maybe twice, but it’s not something that we can think should be repeated constantly,’ Marco Cavaleri, the EMA head of biological health threats and vaccines strategy, said at a press briefing on Tuesday. ‘We need to think about how we can transition from the current pandemic setting to a more endemic setting.'” (11.01.22) Read here.\n\nCOVID-19: T cells from common colds can protect against coronavirus infection, study finds (Sky News)\n\n“People with high levels of T cells from common colds are less likely to catch COVID, according to a new peer-reviewed study… Dr. Rhia Kundu, first author of the study, from Imperial’s National Heart & Lung Institute, said: ‘Being exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus doesn’t always result in infection, and we’ve been keen to understand why. We found that high levels of pre-existing T cells, created by the body when infected with other human coronaviruses like the common cold, can protect against COVID-19 infection’ …The study started in September 2020 when most people in the UK had not been infected with COVID-19. It included 52 people who lived with someone who had been exposed to COVID, which had been confirmed through a PCR test. The participants did PCR tests at the outset and then at four and seven days later to determine if they developed an infection. Blood samples from the 52 people were taken within six days of them being exposed to the virus to enable the researchers to analyse the levels of pre-existing T cells induced by previous common cold coronavirus infections that also cross-recognise proteins of COVID. The researchers found that there were significantly higher levels of these cross-reactive T cells in the 26 people who did not become infected, compared to the 26 people who did contract COVID. The study – published in Nature Communications – said the T cells target internal proteins within COVID, rather than the spike protein on the surface of the virus. Current vaccines do not induce an immune response to these internal proteins. Professor Ajit Lalvani, senior author of the study and Director of the NIHR Respiratory Infections Health Protection Research Unit at Imperial, said: ‘Our study provides the clearest evidence to date that T cells induced by common cold coronaviruses play a protective role against SARS-CoV-2 infection. These T cells provide protection by attacking proteins within the virus, rather than the spike protein on its surface.'” (10.01.22) Read here.\n\nNo school Monday for Chicago students as city’s COVID standoff with teachers’ union enters second week (Fortune)\n\n“Chicago school leaders canceled class a fourth day in the nation’s third-largest district as negotiations with the teachers’ union over remote learning and other COVID-19 safety protocols failed to produce an agreement over the weekend.

That, Roberts suggested, should probably be a decision for Congress rather than federal agencies. ‘This has been referred to – the approach – as a workaround,’ Roberts said of the requirements. ‘Fifty years ago Congress passed a general provision but I think certainly it’s hard to argue…that that gives free rein to the agencies.’ Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch noted it is states that usually set public health requirements. ‘If there is an ambiguity, why isn’t this a major question that therefore belongs to the people’s representatives in the states and in the halls of Congress?’ he asked. The court’s three liberal justices pushed hard on both the need for Americans to get COVID-19 vaccinations and also what they said is the federal government’s authority to try to mitigate the danger COVID-19 poses in the workplace and to the national economy. Associate Justice Elena Kagan asserted it is federal agencies, not the courts, that have the expertise to make decisions about fighting disease. ‘It’s an extraordinary use of emergency power occurring in an extraordinary circumstance, a circumstance that this country has never faced before,’ Kagan said. ‘By this point, two years later, we know that the best way to prevent spread is for people to get vaccinated.’ . . .Opponents of the requirements have pointed to another Supreme Court case from last year: Its decision to block enforcement of the Biden administration’s moratorium on evictions. A majority of the court ruled that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention exceeded its authority with that policy.” (07.01.22) Read here.\n\nCOVID-19 shots are not vaccines (Washington Times)\n\n“What is a vaccine, anyhow, and at what point is the public health community gaslighting us? Collins Dictionary of Biology defines a vaccine as ‘a preparation … that is used to stimulate an immune response.’ Until about two months ago, Merriam-Webster defined a vaccine as ‘a preparation … that is administered to produce or artificially increase immunity to a particular disease.’ Last May, no doubt anticipating the emerging clarity that what they were selling were not vaccines, the CDC changed its definition of what a vaccine is to emphasize the stimulation of immune response rather than immunity. A ‘vaccine’ is commonly understood to be a product that stimulates a person’s immune system to produce immunity to a specific disease. Vaccines prevent one from becoming infected with a disease and prevent the transmission of the disease to others. I mention all of this only because the recent surge in omicron infections suggests that almost every individual who has received one of the ‘vaccines’ and/or boosters for COVID-19 has the potential of both becoming infected with COVID-19 and, presumably, becoming transmission vectors for the virus. A significant portion of those now testing positive for the virus has been ‘vaccinated’; a sizeable fraction has been boosted as well. Moreover, additional millions have contracted omicron in an intensity below what warrants testing. So, whatever shots we took earlier in the year were not vaccines, at least not as that term is understood by native English speakers everywhere. Consequently, all of the judging and anger that the ‘vaccinated’ directed at their fellow unvaccinated over the last year was largely pointless and misguided. The simple truth is that we have all been unvaccinated, whether we got the shots or not. Someone else’s decision to get or not get the shot had no effect at all on the transmission of the disease and whether you or your mom or friend contracted COVID-19. We have been dealing with a highly contagious respiratory affliction that will eventually infect everyone. The shots changed none of that. The shots are excellent preventive therapeutics, preparing the host body to survive if it is infected. Death and hospitalization rates are pretty clear: Those who have taken the shots have had much better outcomes on average. But the shots are just one set of therapeutics. Others have become, inexplicably, controversial. Without a true vaccine, it is not clear why anyone other than your doctor and your loved ones should care about what course of therapy you choose for any medical condition. It affects other people only in the same way that obesity, smoking, lack of exercise, inconsistent brushing of teeth, etc., affect other potential patients: Lifestyle choices sometimes place burdens on the system that are carried by all of us. That hardly justifies the amount of propaganda and vitriol that has been directed at those who have preferred to avoid the preventive therapy of the shots. The most troubling aspect of the non-vaccines is, of course, that for a year now and up until today, the medical and public health communities continue to describe the shots as vaccines, even though they are not. By refusing to describe the shots correctly as preventive therapies ab initio, the medical and public health communities, intentionally or otherwise, engaged in rank politicization of medical care, lied and continued to lie to citizens and patients, guaranteed social friction, and destroyed their own credibility. Former President Donald Trump is rightly proud of his efforts to scale up personal protective equipment production and develop the shots. President Biden has done well at encouraging people to take the shots, even if under false pretenses. Both did less well at scaling up testing capacity. Both also failed to keep a close check on the ‘experts,’ especially regarding the value of lockdowns (they caused more harm than good) and allowed them to stray too far from the truth in describing the efficacy and true nature of the shots. With its credibility in tatters, the public health cadre will be useless to the United States for at least a generation. If it continues to dissemble even now about something as straightforward as what is and is not a vaccine, how will anyone be able to trust them with questions that are less obvious and perhaps more important?” (05.01.22) Read here.\n\nSupreme Court: All nine justices got COVID-19 booster (Washington Times)\n\n“All nine members of the Supreme Court have received a COVID-19 booster shot, the court said Tuesday, days before the justices hear arguments over President Biden’s vaccine requirements at workplaces…” (05.01.22) Read here.\n\nUK vaccine scientist: Continuous boosters are unstudied and unnecessary (Washington Examiner)\n\n“The head of the United Kingdom’s vaccine oversight body said regular boosters are unsustainable and need more research.

The Biden administration sees its vaccination rule for private employers, which ostensibly is aimed at addressing a workplace hazard, the same way. The contrast between that broader goal and the legal justification for the employer mandate is at the center of the debate about whether the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has the authority to impose it. That debate comes to the Supreme Court on Friday, when the justices will consider whether the mandate should be blocked until the challenges to it are resolved. OSHA’s rule, which it published on Nov. 5, 2021, demands that companies with 100 or more employees require them to be vaccinated or wear face masks and undergo weekly virus testing. When Biden announced that policy in September, he presented it as part of the administration’s plan for ‘vaccinating the unvaccinated.’ MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle on Twitter called OSHA’s mandate ‘the ultimate work-around for the Federal govt to require vaccinations.’ White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain retweeted Ruhle’s comment, reinforcing the impression that the rule aims to reduce the overall impact of COVID-19 by pressuring Americans to get vaccinated. But OSHA has no such authority. Officially, its rule is an ’emergency temporary standard’ (ETS) that is ‘necessary’ to protect employees from a ‘grave danger’ in the workplace. That characterization, if accepted by the courts, allows OSHA to exercise the sort of public health powers that are ordinarily reserved to the states. It also allows the agency to issue regulations that take effect immediately, without the notice, public comments and hearings that are usually required. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, which stayed the ETS the day after it was published, said it ‘grossly exceeds OSHA’s statutory authority.’ But after the challenges to the mandate were consolidated and assigned to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit, a divided three-judge panel lifted the 5th Circuit’s stay, which is how the case ended up at the Supreme Court. OSHA’s sudden decision to invoke its ’emergency’ powers, nearly two years after the pandemic began and a year after vaccines became available, seems dubious. So does its preference for vaccination, which, unlike other workplace safety measures, is not limited to the workplace. Tellingly, OSHA’s estimate of its rule’s benefits is based on deaths prevented by vaccination of working-age Americans, regardless of where transmission occurs. OSHA has never before required or encouraged employers to make vaccination mandatory, even when it issued a COVID-19 ETS for the health care industry in June and when it addressed blood-borne pathogens through the usual rule-making process. Both of those standards dealt with situations where employees faced increased disease risks because of the nature of their work — treating COVID-19 patients and handling biological specimens, respectively. The vaccine-or-testing requirement, by contrast, applies to 84 million employees — two-thirds of the workforce — in myriad industries and workplaces, with little regard to how COVID-19 risk varies across them. And it exempts companies that employ fewer than 100 people, as if the risk of COVID-19 transmission disappears below that threshold. That is not the only puzzling distinction drawn by OSHA. According to the government’s data, middle-aged workers who are vaccinated face about the same COVID-19 risk as younger workers who are not vaccinated. According to OSHA, however, COVID-19 poses a ‘grave danger’ to the latter group but not to the former. It certainly looks like the Biden administration is trying to disguise a general vaccine mandate as a workplace safety measure.” (04.01.22) Read here.\n\nIndiana state lawmaker files bill to ban ‘vaccine status discrimination’ (Washington Examiner)\n\n“…The legislation, Senate Bill 114, would ban businesses from mandating their staff or customers be vaccinated, according to a report.

The next day, she reported severe sensitivity to sound and light, and after multiple trips to multiple doctors, she says medical professionals still didn’t know what was wrong. In the coming months, Dressen’s symptoms worsened – she says she was also experiencing heart and blood pressure fluctuations, in addition to profuse sweating and intense brain fog. … After she reported motor dysfunction and incontinence, her condition ultimately ended up landing her in the hospital. Though her symptoms – which she’s documented with the National Institute of Health – have lessened in recent months and she’s been able to resume some elements of her prior life, Dressen felt increasingly alone in her experience during the time period after receiving the vaccine. That is, until she was able to connect with others reporting severe vaccine side effects through social media groups …It was in these social media groups, which were primarily hosted on Facebook, that Dressen met several other Utahns, Nicole Keddington and Pam Warren – in addition to a slew of others across the world – that were also reporting these symptoms… ‘I was tagged in an article by a family member linking me to [Brianne Dressen] and she pulled me into the Facebook group,’ Warren says. ‘It was at that time that I was finally able to find the right doctors in my area to help with some of my conditions.’ Talking with their peers was a source of hope for each of the women, but as quickly as they found the groups and were experiencing a sort of relief, they say the groups started to disappear. According to the women, community groups and posts were – and still are – flagged by various social media platforms for alleged violations like ‘false information,’ ‘spreading misinformation’ and ‘dangerous acts.’ They say that many of these groups are in their third or fourth iterations due to repeated takedown notices. Dressen has documented vaccine injury-related content removal on Facebook, YouTube, TikTok, GoFundMe, Reddit and Instagram… Facebook has invoked a specific set of rules pertaining to COVID-19 information. According to their help center, they are liable to remove ‘misinformation when public health authorities conclude that the information is false and likely to contribute to imminent violence or physical harm.’ According to the same help center article, Facebook is apt to remove content relating to ‘claims about the safety or serious side effects of COVID-19 vaccines.’ YouTube has a similar policy, though they do not explicitly mention the discussion of adverse side effects like those reportedly experienced by Dressen, Keddington, Warren, and their peers. TikTok’s protocols are also less in-depth. The popular video sharing platform mentions their work to eliminate anti-vaccine and COVID-19 misinformation in their COVID-19 policy statement, noting that ‘calls to action related to COVID-19 vaccines are accepted on a case-by-case basis if they’re in the interest of public health and safety.’ GoFundMe implemented an anti-vaccine policy in 2019, which authorizes the removal of fundraisers ‘promoting misinformation related to vaccines that have been approved by regulatory bodies.’ Although Dressen asserts that many vaccine-injured individuals have resorted to using other crowdfunding platforms, GoFundMe’s policy notes that people can fundraise for ‘medical expenses related to COVID-19 and vaccine-related injuries.’ These misinformation policies – which social media companies say they have invoked to reduce fictitious content relating to vaccines and other hot-button issues – are authorizing removal of posts and groups related to reported vaccine injuries in the same way they are addressing other content that is perhaps more harmful. Dressen, Keddington, and Warren say that they – and the majority of the individuals in the group – aren’t anti-vaccine at all, they just want help. ‘I’m constantly getting these ‘COVID vaccines are safe,’ things pop up all over. I don’t think anyone on the page – we’ve talked about it – is anti-vaccine. We all got [the vaccine],’ Keddington, who received the Moderna vaccine, says. ‘We just need some help.'” (04.01.22) Read here.\n\nJudge Rules In Favor Of Navy SEALs Seeking Religious Exemptions From Covid Vaccine (Forbes)\n\n“A federal judge in Texas on Monday ruled in favor of 35 U.S. Navy SEALs who sued the Biden Administration over the military’s Covid-19 vaccine mandate, marking the first major successful challenge to the Department of Defense’s vaccine policy. District Judge Reed O’Connor determined the Navy cannot disqualify the plaintiffs, or deem them permanently non-deployable, for refusing to be vaccinated against Covid-19 for religious reasons. The ruling cited the First Amendment and the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which prohibits government bodies from ‘substantially burdening a person’s exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability.’ O’Connor called the Navy’s process for considering religious accommodations ‘theater,’ and noted the service has not granted a religious exemption to any vaccine requirement in seven years. The ruling will only apply to the 35 plaintiffs, not the entirety of the military. The Navy did not immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment. ‘There is no COVID-19 exception to the First Amendment,’ the ruling stated. ‘There is no military exclusion from our Constitution.'” (03.01.22) Read here.\n\nJudge blocks COVID vaccine mandate for Head Start program (ABC News)\n\n“President Joe Biden cannot require teachers in the Head Start early education program to be vaccinated against COVID-19, a Louisiana federal judge ruled Saturday, handing a victory to 24 states that had sued the federal government.

The company has approximately 2,400 employees and sells life insurance, including group life insurance to employers in the state. Davison said the increase in deaths represents ‘huge, huge numbers,’ and that’s it’s not elderly people who are dying, but ‘primarily working-age people 18 to 64’ who are the employees of companies that have group life insurance plans through OneAmerica. ‘And what we saw just in third quarter, we’re seeing it continue into fourth quarter, is that death rates are up 40% over what they were pre-pandemic,’ he said. ‘Just to give you an idea of how bad that is, a three-sigma or a one-in-200-year catastrophe would be 10% increase over pre-pandemic,’ he said. ‘So 40% is just unheard of.’ Davison was one of several business leaders who spoke during the virtual news conference on Dec. 30 that was organized by the Indiana Chamber of Commerce. Most of the claims for deaths being filed are not classified as COVID-19 deaths, Davison said. ‘What the data is showing to us is that the deaths that are being reported as COVID deaths greatly understate the actual death losses among working-age people from the pandemic. It may not all be COVID on their death certificate, but deaths are up just huge, huge numbers.’ He said at the same time, the company is seeing an ‘uptick’ in disability claims, saying at first it was short-term disability claims, and now the increase is in long-term disability claims. ‘For OneAmerica, we expect the costs of this are going to be well over $100 million, and this is our smallest business. So it’s having a huge impact on that,’ he said. He said the costs will be passed on to employers purchasing group life insurance policies, who will have to pay higher premiums. The CDC weekly death counts, which reflect the information on death certificates and so have a lag of up to eight weeks or longer, show that for the week ending Nov. 6, there were far fewer deaths from COVID-19 in Indiana compared to a year ago – 195 verses 336 – but more deaths from other causes – 1,350 versus 1,319. These deaths were for people of all ages, however, while the information referenced by Davison was for working-age people who are employees of businesses with group life insurance policies. At the same news conference where Davison spoke, Brian Tabor, the president of the Indiana Hospital Association, said that hospitals across the state are being flooded with patients ‘with many different conditions,’ saying ‘unfortunately, the average Hoosiers’ health has declined during the pandemic.’ In a follow-up call, he said he did not have a breakdown showing why so many people in the state are being hospitalized – for what conditions or ailments. But he said the extraordinarily high death rate quoted by Davison matched what hospitals in the state are seeing. ‘What it confirmed for me is it bore out what we’re seeing on the front end,…’ he said. The number of hospitalizations in the state is now higher than before the COVID-19 vaccine was introduced a year ago, and in fact is higher than it’s been in the past five years, Dr. Lindsay Weaver, Indiana’s chief medical officer, said at a news conference with Gov. Eric Holcomb on Wednesday. Just 8.9% of ICU beds are available at hospitals in the state, a low for the year, and lower than at any time during the pandemic. But the majority of ICU beds are not taken up by COVID-19 patients – just 37% are, while 54% of the ICU beds are being occupied by people with other illnesses or conditions. The state’s online dashboard shows that the moving average of daily deaths from COVID-19 is less than half of what it was a year ago. At the pandemic’s peak a year ago, 125 people died on one day – on Dec. 29, 2020. In the last three months, the highest number of deaths in one day was 58, on Dec. 13.” (01.01.22) Read here.\n\n*A project of Chicago’s award-winning[1] Franklin News Foundation, the Center Square is a newswire service and online hub for state-level and statehouse news.

The public health agency previously estimated that Omicron accounted for 73.2 percent of cases that week… ‘Setting aside the question of how the initial estimate was so inaccurate, if CDC’s new estimate of #Omicron prevalence is precise then it suggests that a good portion of the current hospitalizations we’re seeing from Covid may still be driven by Delta infections,’ [former FDA chief Scott] Gottlieb wrote on Twitter …Meanwhile, former US Surgeon General Jerome Adams criticized the CDC for its decision to cut isolation periods from 10 days to five. ‘I love the CDC.

One is an interim final rule promulgated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (‘CMS’); the other is an Emergency Temporary Standard (‘ETS’) issued by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (‘OSHA’). The CMS interim final rule, presently stayed in 24 states, would require COVID-19 vaccination for staff employed at Medicare and Medicaid certified providers and suppliers. The OSHA ETS, which requires businesses with 100 or more employees to ensure that workers are vaccinated against the coronavirus or otherwise to undergo weekly COVID-19 testing, was allowed to take effect when a divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, to which the consolidated challenges had been assigned by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued a ruling, on December 17, 2021, lifting a stay that had been previously entered by the Fifth Circuit. Multiple private sector litigants and states immediately challenged the decision. The Supreme Court rarely holds oral argument on emergency applications. Generally, they are handled ‘on the papers’ and, more often than not, are ruled upon by a single Justice, who could refer the matter for determination by the entire Court. In the instant cases, the essential issue is whether the Executive Branch acted within the authority delegated to it by Congress.

However, independent experts pointed to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data, which suggested an average delay of nine or 10 days. The claim by Mr. Javid was seen as an attempt to strengthen the case for urgent new Covid-19 restrictions, on the basis that the country could be on the brink of a major spike in hospitalisations due to omicron. Dr. Harries has claimed that omicron was ‘probably the most significant threat we’ve had since the start of the pandemic.’ … The latest UKHSA data show that people infected with the variant were between 50 and 70 per cent less likely to be admitted to hospital than with delta.

Israel became the first country to approve a fourth dose for healthcare workers and elderly people [also on] Tuesday. ‘No country can boost its way out of the pandemic,’ WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said…” (22.12.21) Continue reading here.\n\nOmicron variant is resistant to vaccines, antibody treatments and boosters, study says (MSN)\n\n“A new study suggests the omicron variant of COVID-19 is ‘markedly resistant’ to the current COVID-19 vaccines, antibody treatments and booster shots, raising concern from experts about what’s to come from the variant in the coming weeks. ‘We found (omicron) to be markedly resistant to neutralization by serum not only from convalescent patients, but also from individuals vaccinated with one of the four widely used COVID-19 vaccines. Even serum from persons vaccinated and boosted with mRNA-based vaccines exhibited substantially diminished neutralizing activity against B.1.1.529,’ the study said. The study — which has not yet been peer-reviewed or edited for a scientific journal — found that monoclonal antibody cocktails are ineffective against omicron, too. And natural antibodies from previous COVID-19 infections don’t help stop the virus, either, according to the study. However, the study still recommends vaccination and booster shots to stay safe from the coronavirus variant. Indeed, early data and research about the omicron variant suggest the omicron variant has"
