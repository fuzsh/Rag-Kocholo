        "text": "Good Wednesday morning.\n\nIn today’s Daily Kickoff, we look at how United Airlines’ canceled flights to Israel are impacting Passover travel, and talk to Sen. Angus King about how Iran’s weekend strike has affected his opposition to military aid to Israel. Also in today’s Daily Kickoff: Zach Hyman, Shomari Figures and Amb. Mohamed Abushahab.\n\nThe president and board chairs of Columbia University are set to testify before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce this morning, in a much-anticipated sequel to last year’s heated hearing with the leaders of Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which led to the resignations of two of those presidents.\n\nIn the interim, the committee has sent document requests to six schools, including Columbia, and issued a subpoena to Harvard, which it accused of violating, as part of a broader investigation into antisemitism at U.S. universities.\n\nRep. Virginia Foxx (R-NC), the committee chair, told Jewish Insider’s Marc Rod on Monday that she’s “anxiously awaiting getting more material from them so we can handle our investigation properly” and added that the committee will be issuing an interim report “fairly soon.” Read The New York Times’ profile of Foxx ahead of today’s hearing.\n\nIn a Wall Street Journal op-ed, Columbia President Minouche Shafik said she’s hoping to “begin to find common ground in finding solutions to antisemitism” at the hearing, adding that it is “a job for all of us” to fight antisemitism.\n\nAnticipating a likely question from committee members, Shafik said that calling for the genocide of any people, including Jews, “has no place in a university community. Such words are outside the bounds of legitimate debate and unimaginably harmful.”\n\nShe also said that protesters’ “passion, as long as it doesn’t cross the line into threats, discrimination or harassment, should be protected speech on our campus, especially if it reflects diplomatic, political, historical or policy beliefs,” even if “discomforting to some.” She said drawing a line between allowed and prohibited speech is “enormously difficult.”\n\nShafik added that going forward, she thinks university presidents’ and official university statements “should be limited to issues that speak directly to life on campus” and that schools “should return to [their] core mission.”\n\nThere’s another top talker on Capitol Hill this week, but away from the hearing rooms, as first-quarter fundraising reports begin to roll in. Both pro-Israel and anti-Israel lawmakers brought in significant sums of money, according to the latest reports filed Monday. But the numbers illustrate that two Squad-affiliated lawmakers are in deep political trouble, even as other anti-Israel members look in better shape.\n\nReps. Cori Bush (D-MO) and Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) were easily outraised by their pro-Israel Democratic challengers, even as both incumbents brought in healthy amounts of campaign cash.\n\nIn Bush’s race, St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell brought in nearly $1 million ($960,000) in the first three months of 2024, while Bush raised $678,000 during the same period. Bush is under investigation over allegations that she profited over her own extensive personal security arrangements.\n\nIn New York, Bowman raised over $1 million ($1.3 million) in the quarter, but was still easily outpaced by popular Westchester County Executive George Latimer, who brought in over $2.2 million in the first quarter of 2024. Latimer now has more than twice as much cash on hand as the incumbent.\n\nOther Squad-aligned members fared better. Rep. Summer Lee (D-PA) raised more than three times as much money ($909,000) as her Democratic primary rival Bhavini Patel ($291,000) in the run-up to the state’s approaching April 23 primary.\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) brought in a whopping $1.7 million, easily outpacing her opponent, Don Samuels, who brought in a respectable $400,000 for the quarter. Samuels came close to defeating Omar in the 2022 Democratic primary.\n\nAnd Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI), who isn’t facing credible primary opposition, nonetheless brought in over $1.9 million — a sign that hard-left small-dollar donors are becoming a financial lifeline for the most prominent Squad lawmakers.\n\nMeanwhile, AIPAC’s PAC announced new endorsements of three Democratic congressional candidates: Baltimore County Executive Johnny Olszewski, former Rep. Gil Cisneros (D-CA) and Laura Friedman, who is all but guaranteed to succeed Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) in the House.\n\nYesterday’sInside the Newsroom webcast featured an eye-opening conversation between JI Editor-in-Chief Josh Kraushaar and Stanford University student journalist Theo Baker, who authored a seminal feature in The Atlantic last month about the scourge of antisemitism on his campus.\n\nOne telling quote from the show: Baker said he estimated roughly 95% of Stanford students hold anti-Israel beliefs, and that the ubiquity of antisemitism at the elite university was a revelation for him when he enrolled. Watch the whole interview here.\n\nWhile Israel’s Ben Gurion Airport is open again after temporarily shutting down in light of Iran’s weekend attack, United Airlines, the sole U.S. carrier that had been operating in Israel, has canceled all flights until further notice. Its decision has upended travel plans for thousands of people who had flights booked to Israel ahead of Passover next week. Delta Airlines, which suspended flights to Israel after Oct. 7, has announced plans to resume flights from New York’s JFK Airport to Tel Aviv in June, which a spokesperson said is still the plan, though the airline reserves the right to change its mind depending on current events. Lawmakers, a number of whom criticized the U.S. airlines’ decisions, largely don’t see a role for congressional action to push for restarting flight routes to Israel, Jewish Insider’s Gabby Deutch and Emily Jacobs report.\n\nDelayed decisions: A United spokesperson told JI on Tuesday that flights into Tel Aviv and Amman, Jordan, were canceled that day, but declined to share future plans. “We continue to closely monitor the situation and will make decisions on upcoming flights with a focus on the safety of our customers and crews,” a United spokesperson said.\n\n‘Furious’ customers: Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) told JI that he spoke to Americans and Israelis in recent months who switched from United to El Al as their carrier of choice over the cancellations. “Obviously, all those different executives are going to make their own decisions on it, but the passengers will as well,” Lankford said. “When I was in Israel, it was interesting to me to talk to some folks that are multi-year, whatever level, platinum United folks or others that are now flying El Al,” Lankford continued. “They are saying that even when they [the airlines] were flying again, they [the customers] were furious that they stopped flying, and so they’ve chosen to be able to fly El Al.”\n\nHeard on the Hill: Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) said that while he wasn’t sure if the Federal Aviations Administration could address insurance or security risks involved in conducting those flights, “You’d hate to see the ability to travel back and forth stymied or reduced in any way.” Sen. Mark Kelly (D-AZ), a former Navy pilot, said, “I think private companies and also the U.S. government have to be considering the safety of our population. And you have Americans that are flying to Tel Aviv. I think it’s a concern and it sounds like these two airlines think it’s a concern as well,” Kelly said of United and Delta. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) told JI that he would “do anything within reason to give them [U.S. airlines] the incentives to fly to Israel,” calling Iran’s strike on Israel over the weekend “another sign of” Tehran’s efforts to “isolate” the Jewish state.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans in the House came together on Friday to reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, bucking efforts by the fringes of their respective parties to upend a major surveillance program amid rising geopolitical threats, Jewish Insider’s Emily Jacobs reports.\n\nA bipartisan coalition: The final vote fell on anything but party lines, with 126 Democrats joining with 147 Republicans to reauthorize FISA after House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) made a rare tie-breaking vote to kill an amendment from Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ) that would have revoked FBI’s warrantless surveillance capabilities through Section 702. The Biden administration lobbied hard to kill the Biggs amendment, with both National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and Attorney General Merrick Garland personally reaching out to lawmakers on the fence about keeping 702 warrantless, two lawmakers told JI on condition of anonymity.\n\nNational security fears: House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Turner (R-OH) took to the floor on Friday to document how 702 remaining warrantless is critical to swiftly address imminent threats to the homeland. Turner, who had led the FISA reauthorization push on the GOP side for months, said Friday that the implementation of a warrant would “provide constitutional rights to our enemies” as threats to the homeland grow.\n\nConstitutional priorities: Those who supported the amendment and opposed the final bill without that language described the national security concerns as secondary to privacy rights. Asked if he was concerned about the national security threats raised by Turner, Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-MT), who served as former President Donald Trump’s interior secretary, told JI that, “What I’m always worried about is the Constitution. To me, it’s a scale, right? On one side, you have absolute freedom, you’re gonna look at nothing. The other side, you’re going to look at everything. So, where’s that scale move back and forth for national defense? To me, that scale stops at the Constitution,” Zinke said\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nNo Country is an Island: In the Liberal Patriot, Brian Katulis and John Halpin raise concerns about the dangers of pushing isolationist foreign policy. “Iran’s attack also demonstrates how America’s divided politics and drift towards isolationism among elements of the left and the right directly undermines America’s security, weakens the future defense of our friends in the region, and imperils a clear response to emerging threats from Iran and its proxies. The key policy and political questions involve what comes next — both to anticipate different scenarios and plan for contingencies. … It’s perfectly reasonable in a democracy to ask questions about the nature and goals of U.S. military aid and other foreign assistance. But we’ve reached a point where small groups of politicians on the left and right are blocking majorities in both the House and Senate — majorities backed by the American public — from passing legislation that provides vital defensive assistance to our friends while checking the aggressive and destabilizing actions of Iran, Russia, and China.” [LiberalPatriot]\n\nThreat Assessment: The Washington Post’s Jason Rezaian considers the decision-making that went into Iran’s weekend strike against Israel. “Iran’s leaders, shaken by the killing of top military brass, felt they had to respond with a show of strength. Not doing so would signal impotence to Israel and Iran’s Arab adversaries, as well as a restive domestic population that is increasingly eager to see the end of the theocratic regime. Whether it was designed to cause damage or not, the result was a spectacular failure. Make no mistake, this doesn’t mean Iran is no longer a threat; but the threats it poses are not the ones we usually presume them to be. Democratic countries should be prepared for the kind of personalized terror Iran has exercised against the many people it has deemed threats to the system’s power since its inception. Iranian dissidents, human rights activists, former regime officials, diplomats and journalists — including me — have all been targets of the Islamic republic’s malice. Abductions and assassinations, which are unpredictable and cheap compared with military operations, seem far likelier in the days and weeks ahead than Iran wanting to engage in a kinetic war that would result in heavy domestic casualties.” [WashPost]\n\nThe Case for Striking Back: The Wall Street Journal’s Elliot Kaufman argues that Israel must respond to Iran’s weekend strike, looking at how Jerusalem’s prior decisions to avoid escalating tensions did not stave off attacks. “The miracle of Iron Dome air defenses for years led Israel to tolerate what no other nation would. Worse, other nations demanded that Israel tolerate it, because Israel suffered little damage. When Hamas crossed a line and Israel responded, as in 2008 and 2014, the world quickly came to demand a cease-fire, no matter how strong and unbowed Hamas remained. Better to restore calm. Better to have peace and quiet. Amid unprecedented economic growth, Israelis themselves came to worship calm. Politicians and generals rationalized allowing Qatar to send aid money to Gaza, knowing that much of it was being diverted to Hamas. Why? To maintain stability. … For Israel, it all worked until it didn’t. Hezbollah now diverts Israeli troops from Gaza, holds a region of the country hostage and is strong enough to deter a substantial reply. The Houthis in Yemen, another Iranian proxy, have shut down the Red Sea and barely paid a price. You think this will be the last time they do it?” [WSJ]\n\nChai Scorer: Tablet’s Armin Rosen profiles Edmonton Oilers right winger Zach Hyman, who wears No. 18 on his uniform and is believed to be the only Jewish player in the hockey team’s history. “I observed to Hyman that he had likely been one of the only Jewish members of just about every team he’d ever played on. ‘As you go further the number is less and less,’ he acknowledged. ‘At least on my journey I’ve felt everybody’s been very accepting.’ In fact, Hyman appears to be the only Jewish Oiler in the team’s entire history. Shane Asbell, president of the modern Orthodox Beth Israel synagogue in the river-valley-side neighborhood of Oleskiw, and someone who personally witnessed Gretzky scoring his 50th goal in the 39th game of the 1981 season, couldn’t remember there ever having been another one. Asbell and I toured the light-bathed cylindrical entryway and fan-shaped sanctuary of the 25-year-old red brick Beth Israel building. … He wore a blue-and-copper Hyman jersey with the nameplate in Hebrew. This was not a custom job: The official Oilers team store did a surprisingly brisk business in Hebrew Hyman threads. ‘I know of non-Jewish people with Hebrew Hyman jerseys,’ Asbell said. ‘Wild, eh?’” [Tablet]\n\nTough on Tehran: National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said the U.S. is planning to impose new sanctions on Iran following Tehran’s weekend attack on Israel.\n\nTurning Down the Heat: U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres, speaking to Iran’s foreign minister, called for “urgent de-escalation” to lower tensions in the region.\n\nTehran Threat: Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi threatened a “massive and harsh” response if Israel were to conduct the “tiniest invasion” in retaliation for the weekend strike.\n\nCyber Concerns: Axios explores how cyber warfare may play a role in Israeli and Iranian retaliatory actions following the strike.\n\nBeijing Backing: China’s foreign minister told his Iranian counterpart that Beijing “is ready to steadily advance practical cooperation” and “promote greater development of China-Iran relations” despite the weekend strike.\n\nLegal Moves: Recently unsealed court documents indicate that Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) may put the blame on his wife in his upcoming bribery trial, alleging that she hid information from him and misled him on the legality of her actions.\n\nFigures in First: Former Department of Justice staffer Shomari Figures won the Democratic run-off in Alabama’s 2nd Congressional District, and will face off against attorney Caroleene Dobson in November.\n\nDem Daylight: Politico looks at the divides between the activist left and mainstream Democrats, noting that following Iran’s weekend strike on Israel, positions “are only hardening and further widening the rift between the activist base and moderates in the Democratic Party.”\n\nRunning Interference: Josh Harris’ Washington Commanders hired Kirtan Mehta, the chief of staff to Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-CO), as Harris looks to potentially relocate the team within the DMV; Mehta previously worked for Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) and New Jersey Gov.
