        "text": "Israeli police allegedly used Pegasus spyware on its citizens, Israeli newspaper Calcalist reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe newspaper says that police have had and used Pegasus spyware since 2013.\n\nPegasus spyware is developed by the private Israeli NSO group, a cyber intelligence technology firm.\n\nPolice allegedly used Pegasus to monitor anti-government protest leaders, among others, and did not always obtain the proper legal authorization, according to the newspaper.\n\nMeirav Ben Ari, an Israeli legislator, said that the Israeli parliament plans to ask the police force for an explanation of its use of the hacking tool, according to Reuters.\n\nPolice Commissioner Kobi Shabtai said that monitoring activity “is carried out according to law,” reports Reuters. He verified that the police force is in possession of cyber technology, declining to confirm or deny the use of Pegasus specifically.\n\nShabtai claimed that for each use of cyber technology, “a request is filed with a court, which examines the matter.”\n\nCalcalist said that the police force used Pegasus spyware to monitor “Black Flag” protesters calling for the resignation of then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Shabtai denied this claim.\n\n“This is a very disturbing incident,” said Ben Ari on Israel’s Channel 12 TV news. “Raising concerns about violation of privacy and democracy as a whole.”\n\nNSO technology is blacklisted in the United States. It has been used to spy on journalists and human rights activists in multiple countries, stirring up international controversy."
