        "text": "Brooklyn, NY – Assemblyman Dov Hikind (D-Brooklyn) and Senate Majority Conference Leader John Sampson have announced that they intend to introduce bedbug insurance legislation. Their bill will require insurers who underwrite property and casualty policies in New York State to offer policies which cover the costs associated with bedbug infestations.\n\n“This legislation is long overdue,” said Assemblyman Hikind. “Nearly every day you read another story about a bedbug infestation, be it in an upscale department store, an emergency room, or in a private residence. People should not be forced into financial ruin because of a bedbug infestation. We can no longer allow insurance companies to deny coverage for bedbug infestations by classifying the infestation as a standard maintenance issue. I am proud to sponsor this legislation to give people some peace of mind as they battle this epidemic.”\n\nThe legislation provides that insurance companies must reimburse renters, homeowners, co-op and condo owners who experience a bedbug infestation for all infestation-related costs, including: extermination services, cleaning of the insured’s property and personal property (such as clothing and bedding), as well as the cost of replacing items which cannot be treated or cleaned, like mattresses or furniture.\n\nThe amount of compensation will vary from case to case depending on the amount of damage sustained.\n\nThis bill will also allow residential building owners and condo and co-op associations to purchase bedbug insurance for the entire structure.\n\nSenate Majority Conference Leader John L. Sampson remarked, “Bedbug infestations in our homes, stores, and hospitals are an unsafe, unhealthy, and costly nuisance burdening far too many New Yorkers. This legislation will provide common sense protection for families being denied coverage for bedbug infestation by insurance companies. I applaud my friend and colleague, Assemblyman Dov Hikind, for his vision and leadership in sponsoring with me this vital legislation that will correct an injustice which has gone on for far too long.”\n\nIf the bill passes, it will take effect 90 days after it has become law, and will be implemented by the New York State Commissioner of Insurance.\n\nAmman, Jordan – Anti-normalisation activists on Monday burnt the Israeli flag in front of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities in protest against organised tours to Israel.\n\nThe protest was held by the Jordan Engineers Association (JEA) as part of its campaign to discourage normal ties between Jordan and Israel and in light of increased numbers of organised trips from the Kingdom to Israel over the past few months.\n\n“Visiting Jerusalem and other parts of Palestine while it is under occupation is haram (forbidden) and a blatant act of normalisation,” the Anti-Normalisation Committee at the Professional Associations Council said in a statement distributed during the one-hour protest.\n\nActivists chanted anti-Israeli slogans and called on citizens to support “Palestinian resistance” rather than “squandering resources on leisure trips to Israel”.\n\n“Visiting Jerusalem is very harmful. It helps Israel cement its grip on Palestine and gives the impression that its occupation is legal,” added the statement, made available to The Jordan Times.\n\nA number of Jordanian travel agencies have recently started advertising competitively priced package tours for three-day stays in Jerusalem and other parts of the West Bank and Israel. The highlight of the tours is a visit to Al Haram Al Sharif and Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, where Muslims believe Prophet Mohammed made his ascent to heaven.\n\nVisitors are not asked to acquire visas from the Israeli embassy in Amman themselves, but travel agents coordinate with Israeli officials by providing all needed documents for entry approval, according to tour operators.\n\nBadi Rafayah, president of the Professional Associations Council Anti-Normalisation Committee, called on the government to stop companies from advertising what he described as “dubious religious trips”.\n\n“We call for boycotting all travel agencies that advertise visits to Israel. We also call on daily newspapers to refuse advertising such trips,” Rafayah told The Jordan Times.\n\nThe professional associations have been leading a campaign against normalisation with Israel since Jordan signed the 1994 Wadi Araba peace treaty.\n\nAssociation members who make contact with Israelis or have any ties with Israel risk losing membership in their respective association. Under Jordanian law, professional association membership is a requirement to carry out various professions including doctors, engineers, journalists and pharmacists.\n\nThe professional associations have yet to revoke a membership over normalisation with Israel, officials have previously told The Jordan Times.\n\nBnei Brak – Most Israelis were forced to contend with hot and humid weather conditions over the past weekend, but some people suffered more than others.\n\nHundreds of residents in the haredi enclave of Bnei Brak, near Tel Aviv, remained with no electricity over the past weekend, after the Israel Electric company refrained from repairing a malfunction as not to offend Shabbat observers, Yedioth Ahronoth reported.\n\nA few minutes before Shabbat, a malfunction left dozens of buildings in town without electricity.\n\n“We called the electric company, but the receptionist said they don’t enter Bnei Brak on Shabbat for fear that their technicians would be stoned,” local resident Bela Wolfman said.\n\nOther residents who called to report the problem said Electric Company call center representatives told them of an agreement with Bnei Braq city that prevents company employees from entering the town on Saturdays.\n\n“We spent the whole Shabbat in darkness and suffered the heat. It was terribly depressing,” one resident said. “All the food we had in the freezer melted. By noontime Saturday we had to get out of our home because the heat inside was unbearable. Families who had electricity gave us cold water bottles.”\n\nThe malfunction was repaired only late Saturday, around 9:30 pm.\n\n“They simply pushed one switch up and the electricity was back. I saw it with my own eyes,” Wolfman said. “There are many elderly people and babies here. It’s simply a miracle that nobody collapsed during this terrible Saturday.”\n\nThe Electric Company said that most of its customers asked that the malfunction not be repaired as not to desecrate the Shabbat. Previous repair work undertaken in Bnei Brak on Shabbat prompted great anger among local residents, the company said.\n\nNew York, NY – A federal court in New York ruled late Tuesday that three purchasers can back out of their contracts and get their deposit back on units at a Financial District condo conversion developed by Lev Leviev of Africa Israel. The ruling was unprecedented in the state because the plaintiffs used an old federal consumer law to sue the developer. Condo buyers have won similar cases in Florida, Alabama and North Carolina, but this is a first in New York.\n\nIn his ruling the judge for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York ordered the developer of 163-unit District, located at 111 Fulton St., to return the deposits put down by the three purchasers. The purchasers are expected to collectively receive $300,000 in deposits, according to Lawrence Weiner, of the law firm of Wilentz Goldman & Spitzer, who represented the plaintiffs in the case. The buyers signed contracts in 2007 and 2008 and filed the joint lawsuit against Leviev Fulton Club last year.\n\nThe court ruled that the developer did not comply with the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act (ILSA), which requires developers of buildings with more than 100 units to register the project with the U.S. Department of Housing and Development and provide written disclosures to potential buyers before purchase contracts are signed. If developers do not comply with this, buyers have the right to rescind on their contract within two years of signing it.\n\nThe plaintiffs in this case claim that Leviev failed to provide them with written disclosures, according to the court filing. Meanwhile, the developer argued that it was exempt from following ILSA because it had completed constructing the units within two years of the buyers signing the contract.\n\nLeviev and the developer’s attorney, Yevgeny Tsyngauz, could not be reached immediately for comment.\n\n“Developers are trying to make the argument that ILSA does not apply to new construction,” said Mr. Weiner, who is representing clients in similar cases at nine other buildings in Manhattan and Brooklyn. “This decision reaffirms that it does apply.”\n\nEarlier this year, a Virginia federal judge granted a couple the right to back out of their contract for a new house yet to be built. The couple in that case had taken out a construction loan to build a $5 million home but developer Ritz-Carlton decided to drop the project plans, so the couple sued the company, according to the published reports.\n\nThe latest New York ruling in favor of condo purchasers is counter to past rulings, which have been in favor of developers. The developers of Fifth on the Park in Harlem and One Hunters Point in Long Island City, Queens faced similar suits involving ILSA but in both of those cases the judge ruled that the developers were exempt from ILSA because of the number of units that were sold at the time. Mr. Weiner, who also represents buyers in those cases, said they have appealed that ruling.\n\nParis – A well-informed French official revealed to Asharq Al-Awsat that following the armed confrontation that took place along the border between Israel and Lebanon last week between the Israeli and Lebanese armies, the Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak informed French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner via a telephone call that Israel “intends to undertake a large-scale military operation” to teach the Lebanese army a lesson and “to avenge the killing of a senior Israeli officer.”\n\nThe source revealed that this led to communications at the highest level, involving French President Nicolas Sarkozy and US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, as well as Egyptian, Jordanian, and other Arab and international officials, who attempted to reduce the tensions in the region to prevent a second military conflict [between Israel and Lebanon]. The success of this pressure could be seen in the statement made by [Ehud] in which he asserted that “Israel didn’t plan the incident, nor did the Lebanese army.”\n\nAccording to the French official, the fact that Hezbollah did not intervene or get involved in the military action also “pushed Lebanon away from a new war which would have been started as a result of one side or another’s misconception.”\n\nThe French official told Asharq Al-Awsat that Israel believes that “it is not in its interests to go to war with the Lebanese army” because it is aware that it is the only party that can “solve the issue of southern Lebanon and enforce the country’s rule in this area.”\n\nThe French source said that Paris was glad that this issue had been resolved. Despite France’s concern towards Lebanon with regards to the Hariri tribunal and the position of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon [UNIFIL] and the general situation in the south, not to mention the internal political tensions, the source said that Paris is relieved that the situation will remain calm and stable, and any emerging crises will be able to be brought under control. The French official described the situation in Lebanon to Asharq Al-Awsat by saying that “at the present time, there is no civil war in Lebanon, and there is no regional war, and there are no crises with Syria.”\n\nAsharq Al-Awsat also learnt that Israel contacted Paris via diplomatic channels to ask France to stop supplying Lebanon with arms, saying that these arms had been used against the Israeli forces, and that they could potentially fall into the hands of Hezbollah. The French source told Asharq Al-Awsat that Paris’ response was clear, and that France is committed to the defense pact that was signed between France and Lebanon in Beirut in 2008, and that Paris “does not see any problem” in continuing to apply this. The source said that Paris sees this as an integral part of implementing UN resolution 1701 that calls for strengthening the legitimate armed forces of Lebanon, in order for the authority of the Lebanese state to be extend across all of Lebanon’s territory. The French official also revealed that Paris had informed the Israelis [in response to the Israeli request] that its arms deal with Lebanon “is completely in accordance with the requirements of international legitimacy and France’s obligations [to Lebanon] and regional stability, as well as France’s vital interests in the region.” According to the French official source, the Israeli request was rejected, and the source told Asharq Al-Awsat that “France is not America” in an implicit reference to the influence of the Israeli lobby in US Congress and the Senate.\n\nThe French source also told Asharq Al-Awsat that Frances political position is one of supporting Lebanon militarily, and this is something that President Nicolas Sarkozy, Prime Minister [Francois] Fillon, and Defense Minister Herve Morin, confirmed to Lebanese officials on more than one occasion. Asharq Al-Awsat also asked about the delay in Paris supplying Lebanese Gazelle helicopters with missiles, the French official responded that Lebanon “is suffering from a problem of financing.” He denied that Paris was sending weapons and arms to Lebanon with strict conditions on how and against whom they can be used. He said that the Lebanese position with regards to what it wants or does not want these arms to be used for is chaotic, and that “there is internal conflict in Lebanon.”\n\nAs for the issue of the international Hariri tribunal, the French official said that the war that Hezbollah is carrying out against this tribunal “will remain a media and legal war and will not become a war in the streets of Beirut.” The French source said that Paris believes that “there will be no disruption of the international tribunal or its decision” and that “there is no party, domestic, regional or international, that is able to influence the tribunal and force it to accuse this party or that, or to delay or increase the speed of its operations.”\n\nIn the wake of the accusations leveled by Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah towards Israel with regards to the assassination of Rafik Hariri, and his repeated criticism of the Hariri tribunal which he described as being a US – Israeli tool, the assistant spokeswoman to the French Foreign Ministry reiterated France’s support for “international justice” and stressed that Paris has always worked to combat impunity.\n\nDillingham, AK – Former Sen. Ted Stevens lay dead in the mangled fuselage of the plane. A 13-year-old boy escaped death but watched his father die a few feet away. Medical workers spent the miserable night tending to survivors’ broken bones amid a huge slick of fuel that coated a muddy mountainside.\n\nThe gruesome details of the plane crash that killed Stevens and four others emerged as investigators tried to figure out how the float plane crashed into a mountain during a fishing trip. Three teenagers and their parents were on the plane, including the former head of NASA.\n\nAuthorities were studying weather patterns to understand if overcast skies, rain and gusty winds played a role in a crash that claimed the life of the most revered politician in Alaska history.\n\nThe Republican was remembered as a towering political figure who brought billions of dollars to the state during his 40 years in the Senate — a career that ended amid a corruption trial in 2008. He was later cleared of the charges.\n\nA pilot who was one of the first to arrive at the scene described a horrific scene of airplane wreckage, fuel, rainy weather, dead bodies and frightened survivors.\n\nAs he helped shuttle a doctor and two EMTs to the scene about three hours after the crash, Tom Tucker described seeing a survivor still strapped in the front seat with the nose of the plane disintegrated. His head was cut, and his legs appeared to be broken.\n\n“The front of the aircraft was gone,” Tucker said. “He was just sitting in the chair.”\n\nHe and other responders made a tarp tent over the missing cockpit to keep him dry. It was rainy and cold, and he believes the passengers’ heavy duty waders protected them when they went into shock.\n\n“These individuals were cold. We covered them up with blankets and made them as comfortable as we could.”\n\nMaster Sgt. Jonathan Davis, one of the first National Guardsmen to reach the crash site, told ABC’s “Good Morning America” that the waders helped the injured by acting “as sort of a survival-type blanket,” keeping body heat in and water out.\n\nThe flights at Dillingham are often perilous through the mountains, even in good weather. NTSB chairwoman Deborah Hersman said weather conditions at the time of the accident included light rain, clouds and gusty winds.\n\nThe federal investigation is still in its early stages, and it’s too early to say what caused the crash, Hersman said.\n\n“We’re certainly looking at weather, but everything’s on the table right now and we haven’t ruled anything out,” Hersman told CNN on Wednesday morning. She said investigators had not yet been able to talk to the crash survivors.\n\nHersman said the group had eaten lunch at a lodge and boarded a 1957 red-and-white float plane between 3 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. local time for a trip to a salmon fishing camp. The FAA had previously said the plane took off between 1 p.m. and 2 p.m.\n\nLodge operators called the fish camp at 6 p.m. to inquire when the party would be returning for dinner, but were told that they never showed up. Civilian aircraft were dispatched, and pilots quickly spotted the wreckage a few miles from the lodge, Hersman said.\n\nThe doctor and EMTs were flown to the area and hiked to the wreckage as fog and rain blanketed the area and nightfall set in, making it impossible for rescue officials to reach the scene until daybreak.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said the DeHavilland DHC-3T was registered to Anchorage-based General Communications Inc., a phone and Internet company.\n\nThe victims were identified as Stevens; pilot Theron “Terry” Smith, 62, of Eagle River; William “Bill” Phillips Sr.; Dana Tindall, 48, an executive with GCI; and her 16-year-old daughter Corey Tindall.\n\nThe four survivors were former NASA administrator Sean O’Keefe and his teenage son; William “Willy” Phillips Jr., 13; and Jim Morhard, of Alexandria, Va. They were taken to Providence Hospital in Anchorage with “varying degrees of injuries,” Alaska State Troopers said on Tuesday.\n\nFormer NASA spokesman Glenn Mahone said O’Keefe, 54, and his son had broken bones and other injuries.\n\nSean O’Keefe was listed in critical condition late Tuesday afternoon, while son Kevin was listed in serious condition and sleeping.\n\nStevens and O’Keefe were fishing companions and longtime Washington colleagues who worked together on the Senate Appropriations Committee that the Republican lawmaker led for several years. Stevens became a mentor to the younger O’Keefe and they remained close friends over the years. Morhard and the elder Phillips also worked with Stevens in Washington.\n\nPlane crashes in Alaska are somewhat common because of the treacherous weather and mountainous terrain. Many parts of the state are not accessible by roads, forcing people to travel by air to reach their destinations.\n\n“It’s just a reality of Alaska life and unfortunately it caught up with him,” Stevens family spokesman Mitch Rose said on NBC’s “Today.”\n\nStevens was one of two survivors in a 1978 plane crash at Anchorage International Airport that killed his wife, Ann, and several others.\n\nStevens was a legend in his home state, where he was known as “Uncle Ted.” The wiry octogenarian was appointed in December 1968 and became the longest-serving Republican in Senate history.\n\nNina Corbett, co-owner of the Windmill Grille in Dillingham, was saddened by the loss of Stevens.\n\n“We’re such a youthful state,” she said Tuesday night while taking a break from serving pizza, hot sandwiches, tap beer and wine from a box to visiting fishmeran in the restaurant along the road to the town’s airport.\n\n“He’s the only senator we’ve ever known.”\n\nWashington – A combative Rep. Charles Rangel told the House on Tuesday he’s not resigning despite 13 charges of wrongdoing and demanded the ethics committee not leave him “swinging in the wind.”\n\nRangel, who is 80, spoke without notes in an extraordinary, often emotional 37-minute speech that defied his lawyers’ advice to keep quiet about his case.\n\nThe New York Democrat and 40-year House veteran had a sharp message in dismissing fellow Democrats who, worried about election losses, want him to quit: “If I can’t get my dignity back here, then fire your best shot in getting rid of me through expulsion.”\n\nExpulsion is the harshest penalty that can result from an ethics case. It would be highly unlikely in Rangel’s case because the former chairman of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee is not accused of corruption. The four-member ethics panel that investigated Rangel suggested a reprimand, a statement of wrongdoing voted by the House, but that is only a recommendation to the ethics committee.\n\nSeveral hours after Rangel spoke from the front of a half-full House chamber, Speaker Nancy Pelosi made clear in a written statement that she wasn’t pleased with the congressman’s choice of venue.\n\n“As I have repeatedly stated, the independent, bipartisan ethics committee is the proper arena for ethics matters to be discussed,” she said. “The process is moving forward in a way that will ensure that the highest ethical standards are upheld in the House of Representatives.”\n\nPelosi faces the possibility of the House losing its majority in November. The Rangel ethics case isn’t helping, nor are unrelated charges that Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., improperly tried to help a bank where her husband had a financial interest. Waters is a senior member of the Financial Services Committee.\n\nRangel, who said he has lost much sleep during the two-year investigation, was interrupted by applause twice — including when he said: “I am not going away. I am here.” A few Republicans clapped, but most support came from Democrats.\n\nThe Democrat from Harlem acknowledged that he made mistakes, especially in belatedly reporting hundreds of thousands of dollars in assets and income, but he insisted he was not corrupt. And he insisted the committee overstated the seriousness of his solicitations of businesses and foundations for the Charles Rangel Center at City College of New York.\n\nThose solicited had major legislative issues before Rangel’s committees, and the charges said “reasonable persons” could construe the donations as influencing Rangel’s actions. Rangel said he was only guilty of “grabbing the wrong stationery” — a reference to solicitations he sent on his official letterhead.\n\nSeveral Republican lawmakers embraced Rangel’s call for swifter handling of ethics cases.\n\n“Two years is longer than a normal criminal case usually takes,” said Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif. He said charges against Rangel should have been brought much earlier.\n\nRep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., said Rangel drove home the point that lawmakers deserve “a fair process” when ethics allegations arise.\n\n“I’m not asking for leniency. I’m asking for exposure of the facts,” Rangel said in demanding that the ethics panel expedite the hearing of his case.\n\nRangel noted the committee is scheduled to convene Sept. 13, the day before his primary election, but that the main part of his ethics trial would not come until later in the fall.\n\n“Don’t leave me swinging in the wind until November,” he demanded.\n\nRangel, known for his friendly, backslapping demeanor but also his toughness on legislative issues, said he had his own interpretation of President Barack Obama’s remarks in a CBS interview on July 30. The president said: “He’s somebody who’s at the end of his career. I’m sure that what he wants is to be able to end his career with dignity. And my hope is that it happens.”\n\nRangel said, “When the president said he wanted me to end my career in dignity, he didn’t put a time limit on it.”\n\nWhite House spokesman Bill Burton would not elaborate on what Obama meant, including whether the president was sending Rangel a not-so-veiled suggestion that he leave Congress.\n\n“I think the president’s words speak for themselves,” Burton said.\n\nRangel said his legal bills have reached nearly $2 million and he can’t afford to keep paying — especially when “nobody is going to read the defense.”\n\nIn addition to solicitations of donors who lobbied Rangel’s committees, he’s also accused of belated payment of taxes from income on his rental unit at a Dominican Republic resort; the inexcusable — Rangel’s word — failure to file his disclosure statements on time; and of taking advantage of a New York rent subsidy for residential units, by using a Harlem apartment as a campaign office.\n\n“In the haste of sending out hundreds of letters” to donors for the Rangel Center at City College of New York, Rangel said there “has to be a penalty for grabbing the wrong stationery.” He quickly added, “It may be stupid, it may be negligent, but it’s not corrupt.”\n\nHe said the office set aside for him at the center is hardly a gift.\n\n“Who the heck needs an office … in a broken-down building?” he asked.\n\nWatch the full 30 minute speech below\n\nNorfolk, VA – Two years after the founder and chief operating officer of WexTrust Capital were arrested and charged with securities fraud, the criminal case against the pair is approaching a resolution.\n\nIn April, Steven Byers, the founder and former CEO of WexTrust, pleaded guilty to reduced charges and agreed to forfeit $9.2 million, the amount traceable to the fraud offenses cited in his plea agreement. Joseph Shereshevsky, WexTrust’s former chief operating officer and head of the firm’s Norfolk office, has denied any wrongdoing. He is scheduled to stand trial on Oct. 18.\n\nThe two were arrested by the FBI on Aug. 11, 2008. Prosecutors contended they bilked investors, including several from the Hampton Roads Orthodox Jewish community, through a Ponzi-like scheme and diverted millions of dollars to unauthorized uses.\n\n“We have faked it until we made it for long enough and now we must clean up,” Shereshevsky said in a March 2008 message to Byers, according to government documents made public after the arrests.\n\nByers, 48, is out on bail pending a sentencing hearing on Oct. 27. Shereshevsky, 54, who wasn’t able to meet the court’s bail requirements, is in federal custody in New York City.\n\nIn a separate complaint filed on Aug. 11, 2008, the Securities and Exchange Commission alleged that Shereshevsky, Byers and their Chicago-based firm defrauded about 1,900 investors of $100 million. WexTrust and its two officers, according to the SEC, commingled investors’ money for specific projects, sometimes paying dividends to earlier investors with money collected from more recent investors. Both cases are being heard in federal court in Manhattan.\n\nThe slow pace of the criminal case stemmed partly from changes in attorneys. Shereshevsky’s initial attorney, John C. Meringolo, asked the court in December 2008 to be released because, he said, Shereshevsky hadn’t paid for his legal services and failed to follow instructions.\n\nRichard H. Rosenberg, a court-appointed attorney currently representing Shereshevsky, said they are preparing for trial. He declined to say whether Shereshevsky was weighing a plea agreement.\n\nAs part of the trial preparations, Shereshevsky asked the court in February to have prosecutors strike references to a “Ponzi scheme” in his indictment and asked that prosecutors be ordered to provide advance notice of all evidence that they intend to introduce at a trial. The court has not yet ruled on the request, which prosecutors opposed.\n\nRosenberg said he doesn’t expect Byers to testify against Shereshevsky.\n\nWexTrust promoted an array of investments, including stakes in office buildings, apartments, warehouses, high-yield bond funds, commodity funds and African diamond mines.\n\nIn one of its real estate deals, Shereshevsky and Byers raised more than $9 million from investors to buy buildings that would be leased to the federal government. However, the pair never bought the buildings and instead put the money toward unauthorized uses, prosecutors contend.\n\nShereshevsky, with help from subordinates in WexTrust’s Norfolk office and others, raised millions of dollars from Hampton Roads residents, including members of the region’s Orthodox Jewish community.\n\nSince the arrests two years ago, some local investors have followed each twist and turn in the cases against Shereshevsky and Byers. A few have traveled to Manhattan to attend hearings.\n\nHowever, the interest among many investors appears to have waned as the cases dragged on. Patti Robertson, a Virginia Beach resident who invested with her husband in a handful of WexTrust projects, was instrumental in bringing investors together to share information about the cases and efforts to recover investors’ money. She occasionally fields an inquiry or two about the cases but no longer monitors WexTrust matters as closely as she once did, Robertson said.\n\nA core group of local investors routinely exchange e-mails on WexTrust matters, but Stewart Smokler of Virginia Beach said his interest in the cases dwindled because the likelihood that he would recover anything significant from his investments appeared slim.\n\n“I don’t expect anything earth-shaking” to emerge from the court action, Smokler, a retiree who worked briefly in WexTrust’s Norfolk office, said.\n\nOn the day that Shereshevsky and Byers were arrested, the court appointed a receiver to track down and protect WexTrust assets. In the process of gathering these assets, the receiver devised a plan for distributing some of the recovered money to investors. The plan received the court’s blessing more than a year ago but was challenged late last year by an investor in WexTrust’s commodity funds.\n\nThe receiver’s plan for an initial distribution of $5 million to WexTrust investors is on hold while the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit considers the appeal.\n\nMontreal – School officials in tight-knit Côte St. Luc say they’ll be ready to offer support to grieving teens who knew Shirel Attar.\n\nThe 14-year-old girl was killed Monday, and her brother, 18, was charged Tuesday with first-degree murder in the case, (reported here).\n\nClasses at the Jewish School JPPS-Bialik school -which Shirel attended through grade school and until the 2008-09 school year, as a Grade 7 student -don’t resume until Aug. 27. But school officials met yesterday to plan how best to respond, explained Elizabeth Kennell, the school’s director of advancement.\n\nKennell said although many of Shirel’s friends might already know about what happened because of social networking and texting, the environment at the school, which has 1,100 students, could be quite challenging.\n\n“We would not avoid dealing with this,” Kennell said. “It’s critical to address it right away. Her friends will probably be devastated and many of them will be affected. We’ll have counsellors for them.\n\n“It’s important that we learn about what happened,” she added, “so that we can allay their fears.”\n\nThere was no comment from Hebrew Academy, where Shirel’s brother was a student until he graduated last year, or from a staff member at Marymount Academy, where Shirel was most recently a student, in the\n\n2009-10 academic year. Senior managers of both schools were said to be away on vacation.\n\nHanna, a 15-year-old counsellor for a day camp taking place at Bialik, said yesterday she did not know Shirel, but that the killing will likely be tough to take for many in the area’s Jewish community.\n\n“It’s a big shock,” said Hanna, who spoke on condition her last name not be published. “I was just thinking last night how protective parents are and that we’re always saying, ‘We want our freedom.’ When my father heard about this, he said, ‘You see, this is why we are so protective.’ ”\n\nFellow counsellor Elie Ohayon, 17, said he heard about the stabbing “within an hour” on Facebook.\n\nMyron Carls, the day camp’s manager, heard about it from a friend who texted him. Carls said many Jews in the neighbourhood will have a personal reaction even if they didn’t know the Attar family.\n\n“It affects you like you lost one of your own,” said the 38-year-old father of three children under the age of 10. “Everybody in the community will unite to help out the family in some way if they can.”\n\nCarls said he knows there will be questions about the incident from kids in his day camp, who are between the ages of 5 and 13.\n\n“Something like this, they don’t know how to relate. They think in terms of movies or video games. We have to figure out what to say. Until we do, we’ll keep the kids focused on other things.”\n\nAt Confederation Park, about two blocks from the Attar home, news about the killing shocked Carrie Burns, 37, who was in the playground with her 16-month-old daughter Lauryn.\n\n“I’m very surprised,” she said about the location of the killing, in her neighbourhood and on a street with large homes and SUVs.\n\n“It really makes you think,” said Burns, who also has a 17-year-old daughter. “I trust her and her friends, but you never know who she might end up meeting.”\n\nBavaria, Germany – The Justice Minister is looking into the possibility of jailing an 88-year-old man who was convicted of Nazi war crimes in the Netherlands more than 60 years ago, the Justice Ministry said.\n\n“The ministry thinks it might be possible to enforce the Dutch sentence in Germany,” spokesman Ulrich Staudigl said. Former SS member Klaas Carel Faber was convicted on several counts of murder in 1947, but fled to Germany in 1952 and has lived freely in Bavaria for decades.\n\nJustice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger has asked Bavarian authorities re-examine the case, Staudigl said.\n\nHowever, Bavarian prosecutors in Ingolstadt and Munich who have dealt with the case told The Associated Press that, without new evidence or a renewed request for help by the Netherlands, no action can be taken.\n\n“Judging from current knowledge, we have no option to do anything,” said Helmut Walter of the prosecutor’s office in Ingolstadt, where Faber lives.\n\nLikewise, Munich prosecutor Thomas Steinkraus-Koch said the evidence currently available is not enough to reopen the case.\n\nFaber, who was born in 1922, is currently number 5 on the Simon Wiesenthal Center’s “most wanted Nazi war criminals.” The Wiesenthal Center, based in Los Angeles, works to hunt down Nazi criminals and fight anti-Semitism.\n\nAccording to the Center, Faber volunteered for Hitler’s SS, a paramilitary organization loyal to Nazi ideology, during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands in the 1940s.\n\n“He came from a Dutch Nazi family,” the Wiesenthal Center’s Jerusalem branch director, Efraim Zuroff, told the AP in a telephone interview from Jerusalem. “He was a Nazi,” he said of Faber.\n\nIn 1947, a Dutch court sentenced Faber to death on at least 11 counts of murder as a member of an execution squad that killed Dutch resistance members, Nazi opponents, and people who hid Jews, Zuroff said. The sentence was commuted to life in prison in 1948. Faber escaped to Germany in 1952.\n\nTwo years later, a German court in Duesseldorf decided not to extradite Faber. He was legally considered German because of his former SS affiliation, Munich prosecutor Steinkraus-Koch said.\n\nIn 1957, another Duesseldorf court decided against opening a German trial against Faber because it said it did not have enough evidence to prove his crimes, Steinkraus-Koch said. Faber was allowed to walk free and, according to media reports, the father of three went on to work for automaker Audi in Ingolstadt until he retired.\n\nIn 2004, a court in Ingolstadt turned down a Dutch request to enforce Faber’s life sentence in Germany. The court cited the 1957 Duesseldorf decision not to try Faber, Steinkraus-Koch said.\n\nTwo years later, in 2006, Munich prosecutors received new evidence from the Netherlands and looked into reopening the files. Weighing the evidence, prosecutors found that the former SS man may have been guilty not of murder but only of manslaughter — and the statute of limitations for that crime had expired, Steinkraus-Koch said.\n\nOnly if new evidence is received showing that Faber might be guilty of murder could there be another full-blown investigation, he said. And the Ingolstadt court might reconsider its 2004 decision not to enforce Faber’s life sentence in Germany only if a new Dutch request is made, he said.\n\nThe Wiesenthal Center has recently tried to increase public interest in Faber’s case, Zuroff said.\n\n“This case strikes me as a terrible travesty of justice,” he said. “We want to induce German authorities to bring Faber to justice. That would send a very positive message to the world.”\n\nFederal Justice Minister Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger wrote to her Bavarian counterpart regarding Faber two weeks ago, but her spokesman said that had nothing to do with the Center’s campaign.\n\nA spokesman for the Bavarian justice ministry, Stefan Heilmann, said Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger’s letter has arrived and will be answered, but he did not say how long that would take."
