Hezbollah has said it will not stop until there is a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant headed to Washington on Sunday to discuss the next phase of the Gaza war and escalating hostilities on the border with Lebanon, where exchanges of fire with Hezbollah have stoked fears of wider conflict. A full war in the north could lead to missile attacks on Israel's power grid and other infrastructure.\n\n(Reporting by Steven Scheer, Editing by William Maclean)"
