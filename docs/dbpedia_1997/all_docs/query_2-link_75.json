        "text": "The phenomenon of personally addressing the dead through letters published in public media is a prevalent communicative practice that has earned little academic notice. This practice disrupts some common communication principles and provides us with new understandings of how communication works-by travelling , rather than reaching an end. To encapsulate and characterize this phenomenon , this article focuses on an Israeli case study of letters written to the dead and published in popular newspapers. I use a media ecology approach to phenomeno-logically classify five sets of characteristics in order to stimulate future discussion and analysis.\n\nThis article argues that i) the presence of the dead within a society depends in part on available communication technologies, specifically speech, stone, sculpture, writing, printing, photography and phonography (including the mass media), and most recently the internet. ii) Each communication technology affords possibilities for the dead to construct and legitimate particular social groups and institutions - from the oral construction of kinship, to the megalithic legitimation of the territorial rights of chiefdoms, to the written word’s construction of world religions and nations, to the photographic and phonographic construction of celebrity-based neo-tribalism, and to the digital re-construction of family and friendship. iii) Historically, concerns about the dead have on a number of occasions aided the development of new communication technologies - the causal connection between the two can go both ways. The argument is based primarily on critical synthesis of existing research literature.\n\nThe global era presents a challenge for allmemory agents for they are now faced with the task of constructing collective memories that maintain new contemporary values, most notably sensitivity to other nations’ memories. This article deals with a major question flowing from the aforementioned task: Is it possible to reframe the past as a ‘‘cosmopolitan memory’’ for the purpose of promoting solidarity and peace? The article provides preliminary evidence of what can be called a ‘‘cosmopolitan turn’’ in collective memory construction, together with suggestions regarding the associated research lexicon. Through analysis of the obituaries published in the elite Israeli daily Haaretz, it illustrates some of the discursive strategies to be used to reframe the past as a cosmopolitan memory. Gavriely-Nuri, D. & Lachover, E. (2012). Reframing the past as cosmopolitan memory: Obituaries in the Israeli daily Haaretz, Communication Theory 22 (1), 48-65.\n\nThis article argues that i) the presence of the dead within a society depends in part on available communication technologies, specifically speech, stone, sculpture, writing, printing, photography and phonography (including the mass media), and most recently the internet. ii) Each communication technology affords possibilities for the dead to construct and legitimate particular social groups and institutions - from the oral construction of kinship, to the megalithic legitimation of the territorial rights of chiefdoms, to the written word’s construction of world religions and nations, to the photographic and phonographic construction of celebrity-based neo-tribalism, and to the digital re-construction of family and friendship. iii) Historically, concerns about the dead have on a number of occasions aided the development of new communication technologies - the causal connection between the two can go both ways. The argument is based primarily on critical synthesis of existing research literature.\n\nDeath is one of the most significant human events and rites of passage, fundamentally shaping the life course of individuals, families and social networks. For this reason, recognizing that someone has died and ritualizing this loss requires forms of communication and mediation between individuals and families in relation to wider social networks. Media has always played a significant part in how people are informed of a death, enabling rituals to proceed such as death notices and obituaries in newspapers. Today, information communication technologies (ICTs) and social media are routinely part of how people are informed about death, and enact a range of socially shared mourning and remembrance processes. This paper explores the current deployment of ICTs and social networking within practices and rituals of mourning, applying media theory. It focuses on the temporality of mourning in a culture of speed and the activation of mourning from the announcement of death to the cycles of anniversaries via social networking culture and through technological forms of automation. The question of how the bereaved (those significantly effected by a death) take or lose control of when and how they mourn and remember the dead in a technologically networked culture is this paper’s central concern.\n\nScholars of literary mourning find themselves in an odd position, often taking part in elegy even as they critique it. In her new book Dying Modern: A Meditation on Elegy, Diana Fuss fully embraces both roles. She offers readers the opportunity to see elegy in action – she notes, “The book itself is as performative as it is purposeful, perhaps comprising its own distinctive form of elegy” (3) – even as she raises new questions about the role of an ancient poetic form in an era of mass media that is, of course, written in prose.\n\nWhat makes death-related news events internationally appealing? How is the visual coverage of grief tailored for the needs of the international market? And how are the mechanisms for such coverage operated in the field by international news agencies’ photographers? In this article, I conduct an interpretive analysis of the funeral of an Israeli officer as it was covered by an Israeli Reuters photographer and an analysis of the “picture of the event” selected for distribution by the photographer. It demonstrates how international news institutions tailor the visual coverage of a local funeral to the complex demands of the international market."
