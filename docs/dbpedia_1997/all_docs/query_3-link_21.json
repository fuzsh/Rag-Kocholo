        "text": "Publication: Calcalist\n\nKobre & Kim’s Michael Rosen was recently quoted in the Israeli business newspaper Calcalist, discussing how amongst the devastation of COVID-19, the firm is trying to find some silver linings.\n\nIn the medium term, Rosen expects there may be opportunities “emerging from the economic squeeze” resulting from “a greater determination to uncover pre-existing fraud and misconduct by employers, counterparties, and investors triggered by the need for increased short-term liquidity.” Part of this is driven by the large amount of aid created by governments, which may attract fraudsters and thus increases the need for experienced monitors, investigators, and defensive counsel.\n\nAnother opportunity exists in patent monetization, since patents are not market-correlated and can be “a reliable source of revenue amidst larger economic downturn,” as well as because U.S. enforcement conditions have become more favorable. Rosen predicts that when these disputes are “approached positively and proactively,” regulations may become more fairly enforced, aid more fairly distributed, and intellectual property rights more rigorously upheld.\n\nClick here for the full article (in Hebrew)."
