We bring a creative eye to our analytic processes to reach optimal results.\n\nSocial Media has changed the business world, giving voice to individuals to influence the way businesses interact with their customers, with their suppliers, and with their employees. Brands are built on service, loyalty, and reputation. Today, every organization is a social organization.\n\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) is the most disruptive technology ever, with Gartner predicting more than 25 Billion connected devices by 2020. While that growth will be huge, most organizations are already leveraging the IoT, even if they don’t realize it. Every time a new device, machine or sensor is added to an organization, that business becomes more dependent on the IoT, and part of the IoT disruption.\n\nJust as every business has become a social business, every business will become an IoT business. Leading organizations will leverage both because Social and IoT are unique sources of enormous volumes of valuable data.\n\nIt is almost unbelievable that most organizations are largely ignoring this data, and the deep insights buried within it. If you combine Social data and IoT data with your traditional sources of data, you will enrich your business and make it more efficient and you can develop new offerings and services for your customers.\n\nIn other words, fusing the Social and IoT worlds will enable you to make money, to save money, and to better serve your customers – creating unprecedented new revenue streams, lower costs and greater brand loyalty and reputation.\n\nAGT is a pioneer in IoT and Social data management, Big Data integration and advanced analytics. AGT has deployed our analytics on Social and IoT data and integrated it with traditional Big Data to help solve wide-ranging challenges for businesses and organizations around the world, including reducing traffic jams, predicting floods, producing new media content, better managing energy production & consumption, providing new kinds of experiences to audiences at concerts & sporting events, advising farmers how to grow crops in the desert and helping make cities smarter.\n\nMost importantly, AGT’s solutions help our customers build better, lasting relationships with their consumers.\n\nBased in Palo Alto and Tel Aviv, Algopix is an early stage startup backed up by top-tier investors with offices in Palo Alto, California, and Tel Aviv, Israel. Algopix is revolutionizing the way online sellers do business. As an end-to-end product market analysis platform for the multi-trillion dollar eCommerce industry, Algopix was created to provide online sellers the data they need to know what buy and where to sell.\n\nThe founders have extensive experience in eCommerce having previously owned a successful eCommerce marketing agency (acquired in 2016). After spending time working hand-in-hand with merchants to optimize their online sales, they realized there was a better, technology-driven solution of product market analysis through smart, data-driven technology.\n\nAlgopix utilizes proprietary algorithms to aggregate critical data points from global online marketplaces around the world and is working with the largest companies to provide price and demand level data, as well as marketing and sourcing actionable insights.\n\nThe concept of ‘visual fragrance’ began when Shoval, fresh out of a top design college and with a strong affinity for style and perfumes, came up with an idea of trying to visualize (the traditional and transparent) fragrance on her own body, in a colorful way.\n\nTaking this from idea to execution – Shoval turned to her chemistry expert mother, Aliza, and with the backing of serial innovation entrepreneur David Chissick, the 3 founded Amkiri in 2014. With a team of savvy business, design, engineering and chemistry experts, Amkiri began creating the product – scientifically formulating fragrance into a color form, and inventing proprietary beauty tools and applicators.\n\nFast-forward 3 years and Amkiri has now brought fragrance into the 21st century, carving out a brand-new, patented product category for the beauty and cosmetics industry which enables consumers the complete freedom of multi-sensory self-expression.\n\nAppsFlyer is a mobile apps measurement platform that allows app developers, brands and agencies to track and optimize their entire mobile customer acquisition funnel from one real-time dashboard.\n\nAppsFlyer’s holistic approach allows advertisers to measure all media sources, including paid, organic, viral and social sources, without compromising user experience or accuracy.

Lastly, we wanted an infinitely scalable architecture. This architecture ultimately became the basis for our price per technician / unlimited agent’s philosophy.\n\nAtera is used by MSPs, VARs and IT Support companies on 5 continents in 21 countries.

One dream”\n\nCropX is an ag-analytics company that has developed the world’s most advanced adaptive irrigation service, which automatically optimizes irrigation, thereby delivering dramatic crop yield increase and water and energy cost savings to farms.\n\nLand is not uniform, and so different parts of any ﬁeld require different amounts of irrigation. Current irrigation systems water ﬁelds evenly, thereby wasting water and energy and repressing crop yield, by inadvertently overwatering parts of a ﬁeld while under-watering other parts. This also results in harmful leachate and runoff of fertilizer and pesticide chemicals, which impact the environment.\n\nCropX’s service is the world’s ﬁrst and only automated adaptive differential irrigation solution, which successfully addresses this challenge. No other product automatically generates daily, accurate, hassle-free, irrigation maps, which apply just the right amount of water to different parts of the same ﬁeld.\n\nCropX’s technology was developed by a team of world-leading scientists and has been validated on-farm over the past ﬁve years. And while the underlying science and technology are complex – using the system is as simple and intuitive as using your smartphone. Importantly – it is also risk-free. There are no set-up fees or capital costs, and you only pay after water and energy cost savings have been demonstrated.\n\nCydersoft (TM) offers a comprehensive set of mobile video advertising monetization services leveraging its home-grown scalable VideMob (TM) platform which serves over 5 billion ad opportunities every day.\n\nVideMob combines algorithms and machine learning technologies with large-scale RTB and programmatic processes to maximize revenues and ROI for advertisers and publishers.\n\nThe innovative VideMob solution includes a variety of video players for mobile and desktop, flexible integration options to support all standards including VAST and HTML5 VPAID, enables delivery of all video ad types, such as in-stream, out-stream or custom.\n\nFor advertisers – Ensures inventory quality with premium publishers, accurate targeting and user matching, built-in real-time fraud prevention, enhanced viewability and brand safety.
