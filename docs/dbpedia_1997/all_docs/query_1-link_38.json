        "text": "Today marks 300 days that 115 #hostages are still in captivity by Hamas. EL AL Israel Airlines has accompanied the families of the hostages since October 7 and is committed to raising #awareness for their release worldwide. To #commemorate this sad day, we illuminated one of our night flights with yellow lighting. Throughout the day, on departing EL AL flights from #Israel, a special announcement will be made to express solidarity and #support for the hostages and their families. EL AL will continue to operate to raise #global awareness, and we hope for a swift and safe return of the hostages back home to Israel.\n\nIt’s especially thrilling to receive a #Platinum rating from Maala – the organization for corporate responsibility – especially considering the challenges of these harsh times. Against the backdrop of the ongoing national emergency, Maala’s 2024 #ESG rating, published yesterday, highlights the significant increase in overall #contributions from Israeli companies, as well as the rise in volunteering and corporate support for employees. EL AL Israel Airlines will always proudly carry the #national flag on the tails of its aircraft. As the country’s national carrier, it is our mission to serve as a model and work for the benefit of others. And, investing huge resources in social endeavors is a #responsibility we welcome. In recent years, we have implemented a host of tools and #strategies to help make our operations environmentally friendly and sustainable; and ESG policy is a crucial factor in the transactions and agreements we enter into. I thank the men and women of El Al, whose dedication and hard work over the years have allowed us to achieve #impressive milestones and earn recognition for our efforts – especially this past year. Since October 7, El Al has joined the national effort with extensive activities, both in the air and on the ground, including donations of millions of shekels, sponsorships, community outreach, and more. Maala’s rating covers over 150 companies in the #economy – both private, governmental, and public; and El Al is proud to be among the companies committed to corporate responsibility for the broader social fabric. Limor Bouzaglo Ayelet Recanati Sharon Brownstone\n\nThis week, I had the pleasure and #Honor of meeting the young members of Birthright Israel Excel program. These youngsters, most of them students, are the next generation of #Jewish business #leaders in Israel and around the world. Most of them are from the US, others from Europe, South America, and more. Here in #Israel, they have been attached to our own \"Young and Promising\" teams. I recently had a chance to talk to them about El Al's #activities since the outbreak of war, especially the uncertainties and #security challenges of the recent months. We talked about maintaining the air bridge to and from Israel for passengers and cargo. We spoke about El Al's #significant role in supporting #aliyah, in cooperation with other entities including the Ministry of Aliyah and Integration. Since October 7, 21 thousand #Olim have come to Israel, and more are on their way. Coincidentally, when I asked them if they see themselves living in Israel many admitted they might. From their attentiveness and interest, I feel that these youngsters are truly interested in Israel's #aviation market. It's wonderful to meet the young members of this quality #generation, one which is about to shape our future here and around the world. EL AL Israel Airlines\n\nהאווירה המורכבת כלפי נציגי #ישראל בעולם לא מאפשרת לנו להישאר אדישים, ולכן יצאנו במהלך שידגיש לספורטאים, ולעולם כולו, שעם ישראל תמיד מאחוריהם ושהם אף פעם לא לבד. אנחנו גאים להקים את \"נבחרת הדגל\", נבחרת שתמריא ותעודד את הספורטאים שלנו במשחקים הפראלימפיים בפריז. בנוסף, נתרום 200 אלף ש\"ח לארגון נכי צה\"ל בין היתר בכרטיסי טיסה למשלחות ייעודיות. מטרת התרומה היא לתמוך בפצועות ופצועי צה\"ל וכוחות הביטחון אשר שילמו בגופם ובנפשם לביטחון המדינה ואזרחיה. אנו מאחלים לכל הספורטאים הישראלים הצלחה רבה בתחרויות השונות, השתתפותכם מהווה #גאווה גדולה עבורנו ועבור המדינה כולה. The complex atmosphere towards #Israeli representatives around the world does not allow us to remain indifferent, which is why we have launched a #campaign to emphasize to the athletes and the entire world that the people of Israel are always behind them and that they are never alone. Therefore, we are proud to establish the Spirit Team, which will soar and encourage our athletes at the #Paralympic Games in Paris. Additionally, we will donate 200,000 shekels to the #IDF Disabled Veterans Organization, among other things, for flight tickets for designated delegations. The donation aims to support the wounded soldiers and security forces who have paid with their bodies and souls for the #security of the state of israel and its citizens. We wish all Israeli #athletes great success in the various competitions. Your participation is a significant source of pride for us and the country. EL AL Israel Airlines\n\nSince the outbreak of the war, approximately 21,000 new immigrants have arrived in #Israel. These new immigrants are a vital growth engine for the Israeli #economy, and we are proud to be part of bringing them to Israel. This week, I had the privilege of meeting with the Minister of Immigration and Absorption, Mr. Ofir Sofer, and the CEO of his office, Avichai Kahana. We discussed their office's efforts to raise #awareness, encourage and enable immigration, and organize activities that strengthen the Zionist project that EL AL Israel Airlines is proud to #support. We wish all new immigrants success in their new lives in Israel. Welcome! Remember, we are always here when you want to #travel abroad.\n\nYesterday, as part of our #strategic plan, we signed a #codeshare and loyalty club sharing agreements with Virgin Atlantic, a member of the \"Skyteam\" Alliance. This #partnership will enable #passengers to fly the Tel Aviv-London route operated by both airlines via the shared code. In addition to the expansion of the flight schedule on this route, the partnership will offer greater #value for Matmid frequent flyer members. This is another significant step in addition to more partnerships that we've signed during the last year, such as Delta Airlines, SAS, and Air France. We remain committed to expanding our cooperation agreements with leading #airlines #worldwide, while continuously extending our flight schedules to desirable destinations. EL AL Israel Airlines\n\nToday we published our #financial results for the first quarter of 2024. About eight months after the outbreak of the war, the #Israeli #aviation industry is still experiencing instability due to the ongoing cancellation of #flights to and from Israel by foreign #airlines. This situation creates a true crisis among consumers who ordered tickets from these companies and, in many cases, are left in the lurch and contact EL AL Israel Airlines at the last minute. We are working fervently to increase seat capacity, while fully utilizing the company’s #operational ability, and attempting to provide as adequate a response as possible to the strong pressure and unusual demand for our flights. At the same time, we are continuing with our procurement plan to grow and rejuvenate our #fleet of aircraft. In Q1 2024 we even signed an agreement to purchase another three 787 Dreamliners, with an option for the purchase of up to another 6 aircraft, which will enable us to expand our flight schedule and significantly increase seat capacity. Our financial results for the first quarter of 2024 show EL AL #revenues in the quarter amounted to approx. $738 million, net profit to approx. $80 million and EBITDAR reached approx. $196 million. The passenger load factor (PLF) on our flights grew to approx. 93% compared to an average of approx. 85% load in the corresponding period in 2023, and revenue passenger kilometers (RRPK) remained virtually unchanged relative to the previous quarter (Q4 2023), and relative to the corresponding quarter the previous year, which was considered a standard winter quarter, there has been an increase of approx. only 19%. In the second quarter of 2024, EL AL's capital is expected to be positive, for the first time since December 2019. These are critical parameters for EL AL's continued development and realization of our long-term strategic objectives."
