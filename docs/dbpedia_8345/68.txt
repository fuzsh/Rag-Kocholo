The New Bedford Custom House is an excellent example of a small public building in the Greek Revival Style. Set fifty feet above the tide level with an uninterrupted view of the harbor, it has been a city landmark since the mid-19th century. The exceptional significance of the New Bedford Custom House is recognized by its 1970 designation as a National Historic Landmark. It is also a key component of the Waterfront Historic District, nominated to the National Register in 1966. Its importance is derived from its associations with Massachusetts' maritime heritage, its formative role in the Federal building program, and its status as an impressive and intact example of Greek Revival style architecture. | Credit line: Photographs in the Carol M.
