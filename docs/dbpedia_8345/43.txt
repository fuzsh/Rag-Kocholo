History and Architectural Features

Designed by Robert Mills and erected between 1834-36, the New Bedford Custom House is an excellent example of a small public building in the Greek Revival. Set fifty feet above the tide level with an uninterrupted view of the harbor, it has been a city landmark since the mid-19th century. Considered functionally outdated in 1958, the U.S. Custom House was extensively restored in 1962. It was listed as a contributing building in the New Bedford National Historic Landmark District in 1966. The U.S. Custom House became part of the New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park in 1996.
