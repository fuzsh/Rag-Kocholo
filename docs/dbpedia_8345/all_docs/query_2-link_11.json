        "text": "William Hart House – Dartmouth – circa 1718\n\nOriginally located on land slated for development, this post-and-beam farmhouse was threatened with demolition when it was rescued by WHALE IN 1987. Considered the oldest gambrel-style home in southeastern Massachusetts, it was dismantled, stored and reconstructed on this site.\n\nRotch-Jones Duff House & Garden Museum – 396 County Street, New Bedford – 1834\n\nDesigned by Richard Upjohn in 1834 for William Rotch Jr., the house is New Bedford’s last whaling captain’s home with its original intact gardens. A National Historic Landmark, WHALE bought the Greek Revival masterpiece from members of the Duff family to rescue it from development as a boarding house and the magnificent gardens becoming a parking lot. After an exterior restoration, WHALE helped establish the nonprofit that has since managed the Rotch Jones Duff House & Garden Museum.\n\nHatch Properties – (Seven) – Hillman & Pleasant Streets, New Bedford\n\nIn 1976 WHALE began one of its most important projects restoring an entire city block of seven historic buildings. The Hatch properties, seven Gothic Revival, Greek revival and federal houses were threatened with demolition. WHALE purchased all seven, restored the exteriors and sold them to young home owners who completed interior restorations. It was WHALE first neighborhood development project.\n\nTallman Ware House – 13 Centre Street, New Bedford – 1790\n\nThis Federal-style warehouse, originally occupied by businesses that supported the whaling industry, is the oldest building on Centre Street and one of the first in the Waterfront Historic District to be restored. WHALE rescued the building in 1967 and used it as its headquarters until 1995.\n\nWilliam Tallman Russell House – 66 Russell Street, New Bedford – circa 1823\n\nSeverely damaged by fire in 1977, this Greek Revival house was rescued by WHALE in 1978 and sold to owners who meticulously restored it.\n\nWilson Stable – 38 Elm Street – New Bedford – 1896\n\nThe last wood-frame stable in the Waterfront Historic District, this building originally housed horses, carriages and hearses. To save it from slated demolition, WHALE purchased the property in 1972 and sold it to owners who restored it.\n\nRodman Candleworks –72 North Water Street, New Bedford – circa 1810\n\nThis former spermaceti candle factory was damaged by fire in the late 1960’s. Abandoned and scheduled for demolition, the building was rescued by WHALE and the Architectural Conservation Trust and reopened in 1979.\n\nSundial Building – 63 Union Street, Union Street, New Bedford – 1820\n\nOperating as the State Fruit Co. by the Karalekas family, the Sundial Building was badly damaged in the devastating natural gas explosion on January 18, 1977. WHALE saved the Federal style structure from demolition and restored it to its mid-nineteenth century appearance.\n\nSeth Russell House\n\n82-86 North Front Street, New Bedford – circa 1765\n\nThought to be the only structure to survive the attack by the British in 1778, this Greek Revival home was moved by WHALE to this once-vacant lot in 1978 to allow expansion of the Whaling Museum. Its original owner was a descendent of a founder of Bedford Village.\n\nMcCullough Building\n\n96 Front Street, New Bedford – circa 1830\n\nJohn McCullough purchased this ship chandlery and warehouse in the mid-nineteenth century. Known as the “McCullough Ruin” after a disastrous fire in 1940, the building lay abandoned for 36 years before it was saved by WHALE in 1976.\n\nMacomber Sylvia Building – 1816 with 1870 Italianate gable and brackets\n\nRestored by WHALE, Anne W. Baker and Doug Keffer 1977/78\n\nLost January 18, 1977 in a gas explosion – Union Street\n\nLost during the January 18, 1977 gas explosion, the Macomber Sylvia had been completely restored and was to be sold the day of the explosion. WHALE had no insurance on the building. Turning back toward its mission, WHALE immediately began to save the Sundial building, the only one of three on the block to survive the explosion.\n\nHenry Beetle House – 24 Centre Street, New Bedford – circa 1804\n\nThreatened by demolition because it was in the path of the Route 18 extension, this former spar maker’s Federal period home was moved by WHALE to this once-vacant lot in 1972 and sold to owners who restored it.\n\nHaile Luther House – 70 North Second Street, New Bedford – circa 1840\n\nThreatened by demolition due to urban renewal, this former master stonemason’s Greek Revival style home was moved by WHALE in 1977 and sold to owners who restored it.\n\nCaleb Spooner House – 22 Centre Street, New Bedford – 1806\n\nThreatened by demolition because it was in the path of the Route 18 extension, this Federal-style home was moved by WHALE to this once-vacant lot in 1974 and sold to owners who restored it.\n\nBourne Warehouse – 47-49 North Second Street, New Bedford – 1887\n\nA fine example of late19th century commercial architecture, this warehouse was erected in front of the Andrew Robeson mansion and housed an auction business selling everything from antique furniture to ships. WHALE acquired the building in 1975 and sold it to owners who restored it.\n\nBedford Landing Waterfront National Register Historic District\n\nWHALE was established in 1962 to address the blight and neglect of the buildings within the Waterfront Historic District. This was WHALE’s first neighborhood revitalization project. In November of 1996, this waterfront district became a National Register Historic District and a National Historic Landmark. In November of 1996, it achieved the designation of New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park. WHALE has saved and facilitated the restoration of more than 20 properties within its boundaries.\n\nAndrew Robeson House – 32 William Street, New Bedford – circa 1821\n\nThis 550-ton brick and stone mansion was rescued by WHALE to prevent its demolition and moved to its present site during the blizzard of 1978. Designed in the Federal style, the residence is an outstanding example of New Bedford’s prosperity during the golden age of whaling.\n\nAndrew G. Pierce, Jr. House – 99 Madison Street, New Bedford – 1881Designed by noted Boston architects, Peabody & Sterns, this house was in terrible condition when it was rescued by WHALE in 1978. It is a fine example of the Queen Anne and shingle style of architecture that was prominent during the New Bedford textile era.\n\nAbijah Hathaway House – 66 North Second Street, New Bedford – 1846\n\nThreatened by demolition because it was in the path of Rouse 18, this Greek Revival style home was moved by WHALE to this once-vacant lot in 1979 and sold to owners who restored it.\n\nBenjamin Rodman House – 50 North Second Street, New Bedford – circa 1820\n\nBy the mid-twentieth century, this magnificent granite home was completely enclosed by storefronts and being used as a warehouse. The Federal-style residence, the only waterfront mansion standing on its original foundation, was WHALE’s first restoration project in 1965."
