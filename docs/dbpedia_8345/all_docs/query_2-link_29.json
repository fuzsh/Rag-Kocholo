        "text": "Getting your Trinity Audio player ready...\n\nMaybe there’s something to be said for this talk about the Deep State determining everything after all.\n\nFirst a chancellor from UMass Dartmouth, three years after he arrived in the region, announces that he will immediately close New Bedford’s UMD arts campus without previously discussing his plans with either the mayor of the city or the area’s state legislators.\n\nAnd now we learn that federal government bureaucrats — officials with General Services Administration, to be precise — have decided to close New Bedford’s federal building — depended upon by thousands to conveniently deal with their Social Security matters — without ever discussing the matter with either the mayor or the congressional delegation.\n\nIn both cases, the administrators made their decisions solely based on numbers that they said didn’t work for good fiscal management. Numbers are important, of course. But any good business person can tell you there is always a way to make the numbers work. That is, if you have enough desire and creativity.\n\nThe UMass system and the General Services Administration evidently have neither of those qualities.\n\nHard on the heels of the announcement of the Hastings Keith Building’s planned closure came the news that Rite Aid would close its downtown New Bedford drug store after many decades in the city’s center. While there are other drug stores and grocery stores in the downtown, Rite Aid was among the most convenient for many. Unlike a nearby full-service Walgreens, it was situated in a much easier walk from the heart of the city.\n\nBut the drug store chain is gone from the downtown without a discussion from the community it served.\n\nRite Aid, of course, is remotely and corporately owned. Its departure is said to have something to do with a bankruptcy proceeding and selling off stores to stay solvent. But the chain has provided no specific details about either.\n\nThere’s been a lot of talk from elected officials about the newfound success of downtown New Bedford lately.\n\nIn the wake of the College of Visual and Performing Arts removal, some folks have been saying that downtown New Bedford has come far enough now that maybe it’s not so disastrous for the UMass campus to close. Maybe the Star Store building could be used for housing or offices for some other government or nonprofit agencies, maybe even artists’ studios.\n\nFor the record, both Mayor Jon Mitchell and Sen. Mark Montigny are saying that discussions with state officials are continuing about bringing at least some portion of the Dartmouth-based university back to downtown New Bedford.\n\nIt’s sure taking a long time.\n\n“There’s a fair amount of discussion right now,” Mitchell told me this week.\n\nMaybe the mayor and state senator are waiting for money to be placed in the Fiscal Year 2025 state budget. But Chancellor Mark Fuller seems not to be paying attention to them. He’s already talking about the possible construction of a one-story addition to the CVPA building on the Dartmouth campus.\n\nThe two sides don’t seem remotely close. So what is the public supposed to believe?\n\nThe comments that the downtown has come a long way have truth to them. It’s certainly not 1999 when you could drive up most of the Union Street hill and encounter more closed storefronts than open ones. The same with Purchase Street.\n\nBut anyone looking at downtown New Bedford with fresh or objective eyes knows that while there’s been significant progress, in many ways it’s still struggling.\n\nThat’s not unusual in 2024. In the wake of the pandemic, office workers have not yet completely returned to successful metropolitan areas like Boston — never mind New Bedford, a city that has not had a healthy office space sector for decades. With the rise of the post-pandemic remote-workers economy, maybe those offices will never be back.\n\nWhat is finally happening in downtown New Bedford is a resurgence of housing construction. Virtually all of it, however, has been subsidized by state and federal government grants. That’s fine. It would still be impossible to spur any kind of multi-unit apartment buildings in many parts of New Bedford in a purely market-based economy. Construction costs are simply too high, and rents and housing costs still too low compared to other parts of the state.\n\nEven with these several housing starts, New Bedford is certainly not in a construction boom yet.\n\nI took some time this week and found the following empty spaces in the downtown: Two storefronts on Purchase Street in the Times Square building; the former Merchants National Bank on William Street (empty and for sale for years now); the old Lupo’s building across from Custom House Park (empty and for sale for years); the old Kruger Brothers ship supply building on lower Union where the owner has said it could take as many as five years to replace it with something like a five-story housing development.\n\nThen there’s that building at the foot of Johnnycake Hill that has been worked on for the last year. The historic tea kettle is back, but there’s only one business in the complex. Construction seems to have come to a halt for a few months.\n\nTravel up Union Street and you’ll see that there are empty spaces in the main foyer of the old New Bedford Institution for Savings building at Union Square. There’s an empty storefront a few addresses down from the empty Star Store, and there’s a string of empty storefronts west of the Harbor Hotel on the south side of Union. There’s another empty storefront just west of the Fall River Pawn Broker. Over on Pleasant Street, more empty commercial spaces.\n\nSlideshow: Empty New Bedford\n\nWhy are there so many empty slots? Well, it’s a combination of reasons.\n\nWe’ve long reported that the cost of building in New Bedford makes it difficult for a developer to realize a profitable return because rents and sale prices are not high enough. Sure, there are government programs to subsidize development, but they take a long time and there are not enough to develop at scale.\n\nAlso, a lot of folks criticize the city’s Building Department and say it still takes too long to issue permits. As a result, it’s a lengthy, expensive process to develop anything in New Bedford.\n\nThe mayor’s not buying that view, common among at least some contractors and developers. Mitchell’s spokesman issued a statement saying the Building Department issued almost 4,200 permits last year and expects more this year. “The city’s move to electronic permitting has hastened the process,” according to the statement.\n\nIt’s certainly true that small businesses do come and go. There’s always some amount of empty storefronts in any city, and even in the suburban malls that surround most urban centers — certainly in the strip malls in the North End of New Bedford.\n\nBut New Bedford has a lot of empty spaces like the string of them north of the Harbor Hotel that have been there for years.\n\n“We’re not a first-tier downtown,” Mayor Mitchell told me when I asked him about the number of empty buildings and storefronts struggling to attract offices. He was stating the obvious. “It’s not midtown Manhattan,” he said.\n\nIt’s certainly true that Mitchell and a string of mayors before him have done a lot to set plans in place and slowly encourage the rebuilding of the downtown. But by no means is it there yet, and center city New Bedford is taking some tough hits just now.\n\nBoth Mitchell and the legislative delegation have tried ad nauseam, and apparently unsuccessfully, to reason with the state university and the governor. And both the mayor and congressional delegation have written to the General Services Administration, pointing out the federal building’s potential for additional federal offices, such as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other Port of New Bedford federal concerns, that could bring in more rents. Mitchell’s February letter to GSA argues the city may even need additional federal space beyond the Hastings Keith building.\n\nThe feds, however, are not making any promises. The GSA does not let on if they are reconsidering their decision, Mitchell said. A statement I received from GSA confirms that.\n\nThe GSA spokesman’s press release consists of some vague blather about economic development and jobs, but with no acknowledgement of the importance of all the federal government agencies outlined by the mayor — from fisheries to wind to Coast Guard to Army Corps of Engineers to Agriculture and Drug Enforcement — and no nod to the congressional delegation’s admonition that they follow federal laws governing stakeholder engagement and equity and diversity issues.\n\nThere are other good signs that will bring more folks into the city.\n\nMitchell points out that the Whaling Museum is planning a $30 million expansion for gallery and retail space; the YMCA is planning a $20 million upgrade; and the Zeiterion Center for the Performing Arts is in the midst of its $30 million renovation.\n\nAll good.\n\nBut any walk around the downtown commercial sector will quickly prove that we’re not there yet. It’s a long way back from where New Bedford has been.\n\nEmail Jack Spillane at jspillane@newbedfordlight.\n\nEditor’s note: This story was modified on Friday, March 1, 2024, to correct the street that the former Merchants National Bank is located on."
