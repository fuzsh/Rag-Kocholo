        "text": "If you want to learn more about Black history by visiting some locations key to the African American narrative, you’re in luck. From Nantucket to New Bedford, Boston to the Berkshires, there are a wealth of destinations perfect for a road or day trip.\n\nNew Bedford: Abolitionist, orator and writer Fredrick Douglass called the Whaling City his home. He raised his family there after escaping slavery in Maryland via the Underground Railroad. And that’s just a piece of what you can learn here — the city’s Black History Trail (nbhistoricalsociety.org/historic-trails/) has been guiding visitors since 1996.\n\nAs you walk along the cobblestoned and tree-lined streets and side roads of the downtown area, the trail guides you past many relevant outdoor sites (you’ll take in a lot even with current pandemic restrictions). Here you’ll learn more about Douglass, historic churches and homes that were part of the Underground Railroad, as well as many references to the famed 54th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. Douglass was an avid recruiter for the first Black regiment, which was known for its fighting prowess in the Union Army during the Civil War.\n\nNew Bedford also offers an active fishing wharf, lovely outdoor parks and a unique cityscape. The city’s placement of informative plaques even in front of private homes of significance make a walking tour that much more insightful. You’ll even see (and hear) a liberty bell that once rang in celebration every time a slave arrived to seek freedom in New Bedford.\n\nYou’ll want to make your visit an all-day one. New Bedford resident Justina Perry helped launch a program to guide locals and visitors alike to Black-owned shops and restaurants. Using buyblacknb.com, you can not only shop and dine supporting locals, but meet owners who know the history and landscape well, with listings such as the restaurant Dining With Soul.\n\nQuincy: Of the first 12 presidents of the United States, only John Adams and son John Quincy Adams never owned slaves. Both called Quincy home. The downtown and surrounding area — all spruced up after a few years of major revival — abounds with opportunities to learn more about black history here.\n\nFirst, it is important to point out that under the current coronavirus reopening phase, National Park sites have yet to open, and a few of the great educational spots in Quincy come under their aegis. But a day trip even now offers plenty of chances to learn..\n\nThe grounds of “The Old House,” better known as Peacefield, as John Adams called it (nps.gov/adam/learn/historyculture/places.htm) are open to the public. His wife, Abigail, was a crusader for equal education — including for women and people of color. At Peacefield, one can wander the grounds and take it all in. There’s even a still-blooming rose bush planted by Abigail Adams herself.\n\nIt was also in Quincy where John Quincy Adams did much of his work readying to fight for — and win — freedom for the captives of the famed Amistad slave ship in their petition before the Supreme Court. The homes of both Adams can be viewed from the exterior for now. Both men are also laid to rest side by side in the family vault in the United First Parish Church in the center of the city.\n\nThe Quincy Urban Arts District always has interesting and worthwhile educational displays, and the Thomas Crane Public Library offers guest speakers on diversity.\n\nWith the city’s newer green centered downtown and boom in restaurants, you can fill a day there. You can learn more at quincyma.gov/visitors/tourism.htm.\n\nBoston offers a wealth of opportunity, and is an obvious choice. You can discover some spots you may have never noticed, or learn more about a site you thought you understood (but perhaps did not) by following the Black Heritage Trail (bostonusa.com/things-to-do/sightseeing-tours-trails/black-heritage-trail/) there. You’ll see the Shaw 54th Regiment Memorial, the John J. Smith House and more. Look for the marker near Milk Street memorializing Zipporah Potter Atkins, a free black woman born to slaves in Boston in 1645, who went on to become the first black woman to own property in Boston’s North End. Researching her history prior helps bring the story to life, as she had to fight all her life to keep that property.\n\nAnd on July 20, Boston’s Museum of African American History (maah.org) is open to all and features a new exhibit with objects telling the story of African American life in Massachusetts from 1638 to the end of the 19th century. It also offers an African American Meeting House experience, and more. Its Nantucket location is a great chance to learn while vacationing or day visiting the island as well. There, too, a well-mapped Black Heritage Trail helps you see and learn (maah.org/nantucket_heritage_trail).\n\n“The stories of the African American experience in Massachusetts are deep and rich,” said Anita Walker, executive director of the Mass Cultural Council. “Mass Cultural Council’s investments in these historic sites and cultural nonprofit organizations assures that they will continue to be told, to visitors and residents alike.”"
