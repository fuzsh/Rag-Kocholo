Customs collectors were responsible for collecting duties; recording financial transactions; admeasuring and documenting merchant vessels; administering customhouses and, until 1852, lighthouses; collecting and accounting for funds for marine hospitals; and, until 1871, administering revenue cutters. Captains of vessels arriving at U.S. ports from abroad were required by an act of March 2, 1819 (3 Stat. 489), to submit a list of passengers to the collector of customs. Upon occasion the collector acted as the depository for federal funds and collected taxes for the Bureau of Internal Revenue.\n\nTop of Page\n\n36.3.1 Records of customhouses and collection districts\n\nNote: Many of the records described below are candidates for transfer to regional archives, but are being held in the Washington, DC, area until extensive preservation work has been performed on them.
