        "text": "NEW BEDFORD — As biting winter weather descends with relentless freezing temperatures, the crisis of homelessness levels up. Calls for coats, blankets and other donations from charitable organizations rev up. Shelters open their overflow beds when temperatures dip below 28 degrees.\n\nIt’s a yearly cycle.\n\nHowever, this year could be even more of a struggle – not only for homeless people, but for the organizations that help them.\n\nThe homeless crisis recently grabbed the public’s attention by the shirt collar in Boston where officials were evicting people from the homeless encampment known as Mass and Cass near the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard.\n\nCould that happen on a smaller scale in New Bedford?\n\nOfficials say no, but local organizations fear the numbers of the homeless population will increase this winter.\n\nNew Bedford’s homeless numbers last winter\n\nThe annual Point In Time count tallies the number of homeless people during a 24-hour period every January. Volunteers go out into the city and conduct a headcount of homeless people. The 2021 count reported a decrease in the numbers. There were 372 documented homeless people in the city, compared to 398 in 2020.\n\nPoint In Time report: Homeless numbers in New Bedford were down in 2021, but will it hold?\n\nRev. David Lima, chairman of the Homeless Service Providers Network, noted that the PIT count is time-limited and might not count all people who are experiencing homelessness. He said a person, who might otherwise be homeless, could have found a bed somewhere for that one night of the count and not make it on to the PIT count list.\n\n“If you don’t see them, you can’t count them,” Lima said.\n\nBack then Lima forewarned of a possible disturbing increase in the numbers of homeless people in the city for 2022.\n\nProviding an overnight bed\n\n“On any given night, up to 302 people would be able to stay in shelter if all facilities were able to accommodate full capacity,” said Jennifer Clarke, deputy director of the city’s Office of Housing and Community Development, by email. “Bear in mind that each shelter is different — some are for individuals, some serve families who must enter through the state’s shelter system, some are specifically for victims of domestic violence, others for unaccompanied youth, etc. During the winter, there is typically an overflow shelter available to accommodate an additional 30 individuals.”\n\nClarke said the city has 302 emergency shelter beds, 91 transitional housing beds and 420 permanent (supportive) housing beds.\n\nWhatever happened to the city’s “Ten Year Plan to Address and Eliminate Homelessness”?\n\nHome heating costs are soaring this winter: Here's how to get help in New England\n\nThe plan came from a federal initiative under President George W. Bush, who appointed Phillip Mangano to head the federal Interagency Council on Homelessness in 2002, Clarke said. “Although such efforts across the country did not result in an outright elimination of homelessness, it did bring about a greater clarity as to the need to focus on housing and those most vulnerable.” She said New Bedford was able to set up “prevention efforts to stave off homelessness for those on the verge of losing their housing.”\n\nHow New Bedford addresses homeless encampments\n\nHomeless encampments in New Bedford popped up in the city over the years.\n\nIn 2017, a single tent was found behind the Hayden McFadden Elementary School on County Street. Police investigated but found no one at the location.\n\nIn 2016, a fire in a heater made with sheet metal ignited one of three makeshift shelters in a homeless encampment in the woods off Hathaway Road behind the former Building 19 store. Fire Chief Michael Gomes said at the time that it was fortunate none of the encampment residents died from carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nIn 2015, anywhere from 10 to 30 homeless people had been living in an abandoned two-bay garage and makeshift homes made out of tents and black milk crates on a 4.7-acre plot in the woods beyond the railroad tracks on Nauset Street.\n\nSacred cemetery ground:: When the homeless shelter among the dead\n\nWhile the camps pop up here and there, the city has protocols in place to keep them from taking root and forming a larger encampment.\n\nNew Bedford has HEART\n\nHEART stands for Homeless Emergency Assistance Response Team and is made up of city health department officials, police officers, and some members from the city’s Neighborhood Task Force, PAACA, Steppingstone, Catholic Social Services, and Interchurch Council. HEART is a response team that meets homeless people where they are — whether in an unsheltered situation or an encampment.\n\nIf an encampment is found, the HEART team will notify the city’s health department. The team then visits the encampment and checks, not only for people staying there, but also for safety and sanitation issues.\n\nWhy a comparison matters: New Bedford health officials compare HIV/AIDs epidemic to COVID.\n\nThose found living in the encampment are provided with immediate assistance such as food, water, and clothing. The team then makes them aware of the services and shelters available and also lets them know the encampment will be removed by the city in 72 hours.\n\nIf no one is found at an encampment, the team leaves resource packets relaying information (in three languages) about services available and to give notice of the 72-hour deadline of the encampment removal.\n\nAccording to John Flor, city solicitor and head of the Neighborhood Task force, in 2019 the task force office initiated six HEART responses to six different locations. In 2020, it initiated 22 HEART responses to 22 different locations. And in 2021, it initiated 13 HEART responses to 13 different locations.\n\nRefusing to go to a shelter\n\nSome of those living on the streets choose not to go to a shelter because of strict rules, such as being at the shelter by 8 p.m. and then having to leave early in the morning. Lima said those with substance abuse or mental health issues may also stay away from shelters.\n\nPlans to tackle homelessness: New Bedford's new city councilors look forward to tackling city issues\n\nLima said those who stay out of shelters are given blankets, but said it can be a real struggle when they move about and are hard to find.\n\nAlves said he is concerned about the rising cost of food. He feared donations may drop or that the funds given to community service programs won’t go as far.\n\nHousing is key\n\n“The number of available units is shrinking, and has been for the last five or six years,” said Carl Alves, of Positive Action Against Chemical Addiction (PAACA).\n\nThe average rent in 2020 for Section 8 housing in the city was anywhere from $777 for a studio unit to $1,372 for a four-bedroom apartment, according to data from the US Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD).\n\n“Fair Market Rent prices in New Bedford are high compared to the national average. This FMR area is more expensive than 86% of other FMR areas. Fair Market Rent for a two-bedroom apartment in New Bedford is $1,012 per month,” according to RentCafe.\n\nIt’s not all that uncommon for multiple generations to live in the same three-decker apartment building in the city, or renters who’ve lived in the same apartment for decades.\n\nWhat’s happening now is the hot real estate market and landlords are selling these multi-family houses and the new owners jack up the rents to pay for it. The family that has lived in the building for years now finds they can no longer afford to live there.\n\nAlves said he can foresee elderly residents being forced out of their apartments and predicts this will be the population “significantly at risk” to become homeless.\n\n“I couldn’t afford to buy my house today,” Lima said.\n\nMayor Jon Mitchell is proposing spending some $13 million from the federal American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) toward creating more affordable housing. He wants to start a program that will facilitate more owner-occupied tenement housing.\n\nThe New Bedford Housing Authority oversees the city’s 1,650 federal public housing units and 850 state aided units, servicing over 6,000 individuals by providing safe, well maintained, and affordable housing units. It also administers nearly 1,800 federally-funded rental vouchers through HUD's Voucher Choice Program.\n\nRise Up for Homes\n\nRise Up for Homes is a collaborative campaign established by the members of the city's Homeless Service Providers Network.\n\n\"Men, women, children, black, or white, homelessness does not discriminate and there is no easy fix. Those experiencing homelessness need more than just a warm bed; they need compassionate access to health care, food, clothing, education, employment opportunities and safe permanent housing,\" Rise Up states on its website.\n\nPrivate donations help Rise Up open a cold weather shelter to get homeless into safety and warmth by providing emergency shelter during inclement weather conditions and a warm meal, and getting the best information out to those in greatest need about the shelter, housing and services available to them."
