        "text": "New Bedford - Whaling Capital of the World\n\nThursday, April 28, 2016\n\nNew Bedford, Massachusetts, United States\n\nWhen I was in my teens and started to get interested in\n\npolitics, I bought and read two or the issues of the book “The Almanac of American\n\nPolitics”, published on a biennial basis . The books were over a thousand pages\n\nthick and went into great detail on the political, demographic, and economic\n\nhistory of America not only by state but also by congressional district. That\n\nwas around 35 years ago, but what I read back then built many impressions in my\n\nmind of places that only get reformed when I visit them myself. Having traveled\n\nextensively in the country, that’s now most places. And, of course, places have\n\nevolved in the more than three decades since I read those books.\n\nNew Bedford, Massachusetts is a place that was described in\n\na less than flattering manner as a once prosperous mill town that fell on hard\n\ntimes, and the 1970s and early 1980s were a rough time economically in much of New\n\nEngland. It somewhat clouded my view of the city even though all I’ve seen of\n\nit to date was to pass through several times on the Interstate over the years\n\non the way to Cape Cod.\n\nIn recent years I’ve tried to explore units of the National\n\nPark system that I haven’t been to before and was intrigued by the New Bedford\n\nWhaling National Historical Park . I decided to stop for a day and check it out\n\non my way to Cape Cod.\n\nNew Bedford’s story is that during the first half of the\n\nnineteenth century it replaced Nantucket and Provincetown as the leading\n\nwhaling city in America and the world. Ships based in the port went out to the\n\noceans all over the world to hunt whales which at the time were the source of\n\nthe highest quality oil for candles and lubricants. The industry made New\n\nBedford one of the richest communities in American on a per capita basis. The\n\nwhaling industry declined in the latter half of the nineteenth century as whale\n\nstocks got depleted and new sources of fuel like petroleum were found. In that\n\nera, though, the textile industry boomed and New Bedford grew into one of the\n\nbiggest mill towns and producers of cloth in America. From the 1920s onwards,\n\nthough, those mills moved to the cheaper, non-unionized southern states and New\n\nBedford fell into decline in a pattern similar to what has happened in factory\n\ntowns across the country as industrial production of labor-intensive goods has\n\nmoved overseas .\n\nThe whaling industry and the textile mills attracted a\n\nsomewhat unusual mix of immigrants to New Bedford. The Azores and Cape Verde\n\nislands were both whaling centers themselves and also on the circuit for\n\npicking up supplies for American whaling ships which picked up a lot of crew\n\nfrom those Portuguese lands. Azoreans, Madeirans, and Cape Verdeans came to\n\nmake up a majority of New Bedford’s population, one of the few large settlements\n\nof those ethnicities anywhere in the country. Azoreans even eventually replaced\n\nYankees as ship owners and financiers to the industry. Even today New Bedford’s\n\npopulation consists heavily of people whose ancestry is from the Portuguese\n\nislands along with French-Canadians who came later to work in the mills and\n\nrecent immigrants from Central America.\n\nA second significant aspect of New Bedford’s history is the\n\nleading role the city played in the so-called Underground Railroad in the\n\ndecades before the Civil War. New Bedford was a hotbed of abolitionism led by\n\nits large Quaker population (which also founded the whaling industry) and\n\nbecame a safe haven for escaped slaves as well as having one of the North’s\n\nlargest populations of free Blacks .\n\nNew Bedford’s history is chronicled in the National\n\nHistorical Park’s visitor center and in some of the buildings that surround it\n\nin the historic center of town, some of which weren’t open at the time of my\n\nvisit. The National Park unit essentially consists of several historic buildings\n\nwithin a larger historic district rather than a large a park. I also walked up\n\nthe hill through town to the neighborhoods that housed New Bedford’s elites during\n\nthe city’s heyday. Many of the grand homes eventually became boarding houses\n\nand are now used as law offices, inns, or have been divided up into condominiums.\n\nOne great home that can be visited, though, is the Rotch-Jones-Duff House &\n\nGarden Museum, originally owned by whaling merchant William Rotch, which\n\nchronicles the economic and social evolution of the city.\n\nNew Bedford’s biggest single attraction is its Whaling\n\nMuseum which takes up an entire city block. I have to admit to some reluctance\n\nin paying a significant fee to go into a historical museum because many just\n\naren’t very good . The New Bedford Whaling Museum is an exception, though. It\n\ncovers almost every aspect of whaling’s long history, the natural history of\n\nwhales, replica ships and whaleboats, whaling in art, literature, and film,\n\nextensive exhibits of scrimshaw and other artefacts using whale bones, social\n\nand economic history of the whalers from Cape Verde and Azores. One gallery is\n\ndedicated entirely to Herman Melville’s “Moby Dick”, a novel that was, of\n\ncourse, mostly set in the open seas but with parts in the home port of New\n\nBedford.\n\nConsistent with its history, New Bedford has again become\n\ntied to a maritime industry. Over the last few decades New Bedford has replaced\n\nGloucester and Boston as the biggest fishing port in the continental U.S. by\n\nvalue of its catch, largely cod, haddock, flounder, sole, and scallops. The\n\npiers where the fishing boats bring in their catch are adjacent to the center\n\nof town. While I didn’t see any fish coming in, the piers were still a hive of\n\nactivity and men working on and cleaning their boats when I was there .\n\nIn many parts of the northeastern U.S. a majority of\n\nrestaurants specialize in Italian cuisine since Italians are one of the main\n\nethnicities and have a much more interesting cuisine than Irish (excluding pubs),\n\nYankees, or French Canadians. In New Bedford, though, most of the restaurants\n\nare Portuguese, so I had no choice but to check on Trip Advisor and at the\n\ninformation desk at the National Park for recommendations on the best\n\nPortuguese restaurant in town. It looks like it will be Antonio’s, a\n\nfamily-style pub and restaurant near the entrance to the Interstate in north\n\nNew Bedford. Wow, the food was amazing! I had trouble deciding what to get from\n\nthe extensive menu but went with the waitress’s recommendation to get the\n\nPaella.\n\nWell, I know from travel in Spain and Portugal that\n\nPortuguese rice dishes (Arroces) are different from true Spanish paella’s in\n\nthat they are somewhat more similar to risottos. While Paella is usually not\n\nstirred creating a desirable crunchy crust on the bottom and the rice is cooked\n\nto quite dry, Portuguese rice dishes are stirred and much wetter . Despite the\n\npaella name, my dish was much more in the Portuguese style.\n\nWhen my dish arrived my initial response to the waitress\n\nwas, “Ummm, I only wanted the portion for one person.”\n\n“That is the portion for one person. The two person size\n\nportion is twice as big!”\n\nAnd yes, looking around the room at the others diners’\n\ntables, their dishes of varying goodies were similarly gigantic. I overheard\n\none lady commenting that the appetizer she ordered was bigger than the main\n\ncourses in most restaurants. My massive pan of soup rice contained what must\n\nhave been half a lobster, pieces of crab legs, huge succulent scallops,\n\nnumerous clams and mussels in the shell, chunks of chicken and beef, and some\n\nvegetables like red and green peppers. I stuffed myself and made it through all\n\nthe shellfish but still had almost half the dish left when I could eat no more.\n\nThan has never, ever happened to me before; I always finish my restaurant meals\n\nand appreciate big manly portions. But this, though, was ridiculous. My late\n\nlunch/early dinner was enough that I didn’t need to eat anything else that day\n\nand had the remaining half of my paella for breakfast the next morning. If you’re\n\never in New Bedford, go to Antonio’s!\n\nNowadays I belong to a Gold’s Gym for working out. Gold’s is\n\na national chain and has locations around the country, so when I travel I look\n\nup their locations and try to work out when I can . Gold’s has a gym in New\n\nBedford, so that’s actually where I started out my day with an early workout\n\nbefore exploring the town. The gym is on the north side of town in a very\n\nworking class area where neighborhoods of closely packed two and three story\n\nhouses abut huge brick buildings that used to be textile mills, the old New\n\nBedford that built the whaling town into a leading industrial city of its era.\n\nI suspect the modern gym building and parking lots and fields around it are on\n\nthe location of what used to be old mills that have since been torn down. I’m\n\nnot sure what is planned for the remaining buildings. In a more affluent and\n\nbigger city they’d be prime real estate for conversion into residential lofts,\n\nbut I’m not sure if there’s much of a market for that in a relatively poor\n\nworking-class city like New Bedford.\n\nOverall New Bedford was a very interesting and worthwhile\n\nstop. I’d highly recommend it for anyone heading to “The Cape” or “The Islands”\n\nto spend a few hours there, or if nothing else load up on a fantastic\n\nPortuguese meal at Antonio’s ."
