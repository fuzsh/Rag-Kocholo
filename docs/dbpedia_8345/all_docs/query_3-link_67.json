        "text": "The City of New Bedford and the Zeiterion Performing Arts Center are sponsoring a series of weekly outdoor music concerts beginning on Thursday July 8 at the Custom House Square Park. The Summer Sound Series will feature some of the best local musicians from the Greater New Bedford area.\n\n“We look forward to welcoming people back to our vibrant downtown with music and much more this summer,” said New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell. “The Summer Sound Series is a chance to enjoy the season and gather with family and friends.”\n\nResidents and visitors are invited to bring a chair or blanket to Custom House Square Park each Thursday from 4p.m. until 7p.m. to hear the music – or grab a spot in a seated, limited-capacity cordoned-off beer garden, where beer and wine will be available for purchase.\n\nHere's the rundown of performers provided by the City:\n\nThursday, July 8:\n\nButch McCarthy: Butch McCarthy has performed throughout the SouthCoast for more than 50 years, blending original songs with his take on popular cover songs. His band, The Gentlemen of Leisure, has backed him for a decade. Joining Butch on stage will be Steve Mazza on bass and JB Borges on drums.\n\nThursday, July 15:\n\nPearly Baker Acoustic Quartet: For the past 36 years, The Pearly Baker Band has been playing their version of Grateful Dead music, with some Stones, Beatles, and JJ Cale thrown in for good measure. Even when they go acoustic, there’s still electricity in the air. Please join them for what promises to be a sweet evening of song and dance.\n\nThursday, July 22:\n\nMonteiroBots: Praised as a “force to be reckoned with” by Shaquille O’Neal, saxophonist Marcus Monteiro continues to impress his audience with intensity, interpretation and consummate improvisational skills. In recent years, Marcus has shared the stage with The O’Jays, The Rebirth Brass Band, George Clinton, Tavares, and Cirque du Soleil, among many others. His band The MonteiroBots features Marcus on saxophones, Chris Bryant on guitar, Nick Sanfilippo on keyboard, Rob Massoud on bass, and Erick Cifuentes on drums.\n\nThursday, July 29:\n\nMark T. Small: Guitarist Mark T. Small is an internationally recognized musician and entertainer who has performed throughout the United States and Europe. His CD was named Best Acoustic Blues Album in 2014, and his recordings have reached the top 20 on National Music Charts. His concerts feature music from the early 1800s to the late 1950s, including his signature foot-stompin’ blues, boogie, early rock, and honky-tonk selections. Instrumental selections include America The Beautiful, Amazing Grace, Autumn Leaves, Maple Leaf Rag, and many other dazzling, fancy guitar arrangements.\n\nThursday, August 5:\n\nDjim Job: Born on the island of São Vicente and raised in the U.S., Djim Job grew up in a family of musicians. Considered to be one of the most prominent Cabo Verdean musicians today, he has performed and produced for over 25 years in over 30 countries and across four continents for artists such as Bana, Cesária Évora, Ildo Lobo, and many more. His performances around the world have earned him the prestigious Outstanding Preservation of Cabo Verdean Culture Award. Djim Job has always explored various musical genres and instruments, but it is the bass that has made him one of the most sought-after award-winning artists.\n\nThursday, August 12:\n\nKim Trusty: The dynamic and multi-faceted Kim Trusty is a powerful and diverse vocalist, songwriter, guitarist and actress. She has spent the last three decades residing in Providence, refining her musical skills, crafting and branding her own style of jazz, R&B, blues and original music. In the last two decades, Kim’s reputation has moved well beyond the Ocean State as a consummate vocalist, lyricist, and songstress. She’s worked with some of the industry’s best, including Paula Cole, Richie Havens, and Rick Danko. Joining Trusty on stage will be Cathy Clasper-Torch.\n\nThursday, August 19:\n\nThe Jethros: The Jethros realized their common destiny while collaborating in a backup band and have since become a fixture in the folk music scene of New Bedford and nearby places. Homer Jethro sings and plays guitar, banjo, and mouth organ; Rufus Jethro sings and plays trumpet, trombone, and uke, Skillet Jethro sings and caresses the drums, Boney Jethro whistles and plays fiddle, bones, and other small percussions; and Gaston Jethro plays bass as though it were seven distinct instruments. Together they are The Jethros, and they are delighted to present their folk/blues/alt/soul/swing/jazz/bluegrass/funk/country/mariachi/klezmer stylings to one and all.\n\nThursday, August 26:\n\nRebecca Correia: Splitting her time and musical career between Nashville and the SouthCoast, Rochester native Rebecca Correia has been lauded as \"one of the best singer-songwriters in America.\" Self-described “Sheryl Crow meets Gavin DeGraw,” she recently co-wrote the song 'So Long Goodbye' with three-time Grammy-winner Keb' Mo'. With five CD releases, she is a dynamic performer who accompanies herself on guitar, piano, and mandolin. She has opened for a number of artists, including Natasha Bedingfield, Shawn Colvin, Livingston Taylor, among many others. She also regularly shares the stage with friends Matt Cusson and fellow Hartt alumni Javier Colon (NBC's The Voice).\n\nInformation from The City of New Bedford"
