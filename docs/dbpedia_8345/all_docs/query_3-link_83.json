        "text": "The cost to build a house in Massachusetts in 2024, broken down\n\nNo matter which state you’re in, the steps involved in building a house will vary depending on whether you’re buying a tract home — which is when a builder has bought a large tract of land to divide into lots and build out several homes — or if you’re building a custom home.\n\nRemember that the price ranges we’re providing are general estimates. Your agent and your builder can give you more accurate pricing information.\n\nHere is an at-a-glance look at the average costs of each phase of the building, but we will break it all down next:\n\nBuilding Phase Average Cost Nationwide (2024) Foundation $9,143 Framing $4,164 – $32,000 Roof $5,844 – $12,867 Siding $11,450 Appliances $10,875 HVAC System $8,000 Plumbing System $2,280 – $5,120 Electrical System $6,000 – $22,500 Building Permits $500 – $2,000 Finishes and Fixtures $42,000 – $175,000\n\nBuying a plot of land ($102,200 per acre)\n\nPrices of building lots in New England, where Massachusetts is located, have historically been among the most expensive in the country, according to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB).\n\nThat reputation has gotten more robust, with prices for housing lots in the region seeing the largest year-over-year price gains in 2023. One reason that housing lots are so expensive in New England is that local zoning regulations often require large lots and low-density development, the NAHB noted. Half of the recent builds in the region are on lots of at least 0.8 acres.\n\nIn Western Massachusetts, lots are typically one-quarter acre, Garcia said.\n\nLand for homebuilding costs about $87,000 per acre in Massachusetts, according to StorageCafe. Building lots in Boston average $230 per square foot, which exceeds $1.5 million per acre.\n\nFoundation ($4,043 – $14,351)\n\nFoundation costs will vary depending on whether you’re pouring a slab or digging a basement, but a typical price range is between $4,043 and $14,351.\n\nAlmost all homes in Massachusetts are built with basements. A one-story ranch, a popular style in the state, requires a larger basement than a two-story house, and the more extensive basement means the contractor has to pour more concrete, Garcia notes.\n\nFraming ($14,000 – $32,000)\n\nFraming is when the sticks go up and a structure starts to take shape. Expect to pay between $14,000 and $32,000 for this phase of building a house in Massachusetts. Framing costs tend to vary due to both the size of the home and the complexity of its design — a one-story home with 2,000 square feet of living space will generally be less expensive to frame than a two-story home with duplicate square footage.\n\nRoof ($5,844 – $12,867)\n\nRoofing doesn’t come cheap — whether putting one on a new house or replacing the roof on an existing home. The costs of a new roof typically range from $5,844 – $12,867.\n\nThe most common roofing material in Massachusetts is asphalt shingles. According to Manta, the average price of a new shingle roof in Springfield is $7,473, generally ranging from $6,543 to $8,404. Again, the style of the home will affect the cost because a one-story home has a larger roof than a house with duplicate square footage on two floors.\n\nAsphalt roof shingles are sold in “squares,” the price per square is $80 to $550, including installation, or roughly $1 to $5.50 per square foot.\n\nSiding ($5,000 – $14,000)\n\nSiding is another significant variable: Are we talking vinyl, wood, brick, concrete, stone, stucco, or something else entirely? Siding costs range between $5,000 and $14,000, with vinyl or engineered wood siding typically costing between $3 and $12 per square foot.\n\nNew homes in Massachusetts typically have vinyl siding, Garcia said. HomeAdvisor puts the price for vinyl siding at $3 to $12 per square foot, with installation adding another $6,000 to $16,000 to the final price.\n\nAppliances ($10,875)\n\nAppliance pricing also varies widely. Depending on brand, functionality, finish, and so on, you’ll spend an average of $10,875 if the home does not come with any, but you can drop up to $24,400 or more on high-end appliances.\n\nHVAC System ($8,000)\n\nThe installation of a new heating and cooling system could cost upwards of $8,000, depending on the size of your home.\n\nPlumbing System ($2,280 – $5,120)\n\nPlumbing can cost anywhere from $2,280 to $5,120 on average — not including fixtures like sinks and toilets.\n\nElectrical System ($601 – $2,497)\n\nThe cost to wire a house is, on average, between $601 and $2,497.\n\nBuilding Permits (Variable)\n\nPermits vary by state, city, and county, but they typically range from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand. All new construction and renovations in Massachusetts must have a building permit by law. In addition to the building permit, the home may also need permits for plumbing, electrical, and other systems.\n\nIn Boston, for example, the building permit cost is $50, plus $10 for every $1,000 of the estimated work cost. So, for a $300,000 home, the building permit would be $3,050. The plumbing permit costs $20 plus $5 for every plumbing fixture in the home. The electrical permit cost is based on how much power the home’s system is designed to handle, so bigger systems cost more.\n\nFinishes and Fixtures (Variable)\n\nFinishes and fixtures comprise everything from countertops to sinks and lighting to flooring. Pricing varies widely and depends heavily on your preferences.\n\nAverage carpet installation costs can start at several hundred dollars and go up to $2,810, while hardwood flooring installation starts at around $2,480 on up to $7,028.\n\nLaminate countertops range from $841 to $1,732, while granite averages from $2,250 to $4,500.\n\nBuilding a custom home vs. home in development\n\nGenerally, building a custom home tailored to your every need will be more expensive than buying a tract home from a builder.\n\nAccording to Garcia, building a custom home in Massachusetts will cost $350 or more per square foot, while building a tract home in Massachusetts will cost $280 per square foot.\n\nBuilding a custom home will also require you to assemble a team of experts to design and build the home from start to finish. Here are the team members you will need and a breakdown of what they might cost you:\n\nArchitect (5% – 20% of the final build cost)\n\nHiring an architect will be integral to making your vision come to life when building your custom dream home. Before you search for the right architect, get clear about what you are looking for. Be sure to do your research and ask your network for recommendations for architects in your area who have experience designing the kind of home you are looking to build.\n\nThe cost of hiring an architect could make up anywhere between 5% and 20% of the final cost of the build. For a 2,000-square-foot home in Massachusetts, with a final build cost of $700,000, that would amount to $35,000 to $140,000. Some architects will charge by the hour or per square foot of the build for their services, but this is less common.\n\nGeneral Contractor (10% – 20% of the final build cost)\n\nA general contractor will oversee the entire process of building your custom home — they will also be responsible for hiring and paying subcontractors, vendors, and construction workers. General contractors typically charge a “cost-plus” fee arrangement which accounts for the cost of the labor and materials plus a negotiated fee for the general contractor. This usually comes out to 10% to 20% of the final cost of the build.\n\nCosts of building a custom house in Massachusetts\n\nAs we mentioned, building a custom home usually comes with additional costs. Again, your agent can help you determine more accurate costs — these are average figures provided to give you an idea.\n\nLand survey ($375 – $745)\n\nLand surveys, which identify your property lines and land features, range between $375 and $745.\n\nExcavation and grading ($20,000 – $100,000 per acre)\n\nIf you’re buying a tract home, the land price will be rolled into the overall price to build a home. If you’re buying a lot and building a custom home, you’ll have to pay to clear the land, run utilities, and put in a driveway. The price can vary widely, depending on the size and features of the lot and how far it is from town.\n\nThe cost to clear a lot ranges from $200 to $6,000 per acre, according to Angi.com, with another $0.47 to $2.28 per square foot if you want the land leveled out.\n\nIf you choose an excavator rather than a land clearing firm, they’ll charge by the cubic foot for what they move, whether dirt, rocks, or trees. Expect to pay $40 to $100 per cubic foot, Angi reports.\n\nIn rural Massachusetts, where sewer hookups aren’t available, you’ll have to install a septic tank and a well. One of Garcia’s clients recently got an estimated $25,000 for a septic system alone.\n\nCommon home styles in Massachusetts and their average costs\n\nThe two most common styles of homes built in Massachusetts are ranch style and colonials, according to Garcia. Ranch homes typically have an open concept area that includes the kitchen, dining area, and family room. Bedrooms are usually on both sides of the home, with an open area in the middle. The colonial floor plan isn’t as open, and the bedrooms are usually on the second floor.\n\nAccording to Fixr, the typical prices for these styles are:\n\nHome style Average cost (all-in) Ranch $200,000 – $600,000 Colonial $407,500 – $570,500\n\nMore affordable options for building a home in Massachusetts\n\nWhile a bare-bones building strategy can get you into a new construction home for less, cheaper isn’t always better. Shoddy build quality will inevitably lead to problems down the road — anything from a leaky roof to poor sound insulation can be a frustrating discovery when you’ve only been in your new home for a few months — and there’s value in creating a home you genuinely want, not just one you’re settling for.\n\nAlternative home-building options can give you more for your money and offer valuable flexibility during the construction process.\n\nTiny homes\n\nA tiny house is usually 600 square feet or less. They’re not ideal for large families, but building a tiny house can be faster and more affordable than a conventional home if a smaller space fits your lifestyle. On average, building tiny homes cost between $30,000 and $60,000.\n\nThey can also be a great option as a starter house — especially since construction of new starter homes in Massachusetts has declined between 24% and 31% since 1980.\n\nModular and prefabricated homes\n\nModular and prefab homes are allowed in any area in Massachusetts that is zoned for housing, says Fred Kozyra, owner of Kozyra Construction, a Brimfield, Massachusetts, company specializing in custom modular homes.\n\nModular houses are built to the same standards as site-built houses, he explains, adding that buyers shouldn’t confuse a modular home with a mobile home or manufactured home, which is built to a different standard. Mobile homes must be placed in mobile home parks in most areas of the state, Kozyra shares.\n\nAs with a site-built home, the per-square-foot price of a modular house will depend on the features and finishes you select, Kozyra says.\n\nIs the cost of building a house in Massachusetts cheaper than buying?\n\nGenerally, buying an older home will be cheaper than building a home. In Massachusetts, buying an existing home will cost around $629,000 on average, depending on the neighborhood. On the other hand, building a home will likely cost an average of $575,927.\n\nWhile building a home will almost always come with a higher price tag upfront, there are some long-term savings that new construction homeowners enjoy:\n\nEnergy efficiency: Newly constructed homes are generally more energy efficient than older homes — homes built after 2000 use 21% less energy than older homes on average, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. This is partially due to stricter energy regulations and better insulation and windows in new homes.\n\nNew home warranties: New construction homes are often covered under builder warranties for a specified period. When purchasing an older home, most key systems, such as the HVAC, roof, and plumbing, will be older and no longer covered under any kind of warranty.\n\nFewer maintenance costs in the first few years: With a newer home, you can count on your HVAC, plumbing, electrical system, and more to function correctly with little required maintenance in your first few years of homeownership. Older homes will likely have older roofs and systems, requiring you to pay for replacement much sooner.\n\nNew homes might be cheaper to insure: Many homeowners’ insurance providers offer discounts for new construction homes due to the lessened risk of damages common in aging homes."
