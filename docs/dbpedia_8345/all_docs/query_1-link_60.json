        "text": "WASHINGTON – Feb. 1 2013 — The court-approved settlement agreement in Oceana v. Blank challenging the NMFS approval of 2012 sector operations plans on grounds that the level of at sea monitoring (ASM) coverage of sector operations plans was not adequately explained or justified.\n\nOn May 31, 2012, Oceana filed a Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief challenging a rule that defined the Service's at-sea monitoring and enforcement obligations related to sectors operating under the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan for fishing year 2012, ECF No.1.\n\nA settlement agreement was entered into between plaintiff Oceana, Inc. and federal defendants Dr. Rebecca Blank, in her official capacity as Acting Secretary of the United States Department of Commerce, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the National Marine Fisheries Service.\n\nAn excerpt from the agreement follows:\n\n1. On or before the date of publication in the Federal Register of the proposed rule to approve sector operations plans in the Northeast Multispecies Fishery, which for the upcoming fishing year is expected to occur on or about January 31, 2013, the Service will publish in the Federal Register the appropriate level of observer coverage for at-sea monitoring (as defined in 50 C.F.R. § 648.2) that is required for sector vessels operating in the Northeast Multispecies Fishery, as well as the web address (URL) that will have, in an online, text-searchable format, a summary of the Service's analyses regarding the appropriate level of observer coverage (unless the Fishery Management Plan for the Northeast Multispecies Fishery is modified in such a way that the Service no longer has responsibility for setting that level of at-sea monitoring). That summary shall include (1) a description of the data upon which the Service relied; (2) summary tables or graphs of that data the Service prepared; (3) a presentation of the data for each sector, by stock and gear, including the number of unique vessels, discarded pounds, the number of subtrips, the number of observed subtrips, the percent of subtrips observed, the realized stock coefficient of variation (\"C.Y.\"), and the percent observer coverage required to achieve the minimum c.y. of 30% (except where the disclosure of such data would conflict with ~ 4 below); and (4) an explanation of the standards the Service applied to that data to determine the appropriate level of coverage (including, but not limited to, the target c.y. and the standards used to ensure observer data as a whole, including the data from both the Northeast Fishery Observer Program and at-sea monitors, is accurate and timely). The Service will also present the data referred to in subparagraphs (2) and (3) for previously completed fishing years from 2010 forward, as well as the upcoming fishing year for which the analyses are conducted.\n\n2. The Service will publish the summary analyses referenced in Paragraph I for the 2013, 2014, and 2015 fishing years, each time in the same manner and subject to the same qualifications that appear in that paragraph (unless the Fishery Management Plan for the Northeast Multispecies Fishery is modified in such a way that the Service no longer has responsibility for setting the level of at-sea monitoring).\n\n3. If the Service changes the at-sea monitoring level for sector vessels for a particular fishing year after the Federal Register publication referenced in Paragraph 1 but before the issuance of the final rule approving the sector contracts, the Service will announce the change in that final rule and explain the change online at the same address referenced in Paragraph 1.\n\n4. Nothing in this Agreement requires or authorizes the Service to disclose any confidential information in violation of the confidentiality provisions of the MSA, 16 U.S.C. § 1881a. For the purposes of 16 U.S.C. § 188Ia(b)(1)(C), this Agreement does not constitute a \"court order\" requiring the disclosure of such confidential information.\n\nRead the complete agreement as filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia\n\nJanuary 29, 2013 — Former Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Harshbarger, Senior Counsel at Proskauer Rose LLP, conducted an independent four-month review of allegations made against the Gloucester Fishing Community Preservation Fund. The report found no credible basis to support the allegations, and deemed them to be without merit. The fund hired Proskauer to conduct an independent assessment of its governance, policies and operations after receiving a letter from state Senator Bruce Tarr and state Representative Ann Margaret Ferrante concerning alleged complaints, including conflicts of interest, nepotism, insider trading and improper kickbacks.\n\nThe following was released by Proskauer Rose LLP:\n\nJanuary 29, 2013 (Boston) – An independent review of serious allegations made against a Gloucester nonprofit fund that has been serving the region’s fishing community for five years found no credible proof of accusations of misconduct made against the fund or its leadership.\n\nThe 45-page report is the result of an exhaustive, four-month investigation by Proskauer Senior Counsel Scott Harshbarger. The inquiry found no convincing evidence in support of allegations that board members of the Gloucester Fishing Community Preservation Fund violated their fiduciary duty to the fishermen of Gloucester, failed to adhere to charitable governance rules or engaged in alleged unfair, deceptive and untoward business practices.\n\n“Our investigation found that there is simply no credible basis to support the allegations. To the contrary, they are without merit,” said Mr. Harshbarger, who is a former Massachusetts Attorney General.\n\nSince its founding in 2007, the mission of this nonprofit fund has been to safeguard and enhance the economic engine of Gloucester and Cape Ann. In August 2012, the organization hired Proskauer to conduct an independent assessment of its governance, policies and operations after the fund received a letter from state Senator Bruce Tarr and state Representative Ann Margaret Ferrante concerning alleged complaints, including conflicts of interest, nepotism, insider trading and improper kickbacks.\n\nBased on the investigation of the facts, the report found:\n\n– No violations of the fiduciary duties of care, loyalty and independence by any board member\n\n– No failure on the part of the board to adhere to accepted charitable governance and operational policies and procedures\n\n– No reasonable or credible factual basis on which to conclude that any members of the board obtained an unfair business advantage, took kickbacks, engaged in collusion or in any way engaged in conduct constituting a conflict of interest.\n\nDespite the findings, the report recommended a package of governance improvements to help it avoid similar future allegations. Among the improvements are expanding the fund’s board members, publishing details of how fishing permits are allocated and reviewing its process for qualifying fishermen.\n\n“These changes, which follow best practices for nonprofits of the fund’s size, scope and history, will help it continue to serve the Gloucester fishing industry,” Mr. Harshbarger said.\n\nMr. Harshbarger has briefed Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley’s office, community leaders and many in the fishing industry on the investigation and the report’s finding.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe Gloucester Fishing Community Preservation Fund (the “Fund”) was established as a non-profit organization in 2007 to distribute fishing rights to individuals who participate in the Gloucester fishing industry. The Fund’s board of directors (the “Board”) consists of prominent members of the Gloucester community, most of whom have longstanding involvement in the Gloucester fishing industry. The Board and Fund have been targets for regular criticism from the outset, including publicly in articles and blogs published in The Gloucester Daily Times. The Board decided in August 2012 to retain Proskauer Rose LLP (“Proskauer,” “we,” or “us”) to conduct an independent investigation of all of these allegations in light of the governance and operational conduct of the Fund.\n\nIn particular, the Board asked Proskauer to investigate allegations of wrongdoing including conflicts of interest, nepotism, “insider trading,” improper kickbacks and other monetary improprieties and unfair business advantages. After an extensive review, including legal and factual research, board member interviews and interviews of members of the Gloucester fishing industry and general community, we have completed our investigation and have prepared this report for such action as the Board deems appropriate.\n\nAs detailed in our report, we have made three key findings in connection with our investigation:\n\nFirst, we found that the Fund has played a vital role in the Gloucester fishing community. Its mission and leadership are industry lifelines and its existence is a critical force in preserving the local business community. It is this very success, as well as the prominent roles in Gloucester of members of the Board, that seems to have triggered the allegations directed at the Fund and its alleged governance flaws, or the appearance thereof.\n\nSecond, we quickly found that all allegations emanate from a handful of individuals in the community who asserted allegations and engaged in an unfounded negative media blitz against the Fund and its members, particularly Executive Director Vito Giacalone.\n\nThird, we found that the regulatory structure overseeing the fishing industry is complex to the point that many people in Gloucester, in addition to individuals in the fishing community, do not understand how it works. Similarly, many of the individuals with whom we spoke do not understand how the Fund was created, how it operates, how the Board makes decisions, how it ensures that the proper checks and balances are in place and that its transactions are transparent and fair. Lacking a real understanding of both the regulatory structure and the Fund, some are willing to accept allegations of conflict and collusion among the Fund, the Board and others as fact, innocently or otherwise.\n\nBased on our investigation, we conclude that there is no credible basis to support the allegations of wrongdoing. To the contrary, they are without merit. Accordingly, we found:\n\na) No violations of the fiduciary duties of care, loyalty, and independence by any board member;\n\nb) No failure on the part of the Board to adhere to accepted charitable governance and operational policies and procedures; and\n\nc) No reasonable or credible factual basis on which to conclude that any members of the Board obtained an unfair business advantage, took kickbacks, engaged in collusion, or in any other way engaged in conduct constituting a conflict of interest.\n\nNevertheless, we propose a handful of simple and common sense governance improvements to serve as a road map for the Board so that it may avoid similar baseless allegations or misperceptions in the future. These changes, following best practices for non-profits of the Fund’s size, scope and history, will help it continue to serve the Gloucester fishing industry.\n\nRead the complete report here\n\nNEW BEDFORD, Mass. — January 25, 2013 — There is more bad news for New England fishermen in the lead-up to next week's highly anticipated meeting of the New England Fishery Management Council.\n\nNOAA Fisheries Northeast director John K. Bullard informed the council in a letter that there is no room left under the law to allow anything but a total stop to overfishing for Gulf of Maine cod and haddock.\n\n\"The bad news is there are no fish,\" Bullard, a former New Bedford mayor, told The Standard-Times. \"That's the bad news that we've got to face.\"\n\n\"We reviewed our previous determination that the use of interim measures under …. the Magnuson Stevens Act is limited to one year and that overfishing must be ended for fishing year 2013,\" which starts May 1, Bullard wrote.\n\nBullard said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has shown it tries to be flexible but last year's delay in imposing heavy cuts produced no results.\n\n\"There's just bad news everywhere you look,\" Bullard said.\n\n\"There's a temptation to say 'Well, if we took an interim measure this will turn something into good news.' That's just an illusion. The interim measures we took last year didn't turn bad news into good news.\"\n\nSeafood consultant James Kendall said Thursday night that Bullard \"makes a lot of good points but the problem is the guys are in such deep straits that they're looking for what little relief they can get.\n\n\"He is just stating the letter of the law and trying to find ways to work within it.\"\n\nAdded Kendall: \"I think there's going to be a lot of disappointed fishermen.\"\n\nRecent reviews of stock assessments released last week propose that a cut in catch limits of from 61 percent to over 80 percent might be required to protect dwindling stocks of Gulf of Maine cod and Georges Bank cod.\n\nRead the full story in the New Bedford Standard Times\n\nGLOUCESTER — November 29, 2012 — Finding the catch share trading system for groundfishermen working in voluntary cooperatives to be legal and proper, the U.S. First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston has rejected “all” the challenges to the arrangement brought by a large group of industry plaintiffs led by Gloucester and New Bedford, New England’s major fishing ports.\n\nBut in its ruling the three-judge panel presumed the completion of a regulatory action, now in a formative stage, that would control excess consolidation of the fishery, which was a core concern of many of the plaintiffs, fishermen and businesses from Maine to North Carolina.\n\nThe plaintiffs included U.S. Congressmen John Tierney, whose district includes Gloucester, and Barney Frank, who represents New Bedford.\n\nThe Conservation Law Foundation was allowed to intervene, allied with the government.\n\nThe 68-page ruling effectively ends the legal assault on Amendment 16, which instituted a radical change to the Northeast fishing industry, based on an allocation of the allowable catch to a limited number of participants who, if members of a cooperative or sector, can trade from their portfolio with other sectors to increase the value and efficiency of their effort.\n\nA core complaint by the plaintiffs, rejected by the court, was the adoption of the catch share system without putting the regimen to a binding referendum.\n\n“Not allowing a referendum on such a measure effectively leaves the fishery up for grabs to the highest bidder,” said Tierney in an email. “This isn’t in the best interest of fishermen.”\n\nOne attorney on the team that brought the suit, speaking anonymously, said the plaintiffs had exhausted their resources, so an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was unlikely.\n\nThe court affirmed a lower ruling made in 2011 by U.S. District Court Judge Rya Zobel, who found that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had followed the dictates of Congress embedded in the re-authorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. Both Zobel and the Court of Appeals found that NOAA’s interpretations of the act warranted legal deference as defined in the Administrative Practices Act.\n\nRead the full story in the Gloucester Times\n\nNEW BEDFORD, Mass. — November 29, 2012 — A federal appeals court Wednesday swept aside a lawsuit by this city and Gloucester challenging the new system of regulating the Northeast fishery.\n\nThe 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals struck down every one of a number of arguments the cities and their co-plaintiffs in the industry made in their appeal.\n\nThe court upheld a 2011 lower court decision in the suit brought by the two ports as well as fishermen and fishing groups. Broadly speaking, the court ruled that the government stayed within the letter and spirit of the 1976 Magnuson-Stevens Act, which was designed to end overfishing in the Northeast.\n\nMayor Jon Mitchell said late Wednesday that he had not seen the ruling but was disappointed. \"We'll take our time now to go through the opinion and see what our next steps are,\" he said.\n\n\"The point of pursuing the lawsuit was to help ensure that regulations that NOAA comes down with are fair and consider the very real ramifications that they might have on the fishing industry,\" Mitchell said.\n\n\"We will continue to make that point in other venues, including Congress,\" he said.\n\nFormer mayor Scott Lang said Wednesday night that he believes the city's arguments were valid and well presented. But he acknowledged that overturning government regulators' decisions is hard to do.\n\n\"It's extremely difficult to flip it in the courts,\" Lang said.\n\nHe added that he was pleased that the court at least took time in its more than 60-page ruling to sift through the arguments thoughtfully, if narrowly.\n\nRead the full story at the New Bedford Standard Times\n\nWASHINGTON (Saving Seafood) Nov. 29, 2012 – New Bedford City Solicitor John A. Markey, Jr. has written to supporters and plaintiffs in the wake of yesterday's ruling by United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit against the cities of New Bedford and Gloucester and industry plaintiffs in their challenge to Amendment 16, the framework for the federal government's fisheries catch share system.\n\nThe text of his letter follows:\n\nFriends of New Bedford:\n\nI write today to thank you for your donation of time, talent and treasure to support the City of New Bedford and the hardworking people engaged in the City’s fishing industry. Attached hereto is the sixty eight page decision issued late today by the First Circuit Court of Appeals denying the City's challenge of NMFS 2010 decision to implement a sector system which damaged many of the ground fishermen.\n\nAlthough we did not prevail before the First Circuit, the lengthy decision evidences the seriousness with which the Court was forced to consider the issues ably raised in the legal briefs written by Attorneys Mikaela McDermott, Julie Peterson and Pamela Lafreniere and capably argued by Attorney Jim Kavanaugh. In this process, the Agency has been forced to expend significant time and energy to defend its dubious positions and tortured interpretations of the law. By standing up to NMFS and by highlighting the manner in which the agency is frustrating congressional intent and endangering the well-being of America's Number One Fishing Port, this City's legal team and that team's supporters (you) have served a great purpose.\n\nAs Theodore Roosevelt once said:\n\nIt is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.\n\nYou are the person in the arena. And there is no greater devotion than our mission to advocate for our hometown, our people, and our way of life. It is with this in mind that I write to thank you for your support as we march forth remaining steadfast in our commitment to fight for our City and its people.\n\nSincerely –\n\nJohn A. Markey, Jr.\n\nNew Bedford City Solicitor\n\nBOSTON — November 28, 2012 — A federal appeals court on Wednesday rejected claims by New England’s two largest fishing ports that federal regulators improperly enacted fishing rules that they say are wiping out local fleets.\n\nThe 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision upheld a 2011 lower court ruling on a suit brought by the ports of New Bedford and Gloucester, as well as fishermen and fishing groups.\n\nThe plaintiffs argued the new rules were installed in 2010 without required safeguards, including a two-thirds referendum by fishermen that could have killed the changes before they were enacted. They asked the appeals court to order the lower court to implement the safeguards, alleging that without them, the industry’s smaller fishing businesses would be squeezed out.\n\nBut the three judge panel noted that, rather than destroying smaller business, many believe the new rules provide better protection. And it said federal regulators installed the law properly. ‘‘The Secretary (of Commerce's) judgments here were derived from the record, rational, and not based on any error of law,’’ the court wrote.\n\nThe old fishing management system tried to prevent overfishing mainly by limiting the number of days fishermen could go to sea. The new system allots portions of the catch for each species, such as cod and flounder, to individual fishermen. The fishermen then combine and manage those allotments in groups called sectors.\n\nThe ports — with support from U.S. Reps. Barney Frank and John Tierney — alleged that, under federal law, the change should have been subjected to a vote that never occurred. They said that because individual catch shares can be transferred among fishermen, the new system fosters broad industry consolidation, as larger fishing interests buy out fishermen whose catch shares are too paltry to support their business.\n\nNew Bedford Mayor Jonathan Mitchell expressed disappointment and said the city will consider whether to appeal.\n\n‘‘The general points we were trying to establish through the lawsuit will continue to be a goal for us here in New Bedford. That goal was to ensure that fisheries’ regulations are fair and take into consideration the interests of the fishing families and the communities they live in,’’ Mitchell said.\n\nRead the full Associated Press story by Jay Lindsay in the Boston Globe"
