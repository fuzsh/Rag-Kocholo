        "text": "What Is New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park?\n\nThis park preserves 12 buildings and a ship dating back to when New Bedford, Massachusetts was known as “The City That Lit the World!”\n\nWhat Makes It Historical?\n\nNew Bedford owes its maritime fame to the might of the British Navy! The city (f.k.a. Old Dartmouth, f.k.a. Accushnet) was a small whaling village, overshadowed by the island of Nantucket up until the Revolutionary War! New Bedford’s deep harbor and attachment to the mainland made it easier to recover after years of British blockades, and so by 1820, it started its ascent to becoming not just the whaling capital, but also the richest city in America per capita by 1857!\n\nWhaling voyages from New Bedford would spend up to four years at sea, killing northern right and sperm whales for their oil, which was burned for lighting and used for cosmetics. This oil could be processed ashore in buildings like the Rodman Candleworks, the money passing through the Double Bank, half serving tradesfolk and half serving business owners! The Custom House here in New Bedford was also super important because it not only registered ships and crews but also issued Protection Certificates to sailors so they could prove their citizenship at sea!\n\nNew Bedford features prominently in Herman Melville’s Moby Dick as the place where Ishmael meets Queequeg, and the two begin their doomed adventure, spending time in the Seaman’s Bethel before embarking! A center for abolition, New Bedford also jump-started the careers of mariner, Paul Cuffe, and newly freed Frederick Douglass!\n\nHow Can I #HelpTheHelpers?\n\nVolunteer at New Bedford Whaling National Historical Park!\n\nDonate to The New Bedford Port Society!\n\nBe a responsible visitor! Remember the old adages: Pack out what you pack in! Take nothing but pictures and leave nothing but footprints!\n\nHow Do I Get There?\n\nVisitor Center:\n\n33 William Street\n\nNew Bedford 02740\n\nWhaling Museum:\n\n18 Johnny Cake Hill\n\nNew Bedford, MA 02740\n\n(Take Me There!)\n\nWhen Should I Visit the Park?\n\nThe visitor center is open Wednesday through Sunday from 10:00 AM until 4:00 PM!"
