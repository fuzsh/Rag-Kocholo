For more than 30 years of designing and building new homes, Bristol Pacific has understood that and has had one primary focus—to design and build the perfect home for you and your family.\n\nWe deliver quality construction and take care of the details. We understand that you might love to entertain and that you might have always dreamed of a farmer’s sink in your dream kitchen, for example. Bristol Pacific’s reputation for going above and beyond has evolved from our unmatched craftsmanship, unrivaled quality, and most importantly, our ability to listen.\n\nWhether you choose one of our existing new construction homes in our beautiful developments or have us build on a lot you own, we’ll help you make your dream home a reality.\n\nWe would never put our name on a home that we wouldn’t be proud to live in ourselves, because in fact, we already do.\n\nOur commitments to quality, value and customer service have helped position us as the go-to construction and design contracting company in communities across Massachusetts, including Westport, Fall River, New Bedford, Acushnet, Freetown, Dartmouth, Swansea and others."
