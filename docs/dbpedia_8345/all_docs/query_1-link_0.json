        "text": "The New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal (NBMCT) has been engineered to be the most versatile heavy-lift cargo facility in the nation and is the first of its kind in North America.\n\nStrategically located in the heart of New England on the Atlantic Coast of the United States, the Terminal has easy access to open water and is in a prime position to take advantage of both domestic and international shipping opportunities.\n\nLeasing and docking space at the New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal is currently available.\n\nLatitude 41° 37’ 23” N Longitude 70° 54’ 50” W\n\nHigh Loading Capacity\n\nThe New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal’s high capacity quayside is supported by a system of cellular cofferdams, a pile-supported marginal wharf and geotechnical-component, and dense graded aggregate pavement that allows for heavy uniform and concentrated loads.\n\nWhereas many ports have a small quayside area specifically designated as the single hard point, over 21 acres of the New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal’s Main Terminal site has the ability to sustain uniform loads of 4,100 pounds per square foot (20 metric tons per square meter) and concentrated loads of up to 20,485 pounds per square foot (100 metric tons per square meter). This loading capacity allows for massive mobile cranes and self-propelled modular transporters (SPMTs) to operate throughout the site, increasing the efficiency of the work and providing logistical flexibility.\n\nThe highest uniform load capacity cargo facility quayside on the East Coast, the Terminal is capable of supporting a 1,350 metric ton crane lifting a 500 metric ton load at 30 meters along the entire 1,000-foot (305-meter) new bulkhead and throughout the more than 21-acre main facility.\n\nTariff Schedule\n\nDocking at the New Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal is subject to MassCEC’s Tariff Schedule:\n\nNew Bedford Marine Commerce Terminal Tariff Schedule No. 1 April 2016\n\nForms and Applications\n\nSubmit all forms and applications to Jeannie Houde, Terminal Manager.\n\nBerth Application\n\nStevedore License Application\n\nTerminal Access List\n\nSecurity\n\nHigh mast lighting provides illumination for the entire main facility, and the site perimeter is lined with an 8-foot tall chain-link fence, capped with three-strand barbed wire. Locked gates are available at the Potomska Street and Blackmer Street entrances. MassCEC provides security staff for foreign-flagged vessels visiting the Terminal (see published tariff schedule for more information) in compliance with 31 CFR part 105.\n\nAs a MARSEC facility, MassCEC cannot accommodate unscheduled visits to the Terminal. To schedule a tour of the Terminal, please contact Tim Griffin, Terminal Director. Normal business hours for the Terminal are 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM, Monday through Friday."
