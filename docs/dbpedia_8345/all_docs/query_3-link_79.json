        "text": "The New Bedford Mayor Jon Mitchell said state leaders launched the construction of a new housing project with a groundbreaking ceremony Tuesday morning.\n\nThe ceremony took place at 11 a.m. on 117 Union St., where the city said it will build a$27 million, five-story mixed commercial and residential building.\n\n“The creation of new housing units will help alleviate our housing shortage and boost activity around Custom House Square,” said Mitchell. “Not only will this project offer dozens of New Bedford residents a great place to live, but it will create additional population density in a walkable, thriving downtown.”\n\nMitchell announced plans to build affordable housing in the city . The plan, appropriately named Building New Bedford, will stimulate new housing development, reactivate underutilized properties and relieve housing instability, Mitchell said in March.\n\nALSO READ:\n\nOfficials said the project will combine new construction with the preservation of the historic Moby Dick Chandler Building to create 45 units of mixed-income housing and approximately 3,500 square feet of ground-floor retail space.\n\n\"These buildings will be the gateway to visitors and guests traveling from historic district to the upper Union Street restaurants and shops,\" said New Bedford Development Corporation President Steve Beauregard.\n\nThe mayor said the project will create a mix of units at varying price points, including 14 studio apartments, 21 one-bedroom apartments and 10 two-bedroom apartments."
