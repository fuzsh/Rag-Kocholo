        "text": "1970 July\n\nRace Riots broke out in the West End, a section of Kempton Street and a few blocks surrounded a neighborhood was barricaded with burned out over turned cars and refrigerators, barrels and lumber etc..Â\n\nOn July 9 three African American men got arrested on supposedly trumped up charges.\n\nWarren Houtman, arrested for driving with a defective light, Charlie Perry a known street fighter and Jimmy Magnett for just being there.\n\nMagnett had been outspoken in letters written to the Standard Times of New Bedford and at local meetings\n\nOn July 11, the three whites (one was Ralph Brown of Acushnet) got through the barrier blocking the streets and drove a 57 Chevy to the front of the \"Club\" on Kempton Street., the driver got out and laid a shotgun on the roof of the car and fired into the crowd killing Lester Lima and wounding several others.\n\nIt was said that the riots were over police brutality, unlawful arrests, the death of Lester Lima and the wounding of the others.\n\nSeveral tenement buildings in that neighborhood were burned in acts of arson. There were sniper incidents and looting. Many clashes between youths, local and state police and firefighters resulted in quite a few injuries.\n\nAt the time, there was no organized Black Panther Party in New Bedford, but Frank (Parky) Grace an ex-Vietnam Vet had been organizing and introducing Black Panthers to the locals.\n\nThe riots continued, and Edward Brooke a Black Republican Senator set up a committee to negotiate with the mayor and police.\n\nMore Black Panthers came to town and set up a headquarters in the partially burned and looted Pieraccini's Variety store on Kempton Street.\n\nAn outside classroom taught teachings of Mao and handed out Black Panther literature.\n\nPieraccini's was turned into a fort with sandbags and caches of weapons and gun slots etc.\n\nSoon afterward a white man told police that he had been shot in the ankle when driving by the \"fort.\"\n\nThe raid was on.\n\nA huge force of local police and support by state police helicopters overhead netted 21 people from Pieraccini's. A weapons cache was found under the floor.\n\nThe FBI questioned the prisoners and kept a file on them. They were charged with conspiracy to commit murder, anarchy and rioting.\n\nThe date for the trial stretched on until March and just before the trial the serious charges against those defendants were dropped.\n\nThe all white jury took 45 minutes to acquit the three whites of the charges of murder, and wounding the others with the shotgun.\n\nThis seemed to many city residents to be a shocking result for what was thought to be a clear case of murder.\n\nIt was widely thought throughout the city that a deal must have been made. Essentially everybody got off, and things quieted down.\n\nThe author lived through this time in the city and was almost killed in a close experience with it.\n\nRelated Article Itsabouttimebpp\n\nAnother excellent source to read about this Encyclopedia of Race Riots\n\n1978\n\nIn this year WHALE relocated three buidings, the Andrew Robeson, Caleb Spooner and Seth Russel Houses.\n\nThe Great Blizzard of '78\n\nThe massive destruction of the Blizzard of 1978 began on February 5, 1978.\n\nIt was caused by the coming together of a dense mass of low pressure off of the Carolina's coast and a Canadian high-pressure system.\n\nThe storm had tracked north and turned into a massive counter clock wise flow called a norâeaster depositing the bulk of the snowfall from the morning of February 6 until the evening of February 7.\n\nTop wind speeds were 86 miles per hour and gusts got up to 111mph. It was equivalent to a category 1 hurricane. The storm came during a new moon and produced significant flooding along the coast of New England where more than 1,700 homes suffered substantial damage or were destroyed, and 39,000 people took refuge in emergency shelters.\n\nThe federal government paid out $202,000,000.00 in disaster relief.\n\nThe 36 hour long blizzard produced 3 feet of snow with drifts as high as 15 feet.\n\nAt St. Luke's hospital in New Bedford many employees worked multiple shifts some sleeping there and working the next day.\n\nThere were emergency snow trucks and plow vehicles etc. on the roads that helped to ferry critical employees from home to work.\n\nRt 195 was shut down as traffic came to a stop.\n\nSome people died on Rt 95 near Boston due to snow that piled up and prevented the exhaust from escaping from their idling vehicles.\n\nAt the beginning when traffic had come to a stand still in the city this author and his then wife made an evening trek on foot to the local package store on Dartmouth Street and Orchard St. to get a nice bottle of Reunite Lambrusco wine.\n\nWe both worked at the hospital and luckily we lived nearby. I played music in a band at the time. The storm put not only musicians out of work, but nearly everyone not able to get out of their houses to travel.\n\nOne gigantic problem was disposal of the snow. It couldn't be plowed aside everywhere as there was too much of it, so it had to be loaded into trucks and carried away in some areas.\n\nIn New England, approximately 100 people died as a result of the storm.\n\nOn this site, we have a video covering the event of the storm."
