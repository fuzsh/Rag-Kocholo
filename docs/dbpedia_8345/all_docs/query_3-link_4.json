        "text": "New Bedford Walking Tour\n\nLocation: Corner of North 2nd Street and William Street\n\nBefore income taxes, the main source of revenue for the United States government was taxes on imports, all of which were collected at custom houses located at port cities and border crossings. The United States Custom House in New Bedford opened in 1836 and is still being used as such, making it the oldest custom house in the United States that is still being used as originally intended. Government agencies located in the building also enforce commercial fishing regulations in New Bedford. As an active government building, it is not open to the general public for tourist purposes.\n\nIn addition to being a tax collection point, captains of departing ships had to register their crews and cargo here. In a time before passports, crew members were issued identification papers known as protection papers. Only written descriptions of a person were included, so it was very easy for one person to use stolen, borrowed, or purchased papers of another person of similar description."
