        "text": "Rudolf of Habsburg[]\n\nRudolph, or Rudolf of Habsburg, was among most important military commanders and military governors of Emperor Romanos V during Imperial Restoration and participated on military reforms and reorganization during Imperial Reformation.\n\nHe is called \"Father of Foreigners\", as he organized non-Greek and non-Roman military units within Empire and also called \"Stalwart Defender of Empire\", for his role in defense of Dalmatia and in many imperial conquests.\n\nEarly life[]\n\nRudolf was born on May 1, 1218 in southwestern territories of Holy Roman Empire, in Germany, as son of Albert IV of Habsburg.\n\nIn early years, Rudolf trained on knight and was squire of Count of Laufenberg.\n\nAfter Albert death in 1245, Rudolf married Gertrude of Hohenberg, but their position was weakened during civil wars in Holy Roman Empire. Rudolf supported Pope against Frederick II of Hohenstaufen. This support led to uprising of Frederick loyalists and armed landlords, knights and various local bands attacked Rudolf.\n\nHe defeated them, repel their attack and force them to submit to Pope. To his much dismay, Pope did not grant him any rights, did not confirm him any position and declined pay him any reward for defeat of his enemies.\n\nThis had deep impact on Rudolf relations and stances toward Papal State. While he won and defeated Frederick loyalists, his treasure was exhausted, his levies weakened and he lost enormous sum of silver and gold in bloody clashes.\n\nMercenary[]\n\nAfter Winter 1246, Rudolf decided to make money by mercenary services. He was capable warrior, cunning tactician, ruthless warlord and strongman. From Spring 1246 until Spring 1248, Rudolf fought in various places.\n\nRudolf commanded group of Austrian and Swiss sellswords in Hungarian Army, during Battle of the Leitha River against tyrannical lord Frederick Babenberg.\n\nIn early 1247, Rudolf led 327 sellswords in service of Lordship of Ireland and helped defeat rebelling petty lords of Ireland.\n\nFrom July to September 1247, Rudolf participated on siege of Sevilla and defeat of Arabs and Moors. In Sevilla, Rudolf was responsible for defense of siege camps and repelling Arab assaults on camps.\n\n200 Swiss archers and 350 Austrians infantry commanded by Rudolf participated on decisive victory over Frederick II of Hohenstaufen in Battle of Parma in February 1248.\n\nIn Imperial service[]\n\nImperial Restoration[]\n\nAfter Parma, Rudolf was contacted by general Septimius Severu Flavius, commander-in-chief of Nicean loyalists, who in that time summoned and hired many foreign military experts, mercenaries and officers to join imperial forces. General Flavius appointed Rudolf as commander of light infantry.\n\nDespite first doubts of possible cooperation, as Romanos was distant relative of Frederick II of Hohenstaufen, Rudolf very soon recognized capabilities and talent of young ruler, as well as his gold and silver and great potential for reaching large loot and became very rich and powerful.\n\nGeneral Flavius grant Rudolf prestigeous title of ethnarchés, commander of foreign troops. Rudolf experiences with mercenaries and their formations were more similar to Imperial Army than his original experiences with levies and so he was able to fully integrate in to Imperial Army, despite he was contracted mercenary.\n\nAs ethnarchés, Rudolf was responsible for all non-Greek and non-Roman mercenaries, volunteers and troops. In this position, he recruited Franks, Britons, Normans and Germans to Imperial Army, but with few successes. Altogether, he was able to hire 571 mercenaries and volunteers from foreign lands, but even that counted and most of them fought in Siege of Thessaloniky.\n\nIn era of Imperial Restoration, Rudolf proved himself as field commander, rather than organizer and recruiter. In Battle of Thessaloniky, Rudolf commanded 800 infantry troops and 500 mercenaries in center of Thessaloniky defense and led raids against northern siege camps. As former defender of siege camps, he had wisdom about weaknesses and advantages of these camps and was able to use them, breakthrough and force enemies to fight him, while Frederick II cavalry and infantry attacked enemy in back.\n\nAfter great victory in Thessaloniky, Rudolf participated on long campaign against Venice and he was among officers, who supported Emperor Romanos decision to attack Venice, instead of capturing Constantinople. He commanded land forces moving through Dalmatia and led joint assaults on Venetian towns and port cities at Dalmatian coasts. He personally commanded imperial forces conquering and raiding Butrint, Ragusa and helped with siege of Zara.\n\nAfter fall of these cities and decision to restore imperial authority over Dalmatia, Rudolph was appointed to position of military governor (first appointed military governor, after forming this position in Chadenos reforms) of Dalmatia.\n\nIn Siege of Venice, Rudolph became pioneer of urban warfare tactic and was able to learn new experiences and methods from Venetian defenders, who fortified their districts, settlements, quarters and every each street and bridge. Rudolph armed his troops with short swords and better equipment and sent them to eliminate resistance in various quarters and observed whole combat. Rudolph was personally responsible for conquering Arsenal of Venice and destruction of this strategic military-industrial workshop of Venice.\n\nFall of Venice became first well documented urban warfare battle and Rudolph experiences were later used to improve Imperial Army.\n\nRudolph and his mercenaries victoriously conquered Dorsoduro, besieged and captured church of San Pantalon and cut off San Polo island of Venice from southern districts, which were bombarded by Imperial Fleet and secured by naval troops. Rudolph was defeated during first two attempts of capturing Basilica dei Frari, where he suffered large casualties (of 1,000 foreign mercenaries attacking Basilica, only 172 survived these attempts). Third and final, victorious, attempt was conduct by Varangian Guard led by unknown Varangian officer.\n\nRudolph left battlefield and moved to rear, where he overseen treatment of survivors, training of recruits and reinforcements and studied imperial and military administration, as he accepted that he can not return to his homeland, because now he is enemy of all his former allies and friends.\n\nAfter Fall of Venice, Rudolph successfully participated as field commander on Crete (where he commanded landing and naval invasion as advisor and aide of admiral Licarios) and in Achaea (where he commanded siege of Mystras). In both case, he was very successfull and helped Licarios, respectively Strategopulos and Constantine Argyros, in liberation of still-occupied lands. On Crete, he used Orthodox rebels and when remaining Venetian garrison struggle with rebels, he conquered eastern districts of Candia and allowed imperial naval troops to secure rest of city. On Achaea, he proved as talented organizer, as he was able to secure supplying siege troops from local villages and at the same time, he raided and destroyed various lairs of bandits, mostly former Latin knights and nobles, who after collapse of Latin Empire decide for career of rapists and looters and terrorized local villages.\n\nOn October 8, 1250, Rudolph was awarded with titles, life annuity and some lands of former Latin lords near Zara. He moved his wife Gertrude and his court to Zara. After this, his former castle and lands were raided and plundered by Lombard League and Papal supporters.\n\nMilitary Governor - \"Defender of Empire\"[]\n\nRudolph was among those who observed Emperor Romanos V coronation in Hagia Sophia and after Liberation of Achaea, he moved to Zara in order to take his office.\n\nRudolph regard military province of Dalmatia as vital for Roman Empire, because it was frontier territory near northern Italy, still ruled by anti-Imperial Lombard League. Province also controlling Adriatic Sea and is important in Mediterranean commerce.\n\nRudolph first step was secure province and eliminate all large bandit and pro-Latin rebel nests. He used his mercenaries and also founded mercenary guilds in province, which were granted special concession in religious freedom, so Catholic mercenaries can join these guilds and also join Imperial Army and Imperial Fleet.\n\nRudolph recruited his units from those Lombard cities, which were loyal to Emperor Frederick II, but were destroyed or defeated by anti-Imperial forces of Lombard League. He also granted job to exiled knights and mercenaries. With this, he recruited 1,247 troops from Italy and 365 from Austria. These troops, most of them veterans, became core of Dalmatian officer corps of Imperial Army and most experienced were put in to charge of training.\n\nRudolph divided armed forces in Dalmatia in to three classes:\n\nMilitia, composed mostly by peasants trained with short swords or war scythes and with light armour. General arming and training of peasants was important step to decrease crime rate and banditism, as all bandits must count that most peasants they attack, will be armed and trained, despite their training was very basic.\n\nCity Guard of well trained and well equiped forces, but tied to their hometown. Financed and trained partially by cities itself and partially by the Empire. They were trained for defending cities, for urban warfare, laying traps in streets, assaulting siege camps and also were assigned to eliminate criminals in their cities. At beginning, number of city guards were in whole Dalmatia only 372. These guards defended 20 cities in whole Dalmatia. When Rudolph moved to Bohemia, number of city guards was about 2,500.\n\nGarrison, formed by well armed, well trained and organized troops under Rudolph direct command and serving Imperial Army and Imperial Fleet. Their number increased from 1,500 at end of Imperial Restoration to 20,000 in 1265.\n\nRudolph focused on building military infrastructure - barracks, fortification, training fields and camps, guard towers, road outposts, recruitment centers, military blacksmiths and forges and also connecting local traders and artisans with military to secure supplying of food and light arms, without dependency on Empire (however, Empire provided all funding for these supplies). His efforts had positive impact on Dalmatian economy.\n\nRudolph work and efforts pay off, as Lombard League really attacked Dalmatia and Roman Empire in 1256, 1258 and 1264. During first attack, they plundered Istria and destroyed city Trieste. In 1258 and 1264 raids, Lombard League forces were defeated and during counter-attack personally led by Rudolph, 8,000 imperial troops raided Treviso, Vicenza, Ferrara and Padova. Rudolph did not tried to conquer cities, but rather plundered local farms, destroyed mines, roads, kidnapped 12,000 local people in to slavery and burned down pastures and field. Only Treviso was besieged, conquered and razed by Rudolph forces. This victories stopped all attempts of Lombard League to attack Dalmatia and probably had deep impact on planning of Manuel Angelos invasion of Roman Empire, as he moved through Serbia and Bosnia, instead by coasts of Adriatic Sea through Dalmatia, where he would be in better supplying and reinforcements conditions with Italian states.\n\nPolitical career[]\n\nRudolph also participated in politics. He was imperial senator of Dalmatia for 10 years, since 1255 to 1265 and was among senators supporting abolishing all state control over naval trade in Adriatic Sea. He cooperated with civilian governors and used his troops for public works.\n\nCivil War in Bohemia[]\n\nFor his experiences from Central Europe and Austria, Rudolph was among first commanders taken by Emperor Romanos V during his campaign in Bohemia and was present at coronation of Romanos to position of King of Bohemia.\n\nAfter coronation, during large feast, Emperor Romanos named Rudolph to position of military governor of Bohemia and tasked Rudolph to build strong garrison in Bohemia to protect Premysloides and imperial interests in rich kingdom.\n\nNext four years, Rudolph harshly and strictly implemented imperial military reforms and structures in to semi-feudal and feudal system of Bohemia, which persuaded many moderate supporters of Empire to join anti-Imperial opposition and also strenghtened opposition forces.\n\nRudolph, who underestimated opposition forces, especially on Moravia, focused on building military forces in Bohemia and was shocked when large-scale rebellion started during November 1267. Rebels killed many imperial officials, local prefects, destroyed granaries, damaged walls and ambushed many patrols and eliminated Romanos punitive corps with killing about 800 imperial troops.\n\nGeneral Diogenes Martus, deputy of Rudolph, was sent by Rudolph to suppress rebellion in Olomouc and Brno. Martus forces were encirceled and destroyed in Olomouc. 10,000 imperial troops and loyalists were killed or wounded and captured, which was about 80% of imperial garrison. Roman Empire was not able to sent reinforcements and rest of imperial forces in Bohemia were in Prague.\n\nRudolph decided ordered \"evacuation of Bohemia\". He negotiated with Hungarian King Béla IV and reached agreement that will allow loyalists to pass through Hungarian territory in to Roman Empire.\n\n50,000 loyalists (until 1312 another 300,000) with coronation jewels and crowns, were evacuated. Important morale victory was evacuation of \"Golden Bull of Sicily\" (document declaring Premyslid Dynasty as ruling dynasty of Bohemia), \"Golden Bull of Ulm\" (document declaring hereditary succession in Bohemia) and \"Golden Bull of Melf\" (declaring Bohemia as Kingdom and confirming hereditary primogeniture of Premyslids). These three documents were later used as special amendments of First Imperial Constitution.\n\nRudolph also ordered evacuation of all gold and silver mined in Bohemian mines. About 40 tonns of gold and 100 tonns of silver were sent to Empire and imperial troops, for first time in their history, used scorched earth tactic and destroyed all mines, burned all farms, stole all horses and cattles they can, plundered all villages, that supported rebels or did not joined their evacuation in to Empire. While this tactic was criticized by late historians and moralists, it led to weakening of Bohemia under King Vok I rule.\n\nRudolph led defense of Prague with about 2,000 regular troops and 4,000 militia troops of hastly recruited, poor-trained and bad equipped, but determined and loyal. They were able to defend Prague and Prague Castle for five months and during this time, they prevented nearly 20,000 rebels in joining their struggle against Frederick II of Hohenstaufen.\n\nRudolph died during man-to-man combat in halls and corridors of Prague Castle. His body was never found, but Emperor Romanos held mourning and public funeral for Rudolph and his troops. Dalmatia mourned for nearly month and thousands Dalmatian man promised vengeance on Vok and his rebels, but no one fulfilled their promises."
