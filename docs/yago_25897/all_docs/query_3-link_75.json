        "text": "1. Albert I of Germany ( 1255 - 1308 )\n\nWith an HPI of 66.21 , Albert I of Germany is the most famous Swiss Nobleman . His biography has been translated into 48 different languages on wikipedia.\n\nAlbert I of Habsburg (German: Albrecht I.) (July 1255 – 1 May 1308) was a Duke of Austria and Styria from 1282 and King of Germany from 1298 until his assassination. He was the eldest son of King Rudolf I of Germany and his first wife Gertrude of Hohenberg. Sometimes referred to as 'Albert the One-eyed' because of a battle injury that left him with a hollow eye socket and a permanent snarl.\n\n2 . Rudolf II, Count of Habsburg ( 1168 - 1232 )\n\nWith an HPI of 55.82 , Rudolf II, Count of Habsburg is the 2nd most famous Swiss Nobleman . His biography has been translated into 16 different languages.\n\nRudolph II (or Rudolph the Kind) (died 10 April 1232) was Count of Habsburg in the Aargau and a progenitor of the royal House of Habsburg. He was the only son of Count Albert III of Habsburg and Ita of Pfullendorf. He married Agnes of Staufen. Rudolph was the father of Count Albert IV of Habsburg and Count Rudolph III of Habsburg and the grandfather of King Rudolph I of Germany.\n\n3 . Françoise-Louise de Warens ( 1699 - 1762 )\n\nWith an HPI of 55.80 , Françoise-Louise de Warens is the 3rd most famous Swiss Nobleman . Her biography has been translated into 15 different languages.\n\nFrançoise-Louise de Warens, born Louise Éléonore de la Tour du Pil, also called Madame de Warens (31 March 1699 – 29 July 1762), was the benefactress and mistress of Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Warens was born in Vevey, into a Swiss Protestant family who had immigrated to Annecy, but became a Roman Catholic in 1726 in order to receive a church pension which had been instated to increase the spread of Roman Catholicism near Geneva, then a bastion of Protestantism. She was known to have led a liberal life for a woman of her time. She annulled her marriage to M. de Warens in 1726 after failing in a clothing business. Rousseau met her for the first time on Palm Sunday 1728. It was said that she was a spy and a converter for Savoy, then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. Though Warens was originally a teacher to Rousseau, they became sexually engaged after she openly initiated him in the matters of love and \"intimacy\". Françoise-Louise de Warens died in poverty in 1762 in Chambéry, of which Rousseau did not learn until six years afterwards. Rousseau describes his relationship with her in his Confessions."
