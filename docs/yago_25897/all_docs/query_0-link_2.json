        "text": "Habsburg King from 1273 to 1291\n\n\"Rudolf I\" and \"Rudolf of Habsburg\" redirect here. For other uses, see Rudolf I (disambiguation) and Rudolf of Habsburg (disambiguation).\n\nRudolf I (1 May 1218 – 15 July 1291) was the first King of Germany from the House of Habsburg. The first of the count-kings of Germany, he reigned from 1273 until his death in 1291.\n\nRudolf's election marked the end of the Great Interregnum which had begun after the death of the Hohenstaufen Emperor Frederick II in 1250. Originally a Swabian count, he was the first Habsburg to acquire the duchies of Austria and Styria in opposition to his mighty rival, the Přemyslid king Ottokar II of Bohemia, whom he defeated in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld. The territories remained under Habsburg rule for more than 600 years, forming the core of the Habsburg monarchy and the present-day country of Austria. Rudolf played a vital role in raising the comital House of Habsburg to the rank of Imperial princes.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nRudolf was born on 1 May 1218 at Limburgh Castle near Sasbach am Kaiserstuhl in the Breisgau region of present-day southwestern Germany. He was the son of Count Albert IV of Habsburg and Hedwig, daughter of Count Ulrich of Kyburg. Around 1232, he was given as a squire to his uncle, Rudolf I, Count of Laufenburg, to train in knightly pursuits.\n\nCount of Habsburg\n\n[edit]\n\nAt his father's death in 1239, Rudolf inherited from him large estates around the ancestral seat of Habsburg Castle in the Aargau region of present-day Switzerland as well as in Alsace. Thus, in 1240,[3] in order to quell the rising power of Rudolf and in an attempt to place the important \"Devil's Bridge\" (Teufelsbrücke) across the Schöllenenschlucht under his direct control, Emperor Frederick II granted Schwyz Reichsfreiheit in the Freibrief von Faenza.\n\nIn 1242, Hugh of Tuffenstein provoked Count Rudolf through contumelious expressions.[clarification needed] In turn, the Count of Habsburg had invaded his domains, yet failed to take his seat of power. As the day passed on,[clarification needed] Count Rudolf bribed the sentinels of the city and gained entry, killing Hugh in the process. Then in 1244, to help control Lake Lucerne and restrict the neighboring forest communities of Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden, Rudolf built near its shores Neuhabsburg Castle.[3] In 1245 Rudolf married Gertrude, daughter of Count Burkhard III of Hohenberg. He received as her dowry the castles of Oettingen, the valley of Weile, and other places in Alsace, and he became an important vassal in Swabia, the former Alemannic German stem duchy. That same year, Emperor Frederick II was excommunicated by Pope Innocent IV at the Council of Lyon. Rudolf sided against the Emperor, while the forest communities sided with Frederick. This gave them a pretext to attack and damage Neuhabsburg. Rudolf successfully defended it and drove them off. As a result, Rudolf, by siding with the Pope, gained more power and influence.[3]\n\nRudolf paid frequent visits to the court of his godfather, the Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick II, and his loyalty to Frederick and his son, King Conrad IV of Germany, was richly rewarded by grants of land. In 1254, he engaged with other nobles of the Staufen party against Bertold II, Bishop of Basle. When night fell, he penetrated the suburbs of Basle and burnt down the local nunnery, an act for which Pope Innocent IV excommunicated him and all parties involved.[citation needed] As a penance, he took up the cross and joined Ottokar II, King of Bohemia in the Prussian Crusade of 1254. Whilst there, he oversaw the founding of the city of Königsberg, which was named in memory of King Ottokar.\n\nRise to power\n\n[edit]\n\nThe disorder in Germany during the interregnum after the fall of the Hohenstaufen dynasty afforded an opportunity for Count Rudolf to increase his possessions. His wife was a Hohenberg heiress; and on the death of his childless maternal uncle Count Hartmann IV of Kyburg in 1264, Rudolf seized Hartmann's valuable estates. Successful feuds with the Bishops of Strasbourg and Basel further augmented his wealth and reputation, including rights over various tracts of land that he purchased from abbots and others.\n\nThese various sources of wealth and influence rendered Rudolf the most powerful prince and noble in southwestern Germany (where the tribal Duchy of Swabia had disintegrated, enabling its vassals to become completely independent). In the autumn of 1273, the prince-electors met to choose a king after Richard of Cornwall had died in England in April 1272. Rudolf's election in Frankfurt on 1 October 1273,[4] when he was 55 years old, was largely due to the efforts of his brother-in-law, the Hohenzollern burgrave Frederick III of Nuremberg. The support of Duke Albert II of Saxony and Elector Palatine Louis II had been purchased by betrothing them to two of Rudolf's daughters.\n\nAs a result, within the electoral college, King Ottokar II of Bohemia (1230–1278), himself a candidate for the throne and related to the late Hohenstaufen king Philip of Swabia (being the son of the eldest surviving daughter), was almost alone in opposing Rudolf. Other candidates were Prince Siegfried I of Anhalt and Margrave Frederick I of Meissen (1257–1323), a young grandson of the excommunicated Emperor Frederick II, who did not yet even have a principality of his own as his father was still alive. By the admission of Duke Henry XIII of Lower Bavaria instead of the King of Bohemia as the seventh Elector,[5] Rudolf gained all seven votes.\n\nKing of the Germans\n\n[edit]\n\nRudolf was crowned in Aachen Cathedral on 24 October 1273. To win the approbation of the Pope, Rudolf renounced all imperial rights in Rome, the papal territory, and Sicily, and promised to lead a new crusade by taking the crusader's vow in 1275.[6] Pope Gregory X, despite the protests of Ottokar II of Bohemia, not only recognised Rudolf himself, but persuaded King Alfonso X of Castile (another grandson of Philip of Swabia), who had been chosen German (anti-)king in 1257 as the successor to Count William II of Holland, to do the same. Thus, Rudolf surpassed the two heirs of the Hohenstaufen dynasty whom he had earlier served so loyally.\n\nIn November 1274, the Imperial Diet at Nuremberg decided that all Crown estates seized since the death of the Emperor Frederick II must be restored, and that King Ottokar II must answer to the Diet for not recognising the new king. Ottokar refused to appear or to restore the duchies of Austria, Styria and Carinthia together with the March of Carniola, which he had claimed through his first wife, a Babenberg heiress, and which he had seized while disputing them with another Babenberg heir, Margrave Hermann VI of Baden. Rudolf refused to accept Ottokar's succession to the Babenberg patrimony, declaring that the provinces reverted to the Imperial crown due to the lack of male-line heirs. King Ottokar was placed under the imperial ban; and in June 1276 war was declared against him.\n\nHaving persuaded Ottokar's former ally Duke Henry XIII of Lower Bavaria to switch sides, Rudolf compelled the Bohemian king to cede the four provinces to the control of the royal administration in November 1276. Rudolf then re-invested Ottokar with the Kingdom of Bohemia, betrothed one of his daughters to Ottokar's son Wenceslaus II, and made a triumphal entry into Vienna. Ottokar, however, raised questions about the execution of the treaty, and procured the support of several German princes, again including Henry XIII of Lower Bavaria. To meet this coalition, Rudolf formed an alliance with King Ladislaus IV of Hungary and gave additional privileges to the Viennese citizens. On 26 August 1278, the rival armies met at the Battle on the Marchfeld, where Ottokar was defeated and killed. The Margraviate of Moravia was subdued and its government entrusted to Rudolf's representatives, leaving Ottokar's widow Kunigunda of Slavonia in control of only the province surrounding Prague, while the young Wenceslaus II was again betrothed to Rudolf's youngest daughter Judith.\n\nRudolf's attention next turned to the possessions in Austria and the adjacent provinces, which were taken into the royal domain. He spent several years establishing his authority there but found some difficulty in establishing his family as successors to the rule of those provinces. At length, the hostility of the princes was overcome. In December 1282, at the Hoftag (imperial diet) in Augsburg, Rudolf invested his sons, Albert and Rudolf II, with the duchies of Austria and Styria and so laid the foundation of the House of Habsburg. Additionally, he made the twelve-year-old Rudolf Duke of Swabia, a merely titular dignity, as the duchy had been without an actual ruler since Conradin's execution.[citation needed] The 27-year-old Duke Albert, married since 1274 to a daughter of Count Meinhard II of Gorizia-Tyrol (1238–95), was capable enough to hold some sway in the new patrimony.\n\nIn 1286, King Rudolf fully invested Albert's father-in-law Count Meinhard with the Duchy of Carinthia, one of the conquered provinces taken from Ottokar.[7] The Princes of the Empire did not allow Rudolf to give everything that was recovered to the royal domain to his own sons, and his allies needed their rewards too. Turning to the west, in 1281 he compelled Count Philip I of Savoy to cede some territory to him, then forced the citizens of Bern to pay the tribute that they had been refusing. After his son Rudolf II defeated Bern at the Battle of Schosshalde, he strengthened his authority in Switzerland. He further expanded his Swiss possessions and granted some ecclesiastical posts to his family. In 1289 he marched against Count Philip's successor, Otto IV, compelling him to do homage.\n\nIn 1281, Rudolf's first wife died. On 5 February 1284, he married Isabella, daughter of Duke Hugh IV of Burgundy, the Empire's western neighbor in the Kingdom of France.\n\nRudolf was not very successful in restoring internal peace. Orders were indeed issued for the establishment of territorial peaces in Bavaria, Franconia and Swabia, and at the Synod of Würzburg in March 1287 for the whole Empire. But the king lacked the power, resources, and determination to enforce them, although in December 1289 he led an expedition into Thuringia, where he destroyed a number of robber castles. In 1291, he attempted to secure the election of his son Albert as German king. The electors refused, however, claiming inability to support two kings, but in reality, perhaps, wary of the increasing power of the House of Habsburg. Upon Rudolf's death they elected Count Adolf of Nassau.\n\nPersecution of the Jews\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1286, Rudolf I instituted a new persecution of the Jews, declaring them servi camerae (\"serfs of the treasury\"), which had the effect of negating their political freedoms. Along with many others, Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg left Germany with family and followers, but was captured in Lombardy and imprisoned in a fortress in Alsace. Tradition has it that a large ransom of 23,000 marks silver was raised for him (by the Rosh), but Rabbi Meir refused it, for fear of encouraging the imprisonment of other rabbis. He died in prison after seven years. Fourteen years after his death a ransom was paid for his body by Alexander ben Shlomo (Susskind) Wimpfen, who was subsequently laid to rest beside the Maharam.[8]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nRudolf died in Speyer on 15 July 1291 and was buried in Speyer Cathedral. Only one of his sons survived him: Albert I. Most of his daughters outlived him, apart from Catherine who had died in 1282 during childbirth and Hedwig who had died in 1285/6.\n\nRudolf's reign is most memorable for his establishment of the House of Habsburg as a powerful dynasty in the southeastern part of the realm. In the other territories, the centuries-long decline of Imperial authority since the days of the Investiture Controversy continued, and the princes were largely left to their own devices.\n\nIn the Divine Comedy, Dante finds Rudolf sitting outside the gates of purgatory with his contemporaries, characterizing him as \"he who neglected that which he ought to have done\".[9]\n\nFamily and children\n\n[edit]\n\nRudolf was married twice. First, in 1251, to Gertrude of Hohenberg and second, in 1284, to Isabelle of Burgundy. All children were from the first marriage.\n\nMatilda (c. 1253, Rheinfelden – 23 December 1304, Munich), married 1273 in Aachen to Duke Louis II of Bavaria and became mother of Duke Rudolf I of Bavaria and Emperor Louis IV\n\nAlbert I of Germany (July 1255 – 1 May 1308), Duke of Austria and also of Styria\n\nCatherine (1256 – 4 April 1282, Landshut), married 1279 in Vienna to Duke Otto III of Bavaria\n\nAgnes [Gertrude] (ca. 1257 – 11 October 1322, Wittenberg), married 1273 to Duke Albert II of Saxony and became the mother of Duke Rudolf I of Saxe-Wittenberg\n\nHedwig (c. 1259 – 26 January 1285/27 October 1286), married 1279 in Vienna to Margrave Otto VI of Brandenburg-Salzwedel and left no issue\n\nClementia (c. 1262 – after 7 February 1293), married 1281 in Vienna to Charles Martel of Anjou, the papal claimant to the throne of Hungary\n\nHartmann (1263, Rheinfelden – 21 December 1281), drowned in Rheinau\n\nRudolf II, Duke of Austria and Styria (1270 – 10 May 1290, Prague), titular Duke of Swabia, father of John the Parricide of Austria\n\nJudith (13 March 1271 – 18 June 1297, Prague), married 24 January 1285 to King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia and became the mother of King Wenceslaus III of Bohemia, Poland and Hungary\n\nSamson (before 19 Oct 1275 – died young)\n\nCharles (14 February 1276 – 16 August 1276)\n\nMale-line family tree\n\n[edit]\n\nHouse of Habsburg[n 1]\n\nOriginal line Albert\n\nCount of Habsburg\n\nc. 1188–1239 Rudolf I\n\nof Germany\n\nc. 1218–1291 Albert I\n\nof Germany\n\n1255–1308Hartmann\n\n1263–1281Rudolf II\n\nDuke of Austria\n\n1270–1290 Rudolf I\n\nof Bohemia\n\n1281–1307Frederick\n\nthe Fair\n\nc. 1289–1330Leopold I\n\nDuke of Austria\n\n1290–1326Albert II\n\nDuke of Austria\n\n1298–1358Henry\n\nthe Friendly\n\n1299–1327Otto\n\nDuke of Austria\n\n1301–1339John\n\nParricida\n\nc. 1290–1312/1313 Albertinian line Leopoldian line Rudolf IV\n\nDuke of Austria\n\n1339–1365Frederick III\n\n1347–1362Albert III\n\nDuke of Austria\n\n1349–1395Leopold III\n\nDuke of Austria\n\n1351–1386Frederick II\n\nDuke of Austria\n\n1327–1344Leopold II\n\nDuke of Austria\n\n1328–1344 Albert IV\n\nDuke of Austria\n\n1377–1404William\n\nDuke of Austria\n\nc. 1370–1406Leopold IV\n\nDuke of Austria\n\n1371–1411Ernest\n\nDuke of Austria\n\n1377–1424Frederick IV\n\nDuke of Austria\n\n1382–1439 Albert II\n\nof Germany\n\n1397–1439Frederick III\n\nHRE\n\n1415–1493Albert VI\n\nArchduke of Austria\n\n1418–1463Sigismund\n\nArchduke of Austria\n\n1427–1496 Ladislaus\n\nthe Posthumous\n\n1440–1457Maximilian I\n\nHRE\n\n1459–1519 Philip I\n\nof Castile\n\n1478–1506 Spanish / Iberian line Austrian / HRE line Charles V\n\nHRE\n\n1500–1558Ferdinand I\n\nHRE\n\n1503–1564 Philip II\n\nof Spain\n\n1527–1598Maximilian II\n\nHRE\n\n1527–1576Ferdinand II\n\nArchduke of Austria\n\n1529–1595Charles II\n\nArchduke of Austria\n\n1540–1590 Carlos\n\nPrince of Asturias\n\n1545–1568Philip III\n\nof Spain\n\n1578–1621Rudolf II\n\nHRE\n\n1552–1612Ernest\n\nof Austria\n\n1553–1595Matthias\n\nHRE\n\n1557–1619Maximilian III\n\nArchduke of Austria\n\n1558–1618Albert VII\n\nArchduke of Austria\n\n1559–1621Wenceslaus\n\nArchduke of Austria\n\n1561–1578Andrew\n\nMargrave of Burgau\n\n1558–1600Charles\n\nMargrave of Burgau\n\n1560–1618Ferdinand II\n\nHRE\n\n1578–1637Maximilian Ernest\n\nof Austria\n\n1583–1616Leopold V\n\nArchduke of Austria\n\n1586–1632Charles\n\nof Austria\n\n1590–1624 Philip IV\n\nof Spain\n\n1605–1665Charles\n\nof Austria\n\n1607–1632Ferdinand\n\nof Austria\n\n1609–1641John-Charles\n\nof Austria\n\n1605–1619Ferdinand III\n\nHRE\n\n1608–1657Leopold Wilhelm\n\nof Austria\n\n1614–1662Ferdinand Charles\n\nArchduke of Austria\n\n1628–1662Sigismund Francis\n\nArchduke of Austria\n\n1630–1665 Balthasar Charles\n\nPrince of Asturias\n\n1629–1646Charles II\n\nof Spain\n\n1661–1700Ferdinand IV\n\nKing of the Romans\n\n1633–1654Leopold I\n\nHRE\n\n1640–1705Charles Joseph\n\nof Austria\n\n1649–1664 Joseph I\n\nHRE\n\n1678–1711Charles VI\n\nHRE\n\n1685–1740\n\nNotes:\n\n^ \"Habsburg family tree\".
