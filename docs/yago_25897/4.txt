(1218–91). Rudolf I, also known as Rudolf of Hapsburg, was the first German king of the Hapsburg (or Habsburg) dynasty.

Rudolf was born on May 1, 1218, in Limburg-im-Breisgau (Germany). A son of a count, he inherited lands in Alsace, the Aargau, and Breisgau and later considerably extended his territory, in part through his first marriage (about 1245) to Gertrude of Zollern-Hohenberg-Haigerloch. In 1254 he assisted the Knights of the Teutonic Order by participating in a Crusade in Prussia.

Rudolf’s election as German king at Frankfurt was hastened by the desire of the electors to exclude an increasingly powerful rival candidate of non-German birth, Otakar II of Bohemia. Crowned king in 1273, Rudolf was recognized by Pope Gregory X only after promising to renounce imperial rights in Rome, the papal territories, and Italy. Rudolf twice defeated his rival Otakar II—in 1276 and 1278—and gained lands in Austria, which he granted to his sons.

Rudolf combated the expansionist policy of France on his western frontier by marrying (his first wife having died in 1281) Isabella, daughter of Hugh IV, duke of Burgundy, and by compelling Otto IV, count palatine of Franche-Comté, to pay homage (1289). French influence at the papal court, however, prevented Rudolf from being crowned Holy Roman emperor by the pope.

Although he created the territorial core of later Hapsburg power, Rudolf was unable to make the German throne a hereditary possession of his family, because the German electors would not raise his elder son to the kingship. Rudolf died in the German city of Speyer on July 15, 1291.
