Kiss Me Good-Bye

Artist: Angela Aki

***Final Fantasy XII***

You say my love is all you need

To see you through

But I know these words are not quite true

Here is the path you're looking for

An open door

Leading to worlds you long to explore

Go--if you must move on alone

I'm gonna make it on my own

Kiss me goodbye, love's memory

Follow your heart and find your destiny

Won't shed a tear for love's mortality

For you put the dream in my reality

As time goes by, I know you'll see this as me

I loved you enough to let you go free

Go--I will give you wings to fly

Cast all your fears into the sky

Kiss me goodbye, love's mystery

All of my life I'll hold you close to me

Won't shed a tear for love's mortality

For you put the dream in my reality

Kiss me goodbye, love's memory

You put the dream in my reality
