Lyrics from Animelyrics.com

You say my love is all you need

To see you through

But I know these words are not quite true

Here is the path you're lookin' for

An open door

Leading you to worlds you long to explore

Go if you must move on alone

I am gonna make it on my own

Kiss me good-bye

Loves memory

Follow your heart and find your destiny

Won't shed a tear

For loves mortality

For you put the dream in my reality

As time goes by I know you'll see this is me

I love you enough to let you go free

Go, I will give you wings to fly

Cast all your fear into the sky

Kiss me good-bye

Loves mystery

All of my life I'll you close to me

Won't shed a tear

For loves mortality

For you put the dream in my reality

Kiss my good-bye

Loves memory

You put the dream in my reality
