        "text": "I’m always on the lookout for YouTube channels that are useful for Japanese studies. I wanted to put together a quick post about a couple of channels I have found recently that I think are particularly good for Japanese learners.\n\nGreat for beginners: Nami Ohara\n\nNami Ohara is a Japanese teacher based in Newfoundland, Canada. I discovered her videos some time ago and strongly recommend them to Japanese beginners.\n\nI am a big fan of her videos which help introduce different aspects of Japanese culture and traditions. In these videos, two young children called Kyoko and Kenta ask their teacher (Ohara sensei) about the topic of the video.\n\nThe videos are all in Japanese but have furigana readings and English meanings for the vocabulary and phrases used in the videos. I think these are a great way to practice your Japanese listening and learn some new words at the same time. The speech of these videos is much more natural Japanese than what you might encounter in textbooks, so you get used to Japanese as it is actually spoken.\n\nIf you are studying towards the JLPT, then you might be interested in her JLPT listening practice videos. These are in the same format as the listening questions you will encounter in the final exam. She currently has listening practice videos for JLPT N5 up to and including N2.\n\nBesides the JLPT specific videos, there are a number of listening quiz videos aimed at beginners too. Each video is based on a different theme such as nationality and age.\n\nIf you want to learn some children’s songs, there’s plenty to be found on the channel too!\n\nClearly, a lot of effort goes into her videos, and I hope that by posting about her channel more Japanese students will discover her content.\n\nJapanese grammar explanations in simple Japanese: Sambon Juku\n\nSambon Juku is a YouTube channel mainly run by Akkie, a Japanese language teacher. I first learned about this channel through a video collaboration he did with YouTuber Kemushi-chan. After checking out his channel, I can highly recommend it to Japanese learners!\n\nAkkie has a number of videos covering various topics relating to Japanese study, in particular, explanations for different grammar points. Akkie’s videos are all in Japanese but he explains everything in a very clear manner and is very easy to understand. If you are an upper beginner and above, I think you will find the grammar videos particularly useful. Having said that, videos on this channel all have subtitles in both English and Japanese so all Japanese learners can understand the explanations whilst getting in some listening practice.\n\nFor example, the above video on the differences between は and が is wonderful and probably the best I have come across on this topic, summarising the key differences in usage with plenty of examples.\n\nThe channel also has a growing number of videos covering JLPT grammar points for levels N3, N2 and N1. If you like the channel Nihongo no Mori, then you will likely enjoy this series as well. I always like to look at different explanations of the same grammar point because sometimes the way one textbook or website describes things can be unclear, or not have enough example sentences to understand certain nuances.\n\nJLPT videos only have Japanese subtitles, but there are normally two sets (one with kanji and kana, one with kana only) which allows you to find the readings for any words you want to look up.\n\nIt just so happens that the two channels I’ve covered today have JLPT specific content, but I really think anyone studying Japanese can find some value in the videos!\n\nWhat are your favourite YouTube channels? Let me know in the comments!\n\nPrevious posts related to YouTube:\n\nTop YouTube channels for learning Japanese\n\n3 More YouTube channels for learning Japanese\n\nTo be honest, I had been putting off joining Instagram because I thought it was too hipster and filter heavy for me. However, I recently decided to join the platform on a whim, and have found it to be a great resource so far for learning Japanese.\n\nInstagram has over 800 million users, and from my experience so far, the language learning community on there is very active and friendly. In the short time I have been using the platform, I’ve have been able to learn about new language resources, novel recommendations and to renew my language learning motivation amongst other things. You can also change the language to Japanese if you want to immerse yourself a bit more!\n\nHow can language learners use Instagram?\n\nBeing a highly visual medium, I think that Instagram is particularly good for learning vocabulary. Using images alongside vocabulary is a great way to help memorise them, which is of course where Instagram shines. Instagram allows you to do short videos, which you can use to practice your speaking skills too.\n\nThe heavy use of hashtags on Instagram can be considered annoying, but you can use hashtags to find people and posts that relate to topics you care about. Moreover, the Instagram community is all about engagement – commenting is a great way to practice your language skills and maybe even make friends! There is also a translate feature if you get stuck understanding a post or comment.\n\nA word of warning though… Instagram is very centered on aesthetic and it is easy to waste time looking at the many pictures of cute stationery, cups of tea/coffee and grammar textbooks. Don’t let scrolling through Instagram become a replacement for other types of study!\n\nWith that said, here are 10 Instagram accounts that I highly recommend to those studying Japanese.\n\n1) j_aipon – Particularly helpful for Japanese newbies\n\nThis account is run by a Japanese girl who likes to post content for beginner Japanese learners. Her posts are mostly simple sentences covering key grammar points and vocabulary. Some of these posts have audio of example sentences too.\n\nAll of her posts have romaji, so if you have just finished learning hiragana and katakana, this is a good place to start (until you feel more comfortable reading kana – which can take more time than you think!).\n\nHer Youtube channel has some videos on learning kana, as well as simple Japanese listening practice too.\n\n2) You Know Japanese – Learn katakana words\n\nLoanwords can be surprisingly tricky for Japanese learners, but think that generally words in katakana are a quick and easy way to acquire vocabulary in Japanese. This account will help you get to grips with the many, many words written in katakana that are borrowed from English.\n\nIf you have just finished learning katakana, these posts are a good way to practice your reading (there is romaji if you get stuck too)!\n\n3) JapanesePod101 – Learn themed vocabulary and useful phrases\n\nJapanesePod101’s podcasts are a fun resource (although they come at a cost). You may not know that their Instagram page is full of cute images with useful and practical phrases for Japanese learners. I really like the posts where the vocabulary is centered around a specific theme, which is nice for short and sweet study sessions.\n\n4) NihongoLingo – learn Japanese slang!\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Bp8UvfHnSNQ/\n\nIf you want to brush up on your Japanese slang, then this is the account for you! Each post covers a slang word in Japanese with the English meaning.\n\nI like that each post has explanations of the word/phrase in both Japanese languages, along with examples and a fun image. This gives you a range of options on how to study, especially if you like to make your own flashcards.\n\n5) Daily Kanji – Daily kanji vocabulary\n\nAs the name suggests, posts from this account are all to do with kanji vocabulary, which all include furigana, romaji and English translations. The images that come with the vocabulary are all from anime, which is another plus if you are a fan!\n\n6) Yoko.illustrations888888 – casual phrases in Japanese and English\n\nYoko is a Japanese person living in Portland, Oregon in the US. Yoko illustrates casual but useful sentences in Japanese and English (with furigana and romaji too!). These sentences are written in a very natural way in both languages. I love the illustrations a lot too!\n\n7) Kisslingo – Great for JLPT and writing practice\n\nThe Kisslingo account covers useful Japanese words, phrases and grammar. If you are working towards the JLPT, I would look out for their JLPT question practice posts too.\n\nI particularly like their writing prompt posts where they share a picture and ask you to describe what is happening in the photo in Japanese. This is a great way to do some writing practice on days when you do not know what to write about, no matter what your language level. What’s more, someone from the Kisslingo team will correct your Japanese for you!\n\n8) Kannoooaya – daily Japanese phrases\n\nLike Yoko mentioned above, Aya posts illustrations of phrases in both Japanese and English pretty much every day. The posts are aimed at Japanese people learning English – but since she includes furigana, Japanese learners can also use them to study.\n\n9) Nihongo Flashcards – Japanese onomatopoeia\n\nI’ve written before about how important onomatopoeia is in Japanese. If you are looking to improve your knowledge of these words, this account is for you. Not only are the illustrations very cute but the explanations and example sentences are really useful in demonstrating how the onomatopoeia is used too!\n\n10) Everyday debudori – short comics on everyday life\n\nFor more advanced Japanese learners (no furigana used here), following this account allows you to read short comics based on everyday life. I find these little comics both relatable and funny, and the images help fill in the context of any words or phrases I am less sure of.\n\nSo that’s it for today’s post. Please follow the blog @kotobitesjp if you do use Instagram!\n\nDo you use Instagram for language learning? If so, how? Let me know in the comments 🙂\n\nI strongly believe that studying with sentences is an effective way to learn new vocabulary. If this is something you are interested in, I recommend checking out Clozemaster – a website and app that is built around this concept. It is designed to complement the use of other sentence based language learning apps like Duolingo.\n\nThere are a huge variety of language pairs available, with new ones being added all the time!\n\nThe “cloze” of Clozemaster relates to a cloze deletion test, where you are given a sentence with a missing word and you need to identify what the missing word is. Cloze tests are therefore a great method of learning to use words and grammar in context.\n\nHow does Clozemaster work?\n\nEach language has its own bank of sentences, the number of which does vary depending on the language pair. For many of the popular languages, you can follow the Fluency Fast Track, which is designed to cover the most frequently used words in that language.\n\nAs I mentioned above, Clozemaster is all about filling in the correct missing word from a sentence. These sentences then have the most common word within that sentence missing, which is what you have to fill in. You are given a sentence in Japanese, and the clue for the missing word will be in the English translation of the sentence below the Japanese. In the free version, clicking ‘PLAY’ above, will start a round of 10 sentences to review.\n\nYou have the option of multiple choice or text input before you start each round. If you are in text input mode and get stuck, just click on the “?” button to the right of the Japanese sentence to view the 4 multiple choice options. Writing the correct answer earns you points – the closer you are to mastering the word, the more points you earn. Text input gives you twice as much points compared to multiple choice, so this is what I choose unless I only have a very short time to practice.\n\nAt the end of each round, you get some quick stats on how you did:\n\nAs you can see from the image above, you can set yourself a daily points target and email reminders to get in your daily practice too. My daily goal is 200 points currently, but I normally aim for 500-1000 depending on how much time I have.\n\nStudying using the Play button is for learning new words (although some words that you have encountered before will appear too). For words that you have seen before, you will want to click on Review instead.\n\nThe Review function is based on spaced repetition intervals like those used in Anki and Memrise – the more often you answer correctly, the longer it will be before you see that same sentence again. Reviews tend to earn you a lot more points than studying new sentences.\n\nClozemaster also has a listening practice feature called Cloze Listening, as shown above. To access this, click Play and then choose “Listening” from the drop-down menu (the default is vocabulary). Cloze Listening is where you hear the sentence first, then have to fill in the missing word in the sentence. I think this makes for great listening practice as well as for learning vocabulary in context. Unfortunately, having a free account only allows you to do one round of 10 sentences to do every day.\n\nThe points you earn from your study sessions allow you to level up. Every time you do level up you get a fun little gif as a reward, which never fails to put a smile on my face! There are two types of levelling up – one for your whole account and one that relates specifically to each of the language pairs you study.\n\nEvery language pair has its own set of leaderboards, where you can try and score the most points for that week. I didn’t think that I would care about scoring highly on the leaderboard, but if there is someone I am close to in terms of points I tend to get motivated enough reviews to overtake them!\n\nThe Clozemaster App\n\nI tend to use the web version of Clozemaster, but there are apps available for iOS and Android. I have used the Android app and I do not have much to say about it. I mean that as a good thing – because I have not had any issues using it at all. The fairly plain style of the website translates well into an app, and having the app is really convenient for a quick study session. It is synced to your account, so it is easy to switch between the website and the app if you need to.\n\nMake sure you have some sort of Japanese keyboard installed though!\n\nAbout Clozemaster Pro\n\nClozemaster is another freemium site – it is free to sign up and practice any language. However, you need the Pro version to do things like:\n\nCustomise the number of reviews you want to do in each session and control how often you review new words.\n\nGet unlimited access to cloze listening practice\n\nDownload the Fluency Fast Track sentences or sentences you mark in your Favourites for offline study.\n\nView more stats related to your study sessions\n\nThe ability to click on any word and search for the meaning using Google Translate\n\nGet access to additional features such as Cloze-Reading, Cloze Collections and Pro Groupings.\n\nCloze-Reading is designed to help you boost your reading skills. This is where there are several missing words from a native piece of text in your target language which you then need to fill in.\n\nThe Cloze Collections function is in beta currently, but allows you to curate your own bank of sentences. This can be a mixture of sentences from within Clozemaster and sentences that you add yourself. I think this would be especially useful for language pairs that do not have a large number of sentences already on Clozemaster.\n\nPro Groupings allows you to break down the large bank of sentences into smaller ones. For Japanese, Pro Groupings gives you the ability to focus your learning on words from different levels of the JLPT.\n\nMy thoughts on Clozemaster so far\n\nAfter using the free version of Clozemaster for a couple of months, I have found it to have more pros than cons:\n\nPros\n\nA huge range of languages to choose from\n\nSentences use words in order of frequency, so you learn important words first\n\nAble to expose yourself to a range of sentence patterns\n\nCan practice both reading and listening skills\n\nReview intervals are spaced to help you retain vocabulary\n\nIf you’re competitive, the leaderboard will motivate you to get your score as high as possible\n\nCons\n\nJapanese sentences and English translations are taken from the Tatoeba database, which is known for not being 100% accurate.\n\nYou have to type most vocabulary in kanji (as opposed to hiragana), which might be difficult for complete newcomers to Japanese.\n\nNo audio for Japanese within the vocabulary review section yet (this does exist for the most common language pairs)\n\nI’m sure that the cloze deletion sentences can be replicated in something like Anki easily, which is what I would recommend to people who like a high degree of customisation. There are also excellent websites such as Delvin Language and Supernative which are specifically for Japanese and do have audio to go with their sentences.\n\nHowever, for me Clozemaster is great because of the gamification aspect, as well as the fact I can practice on the go via the app. I would also give Clozemaster a go if you are learning (or maintaining proficiency in) a number of languages, as it is super simple to switch between languages and track your progress in each.\n\nI really like Clozemaster, but I am not sure that for Japanese the features are fully fleshed out enough for me to justify the subscription cost of $8 per month at the moment. Having said that, there are new features being built into Clozemaster all of the time and I will certainly keep an eye out for any which might change my mind.\n\nThe good thing about Clozemaster is that you do not even have to sign up to try out the site – just choose a language pair and click Play to get started (which is what I did for a few days before even signing up)!\n\nWhether you find that Clozemaster is useful for you or not, one thing I recommend checking out is the Language Challenge of the Day (or LCOD for short). These little challenges are fun ways to use your target languages in different ways every day.\n\nDo you use Clozemaster? Do you find the website/ app useful? Please let me know in the comments!\n\nToday’s manga recommendation for Japanese learners is Tsuredure Children/ Tsuredure Chirudoren (徒然チルドレン), a manga series created by Toshiya Wakabayashi. This is a very funny but heartwarming manga which those who upper beginners and above should be able to enjoy!\n\nQuick Facts\n\nAuthor: Toshiya Wakabayashi (若林稔弥)\n\nGenre: Romantic comedy, slice of life\n\nNo. of volumes: 12\n\nRecommended for: JLPT N4\n\nFurigana: Yes\n\nAnime/ drama/ film adaptations?: Yes, an anime\n\nSource: ebookJapan website\n\nPlot Overview\n\nThis 4-panel manga is a series of short stories involving different students at a high school. The stories are usually to do with romance, mostly relating to awkward confessions of love and first dates. They often remind you of how hard it can be to show your feelings for someone as a teenager. Some stories follow the same characters and are loosely connected to each other.\n\nThis was originally a webcomic when it started in 2012, with the manga later being serialised in Shonen Jump magazine.\n\nWhy do I recommend the manga?\n\nThe premise is really simple, but the manga is genuinely amusing and accurately portrays all of the awkwardness and excitement of high school romance. The cast of characters come across as a bit wacky but ultimately charming and relatable for the most part. You really do come to root for a happy ending when reading these stories! I think that the 4-panel manga format is effective in telling these stories – they are just the right length for them to be entertaining and engaging.\n\nRecommended Japanese language level\n\nThe straightforward plot of the manga means that it is very easy to follow. There is furigana for all kanji and speech tends to be short and not too grammatically complex. The main difficulty with the manga would be that as it has a high school setting, the characters do talk in a casual way and use some slang.\n\nOn this basis, I consider this manga to be appropriate for JLPT N4 or upper beginner level and above.\n\nAs always, you can read a sample of this manga on the EbookJapan website to get a feel for its difficulty by clicking the white ‘無料立ち読み’ button.\n\nThe webcomic is actually available online to read for free on the official website – the only difference is that this version does not include furigana.\n\nThere is an anime adaptation of this manga which is available on Crunchyroll and Funimation.\n\nIf you do try reading any of the recommendations, please let me know how you get on the comments. I am always on the hunt for beginner friendly manga, so if you have any suggestions please let me know!\n\nIf you do like this recommendation, you might also like:\n\nManga Recommendation: Orange (also takes place in a high school setting)\n\nManga Recommendation: Oremonogatari!!\n\nHappy Reading!\n\nWhen I’m watching Japanese TV, I try to make use of Japanese subtitles instead of English subtitles as much as possible. But until recently, I had never given much thought to whether native-language or target language subtitles are better for language learners.\n\nThe following is a list of what I think are the main pros and cons for using native language and foreign language subtitles:\n\nNative language subtitles\n\nNo matter what your level, foreign language content is accessible, which is great for listening practice. This is good for themes requiring specialist knowledge and/or vocabulary.\n\nYou can begin to make associations between words in your target language and words in your native language. I find that this is most likely to happen with everyday vocabulary.\n\nTarget language subtitles\n\nHelps you to recognise common sentence patterns and vocabulary. For example, with Japanese, I found watching TV really helped me to understand more casual types of speech. Since we only studied polite language (ます/です) in class for quite a while before learning the plain form, this made things much easier when it was introduced.\n\nYou can focus on how certain situational phrases are used. This is especially good for phrases that don’t really translate to English, such as 失礼します (shitshurei shimasu) and お疲れ様でした (otsukaresama deshita) in Japanese.\n\nIt is much easier to recognise the words that you do not understand (and then look them up in the dictionary). Even in our native language, we often mishear things, and when we use native language subtitles it is easy to overlook words that we don’t know the meaning of.\n\nAs the above shows, both types of subtitles can have their own benefits. The choice between target and native language subtitles often depends on your language level and familiarity with the source material.\n\nOne way to make have the best of both words is to watch something without any subtitles, then again with target language subtitles, and then with native language subtitles. Fortunately, YouTube, Netflix and Viki make switching subtitles pretty easy.\n\nViki is especially good as dual language subtitles are available using the Learn Mode. This feature already exists for Korean and Chinese and is now in beta mode for Japanese.\n\nMy experiences with Learn Mode so far have been very positive and you get both benefits of native and foreign language subtitles.\n\nTransitioning to target-language subtitles\n\nAs you progress in your language learning, you will be able to benefit even more from target-language subtitles. Here are my tips on moving towards using them over native language subtitles:\n\nChoose something that you are really interested in, especially if you plan on watching it multiple times.\n\nTry to choose something that is not too complicated. I recommend starting off with shows that closely relate to everyday life – because choosing something on a niche topic unrelated to something you already have knowledge of will only succeed in leaving you demotivated. Cultural differences can exacerbate this problem too.\n\nDoing a bit of homework in your native language before watching anything helps a lot. This could be:\n\nReading the synopsis of a film in your native language\n\nReading the original book if you plan to watch a film adaptation (and vice versa).\n\nWatching the trailer before watching the film\n\nReading a (spoiler-free) review\n\nI might even write down names of key characters and locations. I find that doing this helps a great deal when you are actually watching a TV show. It means that you are not wasting precious time trying to remember the name of the main character’s sister!\n\nBreak shows down into smaller chunks. It’s much easier to watch TV series rather than films because TV episodes are shorter.\n\nWatching without native language subtitles requires a high level of concentration which is hard to sustain for a 90+ minute film.\n\nTV shows also have the advantage of being much easier to follow as you get used to how characters speak.\n\nIf you do choose a film, try watching it over a number of sessions to build your confidence.\n\nHave a notepad handy and make a note of words and phrases that you didn’t understand or find interesting. I then look these up at the end of my listening session and add to my vocabulary list to review later.\n\n…and if I get stuck?\n\nDon’t beat yourself up if there is a phrase you just don’t understand. It is highly likely as a learner that you will encounter:\n\nA slang word/ phrase\n\nAn idiom or saying\n\nA word pronounced in a strange way (or said in different accent)\n\nA pun\n\nWords that merge together when spoken quickly\n\nWhen you come across things like this, you could record a clip of what is being said and ask a friend or language partner to explain what is going on.\n\nIn some cases, I find that continuing to watch the show can help – later developments in the story might fill in gaps from what you missed earlier.\n\nIf you can turn on English subtitles, don’t be afraid to turn them on. Just because you do not understand something right now, doesn’t mean you will never understand it.\n\nObviously, the ideal situation is not to have any subtitles at all. Becoming too reliant on subtitles is unlikely to improve your listening or reading skills in your target language. One thing I try to do is to read native language subtitles as quickly as I can so that I can focus on the spoken language.\n\nSometimes you have to take the plunge and watch things without any subtitles – how much you do understand might just surprise you!\n\nWhat is your stance on this? Do you go for native language subtitles, target language subtitles or none at all? Let me know in the comments!\n\nWelcome to ‘Appy Mondays, my series of app reviews relating to Japanese language study. Today’s app review is of the JLPT listening practice app Ohayou.\n\nHow the Ohayou app works\n\nWhen you first log into the app, you have to create an account with an email and password or link the app to a social media account. I decided to go with the first option – whichever you choose, the app should automatically log you in whenever you access it after this.\n\nThe listening tests are grouped by JLPT level, and on the far right there are non-JLPT specific listening exercises too. Each JLPT level has a number of tests, which have to be downloaded before they can be accessed. Downloading is usually very quick.\n\nThere are various types of language questions, which correspond to the types of listening questions you will encounter in the JLPT:\n\nDepending on the level of the JLPT you are working towards, the types of listening questions you get in the exam will vary. Fortunately, the Ohayou app has you covered and has pretty much all of the listening question types you will need to practice for the test. The non-JLPT listening exercises include practice for hiragana and katakana, as well as counting and calculations in Japanese.\n\nOnce the test has been downloaded, you can jump into listening practice. Each test has 20 questions which follow the format of the JLPT test. That is to say, you will be given a question and four options from which you need to select the right answer. For lower levels of the JLPT the answers may be pictures, but they will be entirely in Japanese otherwise.\n\nClicking the ‘Check’ button after listening to the question will tell you if the answer you chose was correct or not (you will be shown the correct option if you do get it wrong). You can then choose to listen to the question again or continue on to the next one. You can also rewind or fast forward 10 or 20 seconds using the arrows, which is really helpful if you need to hear a particular sentence again.\n\nMy thoughts on Ohayou\n\nOhayou is a very convenient app for JLPT listening practice and is a great app to help build confidence for the listening section of the exam. For all of the listening exercises I tried, the audio was very clear too.\n\nThe listening comprehension tests are the same as those you find in the JLPT so anyone preparing to take the test (especially for the first time) will find this very useful for getting used to the type of listening tasks to expect. At all levels, there tend to be questions where more than one of the answers is mentioned and careful listening is required to ascertain which one is correct.\n\nThe non-JLPT exercises were a bit of a mixed bag for me. I thought that the hiragana and katakana tests were good and would most likely be useful for those who had just finished learning the scripts and want to test their listening skills. I tried the tests relating to counters, which I think are useful especially for reviewing common but irregular counters like ひとり and ここのつ, but the audio quality was not as good as the JLPT tests. It sounded as if the audio had been recorded from someone’s TV or perhaps had been recorded with the TV on in the background. Needless to say, this kind of distracting noise could just as easily happen in a real-life situation, but I found it a bit disappointing.\n\nI need to mention that whilst the app is free to use, additional features can be bought with for money, although these features can be ‘paid’ for using points you gain by using the app.\n\nYou can pay 400 points (US $2.99) to remove ads permanently, and 1000 points (US $4.99) to view all transcripts and access to one-click definitions of any word. For once, it is nice to come across a freemium app that does not require a monthly subscription!\n\nCompleting the tests for the first time earned me 2 points each, so at that rate earning enough points to unlock the premium features in full is probably near impossible without paying for them. There was also the option to earn 5 points by watching a video ad, but despite watching a couple of ads my points total never increased.\n\nIn the app’s defense, it is possible to purchase the transcript for individual questions or tests. So if there is a particular test that you are struggling with, you can spend 15 points to purchase the transcript. I would be wary about becoming overly reliant on transcripts for listening practice, as you will not have that benefit in the actual test. Generally, I found that if I got any answers wrong, listening to the question a couple more times made it clear where I went wrong.\n\nI can’t really see the value of paying the $2.99 to remove ads – I didn’t think that the ads were intrusive enough to justify it. Having access to all transcripts for $4.99 could be useful, especially if you are planning on taking all levels of the JLPT in turn (and so would be using the app quite a lot).\n\nIf you are interested in checking the app out, it is available in the Apple store and Google Play store.\n\nHave you tried this app out? Are you aware of a better alternative? Let me know in the comments!\n\nI’ve posted before about keeping a journal in your target language as a way of practicing your writing skills. However, I’ve always struggled to think of things to write about in my journal. This struggle was the inspiration behind the Writing Challenge I did last November.\n\nFortunately, there is another language learning challenge that helps solve this problem: the NVA challenge!\n\nNVA stands for Noun-Verb-Adjective: each day, the challenge provides you with one noun, one verb and one adjective to write a text with. The words are normally of a similar theme or complement each other in some way, which makes it easy to think of at least one sentence. In addition, the words used are words you would commonly use.\n\nI’ve been doing the challenge myself for a few weeks and have found it very useful for building a daily writing habit.\n\nI find that once I’ve actually written one sentence, it is much easier to then write a couple more sentences. Even on days when I am busy, I have been able to find the time to write down at least one sentence.\n\nIt’s become part of my daily routine to write just before I go to bed, which I find quite relaxing!\n\nI certainly recommend this writing challenge, as I think it is very accessible no matter what your language level is. The only thing I would say is that you might not find a word in your target language which corresponds directly to English, but that shouldn’t be your main focus. With Japanese, I don’t force myself to use the exact translation of the words given in the challenge if it doesn’t feel right to do so. Instead, I normally try to use a word which has a similar meaning. This also has the benefit of focusing your time on actually writing rather than looking up lots of lots of words in the dictionary.\n\nYou can always get your sentences corrected on language exchange apps/ websites such as Hello Talk, HiNative or Lang-8: Hello Talk and HiNative are best suited for sentences or short paragraphs and Lang-8 better for longer texts (sadly Lang-8 is not accepting new memberships).\n\nFind the NVA Challenge on Tumblr, Facebook, Instagram and Habitica. If you use Habitica there is a guild dedicated to the NVA challenge, where others in the community check each other’s sentences too.\n\nToday’s post was a short one but I just had to give a signal boost to this great challenge, with the hope that it might help some other language learners out!\n\nHow do you like to practice your writing skills? Let me know in the comments 🙂\n\nAs I did in the last Tadoku Tuesday post, I am going to write about two books I have read recently or am reading, as well as any new additions to my book collection. Both of the novels I focus on here happen to be by two famous contemporary Japanese authors, Banana Yoshimoto and Kotaro Isaka.\n\nThe Novel I’m Reading: 「アムリタ」 Amrita by Banana Yoshimoto\n\nIt’s a little bit difficult to give an overview of the plot for this novel, but I have tried my best!\n\nSakumi is dealing with two major events in her life; memory loss caused by an accident as well as the death of her younger sister Mayu. Prior to the accident Sakumi had been making ends meet with a part time job, but then realises that she wants to pursue a career in writing. Her little half-brother Yoshio then develops telepathic abilities. As her memories begin to resurface little by little, she begins to come to terms with the circumstances of her sister’s death and gains the courage to work towards what she truly desires in life.\n\nI’ve previously written about another of Yoshimoto’s novels before, which had not been translated into English. This time I thought I would try reading one of her more famous novels, which on the whole has been well received.\n\nI wouldn’t say that the plot is particularly enthralling, although there are some interesting characters which help keep the narrative engaging. There are lots of dream like passages, which give the novel a mystic feel and are vividly depicted. Despite this, Sakumi as a narrator feels very grounded and relatable, even though situation she finds herself in is not.\n\nThis is a fairly long novel that has been split into two parts. I have finished the first half of the book and enjoying it so far, but knowing that there is another 200+ pages to read I do wonder what developments are going to occur which will keep me interested.\n\nIf I had to estimate the book’s difficulty in terms of language I would probably put it at JLPT N2 level. Banana Yoshimoto’s writing style is on the whole quite straightforward, although at times there can be long rambling sentences that might take a bit of careful reading.\n\nThe Novel I Recently Finished: 「神様の制度」 Kamisama no Seido by Kotaro Isaka\n\nThis novel is actually a compilation of several short stories, which all involve the same narrator. Our narrator is only known as Chiba and works as a agent of death (a Grim Reaper of sorts). As an agent of death, his task is to spend time with the person he is assigned to, and decide within seven days if that person should die.\n\nThis is the first novel I have read by Kotaro Isaka, and I really enjoyed it. Like Amrita, this novel also looks at the themes of life and death. Having said that, the tone of this novel is completely different. Isaka has written stories spanning many genres, and elements of this come into play in the novel. He somehow manages to infuse the variety of short stories with suspense and comedic moments in a very satisfying way. As a death god, there are a lot of ‘fish out of water’ moments where he is trying to understand human feelings and motivations, which provided a lot of humour that I was not expecting. There is a wide variety of characters presented in the stories and through the narrator’s eyes, we get to learn a lot about the people he is assigned to. I found it very easy to get engrossed in each of the stories.\n\nIn terms of language level I’d probably recommend this for JLPT N3 level learners. I think this would make an ideal choice for someone looking to read their first novel in Japanese. I find Isaka’s writing style easy to follow; he tends to write in shorter sentences that still manage to convey a lot of information. Being a series of short stories, it is much easier to digest than attempting to read a longer novel in one go.\n\nThere is a sequel called 神様の浮力 “The Buoyancy of Death” which was released a few years ago. I would like to read this in the future, although the novel seems to have more mixed reviews from fans of the original.\n\nI will certainly be reading more of his works in the future, although with such a large catalogue to choose from I will struggle to decide what to read next!\n\nBooks added to my To Be Read pile:\n\nI am trying my hardest not to amass too many books (because then it gets even harder to decide what to read next!) and have only added one book to my collection recently:\n\n「舟を編む」 Fune wo Amu / The Great Passage by Shion Miura\n\nMitsuya Majime is an introverted man with a passion for reading. He takes the opportunity to transfer from the sales division to the dictionary department, where he is under the guidance of the highly regarded editor Kohei Araki. Araki’s team is undertaking the task of completing a dictionary called “The Great Passage”. The book follows the team’s pursuit of making the very best Japanese dictionary.\n\nThis has been on my wishlist for a long time, so I was super happy to finally buy this book! Given the subject matter, this could be a bit of a tough read in Japanese. Fortunately, I also purchased the ebook version of its English translation (“The Great Passage”) which I can use to help me with any tricky parts. I haven’t yet decided whether to try and read both versions in parallel or not.\n\nThere’s also an anime adaptation and a live action film, so I think starting with one of these two to give me a grounding in the plot and characters will make reading the novel a little bit easier.\n\nSo that’s it for today’s post – you can take a look at アムリタ and 神様の制度 on the Amazon JP website and read the first couple of pages if you are interested in checking them out.\n\nWhat are you reading at the moment (in Japanese or otherwise)? Do you have any recommendations for me? Let me know in the comments!\n\nSo you’re studying Japanese, but you don’t really know how to get into Japanese music. There is no doubt that songs are a great way to spice up your Japanese studies, but knowing where to start with Japanese music can be a bit of a minefield. Or perhaps you often go to karaoke, but never know what songs to pick that everyone is sure to know? Well look no further – here is a list of 15 Japanese songs to get you started!\n\nThe songs on this list have been chosen because they are popular songs which also have relatively clear lyrics for Japanese study. I’ve tried to include a mix of older and newer songs on the list, but it has been incredibly difficult to pick just 15. There really is a wealth of great songs from Japan (although it can be hard to see past the idol music sometimes!), so hopefully this list will be a helpful starting point into discovering all sorts of Japanese music.\n\n上を向いて歩こう by 坂本九 // Ue wo Muite Arukou by Kyu Sakamoto\n\nThis is the oldest song on the list but a definite classic. Known as “Sukiyaki” in English (I’m not sure why this is because it has no connection to the lyrics!), this is one of the best selling singles of all time. It is also one of the few foreign language songs to reach the top of the US Billboard Top 100 chart. The upbeat track belies the sadness of the lyrics, which tell the story of a man who looks up and whistles to stop tears from falling. The lyrics are simple and repetitive, which makes it a great choice to study with!\n\n2. 世界に一つだけの花 by SMAP // Sekai ni Hitotsu Dake no Hana by SMAP\n\nThe recently disbanded boy band SMAP were very much a national institution, having a career spanning almost three decades that expanded into acting and one of the most popular variety shows of all time, SMAPxSMAP. Their biggest song (The One and Only Flower in the World) was released in 2003 and was an instant hit, selling over a million copies. The song’s simple lyrics and pacing make it a karaoke favourite even today.\n\n3.手紙〜拝啓十五の君へ by アンジェラ・アキ // Tegami ~ Haikei juugo no kimi e by Angela Aki\n\nThis single by singer-songwriter Angela Aki was released in 2008. Originally featured in a NHK documentary, it became popular again after the March 11 tsunami disaster and is still heard at graduation time today. I think it perfectly encapsulates what a lot of us would write a letter to our 15 year old selves It’s a song with a great message and certainly one to listen to when you’re feeling a bit down.\n\nBy the way, 拝啓 (はいけい/ haikei) is how you traditionally start off a letter in Japanese.\n\n4. First Love by 宇多田ヒカル // Utada Hikaru – First Love\n\nUtada Hikaru is one is Japan’s most famous contemporary artists – it was tricky to pick a song from her many albums. First Love was Utada’s third single, taken from the album of the same name which went on to over seven million copies in Japan. That’s not bad considering she was just 16 years old at the time! This ballad has a mix of Japanese and English, but the Japanese is pretty simple.\n\n5. PONPONPON by きゃりーぱみゅぱみゅ // PONPONPON by Kyary Pamyu Pamyu\n\nKyary Pamyu Pamyu is the stage name of Kiriko Takemura. Takemura started as a blogger and model before entering the music industry and her 2011 single PONPONPON was the first of her singles to become a viral hit. The catchy beat is the invention of famed producer Yasutaka Nakata, who is also the creative force behind pop trio Perfume. The song and music video are the epitome of cute – together with the simple lyrics makes this a very easy song to get stuck in your head (you have been warned!).\n\n6. ありがとう by いきものがかり // Arigatou by Ikimonogakari\n\nIkimonogakari are a pop rock band that have been around since 1999, although they are currently on hiatus. The band’s name refers to the group of children assigned the task of looking after plants and animals in Japanese primary schools. Arigatou is a song they released in 2010 and is about treasuring a loved one. The lyrics are very sweet, and the tempo of the song makes it a good choice for singing at karaoke!\n\n7. ORION by 中島美嘉 // Orion by Mika Nakashima\n\nMika Nakashima is a singer and actress from Kagoshima prefecture who debuted in 2001. As an actress, she is probably most famous for her role in the live action adaptation of the shojo manga Nana. Her single Orion was released in 2008 and is one of her many popular singles. In this song, Mika sings wistfully about a past love – the lyrics here are slow and not too difficult which makes it a nice song for Japanese learners.\n\n8. リンダリンダ by ザ・ブルーハーツ // Linda Linda by The Blue Hearts\n\nThe Blue Hearts were a punk rock band popular in the 80s and 90s. Linda Linda is one of their most popular singles and remains a karaoke favourite. Originally released in 1987 the song was a key part of the film Linda Linda Linda (2005), where 4 high school girls form a band which cover several songs by The Blue Hearts.\n\n9. 恋に落ちたら by Crystal Kay // Koi ni Ochitara by Crystal Kay\n\nCrystal Kay is a singer hailing from Yokohama, who released her debut single at just 13 years of age. Koi ni Ochitara was her seventeenth single released in 2005 and was the theme song for a drama of the same name. This pop ballad is probably the least well known on the list, but it has simple but sweet lyrics perfect for karaoke!\n\n10. 涙そうそう by 夏川りみ // Nada Sou Sou by Rimi Natsukawa\n\nis an Okinawan phrase which means “large tears are falling” (in standard Japanese this would be 涙がポロポロこぼれ落ちる) and tells the story of someone looking through a photo album of someone who has died. The original song was performed by Ryoko Moriyama, but it is Rimi Natsukawa’s version released in 2001 that steadily became a hit song. It was so popular that broadcaster TBS made two dramas and a film between 2005 and 2006. The song is sad but beautiful and certainly a Japanese song worth knowing about.\n\n11. KARATE by BABYMETAL\n\nBabymetal have a unique blend of metal and idol style music (now known as “kawaii metal”) which has won the band fans from all over the world. Babymetal formed in 2010 and consists of three members: Suzuka, Moa and Yui. The group’s 2016 song Karate is from their second album Metal Resistance and is all about never giving up in difficult times. A lot of the main phrases are repeated and overall the lyrics are not too tricky, which would make it a crowd pleaser at karaoke for sure!\n\n12. Monster by 嵐// Monster by Arashi\n\nI don’t think it is possible to escape Arashi – the boyband has been dominating the charts for years now and each member is involved in TV hosting and drama acting. Released in 2010, Monster was the theme song for the drama adaptation of the manga Kaibutsu-kun which starred member Satoshi Ohno. The lyrics are straightforward- if you are in the mood for a Halloween pop song then this is for you.\n\n13. Best Friend by Kiroro\n\nKiroro are a duo who released their first single in 1998. Both members Chiharu and Ayano are from Okinawa, but the name of the band was actually inspired by words in the Ainu language after a school trip to Hokkaido. The song Best Friend was released in 2001, and was the theme song for a drama called Churasan. It is a popular song to sing at graduations, as the song relate to appreciating close friends.\n\n14. キセキ by Greeeen // Kiseki by Greeeen\n\nGreeen (the 4 e’s represent the four members of the group) are a pop-rock band originating from Fukushima prefecture. Kiseki was released in 2008 as the theme song for the baseball drama Rookies, and quickly became a bestseller. The title kiseki has the dual meaning of 奇跡 (meaning “miracle”) and 軌跡 (meaning “path, track”), which is why it is written in katakana rather than kanji! The lyrics aren’t too difficult and emphasise how important it is to treasure each moment and to keep moving forward.\n\n15. 恋するフォーチュンクッキー by AKB48 // Koi Suru Fortune Cookie by AKB48\n\n[Note: there are options to have Japanese or English subtitles on the video!]\n\nAKB48 are a massive girl group with several best-selling songs to their name. Named after the area where the group are based (Akihabara), the idol group is split into teams that hold performances there every day. Released in 2013, the message of Koi Suru Fortune Cookie is to try positive about the future, because you never know what will happen tomorrow. I am not the biggest AKB48 fan but you cannot deny that this song is incredibly catchy, upbeat and has a fun dance to learn too!\n\nIt’s always good to have a well known song in your arsenal when going to karaoke and hopefully this post has given you a few ideas (it was certainly fun writing this post). If in doubt, you can’t really go wrong with good old Disney songs in Japanese!\n\nWhat is your favourite Japanese song? Let me know in the comments!\n\nToday’s manga recommendation for Japanese learners is ‘Let’s Dance a Waltz’ / Warutsu no Ojikan (ワルツのお時間), a manga series created by Natsumi Ando.\n\nQuick Facts\n\nAuthor: Natsumi Ando (安藤なつみ)\n\nGenre: Romance, slice of life\n\nNo. of volumes: 3\n\nRecommended for: JLPT N4/ upper beginner\n\nFurigana: Yes\n\nAnime/ drama/ film adaptations?: No\n\nPlot Overview\n\nTango Minami is a high school student whose family run a ballroom dance studio. Having danced from a young age, he teaches at the studio to earn pocket money but keeps his connection to the dance studio a secret from his school friends. One day, a girl turns up looking for a trial lesson. The girl, Hime Makimura, is a shy student who is looking for a way to break out of her shell. Hime falls with love with dancing from the very first lesson, but Tango realises that they are both in the same class at school! Can Tango manage to keep his ballroom dancing a secret, whilst helping Hime to become a better dancer?\n\nWhy do I recommend the manga?\n\nFirst things first, this is in many ways a typical shojo manga – the female protagonist is a shy girl who learns to find confidence in herself, assisted by the charismatic and popular male lead. The plot develops pretty much exactly as you would expect from this genre of manga. Having said that, the ballroom dance aspect helps to keep the narrative feeling fresh.\n\nHime (meaning ‘princess’) really hates her name as she feels she could never be a princess in anyone’s eyes. Therefore it is heartwarming to see her find a natural talent and passion for ballroom dancing. Whilst this is a ballroom manga, the manga is more focused on the emotional impact dance has for Hime. Tango also grows as a person through his interactions with Hime, which helps him feel like a more rounded character by the end.\n\nAt just three volumes, this manga is a short but enjoyable read.\n\nRecommended Japanese language level\n\nI consider this manga to be appropriate for JLPT N4 or upper beginner level and above. You may be surprised to learn that the vocabulary used in this dance-themed manga is not too difficult. There are a few terms that are specific to dance, and these terms tend to feature a lot of English loanwords. As the main protagonists are high school students, there is a bit of slang used but if you are used to manga slang conventions, this should not pose too much of a problem.\n\nAs always, you can read a sample of this manga on the EbookJapan website to get a feel for its difficulty by clicking the blue ‘無料立ち読み’ button.\n\nIf you do try reading any of the recommendations, please let me know how you get on the comments. I am always on the hunt for beginner friendly manga, so if you have any suggestions please let me know!\n\nIf you do like this recommendation, you might also like:\n\nManga Recommendation: Orange (also takes place in a high school setting)\n\nManga Recommendation: Oremonogatari (also a lighthearted slice of life manga)\n\nHappy Reading!"
