        "text": "Chris O’Leary – The Hard Line (Alligator Records)\n\nChris O’Leary makes his debut for Alligator Records with 12 original tracks on The Hard Line. He’s not the new kid on the block though, having previously released 5 solo albums and he has been in the professional ranks since the mid-1990’s. Previously a Marine, Federal Police officer and member of Levon Helm’s band, The Barn Burners, he has many a tale to tell and he does that with this new album. First up is No Rest, a horn and harmonica laden opener with a strong vocal. This is a slick, soulful Blues with a slippy guitar and grungy harmonica both also provided by O’Leary. You can slip your backbone to this with a well-played harmonica, as it should be from a guy who made his recording debut in 2003 on Hubert Sumlin’s About Them Shoes. I did review that album so we have come full circle to a certain degree. This is a top opening song. It’s rapid pace for Lost My Mind and Chris’ harmonica to the fore again, confirming that he’s a player. Michael Bram’s drums are going like a train on this up-tempo Blues and I don’t know about lost my mind, I just lost myself in the song. A highlight. He slows it all down for the moody Blues of Ain’t That A Crime. He shows that he can mix it up as he turns in a slightly menacing vocal in places. The guitar solo is well played by Chris Vitarello, adding to the slow burning feel of the song. My Fault is a shuffling, mid paced Chicago Blues. He’s such an expressive vocalist and he’s a great addition to the Alligator Records stable of fine Blues players just now. He gets the notes out of that harp to produce another top song. I Cry At Night is a big production electric Blues with Hammond and piano from Jeremy Baum in the background giving the atmosphere as Monster Mike Welch’s guitar picks out some killer notes. O’Leary gives us a weary vocal, adding gravitas to the very personal subject. We have sax in there too from Andy Stahl and Ron Knittle, adding to the depth of the song. This is a classy one with Vitarello excelling with some face bending notes. You know what I mean about those, the ones where you stretch your face as you reach the top of the note. He ups the pace again for Things Ain’t Always What They Seem, an Ike & Tina Turner style R&B. He can certainly get you moving and he’s comfortable and secure here too. The band is very loose and everyone just knows where they are at.\n\nHe shows his full range on the soulful Blues of Lay These Burdens Down. He has a voice like melting chocolate on this one and it’s ably backed by a pinging guitar from Vitarello. Another slow burner, this is sultry all over and grown-up music to be reckoned with. Brooks Milgate provides lightning fingers on boogie woogie piano for the excellent Need For Speed. This is breakneck as the title suggests and I dare you not to move to it. O’Leary’s fuzzed harmonica joins the party and he shows again that he is a top-class player. The classy Blues of You Break It, You Bought It creeps up on you like a cat with tinkling piano from Milgate and a strong vocal from O’Leary. The harp is the star again but not content with that, he also throws in a pulsating bass. This is big time Blues from a big-time artist. Next up is Who Robs A Musician? The answer probably is, lots of club owners! Seriously, this atmospheric tale of a travelling musician shows a slight change in direction but he keeps up the high standard. Vitarello provides some jolting guitar. There’s a New Orleans vibe on Funky Little Club On Decatur, with horns (Darren Sterud adding his trombone to the sax of Stahl and Knittle) and Milgate’s piano taking it all the way. There’s plenty of percussion too from Bram and a hook filled bass line from Andy Huenerberg. O’Leary’s voice handles it all very well and there’s some excellent little slide guitar inclusions from Greg Gumpel. There’s a high-octane finish (just the way I like it) in the form of Love’s For Sale. It’s a rocking Blues that’ll steamroller your worries away and a great finish to a great album. Slide guitar again from Gumpel, O’Leary’s harmonica and Milgate’s piano, along with Dan Vitarello’s drums, shine through as they have done throughout.\n\nIt’ll be one of the albums of the year and you can bookmark that.\n\nChris O’Leary is in his prime on this album and maybe he’s just about to be a star in his own rite.\n\nwww.alligator.com\n\nwww.thechrisolearyband.net\n\nStatus Quo – Official Archive Series Vol 1 Live In Amsterdam (earMusic)\n\nVolume 1 of the Official Archive Series features a concert recorded at the Heineken Hall in Amsterdam on October 19th 2010 as part of their Pictures Exposed World Tour. For the Intro to this 2 CD set, we get a big, atmospheric fanfare, including hints of Pictures Of Matchstick Men before the band appears and launches straight into Caroline. This may not be up to their classic era versions but it is still a crowd pleaser. Rossi is understandably singing in a lower register but it doesn’t really have any impact on the song. One thing for sure is that he still has that connection with the crowd that he’s always had. Straight into Something ‘Bout You Baby I Like and Parfitt’s vocal helps to power through this very good version. Rossi seems to forget the words at some point, not for the first time, but professional as ever, he just carries on and then runs into Rain. This is classic Parfitt with the Quo oh oh oh oh chants of old. Next up is a good version of Don’t Drive My Car with Parfitt on vocal again and some good lead guitar from Rossi. They covered large parts of their career on this tour and they go way back for an early single, Mean Girl. There are more keys on this from Andrew Bown than there used to be but they bolster the sound well. It’s great that they were still doing this one and it sounds pretty fresh with Rossi ripping it up on the solo before it segways into Softer Ride from the Hello! Album. For me, the Piledriver, Quo, Hello and On The Level albums were peak Quo and this takes me back to my youth. Rossi’s vocal is not the same but that’s not surprising. Musically, however, they are very strong and this is a great version. Beginning Of The End is one of their later era songs and is the lead single for this album. They still know how to get a crowd going, keeping the high pace going throughout and their backing vocals are probably better than ever. There’s some audience participation on Hold You Back, with harmonic Celtic style guitar. This is a highlight. The Proposing Medley, at 10 minutes long, starts with What You’re Proposin’, runs into Down The Dustpipe, a real oldie, and then onto Little Lady, going through the albums now. The next one is Red Sky and it certainly plays its part on this driving medley. Rossi’s vocals are very pronounced as they move on to Dear John, a favourite of mine from that era, and finish off with a large part of Big Fat Mama with Parfitt in typical bombastic mood for a rocking finale to the medley. Things calm down, but only a little, for The Oriental, another favourite from their later stuff. Pounding and driving although Rossi is not so self-assured on guitar. It’s not the best version that I’ve heard. CD1 finishes with Creepin’ Up On You and this has what plenty of people will call the classic Status Quo sound. Harmonica even comes out as they rock it.\n\nCD2 opens with Living On An Island and I could never understand the popularity of this one. Still don’t. They go straight into a faithful rendition of In The Army Now, only lyrically changed slightly when Rossi slips in a swear word. Another where the rowdy crowd gets involved. Matt Letley is given the opportunity to step out from the shadows on Drum Solo, something you don’t get enough of these days. At 2 and a half minutes, it’s a baby compared to others in the past but it does showcase his skills. Next up is a perennial live favourite, Roll Over Lay Down. The start still sends a shiver up my spine and will always be on a Quo list of favourites. They don’t disappoint here. Some complex guitar strumming eventually leads us into the intro of their biggest hit, Down Down. They play the audience well on this rocking version of their only UK number 1. Whatever You Want is another live staple with that familiar atmospheric intro. There are so many parts of this concert that makes me think of how much Rick Parfitt is missed. This is probably my most played Quo track. From there to probably their most played song ever, in the form of Rockin’ All Over The World, and its still bringing in royalties for John Fogerty. They opened Live Aid with it and they’ll always be remembered for that, although it’s not one of my favourites. Talking of favourites, I grew up on Junior’s Wailing and this penultimate track is a storming version. They do know how to rock and this is Blues Rock encapsulated. They close with, as they often dod, Rock N Roll Music/Bye Bye Johnny and they rip it up, always! Chuck would be proud. John ‘Rhino’ Edwards’ bass can be heard pinging in the quieter section as Rossi works the crowd as well as he ever did.\n\nIf you want to experience the energy of a Quo performance then this is a good dropping off point.\n\nwww.statusquo.co.uk\n\nwww.ear-music.net\n\nConnor Selby – Connor Selby (Provogue)\n\nRaised in Essex and having lived in Connecticut and UAE in his formative years, Connor Selby hasn’t taken the usual path to musical awareness. Throughout his travels he formed a love affair with American Roots music and this comes through strongly in his music. This new release is a deluxe issue of his 2021 album with 4 new songs added as bonus tracks and it opens with the slow and soulful, I Can’t Let You Go. Organ, horns and guitar give it beef and Connor’s rich voice sets it off while his guitar just sings. Falling In Love Again is punchier and more upbeat. It’s a Soul Blues with a telling input from organ. The horns are to the fore again with a rhythm section and backing singers on form. The deep, rich vocal tones from Connor and guitar work are excellent as he shows a lovely feel for melody. The most bluesy track so far is If You’re Gonna Leave Me which has some neat Blues themes on guitar. Keys and horns are a bit part of his sound and drums are to the fore too with a piano solo that is sublime. His voice belies his years and I believe him to be still an under recognised guitar player, but surely that can’t last. He dirties it up a little on Emily with a deep, grungy guitar, producing a Blues Rock of a high standard. He still has that feeling for melody though and when he opens up on guitar, he just lights the place up. Highlight. The Blues based The Man I Ought To Be is slow and heartfelt. He comes across as being self-critical on this although the song itself is relaxing with pointed percussion and smooth keys. Hear My Prayer is acoustic led and leans towards Country. Its soaring chorus makes it another highlight. Make no mistake, Connor is a very good vocalist and he proves it again here as the backing singers add another level. His Les Paul Gold Top just cuts through the tale of unrequited love. The jaunty Show Me A Sign has horns to the fore as it takes us back to the heyday of Stax Soul/R&B. This is another with a big joyous chorus and it’s almost Gospel in its delivery. Connor’s piercing guitar cements his growing reputation.\n\nAnyhow is a slow, piano led Soul Blues that takes it to church and his voice suits it so well. We have an epic here as Connor bares his soul. The keys are on top form with the organ on top and there’s no need for a guitar solo here as it has everything else. His voice is relaxed and easy going on Waitin’ On The Day and you feel that he could sing you the phone book and make it sound good. We get smooth soulful vibes on a tale of enduring love with reverb guitar adding to the relaxation along with shuffled drums and smooth bass. The final track of the original album is, ironically, Starting Again, which starts with cymbals crashing like waves against the shore. It’s slow and deeply personal with keys and drums backed by acoustic guitar and bass this time. It builds well to allow Connor to let it all out on guitar and he doesn’t leave anything in the tank. It feels like a rebirth although it’s not one of the new tracks. I Shouldn’t Care is the first of the new ones and it’s a Blues of a high standard with the organ still playing a big part. Slow to mid-pace, it’s a tale of relationship problems and he is so smooth both vocally and instrumentally. There are lots of good guitar players out there but he can certainly hold his own. Love Letter To The Blues is the only bonus track that’s not a single. He keeps it on the Blues theme and stays in slow mode with this homage to the genre. Almost conversational, he’s telling you a story and you are compelled to listen. Piano and keys punctuate the song throughout with the piano the star, matching Connor’s guitar, whilst his velvet tones take you through. A cover of Ray Charles’ My Baby Don’t Dig Me is one of the few uptempo songs on the album but it does show some of his influences. Rolling guitar is a nod to Clapton and the fact that it’s on the edge of Blues and R&B show his love of Charles and Sam Cooke. The electric piano gets a rare outing and excels whilst Connor produces an excellent punchy solo on guitar. He closes with The Deep End and he’s obviously in a Blues mood on these bonus tracks. This is smouldering and smooth and the Hammond is wonderful, bringing the album to a close on a high note.\n\nConnor Selby may be an Essex boy but his musical heart lies in the roots of American Blues, R&B and Soul.\n\nwww.connorselby.com\n\nwww.mascotlabelgroup.com\n\nFabrizio Poggi – Basement Blues (Appaloosa)\n\nBelieve it or not, this is Fabrizio Poggi’s 25th album and he raids his basement files for some old gems and reworks a few others. He starts with an outtake from his 2015 album The Breath Of Freedom in the form of Tommy Dorsey’s Precious Lord. It’s a mournful opening with Fabrizio’s harmonica leading and Enrico Polverari’s acoustic guitar backing. Poggi’s vocal comes in halfway through with respectful tones and giving us a gentle introduction. He follows this with a 2014 live version of Willie Dixon’s Little Red Rooster, recorded somewhere in the USA with Guy Davis on vocals. His harmonica takes the normal the lead guitar part but Davis’ grizzled vocal makes it more like the Howlin’ Wolf original than the Stones’ version but there’s room for both. This is as good as any cover of the song that I’ve heard. Harmonica competes with the howls and wins out of the park. Acoustic guitar, also from Davis, is perfect. He keeps rolling them on out and next up is Midnight Train, a Poggi original and a studio rehearsal piece from 2010 Here we go for a train ride to remember as electric guitar (Poggi) and drums (Stefano Bertolotti) are introduced for the first time. The train picks up speed throughout and Poggi’s guitar skills are showing up well and, along with the drums, encourage the harp to pick it up. It’s hypnotic, it’s lung bursting at times and Fabrizio’s vocal just gets under your skin. A highlight. The often-covered traditional John The Revelator is so well known that it’s difficult to be different so, why change it? This outtake from 2008’s Mercy features the great Garth Hudson on organ and guitar. This is a slow, meandering, throbbing version with mandolin (Francesco Garolfi), harp, bass (Roberto Re) and percussion (Bertolotti) all drawn together. Hudson’s intricate keyboard work is a marvel and Poggi’s world weary vocal makes you believe what you’re being told. It’s back to acoustic guitar, this time from Ronnie Earl, for Your Light. An outtake from 2014’s Spaghetti Juke Joint, it shows how good a player Earl is as he and Poggi combine to produce a self-written Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee style acoustic Blues. Poggi’s screeching harmonica reaches the high notes to counterbalance his own sweet vocal. Gentle brilliance. Black Coffee is more of an in your face slow striding Blues with a gritty, demanding vocal from the depths of despair provided again by Guy Davis. Taken from the same live set in 2014, this has harmonica warbling in the fills as the guitar grinds out the base of the song. The solo is so full of ethereal soul and is so passionate. The pair work well together and it shows as they turn in a top-notch performance. Some of the notes that Fabrizio produces are so wrong, but so right.\n\nBlind Willie Johnson’s The Soul Of A Man highlights the surprises waiting for you at each corner as we return to Enrico Polverari for his acoustic guitar. It’s a straightforward vocal from Fabrizio asking the questions and his harp playing is wonderful. Although this is another outtake from the Breath Of Freedom album, it is an understated gem. Another Poggi original, Blues For Charlie has Polverari on electric guitar this time and it’s a full band with bass (Tino Cappalletti), drums (Stefano Resca) accordion (Bobby J Sacchi) and keys (Lorenzo Bovo) prominent. An outtake from 2012’s Harpway 61 it’s a slow, sweeping instrumental showcasing Poggi’s style and class through trills, warbles and all the tricks. Rosetta Tharpe’s Up Above My Head is another slow one with Ronnie Earl’s acoustic guitar returning. Another outtake from Spaghetti Juke Joint, it is a masterclass of technique as you might expect but most of this is to do with natural talent and Poggi has this aplenty with lots of hand warbles included. The self-penned Boogie For John Lee Hooker is an uptempo Boogie and at a pace that I love. Another outtake from Harpway 61 it has Resca’s drums pushing the band on with Poggi up and down that harp like a madman. Polverari and Cappalletti follow Recsa in keeping that Boogie rhythm going. This is a highlight as the harp just keeps on going. The last of the covers is Blind Lemon Jefferson’s See That My Grave Is Kept Clean. This outtake, from 2013’s Juba Dance, is a faithful version with just Guy Davis on vocals, guitar and banjo and warbling harp from Poggi. It all fits together so well with Davis’ baleful vocal standing out in a standout song. Another that stands out. He closes with two originals, the first of which is I’m On The Road Again. This first has him slightly stepping away from the Blues into an almost Country vibe. This is another outtake from The Breath Of Freedom as is completely different from the rest and a real surprise. Polverari’s acoustic guitar and Poggi’s harp are the two constants but this time they are joined by Stefano Spina on bass and keys. Fabrizio turns in a weary vocal and Polverari’s guitar is beautifully played. Pure and simple. He closes with Hole In Your Soul and we’re back to the Blues for the finale with Poggi back to his warbling, head shaking, tongue flicking and blocking best. The lyric says ‘if you don’t like the Blues, you have a hole in your soul’. I’ll go one further. If you don’t like Fabrizio Poggi, you’ve got a hole in your soul. The song itself is a slow, grinding Blues full of namechecks. Recorded live in Milan in 2015, this is a showcase of acoustic Blues guitar playing and harmonica excellence.\n\nI’m off to find these other 24 albums!\n\nwww.fabriziopoggi.com\n\nTom Ovans – The Cure (NSR Sound Recordings)\n\nThe Cure is veteran singer, songwriter and social observer Tom Ovans 15th album in a career that has spanned over 30 years. He is the epitome of the word troubadour having lived and worked in just about every state in the US. He opens this latest set of maverick ramblings with the title track and you will immediately work out why troubadour is so firmly associated with him. It’s just guitar and a cracked vocal telling the story that begins ‘The clouds are hanging heavy above The Paradise Motel’ and gives a sense of foreboding. It’s on the angry side of Folk Americana and when the harmonica comes in the whole thing comes across as quite Dylanesque. The voice, guitar and harmonica trio continues throughout the album with the odd mandolin, bass and percussion thrown in along the way, all played by Ovans and all recorded on analogue. The harmonica is in from the outset on Lazy Driver and his lazy, slurred vocal that is so associated with the rebel Folksters is given a nasal delivery to match the best. His slide guitar is well played and you know that you are always going to get a story. The laid back, Blues based Camile And The Dance Of Death is an epic highlight. He’s old style and harks back to the days of easy travel with a guitar and a harmonica. It’s a desert song with a voice full of gravel to suit. There is still that laid back delivery on Higher Ground, which owes much to the Folk and Alt Country artists that have gone before. Kristofferson comes to mind here and Neil Young also in his harmonica playing days. This is truthful, gritty music. He adds a slight shuffle to Fading Light, another that is Blues based, with a sleepy, world weary vocal and wailing harmonica. The Celtic tinged Like Some Old Irish Rover is another highlight. It’s like he’s reaching over and speaking to you. He draws you in with this protest song with an anthemic feel to the verse. He could easily fall foul of those who say that this genre is samey but on Gonna Miss You he mixes it up and keeps it interesting, bringing a certain motion to it. He brings a contemporary feel to songs that could easily fit into the Dylan oeuvre of the 60s and he’s endearing, even if he doesn’t want to. His harmonica plays a big part on the album, breaking up songs and drawing your attention, none more so than on Blame It On The Rain. He doesn’t really do fast ones although he changes his delivery from time to time; gritty sometime, nasal others. Some songs sound as if you’ve known them for years, this one especially. It’s comfort music to a certain degree with a gently swaying chorus.\n\nBallad Of A Bloody Nose has a bit of a chat at the start, all about getting out of the studio and doing one more take for the producer and one to aim for the youth market! Ovans doesn’t hold the fact that the writer is from the East against him, showing his self-deprecating humour again. This is as upbeat as he gets I think although it’s over 2 minutes before he actually starts singing the song. It’s another story told in his inimitable style and although he’s rushing to get out of the studio it doesn’t come across that way. Louise Ann has a shuffling Blues feel with a sleepy vocal and strong harmonica. There are echoes of Neil Young again with The Needle And The Damage Done coming through in places. Stranger In This Town starts off like an old cowboy camp fire song with an exaggerated vocal. He deploys his slide again which complements the painfully slow pace and the sad, lonely lyric. His songs seem simplistic but there are layers to them such as on Earth Quake. It’s just him, his guitar and harmonica but there’s a bass rumbling in the background, perhaps to help us visualise the earthquake and the climate change around us. He speeds it up a little for Jesus Wears A Six Gun and I wonder if here is the place to add some mandolin as he has done elsewhere. We get Western themes and Spiritual themes with a chanting, demanding and professing vocal. It’s all rhythmic and hypnotic. There are shades of Willie Nelson and Neil Young again on the sombre and stark There’s A Man before he draws you in again for Looking In Your Eyes. He’s an honest singer and there’s a sadness behind his music, which is, as I’ve said already, not often upbeat. Mercy Street is not the Peter Gabriel song, in case you were wondering. It’s slow and stark again with some electric guitar only for a second time to produce some engaging bleakness. He closes the 17-track ramble with My Ship’s A Coming, a title that sounds like it should be a Dylan song. He’s not changing his ways just because it’s the end. His ship is coming in and he’s out of here. He’s world weary as if he’s just had enough with his warbling harmonica, as always, is the counterpoint to his often cracked vocal and guitar.\n\nTom Ovans may not be everyone’s cup of tea but what he does, he does well and that’s all you can hope for.\n\nwww.tomovans.com\n\nDave Arcari – Devil May Care (Buzz Records)\n\nFor those of you who are unfamiliar with the work of Dave Arcari then pin back your lug holes! For his sixth solo album the Scottish Alt-Blues troubadour opens with the title track and on this we get some controlled aggression and a slightly softer version of Dave than you might be used to. We have rolling drums from Chris McMullan of the Northern Irish Punk/Blues duo The Bonnevilles alongside Dave’s trademark slide guitar. It is a song about two natural phenomena, The Whangie and The Devil’s Pulpit, close to where Dave lives in Scotland and the tales his father used to tell him about them. A good start. On the Celtic infused Blues of 1923, we have a tale of leaving home for a better life, a well-used theme in Scots Irish music. However, this is more than that as he sings about his Dad leaving home at the age of 15 in 1923 for adventure, including serving national service in the Italian horse cavalry. That said, you can hear the influence that this kind of music had on early Appalachians as it comes across on the Americana side. A softly sung tale, it’s just Dave, his guitar and reminiscences. Time Will Come is a sedate acoustic song which has a certain hypnotic effect. He is an honest musician, right down to using his own accent rather than some mid-Atlantic one. Is it a song about Brexit? A song about independence? Make your own mind up but it is certainly about the spin that both sides of the arguments put forward. He continues the gentle approach on Givers And Takers and remains acoustic. It becomes a bit conversationalist at times but I don’t mind that as it puts him firmly in the place of an old style Blues traveller with the delivery as he tells us about life’s users. A single from last year Loch Lomond (Home) has a return to electric guitar for this version of the famous traditional Scottish song. Making it his own he tells the tale of making his home there with locals adding the backing vocals for the chorus. Violin from Jamie Wilson is added to Dave’s slide making it quite ethereal in places. It’s not the rousing Runrig version but it does gain some momentum towards the end.\n\nStick To Your Guns is on more familiar Dave Arcari ground. Electric guitar getting a going over and added harmonica from old Radiotones band mate Jim Harcus is welcome. It’s still not full out mad man delivery though but it will give you an idea of what he can be like. I’d say that it’s a Scottish Delta Blues and although not mentioned, it’s a nod to his sponsors, Smokehead, who provide the whisky for Dave’s whisky driven Blues. Meet Me In The City is the current single and is one of two covers. The album is full of surprises and this Junior Kimbrough song is one. It’s not Blues yet it is. Again, this isn’t the rabble rousing Dave that we are all accustomed to but a reflective, introspective one yet a song, that has also been covered by the Black Keys, being made to sound like one of his own. Whisky is never far away from Dave’s music and on Whisky Trail he tips his hat to his previous sponsors, Glengoyne, who still use it on their Whisky Unscripted podcast. Played on the banjo, an instrument that doesn’t feature too often, this is mountain music, Scots style. Links between the Scots and the Appalachians are often through music and whisky. Guitar comes into it too as it comes across quite gently with Dave removing the grit from his voice completely. Looks Like You’re (Walkin’ On Water) actually feels like you are bobbing about like being on the water. There’s a little percussion, probably from his right boot, and it comes across a bit Spiritual but is, in fact, about Dave’s new found love of paddleboarding. His slide guitar is still of that high quality and this is one for a singalong in his live set with the crowd taking the roll of backing vocals. The second of the covers is Nine Pound Hammer, maybe best known for the Merle Travis version but in fact is a traditional song first recorded by the wonderfully named Al Hopkins and his Buckle Busters in 1927. It’s back to the acoustic guitar for this Country Blues and it’s another that is a spiritual work song in its feel. He closes with Walk The Walk and this gives us glimpses of Dave’s grittier side. It is moody, mean and menacing with stomping percussion and electric guitar. Dave is telling it how it is about people pontificating on things they have no knowledge of. It is deliberately slow as has most of the album but that doesn’t hide the fact that this one is John Lee Hooker for Scotland.\n\nI said at the start to pin back your lug holes and although this is a different, more refined Dave Arcari you’ll get little insights to what he is about. Get the album but get to see him in person as the two experiences are completely different.\n\nwww.thebuzzgroup.co.uk\n\nwww.davearcari.com\n\nRory Gallagher – Deuce: 50th Anniversary Edition (UMC)\n\n50 Years, where has the time gone! This sumptuous 4 CD, 55 track set celebrates Rory’s sophomore solo album from 1971 and digs deep into the archives as well as bringing us a new mix of the original album. Johnny Marr does the foreword of a 64-page hardback book which also comes as part of the package. The original album is remixed for the first of the four CD’s and opens with Used To Be which shows the flashing brilliance that he had promised from his days in Taste. Rattling drums and bass feature from Wilgar Campbell and Gerry McAvoy respectively. These two formed such an impressive rhythm section and gave Rory so much to work with. The package is replete with their sounds. Rory was as comfortable on acoustic as he was electric as he shows on I’m Not Awake Yet. He had a presence no matter what he was playing. This is a great Rock song, showing that he was a master of all guitars and he always had that little Celtic spark. He stays acoustic, 12 string this time, for Don’t Know Where I’m Going and adds harmonica. It’s just Rory on this bouncy, Blues based classic. Maybe I Will sees him return to electric and back to the Rock. It’s probably not the best track on the album but there is no mistaking his artistry on the guitar though. Whole Lot Of People is a stomping storming Rock that gave an indication of what his style was to become on the whole. Slide guitar deployed for the first time and he was an extremely good slide player. The first of his most recognisable songs is In Your Town, which was used frequently in his live performances. This is high octane Blues Rock and brilliant all around as his slide rings with Celtic influences throughout. Should’ve Learnt My Lesson is a straight up Chicago Blues with doleful vocal before he unleashes the power on There’s A Light. This is a master of his instrument just showing what he can do with it. There are Jazz overtones and some South American influences too. Bass and drums are excellent throughout but excel here. Carlos Santana would have been proud of this. It’s back to acoustic for Out Of My Mind and this beautiful song could easily have come out of the Appalachians. The final track of the original album is Crest Of A Wave, another that became one of his most well-known songs. This is Rory personified; strong vocal and soaring guitar. We have patches of light and shade and changes of tempo that keeps the listeners on their toes. Slide guitar par excellence and rolling, rambling brilliance.\n\nCD 2 is a 16-track collection of alternate, often rawer, takes of the original album tracks with different mixing levels and solos. You can also hear the process and what his mind must have been going through when finally selecting which take to use. Highlights are I’m Not Awake Yet Alternate Take 1 which is electric, Whole Lot Of People 6 String Alternate Take 1 and an epic 9 minute In Your Town Alternate Take 1.\n\nCD 3 takes much the same route with a fourth Alternate take of In Your Town leading the way with slashing slide guitar. Should’ve Learnt My Lesson Deuce Album Session Alternate Acoustic Take 1 is up there with the best of the tracks and the added mandolin gives it a different dimension. Should’ve Learnt My Lesson Deuce Album Outtake is an extra mournful, electric version of the song. 4 versions of the song all totally different in their playing style. We have three alternate takes of There’s A Light, the best being the guitar work on Alternate Take 2 and three versions of Out Of My Mind, each excellent in their own way. The third one has Rory saying We’ll have one more go and then we’ll go for a pint – inspiration! These are followed by two versions of Crest Of A Wave, the best being the second one and three home demos finish it off; Don’t Know Where I’m Going shows the differences of home recording now and then as he finger picks his 12 string and has more than one attempt. An acoustic version of Maybe I Will has his voice straining with the falsetto. Again, we get him trying out different ways to do the song, and a final, raw, version of Should’ve Learnt My Lesson acoustic played in a Delta Blues style.\n\nCD 4 is a series of live tracks. From Radio Bremen and BBC In Concert. This opens with 7 recorded for Radio Bremen in 1971 and starts with the now ubiquitous Should’ve Learnt My Lesson and showing all of his live passion on this grungy Blues. This is followed by a powerful version of Crest Of A Wave then steps away from the Deuce tracks with a dirty slow Blues I Could’ve Had Religion with added harmonica, a rousing version of the Blues based rocker For The Last Time and a storming version of Messin’ With The Kid (a live favourite) before going back to Deuce for Don’t Know Where I’m Going and finishing with another live favourite Pistol Slapper Blues. The final 6 tracks from a BBC In Concert session from the Paris Theatre and comprises, along with some wonderful commentary, an in full flow Used To Be, Should’ve Learnt My Lesson, Out Of My Mind where he gets the crowd going, I Could’ve Had Religion with a slide guitar masterclass, Crest Of A Wave and signing out in special fashion with a rip snorting version of Messin’ With The Kid.\n\nThis is a collector’s dream with some hidden gems.\n\nwww.umc-music.com\n\nStatus Quo – Riffs/Heavy Traffic/Quo’ing In (UMC/earMusic)\n\nThe first of two reissues, Riffs was originally released in 2003 and opens with their classic Caroline. What can be said that hasn’t already been said about this song? This is a clean version with added piano and not as grungy as the original on 1973’s Hello. It’s not all about Quo riffs and that’s where the album kind of fell as they became a covers band. There are very good covers and some less than good. I Fought The Law is one that is good but it’s not Bobby Fuller or The Clash. They give a Quo makeover for Born To Be Wild and this contains some of the most recognisable riffs around. They turn it into a rolling Boogie although it’s not changed out of recognition from the Steppenwolf original though. Bachman Turner Overdrive’s Takin’ Care Of Business is perfect for them and they turn in a very good version. Quo does Iggy on Wild One and they try their best to get the signature sneer. Another good one. Canned Heat’s On The Road Again is another made for the Quo and just as hypnotic as the original. Tobacco Road is as stomping as the original was from The Nashville Teens with Rossi giving it plenty on the riff. J. Geils Band’s Centrefold is a strange choice for them. It’s a competent version but it just doesn’t click. The Kinks’ All Day And All Of The Night is instantly recognisable and whilst this is a good version, it strangely has less of an impact than the original. Their version of ELO’s Don’t Bring Me Down just doesn’t work. This needs the ELO theatrics. Junior’s Wailing is one of their own and they are on safer ground here. This could easily be Rory Gallagher, it’s that good. Class. It’s a fans favourite and this version is as good as the original from 1970’s Ma Kelly’s Greasy Spoon. It’s Elvis next, Costello that is. Pump It Up is a great try but as soon as the vocal comes in then it’s lost. If you haven’t heard Costello’s original then you’ll think this is good. It’s another updated version of one of their classics in Down The Dustpipe. Originally from 1970 and only appearing on an album for the first time on the 1998 re-issue of Ma Kelly’s Greasy Spoon, they can’t go wrong with this well-loved song. Whatever You Want is one of their biggest and loses nothing on the original from the album of the same name in 1979 with that classic Rossi Parfitt interaction. The last track on the original album was Rockin’ All Over The World. They add more piano on this and again it’s one made for their style although it’s a John Fogerty song. It’s probably the one that most non-Quo fans will relate to, particularly after Live Aid.\n\nA second CD is included in this new package and this includes a further 16 tracks starting with You’ll Come Round, one of their lesser-known singles. It harks back a little to their period before the 12 bar Boogie. We get the B Side to with Lucinda and this is a romping rocker with Parfitt taking the lead vocal as he often did. There’s a remix of the Thinking Of You single, one from their Big Country influenced Celtic Rock period. As with these bonus CD’s you often get demos, unreleased versions etc and we have an alternate version of Caroline here. It’s live and the difference is the atmospheric keys at the beginning, with a little reference to Pictures Of Matchstick Men, before we’re off into the familiar song we all love with plenty of riffing. More live versions follow with Something ‘Bout You Baby I Like capturing them at their best as they swap lead vocals and Break The Rules, which is one of my favourites. The latter is energy personified and the extra piano adds to that barroom feel. Forty-Five Hundred Times is another originally from the Hello album. This is a great live version of one of their concert staples. Parfitt struggles a little on the vocal as the start but that is soon forgotten as they ramp it up. They follow it up with another of their big songs, Rain, and they don’t disappoint. Hold You Back is another of their lesser-known tracks but often a live inclusion on tour. It’s some more Celtic sounds but you’ll know it’s the Quo. Bands often use a medley to get more of their hits into a stage show and the Quo were no strangers to one. On Mystery Medley they throw in Mystery Song, Railroad, Most Of The Time, Wild Side Of Life, Rollin’ Home, Again And Again and Slow Train. You can tell when a band has so many good songs, even their medley’s go on for over 11 minutes. It’s 11 minutes of pure joy though. Another of the old ones is Gerdundula from 1971’s Dog Of Two Head. This is still a classic and not what lots of people think of as Status Quo. Beautifully played. Another of their live favourites is Roll Over Lay Down, the opening track to Hello. I’ve never heard it played anything other than brilliantly. Down Down was their number 1 single. Suitably frenetic on this live version as the audience goes wild as they always do. The hits keep on coming with live versions of Whatever You Want with the audience egging them on and Rockin’ All Over The World where they show how good they were at getting a crowd going. This extended package finishes with another of their medleys and they come out blasting on the Encore Medley with Rock N Roll Music before slipping into Carol and Bye Bye Johnny for a Chuck Berry trio to say goodnight. Will this satisfy dyed in the wool Quo fans? Maybe not but it does show a bit of their diversity whilst giving us some classics that we may not have heard for a while.\n\nThe second of the two reissues is Heavy Traffic, originally from 2002. It opens with the familiar sounds of the Quo on Blues & Rhythm and the enduring sound of Rossi and Parfitt is what they’ll be remembered for. The rocking and rolling All Stand Up (Never Say Never) has them in their element and the grinding The Oriental is one of their better later songs. There are more classic sounds on Creepin’ Up On You and whilst they were vilified by many for their 12-bar boogie they were more complex than lots of people thought. I’m sure that there are lots of bands out there that have been influenced by them. You’ll never mistake when you are listening to Status Quo and none more so than on the title track. Rossi’s voice is so distinctive. Solid Gold includes harmonica which was used more than you’d think in their songs. They were, and still are, a party band and one for getting folks up on their feet. Acoustic guitars used, and they weren’t often, for Green and it gives a West Coast USA feel. It’s not a typical Quo song and you wouldn’t know it was them. They are back on familiar ground with Jam Side Down, a melodic Boogie from an underrated album. Diggin’ Burt Bacharach grows on you and they’re not taking themselves too seriously, like they’ve ever done that. Do It Again is the rolling and tumbling Quo that were well loved and Another Day is a mid-paced grinding Boogie with harmonica again. They did this so well in their day. It’s straight up Rock N Roll for I Don’t Remember Anymore with Parfitt taking the vocal as he often did on this type of song. This is a highlight. There’s a move away from their trademark sound for Money Don’t Matter. This is a straightforward soft Rock song showing that they could do it when they wanted to. Rhythm Of Life is the last of the original album. A moody close to the set with stern riffs on guitar and another non-Quo like song.\n\nThe new set includes 2 bonus CD’s which start with The Madness, the B Side to Jam Side Down and a rocker. Another B Side, this time to All Stand Up, is You Let Me Down and they almost go into Folk Rock. It’s a different side to the band and a typical B Side. They could write in different styles but they hit on that formula which was so successful. There’s a few 2001 demos on offer such as Let’s Start Again, where Quo fans will recognise the untypical, jaunty style used, All Stand Up where you can hear the bones of the song that became one of the tracks of the album and Solid Gold with Rossi mucking about on the vocal. There’s a bit of overlap with Riffs with the same alternate versions of Caroline, Something ‘Bout You Baby, Forty-Five Hundred Times, Rain, Mystery Medley, Gerdundula, Roll Over Lay Down, Down Down, Whatever You Want, Rockin’ All Over The World and Encore Medley. Maybe a bit of overkill with duplicating these tracks. However, we do get live versions of The Wanderer, classic Dion and so perfect for them, Don’t Waste My Time which was one of their favourite live songs and for a long time too, All Stand Up (Never Say Never), well we’ve had the studio version, the demo so why not a live one – all great, Solid Gold which transfers well from the studio, the title track which is another that transfers over well and Creepin’ Up On You, another live version of the album track. I can see why they added these three to their set. The extras album finishes with live versions of two big songs, Big Fat Mama and Junior’s Wailing, staples of their live show for a good number of years. Like Riffs I’m not sure that the hardened Quo fan won’t already have these tracks in their collection.\n\nThe third of the recent offerings is Quo’ing In: The Best Of The Noughties, another 3 CD behemoth which opens with Backbone (Out Out Quo’in mix 2022). It’s lighter than the earlier stuff and not the Quo we know. Following on quickly is Looking Out For Caroline, from 2013’s Bula Quo, where they went for a more mainstream, striding Rock sound. Two Way Traffic is more like the Quo of old. From 2011’s Quid Pro Quo, it’s rapid and one of the best. There’s a re-envisioned version of their big hit, In The Army Now (Studio Version 2010), which still conjures powerful visions. They show their light-hearted side as they have a go at themselves on the rocking Beginning Of The End which is also taken from Bula Quo. Round And Round is quickfire and it’s Quo but it’s not! From Under The Influence which was on the cusp of the noughties. We’re more like the old Quo on Rock n Roll n You, a melodic Rock with a Boogie twist and another from Quid Pro Quo. Next up is Raining In My Heart. Ok, it’s a pleasant version of the Buddy Holly classic and it’s got Brian May on it but it is not the Quo. Back to familiar sounds for Liberty Lane, striding Rock with the accustomed hook. Jam Side Down is from Heavy Traffic and already mentioned further up. It’s another melodic Boogie and it does grow on you. The jarring Running Inside My Head, again from Bula Quo, doesn’t do anything for me at the start. It does get going but not the best. Electric Arena is Blues based with a stinging guitar and piano leading the way. From 2007’s In Search Of The Fourth Chord, this is surprising. Twenty Wild Horses is an up and down romp. Celtic based and again from Under the influence, this is a highlight. The familiar sounds of the Heavy Traffic opener, Blues & Rhythm follows before we get a throwback to their 70’s sound on the excellent Gotta Get Up And Go from 2005’s The Party Ain’t Over Yet. The Way It Goes is a fast-paced rocker and another from Under The Influence. They keep it simple and it's one to get the crowd going. Deep chants of Polynesian extract opens up Bula Bula Quo (Kua Li Lega). Another from Bula Quo, this is very upbeat, good fun and you wouldn’t know it was them.\n\nDisc 2 opens with Caroline (Studio Version 2022) on which we get a few different guitar licks but you can’t really add much to this classic. Another classic to get a makeover and one of the first songs to turn me on to Quo is Paper Plane (Studio Version 2022). The third one for this treatment is Rockin’ All Over The World (Studio Version 2022) and although there are some tweaks they sound much the same, albeit without Parfitt. Face The Music is bouncy, it’s ok and it’s got some good guitar work. Cut Me Some Slack (Out Out Quo’in Mix 2022) is a typical Quo Boogie and a good one at that. The title track from The Party Ain’t Over Yet comes with Folk Celtic overtones but the Quo sound is there and they recruit The Beach Boys for a version of their classic, Fun Fun Fun. It’s all good fun with the harmonies in there and it comes alive when The Beach Boys take over. You may remember their acoustic album from 2014 and the strings and acoustic guitars add so much to the classic Pictures Of Matchstick Men (Aquostic Studio Version). The acoustic led and upbeat grinder That’s A Fact actually comes from the 1976 Blue For You album and is a top track. I’m Not Ready is a vibrant chugger from a bonus disc of The Party Ain’t Over Yet and Tilting At The Mill, from 1996’s Don’t Stop has all the best Quo characteristics. Think Quo lite though. There’s a few bands that you recognise as soon as you hear them and Status Quo are one of those. Take I’m Watching Over You from The Party Ain’t Over Yet for example. It’s just that Quo sound from the outset leaving you in no doubt who is coming. This is a good one. Two more from the Don’t Stop album are the acoustic led sweeping Rock of Mortified and the Bob Seger style Rock of Temporary Friend. Their cover of Johnny Kidd & The Pirates’ I’ll Never Get Over You is up next and they can rarely be accused of being sickly sweet, but this comes close. However, it’s a great song and they do well with it. On Down Down (Aquostic Studio Version) the added accordion is a genius stroke and gives us a great version. The disc closes out with another version of their Mystery Medley, this time called Live Medley and they rock it out yet again and with It’s Christmas Time they give Christmas a Quo makeover. I’m sure they polarised plenty of people with this.\n\nThe final disc on this 3-piece set is a 10-track live collection recorded at Westonbirt and includes The Wanderer, Rain, Don’t Waste My Time, Don’t Dive My Car, Hold You Back, Creeping Up On You, Paper Plane, Living On An Island, Roll Over Lay Down and Rock N Roll Music/Bye Bye Johnny. It’s live, it’s the Quo, enough said.\n\nwww.statusquo.co.uk\n\nwww.umusic.co.uk\n\nwww.ear-music.net\n\nDelbert McClinton – Outdated Emotion (Hot Shot Records/Thirty Tigers)\n\nFour-time Grammy winner Delbert McClinton celebrates his musical heroes and influences with this, his 27th studio album. It’s not all about the oldies though as Delbert brings us five new songs, written or co-written by him. Named by Rolling Stone as the Godfather of Americana, he has a career that has spanned six decades and he has played with some of the best. When you can say that you have played in the backing band for the likes of Jimmy Reed, Muddy Waters and Bo Diddley then you know you have the chops. He stopped touring last year, the first time in 64 years he wasn’t travelling the country, playing his special style of music. However, that hasn’t stopped him recording and Outdated Emotion shows that he has lost none of his class. Things open with Lloyd Price’s classic, Stagger Lee and this is a great version of a great song. One of three singles it hits us with that New Orleans Swing and characteristic piano bass. This is a highlight of an opener with Delbert’s vocal showing no signs of age and a horn section with sax leading. Hank Williams made Settin’ The Woods On Fire a hit and Delbert says that Hank made him the songwriter that he is today. This is Texas Country and a complete change from the opener with female harmony vocal and steel guitar (Chris Scruggs) almost matched by fiddle (Stewart Duncan) and upright bass (Mark Winchester). Another highlight though. Jimmy Reed’s The Sun Is Shining is a slipping, sliding Blues and there’s no let-up in quality. Delbert’s harp gets its first outing and he says that hearing Reed’s Honest I Do was what made him take up Blues harp in the first place. He stands up to be counted here. One Scotch, One Bourbon, One Beer is known as being a John Lee Hooker classic but Delbert prefers the original Amos Milburn version and keeps it as a piano bar crooner. Released as a single, it’s good to be different but I prefer the way John Lee played it. Long Tall Sally is played at breakneck speed as you’d expect and although it doesn’t have the vocal impact of Little Richard, it’s a great version anyhow and you just can’t help but be happy. Two Step Too is a Delbert original even though he wrote it 20 years ago. It’s an old style two time done in a Hank Williams style and crossed with Delbert’s panache. Country fans will love it with fiddle and lap steel the stars. Almost mimicking the Ray Charles version of I Want A Little Girl, Delbert goes all lounge Jazz with piano and double bass as he swaps genres again. His slightly left of centre vocal suits all styles. Another Jimmy Reed classic comes around in the form of Ain’t That Lovin’ You, a harp led R&B. This is a classic version of the classic song and the last of the singles. Blow that harp, Delbert. Straight up good fun.\n\nThe often-covered Hank Williams standard Jambalaya should only be played in one way and Delbert does it. Fiddle and lap steel are heavily involved as he plays it old style. You don’t need to do much to this song to make it sing and this is a very good version as he maintains his vocal class. Good backing vocals too but the fiddle of Stewart Duncan just tops it all off. Connecticut Blues, written by Delbert in conjunction with Kevin and Yates McKendree is a smooth, polished piano Blues and he’s back to his old favourites on the Jimmy Reed performed, Calvin Carter written I Ain’t Got You with a percussive staccato delivery, a wailing harp and a rhythm section on top form. He can’t do it like Jimmy but then again, nobody can. I’d like to hear some of Delbert’s stories about Jimmy as I’m sure he's got plenty. Move It On Over is one of my favourite Hank Williams songs and he does it credit. This is another highlight with pinging guitar and lovely lap steel. It’s back to piano led Jazz for Hard Hearted Hannah, another from the Ray Charles songbook. Slick bass and shuffling drums are very good but top credit goes to the pianist. Co-written with Sharon Vaughn, Sweet Talkin’ Man is a trundling Boogie. He makes it sound so easy and brings us another highlight with piano and guitar going for top billing, drums driving it and a jagged guitar solo. Another that is co-written, this time with Gary Nicholson, is Money Honey and we’re back to the Bayou with fiddle and lap steel excelling yet again as Delbert goes through his paces to match them. No matter the genre, Delbert excels. This excellent album finishes off with the last of a trio of co-written tracks, Call Me A Cab. His co-writers this time are again the father and son duo of Kevin and Yates McKendree. Yates plays double bass plays behind Delbert’s spoken, almost beatnik, vocal of 36 seconds as he ends another night.\n\nHe’s over 80 now but Delbert McClinton can still show the young bucks how to do it.\n\nwww.delbert.com\n\nVarious Artists – We All Shine On: Celebrating The Music Of 1970 (Spyderpop)\n\n1970 is the year that I first started taking a real interest in music. Before then it was noise in the background at family parties that I didn’t really appreciate until later. Spyderpop’s compilation celebrates the start of the glorious decade of the 70s with a 22-track bundle of covers of what 1970 had to offer. It has some glaring omissions but I’m glad they have curtailed it at 22 tracks as this reviewer’s life is hard enough already. There are omissions but what is included more than covers the spirit of the year 1970. First up is Petsche and Raines’ version of Are You Ready. This is a rousing version of the original from one hit wonders, Pacific Gas & Electric. The gruff vocal, delivered preacher style sets it off well and it’s a good start to the album. Bill Lloyd takes on Randy Newman’s Mama Told Me Not To Come, made famous by Three Dog Night, and turns it into a jangly Rickenbacker triumph. The jarring guitar in the solo turns it into a highlight. Yellow River, originally a UK number 1 by Christie and still danced to by old ladies to this day, is covered by The Armoires. There’s a little lilt of viola in there and if you listen hard enough you’ll also hear the producer’s dog barking. It’s a decent version that you can’t help your spirits lifting to and it takes you back to more innocent times. Straightforward and there’s not really any need for anything else. Sunshine is a little-known track from The Archies and sparkle*jets UK give it some Glam Rock stirrings. It’s harmonic and pounding. I don’t know the original but it has such a catchy chorus. Current Brian Wilson band member Darian Sahanaja brings us his version of Mark Lindsay’s Arizona. This is slow and sultry and definitely of its time. It’s an orchestral, medallion man ballad and I could imagine Tom Jones and his ilk singing this back in the day. Originally a Soul classic from The Delfonics, Didn’t I (Blow Your Mind This Time) is turned on its head by Mitch Easter. He rocks it and fuzzes the vocal although you can still plainly hear the original melody, especially in the chorus. You might not recognise the next tune until the chorus but Danny Wilkerson’s version of Ray Stevens’ Everything Is Beautiful encapsulates the ethos of the early 70s as Flower Power hadn’t yet receded. Lannie Flowers (he’s one of my favourites this year) takes on the often-recorded Joe South classic Walk A Mile In My Shoes. Lannie gives this an expansive acoustic alt-country makeover and it’s a highlight. Irene Pena brings us the McCartney written Badfinger hit Come And Get It and it’s a change from the original. You’ll recognise it but it’s given jarring electric guitars and female vocals. Not to be dismissed though, it’s short and to the point. Riki Tiki Tavi, a lesser-known Donovan song about a mongoose, is given a subtle Reggae treatment by Richard Barone. His clear vocal delivers Donovan’s pointed lyric “The United Nations ain’t really that united” and that is as true today as it was in 1970. The Guess Who’s Share The Land is another that I wasn’t aware of before and Popdudes bring a rockier approach than those that have gone before. It’s still 70s Pop though and there’s that hippy ethos again with Michael Simmons giving it his best Paul McCartney vocal.\n\nOne of Neil Diamond’s biggest hits, Cracklin’ Rosie, is left in the hands of The Brothers Steve and they stay quite close to the original. It’s one of the more famous songs in the collection so it’s best not to muck about with it too much. This can’t be anything other than a highlight, the crowd pleaser that it is. The sounds of the 70s come through strong on the orchestral infused Tighter, Tighter from Pat Buchanan. A Tommy James song, this is another for the crooners. You’ll pick up on What Is Life immediately as the guitar riff is so familiar. The Legal Matters take up the challenge of this George Harrison classic and deliver another highlight with a very good version. Sweeping and soaring vocals are a pleasure and confirm that it’s not only the 70s that were a very harmonic decade. R Dean Taylor’s Indiana Wants Me is brought to us by Bobby Sutliff. Sirens open it and we should heed the sirens as this isn’t the best version of this classic from the American songbook and it is vocally not powerful enough for this power song. Another UK number 1, in fact the first new number 1 of the 1970’s, is Edison Lighthouse’s Love Grows Where My Rosemary Goes. The Test Pressings have the honour of bringing us this one and it’s a great version, hooking you in from the first guitar note. Reflections Of My Life is brought to us by Starbelly. Originally made famous by Marmalade, they do a good job but maybe not getting the full pathos of the original but well done on taking on what is actually quite a complex song. Very good guitar solo from Bryan Ewald has to be mentioned. I wasn’t aware of Melanie’s Lay Down (Candles In The Rain) before I heard this Marc Jonson version. Tambourine clashes, strong acoustic guitar and airy vocals make for a Phil Spector styled 1970 song if you’ve ever heard one. The Partridge Family’s debut song, and I believe the biggest selling US record of 1970, was I Think I Love You and Jonathan Pushkar is given the unenviable task of reproducing it. He needn’t have worried as this is a great pop version of a great pop song. Theatrical and expressive, it fits the bill. The Kinks’ Lola is one of my favourite songs so Diamond Hands are under a little pressure not to spoil it. It’s not the usual intro but as they get into it, it grows on you. To be fair, it is difficult with such an iconic song and they do produce a very good version despite not having the often-manic voices of Ray and Dave Davies. I’m not familiar with Fresh As A Daisy, an Emitt Rhodes song tackled by Chris Price, who incidentally produced Rhodes’ final record in 2016. It’s all pleasant with bouncy and perky keys and well sung. Pop personified for the early 70s. The massive set closes with Loose from The Used Electrics and they are going out with a bang. Crashing, scorching guitars hint that Glam and Punk Rock is a coming! They Rock it out to the end and they do ham it up a little vocally. It’s all good fun and I’m sure The Beastie Boys must have sampled the original Iggy and The Stooges at some point.\n\nIf, like me, you like a bit of nostalgia but also brought up to date then this could well be for you.\n\nwww.spyderpoprecords.com\n\nWalter Trout – Ride (Provogue Records)\n\nRide is Walter Trout’s 30th solo album and he promises to take us on a musical rollercoaster with it. It’s his first since 2020’s Ordinary Madness and draws on his darker days as well as the good times. He opens with the first of three singles, Ghosts, and it’s Blues Rock only the way that Walter can do it. Throbbing and driving, he grinds it out with his long-time rhythm section of Johnny Griparic (bass) and Michael Leasure (drums) beefing it up and Teddy ‘Zig Zag’ Andreadis just on the periphery on keys. Vocally, he sounds as good as ever and when he opens up on guitar he just blows you away – the ghosts don’t stand a chance. Sharp and incisive, he starts with a gem. The title track is another of the singles and we have harmonica blowing like a horn as the band go off at breakneck speed. This is very Allman sounding and another excellent song with Andreadis on piano. It’s a train song at the end of the day but one filled with superb guitar and it’s another highlight making it 2 for 2. There’s a change of pace and intensity for the ballad, Follow You Back Home. It’s standard stuff but done with Walter style. It’s heartfelt with a vocal full of pathos but the guitar separates it from other ballads. He's back on the Rock for So Many Sad Goodbyes and the band gets into a slow groove. Tales of loss and making the most of your time can be taken from it. Oh, and that deep growling guitar confirms he’s lost none of his passion. He’s such an expressive player. The harmonica is back for High Is Low, a more straightforward Blues. It’s grungy with a gritty vocal - ladies and gentlemen, this is Walter Trout! Slow and swaying, this is special and will excite you. Organ fills the sound but it’s all about that guitar. The last of the trio of singles is Waiting For The Dawn and this slow Blues has more of a classic Chicago nightclub sound. Walter picks out the notes and makes you listen to every single one of them, making it another favourite.\n\nI’m sure that we all welcome the sentiment of Better Days Ahead. Grinding, grungy Blues Rock is the order of the day as Walter spits out the vocal. It’s bass heavy and the drums pound with the sound of the organ just on the fringes. He goes a little Country/Southern Rock on The Fertile Soil which has good harmonies, as there are elsewhere on the album and stylish guitar. Nice piano, organ and acoustic guitar touches add flavour. I Worry Too Much is a swaggering Blues Rock with Walter strutting his stuff and another favourite. They are such a tight band and by tight I mean loose, if you know what I mean! Keys are higher in the mix this time. This is superb and surely he has got to be one of everyone’s favourite guitarists. He keeps it up with the rocker, Leave It All Behind and this will get the crowd going. He certainly puts some Roll into his Rock. I’ll say it again, a favourite! It’s a lighter approach with added horns, or keys sounding like horns at least, and a top rate piano solo. However, everything is blown away by Walter’s guitar. It’s back to the heavier style for the penultimate track, Hey Mama, on which he has a chat with his mother. It’s pleading and descriptive vocal has a human touch as he speaks to his mother through voice and guitar. I’d say that on the evidence of this album, his set list has grown considerably. The way that he builds into the solos is exceptional. The final track is Destiny and I wonder what destiny has in store for Walter. A ballad to finish with wouldn’t be my choice but if you’re going to do one then might as well make it a good one. This is all about how it was his destiny to meet his wife and how he’s been through it and she’s helped him come out the other side. Lovey sentiment in the song which is effectively a love song for her. I hope that he continues to stay strong. The vulnerability in his voice is shown on this type of song and he shows a good tone and reaches the higher notes well. He signs off with some signature guitar and although I’d have loved a rockier finish he has left me wanting more.\n\n30 albums in and Walter Trout is still standing tall. I’m already looking forward to number 31.\n\nwww.waltertrout.com\n\nwww.mascotlabelgroup.com\n\nDave Edwards – Many Rivers (Cadiz Music)\n\nDave ‘Spud’ Edwards isn’t a name that comes to mind when mentioning great British guitarists but the fact is that he’s one of the best Rock guitarists ever to have come out of London. Having played in bands with Rory Gallagher and Iron Maiden’s Dennis Stratton there is no doubting his pedigree. Many Rivers features songs culled from his archives over the past 40 years and two recent songs with members of The Cockney Rejects. We open with two songs from his early 80s band, British Isles and on Maybe This Time we are taken straight into a Phil Lynott bass line from Chris Glenn of SAHB and Michael Schenker Group fame. It’s a percussive start with Rod de’Ath of the Rory Gallagher Band and his fellow band mate Lou Martin on keys. Dave delivers a strong vocal and slicing guitar solos. It thunders on in the second half as Dave unleashes his full might. Enemies is the second of the British Isles songs and this is a pulsating rocker. Classic Rock with driving drums from de’Ath and Hammond from Martin to the fore. Never Want To Hear You Say Goodbye is a Rock power ballad in the Whitesnake mould. Dave’s tenor is well suited here and the obligatory sharp guitar breaks, well performed, show how good a player he is. Steve Goff’s bass high in the mix on this one. The title track is a version of the classic Jimmy Cliff song and he has that timbre to his voice that lends itself to this song. Cliff’s version sends shivers up my spine – this comes close. There’s a strong solo but you don’t need to do anything to this song and he plays it pretty straight. It’s a highlight, for the song alone and is from when he was playing in the Gerry McAvoy Band along with Ted McKenna (SAHB) on drums and Gerry McAvoy (Rory Gallagher Band) on bass. Party In The Back Seat Of My Car is a Rainbow style rocker. Storming guitar as the basis of strong, driving Rock; what’s not to like? Highlight. He can Rock, that’s for sure and he shows it on It’s Our Time. Straightforward, no nonsense with throbbing bass from Goff, driven on by Clive Brookes’ (Groundhogs) drums and Dave’s guitar producing a sliding solo. He keeps the rocking up and increases the pace for Dreaming. This is high octane stuff, not the best lyrically but a dramatic solo more than makes up for it. From his days in JoKev in 1995 we get the ballad, Forever. Piano and keys led; it allows Dave to show how good a voice he has. The expected guitar solo comes in late but what a heady solo.\n\nFeels Like Ice is another from the Whitesnake/Rainbow/Graham Bonnet stable. It’s funked up a little with synths but still a pretty straightforward 80s style British Rock. Featuring another powerful solo, this is another from his JoKev days. There’s an atmospheric, bluesy opening to Railway Station, which then turns into an 8-minute British Blues Rock epic with Dave on top form. I have nothing but praise for this. It’s well played, well sung, well written and one for the playlists for sure. John Mayall would be proud of this, a powerhouse, controlled performance on guitar from his 2015 band Three Piece Suite. He goes for it again on the full-on rocker, Love Won’t Fool Me Again. This is full of pace and passion and he shows how good he is again with a soaring solo and a vocal to match. Another highlight. There’s a touch of Punk at the start of Baby Says but it then goes into a more conventional rocker with a piercing vocal and driving solo. The acoustic led Can You See It is a Rock ballad and built for stadiums. Full of tempo changes and twists we get a dual guitar with Tom Dunn and taken from his 1981 band, National Grid. Birdsong greets us on Don’t Tell Me Lies before piano comes in from Carlo Villa. This is a very pastoral start and goes this way for a couple of minutes before additional keys and acoustic guitar join along with Dave’s soft vocal. It does build with bass and drums added from Steve Murray and Martin Johnson respectively. Overall, quite Folksy and ends again with birdsong. This is from when he was playing with Union Jack in 1996. The first of the two newer songs is The Old Man Of Canning Town which opens with grungy guitar and thumping drums from Jason Eviritt. This is heavy Rock and what Dave is best at. It’s an amalgamation of Classic British Heavy Metal bands with his shredding solo confirming his continuing credentials and calling themselves TNT with Vince Riordan and Micky Geggus of The Cockney Rejects on bass and guitar respectively. He closes with a rocker in the form of Davey’s Eyes and you can bang your head all the way to the end.\n\nThis doesn’t feel like a compilation as it flows so well and it is a great introduction to the music of one of the UK’s finest guitarists.\n\nwww.cadizmusic.co.uk\n\nJason Lee McKinney Band – One Last Thing (Bonfire Records)\n\nNashville based Jason Lee McKinney and his band bring us some Southern Gospel-tinged grooves on their new album, One Last Thing. The stained-glass window on the front cover should be a big clue to what is inside but it’s not a fire and brimstone kind of album by any manner of means and it’s the first venture by the band into this genre. They open with Jason leading on acoustic guitar for Cross Over. It’s Gospel as mentioned before and a song about passing on but when the band joins in with drums, horns, organ, handclaps, whoops and hollers then all you get is a sense of euphoria. There’s a funky guitar and rhythm section (Billy Wright and Logan Todd on bass and drums respectively) on Sing A Prayer. Jason’s pinpoint vocals are ably backed by Barry Strauser, who also contributes all keyboards, with a choral feel. The horns are in there again to give it great depth. Add in a sweeping, uplifting chorus and a gritty guitar solo from Sam Berce and you have a great song, no matter what the message is. Strauser brings a deep and eerie keyboard intro to Freedom which then bursts into life with strong vocal and grungy guitar. It's another choral background, this time with Biblical overtones and slide guitar. What we do have here is a band that is full of Soul. Strauser’s keyboards are excellent throughout and the change of pace towards the end adds that sense of intrigue. Unified is what I would call Churchy Soul Rock and you can’t ignore the spiritual direction of these songs whether you believe or not. Musically, they are very good, lyrically it’s up to you. The surging and swaying Promises is carried by Strauser and Berce on keyboards and guitar before we come to When I’m Gone with its horns and slide guitar giving a relaxing start before it grooves into action. It’s soulful and striding with a slower middle section which helps to give a base for them to push it out to the end, starting with a powerful guitar solo. The rhythm section is high up in the mix on this one. Jason hits a strong falsetto in parts of Paperback Novels and the pleasant sounds and punchy guitar will just wash over you. The Country Blues Rock of Sing On were chosen as the single and you can hear why. With a singalong choral chorus, the song has a powerful and spiritual feel with a preaching vocal and sharp, piercing guitar. The Hammond organ is unmistakeable and excellent, making this a highlight.\n\nDoubters Prayer is acoustic led and Steel guitar gives that Country feel. It builds well towards the chorus. I believe this to be more overtly Christian than the others but as I have said before, it doesn’t matter your beliefs as the music will come across anyway. A strong and aching vocal from Jason is the centre point. When you mention Gospel then scenes of US churches in euphoria will come to mind for many and in Liturgy you will get that feeling. It will be uplifting for many with its rocking piano and drums going like a runaway truck. It’s back to acoustic led for Lighthouse and you can take what you like from the lyrics; a God, a focus point whatever. People might get some comfort from the lyric here and elsewhere from this tale about a child and the advice that can be given. Another musical highlight is the funky Soul and contemporary Blues Rock of Make No Mistake. This is full of top guitar fills, grungy solos and backing vocals. This is probably the best vocal on the album. They stay in the Funk and Soul arena for Song Of Songs and Jason’s voice fits in well with those of his family. It’s got a slow, slinky groove and the guitar work is strong again. It’s Southern Rock for Voice For The Voiceless and this is another highlight with its striding, surging and soaring chorus and the choral section is top notch. Jason turns to his acoustic guitar and sings us Without End. On this he shows us what a good voice he has and the song is simple, effective and mesmerising. It’s a short acoustic break as we return to full electric for the title track, which is another funky offering and slinks about like an alley cat. The band follows a strong, grinding groove and the message gets through with the religious among us able to take plenty from it. They close with a radio edit of Sing On. It’s just shorter than the previous one but just as excellent.\n\nNo matter your persuasion, you are likely to be able to take something from this album.\n\nwww.jasonleemckinneyband.com\n\nMichael Tinholme – Singled Out (Independent)\n\nMichael Tinholme may not be a name that is familiar to you. However, his story will resonate with many and some of the musicians who have joined him in this latest venture will certainly be known to lots of you. Immersed in music from an early age Michael played his first professional gig at the age of 12. Things were not to go smoothly for the young Michael though and after leaving home at the age of 15 and spending 6 six years homeless, he put down roots and formed a band. He gained plenty of recognition and was courted by a number of top labels but his teenage experiences picked away at him and he gave up music for a number of years. Since returning in 2007 he has produced sporadic Jazz and easy listening releases with some big names assisting. Singled Out is the latest release and covers Jazz, the American Songbook, Christmas and all things crooner. He opens with one of the singles, and a tribute to David Bowie, Lady Stardust (A Songscape Tribute). He gives this a crooning makeover with Mike Garson (Bowie’s pianist) playing lovely piano. Brandon Fields plays an emotional sax solo and the backing singers lend a further depth. Tinholme has a good voice and has put his own slant on this although he doesn’t take on some of the higher range notes. The first of the American Songbook classics is Brother Can You Spare A Dime and his dulcet tones and percussive treatment give it a different dimension. The backing is mean and moody backing with piercing guitar against the soft vocal. The organ playing is strong and there is a complex guitar solo to contend with too. All in all, this is a good version of the song and different from what you’ll have heard before. Xsamba (The Full Story) is a jazzy samba with a full big band. This is where he goes into full Jazz crooner. It’s good for what it is but I’m not sure of its origins. The acoustic guitar is excellent with bass and drums driving the samba beat as the bass, guitar and trumpet exchange licks. The classic standard, Georgia is smooth and relaxing and Michael gives it the respect that it deserves with his silky voice. Another standard for the crooners is A Nightingale Sang In Berkeley Square but I do find him trying to be too much like Michael Bublé on this. That said, there is a market for him because people like good songs, well sung and that is what this is. The trumpet solo is very good, followed closely by piano and bass. The American Songbook is out again for The Party’s Over but I’ll say this, and it’s not a scathing criticism, the problem is with this kind of album is that it’s been done before and unless there’s a unique twist it’s likely to fall into the mire of all the others. He sings well, his song choices are good and the band is superb but there’s nothing that grabs you specifically on this one.\n\nWe get a couple of originals in the form of My Romance West Coast and My Romance East Coast. They swing and the trumpet sells them. It’s like Sleepless In Seattle and You’ve Got Mail in song format with this duo of songs with a contemporary feel. On Make Someone Happy he shows that he has a decent range and he takes on this classic well. The string arrangements have been very good and his vocal is sweet here. The album is completed with 4 seasonal songs, which were relevant when the album came out at the turn of the year, maybe not now as the review is being written. These types of songs can fall into a love or hate choice quite often and I’ll be brief on each. I’ll Be Home For Christmas is a schmaltzy Christmas tune, nothing else needs to be said, When Winter Falls On New York is another Winter/Christmas song which is not as good as the previous but does have a smoking sax, Happy Christmas War Is Over is not even spelled as per the original and is the wrong song to try and change but with a good female vocal and finally, Maybe Next Year, which is another for looking forward at the end of the year and strange to be listening to it now. It’s not the best but his wistful vocal and the hopes of what is to come carries a heartfelt, though very short message. The album kind of peters out for me but that’s mainly due to the time of year for reviewing rather than anything else.\n\nApart from the aforementioned Bowie pianist Mike Garson and Steely Dan sax player Brandon Fields, others who contribute to the album are guitarist Mike Miller (Bette Midler, Quincy Jones), drummer Gary Novak (Alanis Morrisette, Natalie Cole), Steve Lukather (Toto) on guitar, trumpeter Randy Brecker and producer Tom Fowler (Frank Zappa, Ray Charles). An all-star cast, I am sure you will agree.\n\nwww.michaeltinholme.com\n\nBananafish – Boston Bananafish (Treated And Released Records)\n\nThis double album features recordings only previously available at live performances of Boston’s Rock N Roll jam band, Bananafish. Released to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the band, the album uses all the best modern techniques to bring the songs back from the abyss and preserve them for modern and future listeners.\n\nSplit into two sections (Songs and Instrumentals), one for each album, the Songs album opens with the Country Rock of What’s Been Going On? but don’t let them fool you into a false sense of security as many changes will unfold throughout the album. As for this mid paced strummer of an opener it brings us a band who clearly liked to have humour in their music and one that liked to play and sing with freedom. Think of this as a cross between The Allman Brothers and The Barenaked Ladies. The frantic Red Car Coming follows with Frank Zappa influences and a Rockabilly/Garage ethos. It’s the drums that drives this but electric piano and guitar are welcome passengers. However, blink and it’s over. In another change of style, they find a slinky groove for Luck & Work which has Soul, Funk and Blues all represented. Fordham Murdy (now known as Reverend Freakchild) delivers an expressive vocal over pointed keys. Slide guitar also makes an appearance as the overall feel finally becomes that of late 60s Rock. They Funk it out from the start of Casey And Hayes but again the styles change within the song and they revert to the sounds of Grateful Dead, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Chicago, Doobie Brothers et al with the rolling piano giving it a Southern feel. Holding On is standard soft rock played at a slower pace. It’s not the best on offer although Murdy does let loose vocally in parts but a bit lazy in others. The guitar work from Matt Rae is good though and again the Allmans come to mind on that particularly. Dreamy psychedelic sounds herald Underneath The Porch with its spaced-out guitar and keys and drums to the fore.\n\nThey could be as laid back as they were frantic at times and Nobody’s Fault certainly falls into the former category. They certainly had a style of their own but there are many influences that contribute to this uniqueness. Piano and guitar lead but the rhythm section are a force to be reckoned with and the vocal, at times in the style of Talking Heads, often feels secondary. If there was ever a title for the pandemic then Keep On Keeping On has to be it. The track is sultry, funky soft rock with a very retro sound, even for the time that it was recorded over 20 years ago. This just keeps coming at you, metronomic and mesmerising. They throw in a live recording to let us hear how they sounded in that forum and the 8 minute long Talk Good About Me has bluesy guitar and piano and a suitably moaning vocal from Murdy. It’s atmospheric with a Jazz inflected and Doors influenced repeated riff. Murdy turns on the power vocal in places and the guitar is strong and drums are powerful as usual. There are more Talking Heads influences on Penumbra (Thank You – I’m Sorry). The bass player is very good and his rapid playing keeps up as the guitar and drums force the pace. There is a fun keyboard and guitar interlude which includes part of The Bonanza theme. For whatever reason, perhaps the strong bass and the humour, Ian Dury comes to mind. Belpre At Night is soulful and jazzy and is one destined for late night playlists. Bass is showing up well again and this has the best vocal so far as Murdy goes through the emotions. The extended bluesy guitar break is fine as they change tempo more than once before the piano takes over and calms things down again. The guitar then returns to speed it up again and inject those Blues Rock vibes towards the finish. They close the first album with a cover of The Beatles’ With A Little Help From My Friends. Guitar led and vocally amended with sweeps and sways, it gives enough of a change to make it different but not too much that you can’t recognise the original.\n\nThe instrumental album kicks off with Mrs Moriarty and sees a return to high impact energetic Jazz sounds. All elements of the band feature with piano leading frantic guitar, pinging bass and rapid drums. It’s got plenty of tempo changes but leaves the listener with a strange feeling. The bass is high in the mix as it spars first with the keys and then Rae’s guitar on Planet Garbonzo. It has a space age feel and fits firmly in the Jazz Rock arena. Neat and tidy guitar, which is a trademark of the band. Smoking Gaia is an extended Rock, Jazz inflected guitar led track with light and shade and subtle tempo shifts. The drums, as usual, keeps them on course as the bass pings and guitar and keys swapping lead roles. These are excellent musicians, excelling and producing a riff laden melange although the ragged percussion section is less good. Mauve opens with rapid guitar from Rae before everyone joins in on the fun. The Jazz feel that they get on so many of the tracks comes through again and had they continued in this vein then they could well have been up there with the top Jazz Rock protagonists of their era. Familiar themes run through on guitar as they have done elsewhere. In a further change they bring Celtic sounds with the keys reflecting a flute on Avereen. They like their changes of tempo and feel within the song. Celtic Jazz Rock with rolling guitar from Murdy and Rae and drums as the backbone. The influence of Frank Zappa returns on Crazy Karma, a short, bass driven and manic instrumental which introduces xylophone and the bluesy acoustic guitar is a surprise. Crazy indeed. This instrumental second album closes with the fast paced and high energy of Nobody. Freeform Jazz Rock with lots of highs and lows. You don’t know where they’ll take you next and there’s a surprise waiting around each corner. They share it out with each member performing key tasks high in the mix. You’ll get lost in this as it almost goes into another track at 4 minutes but they keep the same theme to stay on track. Mayhem.\n\nI feel as if I’ve been put through the wringer after listening to these songs but it is an experience that I’m willing to try again.\n\nwww.www-reverendfreakchild.org/bananafish\n\nNick Andrea – Blues @ Dark (Self Released)\n\nReleased as an 8-track vinyl and 13 track CD, this is Nick Andrea’s debut solo outing. Originally meant to be a Law & Chaos album with TJ Sullivan, circumstances dictated that Nick go out on his own with the tracks and then add a few for good measure. The smoky Jazz of Now All I Do Is Play The Blues opens proceedings. Nick’s plaintive vocal immediately hits you smack in the face with tinkling piano (Jeff Paris), stabbing guitar (Sullivan), lightly crashing cymbals, horns (Jim Scimonetti) and muted trumpet from Nick prominent. This is late-night, grown-up music and is the first of 3 original Law & Chaos singles on the album. The second of those singles and our Blues single of 2021 is Whiskey Whispers. I’ve said plenty about this song in the past and Nick has remained true to the Law & Chaos version as he has in the others that were meant for that album. It’s Blues inspired and strips Nick down to his soul as he tells the tale of the depths that he has reached in his life. TJ Sullivan’s guitar is still as sweet and Nick’s vocal and trumpet fully complement the song. Craig William’ echoed saxophones bring us Motherless Soul and herald a change in style. This is more up-tempo and funkier than I’ve heard before but it still has that Blues base and that strict sounding guitar from Sullivan. Nick shows a certain vulnerability in his vocal and he’s not what you would call a conventional singer. The last of the singles released under the Law & Chaos banner is Missus 2nd Place, a mid-paced shuffling trumpet and guitar Blues. Nick’s elongated Jazz vocal suits this well as he sings in the higher ranges. TJ rocks the guitar and it should be said that piano (this time from Craig T Fall) is a big component in this band. Nick takes on the Stevie Wonder classic, Superstition, with Truth Jones contributing vocals. On the whole, keyboards are replaced by Williams’ sax and Sullivan’s rocked up guitar (Fall’s Hammond B3 is there in the background) and it is slowed down from the original with slide guitar another unexpected addition. Nick grinds out the vocal to complete a very different version and that’s what will make it a favourite of the future. Truth Jones is simply wonderful. This is one of my favourite Stevie songs and Nick has shown it in a new light with this epic version which is out as a single. Back to Jazz for Skeletons In My Basement with upright bass & piano from Fall, sax and drums prominent. Nick’s smoky vocal is perfect for this style of song. Is there a clarinet or two in there? Yes there is and Scimonetti will please my daughter, the clarinet player of the family. Nick’s trumpet and TJ’s guitar swap licks as the track grooves on.\n\nThe acoustic slide Blues of Half-Of-A-Man is another of the current singles and Nick’s clear and sharp vocal fills this all too short jewel. He stays acoustic for Somebody Not You, the last of the tracks on the vinyl album. This is Blues based Jazz with Scimonetti’s clarinet in the background, although I may be mistaking this with his saxophones on this occasion and apologies if I have. Barrelhouse piano from Fall and Sullivan’s slide deployed once more. The song makes me think of Louis Prima in places. The first of the extra tracks for CD is Bittersweet Blues and Nick’s distinctive vocal is hard to ignore. He’s no mean trumpet player either. Shuffling drums, guitar and upright bass give this song a ‘feel’. We get the full horn experience on Something Bad Is Gonna Happen To You along with keys and rhythmic guitar as he funks it up. The rhythm section drives it on with some Latin grooves in there too. The Bill Is Coming Due is an acoustic Delta Blues with a twist. The guitar is well played, beside minimal percussion and authentic crackles in the background. This is a highlight. I’m not particularly a Jazz fan but after stumbling across a Chet Baker album a number of years ago I have to say that I became a fan of his. Nick has produced a stunning version of Baker’s I Fall In Love Too Easily with Jeff Paris’ piano playing soundboard to Nicks vocal and trumpet with the rhythm section are just in earshot. This is another favourite and Nick’s voice was made for this song. We get enough little vocal blemishes/wavering’s to make it original. I can see why he released it as a single. The album finishes with Last Time Blues, a Charlie McCoy song if I’m not mistaken. It’s an electric Blues with strong guitar and one of the slower songs that pepper the album. It’s a strong finish with a horn fuelled crescendo of a chorus.\n\nYou may take a little time to tune into Nick’s vocal but don’t just play the album once, or listen to a couple of tracks, as it will grow on you as will the art of listening to an album. The warm feel of vinyl is great but you have to get the full experience of the 13 tracks on the CD. Buy both!\n\nMartin Barre Band – Live At The Wildey (The Store For Music)\n\nThis extensive 29 track 2CD collection captures The Martin Barre Band performing the acclaimed 50 Years Of Jethro Tull show at the Wildey Theatre in Illinois in 2019.Joined by original Tull band members Clive Bunker on drums and Dee Palmer on keyboards they take us through the history of Jethro Tull. The albums contain many of the band’s biggest hits and some that will be only recognisable to big Jethro Tull fans. The added commentary as the band goes through the phases of Jethro Tull’s career is a good touch, albeit a bit spooky the first time you hear it. Going back to 1968 for the pounding opener, Song For Jeffrey, they produce a very good live version of the song, originally featured on The Rolling Stones’ Rock & Roll Circus. Barre’s guitar is mighty fine as is the acoustic section and they get the vocal phrasings down to a tee. 1968 was also the year for My Sunday Feeling, a striding Prog Rock flecked with Folk, Jazz and Blues which shows how good a guitarist Barre is. They plunder 1969’s Stand Up album for four tracks, the best of which are For A Thousand Mothers and To Cry You A Song, the former treating the diehards with very good flamboyant guitar and the complex latter featuring dual guitar from Barre and Dan Crisp and sounding so authentic. Highlights both. Aqualung was one of the first Jethro Tull songs that I heard and the album of the same name will be 51 years old next month! Three songs from that album in this first section are Cross Eyed Mary, a quirky Folk title but not a Folk song, Hymn 43 which is powerful in every way and the aforementioned title track with its descriptive lyric, grinding beat and superb guitar. An excerpt of Thick As A Brick comes in at 10 mins, boy could those Prog Rock guys write a long song! From the album of the same name and one much loved one by fans. This is originally from 1972 and was the album, some say, that pushed them worldwide. Full of epic Celtic influences and big guitars from Barre and Crisp.\n\nThere is an acoustic section to the first CD which will come as a surprise to most. The girls get their chance to shine and Alex Hart and Becca Langsford step forward to take on lead vocal duties. There’s a Blues vibe to Someday The Sun Won’t Shine, from the 1968 This Was album and it shows that Barre has a lovely way with his arrangements. A further four tracks are taken from Aqualung with the mesmeric guitar and vocalists making Cheap Day Return a beauty and the band goes full on Folk with mandolin from Barre on an acoustic Locomotive Breath as the best two. I do get a touch of It’s Raining Men in parts – just me? Probably! One White Duck, beautifully sung by Alex and Becca, is the sole track from 1975’s Minstrel In The Gallery and another entrenched in Folk showing the roots of Tull and what they, and The Martin Barre Band, could and can do with a song.\n\nThe second CD has less tracks but is not any less of treasure trove. Here we get three tracks from the 1974 album Warchild, the best being the pounding Sealion with its very good dual guitar work. The 1978 album Heavy Horses was seen to be by some a turning point for Jethro Tull and the title track continues that dual guitar sound which is becoming a feature. They take two tracks from Songs From The Wood (1977) and they become increasingly Celtic as evidenced by the excellent Hunting Girl. A further change, and perhaps one back to some of their 1968 music, comes in the shape of Steel Monkey and Jump Start from 1987’s Crest Of A Knave. Here they go in a heavier Rock direction rather than the Celtic Folk influenced material. The latter in particular is Blues influenced Rock with a Tull twist and sweeping guitar from Barre. It’s back to the 1969 and Stand Up for New Day Yesterday, a heavy Blues Rock which was covered brilliantly by Joe Bonamassa. This is a highlight. A full-on electric version this time of Locomotive Breath sees the girls back on backing vocals as they show how different two versions of the same song can be. The closing track, Dharma, is included as a bonus track. Part of Dharma For One from the This Was album in 1968, this expansive instrumental has them showing all the skills with guitar and drums having extended solos just like they used to do in the good old days.\n\nIf you are a Jethro Tull fan then this is one for you, unless you only listened for Ian Anderson’s vocal and flute and if you are new to Martin Barre or Jethro Tull then this will give you a great introduction to the flavour of what he is and they were.\n\nwww.thestoreformusic.com\n\nEric Gales – Crown (Provogue)\n\nAfter 30 years and 18 albums, Eric Gales is widely recognised as one of the finest Blues Rock guitarists around. The passion shown on each of his albums is testament to the man who has had personal struggles at times in his career. This is my first review of an Eric Gales album since 2010’s Relentless and I have to say that my excitement levels went up a notch when this new album landed on my desk. The first few words of Death Of Me are “My name is Eric Gales, any questions?” So, no mistaking his intent as he goes off on a grinding, melodic Blues Rock. It’s not the explosive start that you’d maybe expect but it does have a power chorus and a middle section that is theatrical and leads us into the solo. If there were any doubts about his stature then this will blow them away as he burns up the frets. The Storm starts out with just Eric on vocal before going off on a soulful groove with horns and organ. It’s a Soul Blues and a guitar that is good for your soul. If he’s not on your list of the best guitarists in the world then get him on there. This is a solo played from the heart. Sheer bliss. There are three short vignettes on the album, the first being the 30 second shuffle of Had To Dip. It’s just a precursor to the squaring off of two behemoths on I Want My Crown. Joe Bonamassa joins Eric on this juddering fast funky Blues Rock, picked out as an earlier single. Eric’s velvet vocal meets a festival of guitar. Horns, backing vocalists fill out the sound and this is a highlight. Who’s the best? Who knows! He slows the pace down for Stand Up and electric piano leads. After the previous track we need to take a breath. Eric’s soulful voice is all over this and a gentle, yet powerful, solo shows his class again. The organ fills where needed as do the backing singers with the piano getting a short solo too and leading us out of the song. It’s back to the grinding, pounding Blues Rock for Survivor. There are thumping drums and deep reverberating bass backing a powerful, melodic chorus and sublime guitar. There is a political message in there but it’s not in your face. They do feel like a power trio at times, especially in the solo, in the vein of Hendrix and Cream. You Don’t Know The Blues is played at walking pace and Eric tells it how it is. His guitar is full of life and lifts your mood even if you do know the Blues. He lists many of the things that can give you the Blues – we’ve all had at least one, haven’t we? Rattlin’ Change is the second of the short interludes, a minute of raucous jam with drums, organ and bass going at it behind the guitar.\n\nIt’s not all about the power with Eric and on Too Close To The Fire we have a gentler and more soulful Eric, albeit one who still litters the song with little riffs and runs. It’s the longest track on the album at just over 7 minutes and is an epic. His piercing solos cut through the relative calm and you might just start to think, are we in the presence of greatness? Yes we are! Put That Back is a funky grinder as the band gets into a groove with horns and backing singers playing a big part. Bass and drums lay down the backbone and I dare you not to move to this. Throw in Eric’s storming guitar and we have another highlight. LaDonna Gales features on Take Me Just As I Am and she shows that she is just as powerful a singer as Eric. This has an urban Isaac Hayes feel, a slinky groover with a bit of rapping from Eric. The last of the trio of vignettes is the 45 seconds of Cupcakin’. It’s another jam and takes us onto Let Me Start With This. Eric Hits the effects pedals for this one and brings us more of his grinding funky soul Blues. He gets some interesting sound from his guitar effects. The addition of accordion on I Found Her gives a Euro feel. Eric plays some slow acoustic guitar with some nice chords in there. Do I hear a mandolin? The vocal is heartfelt and his guitar solo adds to that Euro feel but also shows his skills on acoustic too. He comes at us with the big electric solo at the end, I wouldn’t expect anything else, before leaving us with just the accordion to finish. My Own Best Friend is a sultry, smoky and sedate Blues. Sedate, that is, compared to others but it gives the light and shade contrast in the album. It’s a Soul Blues and still has the solo but it is more restrained this time. The second break, over the organ, is superb and with a wonderful riff. Simply beautiful. The closing track, the aptly named I Gotta Go has Big Band vibes with energetic bursts and is the perfect way to end the album. It’s got Eric having a chat like at the end of a concert. Just like the old Blues artists a la BB King ending a show. He’s gotta go but he’s gotta come back quick as he is sounding as good as ever. He’s Eric Gales, any questions?\n\nNow, that is an album!\n\nwww.ericgales.com\n\nwww.mascotlabelgroup.com\n\nGirlschool – From London To Nashville (The Store For Music)\n\nThis 2 CD set comprises live performances from 1984 on both sides of the Atlantic, one in London and the other in Nashville. Girlschool were formed in 1978 during the new wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM) and went on to bring us Girl Power, long before The Spice Girls were even thought of. The first CD is a concert from the Camden Palace in London and opens with C’Mon Let’s Go which is like a challenge. Fans of Heavy Rock will be well aware of Girlschool and their approach and this energetic opener shows exactly what they were all about and that girls could rock too. The suitably raucous Nowhere To Run follows and proves that they could play, they weren’t just poster girls, and that they had everything a heavy rock band needed including the attitude. They were full on and not letting up on You Got Me. The vocals are top, guitars are great and the rhythm section is the foundation for it all but it’s not noise just for noise’s sake. The teasing and confronting Play Dirty has a piercing, stabbing solo before we are whipped off to Love Is A Lie with its A Kinks style guitar beat. They tell it like it is but it loses a little in the vocal in places. Another scorching solo though. Hit & Run proves that they were just a Rock band not a girls Rock band and that’s what they set out to achieve – recognition for that. They know how to set out a song and make sure that you hear it. Future Flash is like The Kinks on steroids as they venture into the Punk arena. We get a dual vocal attack on Rock Me, Shock Me but it’s not the best – too many shrieks for me. It’s bass heavy and robotic at times but the slashing guitar solo saves it. I suppose at times they felt they had to o"
