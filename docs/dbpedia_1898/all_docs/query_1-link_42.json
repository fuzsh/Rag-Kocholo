        "text": "What Your Ears Say & The Cover Looks LIke\n\nwhat We Say\n\nThe new Cole Pulice LP sounds more like the first care free day of summer rather than autumnal melancholy as ambient eccentricity holds hands with good natured jazz, playful New Age psychedelia and easy going electronica whilst they head to the Moon Glyph lake with some buds and a bag of beer.\n\nWhat The Release Notes Say\n\nCole Pulice is a composer, saxophonist and electroacoustic musician from Oakland-via-Minneapolis. Following their debut album \"Gloam\" and two duo collaborations with Lynn Avery and Nat Harvie, Cole Pulice returns with their sophomore album \"Scry\". The sound is deeply contemporary, incorporating saxophone/wind synth with live signal processing and modern electronics/software. It drifts between electroacoustic experimentalism and more traditional forms of song-like beauty, casting a wide sonic net that highlights Pulice’s versatility and creativity as both an improviser and composer.\n\nFrom Cole:\n\n\"Scry is a collection of musics exploring fragmentary or gradient states of liminality – recursive spirals of worlds hidden within worlds, dreams within dreams, sensations of time, and the notion of the past, present, and future all occupying a single point.\n\nIt’s a record that, for me, resonates strongly with this sort of “between-ness:” it began in Minneapolis, and was finished in Oakland, bridging pre-pandemic life with the “new normal” of current times; being genderqueer and navigating the spaces between and outside of the masculine and feminine binary; wandering through a musical interchange station that is interconnects improvisation, “song,” and collage experiments . . . multidimensional yet woven together by similar aesthetic threads.\n\nWhereas my previous record, Gloam, was mostly a series of compositions for a very specific electroacoustic setup, Scry utilizes a series of different hardware/software frameworks and apparatus. Or, to think of it in another way: Gloam was like looking through a kaleidoscope (each turn of the handle giving a different abstract perspective of the same bits of gemstone); Scry is more like a stained-glass crystal ball (a singular sculpture, with each fragment somehow offering an ephemeral glimpse into another world or dimension).\n\nScry is deeply indebted to the electroacoustic works of Pauline Oliveros, David Behrman, Marion Brown, Maggi Payne, Harold Budd, and Jon Hassell - all of whom explored, in their own ways, the interconnectivity between acoustic instruments, interactive electronic signal processing, and improvisation - the crux of ‘Scry’s DNA. To this end: virtually all of the signal processing on ‘Scry’ is done live as I play saxophone/wind synth, either through a hardware setup that I control with my feet as I play, or through software instruments I build which respond live to what I’m playing. Often, both software and hardware processes are being used simultaneously.\n\n\"To scry\" defines the practice of foretelling the future through gazing into a crystal ball or other reflective surfaces. There's a lot to say here regarding the mix of temporalities, timelines, states of being, and so forth, but I mostly just have to give a special thanks to glass artist, composer, and dear friend Sadie Robison. The arcane aesthetics of her technicolor stained glass sculptures were a major influence on the themes of Scry ?\"\n\n—Cole Pulice\n\nCREDITS\n\n​Recorded between 2019—2022 in:\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n\nSeward, Ventura Village, 8vB Studio\n\nOakland, California\n\nWest Oakland, Oakland Music Complex,\n\nPaul Dresher Ensemble Studios,\n\nReinhardt Redwoods Regional Park\n\nMixed by Lynn Avery & Cole Pulice\n\nMastered by Angel Marcloid at Angel Hair Studios\n\nArt & Design by Steve Rosborough\n\nIF YOU ARE TURNING ON TO THIS THEN YOU MIGHT LIKE TO EXPLORE THE MICRODOSED DELIGHTS OF THE SLOW PSYCHE PLAYLIST\n\nWhat Your Ears Say & The Cover Looks Like\n\nWhat We Say\n\nI worry the low frequency joys of the upright bass pass a lot of modern - especially pop music listeners by unless they're jazz curious. Perhaps a taste of this occasionally augmented, warm & wonderfully expressive solo LP by Meslien for Heavenly Sweetness will win a few hearts and minds to the double bass cause.\n\nWhat The Release Notes Say\n\nA festival organizer asks for a solo, and it is for Kham Meslien the trigger as much as the revelation. Twenty years of loyal service in a band, and Kham left the artistic direction of his career to the strings of his double bass. From now on, this one should take the less codified road of music where freedom reigns. That of jazz and its improvisations dictated by the moment, that of purely instrumental compositions. Written and honed on stage, Kham's compositions have benefited from an imposed lock down to be refined and immortalized in \"Fantômes...Futurs\", his first solo album.\n\nDouble bass player turned leader, Kham has placed his double bass, a fine mix of power and gravity, at the center of a virtual band in which he occupies all the positions. Percussions struck on the wood of his imposing instrument, discrete brooms or rhythmic double bass have handed over their spells to the printed circuits of a looper. Looped, cadenced, each one was then replayed on itself, the time of several measures. The time for Kham to install the deep tone and the warmth of strings that resonate on the wood to become storytellers. A music with images where the vibrations blacken the first lines, impulse melodies and themes, then leave the solos the freedom to speak to write the following.\n\nAn intense, instinctive, emotional speech.\n\nTo cross a melancholic storm before finding the immensity of a plain above which to glide. To follow the novel of an Andean charango playing oriental melodies, blurring both places and distances, mixing cultures to become one. Clinging to the suspense of the notes, following the sinuosities that lead to darkness as well as to light. Or go the other way around. To settle down near Anthony Joseph for the attentive listening of a poetry, only vocal title of the album.\n\nOn the voluminous body of an instrument in balance on its foot, the climates follow one another, the lively and velocity fingers fade in favor of the bow which will go to seek in the strings dramaturgy and buried feelings. \"Ta Confiance\", \"The Alarm\" or \"Le Saule Pleureur\", each title tells Kham's story as much as it gives the indication of the track to follow. Each one is then free to go where he wants, the paths being different as the listening goes on and especially as the moment passes.\n\nIf you're feeling Kham Meslien then you might dig the Slow Jazz Playlist - a showcase of the best new music from the independent artist, jazz underground.\n\nWhat Your Ears Say & The Cover Looks LIke\n\nWhat We Say\n\nPhantom piano sounds float about the late night introspection encouraging sound stage at will, as instrumental bubbles float to the surface before bursting at the limits of their physical limitations to become one with the gently swirling ambient surrounds in this fine midweek decompression soundtrack from Scattered Light for Dust Archive.\n\nWhat The Release Notes Say\n\nOn 31.12.2021 we found in the mailbox of our studio an eviction letter, for defaulting behavior, reporting the address of some place we never rented. Being the location just a couple of blocks from our studio, we immediately jumped on the car for on-the-spot investigation, to find a small white building we never noticed, even though we grew up in the neighborhood. Big windows covered from the inside with taped paper, a green metal door, firmly locked. As soon as one let the handle go, another slowly said: “I think we do have the key”. We ran to the studio to grab the key we found in a box, sent to us by someone unknown, exactly 2 years earlier.\n\nJump cut,\n\nand the key clicks into the lock.\n\nCellar smell, dust particles dancing in the light, there’s a table in the center of the room, on top of the table there are 4 cardboard boxes, on the top of each box, handwritten, with a black thick pencil: “A.D. 2022”.\n\nWhat follows is the content of the box\n\nDust Archive protocol code: D.A. #017 - A.D. 2022\n\n∙ [SP#085] to [SP#092] spools of tape\n\n∙ [IT#047] abstract print*\n\n∙ [IT#048] VHS tape**\n\n∙ [IT#049] cyanotype portrait; on the back, handwritten:\n\nScattered Light, Sydney, Australia, 1911***\n\n∙ [IT#050] sheet of paper, containing notes handwritten with a black\n\nballpen.

The persons were totally unaware of the existence of these boxes and its content, denying that the portrait was ever taken, and although we are informed the persons are all musicians, they can not confirm they ever performed the music recorded in the spools, although recognizing it as “extremely familiar”, “absurdly typical”, “as own”.\n\nFor completeness we had permission to disclose the identity of the subject to get a fully tackable thread on the facts surrounding Dust Archive:\n\nwww.instagram.com/scattered____light/\n\nThe box and its content is in storage at our new facility.\n\nIF YOU NEED AN EXTENDED SOUND BATH THEN OUR SLOW AMBIENT PLAYLIST WATERS ARE ALWAYS WARM & HERE FOR YOU 24/7\n\nWhat Your Ears Say & The Cover Looks Like\n\nWhat We Say\n\nAs beat culture approaches the half century marker, Makaya McCraven takes times to glance in the rearview mirror and reflect on it's evolution and infiltration of modern music before hitting the gas to make some of the best new millennial, organic beat injected, orchestra graced, back to the future jazz fusion around for International Anthem.\n\nWhat The Release NOtes Say\n\n​In These Times is the new album by Chicago-based percussionist, composer, producer, and pillar of our label family, Makaya McCraven.\n\nAlthough this album is “new,\" the truth it’s something that's been in process for a very long time, since shortly after he released his International Anthem debut In The Moment in 2015. Dedicated followers may note he’s had 6 other releases in the meantime (including 2018’s widely-popular Universal Beings and 2020’s We’re New Again, his rework of Gil Scott-Heron’s final album for XL Recordings); but none of which have been as definitive an expression of his artistic ethos as In These Times. This is the album McCraven’s been trying to make since he started making records. And his patience, ambition, and persistence have yielded an appropriately career-defining body of work.\n\nAs epic and expansive as it is impressively potent and concise, the 11 song suite was created over 7+ years, as McCraven strived to design a highly personal but broadly communicable fusion of odd-meter original compositions from his working songbook with orchestral, large ensemble arrangements and the edit-heavy “organic beat music” that he’s honed over a growing body of production-craft.\n\nWith contributions from over a dozen musicians and creative partners from his tight-knit circle of collaborators – including Jeff Parker, Junius Paul, Brandee Younger, Joel Ross, and Marquis Hill – the music was recorded in 5 different studios and 4 live performance spaces while McCraven engaged in extensive post-production work from home. The pure fact that he was able to so eloquently condense and articulate the immense human scale of the work into 41 fleeting minutes of emotive and engaging sound is a monumental achievement. It’s an evolution and a milestone for McCraven, the producer; but moreover it’s the strongest and clearest statement we’ve yet to hear from McCraven, the composer.\n\nIn These Times is an almost unfathomable new peak for an already-soaring innovator who has been called \"one of the best arguments for jazz's vitality\" by The New York Times, as well as recently, and perhaps more aptly, a \"cultural synthesizer.\" While challenging and pushing himself into uncharted territories, McCraven quintessentially expresses his unique gifts for collapsing space and transcending borders – blending past, present, and future into elegant, poly-textural arrangements of jazz-rooted, post-genre 21st century folk music. creditsreleased September 23, 2022\n\nMakaya McCraven - drums, sampler, percussion, tambourine, baby sitar, synths, kalimba, handclaps, vibraphone, wurlitzer, organ\n\nJunius Paul - double bass, percussion, electric bass guitar, small instruments\n\nJeff Parker - guitar\n\nBrandee Younger - harp\n\nJoel Ross - vibraphone, marimba\n\nMarta Sofia Honer - viola\n\nLia Kohl - cello\n\nMacie Stewart - violin\n\nZara Zaharieva - violin\n\nGreg Ward - alto sax\n\nIrvin Pierce - tenor sax\n\nMarquis Hill - trumpet, flugelhorn\n\nGreg Spero - piano\n\nRob Clearfield - piano\n\nMatt Gold - guitar, percussion, baby sitar\n\nDe’Sean Jones - flute\n\nAll music composed by Makaya McCraven; except “Lullaby” composed by Makaya McCraven based off a song originally written by Péter Dabasi and Agnes Zsigmondi.

He carries on with the intentions that inspired the Nimbudala project: looking less towards the natural world and more toward the human experience, widening the instrumental palette, and embracing a more diverse array of sonic influences. This work comes from a love and appreciation of Jazz, Kosmiche, Psychedelic, and New Age musics. And while one can hear those touchstones, these pieces still manage to sound like no other work besides the endeavors of Steve Targo.\n\nThese tracks diverge from those on “Universal Compassion” in that they are much looser and less cyclical. They have a meandering and dynamic quality that is enhanced by their duration, allowing the listener to settle in and become absorbed in these meditations and freak outs. The album opens with the relatively mellow ebbs and flows of “Radical Expansions of Love”, setting the scene and inviting us into the space: an ever-growing fanfare of percussion playing call and response with spaced out synth melodies. “Peace Rock I” takes us to the other end of the spectrum with an insistent groove, layers of weaving synths, and a constant shimmer of bells, which all cohere into an ecstatic blend. “Peace Rock II” finds itself resting upon more relaxed rhythms with adventurous interpretations of repeating melodic figures, bending and warping around the beat for a hazy ride. “Nan Midol” closes the album with fiery drumming that steadily calms into a more sedate rhythm against an assemblage of interlocking synth lines to gently guide us to the conclusion of the journey.\n\nCREDITS\n\n​All music by Steve Targo.\n\nArtwork by Sean Conrad.\n\nSpecial thanks to: Stefan Beck, Sean Conrad, & Matt LaJoie.\n\nIF YOU DIG THIS THEN YOU ARE PROBABLY ATTUNED TO THE NEW AGE OF NEW AGE PLAYLIST"
