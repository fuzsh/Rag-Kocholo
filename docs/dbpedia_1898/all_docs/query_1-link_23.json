        "text": "Final Fantasy XII is a decent RPG. But, based on Final Fantasy standards, this game can only be considered abysmal.\n\nUser Rating: 7.6 | Final Fantasy XII PS2\n\nIt is finally here. After numerous delays, Final fantasy XII finally hit shores in the United States on Halloween, October 31st. This release from Square-Enix marks a change in the Final Fantasy games. They will never be the same. Gone are the turn based battles from the SNES, and the Playstation. Now, Square has gone in a completely different direction with the battle system. This isn't the only change. Recent Final Fantasy games have revolved around the theme of love. However, that isn't the case in the latest installment. The story now revolves around war. Plainly put, other than the MMO XI, this Final Fantasy is the worst in years.. maybe ever.\n\nLet me just say this first. I am a Final Fantasy junkie. I am addicted to the games, and still play a lot of the earlier ones, so I am not bias. With that being said, against popular belief, this game is just such a let down. The story is no longer about love. It's about a war in which a powerhouse of a country called Archadia is conquering all the kingdoms around it. That brings it to a small one called Dalmasca. Instead of wasting the lives of his citizens, the king decides to surrender. The game follows a poor man living in Rabanastre(the Dalmascan capital) named Vaan. He eventually meets a skypirate named Balthier, and his partner Fran. This sets him off on an adventure where he meets a huge cast of characters and attempts to save Dalmasca. But, even with all of this I can't say that this story steps up to the level of previous Final Fantasy games. This kind of story is just so outplayed. Poor boy trying to save the world from complete evil. Give me a break. If you're looking for an original story then this is not your game.\n\nAs I stated earlier, the biggest change is how the battles are fought. Unlike previous games in the series, battles are no longer turn based at all. The battle system is now ike an MMO, just not with other people. Not only that, but Square-Enix has implemented a new system called the \"gambit\" system. With this, the user can set up each character with commands they use in certain situations. For example, you can set Balthier to \"Use Remedy,\" whenever a character's status is \"Poison\". That is just a very simple one. But, in order to get these, first you must win battles and get license grid points. I'll get into the liscence grid later, but you must unlock slots to place the gambits in. Then, you must go to a store and actually buy the gambits. It may sound easy, but some gambits sell for a lot of money, and there isn't a lot of that in the game since you don't gain any after winning battles. Many people have taken a liking to this new system. But to me, it just strips down the game. All it means is each battle you only control one of the party members, and the rest you leave on gambits. You can use every member, but constantly changing characters is very tedious, and I don't recommend it. Another blemish in this game is that the characters have absolutely no life. A huge thing for me, and plenty of other gamers, is the characters. How well you like some characters is key to how well you like a game. Not a single character in the game really grabs the player's attention and connects with them. I actually liked Balthier when I first saw him in the game. I mean, the guy was a pirate, and has a BA attitude. But, the rest of the cast around him must have made him seem worse. If he had been with the cast from X, then I think he may have been much more likable. Also a flaw with the characters is that none of them are original. What I mean is, any character can use any weapon, use any limit break, summon any esper, have any stat as it's best, etc. Some people will argue that this makes everyone customizable for the player. You can look at it that way. But, it just seems that they are all drones and there isn't an ounce of anything unique in them. Combine this with the lack of any character development AT ALL, and the characters are just worthless.\n\nRemember the sphere grid from X? Well, the creators don't use that anymore but use more of a skill grid, called the license board. Basically, after every battle you gain License points(LP). Usually you only get a few, but you can get a good amount for stronger monsters or hunts. Use these to basically purchase different skills or weapons. Not really, the skill or the weapon, but the ability to use them. Let me give you an example. Use Ashe, and buy the ability to use life. Then you must go to a shop, and buy the ability life. Now, in the game you will be able to use this skill. I have no complaints about this system, except that it strips the characters of their uniqueness. Still, this board is a pretty smart invention that should be used more in future games.\n\nIn the graphics department, the Final fantasy series still shines through. By the time this game was released, the Playstation 2 was at the end of it's life span(merely two weeks before the Playstation 3 was released). This game is pretty much maxing out the ability of the PS2. The emotions on the character's faces show what is going on and exactly how that character feels about it. The cities are absolutely gorgeous. They seem almost lifelike with all of the masses of people around. There are buildings all around, and I must say they look good. The environments outside are all nice, and very realistic(minus the whole mob thing). I can't say enough to congratulate Square-Enix on making such a beautiful world.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't say the same for the audio part of the game. Although Nobuo Uematsu did take part in part of the music, the majority of it was done by Hitoshi Sakimoto. The only other experience this man had in Final Fantasy games was his work on Final Fantasy Tactics. The music is just not as good as the music in every other Final Fantasy game. Not to mention a main theme song \"Kiss Me Good-bye,\" by Angela Aki that doesn't even fit the game. This is one of the most disappointing parts of the game to me. I am an absolute addict to the music in Final Fantasy. I even own the OST for VII and VIII(Yes, I am a geek thanks for askin'!). I can't explain my feeling on this. Then there is the voice acting. This is dull. I have read people praising the work done here, but I am on the complete opposite end of the pole. Vaan sounds like a lifeless drone babbling on about worthless knowledge. Compared to the work by the cast of X, the cast for XII is just garbage.\n\nThis game is a long game. With that said, I'm sure you must be wondering why I gave it only a 7 in value. Well, that's because this game doesn't own any sidequests worth doing at all. There are hunts, but they're basically fighting one monster to get enough gil to survive. What happened to a fun mini game like Triple Triad? With all of the characters out on the streets to play with, and a ton of mobs, a game like this would have been incredible. The main story is the only thing that keeps the game going, and it just becomes tedious after a while, with nothing else to do.\n\nI'm sure all Final Fantasy fans have already bought this game, or will as soon as they get the money(or for any other reason). I also know that reading this wouldn't even come close to changing anyone's mind. Hell, even if I read this I would probably go and get the game. I am only giving a friendly warning on how this game is not all it's cracked up to be. The graphics, and giant cities may dazzle you for a while, but the linear story, and ridiculously boring characters may turn you off a few hours in. The bottom line is this: You can expect a decent game, but don't be surprised if this game ends up being the worst Final Fantasy you've ever played.\n\nOther Helpful Reviews for Final Fantasy XII\n\nRating:9.5\n\nWith a new combat system and yet another intriguing story, Final Fantasy XII breathes new life into the series.\n\nIf it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.
