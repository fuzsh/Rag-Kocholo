        "text": "The 6th Jojo series I’ve read, and so far my favorite one. Story follows a young Italian Giorno Giovanno (giogio?) who joins an Italian gang Passione to find and defeat the boss and become a “gang star.” At this point of the Jojo series Araki really has the formula down: Take a very principled hero, some variation of a Jojo -> Give them a mission -> Give them a team -> Make them all sort of anti heroes but with sympathetic backstories -> Give them a final boss, some variation of a Dio -> And then give them a bunch of enemies along their journey -> And finally, give them all a bunch of cool costumes, good designs, and interesting stands => and then you have a sick Jojo series.\n\nThis one is my favorite mostly because I like the character and stand design the most here, and Giorno is my favorite Jojo. I like his design, I like his stand power, I like how he’s clearly a leader and wins a lot of his battles with his patience and wit, and like all other Jojos, a principled and passionate hero. I also like the supporting cast a lot in this series. Bruno is especially good and I think a zipper stand is so interesting and creative. I also liked this version of Dio a lot, and all of the minor protagonists along the way have good stands and fights that do a good job of highlighting each of the different characters in Giorno’s crew. I lke how you always know what you’re getting with Jojo, even if what you’re getting is always so wacky.\n\nMini Reviews:\n\nA Gentleman in Moscow - Amor Towles\n\nA very pleasant reread. I love how Towles brings glamor and honor to small settings and small moments, and manages to make even imprisonment (albeit in a fancy hotel) still feel grand and poignant. I found the ending abrupt the first time, and thought it hurt the book overall, but this time I felt satisfied, perhaps because I already knew what was coming and could appreciate the slightly meandering meat of the book more.\n\nGold Diggers - Sathian Sanjena\n\nI have a theory that the thing that people find the most deeply annoying are the things that are close to them, especially the things that are so close that they are clearly branches of you, and with a few changes, could easily be you today. I say that because I found the overachieving overpressured overly competitive protagonist to be extremely annoying, and had to really suffer through his perspective for the first half of the book. He remains annoying in the second half, but I liked what Sanjena does with the gold, and the ending was good and satisfying. The symbolism and all the characters were a little too on the nose, but I can forgive almost anything for a good ending.\n\nAttack on Titan - Hajime Isayama\n\nI read this many times over the years and dropped it many times because I either got bored or found it difficult to follow monthly. I really didn’t like this manga very much. I think the world building is attention grabbing and the character designs and the initial mystery is very exciting (titans!!! In the walls!!! Titans are the walls!!!) but everything else was either mediocre or bad to me, especially the ending. As a side note, this time I read it because I like 2 gossip and I saw people saying on twitter that the manga had fascist subtexts.\n\nLaughable Loves - Milan Kundera\n\nA masterful, but very sad collection of short stories by Milan Kundera on love. In his stories, love is violent, painful, and pathetic, yet seemingly inescapable at every turn. I read it as a more impressionable person in 2017, and again in 2021, and while I enjoyed it a lot both times, I do not recommend it if you have malleable impressions and thoughts about love\n\nGambling Apocalypse: Kaiji - Nobuyuki Fukumoto\n\nOne of the OG gambling mangas. I do not know the history well but I definitely feel like there’s a very straight clear line that can be drawn from this work to Squid Game, which is funny and interesting to think about. Anyways for these types of stories I always like the characters, and I find the game construction / figuring out the “trick” to the game to always be fun, but eventually I always get sort of bored and then I get actively disinterested when the story (inevitably) devolves into a discussion on human nature and greed and morality. After reading at least 10 different versions of this I feel the same about all of them.\n\nToriko - Mitsutoshi Shimabukuro\n\nA wacky shounen about food. The scaling is ridiculous, but the world building is good and the characters are cool and the food genuinely looks good (esp at the beginning, but it becomes kind of too crazy at the end).\n\nAmerican Gods - Neil Gaiman\n\nJust as good the… 5th time? Shadow is sooo boring but the rest of the characters are good and fun and I will literally always like modern and / or reimagined mythology.\n\nFirst Person Singular - Haruki Murakami\n\nI was baited because the first story was so good, but then the rest got progressively worse until the end where the stories were offensively bad both in content and theme. The first story really is so good though!!!! I love that kind of short story, nice, short, sweet, and a good satisfying ending to think about.\n\nYour brain is made to think about difficult things. To help you get to a point where you understand something that you didn’t understand at first. And that becomes the cream of your life. The rest is boring and worthless. That was what the gray-haired old man told me. On a cloudy Sunday afternoon in late autumn, on top of a mountain in Kobe, as I clutched a small bouquet of red flowers. And even now, whenever something disturbing happens to me, I ponder again that special circle, and the boring and the worthless. And the unique cream that must be there, deep inside me.\n\nAnother good reason why my favorites bookshelf is called “cream”\n\nThe Secret Hour - Scott Westerfield\n\nA YA book that I read when I was younger, about a group of kids born on the stroke of midnight that have access to a secret 25th hour, when monsters run free. The writing is honestly pretty bad, but I didn’t notice or mind when I was younger. The concept remains cool though, and I can see why I enjoyed it so much. The idea of a secret midnight hour is just appealing when you’re a kid at night having trouble sleeping, each of the secret midnighters with their own power, the number 13 having some special significance, Jessica’s big power reveal, all very enjoyable.\n\nOctavia's Brood: Science Fiction Stories from Social Justice Movements\n\n- Adrienne Maree Brown, Walidah Imarisha\n\nI read this for book club. A collection of sci fi short stories focused on social justice movements. I enjoy and respect speculative sci fi greatly, and a lot of the stories were interesting and interesting illuminations of problems in our current society. A lot of them felt too “on the nose” though, and too closely tied to today, and I was hoping to also see more hopeful scifi w imaginations of the future. A lot of these writers are also not professional writers, and while they had great ideas I think some of the execution was a little rougher around the edges.\n\nThe Long Way to a Small Angry Planet - Becky Chambers\n\nI loved this book!!! A very light fun sci fi read about a tunneling crew on a spaceship (they punch holes through space time to make tunnels that people can travel faster through). Just like in heist movies, my favorite part about these types of stories is the crew. Each member has their role, their own backstory, and the way the crew interacts with each other is so much fun. All the characters and their culture / customs / differences are well thought out, and I enjoyed the story and learning more about each character a lot. Even when the plot slowed down a bit in the middle I felt like the strength of the characters and writing kept the book enjoyable.\n\nGoodbye, Again: Essays, Reflections, and Illustrations - Jonny Sun\n\nAfter reading the book I liked Jonny a lot but the book less. I enjoyed a lot of what he was writing about and related to some of it, but it felt like a lot of his writing was very plain and I think lost a lot of its charm when stated instead of written, and oftentimes that extra explanatory sentence would spoil the vibe for me.\n\nTerritory of Light - Yuko Tsushima\n\nA short meditation on finding and building yourself, centered on being a single mother in japan and accompanied with lots of different kinds of light. A lot of fear, confusion, and anxiety in the book, but also brief moments of beauty and intense affection and care. Not a lot of sentimentality or self pity, which I appreciate and admired and found more relatable and realistic. I have come to appreciate light and its many different qualities and forms over the years. Recently I was working late at the pottery studio late by myself, and when I left and locked up I walked out to an empty street with lots of fog and very bright, thick beams of light. It felt very surreal, seeing almost solid chunks of light with the fog. This happened very soon after I finished the book, so light was on my mind, and after that I think I appreciated Tsushimas descriptions of light more.\n\nJames Baldwin: The Last Interview and Other Conversations - James Baldwin\n\nI haven’t read a lot of James Baldwin before, and thought this would be a nice gentle place to start. These interviews were good, and I now really want to read more Baldwin, but mostly I read it because I was so drawn to this quote in one of the interviews (I saw it on twitter):\n\n“But the so-called straight person is no safer than I am really. Loving anybody and being loved by anybody is a tremendous danger, a tremendous responsibility. Loving of children, raising of children. The terrors homosexuals go through in this society would not be so great if the society itself did not go through so many terrors which it doesn’t want to admit. The discovery of one’s sexual preference doesn’t have to be a trauma. It’s a trauma because it’s such a traumatized society.”\n\n“I think americans are terrified of feeling anything. and homophobia is simply an extreme example of the american terror that’s concerned with growing up. I never met a people more infantile in my life.”\n\nEffective C++: 55 Specific Ways to Improve Your Programs and Designs - Scott Meyers\n\nI read this book for book club at work… and it was a very good book… sadly I am at a part in my career where I not only benefit from but also appreciate these types of books. I really learned a lot from this book, and I really like having very specific examples to study and learn from. Some of the items (especially ch7, templates, and ch8, memory management) were difficult to fully wrap my head around, but all programming / tech books are really reference books and make more sense each time you have to go back and look at them. This book in particular I think will be good as I dig deeper into the engine and C++ next year, and I think regardless of background or interest, every programmer benefits from a strong understanding of C++.\n\nBeelzebub - Ryuhei Tamura\n\nI liked this manga years ago when I was reading it, but on my second reread it was actually better than I remembered. It is pretty silly, but it knows what it is and does it well, never taking itself too seriously. It remains a funny battle manga throughout and the arcs are nice and short and actually with some pretty cool fights.\n\nThe Stranger - Albert Camus\n\nI read this because everytime I drive, when the sun is shining right into my eyes, or when I’m on a walk, and the sun is bright overhead and I have to squint, I think of Meursault on the beach and how a very bright, strong sun bleaches and insubstantiates reality. No comment on the book itself.\n\nCrying in H Mart - Michelle Zauner\n\nI am a big fan of Michelle Zauner; I had a big Fader poster of her in my living room for something like 3 years. I liked her New Yorker piece a lot, I like her music, and I like her, so I was excited for this book. I heard some people say how it wasn’t that well written so I had low expectations going in, but the book was no asterisk good. It was well structured, and she was funny and interesting and wrote clearly and thoughtfully about something obviously very personal and painful. I liked how it was not very much about her music, but rather about her family and herself and her relationship to her mom and her culture and how they connected through food.\n\n笑傲江湖 - 金庸\n\nAnother 金庸 武俠小說. It was good, like all of his books are, but this one was definitely not one of my favorites. His stories are always long and exciting, but in this one the ending felt very abrupt, especially the bits around 任我行 and 日月神教 felt rushed. I also didn’t like the main character very much. I really dislike in 金庸 books when the main character falls for someone that clearly doesn’t feel the same way, and he gets wrapped in a painful love triangle that is super drawn out and primarily motivated by the protagonist being an idiot. It’s just a cringe storyline and was also my least favorite thing in 倚天屠龍記 and in 天龍八部. I also always really enjoy the martial arts, and I like reading about the different characters and sects and the slow buildup to the main character getting strong, but it just didn’t feel quite as satisfying in this one, compared to say 倚天屠龍記 or 射雕英雄傳. It was especially disappointing because a lot of people say this is their favorite (I read a thread on ptt). I also found book 4 to be super transphobic, especially the twist & the description of one of the central martial arts manuals. I know it is a product of a different time and culture, but I still found it off putting and for me, with the bad ending, really soured the series overall for me.\n\nWe Do This ‘til We Free Us is an incredible collection of speeches, essays, and interviews from Kaba on abolition, organized into 6 sections: an introduction to abolition, the concept of “perfect victims,” transformative justice, concrete demands of abolition, abolitionist practice and experiments, and accountability. Each chapter is so good and so powerful and so hopeful and I highlighted the shit out of everything. Really I would recommend this to anyone. It is one of the best books I have ever read. I just finished it recently but I am confident that this book is a life changer on the same scale for me as Blood in My Eye, Pedagogy of the Oppressed, Assata, etc. (the other books in the Josh twitter name book list lol). I’ve been reading a lot of radical lit over the last few years, and in the last few months I’ve realized that to continue my praxis I need to combine theory with practice. Kaba’s book came for me at the perfect time, in her writing she answered a bunch of questions I had about transformative justice and abolition and provides such a clear and hopeful path forward to finding a community and organizing with that community. I am truly grateful for her wisdom and care and ceaseless dedication and I cannot recommend this book more!!!!\n\nSome quotes I liked (too many to put down, I had 193 highlights):\n\nOn why we center black women:\n\nComplex structures of violence become disturbingly clear when we center Black women and girls.\n\nOn what PIC abolition is about:\n\nPrison-industrial complex abolition is a political vision, a structural analysis of oppression, and a practical organizing strategy. While some people might think of abolition as primarily a negative project—“Let’s tear everything down tomorrow and hope for the best”—PIC abolition is a vision of a restructured society in a world where we have everything we need: food, shelter, education, health, art, beauty, clean water, and more things that are foundational to our personal and community safety.\n\nOn centering imagination:\n\nLet’s begin our abolitionist journey not with the question “What do we have now, and how can we make it better?” Instead, let’s ask, “What can we imagine for ourselves and the world?” If we do that, then boundless possibilities of a more just world await us.\n\nOn transforming yourself as a necessary part of transforming society:\n\nWhen we set about trying to transform society, we must remember that we ourselves will also need to transform. Our imagination of what a different world can be is limited. We are deeply entangled in the very systems we are organizing to change. White supremacy, misogyny, ableism, classism, homophobia, and transphobia exist everywhere.\n\nOn police abolition:\n\nEnough. We can’t reform the police. The only way to diminish police violence is to reduce contact between the public and the police.\n\nOn transformative justice:\n\nTransformative justice is about trying to figure out how we respond to violence and harm in a way that doesn’t cause more violence and harm. It’s asking us to respond in ways that don’t rely on the state or social services necessarily if people don’t want it. It is focusing on the things that we have to cultivate so that we can prevent future harm. Transformative justice is militantly against the dichotomies between victims and perpetrators, because the world is more complex than that: in a particular situation we’re victimized, and in other situations we’re the people that perpetrate harm. We have to be able to hold all those things together.\n\nMini reviews:\n\nThe reviews below are mini reviews, something new I’m trying out. The razor for a mini review is:\n\ndid I like this book?\n\ndo I have something interesting to say about this book?\n\n(very unfortunately but true) do I like the book cover of this book?\n\nThe Hobbit, or There and Back Again - J.R.R. Tolkien\n\nI like The Hobbit a lot more than the LOTR series actually. I feel like The Hobbit is more charming and a lot of the LOTR series was kind of dry to me. I’m not sure if it’s because The Hobbit is shorter, but I felt like the story was more memorable and I had to trudge through fewer pages describing endless trees or rocks. I also really like Bilbo, and I think his character arc / his trip there and back again were both very satisfying.\n\nAnxious People - Fredrik Backman\n\nI am an avowed Fredrik Backman fanboy and have read many of his books, so I was also excited for this one especially because the premise seemed interesting, but I was so insanely disappointed. The things I feel like he does best are building strong emotional moments and creating thoughtful characters and in both of those things he fell so incredibly short in Anxious People. Characters were so one dimensional that they felt like caricatures, story felt way too forced (despite things fitting even more nicely in A Man Called Ove), writing was so cringe and overly prescriptive in its description. Just overall a very heavy handed work. I found it hard to believe it was written by the same author. I still finished it because it was a short read and the ending still turned out to be somewhat satisfying, but I definitely am deeply disappointed in this book. I remember writing the review for beartown and talking about how pleasantly surprised i was that he could do it again, and in such a wildly different dimension, but somehow after a couple more books he absolutely whiffs it in a book that is pretty much in the same genre as the first.\n\nSeverance - Ling Ma\n\nA woman joins a group of stragglers and struggles to survive after the world is taken over by a pandemic, leaving those affected as zombies. It is a pretty interesting premise & is pretty well written (a lot of people picked it up during the pandemic for obvious reasons) but the ending was pretty uninspired and I felt like the themes of solitude and routine could’ve been explored better. They serve more as backdrops to the story than the backbone of the story itself.\n\nAlice in Borderland - Haro Aso\n\nAlice in Borderland is about a group of four dudes who get transported to an alternate Tokyo and have to play in twisted games to survive. I watched the Netflix series, got bored halfway, then read the manga.The manga is unfortunately also not very good. I think it takes a very common (but popular) premise, doesn’t execute on it that creatively (imo Kakegurui and Liar Game both do it better), and doesn’t really explore or dissect themes on relationships and human nature well, which is fine but actually kind of important in psychological thrillers and the poor attempts to do so really hurt the ending for me. I don’t need my stuff to all be deep, but if it tries to be I want it to do a good job.\n\nThe Da Vinci Code - Dan Brown\n\nThe Da Vinci Code is further evidence that a book does not need to be remotely good to be entertaining lol. If you don’t take it too seriously it’s actually a pretty fun read, if you take it seriously (as Dan Brown himself unfortunately seems to) then the book is pretty goofy. Everyone digs a good conspiracy tho-- there’s a reason why the book is so popular.\n\nAlmond - Won-pyung Sohn\n\nAlmond is about a teenager who is incapable of feeling feelings and makes friends with a delinquent Gon, and thru that friendship both of them transform. I went into it w pretty high expectations but it was just a pretty typical feel good story. The premise was interesting to me initially and I guess I expected it to be darker but in retrospect it is the perfect premise for a feel good story lol.\n\nSeptimus Heap - Angie Sage\n\nSeptimus Heap is a series about a magical boy in a world of magic. I read this in middle school and I got really into the world. I especially liked the bold font and the alternative spelling of all the magic (magyk?) lol. I read it again a few years ago, that time actually finishing the series (I think Sage was still working on the series back then) and it was pretty entertaining. I tried reading it again recently and it definitely feels stale. The story & the world building are still impressive, but the characters & the writing are not that interesting. A lot of pretty cliche stuff. Some children’s books are stunning in their creativity and their simplicity is definitely an expression of the author’s imagination and skill, like The Phantom Tollbooth, The Enchanted Forest Chronicles etc. Others I think are just entertaining, which is fine but as a result ages worse (e.g. Septimus Heap, Artemis Fowl, Alex Rider, etc.).\n\nIf you are interested in the loneliness and pain of a man divided between his human self and his wolf self then read Steppenwolf.\n\nMy friend Trisha has very similar thoughts on this book but was much more articulate than me on them so I’m going to cop out of a real review by quoting her in entirety (with minor edits):\n\nok so like a lot of the books i like steppenwolf captures specific instances of the human experience that are quite transformative or fundamental (to some). so in the preface when the nephew says that the events are \"tangible representations of intangible events\" i really like that because it means that the events of steppenwolf are representations of spiritual feelings through physical acts that aren't realistic but are representative\n\nfor example, harry haller and hermine are jungian opposites (anima and animus) and while i'm not too caught up on the psychological facet of that representation, i think it fundamentally comes down to one of the \"splits\" that the personality has - both of which are very real parts of him\n\ni like that at first haller thinks he has to either be the man or the wolf, but through his interaction with hermine he realizes that each individual is made out of infinite parts (a discovery that culminates in the magic room) because i suppose i relate quite a bit to that - there's this fundamental self but at the same time by sticking to one identity you lose out on other, sometimes paradoxical, identities that are worth something as well and that are part of you as well. there's the independent, 'wolfish' part of harry that desires to be away from the rest of humanity. then there's the part of haller that wants to be loved as a whole and feels attracted to bourgeois society, even though he is still skeptical of it. and hermine teaches him that this isn't two contradictory selves, but different parts of one self\n\nsteppenwolf to me is about seeing identity as something multidimensional and something not to be too fixated by. it's also about the phrase \"learn what is to be taken seriously and laugh at the rest.” haller's really serious at first but he learns to loosen up and appreciate things in the world through hermine, who is meant to be the lighter part of his personality. he learns to appreciate mozart through the gramophone, he learns to dance, he learns to see the heroic in the every day. and so when he finally kills hermine, it's symbolic of the unification of his personality where he learns to not be a dichotomy or a split in any number of ways but a unified self. in a way, accepting paradoxes within, and he's conflicted about the division because he feels both\n\nThe only thing I have to add is while I was reading Steppenwolf I found myself getting drawn into Harry’s monologues because I also often feel a sharp division in myself and struggle with what I perceive to be the “wolfish” parts of myself, but then he would follow these passages up by saying Harry was stupid and the division was artificial, and fuck… he’s right… Sometimes I do think the whole thing is pretty juvenile, akin to being a middle schooler and sulking because you feel misunderstood. Is the Steppenwolf just an angsty puppy? Hesse wrote Steppenwolf in his 50s but I am not surprised at all that it has been enduringly popular amongst teenagers for decades.\n\nSome quotes I liked:\n\nOn the division in the Steppenwolf:\n\nThese persons all have two souls, two beings within them. There is God and the devil in them; the mother’s blood and the father’s; the capacity for happiness and the capacity for suffering; and in just such a state of enmity and entanglement towards and within each other as were the wolf and man in Harry. Their life consists of a perpetual tide, unhappy and torn with pain, terrible and meaningless, unless one is ready to see its meaning in just those rare experiences, acts, thoughts and works that shine out above the chaos of such a life.\n\nOn the artificial division:\n\nThe division into wolf and man, flesh and spirit, by means of which Harry tries to make his destiny more comprehensible to himself is a very great simplification. It is a forcing of the truth to suit a plausible, but erroneous, explanation of that contradiction which this man discovers in himself and which appears to himself to be the source of his by no means negligible sufferings. Harry finds in himself a human being, that is to say, a world of thoughts and feelings, of culture and tamed or sublimated nature, and besides this he finds within himself also a wolf, that is to say, a dark world of instinct, of savagery and cruelty, of unsublimated or raw nature. Harry consists of a hundred or a thousand selves, not of two. His life oscillates, as everyone’s does, not merely between two poles, such as the body and the spirit, the saint and the sinner, but between thousand and thousands.\n\nOn dancing:\n\nShe danced wonderfully and I caught the infection. I forgot for the moment all the rules I had conscientiously learned and simply floated along.\n\nOn lightness:\n\nI suspect you of taking love frightfully seriously. That is your own affair. You can love as much as you like in your ideal fashion, for all I care. All I have to worry about is that you should learn to know a little more of the little arts and lighter sides of life. In this sphere, I am your teacher, and I shall be a better one than your ideal love ever was, you may be sure of that! It’s high time you slept with a pretty girl again, Steppenwolf.\n\nTimequake - Kurt Vonnegut"
