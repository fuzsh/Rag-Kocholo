        "text": "Quote\n\nTakeko : A tattoo is just an empty image, nothing more. Jade : I won't accept that! I asked you for a tattoo to symbolise \"remembered love\" and you made this for me. It is love!\n\nOverview\n\nThis award winning film by lesbian director Zero Chou, set in modern day Taiwan in the aftermath of the 1999 earthquake follows the lives of two girls, whose lives were affected by the disaster.\n\nSynopsis\n\nTakeko is a young woman who chose to follow in her father’s footsteps and become a tattooist after he was crushed to death when saving his son, her brother, from their collapsing house in the Taiwan earthquake of 1999.\n\nHer brother, Ching suffered PTSD and has only one clear memory; that of the beautiful yet haunting spider lily tattoo on his father’s arm.\n\nIn memory of him, Takeko asks her tutor to tattoo the same design onto her own arm even though he tells her that the image of the Spider Lilies (Manjusaka), which line the path to Hell and whose poisonous root causes memory loss, is cursed.\n\nThere is another, more personal reason she wants the tattoo and that is to try and help her disabled brother. By having the tattoo copied onto her own arm, she hopes to bring her brother closer to her. It is clear that she is filled with remorse for Ching and later in the film we find out that she blames herself for his current plight.\n\nWhen not in the studio, she devotes all of her spare time to looking after Ching who tragically does not even recognise Takeko as his sister. To mask her guilt and deep feelings of loneliness, she buries herself in her work and in caring for her brother, and only expresses her emotions in the stories she tells to him of the strange and varied customers that visit her shop in search of tattoos, closing herself off from all friendship and solace.\n\nJade is a local teenager living with her grandmother in a poor, run down apartment. She makes easy money as a seedy webcam chick, capitalising on her youthful appearance to bring in all of the wrong sorts of clientele. She dresses like a little girl and tells melancholy tales to her dolls, remembered from her past and flirts with the nameless clients on the other end of the camera, encouraging them to go one-on-one privately with her for a significant fee. The clients, unsure as to her actual age are quite keen to pay up.\n\nHowever, Jade senses that her clients are starting to lose interest at her lack of “adventure”, so Jade makes up a spicy story about having a secret tattoo and decides to get one to go with her stories.\n\nJade, comes to the tattoo parlour seeking a tattoo for “a remembered love” and points to the Manjusaka design on the wall, one that she remembers seeing as a child. It doesn’t take her long to put two and two together.\n\nShe tells Takeko a cryptic tale about falling in love with someone when she was nine years old, someone who had that tattoo on her arm, like the one adorning the wall of Takeko’s parlour.\n\nTakeko, recalling nothing of Jade however, rebuffs her off-hand, much to Jade’s chagrin and tells her that memories shouldn’t be trusted.\n\nJade, who’s memories are all that she has is upset but she embarks on a quest to make Takeko remember her and starts a concerted effort to revive her memories, which Takeko has spent nearly a decade trying to bury.\n\nImpressions\n\nThe teenage cybertale beginning with it’s surreal colours and the typing coming up on screen hints at All About Lily Chou Chou （リリィ・シュシュのすべて）by Iwai Shunji and demonstrative scenes and camera facing during characters’ narrative is reminiscent of Trainspotting by Danny Boyle.\n\nThe most fascinating thing about the lead characters is how they embody the extreme approaches people take to dealing with trauma.\n\nJade, tries her hardest to remember everything, to hold on to every sweet moment, few and far between though they were, as if they were her last and most precious possessions. She believes that everything is transient and that existence is only as real as the memories of those involved. Be forgotten and you cease to exist.\n\nTakeko is the opposite: Stony and cold, she has cut herself off from the pain of her past by forcing herself to forget everything, and floats lifelessly through the present like a rootless tree. For her, only the present has meaning and as soon as something becomes the past, it is left behind. Yet contradictorily she fills her days and nights with self pity and guilt for what she has done to her brother while at the same time denying herself the solace that would heal her.\n\nThe non-linear storyline flits from present to past in a slightly uneven and disconcerting way. Some scenes appear cut short and hurried, while others appear to linger a little longer than is comfortable. Intentional no doubt, but it does make the rhythm of the film a little difficult to follow.\n\nThese flashbacks serve to flesh out the lives of Takeko and Jade little by little, following Takeko’s slow reawakening from her morbid, empty state as Jade forces her bit by bit to remember the past and Jade herself.\n\nAs the film progresses, we see how the earthquake, and a romantic liaison changes her outlook on life and why she blames herself. We also learn that this story is as much about the affection-starved Jade whose being abandoned and subsequently forgotten by her mother is the seed of her fixation on Takeko.\n\nAs a father, the scenes of the indescribably desperate nine-year-old Jade, though brief, were some of the most heart wrenching moments I’ve seen on screen to date and left me in tears.\n\nThe 18 year old Isabella Leong shows remarkable adaptability for this demanding role, whether its playing a high school tomboy crush, the devoted sister for Ching, the substitute mother for Jade, the talented but troubled tattooist with a buried past or the reawakened and emotional woman she hints at becoming.\n\nEvery moment she’s on the screen, she captivates and convinces the audience, pulling them into her world.\n\nHowever, just when the film starts to promise rewards to the viewer for following the winding and escalating plot with some stunning revelations, it instead starts to unravel and loose focus, plot threads fragment into what I can only, and unfortunately, describe as weird shit.\n\nPlot lines which had been simmering suddenly come to a head, but not in a particularly coherent way. It’s more like Chou forgot the end of the film was coming until it was too late.\n\nAnd just to heap even more weight onto the already emotionally encumbered lead’s shoulders, the illicit liaison towards the end of the film appears to draw the wrath of whatever gods are watching and Takeko is punished once more, just when she is coming to terms with and makes peace with her situation.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nThis is essentially a film about memories: About choosing to remember or choosing to forget. About how we are the sum of our memories and how, if we cannot come to terms with and overcome the past, we can never be happy with what we have right here, right now.\n\nWhether the director was searching for an extra bit of angst or melodrama at the end of the film is uncertain. It is perhaps more likely that a young and inexperienced Chou bit off a little more than she could chew and was unable to present the finale’s dense threads in coherent and comprehensible way.\n\nAs for assets, the main actresses are captivating together and prove that opposites can attract the audience as well as each other.\n\nThen there is the highlight of the whole film, the backdrop of the earthquake and the childhood images of Jade with a young Takako are moments of magic and make this film a tearfest.\n\nDespite this slight incoherence and the loss of focus of the jumbled ending, Spider Lilies is without doubt, an intelligent and thought provoking drama. It makes a valiant attempt at uncovering the wide vista of human emotional survival in the face of hardship and succeeds where a lesser film would fail to inspire.\n\nTwo thumbs up for this one!\n\nQuote\n\n[Dad, with slight frown]: Kate, there's a penis in your coat pocket. [Daughter, shrugging]: It's not mine.\n\nOverview\n\nRed Doors is the most lighthearted film in my – admittedly shallow – dip into Asian movies with gay and lesbian themes. Although to be honest, calling this a lesbian film is like saying Forrest Gump is a movie about sport.\n\nThis is a mainstream hollywood feel-good comedy, no two ways about it. Oh yes, and one of the characters is a lesbian.\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe film is about a mildly dysfunctional, middle classed Chinese family living in the suburbs of New York. The father has just retired, the mother is a dedicated home maker and the three children are all intelligent and good looking.\n\nThat would be the euphemistic way to describe the Wong Family.\n\nJust below the surface, problems abound. The father, splendidly portrayed by “Tzi Ma”, (watching his parts in 24 season 6 first just makes his lines even more poignant!) has lost his purpose after retirement and attempts to take his own life at every opportunity.\n\nThe oldest daughter, a successful businesswoman is having second thoughts about her marriage to a successful but inconsiderate yuppie. The middle daughter, the shiest of the three is an intern in medical school and is having second thoughts about her sexuality. The youngest and only remaining teenager in the family is the wellspring of much of the movies guffawing and comic relief has thoughts only about one, special boy in her life and not much else.\n\nThe story follows their father’s unnoticed depression as his energetic wife and daughters lead their busy lives oblivious to his plight and the chain of events that ultimately lead the disparate members of the family back together again.\n\nImpressions\n\nThese types of family comedies are clear, pattern driven movies with plots that follow well trodden paths through the forest of modern society and pressured family life with all its attendant problems. More than other categories, these comedies tend to fall cleanly into two groups: shite or genuinely funny.\n\nLuckily for Red Doors, it falls squarely into the latter category and had me in stitches at several points, leaving me feeling good without more than the occasional smidgen of wincing sappiness.\n\nOK, so the father feels disconnected from everything, the youngest daughter is the rebellious “rocker grrl” black sheep who spurns her family’s traditions and who nobody can really communicate with. So what’s new?\n\nWell, there’s the coming-out of the lesbian daughter, which hasn’t quite been flogged to death in the context of family mainstream comedies to the extent of the other bits.\n\nReally, there are only so many things that can be told when it comes to comedies featuring entire families and this film covers no new ground in and of itself. Yet what makes this film a success is how those stories are told and bound together by the chemistry of the excellent cast and how their characters relate to each other.\n\nAnd the family members really do just plain work well together, foibles and all. Their interactions are believable, charming, touching and funny in equal measures.\n\nHowever, this is no “Meet the Parents” or “Me, myself and Irene”, two landmark dysfunctional-family-taken-to-extremes comedies by which I benchmark all others\n\nFirstly, having been involved in the BBC (British Born Chinese) community in the UK, I can really say that the portrayal of Chinese-American culture in Red Doors was hackneyed, littered with stereotypes and unrealistic situations.\n\nWhen Red Doors’ community is lined up alongside the rich and suggestively deep background created by Alice Wu in Saving Face, it really fails to inspire. These differences are subtle, but very important for a culturally themed movie.\n\nWhere Saving Face built up a very specific and real image of a particular Chinese community in Flushing, (Queens, NY) that had character and substance – like a masterful portrait of a living, breathing person – Red Doors is more like a postcard from Chinatown.\n\nFor example, the characters, especially the older generation, talking English amongst themselves is just plain odd. Then there are the occasional “Chinese Customs” bits thrown in to remind the audience that this fluent, English speaking family is actually really, really Chinese.\n\nMy second big issue with this movie are the peripheral male love interests who for one, all happen to be Caucasian and while they are important enough to feature repeatedly and have direct impact on the Wong’s daily life, they appear as flat as the paper their scripts were written on.\n\nThe prime example here is the oldest daughter Samantha’s husband, an entirely unlovable and irredeemable “Hi I’m a PC” jobsworth who, while being reliable and trustworthy, would be immediately marked as “dead” in any teen horror movie, but is instead marked from the outset to merely be replaced by an “And I’m a Mac” old flame, complete with designer stubble and all.\n\nIn fact, the two are so “PC v Mac” I’m reminded that this blog is actually Technojunkie and not LesbianMovieReviewWeekly\n\nOUT DAMNED PC!\n\nBRING OUT THE MAC!\n\nTo be honest, only the youngest daughter and her love interest show any real original character development, and that relationship is one of the many touches that make this film so watchable.\n\nI intended this this series of reviews to be a “lesbian-interest” point of view so I will just make my token mention here.\n\nThe lesbian plotline here is absolutely not a social commentary. It’s as lighthearted and humous a relationship with its shares of cuteness and mishaps as any of the other relationship in the film and is really just intended to add another twist to the movie.\n\nUnfortunately, dispite having watched quite a few lesbian films over the last week or two, the relationship in this film looked contrived and was far more embarassing than I have come to expect from films in the last few years. I actaully found my finger hovering over the fast forward button during one or two of the cornier exchanges.\n\nOne could argue that the fact that they just rolled it in without any special attention is a testament to how really and truly mainstream audiences of a family comedy have progressed to the point of acceptance.\n\nAs I said, this is a family comedy and not a psychosocial essay on the current interracial trends gender issues of the US, so it can be forgiven for these transgressions given the juicy characters of the father and the exploits of his three delightful daughters.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nBig thumbs up. Uneven but with a superb cast and some honestly side-splittingly funny bits. Oh, and not to mention the funniest T-shirt punch-lines I’ve ever seen!\n\nThis is my first review since attempting to “Broaden my Horizons” and selecting Asian Gay and Lesbian Films as my category of choice.\n\nThis charming and gentle family drama first screened in Canada at the Toronto Film Festival in 2004. I call this a family drama and not a “gay movie” because that’s exactly what it is. It is one of the increasingly accessible breed of movies that tries to break away from the originality-destroying, art-as-product concept of “demographics”.\n\nIt’s a film where the gay aspect is central and crucial to the storyline yet neither belabours the issue to the point of preaching nor waters it down for the benefit of the right-wing American audiences, making this a true mainstream film without most of the compromises associated with them.\n\nThe main plot is so wonderfully involved that the fact of there being a gay relationship thrown in just adds to the fun. It’s one aspect among a number of interesting twists that keep this gentle and believable drama floating along with humour and verve, without the common mistakes of falling into farce or slapstick or becoming so hopelessly bogged down in emotion that you have to stop watching it half way through.\n\nThe plot hinges around a successful doctor who has been too busy for relationships for some time. She knows she’s gay and doesn’t appear to be in denial or have any issues with it per se, but it’s one of those things that she tends to suppress as an inconvenience that gets in the way of her all important career more than, say, a straight relationship would.\n\nMoreover, her mother, who caught her “in the act” some undisclosed time ago knows she’s gay but has pushed it under the table in the hope that it might just go away. And to help it do so, her mother drags her along to a terrible series of dating evenings to try and get her hitched to someone, anyone, so long as they’re male.\n\nThings change when she meets a dancer, Vivian who she’d seen at one of those evenings. They hit it off, only to find that Wil’s busy schedule and continued “protecting” of her mother from the truth becomes a strain on their otherwise quite happy relationship.\n\nThings start to disintegrate as Wil’s mother reveals a shocking secret, Vivian’s own career ideas start to take shape and Wil’s family suffers a tragic loss.\n\nTo be frank, I’ve never been a fan of family dramas, they tend to be a bit sappy and predictable. This one, though, has just enough meldrama and elements of surprise to bring a new, spicy twist to an old recipe of hope, disappointment, loss and personal fulfillment while -and I’m feeling a bit awkward writing this cliché- showing that lesbians are no different than anyone else. It’s so naturally woven into the fabric of the story that I completely forgot I was watching a film that triggered a ridiculous amount of controversy when it first showed!\n\nI feel it is such a shame to see the film pigeonholed by large distribution chains into small art-house theatres and gay and lesbian “friendly” venues just because of its “lesbian-interest” moniker.\n\nA big thumbs up recommendation for this one!\n\nFilm Trivia:\n\nIt includes the seemingly ageless definition of gorgeousness herself, Joan Chen (Those who don’t follow Asian cinema may recognise her from the 1980s TV series, Twin Peaks! How’s that for ageless?) Looking so young that it’s almost as improbable her being Wil’s mother as Wil being a surgeon.\n\nWil and Vivian’s first kiss on the screen was the first time they (Michelle Krusiec and Lynn Chen) kissed in real life, since there was no time for rehearsals. * It is not disclosed whether or not it was the first time they had ever kissed another woman…\n\nThe film was directed by Alice Wu, a Standford University BSc and MSc in Computer Science Graduate who went on to work at Microsoft in their multimedia division on a product called Cinemania, dispite wanting to be a film maker.\n\nShe started attending screenwriting classes while at Microsoft before deciding to leave and turn the semi-biographical book she had been writing about her own coming to terms with being gay in the Chinese community, into a film.\n\nShe fought long and hard to get the movie cast the way she wanted it, with Hollywood pressing her to cast it as a straight film, oh… and while she was at it, why don’t they just replace the Asians with nice, decent upstanding white people. Her stubborness gene kicked in, and refusing to budge she looked for another production company and found Wil Smith’s production company who were willing to cast it no questions asked the way she wanted it: Asians, lesbians and all!\n\nThus, another minor landmark was made: this was the first, big buget, All-Asian Hollywood film since the Joy Luck Club!\n\nAbout a year ago, I joined emusic.com, a fabulous site which, for US$9,99 a month allows me to download 40 songs. That’s 25c a song. At first, I just downloaded a few of the artists I already knew and enjoyed, but soon I found that there were no more artists I knew and liked available. Most of the downloads of the majors are restricted to the US, Canada and UK.\n\nThis forced me to come to a decision: give up because it doesn’t have any music I want to hear or force myself to start listening to artists I’d never heard of. Fortunately for me, I chose the latter option and during my emusic journey, I’ve expanded my selection to include various artists I’d never even heard of.\n\nI honestly feel the richer for the experience.\n\nHere are some of the more notable artists I heard for the first time on emusic and have had repeatedly my playlists over the last year:\n\nBadly Drawn Boy\n\nCat Power\n\nDamien Rice\n\nElbow\n\nElliott Smith\n\nGogol Bordello\n\niLIKETRAINS\n\nThe Mountain Goats\n\nSarah Nixey\n\nSia\n\nSpoon\n\nSusu\n\nThe Vanden Plas\n\nThe problem with the Internet and the supposed “freedom of information” is that we are given “ultimate choice”, we ultimately choose nothing. We just end up pumping ourselves up with what we already know and want; with what’s comfortable. So I asked myself, what’s the point of having a choice if we never use it?\n\nIt was as if hearing this music was a catalyst. I’ve started exploring the Internet wider and further afield, reading news and blogs outside of my usual narrow field of interest: computers, specifically Apple/Mac.\n\nOne of the more difficult decisions to make, when one has only a few hours per week available to one’s self is the choice of entertainment. I have forced myself to start reading and listening to novels again and am really enjoying it after a hiatus of nearly 10 years!\n\nAnother was to change the area of films I’m watching and try to watch one film a week rather than spend another two hours on the internet.\n\nInstead of going to the video shop and ending up renting another Sci-fi flick, I’ve spent a few of my lunchtimes at work over the last few weeks creating shortlists of films in different categories I want to rent and see and perhaps buy if I enjoy them.\n\nI only had a few criteria:\n\nAvoid the following genres:\n\nScifi (ala Matrix)\n\nTechy/Geeky (ala Swordfish)\n\nFantasy (ala Lord of the Rings)\n\nAction (Ala Bourne Identity)\n\nPolitical/Police Thriller (ala 16 Blocks)\n\nHorror (ala Ring)\n\nDocumentary (ala An inconvenient truth – it’s just a form of news)\n\nThe above categories account for over 90% of the films in my collection! For a while, I thought… Christ, what’s left? Comedy? But actually, there’s a lot more out there than just plain comedy.\n\nHistorical – for example Period dramas\n\nBiographical – stories about famous people, perhaps.\n\nHuman Drama – Overocming tragedy etc.\n\nWorld Cinema – a condescending title for stuff not in English.\n\nGay & Lesbian – A kind of pigeonholing of a broad range of films.\n\nOh yes,\n\nComedy – Funny stuff. I added this because I realised that besides Jim Carey, I have virtually no comedy at all in my library!\n\nI’ve been interested in Asian Cimena, especially cross-cultural films for some time but never seem to have the chance to watch any films by myself, for myself. So, I decided to delve into the deep end and mix a few of these themes together.\n\nI found some killer websites which detailed films based on various genres, but after a few days, one clear winner emerged for me. By far the most active, exciting, vibrant and colourful selection of movies was under Gay and Lesbian films. They have such a great community built about them, discussing, comparing, recommending, reading into and extrapolating them. It was a no brainer.\n\nEven more surprising was the fact that Asian gay and lesbian films were extremely prominent. And, so as to start myself with a reasonable selection, I chose this genre and have drawn up a shortlist of about 15 films.\n\nA couple, The Butterfy and saving Face, both from 2004, I watched last week and the week before and will talk about in another post. The rest, I’m awaiting a few hours to watch with eager anticipation!\n\nI’m glad to have taken the plunge and tried to escape the self imposed restrictions that ultimate freedom of choice incurs!!!\n\nGalapagos is a band I’ve been listening to since about 1995. I’d just started learning Japanese at the time and was beginning to make some Japanese friends.\n\nI started taking them out to clubs and live gigs and was showing them around as if we (westerners) had invented to concept of “live”.\n\nWas I in for a surprise. One girl, I forget her name now, came over the next day after a bunch of us went out for a night in Coventry. She handed me a tape and said, “If you liked that stuff last night, you’ll love this.”\n\nI was totally taken aback by what I heard. I never imagined that the Japanese could take a mixture of 80’s British punk, Adam and the Ants, generic rock and pop, mash in some pentatonic guitar riffs ala Shamisen and laser-glam it up for the nineties. Added to the era of Japan being the highly stressed economic king of the world, a client base with practically unlimited budget and a guaranteed profit, the Japanese post-bubble laser-punk scene gave rise to one of the most ridiculously outrageous fashion statements since Ziggy meets the National Front. We’re talking excess, taken to excess in a way only the uber-wealthy and highly-strung nation of Japan could manage or afford.\n\nEvery aspect of their work was over-the-top. The tempo, the changes in tempo, the number of beats per bar, the raving, maniacal lyrics and let’s not forget, the stupendous makeup and hairstyles du jour!\n\nThe band, to me seemed to typify the boundless wealth and exuberance of the 1990s fuck the world and then we die attitude.\n\nI played that tape long after the girl went back to Japan and if I could, I’d love to say a heartfelt thank you to her for giving me an experience to remember. I remember almost crying when the tape chewed itself to oblivion in my overpriced cassette deck, and thinking that I’d never hear them again.\n\nOf course, that was before knowing that I was going to come to Japan in 1999.\n\nOn arriving in Japan, I immediately started scouring the shops for the band’s CDs but of course, nobody had ever heard of the band and every time I’d gone to Kobe or Osaka, I’d prepared by printing out a list of some of the best secondhand CD shops in the region. I visited most on the list but none had them in stock. In the end I gave up.\n\nI found sketchy details that suggested they’d split up in the mid nineties: The were a victim of the Japanese consumers’ fickle appetite for change and Great New Things (TM).\n\nThen, lo and behold, one day when I visited a local CD shop in my neighbouring Toyooka, the only sizable town near Kinosaki, I found it completely by chance! One copy of Down By Law in pristine condition nestled in the oldies box. It cost me about 80p and three years!\n\nGalapagos – Down By Law, 1990.\n\nThe owner of the shop had no idea it was even there.\n\nNow, this in itself is only minor news. But a few years later, 2001 if I remember correctly, I was walking through the streets of Sapporo. The temperature was somewhere in the region of -12 degrees Celsius, typical January weather for that part of Japan. I glanced up from my feet for a moment and caught sight of a second hand CD shop.\n\nNow bear in mind that I’d not been looking for any second hand CDs for a long time and had passed dozens of second hand CD shops in the meantime. This one was no different and I walked on by.\n\nBut I got the strangest feeling. I had to stop walking. I felt I was being pulled back to the shop.\n\nI thought, “I wonder…” I went into the shop and asked sheepishly “You don’t happen to have Honey Pie by Galapagos, do you?”\n\nOf course he’d never heard of the band but duly checked on the computer anyway. Finally he laughed and said, “Wow. We have a copy that came in in 1995!”\n\nGalapagos – Honey Pie, 1993\n\nI’m writing this curiously, spuriously, oscuriously blog entry today because, in searching for info on Galapagos, I came across these absolute Gems on YouTube!\n\nSeriously, I had no idea the lead singer was so hot! And What a hairstyle!"
