        "text": "Angela Aki is one of the first Japanese singers I started listening to, after discovering her through FFXII’s Kiss Me Good-Bye. I think what I love about her is that she really enjoys singing from her heart and the piano, and you can really see it when she performs. I guess as a fellow piano player having most of her songs with piano as the main instrument, played by Angela herself is an added value which I appreciate a lot too.\n\nI just never get bored of her songs, catchy, sad and hopeful ones have accompanied me for life on bus rides and tougher moments. She’s really good at English too, being half Italian, and I wish she was more popular in Europe here. I was so sad when she announced that she postponed her career to study Music in Washington University, and I’m so glad she recently announced she will be returning to the music scene with a renewed spirit and knowledge. I’m really looking forward to that!\n\nHonestly I wish there was a way for me to contact her and say how much of a calming influence she has had on my life, I’ve been thinking of sending her a message/email, but it’s probably read by PR people and if there’s a mistake in it I sound so gaijin, maybe I better wait a little bit.\n\nBelow are the Japanese, Romaji and English transcription/translation of Again, an energetic song about a broken relationship sung in the big Budokan concert hall back in 2006. I managed to find this on YouTube, but unfortunately a lot of her videos on there have been struck by copyright so you will have to download or buy her albums somewhere if you want to listen to more of her work.\n\n(Lyrics Source)\n\nEnglish Translation\n\nThe last words of my love keep on\n\nringing like a siren of regret\n\nBecause I kept my cowardly heart in check\n\nI couldn’t tell you how I felt\n\nThough you’re no longer near me, I want to be by your side\n\nso I can look at your delighted expression as you\n\nsmile through your tears\n\nOh let my wish come true, come true, come true\n\nOh let me love you, love you, love\n\nLet me turn to you just one more time\n\nOh let my wish come true, come true, come true\n\nThe time for reality and ideals comes and goes\n\nas the pendulum of sentiment trembles\n\nI don’t care if rains, or storms, or if the sky\n\nis clear. I want to be there\n\nwalking besides you\n\nOh let my wish come true, come true, come true\n\nOh let me come back to you, come back to you, come back to you\n\nLet me turn to you just one more time\n\nOh let my wish come true, come true, come true\n\nYou and I in love again,\n\nyou and me again\n\nI want you to see my delighted expression as I\n\nsmile through the tears\n\nShake off the memories of the past\n\nI don’t care if rains, or storms, or if the sky\n\nis clear. I want to be there\n\nwalking besides you forever\n\nOh let my wish come true, come true, come true\n\nOh let me come back to you, come back to you, come back to you\n\nlet me love you, love you, love\n\nOh let our hearts be bound together, together, together\n\nIf I can turn to you one more time\n\nMy wish will come true, come true, come true\n\nYou and I in love again\n\nRomaji"
