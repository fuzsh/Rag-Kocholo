        "text": "Tokyo Disney Resort has released more content and details leading up to the July 9 new musical show “Out of Shadowland” at Tokyo DisneySea.\n\nOut of Shadowland is a new stage show that follows a young girl, Mei, as she explores a world of shadows and finds strength and confidence through her adventures. The show will feature projection mapping, the latest technology, a dynamic turning stage, and an original story and score.\n\nThe new show was produced with the talents of Japanese American singer Angela Aki. Angela is notable for her accomplished musical career in Japan, famous for her work as a solo artist. International audiences may remember her from the Final Fantasy XII theme song “Kiss Me Good-Bye”. Angela had been on a musical hiatus from 2014 pursuing musical studies in Los Angeles in preparation for work in Broadway but returned to Japan for her collaboration with Out of Shadowland. Angela worked with teams at Disney to create three original songs for the lead character in the musical, Mei.\n\nAngela Aki has stated of her work with Disney, “It has been a miracle to have been able to work on this project. As I continue my work on musicals, working on Out of Shadowland has given me invaluable experience I will keep for the rest of my life. I hope guests watch this new show with open hearts so that they may experience it to the very fibers of their existence.”\n\nA new video showing Angela and the Disney team working on the musical is found below. Out of Shadowland, featuring work from celebrated artist Angela Aki will open on July 9 at Tokyo DisneySea.\n\nKeep up with the latest from Tokyo Disney Resort by subscribing to TDRExplorer and following us on Twitter & Facebook.\n\nIf you found this article useful, please share this with your friends, family, and followers!
