        "text": "YOU GUYS. That episode…all I want to say is\n\nWe begin this episode with everyone doing their morning routines – Stabler is doing pushups on his knuckles and Jesus fucking Christ this man is in amazing shape. Bless Chris Meloni’s DNA & natural athleticism because I feel like I could train 18 hours a day for a year and I still wouldn’t be able to do what he’s doing in this scene.\n\nRichard Wheatley’s morning routine consists of getting head from Pilar while Ayanna and Denise are having a more typical morning. We learn that Denise is a lawyer and she’s ready to file the lawsuit against the NYPD all while Ayanna is getting ready for the Wheatley operation.\n\nBack at Wheatley’s, he’s got a whole new security force because he knows Izak is a mole. He kills him and his body falls into the…indoor reflecting pool? Any rich people reading this let me know if indoor reflecting pools are a thing.\n\nBefore we move forward, we have to talk about one of the true MVPs of this episode: Richard Wheatley’s double-breasted pinstriped suit.\n\nDylan McDermott is wearing the absolute fuck out of this suit. He looks amazing. Plus- a double-breasted pinstriped suit – complete with a CIGAR – for an Italian-American gangster? A perfect callback to gangster movies of Hollywood’s golden age with a slightly modern twist. Very Scarface, very Bonnie & Clyde. I see what you’re doing, show, and I fucking love it.\n\nThings start to go sideways with the operation right away – now that Bekher is dead, he won’t be the person driving around the CI who is supposed to buy the COVID product. (I honestly thought this whole thing was going to fail. Even after watching the episode twice something doesn’t feel right. Almost like ending up in police custody was Richard Wheatley’s plan all along. Idk. I’ll talk about it in my new Wild Theories section below.) Worse – Gina is missing.\n\nWhile new goons drive the CI around, Denise’s lawsuit makes the news (apparently Denise is a lawyer who has no idea how to say “no comment” to the press when they are asking about her wife), pissing of the captain of ESU, who already hated Ayanna because\n\nThat is correct, Stabler. ESU dude is a bigoted assbag.\n\nSloots, knowing that the team is just Ayanna, Stabler, Morales, and a sack of rocks with feet, takes it upon herself to head into the field. She has a gun and everything!\n\nWhen Wheatley arrives at the location where the buy is supposed to take place, he notices an additional security camera has been put there by the Guardos. This pisses Wheatley off and he changes the location of the buy to the least crowded subway station in all of New York City. How very fortunate that these men can conduct illegal business at a volume loud enough to be overheard by everyone on the platform yet barely anyone is around. In a city of 8 million people.\n\nEveryone heads into the subway, including The Mole Washburn who somehow doesn’t think that this outfit screams “undercover cop.”\n\nWhen the bust finally goes down Wheatley jumps a subway and Stabler follows him, catches him, and they arrest him. The entire Wheatley empire crumbles. All of this happens too easily.\n\nWhen the OC team gets back to headquarters, Moenig tells Ayanna that they found Gina’s body. I was really hoping that she hadn’t died and they’d find her in some hospital in Jersey but…damn.\n\nAyanna and Stabler go to talk to Richie about Gina’s death. Dana, the smart one, is screaming at him not to talk to anyone without a lawyer, but Richie is kinda dense. He also made Ayanna cry by killing Gina and I will absolutely not stand for this. We do not tolerate Ayanna Bell disrespect in this house. Ayanna moves to attack Richie and Stabler stops her saying “we don’t do that.” I’m sorry, but the list of SVU perps Stabler did not in some way brutalize is like three names long. We don’t do that – since when, Elliot?\n\nThen ::heavy sigh:: Angela Wheatley shows up. She’s been Up To Stuff this whole episode but I honestly do not care. Her lawyer was like “did you bang Stabler” and she’s like “no” and then he’s like “Are you in love with him?” which she does not answer.\n\nLook here, Angela – You’ve talked to him for, what, a total of 45 minutes? You aren’t “in love” with this man! You don’t know him. You like him? You’re attracted to him? You’ve spent a lot of time thinking about what it would be like to feel his weight pressing you into the mattress as he settles between your thighs? 100%, I’ll give you that. But that’s not love. Love comes later. Get the fuck out of here with that nonsense.\n\nAngela has been cooperating (whatever that means) and her one condition is that she wants to talk to Richard with Stabler in the room. Nothing fishy or weird about this at all! And then, it happens. The scene that made the internet explode.\n\nI would just like to quote myself in my last review and this tweet I sent out several weeks ago. Emphasis mine:\n\n“So, in a bit of Shakespearean fuckery, she decided that if Stabler took the love of her life, she was going to take the love of his (except the love of Stabler’s life is currently walking around NY with a Captain’s shield and a gun.)”\n\nI mean, we all knew. But damn does it feel good to hear it.\n\nI just want to point out that I do not believe a god damned word Angela Wheatley says. I believe Richard when he says that he has her on tape planning Kathy Stabler’s murder and arranging it so Elliot would have had to step away to take a call.\n\nAs Angela is talking Wheatley calls her out for still trying to seduce Stabler. He actually says “You know you’re not the love of his life!” Uh, yeah, she’s known him for all of 15 seconds, of course she’s not.\n\nBut then he says: “Nor was that poor woman you had brutally murdered the love of his life.”\n\nOh. Poor Kathy Stabler. But it’s always been pretty obvious that the Stablers’ marriage died over the course of most of SVU’s early seasons and had to be resurrected solely because Elliot knocked Kathy up. Again. (There’s even a scene where she comes to ask him to come home and he starts to say no…until she tells him she’s pregnant.) That’s not to say that he didn’t love her. I believe Elliot Stabler fiercely loved his wife. But it was the kind of love that is born out of duty – duty to his family, duty to his responsibilities as a father and husband, duty to his idea of what a good man is and how that kind of man behaves, duty to the woman he swore to love, honor, and cherish in front of his family and his God. That’s the kind of love that kept them together. And at the end of the day, Elliot made choices to be the kind of dutiful man who honors the promise he made to his wife when he was barely 18. He was a faithful husband and a present father…even if his heart belonged somewhere else.\n\nAnd Richard Wheatley, using whatever inside intel he has, figured that out. He says:\n\n“Plot twist – there’s someone else. Another woman. Who’s the one true love of his life.”\n\nMuch like the Stabler kids at the intervention, we’re all sitting around like “Yeah. We know.” BECAUSE WE KNOW. Elliot and Olivia have been in love for years. And they’re not very good at hiding it. I think the only people who weren’t very aware of their feelings for each other were the two of them – or at least they were the last to know. (And I’d bet that Stabler’s reason for leaving SVU without a word to Olivia comes down to him finally figuring out that he’s in love with her and he knew he couldn’t be the kind of dutiful, honorable family man he saw himself as and still keep her as his partner.)\n\nBut now that Wheatley knows, that means he’s coming for Olivia. I do hope she gives it to him as good as she gets it because, at the end of the day, Olivia is a badass who can handle her own shit.\n\nI’m very excited for the next episode!\n\nWild Theories:\n\nPlease note that these are just theories I have about the show. I have no proof and I’m sure several of them will be incorrect. I’m doing it anyway.\n\nI’m still all in on The Mole Washburn. It’s too much of a coincidence that Ayanna and Stabler remind everyone that they are also listening for Wheatley to talk about knocking off important people and then he does it. Plus, Wheatley knows about Olivia, so he had to get someone with NYPD ties to give him information (files, jackets, or, like I wrote last review, someone saw Elliot and Olivia eye-fucking each other in OC headquarters and passed that along.) And never forget – Wheatley knows Stabler is a “coffee snob” now. We learned that at OC headquarters.\n\nI’m starting to think that Angela Wheatley is the brains behind the entire criminal enterprise. Richard is a useful figurehead. Maybe she’s “cooperating” with the cops in order to get Richard out of the way so she and her children can continue running it?\n\nSomething is not right about how this bust went down. Wheatley went too easily. I still think him ending up in jail is part of the plan and I STILL believe the oloid was a message between Angela and Richard…maybe a message to enact whatever plan Wheatley has been playing out.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nThe shot of Stabler in the shower in the beginning where he’s breathing heavy…was that a post-orgasm shot? (It’s right next to the shot of Wheatley finishing.) If it was, no shame from my end – masturbation is natural and healthy and no one should feel bad for doing it.\n\nRichard Wheatley has his own proprietary cryptocurrency. Of course he does. What a douche.\n\nDylan McDermott turns the Campy Villain Energy up to an 11 in the last scene and I am so here for it. He & his suit are tied for MVP of the episode.\n\nChris Meloni in this v neck shirt…he is so fucking hot in this episode it should be illegal.\n\nCan we start a petition to get Chris Meloni and Danielle Moné Truitt to stand like this once an episode?\n\nChange the theme song of the show to “Booty” by JLo just for these two. God bless ’em."
