        "text": "No.5 is the fifth album released by Morning Musume. It was a success, scoring #1 on the charts and selling over 175,000, which was a decline from their previous one.\n\nReleased: March 26, 2003\n\n1. Intro\n\n2. Do It! Now\n\n3. TOP!\n\n4. Tomodachi ga Ki ni Itteru Otoko Kara no Dengon (友達(♀)が気に入っている男からの伝言; A Message from the Boy My Friend Likes)\n\n5. Koko ni Iruzee! (ここにいるぜぇ!; I’m Here!)\n\n6. “Suggoi Nakkama” (「すっごい仲間」; “Great Friends”)\n\n7. Tsuyoki de Yukouze! (強気で行こうぜ!; Let’s Go Strongly!)\n\n8. Megami ~Mousse na Yasashisa~ (Original Long Ver.) (女神 ~Mousseな優しさ~ (Original Long Ver.); Goddess ~Kindness Like Mousse~)\n\n9. YES! POCKY GIRLS (Original Long Ver.)\n\n10. HEY! Mirai (HEY! 未来; Hey! Future)\n\n11. Ganbacchae! (がんばっちゃえ!; Do Your Best!)\n\n12. “Sugoku Suki na no ni…ne” (「すごく好きなのに…ね」; “Even Though I Really Like You…”)\n\n13. Sotsugyou Ryokou ~Morning Musume Tabidatsu Hito ni Okuru Uta~ (卒業旅行 ~モーニング娘。旅立つ人に贈る唄~; Graduation Trip ~A Song for the Person Leaving Morning Musume~)\n\nThe album’s Intro is pretty much a short part of the next track, Do it! Now (#3 / 310,000). It flows seamlessly into this track, which is a bit of a departure from the group’s usual singles. The song takes some stronger R&B elements, which is an interesting change but it also includes the group’s signature elements such as the sparkly synths, awkward background vocals and over-the-top vocal delivery. I really like this song though. The verses are laid back, but the music still feels fleshed out, whereas the chorus hits hard with its melody and hooks.\n\nTOP! is weird. It opens with an almost alien-like intro before going on with a strange electronic, sci-fi edge. It’s a fun idea at least, but I feel like the song’s overall delivery just doesn’t work very well. The verses are average at best and the chorus falls flat. The hooks don’t take advantage of the song’s strange arrangement, which causes the melody and music to have a disconnect.\n\nI think Tomodachi ga Ki ni Itteru Otoko Kara no Dengon sounds like your usual Momusu styled album track. It has a bright energy to it, but goes for a mid-tempo pacing. It’s a departure from the last two songs as it doesn’t quite have the same intensity. This one is certainly better than the last track, but it just doesn’t quite have anything that stands out. Its country-esque edge does feel sweet, but the melody could hit harder.\n\nThe album’s second single comes in the form of Koko ni Iruzee! (#1 / 228,000), which is essentially an over-the-top, fun song with some ska influences. I usually like ska and this one has a lot of fun energy to it, but it isn’t a favourite of mine from the group. Actually, it sounds more like the group’s album material because it doesn’t come off particularly polished. The melody just feels a bit all over the place, although I do find the music’s energy to be intoxicating.\n\nI do like that the album is committing to this over-the-top child sound. “Suggoi Nakkama” switches the ska backing for something a bit more beachy. Unfortunately, it is plagued by the same issues I’ve felt with the other songs. It just doesn’t have a strong enough melody to really work with its strange and interesting background.\n\nTsuyoki de Yukouze! opens up sounding like it will go into full metal territory and it certainly has a lot of power and energy to it. Unfortunately, the verses are fast-paced and have no semblance of melody, so they come off a bit lackluster. There isn’t really much of a chorus to this song, but what little there is isn’t really flattering either. This song is just too noisy for me.\n\nMorning Musume hasn’t really sung too many ballads, especially after their explosive popularity with “LOVE Machine”, but Megami ~Mousse na Yasashisa~ (Original Long Ver.) is probably the closest thing to a ballad we have at the moment. The song feels more polished than the last song as the melody works nicely with its laid back arrangement. The verses don’t really do much for me and are a bore, but the chorus has a bit more energy to its arrangement that helps it bring the chorus up. I wish it had more power to it though.\n\nThankfully after that dull song, we get YES! POCKY GIRLS (Original Long Ver.). It’s your usual Momusu tracks and brings nothing new, but the song is at least better than the last song. The verses are surprisingly solid as they have a playful energy to them. The chorus falls a bit flatter, but it isn’t terrible either. Decent enough.\n\nHEY! Mirai pretty much continues the album’s fun-loving and upbeat attitude, but goes for a bit of a retro 60’s vibe. The song sounds as though it has a lot of potential and it does have some decent verses. Unfortunately, I find the chorus is be pretty forgettable.\n\nI do like Ganbacchae!, although I don’t find it particularly stellar. The song isn’t as in-your-face as the last two songs, but it does have a full sounding arrangement due in part to its brass backing. Still, it is another song that feels let down by its chorus. The melody just doesn’t have strong enough hooks and it feels a bit lacking in comparison to its flashy music.\n\nI’m not really sure what “Sugoku Suki na no ni…ne” is trying to go for. At this point, it just feels like a retread of the same usual sound from the group, but without anything particularly interesting. The melody is bland and is only held up by its interesting arrangement, but even that’s not enough.\n\nThe album ends with a graduation tune, Sotsugyou Ryokou ~Morning Musume Tabidatsu Hito ni Okuru Uta~. I was expecting something a bit more ballad-like, but it is nice to get a more energized pop track as it does have a nostalgic quality to it. Luckily, this is one of the better album tracks because it has a great arrangement and a decent enough melody. It fits the sound of the album, but it doesn’t overdo it and thankfully the hooks are catchy enough so it doesn’t get boring.\n\nOverall: This is my least favourite album from the group currently. I think the biggest problem compared to their first four was that it lacked strong tracks to offset the weaker ones. There were only two singles this time around and I only really enjoyed one of them. There was one good album track and a few decent ones, but there were also some that were either not very appealing or lackluster. I think the largest issue was that by the end, everything just sounded redundant and boring despite this being a largely upbeat album.\n\nC+\n\nSWEET BLACK is the first mini-album released by Goto Maki and her first release under rhythm zone. It was released under the name SWEET BLACK feat. MAKI GOTO. The mini proved to be her lowest selling release, peaking at #26 and selling over 7,000 copies.\n\nReleased: September 16, 2009\n\n1. Queen Bee\n\n2. Lady-Rise\n\n3. Candy\n\n4. TEAR DROPS\n\n5. Mine\n\n6. Fly Away\n\n7. Plastic Lover\n\n8. with…\n\nQueen Bee opens things up on an energetic note with its thumping beat and flashy synths. It feels like a nice continuation of the dance music she was starting to make at H!P for her last album. The verses are solid, but they have the rapper BIGGA RAIJI who just goes a bit intense with his raps. It contrasts the song’s more laid back melody, which is decent enough but rather simple. It’s an interesting way to start off, but I wish things were fleshed out more.\n\nLady-Rise is way better. We get another dance track, but this one goes for a more sensual touch with the vocals and the music feels more attitude-infused. The verses are nice but I feel like the transition into the chorus doesn’t bring enough impact. The melody here is pretty catchy though and I like that it has more energy to it than in the verses. It’s a pretty solid tune and Goto sounds great.\n\nAnother stomping dance/pop track comes in the form of Candy. This one stands out by bringing a few more rock elements in its arrangement to give it a cooler edge. It doesn’t have quite the same catchiness in the melody as the last song does, but I think it makes up for it by sheer energy in its music. It’s pretty fun and the most aggressive of the songs up to this point.\n\nIt’s weird that we get into the album’s first ballad just suddenly after three dance tracks. TEAR DROPS goes for a style more fitting of the early and mid-00s and it reminds me of something Ayumi might do with its light synths. The song is also a duet and features singer KG. He actually doesn’t do all much singing compared to Goto and I feel like the song would have been better without him. The song has a pretty melody anyways.\n\nBack to the upbeat sounds, we get something a bit more R&B and electronic with Mine. I think the music is pretty interesting sounding with its weird beat and fuzzy synths, which is a little of an odd combination when tied with the slithering synths. It’s another solid song, although I do wish the chorus pushed harder with the energy.\n\nFly away is easily my favourite song on the album and it has been one of my favourites from Goto since it first got released. The song is another commanding dance/pop track, but it features the most fleshed out sound. The verses are hard-hitting, while the pre-chorus soften things up in falsetto. The chorus is a bit more dragged out in its lines, but it brings a bit of a dreamier vibe. The music and vocals give a sense of polish compared to the other songs.\n\nThe most dance-focused song comes crashing in next. Plastic Lover starts in a funky way before building its energy. The verses have some cool vocal editing to bring some colour. The chorus goes full on with the sparkling synths and fun beat. The melody isn’t half bad either and helps to create a pretty hypnotic experience.\n\nEnding things off on a softer note, with… is a laid back mid-tempo pop song with a light acoustic arrangement. It’s definitely a song that doesn’t quite fit with the rest of the songs on here because it forgoes more electronic sounds for something more organic. Unfortunately, it’s not very great either. It’s nice, but the song doesn’t have a strong chorus to really stand out among the mini’s more aggressive songs.\n\nOverall: This mini shows that Goto needed a change in her sound and company to really get things rolling. It’s her strongest release yet and her most consistent. While I wasn’t a big fan of the last song, the other tracks were all pretty decent and had their charms. I do wish she laid it a bit harder on the melodies for some of them though because even if the arrangements were energetic and fun, the hooks didn’t sink in as well.\n\nA-\n\n4th “Ikimasshoi!” is the fourth album released by Morning Musume. It’s the first studio album by the group to feature the fourth and fifth generations and it includes some of the group’s most well-known hits. The album was a #1 hit and sold 515,000 copies. Four singles were released before the album, with three being #1 hits on the singles chart.\n\nReleased: March 27, 2002\n\n1. The☆Pea~ce! (Complete Version) (ザ☆ピ~ス! (Complete Version))\n\n2. Ii Koto Aru Kinen no Shunkan (いいことある記念の瞬間; The Moment I Remember When Something Good Happened)\n\n3. Mr. Moonlight ~Ai no Big Band~ (Long Version) (Mr.Moonlight ~愛のビッグバンド~; Mr. Moonlight ~Love’s Big Band~)\n\n4. Hajimete no Rock Concert (初めてのロックコンサート; My First Rock Concert)\n\n5. Otoko Tomodachi (男友達; Boy Friend)\n\n6. Souda! WE’RE ALIVE (そうだ! We’re ALIVE; That’s Right! We’re Alive)\n\n7. Dekkai Uchuu ni Ai ga Aru (Album Version) (でっかい宇宙に愛がある (Album Version); There’s Love in This Great Big World)\n\n8. Ikimasshoi! (いきまっしょい!; Let’s Go!)\n\n9. Densha no Futari (電車の二人; The Two in the Train)\n\n10. Honki de Atsui Theme Song (本気で熱いテーマソング; The Seriously Passionate Theme Song)\n\n11. Suki na Senpai (好きな先輩; My Senior Crush)\n\n12. Renai Revolution 21 (13nin Version) (恋愛レボリューション21 (13人 Version); Love Revolution 21 (13-person Version))\n\n13. Nanni mo Iwazu ni I LOVE YOU (なんにも言わずにI LOVE YOU; Without Saying a Word, I Love You)\n\nOpening things with one of the album’s highlights is its second single, The☆Pea~ce! (Complete Version) (#1 / 682,000). This is one of the group’s most recognizable tracks. It follows the bright, insane energy that the group had become known for after “LOVE Machine” and it takes a lot of pointers from that one with its disco influences. The melody isn’t as infectiously catchy, but there are some great melodic moments and the general energy of the brass heavy chorus tied with squiggly synths keeps the vibe going. It’s totally fun.\n\nIi Koto Aru Kinen no Shunkan is the kind of song you skip over at first, but it has a way of worming its way into your mind when you listen to it closely. I do like that it has a bit of a retro edge and the music gives me some Motown stylings with its falsetto-based background vocals. The chorus is the song’s best part. Even if it isn’t terribly catchy, it’s general vibe is quite fun.\n\nThe album’s third single comes crashing in next. Mr. Moonlight ~Ai no Big Band~ (Long Version) (#1 / 513,000) continues the album’s bright and chipper energy with its big band sound. Like the title says too, this is clocking in at almost seven minutes as it includes a long spoken intro. The song also became known for having some of Momusu’s members cosplaying as men. It works here, even if the song isn’t generally to my tastes. The song’s effortless brass backing is really what carries things. I find myself dancing to the over-the-top verses before things get into the swinging chorus, but it’s that second-half where the song really hits its melodic height and it’s softer edge does well to contrast the power of the verses’ vocal performances. It’s a fun song altogether.\n\nWith a title like Hajimete no Rock Concert, I was expecting something a bit more….rock n’ roll. Instead, we get this intense 00’s R&B inspired track. It’s a bit of a change, but I’m not totally against it. I just feel like it doesn’t quite fit at this point. I do like parts of the song, like its climbing pre-chorus. The chorus isn’t bad and the melody is quite soft, but I wish it pushed things a little harder to fit with the dramatic arrangement.\n\nWe actually get a pop/rock tune for the next track. Otoko Tomodachi feels a bit more reminiscent of the material off the group’s first album. Maybe it’s partly because it focuses just on Abe Natsumi. It’s not a bad song, but just not particularly noteworthy either. I do like some of the breezier elements of the arrangement, but I feel like the song would have been better if it was slower.\n\nFinally getting back to the singles, we get Souda! WE’RE ALIVE (#1 / 433,000), a funky upbeat tune that continues the positive, crazy sound expected from the group’s A-sides at this point. What sets this one apart is its chorus. While the verses are energetic and full of over-the-top energy, things settle down a bit for its chant-like chorus. Much like “Mr.Moonlight”, this one’s best moment comes in the chorus’ second half as its more melodic piece takes over. It’s a bit of a crazy song, but still fun.\n\nDekkai Uchuu ni Ai ga Aru (Album Version) was the only B-side included on the album. It’s sung in unison, which is a nice change and its positive energy gives me some church-like vibes. It’s a cute tune, but feels like it should have been placed right at the end of the album.\n\nThe album’s title track really lives up to its title. Ikimasshoi! is a fast-paced, energy-packed pop tune. It’s the first song that really has some stronger dance elements in its arrangement. It’s not a bad track and I like the energy it brings, even if it feels like something is missing that keeps it from feeling more fleshed out.\n\nI was expecting a ballad with the title being Densha no Futari, but instead we get a strange, almost Middle-Eastern vibing tune. I call it strange because everything never quite fits well together and the song changes things up in an odd way. I do like the pace of the song, but the vocals just don’t quite mesh well with the music.\n\nGetting back to the positive and bright energy with brass support is Honki de Atsui Theme Song. It really just feels like a toned down version of “The Pea~ce!” with its stomping beat and disco-inspired synths. Luckily, the chorus helps to save things. It’s melody is actually really catchy and works perfectly with the explosive energy of the music. It’s a solid tune, even though it is a tad too long.\n\nI want to like Suki na Senpai a little more because the pace of the song is quite nice and I like it’s country-esque pop/rock arrangement. Unfortunately, it also feels like it was taken from the group’s first or second album, so it comes off a bit unsuited for the vibe of the album. The melody also isn’t particularly memorable.\n\nOne of the group’s biggest hits comes next and it’s easily one of my favourites from the group. Renai Revolution 21 (13nin Version) (#2 / 986,000) brings back the retro vibe with its disco energy, but it feels like peak Momusu. The verses are the parts that give a bit more of the members’ personalities before sliding into the build-up of the pre-chorus. Even though it’s repetitive, it works really great for hyping the energy as the chorus comes exploding in with its addictive melody and disco arrangement. It’s perfectly Morning Musume.\n\nThe album’s only ballad comes in to end things off. I do like that Nanni mo Iwazu ni I LOVE YOU doesn’t do things simply and has a big, full and fleshed out arrangement that fits with the vibe of the rest of the album. Unfortunately, it comes off a bit forgettable in the long run. The melody is sweet, but it just doesn’t quite have the right hooks to grab my attention for long.\n\nOverall: This was a decent album. It follows the same problem as their 3rd album, which was that the singles just dominated everything and the album tracks failed to really capture my attention. There was a lot of ups and downs. However, at least the singles were a really strong set this time and I did enjoy the fact that the album felt more in tune with the group’s bright and positive energy at the time.\n\nB\n\nHow to use SEXY is the fourth album released by Goto Maki. The album was released after three singles, which showcased a change in image with Goto going for a sexier look. All three singles charted within the top ten. The album wasn’t as successful though, peaking at #18 and selling only around 14,000 copies.\n\nReleased: September 19, 2007\n\n1. How to use Loneliness\n\n2. GIVE ME LOVE\n\n3. SOME BOYS! TOUCH\n\n4. City Wind\n\n5. Nee Samishikute (ねえ 寂しくて; Hey I’m Lonely)\n\n6. Glass no Pumps (ガラスのパンプス; Glass Pumps)\n\n7. DAYBREAK\n\n8. WOW Suteki! (WOW 素敵!; Wow Amazing!)\n\n9. Secret (シークレット)\n\n10. Life\n\nA departure from Goto’s usual material, How to use Loneliness is pop but has a more intense arrangement with its light Middle Eastern influences and heavy percussion. The song actually reminds me of her debut single, but some areas are changed. Goto’s vocals are darker and match the power of the song and the music lets her bring some more sultry vocals out. The song itself isn’t bad. The verses aren’t very memorable, but the chorus is much better and despite the odd match of music and melody, it’s relatively catchy.\n\nI think I prefer GIVE ME LOVE. It continues the upbeat trend but trades the heavy beat for something lighter and almost jazzy. The verses are fun and keep the energy going, while the chorus just heightens it by hitting it with a strong hook. I do wish the melody was a little more predictable here because it would work nicely with the exciting arrangement, but it’s still pretty catchy and fun.\n\nThe album’s first single comes in the form of SOME BOYS! TOUCH (#5 / 29,000). This is where Goto’s overtly sexual image really sprouted. The verses match this image change by bringing in a thumping beat with some airy, sensual vocals. It’s a fun combination even if the sexiness is a bit overdone. The chorus is a total head turner though, we get flown into a bright melody that contrasts the verses. I’m not a huge fan of this huge changes, but I’ve really grown to enjoy it because the melody is still quite strong. It’s just a fun song.\n\nWe finally slow down a little with City Wind, which is a mid-tempo pop tune. It continues a more sensual tone with its airy vocals, but the song takes on a jazzier style. It’s a really nice change. I’m a bit weirded out by how odd the arrangement is because there are some odd synths included, but the general vibe of the song is nice.\n\nNee Samishikute follows it up which keeps the more mid-tempo pace. This one is a little lighter in its arrangement and focuses more on the piano. It has some R&B elements to help it stand out a bit. Unfortunately, while the arrangement is interesting, the melody just doesn’t pack a punch. It’s just a so-so track.\n\nLuckily the album’s strongest song comes crawling in. Glass no Pumps (#7 / 27,000) was the album’s first single and is a fun transition from her brighter pop oriented sound to something a bit sexier. The arrangement is funky and has some disco influences to it that recall the sounds of “Daite yo! Please Go On!”, but it doesn’t quite go as powerful. Instead, the song has an eerie quality to its arrangement due to its synths that helps propel that straight shooting melody. It’s just an insanely catchy song.\n\nDAYBREAK slows things down with a jazzy pop tune. It’s feeling is similar to “City Wind”, but we really up the jazz elements with the added brass and guitar. I enjoy its fuller arrangement, but my issue comes with the vocals. It’s a sensual tune, but Goto sounds too airy and it doesn’t lend itself well to flashy music. It’s a nice tune, but could use a bit more energy in its delivery.\n\nI wasn’t sure how WOW! Suteki would sound like based on the intro because it goes for a happy and summery kind of style. I do like that it tries to bring a bit of variety on the album, but it sort of sticks out like a sore thumb. The transition into the chorus is especially jarring because it just goes with this overdone bright melody that doesn’t quite hit the right spots. It’s the song most like her previous singles.\n\nThe album’s first ballad and last single comes rolling in. Secret (#9 / 14,000) is a gentle piano ballad that is reminiscent of some of Goto’s past singles, although we get a bit of an R&B beat to set it apart. The verses are rather dull, but I’ve actually grown to enjoy the chorus. The melody is dragged out a bit and is supported by its vibrant arrangement of strings and synths. She’s had better ballads, but it’s a decent tune.\n\nLIFE finishes the album on a slow note. It’s a bit different from the last ballad because it doesn’t quite have the same kind of energy. Replacing the R&B beats and wonky synths, we get something a bit more orchestral. It’s a nice change, but I’m not really loving this song. Its slow burner kind of sound actually makes me get tired. It’s not particularly exciting and feels too long.\n\nOverall: This is yet another improvement from Goto Maki and is her best album yet. The album is more consistent in quality and there weren’t any weak songs. Quite a few were average and just lacked strong melodies or had questionable arrangements, but there were some great tunes to even them out. Unfortunately, the album is stronger in its first half than second.\n\nB\n\nDreams is the third album released by Abe Natsumi. The album included a second disc that included live versions from one of her concerts.\n\nReleased: June 17, 2015\n\n1. Kaze wo Kanjite (風を感じて; Feel the Wind)\n\n2. Poincaré (ポアンカレ)\n\n3. beautiful (2015 Dreams ver.)\n\n4. Onegai (お願い; Please)\n\n5. Usotsuki (嘘つき; Liar)\n\n6. Suki de × 5 (2015 Dreams ver.) (好きで×5; I Love You × 5)\n\n7. Lady Greedy\n\n8. Anata Iro (2015 Dreams ver.) (あなた色; Your Color)\n\n9. Summer Breeze\n\n10. Kokoro no Tomo (心の友; Soulmate)\n\n11. Anata ni Aetanara (2015 Dreams ver.) (あなたに会えたなら; If Only I Could Have Met You)\n\nThe album opens with the country-inspired Kaze wo Kanjite. It was used as the promoted track and has a great cross-country vibe to it. I like its light and summery pop/rock sound and it works nicely with Abe’s matured vocals. It’s not particularly catchy, but it’s more midtempo vibe definitely brings a more emotional twist.\n\nPoincaré keeps up this country-vibe, although it doesn’t quite hit the same high points that the last song did. It is definitely a little more upbeat and it helps to bring some needed energy to things, but the melody isn’t particularly memorable and the music is a bit too empty so it doesn’t have a lot of impact. It’s a solid filler though.\n\nI’m not really sure where the original version of beautiful comes from, but beautiful (2015 Dreams ver.) is a sweeping pop ballad. It’s not very interesting though and I actually find it lulls me to sleep. The arrangement doesn’t stand out, although there are some nice moments in the chorus when it comes to the melody.\n\nOnegai comes in right after and it’s actually a cover of an Angela Aki song. I don’t know what’s up with this cover, but it tries to go for a dreamier kind of sound by using an acoustic guitar instead of piano and some weird vocal editing. I actually think the original is absolutely beautiful, but this version is pretty lacking. Instead of being an emotional tune, it just puts me to sleep.\n\nUsotsuki is another country-esque pop tune and keeps up the slower vibe. At this point, things have just been boring me and this is yet another song that doesn’t quite stand out. The chorus melody is rather nice, but there is just something lacking about the whole delivery. I think part of it is that I can’t really hear Abe’s emotional attachment to it.\n\nI’m so thankful to get Suki de × 5 (2015 Dreams ver.). This song was originally found on Morning Musume’s second album and this version doesn’t really change too much of the foundation of the song. It’s a jazzier number that works really nicely with Abe’s voice and the extra punch of the music really helps it to lift this boring album. I do wish the arrangement in the chorus was a bit stronger, but it’s at least something different.\n\nLady Greedy keeps up the change in sound with a latin spin on things. I really wasn’t expecting something like this, but it is a nice change. I like that it focuses on that sensual guitar, but I wish there was a fuller composition. It always feels like there can be more energy and more power to the music to really help the melody stand out. Still a decent tune.\n\nAnata Iro was one of my favourite songs from Abe’s first album and the 2015 Dreams ver. just heightens things even more. While the song continues the latin swing of things that the original had, it makes a more mature take on things. The dance beats are replaced by an arrangement that comes off more ska-like and I love its more organic vibe. Easily the album’s highlight.\n\nI’m happy that Summer Breeze keeps up the upbeat pace with its jazzy-pop vibes. The arrangement is pretty great with its blast of brass and light guitar. The chorus is also quite nice to listen to as the melody has some decent hooks. The song comes off a little more old school and feels like something heard from the 90s.\n\nKokoro no Tomo slows things down to deliver us a gentle acoustic midtempo tune. While the verses are quite slow and boring, the pace picks up a bit for the chorus. The melody is also rather charming. It isn’t the most exciting song, but it is for sure better than some of the earlier slower tunes. This is also a cover of an Itsuwa Mayumi song.\n\nThe album ends with a slower tune originally released from Abe’s best album. Anata ni Aetanara (2015 Dreams ver.) is a calm midtempo ballad with some light reggae influences. It’s a weird combination, but at least it keeps things interesting. Like the last song, it isn’t that interesting in its overall execution, but I do like the arrangement.\n\nOverall: This album was really surprising. The first half of the album was really making me think this will be one of the most boring albums that I have ever listened to. Its more country-esque sounds are nice, but didn’t stand out. Luckily, the second half tries to change things up and we get a larger variety of sounds. This still isn’t a particularly strong album and I feel like the production is a large part of its lackluster delivery.\n\nC+\n\n3rd -Love Paradise- is the third album released by Morning Musume. It is their first release to include member, Goto Maki, who helped propel the group into stardom with their juggernaut hit, “LOVE Machine”. The album proved to be a great success, peaking at #2 and selling over 863,000 copies. The album includes two singles, both of which were incredibly successful with each selling well over one million copies.\n\nReleased: March 29, 2000\n\n1. ~Ohayou~ (~おはよう~; ~Good Morning~)\n\n2. LOVE Machine (LOVEマシーン)\n\n3. Aisha Loan de (愛車 ローンで; A Beloved Car on Loan)\n\n4. Kuchizuke no Sono Ato (くちづけのその後; Right After the Kiss)\n\n5. Koi no Dance Site (恋のダンスサイト; Love’s Dance Site)\n\n6. Lunchtime ~Rebanira Itame~ (ランチタイム ~レバニラ炒め~; Lunchtime ~Liver Leek Stir-Fry~)\n\n7. DANCE Suru no da! (DANCEするのだ!; Dance!)\n\n8. Omoide (おもいで; Memories)\n\n9. Harajuku 6:00 Shuugou (原宿6:00集合; Meeting at Harajuku at 6:00)\n\n10. WHY\n\n11. “…Suki da yo!” (「、、、好きだよ!」; “…I Love You!”)\n\n12. ~Oyasumi~ (~おやすみ~; ~Good Night~)\n\n~Ohayou~ is an interesting way to start things off. It is like an intro/short song, with it only clocking in at around two minutes. It starts off really nicely with the light strings and almost orchestral quality. It doesn’t feature any singing, but just has the girls talking.\n\nIt oddly transitions into LOVE Machine (#1 / 1,646,000), the groups most well-known hit. LOVE Machine is a contrast to the more serious tone that the group’s earlier music was known for. I love how the song is just a lot of fun. The funky music with the crazy synths and over-the-top vocals just work together so nicely and it brings a catchy breath of fresh air. There are still some great melodic parts, like the pre-chorus, which is still my favourite part of the song. The song is just full of hooks.\n\nI’m not sure about Aisha Loan de. It goes to the lighter pop/rock and I just find it totally lacking compared to the last song. This feels like it would fit better on the group’s first album. It’s not a bad song, but the verses are just poorly produced. The chorus is definitely stronger, but it’s just not that memorable. A bit of a disappointment.\n\nKuchizuke no Sono Ato continues that pop/rock vibe and I just don’t know what’s going on. I was expecting some more catchy and fun pop songs, but instead we get these serious and rather forgettable songs. This one is definitely better than the last song and I find it has a certain charm to it, but it’s not particularly impressive either. I like that it feels more focused and the production is stronger. This version is also way better than Goto’s solo one.\n\nI’m so thankful we get into the next single. Koi no Dance Site (#2 / 1,229,000) pretty much doubles down on the over-the-top silliness that was found in “LOVE Machine”. I feel like this is the clear point where the group really took on this role for better or worse. It has a stronger influence that seems almost ancient Egyptian. It’s a bit weird to be honest. I feel like the chorus is a bit lacking and doesn’t quite hit the same energy of the powerful music. Likewise, I feel some of the backing vocals were just a bit too much. It’s still pretty catchy though.\n\nLunchtime ~Rebanira Itame~ is so weird. This isn’t really a song itself either, but is just a long sounding commentary. It’s actually a bit disappointing because the sexier R&B sound that plays is actually pretty wicked and would’ve been a welcomed entry. Instead, we get another unnecessary track.\n\nAt least with DANCE Suru no da! we get back into the fun pop sound. Here, we go with a lighter pop song that brings some funk and disco into it. I quite like the energy of the music and while the melody isn’t particularly strong, it’s still a pretty solid tune overall. I feel like this is the kind of music I was expecting to hear more of from the album tracks. It’s just a bit too long for my liking.\n\nI really like Omoide. It has a more dramatic pop sound that brings in some late 90’s R&B elements and it takes a sexier swing. It’s a cool follow-up to the last song because it brings some contrast as it is a darker tune, but still brings some of that wicked bass into it. I do wish the chorus pushed things a little harder as the vocals come off a tad light, but this is a pretty nice tune.\n\nI was worried Harajuku 6:00 Shuugou was going to be another interlude type of song, but instead we get something more interesting. It starts off with a talking section, but soon switches things up to bring an almost explosive latin spin. It doesn’t seem as fluid as most latin songs, but the influence is clearly there in the brass and beat. However, this excitement all dies once the chorus comes in. It’s horribly boring, flat and kills all the momentum the music and the verses help to build.\n\nWHY opens in a weird way with rapping. It’s a weird change, but the music is really great. The guitar is the focus here and brings a more organic feel. The verses are pretty lackluster though and sound more like a demo than the actual completed song. Things only start getting better for the pre-chorus. The chorus is pretty interesting and I do like that the song tries to change things up by having each member sing only a syllable instead of a line. It’s like a puzzle.\n\nI like that “…Suki da yo!” brings a more positive sound. However, there is one horrible problem with the production. The music is great, the singing is pretty nice, but there is a huge disconnect between the two. It sounds like the music is far in the distance and the girls are singing really close. It really ruined things for me because this song has so much potential.\n\nWe end things with ~Oyasumi~, which is another spoken track. As the outro, it’s a bit odd and I’m just not fond of the guy’s voice.\n\nOverall: This album was a bit of a disappointment for me. I was really expecting some great songs considering the singles were pretty fun and exciting, but most of the album tracks just ended up pretty flat sounding. I did like the experimentation in sound and there were many interesting aspects included in the songs, however, they just weren’t executed that well and there were some editing ideas that were just glaringly bad ideas.\n\nB-\n\n3rd Station is the third album released by Goto Maki. It was her first album to chart outside the top ten and it only sold 32,000 copies. The three singles were relatively successful, with all charting within the top ten, but they weren’t able to replicate the successes of her past singles.\n\nReleased: February 23, 2005\n\n1. Ekizo no DISCO (エキゾなDISCO; Exotic Disco)\n\n2. Sayonara “Tomodachi ni wa Naritakunai no” (さよなら「友達にはなりたくないの」; Goodbye “Don’t Want To Be Friends”)\n\n3. Yokohama Shinkirou (横浜蜃気楼; Yokohama Mirage)\n\n4. Singapore Transit (シンガポールトランシット)\n\n5. Rairai! “Shinfuu” (来来!「幸福」; Welcome! “Happiness”)\n\n6. Watarasebashi (渡良瀬橋; Watarase Bridge)\n\n7. Positive Genki! (ポジティブ元気!; Positive Energy!)\n\n8. Sayonara no LOVE SONG (サヨナラの LOVE SONG; Goodbye Love Song)\n\n9. Renai Sentai Shitsu Ranger (Goto Version) (恋愛戦隊シツレーンジャ (後藤Version); Love Squadron Ranger)\n\n10. Station (ステーション)\n\n11. 19sai no Hitorigoto (19歳のひとり言; The Monologue of a 19 Year Old)\n\nI wasn’t really expecting what I got with Ekizo no DISCO. This is much different from her past songs because it is much more in the sexy zone. The music is a bit crazy with its pounding beat, flying synths and breathy vocals. I feel like it would have been better if Goto didn’t sing it in this way though because it sort detracts from the melody and leaves a weird contrast between it and the heavy arrangement. It’s a fun opener, but not quite my cup of tea.\n\nThe transition into Sayonara “Tomodachi ni wa Naritakunai no” (#9 / 29,000) is a weird one as this one is one of her more mature and serious sounding songs. It’s definitely slower, but it isn’t quite in ballad territory and I love how nice her vocals sound here. The verses are particularly nice and there is a slow but strong build-up into the chorus, which definitely has more tension and emotion to it. It’s also quite catchy. Probably one of my favourite Goto songs and easily her best H!P single.\n\nYokohama Shinkirou (#8 / 31,000) is such a weird change with its pop/rock power. I’m not sure if I like this single that much, but I do like the energy that it has. There is a lot of strength in the arrangement with its mix of synths, guitar and percussion, but it is in the melody that things sort of lose its effect as it is quite repetitive and a bit out of control. It’s still a solid tune.\n\nSingapore Transit is yet another change in sound as here we are given something a bit lighthearted and sweeter. This mid-tempo pop tune starts off a little boring for me as the verses aren’t particularly memorable. However, the chorus is so much better. There is a bit of unpredictability in the melody and it helps to create a more interesting sound. It’s not that bad of a song.\n\nI was expecting Rairai! “Shinfuu” to be a crazy song and it is. Actually, I find it a bit odd that this song is included. It’s just really out there and sounds more like a song for a kids show and not something that would fit on here. Certainly Goto has done songs like this before, but not quite to this extent. It’s definitely a fun song and has a pretty catchy chorus, but the music just flashes by and there isn’t much to grasp on. Just a bit much for me.\n\nWatarasebashi is a cover of a song by Moritaka Chisato and was already covered by label-mate, Matsuura Aya. This is a pretty gentle ballad and it’s quite beautiful. I think Goto’s vocals match this song wonderfully and while the song doesn’t have the most interesting arrangement, the melody is actually pretty nice to listen to. Not her strongest ballad, but definitely a solid cover.\n\nPositive Genki! is probably my least favourite song on here. I’m fine with fun and upbeat pop/rock tunes, but the riffs here are just really tiring and they last throughout the entire song. It’s just overpowers the rest of the song. The chorus isn’t that catchy either and it can barely get through this song.\n\nThe album’s first single comes in the form of a classic love ballad. Sayonara no LOVE SONG (#5 / 35,000) used to be one of my favourite songs by Goto because I always felt it was quite beautiful. There are some really stunning parts to it, but I feel like it doesn’t quite hit the spot I want. There are some really charming parts to its arrangement like the light guitar and percussion. However, while the song is sweet, it just ends up a bit dull in general.\n\nRenai Sentai Shitsu Ranger (Goto Version) is a solo version of a song by sub-unit, Nochiura Natsumi, which featured Goto in it. This is an upbeat pop tune with some rock elements to it, but I don’t quite like this version. I used to like this song a lot, but this one is just lacking a bit. The music is just very noisy and the melody isn’t that catchy either. It is better sung as a sub-unit.\n\nThe title track, Station, is a really cool pop tune that I was waiting for. After a few lackluster songs, here we are given something more mature and a bit more dance-focused. I love the beat and I feel like it swirls around with the synths. This also feels like a better match for Goto’s voice. The song isn’t as catchy as I want it to be as the melody is a bit repetitive, but it works nicely with the powerful music.\n\n19sai no Hitorigoto ends things on a more dramatic and touching note. The song is a ballad, but it has a bit more power to it when compared to the other ballads on here. The arrangement is definitely pushed forward by the heavy percussion and I really like it. The melody gets a bit lost as Goto’s voice is a bit too soft for this kind of song, but it is still a nice tune.\n\nOverall: This album is a little stronger than her second one, so at least there is some sort of improvement. My biggest complaint with the album would probably the lack of focus there is. There were so many changes in style and sound between each track that it felt like there was no cohesion at all and was just a jumble of songs. This could be good if the songs were stronger, but here, quite a few were just lackluster and lacking in clear focus within the songs themselves.\n\nB-\n\n25 ~Vingt Cinq~ is the first mini-album released by Abe Natsumi. The title refers to the age she was when the mini was released. The mini failed to capture the success of her previous albums, with it peaking at #21 and selling around 13,000 copies. There were two singles released for the album, both peaking within the top ten of the charts and outselling the mini itself.\n\nReleased: March 14, 2007\n\n1. Itoshiki Hito (愛しき人; Beloved Person)\n\n2. Sweet Holic (スイートホリック)\n\n3. Otona e no Elevator (大人へのエレベーター; Elevator to Adulthood)\n\n4. 25 ~Vingt Cinq~ (25 〜ヴァンサンク〜)\n\n5. Kuchibiru de Tomete (くちびるで止めて; Stop at My Lips)\n\n6. Gesshoku no Hikari (月色の光; Moonlight)\n\n7. Amasugita Kajitsu (甘すぎた果実; Fruit that is Too Sweet)\n\nThe album opens on a positive note with Itoshiki Hito, which is a bubbly and bright pop song. Considering it is from 2007, it still feels a bit outdated sounding and ends up reminding of something from ZARD in the 1990’s. It’s not a bad song though and actually has a really nice and full arrangement that really works well with Abe’s vocals. I do find her voice is get a bit overpowered at times and I wish the chorus was a little more memorable, but it’s a solid opening.\n\nThe album’s first single is Sweet Holic (#8 / 17,000), which is another bright pop song. I wasn’t particularly interested in this song at first, but it actually has a really sweet and catchy chorus. The verses aren’t that great to me as they sort of just rumble along. I think some of the problem comes with the music that just sounds a bit awkward at times and a bit too programmed. Luckily, the chorus saves things.\n\nOtona e no Elevator is another uptempo pop song, but this time with a bit of an acoustic swing. I wasn’t expecting too much from this song, but it actually surprised me quite a bit. The verses aren’t that memorable, but the chorus has a great quality to it that makes me think of the countryside. My only problem would be that Abe’s vocals do sound a little thin here.\n\n25 ~Vingt Cinq~ is the album’s first slow song. It’s definitely not on the exciting side, but it isn’t bad. The chorus is sort of dragged out and I think the gentleness of the music really works wonderfully with Abe’s voice. She sings it quite beautifully. I just wish the music had a bit more power to it as it goes on because it keeps at the same level for its entirety and it feels like it will build to something bigger.\n\nKuchibiru de Tomete is a great surprise as it has some punch to it. It has a stronger latin vibe to it, which I was not expecting. I find the verses to be a lot of fun, but I did wish the chorus was a little better. It’s catchy, but it brings some synths in that sort of take the song into a stronger “pop” category and it loses its edge. Still a nice tune though.\n\nAnother ballad comes in with Gesshoku no Hikari, but this time we get something with a bit of traditional Japanese spice. This is easily one of Abe’s best songs in her whole discography. The music is absolutely gorgeous and works wonderfully to catapult the melody in the chorus. The verses are also surprisingly solid and help to bring a nice contrast to the fuller chorus. Stunning.\n\nThe album’s second single comes sliding in right at the end and it’s one of her best songs. Amasugita Kajitsu (#5 / 22,000) takes the latin sound of “Kuchibiru de Tomete” and amps it up by ten. It has a sensual quality to it that isn’t really seen in most of Abe’s music. The chorus sort of zooms by with its fast-paced melody and hooks, but it still leaves a strong impact. It’s exciting and catchy. I love it.\n\nOverall: This was a huge surprise for me. Considering Abe’s first two albums were quite weak and featured decent singles but lackluster album tracks, I was really surprised by the quality of the album tracks here. The singles were still strong, especially the second one, but I ended up loving one of the songs and really enjoying many others. There are no weak songs on this mini.\n\nA\n\nSecond Morning is the second album released by Morning Musume and the last to feature first generation member, Fukuda Asuka. The album proved to be more successful than their first due to the rising popularity of the group’s singles. All four of the singles were top five hits, with one peaking at number one. The album sold over 425,000 copies and peaked at #3.\n\nReleased: July 28, 1999\n\n1. NIGHT OF TOKYO CITY\n\n2. Manatsu no Kounen (真夏の光線 (Vacation Mix); A Ray of Light in Midsummer)\n\n3. Memory Seishun no Hikari (Memory青春の光; Memory The Light of Youth)\n\n4. Suki x5 (好きで×5; I Love You ×5)\n\n5. Furusato (ふるさと; Hometown)\n\n6. Daite HOLD ON ME! (N.Y. Mix) (抱いてHOLD ON ME!; Hold Me, Hold On Me!)\n\n7. Papa ni Niteiru Kare (パパに似ている彼; He Who Looks Like Papa)\n\n8. Senkou Hanabi (せんこう花火; Sparklers)\n\n9. Koi no Shihatsu Ressha (Album Version) (恋の始発列車; Love’s First Train)\n\n10. Otome no Shinrigaku (乙女の心理学; A Girl’s Psychology)\n\n11. Never Forget (Large Vocal Mix)\n\n12. Da Di Du De Do Da Di! (ダディドゥデドダディ！)\n\nI wasn’t expecting to be blast into the album right away, but NIGHT OF TOKYO CITY is an exciting start. It’s a funky upbeat pop tune that opens with a barrage of synths and rapping. Once the song starts getting into the verses do things really start picking up though. The song has a more mature vibe to it and while I wish the chorus was a bit catchier, it’s a solid tune and easily encapsulates their sound at this time.\n\nI find the transition into Manatsu no Kounen (Vacation Mix) (#3 / 235,000) a little odd just because it is a summer-y pop tune that is very different from the last tune. I didn’t really like this song before, but it has grown on me a lot. I do find the melody to a bit dragged out and doesn’t equal the punch of the fuller instrumental. It’s still a surprisingly catchy song though and it isn’t a surprise that it was the album’s third single.\n\nI feel like Memory Seishun no Hikari (#2 / 410,000) should have been after the first song because it is darker. The album’s second single is a dark and seductive pop tune with some new jack swing and R&B influences. I love the underlying bass mixed with the piano and the girls’ harmonies easily make the song a gorgeous vocal display. The chorus is especially nice and the catchy melody ties nicely with these harmonies. This is also one of the last instances of Fukuda’s lead singing.\n\nI do like that Suki x5 tries to change things up as the jazzier vibe of the song really brings a switch that isn’t really heard by the group. Unfortunately, I just don’t find the melody to sit nicely with the music and it just awkwardly floats on top of the overpowering percussion. This is one of the weaker songs for me.\n\nFurusato (#5 / 170,000) is one of Morning Musume’s most well-known songs as it is the group’s first ballad single. It’s a really beautiful song that talks about living in a new city and the hardships of love and homesickness. My only problem with the song is that it is like an Abe Natsumi song. While I do like her and she has a nice voice, it would have been nice to get the other girls to sing as well to bring some contrast. I love the music though and the oldschool synth-line is a bit outdated sounding, but nostalgic.\n\nDaite HOLD ON ME! (N.Y. Mix) (#1 / 497,000) is the remix of the album’s first single, which just adds a faster dance beat underneath. It really helps the song keep up the energy and I think I like it more than the original. This song is easily the best one of the album. The chorus is more repetitive, but the hooks are really catchy and the contrast between the two parts really brings an urgency to the song. There is even a fun rap that comes in. All of this is on top of a pulsating beat and with an array of disco synths.\n\nI feel like this is where “Manatsu no Kounen” should have come in as Papa ni Niteiru Kare is an even brighter pop song. It has a funky guitar riff that carries throughout the song with a touch of brass here and there. I think the song isn’t bad, but the chorus is just a bit disappointing as the music is upbeat while the melody is darker. It’s an interesting difference, but it would have been better to really play up the music’s energy.\n\nSenkou Hanabi is a really nice change music wise as it has a pop/rock vibe to it. The guitar riff is really beautiful. Unfortunately, I find the singing parts to be a bit lackluster. The song is another instance of only Abe Natsumi singing and her voice just sounds weak throughout it. It would have been better to hear the other stronger vocalists get some parts to even out the weaker parts.\n\nKoi no Shihatsu Ressha (Album Version) was original released as the B-side from the album’s third single. It is a bit on the slower side of the things. The music sounds really outdated to me and it reminds me a lot of J-Pop from the 90’s. Unfortunately, the song itself is a bit forgettable as the melody isn’t that catchy.\n\nOtome no Shinrigaku is the album’s weird song with its beach-like vibe. I do like this old-school vibe to it and it does it in a way that doesn’t feel totally stuck in an era. I just wish the music was a little stronger as the chorus feels a bit weaker with how the vocals are edited. It’s a decent take and Yaguchi and Ichii do a good job taking the lead here.\n\nNever Forget (Large Vocal Mix) was originally released on the album’s second single as a graduation song for Fukuda Asuka. This song has a midtempo pop/rock sound going for it, which has been a bit of a theme with the last few tracks. I know the song is important, but I just don’t find the song that memorable. The chorus is nice, but it just needs a more powerful vocalist to get over the fullness of the music. Fukuda had great vocals, but they are a bit too sweet here.\n\nDa Di Du De Do Da Di! ends the album with something a bit more upbeat. It reminds me of 90’s music from female singer-songwriters in America as it has a stronger pop/rock vibe. Abe takes the lead here and she does a decent job. The song is pretty catchy, but the melody is a bit unpredictable. I’m not sure if I like it as much as I want to as it just doesn’t get stuck in my head and the song is just too long.\n\nOverall: This album has some stellar singles and there are some of Morning Musume’s best singles on this, but I felt quite a few of the album tracks were just not that interesting. A lot of them were midtempo tunes that just didn’t have interesting melodies nor that strong of production. I feel like there was more inconsistency here compared to the group’s debut.\n\nB\n\n2 Paint It Gold is the second album released by Goto Maki. While the album peaked at number four, the album only sold half the amount of her first with 52,000 copies sold. The album included four singles which were released before the album and were all top ten hits.\n\nReleased: January 28, 2004\n\n1. Uwasa no SEXY GUY (うわさのSEXY GUY; Rumored Sexy Guy)\n\n2. Genshoku GAL Hade ni Yukube! (原色GAL 派手に行くべ！; Primary Color Gal, Be Flashy!)\n\n3. LOVE. BELIEVE IT!\n\n4. Daite yo! PLEASE GO ON (抱いてよ！ PLEASE GO ON)\n\n5. Shiawase Desu ka (Goto version) (幸せですか？; Are You Happy?)\n\n6. Namida no Hoshi (涙の星; Star of Tears)\n\n7. Kuchizuke no Sono Ato (Goto version) (くちづけのその後; After a Kiss)\n\n8. Mirai no Tobira (未来の扉; Future Door)\n\n9. Himitsu (秘密; Secret)\n\n10. Paint It Gold (ペイント イット ゴールド)\n\n11. Scramble (スクランブル)\n\nUwasa no SEXY GUY (#6 / 61,000) opens in an explosive way and it is great. I don’t really know what to think of the music though. It is really fun and exciting, but it is a pop song with some rock and latin elements to it. Goto Maki also sounds great here and she sounds much more confident in herself compared to her first album. The song does drag on for a bit, but it is a strong opener. It’s no surprise why it was the album’s first single.\n\nRight after comes the album’s fourth single. Genshoku GAL Hade ni Yukube (#3 / 45,000) replaces the funkier elements for something more streamlined pop. It’s a very happy and bright pop song. Unfortunately, it’s not my cup of tea. The melody is a bit bouncy and annoying and how it is sung just does not do Goto any favours. There are some clever bits like the second half of the chorus.\n\nLOVE. BELIEVE IT! brings us a hard-hitting R&B/pop tune. I quite like how heavy the bass beat is even though the melody just glides over it. The chorus isn’t bad, although I don’t think it to be particularly catchy. Still, it’s better than the last song. I just wish Goto added a bit more emotion into her voice to really get the song to the next level.\n\nDaite yo! PLEASE GO ON (#4 / 59,000) is one of my favourite Goto Maki songs and it’s the best song on the album. It’s a fiery dance/pop tune and it fits perfectly with her piercing tone. The best thing about the song is that it keeps up the energy throughout and has a catchy melody to boot. There is also a funky rap that pops up around the end, which is a fun surprise. A great third single!\n\nShiawase Desu ka (Goto Version) is the solo version of a song by the H!P shuffle group, Sexy 8. It’s a sexy midtempo R&B/pop tune and is actually quite catchy. I prefer the original because the different voices helped to create some contrast in the melody, which doesn’t quite work as well when it’s solo. Goto sounds good, but just her tied with the awkward H!P background vocals just doesn’t quite tie together as well.\n\nNamida no Hoshi is the first ballad and it’s a pretty sounding one that focuses on the piano. I want to like this song, but it’s a bit boring. The melody is nice, but I think it would be better if the music had a bit more energy to it. The second half of the song has some nice strings coming in, but I think some percussion would have been nice as well. This is definitely one of Goto’s strongest vocal performances on this album.\n\nKuchizuke no Sono Ato (Goto Version) is the solo version of a light pop/rock song from Morning Musume’s third album. It don’t think it’s a particularly interesting song, but it does add some variety to the album and we hear a gentler side to Goto’s vocals. I do prefer the original a little bit more, but it’s just not a stand out song for me.\n\nMirai no Tobira is the solo version of the crazy song from Morning Musume’s first album. This time, Goto did feature another H!P group, Melon Kinenbi. I’m pretty sure she sang all the important parts of the song though. It’s a decent tune and has a lot more energy in the music this time around, so it’s a bit more entertaining. I actually like this version much more than the original because the music is fuller and works nicely with Goto’s voice.\n\nHimitsu is another slower tune and I think it’s better than the last ballad. It has an R&B beat which is layered over by the guitar. It’s a nice combination. Unfortunately, the chorus is underwhelming. It just does not have a lot of energy and the melody just sort of goes on in a daze. Goto sounds bored throughout it as well. A bit disappointing.\n\nThe title track, Paint It Gold, is the best album track on the album. We finally get another fast-paced dance tune and is really nicely crafted. I love the energy of the music with its disco elements and Goto sounds a lot more powerful here. The chorus isn’t the catchiest, but it’s still one of the more memorable melodies on the album. It’s a great tune.\n\nThe album ends with the second single, Scramble (#5 / 46,000). It’s a bright pop tune, but I think this one is much better pulled off. I really enjoy the music as it is explosive and works nicely with the melody. I do wish the chorus was a bit more impacting, but it’s still relatively catchy. I think Goto also sounds great. It’s not the strongest ending, but it is a decent song.\n\nOverall: This album was way better than her first one. Obviously, there were a few weaker tunes on here, but there were much stronger songs on here as well. While a lot of the songs still had that “Hello!Project” quality to them, it wasn’t as obvious and Goto sounded more confident and mature. I do wish the album had better ballads though as that was where things were weakest.\n\nB-"
