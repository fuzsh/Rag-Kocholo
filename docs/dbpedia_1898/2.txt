Kiss Me Good-Bye

Angela Aki

By Unyu Alay

You say my love is all you need

to see you through

But I know this words are not quite true

Here is the path you're looking for

an open door

Leading the world you long to explore

Fall if you must move on alone

I'm gonna make it on my own

Kiss me good-bye

Love's memory

Follow your heart

And find your destiny

Wont shed a tears

For love's mortality

For you, put the dreams

In my reality

~Interlude~

As time goes by, I know you'll see

this of me here

I love you enough to let you go free

Go, I will give you wings to fly

Cast all your fears into the sky

Kiss me good-bye

Love's mystery

All of my life

I'll hold you close to me

Wont shed a tears

For love's mortality

For you, put the dreams

In my reality

Kiss me good-bye

Love's memory

You put the dreams

In my reality
