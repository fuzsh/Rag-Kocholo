Lyrics - English Version

Note: This is the version used in both the Japanese and English releases of Final Fantasy XII.

You may say my love is all you need to see you through

But I know these words are not quite true

Here is the path you're looking for, an open door

Leading to worlds you long to explore

Go, if you must move on alone

I'm gonna make it on my own

Kiss me good-bye, love's memory

Follow your heart and fine your destiny

Won't shed a tear for love's mortality

For you put the dream in my reality

As time goes by I know you'll see this of me

I loved you enough to let you go free

Go, I will give you wings to fly

Cast all your fears into the sky

Kiss me good-bye, love's mystery

All of my life I'll hold you close to me

Won't shed a tear for love's mortality

For you put the dream in my reality

Kiss me good-bye, love's memory

You put the dream in my reality

Lyrics - Original Japanese Version

Anata wa mayotte, ite mo

Doa wa aiteru yo

Futari no sekai dake de wa

Mitasarenain deshou?

Hane wo ageru kara

Shinjite tobe-pa ii

Kiss me good-bye, love is memory

Anatawo ushinattemo

Aishita kiokuga tuyosani kawarukara

Tashikana monowo sagashite

Daremoga koisuruga

Yuruganai aiwa jibunno nakaniaru

Kiss me good-bye, sayonara

Atarashii watashi ni kawaru

Kiss me good-bye

Kiss me good-bye

Kiss me good-bye, love is memory

Atarashii futari ni kawaru nara

Kiss me good-bye, nakanai

Anata wo aiseta kara

Anata wo aiseta kara

Lyrics - English Translation

Though you lost your way

The door is already open

You can't be satisfied

For the world only with me

I give you wings,

You should believe and fly

Kiss me good-bye, love's memory

Even if I lose you

My memory of love changes into my strength

Everyone falls in love

For searching a reliable thing

But a reliable love exists in ourselves

Kiss me good-bye, farewell

I will make myself new

Kiss me good-bye

Kiss me good-bye

Kiss me good-bye, love's memory

If we make ourselves new

Kiss me good-bye, I don't cry

Because I could love you

Because I could love you
