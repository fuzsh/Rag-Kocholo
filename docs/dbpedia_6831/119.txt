This shot also allows the audience see what type of person Mia’s mother is, we can see that she is a smoker, this is as she has a cigarette in her hand. Also this shot gives the impression that Mia’s mother does not care much for her surroundings, this is in reference to the fact that the house is un-tidy, this is as there is a beer can as well as a alcohol bottle on the window seal. This conforms to typical norms and convention of ‘social realism’, because this is how a typical working class home would appear.
