        "text": "Andrea Arnold's FISH TANK follows Mia Williams, a volatile adolescent living with her hard drinking mother and equally foul mouthed little sister Tyler. Early on we see Mia having this verbal exchange with her friend's father,\n\nMia: Can you give Keeley a message for me?\n\nKeeley's Dad: What?\n\nMia: Tell her I think her old man's a cunt!.\n\nMia's exploits have convinced her mother to send her away to a school for troubled youth, which she is determined to avoid. Obsessed with hip-hop and dance, Mia hopes to find something on her own terms. In comes her mother's new boyfriend Connor, who sometimes fills the father role these women want and other times stokes the bad influences flying around the tiny apartment.\n\nMia and Connor are drawn to each other. Connor sees Mia's outbursts as cries for the care and attention she rarely gets from her mom. Mia is intrigued by him and frequently goes to him for help or advice, but her moods turn on a dime. Mia seems to be growing a different part of herself when Connor's around; a part that can trust, a part that can be calm and imaginative.\n\nArnold's film is a rare experience of discovery on many levels. She filmed it in Academy ratio using the full height of the screen canvas and while narrowing the edges to almost feel like a cage. Young Katie Jarvis makes full use of the tighter space, trashing at every corner of the frame. Unconventional directing tactics like filming the movie chronologically and withholding the full script from the actors until the scene was to be filmed give the film a pulsing energy throughout. Arnold never tipping her hand or releases the tension around the nature of Connor and Mia's relationship. Each time I watch the film, which must be a dozen by now, I find myself considering the characters' in different ways. Their words and actions take new meanings and spark different questions after each viewing.\n\nKatie Jarvis gives a gnarling first time (hopefully not the last) performance, bringing a spontaneity and vulnerability needed for this teenage powder keg. Michael Fassbender imbues Connor with a magnetism that draws us and Mia in (it doesn't hurt that he's shirtless A LOT). He keeps Connor's mood pretty even and light, a great contrast to Mia. Fassbender neutralizes and softens Jarvis with his humor and care, until she fires back with vitriol.\n\nArnold keeps our suspicions sharp, but stretches hope for these characters until the last possible moment. The climax is extremely problematic and at times feels outside of the film. Yet, the narrative recovers quickly with a fitting conclusion of a small reconciliation between Mia and her mother and the escape she may be looking for."
