        "text": "Cléo from 5 to 7 1962\n\n★★★★★ Watched 01 Jan 2023\n\nThis French New Wave film exceeded my expectations in so many ways. I was overwhelmingly mesmerized. It really felt like seeing magic. What really sealed the hypnosis was the almost ethereal Corinne Marchand portrayal of Florence (Cleo). Critics love talking about presence but Corinne on the screen was the equivalent of butterflies in your stomach and feathers floating in the air.\n\nElegant, graceful, and astonishingly effortless; I’m not sure if I’ve seen a performance like this. Corinne absolutely soars as the melodramatic musician Cleopatra.\n\nCleo From 5 to 7 has powerful storytelling, is brimming with heart bursting romance, and is a refreshing look into beauty, inevitable death, and societal expectations.\n\nThis has skyrocketed to the top of my favorite film lists. You can see Agnes Varda’s influence in so many modern directors and cinematographers and I can’t wait to dive even deeper into her filmography.\n\nViolent Night 2022\n\n★★½ Watched 31 Dec 2022\n\nThe right amount of gratuitous violence, Christmas cheer, and comedy from Violent Night led to one of the better holiday Santa movies to come out in recent years.\n\nGlass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery 2022\n\n★★★ Watched 29 Dec 2022\n\nProvides some laughs and was interesting to watch with the family while it had their attention. Waiting for Netflix to give in and make this an obligatory tv show with rotating detectives.\n\nGuillermo del Toro’s Pinocchio 2022\n\n★★½ Watched 27 Dec 2022\n\nNot as magical as I would have wished but damn, I admire the craft in stop motion animation. Think I may have enjoyed the behind-the-scenes promo more than the actual film.\n\nSynecdoche, New York 2008\n\n★★★½ Watched 25 Dec 2022\n\nIntensely dark and melancholic but acutely thought provoking. This film will in all likelihood make you depressed, but Synecdoche’s examination of life, death, and purpose/ role is a powerful one.\n\nHeavy on symbolism and it could be argued that at times Synecdoche can be almost oppressive with its themes; Regardless, I have a whole new appreciation for the Eternal Sunshine writer and director. It may be hard to recommend this to anyone but serious cinephiles. Its apparent this film meant a lot to Kaufmann and that passion really shines through here.\n\nThe Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special 2022\n\n★★★½ Watched 24 Dec 2022\n\nBrief, comforting, and a welcome detour for the MCU. I really found myself enjoying the gang getting into the holiday spirit. The musical numbers and Kevin Bacon are pretty darn good too.\n\nAvatar: The Way of Water 2022\n\n★★★★ Watched 17 Dec 2022\n\nAn absolute blast of fun. I can understand those not liking the story but, in all honesty, I would watch almost anything if it was filmed in this way.\n\nYou have to submerge yourself in these cinematic waters at the theater for full effect!\n\nDig 2022\n\n★★★ Watched 01 Dec 2022\n\nEntertaining but stunts and general staging could have used more work. Finale being so sloppy really dragged down what was an overall good film.\n\nThe Innocents 2021\n\n★★★★★ Watched 10 Dec 2022\n\nHair-raising and a truly distressing horror experience. The fact that the film has supernatural elements is just masterful subterfuge. Some of this content may not be for everyone…\n\nCircle 2015\n\n★★ Watched 30 Nov 2022\n\nDumb but good dumb.\n\nApur Sansar 1959\n\n★★★★★ Watched 26 Nov 2022\n\nThe Indian legend and auter Satyajit Ray has painted an immensely powerful and unforgettable tale with the Apu trilogy. These films are colossal feats for Indian and Global cinema and encapsulate what all film makers strive to capture. Apur Sansar doesn’t miss a beat.\n\nSimply magic…\n\nBrief Encounter 1945\n\n★★★★½ Watched 25 Nov 2022\n\nBrief encounter is an absolutely tremendous film brimming with charm and in a league of its own. Its mesmerizing visuals and black and white technical lighting, dazzling performances, and subtle and intelligent writing/screenplay are near flawless. I can’t recommend enough.\n\nSafe 1995\n\n★★★★½ Watched 23 Nov 2022\n\nJulianne Moore is amazing in this. Safe is a thought provoking and simultaneously haunting film. I get goosebumps when I think of specific scenes and how Moore’s character is struggling with her condition and reality. I can’t wait to recommend to friends.\n\nAll Quiet on the Western Front 1930\n\n★★★★ Watched 21 Nov 2022\n\nAn engrossing and mandatory staple for fans of the war genre.\n\nBullet Train 2022\n\n★★★★ Watched 08 Nov 2022\n\nBullet Train harkens back to an era of ensemble action films from the early 2000s and films like Smoking Aces. Bullet Train is a thoroughly funny and action-packed ride.\n\nJurassic World Dominion 2022\n\n★ Watched 07 Nov 2022\n\nToo darn cheesy for me. There is almost a good 30-minute stretch of the movie that is actually super fun to watch but then you have to go back to the bad plotlines, contrived side arcs, and the annoying thing where the characters become dinosaur whisperers and hypnotize everything by simply putting their hands up in front of them.\n\nX 2022\n\n★★ Watched 27 Oct 2022\n\nNot any super fresh ideas here but its executed so well that it’s really fun to watch. I somewhat felt that the film resolved hastily but my interest is definitely piqued for how they develop and continue Maxine’s arc. I’m hoping the sequel is an unhinged descent into madness and gore.\n\nFourth of July 2022\n\n★★ Watched 25 Oct 2022\n\nC.K. I believe went on record for saying its hardest to play yourself as an actor. This idea really manifests in this feature film. An expectedly solid production from Louis C.K. is brought down by the main lead’s acting chops (Joe List). Paula Plum was the standout here in this messy dramedy. Fortunately, the pieces somewhat align together under C.K’s direction for the film and the narrative is definitely engaging enough to warrant a watch.\n\nMen 2022\n\n★★★ Watched 25 Oct 2022\n\nAlthough the film strives for a chaotic surreal like quality it kind of falls short due to feeling mostly like a horror movie about a shapeshifter.\n\nThe Neon Demon 2016\n\n★★★★ Watched 22 Oct 2022\n\nA really fun and twisted movie which is filled with drop dead gorgeous women and is brimming with masterful composition. Half the frames in the movie I really want to just go back and make into wallpapers.\n\nBlonde 2022\n\n★½ Watched 01 Oct 2022\n\nNot sure what hellish fever dream I just watched but at least I enjoyed the cinematography, I guess.\n\nLou 2022\n\n★ Watched 25 Sep 2022\n\nTerrible film. The one thing that really stood out to me was the black ops CIA operative guy and how he brought the lowest caliber possible to a gunfight and couldn’t shoot through a wooden table two feet in front of him.\n\nPossessor 2020\n\n★★★★½ Watched 24 Sep 2022\n\nSuch a cool concept. I really loved how they visualized all the internal struggle between host and possessor. Really fun and gory film.\n\nSt. Vincent 2014\n\n★★★ Watched 19 Sep 2022\n\nI know this movie isn’t highbrow art or anything, but damn Bill Murray elevated the film enough to make me teary eyed.\n\nHouse of Darkness 2022\n\n★★½ Watched 18 Sep 2022\n\nThe dialogue was really fun at times. As it dragged on though it got a bit repetitive. Great popcorn flick though.\n\nNever Let Me Go 2010\n\n★★½ Watched 18 Sep 2022\n\nI’d seen this film ages ago but on rewatch didn’t realize how simple the plot was. There is something special hiding here with its sci-fi adjacent plot but it’s hampered by soapiness.\n\nNope 2022\n\n★ Watched 18 Sep 2022\n\nThis film is just bad satire for a director or cinematographer’s need to get the perfect shot. It’s a movie about a glorified balloon animal. Not the type of film I want from Peele.\n\nEmily the Criminal 2022\n\n★½ Watched 16 Sep 2022\n\nAubrey is great but there isn’t much going for this film sadly.\n\nThor: Love and Thunder 2022\n\n★½ Watched 10 Sep 2022\n\nSo boring. No charm and no wit. This was an unnecessary kiddie film.\n\nThe Peanut Butter Falcon 2019\n\n★★★½ Watched 08 Sep 2022\n\nShia is great as usual but obviously the heart of the film is the star Gottsagen. He is a beautiful soul and delightful character to watch on the screen.\n\nAlso, big shout out to Jon Bernthal for his roles in films and tv like The Bear/Wind River. Seems like anything with Bernthal with a super small role ends up being good for some reason.\n\nThe Flood 2019\n\n★★ Watched 08 Sep 2022\n\nOverall, a very basic film which lacks a draw even with huge actors.\n\nA Dog’s Will 2000\n\n★★★½ Watched 07 Sep 2022\n\nFun and full of charm.\n\nKids 1995\n\n★★★ Watched 06 Sep 2022\n\nVisually pleasing and absolutely nostalgic. The movie felt like a loose documentary at times. I can’t help but think if it was more focused with some work on the musical score it could have been amazing.\n\nVisitor Q 2001\n\n★★★★ Watched 06 Sep 2022\n\nA mixture of the absolute bizarre, taboo, horror/gore, and at times surprising humor makes this film essential arthouse. Takashi Miike will make you uncomfortable. Don’t watch this with your mom.\n\nThe French Dispatch 2021\n\n★★★½ Watched 05 Sep 2022\n\nSuch an ensemble! Benicio del Toro made this film for me. He is such a good damn actor. Wes Anderson’s The French Dispatch is gorgeous and quirky but that is to be expected. Without the Brody/Seydoux/Toro arc this film may have been skippable.\n\nThe Squid and the Whale 2005\n\n★★★★ Watched 05 Sep 2022\n\nRelatable and engaging. Now that I think about it, I stuck a raw bean up my nose for days when I was a kid. Guess it’s a universal childish thing to do. In all seriousness this was a good Noah B film with a great cast and strong performances.\n\nWar and Peace 1965\n\n★★★★½ Watched 27 Aug 2022\n\nWar and peace is exhausting and relentless. It took me months to finish the film but it was well worth it. Even with its propagandic nature proudly displayed on its sleeve; War and Peace is a once in a lifetime special film.\n\nThis amazing production absolutely blew me away at times. Seen some things captured in this film that I didn’t even think was possible from a technical perspective for the time period.\n\nHorrific, artistic, and overflowing with spirit and patriotism; It’s hard to find fault in the film besides its hefty runtime and required investment.\n\nDoctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness 2022\n\n★★ Watched 14 Aug 2022\n\nFor a Sam Raimi film it sort of lacked that delicate balance of camp and drama. You can definitely sense Sam’s touch on the film but maybe the downright absurdity of Strange’s power doesn’t lend well to the underlying themes of humanism that works so well in the original spiderman trilogy. It really just felt like it was weirdly a film about magicians and that’s not really interesting to me.\n\nFor a MCU film it was decent.\n\nElvis 2022\n\n★★ Watched 21 Aug 2022\n\nServiceable biopic film but honestly everyone will be better off watching a documentary. Sitting through 3 hours of Tom Hanks looking like white Eddie Murphy from The Nutty Professor is not ideal way to spend a day off.\n\nDrive My Car 2021\n\n★★★ Watched 20 Aug 2022\n\nMight be crazy but the one thing I did not enjoy about this film was the driving and the role of the driver in the story. Story felt unique and fresh but felt like it dragged due to being tied down and continually revolving back around to a really awkward and antisocial 23-year-old driver.\n\nDamn scenery in the film is sublime though. I give it that.\n\nPrey 2022\n\n★★★★ Watched 15 Aug 2022\n\nThis movie just works as a Horror and Predator film. Prey contains a slew of inspired glimpses of breathtaking film making especially earlier on. Ultimately, it’s videogamey but damn if it ain’t a damn blast! Looking forward to Dan T’s next work.\n\nEternals 2021\n\n★★ Watched 12 Aug 2022\n\nIf this didn’t have Marvel attached maybe this could have been a decent tv show or something. As it stands it doesn’t feel like it belongs in the MCU. I sense lots of people watching just for completionist sake.\n\nThirteen Lives 2022\n\n★★★ Watched 08 Aug 2022\n\nGood movie and I enjoyed it but thought the editing and speed between days could have been better explored. Ron Howard provides an emotional ride based on a true story without leaning to sappiness.\n\nMaster and Commander: The Far Side of the World 2003\n\n★★★★½ Watched 04 Aug 2022\n\nMaster and Commander is epic in scale, packed with great acting, amazing sets, and is an all-around absolutely phenomenal production.\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once 2022\n\n★★★½ Watched 19 Jun 2022\n\nDamn, I want an everything bagel right now. On my way to Dunkin.\n\nTropic Thunder 2008\n\n★★½ Watched 20 Jun 2022\n\nThrowback to a light and fun time. Those production values actually blow my mind a little.\n\nHustle 2022\n\n★★★ Watched 12 Jun 2022\n\nSolid sports movie but no surprises on plot and underdog formula. Queen Latifah is the best though.\n\nThe Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent 2022\n\n★★★ Watched 11 Jun 2022\n\nI liked it. Nick should have been less subtle though.\n\nRRR 2022\n\n★★★½ Watched 06 Jun 2022 4\n\nRaw talent like this really only exists in Indian cinema and theatre. So damn unbelievably outrageous and funny. A super fun time.\n\nTop Gun: Maverick 2022\n\n★★★★ Watched 04 Jun 2022\n\nWill be an action packed and thoroughly damn fun return to cinema for old and new fans.\n\nMeet Joe Black 1998\n\n★★★ Watched 02 Jun 2022\n\nThis film contains a great performance by Anthony Hopkins, as expected.\n\nAlthough not as philosophical and thoughtful as it’s potential; it packs an emotional punch at key moments thanks to Newman’s musical score.\n\nSome of my favorite moments of this film exist very early on with Hopkins character communicating with the mystery man before he meets him. It would have been neat to further explore that thread.\n\nMorbius 2022 ★\n\nWatched May 28, 2022\n\nThis probably would have been a blockbuster hit in the late 90s early 2000s.\n\nVery bad movie. Not even worth watching for memes.\n\nToy Story 4 2019 ★★½\n\nWatched May 26, 2022\n\nMaybe not completely necessary but still pretty much a solid pixar quality production. Watching this just made me want to watch 3.\n\nTop Gun 1986 ★★★\n\nWatched May 23, 2022\n\nTop class film making. Exciting and fun to watch.\n\nFrontline: Poor Kids 2012 ★★★½\n\nWatched May 18, 2022\n\nFaced with poverty and a bleak and uncertain future these kids hold on to hope where they can find it. They are the future, and this is really a shame. Watching them growing up too fast and being so cynical at such an early point in their lives really is heart breaking.\n\nAmbulance 2022 ★★★\n\nWatched May 18, 2022\n\nAction packed and super fun. I only wish the ending was more fleshed out.\n\nLicorice Pizza 2021 ★★★\n\nWatched May 15, 2022\n\nThat feel good feel? Yes.\n\nExpertly crafted PTA film? Yes.\n\nWorth your time? Probably not.\n\nThe Northman 2022 ★★★\n\nWatched May 14, 2022\n\nBloody and engrossing. Missing something though not sure what. More Dafoe?\n\nRio, Zona Norte 1957 ★★★★\n\nWatched May 08, 2022\n\nMusic for the soul.\n\nUncharted 2022 ★★★★\n\nWatched May 01, 2022\n\nVery fun family blockbuster with good special effects. Definitely feels like it has potential to be a huge franchise.\n\nThe Sadness 2021 ★★★★\n\nWatched Apr 19, 2022\n\nEven a highly desensitized bastard like me thinks this shit is extreme. This film is a damn blast.\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home 2021 ★★★★½\n\nWatched Apr 18, 2022\n\nNWH is Light, hearty, and really fun. I really enjoyed this overt nostalgia ride.\n\nAparajito 1956 ★★★★½\n\nWatched Apr 03, 2022\n\n|Honour thy father and thy mother, that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest live long on the good land, which the Lord thy God gives to thee.|\n\nLife is too short.\n\nStalker 1979 ★★★★½\n\nWatched Apr 02, 2022\n\nStalker is a cerebral and philosophical triumph. Matched with a thoroughly engaging screen play, jaw dropping dystopian visuals/cinematography, and a tense atmosphere of despair; Stalker is a near masterpiece. Be prepared to lose yourself, as you wind in and out of the labyrinth of the zone and explore the nature of humanity’s inner desires and demons.\n\nKing Richard 2021 ★★★\n\nWatched Mar 24, 2022\n\nPre-Oscar Slap:\n\nA standout performance by Aunjanue Ellis is matched by Smith’s return to drama. King Richard is a good film that sputters out 2/3s in. Regardless, Will Smith needs to grab more roles like this.\n\nSteve Jobs 2015 ★★½\n\nWatched Mar 20, 2022\n\nSteve Jobs is greatly written but plagued by a sense of self importance and what feels like unnecessary dramatization.\n\nFilme Demência 1986 ★★★½\n\nWatched Mar 18, 2022\n\nA film of mythos carried by great performances, engaging screenplay, and visual metaphors.\n\nTampopo 1985 ★★★★\n\nWatched Mar 13, 2022\n\nEndearing and absolutely brimming with charm.\n\nI probably smiled half the film. I only wish the satire of western and Japanese culture/themes were more naturally woven into the narrative arc of the movie. With the exception of some questionable eroticism, I think this film really is something special and uniquely Japanese. I definitely recommend.\n\nKin 2018 ★\n\nWatched Mar 13, 2022\n\nGarbage water.\n\nJacob’s Ladder 1990 ★★★★½\n\nWatched Mar 11, 2022\n\nJacob’s Ladder is a hellish dive into madness, despair, and disillusionment that will fill you with anxiety. This film has that dream-like sense of dread and foreboding, similar to Mullholand Drive’s diner scene but for 2 straight hours. Whether Jacob’s ladder is a simple anti-war story or an allegory for death, purgatory, and regret; I’m unsure. In the big picture, it doesn’t really matter because it delivers, full stop. This film made me uncomfortable and I genuinely enjoyed putting the pieces together of this horror/thriller.\n\nPather Panchali 1955 ★★★★★\n\nWatched Feb 25, 2022\n\nA beautiful tale of innocence and hardship that shouldn’t be missed.\n\nThe Voyeurs 2021 ★½\n\nWatched Sep 11, 2021\n\nMind ya damn business\n\n-a film by Michael Mohan\n\nGattaca 1997 ★★★★★\n\nRewatched Aug 24, 2021\n\nSuperb.\n\nThe Green Knight 2021 ★★★★★\n\nWatched Aug 22, 2021\n\nThe Green Knight is drop dead gorgeous, full of style, and a properly intriguing vision. I loved the journey and witnessing the highs and lows of Sir Gawain. Characters felt true to themselves and the mystery and enigma of the world that was created had me invested 100 percent. A very good example of “don’t try to understand, just feel it” done right. In all seriousness this movie was awesome.\n\nGood Morning 1959 ★★★★★\n\nWatched Jul 10, 2021\n\nPerfectly encapsulates everything I love about Ozu. Good Morning is a film full of love, laughter, and a sense of nostalgia that touches you. I just envy first timers who will have the warm homely feeling I get while watching this. Such a beautiful film that I can’t recommend enough.\n\nTommaso 2019 ★★★★\n\nWatched Jul 09, 2021\n\nThoroughly engaging, arousing, full of emotion and self refection. Dafoe is brilliant. Will be jumping on to the director’s other work asap.\n\nA Quiet Place Part II 2020 ★½\n\nWatched Jul 07, 2021\n\nBoring and predictable formula from first film rehashed.\n\nMinari 2020 ★★★★★\n\nWatched Feb 26, 2021\n\nBrilliantly simple and profound with a tremendous soundtrack. Cant ask for more from a movie.\n\nCéline and Julie Go Boating 1974 ★\n\nWatched Feb 19, 2021\n\nHad to pause this twice to finish. (Very long)\n\nColumbus 2017 ★\n\nWatched Jan 16, 2021\n\nBoring intellectual babble with a side dish of staring at buildings.\n\nLilya 4-ever 2002 ★★★★★\n\nWatched Jan 16, 2021\n\nSimply devastating.\n\nWonder Woman 1984 2020 ★★★\n\nWatched Dec 27, 2020\n\nA fun and at times extremely campy film. 2 stars deducted for Gal Gadot’s awkward roadrunner like running motions.\n\nSound of Metal 2019 ★★★\n\nWatched Dec 23, 2020\n\nThoughtful but ultimately lacks a big punch. The film also feels like it is missing an act in which the protagonist “learns to be deaf”. I still enjoyed this film a lot despite its shortcomings.\n\nHarakiri 1962 ★★★★★\n\nWatched Dec 16, 2020\n\nOne of the best Japanese stories ever told. In many ways more powerful than Seven Samurai. I can’t believe I took so long to watch this gem. At least something good is coming out of being stuck at home. Can’t recommend this enough.\n\nWind 2019 ★★★½\n\nWatched Oct 31, 2020\n\nInteresting Disney/Pixar production with nice foundation but just doesn’t work for some reason. Probably could have used 5 more minutes.\n\nPersonal Shopper 2016 ★★★\n\nWatched Oct 30, 2020\n\nAn engaging supernatural thriller with a contemplative conclusion.\n\nKrisha 2015 ★★★\n\nWatched Oct 28, 2020\n\nFull of drama, beautifully shot, and distressingly claustrophobic. One hell of a family gathering. Would not attend.\n\nCoherence 2013 ★★★½\n\nWatched Oct 27, 2020\n\nThis film actually surprised me how good it was because I heard it was similar to Primer. However, this manages to not be boring. Does the film coherently pull off its sci-fi premise? For the most part. Hard to fully suspend belief when it feels so low budget though. I’ll forgive it because it is low budget.\n\nCentral Station 1998 ★★★★★\n\nWatched Oct 25, 2020\n\nSimply brilliant and full of heart. An amazing Brazilian film that will likely bring you to tears at some point.\n\nAn Autumn Afternoon 1962 ★★★★★\n\nWatched Oct 25, 2020\n\nWhat is there really to say? Ozu’s final film and overall legacy is magnificent. This film, like many of his other achievements, show how a movie should make you feel. Ozu’s crafted stories are filled with subtle dialog, impactful/meaningful photography, and a sense of comfort that probably will never be replicated.\n\nA sandwich of tenderness, love, sadness, and drizzled with a healthy dosage of optimism; An Autumn Afternoon will have you yearning and longing for family you never knew you wanted. I love Ozu and will never grow tired of his everlasting and timeless filmography.\n\nThe Big City 1963 ★★★★★\n\nWatched Oct 18, 2020\n\nAfter watching this film, The Big City rocketed up my list of favorite foreign/Indian movies. It examines one family’s struggles to survive in a reluctant patriarchal Indian society and their day-to-day struggles, while attempting to provide for their family. Even backdropped with such heavy socio-economic overtones; The Big City wowed with me with its underlying hopeful story of attaining self-worth and the love of husband and wife that would get them through anything.\n\nPersona 1966 ★★★★\n\nWatched Oct 02, 2020\n\nOn top of having some beautiful and haunting imagery; this film can be endlessly pulled apart for its meaning and debated for the multitude of metaphors and feminist themes. I really like the way the film handled the dynamic nature of the two women’s relationship, their personal adversities, and highly recommend it.\n\nCorpus Christi 2019 ★★★★½\n\nWatched Sep 30, 2020\n\nAs anyone can clearly see, this juvenile is no imposter. He was chosen by God for this role. The struggle displayed in this film as the protagonist is being painfully torn between his past and his present life resonated strongly with me. All the elements from the cast to the acting and photography really culminates in a powerful film that shouldn’t be missed whether you like religion themed films or not.\n\nThe Second Mother 2015 ★★★★½\n\nWatched Sep 29, 2020\n\nA heartwarming film about family and values. There is something special here in the small moments and everyday life events that really draws me to this film. Seeing the mother splashing in the pool is just delightful.\n\nBacurau 2019 ★★★\n\nWatched Sep 29, 2020\n\nAn interesting movie bringing in elements of horror and action that concludes in a fun and battle royale styled western standoff.\n\nLe Trou 1960 ★★★★★\n\nWatched Sep 28, 2020\n\nThoroughly engrossing and what I love about cinema. This is an all time classic. Friendship, hope, betrayal, and despair all combine for the perfect black and white prison escape journey.\n\nSleeping with Other People 2015 ★★★\n\nWatched Jul 14, 2020\n\nNot the greatest in the genre but pretty serviceable. I only wish the movie ended on a more realistic note. Was actually surprised when the movie carried on after what I thought was the ending. Sunshine and rainbows is the name of the game here but that’s okay because I still ended up liking the film regardless."
