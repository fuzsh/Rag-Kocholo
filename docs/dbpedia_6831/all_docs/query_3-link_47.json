        "text": "Over the last few months we’ve witnessed a boomlet in acclaimed movies where sharp young women plunge headlong into the brier patch of adult life: Bright Star, An Education, Coco Before Chanel. But only now are they releasing my favorite, Andrea Arnold’s Fish Tank. When I saw it at Cannes last May, I thought it was one of the best films at the festival, and I wasn’t alone: It won the Jury Prize. More important, this gritty, powerful British film established the 48-year-old director as one of the talented new filmmakers of the last decade. Katie Jarvis stars as Mia, a bored fifteen-year-old who lives with her man-mad, hard-drinking, 30-something mother (Kierston Wareing) in a dreary housing estate in Essex. Mia bickers with her mum, has fistfights with her peers, and gets tossed out of school; she spends hours playing Nas’s “Life’s a Bitch” and working on the routines that she thinks will lead to a job as a professional dancer (good luck with that, kid). But her already unstable world goes boy-oy-yoing when she meets her mother’s new lover, Connor, a louche charmer played by Michael Fassbender, whom my wife calls “the sexy version of Matthew McConaughey.” Mia’s instantly smitten by Connor’s easygoing allure, and they inch into a relationship that even the slow members of the audience can tell is going to boomerang. Now, on the face of it, Fish Tank may sound like your standard issue coming-of-age snoozer. What makes it far better is the hawkeyed intensity of Arnold’s filmmaking, which captures ferocious emotions and displays an admirable willingness to grapple with what it really means for a girl of Mia’s age to have a sexual encounter with a bounder in his 30s (an issue largely soft-pedaled by An Education). While the movie is rivetingly shot and edited, Arnold’s true triumph lies in winning such a compelling performance from a first-time actor like Jarvis. Her scenes with Fassbender, who’s even better here than in Hunger and Inglourious Basterds, are some of the finest I’ve seen about male seductiveness and teenage longing. By now, we shouldn’t be surprised that Arnold should be good at capturing women’s complex, sometimes dangerous desires. A late starter as a director, she won the 2005 Oscar for her short film Wasp, about a trapped, irresponsible mother who ignores her kids to go out on a date. The following year, she nabbed her first Cannes Jury Prize for Red Road, a nifty piece of neo-noir about a Glasgow CCTV operator (Kate Dickie, tremendous) who gets carnally involved with a dark figure from her past (Arnold has a great eye for dodgy but sexually charismatic men). Her knack for tough, edgy, unmoralistic material is what makes her so interesting, yet it’s precisely this gift that make her films a hard sell, especially in the U.S. where we like our British films to be light or genteel. Her work is sometimes tarred with that killer label “miserablism,” even though Fish Tank actually ends on a note of hope. More problematically, Arnold is one of those rare female directors—Kathryn Bigelow, Jane Campion, and Catherine Breillat are others—whose work doesn’t fit neatly into clichés about the kind of films women are expected to make. When guys like David Lynch, Michael Haneke, Lars von Trier, or Paul Thomas Anderson make movies exploding with darkness and style, they’re celebrated as geniuses. When women explore the same territory, their work meets with enormous resistance. I’ll never forget the response to Campion’s In the Cut, which, in its heightened emotions and dreamlike style, was essentially a female Taxi Driver—except that Scorsese’s movie was worshiped for its amped-up vision of New York, while Campion’s was almost universally derided. Happily, the response to Fish Tank has been largely positive. It’s not a perfect movie—mom’s a bit one-note, there are a couple of forced scenes in the last half hour—but most of it is terrific. Besides, at this stage in her still unfurling career, Arnold deserves to be supported, not nitpicked."
