        "text": "1. Fish Tank Film Analysis By: Damilola Ogunnaike\n\n2. Synopsis The drama film ‘Fish Tank’ was released in 2009, it was written and directed by Andrea Arnold. This film is about The film is about Mia Williams, a volatile and socially isolated 15- year-old who lives on an Essex estate with her single mother, and precocious little sister Tyler. She has been thrown out of school and is awaiting admission to a referrals unit and spends her days aimlessly. A weird and uncomfortable friendship blossoms between Mia and her mothers boyfriend, Connor who encourages her one interest, dancing. The film ‘Fish Tank’ was received well, this is due to the fact that it won the Jury prize at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival, it also went onto win the 2010 BAFTA Best British Film Award.\n\n3. These two Gifs show the use of an establishing shots. An establishing shot is usually the first shot of a new scene, designed to show the audience where the action is taking place. It is usually a very wide shot or extreme wide shot. It allows the audience to experience and get to know the surroundings of the protagonist. This shot shows that Mia lives in a council estate, it also shows that there is not that much around but tower block flats and council flats.\n\n4. This Gif shows the use of an over the shoulder shot, an over the shoulder shot is a shot of someone or something taken from the perspective. In the case of this gif it allows us to see Mia’s mother, Joanne from Mia’ perspective. This shot also allows the audience see what type of person Mia’s mother is, we can see that she is a smoker, this is as she has a cigarette in her hand. Also this shot gives the impression that Mia’s mother does not care much for her surroundings, this is in reference to the fact that the house is un-tidy, this is as there is a beer can as well as a alcohol bottle on the window seal. This conforms to typical norms and convention of ‘social realism’, because this is how a typical working class home would appear."
