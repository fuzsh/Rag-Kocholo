        "text": "copyright 2021, Jump Cut: A Review of Contemporary Media\n\nJump Cut, No. 60, spring 2021\n\nTrouble in the heartland: class and culture in American Honey\n\nBy Milo Sweedler\n\nAndrea Arnold’s American Honey (2016) is a film of its time. Released in the United States four days after the first presidential debate between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Donald Trump, the film provides a fascinating snapshot of Middle America in the 2010s. Depicting a group of down-and-out youth who travel through the Midwest selling magazine subscriptions nobody wants, the film presents an image of the U.S. heartland as a mosaic of posh suburbs, upscale subdivisions, conglomerations of dilapidated bungalows, vast expanses of farmland, and a seemingly endless string of truckstops, roadside motels, convenience stores, and fast-food restaurants.This social landscape is seen alternately through the windows of the van that transports the magazine crew from sales location to sales location, and up-close and in-person as the sales associates go door-to-door hawking their wares. A veritable tour of the “red states” at the core of the country â the ones that would vote for Trump in the coming election â the movie presents the heartland as a socially fractured region characterized by extremes of wealth inequality.\n\nThe mag crew, a motley group of misfits recruited on the road, hail from places as remote from one another as California, Oregon, Texas, Tennessee, Missouri, Florida, and New Jersey. Situated on the lowest rung of the social ladder, these marginalized youth show no class-consciousness. As the lyrics of one of their favorite rap songs would have it, their aspirations are, in effect, to “make money, get turnt” (the latter term meaning “excited,” “adrenalized,” or “intoxicated”).[1] [open notes in new window] Aspiring to the American dream in the era of the American nightmare, the mag crew emblematizes the plight of countless millennials at a time when underemployment and precarious employment are becoming the rule rather than the exception.\n\nOne of the striking features of this socially conscious film about a subculture of underprivileged youth is its exuberance. The ubiquitous hip-hop, country, and indie rock music playing at high volume as the van traverses the U.S. midlands contributes to the jubilant feel of the film. So too do its depictions of social relations within the multicultural mag crew. Although far from being unambiguous, the film’s representation of these relations skews toward a vision of radical inclusion. This inclusivity is also emblematic of youth culture in the new millennium.\n\nThis article examines the vision of Middle America transmitted in Arnold’s thought-provoking film. Taking as its point of departure film critic Pamela Hutchinson’s remark that the movie’s mixed-race heroine, Star (Sasha Lane), is a new Dorothy, the article begins, following a film overview and a gloss of its critical reception, with a comparative analysis of American Honey’s worldview and the one presented in L. Frank Baum’s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (1900). Interpreted in the second half of the twentieth century as a national allegory of the post-depression United States, as the country emerged from the Panic of 1893, Baum’s novel presents interesting parallels with Arnold’s post-recession film, released in the wake of the Great Recession of 2007â09. Concentrating, in particular, on the movie’s depiction of the affluent suburbs of Kansas City and its portrayal of people living in abject poverty in rural South Dakota, I argue that the film gives audio-visual form to the sharp socio-economic divisions that Thomas Frank describes in What’s the Matter with Kansas? (2004) and that Thomas Piketty analyzes on a global scale in Capital in the Twenty-First Century (2013).\n\nI then examine the film’s portrayals of its two other main characters, the mag crew’s top seller, Jake (Shia LaBeouf), who initially introduces himself as being “Donald Trump-ish,” and Krystal (Riley Keough), the shrewd owner of the mag-crew franchise, a self-described “Southern girl” (or “real American honey”), who treats Jake as her personal boy toy. The examination of the film’s three main figures, who are involved in a love triangle that exposes Star to Krystal’s wrath, leads to analyses of the film’s depictions of sexuality and race relations. The article concludes with a meditation on the split between class-consciousness and multicultural awareness in both the film text and its national context, and ponders the ramifications of this split in the purview of the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election. While the heartland figured prominently in discussions of the 2016 election, the millennial generation â Gen Y or Z â has figured prominently in discussions of the 2020 election. Arnold’s film contributes to our understanding of this potentially powerful political force.\n\nFilm overview\n\nWinner of the Jury Prize at the 2016 Cannes Film Festival, American Honey depicts several weeks in Star’s life as the young woman travels north from Oklahoma to the Dakotas with Krystal’s itinerant magazine sales team. Part road movie, part coming-of-age story, and part social-issue drama, the film opens with a striking scene of the eighteen-year-old Star dumpster diving with her two pre-teen wards, Kelsey and Rubin (Summer Hunsaker and Brody Hunsaker). Finding the fixings for a full family dinner in the trash that squishes under her feet, Star gathers the children and starts her hitchhike home. Nobody stops for the unprepossessing threesome, but when a van full of rambunctious youth blasting hip-hop from the vehicle’s open window passes them, one of the passengers mooning the hitchhikers from the backseat while another one (the not-yet-identified Jake) gives Star an inviting look from the front, they follow the troupe to the local K-Mart.\n\nStar is captivated by the rowdy bunch, who spontaneously break into dance when contemporary pop star Rihanna’s upbeat “We Found Love” starts playing over the store’s loudspeakers. Exchanging a look and a smile with the ebullient Jake, whose glittery cell phone bounces out of his chest pocket while he pogo dances on the K-Mart checkout counter, she then follows this intriguing figure out into the parking lot. She returns his phone, and he offers her a job. Star initially declines Jake’s offer to join the traveling magazine crew, but after fending off her drunken father, who gropes her while she prepares the family’s evening meal, she hauls Kelsey and Rubin to the local roadhouse, where their mother is line dancing with a dozen or so country-western women, and abandons the kids with their incredulous mom.\n\nThe rest of the film narrates the adventures of Star and the mag crew as they make their way north through the U.S. heartland. The loosely scripted plot follows the team from Muskogee, Oklahoma, where they pick up Star, to the wealthy suburbs of Kansas City and from there to locations in Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota.\n\nAs the film progresses, we glean the sales team’s daily routine. The crew breaks into groups of two for the day. The van driver drops off the pairs in particular neighborhoods at the beginning of the day, each twosome goes door-to-door peddling magazine subscriptions to residents on its route, and the team reconvenes at the end of the day at a designated pick-up point for transportation back to the motel.\n\nArnold’s inspiration for the mag crew came from a 2007 New York Times article on the topic by Ian Urbina. The film incorporates many details of Urbina’s article, from the “violence, drug use, indebtedness and cheating of customers” to which many sellers interviewed by Urbina testify, to the weekly ritual called “Losers’ Night” in the film, when the two team members with the lowest sales are forced to fight each other.[2] Neither Urbina’s article nor Arnold’s film shies away from presenting the hardships and challenges that the itinerant sales associates face on a daily basis. However, both the journalist and the filmmaker also draw attention to the attraction that the freewheeling lifestyle of endless partying holds for many recruits, and the bonds that form among team members during their time together on the road. Urbina, for example, cites a 23-year-old former seller who talks openly about the sex, drugs, and alcohol that filled the mag crew’s nights. “But there’s more to crew than that,” this former seller insists. She recounts “having made some of her best friends, including her fiancÃ©, working on the crew.”[3] The film amply depicts the sales agents’ use of methamphetamine, marijuana, off-brand whisky, and cheap vodka, the sexual encounters that take place between team members, and the camaraderie that develops within the group. Even the anecdote about the young sales associate meeting her fiancÃ© in the mag crew is woven obliquely into the narrative.\n\nThe principal romantic relationship explored in the film is the one that develops between Star and Jake. Assigned to shadow the sales team’s power agent when she joins the group, the newcomer follows Jake door-to-door in order to learn the tricks of the trade. The two of them follow through on their mutual attraction, having sex on multiple occasions during their daily outings. However, Jake is wary of making their relationship public. Citing Krystal’s rule against relationships in the mag crew â a rule that Krystal does not apply to herself and Jake, as numerous scenes between the franchise owner and her boy toy render obvious â Jake informs Star that “this relationship thing with me and you [...] it’s not happening.” When Star asks Jake for clarification, he explains:\n\n“We just can’t talk about it ’cause it’s, um... She’s got this thing. She says, you know, love is bad for business. So there’s no relationships in the mag crew.”\n\nThe two lovers continue to pursue their relationship in fits and starts in the margins of the magazine crew, but they do so as discreetly as they can. Indeed, this on-again-off-again relationship constitutes the movie’s principal plotline, as Star and Jake negotiate their mutual affection, their insecurities and resentments, their jealousies, and their individual senses of self-interest and self-preservation. The film’s open-ended conclusion, in which the two lovers wordlessly reconcile following one of their serial fallings-out, leaves us wondering how the two of them might fare as a couple in the future. Their aspirations to buy a little house and settle down, which each expresses as an individual dream without explicitly naming the other as the envisioned partner in this idyllic future, remain an unfulfilled fantasy when the film reaches its narrative conclusion and the closing credits start flashing on the screen.\n\nPart of what makes this social drama/road movie-cum-coming-of-age/love story so captivating is the sense of authenticity exuded in the film. Although it is a fictional narrative with a plot, a screenplay of sorts, and paid actors playing imaginary characters in simulated situations, it feel like a slice of life recorded by a cinema journalist embedded in an actual mag crew. Cinematographer Robbie Ryan’s freeform handheld camerawork accounts in no small measure for the film’s quasi-documentary feel. So too do the true-to-life performances Arnold elicits from her troupe of mostly first-time actors. Many of these neophyte actors were selected for their socio-cultural proximity to the role they play in the film. The cast for the mag crew, lead actor Sasha Lane included, is comprised largely of nomadic young adults living on the fringes of society, whom Arnold recruited in shopping mall parking lots, at skate parks, and on public beaches â the very locations that informal employers such as mag-crew franchisees prowl to scout recruits.[4] Once she had assembled her largely street-cast troupe of actors and moved on to the shooting stage, Arnold refrained from giving cast members a complete film script. Rather than handing them a screenplay full of lines to memorize, the filmmaker passed the actors scene notes on the day of shooting.[5] The latter approach surely accounts to a large degree for the spontaneous feel of the onscreen interactions.\n\nI therefore find baffling Sight & Sound critic Simran Hans’s charge that “the dialogue is often unnaturally expositional.” I find no evidence of “the script’s [alleged] lack of subtlety.”[6] Like Variety’s Owen Gleiberman, I perceive the movie as “a bulletin â seductive, alarmed, fascinated â told from the inside.” “The film’s allure is that it’s not just a story, it’s an immersion,” Gleiberman writes, “a vÃ©ritÃ© rhapsody about the live pulse of kids in the age of corporate nihilism.”[7] Faced with the myriad decisions a filmmaker must make when directing a movie, Arnold opts in virtually every case for whatever casting strategy, shooting technique, or directorial approach might make the film look and feel more like a cinÃ©ma vÃ©ritÃ© documentary and less like a work of narrative fiction. The movie comes across as an audio-visual status report on the heart of the nation, as seen from the perspective of subaltern youth living on the margins of society.\n\nCritical reception\n\nMany reviewers lauded the film’s penetrating vision of contemporary youth culture. Tim Grierson, for example, writing in Rolling Stone, calls it “a Zeitgeist-y snapshot of youth culture.”[8] Carlos Aguilar, in Movie Maker, characterizes it as “a ravishing vision of youth adrift.”[9] Gleiberman, for his part, argues that it “takes the temperature of youth culture in a way that no movie has in years.”[10] Other critics praised the film for its sensitive portrayal of female sexuality. The movie presents “some of the most truthful, intimate and, importantly, erotic depictions of female sexuality” that Simran Hans, for example, has “seen on screen in a long time.”[11] [19] Still other reviewers, such as the New York Times’ Finn Cohen, admired the movie’s “portrayal of poverty in the United States and the country’s marginalized citizens.”[12] Pamela Hutchinson, writing in this vein, declares in her Sight & Sound review that “this brilliant film draws the outline of a bleak economic landscape.”[13]\n\nHowever, the film also had its detractors. Several critics objected to what they considered to be Arnold’s overbearing ideological perspective. Richard Brody, for instance, writing in the New Yorker, asserts that “Arnold doesn’t just depict characters in the fullness of their experience; she is brandishing an attitude.” In his opinion, the filmmaker\n\n“interposes that attitude between her characters and her viewers, filtering her characters’ voices out of the transaction; in effect, she speaks for them.”[14]\n\nIn a similar vein, Stephanie Zacharek, writing in Time, argues that\n\n“there’s a fine line between dramatizing human circumstances in a way that leaves us shaken or joyful, or both, and making a carefully calibrated sociology project. American Honey, its good intentions aside, tilts toward the latter.”[15]\n\nThis assessment, especially in Zacharek’s eloquent phrasing, has a grain of truth to it. Although some may argue, as Sean O’Hagan does in the Guardian, that “American Honey injects a visceral human element into the spaces where hard reporting doesn’t,” the film undoubtedly does have a political bias that it wears on its proverbial sleeve.[16]\n\nIs that necessarily a bad thing? Some of the great works in the history of cinema have been motivated by political passion. Leaving aside right-wing classics such as D. W. Griffith’s unabashedly racist The Birth of a Nation (1915) and John Ford’s arch-conservative The Searchers (1956), a short list of politically engaged films would include these:\n\nSergei Eisenstein’s avant-garde films of the 1920s,\n\nCharlie Chaplin’s class-conscious comedies of the 1910s and 1920s and his brilliant spoof of Hitler in The Great Dictator (1940),\n\nthe Marx brothers’ satire of fascism in Duck Soup (1933),\n\nStanley Kubrick’s critique of Cold Warriors in Dr. Strangelove (1964),\n\nSpike Lee’s dissection of racism in Do the Right Thing (1989),\n\nAlfonso CuarÃ³n’s allegory of the war on terror in Children of Men (2006), and\n\nSarah Gavron’s revisionist history of the British suffragettes in Suffragette (2015). [20, 21, 22]\n\nAmerican Honey is significantly more nuanced and subtle than any of those films.\n\nMoreover, although Arnold lays bare social inequalities in the contemporary United States, she is profoundly ambiguous in her portrayal of the mag crew. American Honey delineates a socially fractured culture without turning the outcasts into heroes, victims, or villains. The film narrative unfolds against the backdrop of a heartland that is depressingly bleak, even in the suburbs of the wealthy. At the same time, it captures a lack of cynicism in its young characters, despite the obvious hardships of their lives. The film succeeds in depicting both visions simultaneously, a rare achievement.\n\nAmerican Honey’s predecessors\n\nCritics have compared American Honey to a wide array of films. Titles mentioned include Dennis Hopper’s Easy Rider (1969), Sofia Coppola’s The Virgin Suicides (1993), Larry Clark’s Kids (1995), Ronald Bronstein’s Frownland (2007), Harmony Korine’s Spring Breakers (2012), and films by the likes of Gus Van Sant, Terrence Malick, Ken Loach, Alan Clarke, and the Dardenne brothers.\n\nArnold’s own films also present themselves openly. Although it is the British auteur’s first movie set and shot outside the United Kingdom, American Honey shows marked thematic and stylistic continuities with her other works. Gracefully shot by Robbie Ryan, all of Arnold’s films center on assertive yet vulnerable women, all of them are class conscious, and they all have a strong sense of place.\n\nThey also return obsessively to animal imagery. From the eponymous insect in Wasp (2003) to the fish in Fish Tank (2009) and the countless cut-away shots of birds and bugs in American Honey, Arnold’s films exhibit a sustained fascination with wildlife. This recurrent motif creates a dual effect in Arnold’s work. On the one hand, it serves a vaguely narrative function. American Honey, for instance, wordlessly concludes with Star setting free a turtle that Jake gave her. The scurrying reptile metaphorically evokes Star’s own prospective liberation while simultaneously communicating something about the young woman’s personality: she is someone who sets animals free. On the other hand, the objective neutrality of Ryan’s wandering camera, combined with the director’s knack for eliciting remarkably naturalistic performances from her actors, has the effect of creating an audio-visual equivalence between the human characters and the other animals that appear in the field of the moving image. Star and her peers are as natural onscreen as a moth fluttering against a window curtain, birds taking flight, or a turtle plunging into a pond.\n\nA very different sort of beast appears in another film that bears comparison to American Honey. Like Arnold’s coming-of-age road movie, Matthew Bright’s Freeway (1996), starring a very young Reese Witherspoon, addresses class and features a road trip by a resilient teenage girl. The film explicitly presents itself as a retelling of Little Red Riding Hood, with the Reese Witherspoon character fleeing from a Big Bad Wolf played by an utterly repugnant Kiefer Sutherland. This intertextual reference to a familiar story suggests yet another parallel with American Honey, which Pamela Hutchinson felicitously suggests is a retelling of The Wizard of Oz.\n\nPost-Recession fictions\n\nIn her review of the film in Sight & Sound, Hutchinson compares Star to the iconic Middle American country girl immortalized by Judy Garland in Victor Fleming’s 1939 MGM classic: “With dreadlocks for pigtails and a rucksack instead of a pinafore, Star is a new Dorothy.”[17] In Hutchinson’s interpretation, the mag crew collectively incarnates this new Dorothy’s traveling companions, Krystal plays the part of the Wicked Witch, and “Jake is both a companion and the cyclone, whisking Star into a new world.”[18] One might quibble with the details of Hutchinson’s comparison, emphasizing, for instance, the contrast between the original Dorothy’s efforts to get back to her little house on the prairie and her beloved Aunt Em and Uncle Henry, on the one hand, and Star’s lack of desire to return to her abusive father’s ramshackle bungalow, on the other hand, but quibbles of this sort do not detract from the power of Hutchinson’s insight. The juxtaposition of the two tales of wide-eyed Midwestern teenage girls leaving home and discovering a wild and wonderful world they did not know existed is evocative indeed.\n\nMoreover, as if to buttress Hutchinson’s interpretation, QT (Veronica Ezell), a butch crewmember with a half-shaved head, calls out the title of Fleming’s film and the name of the Wizard of Oz heroine when they arrive in Kansas City roughly half an hour into the film. “Holy shit. Look at those fucking buildings,” the awe-struck QT says as the Kansas City skyline comes into view. “Wizard of Oz. Dorothy,” she continues. “I ain’t never seen so many train tracks in my life.” Although QT’s reaction here is more akin to that of the Oz travelers when they arrive at the Emerald City than their hypothetical response to arriving in a mundane place like the Kansas of The Wizard of Oz, her exclamation invites us to draw connections between the two stories.\n\nIn his moving analysis of the MGM classic, Salman Rushdie makes three observations that are particularly pertinent to thinking about the relation of American Honey to The Wizard of Oz. First, he remarks that all the powerful characters in Oz are women. The wizard’s powers turn out to be illusory, and “it’s impossible to see the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and Cowardly Lion as classic Hollywood leading men.”[19] Glinda and the Wicked Witch “are the only two symbols of power in a film which is largely about the powerless.”[20] Second, Rushdie observes, “The Wizard of Oz is a film whose driving force is the inadequacy of adults, even good adults.”[21] Finally, the author brilliantly argues that, contrary to what the movie’s screenwriters would have us believe, The Wizard of Oz is a celebration of leaving home, not returning to it. He submits as evidence “Over the Rainbow,” the movie’s signature song:\n\n“Anybody who has swallowed the scriptwriters’ notion that this is a film about the superiority of ‘home’ over ‘away’ [...] would do well to listen to the yearning in Judy Garland’s voice, as her face tilts towards the skies. What she expresses here [...] is the human dream of leaving.”[22]\n\nAll of these observations find parallels in Arnold’s film. The adults we encounter in American Honey are harmless at best, dangerous at worst. Without an adult role model, Star, like her MGM predecessor, “[takes] control of her own destiny” and “begins the process of becoming a grown-up herself.”[23] American Honey is also a film in which women are more powerful than the men. Despite his prowess as a salesman and a seducer, Jake is Krystal’s lackey. Whatever freedom he achieves from her over the course of the film is much more attenuated (and much more ambiguous) than the independence that Star asserts, right from the beginning, from the domineering mag-crew owner. Finally, with the exception of a single phone call that Star makes from the road to check in on Kelsey and Rubin, the teenager shows no concern for the home she leaves behind. Even more resolutely than its filmic intertext, American Honey is a celebration of \"the human dream of leaving.\"\n\nWhat Rushdie’s analysis does not touch on is the socio-economic subtext of Oz. This omission is not surprising. Although the film’s depiction of life on the Kansas prairie is reminiscent of the Depression-era documentary photographs that Walker Evans, Dorothea Lang, and their colleagues took in the 1930s for President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s Farm Security Administration program, the movie downplays the social dimensions of its source material. As numerous critics have argued, L. Frank Baum’s The Wonderful Wizard of Oz allegorizes economic and political developments that unfolded on a national scale during the years just prior to the book’s publication in 1900. The film, released in 1939, does not engage in a similar process relative to the events of the Great Depression.\n\nIdeologically, Arnold’s film reworks Baum’s book more than Fleming’s adaptation. Both American Honey and The Wonderful Wizard of Oz transpose the economic downturn of their day into narrative form. Let us take a moment to examine how Baum’s post-crisis novel and Arnold’s post-recession film make this transposition.\n\nIn an influential article from 1964, Henry Littlefield makes the case that the characters in Baum’s Wonderful Wizard of Oz represent specific people or social groups in turn-of-the-century political culture. The Scarecrow, for instance, metaphorically represents the Midwestern farmers who were going through a particularly difficult period in the late nineteenth century due largely to a monetary policy that favored the interests of Wall Street over those of Main Street. The Tin Woodman, in turn, represents industrial laborers, who were also in an embattled position at the close of the century, while the Cowardly Lion is a stand-in for William Jennings Bryan, the Democratic Representative from Nebraska and three-time presidential candidate, who unsuccessfully campaigned on a populist platform defending the working classes from the predations of bankers and industrialists. In this allegorical tale, the Wizard “might be any President from Grant to McKinley.”[24] An ineffectual puppet that wields no real power, he is beholden to the Wicked Witches of the East and West, the novel’s real power mongers, who function metaphorically, in Baum’s tale, as the capitalists on the coasts. Dorothy, finally, “is Baum’s Miss Everyman.”[25]\n\nIn “Setting the Standards on the Road to Oz” (1991), Mitch Sanders pushes this allegorical interpretation further. The central event allegorized in The Wonderful World of Oz, according to Sanders, is the so-called “battle of the standards” of the late nineteenth century. Reminding his reader that the United States was just emerging from the grips of a severe economic depression when Baum’s novel appeared at the turn of the century, Sanders recounts that the downturn of the 1890s was due principally to two factors.\n\nOn the one hand, “competition and technological advances drove down [commodity] prices” while, on the other hand, the scarcity of gold (the principal basis for the world’s money at the time) functioned as a bulwark against inflation.[26] The deflationary pressure created by these two circumstances worked decidedly to debtors’ disadvantage. If, in 1880, a farmer needed to sell, say, 800 bushels of wheat in order to repay a debt, Sanders explains, that same farmer would need to sell twice as much grain to repay the debt if the price dropped by 50 percent (which is precisely what happened in the early 1890s). In times of inflation, creditors can raise interest rates to compensate for a drop in currency value, but no such protection exists for debtors if prices decline. As long as gold remained the only money standard, farmers and workers would be caught in a financial predicament from which they would have great difficulty extricating themselves. It is in this context that William Jennings Bryan proposed restoring silver “as a freely coined monetary standard alongside gold.”[27]\n\nBryan’s political rival, the Republican William McKinley, ran a campaign based on maintaining the gold standard in order to stave off inflation. Bryan managed to convince the majority of Midwestern farmers (the scarecrows) of his position, but he was unable to persuade a sufficient number of industrial laborers (the tin woodmen) that he was fighting for their interests. McKinley won the presidential elections of both 1896 and 1900, furthering the cause of the capitalists at the expense of the working classes.\n\nIn the novel, Sanders argues, the yellow brick road, the perilous path that Dorothy and her companions follow to Emerald City, represents the gold standard. It leads to the nation’s glittering capital, where a charlatan figurehead promises everything to everyone, but in fact can deliver nothing. The silver shoes, by contrast (ruby slippers in the film), have magical powers. “By using the silver shoes,” Sanders comments, “Dorothy accomplishes her goal quite easily. Similarly, Populists believed that silver money could cure most of the ills of U.S. society. In reality and in literature,” Sanders concludes, “silver served the interests of common, everyday people.”[28]\n\nThe nineteenth-century “battle of the standards” might seem arcane in the early twenty-first century. It is essentially a form of class warfare, with Bryan taking the side of debtors (the poor) and McKinley siding with creditors (the rich). Battles of this sort take different forms at different times in the history of capitalism. The most spectacular recent iteration is undoubtedly the national bailout of Wall Street banks with taxpayer money in 2008. The capitalists’ cause was advanced, in the latter case, not by maintaining a single monetary standard but more nakedly, by using hundreds of billions of tax dollars to buy “toxic assets” that remained on the banks’ books following the collapse of the mortgage bond market in 2007â08. The government that, for decades, had been arguing that it could not afford to subsidize healthcare, daycare, afterschool programs for kids, free high-quality Kâ12 education for everyone, adequate benefits to war veterans, or a public university system that would enable people to get a college education without accumulating mountains of debt, suddenly produced, in the blink of an eye, the equivalent of nearly 5 percent of U.S. gross domestic product in order to bail out the institutions that had swindled countless investors of their savings.\n\nAmerican Honey appeared in the aftermath of this fiasco. In contrast to films like J.C. Chandor’s Margin Call (2011) and Adam McKay’s The Big Short (2015), which depict the meltdown from the perspective of Wall Street bankers and hedge fund managers, movies such as Jason Reitman’s Up in the Air (2009) and John Wells’s The Company Men (2010), which transpose the financial crisis onto fictional narratives of embattled business executives, or films like David Cronenberg’s Cosmopolis (2012) and Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street (2013), which allegorize the meltdown via a central character that personifies the self-destructive economic system, Arnold’s film centers on people at the bottom of the social scale. It resembles, in this regard, Ramin Bahrani’s 99 Homes (2015), which chronicles the fate of a family evicted from their foreclosed home in the wake of the housing market’s collapse, and even more closely, Sean Baker’s The Florida Project (2017), a mesmerizing account of a little girl, her neighborhood friends, and her menially self-employed mother living in a residential roadside motel in a nondescript suburb of Orlando, Florida.\n\nLike The Florida Project, American Honey is not a film about the financial crisis per se. It bears witness to the effects of the crash without thematizing the meltdown itself. It is an example of what Kirk Boyle and Daniel Mrozowski call the “twenty-first-century bust culture” in their introduction to The Great Recession in Fiction, Film, and Television.[29] The movie obliquely documents the effects of the financial collapse rather than allegorizing, fictionalizing, or frontally depicting its causes. The itinerant magazine crew â a cross-section of informally employed youth surviving the post-recession the best they can â epitomizes this twenty-first-century “bust culture.” So too, in her own way, does the self-righteous upper-class mother who reluctantly invites Star and Jake into her picture-perfect home toward the beginning of the film; and so, in a quite different way, does the stoned meth head lying zonked out on the couch while Star chats with her unsupervised children at the end of the film.\n\n“No place like home”\n\nLet us first examine the encounter with the sanctimonious upper-crust mother. The scene is set in the wealthy suburb of Mission Hills, located just west of Kansas City. Our introduction to the place takes the form of a four-and-a-half-minute driving tour filmed from inside the van that transports the mag crew from their dilapidated motel on the outskirts of town to the posh residential area on the Kansas-Missouri border. It begins with a traveling shot of an ostentatious stone fountain resembling the Moderno fountain in St. Peter’s Square â this one adorning a suburban traffic circle rather than the main plaza of Vatican City. “Look at the water fountain, the fucking water fountain,” QT says in a fake British accent, mimicking the snobs that might live in the neighborhood surrounding this faux European monument.\n\nThe van then moves block by block past rows of well-maintained and immaculately landscaped mansions. The gobsmacked crewmembers can barely believe their eyes. “Holy shit,” QT exclaims as they pass a massive stone Cape Cod house on a corner lot. “Dude, that fucking place is sick,” Corey (McCaul Lombardi) opines as the van cruises past a huge Georgian Revival with a U-shaped driveway. “Look at that house down there,” QT says as she points to a modern-day chÃ¢teau on an oversized lot. The only one in the group that does not seem to be impressed by all this opulence is Shaunte (Shawna Rae Moseley), who unambiguously states her opinion of Mission Hills: “Fuck this place. That’s what I got to say.”\n\nShaunte’s appreciation here of Mission Hills is not entirely unlike the one expressed by Thomas Frank in his dissection of Middle American conservatism in What’s the Matter with Kansas? This illustrious suburb with its “two square miles of rolling, landscaped exquisiteness” is “by far the richest town in Kansas and, indeed, one of the richest in the country,” Frank reports. However, he continues, “to call it a town, while technically correct, is misleading. Mission Hills has three country clubs and a church but no businesses of any kind.” Nor does it have “buses, commuter trains, or even proper sidewalks, in most places.”[30] A nearly completely privatized constellation of magnificent estates with virtually no communal spaces or public services, Mission Hills is a testament to the concentration of wealth in the hands of people who have divested from the public good. It is as though Shaunte intuits that the place is designed to exclude people like her. Although she mentions none of the suburb’s attributes, her hostile reaction to the place underscores the sharp class division between the traveling mag crew and the upper-class residents of this super-rich suburb.\n\nIt is into this privatized paradise that Star and Jake venture on her first day on the job. The film condenses the day’s sales calls into a single scene, which begins with a scruffy Jake and a bedraggled Star lifting a big brass horse-head shaped doorknocker and rapping it against a massive wooden door. Jake previously explained his sales technique to Star:\n\n“Basically, as soon as they open that door and look at you, that’s the critical moment. ’Cause in that second you got to work them, you got to read them, you got to be able to scan them and figure them out, figure what kind of person that person wants in their life. Then you got to be that person.”\n\nWhen a girl in her early teens (played by Kaylin Mally) opens the door, Jake immediately sets to work. After a quick introduction, he asks the girl to feel the sleeve of his sport coat and to guess what kind of material it is made of. “That’s boyfriend material,” he tells the mystified girl. “Genuine boyfriend.” The teenager’s smile and giggles indicate that Jake is right on the mark. What this pubescent girl wants from the mysterious stranger at the door is for him to flirt with her. When the girl’s mother (Laura Kirk) then joins her daughter at the door, Jake instantly switches gears. Without missing a beat, he informs the skeptical looking woman that he and Star are “part of the Three Cs contest, which is a collegiate communications competition.” What this woman wants, Jake decides in a flash, is to support an ambitious college student.\n\nThe tactic works. The mistrustful woman stands in her doorway, frowning at the unsightly twosome with her hand on the doorframe as if barring entry into her domestic enclave, but when Jake asks her if she could spare a glass of water for two thirsty travelers, she agrees to let them in “just for a moment” so that they can “tell [her] about the contest.” Jake delivers a perfectly honed sales pitch, explaining that if the homemaker picks two items from a list of magazines, “that will go a huge way to making [his] dreams a reality.” “When I get to 100,000 points,” he expounds, “and I’m at like 88,000 now, I get a free year of school.” The spiel appeals to the woman’s sense of charity while subtly buttressing her implicit worldview. In effect, Jake offers the smug suburbanite an opportunity to atone for her inordinate wealth by sharing a minuscule portion of her fortune with an aspiring university student who is pulling himself up by his proverbial bootstraps.\n\nJake appears to be moving toward closing the sale when Star, who has been witnessing the exchange between the smooth-talking salesman and his mark, sabotages the transaction. Contradicting one after another of Jake’s assertions, she finally tells her partner to “go fuck [himself].” This is the last straw for the self-righteous housewife. “I have been trying to be Christian,” she informs her visitors, “but I can see that the devil has a hold of the two of you.” Star retorts that, in her opinion, the devil has a hold of the homemaker’s daughter, who has been putting on a provocative dance performance, presumably for Jake’s benefit, outside the living room window. “Destiny, turn off the music and put some clothes on!” the mother shrieks at her scantily clad daughter as Star and Jake make their way to the front door and slip back out into the tree-lined street.\n\nThe cultural clash between this paragon of domesticity and piety, on the one hand, and the nomadic heathens, on the other, harks back to the movie’s opening sequence, when a lone woman in a mini-van honks at Star and her two wards instead of picking up the hitchhiking threesome. [50] “I hope He comes all over your car!” Star yells at the passing vehicle in response to the proclamation that “God is coming” plastered in iridescent letters across the van’s rear window.\n\nAs Frank’s treatise on the culture wars that have consumed Kansas for the past few decades brings into relief, religious self-righteousness, whether heartfelt and genuine or cynical and opportunistic, is one of the hallmarks of the Sunflower State. Kansas is home not only to Koch Industries, the mega-corporation run by the notorious Koch brothers, who played a considerable role in pulling the country “to the right, to the right, farther to the right.”[31] It is also home to one David Bawden, a devout Catholic who, in 1990, believing that all the popes since Vatican II were heretical and therefore illegitimate, “called a papal election, and got himself chosen pope: Pope Michael I.”[32] This election of Pope Michael of Kansas, conducted in a thrift store owned by Bawden’s father and unanimously endorsed by all five (yes, five) participants in the conclave, is a quintessentially Kansan phenomenon, in Frank’s opinion. The state “is a magnet for the preternaturally pious, for every stripe of Christian holy man from the hermetic to the prophetic to the theocratic.”[33]\n\nHowever, while the dialogue emphasizes the culture clash between the reverent housewife and her irreverent guests, the mise-en-scÃ¨ne brings into relief the class difference that separates the two parties. The camera’s fixation on Star when she and Jake enter into the Mission Hills mansion captures the young woman’s reaction to this unfamiliar environment. Instead of engaging with her interlocutor, Star scans her surroundings, taking in the crystal chandelier hanging from the fourteen-foot ceiling above her head and the charmingly appointed parlor off to the right of the palatial foyer.\n\nWhen the homemaker tells her guests to “excuse the mess,” the apology therefore comes across like a bad joke. The mess in question consists of a mound of presents on the living-room coffee table â remnants, the mother explains, of her daughter’s birthday party. A close-up of this tabletop contrasts pointedly with a similar shot from earlier in the film. Whereas one shot depicts jewelry in a little velvet-lined box, an electronic device in its original packaging, a framed photo-portrait, crumpled wrapping paper, and party favors piled on the table’s surface, the other shows an overflowing ashtray and crushed beer cans sitting on the living-room coffee table in the tumbledown bungalow that Kelsey, Rubin, Star, and their alcoholic father called home. These contrasting close-ups visually distil, for the spectator, the disjunction between Star’s world and the one she enters in Mission Hills. As the memorable line from The Wizard of Oz would have it, this land of golf courses and gaudy mansions is “no place like home.”\n\nHow the other 99 percent lives\n\nAs Frank explains, Mission Hills has been a wealthy suburb since it was first developed in the early twentieth century. However, it is only in the past few decades that the place has veritably separated itself from the rest of the state. Through the 1970s, Frank recounts, Mission Hills was a place “where one found Pontiacs and riding lawn mowers and driveway basketball courts and even the occasional ranch house with an asphalt roof.” Many of the neighborhood’s historic mansions were still standing, but they “were now overgrown with vines and invisible from the street thanks to shrubbery and weeds that had been neglected for years.”[34] Since the 1980s, many of the grand old houses and the more modest post-War homes have been knocked down and replaced with brand-new mega-mansions of one style or another. Frank recognizes that this sort of transformation is by no means unique to Mission Hills. “You can observe the same changes in Shaker Heights or La Jolla or Winnetka or Ann Coulter’s hometown of New Canaan, Connecticut.” What these changes reflect, in the Midwestern historian’s view, is “the simplest and hardest of economic realities: The fortunes of Mission Hills rise and fall in inverse proportion to the fortunes of ordinary working people.”[35]\n\nThis mini-history of Mission Hills and Frank’s interpretation of the changes he describes call to mind the central argument of economist Thomas Piketty’s Capital in the Twenty-First Century. Since roughly 1980, Piketty demonstrates, the distribution of global wealth, which had been at its most equitable level in recorded economic history during the previous three or four decades, has been following a trend toward ever-greater inequality. If the world continues on its current trajectory, Piketty warns, the gap between the wealthiest people on the planet and the rest of the world’s population will soon be wider than it has ever been. Already, the economist reports, the United States has “a record level of inequality of income from labor (probably higher than in any other society at any time in the past, anywhere in the world).”[36]\n\nAmerican Honey gives audio-visual form to this state of affairs. As the mag crew’s journey progresses through the heartland, the people they encounter become poorer and poorer. The crew’s final stop, in the movie’s penultimate sequence, takes us into the lower depths of this Middle American social landscape. Like in the Mission Hills sequence, our introduction to the impoverished community on the outskirts of Rapid City, South Dakota, takes the form of a driving tour. Automobiles in various states of repair stand in front of trailers and ramshackle bungalows, trash and discarded toys litter residents’ front yards, windows are covered with sheets of translucent plastic, a satellite dish adorns a family’s front porch, and everywhere adults congregate in driveways while children play in inflatable pools. Whereas there is not a resident in sight in Mission Hills, here the whole neighborhood seems to be out in public. We seem to have landed in a different world from the Oz-like archipelago of mega-mansions.\n\nHutchinson suggests that this arrival in Rapid City is American Honey’s version of Dorothy’s return home. Rather than actually going back to the home she left at the beginning of the film, Star finds “a place just like it, an emerald-painted house where the neglected children of an addict mother play unsupervised and the fridge is all but empty.”[37] If anything, the household that Star visits at the end of the movie is even worse off than the one she left. Whereas the refrigerator at Star’s house was stocked with provisions scavenged from dumpsters, this one contains a take-out pizza box, a nearly empty bottle of ketchup, and a two-liter bottle of Mountain Dew. Seeing the abject conditions in which these children are living, Star falls back into her role as caretaker and provider. Instead of trying to sell these penniless kids magazine subscriptions, she goes out and buys them groceries.\n\nAs in the two previous glimpses into a family’s domestic space, here again, the scene contains a close-up of a particular detail that crystallizes the family’s social situation. [59] At the foot of the couch where the mother lies comatose while her children offer the visitor a mug of Mountain Dew and sing her their favorite Dead Kennedys song, a ziplock dime bag full of white powder lies next to a glass pipe. Whereas Kelsey, Rubin, and Star had an alcoholic father, these children have a meth-addicted mother.\n\nAs this circular Wizard of Oz-like structure suggests, there is this little forward narrative progression in American Honey. Star metaphorically ends up more or less where she started. The dissimilar social circumstances that the film depicts as the mag crew travels through the Midwest attest to geographical variations, not historical or narrative changes. What the film communicates is a snapshot of a particular region at a given moment in time. It is if Arnold set out to use the format of the feature film to document the state of the heartland in the early twenty-first century. The plot feels secondary to the imagery. Rather than using the heartland as a backdrop for a coming-of-age story, one senses that Arnold used the story as pretext for examining the region.\n\nThe wolf of Walmart\n\nThe particular moment captured in this class-conscious road movie is the mid-2010s. Writing in the New York Times two days before the film’s theatrical release in the United States â which is to say, two days after the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump â Finn Cohen situates American Honey in relation to this context:\n\n“It’s not a political film, per se, but it is difficult not to view it as prescient [...] as the surreal American election barrels tumultuously toward a conclusion.”[38]\n\nIn this light, Jake’s self-characterization as being “Donald Trump-ish” invites comment. [60] Although this Trump reference is a throwaway remark, which Jake makes self-mockingly in reference to his oversized pinstripe trousers rather than his inner character, it reveals more about the small-time con artist than he perhaps intends. If, as Amanda Marcotte contends in Troll Nation, the sitting president is “the platonic idea of a successful con man,” so too, in his own way, is the mag crew’s power agent.[39] Like the title characters of Dan Gilroy’s Nightcrawler (2014) and Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street, Jake cuts a Trump-like figure. He is not only a self-important businessman, albeit on an infinitesimally smaller scale than the current Wolf of Washington, and a compulsive liar to boot. He is also a relentless salesman, who does not take “no” for an answer. As Trump baldly explains in his ghost written memoire, The Art of the Deal,\n\n“My style of deal-making is quite simple and straightforward. I aim very high, and then I just keep pushing and pushing and pushing to get what I’m after.”[40]\n\nSince 2017, the world has had the opportunity to see how this approach to deal making works in the realm of international politics. The film depicts how it might be applied to the unglamorous art of selling magazine subscriptions.\n\nJake is not the only “Trump-ish” figure in the film. Krystal also bears a certain family resemblance to the 45th president. The rallying chant that she has the crew sing before setting out for the day could come right out of Trump’s mouth. “I said, one, two, three, four, five. This loser ain’t got no job,” the crewmembers chant in reference to the fate that will await them if they do not make quota. [62, 63] The refrain calls to mind the famous tagline of The Apprentice, the reality TV show hosted by Trump between 2004 and 2015: “You’re fired,” the talk-show host serially informs the episode’s designated “losers” with smug self-satisfaction.\n\nColor blindness in the age of MAGA\n\nTrump is, of course, not only an imposing businessman and celebrity television host turned president. He is also the most unabashed racist to have occupied the White House in generations. This is a man who calls immigrants “invaders,” Muslims “terrorists,” and Mexicans “rapists.” The endorsement he received from the Ku Klux Klan speaks volumes about his racial politics. The candidate’s reluctance to repudiate this endorsement makes the 1927 arrest of his father, Fred Trump, at a KKK rally in New York City seem more than anecdotal.[41] In case anyone had lingering doubts about the president’s sympathies or allegiances, his refusal to denounce the “very fine people,” as he called them, that descended on Charlottesville, Virginia, brandishing swastikas, Confederate flags, and “Trump/Pence” signs for a Unite the Right rally in August 2017, even after one of the demonstrators drove his car into a crowd of counter-protestors, killing one person and injuring 19 others in the process, should set the record straight.[42] Trump has arguably done more to inflame racial hatred on a national scale than any U.S. citizen in living memory. Decades of social progress have been reversed at an alarming speed since he took office in 2017. “Make America Great Again” (abbreviated to “MAGA”), the Trump campaign slogan that has become a rallying cry for his supporters in the so-called “alt-right,” is a dog-whistle call to return the country to the pre-Civil Rights era.\n\nIn this context, casting “Miss Everyman” (as Littlefield’s awkward phrase would have it) as a woman of color comes across as an intervention in the racial politics that have taken on a renewed urgency in the past few years. Arnold’s decision to have a mixed-race twenty-year-old with dreadlocks play the part of the new Dorothy hardly seems incidental. This iconic figure embodies a potent counter-image to the popular image of the heartland as “buffered and all-American: white, rural, full of aging churchgoers, conservative voters, corn, and pigs.”[43] As Kristin Hoganson writes in The Heartland: An American History, “the heartland serves as a symbolic center in national mythologies.” U.S. citizens, she writes, “may not agree on who they are as a whole, but they think they know the nature of their heart. Local. Insulated. Exceptionalist. Isolationist. Provincial.”[44] American Honey proposes a counter-myth to this myth of heartland as an all-white bastion of racial purity. Star is a decidedly multicultural metonymy for the Middle West.\n\nHowever, although Star’s screen presence in every scene of American Honey beckons the viewer to consider the state of race relations in the age of MAGA, the screenplay is curiously silent on the subject. Visually, race is front and center in this moving-picture snapshot of Middle America; narratively and thematically, it is conspicuously absent.\n\nRather than faulting Arnold for failing to probe the racial issues that her film raises, I see the film’s near silence on the subject as one of its strengths. American Honey expressly represents race as a non-issue, not by omission but by a glaringly obvious inclusion that it refrains from overtly thematizing.\n\nThe film’s conspicuous down playing of racial differences takes diverse forms. Imitating the African-American rappers that they listen to as they travel around the heartland, for instance, the white crewmembers use a derivation of the N-word to refer to one another. The term is devoid of injurious connotations in their lexicon. They use it as a term of endearment, not a racial slur, but the word resonates differently when they apply it to the brown-skinned Star and when they use it to refer to one another. Neither Star nor her peers seem to notice this incongruity. The crew appears to have become post-racial to the point of no longer distinguishing at all between people on the basis of race.\n\nConversely, the white descriptors that Krystal uses to refer to Star when the two women first meet also pass without comment. “You must be the little redneck Jake found,” Krystal says in lieu of introduction when she first meets Star. When the roadside recruit tells her new boss that she is from Texas, the crew owner continues in this vein: “So you’re a Southern girl, a real American honey like me.” The latter clause makes reference to the song that gives the film its title, Lady Antebellum’s 2010 country music hit, “American Honey,” which we hear at full volume in a sing-along toward the end of the film. [67] The movie title comes, in sum, from a ditty about a Southern belle, written and performed in one of the few genres of homegrown U.S. popular music that did not originate in African-American communities by a band whose name conjures the pre-Civil War era. The title of this quintessentially white song is then used, in the film, to refer to both a Caucasian woman played by Elvis Presley’s granddaughter and another woman of African and MÄori descent. It is as if Krystal is blind to Star’s skin color, to the extent that she would use such a racially loaded expression to refer indifferently to herself and her dreadlocked employee.\n\nKrystal’s color blindness when she meets Star is particularly surprising given the crew owner’s implicit nostalgia for the Old South. This nostalgia, subtly evoked in her initial exchange with Star, leaps off the screen in a later scene, when Krystal summons the new recruit to her motel room for a tongue-lashing. Krystal is upset that Jake, who has been training Star for the past few days, has stopped making money. She wants to know why. As she grills her defensive subordinate, Krystal stands up from the bed where she has been counting money, calls Jake out of the bathroom, and instructs him to apply self-tanning lotion to her legs. The medium long shot of Krystal standing in front of the bathroom mirror, Jake slathering her thighs with lotion as she threatens Star with dismissal, encapsulates the power dynamic among the three figures while providing a striking portrait of the mag-crew owner. Essential to this portrait is the costume Krystal is wearing. Clad in a skimpy bikini with a Confederate-flag motif, Krystal is portrayed here not only as a dominatrix and a taskmaster, but also as a woman who harbors a nostalgia for the era when African Americans in the Southern states had the legal status of personal property.\n\nThis arresting shot of Krystal in her Rebel-flag bikini recalls a scene from earlier in the film, when Star’s dad, Nathan (Johnny Pierce II), a gaunt white man in his late thirties, molests Star while she prepares dinner. As he forces his daughter to dance with him, hugging her tightly, squeezing her rear end, and licking her neck while she cries silently to herself, we see a Confederate banner hanging over a window in the background. The appearance here of the Stars and Bars is even more disturbing than the presence of the motif on Krystal’s bikini in the later scene. It raises a multitude of unanswered questions about the relationship between Star’s neo-Confederate father and her absent mother, what it must have been like for the mixed-race girl to have grown up with a presumably racist dad, and what it must be like for her to continue to share a house with this presumptive bigot. By silently incorporating the Rebel flag into the mise-en-scÃ¨ne of the family living room, the film forcefully beckons the viewer to ask herself a welter of questions that it refrains from answering.\n\nThe film is intentionally vague about the family Star is fleeing from. Is the man in the bungalow who encroaches on her sexually her father? She refers to him as “dad,” but the movie does not spell out whether he is her biological father or her stepfather. Are the children Star cares for her half-siblings, and the woman dancing at the bar their mother? Where is Star’s biological mother? The movie leaves all these questions unanswered, but it strongly implies that the family Star is fleeing from is not only sexually abusive but also incestuous.\n\nThe interaction between Star and Nathan recalls the relationship between Mia (Katie Jarvis), the headstrong fifteen-year-old protagonist of Fish Tank, and Conor (Michael Fassbender), Mia’s mother’s freewheeling boyfriend, who seduces the teenage heroine midway through the film. Nathan is like a charmless version of the charming Conor. However, in contrast to Fish Tank, which clarifies the relationships among the characters, American Honey obscures the details of Star’s family situation.\n\nStraight eye for the queer guy\n\nArnold is equally elusive in her representation of queerness. Gender relations constitute one of the film’s central themes. Star’s numerous encounters with men â from the early scene of her fending off her amorous father (if that’s what he is) through her hair-raising brush with a trio of middle-aged cowboys, her encounter with an oilrig operator who pays her $1,000 in exchange for sexual favors, and the vicissitudes of her tumultuous relationship with Jake â form integral components of this coming-of-age story. In Amanda Greer’s opinion, Arnold’s finesse in depicting these encounters makes American Honey “one of the most sensitive portrayals of female sexuality on-screen”:\n\n“Star’s sexuality, both as she asserts it and as it’s forced out of her by others, has an Alice Munro-esque sensitivity to it; she blurs the line between pleasure and survival in an honest, breathtaking way.”[45]\n\nHowever, while Star’s sexual relations with men form the movie’s dramatic center of gravity, gay sexuality, which the film weaves into the narrative insistently but with little ado, is so conspicuously undeveloped that this underdevelopment becomes significant in its own right.\n\nThe prime of example here is the relationship between JJ (Raymond Coalson) and Riley (Christopher David Wright). Despite Krystal’s rule against relationships in the mag crew, numerous crewmembers hook up with each other on the sly. A cut-away shot of Katness (Crystal Ice) straddling one of her male peers on the steps of a motel in the wee hours of the night shows an escapade of this sort. A pan from a bonfire to a view JJ and Riley making out against the side of the van on Losers’ Night depicts another. Both of these amorous encounters appear in the field of the moving image with little fanfare. Affecting a perspective of observational detachment, the film treats one encounter as no more or less remarkable than the other. However, JJ and Riley’s relationship is more than a casual hook-up. In direct contravention of Krystal’s policy, the two men form a couple, and they do so openly, in plain sight of the crew. They are unique in this regard. JJ and Riley are the only lovers in the mag crew that are open about their relationship, and nobody seems to care.\n\nIt is not only the crewmembers that show little concern for the status of JJ and Riley’s relationship. The film does not seem to care either. We learn of the lovers’ status incidentally, as the camera follows Star from room to room one night while she looks for Jake. As she shines a flashlight on one bed after another in search of her lover, a point-of-view shot pans from a view of Kalium (Isaiah Stone) asleep on the floor to an image of Riley and JJ lying in bed in each other’s arms. Once again, Arnold communicates this narrative information with little to-do, as an unremarkable element of the mise-en-scÃ¨ne, not even worthy of comment.\n\nThis nonchalance in depicting gay sexuality is, in turn, extended from Arnold’s portrayal of the mag crew to her representation of the larger culture delineated in the film. Although JJ expresses concern that he might “get shot” when he sees all the “redneck trucks” in Williston, North Dakota, his exchange with a driver at a truck stop outside of Williston suggests that he has nothing to fear. “You can help us out with the, you know, the gay club fee and shit,” the young salesman says to the trucker. [76] The pitch works: the driver hands over $20 to the affable teen. JJ’s passing comment here, to which the film draws surprisingly little attention, is highly suggestive. A truck stop in rural North Dakota is not the first place one might to think to look for openness and inclusiveness on matters of non-hetero-normative sexuality, nor is it the most obvious location to choose if one were a filmmaker looking for a milieu representative of such attitudes.\n\nClass and culture\n\nThe film’s intentional downplaying of both racial differences and matters of sexual orientation calls for comment. The movie does not overtly criticize racism or homophobia. Rather, it casts race and sexual preference as non-issues. This approach is far from innocent. It dismisses out of hand the cultural conservatives and members of the radical right for whom these issues are of vital importance. In addition to discriminating against virtually every non-European ethnic group, the alt-right also has a strong homophobic streak.[46] By going out of its way to present race and sexual preference as irrelevant or inconsequential, American Honey subtly erodes these cornerstones of the alt-right worldview. Instead of decrying bigotry or denouncing homophobia, Arnold presents a world in which discrimination against people of color and LGBTQ+ folks has no place.\n\nArnold’s vision of a racially and sexually fluid youth culture fairly represents the dominant attitudes of a generation. According to estimates, roughly three-fourths of millennials support gay marriage, and they “are everywhere asserting their right to [...] have all their heritages respected, counted and acknowledged.”[47] Presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders famously claimed that millennials are “the least prejudiced generation in the history of the United States.”[48] However, as Sanders would be first to acknowledge, they also have the bleakest job prospects of any generation in living memory. The youth unemployment rate in the United States reached a record 19 percent in 2010, the highest it had been since the government started gathering such statistics in 1948.[49] Employment levels for young people have improved since that time, but job prospects for people born after the mid-1980s remain dismal. People who came of age in the twenty-first century work in more part-time, precarious, and low-wage service jobs than their parents and grandparents did, despite the millennials’ higher levels of education.[50] American Honey gives audio-visual form to both sides of this equation: both to the progressive cultural attitudes of many young people today and to the bleak socio-economic prospects of the millennial generation.\n\nThe split between an optimistic view of a generation’s cultural attitudes and a pessimistic view of that same generation as a social class, emblematized in the film by an open and inclusive group of young people working in an unregulated subsector of the economy, represents the culmination of half a century of social change. Thomas Frank attributes this change to a conscious decision on the part of the Democratic Party’s leadership following the defeat of Democratic presidential nominee Hubert Humphrey in 1968. It is at that time, Frank recounts, that the party started moving as close as it could to the Republican position on economic issues while differentiating itself from its rival party by championing the causes of civil rights, feminism, and the like.[51] The wager was that traditionally Democratic working-class voters would have nowhere else to go. Liberals could undercut the labor movement, bust unions, negotiate trade deals that benefit the multinationals and decimate the local workforce, and still be able to rely on their working-class base for votes. The wager paid off in 1992 and 1996, with the elections of Bill Clinton, and again in 2008 and 2012, with Barack Obama. It was spectacularly lost in 2016, when a buffoonish demagogue doubling as a self-styled billionaire was able to convince a critical mass of the disenchanted electorate that he represented their interests better than the liberal establishment. As the country prepares for a new election pitting the billionaire buffoon against an as-yet undecided Democratic opponent (at the time of writing), we can only hope that the former Party of the People learned a lesson from the debacle of 2016.If Democrats do not commit to addressing the ever-widening gap between the Mission Hills magnates and the rest of the population while continuing to promote a culture of inclusion, the society depicted in American Honey might start to look downright utopian compared to the heartland of the future."
