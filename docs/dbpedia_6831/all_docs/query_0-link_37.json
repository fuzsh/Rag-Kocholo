(78 mins)\n\nANDREW LEAVOLD\n\nAndrew Leavold owned and managed Trash Video, the largest cult video rental store in Australia, from 1995 to 2010. He is also a filmmaker, published author, researcher, film festival curator, musician, TV presenter, and above all, unrepentant and voracious fan of the pulpier aspects of genre cinema.\n\nRIBSPREADER (2022)\n\n“Smokin’, it’ll kill you in the end. One way or another…” Decades after his career as a tobacco advertising icon, Bryan Burns’ life is in ruins. After his mother dies of lung cancer, he is tormented by a talking cigarette from an anti-smoking billboard who blames him for his mother’s death. Bryan’s already fragile mental state can’t handle the abuse and he snaps, transforming himself into The Ribspreader – a killer stalking the city streets, extinguishing smokers one-by-one and cutting out their lungs to make his macabre smoking jacket. But in a city of murderers, freaks and perverts, The Ribspreader isn’t the only killer out there and it’s not long before a turf war for victims erupts into a horrific showdown of explosive violence and bloody carnage! (90 mins)\n\nDICK DALE\n\nSouth Australian’s Dick Dale has been creating short horror and bad taste comedies filthy films since 1993.

This work takes the standard detective and sci-fi genre and turns it on its head, with an almost Brechtian style of acting, counter-intuitive editing and sound and brilliant black and white cinemaphotography by Raoul Coutard, Godard’s famous cameraman. With nods to Metropolis (1927) and Dick Tracy (1937), and the beautiful Anna Karina (1940 – 2019) as the star.\n\nJEAN-LUC GODARD (3 December 1930 – 13 September 2022) was a Franco-Swiss filmmaker and a leading member of the “French New Wave”. Known for stylistic innovations that challenged the conventions of Hollywood cinema, he is universally recognized as the most audacious, radical, as well as the most influential of the Nouvelle Vague filmmakers. His work reflects a fervent knowledge of film history, a comprehensive understanding of existential and Marxist philosophy, and a profound insight into the fragility of human relationships.\n\nSAI LI ​​is a visual artist based in London. Her work ranges from photography, film to installation.Her research focuses on a binary of power confrontation, using the dynamic power in gender relations as a metaphor to further explore the fluid power relations between individuals and society. The reason for her to join the Thamesmead Travelling Cinema is that she enjoys the community atmosphere and the more human-focused group. Her favourite movie is American Beauty.\n\nMIKE DUNFORD went to Goldsmiths College and did sculpture in 1964, and towards the end started making films in Standard 8mm. That led to showing work at the Drury Lane Arts Lab in 1968, and to joining with other film-makers to set up the London Film-makers Coop where they were able to make, process and show their films in their own cinema. Mike liked the idea of joining the Thamesmead Travelling Cinema because of a romantic attachment to the idea of a Travelling Cinema and also because he enjoyed the gig he had in Oakland California as a projectionist showing political documentary once a week at a community arts centre. And he also like the idea of being able to talk with audience members about what we all just saw.\n\nSupported by Bow Arts Trust\n\nTHAMESMEAD TEXAS are proud to present two film screenings led by our 2022 VOLUNTEER COHORT.\n\nSATURDAY 12 NOVEMBER 2022: TWO FILMS OF PARIS BY AGNES VARDA\n\n6:00PM – OPEN for drinks and hot dogs\n\n7:30PM – INTRO BY FILM SCHOLAR, Neil Archer\n\n7:45PM – LES DITES CARIATIDES by Agnès Varda (12 minutes)\n\n8:00PM – CLÉO DE 5 À 7 by Agnès Varda (90 minutes)\n\n10:30PM – Film concludes/ chat at bar (30 mins)\n\n11:00PM – CLOSE\n\nOn Saturday 12th November Paris comes to Thamesmead as Thamesmead Texas presents two films by the iconic Agnès Varda, LES DITES CARIATIDES (1984, runtime: 12 mins) and CLÉO DE 5 À 7 (1962, runtime 90 mins). Preceded by a short video introduction by film scholar Neil Archer, through these films you’ll have a chance to see the city of Paris as documented by one of its most beloved filmmakers. Both films are wonderfully inventive, visually charming, and full to the brim with warmth, wit, and humanity. We’ll be serving hot spiced wine all night, and playing some Françoise Hardy, Serge Gainsbourg, and Charles Aznavour to top it all off!\n\nAGNES VARDA (French, b.1928) is a photographer and filmmaker. The only female director to emerge out of French New Wave cinema, Varda is considered a founder of the movement and was an early pioneer of using non-actors and location shooting. She is known for her political and feminist films such as Cléo from 5 to 7, Le Bonheur, Vagabond, and La Pointe Courte, which was her self-funded debut in 1954 at the age of 26.\n\nNEIL ARCHER has an MA in World Cinemas at the University of Leeds, and a PhD in French cinema at the University of Cambridge. He is Senior Lecturer within the School of Humanities at Keele University, Staffordshire. “I have published widely on late twentieth- and twenty-first-century film aesthetics and the history of film industries, with a particular focus on popular British and other European cinemas, Hollywood cinema, mobility in cinema, and the relationship between globalization and film. My work has appeared in journals such as JCMS: Journal for Cinema and Media Studies, Studies in European Cinema, Journal of British Cinema and Television and Mobilities”.\n\nLydia de Matos is a 21-year-old student of language and cultural theory at University College London. Her research and artistic practice is interested in cinema’s relationship to time, memory, and constructed space, and expressions of stillness in the moving image. She believes in community-led, thoughtfully programmed cinema, and her favourite film is Miguel Gomes’ Tabu.\n\nAndre O’Garro is an aspiring documentary filmmaker/producer who recently finished studying Film and Media at Keele University. His interest in the medium blossomed at age 20 when he made ‘Out of The Cage’ a documentary about Lynne Bailey and her creative life post-retirement.

Hard to pin down but often centred on female, working-class characters and marked by simple, unsettling images and intricate editing, their surface harshness is shot through with complexity and compassion. The eldest of four children, she was born on 5 April 1961 in Dartford, Kent, where she grew up on a council estate of the sort that would form the setting for her own work; her parents, in their teens when she was born, separated while she was still a child.\n\nLUCIA TAMBINI was a respected film editor and camerawoman for ITV and Channel 4 news for over ten years before moving into documentary directing. After completing her MA in Documentary at the National Film School she’s gone on to work on many high-profile series, often with vulnerable contributors. She played a key role on the Bafta-award-winning Bedlam (about the Maudsley hospital) and on ‘Kids with Tourette’s’ which gained a Grierson award nomination. Her own films have also received several awards. She won the ‘Early bird award at the East End film festival for ‘Pipe Dreams’ and the Palme Do’r at the Southwest London Film festival for ‘A Place for us’ High-profile charity work includes films for Shelter, Oxfam, See Ability and other leading organisations. ‘We were Thamesmead’ has won the Audience Award and Best Documentary at the WOF film festival and other film awards.\n\nGEORGE PLEMPER: Photography came into my life at a time when my sense of self and my place in the world was fast disappearing. Fortunately, when I picked up the camera, I felt better, people looked and responded to me differently. I thought, here at last, this is something I can do that is worthwhile and good.” The time was the 1970s and George Plemper was confronting himself for the first time with the unforgiving reality of teaching.\n\nSupported by Bow Arts Trust\n\nSATURDAY 11 DECEMBER, 2021, FROM 7:30PM, WITH INTRO BY KALEB D’AGULAR\n\n25 MINUTE SHORTS PROGRAMME\n\n95 MINUTE FEATURE FILM\n\nFOLLOWED BY DRINKS AT THE BAR\n\nCLOSE 11:30PM\n\nSHORT FILMS:\n\nNO ENTRY (2020), BY KALEB D’AGULAR\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the Windrush scandal, a Jamaican mother struggles to keep her relationship with her son intact. Despite the government’s aggressive anti-immigration tactics, she keeps the threat of deportation a secret. As her psychological state begins to deteriorate, she grapples with the fear of losing her son and the country she calls home. 12:00 mins.\n\nMOTHERLAND (2020), BY ELLEN EVANS\n\nMOTHERLAND traces the experiences of two young men forcibly returned to Jamaica after a lifetime in Britain, alongside the story of a Windrush-generation man denied re-entry to the UK.

Soul boys Chris (Valentine Nonyela) and Caz (Mo Sesay), a pair of pirate radio DJs, broadcast their show from a friend’s garage, tussling with the local skinheads, and clubbing with Chris’s sassy music-industry girlfriend Tracy (Sophie Okonedo). But social and sexual tensions in the community reach boiling point following the murder of a local black gay man. With its soulful soundtrack – with Funkadelic, X-Ray Spex, Parliament, Sylvester and more – and enthusiastic young cast, this Cannes Critics’ Week prize-winner is an engaging and sensitive drama from acclaimed artist and filmmaker Isaac Julien. Text taken from Close Up. 95 mins.\n\nKALEB D’AGULAR is a Jamaican writer and filmmaker currently based in London. His background is in theatre and performance, but after completing his BSc in Anthropology, Kaleb transitioned to writing and directing for film. His curiosity in culture and the tensions between the individual and society drives his storytelling, which he hopes will help embolden the voices of the underclass and marginalised communities.\n\nELLEN EVANS is a documentary filmmaker living and working in London. Before she began making documentaries, she was an Immigration and Asylum caseworker for a Labour MP.\n\nFilmmaker and installation artist, ISSAC JULIEN CBE RA, was born in 1960 in London, where he currently lives and works.

As the neighbourhood disappeared, Costa retreated into the memories of his protagonists, increasingly focusing on immigrants from the Cape Verde islands. In telling their stories, Costa blends fact and fiction in a complex interplay of imagination, history, politics and cinema. Though intensely visual, Costa’s films draw on oral storytelling, presenting wordy narratives which at once celebrate and problematise language, examining the (im)possibility of adequately describing the lived experience.
