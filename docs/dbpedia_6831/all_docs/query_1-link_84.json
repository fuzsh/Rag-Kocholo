        "text": "Yesterday was my 31st birthday, and that was a weird day. We’re in quarantine, and I can’t really see anyone or do anything-it ended up being okay, and one huge reason is because my ex-boyfriend (the good one) recommended this movie to me. I had just told him how much I loved American Honey (we communicate in movies) and he said this was by the same director, Andrea Arnold, and good. I looked it up and found it on YouTube?? A situation that is unprecedented in the history of this blog! I also discovered it stars Michael Fassbender, someone I was not prepared to be sexually attracted to because he looks so…German? But who is sexually undeniable nonetheless.\n\nThis movie is about a fifteen year old girl (Mia EXPERTLY played by Katie Jarvis) growing up in England. The movie opens with her head-butting a former friend (well, friend of a former friend) and then just kind of roaming around. She finds an emaciated white horse that she tries to liberate and in the process almost gets trapped herself. Once home, most of the familial exchanges with her mom (Joanne played by Kierston Wareing) and sister (Tyler played by Rebecca Griffiths) are screaming the word cunt back and forth. Most of her time is spent wandering around alone OR practicing breakdance routines in a barren room in their flat. THEN her mom gets a new boyfriend who is VERY hot (Conor played by Michael Fassbender) and sort of hits on her after he walks in on Mia dancing to a Ja Rule and Ashanti music video. The actual quote is, “You dance like a black” which…didn’t feel great!\n\nThere’s absolutely a sexual tension between them which, as a viewer personally I feel great about, and as someone who is aware of how culturally sanctioned pedophilia is I hated, but it was directed by a woman so I felt safe! Does this need to be explained more? Let me know! Basically, putting girls under the male gaze and sexualizing them when they are barely pubescent feels disgusting, but women exploring their own sexuality feels fine?? Also art can be fantasy, but when reality is so fucked up it’s important to distinguish what you’re perpetuating and why. If you’re exploring this because you have something to say about it or it’s interesting to you, great, if you’re simply regurgitating this unexamined because you were conditioned to, not great!\n\nConor is a breath of fresh air for the girls, he includes them in stuff with their mom-something she has previously explicitly avoided. They all go on a drive to a lake in the country side and he shows them he can catch a fish with his bare hands. There seems to be some symbolism in this scene because Conor wades into the water and Mia follows him (even though she can’t swim) and after he catches the fish he gets out, leaving her to figure it out by herself and she gets a huge cut on her ankle. Symbolism *and* foreshadowing!\n\nSoon after this, Conor moves in with them because of some vague ‘problems at home,’ (which we are led to believe is his mother) and we get MORE moments of hidden inscrutable intimacy between them. Conor carries Mia to bed and takes her pants off and tucks her in, he encourages her to audition for a dance thing by lending her his camera, he gives her and her friend money to get drunk, you know, father stuff! This all comes to a head when Joanne has gone to bed and Mia and Conor are watching TV alone in the living room really late. He asks her to show him her dance routine for the audition. After a little persistence, she does. It’s to his favorite song thew Bobby Womack version of California Dreamin’, and as she’s dancing the sun comes up.\n\nThis proves to be too much and they have sex on the couch. Do we support it legally? No. Is it very hot in the movie, a controlled artistic endeavor?? It is. Then he does the usual, “We have to keep this a secret” spiel. Look, if you have sex with your girlfriend’s daughter, she knows it has to be a secret. She’s not dumb. She’s not a teenage boy!!!! (If you’re into this, there is a movie called A Teacher which is a slightly parallel dynamic, where a high school English teacher starts a physical relationship with one of her male students and he is, an idiot). Then the next morning Mia’s mom is SOBBING because Conor left!! Mia travels all the way to Tilbury, a place that sounds like biscuits but is actually a town, to find him. Once there, he seems really flustered and drives her to the station, kisses her, and says he’ll talk to her tomorrow which is what he said before evacuating their apartment. Mia is waiting but once the train comes she decides this isn’t enough closure and she goes back.\n\nNo one is home so she breaks in and discovers Conor is MARRIED and a DAD. His daughter Keira (Sydney Mary Nash) is twirling around on the video camera he lent her to film her audition! It’s, too much for Mia. But not enough to leave the house, she stays in there a really long time- I would be too nervous for breaking and entering- then manages to slip out the back once she hears a car pull into the driveway. But once outside, Keira keeps scooting by on a little razor scooter and Mia knows her name from the video so she does the next logical thing, KIDNAPS her. I had to pause the movie at this point because it was so stressful to me. Also, this movie is 2h3min. She gets kidnapped with like, TEN MINUTES LEFT. Do you know how stressful it is to be INTRODUCED to a kidnapping when you are aware there’s only 10 minutes to resolve it??? Whew.\n\nMia just seems to be marching her into nowhere and Keira eventually runs away and Mia chases her and this culminates in a horrifically stressful apex where Mia THROWS HER into the lake or ocean or whatever this body of water is and we KNOW Mia can’t swim and Keira is drowning, but then she pulls her out with a branch and they hug. This seems to be enough adrenaline and Mia takes her home and starts to head back. But Conor is driving around in the darkness looking for her and chases her and hits her? This scene wasn’t very well lit so I couldn’t really see but he definitely hits or pushes her then leaves her there and goes back to his car, to go back to his family.\n\nThe next day Mia has her big audition and she goes and everyone else there is in high heels and bikinis, slowly gyrating and she walks out. Also the horse died. One of the strongest scenes was this moment, Mia learning about the horse directly following the audition. After realizing things aren’t going to happen with Conor, AND the dance opportunity being dashed, AND the horse, it’s too much. She just hangs her head and cries and you feel so acutely how everything she had to look forward to is gone.\n\nThe last scene of the movie is Mia packing and leaving to go with the brother of the mean horse people (they have been having little mini adventures together throughout the movie, including breaking into a car lot and stealing parts from cars that still have blood and hair on them from the accidents they were in). Mia says bye to her sister in their way- they both say I hate you, her sister calls her a bitch and they hug cry. In an emotionally perfect moment, Mia dances with/across from her mom as a goodbye. I can’t explain it you need to watch it. But for their characters, it is the deepest expression of love they could allow and you felt that and it was beautiful.\n\nI loved this movie. Not JUST because fucking your mom’s boyfriend is an artistic choice I worship (I have loved it since I read Diary of a Teenage Girl when I was 13) but because Andrea Arnold (the director, a genius) knows how to show who people are with little to no dialogue, a beautifully rare and valuable movie skill. This movie and her other I’ve seen (American Honey) deal with GIRLS and their internal richness, a subject we could never get enough of. There are also almost absurdist elements, the white horse chained in the parking lot could be mundane depending how near to a countryside this took place but it certainly lended an air of mysticism and weird grandeur to the story.\n\nI like that we have sympathy & empathy for every single character, I like that there are total maybe 10 people who speak in this movie. I like that Mia has that over-straightened hair of teenage girls and when she takes it out there are bumps from where it was up. Through googling, I just found out that Katie had no prior acting experience and was cast after an assistant saw her arguing with her boyfriend at a train station. Huge fan of that.\n\nOverall it was such a complete world. I knew it inside and out and was still totally unsure of how everything was going to pan out. It’s hard to write about something that’s so singular, I felt this about American Honey too, it’s just it’s own thing and it evokes a feeling! I’m sure some might argue that trying to put that feeling into words is what makes some people good writers, but if I don’t have to I don’t want to!! Sometimes when you try to describe something the magic gets lost a little bit and I don’t want that to happen here.\n\nA technical note-something that was weird was that in the fishing scene, it felt like some part was edited out, there was a rough cut in the middle. And IMDB says the movie is 2h3min but the runtime of the video is a little shorter than that. Anyway. It’s on Youtube here’s the link if you want to watch it.\n\n5 out of 5 hard ciders!!!! Would (will) masturbate again."
