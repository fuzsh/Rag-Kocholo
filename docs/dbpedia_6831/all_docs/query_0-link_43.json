        "text": "The French Directors’ Guild (SRF) will fete UK director Andrea Arnold with its honorary Carrosse d’Or (Golden Carriage) award at the upcoming edition of its Cannes Directors’ Fortnight.\n\nArnold will receive the prize at the opening ceremony of the parallel section, running alongside the main Cannes Film Festival from May 15 to 25.\n\nMore from Deadline\n\nGeorge Miller Talks 'Furiosa' & Why He's Still Making 'Mad Max' Movies: \"They're Very Addictive\" - CinemaCon\n\nKevin Costner To Debut 'Horizon: An American Saga' At Cannes Film Festival\n\nInternational Insider: Drama In UK Drama; Cannes Plan Underway; Studiocanal Charts TV Path\n\nShe is the first UK director to be honored with the award and follows in the wake of the likes of Kelly Reichardt, John Carpenter, Martin Scorsese, Jia Zhangke, Jane Campion, Agnès Varda, Naomi Kawase and Jim Jarmusch.\n\nArnold has been a regular in the Cannes Film Festival’s Official Selection since her debut feature Red Road, which won the Jury Prize in 2006.\n\nShe went on to win the Jury Prize again for Fish Tank in 2009 and American Honey in 2016. Her last film Cow played in the Cannes Premiere section in 2021.\n\nThe announcement of the Directors’ Fortnight honor will fuel speculation that Arnold could be back in Cannes for a fifth time this year with upcoming film Bird.\n\n“From Milk to Red Road, from Wuthering Heights to American Honey, you scrutinize society from every angle, travelling through times and environments, and you embark us with powerful female characters,” the SRF board wrote in a letter to Arnold.\n\n“Faced with hindered desires and fallen ambitions, your heroines fight, grow, often in violence, and come into their own. Your sensitive and sharp eye on Mia, Sacha, Cathy, Jacky, Star and so many more strikes and delights us. Your singular take on mise-en-scene, your will to explore reality and give it a new shape in fiction as well as in documentary are a testament to your exacting gaze, both aesthetically and politically. We love the bravery and freedom of your work, your subtle art of contrast in the feld of desire and revolt. We are amazed by your constant ability to reinvent yourself, as if to question your filmmaking every time.”\n\nBest of Deadline\n\nBerlin Film Festival 2024: Award Ceremony, Film Premieres & Red Carpet Gallery\n\nSundance Film Festival 2024 Photos: Award Ceremony, Film Premieres & Parties Gallery\n\nSundance Film Festival U.S. Dramatic Grand Jury Prize Winners Through The Years - Photo Gallery"
