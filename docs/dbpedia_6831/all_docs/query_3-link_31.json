        "text": "October 30, 2012\n\nThe social realist tradition was first made popular in British cinema in the 1960’s with films such as Saturday Night, Sunday Morning, and has remained a dominant part of the British cinema industry right up until the present day, ‘While our cinema has experienced all the fluctuations in fortune of Hollywood’s first export territory, realism has been Britain’s richest gift to world cinema.’ (Armstrong: www.screenonline.org.uk). There are many cinematic conventions that can be deeply associated with social realism cinema, many of which can be first seen in the 1960’s films but are also relevant today as British films are still adopting these social realist conventions. This essay will be a close examination of the 2009 film Fish Tank and how it uses these social realist traditions.\n\nThink British realism, and you think inevitably of kitchen sinks, tall chimneys, cobblestones, railway arches, bleak stretches of moor or beach, graffiti lined council estates, people and landscapes placed in spare and striking juxtaposition. (Brown, 2009:29)\n\nSocial realism films stemmed from the documentary movement that came about in the 1920’s in Britain. Documentary is concerned with recording the real, it had a sense of social purpose as it was used to inform the public of social problems as well as being an entertaining form of public observation and in a way this was Britain’s response to the big films coming out of Hollywood. Even though documentary is primarily concerned with documenting real life, it could never be completely true to real life because using filmic conventions such as interesting camera shots, editing certain shots in sequence and the use of voice over’s it really became an interpretation of real life. From this ‘interpretation of real life’ came social realism, as it was a merging of documentary and fictional narrative. Social realist films do not document and record real life in the same way as documentary films do, they set out to reproduce reality in a certain way, even though the story could be completely fictional there would be a dominant sense of reality within it. This is achieved by the conventions it uses such as location shooting, hand held cameras, local regional actors and working class subjects, which are all conventions that will be looked at in relation to Fish Tank in the remainder of the essay.\n\nFish Tank, released in 2009, adheres to most of the social realist traditions set down by the social realist films of the 1960’s. Fish Tank is set on a rundown estate in Essex and is filmed on location; most of the narrative is set in and around the block of flats that fifteen-year-old Mia lives with her very dysfunctional family. This very contained location not only allows a very realistic depiction of what life is like for the people living in this particular area it also sets the premise that this is going to be a film about longing for escape. This is even presented clearly in the film’s opening sequence as we see Mia in an abandoned flat, dancing in front of the window where we can see out into the horizon ‘Every day she skips school to creep into an empty flat and plug into an alternative reality through headphones and fierce, intricately demanding hip hop moves’ (Mullen, 2009:17). A hand held camera is used throughout the film giving us Mia’s point of view at all times. This is a very interesting characteristic of Fish Tank, we never see any of the other characters on their own, everything is seen from Mia’s perspective, this in itself gives this idea of reality, in a way the viewer is placed as the character of Mia, we can only see the emotions and reactions of the other characters if she does and this also gives the film an ambiguous quality as we never really know the full story, only Mia’s side of it. This affect is achieved mainly by the use of the hand held camera that follows Mia’s every step in the narrative, it also gives the film its pace there are no slow lingering, complicated camera shots everything is shot in this ‘documentary’ style. Fish Tank also adheres to the social realist tradition of using unknown actors to make up its cast, especially in the case of Katie Jarvis who plays Mia who was discovered by the director Andrea Arnold in a railway station after overhearing Jarvis having an argument with her boyfriend. Arnold wanted real people in her cast to give the film a very gritty real representation of life on an Essex estate Arnold points out in Mullen’s article ‘Professional actors have learned professional attributes to their work’ (Mullen, 2009:18), which can make characters less real and that was not the aim of this film, the characters are not meant to be larger than life.\n\nThe idea that was first brought about in the 1960’s British social realist films of the ‘angry young men’, demonstrated by characters such as Arthur Seaton in Saturday Night Sunday Morning, is also something that has been touched on in Fish Tank. However, in Fish Tank it could be looking at the ‘angry young women’, young women who seem to be rebelling against the norms of society. Mia is an independent young girl who seems to find herself in trouble a lot of the time, she cannot seem to stay in school. The first impression we get of Mia is this mouthy, obnoxious teen that goes looking for trouble, for example when she causes confrontation with the other girls on the estate one of the very first scene, however throughout the film we see Mia’s character go on a journey ‘We’re repeatedly asked to reassess our reactions to Mia and our assumptions about her’ (Mullen, 2009:18). Like many girls today Mia is looking for escape through show business and through her dancing as Mullen points out in her article ‘In a culture increasingly sedated by and addicted to the myth of salvation through show business, celebrity is often presented as an easy solution for the disenfranchised dreamer’ (Mullen, 2009:17), making Fish Tank a very socially relevant film as there are many girls just like Mia in Britain striving to achieve this dream encouraged by television shows such as The X Factor. It would have been very easy for the director Andrea Arnold to have given us a happy ending for Mia, for her to achieve her dream of being a dancer, however reality hits home when we discover that the audition that Mia has been working so hard towards is for a sleazy strip club, Arnold ‘Viciously undercuts all our expectations in Fish Tank’ (Mullen, 2009:17).\n\n‘Film history also demonstrates that realism in British cinema has marked class boundaries. The notion that realist films could embrace characters of the upper middle class and beyond has rarely been considered’ (Brown, 2009:30), and this is another tradition that is adopted by Fish Tank. The film is a clear representation of a contemporary working class family, much like the way the family is represented in films such as Saturday Night Sunday Morning, even though the dynamics of the family have changed in the 2009 film, there is still this distinct view of the rejection of the parent culture just like the social realist films of the 1960’s. Mia and her younger sister Tyler are clear examples of the rebellious children often shown in the film to be drinking, smoking and swearing or in some way getting into trouble. However it is not just the children in Fish Tank who seem to have rejected this parent culture but the mother has also seemed to abandoned her parental responsibilities, by drinking and partying and bringing new men into the family home, she is not a positive role model for her children, therefore it is expected that Mia and Tyler are the way they are when looking at their mother. This notion of a breakdown in family relations also links to the idea of a ‘Broken Britain’ that was circulating in the media at the time the film was released. This ‘Broken Britain’ was a notion that had become prominent around election time with David Cameron pledging to ‘fix Britain’ , ‘This notion of broken Britain has become a dominant theme of the pre-election campaigning. It is an accordion-like concept, stretching and squeezing to fit different definitions depending on what the major worry of the hour is – youth crime, teenage pregnancy or anti-social behavior’ (Gentleman, 2010: www.guardian.co.uk), this campaign was also very focused on the breakdown of the traditional family. The ideas presented in the Broken Britain campaign are very similar to those presented by Arnold in Fish Tank again increasing its social relevance.\n\nHowever Roddick argues in his article that Fish Tank is not a social realist film, ‘Just because they are set in a tower block does not make them socially realistic. There is in both films a sense of an individual floating free’ (Roddick, 2009:20), an element of fantasy is injected into Fish Tank in the form of Mia’s desire to escape and also through the relationship she has with Connor, even though it is in reality a very wrong and disturbing relationship it is romanticized in the film because the audience sees it from the perspective of Mia, the fantasies of a fifteen year old girl giving their relationship a very ambiguous quality. However Roddick’s argument is not a critique of Fish Tank specifically but more of a comment of contemporary British cinema in general, ‘The more one tries to pin down social realism in contemporary British cinema, the more films one comes across that are anything but realistic.’(Roddick, 2009:20). With so many new advance in the film industry it is hard to find anything that can be viewed as solely realist, therefore Roddick argues that the realist features in Fish Tank only seem more prominent because ‘the notion of represented reality is itself under threat in today’s audiovisual culture’ (Roddick, 2009:20), this is the closest we can come to social realism in contemporary cinema."
