        "text": "Harsh, gritty and uncompromising, the British slum drama \"Fish Tank\" was one of the finest theatrical films I saw in 2009. Seeing it again, on cable, has not changed that opinion. It's a brilliant slice of life, directed with unassuming simplicity by Andrea Arnold.\n\nMia (the superlative Katie Jarvis) is a 15-year-old literally imprisoned in a shoddy housing project, wrecked by vandalism, scarred by graffiti. In order to survive such an environment, Mia is both profane and surly.\n\nREEL FILM: 'Deep Water' a gripping documentary of failed attempt at fame\n\nMYSTERIES: When it comes to sleuthing, Margaret Rutherford is the gold standard\n\nMOVIES: 'A Quiet Place': Film says 'thank you' to Dutchess, Ulster\n\nMother is a blonde drunk who gets by on the \"random kindness\" of whatever man happens to be around. She kicks her daughters out while having a drinking party, and later informs Mia, \"I wanted to abort ya! Had the doctor's appointment and everything!\" Clearly, the nurturing Mia and her younger sister's needs are not forthcoming from mama.\n\nCurrently living with Mia is a new \"uncle,\" well-played by Michael Fassbender (the wicked owner in \"12 Years a Slave.\") Named Conor, he's relatively clean-cut, educated, even has a decent job. He also rocks Mia's musical world by introducing her to R&B legend Bobby Womack. Sadly, Conor harbors a shattering secret.\n\nMia's major survival skill is hip-hop dancing, which she practices with relentless rage, in empty flats, to headphones. Without this release, Mia's only life choices would be drugs, girl gangs and becoming a clone of her mother.\n\nAnother major connection Mia makes is with a bony white horse she inexplicably finds tethered in a trashy parking lot. He is owned by a boy as rootless and lost as Mia. Here is where Hollywood would turn \"Fish Tank\" into treacle. Instead, director Arnold holds fast to her hard-boiled vision.\n\nMia learns of a club holding \"dance auditions\" and she works herself even harder and longer. This is a girl who doesn't want to leave her broken world, she wants to escape it, however it can be done.\n\nThe role of Mia is quite demanding, as she's in every single frame of \"Fish Tank,\" from start to finish. Jarvis is more than equipped to carry the movie on her young shoulders. Given the filth which so casually spews from Mia's mouth, Jarvis knows how to make such a thorny character honestly sympathetic.\n\nAt one point, Conor proposes to take the family \"for a ride to the country,\" that alleged country being a weedy patch of grass and two scuzzy ponds. Along the way Mia sees the landscape of what she doesn't want for a future: shuttered factories, abandoned malls, burned-out houses. On their drive the family even goes through a small town in which the entire main street is boarded up and covered in \"For sale\" placards.\n\nLike Mia, director Arnold's probing camera never flinches!\n\nWappingers Falls resident Larry Robinson has written film reviews and features for Westchester newspapers.
