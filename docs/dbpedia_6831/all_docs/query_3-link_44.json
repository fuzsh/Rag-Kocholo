        "text": "The Criterion Collection\n\nFish Tank\n\nEdition no. 553\n\nBuy Physical Copy At:\n\nStreaming Options\n\nLicensor\n\nIFC Films\n\nDirected by: Andrea Arnold\n\nBritish director Andrea Arnold won the Cannes Jury Prize for the intense and invigorating Fish Tank, about a fifteen-year-old girl, Mia (electrifying newcomer Katie Jarvis), who lives with her mother and sister in the housing projects of Essex. Mia’s adolescent conflicts and emerging sexuality reach a boiling point when her mother’s new boyfriend (a lethally attractive Michael Fassbender) enters the picture. In her young career, Arnold has already proven herself to be a master of social realism, evoking the work of Mike Leigh and Ken Loach; and she invests her sympathetic portraits of dead-end lives with a poetic, earthy sensibility all her own. Fish Tank heralds the official arrival of a major new filmmaker.\n\nTechnical Specifications\n\nFormat: Blu-ray\n\nAspect Ratio: 1.33:1\n\nAudio: English 5.1 DTS-HD MA Surround\n\nResolution:\n\nSubtitles: English\n\nRegion: A\n\nDiscs: 1 Disc | BD-50\n\n* some specifications may reference a film that is included as a special feature\n\nSupplements\n\nThree short films by director Andrea Arnold: Milk (1998), Dog (2001), and the Oscar-winning Wasp (2003)\n\nNew video interview with actor Kierston Wareing\n\nAudio conversation with actor Michael Fassbender from 2009\n\nAudition footage\n\nStills gallery by set photographer Holly Horner\n\nOriginal theatrical trailer\n\nAn essay by film scholar Ian Christie\n\nForum Member Statistics\n\nRelease Credits\n\nProducer: Kim Hendrickson\n\nArtwork: Jason Hardy"
