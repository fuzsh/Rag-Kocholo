        "text": "[ad]\n\nCharlie Rose recently had a discussion about the Apple iPad on his show recently with Walt Mossberg of the WSJ, David Carr of the NYT and Michael Arrington of TechCrunch.\n\nSeveral good points are made, which makes a change from the complaints about it being a big iPhone and having no Flash (the latter hasn’t affected sales of the iPhone and iPod touch has it?).\n\nWhilst I don’t think it will change how people watch long form films or TV (there’s still cinemas and large TVs for that) my gut feeling is that that it will revolutionise how we casually browse and experience the web.\n\nWhen it comes to newspapers, magazines and regular content that we read, like RSS feeds, blogs and shorter form media, I think advanced touch tablets are the future.\n\nIt could be the iPad, the Google’s upcoming device (which apparently launches this autumn), or succeeding versions, but after years of desktops and laptops sticking to the same keyboard and operating systems, this feels like a new era.\n\n[ad]\n\n[ad]\n\nNATIONAL RELEASES\n\nInvictus (Warner Bros.): Clint Eastwood’s latest film is based on the true story of how Nelson Mandela (Morgan Freeman) used the 1995 Rugby World Cup to unite South Africa in a moment of sporting solidarity with the help of national team captain Francois Pienaar (Matt Damon).\n\nAlthough this was touted as a likely awards season contender, the expected nominations (apart from two acting nods for Freeman and Damon) have failed to materialise, mainly because it isn’t quite up to the high standards of Eastwood’s best work behind the camera.\n\nThat said, the two leads are convincing and there is a pleasing directness to the material which gives it an undeniable punch. Although it can’t resist obligatory sporting clichés (slow motion being a major culprit), the central drama is well handled and the technical work behind the camera is what we’ve come to expect from latter day Eastwood films. [Nationwide / 12A]\n\nAstro Boy (E1 Entertainment): A CGI animated film about a young robot (voiced by Freddie Highmore) with incredible powers created by a brilliant scientist in the image of the son he has lost.\n\nBased on the long running Japanese series, it features a decent voice cast including Kristen Bell, Nathan Lane, Eugene Levy, Bill Nighy, Donald Sutherland and Nicolas Cage. The middling reviews in the US and poor box office performance suggest that it won’t set UK cinemas alight. [Empire Leicester Square & Nationwide (Previews 30/31st Jan)\n\nYouth In Revolt (Paramount/Momentum): An adaptation of C.D. Payne’s epistolary novel starring Michael Cera as a teenager who sets his sights on a local girl (Portia Doubleday) and creates an alter ego to win her over.\n\nDirected by Miguel Arteta, it co-stars Jonathan B. Wright, Steve Buscemi, Zach Galifianakis and Ray Liotta. Positive reviews from the US would suggest that it’s weak box office performance has more to do with the woes of The Weinstein Company than the quality of the film. Fans of Michael Cera and hip teen audiences may be the target audience. [Vues Fulham Broadway, Islington, West End & Nationwide / 15]\n\n[ad]\n\nALSO OUT\n\nMalice In Wonderland (Kaleidoscope Entertainment): A modern take on the fairytale, set in the North East of England. [Key Cities / 15]\n\nTony (Revolver Entertainment): A low budget British film about a serial killer getting a limited theatrical release before being released on DVD this Monday. [London & Key Cities / 18]\n\nThe Island (Artificial Eye): A drama set in a small Russian Orthodox monastery about an unusual man who people believe has the power to heal, exorcise demons and foretell the future. [Curzon Renoir & Selected Key Cities from 19th Feb]\n\nHoly Water (Kaleidoscope/Centurion ): British comedy about a once a thriving spa town that is livened up after a stash of Viagra is hidden down its famous Holy Well.

(1982) and Titanic (1997) were openly sad at their core.\n\nOne of the ideas Ancient Greeks had about drama was for it to provide catharsis and purge us of our negative emotions within a social situation.\n\nTragedies and their modern movie antecedents are a form of art based on human suffering, that paradoxically offers the audience pleasure.\n\nDespite all the joking around in these videos, they actually hit upon this truth.\n\nWhat films should this guy show his wife next? I’d go for Up, Stand By Me or The Shawshank Redemption.\n\n[ad]\n\nThe Oscar nominations are announced tomorrow (Tuesday 5.30am PST and 1.30pm GMT) and here are some of the films and people to look out for in the major categories.\n\nBEST PICTURE\n\nThe is the most interesting category of all because this year the Academy expanded the number of nominees from 5 to 10 in order to let in films that were more commercially successful.\n\nIt was basically a move to pacify ABC executives tired of declining ratings for the telecast and low grossing winners.\n\nObviously it was a move that goes against everything the Oscars should stand for (like awarding excellence rather than box office) and as it turned out, Avatar would have made it in to the final five anyway.\n\nWith that in mind, these films are cast-iron certainties to get in to the final 10:\n\nThe Hurt Locker\n\nAvatar\n\nUp in the Air\n\nPrecious\n\nInglourious Basterds\n\nAfter that, it gets a little trickier but I reckon that Up, Star Trek, District 9, An Education and A Serious Man will fill out the remaining slots. However, Invictus and A Single Man are possibilities.\n\nBEST DIRECTOR\n\nThis is going to follow the Best Picture category with the following directors:\n\nJames Cameron, Avatar\n\nKathryn Bigelow, The Hurt Locker\n\nLee Daniels, Precious\n\nQuentin Tarantino, Inglourious Basterds\n\nJason Reitman, Up in the Air\n\nBEST ACTOR\n\nThis category is also relatively straightforward, with Jeff Bridges emerging as the frontrunner to win.\n\nJeff Bridges, Crazy Heart\n\nGeorge Clooney, Up in the Air\n\nJeremy Renner, The Hurt Locker,\n\nColin Firth, A Single Man\n\nMorgan Freeman, Invictus\n\nBEST ACTRESS\n\nAnother straightforward category with Sandra Bullock likely to win. Emily Blunt isn’t a dead cert for the fifth slot, which could go to Helen Mirren for The Last Station.\n\nSandra Bullock, The Blind Side\n\nMeryl Streep, Julie & Julia\n\nCarey Mulligan, An Education\n\nGabourey Sidibe, Precious\n\nEmily Blunt, The Young Victoria\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTOR\n\nFor this category Christophe Waltz is a dead cert to win after scooping virtually every guild and critics award. The fifth slot is a hard one to call but if there is any justice Anthony Mackie should get a nod.\n\nChristophe Waltz, Inglourious Basterds\n\nWoody Harrelson, The Messenger\n\nStanley Tucci, The Lovely Bones\n\nMatt Damon, Invictus\n\nAnthony Mackie, The Hurt Locker\n\nBEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS\n\nAnother category where the winner is almost certain before the nominations are announced. Mo’Mique is the actress equivalent of Waltz in that she has dominated the critic and guild awards and a dead cert to win. This is quite a hard one to call and other possibles could include Diane Kruger (Inglourious Basterds), Penelope Cruz (Nine) and Mariah Carey (Precious).\n\nMo’Nique, Precious\n\nAnna Kendrick, Up in the Air\n\nVera Farmiga, Up in the Air\n\nMaggie Gyllenhaal, Crazy Heart\n\nJulianne Moore, A Single Man\n\nOf course, I could have got a few of these wrong but we shall see when Anne Hathaway and Tom Sherak announce them at a news conference at the Academy’s Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills on Tuesday.\n\nThe Oscars themselves are on Sunday 7th March.\n\n> Official site\n\n> Get the latest awards season news at AwardsDaily and InContention\n\nBroken Embraces (Pathe) is the latest film from Spanish director Pedro Almodóvar and a ‘romantic noir’ spanning 16 years.\n\nSet in 2008, with flashbacks to 1992 and 1994, it focuses on a film director (Lluis Homar) who’s lost the love of his life (Penelope Cruz) as well as his eyesight to a jealous lover.\n\nThe tricky structure is a dramatic device used to comment on and explain the events of the present and although this seems to have put some viewers off – judging by the mixed reaction it got at Cannes – is still handled impressively.\n\nIt also explores guilt and how it can weigh heavily on human relationships, suggesting that the director was possibly drawing on his own life and art, and this is served by some convincing performances.\n\nHomar convey’s a director’s restless desire for his life and art, even when he can’t see, whilst Cruz is as emotionally convincing as she is physically striking.\n\nHer performance is almost a post-modern wink to the relationship between a director and a leading lady.\n\nAs you might expect, Almodóvar fills the frame with some captivating images, using primary colours (especially red) as a counterpoint to the heavy emotional situations and characters.\n\nIf there is a flaw with the film, it is that it exists almost too neatly within it’s cinema-drenched world: not only is the protagonist a director, but it even references numerous auteurs such as Powell, Hitchcock, Malle, Fellini and even his own 1988 film Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown.\n\nWhilst this makes it a treat for cinephiles and an undoubtedly personal work for Almodóvar, it lacks the heart and feeling of his more recent works like Talk to Her and Volver.\n\nThe extras on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc include:\n\nShort Film: The Anthropophagic Council Woman La Concejala Antropofaga (7 mins 32 secs)\n\n3 x Deleted Scenes (11 mins 50 secs)\n\nDirecting in Girls and Suitcases (5 mins 30 secs)\n\nOriginal UK Theatrical Trailer (2 mins)\n\nPhoto Gallery\n\nBroken Embraces is out now from Pathe\n\n> Buy the DVD or Blu-ray Disc from Amazon UK\n\n> IMDb entry\n\nSin Nombre (Revolver) is a highly impressive drama about immigrants trying to reach the US (the title is Spanish for “without name”) directed by Cary Fukunaga.\n\nSeeking the promise of America, a young Honduran woman, Sayra (Paulina Gaitan), joins her father and uncle on an odyssey to cross the gauntlet of the Latin American countryside en route to the United States.\n\nAlong the way she crosses paths with a teenaged Mexican gang member, El Casper (Edgar Flores), who is manoeuvring to outrun his violent past and elude his unforgiving former associates.\n\nA highly accomplished debut feature, it has some fine performances and has a compelling sense of realism which may have been a result of the director’s extensive research, which involved travelling with immigrants on trains in Central America.\n\nAlthough the story treads a well worn path, both literally and figuratively, it manages to steer well clear of cliché and tedium thanks to the skill and attention to detail behind the camera.\n\nCinematographer Adriano Goldman gives the film a remarkable look, blending the rugged landscapes and harsh urban environments with considerable grace and panache, fully deserving of its awards at Sundance last January.\n\nThe exras on the DVD and Blu-ray Disc include:\n\nAudio commentary\n\nDeleted scenes\n\nSin Nombre is out now on DVD and Blu-ray from Revolver\n\n> Buy it on DVD or Blu-ray at Amazon UK\n\n> IMDb entry\n\n[ad]\n\nDVD & BLU-RAY PICKS\n\nSin Nombre (Revolver): A deeply impressive drama about immigrants trying to reach the US (the title is Spanish for “without name”) directed by Cary Fukunaga.

touches (especially the mobile phone) but doesn’t this feel like it should have been made a few years ago before the collapse of Lehman Brothers?\n\nIt started filming in New York last September with Michael Douglas back as Gordon Gekko and Oliver Stone returning to direct.\n\nThe plot is the modern-day story of Gekko, who has recently been sprung from prison and re-emerges into the current chaos of the financial markets, whilst trying to rebuild a relationship with his estranged daughter (Carey Mulligan).\n\nMeanwhile Shia LaBeouf plays a young trader and Frank Langella stars as his mentor, whilst Josh Brolin has a key supporting role as a hedge fund manager.\n\nIt is released in the UK and US on Friday 23rd April.\n\nDisney effectively decided to shut down Miramax on Thursday as they announced that the New York and Los Angeles offices of the art house movie studio will close.\n\nAlthough Disney may decide to keep it as a distribution label within their major film division, effectively as a shell of its former self, 80 employees will lose their jobs and the company as we once knew it, is now essentially over.\n\nAt the moment there doesn’t appear to be an official line on what will happen but according the the New York Times, around 20 employees will be folded into their major studio operations and the six films awaiting release will come out under the Miramax banner.\n\nAlthough closure had been on the cards for some time, especially when former president Daniel Battsek left back in the Autumn, the move is still a powerful reminder of harsh times the film business faces with squeezed finances due to the recession.\n\nAs to who will be in charge of winding it up, selling it or keeping it as a production label nothing has officially been announced yet.\n\nIf Disney did sell the studio, the handful of films in currently in production, the Miramax name and the valuable library of around 500 films – including Pulp Fiction, The English Patient, Good Will Hunting, Shakespeare in Love, Chicago and Kill Bill – could fetch over $1.5 billion according to Variety.\n\nNikki Finke is reporting that Summit are interested in buying Miramax, the logic would appear to be that they have a lot of cash from the Twilight franchise and it would be a way for the young studio to acquire projects and a library in one go.\n\nBack in 2008, before the demise of Lehman Brothers and the near-collapse of the global financial system, New Line and Paramount Vantage were just two high profile casualties of studios reining back their specialty divisions.\n\nThe indie film boom of the 1990s and subsequent creation of dependent divisions such as Fox Searchlight, Vantage, Focus Features and Warner Independent, was in large part due to the success of Miramax who managed to make or acquire lower budget films and market them to awards and box office glory.\n\nFounded in 1979 by Bob and Harvey Weinstein, the company broke into movie distribution with The Secret Policeman’s Other Ball in 1982 and established a knack for acquiring films from international filmmakers and rebranding them for US audiences.\n\nIn 1989 they achieved a breakthrough successes with sex, lies, and videotape (1989), which established Steven Soderbergh as a director (he won the Palme D’Or at Cannes that year) and also set the template for the Sundance film festival as a mecca for filmmakers and buyers, where indie movies could be bought and then distributed at a decent profit.\n\nWhen Disney acquired Miramax in 1993, things went up to another level as the new injection of corporate cash gave the Weinsteins greater power to buy independent films, which they then marketed with an extraordinary focus and panache, controlling the post-production and campaigning them aggressively for Oscar voters.\n\nDespite controversies over their larger than life methods, they were hugely successful with a remarkable run of 13 Best Picture Oscar nominations in 11 years (from 1992 until 2002), with films as diverse as The Crying Game, Pulp Fiction, Il Postino, The English Patient, Good Will Hunting, Life Is Beautiful, Shakespeare in Love, Chicago, City of God, Kill Bill all hits at the box office and with the Academy.\n\nPulp Fiction was to the 90s indie scene what Star Wars had been to the Hollywood of the 70s – a film that rewrote the business and artistic rule book by grossing over $100 million at the US box office on a budget of just $8.5 million (and $10 million marketing costs) before going on to make over $200 million worldwide.\n\nThe fact that the film (effectively funded by Disney) could feature relentless profanity, male rape and several violent deaths and scoop several Oscar nominations (and win for Best Screenplay) shows how far Miramax had come.\n\nFor a decade from the mid-90s onwards their hold on the awards season was incredible. Films like The English Patient (1996) and Shakespeare in Love (1999) won Best Picture and in 2002 they had no less than 3 of the 5 Best Picture nominees: The Hours; Gangs of New York and the eventual winner Chicago.\n\nBut they weren’t all about winning awards. Their less glamorous sister division Dimension was very profitable with films like Scream (1996), Spy Kids (2001) and Scary Movie (2000) all launching franchises.\n\nWith success though, came behind-the-scenes rancour and conflict, not only with film-makers who felt burnt by their hands on business methods and ‘creative input’, but more significantly with Disney head Michael Eisner.\n\nHe famously turned down the Lord of the Rings trilogy when Miramax wanted to film the trilogy of books as a 2-film adaptation (apparently it was ‘too dark’ for the Mouse House) and was also increasingly alarmed at the growing budgets of films like Cold Mountain (2003) as well as the hot potato release of Michael Moore’s Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004).\n\nBy 2005 the Weinsteins left to form their own studio (The Weinstein Company), although they have struggled ever since to have the same level of success and many observers think that could struggle to survive in the current financial climate.\n\nIn the meantime the rebooted Miramax, under new British president Daniel Battsek, managed to achieve some notable critical and commercial successes with Tsotsi, The Queen, Gone Baby Gone, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly and two landmark co-productions with Paramount Vantage in 2007: No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood.\n\nHowever, the Oscars at which No Country For Old Men triumphed in March 2008 would mark the end of an era – budgets were down and the number of releases was way back from what was the norm in the company’s heyday.\n\nBy 2009 Disney was rethinking its approach to the specialty market to just three films a year and when Battsek, who had done a remarkable job in many ways, left in October, the writing was on the wall.\n\nWhen the long time chairman of Disney’s movie division Dick Cook was effectively ousted, a new corporate approach to movies was apparent under the leadership of Bob Iger and it was one in which Miramax didn’t appear to have a place.\n\nSpeaking to The Wrap, Harvey Weinstein said he felt nostalgic about the studio he founded:\n\n“I’m feeling very nostalgic right now. I know the movies made on my and my brother Bob’s watch will live on as well as the fantastic films made under the direction of Daniel Battsek. Miramax has some brilliant people working within the organization and I know they will go on to do great things in the industry.”\n\nAnother Miramax alumnus was director Kevin Smith, who got his break when his debut feature Clerks was acquired at Sundance in 1994. Writing for The Wrap he said he was crushed by the closure of the studio:\n\nWhat Harvey and Bob built from scratch resembled an old studio star-factory; but this time, the stars were the filmmakers.\n\nIt was a gang (of New York), and like any good gang, it was dripping with street cred. Just being a part of that gang sent a message: I run with rebels.\n\nBut Miramax wasn’t just a bad-boy clubhouse, it was a 20th century Olympus: throw a can of Diet Coke and you hit a modern-day deity. And for one brief, shining moment, it was an age of magic and wonders.\n\nI’m crushed to see it pass into history, because I owe everything I have to Miramax. Without them, I’d still be a New Jersey convenience store register jockey. In practice, not just in my head.\n\nThe most recent Miramax film was the Robert De Niro comedy-drama Everybody’s Fine (an ironic title given the company’s current woes) which grossed just $9 million following its December release.\n\nUpcoming releases include The Debt (a thriller directed by John Madden and starring Helen Mirren); The Tempest (by director Julie Taymor, also starring Helen Mirren and Russell Brand); Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark (written by director Guillermo del Toro); The Baster (a comedy starring Jennifer Aniston); Gnomeo and Juliet (starring James McAvoy and Emily Blunt) and Last Night (starring Sam Worthington, Eva Mendes and Keira Knightley).\n\nFor a deeper history of Miramax, you should read Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance and the Rise of Independent Film, the 2004 book by Peter Biskind which explored the rise of US independent cinema in the 1990s.\n\nYou can also listen to an interview I did with him back in the summer of 2008 where we discussed Miramax at length here.\n\nFish Tank (Artificial Eye) is writer-director Andrea Arnold’s second feature-length film, and another deeply impressive piece of work after her Oscar winning short Wasp (2005) and Red Road (2006).\n\nIt is the tale of a teenage girl named Mia (Katie Jarvis) who lives with her mother and younger sister on an poor Essex housing estate.\n\nFrustrated with her life and lack of options, things begin to change when she strikes up a friendship with her mother’s new boyfriend (Michael Fassbender).\n\nUnlike many British films which feature aristocrats in period costume or gangsters who swear a lot, this takes what seems like humdrum material and does something really special with it.\n\nCentral to the film is the debut performance of newcomer Katie Jarvis who is magnetic in the central role, conveying the emotions of a disaffected teenager with remarkable clarity and sensitivity.\n\nThe story picks up with Mia having been expelled from school and spending her time drinking and practising her dancing in a derelict flat near to her family’s council flat home.\n\nWith her life spiralling out of control, things don’t look like getting any better when her mother Joanne (Kierston Wareing) brings home a new boyfriend named Connor – but he seems like the kind of decent and encouraging person who can offer Mia hope and a way out of her life.\n\nPart of the strength of Fish Tank is the way in which it subverts expectations of this kind of material. There are no patronising clichés of working class life and the material rested firmly on the two central characters, both of who are played with perfect pitch by Jarvis and Fassbender.\n\nThe final third of the film uncoils with a slow burning sense of unease as it is very hard to tell what is going to happen and the depiction of poverty in modern day Britain is sobering without ever being heavy handed.\n\nInterestingly, Arnold and her cinematographer Robbie Ryan have opted to shoot the film in the 1.33:1 aspect ratio (so the frame is almost square) which is a rare sight in modern cinema.\n\nGus Van Sant’s Elephant (2003) is the only film in recent years that I can remember using it, but it gives this a distinctive visual feel and tone which takes it into another place.\n\nProof that Andrea Arnold is currently one of the most accomplished directors working in Britain today, the film could see her move on to a bigger canvas and even more acclaim sooner rather than later.\n\nFrustratingly, there isn’t a Blu-ray release at the moment (maybe Artifcial Eye’s budget’s are stretched?) but the DVD comes with the following extras:\n\nAndrea Arnold’s Oscar® winning short film ‘WASP’ starring Natalie Press & Danny Dyer\n\nGallery\n\nFish Tank is out now from Artificial Eye\n\n> Buy Fish Tank on DVD from Amazon UK\n\n> Fish Tank at the IMDb\n\nA classic 1999 ensemble drama written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, Magnolia (EIV) was a stunning mosaic of several interrelated characters in search of happiness, forgiveness, and meaning in the San Fernando Valley.\n\nStarring John C. Reilly, Tom Cruise, Julianne Moore, Philip Seymour Hoffman, William H. Macy, and Jeremy Blackman, it blends nine different stories that involve several people during one day in Los Angeles.\n\nEven more audacious than his stunning breakthrough film Boogie Nights (1997), it explores heavyweight themes such as love, death, chance and family with supreme confidence and style.\n\nA homage of sorts to Robert Altman‘s ensemble dramas of the 1970s, it examines the universal by focusing tightly on the personal and is notable for Anderson’s dazzling wide-screen compositions and camera movements.\n\nRegular collaborators such as cinematographer Robert Elswit and editor Dylan Tichenor add their usual impeccable contributions and the acting across the board was first rate, with an especially eye-opening turn from Tom Cruise as a loathsome sex guru.\n\nAt just over three hours long it is a sprawling epic, but one which engages fully with its sublime mix of technical virtuosity, wit, emotion and memorable soundtrack from Aimee Mann, whose songs inspired some of the script.\n\nIt is a film that can divide viewers (some always seem to have a problem with the climax) but it got mostly positive reviews and still stands as one of the best films of a particularly outstanding year. Also look out for the numbers 8 and 2 which are liberally scattered throughout the film as visual clues to a key sequence.\n\nDVD Beaver have posted some screen grabs compared to the DVD versions if you want to gauge the quality of the transfer.\n\nThe Blu-ray comes with roughly the same extras as the 2 disc DVD and includes a lengthy video diary detailing much of the production.\n\nExtras include:\n\nMagnolia video Diary\n\nFrank T.J.

Although 3D has become the norm at cinemas for animated films over the last 18 months, live action films such as The Final Destination were gimmicky and few and far between.\n\nBut Avatar was designed from the beginning as a spectacular and immersive 3D experience which would be shown on as many new digital screens as possible.\n\nIt was a calculated gamble for Fox and Cameron to push this technology on such a high profile film, which wasn’t an established property or sequel, but it has paid off handsomely.\n\nAnother aspect worth noting is how well it has done in markets such as China and Russia, which were harder to tap back in the late 1990s and this certainly helped its global box office numbers.\n\nWhy has it hit such a chord with audiences?\n\nThe combination of ground breaking visuals and a universal story line that fits neatly into many global cultures would appear to be the primary reasons but we should also bear in mind the Christmas box office, which features less competition than the summer.\n\nCan it break the $2 billion barrier? At this point few would bet against it.\n\n[ad]\n\nDVD & BLU-RAY PICKS\n\nMagnolia (EIV): The classic 1999 ensemble drama written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, which is a mosaic of several interrelated characters in search of happiness, forgiveness, and meaning in the San Fernando Valley.

Aliens – £21.37m [Source: Nielsen EDI, UK Film Council]\n\nTicket sales have varied in the past seven years, peaking in 2002 with a total of 175.9m admissions and dipping to 156.6m in 2006.\n\nThe World Cup was a factor for both of these years, as televised games in the summer always eat into the summer box office.\n\nBut the very early kick off times in the 2002 tournament (when the tournament was in Korea and Japan) didn’t have the same effect as in 2006 when a lot of games in Germany were in the same time zone.\n\nHowever, the big trend for last year was the surge in ticket sales which was helped in part by three films: Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Twilight: New Moon and Avatar.\n\nPotter is the most bankable film franchise in history, New Moon has brought younger female audiences out in droves and Avatar is essentially the new Titanic.\n\nIt is also worth looking at how successful family friendly animated films are: Up, Monsters vs Aliens and Ice Age III have all done major business. The international grosses of the latter are truly mind boggling given how relatively cheap it was to make.\n\nI don’t always subscribe to the notion that cinema does well in a recession but if the right mix of films hit the spot for mass audiences across the board then it is cheaper than other leisure activities and an escape from going down the pub and discussing how miserable life is.\n\nIt remains doubtful that 2010 will be as successful as 2009 and I imagine Avatar will cast a long shadow over fellow box office rivals.\n\nBut summer releases that look set to do serious business include Iron Man 2, Sex and the City 2 (God help us), Robin Hood, Toy Story 3, Twilight: Eclipse and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 in November.\n\nJulia Roberts and Tom Hanks were interviewed live by NBC on the Golden Globes red carpet and had some rather amusing things to say about the network’s recent problems.\n\nHere are the winners at the Golden Globes, which took place in Beverley Hills earlier today.\n\nFILM\n\nBest Picture (Drama): Avatar\n\nBest Picture (Comedy/Musical): The Hangover\n\nBest Director: James Cameron, Avatar\n\nBest Actress (Drama): Sandra Bullock, The Blind Side\n\nBest Actor (Drama): Jeff Bridges, Crazy Heart\n\nBest Actress (Comedy/Musical): Meryl Streep, Julie & Julia\n\nBest Actor (Comedy/Musical): Robert Downey Jr, Sherlock Holmes\n\nBest Supporting Actress: Mo’Nique, Precious\n\nBest Supporting Actor: Christoph Waltz, Inglourious Basterds\n\nBest Foreign Language Film: The White Ribbon\n\nBest Animated Feature: Up\n\nBest Screenplay: Jason Reitman & Sheldon Turner, Up in the Air\n\nBest Original Score: Michael Giacchino, Up\n\nBest Original Song: The Weary Kind, Crazy Heart\n\n[ad]\n\nTV\n\nBest TV Series (Drama): Mad Men\n\nBest TV Series (Comedy): Glee\n\nBest TV Miniseries: Grey Gardens\n\nBest Actress, TV Miniseries: Drew Barrymore, Grey Gardens\n\nBest Actor, TV Miniseries: Kevin Bacon, Taking Chance\n\nBest Actress, TV Drama: Julianna Margulies, The Good Wife\n\nBest Actor, TV Drama: Michael C.

Weber it became a something of a minor hit back in the summer and has earned plaudits for its unconventional approach to the genre.\n\nAlthough it occasionally suffers from a bit too much kooky quirkiness, the two lead performances are good value as is the sequence which makes creative use of Hall & Oates’ “You Make My Dreams”.\n\nThe DVD and Blu-ray Disc contains the following extras:\n\nDirector’s Commentary\n\nLost Days of Summer: 9 Deleted and Extended Scenes\n\nDigital Copy\n\nWhilst the Blu-ray has the following exclusives:\n\nBank Dance Directed by Marc Webb\n\nMean’s Cinemash: “Sid and Nancy/ (500) Days of Summer\n\nMusic Video: SWEET DISPOSITION by Temper Trap\n\nConversations with Zooey and Joseph\n\nActing Vs Reality\n\nCreative Process\n\nFavourite Parts of L.A\n\nKaraoke\n\nLos Angeles\n\nMusic\n\n(500) Days of Summer is out now from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment\n\n> Buy the DVD or Blu-ray from Amazon UK\n\n> IMDb Entry\n\nDr Strangelove (Sony): The Blu-ray release of Stanley Kubrick’s classic Cold War satire is one of this year’s major releases on the format.\n\nReleased in 1964, it stars Peter Sellers (in a remarkable performance encompassing three roles: US president, the scientist title character and a British RAF group captain), George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden.\n\nLoosely based on Peter George’s novel Red Alert it depicts the chaos that ensues when an unhinged US Air Force general launches a first strike nuclear attack on the Soviet Union.\n\nWith its splendid mix of intelligence, wit and technical brilliance it remains one of Kubrick’s finest works and also one of the truly great films of the 1960s.\n\nThis Blu-ray release came out last summer in the US and was based on a 4K restoration by Sony (although sadly no sign of the famously deleted cream pie fight).\n\nThere are a couple of visual issues surrounding this release worth noting as they apply to any classic work restored for Blu-ray.\n\nFirstly, the aspect ratio is done in 1:66. As The Digital Bits reported:\n\nThe original theatrical presentation varied between 1.33 and 1.66. In recent years however, we’re told that Kubrick’s associates (who manage his estate) have become more comfortable with the 16×9/1.78:1 aspect ratio of HD displays, and they believe that Kubrick himself – if he’d really had the chance to look into it – would have preferred his full frame films to be presented on home video (in HD) at a steady 1.66 to take better advantage of the 1.78:1 frame. So that’s the reasoning for the decision.\n\nThe other issue which caused some debate was that of grain. The basic argument here revolves around how much grain should be removed in the transfer process. Purists argue that grain should be preserved as it was part of the original negative, whilst others think that if directors would have removed grain if they had access to modern digital tools.\n\nTo complicate the issue, there are some who think that that the whole issue is a non-starter and that grain is an inherent part of the film image.\n\nThere isn’t really a definitive answer, as it depends on the film and your viewpoint, but given the heated arguments around such releases of The French Connection and The Third Man, it is likely to remain an issue that crops up in future.\n\nGary Tooze of DVD Beaver thinks grain was always an important part of the film:\n\nGrain has always been an important part of the visual texture to this film – it’s preserved here nicely without becoming a distraction. This is a great B&W, 1080p presentation. The new TrueHD 5.1 audio mix is also quite good, offering the expected improvements in clarity and resolution. For those who prefer it, however, the original mono audio is here too.\n\nJeffrey Wells of Hollywood Elsewhere felt badly let down by the grain in the image, describing it as:\n\n…more than a visual disappointment — it’s a flat-out burn. I paid $35 bills for it yesterday afternoon and I’m seething. It’s hands down the worst grainstorm experience since Criterion’s The Third Man because Sony’s preservation and restoration guy Grover Crisp went the monk-purist route in the remastering and retained every last shard of grain in the original film elements.\n\nGlenn Kenny of Some Came Running took a different position, arguing that Kubrick wanted grain in the film:\n\nOf course this brings up all the old arguments as to grain and its place in a motion picture’s image, the rather absurd supposition by some that if dead filmmakers could return from the grave they’d immediately avail themselves of digital technology and erase all the film grain from their oeuvres, etc., etc. I don’t think I’m going that far on a limb to say that Kubrick in particular liked a little grain in his images.\n\nWhatever the debate over the visual transfer it is still an essential film for any collection and the extras are plentiful, including:\n\nCoded for all regions (A, B and C), extras are in SD.

Free of human relationships, he has become attached to frequent flyer miles, a commitment-free relationship with a fellow air mile addict (Vera Farmiga) and the buzz of living out of a suitcase. But when his boss (Jason Bateman) partners him with a new recruit (Anna Kendrick) who advocates firing people via video-link, things begin to change.\n\nDirected by Jason Reitman, it is a smart, funny and thoughtful adaptation of Walter Kim’s 2001 novel that explores the current recession, relationships and travel. Intelligently written and slickly directed, it features a marvellous central performance from Clooney, who peppers his role with just the right amounts of charm, wit and emotion. Farmiga and Kendrick also provide excellent support and it will be a strong contender at this year’s Oscars. Paramount can expect solid business after positive word of mouth.

But when his boss (Jason Bateman) partners him with a new recruit (Anna Kendrick) who advocates firing people via video-link, things begin to change.\n\nDirected by Jason Reitman, it is a smart, funny and thoughtful adaptation of Walter Kim’s 2001 novel that explores the current recession, relationships and travel.\n\nI spoke with Anna Kendrick in London recently and we talked about her role and her experiences making it.\n\nYou can listen to the interview here:\n\n[audio:http://filmdetail.receptionmedia.com/Anna_Kendrick_on_Up_in_the_Air.mp3]\n\nYou can download this interview as a podcast via iTunes by clicking here\n\nUp in the Air is out at UK cinemas on Friday 15th January\n\n> Download the interview as an MP3 file\n\n> Official UK site\n\n> Anna Kendrick at the IMDb\n\n> Read my review of the film\n\n> Buy more about author Walter Kirn and director Jason Reitman at Wikipedia\n\nWhen Christopher Nolan makes a blockbuster like The Dark Knight, a big studio like Warner Bros will then allow him to make a trippy looking, enigmatic film like Inception, which is out this summer.\n\n> Official site\n\n> More on Inception at Wikipedia\n\nDVD & BLU-RAY PICK\n\nThe Taking of Pelham 123 (Sony): The remake of the much loved 1974 thriller sees Denzel Washington take on the role of a MTA dispatcher who has to deal with the head of a criminal gang (John Travolta) who have hijacked a train in New York.\n\nDirected by Tony Scott and scripted by Brian Helgeland, it largely came about because Sony had bought MGM and had the rights to remake certain titles in their library.\n\nAlthough the original film is so distinctive and of its time, this version manages to be something more than just a rehash, mainly due to the fact that Helgeland went back to the original novel and changed some key plot points.\n\nIt features solid work all round from the two leads down to a fine supporting cast, which includes John Tuturro, James Gandolfini and Luis Guzman.\n\nScott directs in his usual frenetic, multi-camera setup style but there is something pleasingly straightforward about the way in which it is all delivered.\n\nIt disappointed at the US box office and got a mixed critical response but deserved better as it is a highly efficient nuts and bolts thriller even if Scott directs and edits in his usual ADD manner.\n\nThe DVD comes with the following extras:\n\nEnglish and Italian DD5.1 Surround\n\nEnglish Audio Description Track\n\nSubtitles: English, English HOH, Danish, Finnish, Hindi, Italian, Norwegian, Swedish\n\nCommentary with Director Tony Scott\n\nCommentary with Writer Brian Helgeland and Producer Todd Black\n\nNo Time to Lose: The Making of Pelham 123\n\nThe Third Rail: New York Underground\n\nMarketing Pelham\n\nFrom the Top Down: Stylizing Character\n\nThe Blu-ray Disc is coded for all regions (A, B and C) and the extras are in a mix of SD and HD, including:\n\n1080P 2.40:1 Widescreen\n\nEnglish, German and Italian 5.1 DTS-HD MA\n\nEnglish Audio Description Track\n\nSubtitles: English, English HOH, Danish, Finnish, German, Hindi, Italian, Norwegian, Swedish, Turkish\n\nCommentary with Director Tony Scott\n\nCommentary with Writer Brian Helgeland and Producer Todd Black\n\nNo Time to Lose: The Making of Pelham 123\n\nThe Third Rail: New York Underground\n\nMarketing Pelham\n\nFrom the Top Down: Stylizing Character\n\nBD-Live: cinechat\n\nAlthough I wasn’t sent the Blu-ray for review purposes, I would imagine the transfer looks very good, given that it’s a Sony release.\n\nGary Tooze of DVD Beaver says it “looks very strong on Blu-ray” and that the transfer is “thick and heavy – balancing nicely between over-saturation and textured grain” and that overall it is a “marvellous presentation”. He has several screen shots here.\n\n* Buy the DVD or Blu-ray from Amazon UK *\n\n[ad]\n\nALSO OUT\n\nAnd Then There Were None (Optimum) [Buy on DVD]\n\nAntichrist (Artificial Eye) [Buy on DVD | Buy on Blu-ray]\n\nBlood Feast 2: All U Can Eat (Arrow Video) [Buy on DVD]\n\nDoctor Who Winter Specials 2009 (2 Entertain) [Buy on DVD]\n\nDoctor Who: The Complete Specials (2 Entertain) [Buy on DVD | Buy on Blu-ray]\n\nFeast II: Sloppy Seconds (Optimum) [Buy on DVD]\n\nLast Action Hero (Sony) [Buy on Blu-ray]\n\nLaw & Order: UK – Series 1 (Universal Playback) [Buy on DVD]\n\nNight Boat to Dublin (Optimum) [Buy on DVD]\n\nNine Men (Optimum)\n\nPainted Boats (Optimum) [Buy on DVD]\n\nShadows in the Sun (Artificial Eye) [Buy on DVD]\n\nSorority Row (E1 Entertainment) [Buy on DVD | Buy on Blu-ray]\n\nSpring and Port Wine (Optimum) [Buy on DVD]\n\nStreet Trash (Arrow Video) [Buy on DVD]\n\nThe Lost Continent (Optimum) [Buy on DVD]\n\nThe Proud Valley (Optimum) [Buy on DVD]\n\nThe World Ten Times Over (Optimum) [Buy on DVD]\n\nTickle Me (Optimum) [Buy on DVD]\n\nWrong Turn 3: Left for Dead ( Fox) [Buy on DVD]\n\n[ad]\n\n> UK cinema releases for Friday 8th January including It’s Complicated, The Road and Daybreakers\n\n> The Best DVD and Blu-ray releases of 2009\n\n> UK cinema releases for 2009\n\nThe above short film The Third & The Seventh by Alex Roman is an incredible example of CGI animation.
