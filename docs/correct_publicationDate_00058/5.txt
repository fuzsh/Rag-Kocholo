Robinson, Kim Stanley. FIFTY DEGREES BELOW. [New York]: Bantam Books, [2005]. Octavo, pictorial wrappers. Advance reading copy of the first edition. Sequel to FORTY SIGNS OF RAIN (2004). Robinson's third trilogy -- the Capital Code sequence comprising FORTY SIGNS OF RAIN (2004), FIFTY DEGREES BELOW (2005) and SIXTY DAYS AND COUNTING Days (2007) -- again faces the near future directly, in this case at a point when climate change has begun -- it would seem undeniably -- to transform the world as the Gulf Stream fails, Washington is drowned, and weather patterns worldwide become hugely turbulent. The sequence focuses on America, on American politics, on right-wing American climate change denial, and ultimately on some radical technological fixes for what seems to be an irreversible series of disasters. There is no clear sense that the solutions offered here will work -- even if the American government manages to attempt to implement them -- but Robinson's perpetually active protagonists struggle on: hoping to make the story of technological fix come true." - SFE (online).
