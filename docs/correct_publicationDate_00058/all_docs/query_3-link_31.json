        "text": "Name: Kim Stanley Robinson Well known science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson lives in Davis with his wife and children. His most popular work is the award-winning Mars trilogy. A detailed biography is available on Wikipedia.\n\nWorks include:\n\nThe Three Californias Trilogy:\n\nThe Wild Shore (1984)\n\nThe Gold Coast (1988)\n\nPacific Edge (1990)\n\nThe Mars Trilogy:\n\nRed Mars (1993)\n\nGreen Mars (1994)\n\nBlue Mars (1996)\n\nplus\n\nThe Martians (1999) - Not a sequel, but a collection of works related to the Mars trilogy.\n\nScience in the Capital:\n\nForty Signs of Rain (2004)\n\nFifty Degrees Below (2005)\n\nSixty Days and Counting (Feb 27, 2007)\n\nStandalone Novels:\n\nIcehenge (1984)\n\nThe Memory of Whiteness (1985)\n\nA Short, Sharp Shock (1990)\n\nAntarctica (1997)\n\nThe Years of Rice and Salt (2002)\n\n\"Galileo's Dream\" (2009)\n\n\"2312\" (2012)\n\nCollections:\n\nThe Planet of the Table (1986)\n\nEscape from Kathmandu (1990)\n\nRemaking History (1991)\n\nHis alternate history novel The Years of Rice and Salt is partially set in Davis, as are portions of The Martians, a companion book to the Mars trilogy. Though not set in Davis, issues discussed in many of his books, such as Cooperative Housing and businesses, Choice Voting, false/post scarcity economics, Climate Change, and trying to clear nutsedge out of gardens, will feel familiar to Davisites. Robinson's latest book, Fifty Degrees Below also featured Disc Golf in a Washington DC park, which may have also come from his residency in town.\n\nKim Stanley Robinson occasionally has book signings at Davis Bookstores, and signed copies of his books can often be found at The Avid Reader and Bogey's Books. He is an occasional speaker on campus, and has been seen at the Davis Food Co-op and Sudwerk.\n\nSee also: Published Authors\n\nHe was an activist regarding West Village. Before it was built, he wrote an op-ed for the Davis Enterprise suggesting it be built north and south of Hutchison Drive parallel to Highway 113 without bordering Russell Boulevard and helped with legal action by a West Davis residents group.\n\nQuoted from KSR's editorial printed by the Davis Enterprise, April 17, 2005: \"The university's administration, frustrated by Davis' commitment to slow growth, decided to build its own town. And when it comes to the University of California system, we do not have enough of the checks and balances that elsewhere serve American government so well.\" [entire letter is at: http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&p_theme=aggregated5&p_action=doc&p_docid=10993CD78D52622A&p_docnum=3&p_queryname=2 ]\n\nThis guy needs to start editing the wiki! - KenjiYamada\n\nI'm a big fan... where do I find more information about his current projects and dates of his talks in Davis? - ClaireB\n\nAccording to my sources in the publishing community he doesn't have anything scheduled to be released, but there is one that is supposed to be out next year (but there is no set date). However since he has done a lot of short stories over time, its hard to say what he may or may not be working on without me just calling him up and asking. Of course, that'd be sorta rude. Although, I suppose I could call up Random House and ask... -SunjeetBaadkar"
