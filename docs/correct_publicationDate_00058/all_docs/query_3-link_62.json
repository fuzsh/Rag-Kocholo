        "text": "The University of California San Diego Library’s Author Talk Series – in partnership with the Academic Senate Committee on Campus Climate Change – is concluding its third consecutive year of programming on April 17 with internationally-acclaimed author and prominent UC San Diego alum, Kim Stanley Robinson ’74, PhD ’82. Hosted at UC San Diego’s Sally T. WongAvery Library and part of the university’s 8th annual Earth Month celebration, the event will take a deep dive into how we can best tackle climate change today and into the future.\n\nThe evening’s discussion will focus on Robinson’s bestselling novel “The Ministry for the Future,” which begins in a fictional 2025 at the harrowing height of a lethal heatwave. The plot is centered around a group of individuals referred to as “the Ministry for the Future” whose mission is to act as an advocate for the world’s future generations. While the ministers pursue various projects, responding to climate change is the core of their work.\n\nAt the start of the event, attendees will hear presentations from four students acting as a ministry for the future of our region. Calling upon their research, activism and expertise, the students will speak as “ministers” of their own future lives and those of subsequent generations, articulating a vision of what UC San Diego can do to protect the environment. Participants include:\n\nMinister of Atmosphere, Ke’La Kimble, PhD candidate in analytical and atmospheric chemistry, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry\n\nMinister of Health, Emmet Norris, PhD student in geoscience, Scripps Institution of Oceanography\n\nMinister of Finance, Emma Rodriguez ’23, business economics major, Thurgood Marshall College\n\nMinister of Energy, Alex Andriatis, PhD candidate in physical oceanography, Scripps Institution of Oceanography\n\nA moderated conversation with Robinson – led by Audrey Geisel University Librarian Erik T. Mitchell – will follow the student presentations.\n\nRobinson is the author of more than twenty books, including the international bestselling “Mars” trilogy, “New York 2140,” “Aurora,” “Shaman,” “Green Earth” and “2312,” which was a New York Times bestseller nominated for all seven of the major science fiction awards — a first for any book. In 2008, he was named a Hero of the Environment by Time magazine. In 2016, he was given the Heinlein Award for lifetime achievement in science fiction, and asteroid 72432 was named Kimrobinson in his honor. One year later, in 2017, he was given the Arthur C. Clarke Award for Imagination in Service to Society.\n\nA prolific writer and speaker, his work has appeared in The New York Times, The Washington Post, Newsweek, Nature and Wired, among many others. His novel “The Ministry for the Future” was selected as one of Barack Obama’s Favorite Books of 2020 and one of Bill Gates’ 5 Great Books for the Summer in 2022.\n\nEvent Details:\n\nA Conversation with Kim Stanley Robinson ’74, PhD ’82Monday, April 17, 2023 | 6 p.m. PT\n\nUC San Diego Sally T.
