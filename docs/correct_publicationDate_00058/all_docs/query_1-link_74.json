        "text": "Down to Earth With: Award-winning sci-fi novelist Kim Stanley Robinson\n\nby Cassandra Willyard Friday, March 9, 2018\n\nDon’t let Kim Stanley Robinson fool you. He may know a lotâabout the geography of Mars and ocean acidification, but he’s no scientist. He’s an award-winning science fiction novelist. Yet the science in his books is so convincing that many fans can’t helpâbut be duped.\n\nRobinson has been writing science fiction for more than 30 years, andâclimate change has been an enduring theme. His most famous trilogy,âabout Mars, follows scientists and engineers as they try to make the climate of the red planet more Earth-like. And his most recent trilogy â which includes “Forty Signs of Rain, Fifty Degrees Below,” and “Sixty Days and Counting” â focuses on a group of scientists at the NationalâScience Foundation tasked with mitigating the impacts of a warming world. EARTH reporter Cassandra Willyard recently asked Robinson about his work, his devotion to scientific accuracy and his next book.\n\nCW: What prompted you to start writingâscience fiction?\n\nKSR: When I ran into science fictionâthere was something very familiar aboutâit. It seemed to be describing realityâthe way I saw it in my own life betterâthan the other kinds of fiction that I hadâalready enjoyed.\n\nCW: Who was the first science fictionâauthor you read?\n\nKSR: Without really knowing it, itâwas Jules Verne, because his books wereâput in the regular fiction section of myâhometown library. A lot of his stuff looksâlike boys' adventure fiction with exoticâsettings, and I didn’t really think of it asâbeing different until later.\n\nCW: You’re most famous for your trilogyâabout humans settling on Mars. Is thatâsomething you see in our future?\n\nKSR: Yes. I think that if humanityâmanages to get into balance with thisâplanet and makes a good sustainableâcivilization here, then going to Marsââ studying it, exploring it and, overâthe really long haul, settling it â probablyâwill happen. The timeline couldâbe really long. I think it’s going to beâmost valuable as a study zone and anâexperimental space that teaches usâthings about how planets work â notâas an escape hatch or some place weâcan go after blowing it here. That’s notârealistic and it wouldn’t be good evenâif it were.\n\nCW: Your latest trilogy is about climateâchange. What prompted you to tackleâthat topic?\n\nKSR: The Martian books wereâabout climate change too. That’s whatâterraforming is. I was thinking all alongâwhen I was writing them, “Gosh we’reâalready terraforming Earth except we’reâgoing backwards and making it worse,âless friendly to the current life forms.”âSo we need to start thinking aboutâterraforming Earth in a positive sense.âScience is so powerful in our civilizationâand yet it seems to be a little bit cut outâof the policymaking process. Therefore,âthe priorities that civilization sets areâsometimes not very scientific. I thoughtâthat was dangerous enough to be talkedâabout and that a novel could bring allâthese things together.\n\nCW: How much do you worry aboutâscientific accuracy?\n\nKSR: I try to be meticulous withoutâbeing perfectionist, because you can’tâachieve perfection. I began as an Englishâmajor, so I don’t have a strong scientificâor mathematical background. I’veâmade a lot of mistakes in my novels.âAnd what happens is people write meâletters or send me e-mails and they’reâeither outraged or they’re amused. Andâso then I put the fixes in as the booksâare reprinted.\n\nCW: Your wife is a scientist. Does sheâhelp you out?\n\nKSR: Yes. She’s an environmentalâchemist working for the U.S. GeologicalâSurvey. She’s one of those scientists whoâare pretty particular about not speculatingâwhen they don’t know something. Iâcan’t be that way, being a science fictionâwriter. I speculate all the time aboutâthings I know nothing about. It’s just aâdanger of the game. But a lot of times I’llâask her, “What about this?” And she’llâsay, “How am I supposed to know?”âAnd I’ll say, “Well, God, you’re a scientist.”âAnd she’ll just laugh.\n\nCW: What’s the next book?"
