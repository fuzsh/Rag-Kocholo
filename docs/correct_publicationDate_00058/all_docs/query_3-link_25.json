        "text": "Long Now Talks are made possible through the generous support of The Long Now Membership and our Seminar Sponsors. We offer $5,000 and $15,000 annual Sponsorships, both of which entitle the sponsor and a guest to reserved seating at all Long Now seminars and special events. In addition, we invite $15,000 Sponsors to attend dinner with the speaker after each Seminar, and $5,000 Sponsors may choose to attend any four dinners during the sponsored year. For more information about donations and Seminar Sponsorship, please contact donate@longnow.org. We are a public 501(c)(3) non-profit, and donations to us are always tax deductible.\n\nOver the coming months, Long Now will continue to roll out more of this new website. This site is designed to work better across devices, and hopefully makes it easier to discover what Long Now is all about.\n\nParts of the site may look inconsistent, and some links may break while we work. We appreciate your patience, and we would love to hear what you think of the changes."
