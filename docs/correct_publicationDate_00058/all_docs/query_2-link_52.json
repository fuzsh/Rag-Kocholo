        "text": "Bestselling, award-winning author Kim Stanley Robinson continues his groundbreaking trilogy of eco-thrillers—and propels us deeper into the awesome whirlwind of climatic change. Set in our nation's capital, here is a chillingly realistic tale of people caught in the collision of science, technology, and the...\n\nconsequences of global warming—which could trigger another phenomenon: abrupt climate change, resulting in temperatures... When the storm got bad, scientist Frank Vanderwal was at work, formalizing his return to the National Science Foundation for another year.\n\nHe'd left the building just in time to help sandbag at Arlington Cemetery. Now that the torrent was over, large chunks of San Diego had eroded into the sea, and D.C. was underwater.\n\nShallow lakes occupied the most famous parts of the city. Reagan Airport was awash and the Potomac had spilled beyond its banks. Rescue boats dotted the saturated cityscape. Everything Frank and his colleagues in the halls of science and politics feared had culminated in this massive disaster. And now the world looked to them to fix it.\n\nWhatever Frank can do, now that he is homeless, he'll have to do from his car. He's not averse to sleeping outdoors. Years of research have made him hyperaware of his status as just another primate.\n\nThat plus his encounter with a Tibetan Buddhist has left him resolved to live a more authentic life. Hopefully, this will prepare him for whatever is to come.... For even as D.C. bails out from the flood, a more extreme climate change looms.\n\nWith the melting of the polar ice caps shutting down the warm waters of the Gulf Stream, another Ice Age could be imminent. The last time it happened, 11,000 years ago, it took just three years to start.\n\nBONUS AUDIO: Includes an exclusive introduction by author Kim Stanley Robinson."
