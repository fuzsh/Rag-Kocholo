        "text": "The Science In The Capital trilogy consists of three novels by Kim Stanley Robinson that explore the interaction of science and politics in the United States capital, Washington, D.C.. They were also marketed as the Capital Code trilogy and have also been called the 40/50/60 novels. An omnibus edition, but with compressed and amended text, came out under the title Green Earth.\n\nBecause of their basis in realistic situations, their depiction of topical themes and their setting in a time quasi-concurrent with the present at the time of their writing, they are notable for the sense of urgency that transpires from them. Serious weight is given to the need to tackle climate change on both national policy and international relations levels. They were written during the presidency of George W. Bush, whose ideology and policy-making was opposed to taking any action that was significant enough on these matters.\n\nThe three novels are:\n\nForty Signs Of Rain\n\n(2004)\n\nFifty Degrees Below\n\n(2005)\n\nSixty Days And Counting\n\n(2007)\n\nGreen Earth\n\nCompressed omnibus (2015)\n\nThemes and concepts\n\nAbrupt climate change and the thermohaline circulation in the Gulf Stream\n\nModern urban lifestyle and \"repaleolithization\"\n\nCapitalism and permaculture\n\nThe prisoner's dilemma and morality\n\nOptimodal living and Buddhism\n\nEmerson and transcendentalism\n\nScientific research, the merit review process and science in politics\n\nRunaway surveillance and intelligence agencies\n\n(to develop)\n\nCharacters\n\nMain page: List of Science In The Capital trilogy characters\n\nFrank Vanderwal\n\nThe Quiblers\n\nCharlie Quibler\n\nAnna Quibler\n\nJoe Quibler\n\nNick Quibler\n\nPhil Chase\n\nDiane Chang\n\nCaroline Churchland\n\nThe trilogy shares some characters with the novel Antarctica, more specifically US Senator Phil Chase and his envoy√© to Antarctica Wade Norton.\n\nSettings\n\nMain page: Places in the Science In The Capital trilogy\n\nThe main setting for the trilogy is, of course, the nation's capital, Washington. There are frequent visits to California, a hub for biotechnologies research, and occasional visits to other places around the world (the island nation of Khembalung, the Atlantic ocean, China).\n\nReviews\n\nReviews for the whole trilogy\n\nSoul of Star Trek\n\nReviews for Green Earth"
