        "text": "The meta-crisis is so vast: climate change, exponential technology, addiction, polarization, and more. How do we grasp it, let alone take steps to address it?Â\n\nOne of the thinking tools we have at our disposal is science fiction. To the extent that we co-evolve with our stories, science fiction can prepare us for the impending future â and empower us to shape it.\n\nThis week on Your Undivided Attention, we're thrilled to have one of the greatest living science-fiction writers â Kim Stanley Robinson. His most recent novel is The Ministry for the Future, a sweeping epic that reaches into the very near future, and imagines what it would take to unite humanity and avoid a mass extinction. Whether or not you've read the book, this episode has insights for you. And if this episode makes you want to read the book, our conversation won't spoil it for you.\n\nClarification: In the episode, Robinson refers to philosopher Antonio Gramsci's \"pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will.\" This phrase was originally said by novelist and playwright Romain Rolland. Gramsci made the phrase the motto of his newspaper, because he appreciated its integration of radical intellectualism with revolutionary activism.\n\nMinistry For The Future\n\nRobinson's latest novel and the subject of our conversation â which reaches into the near future, and imagines what it would take to unite humanity and avoid a mass extinction\n\nA Deeper Dive Into the Meta Crisis\n\nCHT's blog post about the meta-crisis, which includes the fall of sense-making and the rise of decentralized technology-enabled powerÂ\n\nHalf Earth Project\n\nThe project based on E. O. Wilson's proposal to conserve half the land and sea â in order to safeguard the bulk of biodiversity, including ourselves\n\nClimateAction.tech\n\nGlobal tech worker community mobilizing the technology industry to face the climate crisis"
