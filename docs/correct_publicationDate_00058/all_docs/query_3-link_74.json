        "text": "Kim Stanley Robinson is generally acknowledged as one of the greatest living American science fiction writers. The three novels of his Mars trilogy - Red Mars, Green Mars, and Blue Mars, have won major science fiction and fantasy accolades, including Hugo and Nebula awards.\n\nKim Stanley Robinson is known for using science fiction to address social issues such as history, politics, sexuality and gender, arguing that science fiction is an inherently political genre because it offers the possibility of alternate futures and histories. In the Mars trilogy Robinson used Mars as a template to create a credible utopia."
