Another Ice Age could be imminent. The last time it happened, eleven thousand years ago, it took just three years to start. The good news is that Diane Chang is leading the National Science Foundation in an international effort to restabilize Earth's climate. Anna Quibler is part of it, along with her formidable mind.

But Frank has fallen in love with one mysterious woman and is attracted to another who happens to be his boss, the blackblack world of Homeland Security has developed an interest in him, and he's living a paleolithic lifestyle in a tree house in Rock Creek Park as winter closes in, the worst on record, fifty degrees below:- Review(s): \"Kim Stanley Robinson is at his visionary best in this gripping cautionary tale of progress and its price as our world faces catastrophic climate change.
