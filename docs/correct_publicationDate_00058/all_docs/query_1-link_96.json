        "text": "VJ Books Presents Author Kim Stanley Robinson!\n\nKim Stanley Robinson was born in 1952 in Waukegan, Illinois, and grew up in Orange County, California. He discovered science fiction in college and was fascinated. He graduated with a degree in Literature from the University of California, San Diego, and then went on to do his masters in English at Boston University. While an undergraduate he came up with the idea for a series of books which explored three potential alternate futures set in southern California. This idea would later become his Orange County trilogy.\n\nRobinson returned to the University of California, San Diego to do his PhD. He took a break in his studies and lived in Davis, California, where he met his future wife. After completing his studies, they were married, and he began teaching at the University of California, Davis. When his wife's career as an environmental chemist took them to Switzerland, he began writing full time, and when they moved back to the states and had their first child, he became a stay-at-home father, which left him plenty of time to continue writing.\n\nRobinson is best known for his Mars trilogy, which has won numerous awards, including Hugo and Nebula Awards. His work tends to have strong political themes and feature scientists as protagonists. In 2016, Robinson was awarded the Robert A. Heinlein Award for the entire body of his work.\n\nWhen not writing, Robinson enjoys mountaineering, softball, and frisbee golf. He lives in Davis, California with his wife and their two sons.\n\nKim Stanley Robinson Book List and Awards\n\nAuthor's website: www.kimstanleyrobinson.info\n\nSimilar authors: William Gibson, George R.R.
