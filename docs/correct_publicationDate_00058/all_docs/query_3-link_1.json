        "text": "First of all, some sad news. Terry Bisson, fellow Bay Area science fiction author and friend of KSR, passed away recently. Coincidentally, KSR had recently chimed in about Bisson in a New Yorker profile. He also wrote an appreciation for Bisson in February's issue of Locus.\n\nThe High Sierra\n\nWe first start with things around the non-fiction The High Sierra: A Love Story, because we don't talk enough about it!\n\nKSR was interviewed about it by the US Times Post: Sci-fi novelist Kim Stanley Robinson talks ‘The High Sierra’\n\nThere are many places on this planet that are incredibly beautiful and adorable. You don’t have to burn a lot of carbon to have a good time. The basics of Paleolithic contentment remain the same within us and are readily available. The technological sublime is indeed sublime, but like a drug rush – it’s expensive and can be tiring. The ordinary pleasures are better all around. Walking is one of those pleasures – we evolved to walk better! And hiking in the mountains is fun, but so is hiking in the city or pretty much anywhere else.\n\nHe spoke to The Tahoe Weekly: A science fiction writer’s love affair with the High Sierra\n\nHe discussed at the UC Davis Tahoe Environmental Research Center (YouTube video)\n\nHe spoke to the Pacific Zen Institute's podcast on The High Sierra: The Zen Luminaries\n\nThe High Sierra also won some awards! Here they are, with short online KSR interventions:\n\nCommonwealth Club: 92nd Annual California Book Awards (award ceremony video on YouTube)\n\nCalifornia Independent Booksellers Alliance: Golden Poppy Awards: Glenn Goldman Award: California Lifestyle (award ceremony video on YouTube)\n\nSome book excerpts are available:\n\nOn John Muir, along with various other KSR quotes on John Muir:\n\nThe flooding of Hetch Hetchy was a knife thrust into the heart of the wilderness movement. [...] But the war is never over. And as I looked down on the scene that misty evening, I saw the water drain away. It will happen someday. There is no rush about this, and given the emergency century we are entering, it isn’t even close to the highest priority. But put it this way: if civilization gets itself in a balance with the planet, a day will come when we will drain that misbegotten death lake and let the valley go back to the way it was. It will be one of the greatest experiments in landscape restoration ever conducted.\n\nA 1988 poem by KSR is included in the book: Night Poem:\n\nWriting by starlight\n\nCan’t see the words\n\nFill a page\n\nNothing there\n\nWaterfall distant sound\n\nTree against stars Milky Way\n\nJuniper Jupiter white rock\n\nWind dying my heart\n\nAt peace a Friday night\n\nBig Dipper sits on the mountain\n\nFriends lie in their tents\n\nI sit against rock\n\nStar bowl spinning overhead\n\nFeel the movement\n\nAnd soar away\n\nWho knows how many stars there are\n\nAll those dim ones filling the black\n\nUntil it seems no black is there\n\nAnd then you see the Milky Way\n\nThe sky should be pure white with stars\n\nThat’s black dust up there\n\nBlocking the view\n\nCarbon and hydrogen\n\nAll of us flung together\n\nIn just this way\n\nA blank white page\n\nI write and then\n\nA blank white page\n\nStory of my life!\n\nSome recommendations for The High Sierra at The Atlantic, Visit California, and University of California.\n\nThe interviews\n\nNow, on to the usual long list of interviews with Kim Stanley Robinson which are mostly about The Ministry for the Future -- catching up with several that I missed the last time, too, approximately chronologically:\n\nKSR was interviewed for the inaugural issue of Solarpunk Magazine!\n\nInterview at The Great Simplification podcast: Climate, Fiction, and The Future\n\nInterview at the Rising Tide podcast: KSR's Science and Fiction\n\n(Print) interview by Liz Jensen at Writers Rebel (of Extinction Rebellion): Q&A with KSR\n\nWe now need public action (government) to be driving all private actions that are relevant to the crucial project; what work gets paid for and done, what consumption patterns are allowed, etc. This is not ‘green fascism’ any more than the Allied response to Nazi aggression was ‘democratic fascism’; it’s more a case of democratically approved coordinated public action in strong support of the public good. Legal action is needed for that. But it’s also an “all hands on deck” situation now, so no one solution will suffice. We need action across all fronts of society.\n\n(Video) interview with Grist's Looking Forward, following their book club on Ministry for the Future: \"At least zombies aren’t eating my face\" (video on Vimeo)\n\nAt a certain point, dystopia has run its course of what it can do usefully. So then you need the positive stories. I’ve been writing utopias since about 1987, so that’s adding up to a lot of years of just trying to do the positive because I think we need it more. And it’s harder, technically — it’s less dramatic. But it’s interesting because you get new stories that haven’t been told before.\n\nKSR appearance at the 2023 Learning Planet Festival (YouTube video replay)\n\nInterview by Madrid's La Casa Encendida: Nuevas ecotopías para estos tiempos (YouTube video, dubbed-over in Spanish)\n\nKSR lecture at the University of San Diego's Kroc School Institute for Peace and Justice: KSR Talks Climate Change (YouTube video) (also in the podcast Is The World On Fire?)\n\nUC Davis Environmental Humanities: \"Ministries for Future\" - Donna Haraway and Kim Stanley Robinson (video) (+ Davis Vanguard article on the event)\n\nNew Hope Network has some highlights from KSR's appearance at the 2023 Natural Products Expo West for Climate Day: Science fiction offers roadmap for our planet's future\n\nBC Heights has some highlights from KSR's appearance at the Boston College Lowell Humanities Series: Robinson Outlines Ways To Fight the Runaway Greenhouse Effect\n\nKSR talked again at the Bioneers conference and gives an update: What I’ve Learned since The Ministry for the Future Came Out in 2020 (YouTube video)\n\nKSR was at two events hosted by the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine, here are the recordings on YouTube: Coffee & Conversation: Sci-fi and Our Climate Reality and Summer Institute: Space: Our Last Great Commons\n\nKSR was interviewed by Bloomberg along with a TV writer and a podcaster on: How to Write a Climate Thriller Fit for Page or Screen\n\n“Dystopia is too easy,” Robinson says. “It's even a kind of comfort food, where we imagine situations worse than ours, and then rest comfortably that we're not that bad.”\n\nTo avoid writing futures so optimistic they beggar belief, Robinson borrows a concept from the sci-fi author Joanna Russ: the “optopia.”\n\n“It's not the utopia — the no place, the perfect place,” Robinson says. “It's the optimum that we can do given the situation that we're handed. If we dodge a climate catastrophe and a mass extinction event in this century, that's a utopian story.”\n\nKSR was interviewed by the Centre for Science Futures' new podcast series in partnership with Nature: \"Science as a political and ethical project\" (see also Nature for a shorter version, with transcript).\n\nWhile in the Netherlands, KSR spoke at the John Adams Institute: Kim Stanley Robinson and the Fight for Planet Earth (YouTube video), along with environmental scientist Heleen de Coninck and author Lisa Doeland.\n\nKSR appeared on a short video by PBS Terra on Geoengineering\n\nHot Globe interviewed KSR: The Future of the Future (partly paywalled)\n\nIt isn’t going to be machinery that solves our problems. But on the other hand, it is going to be technology because language is a technology. Justice is a technology, law is a technology. They're software. And so any argument against technology misunderstands human beings. We were technological before we were human. We had fire. We had stone tools. We co-evolved with our technologies. And language is the crucial one. And I would agree with those people who say the crucial technologies right now are political economy and finance.\n\nKSR was interviewed by the Possible podcast, on Ministry but also Aurora, Galileo's Dream and more: KSR on the Future of Civilization (on Spotify) + a transcript on their site\n\nOne of the things that has gotten stronger for me as the last 40 years have passed is a conviction that humanity coevolved with Earth. It will never prosper off of Earth. Our trips off of Earth are trips into the death zone, which is what climbers call the elevations above about 26,000 feet, where the body starts to break down [...] this information that now is common—50% of the DNA inside your body is not human DNA. Well, this is news, and it changes everything. Because you can’t take Earth with you when you go off, even to the moon or Mars, much less off into interstellar space, where I have actually written an entire novel suggesting we’re not going to the stars because we coevolved with Earth, and we’re only healthy here. And in my solar-system novels—where you can see some from the mid-eighties and some from the last 10 years—you’ll see a shift in that in the ones in the last 10 years, people always have to go back to Earth for their sabbatical. They have to go back and eat some dirt. They have to get connected with the biosphere of Earth, which is their extended body, in order to be healthy again.\n\nKSR talked to the Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs: Why does the world now need to consider solar radiation modification? (YouTube video)\n\nThe Economist interviewed KSR and Laurence Tubiana on the the need for fiction about climate change on their podcast Babbage: Climate fiction meets climate fact (on Spotify)\n\nThe Science in The Fiction podcast does one writer and one scientst episode: KSR talked about Ministry (on Spotify) and glaciologist Heidi Sevestre talked geoengineering\n\nSam Matey's The Weekly Anthropocene interviewed KSR: Kim Stanley Robinson, Science Fiction Maestro and Utopian\n\nWhen I look at the timeline of Ministry for the Future I'm very pleased to report that there are some sentences in it that no longer conform at all to reality as it's going. One chapter begins, “the 2030s were zombie years.” And that is now wrong! [...] it's going so much faster that I think the timeline in Ministry for the Future is completely off. We're already in the ferment that in my novel I have happening in the 2040s.\n\nThe Everyday Anarchism podcast continued its coverage of KSR's works with the Mars trilogy and an interview with KSR: Revolution and Anarchism in The Mars Trilogy\n\nThe Futurists podcast talks with KSR on his Mars trilogy, economics, world building, science and climate: Minister for the Future (Part 1 and Part 2)\n\nBerkeley Talks podcast...talks with KSR: Sci-fi writer Kim Stanley Robinson on the need for 'angry optimism' (including a transcript)\n\nHaving put a climate disaster that kills millions in India, I felt obliged to India. I needed to stay there. I needed it to be the solution and not just an excuse for an American to put the problems on the other side of the world and then we solve them. I needed Indians involved in solving it. They are in huge danger from a wet bulb event, although one of the hottest wet bulb events ever recorded was outside of Chicago.\n\nSo it isn't like we're not in danger, but India's in real danger. I mean more present, more immediate. And I wanted to stick with them. And the book has been well-received in India. I mean, aside from the occasional hate mail from BJP party nationalists, but by and large, the Indians have said to this book, \"Oh yes, Farhanji is finally understood. We are the center of the story and we're going to solve the problem here.\"\n\nRadio Ecoshock / podcast interviewed KSR about Ministry and The High Sierra: Climate Sci-Fi Gets Too Real\n\nKSR gave a lecture at Stony Brook University for its special series on climate change, and the whole thing is on YouTube.\n\nAnd finally (for now!), Palma podcast interviewed KSR: What We Imagine, We Make Possible (on Spotify)\n\nThe rest\n\nWe continue with some additional material:\n\nThe book clubs discussing Ministry for the Future continue with Trinity College Dublin and South Burlington Public Library (Vermont).\n\nRecommendations continue with The Conversation (Five fiction books to inspire climate action), The New York Times (This Is the Way the World Ends; paywall), The National (Earth Day: 12 novels to read with an environmental protection theme), The Seattle Times (Dig into these 4 books for Earth Day), and The Washington Post (10 books that will transform how you see nature, paywall), where Nnedi Okorafor writes:\n\nI read “The Ministry for the Future,” by Kim Stanley Robinson, as I was in the process of moving to Phoenix. The novel starts with a deadly heat wave in India. Issues of water shortages and extreme heat were very much on my mind. I knew of Phoenix’s brutal summers, but was yet to experience one. The stark step-by-step details of this catastrophic event that leaves millions dead was such a terrifying read that it nearly gave me a panic attack. I had nightmares. After reading the first part, I went on to take some very aggressive (and expensive) precautions. “The Ministry for the Future” opened my eyes wider to how the Earth is changing and alarmed me in a way that only great science fiction can.\n\nReviews and articles inspired by Ministry:\n\nHenry Farrell on Ministry's political economy (in response to the NYT article above)\n\nAdventures with Psychologists: Tim Hall of Yale '62 discusses Ministry\n\nBen Shread-Hewitt (on Resilience.org) reviews Ministry and Stephen Markley's The Deluge\n\nOnce more the heat waves are upon us, and this opinion on Aljazeera mentions Ministry\n\nWhat's next? KSR's next non-fiction book on Antarctica, in the same style as The High Sierra, is due out soon-ish -- he is turning it in to his publisher in July.\n\nIt's structured like my book The High Sierra: A Love Story— the same format, in that it will have a variety of modes, including lyric realism as you called it, memoir, history, geology, and this case, glaciology. I'm enjoying this kind of modular miscellany, or just the kitchen sink principle— just throw in everything. It helps me to do non-fiction.\n\nAnd KSR will soon be heading to northern Italy, as he will be one of the residents of the Rockefeller Foundation Bellagio Center!\n\n(Top image: from the poster of the fiction film How To Blow Up A Pipeline, inspired by Andreas Malm's non-fiction book)\n\nThe world turns and I'm back with another impressively long list of links on everything KSR!\n\nKim Stanley Robinson's latest column in Bloomberg Green is on: \"Kim Stanley Robinson Makes the Case for Counting Your Carbon\":\n\nBecause not much is left in the budget, individual choices are worth thinking about and then changing.\n\n[..] There’s even danger that raising the question of how we live risks shifting the burden of change away from governments and corporations. That’s why the fossil fuel industry was the first to promote the individual “carbon footprint,” rather than face the poisonousness of its own product.\n\nIt’s also true that individual action can do only so much to decrease the carbon burn of civilization, given its current infrastructure. An individual’s most powerful form of action remains politically supporting laws to curb emissions. It’s usually not very hard to figure out which politicians will do this. These are the real levers of effective action for individuals in our time: mobilization, solidarity, political mass action.\n\n[...] So pay attention; feel your body; think it over. Be mindful of your carbon burn, and make what you burn really count. Don’t waste it. We’ve been cocooned in fossil fuels for too long, and busting out of that sheath of crap back into the wide world will be a liberation.\n\nInterviews\n\nKSR was interviewed by James Bradley for the collection Tomorrow's Parties, edited by Jonathan Strahan, with \"Twelve visions of living in a climate-changed world\" consisting of short stories, artwork, and the KSR interview. The interview itself is available:\n\nSo “2312” was written in 2010. In that novel, I provided a timeline of sorts, looking backward from 2312, that was notional and intended to shock, also to fill the many decades it takes to make three centuries, and in a way that got my story in place the way I wanted it. In other words, it was a literary device, not a prediction. But it’s interesting now to look back and see me describing “the Dithering” as lasting so long. These are all affect states, not chronological predictions; I think it’s very important to emphasize science fiction’s double action, as both prophecy and metaphor for our present. As prophecy, SF is always wrong; as metaphor, it is always right, being an expression of the feeling of the time of writing.\n\nSo following that, “The Ministry for the Future” was written in 2019, before the pandemic. It expresses both fears and hopes specific to 2019 — and now, because of the shock of the pandemic, it can serve as an image of “how it felt before.” It’s already a historical artifact. That’s fine, and I think it might be possible that the book can be read better now than it could have been in January 2020 when I finished it.\n\nNow I don’t think there will be a period of “zombie years,” and certainly not the 2030s. The pandemic as a shock has sped up civilization’s awareness of the existential dangers of climate change. Now, post COVID, a fictional future history might speak of the “Trembling Twenties” as it’s described in “The Ministry for the Future,” but it also seems it will be a period of galvanized, spasmodic, intense struggle for control over history, starting right now. With that new feeling, the 2030s seem very far off and impossible to predict at all.\n\nKSR was, once more, interviewed by Jacobin: \"We Need Democratic Socialism\"\n\nThat being the case, maybe now we can say this: we need to pressure our political representatives to do the right things for us and the biosphere. Mass demonstrations, either entirely peaceful or with a violent edge, seem to me appropriate now. The failure of the Biden administration’s Build Back Better act is not an indictment of that administration, but of the US electorate and political class; we should have elected a real working majority. Missing by one vote does not invalidate the goal or even the method; we need more votes in the Senate to get a true working majority. Then that majority has to legislate and pass the legislation. That’s one obvious tactic. I also think that breaking machinery in ways that don’t hurt humans may be appropriate.\n\n[...] So, what I wanted to imagine in my novel is not any particular political formulation, but rather a messy and yet effective swerve away from a mass extinction event, which means, as a first step, away from neoliberal capitalism. One step at a time: I think we need first a refusal of austerity and neoliberalism, by way of Keynesian stimulus; then social democracy; then democratic socialism; and then on from there.\n\nKSR appeared on the VERGE 22 event and spoke on a panel together with Delton Chen.\n\nNPR's The Indicator from Planet Money podcast interviewed KSR and discussed the carbon coin idea\n\nKSR appeared on the Factually! podcast with Adam Conover to talk about The Science Fiction of Climate Change.\n\nKSR was interviewed by the Green Central Banking website: \"Stabilising money requires stabilising the biosphere\":\n\nWhat was your rationale for putting central banks at the heart of a near-future novel about climate change?\n\nA couple of factors. One, the job of rapid decarbonisation of our civilisation, and all the other things we need to do to dodge the mass extinction event we have begun, is really immense. It will therefore take a huge amount of money, representing human time and effort.\n\nAlso, a lot of this work isn’t necessarily profitable. Individuals are not clamouring to buy what is in effect a giant sewage system for the world, even if they like the idea of the result. Put these two factors together and we’re in big trouble, which we are. The central banks, being the creators and guarantors of money itself, need to be involved if we are to succeed.\n\nKSR spoke to North State Public Radio's Blue Dot podcast about The High Sierra.\n\nKSR appeared on the The Laura Flanders Show (video).\n\nKSR was interviewed by the Between the Covers podcast special on \"Crafting with Ursula [K. LeGuin]\".\n\nThe Gold Coast\n\nAlta Journal's California Book Club organized discussions around KSR's 1980s novel The Gold Coast.\n\nEssays and analyses:\n\nAnita Feilicelli on the book's influences and what it influenced in turn\n\nAnita Felicelli: ‘The Gold Coast’ Pictures Orange County in 2027\n\nCharles Finch: Past Meets Future\n\nAjay Orona: Vision As Moral Act\n\nStephanie Burt: The Simultaneity of Kim Stanley Robinson’s Past, Present, and Future Visions\n\nJohn Freeman: The High Costs of Convenience\n\nDavid Ulin: Why You Should Read\n\nAlso included: an excerpt from The Gold Coast; and \"Why I Write: An Acceptable Degree of Coherent Narrative\", a KSR piece directly adapted from his short story A Sensitive Dependence on Initial Conditions.\n\nThe book club was capped by a conversation between KSR, Cory Doctorow and host John Freeman. A recap of the event is available, video on YouTube, as well as a full transcript.\n\nIt turned into one of the most autobiographical novels that I ever wrote. And that's usually dangerous ground for me. I wouldn't recommend it. But this particular novel being the entirety of my 20s as written from my 30s, I was pleased with it that when I was done for one thing, the plot is a kind of a train wreck where the readers can see the train wreck coming, but none of the characters can.\n\n[...] So there you have dystopia with ordinary people.\n\n[...] Yeah, Jim McPherson, Kim Robinson, I went to McPherson High School. It's not particularly disguised that this is a novel about my earlier self and Jim is not a very good poet that was easy to imagine and becomes a kind of historian and doing prose poems, which is also something that maybe was speaking almost to my future self in the way that I was trying to do the rest of it. But Jim's recovery of Orange County's history, which is completely obscured and at first looks minor league indeed is really one of the things that pulls him out of the strange and shallow and kind of screwed up world that he's in at the time. All that, along with his trip to the Sierras with his friend Tashi, all that happened, I can say that.\n\nMinistry for the Future\n\nThree chapters from MftF were included in \"No More Fairy Tales: stories to save our planet\", \"an anthology of 24 top climate solutions wrapped up in engaging stories\" that was also distributed to the thousands of delegates and attendees of COP27. This is an initiative of The Green Stories Project, in association with Herculean Climate Solutions. (Note: these were chapters 42 on the carboni coin; 22 and 93 on slowing down glaciers melting.)\n\nMinistry for the Future reviews:\n\nCaroline Underhill and Kevin Skinner for the Socialist Worker\n\nCarly Madge for North Shore News\n\nCase Muller\n\nParade included MftF in its list of the 222 best books of all time (!).\n\nIt was also in the Indie SciFi/Fantasy Bestseller List (US-wide independent bookstores).\n\nPeople who recommended MftF:\n\nBusiness Day (South Africa)\n\nEuropean Council on Foreign Relations podcast\n\nClimate Council (Austrlaia)\n\nNew York Times Events \"How Can We Use Storytelling to Find a Way Out of the Climate Crisis?\", where KSR and Octavia Butler are discussed\n\nSlate Future Tense Newsletter: Sci-Fi’s Lessons for Balancing Climate Hope and Despair\n\nPhotographer and author Grant Sheehan\n\nMusician Brian Eno would like to do some MftF-inspired LARPing\n\nClimate activist Bill McKibben recommends MftF and NY2140\n\nPhilosopher Bruno Latour on Twitter: \"A good therapy for ecodepressed: place Graeber and Wengrow to open up the past & “The Ministry for the Future” by Robinson to open up the future.

The tribute recording is available online. File770 reported from the event.\n\nKSR spoke at the opening of the exhibition \"Science Fiction: Voyage to the Edge of Imagination\" at the London Science Museum. New York 2140 is featured in the exhibition.\n\nKSR recommends:\n\nKSR wrote the Introduction to a new edition of George R. Stewart's \"Earth Abides\", by Mariner Books.\n\nClaire Nelson’s \"SMART Futures for a Flourishing World\", A Paradigm Shift for Achieving Global Sustainability. KSR's endoresement: \"This visionary synthesis of our current global situation uses the tools of science fiction, prophecy, and policy analysis in combination to make a compelling description of where we are and where we could get to, in terms of making a good future for humanity.\"\n\nGaia Vince’s \"Nomad Century: How Climate Migration Will Reshape Our World\". KSR's endorsement: \"This book is a rather astounding addition to a growing body of thought that suggests the twenty-first century is going to include, and even require, lots of human migration--and that handled correctly, this could be part of a good adaptation to the climate and biosphere crisis we are now entering. What Vince gives us here is some cognitive mapping to understand the situation and see a way forward.\"\n\nMathias Thaler, from the University of Edinburgh, published \"No Other Planet: Utopian Visions for a Climate-Changed World\", particularly focusing on works by N.

This is going to be a big one!\n\nFirst off, some interviews with KSR, out promoting his latest book The High Sierra, but also the ever-timely The Ministry for the Future.\n\nBryan Alexander: Academia, climate change, and the future\n\nIf a real revolution leading to a real post-capitalism comes into being by way of the public insisting on it, by demonstrations and votes, then how would that be bad? It wouldn’t be bad. So to hope for it is not naive or stupid.\n\nThe New York Times: A Sci-Fi Writer Returns to Earth: ‘The Real Story Is the One Facing Us’\n\n“I decided that it was time to go directly at the topic of climate change,” Robinson said. “The real story is the one facing us in the next 30 years. It’s the most interesting story, but also the stakes are highest.”\n\nThe Sierra Club (of course!): Minister for the Sierra\n\n“When I was younger, I didn’t notice interactions with wild animals as being transformative and important,” he admitted. “Now when I see wild animals up there, it’s like sticking my finger in a wall socket.”\n\nThe Orange County Register: The Book Pages: Kim Stanley Robinson shares the books he loves — and a story that improved with age\n\nI like the cover of my novel “New York 2140” very much. Otherwise, to tell the truth, I don’t much notice covers.\n\nFatherly (Cory Doctorow): Growing Up Fast On Planet Earth\n\nI came home and I realized that it’s best to spend more time outdoors than we do. There’s a lot of people who know it’s fun to be outdoors because they’re carpenters and they’re outdoors all the time, and they like it. Farmers too. But writers, not so much. So a garden, working outdoors and then being an activist for environmentalist causes, greening everything in my life and my political aspirations of looking for what would be best for the biosphere.\n\nBook Forum: Mountain Song\n\nI start with a situation, usually. Say I want to write about terraforming Mars—then I need a terraformer, a person opposed to terraforming, a political radical, a Machiavel, a builder, a psychologist, etc. The French structuralists spoke of characters as actants, as the action-doers who make the plot happen. A single character could cover a couple of actants at once, or an actant could be split between a few characters. This I’ve found useful in clarifying things to myself as I get started. Therefore, characters are, at first, kind of just positions, or needed operators of the plot. But this is just the start.\n\nAnother useful conceptual tool is protagonicity. Does a novel have high protagonicity or low protagonicity—meaning the story is maybe spread out among a lot of different characters, who might be considered minor characters, except there aren’t any major characters. The story I intend to tell determines or suggests how I might go about deciding this.\n\nHigh County News: Seeing Mars on Earth\n\nI was surprised how many of my texts have some analogue to the High Sierra. Right from the start, I can see when Hjalmar Nederland is wandering around Mars in Icehenge, it was a Sierra wander. And that kept happening. It was true in my Mars Trilogy. To terraform Mars is really cheating. Mars is basalt rather than granite. It’s poisonous rather than healthy. So, turning Mars into the High Sierras required something like a 2,000-page novel to make it even slightly plausible. I like it when my novels find their way to get in a big walk\n\nSactown Magazine: Q&A with Sci-Fi Author Kim Stanley Robinson\n\nOnce you got up there above the treeline in the Sierra, you were in a different space that was cognitive and emotional and spiritual as much as it was physical. And I think that has to do with the whole sense that humans are only visitors there, nobody lives there year-round. There’s something different about it. It really did take the whole book to try to capture what we were talking about with this single phrase, you know, “up into the God zone.” What the heck did that mean? We were young hippies, all very Buddhist, so it was simplistic hippie stuff, almost a joke, but a joke about a real feeling.\n\nThe Times of India: Climate change is now the big story in world history\n\nI felt an obligation to stick with India, after deciding to put that first awful scene there, because it is in such a dangerous spot. I couldn’t just show the disaster and then walk away. Much of the novel is based in Zurich, Switzerland, the home base for my fictional Ministry for the Future, but the minister’s chief executive officer is an Indian (with a Nepali mother), and he and the minister and the story itself keep returning to India, to see what is going on there. This allowed me to show that positive developments in India, in agricultural practices and in governance, are world-class and could lead the rest of the world in positive ways.\n\nEntertainment Weekly: Why prolific sci-fi writer Kim Stanley Robinson's latest book is about real-life mountains\n\nI had been wanting to write about the Sierras for decades, and The Ministry for the Future felt like the end of a sequence of novels, so that it was kind of a case of \"now's the time.\" I was really ready for it.\n\nLiterary Hub: Words of Hope, and a Defense of John Muir: Kim Stanley Robinson on His Love of the Sierra Nevadas\n\nI think this book is an anomaly in my career, a one-off. I’d prefer to return to novels and stay behind my characters and my stories, to get out of their way. But also, it’s as you’ve noted; I am a Californian writer, and have written about the state a lot, and of course The High Sierra is a major contribution to that part of my work.\n\nExtinction Rebellion: Q&A with KSR\n\nSo on the one hand, I wanted to warn readers that bad things are going to happen; on the other hand, I wanted to describe humanity reacting to the climate crisis in an uncoordinated way that nevertheless dodges the mass extinction event we have started, and comes to a better moment in future history, where even more progress could be made. So ultimately this was a kind of low-bar utopian novel, which presents a good future happening despite the lack of any strong plan imposed from above, or below or from the sides. Instead it results from lots of people trying lots of different things.\n\nLos Angeles Times: Sci-fi master Kim Stanley Robinson on the Sierra and why humans might just ‘squeak by’\n\nThere are many places on this planet that are intensely beautiful and lovable. You don’t need to burn a lot of carbon to have a good time. The basics of paleolithic contentment remain the same in us and are available at any time.\n\nThe New Institute: Capitalism is the Main Problem\n\nI think my Ministry for the Future says what i have to say about this issue, as a writer and novelist. I’ll let it stand for what I have to say for a few years and see how it goes. It’s making an impact— I don’t want to get in its way by adding bits or sequels or distractions of any kind. As a writer, I’ll pursue a few other projects and see what happens.\n\nFarsight: \"Mars is irrelevant to us now. we should of course concentrate on maintaining the habitability of the Earth\"\n\nMy Mars trilogy is a good novel but not a plan for this moment. If we were to create a sustainable civilisation here on Earth, with all Earth’s creatures prospering, then and only then would Mars become even the slightest bit interesting to us. It would be a kind of reward for our success\n\nPolitico: Climate Catastrophe Is Coming. But It’s Not the End of the Story.\n\nI chose India because it’s the biggest democracy. It’s one of every eight people on Earth or even more. It’s a mess like any other democracy, but it has the potential to be a leader. Once I put the disaster there in Chapter 1, I made a promise to myself, to my mental India, that I would stick with India. It wouldn’t just be the place that the disaster happened and then everybody else solved the problem.\n\nInterview in Neue Zuercher Zeitung (in German): Ist Science-Fiction der Realismus unserer Zeit\n\nDie Leute waren unheimlich hungrig auf diese Geschichte. Eine Geschichte darüber, wie die nächsten dreissig Jahre gut ausgehen könnten: ohne Superhelden, ohne technologisches Wunder. «Ministerium für die Zukunft» füllte eine Nische. Das Buch scheint mir gelungen zu sein.\n\nAlso, a couple of videos:\n\nKSR's Keynote at Future in Review 2022 (with David Brin)\n\nDiscussion \"From science fiction to climate action\" at Hertford College, Oxford\n\nNow for some podcast interviews:\n\nStorytelling Animals: Kim Stanley Robinson on Wildlife, the Martian Constitution, and Loving the High Sierra (podcast)\n\nAzeem Azhar's Exponential View: Imagining Climate Futures with Kim Stanley Robinson\n\nTin House Between the Covers Podcast: Crafting with Ursula : Kim Stanley Robinson on Ambiguous Utopias\n\nEveryday Anarchism: KSR on The High Sierra\n\nThe Ezra Klein Show (The New York Times): A Weird, Wonderful Conversation With Kim Stanley Robinson\n\nPricing Nature: Kim Stanley Robinson, Kate Raworth, and Delton Chen Discuss \"Carbon Currency\"\n\nRick Kleffel's Agony Column podcast on The High Sierra\n\nPlanet A - Talks on climate change: Kim Stanley Robinson – On Climate Fiction and “The Ministry for the Future”\n\nBlue Dot: Kim Stanley Robinson and the High Sierra\n\nPlus, you can find more KSR writings in two recent publications:\n\nTomorrow's Parties: Life in the Anthropocene, edited by Jonathan Strahan, includes an interview with KSR by James Bradley: \"It's Science Over Capitalism: Kim Stanley Robinson and the Imperative of Hope\" (MIT Press, Penguin Random House).\n\nIn Noema magazine issue III: Rupture, Fall 2022.\n\nKim Stanley Robinson contends that, in the vein of eco-realpolitik, the rest of the world needs to compensate petro-states for their lost income as they transition to a green economy — or they never will.\n\nSo, the multi-media multi-mode book of Kim Stanley Robinson The High Sierra is available for nature lovers to enjoy.\n\nYou can listen to KSR reading from the audiobook version - specifically the chapter Moments of Being (6): A Sierra Day: Under the Tarp.
