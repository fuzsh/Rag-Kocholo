        "text": "We’re pleased to premiere a career-spanning interview with one of our finest SF authors: Kim Stanley Robinson, by Jake Brown from About the Authors TV as the opening of their new season of science fiction and fantasy author interviews.\n\nRobinson’s works are insightful, smart, entertaining, and center on ecological and global themes about the Earth and our future on it. Brown has been interviewing authors and musicians in a comprehensive project to bring some of our best and brightest onto the screen. About the Authors will have two seasons of SFF authors! This is a full-length episode, so go get the popcorn.\n\nABOUT KIM STANLEY ROBINSON, from the 2020 Locus interview:\n\nHis first novel, The Wild Shore (1984), began his Three Californias trilogy, collected into one volume by Tor in 2020. The Gold Coast (1988) and Pacific Edge (1990) followed, with the latter winning the John W. Campbell Memorial Award. Other early novels include Icehenge (1984) and The Memory of Whiteness (1985). Fantasy works include mosaic novel Escape from Kathmandu (1989) and surreal fantasy novella A Short Sharp Shock (1990), winner of a Locus Award.\n\nRobinson made his name with the ground-breaking Mars trilogy: Nebula Award winner Red Mars (1992), and Hugo and Locus Award winners Green Mars (1993) and Blue Mars (1996). A collection of related material, The Martians (1999), also won the Locus Award. Near-future ecological thriller Antarctica was the result of a National Science Foundation grant that sent Robinson to Antarctica as writer-in-residence. Locus Award winner The Years of Rice and Salt (2002) is a major alternate history about the development of science.\n\nHis Science in the Capital trilogy explored global climate change and ecological disasters: Forty Signs of Rain (2004), Fifty Degrees Below (2005), and Sixty Days and Counting (2007); a version updated and abridged as single novel was published as Green Earth (2015). Campbell Memorial and Arthur C. Clarke Award finalist Galileo’s Dream (2009) combined historical fiction and far-future SF, while Nebula Award winner 2312 (2012) explored the solar system 300 years hence, and Shaman (2013) is set in the Paleolithic era. Campbell Memorial Award finalist Aurora (2015) is about a generation starship, and Hugo and Campbell Award finalist New York 2140 (2017) explores the city transformed by sea level rise. Red Moon (2018) is about a Chinese lunar colony. The Ministry for the Future (2020), concerns the consequences of climate change.\n\nCheck out the full Locus interview here: https://locusmag.com/2020/12/kim-stan…"
