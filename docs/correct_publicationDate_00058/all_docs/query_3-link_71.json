        "meta_description": "Kim Stanley Robinson is a widely acclaimed science fiction writer. He is the author of 11 books, most recently the 2004 novel 40 Signs of Rain, in which Robinson explores the interface between science, technology and politics in a world severely affected by the symptoms of global warming. The theme of ecological sustainability has a prominent place in Robinson's work, as many of his books focus on the relationship between humans and the natural world, and the ideal balance of nature and technology. Robinson first explored the subject of climate change in 1995, when he traveled to Antarctica through a program with the National Science Foundation. While there, Robinson visited several teams of scientists researching climate change, and the theme first appeared in his 1997 novel Antarctica.\u000b\u000bRobinson has won the Hugo, Nebula, and Locus Awards for his science fiction writing. He received his B.A in literature in 1974 from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), and an M.A in English from Boston University in 1975. He went on to earn a Ph.D in English from UCSD in 1984. Robinson now lives in Davis, California.",
