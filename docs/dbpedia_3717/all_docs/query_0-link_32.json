        "text": "This week's reviews\n\nMore about Rize\n\nRize\n\nPeter Bradshaw\n\nFriday 30 December 2005\n\nThe Guardian\n\nDavid LaChapelle is the ad photographer and music-video director who had a hit at January's Sundance festival with this documentary about the krumping style of dance that evolved in the tough streets of LA in the 1990s. It was a style that grew out of the \"clowning\" techniques pioneered by Tommy Johnson, or Tommy the Clown, a visionary community leader and entertainer who wanted to offer young people something other than gangland violence. He and his performers would dance and clown around on street corners and at children's parties. Despite this gentleness and peace-loving ethos, a new and aggressive dance called krumping emerged with intense, frenetic moves.\n\nWhat is tricky is how we are to interpret the story he tells. The dancing is so aggressive it sometimes looks as if it is influenced by the violent gang and hip-hop culture to which it is supposedly an alternative. There is a dance-off between krumpers and clowners that is nakedly acrimonious, and Tommy's apartment is trashed after the show. Rize leaves us with unanswered questions, but LaChapelle undoubtedly does justice to the dancers' energy."
