        "text": "Movies from a pair of first-time directors open at the Mary Riepma Ross Media Arts Center on Sept. 2.\n\nIn Me and You and Everyone We Know, debut writer/director Miranda July stars as an offbeat performance artist who becomes instantly smitten with a brooding department store shoe salesman, played by John Hawkes.\n\nJuly works to get her latest work accepted at a major museum, dealing directly with a mean-spirited manager who is not interested in the submission. The film also traces the paths of a pair of teenagers who believe they are ready for sex as they tease the neighborhood pervert and consider experimenting with Hawkes' on-screen son.\n\nMe and You and Everyone We Know won the special jury prize for originality at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival and was awarded prizes at international film festivals in Philadelphia and San Francisco.\n\nAlso showing at the Ross is Rize, a movie by photographer and first-time director David LaChapelle.\n\nIn Rize, LaChapelle travels to Los Angeles to make his mark in the cinematic world, shooting a documentary about a style of hip-hop dance called \"krumping.\" LaChapelle divides his time between the personal lives of the dancers and some spectacular on-screen demonstrations courtesy of the krumpers.\n\nLaChapelle slowly unravels the ties that bind Tommy \"The Clown\" Johnson and his cohorts throughout the movie. Broken homes, domestic violence, and other horrors have cast an irrepressibly dark shadow over the dancers lives.\n\nRize (PG-13) and Me and You and Everyone We Know (R) are both showing at the Ross, from Sept. 2-15. Showtimes are available online at www.TheRoss.org or by calling the film information line at 472-5353.\n\nGO TO: ISSUE OF SEPTEMBER 1\n\nARTS HEADLINES FOR SEPTEMBER 1\n\nStudent project joins Husker pride with textile design\n\nAmerican Life in Poetry\n\nFirst-time directors debut at the Ross\n\nPatrick Rowan retrospective opens Sept. 6\n\nSheldon hosts John Robert Weaver exhibit\n\n'Willa Cather' airs nationally on PBS\n\n732190S34859X"
