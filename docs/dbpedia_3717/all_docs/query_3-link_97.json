        "text": "Essay by Andreas Blühm and Anna-Rosja Haveman\n\nGroninger Museum, Netherlands\n\nOn 16 November 2017, a Salvator Mundi attributed to Leonardo da Vinci was auctioned\n\nat Christie’s New York for the exorbitant sum of US$ 450,312,500. Setting aside the\n\nquestion of whether this work can be (partially) attributed to Leonardo, why was it\n\noffered in an auction for modern and contemporary art, rather than in an auction with\n\nother Old Masters? An expert answered that question in an interview with the sarcastic\n\ncomeback: ‘Because 90 percent of it was painted in the last 50 years.’[1]\n\nHaving recovered from the initial shock, perhaps we should also be glad that old art still\n\nsparks such enthusiasm. Old art was once modern, and at a certain point modern art\n\nbecomes old. But even though factors such as style, the circumstances under which the\n\nwork is created, and the market situation are constantly shifting, the criteria that\n\ndetermine the judgment of quality remain surprisingly stable. Many contemporary\n\nartists measure themselves by their predecessors, handling altered historical\n\ncircumstances lightly. Michelangelo, Piero della Francesca, Caspar David Friedrich, Frida\n\nKahlo, and many others are easily claimed as brothers and sisters in art by younger\n\ngenerations. And why not?\n\nThere are few people as aware of the transience of public interest and taste as the\n\nAmerican photographer David LaChapelle: ‘Well, if you knew what they were all saying\n\nabout Warhol in those days. In 1986 I took his last portrait. By that time critics were\n\nwriting terrible things about him and there wasn’t a soul who came to his\n\nexhibitions.’[2]\n\nDavid LaChapelle falls somewhere between the categories of popular\n\nglamour photography and ‘serious’ art produced for museums. He does not conform to\n\nstandard classifications, which makes it slightly difficult for critics. His large flock of fans\n\nmakes him suspect for quite a number of snobs from the scene. And that is a shame,\n\nbecause LaChapelle not only possesses a highly distinctive signature and a breathtaking\n\ntechnique, but he also has something to say. Anyone who categorizes him as a man who\n\nphotographs celebrities is selling him short. He holds up a mirror to celebrities, but also\n\nto us as self-appointed art lovers. And that mirror reveals more than just the attractive\n\nsides of fame and wealth. Or, as was recently articulated by writer Dan Piepenbring in\n\nThe New Yorker: ‘Very popular people doing very unpopular things.’ [3] What on first\n\nencounter seems like an overwhelming staging of his photos distracts from the fact that\n\nstrictly speaking David LaChapelle is a realist. He brings truths to light.\n\nOne of those truths is the aforementioned fickleness of taste, ethics, and morals.\n\nLaChapelle walks with the curious eye of an artist and a gaze sharpened by training and\n\nexperience through museums and places of worship in order to admire works of art\n\nfrom the Baroque and Renaissance eras. To draw inspiration from the astounding\n\ntechnical virtuosity of many of these works is not his only reason to do this; these works\n\nalso tell stories about life’s great dramas and ageless human vicissitudes. For example,\n\nLaChapelle manages to transpose the vanitas theme that was popular in the sixteenth\n\nand seventeenth centuries to our time with profound insight and empathy. Between\n\n2008 and 2011, he liked to quote from floral still-lifes by the Dutch Masters of the\n\nGolden Age, in which a cell phone could take the place of a skull. The deluge is the\n\nsubject of a series in which he depicted flooded museums (2007). And in his Negative\n\nCurrency series (1990 to 2015) he lingered over the transience of paper money. His\n\nteam painstakingly constructed entire factoryscapes using plastic refuse, from which the\n\nfuture – that of abandoned industrial parks – can already be read (the Refinery series,\n\n2013). In 2009 and 2012, LaChapelle collected pieces of discarded wax figures in Dublin\n\nand Hollywood, photographed them and thus gave them a new – albeit dubious – lease\n\nof life.\n\nA highlight in LaChapelle’s endeavor to gain an artistic hold on the changeability of\n\neverything that must be or wants to be modern is his ambitious Seismic Shift from 2012.\n\nAn analysis of this photographic museum landscape can serve to gain a better insight\n\ninto the artist’s mode of thinking and working.\n\nThe building that is on the point of collapse in Seismic Shift is the Broad Contemporary\n\nArt Museum (BCAM), which is part of the Los Angeles County Museum of Modern Art\n\n(LACMA). The steel girders with their bright red color are an unmistakable feature. This\n\nbuilding was designed by Renzo Piano, who, after creating the Centre Pompidou (1977)\n\nin Paris and the Fondation Beyeler (1997) near Basel, became one of the most popular\n\nmuseum architects in the world. Museums have long been the new cathedrals, used by\n\ncountries and cities to compete with one another. With its striking ensemble of buildings\n\ndesigned by Alessandro Mendini, Michele de Lucchi, Philippe Starck, and Coop\n\nHimmelb(l)au, the Groninger Museum (1994) commands a place in the tradition of\n\niconic architecture that has become the norm in the modern-day museumscape. The\n\nnewest in the series is the Louvre Abu Dhabi by Jean Nouvel, which may soon be the\n\nhome of Leonardo’s (?) aforementioned Salvator Mundi.\n\nEli Broad is one of the wealthiest businessmen in the world, and has also gained a\n\nreputation as a fervent art collector and serves on the boards of the Museum of Modern\n\nArt in New York and the LACMA. In the build-up to the BCAM’s construction, for which\n\nBroad donated US$ 60,000,000, many people presumed that this funding was an\n\nindication for the donation of a large portion of his famous collection of contemporary\n\nart to the museum. When the new building opened in 2008, no fewer than 160 of the\n\n200 works were owned by the Broads and a mere 40 came from the collection of the\n\nLACMA. However, shortly before the new building’s inauguration, Broad explained in an\n\ninterview that his collection would remain under the ownership of The Broad Art\n\nFoundation.\n\nGiven the sky-high prices, the Broad collection typified a tricky dilemma for museums\n\nthat collect contemporary art. Museums are on the one hand dependent on private\n\ndonations and want to please lenders to ensure future bequests; on the other, there are\n\nthe perils of conflicts of interest, and the extent to which a museum should allow itself to\n\nbe guided by the wishes of collectors remains open to debate.\n\nIn Seismic Shift it is not just the building, but also many of the works of art represented\n\nwithin it that belong to the collection of the philanthropists Eli and Edythe Broad. In\n\nhindsight, the fact that the Broad couple retained management of the collection could be\n\nseen as a pre-indicator for their decision to establish their own museum: since 5\n\nSeptember 2015, the Broad collection has been on show in the private museum named\n\nThe Broad in Downtown Los Angeles. A portion of the works were location-specific and\n\nhave therefore remained in the LACMA, while several works in Seismic Shift are no\n\nlonger located in the LACMA, but in The Broad. Business details of this nature have\n\nalready prompted the customary critique, but there was even greater criticism of the\n\ncollection itself: ‘Did the Broads shape the market or follow it?’ Holland Cotter wondered\n\nin The New York Times of 28 October 2015: ‘Either way, their collection follows the\n\ncommercial mainstream so closely as to read less like a “personal choice” than an\n\ninvestment portfolio.’ [4].\n\nLet’s start on the left side of the image: The Nurse of Greenmeadow painting by Richard\n\nPrince (b. 1949) is grafted onto the eponymous romance novel by Jane Colby from 1964.\n\nThe typical artistic strategy that brought Prince to fame, namely the appropriation of\n\nexisting, often commercial images, is present in the reference to the stereotype of the\n\nsexualized female nurse, though on closer inspection the obscured nurse on the canvas\n\nis not as seductive as the woman who initially graced the cover of a paperback novel.\n\nThe Naughty Nurse series, to which the painting belongs, also served as the basis for the\n\nSpring/Summer 2008 collection by Louis Vuitton, for which fashion designer Marc\n\nJacobs invited Richard Prince as a creative collaborator.\n\nWhile Prince used an inkjet printer to mechanically transpose the image of the novel to\n\nhis canvas, David LaChapelle physically constructed the museum environment. He not\n\nonly recreated the diverse artworks, but paid attention to many details. Note that in\n\nSeismic Shift the earthquake has transplanted also the surroundings into the gallery. To\n\nthe left in the background, alongside the work by Richard Prince, there is a lone\n\nmammoth that, together with automobiles and architectural elements smeared in tar,\n\nhas broken in. Such mammoths are exhibited at the La Brea Tar Pits adjacent to the\n\nLACMA, a famous and much-visited location with fossil remains.\n\nIn the foreground stands one of the iconic Balloon Dogs by Jeff Koons (b. 1955),\n\nrendered here in red. The blue Balloon Dog is part of The Broad Collection and from\n\n2008 was exhibited at LACMA’s Broad Contemporary Art Museum. (In 2015 the blue\n\nBalloon Dog was transferred to The Broad in downtown Los Angeles.) Over the last two\n\ndecades, Koons has probably become the symbolic figurehead of commercial modern\n\nart. With major exhibitions in leading museums and the millions that are paid out for his\n\nart, the work of Koons, initially a critical commentary on consumer culture, has become\n\nan example of the worldwide demand among super-rich buyers for whom art is a brand.\n\nBehind Koons’s Balloon Dog you can discern a painting by Chinese artist Yue Minjun (b.\n\n1962). He was one of the first artists to be highly successful on the Western market in a\n\ncountry that was busy throwing off the chains of the rigid socialistic doctrine. Yue’s\n\ntrademark is male figures that smirk hysterically. In the background of Seismic Shift, the\n\nlaughing figures seem to add an additional uncomfortable layer to the situation. Are the\n\nmen roaring with laughter from satisfaction or are they laughing because of\n\nembarrassment?\n\nTakashi Murakami (b. 1962), who is sometimes dubbed the Japanese Andy Warhol, is\n\nrenowned for his style in which ‘high art’ is fused with ‘low art’ such as Japanese anime\n\nfilms and manga cartoon culture. Tongari-kun, nicknamed Mr. Pointy, brings together\n\ndiverse real and imaginary cultures. For example, the artist imagined the antenna on the\n\nhead of the sculpture as a communications center with alien beings, and the sculpture’s\n\nnumerous arms allude to various religions, including Buddhism. Murakami does not shy\n\naway from commercial collaborations and the associated mass production, but actually\n\nseeks them out, as shown by his collaboration with the fashion giant Louis Vuitton. A\n\ngallery in the background of Seismic Shift is wallpapered with the so-called Multicolore\n\nLouis Vuitton pattern, which arose from the collaboration between Takashi Murakami\n\nand Marc Jacobs in 2003. Floating in the water are several Louis Vuitton bags, which\n\nwere also created thanks to the collaboration between the fashion brand and the\n\nJapanese artist. In response to an exhibition by Murakami at the Museum of\n\nContemporary Art in Los Angeles in 2007 and the Brooklyn Museum in 2008, where a\n\nhuge selection of expensive Louis Vuitton merchandise was on sale in the museum shop,\n\nthe artist’s intertwining of art and commerce was subjected to a barrage of criticism.\n\nAccording to the artist, the merchandise is in fact an extension of his art and he even\n\ndescribed the shop as ‘the heart of the exhibition.’ [5]\n\nWith his large-scale, detailed, and colorful works of everyday and global scenes, Andreas\n\nGursky (b. 1955) is one of the most famous photographers from around the turn of the\n\ncentury. This photo, visible just behind Murakami, captures endless rows of 99-cent\n\nbargains in an American supermarket. Ironically enough, a similar work by Gursky, 99\n\nCent II Diptychon, a diptych of the depiction of cheap goods, was auctioned by Sotheby’s\n\nLondon in 2007 for the then record amount for photography of GBP 1,700,000.\n\nConsumer society is an important and frequently recurring theme, in the work of Gursky\n\nas well as LaChapelle. While Gursky’s work is an ostensibly objective reflection on the\n\nscale of the global economy, here in Seismic Shift LaChapelle introduces a more dramatic\n\ntwist to the whole. With his inclusion of 99 Cent, is he trying to conjoin the untenability\n\nof the art system and consumer society in general?\n\nBarely discernible, alongside the Gursky hangs one of David LaChapelle’s own works. In\n\nkeeping with the subject of a museum as ruin, we see his After the Deluge: Museum. This\n\nphoto could be understood as the classic pendant of the contemporary Seismic Shift. (In\n\na more recent print of Seismic Shift this photo has, incidentally, been switched with 99\n\nCents, so that the former is in a more prominent place.)\n\nAround the corner, fairly centrally positioned, lies a pile of several classic street lamps\n\nthat belong to the Urban Light installation by Chris Burden (1946–2015). This\n\ninstallation was realized in 2008 in the LACMA’s forecourt on the occasion of the\n\nopening of the new BCAM building and is composed of 202 restored street lamps of the\n\n1920s and 1930s from Los Angeles. The restored lamps have become a favorite spot,\n\nwhere many tourists pause to take a selfie. In Seismic Shift this is no longer possible,\n\nexcept in the case of disaster tourism, as a number of these lamps have ended up in the\n\nexhibition space due to the fictitious earthquake. The installation by Burden is a late\n\nwork by this artist, who in the 1970s rose to fame with performances, of which the most\n\nnotorious was Shoot (1971). While the artist himself was the center of attention when he\n\nhad himself shot in the arm during this mythic and transient performance, with Urban\n\nLight he invites visitors to enter into the work of art themselves. The artist restored the\n\nlamps and turned them into art with the intention of them being preserved for ever.\n\nMost recently in 2018 it has been announced that another Leonardo, Leonardo DiCaprio,\n\nwill pay the museum to swap the work’s 309 incandescent lights with more energy-\n\nefficient LED bulbs.\n\nTo the right of Burden’s soon to be eco-friendly installation stands Untitled (Shafted) by\n\nBarbara Kruger (b. 1945). This installation consists of a huge digital print, specially\n\ndesigned for the location in the elevator shaft, and was first presented when the BCAM\n\nopened in 2008. The red, black, and white texts in Kruger’s signature style are echoes of\n\ncontemporary advertising slogans, with words like SNEAKERS, CELL PHONES,\n\nSWEATERS, and LIPSTICK. Kruger is renowned for her powerful visual motifs, often\n\ncombined with black-and-white photographs, with which she critically pokes fun at\n\nconsumer culture and power structures in society. The slogan in what is perhaps her\n\nmost famous work is: I shop, therefore I am (1987). If you take a careful look at the red\n\nwords in Seismic Shift, there are literary references to be found in this text. The word\n\nPICTURE is part of a quote from George Orwell’s dystopian novel 1984: ‘If you want a\n\npicture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face – forever.’ The quote\n\nabove it has an older source and alludes to the poem When We Two Parted by English\n\nRomanticist Lord Byron (1788–1824): ‘The dew of the morning, / Sunk chill on my brow\n\n/ It felt like the warning, / Of what I feel now. // Thy vows are all broken, / And light is\n\nthy fame, / I hear thy name spoken, / And share in its shame.’ Both these quotes seem to\n\nbe a textual equivalent of the ominous imagery that LaChapelle has created in Seismic\n\nShift.\n\nTo the right of Kruger’s elevator shaft there are two paintings by Jeff Koons hanging on\n\nthe wall. The three basketballs also belong to Koons’s iconic oeuvre, floating as part of\n\nThree Ball 50/50 Tank (Two Spalding Dr J Silver Series, Wilson Supershot), normally\n\nperfectly centered within the black frame, but here in Seismic Shift they have broken\n\nfree. This work is emblematic of Koons’s approach, in which everyday American objects\n\nas symbols of capitalist society are elevated to the realm of high art. Like a modern-day\n\nMarcel Duchamp, Koons is unsurpassed in taking up commonplace motifs and selling the\n\nresulting art to illustrious collectors for astronomical sums. There are, for example,\n\ndifferent versions of the three basketballs in the Broad collection, the collection of the\n\nMuseum of Modern Art in New York, and Tate London. The yellow-green caterpillar\n\nentangled in a ladder, which borrows its motif from inflatable water toys, that is, the\n\n‘inflatables’, is also a work by Koons and likewise part of the Broad couple’s collection.\n\nThis caterpillar treads across the pink painting from the Camouflage series by Andy\n\nWarhol (1928–1987) that is floating in the water. Warhol produced the painting from\n\nthis series in 1986, the year in which LaChapelle captured his last portrait prior to his\n\ndeath in February 1987. Andy Warhol can be regarded as the spiritual father of all\n\nartists whose work is critical of consumerism as well as market-driven. As an artist he\n\ndid not shrink from the cross-connection between art and the economy; Warhol actually\n\nsought out the borderline territory and thought ‘business’ was highly intriguing, going\n\nby one of his famous statements: ‘Being good in business is the most fascinating kind of\n\nart.’ LaChapelle’s choice of a work from the Camouflage series may well have a deeper\n\nmeaning. Warhol lies behind the force of the new commercial art. According to a\n\nrelatively plausible legend, seeing the patterns of military clothing that were meant to\n\nprotect soldiers in natural environments once prompted Picasso to exclaim: ‘We came\n\nup with that!’ An artistic pattern assumed a utilitarian purpose. Warhol won back the\n\npattern for art. With pink camouflage you are bound to stand out in a forest, but in a\n\nmuseum not so much.\n\nDamien Hirst (b. 1965) is the best represented artist in Seismic Shift, in which several of\n\nthe depicted works are part of the Broad couple’s collection. The Englishman caused a\n\nfuror in the art world of the 1990s as one of the Young British Artists who rose to fame\n\nvia the collection of the advertising mogul Charles Saatchi and his ‘Sensation’ exhibition\n\nin London in 1997. Death is a frequently recurring theme in Hirst’s oeuvre, as is evident\n\nin several works in Seismic Shift, such as the medicine cabinets and even more blatantly\n\nin The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living (1991), which is\n\nliterally made from a dead shark that floats in a formaldehyde solution. Unlike the\n\nfloating basketballs by Koons, the shark is a less durable material that ended up aging\n\nquickly despite preservation in a special solution. The shark was replaced in 2006,\n\nbecause the rotting process was unstoppable. Perhaps that is why the shark looks\n\nespecially frightening and decayed in Seismic Shift. Despite its perishability, Hirst’s work\n\nis also sold for the top price on the art market. In 2008 he also organized an infamous\n\nauction, sidestepping his gallery. It is a somewhat incredible coincidence that the\n\nauction was held on the day Lehman Brothers was declared bankrupt, yet Hirst’s work\n\ngenerated sales to the tune of GBP 111,000,000. Likewise, with his most recent\n\nexhibition in Venice in the summer of 2017, Hirst managed to hold his controversial\n\nimage high. This ‘Treasures from the Wreck of the Unbelievable’ exhibition presented\n\nnew work that Damien Hirst and his studio worked on for a decade. Knowing Hirst’s\n\nentanglement with the market, it is no surprise that the two museums where the\n\nexhibition was held, Punta della Dogana and Palazzo Grassi, are the property of\n\nbillionaire François-Henri Pinault, who is also a collector and a shareholder in Christie’s\n\nauction house. So he probably earned a few cents from the sale of the Salvator Mundi as\n\nwell. As one of France’s richest collectors, Pinault is a notorious rival and the greatest\n\ncompetitor of Bernard Arnault, founder of the luxury conglomerate Louis Vuitton Moët\n\nHennessy. While the result of the most recent collaboration between Louis Vuitton\n\n(Arnault) and Jeff Koons was a new series of bags, Hirst is the showpiece of Pinault,\n\nwhich glaringly demonstrates the closeness of the ties between these major artists and\n\ntheir investors.\n\n​\n\nLaChapelle’s perspective on the art scene is that of a man who is simultaneously insider\n\nand outsider. With Seismic Shift LaChapelle has created a work that could be a symbol\n\nfor the state of art at the start of the twenty-first century. Typical of the period around\n\n2000 was the coexistence of faith in progress and skepticism, as in the fin de siècle\n\nperiod. Around the turn of the twentieth century people thought that the possibilities of\n\nmodern technology were more or less exhausted, and in a certain sense that outlook is\n\nalso evident in our computer era. Information technology can never process data more\n\nquickly than the human brain is able to conceive it, and space travel is for the time being\n\nheld back by the physical limitations of what humans can engineer.\n\nJust like around 1900, it was the ultra-rich benefactors who made their mark on the art\n\nworld and decked out their villas with work by great names. Public collections hobbled\n\nalong behind the taste of the bourgeoisie, and were of course also drawn by the well-\n\nfilled wallets of the lead actors among the upper class. That is still the case. Eli and\n\nEdythe Broad as representatives of the financiers and Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst on\n\nthe side of the artistic creators are the dubious heroes chosen by LaChapelle in that\n\nnarrative.\n\nYet fame is ephemeral. LaChapelle transports us into a partly dilapidated ruin of a\n\nmodern museum gallery. The costly building and its even costlier contents have been\n\nseverely damaged by a devastating earthquake, which is a real possibility in Los Angeles.\n\nSome works of art might still be saved, while others are a ‘total loss.’ The vast majority of\n\nLaChapelle’s photos are populated by a great many people, but here – fortunately – the\n\nhuman figures are lacking. We can but hope that all the museum’s visitors and staff were\n\nable to reach safety.\n\nEd Ruscha (b. 1937) had previously depicted a ravaged LACMA in The Los Angeles\n\nCounty Museum on Fire. He painted the museum shortly after the opening on Wilshire\n\nBoulevard in 1965, with its new, modernistic, but unpopular accommodation designed\n\nby William Pereira. This painting is seen as an example of work by artists who were\n\nincreasingly distancing themselves from museums, and thus this painting adorns the\n\ncover of the book Institutional Critique and After (2006), though the artist had not\n\ncreated the work with that intention.\n\nWith Seismic Shift and its modern museum in ruins, LaChapelle harks back – consciously\n\nor unconsciously – to a much older art-historical source: In the 1790s, French\n\nornamental and landscape painter Hubert Robert (1733–1808) produced a series of\n\nviews of the royal palace that had just been converted into the Louvre museum. He\n\npainted several variants of his subject: as a magnificent new building but also as a\n\ndecayed ruin. There has been plenty of speculation about the reason for Robert choosing\n\nthis disturbing vista into an uncertain future. It seems plausible that this ties in with the\n\nrevolution, which cost tens of thousands of people their lives and unleashed an\n\niconoclastic outbreak of unprecedented scope. The revolutionaries rejected the cultural\n\nlegacy of the detested political regime, but also appropriated cultural heritage. The\n\nrevolution thus became the mother of all our present-day museums.\n\nHubert Robert was himself a member of a committee that was responsible for the layout,\n\nthe selection, and the hanging of the works in the Louvre. The overhead lighting of the\n\nGrande Galerie is reputed to have been his idea. At that time the Louvre was largely\n\nunused, because the kings of France, starting with Louis XIV, preferred to reside in\n\nVersailles. The annual or biennial exhibition of the Salon, named after the Salon Carré of\n\nwhat was still the Palais du Louvre, was staged here. Long before the revolution there\n\nwas already open discussion about whether it would be a good idea to exhibit sections of\n\nthe royal art collections permanently. Young artists would then be able to study the art\n\nof painting in the galleries, with works by masters of the Renaissance as their examples.\n\nUnder pressure from an articulate public many monarchs, not just those in France,\n\nundertook steps to make their art accessible to a broader circle. During the French\n\nRevolution, the initially hesitant undertaking of increasing art’s accessibility continued\n\napace. Most especially, royal art treasures were for the first time transferred into public\n\nownership.\n\nMore than two centuries later, the private collection of Eli and Edythe Broad has\n\nlikewise been made accessible to the general public, albeit without ownership being\n\ntransferred from private to public. But that could still happen. Hubert Robert and David\n\nLaChapelle may not be comparable as artists, but what connects them is that they have\n\nat some point rendered their visions of an important art collection in decay in a large\n\nformat. Everything that was once fine and valuable – or was in any case regarded as such\n\n– has tumbled, been exposed to the elements. With Robert we see a budding artist\n\ncontemplating and sketching studies in the middle the rubble. The Classical works –\n\namong them a bronze cast of the Apollo Belvedere and Michelangelo’s Dying Slave –\n\ncontinue to be founts of inspiration today, points of reference for contemporary artists.\n\nWe cannot know whether that will ever apply to Koons, Hirst, and Louis Vuitton’s bags.\n\nLaChapelle does not open up a vista to a more distant future either. The ravages of time\n\nhave gnawed at Robert’s Louvre and whole eras have now passed. But the Seismic Shift\n\ncould happen at any time. Perhaps even tomorrow.\n\nShould we want to search for art-historical sources, then perhaps we should not be\n\nlooking to the Louvre visions by Hubert Robert but to Thomas Couture’s Les Romains de\n\nla décadence of 1847. With its many characters, living people and statues, the\n\narchitectural backdrop, and the social critique that Couture’s contemporaries\n\nimmediately recognized, this gigantic work resembles a LaChapelle avant la lettre. We\n\nare still children of the Enlightenment – in the West, at least – and that also applies to\n\nour artists and the re-evaluation of art’s function that was mobilized by that\n\nEnlightenment. What connects artists of then and now is that they search for the sense\n\nand meaning of creation and preservation, for what determines good taste and how art\n\nrelates to fashion, modernity, and eternal validity. Robert personally witnessed and\n\nparticipated in a radical upheaval of all sorts of values and norms, of which we are still\n\nfeeling the effects. Thomas Couture was also present on the eve of a major revolution\n\n(1848). And LaChapelle? To see what major upheaval he is foretelling we will have to\n\nbide our time.\n\nNotes\n\n1.
