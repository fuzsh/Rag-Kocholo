        "text": "Manifesto\n\nEvery day, we rise. We are the mad ones. The lovers of freedom.\n\nThe lovers of inclusion.\n\nThe lovers of creativity.\n\nThe lovers of love.\n\nWe rally against hate. And bigotry. And fear. We climb. We leap. We blow through walls.\n\nAnd we do all of this by dancing. By singing. By creating.\n\nWe do it by loving and fucking OUR way to a better tomorrow.\n\nIt makes us bold. And colorful.\n\nAnd wonderfully complicated. With a grin on our yellow, brown, off-white faces, We ignore reason and limitation and judgment. We follow only our wandering, mischievous hearts.\n\nWe wear Diesel as our uniform, And have no doubt.\n\nWe are here to help change the world.\n\nCampaign\n\nTitled ‘Make Love Not Walls,’ Diesel’s Spring / Summer 2017 campaign centers on a band of shiny, happy people – gay, straight, transgender, multiracial – breaking a heart-shaped hole through a barbed wire-topped concrete wall using an inflatable rainbow-colored tank as pink smoke billows in the background.\n\nThe hole fills with colorful flowers and serves as the backdrop for a gay wedding at which one of the grooms wears a keffiyeh-like headdress fashioned from denim. The diverse attendees celebrate the beauty of the love before them, challenging traditional notions of family and archaic ideas of limitation and judgment.\n\nThis emotional, narrative experience channels the art of war in a strikingly playful and modern context. Democratic and participatory, the ‘war’ promotes inclusion, creativity, freedom, and love as Diesel’s instigators of positive change – the ‘Love Brigade’ – rally against hate."
