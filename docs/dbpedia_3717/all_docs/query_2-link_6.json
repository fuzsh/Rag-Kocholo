        "text": "The world-renowned American photographer and filmmaker David LaChapelle is the first name among the Lifetime Achievement Award Winners of the \"XIV Florence Biennale. International Exhibition of Contemporary Art and Design\" that will take place at the Fortezza da Basso in Florence from 14 to 22 October 2023.\n\nThe artist will be awarded the 'Lorenzo il Magnifico' Lifetime Achievement Award with the following motivation: “The prize would be our tribute to one of the most talented and influential photographers of our times, and a recognition of your unique style and your outstanding artistic production, based on imagination, experimentation, and creativity, which conveys profound social messages. Through your visionary, original, and courageous perspective, you inspired many other artists and the global audience.”\n\nOn the occasion of the XIV Florence Biennale, themed I Am You - Individual and Collective Identities in Contemporary Art and Design, as Guest of Honour LaChapelle will exhibit a series of works created between 2009 and 2023, including the work Gated Community previewed at the solo exhibition ‘David LaChapelle for Giacomo Ceruti. Nomad in a Beautiful Land' currently on display at the Pinacoteca Tosio Martinengo in Brescia. Moreover, during his award ceremony at the XIV Florence Biennale, scheduled for 17 October and open to the public, the artist will give a speech that already has great expectations."
