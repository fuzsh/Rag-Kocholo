        "text": "David LaChapelle - Can U Help Us?\n\nDavid LaChapelle's Can U Help Us? is a chromogenic print made in a limited edition of 10 and 5 artist's proofs in 2005.\n\nThe artwork shows two women and two children while playing. The poses of the characters contrast with the surrounding setting, which is characterised by destruction and rubble.\n\nThe artwork is part of LaChapelle's series entitled The House at the End of the World, created in 2005, in which the catastrophic setting prevails.\n\nLaChapelle's shots depict the modern world in his own way, very Pop and with little intellectualism. The works are the result of craftsmanship in which the compositions are elaborate and the colours are saturated. LaChapelle's photography is not pure reportage, but true scenic art where each shot stems from a project and a need to narrate modern society.\n\nCan U Help Us? measures 41x61 cm and is a hand-signed artwork with the original frame made by LaChapelle's studio.\n\nDavid LaChapelle, Can U Help Us?: Prices and Value\n\nIf you are interested in the work by David LaChapelle, Can U Help Us? and you wish to know the price click on \"SHOW PRICE\" to shortly receive it by email.\n\nDo not hesitate to contact us for more information about the artist and his works on sale.\n\nJoin the wonders of art thanks to the wide selection of works available on our website.\n\nDavid LaChapelle - Biography of the Artist\n\nBorn in Connecticut in 1963, David LaChapelle is one of the world's most important and most influential contemporary photographers. His career in photography began in the 1980s, when the king of Pop Art, Andy Warhol, noticed the talented young photographer and hired him for a series of covers for Interview magazine, the U.S. periodical founded by Warhol himself.\n\nIt was during the 1990s that the photographer's fame exploded and he began to collaborate with prominent magazines such as Vogue, The Face, DETAILS, Vanity Fair and New York Times Magazine.\n\nThe artist's long career is not only marked by the numerous collaborations with the most important fashion magazines: he also made music videos for the most important Pop-Contemporary artists.\n\nThe young artist's talent was evident from the beginning; in fact, in 1997 he won the Art Directors Award for the first collection of his photographs as best book and best graphic design. To date he is among the top ten most famous photographers in the world to the extent that he has international exhibitions in galleries and museums such as the National Portrait Gallery in London, Monnaie de Paris, Victoria and Albert Museum, Musee D'Orsay and the National Portrait Gallery in the United States.\n\nDavid LaChapelle - Photography and Art\n\nOver the years in the works by David LaChapelle, photography and art become one.\n\nHe experimented with different types of photographic genres, coming up with original photoshoots that stand as true works of art.\n\nThe turning point in the photographer's style came in 2006, when he visited the Sistine Chapel for the first time. As the artist repeatedly declared, Michelangelo through the masterpiece created in the Vatican managed to give a turning point in the artistic career of the photographer, who decided to leave the world of advertising to devote himself completely and entirely to art.\n\nDavid LaChapelle - Artworks and Style\n\nThe style of David LaChapelle's artworks is extremely recognizable. Surreal shots, characterized by bright, fluorescent colors that accentuate dreamlike photographic compositions bordering on the bizarre.\n\nDescribed as the “Fellini of photography”, LaChapelle's style can be traced back to the baroque because of the abundance of elements in his shots. His photographs are characterized by a distinct irony and a clear vision of contemporary society.\n\nHis shots are strongly constructed to depict the modern world in his own way, that is, very Pop and with minimal intellectualism; they are the result of craftsmanship in which compositions are elaborate and colors are saturated. LaChapelle's photography is not pure reportage but true scenic art where each shot stems from a project and a need in telling the story of modern society.\n\nIn 1991 the New York Times wrote, \"LaChapelle will surely influence the work of a generation ... in the same way that Mr. Avedon pioneered what is familiar today.\"\n\nHis influence over the years has been so important and discussed that the master of fashion photography, Richard Avedon declared that among the many photographers who had taken surreal shots over the years, LaChapelle was the only one who had the potential to be the Magritte of his genre.\n\nAmong his major influences, in addition to Michelangelo, are artists such as Salvador Dali, Jeff Koons and Cindy Sherman and the painters Caravaggio and Andrea Pozzo.\n\nToday, LaChapelle's artistic production emphasizes environmental issues. The artist has created a series of photos that emphasize the relationship between man-made constructions and nature and how they disturb the surrounding landscape.\n\n\"I love to create through the use of imagination, turning my dreams into images\" - David LaChapelle\n\nDenouncing the American Dream\n\nIn many shoots LaChapelle criticizes the American Dream, the myth that wealth is the only measure of success and happiness, and people can reach it through commitment and hard work.\n\nA famous LaChapelle shot reflecting this topic is Death by Hamburger, where a girl is covered by a giant inflatable hamburger, an icon of American hyper-consumerism.\n\nPortraying celebrities\n\nDavid LaChapelle is also known as a celebrity portraitist.\n\nNumerous stars from the most diverse backgrounds have been captured with LaChapelle's highly personal and unmistakable style.\n\nAmong the celebrities photographed there are Courtney Love, Pamela Anderson, Amanda Lepore Angelina Jolie, Madonna, Lana Del Rey, Elizabeth Taylor, Valeria Marini, River Phoenix, Drew Barrymore, Leonardo DiCaprio, Uma Thurman, Lindsay Lohan, Sarah Jessica Parker, Eminem, Lady Gaga, Nicki Minaj, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Rihanna, Travis Scott, Hillary Clinton, David Beckham, and Whitney Houston.\n\nMyths of Christianity\n\nAfter David LaChapelle visited the Sistine Chapel, he series of shots with a biblical nature in which the myths of Christianity, religious icons, and biblical scenes are reinterpreted in a modern key and become a warning and a reinterpretation of modern society based on consumerism.\n\nOne example is The Holy Family with St. Francis in which the Holy Family is portrayed in a Pop, kitsch way.\n\nDavid LaChapelle: not just photography\n\nAn eclectic artist driven by the impulse to experiment, LaChapelle has managed to embrace art in all its forms.\n\nStarting with a career as a fashion photographer, he has also managed to build a reputation and career in film and theater as well as being a much sought-after producer of music videos.\n\nThere are also several collaborations with major international brands for the creation of advertising campaigns such as: Tommy Hilfiger, Schweppes, Nokia, Lavazza, Armani Jeans, Motorola, L'Oréal, Coca-Cola, Diesel, Smirnoff, H&M and Burger King.\n\nDavid LaChapelle: Works for Sale with Prices and Value at Deodato Arte\n\nFor those interested in David LaChapelle prints and works for sale Deodato Arte offers a selection of the artist's works for sale online.\n\nIf interested in finding out about David LaChapelle, prices, value or which works will be on display at Deodato Arte Contemporary Art Gallery, please do not hesitate to contact us by sending an e-mail to [email protected].\n\nWe are happy that you decided to buy an artwork.
