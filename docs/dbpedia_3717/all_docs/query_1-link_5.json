Live Q+A’s with filmmakers and choreographers will reframe dance from multiple viewpoints, and bring vibrant choreography from around the world to wherever you may be. Dance on Screen Film Festival is a special collaboration with Images Cinema. All films are free and open to the public. Tickets go on sale on October 9th. Rize brings to the screen in vivid imagery the creators of krumping, a revolutionary form of hip-hop dance from South Central Los Angeles. Created in response to the 1992 Rodney King riots, krumping is a vigorously athletic and visually stunning dance style in hyperspeed. Helmed by fine art and fashion photographer David LaChapelle, the film functions as a moving collage, respecting the powerful images of dancers to speak for themselves while showcasing and attributing the often-appropriated ingenuity of Black teenagers in prophetic anticipation of internet culture. 86 min. Here is the Rize trailer. There will be a post-screening Q+A with director David LaChapelle on October 22 at 8:30 PM.",
