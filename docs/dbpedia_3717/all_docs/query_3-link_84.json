The Milano is a radical new Alfa and introduces a whole new design language, although the famous Scudetto grille remains as does the twin-cowl instrument binnacle. The car is receiving a lot of hate online. I must admit it doesn‚Äôt look very Alfa to me, but I‚Äôll reserve judgement until I see it in the metal. Like it or loathe it, I think it‚Äôll sell well and if it does a Cayenne and allows Alfa Romeo to create a new GTV, 8C etc. then I‚Äôll love it. Just as I now love the Cayenne because it means we stIll have a 911. It begs the question of whether one should update what is perceived as classic. Would a Milano that looks like a small Tonale sell? Would it bring in the new customers that Alfa needs, customers who would have never previously considered buying an Alfa? Personally, I think this could be a good call by Alfa. It may just secure its future. As for the haters, they should look through Alfa‚Äôs back catalogue and then they‚Äôll realise that Alfas have changed radically over the years from rounded to angular, from large proud scudettos to tiny almost token scudettos. The same goes for company branding. Progress and development is essential otherwise a brand will, in the eyes of its customers, look like it‚Äôs stagnating and so, slowly, becoming irrelevant. And we all need to stay relevant. Wouldn‚Äôt you agree? #branding #visualidentity #cardesign #automotive #alfaromeo #alfaromeomilano #progress\n\nA Timeless Collaboration: BUGATTI and Corum Watches Craft a Speedometer of Art #Bugatti #Corum #LuxuryCars #Watches #DesignMasterpiece In an era dominated by digital displays, Bugatti and Corum have dared to be different. Their collaboration on the speedometer for the Bugatti Tourbillon is nothing short of breathtaking. It's a bold statement against the fleeting nature of digital readouts, a testament to the enduring allure of timeless design. The Bugatti Tourbillon, a force of automotive excellence, deserved a speedometer that matched its spirit. Enter Corum, the Swiss watchmaker synonymous with intricate craftsmanship and unparalleled precision. Together, they've created a masterpiece that transcends mere functionality. Imagine this: Gazing upon the instrument cluster, not at a sterile digital display, but at twin dials that seem to echo the elegance of a fine Corum watch. The meticulous design, the focus on legibility even at breakneck speeds ‚Äì it's a symphony of form and function, a celebration of heritage in a world obsessed with the new. This isn't just a speedometer; it's a work of art. It's a reminder that the beauty of a machine can lie not just in its power, but in the details, in the story it tells through its design. Bugatti and Corum haven't just created a gauge; they've created a conversation piece, a timeless treasure that elevates the driving experience to an art form. Frank Heyl Mate Rimac Thanks for this !! What do you think of this stunning rejection of the digital norm? Does the Bugatti Tourbillon's speedometer resonate with your appreciation for classic design?\n\nThe Five Secrets to Ferrari‚Äôs Success as a Luxury Brand What makes Ferrari a leader in luxury, and what lessons other companies and executives serving wealthy clients could heed from its rise? Here are five main takeaways: 1. Play hard to get (the antithesis of mainstream brands). 2. Make emotion the driver. 3. The art of pricing. ‚ÄúThe way we define price in our company/Ferrari is very simple,‚Äù the CEO said. ‚ÄúOne month before the car is ready for the unveil, we go on the track ‚Äî me and several people ‚Äî and we drive it for a day or a day and a half. And then with fresh emotion in our body, we define the price. It‚Äôs me, the CMO and the CFO defining the price. We share the emotion.‚Äù 4. The road to VIP status. 5. Happy employees means happier customers. Details in the article.\n\nHere are the five secrets to Ferrari's success as a luxury brand: 1. Iconic Brand Heritage: Ferrari has a rich history and legacy that dates back to its founding in 1939. The brand has always been associated with high performance, luxury, and exclusivity. 2. Innovation and Technology: Ferrari has always been at the forefront of innovation and technology in the automotive industry. They constantly push the boundaries of engineering and design to create cutting-edge, high-performance vehicles. 3. Exclusivity and Limited Production: Ferrari has maintained its exclusivity by limiting the production of its vehicles. This scarcity drives up demand and allows the brand to command high prices. 4. Strong Brand Identity: Ferrari has a strong and recognizable brand identity that resonates with consumers around the world. The iconic Ferrari logo and signature red color are instantly recognizable. 5. Exceptional Customer Experience: Ferrari goes above and beyond to provide its customers with an exceptional experience. From personalized service to exclusive events, Ferrari ensures that its customers feel special and valued. These five factors have contributed to Ferrari's success as a luxury brand and have helped them achieve their status as the most valuable luxury company in the world. #Ferrari #LuxuryBrand #SuccessStory üèéÔ∏èüî• View the HRM SKILLS Training Calendar for value-added training for all employees in organisations Click on hrmskills.sg #hrm #skills\n\nüö© The Eye of the Beholder David Hume said, 'Beauty is no quality in things themselves: It exists merely in the mind which contemplates them, and each mind perceives a different beauty.' Whilst I understand beauty is subjective, credit where credit is due, Italy has produced more than its fair share of delectable cars of all shapes and types. They are especially good at 'La dolce coup√©. For many, the coup√© is the ultimate expression of a car's design purity. What happens when thinking of Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati and Alfa Romeo? The picture of luxury, style and refined appreciation springs to mind. Try it! Italian car designers are known for aesthetic sensibility, not just with the motor car but with art and fashion. The designers are known for their attention to detail, from sublime bodies to minor features. Italian sports cars are associated with luxury, style and prestige; for many, owning Italian macchina is seen as a statement of refined taste and an appreciation of fine artistry. The amalgam of culture, design passion, engineering excellence, and attention to detail is why the Italians add a new dimension to the 'eye of the beholder.'"
