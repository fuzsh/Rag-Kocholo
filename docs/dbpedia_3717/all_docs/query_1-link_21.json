        "text": "David LaChapelle\n\nDavid LaChapelle (born March 11, 1963) is an American commercial photographer, fine-art photographer, music video director, film director, and artist. He is best known for his photography, which often references art history and sometimes conveys social messages. His photographic style has been described as \"hyper-real and slyly subversive\" and as \"kitsch pop surrealism\". Once called the Fellini of photography, LaChapelle has worked for international publications and has had his work exhibited commercial galleries and institutions around the world including Fotografiska Must in Stockholm, Sweden; Ara Modern Art Museum in Seoul, Korea; Casa de Tre Oci in Venice, Italy; Tel Aviv Museum of Art in Tel Aviv, Israel; and Galerie Rudolfinum in Prague, Czech Republic."
