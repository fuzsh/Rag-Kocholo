He’s famous for his surrealistic pop-art aesthetic and narrative style (thats no surprise considering he was an apprentice of Andy Warhol). I attended one of his shows a couple years ago in New York City. It was incredible!\n\nLaChapelle got his start working as a staff photographer for Interview Magazine in the 1980’s. His work has appeared in many notable publications including Vanity Fair, Italian Vogue and French Vogue and he has photographed everyone from Madonna to Tupac Shakur.\n\nHis film debut came in 2005 with RIZE, a visually stunning documentary of crump dancing, which was chosen to open the 2005 Tribeca Film Festival. LaChapelle’s directing reel also includes music video’s for Jennifer Lopez, Britney Spears, No Doubt and Christina Aguilera among others."
