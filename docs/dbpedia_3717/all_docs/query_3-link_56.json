        "text": "What is pop-art?\n\nRefers to an art movement that began in Britain in 1955 and late 1950s in the U.S. It challenged fine arts tradition by including popular culture imagery such as news and advertising. Pop art sometimes isolates and removes a material from its context and combines it with another unrelated material. This concept refers much to the attitudes that resulted in it and not on the art itself. Pop art employs comic books, advertising and other mass culture aspects. It is interpreted to have come as a reaction to abstract expressionism dominant ideas."
