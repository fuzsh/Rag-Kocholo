        "text": "This documentary film, on the streets of South Central Los Angeles, brings to the screen a revolutionary form of hip-hop dance called 'krumping', which has become popular in LA as an alternative to gang violence. Tommy Johnson first created the style as a response to the 1992 Rodney King riots and originally named it Clowning. For the dancers, Krumping becomes a way of life as the dance becomes a vital part of who they are. It's aggressive and visually stunning dancing which features athletic movements of incredible speed melded with moves native to African tribal rituals. We meet kids who use dance as an alternative to gangs and hustling as they form their own troupes and paint their faces like warriors, meeting to outperform rival gangs of dancers or just to polish their routines.\n\nRegion 2 (UK/Europe)"
