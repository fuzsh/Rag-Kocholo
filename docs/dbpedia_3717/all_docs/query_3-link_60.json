He got the MTV Europe music award for Best US act in the year 2012 and the Radio Disney Music awards for Best Music for ‘Bad Things’, this\n\nAt 1st glance this piece does look like a photograph, even a painting, but this series is a work of mixed-media layered one on top of the other in a box. Yet this assemblage of random found objects, with the artists\n\nHer study of photography began when Caitlyn signed up for a photo class elective during her second semester of ninth grade. Initially, this class was not what she had expected, “We [the students] didn’t even get to do any actual photography at first; for three weeks all we did was learn technical things about cameras.” Eventually though, when they did begin to start using\n\nUelsmann’s work was not well received in the photography community. His creations were not considered photography; however, he was well received in the art community. John Szarkowski hosted a solo exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in 1967. Uelsmann was considered “iconoclastic” and “set out to convince critics that photography offered alternatives to the conventional “purist” sensibility…” Uelsmann debated that photos could “evoke elusive states of feeling and thinking triggered by irrational and imaginative juxtaposition” (Kay). Uelsmann has succeeded in finding a following among photographers and artist alike. In the past forty years, Uelsmann’s work has been exhibited in over 100 solo shows throughout the US and overseas. He has permanent instillations in museums worldwide (Taylor). Uelsmann’s photos are now revered for their original technical form as well as their surreal matter (Johnson).\n\nMarcel Duchamp stated that \"It was his achievement to treat the camera as he treated the paintbrush, as a mere instrument at the service of the mind” (Biography.com, 2017). In addition, the photogram might seem expressive and abstract, yet on the contrary, it is the precise medium to document the everyday objects in an unrepeatable and somehow uncontrollable way. The artist cannot predict how the selected objects will be recorded under the light sources that were tampered with. From the first glance, the image completely dissociated from its original subject, allowing one’s memory to fill the gap. Yet below its surface, the image is an accurate documentation that captured a moment of psychical intensity. It revealed a new visual experience, using objects in the simplest way. One can say that the use of this medium disclosed reality more preciously due to its invisibility and mysterious representation (The Museum of Modern Art, 2017).\n\nNeedless is to say that most of his albums went platinum and gold multiple times. Jones has received numerous awards throughout his career, his first award was already mentioned, Grammy for Best New Music Artist in 1996. Latest awards include two British awards, first in 2000 for Best Brit Male and Outstanding Contribution to Music in 2003. He has also received an MTV Award for Best Music Video in 1989 and in that same year he received a star on Hollywood Walk of Fame which is located at 6608 Hollywood Boulevard, Los Angeles.\n\nHis 2013-2014 tour “Cowboy Rides Away,” is his last tour but he's not done making music and earning awards yet. In November 2013, he received the ASCAP Founder's Award (Toczylowski), and won CMA's Entertainer of the Year Award for the second time (Jamik). He also accepted Billboard's highest accolade, the Legend of Live Award and was honored with the Country Radio Broadcasters Career Achievement Award (Billboard).\n\nCube started his own solo career as an artist. Later to collaborate with ex group members Dr. Dre and DJ Ren Ice Cube’s first film “Boyz N The Hood” (1991) following his second film “Trespass” (1992). Later releasing songs such as “It was a good day” (1993) off of his #1 debut album “Predator”. Directing his first movie “Friday” (1995) and followed by one of his other most popular films “Players Club” (1998).

He had already finished directing his third music video, a haunting piece for Moby's song \"Natural Blues\". This video was named Best Video of the Year at the MTV Europe Music Awards and nominated for several other awards in various categories. LaChapelle's work had definitely made a huge presence in the music video industry that year, and from that point on he was called upon to direct\n\nJean-Michel Basquiat emerged from the punk scene in New York as a street-smart graffiti artist. He successfully crossed over his downtown origins to the international art gallery circuit. Basquiat’s work is one of the few examples of how an early 1980’s American graffiti-based could become a fully recognized artist. Despite his work’s unstudied appearance, Basquiat very skillfully and purposefully brought together in his art a host of disparate traditions, practices and styles to create a unique kind of visual collage. His work is an example of how American artists of the 1980’s could reintroduce the human figure in their work after the wide success of minimalism and conceptualism.\n\nHe got a huge number of awards to his name. Highly noteworthy among them are The Grammy Award for the Best Country Album in the year 2008 for his album ‘Troubadour’. He also got the Favorite Country Albums award in All Music Year in Review in 2015 for ‘Cold Beer conversation’."
