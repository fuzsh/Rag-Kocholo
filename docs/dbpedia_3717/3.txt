Acclaimed photographer and music video director David LaChapelle makes his

feature debut with Rize, a documentary looking at the fast’n’furious ghetto

dance called clowning. When LaChapelle states that he’s obsessed with the

little-known dance phenomenon, believe him – he’s now made three films on the

subject, including two shorts (Clowns In The Hood and Krumped) before Rize.
