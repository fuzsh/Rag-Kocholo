        "text": "January 6, 2024\n\nDuring the pandemic, I discovered the TV series, Great Canal Journeys. It became a favourite, an antidote to the chaos of life, form of travel without leaving home. I loved spending time with Timothy West and Prunella Scales; their humour and chemistry a wonderful part of it.\n\nPru and Me is just as charming as the show. It was easy to hear their voices across these pages. It‚Äôs a heartwarming joint memoir that follows each of their lives, including their remarkable love story. It‚Äôs wholesome reading. Perfect for fans of them or romantics at heart.\n\nIt's refreshingly non-chronological, and quintessentially English ‚Äì it even touches on Pru doing Tetley tea adverts. The included pictures (which Pru enjoyed choosing) were great also, and reinforced the full lives they have enjoyed.\n\nFor me, the highlights were the letters Pru and Tim wrote to each other. They were great to read, and while a reflection of the busy (often separate) lives of working actors, they also showcased their love and hilarious sense of humour.\n\n‚ÄúBoys are well, Sam does a macabre adagio dance ending up under the bed, very impressive, and Joseph eats a good deal of eggshells, like an old hen, I suppose it‚Äôs calcium deficiency.‚Äù\n\nIt occasionally grew tiresome reading about each role in their acting careers ‚Äì Tim even jokes about putting the reader to sleep. But such moments are forgiven by the likes of Pru‚Äôs iconic Sybil in Fawlty Towers.\n\n‚ÄúPru‚Äôs characterisation of Sybil Fawlty is based partly on somebody she used to know and it made her feel rather guilty.‚Äù\n\nI loved the behind the scenes feel of those sections, including the final chapters, depicting their time on Great Canal Journeys. It made me smile, just like the show, and felt like I was watching it again.\n\n‚ÄúEverything you see and hear on that show is genuine - apart from the illusion that there are only ever two people on the boat at any one time, of course. There could be as many as eight!‚Äù\n\nTim perhaps leaves one of his most emotive performances for this book. He‚Äôs not afraid to acknowledge his own faults or shortcomings, particularly in regards to his daughter, Juliet. Such honesty is throughout - an essential ingredient to any memoir. The section detailing Pru‚Äôs dementia was both touching and real, and for someone like me, who has a parent (and previously grandparent) with dementia, all quite relatable.\n\nPru and Me is an enjoyable read and great reminder to embrace the present moment, keep moving, and to do the things that make you happiest.\n\n‚ÄúWe have resolved to keep on moving as best we can and enjoy life to the full.‚Äù\n\nAugust 9, 2024\n\nThis a heartwarming book about a happy marriage, family life, acting and, later anyway, dementia. For the most part is uplifting, funny, insightful. Beautifully read by Timothy West, with input from Pru. It feels difficult to review two lives, but I loved learning about them and their relationship. üíï\n\nAn article about the end of Great Canal Journeys:\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-ra...\n\nA recent interview with the couple:\n\nhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/aut...\n\nOctober 6, 2023\n\nA true love story written from the heart. I loved it. Sitting back and losing myself in a real life love story over the years was a delight. Two actors that have come in and out of my life over the years, with a genuine love for each other, their family and friends and their audience made this a very special read. Thank you Tim & Pru.\n\nJanuary 3, 2024\n\nIn this book, Timothy West traces the highs and lows of his sixty-year marriage to fellow actor, Prunella Scales. From recounting the years before they met, caring for his wife following her dementia diagnosis over twenty years ago, to recalling their Great Canal Journeys.\n\nThis is a heartwarming book and I don‚Äôt think I have ever listened to one where the love for another person shines through so dearly. This is one of the best books I have listened to in a long time.\n\nJanuary 11, 2024\n\nTruly heartwarming, and a beacon.of light. It is impossible to overstress the romance, warmth and deep friendship that surface on every page to underpin the marriage of Tim & Pru. The sensitivity with which Tim writes about Pru's dementia and how to keep living a rewarding life together whilst sharing it with a viewing public is a powerful testimony to their indomitable spirit, sense of fun, and refusal to hide away.\n\nJanuary 12, 2024\n\nA really feel-good book, lifts your heart, such a wonderful couple\n\nJanuary 10, 2024\n\nA lovely account of a lovely couple of national treasures (I can almost forgive Tim his frequent misuse of 'I' & 'Me')\n\nJanuary 15, 2024\n\nA really beautiful book chronicling the long and happy marriage of Timothy West and Prunella Scales. The use of their letters to each other through the years really made everything so much more intimate - memory can always play tricks so it was lovely to hear the actual words from the time and really brought across their personalities so well. The book is obviously written mostly by Timothy West as Prunella Scales is sadly now diagnosed with dementia, but it never feels one sided as Prunella's letters are used throughout and his love for her is evident in every word. It's so interesting to hear about their lives, their rise to fame through talent and hard work, their loving (and slightly eccentric) family life and the humour throughout is wonderful. The recent years of Pru's dementia and how difficult it is to be a carer as you age yourself is evident but there is no self pity, just continuing love and it's beautiful to see.\n\nIf you can, I thoroughly recommend listening to the audiobook version too. it's narrated by Timothy West himself, with Pru reading her own letters, and it's every bit as good as that sounds. I've listened to West doing audiobooks before (particularly Trollope) and he's predictably good at it, but hearing their own voices telling the stories lifts this even higher. Timothy West telling funny anecdotes, such as leaving his younger son alone at a US airport, makes you remember the great raconteurs like Peter Ustinov - he can really tell a story - but it's also very intimate to hear him talking of coping in recent years.\n\nI can't recommend this book highly enough. It's everything an autobiography should be and a wonderful tribute to a truly lovely couple.\n\nFebruary 13, 2024\n\nThis book is tribute to a long and enduring marriage, but also to the (almost-lost) art of letter-writing. Because Tim and Pru spent much of their professional lives apart they were in the habit of writing to each other frequently, and also seem to have kept many of the letters, which Tim quotes from. It gives an immediacy to the narrative, especially of events from many years ago, so much more vividly than reminiscence would.\n\nOf course being actors, there are are lots of interesting and funny anecdotes about their lives in theatre and on TV, but the part that shines through is the wonderful bond between Tim and Pru, even given the challenging circumstances that surround Pru's condition.\n\nTim rarely has a bad word to say about anyone, which makes the section on Peter O'Toole's part in the demise of the Prospect Theatre company the more compelling. It was a wonderful company (I remember seeing Derek Jacobi in Hamlet in 1977) and such as shame it came to a rather abrupt end.\n\nI haven't seen the Canal Journeys TV programmes but will now root them out on catch-up TV.\n\nTim and Pru - ad multos annos!\n\nMay 15, 2024\n\nI really enjoyed listening to Tim telling his and Pru's life stories. It was funny, heartwarming and very moving and honest, especially when he talks about Pru's dementia.\n\nI only watched a couple of episodes of Great Canal Journeys, I'm going to watch them all now!\n\nJanuary 3, 2024\n\nPru and me\n\nI would have given more stars but the infuriating misuse of 'I' and 'me' drove me mad. Amazing couple and I wish the more happy years together.\n\nJanuary 28, 2024\n\nWhat a wonderful love story of 2 very nice people. Their journey together through life is enviable.\n\nMarch 23, 2024\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this book. I loved watching Tim and Pru on Great Canal Journeys and I could hear their voices as I read. It was heart warming and touching, a great love story.\n\nMay 9, 2024\n\nThe perfect ‚Äòloo‚Äô book: can pick up and read straight away: no angst, sweet stories and all lovey-dovey. Either have a saccharine overdose or sit back and enjoy!\n\nNovember 20, 2023\n\nBrilliant if you buy only one book this Christmas make sure it's this there brilliant\n\nOctober 27, 2023\n\nThere were times when I was quite bored and was going to give up but I persevered and finished the book on Tim and Pru‚Äôs 60th wedding anniversary! I was absolutely fascinated that they wrote to each other at Least every day when they were apart because of work which was often but even more have kept these letters! Despite my own problems with the book it is worth the five stars showing how a family happily exists even though there is a lot of separation."
