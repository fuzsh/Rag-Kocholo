        "text": "Fawlty Towers' Prunella Scales has retired from her high-flying TV career amid a dementia battle.\n\nThe TV legend - best known for her role as Basil Fawlty's wife Sybil - was diagnosed with Alzheimer's five years ago in 2014.\n\nThe 87-year-old filmed her last episode for the Great Canal Journeys in October last year.\n\nGreat Canal Journeys followed the couple take a canal boat for a trip across Britain and abroad.\n\nA source told The Sun of the move: “It’s not a decision Pru and Tim have taken lightly but they’re delighted it’s Gyles and Sheila.”\n\nThe Mirror has approached Prunella Scales' representatives for further comment.\n\nBoth Prunella and her husband Timothy West will be replaced on the long-running Channel documentary amid her health battle.\n\nCelebrity Gogglebox stars Gyles Brandreth, 71, and Sheila Hancock, 86, have been drafted in to take over from the married couple.\n\nPrunella and Timothy, who were part of the Great Canal Journeys show for more than 30 episodes, wished the Celebrity Gogglebox stars luck with their new role.\n\nThey told the newspaper in a statement: \"Good luck Gyles and Sheila. Enjoy the countryside and the pubs.\"\n\nLast year in August, Timothy shared the pangs of his heartache when he talked about the possibility of selling their home to downsize and look after his wife of 57 years.\n\nHe told The Daily Mail: \"I quite see how, in the state social services are in, it's a solution. But I would hate it [selling the house].\n\n\"I don't want to go to my grave thinking: 'What's happening to our house?' I don't want it going to somebody who's going to say: 'Oh, let's get rid of all this silly Morris wallpaper and we can use that front garden as space for an extra car.\"\n\nTimothy remarked his wife was \"gradually disappearing\" as she can no longer remember the year they got married (1963) or when their sons Joseph and Sam were born.\n\nHe said: \"The sad thing is that you just watch the gradual disappearance of the person that you knew and loved and were very close to.\""
