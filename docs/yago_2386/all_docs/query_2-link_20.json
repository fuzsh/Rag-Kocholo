        "text": "Actor Timothy West’s memoir, described as “a loving account of his 60-year marriage to actress Prunella Scales, one of the most celebrated marriages in the history of British entertainment”, has been acquired by Penguin Michael Joseph.\n\nFenella Bates, publisher, acquired UK rights excluding and excluding the US in all formats for Pru and Me from Tim Bates at PFD. It will be published in hardback, e-book, and as an audiobook, narrated by the couple, on 28th September 2023, to tie in with their Diamond wedding anniversary.\n\nThe synopsis reads: “After first meeting over 60 years ago while filming a costume drama for the BBC, Prunella Scales and Timothy West have enjoyed a partnership like no other; from appearing together in countless productions on stage and the hit 1960s sitcom ‘Marriage Lines’, they have chalked up an almost endless list of professional triumphs.\n\n“They have also brought up their two sons, Samuel and Joseph, and Tim’s daughter by his first marriage, Juliet. In this book, Tim traces their united steps through life professionally and personally, and covers the highs and lows of caring for Pru since her dementia diagnosis 20 years ago. As with all things in life, she and Tim have tackled it together, often with a glass of wine in hand and almost always with a smile.”\n\nWest said: “This is something I have been meaning to do for a very long time, not least because, despite its ups and downs, my union with Pru has been a joyous affair and I think is really quite unique. After all, how many married couples do you know that have spent six splendid decades travelling the world pretending to be other people?\n\n“Pru knows about the book and as well as being 100% in favour of it, she’s promised to help me choose the photographs. Of which we have literally thousands. Lastly, I would like to thank our publishers, Penguin Michael Joseph, for showing so much enthusiasm for the project. We had no idea if anyone would be interested in publishing a book about a couple of old duffers like us and they’ve also made us feel very special.\"\n\nBates commented: “This proposal stopped me in my tracks when it landed in my inbox. I have long admired Tim West and Prunella Scales and spent many happy escapist hours watching ‘Great Canal Journeys’ when I was feeding a newborn during the first lockdown. Reading the material though, I was spellbound by the love story lived by Tim and Pru, and by their clear devotion to each other. The book will be an incredibly moving read featuring letters the couple wrote to each other when they first met, diary entries, photos and the full story of what it means to build a love that lasts a lifetime. We will publish to coincide with the couple’s 60th wedding anniversary and I guarantee there won’t be a dry eye in the house when books hit the shelves this autumn!\"\n\nTimothy West is a British actor and television presenter. His acting career has spanned across various mediums, from theatre stages to radio and television. He is known for his roles in “Brass”, as well as for his appearances in “Coronation Street” and “EastEnders”, and from his travel show “Great Canal Journeys” where he shared the screen with his wife. Actress Prunella Scales received accolades for her performances in “Fawlty Towers” and “A Question of Attribution”."
