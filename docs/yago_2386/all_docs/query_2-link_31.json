        "text": "Me too. A true love story. I had leaky eyes when Prue said thank you for a lovely life and Timothy West said no, thank you. I wish they wouldn't keep saying it may be their last journey.\n\nI have only seen the first episode of this series so far, but I thought Prue seemed quite well, more so than some other episodes.\n\nI felt it was all a bit much for her in the hustle and bustle of Vietnam; it can be very overwhelming, but she seemed to cope quite well.\n\nSometimes she seems just like herself and suddenly sometimes she doesn’t.\n\nI loved that about a lovely life. That’s just what I would wish for all my loved ones. A lovely life.\n\nyes Stayachild, that was one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen, also the bit before when they got their outfits from the tailor and she came out in her new frock. The way he looked at her - magic\n\nI often well up watching them. I loved the one where Prue revisited her childhood home; she was absolutely lit up with delight.\n\nA very special couple and I hope they have more years together yet."
