        "text": "Timothy West has opened up about his wife Prunella Scales's sad battle with dementia, saying it's hard to deal with the \"gradual disappearance\" of the person he loves.\n\nIn an emotional interview on Piers Morgan's Life Stories, the famed actor admitted that he knew something was wrong before she was diagnosed 15 years ago, but he \"didn't realise what it was\".\n\nWest first met Scales - his wife of 52 years - when they starred together in theatre and on TV. They have two sons, Samuel and Joe.\n\nRevealing the heartache of living with Scales's dementia, West told Morgan: \"Well, the sad thing is that you just watch the gradual disappearance of the person that you knew and loved and were very close to.\n\n\"There's a lot of her left, and we still enjoy life and there are a lot of things that Pru is able to enjoy and we're able to do together. If you live from day to day it's manageable.\n\n\"It's when you start thinking of the past and thinking, 'Oh what a shame she can't do that any more, she doesn't appreciate that any more and we can't talk about this any more', then it's sad.\"\n\nReflecting back on when he first realised that the illness was creeping in, he explained: \"It was a very long time ago. It's stunned everybody that it's developed so slowly, mercifully.\n\n\"It was a play that Pru was in and I thought, 'Hmm, it's not that Pru has forgotten her lines or she's not saying the lines properly, it's just that I can see her thinking'.\n\n\"She never delayed her responses but it was just the difference between what she already had been â€“ entirely inside the character, and her thinking, 'Am I going to manage this?'\n\n\"I knew there was something wrong, but for quite a long time didn't realise what it was.\"\n\nWhen Morgan praised the couple for being so open about the condition, West said that keeping it in would have been \"dishonest\" given their high-profile careers.\n\nAsked about the most difficult part of Scales's dementia, West replied: \"Communication, really. When we've been to a concert, or a play, or a film, there's nothing very much we can say about it afterwards because Pru will have a fairly hazy memory.\n\n\"She'd have enjoyed her evening and she'll perhaps talk about the acting, but she's not able to cope with talking about what the play was saying.\"\n\nWest said that this is \"frustrating\" for both of them, but that \"we need each other very much, and we're conscious of that\"."
