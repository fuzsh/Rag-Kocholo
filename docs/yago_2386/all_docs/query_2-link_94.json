        "text": "http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-76947742.html\n\nmy favorite gossip from the past, cos if Charles Dance dated Sophia Myles…\n\nTV smoothie Charles Dance and stunning actress Emilia Fox have struck up an extraordinary friendship.\n\nThe couple were spotted enjoying an affectionate walk in a park’s shaded woodland during which they kissed, cuddled and strolled arm in arm.\n\nIt’s an unusual alliance. He’s 54 and married to wife Joanna for more than 30 years with two grown-up children.\n\nAt 27 Emilia, who split from comic Vic Reeves 19 months ago after a brief engagement, is just half his age.\n\nBut aides insisted last night their display of togetherness in London’s Primrose Hill Park was merely par for the course for two people whose relationship is “entirely professional”.\n\nEmilia, daughter of acclaimed actors Edward Fox and Joanna David, was plucked from her English Literature studies at Oxford University to star with Dance in the TV version of the thriller Rebecca.\n\nThe drama called for them to act out raunchy sex scenes which Dance admitted were embarrassing, as he knew Emilia’s parents.\n\nBut the close friendship they struck up four years ago has endured through other working relationships.\n\nCharles - who Princess Diana always cited as “my favourite actor” - enjoyed a guest appearance on Fox’s TV series Randall and Hopkirk Deceased, also starring Vic Reeves.\n\nThey spent months together on stage in the West End production of Good, in which Dance played a professor who seduces a nubile student portrayed by Emilia.\n\nAnd only last week millions saw Emilia appear as one of the guests in a repeat screening of Dance’s This Is Your Life on BBC1 , recorded in February.\n\nThey were clearly delighted to see each other as Dance’s wife looked on.\n\nYesterday Emilia’s agent Jeanette Chalmers confirmed the actors are close friends but denied there was anything significant about them kissing in the park.\n\nShe insisted: “They are not having an affair. This is not unusual for two people who are good professional friends.\n\n\"I can assure their relationship goes no further than that.\n\n\"Actors do tend to be demonstrative people. But I must stress Emilia categorically denies she is romantically involved with Mr Dance.\"\n\nLawyer Craig Dixon, of Peter, Fraser and Dunlop, said: \"We’ve spoken with our client Emilia Fox and she categorically denies she is having an affair with Charles Dance.\n\n\"She is a good friend of Mr Dance’s. But she is very upset at the suggestion they are anything more than friends.”\n\nAt 6ft 4in, Dance has carved a lofty reputation for portraying upper crust characters while his looks earned him the nickname of the English Robert Redford. But his own background is solidly working class.\n\nHe left grammar school with two O-levels and discovered a talent for acting when he was studying typography and photography at Leicester College of Art and Design.\n\nHe joined the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1975 and shot to fame seven years later when he landed the role of Guy Perron in the classic drama series The Jewel In The Crown. His epic film career has included starring roles in hits such as Plenty, Last Action Hero and White Mischief.\n\nEmilia’s former boyfriends include Susannah York’s son Orlando Wells and Sam West - son of actor parents Timothy West and Prunella Scales. She fell for Vic Reeves two years ago when they starred in the revival of Randall and Hopkirk. Almost immediately they were making plans to wed.\n\nBut within three months Emilia called the whole thing off citing Vic’s constant partying.\n\nShe split from her subsequent other half - T-shirt designer Toby Mott - last year.\n\nLast night Dance’s agent Paul Lyon-Marris refused to discuss his client’s friendship with Emilia.\n\nHe said: “No comment. I have no comment to make.”\n\nPublication : The Mirror (London, England)\n\nDate : Aug 3, 2001"
