        "text": "Faith Clayton OAM.\n\nOne of Western Australia’s most loved and respected actors, Faith Clayton, died in Perth on November 24, 2020, surrounded by her family.\n\nIn 1948, while studying Psychology at The University of Western Australia, Faith played the role of Jocasta in Oedipus Rex. At the time, Sir Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh were touring with the Old Vic and attended a performance in the Sunken Garden. Backstage, they congratulated Faith on her performance and suggested she go to work in London, but finishing her Psychology degree was foremost in her mind. As well, she had met a young Englishman, Alan Richardson, who had recently arrived at the university and was also studying Psychology.\n\nFaith graduated in 1949, with a double major in Psychology and Philosophy. In 1953, she performed in the first Festival of Perth, in Richard III, and is believed to have been the last cast member from that production.\n\nFollowing their marriage in August 1953, Faith and Alan travelled to London. She worked as a clinical psychologist and supply teacher, while Alan completed his PhD at the University of London. While in the UK, they indulged their mutual love of theatre and kept the program from every show they saw.\n\nWhen they arrived back in Perth in 1957, Faith’s love of acting won out and she was cast in The Rainmaker, with Ron Graham, at the new Perth Playhouse. She became part of Western Australia’s ‘golden age’ of theatre and, for the next 50 years, was a leading actor not only on stage, but also in film, television and radio.\n\nFaith and Alan had two daughters, June and Cathy, and were well known for the after-show parties and croquet gatherings at their home in Perth. They also welcomed and entertained many fellow cast members from interstate and overseas, including Richard Todd (Equus), Donald Pleasence (Heartbreak House), and Prunella Scales and Timothy West (Uncle Vanya).\n\nSadly, Alan passed away suddenly in 2002.\n\nFaith’s long and varied career brought her many awards, including the Heritage Award from the Actor’s Benevolent Guild of WA, Life Membership of Actors Equity, awards for stage and television performances, a Western Australian Living Treasure Award in 2015 and the Medal of the Order of Australia in 2016 for service to the performing arts.\n\nAt her funeral on December 4, Faith’s age was not revealed, to honour her firm belief that an actor must never tell anyone how old they are. The chapel at Karrakatta Cemetery was filled with theatre people, along with friends and family. They rose as one and farewelled her with a resounding standing ovation, accompanied by many cheers and shouts of ‘Brava!’. There was a feeling that, with Faith’s passing, we were perhaps witnessing the end of an era."
