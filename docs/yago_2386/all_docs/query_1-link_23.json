        "text": "Timothy West eases himself into a dining chair in the library of his home in Wandsworth, southwest London. He has a fidgety air about him. He’s barely seated before he gets frustrated with a cushion and flings the “blimming thing” to the ground. Then he’s up again, inquiring after his coffee, telling the photographer to “wander where you like, help yourself to anything you like to eat, darling”.\n\nWith his arched eyebrows and lips that disappear when he smiles, he is instantly recognisable from soaps such as EastEnders and Coronation Street, Shakespearean plays, historical dramas and Channel 4’s Great Canal Journeys, which he presented with his wife, Prunella Scales. Over dozens of episodes the couple took narrow boats through Britain and far-flung spots"
