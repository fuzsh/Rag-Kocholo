        "text": "Fawlty Towers star Prunella Scales is suffering from dementia - but is determined not to let it stop her performing, her actor husband Timothy West has revealed.\n\nMs Scales - best known as Basil Fawlty’s long-suffering wife Sybil in the sitcom - has a ‘sort of mild Alzheimer’s’, according to EastEnders star West.\n\nStage and screen actor West, 79, talks movingly about his 81-year-old wife’s struggle with dementia in a new TV documentary, Grand Canal Journeys.\n\nThe couple have been navigating Britain’s canals on a boat ever since they first developed a passion for the hobby when they borrowed a friend’s boat for a fortnight in the 1970s.\n\nWest, who recently joined the Albert Square cast as Stan Carter, the dad of Danny Dyer’s character Mick, says canal journeys are perfect for his wife because of the difficulties with her memory.\n\nHe says: “She can’t remember things very well but you don’t have to remember things on the canal.\n\n“You can just enjoy things as they happen - so it’s perfect for her.”\n\nThis week's Radio Times previews the More 4 documentary which follows the couple as they enjoy four canal journeys across Britain.\n\nMs Scales, mum of Howards End star Sam West, says she is determined no to let the condition keep her from the stage.\n\nShe said: “I always say I want to die on the eighth curtain call.\n\n“Eight will mean the show’s been rather a success. I just hope I’m somewhere near the middle and have been reasonably good in the part.”\n\nThe pair celebrated their golden wedding last October with a trip down the River Thames on paddle steamer The Waverley.\n\nMs Scales , who was nominated for a BAFTA in 1991 for her portrayal of the Queen in Alan Bennett’s A Question of Attribution, added: “It’s always Tim who steers.\n\n“But I enjoy running up and down because of the wonderful wildlife on the towpath.\n\n“And it keeps you fit.”\n\nDr Alison Cook, Alzheimer’s Society’s director of External Affairs, said: “Alzheimer’s Society would like to thank Timothy West for speaking out about his wife Prunella Scales’ dementia and raising awareness of the condition.\n\n“Their recent adventure navigating Britain’s canals shows that it is possible to live well with dementia and plan to carry on enjoying life.\n\n“We would urge anyone who is concerned about themselves or a loved one to speak to their GP today or contact Alzheimer’s Society for advice and support.”\n\nResearch shows that one in three people aged over 65 will develop dementia and that 800,000 people in the UK are suffering from a form of the disease, of which more than half have Alzheimer’s.\n\nIt is estimated that in less than 10 years a million people will be living with dementia, which will soar to 1.7m by 2051.\n\nGreat Canal Journeys will be shown on More 4 on Monday March 10 at 9pm."
