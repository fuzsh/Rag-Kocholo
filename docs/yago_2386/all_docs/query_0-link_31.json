        "text": "My mother and father were lovely parents, always quite hard up, but very hard-working. I was born in 1932 and my brother in 1934. My father worked for a cotton firm, and was a commuter and they had a little rented cottage. They borrowed some money from my rather well-off aunt to buy a house and then sold it just before the war, and never owned a house again.\n\nDad was the generation that fought in both world wars, and people married rather later when they had been in the trenches. My mum was an actress and he saw her in a show in London and they married. She stopped acting when she had babies, which is a shame. I grew up in a household that was very friendly towards the theatre and acting.\n\nI am famous for playing unfortunate wives, but I have been a very lucky wife – it will be 50 years of marriage next year. Tim [West] and I met in a period TV drama, She Died Young. We have both been incredibly lucky – we have been busy, we have had lovely kids. I first met my future father-in-law in a black-and-white production of Pride and Prejudice, long before I knew Tim. He was the actor Lockwood West and was giving a very extravagant performance. I said to myself: \"This is what is known as an old queen, they're very powerful in the theatre and I must be very respectful to him\" – I ended up married to his son!\n\nTim was brilliant when I was in labour – he did all the effleurage and everything. He had gone over the road as it was a very long labour and I rang home and he wasn't there, so in between spasms I said \"try Richard Briers\", as he, poor darling, had a house opposite Queen Charlotte's hospital, and there they both were knocking back the whisky and saying: \"Isn't it terrible what women go through.\" I said: \"Get over here.\" So Tim did, and Sam, our elder son, popped out, and Tim said, \"very good, no retakes\", and I laughed so much that I had to have stitches. I was busy doing a series called Marriage Lines at the time with Richard.\n\nSam had two parents, three grandparents, and two great-grandparents in the business, so we desperately didn't want him to be an actor. He was very bright and went to Oxford where he spent all his time acting. He is a very good actor. Both Tim and I think he has a better face than us for theatre and film. We were understandably fearful, but also positive about his becoming an actor. However talented your children are, you feel you ought to warn them about the business as it is dodgy. It is an absolute thrill to see Sam acting. It's a huge buzz – like when I see Tim doing something wonderful. It's more of a buzz than when you feel you've done something well yourself. But that's true of all parents seeing their children doing well, isn't it?\n\nOur younger son, Joe, always wanted to be a teacher, thank God, and we backed him like mad with that. He got a first in French at Manchester University, married the French lectrice from the music college, had three children, and went to live in France. I'm very proud and happy that they are teachers as we need good teachers. They have three children who speak very good English but it's a little bit posh, actor's English – I think they'll have to modify it if they work over here. I love being a grandmother."
