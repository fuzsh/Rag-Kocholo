        "text": "I’m not keen on exercise - I don’t mind swimming, so I go about 4/5 times a week. As I recently had 2 cataract ops, the consultant said I should give swimming a miss for a while. So I very reluctantly starting going to the gym. Tonight I was on a static bike, watching TV, as all the equipment has TVs attaches. “Great canal journeys” was on, with Prunella Scales and Timothy West, from years ago. They interact so wonderfully with each other, I found myself crying. What a lovely relationship!\n\nI did intend the heading to seem like that, Auntieflo ! In fact my bod did ache quite a bit last night! Not too bad this morning, after some Voltarol!\n\nI just thought Timothy West was so loving with Prunella - and I loved seeing how she came to life and remembered whole chunks of lines when they talked about plays and the theatre.\n\nMy boss used to chauffeur Prunella during a theatre run and prior had been told by her PA not to address her directly, not to do this, not to do that. However, on first day she chatted to him as an equal and then apologised if she then remained silent while reading her lines. Before the last performance Timothy told him to bring her home that night along with an overnight case as he was invited to the last night party! He said they were both a joy and Timothy was very protective of Prunella.\n\nAs for the gym I will never enter one again this side of the grave! Gentle pilates on dvd and walking/gardening is enough for me lol.\n\nI also often think Tim is patronising with Prue and not just since she's been diagnosed with dementia but that just seems to be their way if interacting with each other.\n\nMy ex and I once stayed in Cambridge for a weekend and at breakfast in the hotel we chose a table, put bag and fruit juice there and went to the buffet for the full English. On arriving back at our table there was a lady sitting there. I said to her that we'd already taken that table and our juice and my bag were already on it. She got up without a word and moved to another and it was then, on seeing her joined by her husband that we realised that I'd just asked Prunella Scales to move! I think we may have chosen their usual table but it wasn't reserved.\n\nLater, in the foyer we saw the poster advertising their appearance at the local theatre."
