        "text": "PRUNELLA Scales was in the studio audience as husband Timothy West spoke to Piers Morgan about her heart-rending battle with Alzheimer’s.\n\nBut minutes later, the 83-year-old Fawlty Towers star could not remember being there at all.\n\nPiers spoke of his sympathy for the famous couple yesterday after interviewing Timothy for the new series of\n\nPiers Morgan’s Life Stories, which starts on ITV next month.\n\nHe said: “Prunella was in the audience with advanced Alzheimer’s.\n\n“Timothy wanted her there and yet he wanted to talk about her illness in front of her. He said, ‘Don’t worry about it. She won’t remember.’”\n\n“Afterwards, I asked her, ‘Did you enjoy the show?’ And she had no memory of it.\n\n“It’s heartbreaking. Timothy got very emotional about it.\n\n“And this is the saddest thing. They have been married 52 years and she has no recall of most of the marriage, so they can’t share moments.\n\n“He is her main carer and I think he has been utterly selfless and fantastic.\n\n“But you could see total sadness etched on his face that they can’t share all the stuff they have shared because she can only remember parts of it.\n\n“I felt very, very sorry for him. It was one of the hardest things he had to do – knowing she was in the audience with the camera panning to her occasionally as we were talking about her.\n\n“It was a powerful illustration of how awful a disease Alzheimer’s is.”\n\nTimothy and Prunella met through their shared love of acting and married in 1963, going on to star together in a string of stage productions.\n\nPrunella is best known as Sybil Fawlty but had a long and distinguished career in theatre, film and TV. She was made a CBE in in 1992 – Timothy received the same honour in 1984.\n\nShe and Timothy have two children, actors Samuel and Joseph.\n\nAround 90,000 people in Scotland have Alzheimer’s or other forms of dementia, according to the charity Alzheimer Scotland.\n\nThe number of patients is expected to double in the next 25 years as the population ages.\n\nFor help or more information, call the Alzheimer Scotland 24-hour dementia helpline on 0808 808 3000."
