In an interview in the Guardian, award-winning writer Rose Tremain expressed her admiration for the writing of William Golding. Tremain was asked to name the book that made her want to become a writer. Although she didn’t have a specific book in mind, she said that she ‘came especially to admire what William Golding was doing: pushing beyond his own experiences to explore ancient worlds and altered states of consciousness’. In her most recent novel, Islands of Mercy, she includes Golding’s Booker Prize-winning novel Rites of Passage in a list of acknowledgements.
