        "text": "I bought Lily by Rose Tremain in Sainsbury’s at the same time as I bought The Lamplighters. I was short on books and I liked the look of it. It reminded me of one of Jacqueline Wilson’s historical novels. And I do love Jacqueline Wilson’s historical novels!\n\nRose Tremain has written a lot of books, but this is the first one I have read.\n\nAs it turns out, it was very much like a Jacqueline Wilson novel. Just like Hetty Feather, Lily grew up in the Foundling Hospital and was sent to a foster family in the countryside until she was six. But this is definitely not a children’s book! I’ve read a lot of books about children being abused and neglected, but I found parts of Lily to be very disturbing.\n\nSet in the 1850s and 1860s, the book pretty much alternates between her current life and her childhood – from happy times living on a farm, to really tough times at the Foundling Hospital.\n\nLily was found abandoned as a newborn by a young police constable, Sam Trench, who walked through the night to take her to safety.\n\nRight from the start of the book we know that Lily, aged 17, has murdered someone, but we don’t know who. There are certainly a lot of people in her life who would have deserved it! She is now working making theatrical wigs for a wig maker, who is an unusually kind boss for Victorian times.\n\nSam Trench believes the one good thing he has ever done was saving Lily and he is determined to track her down. Lily thinks he could be the key to her happiness, but she is certain he will know that she has committed a murder.\n\nCan Lily ever escape her past and find true happiness or will she pay the ultimate price for her crime?\n\nLily is a moving and atmospheric story. She is a caring, likeable and believable character, and I don’t think any reader would condemn her for her crime. But do be prepared for the disturbing bits! If you don’t like reading about cruelty to children, this is definitely best avoided."
