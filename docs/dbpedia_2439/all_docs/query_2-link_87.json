I hope you’re all having a good day today.\n\nI thought it would be fun today to do the Valentine’s Day Book Tag that I found on Words About Words Blog.\n\nWhat book have you been given as a gift that you loved? I was given the special edition slipcase for ACOTAR for christmas the year before last, it is so beautiful that I don’t want to read that edition though, I will just read my paperback edition.\n\nWhat book would you like to give as a gift to someone else? It depends, I’ve given my Mum Elise Kova books as gifts before because I know she loves her books but for others even though I know they like reading I wouldn’t know where to start with gifting them a book.\n\nIf you could gift a random person an non-bookish item what would it be? I would say maybe an experience, something that wouldn’t end up on a shelf gathering dust.\n\nIf you could gift a random person a bookish item what would you give them? I would say probably a bookmark because everyone needs one of those.\n\nWhat do you say when a person gives you a gift you don’t like? I have to be polite and say thank you but also watch my face, because I know I am quite expressive and give it away so I have to be careful.\n\nMention a book based around valentine’s day? I don’t know any specifically for Valentine’s but Plus One by Kelsey Rodkey is excellent\n\nMention a film you love to watch on Valentine’s Day? Again not on the actual day but my favourite romcom is either Dirty Dancing or Pretty Woman.\n\nmention a few of your favourite OTPs. Where to start? Scarlet and Julian from Caraval, Elisabeth and Nathaniel from Sorcery of Thorns, Wrath and Emilia from Kingdom of the Wicked and Thomas Cresswell and Audrey Rose Wadsworth from Stalking Jack The Ripper\n\nWhich fictional character would you love to see at your door with a bouquet of roses? Kellen from Spellslinger by Sebastien de Castell (and Reichis of course!)\n\nHow would you answer these questions? let me know in the comments.\n\nMy Top 5 Books of 2023\n\nHappy Monday bookish people! I hope you’re all having a wonderful day today.\n\nI am here to share with you my top five books of the year, I have to say it was a difficult choice. I read a lot of books this year that I enjoyed, and a lot of them were books that were surprising.\n\nFinale by Stephanie Garber\n\nVera Wong’s unsolicited advice for murderers\n\nA Very Lively Murder by Katy Watson\n\nLondon Seance Society by Sarah Penner\n\nThe Very Secret Society of Irregular Witches\n\nWhat were your favourite books you read this year?\n\nFireworks Book Tag\n\nHappy Friday bookish people! I hope you’re all having a good day today.\n\nToday I am bringing you the Fireworks Book Tag that I found on The Strawberry Post blog.\n\nScreamers – a book that made you want to scream: Mrs Death Misses Death\n\nBombers – a book you read before it exploded in the book community\n\nBanger – a banned book you have read\n\nPeony – a book/author you think everyone needs to read\n\nCrosette – a book/series with a complicated plot\n\nDiadem – a book/series with a set of amazing central characters\n\nAstrological Book Tag\n\nHappy Friday bookish people! I found this Astrological Book Tag from Peace Love Veggies, I hope you all enjoy it!\n\nAries: Name a book that is full of fire, desire and passion\n\nThis is my star sign and there is one book I think of instantly..\n\nTaurus: Name a book you have read that was beautifully written\n\nGemini: Name a book you have read featuring twins\n\nWhat a difficult question! I don’t think I have read any books that have twins in them, if you know of one then let me know down below!\n\nCancer: Name a book you read that was a real tear jerker\n\nI am not really the person that cries at books but Gwen and Art are not in love did actually make me cry, I am not even sure why because it was not an overly emotional book\n\nLeo: Name a book you’ve read with courageous characters\n\nVirgo: Name a book you’ve read which was pure perfection\n\nLibra: Name a book you’ve read that was neither good nor bad\n\nScorpio: Name a book you’ve read that was dark and mysterious\n\nSagittarius: Name a book that is full of adventure\n\nCapricorn: Name a book that made you think\n\nI am cheating here a little bit, every book makes me think in a different way.\n\nAquarius: Name a book that is really quirky\n\nPisces: Name a book you’ve read which was very imaginative\n\nNovember TBR!\n\nHappy Friday bookish people! October flew by didn’t it? So much has happened in the past month, and don’t worry I haven’t forgotten about my October Wrap up, that will be coming on Monday instead.\n\nSo, of course the biggest thing that happened is that my sister got married! She has just got back from honeymoon and while she was gone I have ben catsitting for her which has been fun.\n\nAnd in amazing news, I matched with a guide dog! She will be moving in with me next week and then it is ten days of training before she graduates as my official guide dog! Of course I will be updating you all on here about my journey throughout this month.\n\nAnyway, onto my November TBR!\n\nNovember TBR\n\nThe Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern\n\nThe Spanish Love Deception by Elena Armas\n\nFinlay Donovan Knocks Em Dead by Elle Cosimano\n\nThe Girls I’ve Been by Tess Sharpe\n\nEmma by Jane Austen\n\nThe Paris Apartment by Lucy Foley\n\nCity of Brass by S A Chakraborty\n\nFinale by Stephanie Garber\n\nCrownbreaker by Sebastien De Castell\n\nAmy and Rogers Epic Detour by Morgan Matson\n\nFrom Blood and Ash by Jennifer L Armentrout\n\nGallant by V E Schwab\n\nThat’s it for my November TBR, have you read any of these? Let me know!\n\nFolklore Book Tag\n\nHappy Friday bookish people! I hope you are all having a good day today. The book tag I am doing today is the Folklore Book Tag which I found on laurensboookshelf.com but was created by lisa @A Whisper of Ink. It looks like it will be a very fun tag so I am looking forward to sharing my choices here.\n\nThe 1: A book with an ending that left you speechless\n\nOoh that’s starting with a difficult one… I think I am going to go with Spellslinger by Sebastien de Castell because the first book in the series ends in a way I wasn’t expecting but obviously I can’t say how it ends here because of spoilers\n\nCardigan: A book that makes you feel happy and sad all at once\n\nI am going to go with The Lost Apothecary by Sarah Penner, there’s two different timelines within this book and both of them constantly made me feel happy and sad when I read it.\n\nThe last Great American Dynasty: A book with a fascinating and well-told story\n\nI have to choose Cecily by Annie Garthwaite for this one, it is one of my favourite books of 2022 so far and it is haunting and just overall brilliant.\n\nExile: A book you wish you hadn’t read\n\nI am afraid this has to be The Raven Boys by Maggie Stiefvater, I just did not enjoy it and I still own the rest of the series.\n\nMy tears ricochet: A book that made you cry uncontrollably\n\nBooks don’t make me cry like that, I might tear up but not cry uncontrollably so I don’t really have an answer for this one.\n\nMirrorball: A book that feels like it was written just for you\n\nThis is definitely The Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern, I love the magic of this book and it feels like it was the perfect book for me.\n\nSeven: A childhood book that makes you feel nostalgic\n\nThe Faraway Tree series by Enid Blyton, I always loved this series as a child and I still love to reread them now.\n\nAugust: A book that reminds you of summer\n\nI honestly can’t think of a book that makes me think of summer, I am sure that as soon as I post this book tag three of them will come to my mind but right now I have no answer.\n\nThis is me trying: A book that deals with loneliness and sadness\n\nthe first book that comes to mind is Holding Up The Universe and I read that when I was in secondary school a while ago and I can’t remember it all that well.\n\nIllicit Affairs: A book that gave you a book hangover\n\nmost recently Hot Dog Girl by Jennifer Dugan, I’m not sure why other than I didn’t love the book but I didn’t read for nearly two weeks after that book.\n\nInvisible String: A book that came into your life at the exact right time\n\nCaraval by Stephanie Garber definitely, I read it at a time when I was searching for a really great book about magic, fates and sisters.\n\nMad Woman: A book with a female character you adore\n\nI know I have just used it but I have to go with Scarlett from Caraval, she is a headstrong yet caring female character.\n\nEpiphany: A book that was haunting\n\nOoh another one I don’t have an immediate answer for… I think I have to choose City of ghosts by Victoria Schwab\n\nBetty: A book couple that fills you with yearning\n\nAudrey Rose Wadsworth and Thomas Cresswell from the Stalking Jack the Ripper series by Kerri Maniscalco\n\nPeace: A book character you’d die for because you love them so much\n\nI think I would have to say Elisabeth from Sorcery of Thorns by Margaret Rogerson\n\nHoax: A book that you thought you were going to love but didn’t\n\nA Line to Kill by Anthony Horowitz. I loved Moonflower Murders by the same author but this one just didn’t have the same enjoyment unfortunately.\n\nThat’s it for the Folklore Book Tag, I hope you all enjoyed it!\n\nThe Summer Bucket List Book Tag\n\nHappy Friday bookish people! I thought it would be fun to do a summer book tag today, even though it’s technically not summer yet I don’t think, but it’s close! I found this book tag on parchmentpages.co.uk\n\nHit The Beach: A Book Set By The Sea\n\nWatch Fireworks: A Book That Had A Fiery Romance\n\nGo For A Road Trip: A Book That Involves A Journey\n\nCamp Under The Stars: A Book That Had You Starstruck\n\nI’m not sure on this one, I literally can’t think of any book that made me feel starstruck\n\nMarathon Some Movies: A Book You Couldn’t Put Down\n\nGo Out For Ice Cream: A Book With A Sweet Romance\n\nPicnic In The Park: A Book That Was A Breath Of Fresh Air\n\nGo For A Hike: A Character Who Conquered An Obstacle\n\nGrill Some BBQ: A Book Featuring Delicious Food\n\nWatch The Sunrise: A Book That Inspired You\n\nThat’s it for this book tag, if you see this then consider yourselves tagged!\n\nSpring has sprung book tag!\n\nHappy Friday bookish people! I am excited to be bringing you another book tag today, the spring has sprung book tag!\n\nFlowers – Look on your bookshelf, what is the most beautiful book inside and out: A River Enchanted by Rebecca Ross the Illumicrate edition\n\nThis cover is just stunning, I haven’t read it yet but I’m sure that the story is just as beautiful\n\nGrass – what is a book that you find others like way more than you did: The Raven Boys by Maggie Stiefvater\n\nI have a review post up of this book but I did not like this book very much yet I hear so many people talking about how good this series is\n\nRain – what is a great book that lifts your spirits when you’re down: Caraval by Stephanie Garber\n\nDew – what’s a book that made you feel alive: Truly Devious by Maureen Johnson\n\nthis mystery book had my heart beating very fast and that’s why I chose it as my answer for a book that made me feel alive\n\nStorms – what’s a book that you found unpredictable: Moonflower Murders by Anthony Horowitz\n\nRainbow – what was a book you struggled with but you were glad you finished it: Since You’ve Been Gone by Morgan Matson\n\nChilly weather – a book you couldn’t finish or didn’t enjoy: Lily by Rose Tremain\n\nWarm weather – a book you loved and you wanted more of: any books by Kerri Maniscalco!\n\nThe stalking Jack the Ripper books series and the Kingdom of the Wicked series, I love all of them!\n\nGreen – a book you haven’t read yet but really want to: Our Lady of Mysterious Ailments\n\nPink – a book in which you felt a strong connection to the characters: Sorcery of Thorns by Margaret Rogerson\n\nPurple – what’s a book that when you read it made you feel safe: I don’t have an answer for this one unfortunately.\n\nOrange – what book do you feel is intelligently written: any Agatha Christie book\n\nYellow – what book puts a smile on your face: the Pages and Co series by Anna James\n\nThat’s the end of this book tag, I hope you all enjoyed it! How would you have answered these questions?\n\nEaster Time Book Tag!\n\nHappy Friday bookish people! Today I am bringing you an Easter themed book tag that I found on My Reading Escape.wordpress.com\n\nI hope you will all have a wonderful Easter weekend with however you will be spending it, I will probably be spending mine eating a lot of chocolate and using my new coffee maker.\n\n1. Easter Egg: Book that feels like a hidden gem\n\nI have to choose The Lady in the Tower by Marie Louise Jenson for this one because it is a wonderful book that I don’t think I’ve ever seen anyone else talk about\n\n2. Bloom: Debut Novel You Loved:\n\nI chose The Court of Miracles by Kester Grant for this book because I received it in an Illumicrate box and I read it in one sitting. It is a retelling of Les Miserables set in a beautifully described France.\n\n3. Chocolate Bunny: Book so good you didn’t want it to end\n\nI chose Caraval because it is one of my favourite books and as the prompt says, I didn’t want it put it down! This series is so magical I wanted to keep reading it for as long as I could.\n\n4. Cheap, Cheap, Cheap: Book you bought for super cheap:\n\nI actually was given this book for free by a really lovely bookseller, I was given a few of the little world book day books and this was one of them, I have already read it.\n\n5. Jelly bean: Book you thought was sweet:\n\nThis book has a lot of lovely, sweet themes so Rooftoppers by Katherine Rundell was the first book I thought of for this prompt.\n\n6. Easter Basket: Filled with many surprises:\n\nFor this one I am choosing the entire A Court of Thorns and Roses series by Sarah J Maas because although I have only read the first book, I have heard that there are many surprises throughout this series and I am excited to read them.\n\n7. Rabbits: Books you wish would multiply (have a sequel):\n\nI chose House of Salt and Sorrows by Erin A Craig because ever since finishing it I really wished there had been a sequel, I just felt there were questions left unanswered.\n\n8. Hunt: Book that was hard to get hold of:\n\nI had to look everywhere for this book, there was only one bookshop that had it and the drive was over an hour, then when we got there I forgot to look for this book (I know, I couldn’t believe I did this either) and so I had to order it.\n\nSo that’s the end of this Easter book tag! I hope you all enjoyed it!"
