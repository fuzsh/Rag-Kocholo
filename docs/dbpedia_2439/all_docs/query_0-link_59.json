        "text": "There are all the elements of a post-war idyll: handsome parents, a privileged London home and a paradisal Hampshire retreat in 2,000 acres with a dairy, a kitchen garden and staff busy making roasts and puddings, a place where a child could feel “drugged with happiness”. Pity about the adults, though; neither Rosie’s bereaved grandparents nor her unloving mother (herself an unloved child) had any time for her. Affection was delegated to the nanny, whom, unsurprisingly, Tremain remembers with adoration.\n\nThe break-up of her parents’ marriage was bad enough, but worse was the “Great Casting Out”, when Tremain’s mother remarried and decided that the best place for her two daughters was boarding school. Mother (chillily called “Jane” throughout) is not to be forgiven for this, nor for other high-handedness. The book starts with her dictating what her daughter can or can’t have remembered. Rose retaliates by imagining her mother’s selfish self-justifications: “Jo and Rosie have got quite enough already, thank you very much!”\n\nTremain tells us explicitly how real-life stimuli fed through to her fiction — there are footnotes. She also tells us that she punished her mother by putting her into a novel with an unhappy ending: “I took her husband away from her and left her with an unknown future.”\n\nRosie’s young life is often like a novel. Her father joined a cult, her piano teacher (the concert pianist Joyce Hatto) turned out to be involved in a notorious musical hoax. The evocation of 1950s schoolgirldom (“our minuscule, girlie lives”), with all its emotions, elations and smells, is wonderfully vivid — distinctive, like being donated a set of dreams. Rosie herself seems fated to be misguided, not least by the bizarre request from a beloved English teacher to spend weeks up a scaffolding in an exam term painting a mural of Il Penseroso on the classroom ceiling. Another thoughtless uprooting removed this budding Michelangelo from school — just at the point where she had fixed on a scholarly future — to send her to be “finished” with a view to becoming a posh secretary: “We’d work for men who’d been educated to be whatever they were capable of being, and we would serve their needs.”\n\nThe narrative leaves us with Rose emboldened by Paris in the early 1960s and on the brink of breaking free. A quiet drama, but as you’d expect it’s the writing that makes this book such a delight: “Round come the thermometers dunked in TCP, Tuesdays dawn and serve up the wonderful bacon pudding, our charity garments begin to take shape, tea is bread and jam again, a cold wind sighs over the hockey field…”"
