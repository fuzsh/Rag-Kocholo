        "text": "Literary theory, in general, examines the relations between writers, texts and the world. In most literary theory, &quot;the world&quot; is synonymous with society-the social sphere. The two most influential schools of thought that brought about great remarkable changes in people’s perspectives and life in the twentieth century—Marxism and psychoanalysis have the common assumption that what we call ‘nature’ exists primarily as a sign within the cultural discourse. Apart from it, nature has no being and meaning, they claim (Coupe 2). This vision of nature as a cultural construct permeates various schools of thoughts like formalists, new historicist, and deconstruction - all of which repudiate the existence of nature outside the cultural discourse, and take is just as a sign. However, nature affects us in several different ways, and always remains influential in human life; it cannot, therefore, be dismissed merely as a linguistic construct, and from ecological point of view it will b...\n\nThe motif of Nature and the resultant presence of environmentalist problems in children and young adult literature has a long standing. Homologising pristine Nature with the innocence of childhood works along simple connotative connections and is almost intuitive: there exists „implicit, although not unproblematic or uncontested, sense that both children and nature are “innocents” which “naturally” align (remembering that “Nature” is also “red in tooth and claw”)” (Jaques 2015). However, David Whitley (2012) claims that specifically young adult literature tends to utilize urban settings, and it is largely confirmed in the juvenile dystopian genre. Whereas it is true that most of socially informed fiction for young adults undertakes environmentalist problems, the settings are either artificially constructed luxury spaces or deserted, ruinous cities. Obviously, dystopias would signal the necessity to act via the portrayal of loss and deprivation, however, Nature is always present at least in the background: as a threatening monster (Nature-skeptical narratives) or as pastoral loveliness (Nature-endorsing narratives) (Jaques 2015). Frequently, these two approaches are commingled, resulting in a problematized picture. One of the devices used by the dystopian authors to play up environmentalist themes is personification. Some of these representations can be seen as the embodiments of ecotopias: dreams of unspoilt, healing power, often conjoined with the paradisal moral perfection, continuing the tradition of „natural theology” (Stableford 2010). In the proposed paper I would like to analyze such personifications to disclose their interplay with environmentalist themes present in the novels. The primary texts will be the Matteo Alácran series (Nancy Farmer), the Hunger Games series (Suzanne Collins) and the Legend cycle (Marie Lu). In all of these specific representations of Nature appear, utilizing ecotopian images. Farmer sets her story in an enclave of unspoilt Nature in a polluted world and personifies the healing powers of Nature itself as Mushroom Man. Katniss Everdeen from Collins’s series is often discussed in ecofeminist terms as the representation of vengeful Nature (e.g. Garriot et al. 2014) – however, for the purposes of the paper, it is justified to focus the discussion on her younger sister, Primrose Everdeen. Marie Lu sets the dystopia in a post-disaster U.S. and organizes her narrative around finding and curing Eden, the protagonist’s younger brother, who is ironically being used as a bioweapon. Bringing together man and Nature in one literary representation would seem to signal embracing the precepts of deep ecology – seeking and advocating the balance between human and non-human. As scholars suggest, though, the literature for the young tends to be anthropocentric, and Nature remains inferiorized (Bradford et al. 2008, Jaques 2015) – here personified as children and an old man, who need to be taken care of. However, the picture of the interconnection between nature and culture in the mentioned narratives is far from uniform. Among others, we can observe the splitting and shifting of the meanings of Eden and Paradise in relation to technology and the wild, varying emphasis on the chtonic and the diurnal, and ambivalent relation to Nature itself (commingling of the Nature-skeptical and Nature-endorsing attitudes, especially in Lu’s cycle). Deeper analysis of the chosen examples will show that the emergent picture of ecotopia is not simply that of the return to the pristine natural conditions but more often the posthuman connection of Nature and technology, as well as it will present broader implications of the above-mentioned elements of the narratives.\n\nAt the dawn of 'ecocriticism' as a discipline of study within the Humanities, Glotfelty and Fromm (1996), in the first general reader in the matter, defined it as the critical practice that examines the relationship between literary and cultural studies and the natural world. In general terms, during the past two decades, ecocriticism has denounced the anthropocentric and instrumental appropriation of nature that has for so long legitimized human exploitation of the nonhuman world. Exposing the logic of domination that articulates the very power relationships that both connect and separate human culture and natural life, recent trends in ecocriticism have raised awareness of the 'otherisation' of nature (Huggan and Tiffin, 2015), pointing out the need of assessing insurgent discourses that—converging with counter-discourses of race, gender or class— realize the empowerment of nature from its subaltern position. But such empowerment of nature first requires that the sundering of human and nonhuman realms is overcome since, as Kate Rigby explains, only by regaining \" a sense of the inextricability of nature and culture, physis and techne, earth and artifact—consumption and destruction—would be to move beyond (…) the arrogance of humanism \" (2002, p. 152). Yet, recognizing such inextricable relationship between human and natural while overcoming the arrogance of anthropocentrism entails the ecocritical admission that all cultural discourses are in fact exploitative of nature. Rigby states it clearly while explaining, \" culture constructs the prism through which we know nature \" (p. 154). We comprehend nature when we apprehend the world through language and representation, but nature precedes and exceeds words; it is therefore \" real \" (1992, p. 32) and separated by an abyss from the symbolic networks of culture that write, master, assign a meaning to and attempt to set nature in order. From this perspective, culture is not exactly the end of nature as much as it is an appropriation and colonization of nature. Culture masters, dominates and instrumentalizes the natural world. However, in a time when the \" end of nature \" that Bill McKibben prophesized in 1989 has been certified, when we know for a fact that it is indeed a different Earth we are living in—because by changing the climate there is not a corner of the planet that has not been affected by our actions—the evidence of global ecological endangerment compels the ecocritical debate to install environmental ethics and concerns at the crux of humanistic research. The critical enterprise is far from easy though. The argument that cultural representations of nature establish a relationship of domination and exploitation of human discourse over nonhuman reality is extendible to the critical task. As humanist critics, our regard of nature in literary and artistic representation is instrumental and anthropocentric. But the time has come to"
