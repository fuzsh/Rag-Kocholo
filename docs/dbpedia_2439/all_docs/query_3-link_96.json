        "text": "This is a very unusual story and, having reviewed the same author’s book, The Colour, earlier, we realize that Rose Tremain has a penchant for taking unusual stories and making them her own. That story was set in New Zealand and this story takes place largely in France.\n\nMelodie is 10, and is in a class. She has moved ‘here’ from Paris, which was her home. She likes the teacher Mademoiselle Viala. She is very volatile and runs away to be on her own sometimes.\n\nMeanwhile, Anthony Verey, an aging arts dealer is going through more difficult times. He was once at the top of the game but knows that he is nowadays an object of ridicule and pity ‘whose time has come and gone’.\n\nAurun, a girl is the daughter of Bernadette. Her father has died and she marries an evil man called Serge. Serge ill treats Aurun who bears everything stoically. Serge and Bernadette give birth to a son called Aramon.\n\nWhen Bernadette dies, Aurun is under control of the two evil folks Aramon and Serge. Serge also dies a few years later, and the house inherited by Bernadette is partitioned into a mansion (Aramon has removed the extensions which contained the stables and kept the central portion as an independent house, though he preferred to live in squalor and did not take care of the house. He spent his days drinking away the inheritance.\n\nAurun was given a shack on the outskirts and lived there independently.\n\nHe turns to Victoria, his sister (whom he calls ‘V’). Victoria lives in France with her partner Kit. Vincent decides to fold up his failing business and go live near her.\n\nVincent’s friend, the rich man, comes in the story to no purpose. He is married to an attractive but now aging wife and seems to leak pee whenever he laughs. They both get drunk on the expensive wine of the house. All this seems to be of no purpose at all.\n\nHe stays with V, and finds Kitty irritating. So does she about Anthony.\n\nMeanwhile Aurun finds that her brother Aramon, who owns the plot next to hers, plans to sell his place to the developers, take the money and retire. She hates the idea and tries to sabotage the sale by pointing out that cracks on the buildings have been papered over and not fixed but no one is listening. But Aramon has a problem. Aurun’s ‘cottage’ is an eyesore and when he learns that Aurun has no plans of selling, he is furious. He says that she has built her shack crossing into his legal territory and arranges for a surveyor to come and confirm that, so that he can forcibly order Aurun to demolish her house and move across the border. Aurun is devastated and even dreams of killing Aramon before he can sell, so that she inherits the entire property and keeps it pristine, the surrounding forest and all, instead of having it ‘developed’ into a concrete monstrosity.\n\nKitty sulks when Anthony reveals his plans to stay in France, near them, forever. Her irritation seems to delight him.\n\nMeanwhile, he is terrified to go look at any of the houses even though he told V that he intends to settle down in France, near her. A bit confusing, this one is, but Rose Tremain’s novels are inherently slow moving. They are books to savor, not read fast.\n\nThe loose strands come together finally. We learn that Aurun was sexually abused by both Serge and Aramon until Serge died. Shocking. After Serge died, he told Aramon to desist as ‘he is going to hell but Aramon still has time to stop’.\n\nThe person who is planning to buy the Mas Luas (the main stone house of Aramon) is none other than Anthony Verey. He balks at the monstrosity next to the house (Aurun’s house of course) and Aramon, who is desperate to sell, is furious. His dreams of cashing in and retiring are about to crash down.\n\nMeanwhile, Aramon’s health keeps deteriorating, and he also starts having fugue states, where he blanks out. There is a vague suggestion that Anthony may have come back to Mas Lunas and Aramon cannot remember if that is true or, if so, what happened to him.\n\nWith Victoria running off to search for Anthony in the hills to which he had departed, Kitty, who hates him, realizes that she probably needs to help if she has to keep her relationship with Victoria from being shattered. So she decides to visit Mas Lunas to see what she can learn from there. She finds a sandwich wrapper but Veronica does not give it any credence. Unable to see Victoria pushing her away always, Kit simply leaves and goes wandering over the world to settle down somewhere and Veronica finds that she doesn’t mind that at all. It was Kitty who wished Anthony ill and now he is missing. Kitty does not understand the bond between V and Anthony.\n\nAramon finds a car in his stable hidden under hay, with no memory of how it got there. He is terrified, especially with his frequent fugues and his failing health and pitifully begs Aurun to help him. She does not, and just watches him crumble.\n\nWe witness a shocking turn of events. Aramon finds two used cartridges in his gun with no memory of how he came by them. He discovers a car presumably Anthony’s in his garage, hidden in a pile of hay. He convinces himself that in one of his fugues, he must have killed Anthony, absurd though it is.\n\nLater, when the police come to interview Audrun, she lets slip that Aramon had gone off with the Englishman and she did not see them return. The police arrest Aramon and throw him in jail.\n\nNext in a huge surprise, Melodie runs away from a picnic and when the teacher zzz goes to find her, she finds a leg sticking out of a pool instead, which turns out to be Anthony Verey. He has been shot.\n\nWe realize in another astonishing twist that Anthony Verey came to Mas Lunas to take another look at it, and met Audrun. She, afraid that she will lose her house and Mas Lunas, has committed the murder and framed Aramon, knowing he is dying and also feels guilty anyway.\n\nBut fate has other plans; after Anthony’s funeral – a touching moment that – a fire engulfs and guts Mas Lunel. Audrun is trapped when she went their foolishly trying to retrieve her mother’s cabinet but recovers in the hospital.\n\nThe book kind of ends abruptly. But that is OK. It is representative of life, which is messy sometimes, and does not always end in justice for all.\n\nThe narration is good, and true to her style as revealed in The Colour, Rose Tremain has a gift for making the characters come alive and for the situations to be realistic and credible, keeping the story moving at an interesting pace indeed.\n\nAnother good story from Rose. Deserves a 7/10\n\n== Krishna\n\nThis is a cozy mystery, the same genre as our previously reviewed books A Pint of Murder or Killed At The Whim Of A Hat\n\nThe author like to drop book names as many drop people’s names. She keeps referring to famous books and authors. Since many of them do not anything to advance the plotline, they jar a bit.\n\nMy reaction to this is that the story does not know where it wants to go, and so many sequences are not really relevant to the story. Let us start with the story itself.\n\nLila Wilkins lost a two bit job as a journalist when she was in mid forties. She saw an ad for intern for an intern for a Literary Agency and decided to apply.\n\nShe is called for an interview and meets Flora Meriweather, a children’s story writer before being ushered into the room of the editor in chief, Bentley Burlington-Duke and gets hired. Her mother, a Tarot card reader, implores her to leave the place immediately as ‘Death will visit her place of work and she is worried about Lila’s safety. Lila cannot afford to lose her lifeline and refuses.\n\nShe meets the obnoxious Zack Cohen who thinks all new employees are there to fetch him coffee. She also meets the agent Franklin Staffort who deals with nonfiction.\n\nShe also meets Marlette, who looks and behaves like a hobo. She wonders who let him into the building. He is gracious in an awkward way but is smelly and weird. Bentley had earlier referred to him as a ‘resident lunatic’ thus indicating that she had known him. Lila meets Jude Hudson, a gorgeous hunk who represents thrillers and suspense novels. Makayla, the gorgeous black girl works in the cafeteria. Marlette was the crazy incoherent dude who carried a query every day to the office, which was always ignored, unread.\n\nWhen Marlette is found murdered by Lila, the scene for this cozy mystery is set. Now Bentley and Jude were the first to hear, and Carson Knight, a thriller writer, was also in the office then. So was Flora, and also Franklin, who claims to know CPR and tries to revive Marlette. The obnoxious Zach is there too. Marlette’s face is swollen, suggesting an allergic reaction as the reason for his death but Jude thinks that he may have been murdered.\n\nShe also meets the gorgeous editor of the romance section. When she goes away, she remembers that the dead man had a query in the flowers. She goes looking for it. She finds the flowers but no note in them (‘No Reading’). She goes to a coffee bar where her fired predecessor, Addison Eckhart, works now and asks that lady about Marlette.\n\nIn the meanwhile the story wanders about how her son Trey trashed the car and was irresponsibly uncontrite when asked about it; her growing attraction to the investigating officer Griffiths who is conveniently both the right age and unmarried; what’s more, he seems to be also interested in her.\n\nShe goes hunting to Marlette’s house with the help of her mother and finds a diary there. Copying it first, she dutifully sends it to the police for evidence. To her heartthrob Griffiths, actually.\n\nShe then goes to the playground and tries to see if he has left any note in a playground bird box and is disappointed not to find any. Mikayla, the coffee lady, is her willing companion in all these trips.\n\nMeanwhile, Trey is fascinated by the commune and decides to stay there, much to the surprise of Lila. Also she finds that the house she had put up for sale was vandalized in a crude attempt to make her back off from investigating Marlette’s death.\n\nShe goes investigating stubbornly but the story just wanders: Is Mr xxx, who furtively goes every afternoon (but never aware of all the people watching or even Lila following – is he a bad man? No, by the simple device of peering into the house he visits through an open window, Lila finds out the real (kind of innocent) reason he does so. How absurd, the whole thing! If he had even an iota of sense, he could have easily made it difficult to detect. But no. He is set up as a suspicious man and eliminated by a stupid method of detection by Lila.\n\nThe first not so big surprise is the discovery that Marlette, who may have been framed by Sue Ann, may have been innocent. The next surprise is the realization that Luella, who is the romance author in Lila’s company, was really Sue Ann.\n\nLila goes spying and has reasons to believe that Luella poisoned Marlette with a bee venom pill and produced a dead bee to suggest that he died of bee allergy, which he was known to have. Before that, she foolishly confronts Luella, driving her to savage anger.\n\nWhen Luella does not turn up the next day, Bentley sends her to fetch her as an important client was waiting with increasing impatience and anger. Lila finds Luella murdered. She has also finally found – with Sean, the policeman, who is assigned to the investigation and on whom she has a crush.\n\nLet’s back up a little here. Do you see the problem? The story is a whole bundle of individual yarns, and besides, the supposed heroine Lila does nothing admirable except keep going after all the places Marlette had been to. And an idea, once developed, is dropped totally and the story just takes a turn into the next blind alley. It is irritating. Add the psychic mother of Lila, who is ridiculed by all but seems to possess real abilities to see into the future, Lila’s scooter obsession, and later, the manuscript of Marlette turning up as a promising story from another author called Carson – who now is suspected of both Marlette and Luella’s murders, and you have the feeling of having read a story plot that does not seem to know what to do with itself.\n\nHowever, it works within the parameters of how a cozy mystery should be, and ends as you would expect it to end.\n\nNot an exhilerating read. Let us say 3/10\n\n== Krishna\n\nThis is my first book by Ruth Rendell. I know she is quite an accomplished author and is admired for her skill in storytelling. She has written over fifty well received books. So, if there are any fans out there reading this review, I apologize in advance for the comments about this book that I did not enjoy.\n\nLet us look at the story first.\n\nMarc and Harriet are standing for a group portrait (manual, by an artist – hand painted). The painter is Simon Alpheton. Harriet is red haired.\n\nJimmy Brex and Eileen Tawson go on a picnic to Broadstairs. In a pokey restaurant, Eileen goes to the bathroom and, coming out, finds a diamond ring, apparently left by an earlier user of the bathroom, a woman she had seen leaving the room as she entered. Eileen decides to keep it, hide it in her purse and when she returns and they have left the place, shows it to Jimmy. He, realizing that it would make a free but perfect engagement ring, proposes to her. He has no intention of marrying her and she is not in love with him. So they stay engaged for years, and stay celibate but when Jimmy’s mother dies, he marries her (someone is needed to look after the house) and she moves in with him and finds Keith, an older brother of Jimmy, in the house too.\n\nAt the age of forty, she finds herself pregnant and nonchalantly chain smokes. Being forty and pregnant in those days itself is high risk, and people say that the child, when born, would ‘have something wrong with it’. (They mean Down’s Syndrome) but the child is born outwardly healthy. He is named Teddy and ignored for the most part – except cleaning and feeding him. So he grows up without knowing love, emotional attachment or care.\n\nMeanwhile, a misdemeanor saved Fraincine’s life. She was sent to her room as punishment early in the afternoon. She sees a visitor (brown hair only visible) ringing her doorbell but when she hears arguments and gunshots downstairs, she instinctively hides because she knows that the killer would check the rest of the house to see if anyone else was there.\n\nShe is traumatized and Richard Hill, who came home later blames himself with guilt. It appears that the killer found his name Dr Hill and address from the phone book when he was in search of another (medical) Dr Hill who was involved with shady dealings and had kept a lot of money in his house. Why guilt? Because he had insisted on the Dr title in the phone book out of vanity – he was a doctor of philosophy from Oxford.\n\nIn the meanwhile Julia sees Francine as a psychotherapist but she and Richard grow close together. When Richard wants to marry Julia, Francine is unhappy but knows enough to nod because she knows adults will do whatever they want.\n\nA grandmother called Agnes keeps giving Teddy pocket money of a pound a month and stops it when he goes away to college. They both are emotionless people who do not care about anyone else. This entire story seems to be populated with unfeeling, uncaring, uncared for people galore.\n\nAnd the whole story is a slow burn piece, testing your patience. The book just does not move and you lose patience many times in plowing through small developments even after reading dozens of pages. Nobody will accuse Ruth Rendell, based on this book at least, of a writer who develops her plot in an adequate pace to hold your interest, let alone the scorching pace set by most popular authors.\n\nWhen his dad dies – a matter in which Teddy took no interest – Teddy is told by Keith that he, Teddy, is not the real son of the father and so all property now belongs legally to Keith. He lets Teddy stay in the house until he finishes his studies and then Teddy should move out. This is a big blow to Teddy who was counting on selling the house and moving.\n\nThe story is so slow, rising on a snail’s shell.\n\nAnd then the story moves to a foolish girl Harriet Oxenholme, who was a groupie and went behind Marc Syre, a mediocre singer. After living with him for a while – while he was inviting other groupies for casual sex – she is thrown out with all her possessions with nowhere to go and no money. Her parents of course will not take her back. She was expelled from school and disobeyed them at every turn before choosing a vagabond groupie lifestyle much to their horror.\n\nBack to Teddy. When his father dies, he does not mourn and finds out that Keith, his uncle owns the house that he thought was his by inheritance rights. When Keith tries to kick him out, he waits and kills Keith when he is very drunk. Even that is told agonizingly slowly, in my opinion.\n\nHarriet accidentally gets a thousand pounds from Marc who threw her suitcase down when he threw her out. She spends it all, but then before she is destitute again, meets an old man Franklin Merton and, finding he is rich enough, marries him. He puts her in a mansion and she spends his money happily. She is not in love with him in the first place but after a few years of marriage, she is irritated with him. Meanwhile she has a series of affairs with young things – she is past fifty now – who are generally servicemen. She serially seduces them without a qualm.\n\nFinally, Teddy meets Francisca in a private art gallery viewing where his mirror has won a prize and is completely infatuated. He manages to give her his phone number without Julia knowing about it.\n\nWhen Frencisca senses the huge resentment of Julia about Teddy, she decides to phone him. In the meanwhile, Herriet tries to seduce Teddy (a series of workmen, right) but he is totally oblivious – which is worse than being rude.\n\nHe finally decides to take the car to Herriet’s house and bury Keith’s body but the plan goes horribly wrong when he is surprised by Herriet who had returned home early unexpectedly and he in his panic throws a chair at her and she falls down the cellar steps, dead.\n\nTeddy decides to leave both bodies there and seal up the place for good. He also figures out the pin for Herriet’s card and withdraws money at will. He repeatedly takes Francine to the house but she becomes uncomfortable – he first claims that his client has given him the full use of the house in her absence; then he is unable to perform where it counts; then he objects to her behaving in any way contrary to his mental ideal (- for instance, he does not like her in jeans and T shirts)\n\nMeanwhile Julia goes more and more crazy, realizing that Francesca is slipping away from her grip. Even Richard, Francine’s father, finally seems to have a suspicion that Julia is ‘not all there’.\n\nWhen Julia imprisons Francine in the room, she calls Teddy for help and he murders Julia in her sleep on the way to Francine. He does not tell her of that but takes her away. There Francine comes face to face with Teddy’s dark nature and is appalled.\n\nHe runs out of money soon and does not know what to do. The story drops into the hopelessness of the characters. Meanwhile, Francine’s father Richard gets worried about Francine’s call to him abroad and the lack of response from Julia. He decides to come back and investigate. (Not knowing the fact that Julia is murdered and Francine now lives with Teddy).\n\nFrancine finally goes home to wait for her father, who she knew was coming there the next day but finding Julia dead turned her mute – unable to speak – for the second time in her life.\n\nThe last thirty pages are simply fantastic and told me why Ruth is so admired. The resolution of the various knots that has been woven so carefully is done well, and the final state of Teddy, Francine, and even Richard’s resolution are absolutely brilliant.\n\nThe other unexpected thing about this book is how major characters meet their ends. It is sudden, but interesting. Having not read any other book of Ruth, I do not know if this is characteristic of her stories but here it really spikes your interest when it occurs.\n\nIf you are already a fan of Ruth Rendell or if you don’t mind a (very) slow burn mystery, you are definitely in for a treat. I am not a slow burn mystery fan and so my score reflects my preferences mainly.\n\nI would say it deserves a 5, the score lifted mainly due to the excellent conclusion of the story.\n\n== Krishna\n\nThis is a book featuring Sherlock Holmes but as a loving husband of Mary Russell. We have reviewed two such books earlier :\n\nThe Moor was the first one and O Jerusalem was the second one.\n\nWe liked the first one not at all, if you have read the review and the second one was better, but only slightly.\n\nThe complaints I have about those books still remain. This book too pretends to be a real life event with a manuscript sent to the author by some unknown source. Still Sherlock is only ornamental and Russell does all the thinking and the work. However, these are old laments, and for this book, I am going to try and overlook familiar issues and judge the story on its merits.\n\nStarts interesting enough. An archeological friend of Russell, Miss Ruskin, brings an old document – it is a letter sent by Mary, father of Christ, to her sister, Mary of Magdalene! Russell always considered Maria Magdalina as one of the disciples of Christ, and not the famous prostitute who was rescued by Jesus.\n\nWhen Ruskin is killed in London, they both visit the place and realize that it was a trap set for Ruskin – with a ‘beggar’ sitting at the street corner with an invisible tripwire and an automobile ready to make use of the moment she tripped onto the road.\n\nSherlock calmly announces that their home has meanwhile been vandalized. He had anticipated it and had give the day off for the servant so that she will not be in harm’s way. Also, the parchment (letter from Mary) was discreetly moved to a place inside a beehive where no intruder could have gone to search.\n\nThe Scotland Yard is given the letter that Russell got (after steaming open the letter, reading it and carefully resealing it, of course). They learn that two people had come looking for Ruskin and enquired about her with Ruskin’s sister, who had given them the hotel’s address and also told them that she was planning to meet Holmes and Russell, which explained the vandalism they faced.\n\nThe inspector Legrade, who was assigned to the case, goes to see Ruskin’s sister, and Russell goes with him in the guise of his ‘assistant’.\n\nThey all go to Mycroft Holmes, the portly but extremely intelligent brother of Sherlock. Russell dresses up as an innocent uncertain young girl new to the city to go meet Colonel Edwards in a pub in London. He is the man that Ruskin saw last, and is furious that Ruskin is a ‘woman’ and no one told him before he agreed to meet a V D Ruskin.\n\nShe goes in disguise as Mary Small, a helpless newcomer to London and gets “rescued” by Edwards and beautifully manages to secure the position of his secretary being ‘helpless and new to London’. She quickly discovers that he is of the ‘keep women barefoot and in the kitchen’ variety of a misogynist. Unless of course they want to be nurses or secretaries.\n\nWhen the young Edwards, who is the son, tries to act fresh with “Mary Small’ the little girl nearly maims him ‘by accident’. Meanwhile Holmes is acting as a manservant in the house of another character close to Ruskin.\n\nEven discounting my usual lament that Holmes does not use his gray cells as much in this series as he is known to, instead using his muscles in the legs and arms by running around, the book sags a lot. The interesting point about Mary’s letter is fully forgotten as the couple go around trying to find who murdered Dorothy and that too is a slow way.\n\nFinally, after much flailing around, Russell manages to track down an old friend of Dorothy who talks under hypnosis.\n\nWhen they capture the children of the sister, the inspector is frustrated by the lack of evidence and she openly sneers at Holmes deceiving her and Russell acting as a simple girl. She taunts them with the lack of evidence. Defeated, Holmes and Russell come back and realize that they have missed something critical. Ruminating over the past in frustration, Russell remembers a chance remark by Ruskin about Holmes being very good with his hands which seem to have an intuition all their own in opening complex boxes.\n\nA sudden epiphany there! They fetch the box for another closer look.\n\nThe story ends, and ends explaining the plot fully without loose ends. But my complaints about this one is the same as the ones I had about the previous books we reviewed in the series: Sherlock does not do any thinking on the lines that made him famous; Russell and Sherlock run around sleuthing heavily to no specific purpose and with no specific results; the denouement in the story comes suddenly and has absolutely nothing to do with the chain of events earlier; suddenly everything is solved and all the swagger of the evil ones is quashed.\n\nThis is not the Holmes I remember. And the cop out about the letter of Mary, which kickstarts this story is simply another annoyance on top of many.\n\nStill, this is a moderately interesting book and so let us give it a 4/10\n\n= = Krishna"
