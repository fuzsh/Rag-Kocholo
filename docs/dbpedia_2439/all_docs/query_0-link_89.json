        "text": "Today I’m reviewing Lily: A Tale of Revenge by Rose Tremain.\n\nHere’s the blurb\n\nNobody knows yet that she is a murderer…\n\nLondon, 1850. On a freezing winter’s night, a baby is abandoned at the gates of a park only to be saved by a young policeman and taken to the Foundling Hospital.\n\nAfter suffering years of brutal hardship at the Hospital, Lily is released into the world of Victorian London. But she is hiding a dreadful secret…\n\nWhen Lily and the policeman meet again, Lily is convinced that he holds the key to her happiness. But might he also be the one to uncover her crime and so condemn her to death?\n\nReview\n\n3 things stood out when I first noticed this book, foremost my daughters middle name is Lily so that actually caught my eye, not just the name but the fact it’s a short, sharp title for a book which intrigued me, I also loved the vivid colours on the book cover, it’s very pleasing on the eye. I picked up the book to check the blurb and after that there was zero chance I could walk away without buying a copy. I imagined a very emotional journey but I had no idea just how emotional it would be and I underestimated greatly how I would feel.\n\nAs a young girl Lily is abandoned, only to be saved from certain death.. but as you read on it can I feels like death might have been a blessing from the terrors she will see in her life.\n\nLily is taken to the Foundling Hospital.. but care is not there primary aim.. it’s obedience and failing to do as commanded has severe consequences.\n\nIt’s a horrible cruel journey but one Lily isn’t really aware of yet, she’s too young and at first each foundling has a chance to be fostered for a short time with a real family, but for some this means they form strong connections with the family but these families are bound by rules to return the children.\n\nLily, among others, loves her foster family.. it’s only when they are to be returned to the hospital that many find out they are a foundling.. they were too young when fostered so the family is all they know and in a split second they are torn from that family comfort and thrust into a life of terror.. beating.. head shaving..I can’t even find the words to describe how horrible the hospital is.. but the worst is yet to come.\n\nAt one point Lily makes a very close friend and they plot to escape and go back to their foster families..they manage to escape but being young girls they don’t manage to get far and in that short time they are free they see how cruel the outside world can be.. just a glimpse but a taster of things to come.\n\nWhen they arrive back at the hospital they are separated and not allowed to comfort each other. I won’t spoil what happens next but to say Lily’s small world is crushed is an understatement, added to mental pain she endures physical pain too as there’s a nurse obsessed with sin, who isnt above a bit of abuse.. you have no idea how bad she is,\n\nWhen Lily is old enough, she leaves the hospital, finds a job and in time reconnects with the man who saved her.. and he still wants to save her.\n\nThe mental heartache continues when a strange connection grows between them..there’s also some striking events that happen when Lily revisits her past that could lead to the end of the connection the pair have.\n\nIn the end Lily revisits her past.. as far back as she can go and more heartache awaits her.. but maybe also her chance of a new life, of redemption.. who knows?\n\nYou can probably tell as I’ve ranted on so long that I loved the plot, engrossing and so damn emotionally draining..you feel every low with Lily, her heartache.. the moments when she just admits defeat.. the moment she snaps.. a lot of her pain in held inside but as you read the story you kind of take the role of Lily on so when events play out it’s like it’s your own emotions playing out on paper!\n\nI don’t think many books have managed to emotionally connect with me as a reader as much as Lily did. I can’t praise this one enough. There’s a lot of tough moments but I would really recommend this to anyone who wants to feel that connection with a character as I’ve no doubt at all that you’ll love Lily just as much as I did!\n\n5/5 Stars"
