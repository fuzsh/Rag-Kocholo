        "text": "The film is very loosely based on Rose Tremain's novel Trespass. Writer/director Clio Barnard wrote an initial screenplay that was much closer to the book, which focuses on two sets of of siblings in their sixties who become involved in a property dispute in France. After the initial draft, her producers encouraged her to make the story her own so that the final film, which focuses on only one set of siblings in their thirties and is set in England is only very loosely related to the book."
