        "text": "“It’s because sooner or later something terrible will happen. My grandmother used to tell my mother that, all through her childhood, and my mother would tell me, throughout mine. And now I have to take care of Nina.” (Fever Dream, Samantha Schweblin, Megan McDowell, Oneworld Publications, UK, 2017, 104)\n\nThis is Samantha Schweblin’s first novel and to say that it is only 151 pages long, it is incredibly unsettling. Schweblin ratchets up the tension instantly, creating a world that is eery and dreamlike. The entire book is structured as a conversation between Amanda and David (David’s words are italicised, giving him even more of a strange, menacing quality) about the events leading up the present moment. It is never clear how much of what Amanda says and remembers is true and for that matter it is never fully clear what is happening in the story. Together they are trying to understand, to find “the exact moment” and as the story nears this moment the dread is palpable. Amanda recounts what seems to be the recent past – a stay at a holiday house with her daughter, Nina and her first encounters with Carla (David’s mother). David frequently admonishes her for including unimportant details or for not getting through the story quick enough. He seems to know what he is looking for, leaving Amanda and the reader clueless. It is visually stunning; Schweblin conveys the heat of an Argentinian summer perfectly and you can see every tiny detail she includes. Despite simply being an ongoing description of someone’s holiday, it is at times unbearably gripping. I started out trying to read between the lines, looking for clues as to what had happened to Nina, what was the connection with the worms and had David’s soul really been transferred into another body? But such is the atmospheric quality of the novel, that I quickly just became engrossed in the dialogue between Amanda and David and the nightmarish pace of the prose. It gives the feeling of the answer being tantalisingly close, yet just out of reach. You can sense something terrible about to happen after every page, but it never quite gives you the answers you are looking for.\n\nThe entire experience is something I can’t quite put my finger on and this is a book that I would love to read again, delving deeper each time. There are allusions to the worms and the poisonings being references to the fears about genetically modified crops in Argentina (and it is probably the case that David, Amanda and Nina were all poisoned by some kind of pesticide on the soy farm that is in the background of the novel), yet the questions of spirits and souls add another layer of intrigue. The original title of the book (in Spanish) was Distancia de Rescate (rescue distance), referring to the calculations Amanda made about how far away she could be away from her daughter. She described it as a rope between them, that became taut when the rescue distance was close and she had to stay close by. This idea of parents and their desires to keep their children close and safe, comes up many times in the novel. It is also seen in Carla’s attempt to save her young son’s life, by transferring his soul into another body. In her desperation to keep him alive, she creates what she describes as a ‘monster’. Samantha Schweblin is definitely one to watch. 8/10\n\nFor the first time in a long while, he looked down and saw his hands. If you have ever had this experience, you’ll know just what I mean. – Jesse Ball, The Curfew (Fever Dream, Samantha Schweblin, I)\n\n“What do you crave but never get?” (Music for Torching, A. M. Homes, Granta, 1999, 97)\n\nMusic for Torching is a dark, bleak dive into the hidden world of middle-class American suburbia. I was grabbed instantly by the plot premise – your average husband, wife and 2.3 kids set fire to their house and drive away – but I wasn’t prepared for the sheer depth of the novel.\n\nA. M. Homes is known for her controversial writing topics (most notably The End of Alice), but it is the prose and the small details of the plot that make Music for Torching into something special. Reading it is an oddly disjointed experience, as the two main characters, husband and wife Paul and Elaine, become involved in ever increasing acts of madness. What is brilliant about Homes’ writing is that the things Paul and Elaine do are actually fairly normal things, yet the way they are written and the contrast to the calm, suburban backdrop, make them seem bizarre and haphazard.\n\nNeither Paul nor Elaine are very fleshed-out characters, but they stand perfectly for that white, middle-class suburban fear. Paul works at a bland, advertising job ‘in the city’ and conducts secretive affairs with the other wives, while Elaine looks after the house, shops and drinks. They have a group of similarly aged friends, all seeming to suffer from the same malady – too much time and not enough to do. Paul and Elaine’s decision to set their house on fire comes from a frustration at the suburban hell they are living in, which Homes portrays expertly. It is at times an incredibly depressing read as Paul and Elaine’s lives progress with little substance and even their liberating plan to burn their house down and run away becomes fraught with problems.\n\nThe fraud factor is what Paul calls it, the fear of being revealed. Paul and Elaine already knew it, and in fact, setting the fire was on some level a declaration of their awareness, the great and formal announcement: This is not who we are, we are not like you, we have failed, we are failing, we are failures. And yet, this is exactly who they are; they are not different at all. They are exactly the same as everyone else, and worse yet, they are trapped in it, entirely engulfed – this is their life. (Music for Torching, 53)\n\nHomes paints an endless cycle of ennui and it is hard not to get sucked into it. Even as Paul and Elaine attempt to break free from the consumerist society they have bought into, they find obstacles in their way and slowly begin to lapse back into the status quo. Their inner frustrations are embodied in the actions they both take, but ultimately they fail to find the key to their happiness.\n\nHomes is completely uncompromising in her depiction of suburbia, noting the contrast between the appearance and the reality behind the different marriages and the deep-seated hatred amongst them. The novels ends on a deeply bitter note, drawing into the larger context of the time it was written (late 90s). The whole thing is a skilled rendition of people’s hidden desires and motives and it definitely stands out in the ‘suburban hell’ genre for it’s darkly comic and sinister take on white 90s America and our consumerist society as a whole.\n\nAt their house things don’t go like this; nothing is easy; it’s every man for himself, each hoarding what little he has, each wanting his own, each wanting something different. They speak in the defensive. They wait for disappointment. They constantly accumulate proof of having been let down, misunderstood, unappreciated. They are a tense and bitter lot, and haven’t even noticed it until now. (Music for Torching, 54)\n\n7/10\n\n“But every slave thinks about it. In the morning and in the afternoon and in the night. Dreaming of it. Every dream a dream of escape even when it didn’t look like it. When it was a dream of new shoes. The opportunity stepped up and Lovey availed herself, heedless of the whip.” (The Underground Railroad, Colson Whitehead, Fleet, Great Britain, 56)\n\nColson Whitehead’s sixth novel, The Underground Railroad, is a strange, moving account of slavery in the United States. It uses a lot of the same tropes and language we have come to expect from similar novels, but Whitehead uses the history of the underground railroad and brings it to life. The underground railroad in this story is not just a route of allies and safe houses to help slaves to freedom, but an actual physical railroad track underneath the ground. Colson Whitehead describes it through the eyes of Cora, an orphaned slave on the Randall plantation. The reader is introduced to life on the plantation and although the day-to-day life is not described in as much detail as in other novels I have read, the violence used against the slaves is incredibly graphic and distressing. Whitehead weaves into the story in such a way that it seems to come out of nowhere and it completely knocked me back. It’s fitting, however, and the issue is not one we can shy away from. Whitehead puts it so completely at the forefront of the narrative, yet also portrays it as an everyday happening, that it is hard not be affected by it.\n\nThere are a few different branches of the same story, but it is all interweaved throughout and the main character, Cora, is the person the novel focuses on. She is convinced to escape the farm with another slave, Caesar, who believes that she will be lucky and will succeed in escaping as her mother did many years earlier. They travel on the underground railroad, first landing in South Georgia, where Cora takes up a job as a housekeeper. When Cora goes to the “colored wing” of the hospital to see a doctor, he encourages her to think about sterilisation, which she learns is offered to many sick black women or women who have already got a few children. Cora notes that it probably isn’t offered to the woman she works for, who suffers from a mental illness. While the point being made is a little obvious, it’s a stark reminder of the way black women were treated, even as ‘free people’. Later on in the story, one of the allies of the railroad (a white man who runs a bar), describes a conversation he has with a doctor who is running tests on black people who are in the last stages of syphilis. They are under the assumption that they are being given medicine, whilst the doctors are secretly using them as test subjects. He goes on to talk about the other tests they are running and why he believes it is such necessary research,\n\n“Did Sam know that the Igbo tribe of the African continent is predisposed to nervous disorders? Suicide and black moods? The doctor recounted the story of forty slaves, shackled together on a ship, who jumped overboard en masse rather than live in bondage. The kind of mind that could conceive of and execute such a fantastic course!” (Whitehead, 121)\n\nIt sounds like such an unbelievably shocking attitude to us, but at the time, they were convinced that black people were little more than animals and therefore felt it acceptable to use them as lab rats or slaves. The irony was probably lost on the doctor that the slaves that were being brought across from Africa were suicidal because they had been torn from their homes and subjected to squalid conditions aboard a ship for weeks or even months at a time.\n\nWhitehead manages to excellently convey the fear and dread felt by slaves who had escaped and run away, even if they had gained their free papers. He describes the methods used by slave-catchers and bounty hunters to sneak people out from local jails so they could be delivered back to their ‘master’ for a fee. Again, the language is sparse and brutal and the way Ridgeway speaks about his captives (often referring to them as ‘it’), is horribly disturbing. There is a moment in the book when Ridgeway has become tired of listening to the singing of a slave he is transporting and calmly shoots him in the face, justifying his actions in a calculated, almost inhuman manner,\n\n“Ridgeway wiped his face and explained his reasoning. Jasper’s reward was fifty dollars, fifteen of that for the tinker who brought the fugitive to jail. Missouri, back east, Georgia – it would be weeks before they delivered the man to his owner. Divide thirty-five dollars by, say, three weeks, minus Boseman’s share, and the lost bounty was a very small price to pay for silence and a restful mind.” (Whitehead, 212)\n\nEach time Cora seems to have found some form of ‘freedom’, it becomes another example of slavery. In South Georgia, she is free to work and walk down the street, yet she faces racism and ‘voluntary’ sterilisation from the doctors, in North Carolina, she finds a community that has become a lynch mob, hanging both black people and white people who help them and using it as a form of entertainment. Here, Cora has to hide out for months in a nook in an attic, where she considers that although she may be ‘free’, she is actually physically even more confined and is forced to listen to the lynch mob just outside.\n\nCora is a brilliant character, but she felt at times a little too confident. She was amazingly audacious and it felt great to see her fighting back against Randall and Ridgeway. But at times I wondered if this was a little far from the truth. It was hard to believe she would have been so confident, after a life of slavery. As a hero though, she was inspiring.\n\nThis novel is a searing indictment of life in America, although it is subtle and instead looks back to the genocide of the Native Americans as a way of portraying the crimes of the white race. It is a painful read at times, made even more realistic by the use of historical adverts (at least, I presume they were genuine) and although the story was a little confusing at times (for me), it lost none of its impact. 7/10\n\n“‘And America, too, is a delusion, the grandest one of all. The white race believes – believes with all its heart – that it is their right to take the land. To kill Indians. Make war. Enslave their brothers. This nation shouldn’t exist, if there is any justice in the world, for its foundations are murder, theft, and cruelty. Yet here we are.” (Whitehead, 285)\n\nWhat are you reading?\n\nwarmth, rx\n\nwarmth, rc\n\n“It is creating there a yearning no longer to be Merivel, the Fool, but to be…’ (here, I had to pause and shovel the last crumbs of the lardy cake into my mouth) ‘…to be Merivel, the proper man.” (Restoration, Rose Tremain, Vintage, London, 2009, 123)\n\nThis has got to be one of my favourite lines from the book, but oh how many there are. Robert Merivel is the sinner in all of us, exhibiting gluttony, lust, pride, sloth and envy, but being one of the wittiest, most likeable literary heroes I have ever come across. His moment with the lardy cake is for everyone who has ever procrastinated (and for those who love cake).\n\nTremain’s sprawling historical novel is set during the reign of King Charles II. Robert Merivel is a medical student, who accidentally cures the King’s favourite dog (by passing out in a drunken stupor and abandoning it) and becomes one of the King’s favourites. The King sets out to use him as a ‘paper groom’, marrying Merivel off to his (the King’s) mistress, in an attempt to curb gossip. Merivel is a lover of life, colour, food and women. Yet his existence is tragic and his many pleasures seem to be a cover and an attempt to forget his problems. For the first half of the book he lives life lavishly, enjoying fine clothes, rich food and outlandish décor – “This money enabled me to buy a great quantity of Chinese furniture for my Withdrawing Room, to hand the walls with ruched vermilion taffeta and Peking scrolls, to upholster my chairs in scarlet and carmine and gold and to lay upon the floor a carpet from Chengchow so elaborate in design it had been a thousand days upon the loom.” (Tremain, 37). When he is given a house in Norfolk (as part of his deal to marry the King’s mistress), he fills the different rooms with activities he has never undertaken – a Music Room for an oboe he has never picked up, a Billiard Room (despite having never held a cue) and a Studio, where he hopes to become an artist. If nothing else Merivel is enthusiastic in his pursuits, convinced of his own brilliance. At one point, he attempts to design a new kind of coat inspired, he says, by the Russians. He instructs his tailor to make the coats (one for each member of staff) entirely out of badger skins,\n\n“…so vivid had my imaginary Russians become that I had convinced myself that I at least could not survive the winter without this peculiar garment of fur. The idea, furthermore, that we could wait out the spring dressed as badgers delighted me considerably.” (Tremain, 126)\n\nMerivel is so completely wild that it is almost a shame that his character arc changes in the way it does. It makes for a good story, but the loutish, witty Merivel the Fool from the first half of the book is hilarious, his grand manner and delusions often tempered by his close friend, Pearce, a Quaker who works in a mental institution. At one point, Merivel is given a gift of an ‘Indian Nightingale’, as a bribe for his influence with the King. Merivel cherishes this rare gift, singing to it and showing it off, until Pearce scornfully informs him of its true nature,\n\n“Shading his eyes from the brilliance of the furnishings, he approached the cage and stood blinking at it like a lizard. I ceased my singing and the bird at once let out a melodious trill.\n\n‘I recognise that,’ said Pearce.\n\n‘What is it?’ I asked excitedly. ‘Something by Purcell?’\n\n‘No,’ said Pearce, and turned upon me a pitying, reptilian look. ‘That is the warble of a common blackbird.’ (Tremain, 65-66)\n\nTremain’s language is so perfectly sharp and witty and I simply loved the first half of the book. Merivel’s story arc from sinner to saint is a great story, but I would have loved to read more of his libidinous side. Fortunately, Tremain has written a sequel, Merivel, “because she was addicted not so much to the character as to the voice that she had invented for him” (The Guardian – this is a good article to read, which goes a lot deeper into the themes). He is the archetypal man of the age and Restoration is a joy to read. 8/10\n\nN.B. Restoration was Shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize and was also made into a film starring Robert Downey Jr (?!). Apparently Tremain liked RDJ in the role of Merivel, but didn’t like the way the film turned the story into a romance. It looks like one to avoid.\n\nThe book we were given for our September group meeting was Still Alice by Lisa Genova, a book that is immensely popular on Goodreads, has topped plenty of bestseller lists and garnered plenty of glittering reviews. I was a little bit turned off by all the hype surrounding it, but, I had watched the film adaptation with Julianne Moore a few years back and really enjoyed it. It was devastating and the depiction of Alice’s character and her journey from renowned professor of linguistics to Alzheimer’s patient was very moving. I hoped that the book would delve deeper into her psyche and her relationship with her family, but unfortunately it was a major let-down.\n\nThe plot itself has a lot going for it and I think one of the ways that Genova has hit the mark is the way she puts the reader inside Alice’s head, although, it sometimes falls short (more on that later). The books starts with a brilliant bit of foreshadowing,\n\n“Even then, more than a year earlier, there were neurons in her head…that were being strangled to death, too quietly for her to hear them.” (Still Alice, Lisa Genova, Simon & Schuster UK Ltd, London, 2015, 1)\n\nAlice’s demise goes on from there quite quickly, but it is little things at first, which she passes off as menopause symptoms. As the story goes on, she begins to forget more and more – words that are second nature to her slip her mind, notes that she has written to herself make no sense, she forgets people she has just been introduced to her and as her disease gets worse, she begins to lose herself in her own house. Genova uses Alice’s own disorientation to confuse the reader and follow Alice through her day not knowing what she is forgetting to do, or which meetings she has forgotten to attend. For the most part, it works exceptionally well, but there are some instances where it tends to get a bit muddled in the story. For example, at one point, Alice walks into a lecture hall and sits down to wait for the professor. The scene describes some students talking behind her and also wondering where the professor is. At one point, Alice has had enough, stands up to leave and says something along the lines of, “Well I’m not going to waste my time.” The film makes it much more explicit that the class she has walked into, is actually the class she is supposed to be teaching. However, as we are effectively in Alice’s head in the book, we just think she is waiting for a class she is observing or studying. It is only quite a bit later on in the book that Alice is summoned to her department head’s office to discuss some negative feedback on her teachings and he reads aloud complaints from various students. The scene in the film had a very strong impact – it was mortifying to watch Alice have absolutely no idea what was going on. But in the book, because we are wrapped up inside Alice’s psyche, we actually have no idea that there is something going wrong, and so it loses its impact.\n\nAlice’s mind degenerates even more throughout the book and as we get near the end, she is unable to recognise one of her own children and cannot follow simple instructions. It is a very sad portrayal and Genova has done well to highlight the full decline, but there is definitely something missing. Alice’s character is not fully fleshed out from the beginning; she is merely a vehicle for early onset Alzheimer’s disease. Genova briefly shows her with an active mind and body at the beginning of the story, but there is not much there to confirm that, apart from the odd comment from a colleague or a paragraph where Alice muses about her successes. The whole story is very much ‘literature by numbers’ and when I learnt the background surrounding Genova and Still Alice, it made a lot of sense. Lisa Genova has a PhD in neuroscience and she has done a huge amount of research on Alzheimer’s, genetic testing and the world of care support. She is clearly immensely knowledgeable, but a novelist she is not. Things became even clearer when I saw that she had self-published Still Alice. I agree that it a very serious subject matter and it will enlighten millions of people about Alzheimer’s, but as a novel, it needs a serious amount of polishing.\n\nThere are a couple of sections where Genova literally just reels off scientific facts – the one that comes to mind is the scene where Alice and her husband, John, are speaking to a doctor and talking about genetic testing and cures. There is a long back-and-forth between John and the doctor about clinical trials and genetic mutations. It is very detailed and it could be fascinating, except for the fact that it is just set out as a very dull conversation. It was a lot of clumsy exposition and it does little more than just force-feed the reader a lot of facts that are quickly forgotten. Alice and John’s children also seem to fill this expositional role. They are simply three stereotypes that move Alice’s Alzheimer’s along, without really being expanded on as people. The eldest, Anna, is struggling to conceive, which leads to this quite odd exchange,\n\n“ ‘She had genetic screening. She has the presenilin-1 mutation,’ said John.\n\n‘Is it autosomal dominant?’ asked Tom.\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n…\n\n‘What does that mean? Dad, what did you just tell him?’ Anna asked.\n\n‘It means we have a fifty percent chance of getting Alzheimer’s disease,’ said Tom.\n\n‘What about my baby?’\n\n‘You’re not even pregnant yet,’ said Lydia.\n\n…\n\n‘Oh my god, what if I have it? And then my baby could have it,’ said Anna.’” (Genova, 116)\n\nThis is the first time Alice’s children learn about her diagnosis of Alzheimer’s and that is the conversation they have. Tom is conveniently a medical student, so he can also exposition the sciency-stuff. It is this kind of tedious dialogue and two-dimensional character-writing that really holds the story back, along with some very bizarre phrases (that sound like a thesaurus was used with no shame),\n\n“Only the prices next to the items showed signs of recent attention, outlined with chalk dust in the shape of a rectangular school eraser and printed in a penmanship belonging to someone other than the author of the offerings to their left.” (Genova, 104)\n\nMaybe this is another way of trying to alienate the reader by aligning them with Alice’s psyche and her loss of well-known words? I’m not sure, but I don’t think so. It too closely resembles the type of flowery, descriptive writing used in “chick-lit” and “women’s fiction” and a lot of the time, it feels like this is the market that Genova is trying to attract, “With each lick, she savoured the delicious taste of chocolate and peanut butter, demonstrating the intact activation of her brain’s pleasure pathways, the same ones required for enjoying sex or a good bottle of wine.” (Genova, 130). It seems like Still Alice is pandering to a specific readership, by using these kinds of stereotypical interests (sex and good wine), that are constantly written about in glossy magazines and other examples of “women’s fiction”. Considering that Genova wanted to reach a huge number of people with this book, it is frustrating that the language itself is just so reminiscent of easy-reading chick-lit. That’s just a personal opinion though and I think I will be in the minority when it comes to our group meeting – the group who preferred The Little Coffee Shop of Kabul over Americanah…for shame!\n\nLisa Genova has had so much success with Still Alice, but for me and my literary leanings, she definitely missed a trick. It is a fairly in-depth portrayal of early-onset Alzheimer’s disease, but it is far too basic and leaves out too much of Alice’s relationships. Admittedly, the ending was very sad; Alice opens the letter that she wrote to herself before Alzheimer’s had taken over her life, and inside are instructions on how to kill herself. However, she fails to remember the instructions as she walks up the stairs to find the hidden pills. It’s sad, and Alice’s complete detachment from the situation makes it even sadder, but ultimately the whole thing falls flat. These aren’t characters we can grow to like or even empathise with and it’s a rare occasion where I will say, film over book. 5.5/10\n\n“The rib bones are the closed ellipses of the planets, with their focus in the sternum, the breastbone, the white centre of the photograph. The lungs are the grey shadows of the Milky Way against the black leaden shield of space. The heart’s dark contour in the cloud of ashes from the burned-out sun. The intestine’s lazy hyperbole are the disconnected asteroids, the vagabonds of space, the scattered cosmic dust.” (Miss Smilla’s Feeling for Snow, Peter Høeg, Vintage, London, 209)\n\nA lot of thrillers and murder mysteries are described as ‘chilling’, but this one fits the description more aptly than most. Miss Smilla’s Feeling for Snow is not your typical murder mystery and Smilla Jaspersen is not the typical heroine. Reading Peter Høeg’s Arctic thriller is so much like losing yourself in an icy wasteland that it’s eerie. It is not only the lengths that people go to in order to protect themselves that chills you, but also the strange, mystical relationships between Smilla and Isaiah and the mechanic, and the atmospheric descriptions of the bleak winter.\n\nThe story begins with the death of a young boy, Isaiah, who has fallen off a roof. Although perceived as a routine accident, it is Smilla who becomes suspicious (knowing of his fear of heights) and begins investigating. The story is different in that it does not follow a typical investigative pattern and as the story progresses, it becomes more about an exploration of Smilla’s psyche and a clash of cultures. It is not always an easy read to follow; it is at times dreamy and melancholic and the investigation itself takes second place to the relationships that are connected throughout. Smilla (as well as Isaiah) is part Greenlander; she has grown up in extreme cold with an almost Sherlock-esque knowledge of snow and ice.\n\n“‘They were acceleration tracks. When you jump from snow or ice, there is a pronation in the ankle joint. As there is when you walk barefoot in the sand…When you’re used to playing in snow, you don’t believe that kind of track, because that movement is not efficient, like faulty distribution of your weight going uphill cross-country skiing.'” (Høeg, 37)\n\nPrior to his death, Smilla had become an accidental caregiver to Isaiah, who lived in the same building with his depressed, alcoholic mother. Although Smilla claims to hate children, their relationship had become very close and caring, maybe because they were both outsiders in a world where they are viewed with some distrust. Smilla is a brilliant protagonist and it is unusual to find such a nuanced female character in a thriller. Not only is her background and knowledge completely fascinating, she is also brave, daring, a tough fighter, but also naïve and humanly flawed. Little aspects of her personality have been worked in throughout and in this way Høeg manages to create a fully-formed person you can root for. Her relationships with Isaiah, the mechanic, her father and the people she meets along her journey are all varied and detailed. We learn so much about her past with her father and he in turn becomes more than just an expositional caricature. The whole book and its language feels bleak and grey, yet it is never dull. Even the scientific and mathematical interludes have an other-worldly feel.\n\nSmilla’s journey takes her aboard a ship bound for Greenland (although no one on board is exactly sure where) and these passages are brilliantly illustrated, capturing the desolation of the landscape and Smilla’s disorientation at sea. It feels like time stops at these points as they attempt to move through the impenetrable ice. Høeg manages to perfectly capture the vastness of the ocean and the terror and sheer power of the ice; it is an engaging read.\n\n“Right now I can see how the impact of collisions has splintered the edges of the floes, forcing them up into barriers twenty metres high; underneath, the floes extend thirty metres down in the water. It’s freezing up all around us. At this moment I can feel how the sea wants to close as in, how it is merely a coincidental, passing constellation of water, wind, and current that allows us to continue.” (Høeg, 365)\n\nIt is immensely quotable and a very immersive read. It is at times hard to follow, but Høeg has created such an intriguing character in Smilla and I love how central her upbringing is to the story.\n\nThere are a few odd passages that seem a little clunky and coincidental – my favourite is the part where Smilla goes to meet with someone who can translate s speech on a cassette tape and also identify the speaker. As Smilla puts it, “‘I am looking for someone who can listen to the voice and tell me that the speaker has henna-dyed hair and was spanked as a five-year-old when he was sitting on the potty, and from his vowels it sounds as if this happened in Akunnaaq in 1947.'” (Høeg, 129). The person Smilla visits is simply called ‘the curator’ and he also has uncanny abilities, this time when it comes to sound, even managing to discern between Yamaha Grand and Bösendorfer pianos. He turns out to also be the pastor who buried Isaiah and then in the final reveal, tells Smilla he has been blind since he was twelve. As she is leaving, Smilla thinks that it’s, “really very wrong to harass a blind man,” (Høeg, 136) before telling him he ought to barricade the doors in case someone decides to rob him. It is unwittingly witty (unless it’s standard Scandanavian humour?) and pretty entertaining and the curator’s deduction of the tape is brilliant despite its tenuous plausibility.\n\nMiss Smilla’s Feeling for Snow is not a quick read and it is another one you really have to pour yourself into, but it is a rich and beautiful novel, with much more hidden below its surface. The main plot thread (the murder) is like the tip of the iceberg. But it is everything else that makes up the bulk of the novel – the large-scale desecration of the Greenlandic environment by the Europeans, Smilla’s love of mathematics and geometry, her curious relationships with others and the fascinating dip into Inuit culture (although I would have loved so much more of that).\n\n7/10\n\nNext: John Grisham’s An Innocent Man\n\nCurrently reading: Restoration – Rose Tremain\n\n“It is creating there a yearning no longer to be Merivel, the Fool, but to be…’ (here, I had to pause and shovel the last crumbs of the lardy cake into my mouth) ‘…to be Merivel, the proper man.” Who can relate 😂\n\n“…a feeling like being torn open; not like a body of flesh, it is not painful as such, but like a peach; and not even torn open, but too ripe and splitting open of its own accord.\n\nAnd inside the peach there’s a stone.” (Alias Grace, Margaret Atwood, Virago Press, 2009, 79)\n\nAlias Grace is a mystery wrapped in a mystery, wrapped in a story. It is a fictionalised account of the story surrounding Grace Marks, convicted of murdering her employer and his housekeeper (read mistress) in rural 1840s Canada. It’s a delightfully Victorian-style read, full of spiritualism, hysteria, sexuality, and Victorian psychology. Grace’s story is tragic and beguiling in equal measures and she is a completely enchanting, complex protagonist.\n\nBorn in the north of Ireland, she had a hard upbringing, with many young siblings to help take care of and an alcoholic father, who squandered most of his income. Grace’s story (as told to Dr Simon Jordan) first takes us from Ireland on an eight week ship journey to Canada, in search of better prospects. It’s a small section of the book, but Atwood describes it so perfectly from Grace’s view point, that it becomes wholly immersive. When Grace’s mother dies on board and is thrown into the Atlantic ocean, the whole weight of Grace’s burdens crowd in and it is hard not to feel the abject horror of her situation. She was barely thirteen when she arrived in Canada and later began looking for work to support her younger siblings. Alone and naïve, she eventually ended up in the home of Mrs Alderman Parkinson, where she worked as a servant and became friends with Mary Whitney. From there she worked in a few different houses, before she ended up working for Mr Kinnear and Nancy, whose murders she was incarcerated for.\n\nGrace’s story is intertwined with her present day situation and the whole book is a patchwork of different times and realities. Atwood also adds in excerpts from journalistic (and some slightly more sensationalised) accounts of the time, along with the written ‘confessions’ of Grace and McDermott and various letters and diary entries written by doctors and prison governors. These all lend the text a certain verisimilitude, while also working at complete odds with the story being told. Grace’s telling of the story is so innocent and domesticated in its language, that it is impossible to see her as a cold-blooded killer. It opens up the utterly intangible nature of truth. Grace’s account is one version of the truth, McDermott’s is another and even amongst those who met Grace, there are inconsistencies in their tales.\n\n“I think of all the things that have been written about me – that I am an inhuman female demon, that I am an innocent victim of a blackguard forced against my will and in danger of my own life…that I have blue eyes, that I have green eyes, that I have auburn and also brown hair, that I am tall and also not above the average height…that I am brisk and smart about my work, that I am of a sullen disposition with a quarrelsome temper…that I am cunning and devious, that I am soft in the head and little better than an idiot. And I wonder, how can I be all of these different things at once? (Atwood, 25)\n\nGrace is not the only person playing a role in the story. Dr Jordan is keeping parts of his life a secret from his mother and later his landlady, his landlady in turn plays at acting as virtuous, Jeremiah the peddler turns up in various guises and Nancy plays as Kinnear’s housekeeper and mistress. It’s hard to ascertain anyone’s truth.\n\nWhen writing Alias Grace, Atwood said she felt she could not be certain of Grace’s guilt and so she hired many researchers, promising not to contradict anything they uncovered – instead, as she puts it in the afterword, “Where mere hints and outright gaps exist in the records, I have felt free to invent.” (Atwood, afterword).\n\n“The mind, he reflects, is like a house – though which the owner no longer wishes to display, or those which arose painful memories, are thrust out of sight, and consigned to attic or cellar; and in forgetting, as in the storage of broken furniture, there is surely an element of will at work.” (Atwood, 421)\n\nThe mind, it’s workings, dreams and the popular psychological theories of the time play a huge part in Alias Grace. Nearly everything we read is subjective and mired in questions. Cleverly though, it is not Grace (the suspected hysteric, liar and brilliant actor) I found myself disbelieving, but rather Dr Jordan. His motivations are not always clear and his blatant sexism, while indicative of the time, is brutishly crass. Dr Jordan is convinced that Grace is more than she seems and that she is, consciously or not, holding something back from her story,\n\n“As she stitches away at her sewing, outwardly calm as a marble Madonna, she is all the while exerting her passive stubborn strength against him. A prison does not only lock it’s inmates inside, it keeps all others out. Her strongest prison is one of her own construction.” (Atwood, 421)\n\nAs a poor, working class Victorian woman, Grace’s silence is one of the few small ways she can exert any power. This all again brings up the duality of Grace’s reputation and the common belief that women were either villainous corruptors or innocent victims – whores or virgins. To her supporters, Grace was a poor, naïve young girl, who fell victim to the brutish McDermott, and became involved in a ghastly affair, an archetypal fallen woman. But to her detractors, she is a cunning actor, who seduced McDermott to carry out her vicious plans and later tricked people into believing she was innocent.\n\nAt the same time there’s an element of glamour and intrigue surrounding her, which goes completely against her very domestic prose. The most popular account of the murders at the time was Susanna Moodie’s Life in the Clearings (1853), a highly sensationalised account of the murders and the confessions and subsequent trial. Dr Jordan admits himself to be intrigued by Grace’s status as a ‘murderess’, believing that she would be plain and dull without it. He likens it as a scent – “Hothouse gardenias. Lurid, but also furtive. He imagines himself breathing it as he draws Grace towards him…” (Atwood, 453). At the beginning of the book, Grace also attaches a scent to the peculiarly feminine word that has shaped her entire life, but for her, it is not so glamorous – “It has a smell to it, that word – murky and oppressive, like dead flowers in a vase.” (Atwood, 25)\n\nQuestions of spiritualism, memory and ‘female’ psychology all surround Grace, as different people all try to discover the truth behind the mystery. But Grace lies at the heart of it and it was her life that was impacted by the decisions made. Underneath the murky and inconclusive theories of the mind and memory are the strong bonds formed between Grace and the other when in her life. Her friendship with Mary Whitney is deep and complex and Mary shows up again and again, as a feisty alter ego to Grace’s mild-mannered demeanour. The part of Grace’s story with Mary was equally as heartfelt as the relationship with her mother and it signified Grace’s journey from childhood to adulthood. Grace’s relationship with Nancy is much more fraught, but there’s still a bond between them and Grace feels irrevocably linked to Nancy, even after her death. Atwood portrays these relationships beautifully, using the intricacies of everyday life to deepen their impact. At the end of the story, Grace contemplates making her own patchwork quilt and including small pieces of these relationships in it. In a way, it also signifies Grace’s journey; the white of Mary’s petticoat for her innocence, to the yellow of her prison clothes, where her life entered a kind of entropy to the pink cotton of Nancy’s dress – the three of them linked forever in her story.\n\n“On my Tree of Paradise, I intend to put a border of snakes entwined…as without a snake or two, the main part of the story would be missing…The Tree itself is of triangles, in two colours, dark for the leaves and a lighter colour for the fruits…But three of the triangles in my Tree will be different. One will be white, from the petticoat I still have that was Mary Whitney’s; one will be faded yellowish, from the prison nightdress I begged as a keepsake…And the third will be a pale cotton, a pink and white floral, cut from the dress of Nancy’s that she had on the first day I was at Mr Kinnear’s…\n\nI will embroider around each one of them with red feather stitching, to blend them in as part of the pattern.\n\nAnd so we will all be together.” (Atwood, 534)\n\nIn the end, the whole book is a patchwork, threaded together to make up a life. But it is similar to the way Grace only stitches some of the individual pieces of the patchwork quilt, which is just an artful imitation. This story is also just pieces of the whole; each piece is told by a different person who does not have the full picture of her story. It’s simply an imitation of a life, one we can never fully know the truth of.\n\n9/10 Another amazing read from Margaret Atwood! There is honestly just so much to unpick in this book, I can’t do it justice without writing a 5000 word essay. There’s plenty out there to read on the murders as well, but Alias Grace is a great place to start!\n\nWhat are you reading?\n\nwarmth, r x\n\n“Ove feels an instinctive skepticism towards all people taller than six feet; the blood can’t quite make it all the way up to the brain.” (A Man Called Ove, Fredrik Backman)\n\nI go to a book group every month and last month’s book was A Man Called Ove. It’s a very popular book – plenty of glittering reviews, part of the BBC Radio 2 Book Club and masses of 4/5 star reviews on Goodreads.\n\nI didn’t like it.\n\nI didn’t know all of that going in. It was described as being witty, slightly off-beat and heartwarming. I was there with the witty, off-beat Swedish curmudgeon, it lost me at heartwarming. But, I tend to give most books a chance and even when I’m barely tolerating a book, I at least skim through to the end. A Man Called Ove wasn’t quite so hard to finish, but I did end up leaving it right until to the last minute, so I’ve no quotes and no front cover picture.\n\n*SPOILERS PRESENT*\n\nSo, it’s about a man called Ove 😉 We’re introduced to Ove at a computer shop, where he’s playing Grumpy Old Technophobe No. 1 looking for an “O-pad”. It’s actually an amusing enough exchange, but it sadly goes downhill from there. Ove returns home and talks to his wife and thinks about the hook that he needs to place in the ceiling, and cancelling his electricity subscription and turning down all the radiators and yes, you can see where it’s going, can’t you? I don’t know if the author intended for it to be so obvious; it felt like it was supposed to be a shock, but even I (the completely oblivious reader) had it figured out. And I have to say, it was so sad. Ove tries repeatedly to commit suicide, so he can be with his wife in heaven and he’s constantly interrupted. I was honestly quite moved at this point. There’s another small chapter early on, where he goes to try and buy flowers for his wife’s grave and the people in the shop are quite rude to him (I think – my memory on that part isn’t so good). It really highlighted his complete alienation and sadness in the world and I think if the book had continued on in a similar manner, it would have been better for it.\n\nHowever, we’re introduced to a number of characters, who are one-dimensional at best and at worst, mere plot devices. The worst is the character, Mirsad. Mirsad comes into the story very late on and his character description is “homosexual”. That’s all we ever really know about him.\n\nIt goes like this. Ove is driving a bike to a café to give to the teenager working there, who wants to fix it (it belongs to the girl down the street, but that’s another story). He brings the bike in and the teenager literally just walks off to go and fix it. ??? Mirsad comes in and there’s some back and forth and it emerges that he’s (as Ove puts it) “bent”. Mirsad’s father comes in to fix a cooling unit, referring to it as a “fairy”. Ove fixes the cooling unit and the father (Amel) is HUGELY GRATEFUL. Later that night (or the next, who knows), Mirsad turns up at Ove’s house, because he’s been thrown out by his father when he came out. A couple of pages later, Mirsad makes up with his father (I think because of Ove’s miraculous mechanical skills) and in the epilogue, marries Jimmy (the fat man) and adopts a child.\n\nAll of this happens in the last 30-40 pages of a 294 page book and its so unbelievably expositionally clumsy that I just. Can’t. Even.\n\nMost of the other characters are equally one-dimensional and clichéd. There’s Jimmy (fat and likes computers), “Blonde Weed” (I’m not making this up – high heels, fake tan and a Chihuahua), Anders (middle-aged man in a relationship with Blonde Weed, who has some kind of role in the central conflict, but I forget what), Parvaneh (pregnant, Iranian woman who is nosy and cooks nice rice), her husband, kids, some completely obnoxious journalist, next door neighbours Rune (who has Alzheimer’s disease or similar) and Anita and so on.\n\nThe book is littered with these little moments where it feels like it’s trying to be heartwarming, but it just falls completely flat. It skips back in time to when Ove first met his wife, Sonja and fell in love with her. This is one of the most popular quotes from a quick Google search,\n\n“People said Ove saw the world in black and white. But she was color. All the color he had.”\n\nIt’s a lovely (albeit clichéd) sentiment, but I feel like it could have had so much more impact had Ove’s character and his relationship with Sonja been developed a bit more. Ove’s loneliness was so raw and real at the beginning of the book, but the scenarios he found himself in and the circus of characters running through his house, just made the whole thing become a bit silly. And it never made sense why anyone bothered with him so much. Parvaneh moves in to the house across the street at the beginning of the story and immediately starts barging into Ove’s house, bringing him boxes of food and offering to throw away Sonja’s belongings. Early on, Ove “warms to her” because she’s rude to her imbecilic husband and apparently this is the reason he tolerates her. However, every instance she appears and demands something of him, it just feels so forced.\n\nThe relationship Parvaneh’s children (3 and 7) have with Ove, feels equally clumsy. Apparently the three year old draws everyone in her family in black and white, but she always draws Ove in COLOUR. The two of them are soon calling him ‘Grandad’, after meeting him maybe a handful of times. Backman throws in little sentences and scenarios here and there about why these things occur, but it just doesn’t really click.\n\nFortunately, Backman does seem to have an awareness about some of the ironies in his plot. Towards the end of the story, Ove has a heart attack. You can see it coming, but not necessarily that he survives. In the hospital, the doctor says that he has a “big heart”. Thankfully, it’s not too smarmy a moment.\n\nI don’t want to say I hated this book. I can see why it’s popular (although I’ve lost quite a bit of respect for a certain reviewer on Goodreads who lauded this but trashed Swing Time) and I can see it appealing to a certain demographic, but I just didn’t find it funny in the slightest. Even the kind of dark humour just didn’t come through. At first it was sad and then it was just an eye roll book. It could have been so much more, but in the end it was not very much of anything; it was just halfway there on everything – love, relationships, loneliness, isolation, depression, community. In the Readers’ Questions, it asks you to think about the health care system and its limitations and how the book addressed this. But it was such an unexplored theme in the book, I think it’s a bit lazy to say that this book was hugely insightful. It just needed so much more development for me.\n\n4/10 😦\n\nI’m working now on my review on Alias Grace (which I loved, like most Margaret Atwood) and I’m currently reading Miss Smilla’s Feeling for Snow (Peter Høeg). I bought some fab new books recently and they’re sitting on my huge to-read pile, so I’ll try and write a post about that soon. Our next book group read is Still Alice! I’ve seen the film and had the book to read for a while so I’m looking forward to it.\n\nWhat are you reading?\n\nwarmth, r x\n\nThis was my first Zadie Smith read – shockingly I have never read White Teeth! But I bought a copy from the charity shop a month or so ago, its in my reading pile and after reading Swing Time, I can’t wait to get to it.\n\nThe Man Booker longlist has been released recently and it was no surprise to see Swing Time on there. I was quite disappointed not to see a better rating for it on Goodreads, other to be honest I don’t set a lot of stock by those ratings, after seeing some very average books rated highly.\n\nSwing Time is everything I anticipated and I can see why Zadie Smith is lauded as such a brilliant writer. It is a wonderful meditation on race, gender and class, with brilliantly cinematic writing. Swing Time is so unbelievably rich and layered that at times I couldn’t take it all in – from the narrator’s upbringing in the London housing estate, to a remote Gambian village, numerous musical references and the overarching question of identity.\n\nThe story begins in 1982 with the unnamed narrator and Tracey, two girls who meet at a dance class, their, “freckles gathered in the same areas, we were of the same height,” (Swing Time, Zadie Smith, Penguin, UK, 2016, 9), with, “a mutual awareness, an invisible band strung between us, connecting ud and preventing us from straying too deeply into relations with others.” (Smith, 16) This theme of belonging is central to the novel and it seems that no matter how far the narrator travels, Tracey is always there and she always goes back to her. The narrator herself seems to struggle with this question of identity – on their London estate, she is ‘brown’, friends with, but set apart from the white girls. In the Gambian village she is ‘white’ and doesn’t fit in entirely there. She tries to be a dancer, she becomes a goth, a consciously intellectual university student, a personal assistant to a popstar – all to find a place where she belongs.\n\nThe question of ancestry also brings to light this thorny issue of identity. The narrator travels to Kunta Kinteh Island, which used to be a slave trading post – “All paths lead back there”, her mother said, but the narrator feels that,\n\n“The world is saturated in blood. Every tribe has their blood-soaked legacy: here was mine. I waited for whatever cathartic feeling people hope to experience in such places, but I couldn’t make myself believe the pain of my tribe was uniquely gathered here, in this place, the pain was too obviously everywhere, this just happened to be where they placed the monument.” (Smith, 316)\n\nAs for the baby Aimee adopts towards the end of the book, the narrator sees her as a blank page, with no ties or baggage. What will her identity become? Will she be always connected to her birth country, Gambia, or will she become just another rich multinational, daughter of a celebrity? Or maybe she will feel closer to her various nannies of multiple ethnicities. She is very much a child of this world: many nationalities, many ethnicities and a deep rich history.\n\nLife is fluid, is the feeling you get when reading the story, and most of the characters are shown is growing and changing in some way. For the narrator, leaving home is a must for happiness, but there are other characters who cannot understand this desire to be apart and maybe this is where struggle with identity becomes worse. With the narrator, there is nothing worse than the gossipy, small-town attitude she encounters in the village, but she finds that it is perfectly enough of the people living there. I have to admit that I sympathise with her though, I too quickly feel restless. The novel shows however that the people who make that home for themselves wherever they are, are truly the ones with power. At first when the narrator sees Tracey back in her old flat, with three children and no career, she feels pity for her, but when she sees how happy Tracey is with her (to the narrator) little life, she reconsiders her ideas.\n\nIn all this however, nothing is glamorised. The respective childhoods of the narrator and Tracey are shown in great detail, with poverty, unemployment and rebellion at the forefront. And the narrator takes a scathing view of Amy’s ignorance when building a school, the obsession with ‘poverty porn’ and the habit of just pumping money into an area and leaving.\n\nI loved reading this novel – the multiple timelines threw me off a bit, but came together nicely in the end. The character descriptions were perfect (if not a little stereotypical at times), but they were so fully formed I couldn’t get them out of my head,\n\n“My mother was a feminist. She was her hair in a half-inch Afro, her skull was perfectly shaped, she never wore make up and dressed us both as plainly as possible. Hair is not essential when you look like Nefertiti. She had no need of make-up products or jewellery or expensive clothes, and in this way her financial circumstances, her politics and aesthetic were all perfectly – conveniently – matched.” (Smith, 9-10)\n\nThe narrator’s mother is brilliant by the way – for me she completely jumped off the page, even when she was acting with complete insouciance at the narrator’s dance class.\n\nAnd through all of this, there’s dance. Tap, ballet, Fred Astaire, Jeni LeGon, African tribal dances. There’s so many musical references to look up. Zadie Smith goes back to all the old black and white musicals, some of them shockingly racist and skilfully interweaves them with the present-day story. Everything changes. And nothing does.\n\n8/10\n\nWhat are you reading?\n\nwarmth, r x\n\nNext up: Hag-seed, Alias Grace and the Man Booker 2017 longlist."
