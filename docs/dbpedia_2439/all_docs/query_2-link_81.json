        "text": "Often, novice researchers have a difficult time determining the 'maiden names' of their female Sicilian or Italian ancestors. This is compounded by a lack of knowledge of the naming customs in many European lands, including Sicily and Italy. And a commonly asked question is \"Wasn't my grandmother married before she came to the U. S.? On her passenger manifest, her surname is different than that of her children.\"\n\nThe answer is simple: in Sicily and Italy, early on, the term 'maiden name' was not commonly in use. They were not used as such, and that is generally the case, even today. A woman was known, familiarly and officially, by her BIRTH surname, that is, the surname of her father.\n\nFor example, Rosa, the daughter of Leonardo Alessi, was Rosa ALESSI. When she married Gaetano Coniglio, her name remained the same: Rosa Alessi. When her first son Gaetano CONIGLIO was born, his record of birth gave his mother's name as Rosa Alessi. When she emigrated to America, the name on her Italian passport was Rosa Alessi, and she was listed by that same name, Rosa Alessi, on the passenger manifest of the ship on which she travelled, even though below name her was her son's, identified as Gaetano CONIGLIO.\n\nIf Rosa Alessi had remained in Sicily, she would have been called Rosa Alessi for her entire life. If she had died there, her record of death would have been indexed under the letter 'A' and her name would have been recorded as Rosa Alessi. The headstone on her grave would have read Rosa Alessi.\n\nIf reference to her husband's surname was necessary for some reason (say, distinguishing her from her cousin Rosa Alessi, who had married Vincenzo Abate) she would be referred to as \"Rosa Alessi in Coniglio\", meaning \"Rosa ALESSI, married to a man with the surname Coniglio\". This is converse to the American custom of saying \"Rosa Coniglio NEE Alessi\".\n\nThe great majority of the thousands of women's names the author has viewed on passenger manifests showed the women's birth surnames. That was how their visa or passports were filled out, and how they were listed on the manifests. Most that I've viewed were from the regions formerly comprised by the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, both mainland and insular, but also include others from the North of the Italic Peninsula. A woman's children travelling with her might be listed with their father's surname, or the field might be left blank. That practice has led to many cases in which modern indexers assume incorrectly that the children's surname is the same as their mother's. In some cases a woman's husband's surname may be \"penciled in\" over her surname in a different handwriting, indicating that it had been added after her arrival.\n\nOnce in America and other English-speaking countries, local custom took over, and Sicilian women became known by their husbands' surnames. Thus, in the United States, my mother went from Rosa Alessi to \"Mrs. Gaetano Coniglio\", or \"Rosa Coniglio\".\n\nRosa Alessi was my mother. Below are records of her life events, showing how her name remained unchanged, before she settled in America.\n\nMy mother didn't remain in Sicily, but her sister Maria Alessi did, and she married a man named Andrea Salvo. My Aunt Maria died in Sicily in 1974. Her headstone in the Cimiterio di Serradifalco reads \"ALESSI MARIA VED. SALVO\", meaning \"Maria Alessi, widow of [Mr.] Salvo\". An image of her headstone follows my mother's records below.\n\nKnowledge of the Sicilian custom will help to understand what seem to be inconsistencies in womens' surnames. It can also be useful in the following situation: if you know that say, your grandparent emigrated as a child with his/her mother, and you know his or her name, but not the surname of his/her mother, you can search passenger manifest lists for your known grandparent. If you locate your grandparent's manifest, on the line above their name will be the 'maiden name' of your great-grandmother! And remember, if you search for a female ancestor's or other female relative's Sicilian record of death, her record will be indexed by her birth surname.\n\n3pt"
