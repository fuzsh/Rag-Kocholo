        "text": "I read two articles this week that impacted on how I thought about the latest book from Rose Tremain.\n\nThe first was a call from Salman Rushdie to allow writers to create characters outside of their own experience. You can read it here: suffice to say that I agree with him. You cannot write (or read) about the complexities of life in a world full of diversity if these barriers are imposed on authors. My only caveat is that readers and writers should, IMO, read as widely as possible from a diversity of authors too.\n\nThe second article was from 2022: John Banville asserting in an interview that there has been a creeping retreat into infantilism. You can read it here but essentially he is concerned about two things: one is that readers don’t seem to want difficult books now.\n\nA friend said to me: “You see supposedly grownup people on the train unashamedly reading Harry Potter books; they should be reading grownup books, not children’s books!”\n\nHe makes the point that the escapism that children enjoy is one thing, but that the escape you get from art isn’t away from the world but into an infinitely wider one – into life.\n\nBanville also says that his generation tried to address the question of being:\n\nFiction writers in Ireland now seem just to be writing about their immediate lives and the lives of their friends. That wasn’t the point at all for my generation; we were interested in what people are, not what they do.\n\nWhat has any of this got to do with Rose Tremain’s latest novella? It’s the story of Marianne Clifford reflecting as the years pass on the way she nurtures her obsession with her first (failed) love. It’s gently nostalgic, and it’s (just bearably) narcissistic. It’s set in 1960s upper middle-class Chelsea, where the Windrush generation is nowhere in sight and if gays are in the closet nobody opens the doors. The characters have names like Simon and Hugo; Rowena, Cordelia and Petronella a.k.a. Pet. They have horses called Mirabelle and Marvin.\n\nNow, I like Rose Tremain’s novels. I like her interest in exploitation (The Road Home, 2007); moral dilemmas (The Gustav Sonata, 2016); intolerance (Islands of Mercy, 2020); vengeance (Lily, a Tale of Revenge, 2021); and inequity (Merivel, a Man of His Time, 2012).\n\nBut while Absolutely and Forever is a mildly interesting story that takes us back to our younger selves — that first mad passion, that first broken heart — it’s still a disappointment. Salman Rushdie’s cautionary words about limiting the palette only to what the author knows, and John Banville’s disdain for infantilism seem only too apt to me.\n\nI had some hope for the novel on pages 46-7, when Marianne recounts an episode at school. She makes a bit of an effort in history because it might be embarrassing for [Simon] to have a wife who knew nothing about the Bayeaux Tapestry or the Peterloo Massacre. She tells Miss Nelson:\n\nThe reason I like this subject is because it is safely in the past, so I don’t have to get worked up and worried about it, and she replied that she thought this was ‘a very odd and ignorant attitude to have and really not true at all.’\n\nI asked why it wasn’t true and she said, ‘History is a continuum. Think of Mrs Pankhurst. Where would we women be without those who fought for women’s suffrage?’\n\n‘I don’t know,’ I said. ‘Where would we be?’\n\n‘In the Dark Ages, Marianne. Without any power at all.’\n\nI said that I didn’t think we really had any power anyway. I told her that when Mummy exerted any power, like daring to win a Scrabble game, Daddy got into such a red rage that it was easier and more peaceful for her to keep on losing. But I could see Miss Nelson thought this was pathetic. (p.46)\n\nThe episode closes with Miss Nelson wearing the kind of despairing look people have in public places when they lose control of their screaming toddlers.\n\nGo away, Marianne,’ she said, and try to grow up and start thinking for yourself.’ (p.47)\n\nAh, I thought, Tremain is satirising those inane novels with characters who obsess over immature relationships. Maybe this is a cautionary tale about not wasting your life mooning about over Some Man. But alas, Marianne does not go away and start thinking for herself…\n\nAs usual, there are those who think differently to me. Harriet at Shiny New Books thinks that as well as being a wonderful portrayal of a young girl’s passionately deep feelings, the novel brilliantly evokes the eras in which it takes place."
