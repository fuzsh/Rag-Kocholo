        "text": "MEMOIR\n\nRosie: Scenes From a Vanished Life\n\nRose Tremain\n\nChatto & Windus, $32.99\n\nIn the afterword of this memoir of her childhood, Rose Tremain explains why she stopped being \"Rosie\": when she finally went to university in 1964 she cast it off as part of the process of asserting a new self. \"Rosie\", or Rosemary, had been a victim of her parents' selfishness and disdain.\n\nHowever, the young woman who becomes Rose discovers that by being bold, stubborn and persistent she can overcome her mother's seemingly endless ways to keep her at a distance. She recognises and claims her innate creative self, including her \"of writing\". And with about 20 books published since her first novel in 1976, that is a very real love.\n\nLove, however, is what is missing from much of her childhood. Or at least love from the expected quarters. By the end of this short memoir, the subtitle makes sense: everyone's childhood is a \"vanished life\" recuperable only by memory, but in Tremain's case there has been the conscious choice to step away from these scenes, many of them painful, in order to become someone capable not only of surviving, but of finding, receiving and giving love herself. Perhaps this explains the rather brisk pace of this memoir, the fact the author never lingers long in any of these scenes, along with the lack of bitterness or even judgement exercised upon her mother in particular.\n\nAnd some scenes are perhaps best \"vanished\", now written down and dealt with: the breakdown of her parents' marriage, their affairs within their own class and even family, her mother's coldness, her father's cruel indifference, the banishments for Tremain and her elder sister, Jo, the terrible silences and secrets.\n\nKnowing that the English middle and upper classes have a long tradition of sending their children off to boarding school doesn't make reading about Tremain's experience here any less distressing. What is remarkable is her ability to rise above the years of freezing cold and malnourishment, and to find solace, friendship and even comfort in a school that sounds straight out of Jane Eyre.\n\nThis book is full of evocative writing that brings alive the places of Tremain's childhood with sensual ease. But it is flawed by numerous irritating footnotes explaining how particular incidents or details are repurposed in her fiction. It is hard to see the point of this, considering authors scavenge stuff from their own lives all the time.\n\nRosie does read like something out of fiction, and heavy going fiction at times. Her father abandons his family to pursue an affair, remarries and never contacts his two daughters. On one occasion after much agonising Tremain invites him along to a school performance, convinced he won't appear. Miraculously, he does, but departs at interval having not spoken a word to his daughter.\n\nAt one point her mother Jane, also remarried and focused on her new husband, refuses to have her daughters in the house: when Tremain is sent home from boarding school to recover from appendicitis, Jane promptly packs her off to her former nanny.\n\nIt is this woman, Nan, who provides the life-saving maternal affection and security for both Tremain and Jo. Jane's resistance to her daughters is explained away by the facts of her own sad family life: her two beloved brothers both died, bringing such profound grief and resentment into the family that Jane herself was rejected by her mother, Mabel.\n\nAlong with Nan is another life saver in the figure of Tremain's English teacher, and the book ends with a memory of this woman who generously shared her love of literature and thus unknowingly fostered Tremain's career as a writer. So this memoir is, of course, a great deal about love, proving how the love of reading and the power of literature can rescue young people from despair and provide a basis for a lifetime of imaginative endeavour.\n\nDebra Adelaide is an author and academic; her most recent novel is The Women's Pages."
