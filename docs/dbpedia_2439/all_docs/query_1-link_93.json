        "text": "This novel, written over 30 years ago, starts in a muddy Suffolk field where a family is observing the two minute silence for the funeral of King George VI. Mary, age 6, gets a sudden revelation that ‘a mistake has been made and she’s really a boy’. It’s 1952 though and it’s 15 years before she can really tell anyone.\n\nThis is the story of Mary’s journey and the author makes that clear at the start, but it is also the story of life changes for many growing up in rural Suffolk at that time. Many have dreams – to be a country western singer, to be an Olympic swimmer, to be a dental hygienist. Some are achievable, and even those don’t actually come to pass. On the other hand, the more unlikely ones do!\n\nPenguin remarketed this novel in 2020 stressing the girl/boy theme which I found a bit cynical and I started reading with this mind set. I was quickly taken in though by the big group of fully formed characters, the strange paths people take to achieve their real selves. The devastation of growing up in such a stultifying environment – violence, mental health problems, secrets, life changing accidents, suicide – is laid bare and we hope for those trying to escape.\n\nMary’s own journey is explored in detail. The first person she finally tells the truth to is the local vicar – he immediately said she will go to Hell. She tries her doctor who says it’s because she hasn’t started her periods yet and he’ll give her some tablets to sort her out. A more philosophical neighbour, a cricket bat maker, says she was probably a man in a past life and that life hasn’t been totally erased. This is better but doesn’t really solve her problem. Finally a move to London and sympathetic friends lead her to a psychiatrist. A year later, and some rather amusing pretenses, she gets ‘the hormones’. She’s so happy to no longer have to bind her breasts but her journey is far from over.\n\nI’d heartily recommend this novel – for the writing, the characters, the setting – as well as the whole story of the hormones, surgery, emotional requirements in Mary’s journey. Many thanks to the facilitator and the other book lovers of Radical Readers – they are a joy to spend some time with.\n\nSuzanne, Brixton Library Radical Readers book group"
