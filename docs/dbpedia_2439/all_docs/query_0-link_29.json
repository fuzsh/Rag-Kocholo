        "text": "Enjoy English author, Rose Tremain’s 10 rules for writers.\n\nRose Tremain (born 2 August 1943) is an award-winning English author, and former Chancellor of the University of East Anglia.\n\nHer publications include novels and short-story collections, and she is also the author of a number of radio and television plays. She won The Orange Prize for The Road Home.\n\nRose Tremain was chosen as one of the 20 ‘Best of Young British Novelists’ by Granta in 1983, and was a judge for the Booker Prize for Fiction in 1988 and in 2000. She reviews and broadcasts regularly for press and radio.\n\nHer most recent novels include Trespass, Merival: A Man of His Time, and The Gustav Sonata. Her books are often said to ‘dramatise a moment of truth in the lives of lonely outsiders‘.\n\nShe was made a Commander of the British Empire (CBE) in 2007.\n\nRose Tremain’s 10 Rules for Writers\n\nForget the boring old dictum ‘write about what you know’. Instead, seek out an unknown yet knowable area of experience that’s going to enhance your understanding of the world and write about that.\n\nNevertheless, remember that in the particularity of your own life lies the seedcorn that will feed your imaginative work. So don’t throw it all away on autobiography. (There are quite enough writers’ memoirs out there already.)\n\nNever be satisfied with a first draft. In fact, never be satisfied with your own stuff at all, until you’re certain it’s as good as your finite powers can ­enable it to be.\n\nListen to the criticisms and preferences of your trusted ‘first readers’.\n\nWhen an idea comes, spend silent time with it. Remember Keats’s idea of Negative Capability and Kipling’s advice to ‘drift, wait and obey’. Along with your gathering of hard data, allow yourself also to dream your idea into being.\n\nIn the planning stage of a book, don’t plan the ending. It has to be earned by all that will go before it.\n\nRespect the way characters may change once they’ve got 50 pages of life in them. Revisit your plan at this stage and see whether certain things have to be altered to take account of these changes.\n\nIf you’re writing historical fiction, don’t have well-known real characters as your main protagonists. This will only create biographical unease in the readers and send them back to the history books. If you must write about real people, then do something post-modern and playful with them.\n\nLearn from cinema. Be economic with descriptions. Sort out the telling detail from the lifeless one. Write dialogue that people would actually speak.\n\nNever begin the book when you feel you want to begin it, but hold off a while longer.\n\nSource for Advice / Source for image\n\nby Amanda Patterson\n\nIf you enjoyed this, you will love:\n\n27 Gems On Writing From Ernest Hemingway\n\nBilly Wilder’s 10 Tips For Writing Screenplays\n\nColm Tóibín’s 10 Rules for Writing Fiction\n\nRoddy Doyle’s 10 Rules For Writing\n\nEsther Freud’s 7 Rules For Writing\n\nSebastian Faulks On Finding Excuses Not To Write\n\nWriting Advice From The World’s Most Famous Authors\n\nTIP: If you want help writing a book, buy The Novel Writing Exercises Workbook.\n\nPosted on: 2nd August 2019\n\n(10,057 views)"
