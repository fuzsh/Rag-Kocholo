        "meta_description": "Vingt ans après la publication de son roman Restoration, Rose Tremain revient, dans une préface de 2009, sur le choix de la période qu’elle a conçue comme un miroir des années Thatcher. Avec la Restauration, Tremain se réapproprie les traditions littéraires de la comédie de l’époque et de la satire pour dresser le portrait de son truculent narrateur, le royaliste Merivel. Etudiant en anatomie devenu courtisan et mari cocufié de la maîtresse du roi, Merivel incarne à la fois le stéréotype du « fop » de la comédie de la Restauration et l’alazon satirique. Représentant de la tradition littéraire britannique, Merivel est un homme de son temps tandis que sa carrière avortée et ses nombreux vices reflètent les idéaux et travers thatchéristes. Son énonciation naïve traduisant sa dévotion aveugle envers Charles II met également en lumière, pour le lecteur contemporain, la crise de l’autorité dont Thatcher reste l’emblème. Ainsi, le roman combine le conservatisme du genre satirique et le soupçon postmoderne envers les figures d’autorité, posant la question de l’intention comique.",

        "text": "Merivel: A Man of His Time\n\n2Merivel is a representative of the seventeenth century, ‘a man of his time’ as the title of the 2012 sequel reads. The main inspiration for the character were the diaries of Samuel Pepys. The work of the diarist provided Tremain with historical material for her narrative, including the core subject of the novel with Pepys describing Charles II’s routine of finding husbands for his mistresses to conceal his affairs while offering them titles and lands as a compensation. Merivel’s story is that of a student of anatomy turned professional cuckold through marriage to the King’s favourite, Celia, in exchange for his Bidnold manor and his status as Sir Robert. Choosing material comfort over his vocation, Merivel’s path hints at the pervading atmosphere of greed of the 1980s. His social advancement also reads as a mockery of the social mobility advocated by Thatcher. Indeed, he enters the King’s entourage by betraying his medical vocation when asked to cure the King’s favourite dog, Lou-Lou, which he achieves through neglect, by sleeping through the night in an inebriated state to find the dog recovered come morning. Merivel then becomes the King’s pet and is himself compared to a dog (78). His social upgrading is thus achieved through willing self-abasement and he then indulges in the parasitic life of an idle courtier. If Pepys with his ‘self-mockery and touching honesty about his worldly strivings’ (Tremain 2013) served as a historical reference for the characterisation of Merivel, his comic demeaning self-portrait as an ugly, greedy and vain courtier combined with the recurrent jocular animal comparisons clearly affiliate him with the satirical tradition which aims at disclosing the imposture of the parvenu figure. He is one of ‘the alazons [who] behave in a distorted way because they are incompetent impostors who pretend, out of folly or knavery, to be other than they are’ (Eden 589). The first lines of the novel forewarn the reader about the ‘Paper Bridegroom’ (30) anticipating the ludicrousness of his marriage to the pretty mistress of the king:\n\nI am an affront to neatness. My hair (what is left of it) is the colour of sand and wiry as hog’s bristles; my ears are of uneven size; my forehead is plattered with freckles; my nose, which of course my wig can’t conceal, however low I wear it, is unceremoniously flat, as if I had been hit at birth. (3)\n\n4His conversationalist tone and his status as an endearing fool whom the reader looks upon with benevolence and amusement further connect him to the Horatian satirical tradition theorised at the time by Dryden who distinguished folly and foolery as the typical target of Horace as opposed to the vices attacked by Juvenal: ‘Folly was the proper Quarry of Horace, and not Vice: And, as there are but few Notoriously Wicked Men, in comparison with a Shoal of Fools, and Fops’ (Dryden xxxvii). While Juvenalian satire aims at chastisement, Horatian satire assumes a corrective purpose on which Dryden insists by repeatedly comparing Horace’s writing to a cure. Accordingly the novel, whose protagonist is a failed physician, is structured around the repeated lapses in his career and the failure of the various remedies forced on him by the other characters to cure him of his folly. The King exiles him from Bidnold after Merivel breaks the rule of their contract and foolishly falls in love with Celia. Merivel needs to be cured of his idleness and his foolish pretentions by becoming useful again to society. By having him work at the Quaker asylum, his friend Pearce hopes to cure Merivel of his unreasonable fascination with the King and the court. But Merivel escapes with one of the patients to become a quack. The anti-hero by excellence, Merivel freely confesses to his failings and weaknesses, arousing the sympathy of the reader, and repeatedly promises to amend himself while invariably succumbing to debauchery. Interestingly enough, Tremain originally planned for her character to reform himself through retrieval of his medical vocation, in accordance with the Horatian purpose:\n\nBut what I initially envisaged in my plan for the novel’s development was that Merivel, guided by his Quaker friend, Pearce, would, by the end of the book, find the strength to free himself from his obsession with the King and the luxurious world that entraps him and return to his first vocation, medicine, without ever pining for the glitzy life that he’s lost. He would, in fact, be ‘restored’ to his former self. (Tremain 2009, xii–xiii)\n\n5The novel makes use of the conventional satirical tropes of medicine and anatomy which traditionally serve as metaphors for the satirical purpose: the dissection of the social body and the body politic is meant to provide cures for their diseases. It is the purpose, for instance, of Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy to which the novel alludes. A student of anatomy afflicted with bouts of melancholy who turns to fashion and decoration to avoid the depressive contemplation of mortality engendered by his medical knowledge, Merivel recalls Democritus Junior who writes ‘of melancholy by being busy to avoid melancholy’ (Burton 16).\n\nof what Brian McHale calls ‘the creative anachronism,’ since the psychology of the characters (identity crisis reinforced by role-play and the double perspective created by various assumptions of debatable mental states, as well as the contemporary-minded, self-aware narrative voices) is problematised at the interface between the present of the novel’s writing and the historical ages where the action is situated. (Draga-Alexandru 127)\n\nA man of his time, Merivel also turns out to be an embodiment of the 1980s.\n\nA Double Historical Novel: Restoration and the Thatcher Years\n\n7It is Tremain’s claim that Restoration has become ‘a historical novel twice over’ (Brown) with its first-person narrator standing for both a literary archetype of the seventeenth-century and a figurehead for the late 1980s. Merivel, the fool and the melancholy philosopher, is a locus of tension with his narrative voice as a meeting point between past and present accommodating the contradictory satiric impulses of chaos and order. The dubious narrative voice is what enables parallels between the two ages. Tremain clearly distinguishes her brand of historical fiction from ventriloquist practices such as Peter Ackroyd’s, affirming the subjective stance of fictional Merivel despite the intertextual debt to his literary forebears:\n\nBut there is one crucial difference: Merivel never existed, so I’m not, with him, trying to 'make the dead speak’. In these novels, the dead only speak as Merivel hears them speak. Thus, King Charles II is brought to life, not as a speaking shade, confined by historical accuracy, but as the surrogate father, friend and god Merivel perceives him to be. (Tremain 2013)\n\n8The portrayal of Charles II is instrumental in the underhand criticism of Thatcherism. While the depiction of the court with its loose manners and unrestrained revelry matches the commonly-held view of the period, the portrait of the King does not correspond to the usual perception of Charles II as the merry monarch. Instead, Merivel paints a stern figure who praises skills and individual merit as the characteristic traits which should determine a person’s place in society: ‘He repeated his theory that no man should get above himself, but know his own talents and his own degree’ (14). Thus the King endorses a set of values which closely resemble the so-called Victorian values of self-reliance Thatcher advocated to engineer social changes through economic policies.\n\n10Thus Merivel’s portrayal of the King relays Thatcherite values and allows for historical parallels between the two periods. His reverence and fascination with Charles II could also be said to mirror the appeal of Thatcher at the time: while the King defines the age as stern, Merivel describes it as ‘the Age of Possibility’ (4), mirroring the feelings in the 80s that opportunities were ripe for the taking. Once Merivel becomes a favourite courtier, he takes advantage of his position to demand bribes from his painting tutor for an introduction at court. In his estimation, money talks and buys celebrity: ‘we live in commercial times. Take it or leave it, this is the world we inhabit. And he who takes no account of this is likely to die poor and unknown’ (51). Thus the novel contrasts the Thatcherite values endorsed by the King of self-discipline and hard work and the impact of Thatcherism on society emblematised by Merivel’s career path and personality based on self-indulgence and materialistic greed: ‘The Victorian values that Thatcher sought to foster fell afoul of the unrestrained celebration of material wealth that her rule brought about. The moral society, based on decent self-interest, that Thatcher hoped to establish became the greedy society, based on coarse self-regard’ (Skidelsky).\n\nThe Leadership Crisis\n\n13His life story follows the conventional oedipal scenario of the paternal debt. In one of the five beginnings, Merivel narrates the death of his parents in a fire, after which Charles II becomes a father figure for Merivel who strives for his approbation. As Tremain herself pointed out, the portrait of Charles II is entirely dependent on Merivel’s own perception and, as such, the King is made to impersonate a symbolic father figure: ‘He has to represent three things to Merivel: he has to represent the father, who dies very early, and that’s a very important moment in the book, the father who dies in the fire, then the King himself, and all that the King represents at that time, which is so new for people. […] So the King for him becomes a kind of God-like figure’ (Menegaldo 115). Charles II in Restoration fits Freud’s mythical narrative of the Oedipal complex in Totem and Taboo with the symbolic instance of the father (the totem) emerging from the dead figure of the omnipotent primitive father (the taboo of parricide that develops after the first fundamental murder). Thus the father is all the more powerful, symbolically speaking, as he is dead—which is why a king was said to have two bodies, his physical body/his personality and the symbolic mandate he incarnated, or else why the proclamation of accession said: ‘The King is dead. Long live the King’. It is highly significant then when Merivel declares that his love for the King ‘is like the love for a dead man’ (R 304). It also accounts for the King’s predominant role in the novel in absentia. The distinction between the two bodies of the King finally explains why the personality of the King, however flawed, does not undermine his authority. The novel hinges around Merivel’s debt to the father. His rescue act at the end of the novel when he saves a woman from the Great Fire counterbalances the death of his parents at the beginning of the book. Through it, he symbolically repays the debt to his father and to the King and finds himself restored. He reintegrates Bidnold where, having become a father himself, he will raise his daughter. His path is thus emblematic of the restoration of the patriarchal order. It fits the carnivalesque atmosphere of the novel which turns the historical event of the Great Fire of London into the conventional bonfire marking the end of the celebrations and the return to order after the cleansing ritual that allows the Fool to temporarily become the King. It accounts for the feeling readers may have that the novel endorses patriarchal values and possibly Thatcherite values, which would lead to a conception of humour as conservative: a temporary reprieve that serves to consolidate power.\n\nThus Merivel, the 1st person narrator and protagonist in Restoration, repeatedly calls himself ‘the King’s fool,’ in an absolute veneration of authority that is meant to describe the state of mind of the English people when monarchy was restored after Cromwell, but which, in its excessiveness, describes rather the postmodern despair at the loss of authorities and the need to artificially create alternative ones […] his narrative discourse, willingly constructed as unreliable, constantly inviting the reader not to take it too seriously, seems rather to suggest his self-awareness that this is never going to happen, his postmodern knowledge of the fact that authority is inaccessible, simply because it doesn’t exist as absolute truth. (Draga-Alexandru 128).\n\nIt is a fact about Merivel—and about many in this age–that they do not always wish to know the truth about a thing. And when the truth is at last revealed to them they cannot entirely dismantle all fiction from it. Thus, the blackbird, will for ever in my mind have about it the aura of an Indian nightingale which species itself does not exist in all the world, but is an imaginary thing. (247)"
