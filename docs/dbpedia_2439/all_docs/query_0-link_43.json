        "text": "Why do you write?\n\nTo find out what I truly think and believe. Every novel is a new journey of discovery. It’s just a shame it has to end one day …\n\nAre you a vivid dreamer?\n\nYes. But nearly all my dreams turn around the same anxiety: being lost. Sometimes I’m in an alien city or sometimes in a wilderness, or sometimes in a banal environment like a hotel corridor or a car park, but in every case I have no idea where I’m going, or how to find true north.\n\nWhere are you happiest?"
