        "text": "THE GUN, by C. J. Chivers (Simon & Schuster, $16.) Chivers, a foreign affairs correspondent for The New York Times (and a former Marine), examines the history of the crude but devastatingly effective AK-47 — or as it is often called, after its designer, the Kalashnikov — from its use in East Germany and Hungary in the 1950s to the current conflict in Afghanistan.\n\nTRESPASS, by Rose Tremain (Norton, $14.95.) Two pairs of siblings and their twisted pasts converge in southern France in Tremain’s dark, unflinching novel. A London-based antiques dealer visits his sister and her lover, disrupting their idyll, and the dealer’s interest in a nearby country house triggers a property battle between a despairing alcoholic and his sister, who refuses to be pushed off her land.\n\nBOB DYLAN IN AMERICA, by Sean Wilentz (Anchor, $16.95.) A history professor at Princeton, Wilentz also serves as “historian-in-residence” for Dylan’s official Web site. With nuance and lucidity, he situates Dylan in a long continuum of American music, literature, religion and politics. BLUES AND CHAOS: The Music Writing of Robert Palmer, edited by Anthony DeCurtis. (Scribner, $18.) Palmer, who died in 1997 at age 52, was The Times’s chief pop music critic in the 1980s and the author of the enduring study “Deep Blues.” This anthology reflects the breadth of his journalism, featuring pieces on John Lennon, Led Zeppelin and Muddy Waters.\n\nTHE BOX: Tales From the Darkroom, by Günter Grass. Translated by Krishna Winston (Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14.95.) In this soul-searching novel, Grass writes in the voices of eight children as they record memories of their elusive father, a noted German writer, political activist and public intellectual whose life bears an uncanny resemblance to Grass’s.\n\nCARRY THE ROCK: Race, Football, and the Soul of an American City, by Jay Jennings (Rodale, $15.99.) Jennings, a veteran sportswriter and a native son of Little Rock, Ark., chronicles the Central High School football team’s 2007 season, and finds that ghosts of the bitter desegregation battle of 1957 still haunt the school and the city.\n\nWORLD AND TOWN, by Gish Jen (Vintage Contemporaries, $15.95.) Hattie Kong, the 68-year-old Chinese-American heroine of Jen’s fourth novel, lives alone in a New England mountain town, mourning her husband and best friend. Mired in “a loneliness almost beyond words,” Hattie becomes preoccupied with a troubled Cambodian family, newly installed in a trailer just down the hill from her house.\n\nMONSOON: The Indian Ocean and the Future of American Power, by Robert D. Kaplan (Random House, $17.) Blending travel writing, historical sketches and wide-ranging analysis, Kaplan argues that what he calls “the Greater Indian Ocean” — a region stretching from Indonesia to the Horn of Africa — “will demographically and strategically be a hub of the 21st-century world.”"
