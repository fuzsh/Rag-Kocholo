        "text": "A few weeks ago I had time to kill in a coffee shop and picked up Lily by Rose Tremain. This is the story of Lily Mortimer, a foundling abandoned as a baby and rescued from wolves by a timelines; first as a child, and second as a seventeen year old murderer.\n\nWe’re told early on that Lily has committed a murder, but her victim and the reasons for her crime are held back for most of the book; that reveal is built to as a climax. And if I’m being honest, I didn’t think it worked.\n\nThis story is told in dual timelines, running alongside each other: the stories of the child foundling Lily, and the seventeen year old murderer apprenticed to a wig-maker. While I love this device in other books here I found information withheld from the reader wasn’t mysterious because the context of the contrasting storyline made it fairly clear. From early on I identified who Lily was going to kill, all helped by the fact that book is subtitled A Tale of Revenge (more on that later). By structuring it this way, rather than chronologically, I felt lots of moments of potential tension didn’t have any, and the pace of ‘what will happen next’ disappeared for me.\n\nThis book made me think of Little by Edward Carey – they share a story of 1800s poverty following a young child who then grows up, although Lily covers a much shorter portion of its protagonist’s life. I really enjoyed Little‘s early sections and was thoroughly engrossed… until Marie got a little older. It can be really hard for a book to keep its momentum when following a single character from childhood into adulthood, and I wonder if the structure here was chosen to try and mitigate that. I often love dual timelines – one of my all-time favourites Fried Green Tomatoes at the Whistle Stop Café goes back and forth a lot to great effect – but here I felt it took away more than it gave.\n\nI also found that a lot of the older Lily’s narration put a big emotional distance between us and the character. At this time in her life Lily has been through a lot, and I wondered for a while if it was this I was reading in the prose, but the fact was that as the story wore on I did find this numbness wearying, especially against the raw intensity of Lily’s emotions as a child. The older Lily has motivations, hopes, fears, desires – but while she’s feeling it, they are all internalised, and I didn’t feel them in her actions. That distance also took away from the climactic murder scene because I didn’t feel she was fully there – and so neither was I.\n\nI was most interested in older Lily as an unreliable narrator. What she sees and does in Victorian London are all coloured by her traumatising experiences as a child, and she reads into other people’s actions and words in interesting ways because of it. What I was expecting or I suppose hoping for was that at some stage there would be another character who would hold up a mirror to Lily and show her – or at least confirm for the reader – that Lily’s perception of other people, of their motives, of how the world works, is not necessarily always accurate. And this would make so much sense! She’s only seventeen, and to add to that she’s escaped a lot of abuse and torment – it makes sense that her understanding of the world is warped. But this never came to pass. While I thought that Belle Prettywood and Sam Trench would both be great candidates to earn Lily’s confidence and then draw out her misunderstandings, that didn’t happen. In fact what did happen was a character confirming that all of Lily’s assumptions and daydreams about them – which to me were grim, creepy, but informed by her abuse – were in fact true. It both confused and disappointed me.\n\nThere’s a note in the back of the book about the Foundling Hospital in London, founded by Thomas Coram with noble charitable intentions. It huge numbers of children, many – most – of whom suffered in their upbringing. This book explores the way that charity went wrong in caring for these unwanted children. And I have to praise the book for this – the setting is flawlessly evoked. The time and place are brought to life seemingly effortlessly.\n\nThere was lots to enjoy in this book, including great characters and beautiful language – Tremain can describe a person very succinctly and give a sense of their whole being in just a few lines. The settings are wonderful and brilliantly drawn. But overall for me, it didn’t quite pull together to give the satisfyingly complete story I was hoping for."
