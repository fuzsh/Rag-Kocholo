McLear Pool Hall Interior, 1900 ABOUT THE MURAL ARTIST Tim moved to <strong>Lacombe</strong> in 2003 and was quickly discovered and engaged by Communities in Bloom to paint two historic murals. Everyone was delighted with the work he had done, and the community has been buzzing with excitement ever since. His genius with a paint brush and his enthusiasm for‘Painting the Town’ has only just begun. Special thanks are extended to the following building owners and sponsors: Barry Swain Barb Brown Cliff Carson Garth Wagner Robert & Terri Huff Sis Donahue Ken Jensen All In One Property Management Town of <strong>Lacombe</strong> <strong>Alberta</strong> Foundation for the Arts <strong>Lacombe</strong> Train Station, our very first mural painted in 2004 by local muralist, Tim Giles. (52 Street Mall north wall, across from the <strong>Lacombe</strong> Memorial Centre) In 1891, a railway link between Calgary and Edmonton was built through the <strong>Lacombe</strong> area. Initially referred to as Siding No. 12, the railway soon named the station after Father Albert <strong>Lacombe</strong>, an eminent Catholic missionary in Western Canada. Previous to this, growth was slow in the area and in many respects central <strong>Alberta</strong> was still wilderness and home to fur traders, missionaries and native peoples. With the arrival of the train, the fledgling community enjoyed a significant boost. By 1893, <strong>Lacombe</strong> had a population of 25 residents and the downtown district was surveyed. The train was a lifeline for those early homesteaders, and smoke on the horizon from its stack guaranteed the arrival of new neighbours and fresh supplies.
