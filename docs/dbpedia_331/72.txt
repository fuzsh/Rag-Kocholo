It’s been five years since renowned 770 CHQR sports director Billy Powers and his wife Donna-Lee were found dead in their home in the Calgary Braeside neighbourhood.

Charged with second degree murder of the Powers, Derek Puffer was found not criminally responsible for the killings on July 4, 2013.

The Alberta Review Board, which reviews Puffers’ case on a regular basis, last met on September 6, 2017 and found Puffer still to be “a significant threat to the safety of the public and isn’t entitled to an absolute discharge.”

However, the board found Puffer had “another excellent reporting period,” posing “no management problems” and seems to demonstrate “good insight into the nature and severity of his illness along with his ongoing need for treatment.”

Puffer was diagnosed with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit disorder and substance abuse disorder.

Puffer testified in court that voices in his head were commanding him to stab his parents and he had no control.

The board has said in the past he should be on anti-psychotic medication for the rest of his life. On August 28, 2017, Puffer was discharged from the Southern Alberta Forensic Psychiatry Centre to the Community Recovery Unit, living under supervision in the community.
