        "text": "This article is written by a student writer from the Her Campus at FSU chapter.\n\nAs an out-of-state student at Florida State University from New York, I’ve had to get used to a lot of things about my new state of residence. The lack of seasons is one of them. Tallahassee has a pretty varied climate compared to the rest of Florida, but to me, hot is hot. I make fun of my friends for owning puffer jackets, and you wouldn’t dare catch me ever admitting that I’m cold.\n\nFall has always been my favorite season. The colors of the leaves changing, the warm hues of the earth that seem to transfer to the air, the perfect temperatures for a light sweater, cute boots and a beanie, the anticipation of the holidays and spending time with your loved ones. If time froze and I had to pick one season to live in eternally, no question, I’d pick fall.\n\nHere in Florida, fall just does not look or feel the same as it did in New York. It’s still in the 80s every day, leaves don’t really change color or fall as noticeably and the overall idea that I have in my head about fall is completely different here.\n\nHere are some things you can do to get into the spirit of fall in the Florida heat:\n\nListen to Red by Taylor Swift (Taylor’s Version Of Course)\n\nWith iconic tracks such as “All Too Well,” Red will never fail to put you in your fall feels.\n\nGo to a Pumpkin Patch\n\nRecently, I visited Faith Presbyterian Pumpkin Patch in Tallahassee. It’s a small patch, but it’s filled with pumpkins and fun fall decorations. Get a group together, throw on some fall outfits and head to the pumpkin patch for a fall photoshoot and some quality seasonal vibes. You might as well buy a few pumpkins for some jack-o’-lantern carving, some fun recipes or even for dorm or apartment decoration.\n\nHalloween Movie Night\n\nLuckily, Halloween is a national favorite holiday and many movies have been made around it. Bring some fall snacks and have everyone wear their favorite cozy fall sweater.\n\nTake a Weekend or Day Trip to Georgia\n\nLuckily, Tallahassee is pretty close to Georgia. Temperatures are slightly lower, leaves change color and the rural fields provide crisp fall air and beautiful fall landscapes. I have also found a few apple orchards where you can go apple picking.\n\nTry an October special from The Frother’s Daughter\n\nIf you haven’t tried The Frother’s Daughter, one of Tallahassee’s favorite local coffee businesses, October is the perfect time to do so. Every month they create a variety of special lattes that match the theme of the month and are only available throughout that month. The October specials feature six delicious spooky Halloween and fall drinks that will get you even more excited for Halloween!\n\nHomesickness is a natural feeling when you are away from your family at college. Although I have adjusted to college life and consider myself settled here, the fall season brings back lots of memories and nostalgia, making me miss home a little more than usual. It’s important to make the most out of your environment and take advantage of the fun activities and the beauty Tallahassee has to offer, even though spending fall here may feel very different than spending it in your hometown."
