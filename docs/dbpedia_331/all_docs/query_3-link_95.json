He came to Prince Edward County as a youngster, living first at Huyck’s Point, later moving to Hallowell Crossing. After a short career as a Metropolitan Toronto policeman, Roy commenced work at Dupont Canada in Kingston, where he worked for 38 years. In 1965, Roy married his high school sweetheart, Margo Publow, and became the very loving father of four daughters. In September 1975, he moved his family to Bloomfield, where he painstakingly restored a fire-damaged Century home to its original beauty. Roy created a huge workshop where his artistic side blossomed and he lovingly fashioned numerous functional & beautiful pieces of furniture and toys for his family and friends. Always athletic, but limited by back injuries from a 1968 car crash, Roy whizzed around his neighborhood on his in-line skates, walked for miles, and loved supporting The Wellington Dukes. He was “Mr. Trivia” of hockey and golf, which he adopted as his favourite sport in later years. He couldn’t get enough of playing golf at Briar Fox (where he also loved working in the Pro Shop), until it closed for the season due to snowfall! Anyway, snow made it harder for Roy to find all the balls that had been left behind by other players or “lost”. In 2006, Roy enjoyed a 10 day golf holiday in Scotland, a last special time with his brother Don. Roy always had a wonderful sense of humour, a generous and loving heart and always gave a helping hand, with or without being asked. Failing health kept Roy & Margo close to home in recent years, Roy puttering in his workshop and visiting with friends. Alzheimer’s had ravaged his gentle mind, but the VON Day Program in Picton, helped to restore some of his joy and he became “Roi” (as the ultimate Habs fan) to Jan and friends there. Everyone loved Roy, and when he moved to Westlake Terrace in March 2023, he was immediately welcomed into a warm and caring environment that felt like home. Words cannot express our sincere and immense gratitude for the unparalleled, loving, respectful, and compassionate care he and his family experienced. After a tenacious effort to survive, Roy’s life journey came to an end suddenly, yet peacefully, at Westlake, surrounded by love. A life well lived and well loved. Roy leaves to mourn him, his ever-loving wife Margo, dear brother Don (Jackie of Vancouver Island), his dear sister Diane Dick (PEC) and his beloved daughters, Christina MacNaughton, Catharine (Wayne) Haggarty, Susan (Tom) Hughes, Heather (Geoff) Hart and his four beloved grandchildren Molly Russell, Daniel, Erin, and William Hart. As well, nephews Drew (Bev) Dick, Darcy (Sadaf) Dick and niece Dana (Mark) Sauer. Cremation has taken place and there will be a Celebration of Life in Spring 2024 to be announced at a later date. If desired, memorial donations can be made in his name to The Loyalist Humane Society. Arrangements in the care of the AINSWORTH FUNERAL HOME, 288 NOXON AVENUE, WELLINGTON.

Loving wife of John Greer. Caring mother of Jenny Greer and adoring Grandma to Aiden. Survived by her siblings Kathy Seebeck (Bob) and Rob McBeth (Michelle). Predeceased by her parents Mary and Don and her brother Rick McBeth. Fondly remembered by her nieces, nephews and the Greer family. Kelly was a very kind and caring person and everyone that knew her loved her. Born Kelly McBeth on October 15th, 1966 she moved to Wellington with her family in 1977 where she completed high school and then worked in Belleville and Wellington. In the early 90’s she developed a devasting disease, Eosinophilic Fasciitis, that she fought bravely for years. Despite this debilitating disease she led a full life. She raised our daughter Jennifer and kept our home going. She worked in our propane business during the day and fielded calls from our home at night. It was truly a family effort. Even after the disease kept her from going into the office, she insisted on fielding all the after-hour calls from our home. She loved dealing with the customers. She was an incredibly strong woman in the face of this disease, never complaining of pain or feeling sorry for herself, always happy. She loved animals, especially our dog Willie. Kelly was always thinking of others and helping in any way she could, even helping fellow patients when she was in the hospital. She would have made a wonderful nurse. Our daughter Jenny was her everything and when we welcomed our grandson Aiden last September, she was so excited. I truly believe his birth was the reason Kelly fought so hard to be released from the hospital last September. Despite her deteriorating health, this past year was her happiest ever, sharing it with Aiden. Special thanks to Sherri Lyons, who was Kelly’s wonderful home care nurse for the last 30 years and Doctor Nolan, a true healthcare hero who went above and beyond her call of duty. Cremation has taken place and a gathering of family and friends will be held to celebrate Kelly’s life and share a glass of Pepsi on Saturday, October 7th from 1:00 – 4:00 p.m. at her home, 285 Consecon Street, Wellington Memorial Donations to the PEC Memorial Hospital Back the Build (backthebuild.ca) would be appreciated by the family.
