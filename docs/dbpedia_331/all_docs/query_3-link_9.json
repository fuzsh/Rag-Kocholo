November 22, 1941 – July 4, 2013 POWERS, Donna Lee September 24, 1948 – July 4, 2013 The families of Billy and Donna Lee Powers are devastated to announce their tragic passing on Thursday, July 4.

Donna Lee is survived by her mother Hillevi Ruppe and brother Mark Ruppe both of Strathmore, Alberta. Billy is predeceased by his parents Mae and William Powers and his sister Elizabeth. Donna Lee is predeceased by her father Kramer Ruppe. A well-known and much loved broadcaster, Billy began his illustrious career on the police beat at the Edmonton Journal where he met and married his first wife, Carolyn Needham. Together they moved to Calgary where he worked at The Albertan. It was also at this time they became parents to James (1967) and Debbie (1968). In 1968 he joined CKXL Radio, which became home for almost 18 years. In 1988, he became the public relations and media coordinator for the Calgary Stampeder Football Club. In 1989, he joined CHQR Radio where he hosted the pre-game, half-time, and post-game shows for the Calgary Stampeders until his retirement. Donna Lee was born in Ypsilanti, Michigan, the daughter of Hillevi and Kramer Ruppe. At age 2, they moved to the family farm east of Strathmore.

Returning to Edmonton in 1979, the family grew to include Janene (1983). Two years after their divorce Donna Lee moved to Calgary where she met Billy at a fund-raising event. A whirlwind romance led to their marriage in 1989.
