        "text": "Alberta Investment Management Corp. (AIMCo) posted an overall return of 6.9 per cent in 2023, despite challenges in its real estate portfolio. The asset manager, which invests on behalf of pension, endowment, insurance, and government clients in Alberta, ended the year with $160.6 billion in assets under management.\n\nThe return, though positive, fell below AIMCo’s benchmark return of 8.7 per cent.\n\nThe real estate portfolio was down 8.4 per cent at Dec. 31, 2023, offsetting significant gains posted by public equities and fixed income, which were up 15.8 per cent and 7.7 per cent respectively. The private equity portfolio also generated a positive return, at 6.7 per cent, while renewables were up 3.5 per cent. Mortgages and private debt and loan posted positive returns of 4.5 per cent and 9.6 per cent, respectively.\n\nAIMCo took the hit to its primarily North American-focused real estate portfolio alongside other funds invested in the office segment of commercial real estate as hybrid work persisted, said Marlene Puffer, who has been the asset manager’s chief investment officer since early last year.\n\n“The valuations have suffered for more than one reason,” she said, adding that clarity around interest rates coming down — hopefully over the next quarter — could lead to more deals in the sector, in which there is often a large gap between the price a buyer is willing to pay and the amount a seller is willing to accept.\n\nPositive on Poloz\n\n“That is the dance that’s happening right now,” she said. “I think the market will settle itself out and we’ll see some significant properties change hands this year. But they’re not going to be changing hands at bottom-of-the-barrel valuations.”\n\nAIMCo’s real estate holdings are primarily located in Canada and the United States, with some in Europe and the United Kingdom. At the end of fiscal 2022, the office segment accounted for 21.3 per cent of the portfolio, with updated figures expected to be published this June.\n\nPuffer said she views it as a positive development that former Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz has been selected to lead a working group created to help the federal government identify domestic investment opportunities for pension funds in Canada.\n\n“I have a lot of faith in Stephen Poloz to lead this activity. I think he’s a very balanced, thoughtful investment and markets expert and we’ll be very pleased to work with him on this,” she said of the working group, announced in last week’s federal budget, that will focus on investment opportunities for pensions in digital and physical infrastructure, airport facilities, artificial intelligence and housing.\n\nCanada’s large, globe-trotting pension management organizations were blindsided by a section in last fall’s economic update that indicated Ottawa planned to find ways to keep more of their billions of investment dollars in Canada.\n\nAssets in Canada\n\n“There are certainly areas where discussion can, I think, be very productive,” said Puffer, who was chief executive of the division responsible for investment management of CN Pension Trust Funds and also served as vice-chair of the Board of the Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP) before joining AIMCo.\n\n“We have a lot of assets in Canada today and one of the questions is whether or not there can be additional, for example, infrastructure assets available in Canada that are attractive for us in terms of our global opportunities.”\n\nThe budget specifically mentioned airports, an infrastructure asset Canada’s largest pension managers have coveted for years. The Liberal government studied the potential of multi-billion-dollar privatizations in 2017, but the idea was ultimately shelved. Puffer said it’s too early to say whether a major Canadian airport will be put on the block.\n\n“None of us know very much about what the government has in mind at this moment so it will be interesting to see how that all evolves,” she said.\n\nAIMCo’s annualized 10-year return was 6.7 per cent at the end of the 2023. The asset manager also publishes returns for a “balanced fund” across all asset classes, which does not include clients that exclusively choose fixed income and money market investments. AIMCo’s annualized 10-year return for this balanced fund mix is 7.3 per cent.\n\nClient mandates dictate to some degree how much and how quickly portfolios can be adjusted in response to market and macro-economic conditions, Puffer said, as do some asset classes such as infrastructure, which tend to be long-term holdings.\n\nPrivate debt is an asset class where shifts are easier and AIMCo is keen to expand activity there, she said, describing “modest” deal flow from a year-long joint venture with another Canadian pension, the Public Sector Pension Investment Board. (PSP) That arrangement was forged in January 2023 when the Alberta-based asset manager snagged leveraged finance and capital markets veteran David Scudellari from PSP. Puffer said AIMCo has also been working with large global private credit players in the U.S. and Europe, where the relationships have led to a broadening of deal flow in other asset classes such as private equity — and to bigger allocations.\n\nShe singled out one recent transaction, which she identified only as “a popular one” among institutional investors, as one in which AIMCo might normally have seen its allocation cut back.\n\nBig banks, pensions likely breathing easier after Liberal budget\n\n'Dangerous' pursuit of Canada's pension billions keeps falling flat\n\nTeachers' returns disappoint as markets soar, rates hit real estate\n\n“And in this instance, we got the allocation that we asked for because of the strategic partnership activities,” she said."
