JCB.\n\nCrime\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 8, 2012, Graham Mark Sear was found dead in a silver Toyota 4Runner in an alley behind Braeside Shopping Centre plaza. Witnesses told police that they had seen two men assaulting someone inside a vehicle in a parking lot of 1990 Southland Drive SW. Police believe the incident to be a drug deal \"gone wrong\". In May 2013, police arrested Christopher Brian Richards on one count of first-degree murder. Later in November 2013, police had arrested Glen John MacIsaac on one count of first-degree murder related to the incident.[6]\n\nOn the morning of July 4, 2013, local radio-star Bill Lee Powers and his wife Donna Lee Powers were found dead at their Braeside residence at 1700 110 Avenue SW. Soon after a man in distress was arrested at the intersection of 14 Street SW and Southland Drive SW. Derek Puffer was arrested on two counts of second-degree murder.[7][8]\n\nOn March 9, 2014, two teenage boys were found with stab wounds outside of a home on 11400 Braniff Green SW. Juliano Vieira, a grade 11 student at Henry Wise Wood High School, died of his injuries on way to hospital following the incident. Roland Smith was arrested later on the same day following the incident.[9]\n\nOn June 24, 2014, an unknown man had entered a home on 600 Brookpark Drive SW at around 4 AM before proceeding to enter the victims' bedroom. The victim would find the man standing on top of her, at which point he began sexual assaulting the woman. The victim managed to kick the man off of her before running to her parents' bedroom for help.[10]\n\nOn March 11, 2021, police arrived near 10000 Brackenridge Road SW in Braeside after neighbours reported gunshots. The incident was described as a brazen daytime shooting by police and residents described five gunshots coming off from a regular gun followed by what had sounded like a machine gun going off.[11]\n\nOn June 27, 2024, a house on 499 Bracewood Crescent SW was temporarily shut down on drug related charges. Prior to the shut down, the house had 20 different police calls and two people were found dead on the property from drug overdoses. The property comes as the fifth property shut down by Alberta Sheriffs in Southern Alberta in 2024.[12][13]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of neighbourhoods in Calgary\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
