The electoral district was a continuation of the Lacombe Northwest Territories electoral district which was formed in 1902. The electoral district was named for the City of Lacombe in central Alberta.\n\nLacombe was dissolved in the 1993 electoral district re-distribution. The more urbanized portion, including the city of Lacombe, was merged with neighbouring Stettler to form Lacombe-Stettler, while the more rural portion was transferred to Rocky Mountain House.\n\nMembers of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs)\n\n[edit]\n\nMembers of the Legislative Assembly for Lacombe Assembly Years Member Party 1st 1905–1909 William F.

The government decided to consult Alberta voters to decide on liquor sales and mixed drinking after a divisive debate in the Legislature. The plebiscite was intended to deal with the growing demand for reforming antiquated liquor control laws.[3]\n\nThe plebiscite was conducted in two parts. Question A, asked in all districts, asked the voters if the sale of liquor should be expanded in Alberta, while Question B, asked in a handful of districts within the corporate limits of Calgary and Edmonton, asked if men and women were allowed to drink together in establishments.[2]\n\nProvince wide Question A of the plebiscite passed in 33 of the 50 districts while Question B passed in all five districts. Lacombe voted against the proposal by a wide margin. The voter turnout in the district was well above the province wide average of 46% with well over half the electors turning out to vote.[2]\n\nOfficial district returns were released to the public on December 31, 1957.[2] The Social Credit government in power at the time did not consider the results binding.[4] However the results of the vote led the government to repeal all existing liquor legislation and introduce an entirely new Liquor Act.[5]\n\nMunicipal districts lying inside electoral districts that voted against the plebiscite such as Lacombe were designated Local Option Zones by the Alberta Liquor Control Board and considered effective dry zones, business owners that wanted a license had to petition for a binding municipal plebiscite in order to be granted a license.[6]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of Alberta provincial electoral districts\n\nLacombe, Alberta, a city in central Alberta\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nFurther reading\n\n[edit]\n\nOffice of the Chief Electoral Officer; Legislative Assembly Office (2006).
