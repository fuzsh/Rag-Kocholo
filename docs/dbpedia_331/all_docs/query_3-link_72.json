        "text": "With a gracious nod to nature’s strength and beauty, Canada Goose and Cole Sprouse have teamed up once again for the brand’s Fall/Winter 2022 campaign. Following the roaring success from their previous Spring 2022 partnership, Spouse enlivens the brand’s latest “Live in the Open” campaign – paying homage to those who have traversed the lands before us, encouraging everyone to venture to new heights. Inspired by the natural elements, open skies, vast mountains, and pure air, this season’s collection features colors like Jasper Green, Ozone Blue, Black, Atlantic Navy, and Silverbirch.\n\nDirected and photographed in Western Canada by photographer and actor Cole Sprouse, the campaign pays kudos and celebrates mother nature’s effervescent beauty, natural elements, and evolution. Through digital and analogue cameras, Sprouse captures the richness of the environment and all its natural charm, as well as illuminating the vibrant colors present in the brand’s latest collection.\n\n“It’s always been about how we choose to live and interact with our environment. Far gone are the days of man versus nature, the biggest challenge of our generation is learning how we can live in harmony alongside it. It’s only fitting that Canada Goose, with its lineage so firmly entrenched in the Canadian wilderness, retreats to the Canadian Rockies for its Fall/Winter Live in the Open campaign. I’m thrilled to partner with the brand again and capture this campaign that celebrates the beauty of nature in all its honesty,” says Sprouse.\n\nRooted in nature’s depths and beauty, it only makes sense that the campaign would be nestled amongst snow-capped mountains, icy blue rivers, and extraordinary landscapes, and the inland experience of the Canadian Rocky Mountains of Alberta. Underscored by Canada Goose’s ethos of “Live in the Open,” the campaign draws inspiration from its Basecamp community that aims to encourage forging deeper connections with the natural world and with each other.\n\nWith Canada Goose’s Spring 2022 campaign celebrating the power and value of a tight-knit community, the brand reunited the exact same crew to bring this latest Fall/Winter campaign to life. Everyone from styling to makeup to photography assistants set out to “Live in the Open” in a colder region and were kept warm in the brand’s newest collection, allowing them to truly embrace the elements and focus on their tasks at hand.\n\nThis Fall, the brand is expanding its collection with the launch of the Cypress and Crofton Fold-Down Puffer Boots. With a Thermal Experience Index (TEI) rating of 2, the boots can withstand temperatures of up to -15°C, offering lightweight protection and versatility in styling and comfort. It can be customized with the drawcord and fold-down design, allowing you to keep it up for height, coverage, and warmth, or fold it down and reveal the Canada Goose Wordmark, adding visibility in low light conditions and allowing for even more personalized styling.\n\nThe campaign features an updated selection of lightweight pieces and apparel designed for layering up or down, allowing for individual styling and self-expression. Ideal winter companions, the Cypress Puffer and Crofton Puffer, take warmth and volume to the next level. Crafted with Recycled Feather-Light-Ripstop fabric, both puffer jackets are packable into their interior pocket and easy to stash away on the go.\n\nThe Muskoka Hoody, the Muskoka and Huron Crewnecks, and the Muskoka and Huron Pants were designed for all-day comfort and softness. Canada Goose apparel and outerwear are meant to be worn together from crisp, cool nights to road trips and beyond."
