        "text": "Derek Puffer Derek Puffer told police he had been hearing voices and music in his head for a week before they told him to kill stepfather Billy Powers and mother Donna Lee Powers, then go to work naked.\n\nHe said in an interview with Det. Trish Allen on July 4, 2013, played at his trial on Monday, that he did not know why he was supposed to kill his parents and that he had nothing against his stepfather, a popular sports icon in Calgary for decades.\n\nPuffer said he had not slept for three days before the slayings at the family’s Braeside southwest home and was “dead tired from the last week, just from the music playing over and over again.”\n\n“I can’t … like I just went in there after getting instructions and just (holding his hands out) stabbed them and I can’t remember them going, ‘no,’ and I don’t know why I didn’t stop. I was like in a trance …” Puffer told Allen. “I can’t even … I can … it doesn’t even register that I’ve killed them …\n\n“I usually go to bed on time and early. And there was no fight or anything between Bill or I. Uh, we never had arguments … I don’t have anything against him.”\n\nPuffer, 40 said in the interview “I think it was mind control or something” and he didn’t know why he did it. “They (voices) just told me to go in there and just do it … this took all night, ‘cause I was afraid of dying myself.”\n\nWhen asked by the detective if his mom and Bill deserved what happened to them, he replied: “No way. This is very hard, ya know.”\n\nHe earlier pleaded not guilty through lawyer Alain Hepner to two counts of second-degree murder.\n\nHowever, the grisly facts of the murder are contained in an agreed statement of facts and lead Crown prosecutor Jonathan Hak said the only issue at trial is whether he was not criminally responsible at the time of the slayings because of a mental disorder.\n\nHak said in reading the agreed statement of facts that Billy Powers, 71, sustained nine stab wounds and Donna Lee Powers, 64, was stabbed 16 times in the vicious attack in their beds. Both had mortal wounds to the heart from the kitchen knife that had a 19.5-centimetre-long blade and was found near a bus shelter after he was arrested.\n\nPuffer showed no emotion in the prisoner’s box as Hak on Monday described the grisly, blood-covered scene.\n\nThe police officer who arrested Puffer naked at a bus shelter at 14th St. and Southland Drive S.W. that morning testified that the accused seemed emotionally calm, “If I could use the expression ‘cool as a cucumber,’” Const. Michael Green told co-Crown prosecutor Tiffany Dwyer.\n\nGreen said Puffer told him spontaneously that “I killed my mother and stepfather.”\n\nEn route to the police district office, Green said Puffer told him, “I’ve been hearing voices, “did you find the knife,” “they’re in the bedroom” and “they put a chip in my brain.”,\n\nGreen’s partner, Const. Nick Psofimas, got the same impression: “He was calm, completely opposite of what I’d expect from a naked man arrested for murder at 5:15 a.m.”\n\nPsofimas said Puffer told him he had been suffering from schizophrenia since 1995, had not been treated and had a “chip on my brain.” He also said he had not slept for three days.\n\nBoth officers told Hepner under cross-examination that his client was displaying automaton behaviour.\n\nHak said Billy Powers had spoken to a friend, James Maloney, the day before the murders and asked Maloney if he could give Puffer a job at his business. He said Puffer had been living at his home on and off for several years.\n\n“Powers said Puffer was a hard worker but was ‘crazy’ and that while he seemed nice, Puffer was ‘out there,’” Hak told Court of Queen’s Bench Justice Kristine Eidsvik.\n\nCity police Det. Spencer Frizzell, who spoke to Puffer after his arrest, said the accused “seemed to be emotionally upset, coming to terms with what occurred. At the time, his thought process was disjointed.”\n\nThe hearing continues.\n\ndslade@calgaryherald.com\n\nTwitter.com/heraldcourt"
