He reveals that Moriarty was created by Watson so that he could \"kill off\" Holmes after a falling out. The events of this story took place after that.\n\nAt the home of blind pianist, Susan Lowell, and her father, Holmes wraps up a case involving Thugs and a statue of Kali. He invites his cousin Vernier, to accompany him to Paris, where he has been summoned to investigate the ghost that is haunting the Opera House. On arrival, they are told of the problems that have beset the Opera since a box, traditionally reserved for the Phantom, has been put back into use. Comte de Chagny hires Holmes to find out young singer Christine's intentions towards his brother, who also consults him over a voice he has heard in Christine's dressing-room. Holmes receives a warning note from the Phantom. He and Vernier tour the Opera, then travel to Brittany with Raoul, where Christine is visiting her father's grave. The Phantom follows.\n\nWhen the Opera managers refuse to bow to the Phantom's demands that Christine should sing Marguerite in Faust, the Phantom causes the chandelier to fall into the audience during the performance. Christine disappears, but a note to Raoul promises a meeting at the Opera Masked Ball, where the Phantom makes an appearance as the Red Death. Holmes and Vernier venture from the heights of the towers of Notre Dame to the depths of the cellars beneath the Opera and up again to its rooftops in search of the Phantom. Watson sends Toby to assist in the hunt, leading to a confrontation in the Phantom's cellar home, traps, and an explosion.

A few weeks later, the Enterprise is ordered to transport a group of ambassadors to the Neutral Zone for dÃ©tente talks with the Romulans. The atmosphere aboard the ship becomes very tense, among the crew and the ambassadors, and one of the ambassadors is found dead.\n\nAfter a second ambassador is found dead, Kirk is informed that the Angel of Death has been seen aboard the ship.

The Emperor Pedro II visits Sarah Bernhardt's dressing room after a performance and tells her of a stolen Stradivarius, a gift from him to the Baroness of AvarÃ©. Bernhardt recommends her friend Holmes to investigate the theft. A second victim, a maid at the royal palace is murdered after receiving Bernhardt's autograph. Bernhardt is later called to the police station to make a statement, as a fellow actress has accused her of assault. Inspector Pimento shows her the card bearing her autograph found in the second victim's hand. She recommends Holmes to him, too. Arriving in Rio, Holmes learns the history of the violin from the Emperor, and questions the Countess.\n\nWhen the killer strikes a third time, Holmes is luckily on hand to answer the victim's cries for help. He pursues the killer into the National Library, where he escapes by leaping through a window. Holmes falls for the woman he has saved, Anna CandelÃ¡ria, and traces her to the Santana Theatre where she is performing in the revue The Woman-Man. Another victim is butchered, and Holmes and Pimento visit the Dom Pedro II Asylum, where they are taken to see the cannibal, Dr. Aderbal CÃ¢mara, who points them towards the city of PetrÃ³polis, where they attend a concert, Holmes entering into a violin duel with the Marquis of Salles. A further, misguided search for clues leads them to the racecourse, but the murderer is already focusing in on his final victim.\n\nEn route to Bernhardt's final performance in Rio, Holmes and Watson are called to a Yoruba ritual, where Watson, possessed by a female demon, reveals that they already know the murderer. The demon, however, refuses to reveal his identity. The murderer claims his final victim, the Countess of AlvarÃ©, but remains uncaught, sailing to England on the same ship as Holmes and Watson, there to become Jack The Ripper. Dom Pedro II presents Holmes with the stolen Stradivarius, which has been left by the murderer in Holmes's hotel room.\n\nNOTE: Some of the characters I have listed under \"Other Characters\" may be historical figures I have been unable to track down.\n\nNOTE 2: The tarot-reading character, Mercedes Leal, is named after Soares' mother.\n\nNOTE 3: The character Dr. Aderbal CÃ¢mara (\"Aderbal the Cannibal\") is a parody of Hannibal Lecter.\n\nTish Sommers\n\nA Bird's Best Friend (1986)\n\nStory Type: Children's Story\n\nSherlockian Detectives: Sherlock Hemlock & Watson\n\nFictional Characters: Big Bird; Granny Bird; Barkley; Oscar the Grouch; Slimey; Telly Monster; Bert; Ernie; Prairie Dawn; Herry Monster; Maria; Cookie Monster; (Mr Hooper)\n\nOther Characters: Rustler; Perrito Locations: USA; Sesame Street; Big Bird's Nest; The Park; Bert & Ernie's Apartment\n\nStory: Granny Bird gives Big Bird a puppy, which he names Barkley.
