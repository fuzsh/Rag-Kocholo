        "text": "There’s something about the Tour Divide that brings the bikepacking community together. Maybe it’s because so many people participate, traveling from all over the world to ride the iconic route between Alberta and New Mexico. Or maybe it’s because of the mix of racers, riders, and tourers all enjoying the 2,750-mile route in their own way. There’s certainly a shared sense of accomplishment among those who show up for the grand depart, and we’re excited to follow along each year.\n\nContinuing on from yesterday’s post, in which we shared more than 50 loaded drop-bar bikes planning to tackle this year’s Tour Divide, we’re thrilled to present the second part of our extensive roundup. This time around, we’re highlighting more than 60 flat-bar rigs that will be lined up for the grand depart tomorrow morning in Banff, Alberta, Canada. Browse all the rigs below, featuring bag and gear highlights for each. And when the event kicks off, you’ll be able to follow along live over on our 2023 Tour Divide Tracker.\n\nTim Allan\n\nAge 55 / Christchurch (New Zealand)\n\nBIKE: Riding in from Jasper prior to the Grand Depart, I’ll be riding (not racing) the Tour Divide on a 2019 SWorks Epic Evo. Set up for comfort, my bike features 120mm full suspension, vibration dampening Passchier handlebars (bamboo laminate bar made locally in Christchurch, NZ), Ergon grips, Vision aero bars, Brooks C17 saddle, Vittoria Mezcal 2.25′ tyres and XTR 1×12 drivetrain with a 30T chainring.\n\nBAGS: Apart from the custom Stealth frame bag (made in Wellington, NZ), I am using standard Revelate bags including Spinelock seat pack, Sweet Roll, Feedbags(2), Mag Tank and Jerry Can. Rounding out my set-up is a Zefal keg mounted on the bottom tube and two standard bottle cages on the forks for more water bottles.\n\nGEAR HIGHLIGHTS: I will be equiped for camping and dining under the stars, but generally aiming for more bear proof lodgings with beer flavoured carbohydrates. All my gear is off-the-shelf apart from a couple of pockets sewn into my shirt and some over-mitts made up from a scrap of left-over waterproof fabric. An interesting bit of gear is my Ledlenser 5,000mAh battery bank. It is built around a standard 21700 battery which is removable. This means I can swap with my headlight batteries and spare batteries to ensure I have power where I need it. For navigation I will be using the sun with a Garmin for back-up. I’ve got my fingers crossed and a horseshoe out front to catch the luck!\n\nRob Adams\n\nAge 67/ Boise, Idaho (USA)\n\nBIKE: Open One+ hardtail. The bike features a new pair of Vittoria Mezcal 2.25” tires, a 1×12 SRAM drivetrain with a 28T chainring, Whiskey rims with an Industry Nine rear hub with a SON Dynamo hub up front with a Sinewave light. Redshift suspension seat post with a Selle Anatomical saddle.\n\nBAGS: Frame bag, Mountain Feed bags (2), Mag Tank 2000 and Jerry Can are all Revelate. New this run is a custom FBJ Creations aerobar bag and Tailfin AeroPack.\n\nGEAR HIGHLIGHTS: Garmin 1030+. New this trip is an Outbound Lighting Hangover helmet light. Most excited about the Tailfin AeroPack which eliminates two dry bags, one on my handlebars and one on the seat.\n\nRich Baty\n\nAge 52 / Coromandel (New Zealand)\n\nBIKE: ‘Elevensies’ is a 2017 Trek 1120 built for comfort rather than speed, which will hopefully translate to speed in the final stages of the race. 32T x 11-51T groupset, experience says “it’s better to be looking at climbing gears than looking for them”\n\nBAGS: 1120 front rack carrying ‘The Boot’, a modified Cedaero for on-the-go access to food, rain coat, food, gloves, food, etc. Revelate Mag Tank for more food. Revelate Tangle frame bag with a Hydrapak 3 litre bladder. Modified Trek dry bag cradles on 1120 rack, these keep the weight down low and allow me to run a dropper post.\n\nGEAR HIGHLIGHTS: The Lazy Camper setup, Nemo Switchback sleeping pad. MacPac Alpine Cocoon bivvy, Sea To Summit Ember quilt, and bag liner. SON dynamo hub/K-Lite lights and USB splitter. Garmin 1040 GPS. Luxury must haves: Inflatable pillow. Brooks B17 Imperial captain’s chair. NZO Sifters (baggies) and Cruiseliners.\n\nDaniel Bijan Connell\n\nAge 27 / Goleta, California (USA)\n\nBIKE: I’ll be riding my Rodeo Labs Flaanimal 5.0 rolling on a Rodeo 2.0 wheelset. Sram AXS drivetrain (36t chainring, 10-50t 12 speed cassette), Hope Tech4 X2 brakes, and Maxxis Ikon 2.0″ / Vittoria Mezcal 2.1″ tires.\n\nBAGS: Tailfin Carbon Aeropack, Class 4 Designs frame bag, Dispersed hip pack, and an Evoc Hydration Vest will carry the bulk of my goodies.\n\nGEAR HIGHLIGHTS: I’ll be navigating the course and tracking all sorts of data with my Coros Vertix 2 smartwatch. Stuffed into the deep crevices of my bags will be a handful of emergency Range Meal bars, each one packed with 700 calories. I have 4 liters of milk carrying capacity. Luxury sleep kit items include a pillow and down booties. Body comfort will be handled with the Voler Superbib / Brooks Saddle killer combo.\n\nSteve Briley\n\nAge 58 / Moab, Utah (USA)\n\nBIKE: I will be riding a Chumba Stella Ti with Enve fork. Mezcal 2.2″ tires. Drivetrain is SRAM Xo1. 32T chainring with 10-50T cassette.\n\nBAGS: Frame bag is Rockgeist. Revelate seatbag and Pronghorn up front.\n\nGEAR HIGHLIGHTS: Gossamer Gear one for tent, Enlightened quilt along with some Spider-Man underwear.\n\nGail Brown\n\nAge 32 / Bristol (United Kingdom)\n\nBIKE: I’m riding a Scott Scale 930 with Shimano XT-Deore groupset 32T chainring and 10-51T cassette.
