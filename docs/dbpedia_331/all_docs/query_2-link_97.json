        "text": "Minecraft is a massive game, and by massive we do not just mean that the world size is incredibly big, but also the possibilities of doing different things. From starting an animal farm, growing crops, and trading with villagers to exploring the depths of the underworld or fighting dragons, Minecraft lets players do whatever they want to, however, they want to. From fighting mobs and pillagers to building railroad networks for efficient mining, this wide range of possibilities can sometimes lead to a fair bit of confusion.\n\nNote: This article is subjective and reflects the opinions of the writer.\n\nMost confusing things in Minecraft\n\nNo matter how long one has played Minecraft, some confusing things about the game can never be explained or resolved. So in this article, we decided to list down the five most confusing things in the game that are just there. So let’s get started.\n\n1) Giant saw blade\n\nOut of all the different blocks in the game, the stonecutter block is perhaps the most confusing. It is exclusively used for cutting stone and turning stone blocks into stone slabs, which makes no sense as the same can be done using the crafting table. So this block just adds an extra step. But that’s not the only confusing part.\n\nIt is interesting how the player can get damage by walking through sweet berry bushes and yet can stand on the giant saw blade without taking any damage. It seems like the addition of the stonecutter was just an afterthought.\n\n2) Fishing makes no sense\n\nFishing is a mechanic in the game and also a very important activity. Not only can players catch fish which is a source of food, but fishing also gives important items such as the puffer fish needed for potions and some enchantment books. But here’s the confusing part; players cannot catch the fish that are visible.\n\nFor some reason, the fish that are caught in the fishing rod are never visible. What’s more confusing is that one would be able to see the fish swimming near the fishing line and yet, some other fish would get caught.\n\n3) Cobwebs vs Trees\n\nThere are spiders and cobwebs in Minecraft and if not careful, players can get stuck in the cobwebs. One can remove them using a sword but they can also be removed with just the hands, although it takes a lot of time to do so. But here’s the confusing and quite hilarious part; it takes less time for the player to chop down wood with their hands than to remove cobwebs.\n\nThis sounds utterly confusing; wood is much harder and denser than mere cobwebs and yet, players would require a lot of effort to remove cobwebs compared to just chopping down wood.\n\n4) Go up in a waterfall\n\nWaterfall is only possible when the entire weight of water is falling. This force works well when the water is spreading on the ground, pushing players away from it. But interestingly, and quite confusingly, players can just climb up by standing under a waterfall. This makes zero sense. Not only that, but this has become one of the game mechanics and players use it as a water elevator.\n\n5) Cows never run out of milk\n\nAll the Minecraft players who have farmed animals would have noted it and found it weird that cows never run out of milk. This is unlike sheep, which when sheared, take some time to grow back their wool so that it can be sheared again. But cows are some other animal altogether. Players can just take a bucket and keep milking the cow as many times as possible with no cool-down time."
