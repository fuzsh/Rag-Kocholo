        "text": "A memorial service honoring the life of Joe Bill Gamble will be held at 3:00 p.m. Thursday, March 16, 2023, at the VFW Hunter-Rickerson Post #2885. The post is located at 232 Horseshoe Loop, Doyline, Louisiana 71023. Jared Pickett will officiate the Service.\n\nJoe Bill was born December 7, 1954, in Natchitoches, Louisiana to Cloy G. and Ruth V. Gamble, and passed away peacefully at his home in Minden, Louisiana on Monday, March 6, 2023. The family requests that you please participate in the celebration of life by sharing your favorite stories and memories of Joe.\n\nJoe was preceded in death by his mother, Ruth V. Gamble of Bossier City; his father, Cloy G. Gamble of Minden; his brother, Richard A. Wallesverd of Shreveport, Louisiana; his Grandparents Wesley G. and Loyce Green Gamble of Minden, Louisiana and Elizabeth Vermillion Antes of San Antonio, Texas; and a very special Aunt, Estelle Harris of Minden.\n\nLeft to cherish his memory are his wife, Angela Nickson Gamble of Minden; his daughters, Carrie Gamble Puffer and her husband Shawn of Benton; Heather Gamble of Shreveport; and Kristal Rouleau Adams and her husband Daniel of Sibley; son, Leigh Rouleau and his wife Regine, La Tuque, of Quebec, Canada and his bonus son, Donald Roberson and his wife Pamela of Minden. He is also survived by his step-mother, Shirley T. Gamble of Minden; sisters, Amy G. Cochran and husband Carl; and Cindy G. Harris and husband, Brian, all of Bossier City; Sister in Law, Home Wallesverd of Minden. Joe is also survived by his grandchildren, Katelynn Bowers and fiancé, Brian Chelette of Minden; Zoe Adams of Sibley; Spencer Montelbano of Shreveport; and Alexis, Austin, Taylor and Breanna Roberson of Minden; Great-grandson, Braxton Chelette of Minden; and, his first wife and long-time friend, Lesa Hamilton of Benton. Joe was also blessed with numerous step siblings, nieces, nephews, cousins and extended family who were all special to him.\n\nIt must be said that Joe also counted as family a multitude of football players that he coached over the years, both high school and semi-professional, whom he developed a special bond with, including the most recent football team and staff at Glenbrook School, to whom the family would like to extend their gratitude for their constant companionship, thoughts and prayers during his recent health challenges.\n\nJoe was a proud veteran of the United States Army and the Louisiana National Guard. He was most recently self-employed (retired) as owner of Economy Tree Service in Minden, Louisiana. He also maintained a teaching certificate and prior to starting his tree service, was employed as a high school teacher. He lived an adventuresome life and could always be found where the “fun is” or where he could partake in karaoke, singing his heart out.\n\nThe family would also like to extend a special thank you to the doctors and staff at the Overton Brooks VA Hospital for their care over the last several years.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, it was Joe’s request that you please consider making a donation to:\n\nAmerican Indian College Fund, Denver, Colorado (1-800-776-FUND) collegefund.org\n\nor The American Diabetes Association, Merrifield, Virginia (1-800-Diabetes) diabetes.org"
