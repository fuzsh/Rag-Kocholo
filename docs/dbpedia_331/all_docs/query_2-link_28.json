        "text": "\"This is a mountainous township at the north-east corner of the county, and the line of Canada, and watered by Missisco River and its branches. There is some good land along the river; and the upland, though rough, affords good grazing . . . The settlement was commenced in 1797; the town was organized in 1799.\"\n\nGazetteer of Vermont, Hayward, 1840.\n\nHISTORY OF THE TOWN OF\n\nRICHFORD\n\nBY REV. JAY POWELL.\n\nTHE CHARTER\n\n\"The Governor's Council and General Assembly, and Representatives of the freemen of Vermont, to all persons to whom these presents shall come -- greeting:\n\nKnow ye that, whereas, it has been represented to us by our worthy friends, Jonathan WELLS, Esq., and company to the number of sixty -- that there is a tract of vacant land within this state which has not been heretofore granted, which they pray may be granted to them, we have, therefore, thought fit for the due encouragement of settling a new Plantation within this estate and other valuable considerations us hereunto moving; and do by these presents in the name and by the authority of the freemen of Vermont give and grant unto the said Jonathan WELLS, Esq. and the several persons hereafter named as his associates, viz* [*Names of grantees not received in time for insertion.]\n\nTogether with five equal shares to be appropriated to public uses as follows -- viz: one share for the use of a Seminary or College within the State, one share for the use of the county grammar schools, Schools throughout this State; one share for the first settled minister of the gospel in said town, to be disposed of for that purpose as the inhabitants thereof shall direct; one share for the support of the ministry; and one share for the benefit and support of a school or schools within said town. The following tract or parcel of land, viz: Beginning at the north east corner of the township of Berkshire being in the north line of this State, then east in said line six miles; then southerly on such point as to gain six miles on a perpendicular from said line of this state; then west parallel with said State-line to the south-easterly corner of said Berkshire ; then northerly in the easterly line of said Berkshire, to the bounds begun at, will contain the contents of six miles square and no more. And that the same be and is hereby, Incorporated into a Township by the name of Richford and the inhabitants that do or shall hereafter inhabit the said township are declared to be enfranchised or entitled to all the privileges and immunities that other towns in this state do by law exercise and enjoy:\n\nTo have and to hold the same granted premises as above expressed, with all the privileges and Imprimis; that each proprietor of the township of Richford aforesaid, his heirs or assigns, shall plant and cultivate five acres of land and build a house at least eighteen feet square on the floor, or have one family settled on each respective right or share of land in said township, within the term of four years next after the circumstances of the war will admit of settlement with safety, on the penalty of the forfeiture of his grant or share of land in said town; and the same to revert to the freemen of the State to be by their representatives regranted to such persons as shall appear to settle and cultivate the same.\n\nSecundo: That all fine timber suitable for a navy be reserved to the use and benefit of the freemen of this State.\n\nIn testimony whereof we have caused the Seal of this State to be affixed this 21st day of August, A. D. 1780, and in the fourth year of the Independence of this State, and 5th of the United States.\n\nTHOMAS CHITTENDEN,\n\nJoseph Fay, Sec'y.\"\n\nThis township which lies in the northern part of the State, upon the Canada lane, is described in the charter to contain 6 miles square, and no more; but surveyed by General WHITELAW of Ryegate, in 1795, who ran the town lines, and most of the ranges north and south, making corners from measurement, the south line varies from the charter, in following Montgomery line to the Corner, which is some 150 rods south of Berkshire corner, thus making more than 6 miles square; but the surface is uneven and mountainous, and this township has not as much arable land as many others of the same size; not more than three-fourths of it perhaps being fit for agricultural purposes, the remainder is valuable only for the timber which grows upon it. Yet, as a whole, the town is well calculated for farming. Its soil differs in different places. It contains nearly all kinds, clay, loam, muck, with a little sand and gravel, and is mostly rich and productive, although little grain is raised. The farmers give their attention mostly to raising cattle, and making butter and cheese, for which the town is favorably adapted.\n\nThe hill-sides abounding in springs of water, are well calculated for pasturage, as they seldom suffer from drought. The intervales and flat land, yield usually a large growth of hay, and are reserved for meadows.\n\nThere are several small streams of water that flow from the mountains in the north-easterly part of the town, on which there are numerous saw-mills, besides those on the Missisquoi. The timber is hemlock, spruce, beech, birch, bass-wood, ash and maple, from which a large amount of sugar is usually made.\n\nFIRST SETTLERS\n\nHugh MILLER and his wife, with 8 children and 3 sons-in-law, came from Bradford, Vt., in March 1795, by some wilderness route, and found their way to Richford. They commenced on Missisquoi river, on the flat about 2 miles above the present village, in a wilderness where there were no neighbors except wild beasts.\n\nThey arrived there in March, and the weather was so severe that it was necessary to erect some shelter without delay; they cleared a small patch of ground, left four blue beech staddles standing, for corners, withed on poles, covered with boughs and blankets, and probably carpeted the cold ground with the smaller boughs of the hemlock. Such was their camp.\n\nTheir sons-in-law were Theophilus HASTINGS, Robert KENNEDY, and Capt. Benjamin BARNET, who married the three oldest girls, Hannah, Catherine and Amy. The other children were three young men, James, Jacob and Daniel, and two younger girls, Mary Ann and Ruth. Their camp was soon exchanged for log-houses, with bark roofs, split basswood for floors and doors, and skins grained for windows.\n\nWild game, such as moose, deer, and bears were plenty, and the rivers furnished an abundance of fish, beaver, otter and other game. The deer were easily caught in the winter. Deep snow would drive them into yards where there was plenty of browse. The hunter, taking advantage of the crust would soon secure abundance of them.\n\nThe first settlers slashed down the trees and trimmed off the limbs, and in a dry time would set fires which would burn up the brush and small stuff. They would then plant their corn among the logs, and usually raised good crops this way. But no roads and no mills being near, they pounded their corn in a samp mortar made by burning out a hollow in the end of a log, and, with a spring-pole and pestle, pounded out their bread.\n\nThe Indians were hunting along the Missisquoi river and mountains in winter, where moose, door and boars were plenty. They would freeze their meat, and in the spring would pass down the river into Lake Champlain and Sorel river to Caughnawaga to market.\n\nJames MILLER, sometime later, settled in Canada, about 3 miles up the river, on the place now known as the \"Bickford farm.\" Jacob married Saloma NUTTING, daughter of Capt. NUTTING of Berkshire, and lived and died in this town. Daniel married Anna POWELL, daughter of Rowland POWELL. He was Custom House Officer, and had an affray at Hyde Park, in 1810, from the effects of which be died, leaving a widow and 5 small children -- Patty, Anna, Fanny, Madison and Marvin, all of whom are living except Madison. Capt. BARNET and Robert KENNEDY moved to Canada about the time of the war of 1812.\n\nHugh MILLER, on hearing of the death of Daniel had a shock of paralysis, and lived but 20 days. He was buried on the hill near where he lived and died.\n\nTheophilus HASTINGS, a strong and useful man, died with the nose-bleed, at the seaside, leaving a widow and several small children, in destitute circumstances. Seymor, son of Theophilus, was the first child born in town.\n\nMrs. Hugh MILLER was a Christian woman. She possessed great courage and endurance. She was a doctress, and performed services beyond her own family. She has traveled on snow-shoes, through deep snows in winter, by marked trees six or seven miles to Trout river, in a midwifery case. On another occasion she was called to visit the wife of William LEBARRON, who lived on lot No. 56, near South Richford. It was an extreme case, no doctor being near for counsel, her anxiety and responsibility was great, and when deliverance came, she knelt down and thanked Almighty God.\n\nC.M. DAVIS says, when a boy, he, with others, went to the river bank, to see her with Edward LADD, whom she accompanied, safe over, the night being very dark, and rainy, with heavy thunder and lightning, and the river swollen, and they had scarcely reached the opposite shore when the lightning struck a large hemlock and stove it into slivers. They were uninjured, although they had but a moment before passed the tree. Much more might be said of this good woman. She had no privilege of meetings for about 7 years.\n\nIn 1802, Bishop HEDDING, that pioneer of Methodism, then a young man on the Fletcher circuit, following the trail of the early emigrants, by marked trees, and hunting up the lost sheep of the house of Israel, preached the first sermon in town at her house. She survived her husband 10 years, lived with her son Jacob, and died in 1820. Her funeral was attended in a barn and she was buried beside her husband on the hill before mentioned.\n\nJOSEPH STANHOPE, SENIOR, and family, came from Guilford, Vt., to this town in 1796, and commenced on the flats above and adjoining Hugh MILLER. The family consisted of himself, wife and 6 children -- Sally, Isaac, Joseph, Leverett, Mun, Ezra and Samuel The three last wore born in this town. Joseph is still living on the old homestead. He and Samuel are the only ones living. They got grain ground at Fairfield, which they brought with them, but they soon. had to use the samp-mortar.\n\nCol. Timothy SEYMOR of Hartford, Ct., the same year built a dam across the river, above the present dam, and a saw-mill and grist-mill, near where the present mills now stand. They made their mil-stones from a granite found near by. Tradition says that after pounding out their bread for more than a year, when they got their first meals, they made a pudding and ate it with egg-nog, i. e. rum and eggs.\n\nMrs. STANHOPE died in. 1829, and was buried on the farm where they first began. Mr. STANHOPE lived several years longer, and was buried beside his wife. Their graves are now visible, being curiously marked -- with white flint-stones in their native state, two at the head about as large as a bushel basket, two at the feet the size of a peck, and covered along from head to feet with smaller ones, all white as marble -- much better than many others that have lost their identity.\n\nDANIEL LOVELAND\n\nDANIEL LOVELAND came to this town about the same time of Mr., STANHOPE, and took a large tract of land near the falls, taking in the island, and all of the land south of the falls on the river to what is called the Loveland brook. He built a log-house on the rise of land above the interval, a few rods west of the buildings now owned by H. D. FARRAR. After the saw-mill was built he commenced a framed house, the first in town. But he left town before it was organized, Jona JANES and Stephen BLAISDELL taking his place.\n\nMr. BLAISDELL came on the ice over the river, and probably others. There was a road opened from the ferry at the lower end of the Island to intersect with a Berkshire road, at a point near the farm of Henry MILLER, but it did not continue long, the road being opened on the south side of the river, that grossed trout river, taking the main travel by the way of Enosburgh Center, up to about 1820, when a bridge was built across the main river, to about 2 miles this side of East Berkshire.\n\nIn 1778, others moved into town, viz. Rowand POWELL and family, Jared FARNHAM, Chester WELLS, Stephen CARPENTER and Daniel JANES, and several young men nearly of age.\n\nAbout this time the inhabitants were called to part with three of their number. A young man by the name of BURBANK, living with Judge JANES, was killed by the fall of a tree, and buried on the south bank of the mill-pond where he was killed, near the house of William CORLISS. This was the first death in town. The next was that of Plympton JANES, son of Jonathan, aged 8 years. The next was a boy by the name of Joseph HOOKER. Ho was sent to the mill-pond for water and fell in and was drowned.\n\nAs many settlers were now moving into town, it was thought best to have it represented. For this purpose Stephen ROYCE, father of Gov. ROYCE, in a warning dated the 30th of March 1799, called a meeting to be held at the house of Jonathan JANES. They met agreeable to the call, and chose Stephen ROYCE moderator. The meeting opened, the town was organized by the election of the following officers: town clerk -- Chester WELLS; treasurer -- Jonathan JANES; selectmen -- Jonathan JANES, Daniel JANES and Robert KENNEDY; constable and collector -- Theophilus Hastings.\n\nThe first freemen's meeting was held on the first Tuesday of September of the same year. The vote was unanimous for the following officers -- only 11 votes being polled; for governor Isaac TICHENOR; for lieutenant governor, Paul BRIGHAM: for treasurer, Samuel MATTOCKS. In that meeting they elected Jonathan JANES their first representative.\n\nTOWN REPRESENTATIVES\n\n1799, Jonathan JONES 1834, John HUSE 1800, Jonathan JONES 1835, John HUSE 1801, Jonathan JONES 1836, Alden SEARS 1802, Jonathan JONES 1837, Alden SEARS 1803, No record. 1838, John HUSE 1804, Joseph PARKER 1839, John HUSE 1805, Robert KENNEDY 1840, Nathaniel SEARS 1806, Robert KENNEDY 1841, Jay POWELL 1807, Robert KENNEDY 1842, Jay POWELL 1808, Amherst WILLOUGHBY 1843, Josiah BLAISDELL 1809, John POWELL 1844, Alden SEARS 1810, John POWELL 1845, No election 1811, William ROGERS 1846, Harvey D.

Copper has also been found in this ledge. A company was formed to work it, and considerable labor has been expended there, but the ledge is hard, and it costs more to get it than it is worth. A granite rock of sufficient size to make the face-stones for the front side and end of the meeting-house, was found on the ground where the house stands. No other ledge or stones were near it, nor were there any of the same quality in town, or in other towns near by. The question is, where did this rock come from? A geologist lecturing in this house, said that the same quality of granite could be found 45 miles N. E. of this place. There are four mineral springs in town; one at the Center, one near the village on Caleb ROYCE's land, one on William W. GOFFs land, near the mill-pond of G. N. POWELL and E. S. LOCKE, and one on the island, below the trotting park. This Island which lies in the Missisquoi river near the village, contains about 100 acres of land. A portion of it is used for a trotting-course. The fairs of the Franklin County Union Agricultural Society are also held on it. CALKINS and GARVIN have dug a canal 130 rods long, taking water out of the Missisquoi river at the mouth of the Stanhope brook, making a fine water-power.\n\nThey have a saw-mill and tub-factory now running, and other machinery soon to be added. This town never suffers much from. drouth. It abounds in springs of water.\n\nThe meeting-house was built in 1842. It stands on the hill on the north side of the river. A school-house large enough to accommodate meetings was built at the center of the town -- an elevation of land, about two miles south of the village. It is the center geographically, but not of business. It is a farming district. Town meetings were formerly held there, but lately at the village. A brick school-house was built on the ground where A. W. SEARS' store now stands. It was burned in 1850. Joseph SEARS kept the first high school in town there. The nearest post-office for this town until 1817, was Enosburgh Center, at which time the mail route was extended from Danville, Vt., over the mountains to this place, and mail brought on horseback. \"The North Star,\" a paper printed at Danville, was, I believe, the first regular newspaper taken in this town. But the route was soon changed from St. Albans to this town, which continues to the present time. We have now three stage lines: a daily stage to St. Albans, another to Sweetsburg, P. Q., and a tri-weekly one to North Troy and Newport.\n\nThere is a post-office at East Richford, a small place on Missisquoi river and Canada line. It is 5 miles above the village, on the road to North Troy.\n\nBenjamin PUFFER, grandfather of William R. and John M. PAFFER, preacher in the Methodist traveling connection, was the oldest man in town, who died at the age of 98 years. The oldest man now living in town is William GOFF, in his 80th year. (Feb. 1869.)\n\nRICHFORD VILLAGE\n\nRichford Village lies in the northerly part of the town, contains over 500 inhabitants, has a fine water-power, on which there is now a grist-mill, saw-mill, a shop for sash, doors and blinds, a shop for butter-tabs and pails, a wheel-wright-shop, a cabinet-making shop, a black-smith's shop; and, on the east side, a bark-mill and tannery. The village is about equally divided by the river. On the north side there are two dry-goods stores, a drug-store, a grocery and provision-store, a boot and shoe-store; in Union Block, a store for books and stationery, a printing-office, a lawyer's office, a doctor's office, a masonic hall, a good templar's hall, a millinery shop, &c., a meeting-house, a hotel, 2 harness-shops, and 2 shoemaker's shops. On the south side of the river, in addition to what is before mentioned; 2 dry-goods stores, 2 groceries, a store for stoves and tin-ware, 2 blacksmith shops, 2 hotels, a custom-house and town clerk's office a telegraph office, and a union school-house, in which two schools are kept summer and winter, and a select school, spring and fall.\n\nFIRST COMMENCEMENT\n\nDaniel LOVELAND, before mentioned, commenced near the Falls, where he staid about two years. Judge JANES took his place. Dr. Amherst WILLOUGHBY built the first store for goods, on the lot now owned by Mr. HARRIS, and a distillery near the east end of the dam. David THOMAS and Samuel SHEPHARD built a trip-hammer shop, and Peter BRAZEE a black-smith's shop on the same side of the river. The first bridge was built across the mill-pond near the dam. Daniel JANES built a house of boards and scantling, where William CORLISS' house now stands. Samuel SHEPHARD built a log-house, where O. J. SMITH's shoe-store now stands, and a framed barn nearby, on a hill. Edward LADD built a small house where John DWYER now lives. Aaron F. STEWARD built a house of scantling and boards, near the house of William GOFF.\n\nA road was opened to the head of the rapids, now East Richford, by boating 8 miles to Doctor GILMAN's place in Patton, then to North Troy. By this route the trade for Glen, Sutton, Patton, and a part of Orleans Co., passed this place to Missisquoi Bay and Montreal, to market. Nathaniel RAINS built a tavern on the corner near the house of C. S. ROYCE, Esq.; ___ SPRING built a house where Caleb ROYCE now lives; Dea. Joshua SMITH, next north, Caleb SANDERS and Samuel CALF, built houses on the same road. Chester WELLS lived on the CARR lot; Eld. William ROGERS next lot north. Jared FARNHAM lived on the farm now owned by C. S. ROYCE. Stephen CARPENTER lived near where Alfred DAMON now lives. Samuel WHITE began on the east side of the North Branch, on the interval above the bridge about 100 rods. Samuel L'HOMMEDIEU, began on the road to Sutton, where George BROWN now lives; Bradford JANES the next farm north, where George W. SMITH now lives; John FRENCH next lot north, and Yankee Tom-SHEPHARD, -- as he was called -- on the next lot, adjoining Canada Line. These places are not all in the village proper, although it is but a mile and a half to the lines. Settlers were now coming rapidly. Nearly all of the best lots of land were taken up. All appeared prosperous. Land about the falls was high, Corn sold for $3.00 per bushel, and other provisions in proportion.\n\nBut the times soon changed. In the spring of 1804 the freshet took off the bridge and trip-hammer, and other damage was done. This was not all; there was trouble about land-titles. Doctor WILLOUGHBY's store was burnt. Judge JANES moved to St. Albans. Settlers moved away about as fast as they had come in. Samuel SHEPHARD and BRAZEE went to Canada, WILLOUGHBY to Berkshire, STEWARD to Vergennes, RAINS and SPRING to Ohio, others to places of their nativity, and business run down (except a little sawing boards and grinding grain). WILLOUGHBY's distillery and malt-house proved a failure; not much loss to the town, I think.\n\nThe few settlers that remained, with large families, had to face the storm. Attempts were made to revive business. Bradford POWELL, John POWELL, and Horace JANES, of St. Albans, formed a copartnership in 1808, for trade. They sold goods in a small store on the east end of the falls, but did not continue long. Hard times and few customers could not support it. Uri FOOT came on to the JANES place, sold goods for a while, and built a new grist-mill, but soon failed up. About 1810, Edward COOK came into town, built a house where E. H. POWELL now lives, and a shop for cloth-dressing and carding wool, but the troublesome times of 1812, induced him to sell out and move back to Canada. Hezekiah GOFF, Jr., took his place, and carried on the business 2 or 3 years, and then sold to Ralph STEBBINS, of Sheldon, who added to and fitted up a house, on the ground where Doctor HUSE lately lived; but the war of 1812, and the cold season of 1816, nearly desolated the town, very few inhabitants remaining, and they nearly starved for the want of bread; not an ear of corn that was fit to roast, was raised in town. Corn was worth, at the lake, $3.00 per bushel, and flour $16 to $18 par barrel, and no way to get it, but by making salts and potash out of the trees. It was not possible for those with large families to supply them with bread, and potatoes and milk supplied a share of the food.\n\nIn the spring of 1817, the third bridge was carried off by the freshet, and there was no bridge that year. The pond was crossed in a boat in summer, and in winter on the ice.\n\nIn 1818, Hezekiah GOFF built a bridge and warranted it to stand 15 years. It was so constructed that it dammed the river, so that it washed off the road on the north side, where the Union block now stands, and was no doubt the principal cause of carrying off the mills. In 1819, Hezekiah GOFF died, leaving a widow; and 5 children. In 1820, Bradford POWELL died, leaving a widow and 9 children, Two, leading men in town business, in the prime of life, leaving 17 children to find homes among strangers. In 1822 the freshet took off the saw-mill, gristmill, clothing-works, and drain-bridge, everything clean to the bare rocks. But the bridge below remained until it was drawn out. By this freshet some were; nearly ruined, as to prospects. It seemed to be almost the finishing stroke. [It would make a long chapter to write all the troubles of these times.] Stephen BLAISDELL and Ralph STEBBINS were the principal losers. In 1823, Enoch CARLTON, of Cambridge, in company with Nathan PIERCE, traded in goods in the store-room of the BLAISDELL house. PIERCE traded about 2 years, took what money and other valuables he could handily carry and one of our girls, and left for Canada, leaving a wife and one child. Several young men went to get them back, but the most of them had the privilege of seeing the inside of Montreal jail. In 1822, the town was resurveyed by Joseph BEEMAN, of Fairfax. The proprietors held a meeting at the house of Stephen BLAISDELL, at the close of the survey, and so arranged matters as to give good titles, and quiet the settlers in possession of their lands. Soon after, Enoch CARLTON, with his son-in-law, Alden SEARS, moved into town, gathered up what remained of PIERCE's trade, built a store, brought on more goods, and had a successful business. SEARS built a hotel, now the Union-house, and an ashery, which he run for the business; but ashes soon failed.\n\nHe built a starch factory, which paid well for a while, till the potato-rot prevented a supply of potatoes. He next tried to make whisky in this factory, but grain was scarce, and he could buy whisky cheaper than he could make it. The factory was turned into a wheel-wright's shop where G. N. POWELL has made wagons for several years past. SEARS sold out here, and went to California. In 1824, William GOFF moved from Sheldon to this town, bought the falls of Stephen BLAISDELL for about $1000, and all the land on the east side of main-street as far south as A. W. SEARS' store, put in a run of stones, in the saw-mill previously built by Mr. BLAISDELL, where he ground corn until the mill-stones were transferred to a new grist-mill -- a small mill about 20 feet square, standing where the saw-mill now stands. He next built a shop for cloth-dressing and wool-carding, near the drain-bridge, and lived in the upper part until he moved into the house where he now lives. He next built the present grist-mill, and afterwards a starch-factory, which is now the tub-factory. John DWYER has been the principal blacksmith for nearly 60 years. He now lives on the place where he first began, and is about 84 years old. The 10 years of reciprocity, no doubt, helped to advance the trade of this place. There is an excellent farming country lying north of this village, whose trade naturally comes here. Let us have reciprocity and a railroad, and trade would be lively here. A new school-house is in contemplation, but a new meeting-house is among the things of the future. The present generation has a much better prospect pecuniary, than their fathers who have labored before them.\n\nSCHOOLS\n\nCyntha JANES kept the first school in town in part of her father's house. Polly and Cyntha POWELL kept school in the STEWART house. A log school-house was built on the rise of land on the north side of the branch of the river. John STEARNS kept the first school in it. This was burned, but another log house was built farther north, which remained for school and meetings until 1819. Several now living graduated there: Elder Wm. ROGERS preached there on the Sabbath. It was fashionable then to go to meeting on ox-sleds. The old house had a Dutch back and stick-chimney. School-boys would draw in logs of wood 5 or 6 feet long, pile them up 3 or 4 feet high, and make a blazing fire. The books used, were Webster's Spelling-book, the American Preceptor and Third Part, Adam's Arithmetic and Grammar, Geography, Morse's Abridgment. In 1822-3 two school-houses were built in first and second districts, one on the corner near where Edwin WHEELER now lives; the other in 2d district, on the ground where A. A. BROWN's house now stands. There are now 9 school-districts in town; the village district numbers about 175 scholars, in which a graded school is kept, summer and winter, and a select school, spring and fall. C. G. AUSTIN taught the high school this fall, (1868), having about 60 scholars. A Union Sabbath school and Bible-class is attended on the Sabbath, at the meeting-house, with very goad success. The first singing-school was kept by Edward MORRIS, afterwards by Harvey and Thomas DURKEE, of Sutton. They were sweet singers, but their voices have long since been silent in death.\n\nSOUTH RICHFORD\n\nSouth Richford lies in the S. W. corner of the town, and is a fine farming region. A small stream of water runs through it, which empties into Trout river. The first saw-mill and grist-mill was built by Hezekiah GOFF, about the year 1802, near Montgomery line; but the business run down while he was in the war of 1812. Afterwards David GOFF built a saw-mill and grist-mill higher up the stream, where the road to Montgomery crosses it. Other machinery for cloth-dressing, a turning-lathe, &c., were run there for a while; but finally the larger streams near by took away the custom. Some 15 or 20 families are united in a school-district here. They have a good school-house, in which they sustain good schools; also preaching on the Sabbath, a Sabbath-school and Sabbath-school library.\n\nThe first settlers were Asa MORRIS, Edward MORRIS, Rossel ALLEN, Nathan ALLEN, Ira ALLEN, Levi ALLEN, James DWYER, and Hezekiah GOFF, before mentioned. William LEBARON, began about the same time, (1802). Rossel ALLEN moved back to Pomfret. Mr. DUNHAM took his place, and afterwards Samuel FARRAR, father of Hon. Harvey D. FARRAR, of this village. Nathan ALLEN was deacon of the Congregational church of East Berkshire, but a society of Methodists being formed in his own neighborhood, he joined them and remained in their communion to the time of his death. His widow is still living, aged 85 years.\n\nMETHODISM IN RICHFORD\n\nBY REV. B. F. LIVINGSTON\n\nIn the year 1802, Elijah HEDDING, afterward Bishop, on his way to appointments in Canada, stopped and preached the first Methodist sermon in town, at the house of Hugh MILLER, as has been before said, I do not know as there was any more preaching by the Methodists in the town till after the war with England. Then they had occasional preaching supplied them from the Fairfield Circuit by Isaac HILL, James and Samuel COVEL and ___ NORTHROP. The first regular appointment was by Salmon STEBBENS at the house of R. WRIGHT; then by Fitch REED at the house of Dr. A. LUSK in 1825, Elijah CRANE and Orville KIMNPTON of the Sheldon circuit, assisted by two English missionaries from St. Armand, Matthew LANG and William SQUIRES, commenced a series of meetings, from which quite a revival occurred; and a Mass was formed and attached to the Sheldon circuit, viz. of Dr. Alvin LUSK and wife, Rebecca GOFF, Rebecca CARR, Porter BLISS and wife, and within a few days Jay POWELL and wife, making up eight members; and that same fall the number was increased to 30 or 40. Jay POWELL (who with his wife are the only members now remaining), was immediately appointed assistant class-leader. Dr. LUSK was leader. In one year, Jay POWELL was appointed class-leader and steward, which office he held for about 20 years. Oct. 5, 1827, he was licensed to exhort by Rev. William TODD. Jan. 30, 1830, he received a license as a local preacher from the presiding elder, John CLARK. The 31st day of August, 1834, he was ordained deacon by Bishop HEDDING. He is still waiting with his harness on for the consolation of Israel, respected and loved by the church as its spiritual father.\n\nIn 1842, the Methodist Episcopal church and the Calvinistic Baptist church built a union meeting-house, which is now occupied by the different religious bodies of the town. As the Sheldon circuit increased in membership it was divided, and the Richford class was embraced in the Franklin circuit, and when the Franklin circuit was divided this class was embraced in the Berkshire circuit, and the next division left it in the Montgomery circuit. In the spring of 1861, Richford was set off from the Montgomery circuit and formed the Richford and East Berkshire circuit, with its headquarters at Richford, and Rev. B. F. LIVINGSTON was sent to take charge. From that time it has had a resident minister. In the fall of 1864 it had completed its new parsonage. The following is a list of the ministers having charge of this society since the class was first formed, with the date of their pastorate: 1825-6, Elijah CRANE; 1827-8, William TODD; 1829-'30, Jacob LEONARD; 1831-32, Benjamin MARVIN; 1833-34, Stephen Stiles; 1835-36, Reuben WASHBURN; 1837-38, Alanson RICHARDS; 1839-40, Mr. GREGG; 1841, Mr. MCKELLAPS 1842-3, B. M. HALL; 1844-5, Hiram DUNN; 1846-7, John SAGE ; 1848-9, Myron WHITE and John HASLEM; 1850-1, D. H. LOVELAND; 1852-3, Mr. TAYLOR; 1854-5, Benjamin COX; 1856-7, J. S. MOTT and D. LEWIS; 1858-9, Alfred EATON; 1860, Truman WILLIAMS; 1861-2, B. F. LIVINGSTON; 1863-4, Densmore AUSTIN; 1865-6, S. DONALDSON; 1867-8, B. F. LIVINGSTON.\n\nThe membership of the Methodist church, including only those residing in town, is over 90.\n\nBAPTIST DENOMINATION IN RICHFORD\n\nBY REV. A. T. ARMS\n\nThe first Baptist Church in this town was organized Aug. 12, 1802. A council composed of delegates from St. Armand and Sutton, Canada, met at the house of F. GIBBS in Sutton, and held the public services of recognition. There were 5 male and 6 female constituent members, namely: J. FRENCH, F. BROWN, F. GIBBS, S. CARPENTER, J. ROWE, S. FRENCH, R. GIBSON, L. GIBBS, F. CARPENTER, C. SCOVILLE and N. CALF. The first members received into the church at her first covenant, meeting, Aug. 21, 1802, were Thomas ARMS and his wife, Martha ARMS. The first persons baptized in Richford were Stephen CARPENTER and his wife, Florinda CARPENTER and Rhoda GIBSON. They were baptized by Rev. William MARSH, pastor of the Baptist church in Sutton, who previously, had occasionally preached in town. He and Rev. Jedediah HIBBARD of St. Armand, who also made occasional visits here, were evidently the first Baptist ministers that preached in the town. Rev. William MARSH continued his labors with the church, a part of his time during the first, and a part of the second year, of her history.\n\nDec. 18, 1803, the church called to the pastorate the Rev. William ROGERS of Stanbridge, Canada. He accepted; and in March, 1804, moved into the town and commenced a pastorate which continued for 45 years.\n\nThe present, or third Baptist church in Richford, was organized July 16, 1851. The recognizing council was composed of delegates from the Baptist Churches in Enosburgh, Montgomery, Fairfield, and St. Armand. There were 14 constituent members; most of whom had previously been members of the first or second Baptist churches in Richford. The first pastor was Rev. J. C. BRYANT. He was succeeded in 1857, by Rev. A. BEDELL. In 1860 Rev. A. L. ARMS was called to the pastorate, in which capacity he is still serving. He was ordained Feb. 17, 1853. Two others, to wit, G. W. ARMS and William S. BLAISDELL, who formerly belonged with this church, are now ministers of the gospel. In September last this church reported 67 members. But few of these, however, reside in Richford.\n\nJune 22, 1867, a branch of this church was formed in St. Armand, Canada, where a revival commenced in February of that year, and continued for some 15 months. Most of the members reside here in the vicinity of the pastor's residence.\n\nAdditions were made to the church from time to time, and for 20 years a good degree of prosperity was enjoyed. But in November, 1825, some difference in doctrinal views between the members of the church, resulted in the formation of a second Baptist church. An attempt was made in 1834, to reunite the two churches, but without success.\n\nThis division left the first church in a weak condition; and the additions being comparatively few, the constant diminution by death and removal, &c., resulted in the extinction of the church. The last entry upon the book of record bears date Feb. 5, 1848. From 1839 to 1842, Rev. James ROCKWELL was assistant pastor. Three individuals, once members of this church have subsequently become ministers of the gospel, to wit, John STEARNS, Prosper POWEL and Albert STONE.\n\nTHE SECOND BAPTIST CHURCH\n\nThe Second Baptist Church, as intimated above, was formed in 1825, or soon after. No records of this church being at hand, a few general Statements from memory only can be given. She had an existence of about 15 years, and enjoyed the labors of Rev. Prosper POWEL, James ROCKWELL, John SPAULDING, Albert STONE, William ARTHUR and Wellington SORNBORGER. In 1842 this church, in connection with the Methodist Episcopal church, erected the first meeting-house in town. A good revival was enjoyed in 1842, and quite a number were added to the church. But through the labors of Rev. Columbus GREEN and others, the greater part of the members embraced the doctrines advocated by William MILLER, in consequence of which the church became extinct in 1844.\n\nSEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS\n\nBY REV. A. C. BOURDEAU\n\nIn A. D. 1857-61, labors were bestowed occasionally in East Richford and vicinity, by S. D. Adventist ministers, and a. small company soon became believers. Since that time the friends in Richford met frequently with the S. D. A. church in Enosburgh, and vice versa. In 1863, Elders A. S. HUTCHINS and A. C. and D. T. BOURDEAU organized a S. D. A. church in East Richford, of 13 members; appointed a local elder, clerk, and S. B. treasurer; and the church set down their figures on systematic benevolence amounting to $10.00 per year. Since then others have been added to their numbers; and at present (1869) 24 in the organization, pay on S, B. more than $120.00 per year, which means are used to help in the furtherance of the cause. They propose to erect a house of worship the ensuing season, and have pledges already toward the enterprise amounting to nearly $800.00. This church is favored from time to time with the services of Elders A. STONE and A. O. BOURDEAU.\n\nMAJOR CALEB ROYCE\n\nMajor Caleb ROYCE was an early settler of this town. He with his wife were emigrants from Tinmouth in this State, where they were born and lived until they removed to Richford.\n\nThe commission of Caleb ROYCE as Major of the third regiment in the third division of Vermont militia, given and signed by Isaac TICHENOR, governor, the 4th day of July, 1806, and also the commission of governor TICHENOR of Caleb ROYCE as Justice of the peace, dated Nov. 5, 1808, are now in the hands of his son, I. S. ROYCE, of this town. Major ROYCE held the latter office until within a few years of his death, In August 1844.\n\nBRADFORD POWELL\n\nBradford POWELL was born in Brimfield, Mass., in 1775. His father, Rowland POWELL, moved to Hartford, Vt., where he lived several years, and then moved to Sheldon.\n\nBradford, then a young man, lived with Col. BOWDITCH of Fairfield, worked days, and studied nights, and obtained a tolerable business education. He came to Richford as early as 1799, and his name appears on the record as one of the first listers. He surveyed the first and second divisions of land for his uncle, Jonathan JANES, agent for the original proprietors of said town. He commenced and cleared a farm in the bow of the river, where the writer now lives. He married Clarrissa GOFF April, 1803. After the freshet had carried off the bridge, and trip-hammer, and Dr. WILLOUGHBY's store was burned in 1808, he moved on to the place where William CORLISS now lives.\n\nHe formed a copartnership with his brother John, and Horace JANES of St. Albans, and commenced trade in a small store on the ground where Alvin GOFF's house now stands. Goods came principally from Montreal, but the embargo and war of 1812 broke up their trade. He was deputy collector of customs under Solomon WALBRIDGE, Gov. C. P. VAN NESS of Burlington. There were troublesome times on the line, stealing, plundering and smuggling being the order or the day. On one occasion, for seizing a team, he had every hoof of stock driven into Canada. A black horse was never returned.\n\nA company of cavalry was sent here in October, 1812. The following names appear on his book, Daniel WINCHESTER, David CURTIS, Josiah BENNETT, Elisha HUTCHINS, Joseph WHITE, P. STRONG, Sargeant BURTON, and others. Forage being scarce here, they were exchanged for a company of Infantry, Jan. 8, 1813. The following names appear; Capt. MORRILL, Lieut. Rufus SIMONS, Ensign BUGBY, and others remained during the winter.\n\nThere was a smugglers' road through North Berkshire, where a heavy business was carried on. Two custom officers were not sufficient to stop the trade over this road. Two soldiers at a time stood guard. On one occasion, two sentinels were overpowered and taken into Canada, but hearing from the commander of this department, Gen. FIFIELD, they concluded best to give them up. Before the war was closed, there was an arbitration on the line, to settle disputes about seizures, driving off cattle, &c., which brought together a large number from both sides of the line, Gov. C. P. VAN NESS and others, from this side, and lawyers from the other side, were in attendance three days. During this time, as was customary, there was a ring for wrestling, in which the champions from both sides engaged. It was finally agreed to decide the war, each side to furnish its man. The side whose champion was thrown was to be beaten. Mr. WARREN from Stanbridge, and Jonathan SMITH of this town, were the chosen men. After two or three hours' wrestling, Jonathan floored his antagonist. It was satisfactory to all parties, and he afterwards wore the champion's belt.\n\nAfter the war, the cold seasons, as before stated, commenced, and some families had to live without much bread. The subject of this sketch had 9 children to provide for, his health was poor and be had to mortgage land which he never redeemed. His sickness was long and severe. He was a member of the Baptist church, and died in hope of a better life, June 11, 1820, aged 45 years. His widow lived till Sept. 19, 1864, being 79 years of age.\n\nJOSEPH PARKER\n\nJoseph Parker came to Richford in 1802, and settled on land south of what is called the Parker pond. The county-road was laid and chopped out from Berkshire, by this pond, through the geographical centre of the town, to what is called the MACK place. About this time a few settled on this road, viz: a family by the name of ADAMS, Phineas R. WRIGHT, Hibbard DELANO, and Abner MACK. But hills were high and hard and the road was never worked. Joseph PARKER moved into the North part of the town, on the place where Edwin WHEELER now live. He died. May 7, 1823, aged 70 years. He was town clerk, represented the town several times in the state legislature, and was justice of the peace. He had five sons, Russell, John, Ariel, Sterling and Chauncey. Russel lived to an old age -- about 96 years. John married Betsey JEWETT; died at south Richford, leaving one child, John PARKER, now living in Ohio; the widow married Andrew CUMMINGS; was the mother of Elam CUMMINGS, a Congregational minister living in Highgate. STERLING was a leading man in town business; died August 19, 1828, aged 47 years. Ariel died a few years since aged 80 years. Chauncey is now living in town.\n\nEPHRAIM CORLISS\n\nEphraim CORLISS came to this town in 1804, and commenced on the lot of land now owned by the Rev. William PUFFER. He married Abigal GOFF, by whom he bad 12 children, all living except one, James, the eldest. He worked hard and fared hard in the former part of his life. He was a worthy christian man, and a member of the Baptist church. He died Feb 21, 1841, aged 59 years. His widow is still living in town, aged and infirm, and looking for that blessed hope and glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour, Jesus Christ.\n\nPHYSICIANS\n\nDr. Wm. SAMSON was the first physician that settled in town. He built a house where Charles S. ROYCE now lives, in about 1801. He practiced here about 3 years and then moved to Berkshire, where he died. Dr. Alvin LURK commenced practice in 1816. He lived in town until 1827. He had a large practice and accumulated a handsome property. He spent the last years of his life at East Franklin. Dr. John HUSE came to this town in the spring of 1828. He was born in Sandown, N. H., in 1798. His father moved to Stratford about 1808. He studied medicine at Lebanon, N. H., and attended medical lectures at Hanover. He first commenced the practice of medicine at Enosburgh, Vt., in 1826. He next went to West Berkshire, where he staid 2 years, and moved to Richford in 1828, where he now resides. He has had a long and successful practice, and has been town clerk about 15 years, and held other town offices. He is aged and infirm, and now lives with his son-in-law, Hon. Silas P. CARPENTER of this village. Drs. HAMILTON and SMITH are now our regular physicians.\n\nHEZEKIAH GOFF\n\nHezekiah GOFF, Sen., came to this town in 1802, and began at the south part of the town, where he built a saw-mill and grist-mill on a small stream. He was a soldier in the war of the American Revolution. He lived at South Richford until the war of 1812, when he enlisted for 5 years, and took with him two sons, Seth and Jonathan, his sister's son, John PARKER, now Col. PARKER of Essex, Vt., and Elias COMBS, a grandson, now living in Wisconsin.\n\nWhile in the war his place ran down and he lost his land. He died Fob. 1848, aged 95 years, his wife the mother of 18 children, died in 1815, when he was in the war.\n\nJONATHAN CARPENTER\n\nBY MRS. LAURA POWELL\n\nJonathan CARPENTER was among the early settlers of this town. He was born in Rutland, 1784. His father moved to Berkshire when ha was quite young, where he lived a while. He was soon obliged to rely wholly upon his own exertions, and, therefore, apprenticed himself to a tanner and shoe-maker, where by diligent application to business and study, be formed habits which shaped his after life. He came to this town as early as 1800, and in 1810, he married Patience ROGERS, daughter of Rev. Win. ROGERS, and settled on a small farm bordering on Canada line, he built a rude log-house in which he lived, and a small shop for shoe-making -- this was also made of logs. His vats for tanning leather were made on a flat near a brook without any covering excepting a few loose boards thrown over them and covered with tan in winter to keep them from freezing. His bark-mill consisted of a platform, or plank on the ground, on which a large slab of stone, rounded, was turned around a center shaft by one horse. The bark being thrown in the track of the stone was ground to sufficient fineness for tanning purposes. Bu: the increasing demand for leather induced him to sell his farm on the line, and remove to the Falls.\n\nIn 1826, he commenced business at the Falls, on the north side of the river, on the site where O. J. SMITH's boot and shoe-store now stands. In addition to his leather manufacturing, he built a store near the north end of the bridge, where he did an extensive business, and also, an ashery opposite on the bank of the river, where that part of Union Block, occupied by L. ROUNDS as a store, now stands. He did a successful business, owing partly to the fact, as he used to say, \"that tanning would be good business as long as children were born barefoot.\"\n\nHe was an enterprising and influential citizen, possessed of a sound judgment, and scrupulously honest. He held nearly all town offices, justice of the peace for 25 or 30 years in succession, town clerk a number of years. He was the first mover in the cause of temperance in this town, and was during his life a firm supporter of the cause. He was a believer in the Christian religion, and died in the faith, Sept. 1859.\n\nREP. JAY POWELL\n\nBY MRS. LAURA POWELL\n\nRep. Jay POWELL was born in Richford, March 7, 1804. His father, Bradford POWELL, died when he was about 16 years of age, leaving 9 children. Jay being the eldest, the care of the family consequently, devolved upon him. At the time of his father's death, his estate, owing to cold seasons and hard times and a protracted sickness of 3 years, was in an embarrassed condition. He managed to provide for the smaller children until places could be, found for them. He then went to work wherever he could find employment, to raise money to pay the debts that were against the estate. Money being hard to be obtained, ordinary labor would not command money, consequently he was compelled to resort to any kind of labor that would bring money. He stayed in the woods for months at a time, making ashes, the principal source of raising money in those, times.\n\nIn less than 5 years he had succeeded in paying all debts against the estate, and saved the property for the children. He married E. M. SMITH in 1824; in 1825 he experienced religion and was one of 8 members that formed the first Methodist class in town, of which he is now the only surviving member.\n\nHe was appointed leader of the class, afterward labored as an exhorter for some time, and was finally ordained deacon in 1834, at Plattsburgh. Ho never joined the conference, but labored on the plan of the circuit, filling a share of the appointments. He never received any compensation for his labor, but like most local preachers, labored with his hands during the week, and preached on the Sabbath.\n\nThere being no settled Methodist preacher in town, he was often called to attend funerals, which called him; away from his secular business -- thus dividing his labors, when his growing family required his whole attention. He never wholly gave up preaching, but for quite a number of years preached but little, He was always zealous to promote the interest of the church, yet at the same time liberal in his views.\n\nHe manifested, when but a boy, true moral courage and manhood, while struggling under the weight of poverty with a view to better days. The same decision of character which marked his youthful days, has through life exhibited itself in the discharge of his moral and religious duties. He has at times, held many important offices in town. During the last 10 years he has suffered much from congestion and loss of one lung. He now lives on the farm where he was born, feeble in health, awaiting the call of the Master, when he hopes to obtain a better life.\n\nREV. WILLIAM ROGERS\n\nBY MRS. LAURA POWELL\n\nRev. William ROGERS was born at Hancock, Mass., June 6, 1773. His father, Clark ROGERS, was a native of Rhode Island. He was a Baptist minister, and the first settled minister of that place; no dates of his birth or death are left.\n\nRev. William ROGERS was married to Susannah CARR, April 28-1791, after which he resided in Hancock 5 years. He then removed to St. Armand, P. Q, where he resided until 1804. He experienced religion when about 18 years of age, but did not make a public profession until after his removal to the Province. About the age of 24, his attention was again called to the subject, in a powerful manner. The nature of his exercises and emotions are described by the following lines composed by him at the time:\n\n\"Six years ago, and some above,\n\nWith Jeans Christ I fell in love,\n\nSuch love I never knew before;\n\nLord, of thy mercies give me more!\n\nWhat vows to God I then did make,\n\nTo suffer shame for Jesus' sake;\n\nBut Oh, Alas! my vows I broke,\n\nWhich brought me under Satan's yoke.\n\nBut now my Lord has come again,\n\nAnd, washed my soul quite free from sin;\n\nAnd washed in his redeeming blood,\n\nI now can praise a pardoning God.\n\nAll praise into the once slain Lamb\n\nWho's gone to plead for rebel man.\n\nI plead the merit of his blood,\n\nThat we may praise a pardoning God.\n\n~ Wm. Rogers\n\nIt was some time before he made a public profession. He entertained doubts in regard to his fitness for baptism. He was the second person baptised by immersion in St. Armand, and one of the seven that constituted the first Baptist church in that place, and was appointed deacon.\n\nHis mind soon became exercised in regard to his duty to preach the gospel The Baptist church in Stanbridge being destitute of a preacher, solicited his services, and he was therefore damned to the work of the ministry Sept. 1802, Elders Sam'! ROGERS, J. MARSH and J. HIBBARD being present. He labored there until 1804 when he removed to Richford, where he became pastor of the First Baptist Church, which at the time numbered but very few communicants, but afterwards became a prosperous church.\n\nHe was a preacher of the old stamp. He enjoyed but few advantages for literary culture, but Providence had given him that in greatest plenty, which would be most useful to him in his condition in life. He was a man of close observation, and accurate discrimination, he permitted nothing to pass without his notice, and possessing a rare memory, he was enabled to accommodate the knowledge thus obtained to the purposes of life.\n\nHis life was governed by fixed religious principles, and whatever he believed to be right, that he dared maintain, and ever had the courage to be true to his convictions, and express them boldly, even when such a course placed him in opposition to his friends.\n\nHis ideas of reform were wholly upon gospel principles, he discarded the idea of forming societies, or organizations other than church organizations. He enjoyed the confidence and respect of the community. He several times represented the town in the State Legislature. He died March 9, 1851. His widow survived him a little more than a year, and died at the residence of her eldest son, who has since removed to Orleans Co., where he still resides the only surviving member of the family.\n\n\"The Vermont Historical Gazetteer:\n\nA Magazine Embracing A History of Each Town,\n\nCivil, Ecclesiastical, Biographical and Military.\"\n\nVolume II, Franklin, Grand Isle, Lamoille & Orange Counties.\n\nIncluding Also The Natural History of Chittenden County.\n\nEdited and Published by Miss Abby Maria Hemenway.\n\nBurlington, VT. 1871.\n\nPage 278-289."
