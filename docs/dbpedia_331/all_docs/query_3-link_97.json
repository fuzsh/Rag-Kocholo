        "text": "090530-1\n\nIn the course of researching Finlay ROSS (b. 1819 Inverness-shire, Scotland, d. 1904 McKillop, Ontario, Canada) who I believe was my great-great-grandmother's brother. I came across quite a few Rosses who settled in the Huron District and had originally come from Ross-shire. Finlat's brother married a Ross who was from Nigg in Ross-shire. Also one of Finlay's sons married sisters who were Rosses. I got the feeling that there may be more extended family in Canada than I realised. I would love to know the place of origin of any Ross families who settled in the Huron area to try to establish any connections. Thank you.\n\nContact Jacqui Kirkman, Australia; Email: jacqui@kirkman.com.au\n\n090530-2\n\nIs there a definite source that proves that William Guillaume Ross who came to Canada as an NCO in the 78th Fraser Highlander Regiment and fought at Quebec including on the Plains of Abraham was born in Tain, Scotland? He settled in Quebec in 1763 and on January 9, 1764, married Marie-Josephe Proulxand. He is recorded as living in St-Thomas-de-Montmagny, QC. He died on November 7, 1808, in Rimouski, St Germain, Quebec. I have the records of his death and burial but nothing that gives a source of his birth. I have read from Laforest's biography on William Guillaume Ross but I don't know where his information comes from.\n\nAs can be noted his first two names are interchangeable depending on the source or person who wrote about him. Thank you.\n\nContact: Peter Lagasse; email: mrlwca@hotmail.com\n\n090530-3\n\nHello, I'm going to Scotland in August 2009 and I'm hoping to find lost cousins. My Grandfather immigrated to Canada about 1902. His name was Alexander Ross from Langwell just outside of Ardgay and he was born Nov 21, 1885. He had a large cattle ranch near Eckville, Alberta. His father's name was William Ross, son of Flora, and his mother's name was Margaret (nee Munro), born about 1851 in Alness, daughter of Hector and Ann Munro. My great grandparents William and Margaret had seven children; Hugh 1877, Hector 1879, David 1881, Flora Ann 1883, Alexander 1885, William 1887, and Roderick 1889. Granddad's brother William married Williamina MacGregor in 1926 at Tain and his other brother, Roderick, married Elizabeth Gunn in 1931 at Spinningdale. I will be staying in Tain and I'm going to the Ross Clan Gathering there in August. I hope to make a connection. Thank you.\n\nContact: Marion Miles (nee Ross); Email:fmmiles@telus.net\n\n100530-2\n\nBack in 1854 James and Christian Ramage left Lanark, Scotland to start a new life here in Australia. His sister or brother left the same sort of time & migrated to Canada. I believe their name to be Ross.\n\nWe had a visit here in Australia several years ago from Cathy Ross from Canada who was a distant relation, but I have lost touch with her. I would like to hear from Cathy Ross if this is possible. I would also love to get in touch with any of the Ross family from Canada who may be able to fill in the missing pieces. Any help would be appreciated.\n\nContact: Andrew Ramage Email: ramageconsulting@bigpond.com\n\n100831-1\n\nSearching for information on Walter Ross born c1900 in Inverness. Homestead in Olds Alberta and had a daughter named Margaret. I believe Walter also lived in British Columbia. I was told he won prizes for his gardening. Have found a large group of Rosses from Inverness in Olds Alberta as well as a couple of Walters with sons also named Walter. Another Ross descendant has stated that their Walter Ross won awards for his gardening but died in early 1900's. Mine was alive in 1979 when his great grandson (my son) was born in Calgary where Walter's daughter Margaret lived and died. Margaret first married a Cooper in Edmonton where her son Ken was born. They have all passed away now and I lost track of them when I divorced Ken and moved back east. There was a Walter Ross who is listed in the Alberta Homesteaders Archives who had a large spread and died in 1912. I have found ship records and immigration records but again I have not been able to connect anyone as Margaret had married another two times when she died around 1982 and I cannot remember her last name at that time so have not been able to backtrack. Does anyone have any info on why this large grouping of Ross would be in Olds Alberta? Thanks.\n\nContact: Alannah Ryane.

The wedding announcement was in Baddeck, Cape Breton, 1869, and described James Ross as a merchant and widower, age 51 (i.e. if accurate, this would make him born about 1818). Family info suggests this James went to Erie County, Buffalo, New York. He is believed to be a merchant (milk peddler) living on Puffer Street, Buffalo, in the 1800 US Census. James was the son of my pioneers, Alexander Ross (b.c. 1789) and Mary (McKay) Ross, who settled at Little Narrows, Cape Breton. I have most of the information about the rest of this Ross family (James' siblings) but have almost nothing on this James and Catherine. His parents, Alexander Ross and Mary (MacKay) Ross, are believed to have come to Cape Breton from Stornoway, Lewis. At least several of their children were born in Stornoway. The Little Narrows area of Cape Breton is settled mostly with settlers from the Parish of Uig, Lewis. If anyone has a James Ross born early 1800s with connections to Cape Breton, I'd be interested to hear from you.\n\nContact: Donald Ross . . . Email: donaldross@eastlink.ca"
