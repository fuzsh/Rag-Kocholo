        "text": "A Calgary judge has released video evidence of a police interview with Derek Puffer that was taped in the hours after he was arrested for killing his mother and stepfather.\n\nThe Crown prosecutor has concluded the case against Puffer following the presentation of the video where the 40-year-old tells police he stabbed them because of voices in his head.\n\nPuffer faces two counts of second-degree murder.\n\nDet. Patricia Allen, who interviewed Puffer, told the court today she believed he was hearing voices again during the three-hour interview and described him as being in a trance-like state at times.\n\n\"I just went in there after getting instructions and just stabbed them and I can remember them going, 'No,'\" he said on the tape. \"And I don't know why I didn't stop. I was like in a trance.\"\n\nThe trial, which began Monday, heard that Donna Lee and Bill Powers were stabbed a total of 25 times in their sleep in July 2013.\n\nPuffer has pleaded not guilty and his lawyer, Alain Hepner, told Justice Kristine Eidsvik that the issue in this case is not whether Puffer committed the crime, but whether he is not criminally responsible because of mental illness.\n\nPolice interview\n\nOn the tape, Puffer tells the detective he had been hearing voices and music in his head for days.\n\n\"I blacked out and did a lot of irrational things. It was bizarre. It wasn't me. I just lost control of who I was,\" said Puffer.\n\nHe also told the detective the voices told him to \"Go get Billy.\"\n\nBill Powers was a well-known sportscaster who retired in October 2009 after almost 50 years in the sports broadcasting and communications business.\n\nThe court heard that Puffer was found that night naked with blood on his hands at a nearby bus shelter at 14th Street and Southland Drive.\n\nHe told police he suffers from schizophrenia and hadn't taken his medication for nearly 20 years. He also said the couple had put a computer chip in his brain and he was hearing voices asking him about a knife.\n\nDuring his testimony, Const. Michael Green, who found and arrested Puffer, described the accused at the time as \"stoic, emotionless and calm â€¦ cool as a cucumber.\"\n\nTowards the end of Det. Allen's interview she asked Puffer if he's sorry for what he did.\n\n\"Yeah. I'm really sorry but I don't know, I just don't feel very well,\" he said.\n\nPuffer is expected to testify Wednesday. The trial is scheduled to last all week."
