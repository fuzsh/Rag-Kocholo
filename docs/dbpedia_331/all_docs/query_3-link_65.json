        "text": "Article content\n\nIn this weekly blog post I’ll catch the stories that fell through the cracks or skipped past us when we were looking the other way. I’ll tell you about my favourite story and then provide a reading list of stories you may have missed.\n\nI recently wrote a piece for the Canadian Association of Journalists’ Media Magazine about how ethic dilemmas seem to pop up when you are least prepared for them. When the shootings at the HUB Mall happened, we had a skeleton crew of inexperienced journalists and we had to deal with some pretty big ethical issues on the fly. I’ve come to realize that it’s pretty much always this way.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles by David Staples, Keith Gerein and others, Oilers news from Cult of Hockey, Ask EJ Anything features, the Noon News Roundup and Under the Dome newsletters.\n\nUnlimited online access to Edmonton Journal and 15 news sites with one account.\n\nEdmonton Journal ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSupport local journalism.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles by David Staples, Keith Gerein and others, Oilers news from Cult of Hockey, Ask EJ Anything features, the Noon News Roundup and Under the Dome newsletters.\n\nUnlimited online access to Edmonton Journal and 15 news sites with one account.\n\nEdmonton Journal ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSupport local journalism.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nWe have guidelines, but the big questions are messy, contentious things that haven’t always been properly decided. The Globe and Mail, faced with what seemed to be a pretty blatant case of repeated plagiarism, seemed to simply shrug. A columnist from the rival National Post even defended (although somewhat incoherently) his competitor.\n\nEthical debates in journalism happen for everyone to see. For better or worse, everyone can see that we don’t always have it all figured out.\n\nI wondered, when this story was first published, about common newspaper conventions about reporting criminal charges — if maybe this was one of those things we need to think a little harder about. When a police officer was accused of exposing himself to a woman he was arresting, the story seemed a little odd. When the follow-up came in, after the hearing, he was exonerated of the charge. The woman’s story had changed repeatedly, and she had a strong motive to falsely accuse him to try to avoid arrest.\n\nI understand the need to keep an eye on the courts, and I understand that a reporter’s presence in the courtroom is a vital check on the system. But sometimes it seems like a person’s reputation can undergo indelible damage without any real cause.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nWhen Dominique Strauss-Kahn was accused of rape in the U.S., the French couldn’t believe the kind of reporting that went on. The assumption of guilt was pervasive and that’s not how their media operates.\n\nI’m not convinced we should change our ways, but it’s certainly worth thinking about and having that little ethical discussion before publishing.\n\n(And for what it’s worth the hearing placed the blame squarely on the Edmonton Police Service: “The EPS has been woefully inadequate at considering alternative resolutions to disciplinary matters, whether they are minor or major.”)\n\nGood reads from the Edmonton Journal\n\nAn Edmonton judge rails on “vexatious litigants”\n\nAn Edmonton couple is forced to foot a massive monthly bill for allergy-free baby formula\n\nPolice and peace officers honour those who fell in the line of duty (this very nice writing from Mariam Ibrahim)\n\nFascinating piece on a “living building” portable classroom in Jasper\n\nPaula Simons on casual homophobia on social media\n\nGood reads from around the web\n\nJ.K.

A nice piece on the unlikely rise of John McEnroe.\n\n“He had just graduated from a private high school in Manhattan, where he was a top student and a gifted athlete who loved any team sport, and particularly basketball and soccer. But even though he never trained or practiced regularly, his quick feet and soft hands made him a natural at the solitary game of tennis. He was the runner-up at the 18-under national junior championships in his senior year of high school and earned the chance to play the Wimbledon qualifying tournament from which a few players would win wild cards and advance to the main draw. Two weeks later, he found himself in the semifinals on Centre Court opposite Connors.”\n\nEnjoyed this post? Want these updates sent directly to your inbox or reader?
