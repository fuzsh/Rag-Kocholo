        "text": "No. 713.\n\nAdmiral Polo de Bernabé to Mr. Fish.\n\nAs a result of the protocol signed at Washington on the 29th of November last, relative to the case of the Virginius, the undersigned, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of Spain, has the honor to transmit herewith to the Secretary of State of the United States various authenticated documents, which prove, in the opinion of the undersigned, that the steamer Virginius had no right, at the time of her capture, to use the flag of the United States.\n\nThe documents referred to are a certified copy of the papers relative to the said steamer, in the archives of the New York custom-house, which were used for the purpose of clearing the vessel at that port on the 4th of October, 1870; affidavits of Shepperd, Bowen, and Smith, persons who have commanded the Virginius since her departure from New York, and during a part of her illicit career in the Caribbean Sea and its neighborhood; the affidavit of Greenwood, engineer on board during a part of the same time; and those of Murphy, McCann, Gallagher, Rawlings, and Furlong, seamen or firemen, together with the affidavit of Yarona, the so-called secretary or chief of staff of General Quesada, so-called, who appears to have been the person who really controlled the vessel from the date of her departure from the United States in 1870, and during most, if not all, the time which elapsed between that date and her capture.\n\nAll this proof has been taken after a notice to the Department of State, in which the undersigned pointed out the propriety of the attendance of a person appointed for the purpose to examine the witnesses, [Page 992] as he might think fit, on the part of the United States, which was done accordingly.\n\nTogether with the depositions taken in the city of New York, the undersigned also transmits to the honorable Secretary of State the original and a translation of proof taken at Santiago de Cuba, on the 26th of October, 1871, before the consuls of the United States and of Venezuela, and given by two persons who were on board the Virginius at the time that vessel landed in Cuba a military expedition commanded by Raphael Quesada, about the 21st of July, 1871.\n\nFrom an examination of the aforesaid documents the following facts appear to be sufficiently proved:\n\nToward the close of 1869, or at the beginning of 1870, the leader of the Cuban insurrection created a mission, called “foreign,” in the United States, the principal members of which were Manuel Quesada, in the quality of president, and Adolphus de Varona, secretary. Prior to the time adverted to the said leader had sent one Morales Lemus in the character of a diplomatic representative to the United States, in anticipation of the moment when the Federal Government might believe that the belligerent rights of the insurrection should be acknowledged.\n\nThe object and the character of the mission of Quesada were not diplomatic, but aimed at the creation in the United States of a financial, naval, and military center, whence material aid might be dispatched to the insurgents. He was also intrusted with the purchase of arms and munitions of war, with-authority to enlist men to act in hostility to a country with which the United States were in relations of the most perfect peace, friendship, and good faith. Quesada arrived at New York in February or March, 1870, and held interviews with different Cuban associations, clubs, or meetings, organized in the United States to aid the insurrection in Cuba by means of pecuniary and other assistance.\n\nEven in advance of the departure of Manuel Quesada from Cuba, two military expeditions from New York had landed in that island, one in the steamer Perit, under the command of the so-called General Jordan, and the other in the Salvador, with Raphael Quesada, brother of Manuel, and both composed of a large number of men, provided with arms and munitions.\n\nIn discharge of the functions of his mission adverted to, General Jordan, a citizen of the United States and one of the persons comprising the expedition, was selected by Quesada to organize the military forces of the insurgents, and at the proper time Jordan returned to the United States after having been relieved by Agramonte.\n\nOne of the results of the mission of Quesada and of the other Cuban associations in the United States was the collection of a large sum of money, by means of individual subscriptions and by the sale, in this country, of the so-called Cuban bonds, which sum was placed in the hands of one Castillo, appointed treasurer of the said funds, whose residence was at New York. In the sequel a board of directors was appointed, which controlled the expenditure of the money, the purchase of arms and vessels, and the enlistment of men.\n\nAmong the members of the club were H. Raymond, Martinez, José Maria Mora, Plutarch Gonzalez, and others, who then were and now are residents of the city of New York. With the money collected as has been stated, and controlled by the Cuban agents of the insurrection, the steamers Florida and Virginius were purchased. The latter vessel, built in England, became the property of the United States by capture as a blockade-runner while attempting to enter the southern [Page 993] ports of this republic, and again up an a subsequent occasion in the settlement of a debt. Her nominal purchaser, who on the 27th of August, 1870, took from the United States Treasury Department a proforma proprietary title, was a person named John F. Patterson, then and now a resident of the city of New York. It does not appear to be clearly shown by the depositions and other accompanying documents whether Patterson bought the steamer as agent of said insurgent Cubans, or whether he did it in his own name, afterward transferring it to the latter.\n\nThe undersigned, however, has reason to believe that when a thorough examination of all the circumstances shall have been made, it will appear that he did not make the purchase, except in the character of agent, as above expressed. At the time of the sale, the steamer was at the Washington navy-yard, and one J. K. Roberts, of New York, in September, 1870, employed Captain Shepperd to navigate her from that navy-yard to the port of New York; which service was performed in the course of that month, Roberts having stated to Shepperd that he had bought the vessel of the United States Government on account of certain Cubans, among whom he mentioned José Maria Mora, of the city of New York, and the so-called General Quesada; that the Cubans had furnished the money for the purchase, and afterward for the repairs and finishing-work on board at the city of New, York. And about two weeks after her arrival at that port Roberts stated to Shepperd that the steamer was the property of Mora, Quesada, and other insurgent Cubans, and that she was going to be employed in landing expeditions in Cuba and in other enterprises in the interest of the Cuban insurgents; and Roberts asked Shepperd if, under such circumstances, Shepperd was disposed to take command of the steamer; and when Shepperd wished to inform himself further touching the true character of the business, Roberts answered that he should be presented to Mora and Quesada, which introduction took place the same evening at Mora’s house, in the city of New York; Quesada, Patterson, Adolf Yarona, and various other Cubans being present. At the aforesaid interview, Mora and Quesada declared frankly to Captain Shepperd that they were owners of the vessel, and, for the purpose of persuading him to take command of the Virginius, Mora stated to him that there would be various opportunities for making money offered to him, by means of the capture and confiscation of Spanish vessels and their cargoes on the high seas. Yarona, Quesada’s secretary, testified that the sum paid for the vessel proceeded from the insurrectionary funds, and amounted to about $15,000, and that both the fact of the purchase, as well as that of the payment, were well known at the club of the Foreign Mission, as also the fact that the cargo of the schooner Billy Butts, which vessel, by a preconcerted arrangement, met the Virginius near the island of Curacoa, in November, 1870, was bought with funds of the same origin. If, indeed, evidence of these allegations does not appear to be fully established in the depositions to which reference has just been made, the undersigned relies for the conviction of the Secretary of State, or any legislative or judicial tribunal, or any committee of Congress empowered to compel the attendance of witnesses, and upon their answers to proper questions, which would easily show that Patterson, the supposed owner of the Virginius, received $15,000 for her in United States currency, a large sum in so called Cuban bonds, and a further compensation for his agency in obtaining a register and a clearance in his name from the New York custom-house, and for the purpose of appearing in the false and fraudulent character of her true [Page 994] owner during her piratical enterprises against Spain. The principal persons who were concerned in the purchase of the steamer, such as Quesada, Gonzalez, Martinez, and various others, are now in the city of New York, within the jurisdiction of this Government, and within easy reach of the exercise of its sovereignty; while, on the other hand, neither the undersigned nor the government which he represents enjoys, in this country, any power to compel true answers to be given in investigations for the purpose of exposing the true history of the purchase of the steamer and her clearance from the port of New York.\n\nThe Virginius left that port, pursuant to what is said above, about the 4th of October, 1870. The annexed custom-house papers declare that she carried no cargo, and, after the most particular inquiries, the undersigned has found no indication that any insurance was effected on the vessel, conformably to the usual practice for merchant-vessels or honest transports. General Quesada, Varona, Eloy, Camacho, Domingo Mora, (son of José Maria Mora, to whom reference has already been made,) and various other Cubans who took passage on board of her, did not embark at the wharf, as is customary for honest passengers, but overhauled her at sea in the lighter Virginia Seymour.\n\nDuring the voyage to Curaçoa, having descried a merchant-vessel, and believing it to be Spanish, Quesada proposed to Captain Shepperd, through Alfaro, that the said vessel should be captured, and the scheme was only abandoned when it was noticed that the vessel was sailing under the English flag. In the vicinity of the island of Curagoa, the cargo of arms and munitions of war from New York in the schooner, Billy Butts was transferred to the Virginius under the direction of Quesada, and the steamer proceeded to Puerto Cabello; meanwhile Varona went in the schooner toward the island of Cuba, and sought, as he declares, to put himself in communication with Cespedes, for the purpose of obtaining for Quesada an appointment making him sole representative of the material interests of the insurrection in the United States.\n\nDuring the whole of the passage from New York to Puerto Cabello, the captain of the Virginius recognized Quesada as owner of the steamer, and as a superior whose orders he must obey.\n\nVarona testifies that during the voyage, in the name of General Quesada, he informed Shepperd that the steamer really belonged to them and not to Patterson or to any one else, giving him by this to understand that she belonged to the Cuban club; and the witness added that his personal expenses were to be paid from the same funds which had been used to buy the steamer.\n\nCaptain Shepperd left the Virginius at Puerto Cabello, and about the middle of November, 1870, returned to the city of New York, where he had interviews with Patterson and with Mora, the former having stated to him that he ought to have brought the vessel to New York, taking advantage of the title which he had in his possession. Shepperd imparted this indication, in a measure, to Mora, who denied that Patterson was the real owner of the vessel, in proof of which he showed him receipts for the purchase-money and for the finishing and repairing done at the port of New York before the voyage, given in favor of Mora.\n\nPatterson subsequently expressed to Shepperd his regret that he had permitted his name to be used in connection with the ownership of the vessel, and Roberts also told Shepperd that the vessel would have to sail as the property of an American, because the Cubans could not own a vessel of that nationality.\n\nCaptain Shepperd declares that on various occasions he had conversations [Page 995] with the consuls of the United States at Curacoa, Laguayra, and Puerto Cabello, in relation to the ownership and destination of the Virginias, and that the consul at Puerto Cabello requested him to make a statement in regard to a rumor which had reached his ears, to the effect that the steamer was going to serve in a revolution then in progress in Venezuela; Shepperd did so in a letter dated December 9, 1870, in which he proposed to state, as he declares, under oath, that such was not, to his certain knowledge, the object of the persons interested in the vessel, nor would he have to render any such service while in command.\n\nThe entire testimony of Captain Shepperd, as regards his conversations with these different consuls of the United States, leaves the impression that they were not ignorant of the real ownership and the real destination of the vessel, while they wished to see nothing but her papers certified by the collector of customs at New York.\n\nAfter the arrival of the Virginius at Puerto Cabello, a conference was held with the accredited representatives of Guzman Blanco, who was then at the head of one of the contending parties of that state, at a place on the beach not far from the Virginius.\n\nTo this place Quesada was brought in a boat from the Virginius, which carried the insurgent flag of Cuba, and after this the principal part of the cargo of arms and munitions of war was conveyed from the steamer to a fort that was near. Before this took place, Captain Smith having abandoned the steamer, one Marquez, the chief engineer, who had shipped in New York, was made what the witness calls the paper-captain, because he was no seaman, while the real command was held by a Cuban named Eloy Camacho, who likewise shipped at New York, in company with Quesada, from the Virginia Seymour. The vessel was at once set to work transporting Venezuelan troops along that coast, in the interest of Guzman Blanco; and afterward the assistant engineer, Greenwood, having gone, by order of Quesada, on board of a Venezuelan vessel-of-war which was in that port, the Virginius towed said vessel-of-war out to sea, and assisted in the capture of a flotilla of armed schooners belonging to the party that was contending against Guzman Blanco, and while this capture was in progress the Virginius hauled down the American flag and hoisted that of Venezuela in its stead.\n\nThe most brilliant exploit performed by the Virginius after the aforesaid incident ‘was’ the landing of a military expedition on the coast of Cuba, the details of which are given in the depositions taken at Santiago de Cuba by the consuls of the United States and of Venezuela.\n\nAt a subsequent period of her career, in April, 1872, she is found at Aspinwall, where Captain Bowen, whose testimony forms a part of the accompanying documents, took command, having been commissioned for this purpose by Manuel Quesada and his chief executive officer, Pedro Alfaro, who distinctly stated to him that she was intended to be used in landing military expeditions on the island of Cuba. Captain Bowen remained in command of her for two or three months, and during that time he never knew or recognized any other owners than the Cubans.\n\nWhen he went on board as captain, the vessel had no American flag, and he bought one himself.\n\nBowen, in his testimony, clearly expresses the conviction that the consul or consular agent of the United States at Aspinwall was only too well aware of the true character of the vessel and the kind of business in which she was engaged.\n\nWhile Bowen was in command at Aspinwall, an incident occurred [Page 996] affecting the ownership of the steamer, and throwing a great deal of light upon the real ownership as well as upon the absence of all direction of or interest in its acts on the part of Patterson. A considerable debt had been incurred for repairs and provisions, and on this account Captain Bowen states that he gave to a business house at Aspinwall and Curaçoa, whose owners were known to be agents of Quesada and the Cubans, a mortgage on the vessel in his own name, as captain. This he did not do, as he states, in the exercise of his discretionary powers as the captain of a merchant-vessel, but he acted solely in obedience to the orders of Quesada. He made no arrangement with Patterson in relation to the matter, nor did he ever inform him of the transaction until his arrival in New York when he told him of it, altogether casually, in the course of conversation. It is probable that this mortgage would not have been given if Bowen had considered Patterson as the owner, or if Quesada had been only the freighter of the vessel; and the reason why Quesada neither signed nor executed the mortgage as the owner, doubtless was that, had he done so, the American consul and everybody else would have seen that the papers of the vessel, which declared that Patterson was her owner, were incorrect and fraudulent. The mortgage for payment subsequently in part at Puerto Cabello by Quesada and the English consul at that place, who acted as the agent of Mahl Brothers, who were obligated by the mortgage; and for the rest of the sum that was due, a new mortgage was executed, the old one being canceled by the then captain of the steamer, Smith, who, as had been done on the former occasion, acted according to Quesada’s instructions, there having been no communication on the subject with Patterson in New York, save in the case or the mortgage signed by Bowen.\n\nBowen leaves no room for conjecture as regards his own belief concerning the ownership of the Virginius; he openly declares his belief that the vessel was owned by Cubans, although sailing under the American flag and calling herself a United States vessel. This individual left the steamer at Puerto Cabello, where Captain Smith took command, having been engaged by Quesada, as his predecessors had been, without having had any communication concerning the vessel, either directly or indirectly, with Patterson.\n\nHe gives a detailed account of his departure from that port; of what was said to him by Quesada or Alfaro with regard to converting the vessel into a privateer and capturing Spanish merchant-vessels on their way to Maracaibo. He also states how and when he took Pulgar and his followers on board, and speaks of the habitual use which he made of the Venezuelan flag. He says that he only had one American flag on board, while he had six of the so-called Cuban flags. He states what occurred on board on the anniversary of the rising at Yara, and finally states that he obeyed the directions of Quesada and no one else, and expresses his conviction that the vessel was owned by Cuban insurgents, and that Patterson had no sort of interest in her.\n\nThe testimony sent with the present note concludes at the time that Captain Smith gave up the command of the Virginius; but from that moment her operations in the landing of a military expedition on the coast of Cuba, and subsequently up to the time of her capture by the Tornado, are matters of public notoriety.\n\nBy the light afforded by the foregoing statement, based upon the authenticated testimony of persons who have been on board of the Virginius, the invalidity of the documents with which the vessel was dispatched in the port of New York is very clearly seen.\n\nThe United States, in conformity with their views of what is required [Page 997] by international interests, have enacted laws and established rules and conditions for identifying and determining the nationality of vessels carrying their flag. These rules and conditions treat, among other things, of the place of building; of the nature and domicile of the owners, officers, and crew, and of the formalities with which the papers are to be issued. The laws of the United States are very strict as regards that which constitutes national character, as is well-known both to navigators and to writers who treat of this part of law.\n\nOne of these laws provides that “previous to the registry of any vessel or ship, the husband, or acting and managing owner, together with the master thereof, and “one or more sureties,” to the satisfaction of the collector of the district whose duty it is to make such registry, shall become bound to the United States, if such ship or vessel shall be of burden exceeding three hundred tons, in the sum of two thousand dollars, with condition, in each case, that the certificate of such registry shall be solely used for the ship or vessel for which it is granted, and shall not be sold, lent, or otherwise disposed of to any person or persons whomsoever; and that if any foreigner, or any person or persons for the use and benefit of such foreigner, shall purchase, or otherwise become entitled to the whole, or any part or share of or interest in such ship or vessel, the same being within a district of the United States, the said certificate shall, in such case, within seven days after such purchase, change, or transfer of propetry, be delivered up to the collector of the said district; and that if any such purchase, change, or transfer of property shall happen when such ship or vessel shall be at any foreign port or place, or at sea, then the said master, or person having the charge or command thereof, shall, within eight days after his arrival within any district of the United States, deliver up the said certificate to the collector of such district.” (U. S. Stat, at Large, vol. 1, p. 290.)\n\nIf the inclosed papers of the Virginius be attentively examined, it will be seen that the bond required by the law previous to the registry is only signed by the ostensible owner, Patterson, and by Captain Shepperd, but that the signatures of the sureties required by the law are wanting. The burden of the Virginius being more than three hundred tons, the sum which ought to have been pledged according to the law is $2,000, and it is very easy to see why she could not or would not procure the required sureties; whether a transfer of the Virginius was made to the Cuban insurgents previously to the registry, it being agreed that she should be allowed to use said American registry; or, after having obtained her registry, it was agreed to make a transfer to them of the whole or a part of the vessel.\n\nThe undersigned will not now stop to examine whether, according to the law of the United States, the want of said sureties did not invalidate the registry of the Virginius so far as to deprive her of the protection of the United States flag. He only purposes now to call attention to the fact that the lack of sureties confirms the evidence that the vessel had been transferred, directly or indirectly, through Patterson, to foreigners who never had any intention to bring it back to the United States.\n\nIt may be confidently asserted that Patterson did not intend, either in case the Cuban insurgents should acquire the whole or a part of the ownership before the vessel left New York, or in case of the transfer being effected after her departure from the port, that her captain should return the certificate, as provided by the law, within eight days after his return to the United States, and he therefore took good care to furnish no surety that he would do so.\n\n[Page 998]\n\nThe undersigned does not see how the Secretary of State of the United States can doubt that it was the intention of Patterson, and the Cuban conspirators who were associated with him, fraudulently to obtain from the collector of customs at New York certain formalities on papers which should be just sufficient to enable them to clear the vessel, and which, in foreign ports, might furnish a plausible pretext to the consuls of the United States to dispatch her. In proof of this it will be observed that no number was designated for the Virginius, (as provided by the act of Congress of July 28, 1866,) up to February 21, 1872, and that, when a number was then designated, it was not done in virtue of an application addressed by the owner or captain to a collector of customs, as required by the regulations of the Treasury Department. This circumstance tends to prove, in the judgment of the undersigned, that the true owners of the vessel had no interest in assuring to themselves the protection to their property which is provided by the laws of the United States, in that it is marked with all clearness that if, at any time, a registered vessel ceases to have the number to which she makes reference, said vessel will cease to be recognized as a vessel of the United States.\n\nThe undersigned does not propose, on this occasion, to make an examination of the conditions which may be required, and of the elements which may at all times be necessary to establish the nationality of a merchant-vessel of the United States. He cannot do less, however, than to call attention to a declaration of the Supreme Court of the United States, according to which “the object of a register is to make manifest the nationality of a vessel which is engaged in trade with foreign countries, and to furnish her a means of making evident that nationality wherever she may be found.”\n\nWhat effects can be assumed or what respect paid to a register obtained in fraudulent violation of the laws of the United States, or used subsequently with manifest infraction of said laws, when the transfer of the proprietorship of the vessel to a foreigner has been accomplished?\n\nThe same eminent tribunal has likewise declared, at a period not more remote than the month of December, eighteen hundred and sixty-eight, that “the vessels of the United States are the creatures of the legislation of Congress,” and that “vessels that are not within the terms of the acts of Congress, and have not aright to the benefits and privileges which the same confer, have no more value as respects American vessels than the wood and iron which have served for their construction; their true value, if not their complete and total value, consists in their right to the character of national vessels, and to enjoy the protection of the national Hag hoisted at their mast-heads.”\n\nOn another occasion the presiding judge of the Supreme Court (Chief-Justice Marshall) decreed that “in cases of alienation to a foreigner, the privileges of an American hull are ipso facto annulled.”\n\nAnother case emanating from the most elevated tribunal of this country will be found on page 227 of the 9th volume of Wheaton, in which the judgment pronounced appears so exactly applicable to the case now under discussion, that the undersigned cannot omit to call to it the attention of the Secretary of State.\n\nA vessel called the Margaret obtained a register at the port of Baltimore, and subsequently was transferred in Cuba, by edict, to a Spanish subject domiciled in that island, after which she sailed for Baltimore with her American documents.\n\nOn the institution of proceedings of confiscation against the vessel, in virtue of section 16 of the act of 1792, relative to registers, the [Page 999] defense relied on the circumstance that the transfer to a Spanish subject had been effected with the sole object of evading the Spanish customs-laws, and that the real American ownership had not undergone an exchange bona fide. The court expressed itself in these terms:\n\nBut even supposing that the only object of the transfer was the perpetration of a fraud against the laws of Spain, it was, nevertheless, an act which bound the parties and changed the legal ownership. It was, within the terms of the law, a complete transfer to a foreign subject, by way of trust and confidence, the nature of the confidence requiring that there should be a reconveyance to the American owner when the special ends of the first transfer had been carried fully into effect. We are in nowise disposed to admit that a reconveyance would be decreed in any American court of justice in a transaction of this character with a foreign subject, in a foreign port, in violation of the laws of this country it is sufficient for us, however, that the transaction is within the very terms of the act of Congress, which does not require a sale in good faith, but an exchange of ownership “by way of trust, confidence, or otherwise.” But we are told that the case is not comprised within the intention of the act. What that intention is can only be known by the terms in which the act is drawn; and every part of it evinces the great solicitude of the legislative body to discover and examine every change of ownership, for which purpose the act requires a public declaration of the change and its verification in the vessel’s papers, which make apparent at all times the names of the legitimate owners. The manifest intention of these laws is to encourage American navigation [to the exclusion of] foreign ownership, and of securing to American vessels, duly registered, a preference in all our fiscal transactions over every vessel hot having strictly a right to that character. The legislature foresaw that it would be impossible for the agents of the government to ascertain the secret intentions of individuals or the object of a transfer of ownership. The question of whether such transfers had been made in good faith, or had merely served to cover an illicit purpose, was a matter which had to be left to the confidence of private persons, and could rarely be verified by competent and disinterested proof. To consent to secret conveyance of ownership to any persons, and especially to foreigners, and to allow vessels at the same time to retain all the benefit of American character, would put at hazard and might frustrate the main object of the act, and give place to all sorts of contrivances to evade the laws and place it out of the power of the Government to expose the fraud. There can be no doubt, therefore, as to what was the true purpose of the legislation, to wit: It was the establishment of clear and simple provisions of law, whereby it would be requisite for every transfer to be made known from time to time as it should occur, and to always give up the American documents when the legal ownership passed to a foreigner, whatever might be the secret conditions accompanying the conveyance. The terms of the section to which reference has been made are clear and positive, and so far from invalidating, they sustain most completely the intention of the act. They cannot, consequently, be interpreted in a more limited sense than that which their evident purport indicates.\n\nIt is plain to the undersigned that this authorized exposition of the law of the United States must destroy every effort and pretext on the part of Patterson, or any one else claiming to bear the name of that individual, to show that the register of the Virginius was valid and sufficient, or that said vessel had a right to use the American flag or papers at the time of her capture. Of a like character is the pretense that the conveyance to the Cubans did not deprive Patterson of the legal ownership, seeing that that conveyance was only made by way of trust or of charter of the steamer, with the view of withdrawing her from the use of the legitimate rights which Spain might have against her.\n\nIf, laying aside the municipal law, the honorable Secretary of State should allege that, in virtue of what was agreed on in the protocol of the 29th of November, 1873, Spain had contracted the duty of proving in a satisfactory manner to the Government of the United States tha the Virginius, at the time of her capture, unduly carried the flag of the United States, agreeably to international law, the undersigned cannot but insist that, according to the accredited text of that law, as Spain was authorized, in view of the circumstances, to inquire into the national character of the Virginius, and the documents and annexed evidence demonstrate that the American nationality which she invoked was at [Page 1000] the time of her capture by the Tornado, and according to the rules of international law, spurious and untenable. In fact, the principles laid down by Phillimore, in his Treatise on International Law, demonstrate that Spain had, and has, the capacity of proving, if this can be done, that the flag and the documents of the Virginius were “false credentials, used for the purpose of disguising the true character of the vessel;” “and it is not a less important part,” adds the same author, “of the ordinary labors of a prize-court to drag off this mask, and, the disguise being removed, to make appear in its true character an enemy’s vessel.”\n\nDana, the illustrious commentator on the Elements of International Law by Wheaton, puts forward the same ideas. He says:\n\nWhenever a nation has the quality of assuring itself of the nationality of a merchant-vessel, whether she be hostile or whether she be pacific, the right that it has to proceed thus cannot be limited by the flag or by the papers which are used. In such a situation a country is at liberty to inquire what there is behind the nationality indicated by the flag and the papers, and to make inquiry as to the true nationality, which depends upon the domicile of the owner and upon other circumstances. In a case of this kind, the vessel may be considered as condemned by the fact of her having used a flag and papers to which she was not entitled, if the country making the inquiry has an interest in proving such illegality. This is usually done in time of war, and may be done in time of peace. The practice is equivalent to the application of a rule of conclusive presumption, and the decision as to whether it is to be adopted or not is regulated by national expediency. The vessel cannot ask for the application of the rule for its benefit: so that if it should appear that the papers and flag of any particular nation had been used with the consent of that nation, the vessel having been thereby invested, in a given case, with a false national character, such consent does not stand in the way of the right of the country making the inquiry, as regards the relation existing between the said nation and the owner of the vessel, to cast aside all consideration of the flag and papers, and to show the true nationality of the vessel. In case of interference on the part of the nation that gave the consent, the question would become a political one between the two nations.\n\nIn the opinion of the undersigned, whatever may be the turn taken in the discussion relative to the nationality of the Virginius, adjusted to the acknowledged precepts of international law, it would have to terminate in the consideration of what class are the vessels which the United States have permitted to use their flag and to shelter themselves under the immunities of its colors. All nations ought to know and to respect said laws, and the undersigned does not deny the prerogative which every sovereign state possesses to determine for itself the conditions of the nationality of its merchant vessels.\n\nThe undersigned has had occasion to call to mind the very significant circumstance of the owners of the Virginius not having taken out a policy of maritime insurance for the voyage which she undertook from New York on the 4th of October, 1870. Now, in case the United States had recognized or affirmed a state of belligerency between Spain and her insurrectionary citizens in Cuba, and the Virginius had been insured at New York against capture, arrest, detention, or impediment on the seas by any king, prince, or power, and that Patterson had guaranteed the vessel as a national vessel of the United States, would a tribunal, which was called to judge in conformity to the law of nations, have decided that the insurers had incurred the obligation of making good the losses experienced in consequence of her capture by the Tornado? And if the guarantee of Patterson had expressed that the vessel was American, and proof been given of it, if necessary, that he was in the city of New York, would a judicial tribunal, which in presence of the declarations on which this writing was founded, have declared that the vessel had truly the character which had been attributed to her, and that consequently the insurers would be obliged to pay?\n\n[Page 1001]\n\nThe undersigned has the honor to show that, in virtue of the practice of all maritime nations, a guarantee of American nationality implies, first, that the vessel belongs in fact and in her totality to citizens of the United States at the time when the risk began; secondly, that said ownership had not passed into the hands of a foreigner, not even by way of trust; thirdly, that the vessel would have to go always provided with documents and other requisites which accredit in good faith the necessary elements of her true nationality.\n\nIn the case in question, the most positive proof exists that the Virginius has not been in the possession or at the disposal of Patterson as her sole and exclusive owner, even supposing that she ever was so, since October 4, 1870; but that, on the contrary, the direction of all her movements during the entire period which has elapsed has been in the hands of insurgent citizens of Spain, represented by Quesada and Alfaro.\n\nIt cannot be doubted that such a state of things, even were there no other circumstances, imposes upon Patterson the obligation to explain how and in what manner he transferred the control of the vessel to others, and by what legal documents, if any, and how it is, that a citizen of the United States has permitted the Virginius to be put to a use which, if he permitted it knowing what he did, renders him subject, according to the laws of his country, to fine and imprisonment.\n\nThe undersigned hopes that he has fully proved, by the foregoing considerations, and to the satisfaction of the honorable Secretary of State, that, according to the laws of the United States, in which are clearly and definitely laid down the conditions which must define the legal character of the nationality of their vessels, not only do there not exist such conditions in the case of the steamer Virginius, but that, at the time of her capture by the Spanish war-steamer Tornado, she was fraudulently using the papers and flag of the country whose protection she claims.\n\nThe undersigned avails. &c,\n\nJOSÉ POLO DE BERNABÉ.\n\n[Inclosure l.]\n\nBill of sale of registered vessel.\n\nTo all to whom these presents shall come, greeting:\n\nKnow ye that I, Everett C.

Shepperd.\n\nUnited States of America,\n\nSouthern District of New York, ss:\n\nTo all to whom these presents shall come:\n\nI, Joseph Gutman, jr., a commissioner of the United States circuit court for the southern district of New York, duly appointed and commissioned, and dwelling in the city of New York, send greeting:\n\nKnow ye, that on the twenty-eighth day of November, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three, before me, at my office, No 29 Nassau street, in the city of New York, appeared as a witness Francis E. Shepperd, a mariner, formerly on board the steamship Virginius, produced by the consul-general of Spain for the district of New York, in the United States of America; and that I was attended at the same time by Sidney Webster, esq., counselor at law in said city, representing the aforesaid consul-general of Spain, and by George Bliss, esq., attorney of the United States for the southern district of New York, attending by the direction of the Secretary of State of the United States, and that the aforesaid witness, having been first duly cautioned by me to declare the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, in respect to the matters concerning which he should be interrogated, and having then been duly sworn by me according to the laws of the United States, did, in answer to the interrogatories addressed to him in my presence, voluntarily, freely, and solemnly declare and depose in my presence as follows, that is to say:\n\n1.\n\nQuestion. Were you examined in the matter of the steamship Virginius before. Commissioner Gutman on the 2d May, 1872?—Answer. I think I was—that was the date. It was in the spring or early summer.\n\n2.\n\nQ. Where are you now residing?—A. Warrenton, Va.\n\n3.\n\nQ. For how long a time did you follow the sea as a profession?—A. Nineteen or twenty years.\n\n4.\n\nQ. Are yon a graduate of the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis?—A. I am, sir.\n\n5.\n\nQ. What year did you graduate?—A. Eighteen hundred and fifty-five.\n\n6.\n\nQ. Were you subsequent to your graduation a teacher in that academy, and for how long a time?—A. I was for two years employed as an instructor in the department of English and ethics.\n\n7.\n\nQ. Between what years?—A. Between 1858 and 1861.\n\n8.\n\nQ. What year did you leave the naval service of the United States?—A. In 1861.\n\n9.\n\nQ. Were you in the confederate service?—A. I was.\n\n10.\n\nQ. In what capacity?—A. In a variety of capacities. I served some in the army and some in the navy, once or twice in command of an iron-clad.\n\n11.\n\nQ. After the rebellion ended, were you in the American mercantile marine service?—A. I was.\n\n12.\n\nQ. Please state in what capacities and in what ships.—A. In a bark—the name of which I have forgotten—from Baltimore to Havana as first mate; then two years afterward in command of a steamer, for two years consecutively, called the Mary, which ran in the Gulf between Mobile and Cedar Keys; then, afterward, the Virginius.\n\n13.\n\nQ. Who were the owners of the steamer Mary?—A. During the first year that I commanded her she was owned jointly by Isaac K. Roberts, Colonel Ingersoll, of Mobile, and some few others whose names I have forgotten. After that she was represented to me to be solely owned by Isaac K. Roberts.\n\n14.\n\nQ. You commanded, did you not, the Virginius on her voyage from Washington to Hew York in 1870?—A. I did.\n\n15.\n\nQ. Who employed yon for that command?—A. Isaac K. Roberts.\n\n16.\n\nQ. How long have you known John F. Patterson?—A. Since 1870.\n\n17.\n\nQ. Then you first knew him about the time you took command of the Virginius? —A. About three months before.\n\n18.\n\nQ. When you sailed from New York in command of the Virginius on her voyage to Curaçoa, whom did you believe to be her owners?—A. I believed her real owners to be certain Cubans—themselves the real owners or the representatives of other Cubans. The names of these representatives or owners were General Quesada and José Mora.\n\n19.\n\nQ. Did you, before sailing on this voyage to Curacoa, have any conversation with John F. Patterson with respect to the ownership of the Virginius; if so, what was it, as nearly as you can recollect?—A. I did have conversations with Patterson on that subject. He said that the vessel would go in his name; and he, at that time and afterward, expressed to me regret at allowing his name to be used in connection with the ownership of the vessel.\n\n20.\n\nQ. Did you, before sailing to Curagoa, have any conversation with I. K. Roberts in respect to the ownership of the Virginius, and, if so, what statement did Roberts make to you on that subject?—A. I did; he stated to me that it was at the time not decided in whose name the papers should be made out—in his or in Patterson’s—and informed me that he had bought her for these parties that I have referred to, perhaps not mentioning their names, but using the general term “Cubans.” He said this thing, which I well remember, that of course she had to go out in the name of an American, as they (the Cubans) could not own an American ship.\n\n21.\n\nQ. In what line of steamers, if you know, was Roberts interested at that time?— A. He had been, up to that time, managing either for himself or for his father, Marshall O. Roberts, a line of steamers known as the Fernandina and Cedar Keys line.\n\n22.\n\nQ. Did Roberts say anything to you in respect to the purchasing of the Virginius back again from the Cubans for his line?—A. He did; he said that he was to have her for his line when she had finished running the blockade.\n\n23.\n\nQ. Did I. K. Roberts say anything to you about not permitting the Virginius to be in his name, on account of the objections which his father, Marshall O. Roberts, had raised?—A. That he expressed himself in that exact language, I would not say, but his objection, as I now recollect it, was expressed in language which produced that impression on my mind.\n\n24.\n\nQ. At what time did you first get a suspicion that the Virginius was to be used by the Cubans against Cuba, if at all?—A. About ten days before Mr. Roberts informed me of the fact, and about two weeks before she sailed. My suspicions were aroused by the fact that the repairs which were being put upon the vessel were inadequate to the kind of service in which the other steamers of this line or any passenger steamer required.\n\n25.\n\nQ. Did you have any interview with José Mora, at which he showed to you the bills which he had paid for the repairs of this steamer?—A. I did; at an office in No. 29 Broadway, New York City. This interview was about January, 1871, as well as I recollect; after I returned from Puerto Cabello.\n\n28.\n\nQ. State as nearly as you can what Mora said to you on that occasion.—A. He spoke of the large amount of money expended for fitting out the Virginius, and I think showed the bills to me more in connection with his disappointment at not having gone to Cuba, or as much for that reason as others. He showed me Patterson’s receipt for the purchase money paid to him, and the bills for repairs. Many of the bills I recognized myself as having approved them.\n\n27.\n\nQ. Do you remember to have seen, at any time, any bill of sale of the Virginius from Patterson?—A. I do not.\n\n28.\n\nQ. You say that you identified many of the bills as being for repairs which you knew were actually made on the Virginius?—A. Yes.\n\n29.\n\nQ. Was this the same Mora with whom, as you testified in your previous examination, you had an interview at his house, in company with Quesada, where your employment on the Virginius was arranged?—A. The identical man.\n\n30.\n\nQ. Did you have any conversation with any consuls of the United States, at ports or places around the Caribbean Sea, or thereabouts, in respect to the character of the business of the Virginius; if so, with whom?—A. I did; the first one with the consul at Curaçoa, Faxon by name, I think; next with the consul at Laguayra, whose name I have forgot ten; next with Lacombe, at Puerto Cabello. I do not embrace them all in the same category, as having said the same things about it. I made no reply to the assertion made by Consul Faxon, that though the papers of the Virginius were all right, that in his official capacity he had nothing more to do than to [Page 1010] recognize her as an American vessel; hut that he clearly understood the object of her mission in the Caribbean Sea, and was personally in sympathy with it; this was at Curacoa.\n\n31.\n\nQ. What did the consul at Puerto Cabello say to you, if anything?—A. The consul at Puerto Cabello asked me to make a statement to him with regard to a rumor which he had heard that the steamer was to be employed in the Venezuelan service, in the revolution then going on in that country, and I stated to him that to the best of my knowledge such was not the intention of those interested in the vessel, nor should such service be rendered by me while in command of her.\n\n32.\n\nQ. What did the consul at Laguayra say to you, if anything?—A. The consul at Laguayra said that while he, in his official capacity, recognized the nationality of the vessel, because of the papers and flag, he clearly understood what the object of her being there was; and treated with Varona, who was on board, and who, when Quesada was absent or present, generally represented him and acted for him.\n\n33.\n\nQ. What did the consul at Puerto Cabello and Varona treat about?—A. In the first place, the payment of the crew, and the selection of a successor to myself; and altogether recognized the Cubans there represented by Quesada and Varona as the parties who had all to say about the vessel.\n\n34.\n\nQ. Were you present at any of these treaties or conferences?—A. I was, once or twice.\n\n35.\n\nQ. Did you hear these things done, of which you have just spoken?—A. I did. Yet I would say that in the matters of papers and of records in this matter, all the technical formalities were not lost sight of in connection with it.\n\n36.\n\nQ. Did Varona or Quesada have any conversation with you at any time while captain in respect to changing the flag of the Virginius?—A. They did.\n\n37.\n\nQ. Please state that conversation as carefully and correctly as you can, and state when and where it occurred.—A. I will make a preface to it by saying that at the island of Buen Ayre, where the guns were taken on board from the schooner Billy Butts, the crew manifested a natural desire to know what was to be done with the guns, and what compensation they would get for the risk of carrying those guns to Cuba, if such was the intention; made an agreement with General Quesada for the prepayment to them of certain sums per capita, and a certain other sum; the first to be paid in advance and placed in my hands, which was done, the last being received by them after the vessel should have successfully made the landing or otherwise run the Cuban blockade. It was nearly two months after this that General Quesada, through Ms representative Varona, (who spoke English,) addressed the crew on the deck of my ship, stating that this contract was to be annulled; that the vessel would have to perform for the present other service, and that it might become necessary to change the flag; and under these altered circumstances he desired to know how many of the crew would remain by the ship and obey his orders. About this juncture of his address I interrupted him by demurring slightly to the proposition to change the flag, or to alter at that time, or any time, the exact nature of the enterprise for which I was employed in New York; and receiving verbally no satisfactory reply, I wrote Quesada a letter stating these intimated changes as the ground of my suspicions, and requesting him to state positively whether my suspicions were groundless or not; and stating that if such change ware meditated Would turn the vessel over to him, recognizing her as his property. I did not in this letter say anything as to the formal ownership of the vessel; but in conversation with him through an interpreter, and with several of the Cubans, I gave him to understand that, though I should abandon the enterprise then, I should take no advantage of the fact that she bore the American flag, and that she was nominally owned by an American citizen, and would not interrupt them in any enterprise they saw fit to engage in looking to the liberation of Cuba. I would say, incidentally, that this change, of which they would not say anything in writing, was talked about between themselves and myself; that change meant assistance to the government of Guzman Blanco, or to Venezuela, for the reason that when the revolution was put down Guzman Blanco would give them men and otherwise assist them in getting to Cuba.\n\n38.\n\nQ. What answer did Quesada make to that letter?—A. His answers were vague. He did not state what the change was, but said that it was to be a radical change. Queseda did not state that in writing, but verbally. He did answer my letter in writing.\n\n39.\n\nQ. How soon after this occurrence did you leave the Virginius?—A. That instant.\n\n40.\n\nQ. Where was this?—A. Puerto Cabello, Venezuela.\n\n41.\n\nQ. Did they pay you for your services up to that time?—A. But partially.\n\n42.\n\nQ. How much, if you remember?—A, About five hundred dollars in all, I think.\n\n43.\n\nQ. Who paid you the money?—A. A portion of it Mr. Patterson gave me a check for, before I sailed from New York; the remainder I got in small sums from Quesada. I had quite a large amount, I forget now how much, which I turned over to him immediately on resigning the command of the vessel, and also this draft that was given to me for the crew when they threatened to mutiny.\n\n44.\n\nQ. Did you have any conversation with Patterson about the ownership of the Virginius after you returned to New York from Puerto Cabello?—A. I did.\n\n45.\n\nQ. Please state what he said to you;—A. “When the aspect of affairs looked to the privilege which he might enjoy as the formal owner of the vessel, he then, in conversations, expressed to me regret that I did not bring the Virginius home; and at other times he fully indorsed the honesty of my action in allowing her to remain in the hands of those who had paid the money for her. He said to me at one time: “Damn it, she ain’t mine anyhow.” Both he and Roberts (though I never saw Roberts after I came back) did expect to be benefited in some way by the services of this vessel when she should have completed her mission of running the Cuban blockade.\n\n46.\n\nQ. Did you know how they intended to be benefited?—A. I do not know exactly how, though they could have run her in the Gulf. Their line at that time was ended; they never continued it afterward. They could have run her in the Gulf, between New Orleans and some ports of Florida, or perhaps to Havana, though that would be risky.\n\n47.\n\nQ. How did you understand that they were to use her, if Patterson and Roberts had parted with their property in her after she came back?—A. My impression is that they were to buy her back for a very small sum of money. My recollection of all these things is a little dim now, as I have been absent for a few years.\n\nBeing cross-examined by George Bliss, esq., United States attorney, he says:\n\n48.\n\nQ. What is your present occupation?—A. I am acting for the agent of a railroad; I am actually the agent, though there is another party nominally the agent. It is known as the Orange and Alexandria Railroad.\n\n49.\n\nQ. When and under what circumstances did you first become acquainted with Mr. Patterson?—A. When I brought the steamer Mary from Mobile to New York, in the summer of 1870, he at that time being the agent in New York of the joint lines of railroad and steamers, of which she was one, to Mobile, Ala., from New York.\n\n50.\n\nQ. You say that after your return Mr. Patterson showed you the bills?—A. Mr. Mora.\n\n51.\n\nQ. Mr. Mora showed you the bills. Was one of them for the purchase-money of the vessel?—A. That is my recollection now, though whether it was in the form of a bill of sale, or not, I do not know. I feel satisfied that that was an item shown to me among the list of moneys paid to Patterson.\n\n52.\n\nQ. Do you remember the amount?—A. I do not.\n\n53.\n\nQ. Can you give any impression upon it?—A. I am under the impresssion that it was some nine thousand dollars; about that. That is my impression. It was the largest amount in the list; that is my impression. I once or twice asked Roberts what he gave for her, before I ever heard of this thing, and I don’t think he ever answered the question.\n\n54.\n\nQ. Might it not have been an item of the amount paid by Patterson in the purchase of the vessel by him?—A. That I do not know, but I will state this: that Mora’s manner and intention, expressed at the time, by showing me these bills, was to convey the idea upon my mind that a large amount of money had been expended for this expedition, in proof of which he showed me these itemized payments, the particular items of which I have now forgotten. That is about as clear as I can put it.\n\n55.\n\nQ. This conversation with Consul Faxon, under what circumstances did it occur?—A. In going from his office in Curaçoa, across a lagoon to visit a family to whom he was going to introduce me.\n\n56.\n\nQ. Did he state what he understood the object of her mission to be?—A. He expressed to me that he understood what she was going to do. That he said she was going to Cuba I do not now remember, but that he clearly understood what was to be done; that in his official capacity he saw nothing wrong in the vessel, and that personally he was in sympathy with the enterprise. As consul he was guarded, I think, not to allow his official capacity to conflict with his personal feeling, and therefore did not express himself very plainly, as I recollect.\n\n57.\n\nQ. It was not the consul at Puerto Cabello who asked about her employment in the Venezuelan service?—A. No; the consul at Laguayra, I mean.\n\n58.\n\nQ. Did that consul at Laguayra inquire about her employment many other service?—A. He did not.\n\n59.\n\nQ. Did not?—A. No, sir; he did not say anything about it.\n\n60.\n\nQ. Was it the consul at Puerto Cabello or at Laguayra whom you have referred to as treating with Quesada and Varona with reference to the vessel?—A. The consul at Puerto Cabello.\n\n61.\n\nQ. Give his name.—A. Lacomb; of French descent, though I believe a native of this country.\n\n62.\n\nQ. Precisely when did the address by Varona as to changing the flag take place?— A. I will have to refer to notes of mine at home to tell the time. It was in November.\n\n63.\n\nQ. November, 1870?—A. November, 1870.\n\n64.\n\nQ. At the time that Varona addressed the crew was Quesada present?—A. He was.\n\n65.\n\nQ. Did Quesada understand English?—A. When spoken slowly he could understand a conversation.\n\n66.\n\nQ. The intention referred to of changing the flag was to change it to the Venezuelan, was it?—A. That was the rumor, though that was not expressed.\n\n67.\n\nQ. Was anything said about her ever flying the Cuban flag, of an intent to fly the Cuban flag at any time?—A. There was a suggestion made to me as to the propriety of doing so, by Varona, coming from Quesada, but hot this Varona that made this speech, but by Dr. Varona. The suggestion was made to me, on the voyage out, to use the Cuban flag and to board and capture a vessel then in sight, if she should turn out to be Spanish. I said the Cuban flag should not be used. But I told them they could very easily overpower me, meaning that I would give my consent to being overpowered, and they could tie me in the cabin, and lower the boats and capture this vessel.\n\n68.\n\nQ. How did it happen that you were not paid in full?—A. For the reason that the absence of written agreement in New York left me to depend upon men without honor to pay me by virtue of a verbal understanding between them and me.\n\n69.\n\nQ. Then they claimed they had paid you in full, did they?—A. Yes.\n\n70.\n\nQ. What was your view of the amount they had agreed to pay—by the month or voyage, whatever it was?—A. Well, it is a long matter.\n\n71.\n\nQ. I merely want to know what the amount was.—A. It was subjected to various contingencies. For instance: I said to them, “Gentlemen, if I undertake this thing, mark you, I go at great risk. I know the Spanish will shoot me, therefore I run great risk. I run the risk of the crew mutinying, and my going to subject American citizens to danger. But/’ says I, “lam ready, and at all times ready, to undertake this thing; but if you do not furnish me with the means, mark you, I have in spirit fulfilled my agreement with you; and, therefore, you must pay me, in consideration of that, something.” And then I was to get—I have forgotten now—several thousand dollars, in case I succeeded; I think it was five, if I succeeded in running the blockade. I have forgotten the amount; several amounts were talked over. But I was to have for all the time I was gone double pay; but my pay was only to be put down at $150 a month, in order not to excite suspicion at the custom-house by so high pay for so small a vessel. They all understood that.\n\n72.\n\nQ. You said in your former deposition that Mora informed this deponent that the steamer Virginius was the property of certain Cubans together, and represented by Mora, Queseda, and Manuel Ruiz, and they explained to you in part the manner in which the funds were raised for the purchase of the steamer and the disbursements of her voyage and enterprise. When did he so inform you? Before you sailed or after you returned?—A. My impression is that he did this. I so understood it from him before, and so understood it from conversations with him afterward.\n\n73.\n\nQ. My question is directed particularly to his explanation to you in part of the manner in which the funds were raised. Was that before or after you went?—A. After, I think.\n\n74.\n\nQ. What did he say to you as to the manner in which the funds were raised?—A. My recollection is, through subscriptions made here in New York, moneys raised by Quesada in Europe, and the sacrifice of trinkets and jewelry by the ladies sympathizing with Cuba. That is my recollection.\n\n75.\n\nQ. Were you aboard the vessel at the time when the marine lawyer, Gallagher, made the complaint to some consul?—A. I was not.\n\n76.\n\nQ. Was that after you left?—A. That was after I left.\n\n77.\n\nQ. Do you know any reason why, after taking aboard the cargo of the Billy Butts at Buenos Ayres, the vessel did not undertake to run the blockade?—A. I understood the delay then to be the want of soldiers to accompany the landing.\n\n78.\n\nQ. Did you understand that she went to Venezuela for the purpose of getting soldiers?—A. When I sailed from New York I knew she was going to that section of the Caribbean Sea, to fall in with men and arms. Did not know where the arms were to come from or the men. Did not at sailing suppose they were to be enlisted in Venezuela. My first impression was that they were to be Cuban patriots, who had lodged on this island, wishing an opportunity to avenge their country’s wrongs.\n\n79.\n\nQ. But when you left Curaçoa, or left that vicinity, after taking the arms on board, did you then understand that she was going to Venezuela for soldiers?—A. My recollection is that that was then my impression.\n\n80.\n\nQ. Did you ever know of any attempt being made to get soldiers?—A. I heard of it frequently from Varona and from Quesada; and Quesada, in the little English that he talked, expressed to me his great regret of the revolution then existing in Venezuela, and there was a general regret expressed on the part of his compatriots that the existence of this revolution deterred the running of the Cuban blockade at that time.\n\nF. E. SHEPPERD.\n\nJOSEPH GUTMAN, Jr.,\n\nUnited States, Commissioner, Southern District of New York.\n\n[Page 1013]\n\n[seal.]\n\nJOSEPH GUTMAN, Jr.,\n\nUnited States Commissioner, Southern District of New York.\n\n[Inclosure 5.]\n\nAffidavit of Francis Bowen.\n\nUnited States of America,\n\nSouthern District of New York, ss:\n\nTo all to whom these presents shall come:\n\nI, Joseph Gutman, jr., a commissioner of the United States circuit court for the southern district of New York, duly appointed and commissioned, and dwelling in the city of New York, send greeting:\n\nKnow ye, that on the twenty-sixth day of November, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and seventy-three, before me, at my office No. 29 Nassau street, in the city of New York, appeared as a witness Francis Bowen, a mariner, formerly on board the steamship Virginius, produced by the consul-general of Spain for the district of New York, in the United States of America, and that I was attended at the same time by Sidney Webster, esq., counselor at law in said city, representing the aforesaid consul-general of Spain, and George Bliss, esq., attorney of the United States for the southern district of New York, attending by the direction of the Secretary of State of the United States, and that the aforesaid witness having been first duly cautioned by me to declare the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth in respect to the matters concerning which he should be interrogated, and having then been duly sworn by me according to the laws of the United States, and the following affidavit made by the said Bowen before H. J. Begly, esq., having been delivered in my presence into the hands of Mr. Bliss, did, in answer to the interrogatories addressed to him in my presence, voluntarily, freely, and solemnly declare and depose in my presence as follows, that is to say:\n\nSouthern District of New York, ss:\n\nFrancis Bowen, being duly sworn, deposes and says: That he is by profession a master-mariner, was born in the State of New York, is forty-nine years of age, and is at present residing in the city of New York; that he has followed the sea as a profession for upward of thirty-two years, and commanded vessels since twenty-two years; that among the vessels he has commanded are the barks Comet, Sultana, and Jane, the brig Victorine, the clipper-ships Kate Hooper and Nightingale, the schooner Mariguita, the steamships Vera Cruz and J. C. Harris, and many small steamers in China; that he was first officer in the Pacific mail-steamer Colon from April 1, 18/3, to about September of the same year.\n\nAnd this deponent further says, that on the last of March or first of April, in the year 1872, he assumed command of the steamship Virginius at Aspinwall, and continued in command of her from that date till the latter part of June, in the same year, when he left her at Puerto Cabello; that the commander of the said steamer who immediately preceded him therein was one Marquez, and engineer on said steamer, but not a seaman, and that he was informed and believes that the person in command of said steamer immediately before the last-named, Marquez, was a Venezuelan or a Cuban, and that the commander immediately preceding the last-named person was Capt. F. E. Shepperd.\n\nAnd this deponent further says, that in March, 1872, he was at Panama, on his way from New York to China, and while there his attention was called to the Virginius by her previous captain, Marquez, before mentioned, who said she was in need of a commander, and this deponent replied that he would take command of her if well paid, and the said Marquez referred this deponent to Rafael Quesada, then in Panama, a brother of Gen. Manuel Quesada, now of the city of New York; that this deponent had an interview with the said Rafael Quesada, who informed him that he could not make any agreement for a commander, but this deponent must see his brother, the aforesaid Manuel Quesada, who was at Aspinwall; and this deponent did thereupon go to Aspinwall, and did there have an interview with the said Manuel Quesada, at the Betan Court Hotel, in Aspinwall.\n\n[Page 1014]\n\nAnd this deponent further says, that on the interview he had with the said Manuel Quesada, a Cuban named Pedro or Francia Alfaro was present as a chief executive Officer or business man; that this deponent, at that interview, asked the said Manuel Quesada in what business the Virginius was to be engaged, when and what sum he would pay this deponent to be captain; that to this question the said Manual Quesada replied that the steamer was to attempt to land an expedition on the coast of Cuba, and that he would pay this deponent three hundred dollars a month to be captain, and an advance of two hundred dollars; and if an expedition was successfully landed in Cuba, he would give this deponent $5,000 in addition, beside his pay as aforesaid, and perhaps a larger sum; and the said Quesada also said to this deponent that if an expedition was landed safely in Cuba, everything would then be very prosperous with the Cuban junta in New York, and this deponent should command a new ship, and one armed as a privateer.\n\nThat this deponent did at that interview engage and hire himself to command the said steamer, and that he entered into the arrangement with the said Manuel Quesada as controlling the said steamer, and that he never knew or saw any one then or at any time who assumed any control over her; and thereupon the said Manuel Quesada took this deponent on board the Virginius, then lying at Aspinwall, and presented him to the engineers, and all the persons on board, as the commander of the steamer.\n\nThat this deponent immediately took command of the said steamer, and found that a large number of Cubans, said to be fifty or sixty, living in barracks near by, were supplied each day with provisions from the said steamer; that when this deponent took command there was no American flag on the steamer, but one was purchased by him; that no concealment was practiced by this deponent, either with the consul of the United States then in Aspinwall, or with any other person, in respect to the character and destination of the said steamer; and that on or about the first of May, or last of April, he cleared the steamer before the United States consul; and this deponent sailed without any verbal orders from the said Manuel Quesada, except instructions from him that he had given sealed instructions to the aforesaid Alfaro, who would be on board, and that when said instructions should be opened at sea they were to be obeyed; that the said Alfaro did sail on board the steamer, together with a few other Cubans, and a large number of bags of clothing; that the Spanish steamer Pizarro was then lying in the port of Aspinwall, and, on the suggestion of the consul of the United States, the United States steamer Kansas, which arrived in Aspinwall about this time, escorted the Virginius outside the port, followed also by the aforesaid steamer Pizarro; and when this deponent had got well to sea, the sealed orders in the hands of the said Alfaro were opened, and found to be signed by the said Manuel Quesada, who directed the steamer to proceed to Carthagena, and there await further orders.\n\nThat this deponent had frequent conversations with one Perry, then consul or consular agent of the United States at Aspinwall, in respect to the character and the business of the steamer Virginius, and that the said consul perfectly understood the character of her employment, and who controlled her.\n\nThat when the Virginius arrived in the port of Carthagena there was much exultation on the part of certain people there who knew of the character of the steamer; that the crew became mutinous, and this deponent applied to the United States consul or consular agent, who procured them to be placed in prison; that the said consul or consular agent was perfectly well aware of the character of the business in which the said steamer was engaged, as this deponent knows by conversation with him; that after repairing the steamer, and taking in coal, she proceeded, by the direction of Alfaro, to Puerto Cabello.\n\nThat when the Virginius arrived at Puerto Cabello, as aforesaid, she was out of coal and leaking badly in both compartments; that the said Manuel Quesada soon after arrived in that place; that it was impossible to make the needed repairs on her, nor was there any money forthcoming with which to buy necessary provisions and supplies for the steamer, and all her crew, together with the chief engineer, were discharged, there being retained on board only two Cuban engineers, one named Chamberlain and another named Knight, both of whom the newspapers say were on board the Virginius, and recently executed at Santiago de Cuba; and that this deponent thereupon resigned his command of said steamer, and shortly after left for Caracas, from which place he returned to Puerto Cabello two months afterward, remained there a week, and then proceeded to New York, after which this deponent became first officer, as aforesaid, of the Pacific mail-steamer Colon.\n\nThat this deponent was informed while at Puerto Cabello, and believes, that the Virginius had a few months previously been at that port, and in the service of Guzman Blanco, then engaged in civil war in that country; that while at Puerto Cabello this deponent had frequent cenversations with the American consul, and the latter admitted and stated to this deponent that he was perfectly aware of the business in which the Virginius was engaged; that on several occasions this deponent appeared before the said consul in company with the said Manuel Quesada in respect to the affairs of the said steamer, and particularly in respect to discharging her crew, at which said [Page 1015] interviews the said consul could not fail to see, in the opinion of this deponent, that the said Quesada was the manager and sole controller of the said steamer as owner, and that while the said steamer was lying at Puerto Cabello, as aforesaid, orders were issued that no supplies of any kind should be furnished to the steamer unless on written orders, signed by the said Manuel Quesada or the said Alfaro.\n\nAnd this deponent further says, that during the time he was in command of the said steamer he never saw any mark of her number or of her tonnage carved or marked on her main beam, as required by the laws of the United States, and he never heard until quite recently that she had any number, and that the said steamer had been lying at Aspinwall for about six months previous to this deponent assuming command thereof; and this deponent further solemnly declares that, during all the time he was in command of the said steamer, he never supposed or believed that she was under any other control than that of the aforesaid Manuel Quesada in behalf of the Cubans, nor did he ever suppose or believe that the steamer was to be engaged in any legitimate business.\n\nFRS. BOWEN.\n\nH. J. BEGLY,\n\nNotary Public, Kings County, New York.\n\nBeing cross-examined by George Bliss, United States district attorney, he says:\n\n1.\n\nQuestion.

Where did you take command of her?—A. In Aspinwall.\n\n7.\n\nQ. How long were you in command of her in Aspinwall before she left Aspinwall?—A. Over a month; but I can’t give the exact date.\n\n8.\n\nQ. How long did she lie at Carthagena?—A. Over ten days.\n\n9.\n\nQ. How long at Puerto Cabello before you left her?—A.

While you were at Carthagena what were you doing?—A. Repairing the ship. She sprung a leak, and it was necessary to repair that leak, and take in coal.\n\n13.\n\nQ. While at Puerto Cabello what was she doing?—A. Nothing.\n\n14.\n\nQ. How large a crew did you have?—A. We were very short-handed. I think we had about six deck-hands, and about nine in the fire-room.\n\n15.\n\nQ. That included engineers?—A. Three engineers besides that, and some water-tenders who were Cubans.\n\n16.\n\nQ. Did you have any armament?—A. No.\n\n17.\n\nQ. No guns?—A. No large guns.\n\n18.\n\nQ. What do you mean by “large guns?”—A. Cannon. We had some muskets and pistols.\n\n19.\n\nQ.-How many?—A.
