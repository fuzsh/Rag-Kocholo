She is surrounded by images that include the iconic logo of the Michelin Man, a still from the movie “Ponyo” and a stock photograph of a blowfish.\n\nThe page zooms to show a photograph of a performer from Missy Elliott’s tour: she wears a purple bodysuit and her hair is cut in a short white bob. Next to this, a still from a movie in which a woman with red bobbed hair wears a skimpy white bodysuit."
