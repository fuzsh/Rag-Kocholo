        "text": "Derek Puffer has been found not criminally responsible for the deaths of his mother and stepfather.\n\nA Calgary justice has ruled the 40-year-old has an acute mental disorder.\n\nPuffer stabbed Donna Lee Powers and her husband, well-known sportscaster Bill Powers, while they were sleeping in their Braeside home last July.\n\nThe couple had been stabbed 25 times.\n\nDuring the trial, the court was told Puffer had heard voices that told him to kill the couple.\n\nThe court also heard that Puffer had been found by police that night at a nearby bus stop. He was naked inside the bus shelter and had blood on his hands.\n\nPuffer told police that the Powers had put a computer chip in his brain.\n\nHe did not have a history of violence but in an agreed statement of facts, the court heard Bill Powers had expressed concern to several people about his safety around Puffer.\n\nPuffer was diagnosed with schizophrenia in his 20s but it went untreated for 20 years."
