Depending on the scenario, the inspector may use inspector powers described in the Operational guideline – Food regulatory response guidelines to apply one of the following:\n\nseize and detain the imported food\n\norder the imported food be removed or destroyed\n\nseize and detain the imported food and order the food be removed or destroyed\n\nFactors that inspectors should consider when determining appropriate response include:\n\nthe conditions identified in the relevant provisions\n\nthe impact of the inspector's decision and if it will achieve the desired outcome\n\nFor example, if an inspector decides to order removal or destruction of an imported food that presents a risk of injury to human health, the provisions set out in SFCA ss.32(4) and ss.32(5) do not allow for the suspension of the application of forfeiture cancellation of the notice to remove or destroy, thereby eliminating any opportunity for corrective measures to be taken after the order has been issued.\n\nIf the inspector decides to order removal or destruction of the imported food as a response to the non-compliance, complete and issue the notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports to the importer, owner or the person having possession, control or care of the food (hereafter referred as \"importer\" or \"owner\"). Refer to section 6.3 – Completing the notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports.\n\nIf the inspector decides not to order removal or destruction, refer to the Operational guideline: Assessing, monitoring and documenting the disposition of non-compliant food.\n\n6.3 Completing the notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports\n\nComplete the template \"Notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports\" in Appendix 1. Provide detailed information for all the listed fields. Determine who will receive this notice (importer or owner or person having possession, care or control of the food in Canada) and address it to the appropriate person in Canada. For non-resident importers, the notice must be addressed to the owner or the person having possession, control or care of the food in Canada. Consult the Safe Food for Canadians Licence Registry to obtain the most updated address for the importer. Sign and date the notice and attach any documents required.\n\n6.4 Correcting the notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports\n\nIf a notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports has been issued to the importer and there is an administrative error on the form, determine the appropriate way to correct the error.\n\nExamples of administrative errors may include, but are not limited to:\n\nincorrect issue date or date to remove or destroy the non-compliant product\n\nerrors with the regulated party's name or address\n\nincorrect act or regulation\n\nThe following steps should be used when correcting administrative errors on the notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports:\n\nissue a new notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports with the correct information and add a note at the bottom of the document stating the notice has been revised and the justification for the amendment (for example, \"This notice replaces the previously issued notice due to the following reason(s)\")\n\nthe original date of issuance remains the same, unless the original date of issuance requires correction\n\nmake sure the importer is aware that the old notice is replaced by a new notice and that the product is still ordered to be removed or destroyed\n\nif other parties have received a copy of the original, they should receive a copy of the new notice with the corrections\n\nrecord corrections made to the notice and related documents as per section 6.10 Recording inspection results\n\nNote: Once the notice to remove or destroy unlawful food imports has been issued, there are no provisions prescribed in the act to allow the extension of the date to remove or destroy the product. An imported food commodity is forfeited if it is not removed or destroyed within the specified time period or within 90 days after being notified that removal or destruction was required.\n\nThe inspector may submit an electronic Request for Action Form (e-RAF) to obtain support in determining the appropriate correction.\n\n6.5 Delivering the notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports\n\nOnce the template is completed, deliver the notice in one of the following ways:\n\ndeliver the notice in person to the owner or importer of the food [SFCA s.32(2), (HAA s. 18(2)]\n\nsend the notice by registered mail to the owner's or importer's address in Canada [SFCA s.32(2), (HAA s.18(2)]\n\ndeliver in person or by any method that provides proof of delivery or by any prescribed methods [FDA s.27.2]\n\nfor non-resident importers without an address in Canada, the notice must be sent to the address of the owner or the person having possession, care or control of the food in Canada\n\nRegistered mail is a delivery service to customers who require proof of mailing and/or proof of delivery and provides shipment tracking information.\n\n6.6 Follow up\n\nFollow up with the importer or owner to ensure they received the notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports, understand it and what is their response to the notice. Follow up may occur anytime between the date the notice was sent and the date specified on the notice or 90 days from the date the notice was sent (if no date specified). However, follow up should be done as soon as possible.\n\n6.6.1 Removal of unlawful food imports from Canada\n\nFor unlawful foods that will be removed from Canada:\n\ncomplete sections 1 and 2 of form CFIA/ACIA 4320 Record of Actions to Remove Non-compliant Imported Food from Canada (accessible only on the Government of Canada network) with applicable information\n\nprovide the importer or owner with a copy of the completed form CFIA/ACIA 4320\n\nprovide a copy of form CFIA/ACIA 4320 to the Area Operations Specialist (AOS)\n\nprior to exiting Canada, request the importer or owner to provide proof of exit from Canada\n\ndocuments providing proof of exit from Canada should include container and seal numbers (where applicable) to compare with information on form 4320\n\nexamples of acceptable documents include:\n\na copy of the official bill of lading or airway bill of lading showing amounts, destination and carriers (it should clearly indicate the transportation to the destination)\n\ndocument stamped by the Customs foreign authorities\n\nnotification from foreign country where food was returned to\n\nForm E15 (certificate of destruction/exportation) from Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) (this form must be signed/stamped by CBSA as proof that CBSA received and acknowledged it)\n\nwhen the shipment is presented for removal, verify the information against the notice\n\nFor meat shipments, in addition to the steps above:\n\naffix the CFIA seal once the food is loaded in the transport conveyance\n\nenter the CFIA seal number in the appropriate field on form CFIA/ACIA 4320\n\nfor imported meat from the USA that is refused entry and ordered to be removed:\n\nemail a copy of form CFIA/ACIA 4320 Record of Actions to Remove Non-compliant Imported Food from Canada (accessible only on the Government of Canada network) to:\n\nDirector Import Export Programs\n\nOffice of International Affairs\n\nUSDA/FSIS Washington D.C – USReturnedExports@usda.gov\n\nMeat shipments being removed from Canada may require a CFIA seal. Seal application should be based on requirements of the Foreign Competent Authority (FCA). Refused/returned shipments of food (other than meat) may or may not require a seal on the returned shipment based on the requirements of the receiving country.\n\n6.6.2 Destruction of unlawful food imports\n\nThe authority to order destruction of food applies only if removal is not possible. Examples where removal of unlawful food imports are not possible can include, but are not limited to:\n\ncountry of origin is refusing the return of the unlawful food product\n\nthe unlawful food presents a risk of contamination to the environment, animal or food source or there is a risk of injury to human or animal health\n\nthe food is perishable or the shelf life of the product has elapsed\n\nIf removal of the unlawful food is not possible, the importer or owner must be able to demonstrate that:\n\ndestruction of the food will not introduce any risk of contamination to the environment, animal, and food sources or cause injury to human or animal health\n\ndestruction methods do not contravene any health of animals acts or regulations\n\nAll costs related to the destruction are at the importer or owner's expense. The destruction may or may not be conducted under an inspector's supervision. Considerations listed below can help the inspector in this decision. Animal and plant health waste disposal requirements may apply.\n\nIf removal of the unlawful food is not possible, a CFIA inspector should:\n\nassess the method of disposal proposed by the importer or owner\n\nif required, consult with Supervisor, AOS or Operational Guidance Expertise (OGE) for an assessment of destruction method\n\nensure animal products are destroyed in compliance with the International Waste Directive (if applicable)\n\nif the food will be moved to a different location for destruction, refer to Operational procedure – procedure for seizure and detention, authorizing movement and disposition\n\ndetermine if the destruction of food should be witnessed by a CFIA inspector by considering the following:\n\nis the non-compliance related to food fraud\n\nis the regulated party reluctant to destroy the non-compliant product\n\nis the regulated party able to provide a valid proof of destruction (for example: certificate of destruction from a waste company, pictures, insurance claims, landfill receipt, or videos of product being removed from package and disposed)\n\nis the product being disposed at an approved waste facility (for example: an international waste site)\n\nare there certain conditions that limit the inspector's ability to witness disposal such as accessibility of the site, distance, etc.\n\nobtain proof of destruction\n\nNote: A food that is seized or detained, cannot be released from detention prior to being removed or destroyed. Inspectors may authorize the movement of the food to the port of exit or destruction site, but the food must remain under detention.\n\n6.6.3 Voluntary Forfeiture of unlawful food imports\n\nThe importer or owner of the imported food may consent to forfeit a thing that was seized. This is considered a voluntary forfeiture [(SFCA s.35, FDA s.27(1), HAA 46(2)]. Refer to section 6.2.6 forfeiture of a thing (automatic, by consent or by Minister's election) of the Operational guideline – Food regulatory response guidelines.\n\n6.6.4 Importer or owner does not take any action within the date specified on the notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports or within 90 days (if no date was specified)\n\nIf no action is taken by the importer or owner within the time specified on the notice or if no period was specified, within 90 days after the date on which the notice was delivered or sent, the food commodity is automatically forfeited to her Majesty in right of Canada and may be disposed, as the Minister may direct [(SFCA s. 32(3), FDA s.27.2 (3) or HAA s.18 (3)]. Refer to section 6.2.6 forfeiture of a thing (automatic, by consent or by Minister's election) of the Operational Guideline – Food regulatory response guideline.\n\nWhen a food is forfeited to her Majesty under SFCA s. 32(3), FDA s.27.2 (3), or HAA s. 18(3), the Crown becomes owner of the food and may take possession and move the food to a different location. The food may remain at the location of the regulated party only if they consent to store the food at that location until further action is taken.\n\nThere is no specific mechanism set out in the legislation regarding disposal of a forfeited food. The Minister has the discretion to decide how to dispose of a thing after it has been forfeited. The authority to dispose forfeited food is delegated to the Inspection Manager and the Director of Operations.\n\nWhile the disposal of the food is at the expense of the regulated party, there is no legal authority that would compel the regulated party to dispose of the food on the Crown's behalf.\n\nInspectors should refer to the Operational guideline – Food regulatory response guidelines prior to a forfeiture taking effect.\n\n6.7 Suspending application of forfeiture\n\nAn inspector may suspend the application of forfeiture under the SFCA s.32(4), FDA s.27.2(4), or HAA s.18(4).\n\nThe suspension of forfeiture must be initiated prior to the date on which the forfeiture is automatically triggered. This is the date specified on the notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports or if not date is specified, 90 days after the day the notice was delivered or sent. Once the application of forfeiture is suspended, the notice to remove or destroy is still valid, but the food is not forfeited to her Majesty.\n\nNote: While suspension is initiated earlier, it will only have legal effect once the notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports (or 90 days) has expired. Forfeiture only occurs once the notice to remove or destroy has expired.\n\nFollowing suspension of the application of forfeiture, the importer or owner of the food is given an opportunity to bring the food into compliance. The duration of suspension will be determined by the inspector based on the details of the case. Prior to suspending the application of forfeiture, the inspector must be satisfied that the requirements of SFCA s.32(4), FDA s. 27.2(4), or HAA s.18(4) are met.\n\nWhen determining to suspend an application of forfeiture, consider the factors in Table 1.\n\nOnce it is determined to suspend the application of forfeiture:\n\ncomplete the Notice to suspend an application of forfeiture and/or cancel a Notice to remove or destroy unlawful import template in Appendix 3\n\nattach a copy of the notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports that was issued to the importer or owner to the suspension notice\n\ndeliver the suspension notice and supporting attachments in person or send by email to the importer or owner of the food\n\nfollow up with the importer or owner to ensure actions will be completed before the expiry date of suspension\n\nIf the food is not brought into compliance by the end of the suspension period, and the notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports (or 90 days) has expired, it will automatically be forfeited to her Majesty and may be destroyed at cost to the importer or owner.\n\nAfter the food is brought into compliance and before the expiry date of suspension, if the inspector is satisfied that requirements of SFCA s.32(5), FDA s.27.2(5), or HAA s.18 (5) are met, the inspector can move to cancel the notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports.\n\n6.8 Cancelling the notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports\n\nAfter the importer or owner of the food, to whom the notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports was issued, has brought the food into compliance, and the inspector is satisfied that the requirements of SFCA s. 32(5), FDA s. 27.2(5), or HAA s.18(5) are met, the inspector may cancel the notice.\n\nNote: It is not necessary to suspend the forfeiture of the application, before cancelling the notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports. The inspector may cancel the notice without suspending the forfeiture of the application, only after the requirements of SFCA s.32(5), FDA s. 27.2(5), or HAA s.18(5) are met.\n\nIf the notice is cancelled following the suspension of application of forfeiture:\n\nensure the notice is cancelled before the expiry date of the suspension period\n\nIf the notice is cancelled without suspending the application of forfeiture:\n\nensure the notice is cancelled within the period specified on the notice, if no period specified, the period that ends 90 days after the day on which the notice was delivered or sent\n\nWhen determining to cancel a notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports, consider the factors in Table 1.\n\nOnce it is determined to cancel a notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports:\n\ncomplete the notice to suspend an application of forfeiture and/or cancel a notice to remove or destroy unlawful import template in Appendix 3.\n\nattach a copy of the notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports that was issued to the importer or owner to the cancelation notice\n\ndeliver the cancellation notice and supporting attachments in person or send via email to the importer or owner of the food to whom the notice to remove or destroy was issued\n\n6.9 Communicating information related to shipments ordered removed or destroyed\n\nNotify the AOS of all shipments of imported foods for which a notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports was issued, and the food was removed from Canada or destroyed. For meat related issues, the AOS notifies the Food Import Export Division (FIED) via MPDImport@inspection.gc.ca email account. For issues related to all other foods, the AOS notifies FIED via cfia.foodimport-alimentsimportes.acia@inspection.gc.ca.\n\nThe AOS forwards all the following information to the FIED:\n\nOfficial Meat Inspection Certificate (OMIC) (meat only)\n\nImport Inspection Report (IIR) or inspection report\n\nsupporting documents and pictures\n\nLaboratory Sample Tracking System (LSTS) report\n\nFIED may request additional information/documentation from the AOS and will make the decision, on a case-by-case basis, whether to report the import violation to the Foreign Competent Authorities of the exporting country.\n\n6.10 Recording inspection results\n\nFor inspections documented in the Digital Service Delivery Platform (DSDP):\n\nenter the details of the removal or destruction of the unlawful food import in the DSDP by referring to SIP section A.5.5.2 Capture regulatory response actions and DSDP Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) Managing a Non-Compliance Record (accessible only on the Government of Canada network – RDIMS 9906406)\n\nin the Non-compliance Response Details tab add a new Regulatory Response and select the Regulatory Response Type: Removal from Canada or if unable to be removed, select Destroy\n\nsince, at this step in the process, the removal or destruction of the unlawful food import details are being entered after the decision to remove or destroy has been made, select the Response Status: Issued\n\nat a minimum, add copies of all supporting documents (for example, copies of notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports, records of actions to remove non-compliant imported food from Canada, etc.) to the Documents sub-grid within the new regulatory response record\n\nIf the import inspection is triggered by the Import control tracking system (ICTS), enter inspection results in ICTS.\n\nNote: A \"Record of actions to remove non-compliant imported food from Canada\" must be completed for all shipments of food that are removed from Canada or destroyed (including voluntary removal or destruction of unlawfully imported food) whether or not a notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports has been issued to the importer or owner of the food. This ensures that an accurate history of non-compliance is kept on file.\n\nIf the foreign competent authority of the country where food is being sent requires a copy of the notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports, then a notice must be issued for voluntary returns of unlawful imports to satisfy the importing country requirements. If they are voluntarily returning a product that has not been found to be unlawfully imported, then a notice to remove or destroy cannot be issued.\n\n7.0 Appendices\n\nAppendix 1: Notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports (accessible only on the Government of Canada network – RDIMS 11268152)\n\nAppendix 2: Record of actions to remove non-compliant imported food from Canada – (Form 4320)\n\nAppendix 3: Notice to suspend application of forfeiture or cancel a notice to remove or destroy unlawful imports (accessible only on the Government of Canada network – RDIMS 12198941)"
