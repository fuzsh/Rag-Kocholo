        "text": "Derek Puffer of Calgary has pleaded not guilty in the killing of his mother and his stepfather, well-known sportscaster Bill Powers.\n\nPuffer's trial began Monday in a Calgary courtroom. He formally pleaded not guilty in the deaths of Bill and Donna Lee Powers.\n\nPuffer's lawyer says the issue in this case is not whether Puffer committed the crime, but whether he is not criminally responsible because of mental illness.\n\nBill Powers retired in October 2009 after almost 50 years in the sports broadcasting and communications business.\n\nThe couple were found dead in their Braeside home in July of last year. Bill Powers and his wife had been stabbed 25 times.\n\nThe court heard that Puffer, 40, was found that night naked with blood on his hands at a nearby bus shelter at 14th Street and Southland Drive.\n\nHe told police he had killed his mother and step-dad, and that he suffers from schizophrenia and hadn't taken his medication for nearly 20 years. He told police that the Powers had put a computer chip in his brain and that he was hearing voices asking him about a knife.\n\nConst. Michael Green, who found Puffer, described the accused as \"stoic, emotionless and calm â€¦ cool as a cucumber.\"\n\nThe court saw a video recording of an interview between police and Puffer after his arrest. He told detectives that he blacked out a lot and did irrational things. \"It hasn't registered that I killed them,\" Puffer said.\n\nPuffer did not have a history of violence, but in an agreed statement of facts read in court, Bill Powers had expressed concern to several people about his safety around Puffer.\n\nThe trial is expected to last all week."
