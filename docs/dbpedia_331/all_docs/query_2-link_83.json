        "text": "Undercover police officers \"surprised\" a cocaine dealer who was sitting on a sofa in a drugs den, a court has heard. The officers found Brightner Cassius after seeing two known Class A users in a Cardiff street who appeared to be \"looking to score\" drugs.\n\nCardiff Crown Court heard the 25-year-old defendant, who is from Montreal, has convictions for violence, weapons, and cocaine-trafficking matters in Canada. His barrister told the court his client wants to serve his sentence and be extradited back to Canada so he can see his child and begin to \"get his life back on track\".\n\nNuhu Gobir, prosecuting, said at 10.15pm on February 10 this year police officers from the organised crime team in Cardiff were in an unmarked car in Constellation Street in Adamsdown when they saw two known Class A drug users. Based on their behaviour the officers believed the pair were \"looking to score\" drugs. As the officers kept watch on the male and female in question they went into a house in nearby Zinc Street where they stayed for a couple of minutes before leaving. The undercover police officers followed the pair and stopped them and when searched they were found to be in possession of heroin.\n\nREAD MORE:Drug dealer who thought he was 'untouchable'' is now behind bars\n\nREAD MORE: Conman took thousands from elderly homeowners for work he never intended to do\n\nThe prosecutor said based on what they had seen and found the officers decided to carry out a search of the Zinc Street property. Officers entered the house via an insecure rear door and \"surprised\" Cassius who was sat on a sofa in the living room. Also in the property were the tenant and two other people. A search of the house turned up weighing scales with traces of powder and a tub of bicarbonate of soda. Cassius was found to have £355 in his tracksuit bottoms pocket and a key fob to another property.\n\nThe court heard that while officers were at the house a known drug user called Jamie arrived and the defendant \"tried to warn him\" by shouting out: \"Police! Police! Police!\". The prosecutor said Jamie was found with £30 \"gripped tightly in his hand\" and he told officers he had come to the house \"to check on a friend\". Cassius was arrested on suspicion of being concerned in the supply of Class A drugs.\n\nThe defendant's home address in Newport was then searched and officers found a 2.2g rock of crack cocaine – enough for 22 individual deals – along with £80 in cash and a Canadian passport. Cassius subsequently gave a \"no comment\" interview and provided a prepared statement in which he said the crack found at his house was for his own use and that he had gone to the property in Cardiff to buy drugs.\n\nBrightner Cassius, of Tewkesbury Walk, Newport, had previously pleaded guilty to possession of cocaine with intent to supply and possession of criminal property – the cash recovered from his pocket and at his home – when he appeared in the dock for sentencing. The court heard he has previous convictions for violence, possession of weapons and cocaine-trafficking matters from Canadian courts. William Bebb, for Cassius, said at the time of the offending the defendant was addicted to the drug he was supplying. He said while being held on remand the defendant had been helping other inmates with literacy and spelling issues in making online applications and he said the defendant wants to serve his sentence and be extradited back to Canada as soon as possible so he can see his child and begin to \"get his life back on track\".\n\nWith a 20% discount for his guilty pleas Recorder Christian Jowett sentenced Cassius to three years in prison. The recorder said defendants ordinarily serve up to half their sentences in custody before being released on licence to serve the remainder in the community but what would happen to Cassius was subject to the outstanding extradition matters."
