        "text": "✽\n\nThe story of the minority language Griko in Italy intertwines with the shape of my own life. Growing up, I heard this language spoken but did not, until my late 20s, learn to speak it. With that grounding, I initiated my anthropological research on the language, its history, and the current contexts of its use. Now I write poems first in Griko and translate them into Italian and English.\n\nWith Greek origins, Griko is currently only spoken in a few villages in Southern Italy, in the region of Apulia. People stopped transmitting it as a mother tongue after WWII in symbolic opposition to Italian, having believed over time in the inferiority of their language. Parents thought that teaching Italian to their children would help them live in a modern world.\n\nGriko speakers also spoke Salentine, a local variety based on Latin. Ironically, those locals who only spoke Salentine leveraged stereotypes, painting bilingual locals as unreliable and untrustworthy, or “people with two tongues and two faces.” The history of the language and the wealth of its origins in Greek were largely ignored.\n\nIn the 1990s, that changed. As I discuss in my 2021 book Greek Language, Italian Landscape: Griko and the Re-storying of a Linguistic Minority, cultural associations and other activist groups worked for decades to revive the language. In 1999, it was officially recognized as one among the 12 historical minority languages on Italian soil. In my work, I highlight the interplay of language ideologies and policies promoted by the EU, Italy, and also Greece to protect Griko. In addition, I shed light on how locals, interacting with these legal and symbolic changes, have renegotiated their feelings and perceptions about their language.\n\nI also stress how Griko has had breath and life in poetry. Indeed, it has reached us today in part through poems composed by locals who often see it as a language of the past. In Griko poetry, people feel they can best express timeless emotions and feelings. By contrast, they use other languages to describe modern life. So though you may not hear Griko in daily conversations, you can listen to Griko speakers recite their poetry as part of festivals or as shared on social media. These poets draw from a long, widespread tradition that authentically expresses the poetic lineage of the language.\n\nMy own poems in Griko pull from this tradition; they also reflect my anthropological research and my own experience. In one of my poems below, “Yet It Burns,” I speak to the material presence of Griko over time—that is, of its sounds and form, which are linked to locals’ lived experiences and memories of language use. I also incorporate symbols from the local landscape. In my second poem, “We Were Told, They Now Say,” I weave in quotes collected during my year-long ethnographic research in Southern Italy and Greece, which started in 2006.\n\nAs the granddaughter and daughter of Griko speakers, I see my research and poetry as activism. On one hand, I use anthropology as a tool to step back and engage critically with the past and present of this language. On the other hand, I lean into poetry to step back in. Through their integration, I paint different textures, feelings, and sensations to reflect on the interplay of language, experiential knowledge, and the environment. In this way, my poems speak to the apparent timelessness and constant change of this language and landscape.\n\nYet It Burns\n\nLand of water\n\nkneaded with air,\n\nof old headscarves,\n\nblack and tight,\n\nLand of olive trees\n\nunder the dew\n\nbreathing\n\nand bleeding\n\nwatchtowers\n\nLand of sweet tongues,\n\nseeded and weaved together\n\nby the time.\n\nLand of wild voices\n\nloved and silenced,\n\nstill with a mouth\n\nEmbellished land,\n\nbut knives cut our sea;\n\nred is our wind\n\nspider webs in our hands,\n\nof bitter honey.\n\nAnd we wait for the sun,\n\nyet it races off.\n\nAnd we wait under the sun,\n\nyet it burns.\n\nAnd so I write,\n\nash and tears are my ink,\n\na pen is my key,\n\nmy bedsheets are my paper.\n\nWe Were Told, They Now Say\n\nEvery name\n\nhas a body\n\nmade out of iron\n\nor out of wax.\n\nCenturies ago linguists predicted\n\nGriko would have no life.\n\nFull stop.\n\nListen now to Paolo’s bitter voice\n\nand how he carries the language on his tongue:\n\n“Has Griko died? May it rest in peace. Are we who write Griko then dead?\n\nAre you then, reading it, dead?”\n\nA lonely voice?\n\nyou ask\n\nand turn away.\n\nNo, I say,\n\nothers speak.\n\nAntimo lives his words\n\nas if they were carved on his old skin\n\n“The people with two languages they’d call us. They’d say that Griko wasn’t good anymore. Now they say it’s prestigious, to put it this way.”\n\nGriko\n\nnow re-sounds\n\nAs always\n\nSo says Rocco when he crosses\n\nthat world of water dividing and uniting us:\n\n“We come from Salento, we are the Griki from the other side of the sea,\n\nand we speak Griko.”\n\nThrough Griko,\n\nhe and I talk\n\nof the land\n\nwe walk on,\n\nwe talk\n\nof the time\n\nthat has passed,\n\nand of the time\n\nthat will come,\n\nflying.\n\nWe are people made of the land\n\nthat wraps us, as Antonio, in Greece, describes us:\n\n“We are not diasporic Greeks. We have always been here. We are Griki.”\n\nAnd so I write\n\nthat every name\n\nhas a body\n\nmade out of iron\n\nor out of wax\n\nbut that this language always\n\nneeds more\n\nthan a single voice\n\nto further walk.\n\nEditors’ Note: “We Were Told, They Now Say” was accepted as part of the To Be—Named project, which focuses on political aspects of naming as a key aspect in which identity is represented."
