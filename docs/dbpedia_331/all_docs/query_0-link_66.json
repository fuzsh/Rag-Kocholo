        "text": "This thorough collection of biographies focuses on Alberta’s French Canadian politicians, and their impact in the political life of the province. These biographies explore the history of provincial and federal Franco-Albertain officials, the background behind many French place names in Alberta, and encompasses political activity from 1891 until 2006. Available also in French.\n\nThis book offers its readers an opportunity to gain insight into Alberta's political past. This publication is based on a previous elections returns book, and details the names of politicians, the constituencies that they represented, the dates of their tenure, and party affiliation.\n\nDr. Ernest Mardon and Dr. Austin Mardon present a collection of biographies of politicians who are active in Federal politics but whom originated in Alberta. Their influence on Canada is not the focus, but rather the idea is to provide a starting point for those who wish to research this topic in the future.\n\nCome explore the history of Alberta`s rich political landscape and learn about the people who shaped the face of a province. Within these pages, you`ll meet the men and women who forged the politics of the region during the Roaring Twenties and the height of the Great Depression.\n\n“The aim of this dissertation is to seek an understanding of political social structure in a Canadian province though the study of social relations. The result is a better understanding of ties among Alberta politicians”—Quoted from the introduction. This is the first study of political networks in Alberta during the period of 1905-1992 using the methodology of network theory. A statistical analysis was performed using a compilation of a wide range of published his­tor­ical data. Important evidence of family linkages, ethnicity, religious affiliations, professional and occupational net­works, and business linkages was discovered. A model of political life is indicated and used to show the effect of these elites. Suggestions are made to get better account­ability and a broader representation of the general populace.\n\nWho runs and is elected is one of the most fundamental questions in political science as it pertains to the issue of descriptive representation. Despite the importance of this issue, until recently there were no longitudinal datasets on candidates in Canadian elections. This article presents two novel datasets including information on all candidates who ran in Canadian federal and Ontario provincial elections from 1867 to 2019. I present how these data were collected and how they can be used to gain new insights. I expect these data will be a valuable resource to Canadian political scientists for both research and teaching purposes.\n\nUnlike the four charter members of Canadian Confederation or the other subsequent additions to the federal union. British Columbia alone failed to emulate federal party lines in its provincial legislature. Much has been made of this anomoly by historians, particularly proponrents of the&#x27;particular province&#x27;school of historiography which emphasizes British Columbia&#x27;s dissimilarities to. and isolation from the rest of Canada. Pat Roy. for instance, has argued that&#x27;because of their physical and psychological isolation from the rest of ...\n\nDuring the twentieth century, as Canadian voters began to associate the brand of their major political parties with the characteristics of their leaders, the Liberal Party of Canada’s leadership races evolved into events of national importance. This study examines this transformation through the 1948, 1958 and 1968 leadership conventions. It incorporates perspectives from inside the Liberal Party as well as the Canadian media’s portrayals of the conventions. This thesis explores the alternating pattern of anglophone and francophone Party leaders, the complications associated with the predictability of the outcome, the evolution of convention tactics to recruit delegate support, Party (dis)unity throughout the contests, and the political science theories that deconstruct the conventions and predict outcomes. It also details how, over time, the political ambitions of senior-ranking members trumped the interests the Liberal Party."
