        "text": "Derek Puffer’s sisters Justine and Janine wept in court as he was deemed by a judge Friday to be not criminally responsible because of a severe mental disorder for the stabbing deaths last year of their mother Donna Lee Powers and stepfather Billy Powers, a Calgary sports icon.\n\nCourt of Queen’s Bench Justice Kristine Eidsvik required only a half-hour to make the decision on Friday after hearing concurring arguments by defence counsel Alain Hepner and Crown prosecutor Jonathan Hak.\n\nBoth lawyers stressed that Puffer, 40, was suffering from untreated schizophrenia for many years and was hearing voices that told him to kill his parents at their Braeside home early on the morning of July 4, 2013.\n\nEidsvik said Puffer was in a trance-like state at the time, had no conscious control over his actions and no sense at the time it was morally wrong. She said he did not fully appreciate his parents were dead until he read their obituaries.\n\n“The Crown called four police officers who recounted the arrest and we watched video interviews of Mr. Puffer, which clearly showed Mr. Puffer was suffering from delusional behaviour on July 4, 2013,” Eidsvik said in her decision.\n\n“Mr. Puffer testified he is much better now, after receiving excellent treatment from his doctors. He was able to recount his story in a relatively monotone, emotionless way, about how he became more and more sick and tired over several months, culminating around the time of the floods. This led to commanding voices telling him he had to stab his parents. He had no control, he was exhausted and wanted the voices to end. If he didn’t obey, he felt the voices would kill him through a chip implanted on his brain.\n\n“He has distorted recollection of being told to stab his parents. He was commanded to do it, so he did it. He thought he was going to die. I found Mr. Puffer’s evidence to be credible and believable. The police and doctors also found this. The Crown did not argue otherwise.”\n\nThe judge said Puffer had no animosity toward his mother and stepfather. From all accounts, they were loving parents and he lived with them.\n\nPuffer’s sisters politely declined to make any comment Friday, but said they will issue a statement in the next few days.\n\nHepner said it was a no-win situation for everyone.\n\n“Bill Powers was a very much loved sportscaster in Calgary and Donna Lee Powers was very loved at the Calgary Jewish Centre where she worked,” Hepner said outside court. “They were a wonderful couple, well-loved in the community and well-loved by the public. This is a tragic set of circumstances.\n\n“(Derek’s) family members who I’ve spoken to have been very supportive and know how very sick he was and his mental illness has been overwhelming to them as well. He’s a sick young man, so I’m sure he’s pleased with the ruling in that regard, but he’s going to a psychiatric hospital for a long time. Dr. Hashman and Dr. Santana say he is at the high end of mental illness they’ve seen.”\n\nHak said on the evidence before the court, it was really the only decision the court could make — and it was the right decision.\n\n“One of the things we look at in potential NCR cases is the background,” said Hak. When you have someone like Derek Puffer, who has had documented schizophrenia back to age 18, and who has had actual psychotic episodes in intervening years, we know we’re not dealing with someone just trying to get out of a crime he committed.”\n\nHak said Puffer will go before the Mental Health Review Board within 45 days and they will ultimately determine how long he must remain in hospital before he is given any form of release.\n\nHe said they have to review his case every 12 to 24 months and determine if any restrictions can be placed on him that will allow him to be released into the community.\n\nThe prosecutor said he must take an injectable drug every 28 days, so he would have to show up to do that.\n\nThe two forensic psychiatrists — Dr. Ken Hashman and Dr. Sergio Santana — also testified that Puffer should be found not criminally responsible because of the mental disorder.\n\nSantana said Puffer has schizophrenia and although he knew generally what he was doing that day, he did not know it was morally wrong at the time when he stabbed Donna Lee Powers, 64, a total of 16 times, and Billy Powers, 71, nine times while they were sleeping in their bed.\n\n“He knew he was causing harm to his parents, but he couldn’t control it and didn’t know it was wrong,” said Santana. “He was completely controlled by voices in his head and a microchip he believed was there. Only very recently he realized the microchip was not there.\n\n“Unfortunately, we cannot cure schizophrenia. We can manage it. When you have it, you’ll be on treatment the rest of your life. It’s the same thing for Derek.”\n\nHashman told court that Puffer’s mental state was worsening in the days leading up to the day he killed the Powers and without treatment he could not fight what the voices were telling him.\n\n“The voices were demanding him to kill his parents, giving him instructions to stab them, even though he was trying to resist,” Hashman told Hepner.\n\nBoth doctors agreed that Puffer should be on anti-psychotic medication for the rest of his life.\n\nPuffer testified earlier that he tried to escape intense voices and chanting in his head by continually moving around — riding his bicycle and walking long distances — in the days before he fatally stabbed his parents. But, he said he couldn’t escape.\n\nHe believed a chip had been inserted in his brain by either government, a privatized company or the Masons, who were trying to take over his head.\n\n“They were saying they were coming to kill me and I was doing something wrong by shaking my head back and forth to get rid of the voices,” Puffer told Hepner. “After awhile it was too much. I was being bombarded by these frequencies.\n\n“At one point, I was told to get naked, pick up a knife, go to work with the knife. That’s what I did. I started walking in the general direction of work, then I was commanded to come back to home. I was naked. I was told to go back home to go stab Bill and Mom. I thought I was going to die anyway that evening. I continued on to their room. Yes, I stabbed them.”"
