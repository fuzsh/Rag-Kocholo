XXIX No. 10 THE RED DEER ADVOCATE, WEDNESDAY, MARCH 11th, 1931 TEN PAGES Official Opening of Red Deer's New Court House Banquet Tendered by City and Board of Trade to Distinguished Guests- -Fine Speech by Premier -Chief Justice Harvey Has Mayor Douglas of Edmonton Arraigned for Contempt of Court Speculation has been rife for some as to what criminal would be the first to have his trial in the new court house at Red Deer, and there has been a good deal of chaff and badinage on the subject. His Lordship the Hon. Mr .\n\nHorace Harvey, Chief Justice of Alberta, on Friday evening brought all this speculation to an end by solemnly arraigning before himself His Worship Mayor Douglas of Edmonton, and releasing him on suspended sentence for the heinous crime of of court. The Elks' Hall has probably never held such a gathering of notables at the were banquet arranged to celebrate included among the guests the opening of the new court house, sponsored jointly by the City cil and the Board of Trade. One hundred and thirty-eight people sat down at 7 o'clock, and were waited on by some of Red 'Deer's leading ladies. Mayor Turnbull occupied the chair and acted as toastmaster. In his opening remarks, after the loyal toast, he set the fashion sparkling wit that characterized the various speeches, all of which were quite happy .\n\nThe Visitors To Mr. W. J. Botterill, president the Board of Trade, fell the duty of proposign the to the visitThe speaker made reference to th long agitation in Red Deer for an adequate court house, to the very few plums of public money we had received, such as the building of the east bridge, to the prospect of a match factory in the near future, and wound up with a reference to the recent optimistic words of the governor-general in London regarding Canada's virility. In calling upon Mayor Davison, cf Calgary, to reply to this toast, Mayor Turnbull told him, and incidentally the other guests, that Red had ended 1930 with a good cash surplus; that 1930 had seen a 5-mill reduction in the tax rate followed by a further reduction of one mill this year, and a substantial reduction in the business tax; that in 1930 the paid the city nearly $1000 in interest; that our utilities were all making profits (except our street the hospital and the Board of Trade both having cash surpluses in 1930; that since 1916 Red Deer had reduced the debenture debt that every street in town was fourteen miles; and that all around ed Deer was a pretty fair town .\n\nHis Worship Mayor Davison said that, contrary to popular superstition, he and the Mayor of Edmonton were on speaking terms with each other. He replied in kind to some of the implications in the catalogue of Red Deer's numerous advantages, gloated with rather dubious glee on the number of free meals a mayor got during his term of office, gave the lion's share of credit for Red Deer's fine economic position to and wound up with the rather awkward question Thy Red Deer should find itself SO desperately in need of a court house, of all buildings. Mayor Douglas said he could not understand why Red Deer spoke of itself as the capital of \"Central when the geographical centre of the province was several hundred miles north of Edmonton. His remark that Edmonton quite properly be considered the hub of the province, drew from Mayor Davison the but not the whole wagon wheel.\" Red Deer's vaunted surplus he attributed to a pleasant little custom of passing our indigents along north to Edmonton, or occasionally south to Calgary, instead of feeding them. Personally, he had no use for a (This remark was what got him into trouble later) .\n\nHe was genuinely pleased at Red Deer's enviably fine position, hoped the match factory would materialize soon, and assured those present that anything that benefitted any part of Alberta would always please Edmontonians. Before calling on the next speaker, Mayor Turnbull graciously acknowledged the tribute to the efficiency of the Red Deer police. Mr. J. L .\n\nJamieson, superintendent of the Canadian, Pacific Railway, Calgary, very briefly assuring the audience that if they had come, expecting to hear any controversy between him and Mr. Johnson, they would be disappointed. While he was an official and, in a small way, a shareholder in the C.P.R., he WAS compulsorily a shareholder in the other railway. This speaker paid a tribute to the Red Deer ladies for their cooking and service. Mr .\n\nJ. P. Johnson, divisional superintendent of the C.N.R., spoke vin much the same strain, congratuInting Red Deer on its fine new temple of justice. Bench and Bar Mr. W .\n\nE. Payne, K.C., the doyen cf Red Deer's legal profession, proposed the toast to the Bench and Bar. He had practised law in Red Deer, he said, longer than any other advocate, past or present. He remembered when court was held in a sample room next to the Alberta bar. It was not to that kind of bar he was proposing a toast .\n\nMr. Payne reviewed some of the wanderings of Red Deer's court, spoke of the high standing and integrity of the legal profession, who, in contrast to the man who had \"no use\" for court houses, earned their bread and butter in them. The Law Society's discipline committec, he said, was as strict as any court in the land, and as jealous of the good name of the profession. Alberta had some excellent judges, and many good ones. Chief Justice Harvey, whom he had first met in 1902, was one of the excellent ones .\n\nHis Lordship the Honorable Chief Justice Harvey replied to this toast at some length, giving a learned and, BADMINTON TOURNAMENT AT RED DEER ON APRIL of been decided to stage a Central Alberta badminton tournahere on Monday, April 6, with only the clubs in the Red Deer district taking part.

Henry Neilson Fatally Burnt Near Kevisville Henry Neilson, of Kevisville, aged 52 years, died in the Innisfail hospital on Wednesday morning owing to being severely burnt in a bush fire in the Red Raven district, in the fierce windstorm of Tuesday afternoon. Mr. Neilson had been out cutting brush on Mr .\n\nMcKain's place on Tuesday and had decided to return home, as serious fire from the windstorm threatened the whole district.

In the past, in prosperous times, we had made the mistake of encouraging immigration faster than the country could absorb it. It was important, now that employment was slack. that we should avoid Jumping to the other extreme by shutting it out altogether .\n\nThe Ukrainian immigrants were, like others, anxious and doubtful over the economic outlook, but they were good loyal Canadians, and the admixture of a little such blood in our nationality would do it no harm. Against the menace of Soviet competition in wheat-growing might put the higher cost of ing and the marked decrease in the number of farms in the United (Continued on page Re-Modelling Old Court House Offices to Be Prepared for Various Provincial Services Mr. D.

While shooting the speciality numbers and comedy blackouts which run between the eight huge musical spectacle numbers of the colossal production, he got an idea .\n\nForthwith, he called up Mabel Wayne on the telephone. Mabel Wayne is the lady who wrote \"Ramona,\" \"In Little Spanish and numberless other song hits.

The Board of Trade, the Curling Club and the Rotary Club, he said, had each given $25. The proposal met with no support at all, Ald .\n\nHogg and Johns opposing it quite strongly, and Ald. Hunter and Whyte more mildly. Even Ald. Code, although a member of the Curling Club, opposed the principle. The Mayor and Ald .\n\nWhyte excused themselves, Ald. Hogg, the deputy mayor, presiding while Mr. Davis spoke to the Council. Mr. 0 .\n\n0. Davis. Calgary, of the commercial division of the Ford Motor waited on the Council with a proposal to supply a motordrawn water cart, 500 gal. capacity, at $1313. Although they are not at present in the market, they might be soon, so the Council gave Mr .\n\nDavis a courteous hearing while he explained the various types of motor-drawn sprinkler. Before adjournment, Ald. Hogg explained that the cause of his radio trouble, which he spoke of recently. had been discovered and corrected. He had been disposed to blame the high tension line of the Calgary Power and wished now, in fairness to that Company, to say the cause was something entirely different .\n\nCouncil adjourned at 9:45. Serious Accident to Mr. W. Beaumont Car Crashes Over Bridge on Fifth Street N.E. fascinating review of the history of the administration of justice in Western Canada, since it first became part of Canada in 1870 .\n\nAs Rupert's Land and the North West Territories, in 1875-6 it was administered stipendiary magistrates. Through the days of Matthew Ryan, Lt. Richardson in the east, Lt.Col. McLeod in the west, around 1883, the establishment of a supreme court in 1886, the days of the Riel Rebellion, the learned judge traced the sometimes \"raw rough\" methods of the \"wild and woolly The prisoner who seconded his counsel's motion for a discharge, in the absence of any prosecution, and had the motion declared \"carried\" by the judge, was a good example. In 1907 provincial courts were established and there were now eleven supreme court and twelve district court judges in Alberta .\n\nHe, the speaker, had held his first court in Red Deer on May 30, 1905. Owing to a heavy docket and a schedule which required his appearance in Calgary the following week, he had on that occasion broken all trade union rules, sitting from as early as 9 a.m. to 11:45 p.m. Among the counsel on that occasion were Mr. Payne and Mr .\n\nCrawford, now himjudge. Mr. Justice Harvey wound up with a story of a young lawyer who pleaded a case before him at Stettler in 1916, lost the case, appealed and won the appeal. That young lawyer, he said, is now your premier, Hon. J .\n\nE. Brownlee. Mr. G. W .\n\nSmith, M.P.P., Introduced as the man who to Red Deer when the Rockies were little hills, and who put the water in the Red Deer River, proposed the toast to the Province. He welcomed His Lordship the Chief Justice, whose learned address he had greatly enjoyed. The speaker thought perhaps Red Deer had lost nothing by waiting until now for their court house. Had we had it sooner, it might not have been such a magnificent structure. It was such as to express fittingly the dignity of our fair province .\n\nIt was evident the Provincial Government felt the best none too good for Red Deer. He might remind the Premier, now that he was here, that there was one other thing that would be in order. Our Provincial Training School was quite inadequate for the demands upon it, and should be just about doubled in size. We had a real live Minister of who would doubtless see we had the Healthy, patience to wait until times were not quite so stringent. He had great pleasure in proposing the toast to what was, to him at any rate, the banner province of a fine dominion .\n\nPremier Brownlee In introducing Premier Brownlee, the chairman said: \"No matter of what political persuasion we happen to be, I am certain that you will agree with me when I say that Mr. Brownlee's boundless energy, his outstanding ability, his sincerity of purpose, his freedom pettiness and lofty ideals brought credit, honor and advantage to Alberta. His prophetic outlook has helped us to discover that we live in a wonderful province of almost unlimited possibilities. He has given us inspiration, courage and determination to carry on.\" The Premier said it was with mingled feelings that he faced them that evening: feelings of trepidation and pleasure. He had found it rather a humbling experience that morning to find his picture one of the provincial dailies, with caption \"Act of term usually applied a to some great catastrophe .\n\n(Laughter). He doubted whether Chief Justice Harvey had ever heard the real true story of the court case he had referred to, in which he had been represented as appearing to labor simple points of law. The building to be opened that evening was a monument to, and should be a temple of, the British tradition of even justice. He did not think the same amount of money could be spent in any other way to better advantage, than in the impression of our new Canadians, a rapidly growing class, with a sense of the dignity, the majesty, the incorruptibility, of our forensic institutions. The new court house was more than a monument and a temple: it was a challenge .\n\nIf the province thought the best none too good for Red Deer, the Board of Trade and City should try to live up to the high standard set by such a fine public building. Alberta was in a fortunate position. In a time of confusion in other countries, a time of panic as to how far Russian competition would hurt us, economically, we in this province were as well off, perhaps much better off, than the citizens of other countries. Judging by the actual figures of savings-bank deposits, for instance, the outlook was as bright as at any time in our past history. Hard times were not altogether an unmixed curse .\n\nThey gave us time to look around to take stock of ourselves; they meant a period of quiet reflection, when we might ask ourselves what kind of citizenship and nationality we had been shaping. He thought we could boast of having done a fairly good job. There had been a lot of talk lately of dissension and sedition, which one might reasonably expect to be worse in settlements of foreign-born people than elsewhere. But these neighborhoods were the very ones where sedition-mongering had signally failed. He, the speaker, had recently been at a banquet with a man fairly noted in the newspaper world, Mr .\n\nHorton, the editor of the Vegreville Observer, who had told him 60 to 75 per cent of those present were Ukrainian boys and girls, challenging him to pick them out, Mr. Wright Beaumont, of the Red Deer Advocate staff, is at the Municipal Hospital with a fracture of the base of the skull, a broken collarbone and other injuries, as the result of an upset in an auto over the Fifth St. North bridge on Wednesday noon. His condition looked very grave at first, but, after he recovered consciousness, the outlook grew more hopeful. Mr .\n\nF. P. Galbraith, who was driving the car, and also went over the bridge in it, escaped with practically no injurles. They were driving home from the Advocate office at one o'clock, north along Waskasoo Creek to Fifth St. North .\n\nIn turning east on that street, the driver drew somewhat to the west to avoid the rut at the corner, and went over to the north side of the road. He turned sharply and, possibly because one of the front tires went flat, the car crashed through the south railing of the bridge and overturned 15 to 20 feet down to the of the creek bed below, the top of the car being crushed on the ice with the passengers inside. Mr. Galbraith got out of the car and went to Mr. Gunn's residence, when doctor and ambulance were sent for .\n\nMr. Beaumont was removed to the hospital, in an unconscious condition and evidently seriously injured. The car was wrecked. Mr. Beaumont has made good progress since the accident, and is over any immediate danger .\n\nHe has gone along as well as could be expected. A.P. Police Alberta John Varty, Innisfall, was arrested by Const. Ball, A.P.P., on February 28, on a charge of robbing E. Forbes, of Raven, of $35 .\n\nVarty and Forbes had drinking together at Innisfail on the evening of February 27, and later Forbes went to a rooming house, and was assisted to bed by Varty. Forbes missed his money next morning, and Varty was found to have $40 in his possession. He told the police he had earned the money from Bishaw, a cattle buyer, but Bishaw had by no means the same story. Then Varty said that Forbes had given him the money to look after it for him. The accused appeared before Mr .\n\nLauder on the 28th, and was remanded for trial by Mr. Scott. He came up at Red Deer on March 6, and was found guilty and sentenced to three months at Fort Saskatchewan. On the night of March 6, W. W .\n\nHilton, on a S.S.B. farm in the Ardley district, lost his barn, chicken house, 50 chickens, wagon shed, and loads of oats, barley and chop. The fire broke out in the barn at 9:45 p.m. Twenty of the neighbors came over Saturday and helped to build a new pole barn. Sergt .\n\nHolmes made an investigation, but had no word of any suspicious characters in the neighborhood. Mr. Hilton was positive he had taken the lantern from the barn when he went to the house. His loss was $500, nearly all covered by insurance. Mr .\n\nHilton is a widower with one daughter, who was away at a dance at the time of the fire. Miss Mabel Soderman, organist at St. Luke's church, drove out in her car to her parents' home on the Sylvan Lake after church in Red Deer on Sunday evening, reaching there about ten o'clock. She drained the radiator, and took off the tap. Early in the morning an alarm among the chickens indicated the presence of turbing factors, and the miamily found that there were tracks of strangers round the place and that the car had been taken, and some $40.00 from the home .\n\nThe A.P.P. got the trail, and Sergt. Holmes believed that the car would not be driven far, owing to the engine heating up. He and Chief Cameron started out to the Soderman place Monday morning to make further investigation, and at the trail on the turn from the C. E .\n\nhighway, the old turn to the Sylvan Lake road, they found the car which had been abandoned there, and brought it to town. It had been evidently driven to Red Deer and then back, about 15 miles in all. Garage folks in Red Deer had helped out the driver by driving a chunk of wood into the tap-hole to hold the water, but it did not last long. The man who took the car is known. LACOMBE The Lacombe Branch of the Canadian Legion entertained friends at a smoking concert in the Adelphi Hotel on Saturday night .\n\nThe rooms were kindly lent by the proprietor of the hotel, Mr. Orton. The pregram consisted of vocal and instrumental music, community singing, speaches by Comrade T. Wilkes and Mr. W .\n\nF. Puffer. Mr. Wilson Ritson was chairman.
