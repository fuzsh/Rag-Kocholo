        "text": "Dateline NBC's social and digital series 'Missing in America' began nine years ago today, on December 5, 2013. We asked our Facebook community a simple question the night before. \"Do you know anyone who has simply vanished?\"\n\nThe response was overwhelming. Since that first post, every week we have tried to feature the story of a different missing person brought to our attention by a member of our social communities. And this year, we created a new podcast series called ‘Dateline: Missing in America,’ which highlighted six cases of the cases featured in our digital series. You can learn more about the cases featured in Season 1 and listen here.\n\nRead and share their stories. Someone, somewhere, saw something.\n\nIf you know someone who is missing and would like their story featured, you can submit information here, send us a message on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or email dateline.contactus@nbcuni.com.\n\nThis article mentions suicide. If you or someone you know is in crisis, please call or text the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline at 988.\n\nAnesha “Duffy” Murnane\n\nAnesha “Duffy” Murnane, 38, was last seen on security video on October 17, 2019, leaving her Homer, Alaska apartment heading to a 1:00 p.m. doctor’s appointment. She never made it. Police said security cameras captured Duffy leaving the Maintree Apartments on foot around 12:15 p.m. For weeks, law enforcement, assisted by K-9 units, searched the area where Duffy was known to frequently travel by foot. Duffy’s family told Dateline that she did not own a car and usually walked everywhere she went. According to Homer Police Department Lieutenant Ryan Browning, search dogs tracked Duffy’s scent into downtown Homer but then lost it, reaching a point search-dog handlers call a “car pick up.” Duffy’s mother, Sara Berg, said the family believed someone picked her up in a vehicle and that she had been abducted. Sara filed a presumptive death petition for her daughter in April 2021. Two months later, a six-member jury decided that Duffy could be presumed dead. It also determined that her death was likely a homicide. Duffy’s parents long believed their daughter was murdered, but said they were still surprised to learn her death was a homicide. On May 9, 2022, the Homer Police Department posted on their Facebook page that they had arrested 32-year-old Kirby Foleni Calderwood in relation to Duffy’s disappearance. In May of 2022, Dateline obtained the arrest warrant affidavit that Investigator Matt Haney of the Homer Police Department submitted. The affidavit detailed an anonymous tip that came in on April 14, 2022. The tip was “very specific” as to “how the kidnapping, murder and destruction of evidence were committed.” The tipster named Calderwood, who had previously been reported to the Homer Police Department and was already under investigation in the case, as the person responsible. Investigator Haney wrote in the affidavit that “Calderwood has an extensive history of abusive violent sexual behavior towards women and fantasized about torturing and killing someone.” Calderwood lived in Alaska for a few years, which is when he met Duffy. At some point in the past couple of years, Calderwood returned to Utah and married for a third time. Investigator Haney wrote in the affidavit that the tipster provided a specific detail in regards to Calderwood keeping Duffy’s wristwatch, which she said “may have been a Timex.” Haney wrote that they found photos of Duffy wearing a watch and her mother and stepfather confirmed it was a Timex. The tipster also said Calderwood admitted to her that he had tortured and killed Duffy, threw her phone in a nearby lake and disposed of her body in a dumpster. On May 5, 2022, Haney and the Ogden, Utah Police Department executed multiple search warrants related to Calderwood. Officials found a small women's Timex watch in Calderwood’s dresser drawer that matched the description of Duffy’s watch. That day, Investigator Haney also interviewed Calderwood’s current wife, who was reportedly “very afraid.” The following day, according to the affidavit, the wife called Investigator Haney and disclosed that she had been the anonymous tipster who called the month prior. This led the Ogden Police to issue a warrant for Calderwood’s arrest. He was arrested on May 9, 2022, and was initially held at the Weber County Correctional Facility in Utah. He was charged with kidnapping, murder in the first degree, murder in the second degree and tampering with physical evidence. In November, Calderwood was transported to Alaska. Alaska Department of Corrections Public Information Officer, Betsy Holley, confirmed to Dateline in an email that “Calderwood is currently housed in Wildwood Correctional Center.” He is expected to be in court in early 2023. Calderwood has not yet entered a plea. Police urge anyone with information on the case or the location of Duffy’s body to contact the Homer Police Department at 907-235-3150 or Crime Stoppers at 907-283-8477.\n\nDoren Sanford\n\nDoren Sanford was in Fairbanks, Alaska on August 20, 2020 to look at some property he was interested in purchasing when he vanished. He was last known to be in the area of Airport Road searching for his lost Rottweiler, Groot. Both are missing. Doren, who was 34 at the time, was raised in Tok with his large extended family, and lived in Anchorage where he worked as a heavy equipment operator/laborer. He had recently started his own business, Sanford Home Repair & Remodel. Lieutenant Jess Carson of the Alaska State Troopers told Dateline in March of 2021, that they continue to look for Doren and believe that finding Groot may lead to answers on Doren’s whereabouts. He added that troopers suspect foul play in Doren’s disappearance and believe they’ve already spoken to people who know what happened to him. Doren is described as being 5’10”, weighing approximately 140-160 lbs., with brown hair and blue eyes. A Facebook page “Find Doren Sanford” has been created to share developments in the case. In November of 2022, investigators from the Alaska State Troopers, Lantz Dahlke and Lonny Piscoya, told Dateline that Doren’s case has been added to the list of cases being investigated by the new Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons investigative team, which was created by the Alaska Department of Public Safety in May of this year. In addition to investigating both active and cold cases, officials will be working to improve communications between partnering organizations and the MMIP, by providing fresh perspective into unsolved cases. If you have tips on Doren's case please call Lantz Dahlke at 907-451-5919 or Lonny Piscoya at 907-764-3864 or their tip line at 411.\n\nErin Marie Gilbert\n\nErin Marie Gilbert went on a first date to the Girdwood Forest Fair in Girdwood, Alaska on July 1, 1995 and hasn’t been seen since. The 24-year-old had moved to Alaska the year prior and was working as a nanny. Stephanie Gilbert-Juarez told Dateline that her sister’s date on July 1 was with David “Dave” Combs, a man whom Stephanie said Erin had met a few nights earlier at a local bar. They drove to the Girdwood Forest Fair and according to witness statements to Alaska State Troopers, Erin was last seen at a beer garden with Combs before they left around 6:00 p.m. In a statement to authorities in 1995, Dave Combs said they walked to his car, but the lights had been left on and it would not start. He said he told Erin he would walk to a nearby friend’s house for help. He said he walked for about two hours, but was unable to find his friend’s house. He told authorities when he returned to the car, Erin was gone and he figured she’d returned to the fair. Combs said when he tried to start the car this time, it worked. He stated he went back to the fair and searched for Erin until about 1:00 a.m. Lieutenant Randy McPherron of the Alaska State Troopers told Dateline in 2019 they haven’t received any leads in several years, but that they’d follow up on any that come in. He added there are no suspects in Erin’s disappearance. Erin’s case is one of the cases being looked into by the newly-created Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons investigative team. Erin is described as 5’11”, 145 lbs., with brown hair and hazel eyes. She would be in her early 50s today. If you have tips, please call investigators from the Alaska State Troopers, Lantz Dahlke at 907-451-5919 or Lonny Piscoya at 907-764-3864 or their tip line at 411.\n\nFlorence Okpealuk\n\n33-year-old Florence Okpealuk was last seen on West Beach in Nome, Alaska on October 14, 2020. According to Florence’s sister Blaire, a witness saw Florence leaving a tent on the beach at 4:00 p.m. Blaire told Dateline she found Florence’s shoes and jacket left outside of that tent. The Nome Police Department enlisted the help of the Alaska State Troopers and the FBI to aid in the search. Search efforts have included mini-submarines, helicopters and private citizens. In 2022, the Nome Police Department conducted a search using cadaver dogs. Florence is 5’2”, 142 lbs., with black hair and eyes. She has no scars, marks or tattoos. It is unknown what Florence was last seen wearing or which direction she was headed when she left the tent on that beach. If you have information about Florence’s disappearance please contact the Nome Police Department at (907) 443-5262.\n\nAlicia Navarro\n\nFifteen-year-old Alicia Navarro was last seen at her home in Glendale, Arizona, in the very early morning hours of September 15, 2019. When her parents woke up, she was gone and had left a note for them that read, “I ran away. I will be back. I swear. I’m sorry.” Alicia’s laptop was also gone, but her chargers were left behind in her room. Alicia’s mother, Jessica Nuñez, told Dateline in 2020 that she is especially worried because her daughter is on the autism spectrum and is known to be shy or anxious in some social situations. Alicia takes medicine and has a compromised immune system and Jessica has been worried that her daughter’s anxiety may have overwhelmed her amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Glendale Police Sergeant Randy Stewart told Dateline it was not known if Alicia was lured away or if she left on her own, but they were continuing to search for her and said they could use the public’s help for new information. The Glendale Police Department is working with the FBI and the Center for Missing and Exploited Children on the case. A Facebook page called ‘Finding Alicia Navarro’ has been created for anyone wanting to discuss the case or provide information that may lead to her whereabouts. Alicia has brown eyes and hair. She was 4’5”, weighed 95 lbs., and had braces at the time of her disappearance. She may have been wearing a sweatshirt, a whitewash denim overall skirt and black and white Vans-type sneakers and carrying a silver Apple MacBook Pro laptop. If you have any information on Alicia’s whereabouts, call the Glendale Police at 623-930-3000.\n\nDaniel Robinson\n\nOn June 23, 2021, 24-year-old Daniel Robinson, drove his 2017 blue Jeep Renegade away from his job site in the desert area west of Sun Valley Parkway, just north of Cactus Road in Buckeye, Arizona and hasn’t been seen since. In July of 2021, Daniel’s Jeep was discovered by a rancher in a ravine on his property about four miles southwest of the jobsite where Daniel was last seen. Police say the Jeep appeared to have rolled and landed on its side. Several of Daniel’s belongings were found at the scene, including clothes, his cell phone, wallet, and keys. A ground search was conducted, but nothing was found. Daniel’s father, David Robinson, traveled cross-country to search for his son. He spoke with Josh Mankiewicz for an episode of the new podcast series “Dateline: Missing in America” released this summer and said he would not leave Arizona until he finds his son. “It seems like it is simple, but when you are actually on the ground looking, it takes time,” he said. “You know, even with the people that we have it takes time... It’s a lot of time, effort and money to keep things going and I get weary at times that it is going to fade eventually and I won’t have that kind of support anymore.” David remains determined to get answers. “As a father, my drive is to find my son. So I will do whatever it takes to make it happen,” he vowed. Daniel is 5’8”, and weighs about 165 lbs. He has black hair and brown eyes. He is missing part of his right arm from the forearm down. Anyone with information on Daniel’s case is asked to call the Buckeye Police at 623-349-6400 or the Buckeye Police tip line at 623-349-6411 or the tipline created by Daniel's father at 844-602-0660.\n\nMichelle Bernstein-Schultz\n\n36-year-old Michelle Bernstein-Schultz was last heard from on June 29, 2022. Michelle’s sister, Daniella, told Dateline that at the time of her disappearance, Michelle had been living with her boyfriend in Phoenix, Arizona. According to Daniella, on June 29, Michelle had been texting a friend all day. The last message the friend received from her was around 4:03 p.m. Michelle’s mother, Patricia, told Dateline that the next day, she received a concerning text from Michelle’s boyfriend. He told her that Michelle had not been seen or heard from since June 29 and that he had reported her missing. According to Patricia, she then called Michelle’s boyfriend and he told her that earlier that day, Michelle told him that she wasn’t feeling well and didn’t want to be bothered. So when he got home later that night, he went to sleep on the couch. Patricia told Dateline he said when he got up the next morning, June 30, Michelle wasn’t in the bedroom. Patricia said that he told her all of Michelle’s belongings were left behind including her keys, phone, license, dog, and car. Dateline attempted to reach out to Michelle’s boyfriend for comment but was unsuccessful. In July, the Phoenix Police Department posted on Twitter that Michelle was “last seen on June 29th in the area of 40th St and Greenway Rd” in Phoenix. The police did not indicate whether they believe foul play is involved and no persons of interest have been named in Michelle’s disappearance. There have been no updates on Michelle’s case since. Michelle is 5’6\", about 170 lbs., with short black hair. According to police, Michelle was last seen wearing a black face mask and gray sandals with fluorescent green accents.

Brad’s girlfriend, Megan Coady, told Dateline in 2018 that she and Brad had gotten into an argument the night before and he told her he was going on a walk through the woods to cool off. But when she woke up later that morning and Brad hadn’t returned home, Megan grew concerned. After a few days of searching, the family called authorities to report Brad missing. Police told Dateline in April of 2018, that they interviewed Brad’s family, friends and coworkers, but there were no persons of interest as of 2018. Foul play is suspected in Brad’s disappearance. If you have any information on Brad’s whereabouts, please contact the Ashley County Sheriff's Office at (870) 853-2040.\n\nBrooke Allensworth\n\nBrooke Allensworth was last seen on July 12, 2018, a day after getting her hair and nails done at a salon in Independence County, Arkansas. She was 37 years old at the time. According to NBC affiliate KARK, Brooke’s father reported her missing on July 26 to the Searcy County Police Department, as Brooke lived in Searcy County at the time. On July 27, police in Independence County got a call that a vehicle registered to Brooke was found under a bridge. Some of her personal belongings were found inside the car. There was no sign of a struggle. A Facebook post by the Independence County Sheriff’s Office said police spoke with “several individuals” who had contact with Brooke in the days preceding her disappearance. Though no information led them to Brooke’s whereabouts, tips started coming in from multiple counties and the case was transferred to the Arkansas State Police. There have been no updates in her case. Brooke is described as being 5’8” and weighing 180 lbs. If you have any information on the circumstances surrounding her disappearance, please call the Arkansas State Police at (501) 618-8000.\n\nBeau Mann\n\n39-year-old Beau Mann was last seen in Los Angeles, California on November 30, 2021. He was captured that day on security footage in a Studio City 7-11 around 2:00 p.m. after being dropped off there by an Uber. The Uber records show Beau then being dropped off in San Antonio at 2:35 p.m. LAPD confirmed Beau texted 911 that day as well and when dispatchers texted back, Beau never responded. Anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of Beau Mann is asked to contact the LAPD Missing Persons Unit at 213-486-0260. Anyone wishing to remain anonymous should call the L.A. Regional Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (800-222-8477).\n\nCecilia Cabrera\n\nThe last images of Cecilia Cabrera were captured on security footage from the Tachi Palace Casino in Lemoore, California. It was just before 1:00 a.m. on June 9, 2016, when the 31-year-old was seen leaving the casino in her dark gray Chevrolet Malibu. Several hours later, a call came in to the California State Highway Patrol that a burning vehicle had been discovered in an orchard near Goshen, about 30 miles from the casino. It was Cecilia’s car, but she was not inside. Cecilia was last seen with her husband, Francisco Valdivia. In December of 2016, the Tulare County District Attorney's office filed charges against Valdivia for felony murder and arson. Rosalina Lopez, a woman who was also married to Valdivia, was charged with one felony count of being an accessory to murder after the fact. Valdivia and Lopez were arraigned at the Tulare County Pretrial Facility on December 14, 2016. There was no bail set for Valdivia and bail for Lopez was set at $500,000. Dateline has reached out to the Tulare County District Attorney's office multiple times in the past few weeks for an update on the status of the case, but has yet to hear back. Cecilia’s body has still not been found. If you have any information in Cecilia’s case, please call the Tulare County Sheriff's Department at (559) 735-1880.\n\nChristina Bastian\n\nHigh school teacher Christina Bastian and her dog, Coco, were last seen together in the early hours of November 1, 2015, at a friend's home near Apple Valley, California. The 34-year-old’s belongings were later found strewn along Highway 247, near Lucerne Valley. Her truck was located, abandoned, on a dirt road along Highway 62. The next day, her dog Coco was found alive by a stranger nearly 70 miles from where the truck had been located. In the seven years since Christina vanished, there have been few clues discovered in the case. Her mother, Cheryl Denny, continues to post on the Facebook page ‘Help Find Christina Bastian’ and tirelessly searches for her daughter. The Apple Valley Police Department told Dateline in 2022 that they are looking at this case as a homicide, but that no further information is available at this time. If you have any information regarding Christina’s case, please call the Apple Valley Police Department at (760) 240-7400.\n\nDane Elkins\n\nUC Santa Cruz student Dane Elkins, then 21, was last known to be in the area of Castaic, California, around 8:20 p.m. on December 21, 2020. His car was found abandoned with a flat tire. His wallet and cell phone were located inside, but there was no sign of Dane. Dane’s mother, Deborah, told Dateline in 2021 that she spoke to her son that day. She said that in the days leading up to his disappearance, Dane had become mentally distressed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and that he had been driving back and forth between their home in Brentwood and Santa Cruz, where he is an engineering student. For the past two years, Dane’s family has used social media to reach out to the community for information on his whereabouts. A Facebook group ‘Searching for Dane Elkins’ and the TikTok account @KindnessMom were launched to help spread the word. According to Dane’s mother’s Tik Tok page, there have been reported sightings of Dane that she believes are legitimate, the most recent being in the Northern California area, particularly in Santa Cruz. These possible sightings give her hope that her son is still alive.

Dateline spoke with Keith Harper who said that he and Dia started dating in 2016 and got engaged in 2019. According to Keith, the two were living together in her Mountain Center home where he worked as the property’s ranch manager. Keith told Dateline that on June 6, 2020, he and Dia had lunch together around 2:30 p.m. in their home and then he left to do some work on the property. He said when he returned to the home around 7:30 p.m. he found Dia’s cell phone charging in their bedroom, her purse was in the house, and her truck was outside. Dia was nowhere to be found. Keith told Dateline that after Dia didn’t return home that night, he reported her missing the next day. Dia’s son, Clinton Abrams, told Dateline he learned about his mother’s disappearance from one of her neighbors and immediately left his home in San Diego to go to the ranch. “I drove up there that Sunday,” he said. And by Monday, “missing persons came out, homicide came out, there was a dive team.” Clinton told Dateline he believes Keith Harper knows more about Dia’s disappearance than he has revealed. When asked by Dateline if he had something to do with Dia’s disappearance, Keith Harper responded, “Absolutely not.” In August 2022, the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office told Dateline that the case is being investigated by the homicide unit and that no further details of the case will be released. Dia is 5’6” with blue eyes. When she was last seen, Dia’s hair was blonde and she weighed 135 lbs. Anyone with information on Dia’s disappearance is asked to contact the Riverside County Sheriff’s Department after-hours hotline at 951-776-1099, Investigator Loureiro at 760-578-2101, or Investigator Vasquez at 951-203-3767.\n\nDiana Rose Alejandre Garcia Gonzalez\n\nDiana Rose Alejandre Garcia Gonzalez had been known to travel between Winterhaven, California, Yuma, Arizona, and Mexico, but when her family hadn’t been able to contact her for two months they reported her missing in June 2020. In September 2020, Dateline spoke with Investigator J. Hurtado of the Imperial County Sheriff’s Office in El Centro, California, who said Diana was last known to be in Winterhaven at the home she shared with her girlfriend, Danielle Meeden. Authorities believe she disappeared on May 4, 2020. Hurtado said they were actively searching for Diana and had interviewed several people about her disappearance. Investigator Hurtado would not comment further on details due to the ongoing nature of the investigation. “There are many stories and rumors around this case,” Investigator Hurtado said at the time. “So it’s hard to say at this time if foul play is involved.” There have been no updates since the last time Dateline reported on this story. Diana is described as being 5'3\" and weighing approximately 180 lbs., with brown hair and eyes. Diana’s family said she dyes her hair often, so it may be a lighter brown or blonde color. Anyone who may have information about Diane’s whereabouts is asked to contact the Investigation Unit at 442-265-2105 and reference case #2006-1642.\n\nDonald Cavanaugh\n\nDonald Cavanaugh was one of two men who disappeared more than a decade ago after working on the same small horse ranch in California outside Westport, a town with only 60 residents. Donald, then 63, was reported missing in May 2005, in Ukiah, California after a dispute with his nephew, James DeNoyer, who was the ranch owner. David Neily, 69, was reported missing in Westport, California just one year later, also reportedly after a confrontation with DeNoyer. Both men's vehicles were found on DeNoyer's ranch property. DeNoyer denies having any information or involvement in either man’s disappearance and has not been named a suspect. For years, both men had been feared dead. In May 2021, human remains were found by an employee at a private nature reserve in an old-growth Douglas-fir forest in Branscomb, about 3.5 miles from where David Neily’s car had been found 15 years earlier. DNA analysis of the remains and dental records examined by Jim Wood, a California Assembly member and forensic dentistry expert, determined they belonged to Neily. The examinations found no evidence of trauma and the sheriff’s office continues to investigate the circumstances surrounding Neily’s disappearance. Donald Cavanaugh is still missing. If you have information about either of these cases, you are encouraged to call the Mendocino County Sheriff's Office at (707) 234-2100.\n\nElaine Park\n\nThe last time anyone saw 20-year-old Elaine Park was in the early morning hours of Saturday, January 28, 2017. Elaine had driven to her on-again, off-again boyfriend’s family’s home in Calabasas, California the previous evening. Elaine’s mother, Susan, told Dateline the young man told her that Elaine had suffered some type of panic attack around 4:00 a.m. the next morning. He said despite his efforts to have her stay, Elaine drove off in her car. Security images from the property show Elaine’s car leaving the home, although authorities aren’t certain who was driving. Three days later, Elaine’s 2015 Honda Accord was spotted parked on the shoulder of Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu. The vehicle was unlocked and the key was still in the ignition. Authorities found Elaine’s cell phone and other personal belongings inside the car. According to the ‘Help Find Elaine Park’ Facebook page, there is a family and friend reward fund for $25,000, as well as an independent reward fund for $250,000. Anyone with information regarding Elaine’s case is urged to contact the Glendale Police Department at (818) 548-4911.\n\nHeidi Planck\n\nCalifornia mother Heidi Planck, 39, was last seen leaving her 10-year-old son’s football game in Downey, California on October 17, 2021. She was first reported missing on October 20 after she failed to pick her son up from school. Hours after Heidi was last seen, her dog was found on the 28th floor of an apartment building in downtown Los Angeles. Police have said their investigation led them to the Chiquita Canyon Landfill, about 40 miles northwest of the downtown location where Heidi was last seen. “Forensic evidence was located inside the building which has led detectives to believe an incident occurred resulting in Planck’s death,” the Los Angeles Police Department said in an online statement. On November 29, 2021, police began searching the landfill for evidence connected to Heidi’s disappearance. Police said in the same statement that they were looking in \"a specific area\" of the landfill for human remains. Police have asked for tips from anyone who was at the residential building at 1201 S. Hope St., listed online as the Level Downtown Flower building, on or around October 17. In July 2022, Dateline featured Heidi’s case in season one of the new podcast series “Dateline: Missing in America.” Among others, Josh Mankiewicz spoke with KNBC reporter Eric Leonard who has been covering the case in Los Angeles. \"By combining the videos that captured who goes in and out, the access controls that record date, time, doorways of who goes in and who goes out,” he said, “they were able to narrow down who could have been involved and began to focus the investigation on them.” Leonard also told Dateline that \"there was a pretty clear understanding amongst the investigators that she had attended a party or get-together and went into distress -- had some kind of medical episode.” He added that “Police were able to confirm that she -- after she died -- was likely put into an upper floor trash chute and her body fell into a giant industrial-sized dumpster and trash compactor in the ground floor of the building.” Heidi's remains have not been located. Anyone with information on Heidi’s case is urged to contact the Los Angeles Police Department, Missing Persons Unit, at (213) 996-1800 or 1-877-LAPD-24-7 (877-527-3247). Anyone wishing to remain anonymous should call the LA Regional Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (800-222-8477) or go directly to www.lacrimestoppers.org.\n\nJohn “Jack” Stein\n\nJohn “Jack” Stein, then 24, was last seen in the 3700 block of Kanan Road in Agoura Hills, California, on July 13, 2021. His family says he suffers from depression and bipolar disorder and is worried because it’s unlike him to not be in contact with someone. He did not have a cell phone or ID on him, but could have been traveling to Denver or Salt Lake City, where he has friends, or to his hometown in Minnesota. Family members, friends and volunteers have scoured the woods and neighborhoods around Agoura Hills, Westlake, and Thousand Oaks, as well as Venice Beach and Malibu, searching shelters and homeless encampments. Jack is described by his family as a kind, beautiful soul who is creative and loves to draw, but also athletic and loves to surf and snowboard. He’s 6’3”, weighs about 180 lbs., and has blue eyes and shaggy strawberry-blond hair. He has a tattoo of a sparrow on his upper right thigh and circle tattoos on his chest. He was last seen wearing a navy blue hooded sweatshirt with the words “Tommy Hilfiger” down the arm, black shorts, and gray Nike running shoes. His sister Zoe has organized a sticker campaign to bring attention to her brother's case. You can learn more at helpfindjackstein.com.

Shannon Rincon at (323) 890-5500.\n\nKarlie Gusé\n\nOn October 12, 2018, 16-year-old Karlie Gusé left her home in Chalfant, California to hang out with friends nearby, according to family. Karlie’s stepmother, Melissa, told Dateline she picked Karlie up from town and brought her home around 9:00 p.m. According to Melissa, they ate dinner together before Karlie went to bed. Karlie’s father, Zachary, told Dateline that Karlie seemed “disoriented” before she went to bed, but would not comment further on her condition. Melissa said she went to Karlie’s room early the next morning to check on her stepdaughter, but Karlie was nowhere to be found. Five months later, Melissa appeared on the Dr. Phil daytime talk show, and told Dr. Phil that she had lied to NBC when she spoke to Dateline. “Melissa, you told NBC, the next morning that at 5:45 a.m., you did your usual routine of opening up the kids’ doors, saying good morning, getting them ready for school -- that sort of thing. Did you -- she was still in bed at that time -- did you go back and lay down?” Dr. Phil asked Melissa on the show which aired on March 25, 2019. “No. That -- the Dateline NBC?” Melissa answered. “Yeah, that was a false story. Because I wasn’t – it was a lie about checking in on Karlie. Because it was in the beginning, and I didn’t know what to say and – I shouldn’t have even done the interview.” Karlie’s mother, Lindsay Fairley, who lives in Nevada, told Dateline in 2018 that she had been sick to her stomach from the pain her daughter’s disappearance had caused. Authorities say Karlie was last seen wearing a white t-shirt and gray sweatpants. If you have any information on Karlie’s disappearance, please call the Mono County Sheriff’s Office at 760-932-7549 and select option 7.\n\nLance Perkins\n\nDonna Perkins told Dateline the last time she spoke to her son Lance was on the night of October 23, 2016, when he called to tell her that he was having blackouts. She told him to call 911 and go to the hospital. The 43-year-old was taken by ambulance from his hotel in San Diego to UCSD in Hillcrest. Three hours later, according to Donna, security cameras showed him walking out of the hospital. He never returned to his hotel, and he never called his mother back. Because of privacy laws, it’s unclear if Lance was treated at the hospital. Officials with the San Diego Police Department are investigating, but little has been released in connection with the case. There is a Facebook page called ‘Lance Perkins Missing Person’ which his family keeps updated with any new information they receive. Authorities have reportedly conducted several searches, but few clues have been found. Anyone with information regarding Lance’s case is urged to contact the San Diego Police Department at (619) 531-2000.\n\nLyn Palmer\n\nAfter working her normal volunteer shift at a local thrift store on April 20, 2018, 71-year-old Lyn Palmer returned to her home in Fall River Mills, California. Waiting for her was her husband of 20 years, Bob Palmer, and Bob’s daughter’s dog, a Blue Heeler named Lucy, whom they were taking care of for a few days. Lyn told her husband she was going to take Lucy on her usual 15-minute walk, leaving her phone, wallet, and purse on the kitchen counter. She never returned. Four days later, Lucy returned to the house unharmed. Family and authorities have searched tirelessly for Lyn, but nothing of significance has been found. Police say there are no signs of foul play. The Secret Witness program of Shasta County, in collaboration with Lyn’s family, is offering up to a $5,000 reward for information leading to Lyn’s whereabouts.

According to family, the 32-year-old hung out with a new friend until around 4:30 a.m., and then drove to the Malibu Canyons after dropping the friend off at her house. According to the family, who had access to his phone records through his ex-girlfriend, Matthew sent several texts and posted to Snapchat later that morning. Early the next morning, according to a press release by the Los Angeles Police Department, Matthew’s car was found “abandoned on the Topanga Tower Motorway, near Rosas Overlook, and above the Backbone Trail and Hondo Canyon areas.” Since Matthew’s disappearance, authorities, friends, and family have conducted multiple searches, but nothing of significance has been found. Family is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to Matthew’s whereabouts. They have also created a website where people can submit any information they may have regarding Matthew’s disappearance.

The casino was less than a 15-minute drive from Max’s house in Bookings, Oregon, and family says he went there often with friends. Security footage provided by the casino shows Max, 25, arriving around 1:00 a.m. A Curry County Sheriff’s Office press release says Max was then seen going outside the casino and waiting near the back door. Around 1:50 a.m., security footage shows Max talking to a white adult male in front of the casino. Max and the man are then seen walking south across the parking lot, parallel to Highway 101, until they go off camera, still walking south. Eighteen minutes later, the man re-enters the casino alone. In a statement to authorities, the man said he and Max “went separate ways after leaving the casino.” Police told Dateline in 2018 that after conducting numerous interviews and searches they have suspects in the case but are not publicly releasing their names. Authorities say foul play is suspected and Max’s case is being treated as a homicide investigation. Since the casino is in Del Norte County, Curry County investigators handed the case over to the Del Norte County Sheriff’s Office once it was determined that’s where Max was last seen. In December 2021, NBC affiliate KOBI-TV reported that the Del Norte County Sheriff's Office announced it “anticipates significant progress\" in the investigation into Max’s disappearance based on new information and potential evidence. Dateline reached out to the sheriff’s office to confirm but has not yet heard back. If you have any information on Max’s case, please contact the Del Norte Sheriff's office at (707) 464-4191.\n\nMay “Maya” Millete\n\nMay “Maya” Millete, a defense contractor at Naval Base San Diego and mother of three, was last seen alive on January 7, 2021, by her husband, Larry Millete, at the family’s home in Chula Vista. In July 2021, Larry Millete was named a “person of interest” in the case. He denied any involvement in his wife’s disappearance. By October, he had been arrested and charged with her murder. At a press conference on October 20, 2021, authorities released details alleging that Larry Millete used a black Lexus to transport Maya’s body on January 8, 2021. The last recorded activity on Maya’s phone was on January 8. San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan revealed that Maya had scheduled an appointment with a divorce lawyer on January 12, but never made it. The D.A. noted that in 2020 Larry Millete had been visiting “spellcasters” — people purporting to wield magical powers of persuasion — in an effort to make Maya want to stay in the relationship. Larry Millete remains in the San Diego County Jail on no bond. In June of 2022, his defense attorney, Bonita Martinez, raised doubt as to her client’s competency to stand trial, which halted the criminal case. In September of 2022, San Diego Superior Court Judge Cindy Davis found that Millete is mentally competent. Millete is slated to have a three-week preliminary hearing, during which the prosecution will present evidence it believes will support the charges of murder and unlawful possession of an assault weapon filed against him. A date has not yet been set for the hearing. Maya’s family continues to hold prayer vigils online and in person. Her sister Maricris made a promise to Maya’s children: to find their mother’s body. If you have any information on the case or that can help locate Maya’s body, please call San Diego County Crime Stoppers at 888-580-8477, or CVPD at 619-691-5151.\n\nMichael Vanzandt\n\nMichael Vanzandt was last seen on the evening of March 5, 2016, while out in downtown Hermosa Beach, California. The 36-year-old was standing in line with friends outside the American Junkie gastropub at about 10:15 p.m., and then began walking toward a nearby liquor store. He has not been seen or heard from since. An Air Force veteran and father of three, Michael was going through a divorce at the time, but family members said there were absolutely no red flags in his personal life that would have led to his disappearance. Because he was an avid swimmer, they fear he may have gone in the water for a late-night dip. However, none of Michael’s belongings were found on the beach. Authorities say the case is still active and ongoing. If you have any information regarding Michael’s case, please call the Hermosa Beach Police Department at (310) 318-0360.\n\nMonique Figueroa\n\nMonique Figueroa told her family on May 19, 2015, that she was heading from her father’s home in Littlerock, California to visit friends in Los Angeles. Police recovered her 2004 Mercedes abandoned in a rural area outside Los Angeles several days later. Forensic tests were conducted, but no clues to Monique’s disappearance were uncovered. Several searches have been done over the past seven years in relation to the case, but have not yielded anything significant. “I love my daughter; I would love her remains to be found and this case brought to a closure,” Monique’s father, Jeff, told Dateline in 2016. A $20,000 reward for information leading to arrests and conviction in Monique’s disappearance was re-established by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on April 4, 2021. If you have any information regarding Monique’s case, please call the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department at (323) 890-5500 or Detective Karen Shonka at the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, Homicide Bureau at (323) 890-5621 and refer to Report No. 015-07325-2661-400.\n\nNancy Bromet\n\nNancy Bromet left her father’s home in Sunrise, Florida on November 12, 2015, to head to Bakersfield, California with her boyfriend, a long-haul truck driver. On November 17, the 37-year-old called her sister Laura saying she was in distress and wanted to come home. Laura told Dateline that after a few days of not hearing from her sister, she began to call Nancy’s boyfriend. On November 22, the boyfriend reported Nancy missing. According to police, he said that he had dropped Nancy off at a shopping mall outside El Centro, California while he was finishing deliveries and Nancy was not there when he returned. Shortly after Nancy disappeared, Dateline spoke with Detective Luis Hernandez of the El Centro Police Department. “We’ve talked to businesses in that area [of the shopping mall] where she was supposedly dropped off,” he said. “We passed out fliers, and put her on our El Centro Police Department Facebook page. But she hasn’t been seen since.” He noted that at that time there was no indication of foul play. The El Centro Police Department confirmed in November 2022 that the investigation is still open and active. Nancy is 5’2”, weighs 165 lbs., and has brown hair and eyes.

According to the Trinity County Sheriff’s Office, the 51-year-old was last seen on October 12, 2016, at the home she shared with her boyfriend. The details of what happened in the days leading up to her disappearance remain unclear. Dateline spoke with Stacey’s daughter Nicole Santos-Hammann in early 2017. She said her mother was usually in daily contact with family, as most of them lived in the Lewiston area. In fact, they’d all gotten together on October 2, to celebrate Stacey’s mother’s 74th birthday. But later that week, Nicole stopped hearing from her mother. Concern quickly grew, especially after news of Stacey’s grandmother’s death and no one could get ahold of her. “My grandmother called and said her phone was disconnected,” Nicole said. “I called and it was disconnected. So I drove up there. No one answered the door. I left a note asking that my mother call me – that it was urgent. I never got a call.” Nicole said the family reported Stacey missing on November 2, 2016. A Facebook page called ‘Help Find Stacey Smart’ has been created for Stacey’s family and friends to post information about her case. The Trinity County Sheriff’s Office considers the case to be active, but says no leads have produced any substantial information. No persons of interest have been named in the disappearance.

The then 19-year-old was last seen at the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California. After Sydney's parents in North Carolina were unable to reach her for several days, they reported her missing in North Carolina on October 1 and then again in San Francisco on October 2. Police have released security footage of the missing student from the day she disappeared. Sydney was last seen wearing a sweatshirt, dark-colored shorts, and slip-on blue Vans shoes. According to Sydney’s family and police, there has been no activity on her cell phone, social media or bank account.

The amount has now more than doubled and stands at $25,000. Sydney is described as being 5’10” and weighing 130 lbs. She has blonde hair and blue eyes.

Jackson Miller, missing May 15, 2010, Cameron Remmer, missing October 6, 2011, Shawn Dickerson, missing December 2, 2011, Crishtian Hughes, missing February 7, 2013, and Sean Sidi, missing May 21, 2013, all vanished from various areas of San Francisco without a trace. On March 26, 2021, a possible sighting of Jackson Miller at a Target in Woodland, California shined a new light on the cases. A woman called the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office and reported that she had been approached by a man who identified himself as “Jackson” and stated he was a missing person and asked her for a ride. She declined and he left. According to Oxygen, the National Center For Missing and Exploited Children has since conducted a forensic cross-analysis of the Target surveillance images. The results came back “inconclusive,\" John Bischoff, Vice President of the Missing Children Division, said. Leads and searches have unearthed virtually no clues in any of their cases, but members of the families have banded together to help in the search efforts and cope with their shared grief. If you have any information regarding any of these five cases, please contact the San Francisco Police Department at (415) 558-5508.\n\nCharlene Voight\n\nCharlene Voight had just moved to Littleton, Colorado from her family’s home in Southern California when she disappeared. The move, in part, was so she could finally be with her on-again, off-again boyfriend, Jeff Beier. The “always happy” 36-year-old had just graduated from Cal Poly Pomona with a degree in Landscape Architecture, and she was excited to start a new career, her sister Marilyn told Dateline shortly after Charlene disappeared. After not hearing from their daughter for several days, Charlene’s parents reported her missing on July 8, 2016. In March of 2018, authorities concluded a search of a landfill north of Denver in connection with Charlene’s case and while they did not find her body, they did find some of her clothes and the body of a small dog wrapped in a red sweater believed to have belonged to Charlene’s missing Chihuahua, Toby. The dog had been decapitated. In June 2020, an Arapahoe County grand jury in Colorado indicted Jeff Beier for Charlene’s murder. According to the affidavit, investigators believe Beier dumped the items at Tower Landfill in Commerce City, Colorado on July 2, 2016. He is charged with first-degree murder, first-degree felony murder, sexual assault, two counts of tampering with evidence, third-degree assault and two counts of attempting to influence a public servant, by misleading authorities about Charlene’s disappearance. He is also charged with aggravated animal cruelty. Shortly after Charlene vanished, Beier moved to Russia, where he has been in custody since 2020 pending a decision on extradition. If convicted, he faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Charlene’s body has not been found. If you have any information regarding Charlene’s case, please call the Littleton Police Department at (303) 794-1551.\n\nKelsie Schelling\n\nKelsie Schelling went missing from Pueblo, Colorado, on the night of February 4, 2013, after driving there from her home in Denver to meet her boyfriend, Donthe Lucas. The 21-year-old was two months pregnant with the couple's child, a reported stress point in the relationship. Video released by the Pueblo Police Department shows Schelling’s black 2011 Chevrolet Cruze parked in front of a Walmart store around noon the following day. The vehicle had been left there overnight. The next day at 7:20 a.m., an unidentified person can be seen getting into Schelling’s car and driving away. The car was found abandoned a week later at Saint Mary Corwin Medical Center. In November 2017, tips led police to conduct searches in several different areas of Pueblo in connection with Kelsie’s case, but authorities told Dateline they were unable to find anything of significance. On December 1, 2017, police arrested Donthe Lucas for the first-degree murder of Kelsie. Lucas pleaded not guilty.

On July 28, Leila’s pickup truck was found abandoned in a Walmart parking lot in Hollywood, two miles from where her son had been found. In August 2020, federal agents arrested Shannon Demar Ryan in Florida and charged him with kidnapping in connection with Leila’s disappearance. Shortly before Ryan’s arrest, he posted a video online discussing how he met up with Leila at a RaceTrac gas station in Hollywood on July 25 to buy her truck before her disappearance. According to the arrest affidavit provided to Dateline, Ryan told investigators he paid $3,000 to Leila for her truck and the three of them left in his 2004 Gold Lexus ES 330 to spend the day at Fort Lauderdale beach, leaving the truck behind. When they returned, he said he parked at the gas pumps at RaceTrac and told investigators that Leila and her son left in a dark sedan with several unknown men. He stated it was the last time he saw her. According to the affidavit, law enforcement reviewed the security footage from the RaceTrac gas station, which did not show Ryan’s car at the pumps as he described it, and did not show Leila leaving in a dark sedan. Investigators say a car resembling Ryan’s was spotted on security video in front of the apartment complex in Miramar just minutes before Leila’s son was found. On August 15, 2020 law enforcement officials searched Ryan’s Lexus and discovered a half-empty container of all-purpose cleaner with bleach, several black trash bags and a white powdery substance. In October 2020, the FBI in Miami searched the Monarch Hill Landfill in Pompano Beach, but did not release further details in the investigation, or how they were able to zero in on the landfill. “The FBI continues to actively pursue every lead related to this investigation,” the department said in a statement. “We are still seeking information about Leila Cavett’s disappearance.” Ryan is facing felony charges of second-degree murder, tampering with physical evidence and child neglect – all connected to Leila’s disappearance. Ryan has pleaded not guilty to all charges. He is being held at Broward County Jail without bond. The Broward County Clerk’s Office told Dateline in an email that Ryan has a court date set for December 16, 2022.
