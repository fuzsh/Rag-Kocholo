        "text": "In the land of asset owners, innovation is hard. Institutional investing—from its governance to delegations to IC decision-making—strongly favors known quantities, as those quantities fit neatly into the metrics asset owners often want and need. The joke among insiders is that when it comes to something new, asset owners want to be first in line... to be second in line. (Or, in my experience, tenth in line). They are looking for that Goldilocks entry point for new things: not so late that the benefits are already captured by the market, but not so early that they are taking career risks. And so, we at SLTI are always hunting for asset owner investors that, in the words of Henry Ford, \"do not know what can’t be done.\" Because, like Mr. Ford, we'd also want to transform an industry and help asset owners improve performance for the benefit of their stakeholders and the world. This week, I have two new innovators for you. Take a listen, so you too can be first line to be 10th in line... Kevin Bong, Chief Investment Strategist of the Alberta Investment Management Corp. On our DGF Pod, Kevin explains the fund's new 'Multi-Model Model' of institutional investment, which is a client-centric approach that delivers everything everywhere (almost) all at once to 25 different portfolios. https://lnkd.in/gRsyZmtj Mark Steed, Chief Investment Officer of the Arizona Public Safety Personnel Retirement System. On the BNY Pod, we explore the forces driving organizations to innovate and the importance of decision-making frameworks. He also discusses a most awesome and innovative approach to testing forecasting skills on his team. https://lnkd.in/gS6sdmZU"
