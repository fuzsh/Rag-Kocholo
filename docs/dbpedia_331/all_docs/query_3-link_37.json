        "text": "Derek Puffer, the man on trial in Calgary for fatally stabbing his mother and stepfather, testified in his own defence on Wednesday.\n\nThe 40-year-old faces two charges of second-degree murder in the deaths last July of 64-year-old Donna Lee Power and 71-year-old Bill Powers.\n\nBill Powers was a well-known sportscaster who retired in October 2009 after almost 50 years in the sports broadcasting and communications business.\n\nDerek Puffer police interview released at murder trial\n\nDerek Puffer told police he killed Bill and Donna Lee Powers\n\nWearing a royal-blue prison jump suit and his ankles shackled, Puffer calmly told the courtroom he was instructed to kill his victims.\n\nThe couple was stabbed repeatedly in their sleep at their Braeside home in southwest Calgary.\n\nPolice found Puffer later that night naked with blood on his hands at a nearby bus shelter at 14th Street and Southland Drive S.W.\n\nPuffer testified that he had been hearing music, voices and chanting in his head in the days leading up to the killings. He was unable to sleep and had stopped eating, he said.\n\nHe told court he thought someone had inserted a computer chip in his head and that if he didn't listen to the voices, the chip would cause his heart to explode.\n\nPsychiatrist recommends medication\n\nPuffer, who suffers from schizophrenia, testified he heard the voices from his early teens into his 20s.​ He spent several months in hospital in 1995 and again the next year, but said he stopped taking his medication because he thought he could manage the illness on his own.\n\nHe testified the voices started again several months before Bill and Donna Lee were killed in early 2013 along with chants of, “Come, come, come and oompah, loompah.\"\n\nCourt of Queen’s Bench Justice Kristine Eidsvik released video evidence Tuesday of a police interview with Puffer that was shot in the hours after he was arrested. On the recording, Puffer tells a detective he had been hearing voices and music in his head for days.\n\nThe trial began Monday with Puffer pleading not guilty to the murders. He is the first witness for the defence, which is trying to argue he shouldn't be held criminally responsible because of his mental illness.\n\nDr. Kenneth Hashman testified Wednesday that Puffer should be held at the southern Alberta forensic psychiatry centre, a secure facility, instead of prison until he is deemed fit for release.\n\nHashman says Puffer isn't criminally responsible for the slayings because of a severe mental disorder. He says Puffer experienced command hallucinations and thought he was being controlled by an outside force that prevented him from knowing his actions were wrong.\n\nHashman says Puffer must stay on anti-psychotic medication for the rest of his life to prevent him from hurting himself or others.\n\nThe defence is expected to call another psychiatrist before wrapping up its case on Thursday."
