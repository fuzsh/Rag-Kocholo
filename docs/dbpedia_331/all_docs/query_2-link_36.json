The large primary bedroom boasts a beautiful ensuite bath, and large closets. In the cooler months you can enjoy the warmth of not one, but two fireplaces. An enclosed porch in the back is the perfect place for morning coffee or enjoying the lush green of your acreage. There's two garages for your cars or toys, and an additional out back. The land boasts a beautiful pond, trails to hike or ride, and wooded land. The location is secluded enough to feel like country, but close enough to the highway to easily get to work, shopping or events. Qualified buyers may tour by appointment."
