        "text": "The undiagnosed disease is connected to severe muscle pain and affects the heart, according to the user, who shared their story on Reddit\n\nA 25-year-old Reddit user shared the worsening conditions of their undiagnosed neurological disorder, which they said impacts sleep to the point where they don't think they'll survive much longer\n\nIn a Reddit post with more than 11,000 upvotes, they noted it’s similar to Fatal Familial Insomnia, but shared that doctors haven't been able to diagnose the condition — apart from the fact that it stems from ongoing spinal issues\n\nThe user said they had given up hope — but comments and suggestions in the thread “motivated me” to find help\n\nA 25-year-old with a rare, undiagnosed neurological disease that keeps them from sleeping shared, “I don’t know how long I have, but can’t see myself making it more than a year.“\n\nIn a post on Reddit’s popular AMA — Ask Me Anything — subreddit, user BPD-Recovery shared their journey with this undiagnosed disease, which they said they've been told is similar to Fatal Familial insomnia.\n\nAs the Cleveland Clinic explains, Fatal Familial insomnia “is a rare genetic condition that causes sleeping difficulties (insomnia), memory loss (dementia) and involuntary muscle twitching. This condition gets worse over time and it’s life-threatening.”\n\nAs BPD-Recovery shared, the issues all stem from their spine.\n\nRelated: Woman, 25, Is Allergic to Water: ‘My Scalp Would Be Bleeding After Showering’\n\n“I have had severe muscular pain since 16. Initially started like carpal tunnel. Muscles progressively get worse over time. In time, discovered all musc. Issues were coming from left shoulder,” the user wrote in the post, which had 11,000 upvotes and more than 1,600 comments.\n\n“Now, I cannot breathe normally due to muscle tension,\" they continued. \"My torso is now lightly twisted away from my problem side, My spine causes my sleeplessness. When my back was better, and I could release it, my sleep would immediately resume.”\n\nThe Redditor shared that two years ago, “my spine completely locked up, and I have not experienced normal sleep since.”\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\nThe user said that when they sleep, they will “Wake up. Extremely exhausted. Can barely move. Energy comes barely online around 3 p.m. Energy comes fully online around 7 p.m. Feel great then.”\n\nAlthough they shared that their symptoms are similar to Fatal Familial Insomnia, they said “There is no name for my condition. I have progressively deteriorated over 2 years. It began with hallucinations, irritability, extreme mood swings, exhaustion, etc.”\n\n“In the last 4 months it’s began affecting my heart,\" the user further noted. \"My nervous system is f-----. I have severe dysautonomia, which means my heart and blood pressure go from super low to super high erratically. I’ve been in and out of emergency rooms for borderline heart attacks about 7 times in the past 3 months.”\n\nRelated: Yes, Your Smartphone Is Keeping You From Sleeping — and Not Just Because You're Scrolling\n\nThey shared that they're struggling with cognition, saying “I have also had to bring ppl to talk to doctors because I was so delirious. I have been too tired to speak on hundreds of occasions.”\n\n“I regularly zone out and stare at walls. I forget what I did 30 seconds prior. I literally microsleep while awake,” they shared. “I have strained pasta onto my countertop, hit a parked car in my driveway, called people the wrong names, forgot basic words, said 'oh hey don’t do xyz' as I was doing it.”\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nAlthough the Redditor noted that “gabapentin (a neurosuppresant) helps marginally,” they admitted that “I am f------ terrified of dying. The cardiac issues are recent and I think I’m on my last leg.”\n\nThe thread was full of commenters who suggested new treatment options — from calling specialists to trying new therapies— which may have given the user hope.\n\n“I kind of gave up due to extreme despair from years of medical gaslighting/not getting anywhere,\" the Redditor noted, adding, \"This thread has motivated me. I called Mayo Clinic and a few places today.”\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
