        "text": "Victoria was the Queen of the United Kingdom from 1837 to 1901. She was the mother of next monarch, Edward VII.\n\nBirth[]\n\nSoon after her parents wedding, her mother, Princess Victoria, Duchess of Kent, became pregnant and the Duke, Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, was determined that the child be born in Britain so it gave it rights to the throne. Heavily pregnant, the Duchess and her husband returned to Britain in April 1819, accompanied by a German midwife.\n\nPrincess Alexandrina Victoria was born on 24 May 1819 at Kensington Palace. At this time, the monarchy was in disarray as the family was associated with mistresses, illegitimate children and loose living. The country itself was ill-at-ease with the monarchy, the cost of supporting their antics and expensive lifestyles were being questioned and republican movements were beginning to voice dissent. Parliament was also trying to establish its independence from the monarch and was putting Britain on the path to becoming a fully democratic country.\n\nVictoria was named after her grandfather, Tsar Alexander I. She was born as fifth in line to the throne. At the time of her birth, George III was king. She was baptised on 26 June 1819 at Kensington Palace.\n\nDeath of Her Father and Grandfather[]\n\nA consequence of the Duke's enjoyment was that he was seriously in debt and during the winter of 1819-20, the new family went on holiday to a coastal resort of Sidmouth in Devon as the Duke tried to be more restrained financially. After walking in the cold sea air, the Duke caught a chill. A chill from which he never recovered from when he caught pneumonia and died a few days later.\n\nThe Duke of Kent was buried at Windsor on 23 January 1820 and only six days later, his father, King George III, also died. The Prince Regnant, George, now became King George IV and the fatherless Alexandrina now became the focus on the future of the Crown. Unless the Duke of Clarence had another child, she would be the next monarch of the United Kingdom.\n\nChildhood[]\n\nThe Duchess of Kent was now widowed and alone with three children; Charles and Feodora (from her first marriage) and young Drina (Alexandrina). The Duke of Kent's debts had to be settled and luckily for the Duchess, her brother, Prince Leopold, settled the finances as he wanted the baby's future claim to the throne to be secured. He advised his sister not to return to Coburg in Germany.\n\nFeodore's governess, Fraulein Louise Lehzen, was brought over from Hanover to attend to the education of Drina. Leopold also stayed to advise Drina. The young princess spent most of her childhood surrounded by women and was brought up speaking German. It wasn't until she was three that she would be taught English, despite England being the country she was born and raised in.\n\nThe current king, George IV, did not have a good relationship with the Duchess as she kept demanding for an increase in her allowance as well as the Germanic way the princess was being brought up. As the years passed, the relationship between the Duchess and the King deteriorated as gossip emerged about the relationship between her and Sir John Conroy.\n\nIn early childhood, Princess Victoria and her mother were very close, the Duchess rarely letting her out of her sight. They actually shared a bedroom until Victoria actually ascended the throne. During her early years, Drina had the presence of her much older siblings, Charles and Feodora. However when Drina was nine, Feodora married in 1828 and moved to Germany.\n\nDrina was mostly separated from other children and was oblivious to events taking place outside of Kensington Palace. She was isolated from everyone and also had little contact with members of the Royal Family. Drina was delighted when her sister visited Kensington Palace with her two children when she was fifteen years old. She enjoyed playing with them as she didn't have contact with other children at all. Her Uncle Leopold was also a key-figure in Drina's upbringing and he regarded himself as a father-figure to her. He had rejected becoming King of Greece but in 1830 the newly independent Belgium invited him to be King and he accepted and left London for good.\n\nDrina's education was left to Fraulein Lehzen, who persuaded her to keep a diary. And this she did. Drina was brought up with three languages, there were lessons in drawing, painting and singing (which she found a welcoming break from the loneliness of Palace life). In 1830, the year of George IV's death and his brother William's succession as William IV, Lehzen decided it was appropriate for Drina to know her destiny. She learned that she was first in line to the throne. On realising this, Drina was reported to have said, \"I will be good.\"\n\nDue to her isolation and because she was surrounded by adults, Drina developed her own little world in the form of dolls. These dolls each had a grand name and exquisite clothing. They were often found in the Princess' fantasy plays. She also had a pet spaniel called Dash, who was given to her mother by Sir John Conroy but adopted by Drina. The Princess also loved horse riding and treks were made through Hyde Park along the newly built roads to Regent's Park.\n\nIn 1835, the family stayed at Canterbury en route to Ramsgate, where they were joined by Uncle Leopold and his new wife, Louisa. They stayed in a small house that overlooked the sea, with France visible in the distance. There was a formal welcome for the royal visitors also.\n\nPreparation[]\n\nVictoria grew up and tensions between her and her mother increased. However when George IV died, Victoria did manage to re-establish the relationship of her mother and the Court by visiting William IV and his wife, Queen Adelaide, regularly. The couple came to regarding Victoria as a daughter and by 1837, she was visiting the sick King often and supporting the Queen.\n\nSir John Conroy was annoying the Princess and she despised him for his power over her mother and herself; she was disturbed by the rumours circulating that her mother and Conroy were lovers. The Duchess and Sir John even tried to have a regency established in the event that Victoria came to the throne before she was twenty-one. Conroy was also jealous that Fraulein Lehzen was now seen as more than a governess and more of an adviser and friend.\n\nBy the spring of 1837, it was public knowledge that the health of William IV was declining rapidly. The relationship between mother and daughter was also still deteriorating. On 24 May 1837, Victoria celebrated her eighteenth birthday and Prince Albert, knowing of Uncle Leopold's plans for the cousins, sent her a letter of birthday greetings to which she replied. She rode in a carriage where she saw people eager to get a glimpse of their future queen. A celebratory ball was held at St James' Palace, which she attended with Fraulein Lehzen and her lady-in-waiting, Lady Flora Hastings. She enjoyed dancing with many eligible men, to the pleasure of the establishment eager to see her marry an Englishman.\n\nAccession[]\n\nVictoria's eighteenth birthday was an important occasion as it meant that she was now eligible to receive her own income from the Civil List. The King's health was vastly deteriorating so Victoria made several trips to be at her uncle's bed side and to comfort the Queen. Less than four weeks after her birthday, her uncle died and Great Britain had their first Queen Regnant since Queen Anne in 1702.\n\nKing William IV died in the early hours of 20 June 1837. As the death was expected, William Howley, Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Chamberlain, Lord Conyngham, and the King's doctor were all present at Windsor. Their immediate action was to travel to Kensington Palace to inform the Princess Alexandrina Victoria of the death and that she was now Queen of Great Britain.\n\nThey arrived at the Palace at 5AM but were barred from seeing the Princess by her mother. The Duchess finally succumbed to the demands of the important visitors and at 6AM, Drina descended the stairs to meet the Archbishop and Lord Chamberlain, who fell to their knees and proclaimed her Queen. \"Drina\" was her name from the past and she would now be known as \"Queen Victoria\".\n\nRespects were made to the deceased King and Victoria left to change into a black dress to mourn him. At breakfast, she discussed plans for the day with Baron Stockmar, who recently returned from a visit to King Leopold with instructions to support the new Queen. Shortly after 9AM, her Prime Minister and friend, Lord Melbourne, arrived where they dealt with affairs of state.\n\nThe Queen presided over her first Council Meeting at 11:30AM in the Red Saloon at Kensington Palace. Wearing her black dress (which was shown as white in the paintings), she was led by the Dukes of Cumberland and Sussex to the throne to be sworn in as Queen of Great Britain and Ireland. During that first day of her reign, she wrote several letters. One of these was to her Uncle Leopold, informing him of the death of King William IV. Another was to her half-sister, Feodora, and another to the widowed, Queen Adelaide. Prince Albert wrote to Victoria to offer condolences of the King's death and to congratulate her on her accession to the throne.\n\nThe next day, Princess Alexandrina Victoria was proclaimed Queen Victoria to the nation from a window at St. James' Palace. Sermons were preached and prayers said in church, chapels and synagogues around the nation to mourn the King and welcome the new Queen.\n\nMove to Buckingham Palace[]\n\nOn 13 July 1837, the Queen and the Duchess of Kent moved into Buckingham Palace. The Palace, which had once been home to George III's consort, Queen Charlotte, had been rebuilt by John Nash to the orders of George IV and completed by William IV. Victoria was the first sovereign to live in the revamped version of the Palace. Here, for the first time ever, Victoria had her own bedroom and she ordered that her bedroom would be next to Baroness Lehzen and had a door in the adjoining wall. Her mother had assumed that they would still share a bedroom and because Victoria denied, she was furious and hurt.\n\nShe found her early days at Buckingham Palace hectic but she also tired of Windsor Castle, where her nights spent playing cards were not to her taste. The Duke of Wellington was vital to the Queen in her early days but not as important as the Prime Minister, Lord Melbourne. The Queen and Prime Minister dined together most evenings and their friendship flourished. As well as concerns with matters of state, letters from her Uncle Leopold and her tense relationship with her mother, she also discussed more personal matters with the Prime Minister including her figure and clothing. The question of marriage was also spoken between them and the Queen told the Prime Minister that she had no intention to marry and that she was wedded to her job and country.\n\nVery early on, Victoria learned that her position as head of state required her to tread carefully when dealing with Parliament. Unlike Leopold in Belgium, her role, demanded by Parliament, was developing into that of a constitutional monarch. Parliament was slowly becoming accountable to a democratic electorate rather than to a whim of a monarch.\n\nCoronation[]\n\nQueen Victoria celebrated her nineteenth birthday on 24 May 1838, four weeks before her Coronation. A huge state ball to celebrate the Queen's birthday was held at Buckingham Palace. To Victoria's disappointment, Lord Melbourne declined her offer to dance and went home early. Society's eligible young men danced with the Queen. She danced the night away and she left the ball at 4AM.\n\nLord Melbourne believed that it was his duty to prepare Victoria for the Coronation. Plans for Queen Victoria's Coronation had been heavily debated and argued over because there was no precedent for the modern coronation of a Queen Regnant. Eventually, it was decided that she would use St Edward's Chapel for her robe room.\n\nThe form and length of the service had to be considered and the Earl Marshal, the Duke of Norfolk, had to prepare a guest list. Invitations had to be printed, honours bestowed, robes and other clothes had to be designed, crowns and rings fitted and banquets organised. The Government would be paying and the Treasury insisted that cost must be considered.\n\nUnlike modern royal events, rehearsals for Queen Victoria's Coronation were kept to a minimum and the day before the ceremony, she visited Westminster Abbey with Lady Lansdowne, Lady Barham, Lord Conyngham and Colonel Wemyss to inspect the preparations. It had been decided that the procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey was to be more accessible to the general public to give them a glimpse of their new queen. People were beginning to line the streets and the party was met at the Abbey by Lord Melbourne. Victoria had tried two different thrones and remarked that they were too low.\n\nAt 3:17 in the morning, the queen was awakened by the gunshots of a 21-gun salute announcing the dawn of her Coronation Day. Sightseers were already appearing in Green Park. Meanwhile, the Queen was preparing herself and had a light breakfast and dressed in silk stockings and white satin pumps. At 10 o'clock she was ready to board the State Coach for the procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Abbey. The procession was massive and included trumpeters and carriages of ambassadors and representatives from Mexico, Portugal, Sweden, Saxony, Hanover, Greece, Sardinia, Spain, United States, Netherlands, Brazil, Bavaria, Denmark, Belgium, Prussia, Austria and Turkey. The Duchess of Kent rode with her attendants in a carriage drawn by six horses, followed by similar carriages holding the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester. Finally came eleven carriages holding members of the Queen's household and they led the way for the State Coach carrying the Queen. The beautiful coach was drawn by eight cream horses and eight walking grooms. A Yeoman of the Guard by each wheel and two footmen were at the door. The whole journey from start to finish was exactly one hour long.\n\nBy the time the State Coach arrived, Westminster Abbey was packed with the invited guests. Peers had been instructed to wear their robes and wives had to wear court dress without feathers, lappets or trains. Others had to dress in full court dress or uniform. Queen Victoria entered and she was met by noblemen carrying the ancient coronation regalia and the Bishops, holding the Patina, Chalice and the Bible, who would form part of the procession to the Transept. Above, the Duchess of Kent, Charles and Feodora as well as the Baroness Lehzen looked down at her as the choir sang, the orchestra played and the ceremony continued, led by the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nAfter the Recognition and Oath, the Queen retired to St Edward's Chapel to remove the kirtle and mantle. Victoria came back to the Abbey wearing the splendid gold supertunica, which had been specially designed for her. Sitting in St Edward's chair, Victoria awaited the most important part of the proceedings. Knights held a gold canopy above her while the Archbishop anointed her forehead. Then she put on her dalmatica or imperial mantle for the investiture with the Regalia and Crown.\n\nGradually, the ceremony drew to a close. To leave the ceremony and the Abbey, she changed crowns and wore the Imperial State Crown. A band of ermine cushioned it on to the head. The procession went up the nave and through the West Door to awaiting crowds. The newly crowned Queen got into the State Coach for the return journey back to Buckingham Palace. Spectators lined the route and Victoria was delighted with their excitement.\n\nPossible Marriage to Prince Albert[]\n\nBy 1839, the plans of King Leopold, backed by the Duchess of Kent and their brother Prince Ernest of Saxe-Coburg, for Victoria's marriage had not been dropped. Nor would her English subjects let the matter be dropped. Wanting to avoid another German marriage, they paraded eligible young men including her cousin, the Duke of Cambridge. Finding a suitable husband would be problematic as she was the most powerful person in the world and a woman too. To find a man who would want to take a subservient role to his wife could be near impossible.\n\nBecause of this constant barrage from all sides, or because she was beginning to feel lonely, she relented and agreed to meeting her cousin, Prince Albert, again. Both were now aware of their Uncle Leopold's plans for them both. She discussed the proposal with Lord Melbourne, who was uncertain of the suitability of the alliance. Melbourne thought that German-speaking Albert might side with the Duchess of Kent against Victoria, thus weakening her position.\n\nThere was also a problem with Russia at this time. Dealing with Russia was an ongoing task as Tsar Nicholas I was trying to expand his boundaries and had recently invaded Afghanistan. The Tsar didn't like the Coburg's and Melbourne didn't want Britain to get embroiled in European arguments. He was also concerned that Parliament would oppose the match, regarding it as further German influence over Britain. He also wondered if Victoria was even mature enough for marriage. There was no rush for marriage and he was delighted when Victoria decided to wait before marrying. He wasn't so happy, however, that Victoria invited Prince Albert to visit once again.\n\nScandals[]\n\nBefore the visit of Prince Albert, Victoria's reign was tested when she experienced several scandals in her household.\n\nThe first of these concerned Lady Flora Hastings, her long-time lady-in-waiting. Victoria had always mistrusted her and thought of her to be a spy for Sir John Conroy's camp. In the spring of 1839, Lady Flora developed a swelling in her stomach and she often complained about the pain. Gossip was starting, in which both the Queen and Melbourne participated in. Despite Lady Flora's protestations, the presumption was that this unmarried, religious woman must be pregnant, and probably made so by Sir John Conroy, who was long believed to have been having an affair with Victoria's mother, the Duchess of Kent. Despite the fact that even her physician had found no evidence that she was pregnant, the Queen continued to believe that Lady Flora was pregnant.\n\nThe gossip in the Royal circles became public when the Hastings family published the physician's findings of no pregnancy in an attempt to clear Lady Flora's name and to damage the Queen and the Prime Minister. The popular press loved it all and made no attempt to hide the fact they were slating the Queen. There was one moment of relief for Victoria though as Sir John Conroy resigned in June, following pressure from the Duke of Wellington and the offer of peerage in Ireland. Although Lady Flora's swelling had reduced, she was still extremely ill and she died in July 1839. The post mortem revealed that she had a cancerous tumour on the liver. While the Queen's reputation were damaged in the eyes of the public, who were appalled at the way she treated Lady Flora, the departure of Sir John Conroy at least meant that relationship between mother and daughter could be brought back again.\n\nThe second of these events concerned the government. Lord Melbourne's government was weakened after its majority reduced in the General Election of 1837. The continuous closeness of the Prime Minister and the Queen was also weakening Melbourne's position as he watched his parliamentary majority slide away. By 1839, as the Lady Flora Hastings scandal was in full flow, Lord Melbourne resigned. Queen Victoria was upset about this and wept at losing her best friend. She took an instant dislike to new Prime Minister, Sir Robert Peel, because of this. The first meeting between the Queen and Peel was frosty as they each disliked the other. His distrust of the Whig reforms made him an attractive leader to many right-wing traditional Tories.\n\nQueen Victoria let it known that the Royal Family will always be Whig and let her hatred of the Tories be known. The Duke of Wellington tried to intervene and was appalled at the Queen's childishness when she asked him to be Prime Minister. He declined. The Queen was distraught and even refused to eat as things weren't going well. However, Baroness Lehzen came to Victoria and supported her in her loneliness. The second meeting between Queen and Prime Minister was even worse than the first as Peel chose to discuss members of the Household. The Queen's Household at this time was mostly made up of Whigs or women married to Whig MPs or Whig peers. Peel naturally wished to appoint Tory members but the Queen refused to accept any. She couldn't see how women could, through their husbands, damage parliament.\n\nOn May 10, in an attempt to rescue Victoria, Melbourne addressed Parliament on the Crisis of the Ladies of the Bedchamber. He gave such an effective eulogy that enough MPs were won over to defeat Peel. Lord Melbourne was back in office and the Queen was delighted. That evening she hosted a ball at Buckingham Palace for Tsarevitch Alexander of Russia, whom she was being introduced to as a possible husband but whom she had little interest in. Since the Bedchamber Crisis, there has never been a change in the Royal Household with a change of Government.\n\nBored with the aspects of court life, and bruised by the Flora Hastings affair and the Crisis of The Ladies of the Bedchamber, the Queen began to suffer from emotional and physical stress. She gained weight and tried to diet by drinking less beer and missing meals. The colour of her hair wasn't to her liking and she began to bathe more and brush her teeth for longer periods of time. She also complained about headaches and feeling sick. News that the Queen might be depressed reached the Court and she had a close eye kept on her. During these periods, the Queen found solace in the form of horse riding.\n\nPrince Albert's Visit[]\n\nBy the summer of 1839, it was clear that marriage needed to be looked at and resolved. Victoria's English family were unhappy about the thought of her marrying a German and didn't approve of the visit of the Saxe-Coburg cousins. Victoria herself was uncertain, and particularly wary of making commitment to her cousin, whom at this stage she viewed more as a friend than a future husband. Having persuaded Leopold to put off their visit as long as possible, Victoria agreed that they should come to Britain in autumn of 1839.\n\nLeopold and Stockmar were delighted when Victoria eventually agreed to the visit. They were also anxious that she would prefer Prince Albert's brother, Prince Ernest, who was definitely unsuitable. He was more like his father, whereas Albert was more like his mother. Prince Albert was also uncertain about Leopold's plan. He was unimpressed about the reports he had seen on his cousin - that she didn't like nature, had an unhealthily close relationship with Lord Melbourne and was bored with court life. What he wanted was to see if Victoria was as into him as he was into her.\n\nAfter a dreadful Channel crossing, the party arrived at Windsor on 10 October. Immediately upon seeing Albert, Victoria was in love and liked the idea of marrying him. For the Queen, it was the first time she was able to form a friendship with someone her own age or feel the emotional charge of passion. She kept her thoughts private, however, though she did discuss them with Lord Melbourne. Five days later she summoned Prince Albert to her room and asked him to marry her. He agreed and in German told her how happy he would be to spend his life with her. From then on they became very close and made no attempt to hide their passion.\n\nLord Melbourne was very emotional about the Queen's decision and was still concerned as it may still not work out. Baron Stockmar, too, was uncertain on the match and its imbalance. He was also concerned about the headstrong Queen marrying an introverted intellectual. The young couple were had different upbringings. For Albert, he was excited about his future role as a Prince of Great Britain. To such a capable and cultured young man, London was certainly preferable to spending the rest of his life in Coburg. There was uncertainty too though. He was giving up everything for Victoria, and assumed he would get her undivided attention in return, naively unaware of her commitment to her country.\n\nThe Queen discussed with Lord Melbourne how Albert had only eyes for her but was furious when Melbourne hinted that straying would come in the future and made him withdraw the remark. The Queen also told him how she dreaded having children and all the upset they may cause.\n\nAlbert left London on 14 November 1839 but returned forever in February 1840. The Queen had announced her intention to marry at a Privy Council meeting on 23 November and the 10 February was set for her wedding day. Immediately, rows erupted regarding the marriage due to the possible German influence in Britain again and on Albert's future titles, role and stipend. Some members of Parliament, led by Colonel Charles Sibthorp, MP for Lincoln, were opposed to the marriage to a foreigner and rejected all possibility of a peerage to Albert. Colonel Sibthorp would continue to attack Prince Albert.\n\nVictoria also rejected the idea of a peerage as this title she saw as too low status. She wanted him to be King Consort and to have precedence over other members of the family. For years, the Queen battled to have Albert be known as Prince Consort, finally succeeding in 1853, when she titled him herself. The question of Albert's allowance was also discussed. Many were reminded of Leopold receiving £50,000 per annum on his marriage to Princess Charlotte and still continue to claim it despite her death. There was mistrust of another German doing the same, when suddenly Leopold, realizing the problem and not wanting to jeopardize the marriage, stopped claiming this money.\n\nEventually, despite Colonel Sibthorp's protestations, Parliament agreed to a stipend of £30,000 per annum to be paid to Prince Albert upon his marriage to Victoria. £20,000 off what the Queen was expecting, she was furious believing that his foreignness is the root of this issue.\n\nWedding of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert[]\n\nThe Coburgers were jubilant that one of their princes would be marrying the Queen of Great Britain. There was great revelry and many farewell parties to demonstrate their warmth of feeling when Albert left Coburg. Accompanied by his father, brother and members of the Household, they left by horse-drawn carriages on the morning of 28 January 1840. The party eventually arrived in London on 6 February, four days before the wedding. Guests were invited and a simple service was planned. Suitable clothes were designed and made in a style that befitted a bride rather than a queen. Above all, Queen Victoria did not want her husband to feel subservient to her.\n\nThe Queen discussed her dress choice with Lord Melbourne. The elegant, simple dress, designed by the Pre-Raphaelite painter, William Dyce of the Government Design School. The large collar and cuffs were made by lace makers from Honiton in Devon, who had been suffering because of the recent fashion for Brussels lace. Queen Victoria continued to patronise the Honiton lace industry throughout her life.\n\nThe morning of 10 February 1840, was dull and wet but nothing would take away from Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's excitement. After breakfast, she had her hair done and then dressed in her wedding gown. Accompanied by her mother and the Duchess of Sutherland, she went by carriage from Buckingham Palace to the Chapel Royal at St James' Palace. Here, the couple took their wedding vows and the Queen was overjoyed when Albert placed the ring on her finger. After signing the register, they returned to Buckingham Palace where the Queen changed into a simple white silk gown and Albert into a Windsor coat. At four in the afternoon, they left the Palace for Windsor, the journey made longer than expected because of the number of well-wishers lining the route. At Windsor, the couple spent a night together, during which disclosed by the Queen, they slept little and enjoyed much love and affection.\n\nFirst Pregnancy[]\n\nThe Queen dreaded the prospect of pregnancy and childbirth. She had seen how risky it was in this time, due to the death of Princess Charlotte. However, by the middle of March, six weeks after her wedding, she was beginning to feel unwell. She was pregnant. As had become usual with anything that now happened to her, a problem arose. This time, because there was no heir to the throne, it was a problem of a regency. A Regency Bill was passed enabling Prince Albert to be made the Regent for a child in the event of the Queen's death at childbirth or before the child reached age of majority.\n\nEvery morning, encouraged by Lord Melbourne, Prince Albert sat at his desk next to his wife as she dealt with state papers, even writing her signature when necessary. Character differences between the couple were made apparent. Victoria was relaxed and liked to listen to light music and sing, whereas Albert was more formal and restrained. Soon, he was becoming desperate for some intellectual stimulation. Although the Queen regarded herself as informal, the structure of court etiquette was very rigid and Albert began to find it stifling, especially at Buckingham Palace.\n\nArguments arose between the English Queen and German Prince as it became apparent that Albert had nothing to do. He was growing bored and depressed as he had no role to play. In an effort to accommodate him, Victoria rethought domestic arrangements and agreed to move to the Court of Windsor for most of the time as Albert found the atmosphere there more agreeable.\n\nThere were also tensions between Albert and the Queen's closest people, including Lehzen. Lehzen and Albert didn't get on. Stockmar asked Melbourne for his support in ousting Lehzer but Melbourne refused, stating he had found her the most amenable and loyal to the Queen and himself. However, Lehzen's position with the Queen weakened as Albert's increased and in 1842, she retired from the Household and returned to Germany.\n\nRelations with Parliament also began to warm up as they invited Albert to sit beside the Queen at the State Opening of Parliament. The Queen's popularity also started to increase again as many assassination attempts were made. On June 10, they encountered their first attempt. As they drove up Constitution Hill, an eighteen year old called Edward Oxford, fired two pistols at them. The watching people demanded he be killed and they were amazed at how the Queen was calm and carried on as normal with the drive. Oxford was sentenced to 27 years in an asylum before being allowed to emigrate.\n\nVictoria didn't enjoy pregnancy, finding it a blocking factor in her blissful time she spent with her husband. Her size bothered her and as did the discomfort. She also had to continue with her full time duties at the same time. Albert provided much needed support for the pregnant queen and as the pregnancy progressed, she became more and more dependent on him for advice in affairs on matters of state and also on the more personal aspects of her impending delivery.\n\nBirth of Princess Victoria, later the Princess Royal[]\n\nOn 21 November 1840, Queen Victoria gave birth to Princess Victoria Adelaide Mary Louise (later Victoria, Princess Royal), ten months after her wedding. The Princess was the first of the couples nine children. When Victoria was born, the doctor said \"Oh madame, it's a girl\" to which the Queen responded, \"Never mind, next time it will be a prince!\" She was baptised on 10 February 1841 in the Throne Room of Buckingham Palace. The dowager Queen Adelaide, widow of King William IV, stood as one of her godmothers. The Princess was made Princess Royal on 19 January 1841.\n\nThere was rejoice in the country at the birth of Princess Victoria Adelaide as the unpopular King of Hanover was now seen as to not have the possibility of inheriting the crown. Prince Albert told his father that 'Victoria is as well as if nothing had happened' and also, 'The little one is very well and very merry... I should certainly have liked it better if she had been a son, as would Victoria also; but, at the same time, we must be equally satisfied and thankful as it is'. As the Queen recovered from the birth, she wouldn't let anyone except her husband carry her from the sofa into bed. Wherever he was and when Victoria needed him, he would drop what he was doing and be with her.\n\nVictoria and Albert's first Christmas together was at Windsor Castle and they were now a family of three. Every day, Albert would skate on the pond at Frogmore and sometimes, the Queen would also join in. They had three Christmas trees that decorated the hall. This was a German custom that was popularised by the Queen and the Prince but introduction of the Christmas Tree wasn't down to them, instead to Queen Adelaide.\n\nChange in Government and Health Fears for the Princess Royal[]\n\nIn May 1841, Lord Melbourne's ministry was defeated and the change that the Queen dreaded was now inevitable. There would be a new party in power and a new Prime Minister. This new Prime Minister was Sir Robert Peel. Peel had a lot in common with Prince Albert and they soon became firm friends. This also made the Queen change her opinion and attitude on Peel as she saw how her husband liked him. When Melbourne resigned, she was also seven months pregnant with her second child.\n\nAt the end of July 1841, the Queen was enduring anxiety over her daughter's health. The Princess Royal, who was nicknamed 'Pussy' was unable to digest her food, lost weight and cut her teeth with difficulty. The Queen's pregnancy was also not pleasant as she felt 'wretched', depressed and dreaded the ordeal ahead of her. The Queen wrote in her diary, 'Till the end of August she was such a magnificent, strong fat child, that it is a great grief to see her so thin, pale and changed'. On 11th October, it was feared that the Queen would go into premature labour and again on 26th October. On the 28th October, the Queen wrote, 'I unfortunately was feeling very wretched and left the drawing room early'. The Queen also said that from 3rd November, the Princess Royal was given 'only asses' milk' and for the moment she improved.\n\nBirth of Prince Albert Edward, later King Edward VII[]\n\nOn 8 November, the Queen was feeling wretched once again but didn't want to worry as she had so many false alarms before. However, the next day on 9 November 1841, she called for Mrs Lilly, who called on Dr Locock and dispatched a messenger to the Duchess of Kent. The labour was hard and the Queen recalled, 'my sufferings were really very severe, and I didn't know what I should have done, but for the great comfort and support my beloved Albert was to me.' Eventually at 12 minutes to 11, the baby arrived. This baby would be the first male heir to the throne for seventy-nine years. The future King was a handsome baby with 'large, dark blue eyes'. The whole country rejoiced at the news of a newborn Prince. When the Queen took the Prince to see the Duke of Wellington, the crowds were immense.\n\nOn 4th December 1841, he was made Prince of Wales by Letters Patent from the Queen. There were reports that the nanny, Mrs Southey (a lady that was recommended by the Archbishop of Canterbury), was giving the baby Prince alcohol. The Queen also had concerns over her commitment to the royal children and kept complaining about being homesick. Therefore on 26th December, Mrs Southey said she didn't feel 'equal' to managing the royal children and would resign as soon as someone else was found. The appointment of a new nanny wasn't given until 18th April 1842. Lady Sarah Lyttelton accepted the offer. She had both rank and nobility and was already made Lady of the Bedchamber by Victoria in 1838.\n\nThe Prince of Wales was baptised on 25 January 1842 as Prince Albert Edward at St. Georges Chapel, Windsor Castle. The chief sponsor was King Frederick William IV of Prussia. The extravagance of the christening formed a massive contrast to Albert's household economies.\n\nIn May of 1842, Victoria hosted a splendid fancy dress party at Buckingham Palace. All guests were to wear fourteenth century clothing. Victoria and Albert appeared as King Edward III and Queen Philippa in dresses copied from their effigies in Westminster Abbey. Two weeks after the ball, Prince Albert thought he saw a man aim a pistol at the Queen during their drive back to Buckingham Palace from St James' Chapel. Neither the Queen nor the Prince could bear to stay at home until the man had been traced. The next afternoon, the Queen and the Prince acted as bait by driving out as usual. The plan had succeeded. In Constitution Hill, at the same spot where Oxford had made his assassination attempt two years earlier, a cabinet-maker, John Francis, fired without effect and was immediately arrested. The country was relieved that the Queen was ok and very proud at the courageous act the royal couple completed. However only a month later, the Queen had another frightening encounter. A crippled youth called Bean aimed a pistol at her. He was seized but escaped for a time. When the youth was finally arrested and the pistol was examined, they found it was loaded with paper, pieces of clay pipe and powder, but no bullets.\n\nThe Queen was not well after the birth of the Prince of Wales and didn't recover as quickly as she had after the birth of the Princess Royal. Her nerves were shaken by her two rapid pregnancies and she felt depressed and low.\n\nFirst Railway Visit[]\n\nOn 14 June 1842, the Queen and the Prince made their first ever railway journey on the new Great Western line from Slough to London. The royal coachman insisted that it was his duty to ride on the pilot engine. However, when he saw that he got smuts on his red and white wig, he later decided to take this back. The Queen expressed that she was 'quite charmed' with the experience but the Prince had said, 'not quite so fast next time, Mr Conductor, if you please'. The journey was 21 and a half miles and took twenty-five minutes to complete which is less that what trains today would take. The royal train consisted of four carriages: the first after the engine and was used for luggage, the second was the royal saloon, topped by a crown for the royal family and ladies in waiting. The last two carriages were for the equerries and other attendants as well as officials of the railway company. Railway trips were sufficient enough for people to wait and wave to their Queen as she passed.\n\nWhen the royal train passed Coventry in November 1843, the line was thronged with 10,000 spectators for two whole miles. A band played 'God Save the Queen' as the train passed through\n\nRoyal Visit to Scotland[]\n\nIn September 1842, Victoria and Albert took a trip to Scotland for the first time. The journey was made by sea due to riots in the Midlands and North of England. The royal babies were left in the care of Lady Lyttelton. At this time, the Queen was around three months pregnant with their third child. The second evening out at sea became quite choppy, which must have made the Queen feel terribly sick with her morning sickness mixed with travel sickness. The straining of the Royal George on the tow-ropes attaching her to two steamers with members of the Household on board aggravated the motion. Very earl in the morning on 1 September the royal boat docked in Inchkeith near Edinburgh for the night. Arthur's Seat provided a beautiful sight in night time: a huge bonfire on top, 40 feet in diameter and contained 25 tons of coal.\n\nThe Scottish capital planned a great welcome for the previous day, but because the royal party would arrive later than planned, the reception was called off. Because they arrived so early in the morning, Victoria couldn't be handed the keys of Edinburgh because they had driven past the city boundary long before the Lord Provost knew they were there, although the Royal Company of Archers were able to quickly assemble to escort the Queen's carriage. The Lord Provost and Councillors raced their carriages by various short cuts and managed to get in front of the procession, now on its way to Dalkeith where the royal party were to be guests of the Duke of Buccleuch.\n\nBoth the Queen and Prince were very impressed with Edinburgh and Arthur's Seat towering above it. At Dalkeith, Albert had his first go at deerstalking, which would go on to be his favourite sport. One day he managed to take nineteen roe deer and three brace of grouse. Victoria and Albert were enchanted with Scotland and vowed to come again soon. The picturesque scenery, the natural friendliness of locals and the climate all appealed to the Queen and to Prince Albert, who was reminded of his native Thuringia.\n\nUnable to face another voyage in the old sailing yacht, the Queen and Prince made their journey home on the fast steamship, Trident, which they liked so much that the Queen commissioned the building of a royal steam yacht.\n\nDeparture of Baroness Lehzen and Influence of Prince Albert[]\n\nIn the autumn, Baroness Lehzen decided to return to Germany for good. This relieved Prince Albert, in whose eyes saw her as a 'house dragon spitting fire' and even the Queen saw the necessity for it. The Queen did, however, want to make her old friend to not feel forgotten about so wrote to her regularly once a week and soon monthly until Lehzen's death.\n\nAs the royal couple entered more married years together, the Queen was taking on more and more of Prince Albert's principles and appreciate them more. This caused her to see the years between her accession and marriage as 'a life of constant amusement, flattery and excitement'. Court life had also changed under the influence of Prince Albert. His admonition to be more strict in her appointments to the Household prevailed. He believed that some of Lord Melbourne's appointments had caused the harm to Court.\n\nIn the spring of 1843 as the birth of their third child drew near, Prince Albert had held levees in place of the Queen's Drawing-rooms. After three years of marriage, the Queen had come to realise the desirability of that unity of purpose towards which Prince Albert had been striving all the time. However, this wasn't well received by the Press and public.\n\nBirth of Princess Alice[]\n\nOn 25 April 1843, the Queen gave birth to her third child and second daughter, Princess Alice. The birth was without complications and the Queen was shortly able to resume her usual duties, compared to her two previous births. She wrote, 'Thank God I am stronger and better this time than either tome before, my nerves are so well which I am most thankful for... My adored Angel has, as usual, been all kindness and goodness, and dear Pussy a very delightful companion. She is very tender with her little sister, who is a pretty and large baby and we think will be the beauty of the family.' The Princess was christened on 2 June 1843 as Princess Alice Maud Mary in the private chapel at Buckingham Palace by the Archbishop of Canterbury. Her godparents were the King of Hanover, who had arrived late, the Princess of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, the Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Princess Sophia Matilda of Gloucester, who was her cousin.\n\nAlice's birth meant that the family needed a more sustainable home for a family of five and Buckingham Palace didn't have the private rooms that satisfied the Queen. Therefore, in 1844 Victoria and Albert bought Osborne House on the Isle of White as a family holiday home.\n\nKing of Hanover's Fight with Prince Albert[]\n\nThe royal wedding of Princess Augusta of Cambridge, who was the sister of Prince George of Cambridge on 28 June 1843 turned into a farcical scramble by the King of Havover's determination to take precedence of Prince Albert. He would refer to him as 'a paper Royal-Highness'. The King stood up to Prince Albert to make a front but Albert pushed him sharply down some steps of the chapel, which made the King leave the wedding. At the signing of the register, the King returned and manoeuvred himself to sign after Queen Victoria. The Queen saw this and quickly snatched the register and went round to the other side of the table and passed it to her husband to sign.\n\nAlso present at the wedding was the Queen's favourite uncle, Leopold but the Queen was anxious over giving him precedence over King Ernest of Hanover and consulted the Duke of Wellington, to which he advised her to use the same system as the Congress of Vienna, which was ordered by the alphabet so Leopold (from Belgium) came before Ernest (from Hanover).\n\nFirst Trip Abroad - France and Cruise[]\n\nOn 2 September 1943, the Queen and Prince Albert arrived at Treport near Cherbourg as the Queen was so fond of King Leopold's wife that she planned to visit Queen Louise's father, King Louis-Phillipe. When they arrived, the Queen put on a purple satin dress and a bonnet trimmed with yellow feathers. They stepped out and received a warm welcome from the King of France and the Prime Minister. This was the first time Victoria had been abroad and the first time that an English sovereign had stepped foot on French soil since the Field of the Cloth of Gold, 323 years earlier. The entertainment wasn't quite as grand as the meeting of Francis I of France and Henry VIII of England. The King ordered large quantities of English cheese and bottled beer to make his English guests feel more welcome, which succeeded.\n\nThe Queen got on very well with Louis Philippe, Queen Marie-Amelie and the whole large Orleans family, who were much like herself in many ways. She wrote, 'They are all so kind and delightful, so united, that it does one's heart good to see this family... I feel so gay and happy with these dear people.' Victoria enjoyed the banquets, military reviews, a concert conducted by Auber and, most of all, two fête champêtres.\n\nBoth monarchs enjoyed their meetings. King Louis-Philippe, who had been slighted by the Courts of Europe all the thirteen years of his reign, felt flattered. Queen Victoria, overcome by the King's friendliness and hospitality, was also in good spirits. Soon the five days would be over and it would be time to go leave. On their return, Victoria and Albert stopped at the Royal Pavilion in Brighton for a few days and then set sail for Ostend, where they met the King and Queen of Belgium on 13 September 1843. During the next few days they visited Bruges, Ghent, Brussels and Antwerp, which no English monarch had entered since Edward III in 1338. The Queen wrote that after the two trips it was no wonder that 'Windsor and its daily occurrences were very dull.\n\nStrengthening of the Royal Marriage[]\n\nThe relationship between Victoria and Albert grew stronger with each child that they had and also since Baroness Lehzen had left. Albert recalled that 'Victoria has greatly improved, and has become very reasonable and good-natured'. Victoria wrote to her Uncle Leopold saying, 'I am grateful for possessing the most perfect being as a husband in existence, or who ever did exist; and I doubt whether anybody ever did love or respect another as I do my dear Angel!'\n\nThe following year, in 1844, the Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (the father of Prince Albert) died suddenly and in March of that year, Albert went to Coburg to help his brother put the affairs of the Duchy in order. To let Albert go alone, the Queen felt, was a terrible sacrifice. The Queen missed him terribly and wrote, 'I have never been separated from him even for one night and the thought of such a separation is quite dreadful.' Albert was in Germany from 28 March to 11 April and to make her feel less alone, the King and Queen of Belgium came to visit her. She would describe them as people whom 'next to her husband she loved best in the world.'\n\nVisit from the Emperor of Russia[]\n\nOn 1 June 1844, the Emperor of Russia, Nicholas I, arrived in London for an unexpected visit. The Queen was taken by surprise as well as seven months pregnant with her fourth child but she still greeted him. He went with the Court to Windsor, was given two meals in the Waterloo Chamber, accompanied the Queen to a large review in Windsor Great Park and expressed himself 'quite enchanted' by Windsor Castle. He also accompanied the Queen to Ascot races and made himself popular by establishing a race with an annual prize of £500. He stayed at Buckingham Palace and a grand concert was given in his honour. He also went with the Queen to the opera where they were most brilliantly received. Prince Albert also took him to breakfast at the Duke of Devonshire's villa at Chiswick, though for the Queen in the end of her pregnancy it was best for her to stay at home. The whole visit was a major success.\n\nThe Emperor's objective was to discover what prospect existed of detaching England from her alliance with France. He was also convinced that Turkey was in a moribund state and must soon fall to pieces. Public opinion in France was incensed by the Emperor's visit to London, and unfavourable comments in the French Press were already irritating the British nation when trouble arose. The French weren't easy allies to work with. The distant island of Tahiti was seized by the French from its ruler Queen Pomare, an old ally of the British, in 1842.\n\nBirth of Prince Alfred[]\n\nOn 6 August 1844, during the negotiations with France, the Queen gave birth to her fourth child and second son, Prince Alfred. The Queen had hoped for a son and the arrival of a prince was greeted with delight. The Prince was second in line for the throne behind his brother, Albert, Prince of Wales. Victoria now had two sons and two daughters and her satisfaction was great."
