        "text": "Minor Nobles: Katharina von Bora aka Katharina Luther\n\nNot much is known about Katharina’s birth. Her birthdate is not even documented but it is commonly agreed to be January 29th, 1499. It is also quite uncertain who her parents are. Commonly named are the only twice recorded Johan von Bora and his wife Margarete. But in a document that is stored in the Saxonian State Archive in Leipzig, she was born Hirschfeld near Nossen to Hans von Bora and his wife Anna von Haugwitz.\n\nHowever, what is sure that Katharina was born into lower untitled nobility and she was handed into the care of the cloister of St. Clemens in Brehna when she was 5 years old. Somewhere between the age of 5 to 10/11, she moved to the Cistercian cloister in Marienthron. There, Katharina received a basic education in reading, writing, singing as well as some Latin.\n\nKatharina read De votis monasticis by her future husband while being a nun. The work was supposed to be guideline and help for nuns and monks who considered leaving their cloisters. Together with 8 other nuns and the help of the council man Leonhard Spitz, she secretly left her cloister on Easter 1523. For different reasons, the women could not return to their families and therefor went to Wittenberg where Luther and his followers lived. Luther helped finding honorable husbands for the former nuns. He himself actually had considered one of the nuns, Ave von Schönfeld, but in the end did not feel ready to marry.\n\nWhen Katharina lived with Lucas and Barbara Cranach, who would be close friends from there on, she received a golden ring from King Christian II. of Denmark when he stayed at their house in 1523. After Katharina could not marry Hieronymus Baumgartner because his parents refused a run-away nun as bride and she refused Kaspar Glatz, it became increasingly hard to find a husband for her. Ave von Schönfeld was done waiting for Luther and decided to marry Basilius Axt. After that Katharina and Martin decided to marry one another.\n\nKatharina would go on to manage the houshold and estate while Martin wrote his famous works. He only intervened when their were juristical issues to which he had to agree which he usually did. He also gave his wife the nickname of “Mein Herr Käthe” (My Lord/Master Käthe). Katharina was determined and very good at managing the estate and finances which allowed to live them in good comfort. But she also engaged in conversations. Their marriage spawned 6 children of which two daughters died in childhood. Martin wrote in his last will that Katharina was his sole heir but his will would not be fulfilled immediately after his death since it was against Saxonian law that forbade women from inheriting anything. Only when John Frederick I, The Elector of Saxony, himself intervened, she was able to inherit her husbands fortune. Duke Albrecht of Prussia and King Christian III. of Denmark supported her financially as well.\n\nStill the following years after Luther’s death were troublesome and Katharina constantly on the run from war and the plague. When in 1552, she once again had to flee, she broke her hips because her carriage broke down shortly before the destination Torgau. She died three weeks later on December 20th, 1552. Katharina had been nearly forgotten in the last centuries, but especially since the recent Luther jubilee she has received attention again. Since 2011, the city of Torgau hands out an award named after her in honor of extraordinary female commitment/involvement.\n\n// Karoline Schuch as Katharina von Bora in Katharina Luther aka Luther and I (2017)\n\nHouse of Wittelsbach & of Habsburg: Princess Sophie of Bavaria\n\nPrincess Sophie of Bavaria was born as the fifth child and third daughter to King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and his second wife Caroline of Baden. Her twin is Queen Maria Anna of Saxony. Among her other full siblings are the twins Queen Elisabeth Ludovika of Prussia and Queen Amalie Auguste of Saxony as well as Duchess Ludovika in Bavaria. By her father’s first marriage, she is also a half-sister to King Ludwig I of Bavaria, Duchess Augusta of Leuchtenberg, Empress Caroline Augusta of Austria and Prince Karl Theodor of Bavaria.\n\nUnlike the customs of the time, Sophie’s parents were very close to their children. She is even said to have been her father’s favourite daughter although she was much closer with her mother than with him. Sophie adored her own twin and remained close to all over sisters throughout her life. This resulted also in some marriages between the children of the sisters. Ludovika and Sophie had originally intended Helene in Bavaria to marry Franz Joseph but he chose her younger sister Elisabeth aka Sisi. Another first cousin marriage happened between Sophie’s son Karl Ludwig and Amalie Auguste’s daughter Princess Margarete of Saxony.\n\nOn November 4th, 1824, Sophie married Archduke Franz Karl of Austria, second in line to the throne. Sophie and Franz Karl had six children, five sons and one daughter. Four of their sons survived into adulthood and two of them became emperors, Franz Joseph of Austria and Maximilian of Mexico. Their only daughter Maria Anna Karolina died of epilepsy at only 4 years old.\n\nDuring the Revolution of 1848, Sophie convined her husband to give up his claim to the Austrian throne in favor of their oldest son Franz Joseph who was seen as a new chance for the monarchy. During the same time her amibitions brought her the title of “the only man at court”. When her 18-year-old son succeeded to the throne, Sophie became the driving force behind it.\n\nSophie was a good friend of Napoleon II who resided in Austria The Duke of Reichstadt. Some suspected them to have an affair and Archduke Maximilian being the result of it but this is most likely only gossip. However, his death as well as Maximilian’s death later affected Sophie greatly.\n\nSophie died on May 28th, 1872, at the age of 67. Today she is mostly known as the maternal aunt and mother-in-law to Empress Elisabeth of Austria.\n\n// Martina Gedeck as Archduchess Sophie in Sisi (2009)\n\nHouse of Habsburg: Anna Plochl\n\nAnna was born as the oldest of thirteen children to postmaster Jakob Plochl and his wife Maria Anna Pilz. In English sources, he lastname is often given as Plöchl but all German sources I found, including the official Habsburg homepage, refer to her as Plochl.\n\nAfter the death of her mother, Anna took over the household duties. On August 22nd, 1819, Anna, only fifteen at the time, met Archduke Johann of Austria, already 37 at the time, for the first time. Somewhen during the next four years a relationship between them must have blossomed because Johann sought his brother Emperor Franz I.’s permission in 1823 for the first time. He denied to sanction the marriage to a commoner.\n\nDespite The Emperor’s decision, Anna moved to Vordernberg where Johann owned a pre-modern blast furnace. He was constantly on the road in Styria as well as traveling to court in Vienna. Anna in the mean time became the caretaker of Brandhof Castle from April 25th, 1824, onwards. She was known for her traditional Styrian recipes and they are still considered a specialty until this day.\n\nOn February 18th, 1829, the now 47-year-old Johann married the 25-year-old Anna morganatically after The Emperor had finally given them permission. But Johann was not allowed to make his marriage public until four years later. In 1834, Anna received the title of Baroness of Brandhofen, named after her father’s estate.\n\nAfter ten years of marriage, the couple welcomed their first and only child Franz. When he was 5 or 6, Johann was successful in persuading The Prince of Metternich to campaign for the title of Count of Meran for his son. Anna received the same title five years later too and was from 1850 known as Countess of Meran.\n\nJohann died May 11th, 1859, which left Anna a widow at 45. She continued his charity work in Styria and would survive him for 26 years. Anna died in the same place she was born: Aussee. She is buried next to her husband in a mausoleum in Schenna near Meran.\n\n// Anna Maria Mühe in Anna and the Prince (2009)\n\nHouse of Wied-Neuwied & of Hohenzollern: Princess Elisabeth of Wied\n\nElisabeth was born as the oldest child to Prince Hermann of Wied and his wife Princess Marie of Nassau-Weilburg. She was a niece of Grand Duke Adolphe of Luxemburg, Queen Sophia of Sweden, Princess Helene of Waldeck and Pyrmont as well as Countess Luitgarde of Solms-Laubach. Elisabeth was also the aunt of Prince of\n\nElisabeth was educated by Georg Sauerwein and Clara Schumann. She showed an interest in literature and music from an early age. If it had been up to her, she would have loved to become a teacher. At the age of 25, she spent time a Berlin court where she met Prince Karl Eitel of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, who became Prince of Romania in 1866 and King in 1881. Elisabeth had been considered to become the wife of The Prince of Wales at one point. Queen Victoria had actually desired the match and asked her daughter Empress Victoria to inspect Elisabeth. Victoria wrote back that she did not see Elisabeth fit to be queen nor to be to her brother’s liking while suggesting Alexandra of Denmark instead.\n\nElisabeth married Karl on November 15th, 1869, which made her Princess of Romania. The couple only had a daughter together, Maria. Unfortunately she died at the young age of only three. Her mother never really recovered from her loss. Due to the lack of heirs, her husband adopted his nephew Prince Ferdinand of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen in 1881.\n\nFerdinand soon had an affair with Elena Văcărescu. Elisabeth encouraged it despite knowing that Elena could never be more than a mistress to Ferdinand. When the affair was discovered, the two women were sent into exile and Ferdinand on a trip through Europe find a bride who he found in Princess Marie of Edinburgh, the daughter of The Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nThroughout her life Elisabeth authored several books under the pen name Carmen Sylva. She also translated Romanian books into German and promoted the country and its culture by doing so. Elisabeth was friends with Empress Elisabeth of Austria-Hungary with whom she had much in common. For example, Elisabeth too was a liberal minded person who actually preferred a republic over a kingdom.\n\nIn her time as Romanian consort, she did a lot of charity work. For example, the Romanian National Society for the Blind was founded by her and she was the first royal patron of the Romanian Red Cross. During the Romanian War of Independence, she devoted herself to the care of the wounded and rewarded those who did likewise with her newly founded Cross of Queen Elisabeth.\n\nElisabeth died on March 2nd, 1916, in Bukarest. She rests in Curtea de Argeș. In her home of Neuwied, a school and a park are named after her.\n\n// Sunnyi Melles in Sisi - Die Getriebene (2019)\n\nHouse of Mecklenburg & of Welf: Elisabeth of Mecklenburg-Schwerin aka Grand Duchess Anna Leopoldovna of Russia\n\nElisabeth was born as the only child of Duke Karl Leopold of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and his third wife Tsarevna Catherine Ivanovna of Russia. Catherine took her daughter with her to Russia when she returned there in 1722 after her marriage began to fall apart and she had given birth to stillborn child. Elisabeth’s uncle was Peter the Great to whom she was like a daughter and he took care of her needs until his death in 1725.\n\nWhen Peter II died in 1730, the throne was offered to Catherine’s sister Anna. Anna, like Peter, was childless and Elisabeth’s position at court as the only child of Anna’s older sister became much more important. But Elisabeth was still a Lutheran at the time. She converted to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1733 and took the name of Anna Leopoldovna, honoring her aunt and father. Now Elisabeth was a suitable possible heiress to Empress Anna.\n\nAt the age of 20, Elisabeth married Prince Anton (Anthony) Ulrich of Brunswick-Lüneburg. He was the second son of Duke Ferdinand Albert II of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and his wife Antoinette. Among Elisabeth’s new sisters-in-law were the Danish and Norwegian queen Juliane and the Prussian queen Elisabeth Christine. A year later, Elisabeth gave birth to her first child who would become Ivan VI of Russia. He was adopted by Empress Anna and declared her heir at less than two months old. Three weeks later, Empress Anna died. She had instructed her favourite The Duke of Courland to take regency but he was unpopular in Russia. So with the help of Count Burkhard Christoph of Münnich Elisabeth was easily able to overthrow him and take regency for her son for herself.\n\nElisabeth assumed the title of Grand Duchess as regent of Russia. Unfortunately, the only 22-year-old was not up for the task ahead of her. Instead of dealing with political matters, she preferred to spend her time in bed and to read novels. She was involved in affairs with Count Moritz zu Lynar and, according to Troyad and Moss, also with her lady-in-waiting Julia von Mengden. It also did not help her popularity that she gave many positions of government to Baltic Germans instead of ethnic Russian. So it is not very surprising that very soon another coup was on the horizon. This time led by Elizabeth Petrovna, the daughter of Elisabeth’s uncle Peter the Great.\n\nElizabeth’s coup was supported by France and Sweden and executed on the night of December 5th to December 6th, 1741. Grand Duchess Anna, her husband, their son Ivan and his less than six months old sister Catherine Antonovna were taken to Riga and then Kholmogory were they were imprisoned. During her captivity, Anna gave birth to three more children: Elizabeth, Peter and Alexei. Unfortunately, she caught puerperal fever after the birth of Alexei and died on March 19th, 1746, at only 27 years old.\n\nHer son Ivan was executed on July 16th, 1764, when supporters of his tried to free him. His siblings were released 16 years later to the custody of their paternal aunt Queen Juliane of Denmark and Norway. They lived under house arrest at Horsens for the rest of their lives while Empress Elizabeth’s adoptive daughter-in-law Catherine the Great paid for their expenses.\n\n// Marina Aleksandrova in Ekaterina (2014-)\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nRequested by anonymous\n\nMinor Nobles: Sophie Botta aka The Dark Countess of Hildburghausen\n\nOn February 1807, a veiled woman and a man arrived in Hildburghausen, Saxony. They would live there for the next three years until they moved to Eishausen Castle, outside of town.\n\nNot much is known about this mysterious woman who the locals called Dunkelgräfin [Dark Countess]. She never ventured outside without a veil or hidden inside a carriage where no one would see her face. The man who had arrived was later indentified as the Dutch secretary Leonardus Cornelius van der Valck. He had worked at the Dutch embassy in Paris from July 1798 to April 1799. In the time of their presence in Hildburghausen, he called himself Count Vavel de Versay and states that they were neither married nor lovers.\n\nAfter the Countess’ death in 1837, he said her name was Sophia Botta, a single woman from Westphalia. However, no such name could be found in birth registers of the area. So her identity still remains a secret until this day.\n\nFor a long time, it had been speculated that she was actually Marie Thérèse of France, the daughter of Marie Antoinette and granddaughter of Empress Maria Theresia. The girl pretending to be Marie was, according to this theory, actually her adopted sister Ernestine Lambriquet. However this theory has been disproven since 2013. DNA analysis of the exhumed body and a study of her reconstructed facial features clearly confirmed that the Dark Duchess was not the French Princess.\n\nThis mysterious story has been the basis of many stories and essays ever since. Works include for example a trilogy of theater plays. Even a German metal band was inspired to name themselves after the Dunkelgrafen couple.\n\n// Felicitas Breest as Dunkelgräfin in Geschichte Mitteldeutschlands - Episode 47 “Die vertauschte Prinzessin - Die Dunkelgräfin von Hildburghausen” (2007)\n\nHouse of La Marck & of Wettin: Sibylle of Jülich-Cleves-Berg aka Sibylle of Cleves\n\nSibylle was born as the oldest of four children to John III the Peaceful, The Duke of Cleves and The Count of Mark, and his wife Maria, The Duchess of Jülich-Berg. Her siblings are Anne of Cleves, the famous fourth wife of King Henry VIII, her unmarried sister Amalia and her brother Wilhelm the Rich, The Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg.\n\nAt the age of fourteen, Sibylle was betrothed to then Electoral Prince Johann Friedrich of Saxony. They married shortly after her fifteenth birthday on February 9th, 1527, in Torgau. After the death of Johann Friedrich’s father in 1532, they succeeded as Elector and Electress of Saxony.\n\nTheir marriage appeared to have been a happy one according to letters they exchanged during his imprisonment. Johann Friedrich had been captured after the Battle of Mühlberg during the Schmalkaldic War. The Emperor had actually given him a death sentence but had not executed so he would not lose time in the siege of Wittenberg. Wittenberg was protected by Sibylle in her husband’s absence. To protect his wife and sons, Johann Friedrich negotiated the Capitulation of Wittenberg and abdicated as Elector in favour of Maurice of Saxony. His death sentence was in return changed to a life imprisonment.\n\nAfter five years, Johann Friedrich was released on September 1st, 1552, after thanks to the Peace of Passau. However the reunion was not a long one. Sibylle and her husband died only two years later within a month of each other.\n\nThroughout her life, Sibylle had been a strong supporter of the Protestant Reformation. The Thuringian reformer Justus Menius actually dedicated to her the mirrors for princes writing Oeconomia Christiana which was first published in 1529.\n\n// Isolda Dychauk in Borgia (2011-2014)"
