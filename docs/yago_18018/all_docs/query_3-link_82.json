        "text": "If you guessed Anderson Cooper then yes, you would be right! However, heâ€™s a CNN journalist â€“ he gets around most places :-). There is a chance some lesser known Vanderbilt descendants may be there also.\n\nWith all the festivities, I of course had to post about Vanderiblt connections to the event. Those interested in the Vanderbilt family may remember that the Commodoreâ€™s great-granddaughter Consuelo Vanderbilt (1877-1964) married into the British royal family. It was apparently not a marriage Consuelo desired, but her and husband Charles Spencer-Churchill, 9th Duke of Marlborough were married for almost 30 years and had two children together. I donâ€™t have Conseuloâ€™s descendancy tree completely filled in, however, her kids are relatives of Prince William.\n\nConsueloâ€™s children, John Albert Edward William Spencer-Churchill and Ivor Charles Spencer-Churchill share a common ancestor with Princess Diana; his name was James Hamilton, Duke of Abercorn. The Duke of Abercorn was their great-grandfather and is Prince Williamâ€™s 4th great-grandfather. I wonder if any of Consueloâ€™s descendants are attending the wedding of their cousin ðŸ™‚ Some of them, such as Lady Henrietta Mary Spencer-Churchill (a granddaughter of Consueloâ€™s), live right there in London.\n\nCreate your family tree on Geni for free, and connect to the World Family Tree to find out if you are related to the Royal Family.\n\nDisclaimer: I currently have a 12-month PRO Geni.com membership provided to me by the company."
