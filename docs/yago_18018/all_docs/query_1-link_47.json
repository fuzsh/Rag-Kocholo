        "text": "When the 1848 revolutions swept Germany many Liberals sought to unify Germany under a liberal constitution. However, King Friedrich-Wilhelm IV of Prussia was not sympathetic toward the revolutionaries. The king initially moved to repress it with the army, but on March 19 the king had a change of heart and recalled the troops and place himself at the head of the revolutionary movement.\n\nThe king committed himself fully to the ideal of German unification. The king formed a liberal government, convened a national assembly, and ordered that a constitution be written. It would seem the conservative Prussian king had become a liberal. Or had he? These actions did calm the tensions in the State and once his position was more secure again, however, he quickly had the army reoccupy Berlin and in December dissolved the Liberal assembly.\n\nAlthough the king’s change from conservatism to liberalism was a ruse to keep order, He did, however, remain dedicated to unification for a limited period of time. In reality his support for German Unification was paper-thin. When the moment came to unify Germany as a Liberal state, the king blinked. On April 3rd, 1849, the Frankfurt Parliament offered Freidrich-Wilhelm IV the Imperial Crown of Germany. The King flatly refused saying that he would not accept “a crown from the gutter”.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the king did not want to unify Germany under his Hohenzollern dynasty. The King had romantic aspiration were to re-establish the medieval Holy Roman Empire, comprising smaller, semi-sovereign monarchies under the limited authority of a Habsburg emperor. Therefore Friedrich-Wilhelm IV would only accept the imperial crown if he had been elected by the German princes, as per the former empire’s ancient customs. He would not accept the crown from German politicians whom the king did not believe had the authority to create an emperor. He expressed this sentiment in a letter to his sister the Empress Alexandra Feodorovna of Russia (wife of Emperor Nicholas I of Russia), in which he said the Frankfurt Parliament had overlooked that “in order to give, you would first of all have to be in possession of something that can be given.” In his eyes, only a reconstituted College of Electors (consisting of princes of the Empire) could possess such authority.\n\nAfter the failure of the Frankfurt Parliament even King Freiedrich-Wilhelm IV began considering a Prussian-led union where all German states, excluding those ruled by the Habsburgs, would be unified under Hohenzollern authority. However, Friedrich-Wilhelm IV abandoned the idea of German Unity after the Punctuation of Olmütz on November 29, 1850, in the face of renewed Austrian and Russian resistance to the notion of a Hohenzollern controlled German Empire. The German Confederation remained the common government of German Europe.\n\nOne of the benefits of these failures was that Friedrich-Wilhelm IV promulgated a new constitution that created a Parliament of Prussia with two chambers, an aristocratic upper house and an elected lower house. The lower house was elected by all taxpayers, but in a three-tiered system based on the amount of taxes paid, so that true liberal principle of universal suffrage was denied. The constitution also reserved to the king the power of appointing all ministers, reestablished the conservative district assemblies and provincial diets, and guaranteed that the civil service and the military remained firmly in the hands of the king. This was a more liberal system than had existed in Prussia before 1848, but it was still a conservative system of government in which the monarch, the aristocracy, and the military retained most of the power. This constitution remained in effect until the dissolution of the Prussian kingdom in 1918.\n\nAfter 1850, the increasingly depressed king withdrew from the public eye and began surrounding himself with advisers who preached absolute orthodoxy and conservatism in religious and political matters. In 1857 a stroke left the king partially paralyzed and largely mentally incapacitated, and his brother (and heir-presumptive) Prince Wilhelm served as regent from 1858 until the king’s death in 1861, at which point the regent acceded to the throne himself as Wilhelm I of Prussia.\n\nNext week. German unification under Wilhelm I and Chancellor Bismark.\n\nAfter the fall of the Holy Roman Empire the question of German unity became inevitable. But how to unify such a patchwork quilt of nation states? Prior to the end of the empire some states within its boundaries were elevated in rank. Bavaria, Saxony, and Württemberg became Kingdoms under the influence of Napoleon. Baden became a Grand Duchy and after the Napoleonic wars, Hanover also became a kingdom. The real question was would it be Prussia or Austria to gain the upper hand and unit Germany under their authority?\n\nFrom 1806 until 1813 the German States formed the Confederation of the Rhine without the inclusion of Austria and Prussia. The Confederation was to be run by common constitutional bodies, but the individual states wanted unlimited sovereignty. This loose confederation suffered some of the same problems the old Holy Roman Empire suffered from and that is there was not a strong central government.\n\nThe Holy Roman Emperor had at its head an Emperor. The Confederation, since it was not considered an empire was ruled by Karl Theodor von Dalberg, the former Arch Chancellor of the Holy Roman Empire and he carried the of a Prince-Primate of the confederation. This made him President of the College of Kings and presided over the Diet of the Confederation, designed to be a parliament-like body though it never actually assembled. The President of the Council of the Princes was held the Prince oef Nassau-e. At its heart the Confederation was a conservative minded military alliance. As mentioned, this body was under the influence of Napoleon who elevated many of the states to Kingdom status. During its short existence the members of the confederation found themselves more subordinated to Napoleon than they had been to the Habsburgs.\n\nThe Confederation of the Rhine collapsed in 1813, with the aftermath of Napoleon’s failed campaign against the Russian Empire. Many of its members changed sides after the Battle of Leipzig, when it became apparent Napoleon would lose the War of the Sixth Coalition. In 1814 the major European powers gathered in Vienna for the Congress of Vienna which redrew the map of Europe after the defeat of Napoleon. German unity did not come at this juncture but instead we saw the creation of the German Confederation with both Austria and Prussia included. The Habsburg Emperor of Austria was its nominal head, holding the title of President of the Confederation.\n\nThis Confederation, which was basically the old Holy Roman Empire in all but name, lasted until 1866 when Prussia began to consolidate its power among the German states and began the path of unification without Austria. Prior to that, in 1848, there was an attempt to create a more liberal unified German Empire. That is what we will look at in depth next week.\n\nNow we begin to examine the fall of three of the more conservative monarchies. My examinations of England and Denmark were quite lengthy, lets see if I can keep these a little more brief. Today I’ll start with Prussia.\n\nInitially Prussia was a fief of the Kingdom of Poland. In 1525 during the Protestant Reformation, Prince Albert of Brandenburg, a scion of the House of Hohenzollern and the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, secularized the order’s Prussian held territory, becoming Albert, Duke of Prussia. The new Duchy, which had its capital in Königsberg was established as fief of the Crown of Poland. In time it was inherited by the Hohenzollern prince-electors of Brandenburg of the main Branch of the House of Hohenzollern. Because of this personal union with the Electorate of Brandenburg the Duchy is often referred to as Brandenburg-Prussia. In 1657 the Treaty of Wehlau, and then in 1660 the Treaty of Oliva granted Friedrich-Wilhelm, the “Great Elector” of Brandenburg, full sovereignty over the territory. In 1701 The Duchy of Prussia was elevated to the Kingdom of Prussia, with Elector Friedrich III assuming the style of King Friedrich I in Prussia.\n\nHoly Roman Emperor Leopold I granted Elector Friedrich III the style “King in Prussia” to acknowledge the legality that the Hohenzollerns were kings only in their former duchy and not their Brandenburg lands that were still part of the Empire. In legal terms this meant that within the Empire the Hohenzollerns were only Electors and were under the over-lordship of the Emperor. In truth this was merely a dog and pony show because at this juncture in history the emperor’s authority was only nominal. Each ruler of the various territories within the Empire acted largely as if they were the rulers of independent sovereign states, and only acknowledged the emperor’s suzerainity in a formal way. The only thing granting the Emperor some respect and power was due to the fact that the Hapsburg Emperor was also the Archduke of Austria, a state with considerable power within the Empire.\n\nThe personal union between Brandenburg and Prussia legally continued until the Empire was dissolved in 1806 under the pressure of Napoleon. Despite the legalities, from 1701 onward Brandenburg was treated as an integral part of the Kingdom of Prussia. During this time periods the Hohenzollern kings of Prussia were nominally subjects of the emperor within the parts of their territories that were part of the empire, they continued to style themselves “Elector of Brandenburg” until the empire ceased. It was not until 1772 under King Friedrich II “The Great” of Prussia (1740-1786) that the title was changed to “King of Prussia”.\n\nWith Prussia established as a Kingdom, next week I will look at King Friedrich II “The Great” of Prussia and the rise of Militarism, a large aspect of this conservative monarchy.\n\nI wanted to revive an old feature, where I would focus on one monarch or prince/princess. The problem with that in the past was that it was difficult for me to keep it brief. I ended up writing way too much for a blog post. So, I will revive this feature and see if I can keep it brief!!\n\nHRH Prince Ernst-August II of Hanover, Duke of Cumberland. He was born in 21 September 1845 the eldest son of King Georg V of Hanover and Marie of Saxe-Altenburg. He was the grandson of Queen Victoria’s uncle, King Ernst-August I of Hanover. Prince Ernst-August’s father, Georg V of Hanover, lost the throne when it was annexed to Prussia in the 1866 war against Austria. As a descendant of King George III of Great Britain, Elector of Hanover, Prince Enrst-August II was heir to the vacant throne of Hanover and the Duchy of Brunswick as well as a British Prince and as Duke of Cumberland he was a British Peer.\n\nBecause of Hanover’s annexation to Prussia Ernst-August had long deep-seated prejudice and hatred toward all things Prussian and the House of Hohenzollern. For that reason he took Princess Thyra of Denmark as his wife. Thyra was the youngest daughter of Christian IX of Denmark and Louise of Hesse-Kassel. The Danish Royal Family lost a war against Prussia in 1864 so they all shared a common hatred of Prussia. This marriage also made him the brother-in-law to King Frederik VIII of Denmark, King Edward VII of Great Britain, Emperor Alexander III of Russia and King George I of Greece.\n\nQueen Victoria appointed the Duke of Cumberland a colonel in the British Army in 1876 and promoted him to major-general in 1886, lieutenant-general in 1892 and general in 1898. After his time in the British Army he lived in Gmunden, Upper Austria. Although he never renounced the succession to the thrones of Hanover and Brunswick Ernst-August II was eventually reconciled to Prussia when his eldest surviving son, Ernst-August III, married Princess Victoria-Luise of Prussia, the only daughter of German Emperor Wilhelm II in 1913. That same year his son was created the reigning Duke of Brunswick by Wilhelm II.\n\nAs a British and German Prince, Ernst-August II lost his British peerage in 1917 when all German relatives of the British Royal Family lost their British titles during World War I when King George V issued the Titles Deprivation Act. Prince Ernst August, the former Crown Prince of Hanover and former Duke of Cumberland, died of a stroke on his estate at Gmunden in November 1923. He was 78 years old.\n\nOften when I think of monarchy I envision a family, royal family, or, if you will, a national family. In the context of a national family which represents the nation it leaves out a part of their story and who they are. Throughout history royal families have been large extended families that often transcend national boarders. We can see this played out during the Victorian era when the numerous descendants of Victoria and Prince Albert were scattered about Europe. With centuries of inter-marriage the royal families of Europe, were in truth a grand family with many branches. Although we mere commoners may not have the degrees of consanguinity that the royals have, we too often belong to large extended families that may be scattered about all over the globe. We also, through our ethnic heritage may share kinship with more people than we are aware of. A problem that occurs when large extended families are separated by geography and culture and nationality it can place family members in conflicting positions both socially and politically.\n\nOne of the examples of that was during the 1866 War between Prussia and Austria. This war was part of the plan in uniting Germany under Prussian leadership that Prussian Chancellor Otto von Bismark had constructed. The origins of the war are complex and worthy of a series of blog posts of its own, so I will only give you a brief synopsis. In 1864 there was a great controversy over the ownership of the thrones of the united Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. When the succession to that throne was contested between Denmark and Prussia war ensued with Denmark being easily trounced by Prussia. At this time both the Hohenzollerns of Prussia and the Habsburgs of Austria were wrestling for supremacy over the German nation and to see who would become the central power within Germany. Bismark desired a Germany with Prussia as its head and he found no room for Austria in this system. After the 1864 war with Denmark both Austria and Prussia took jurisdiction over the twin duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. The next step in German unification for Bismark was to remove Austria from German interests and to do this he goaded them into War. With Prussia at war with Austria many of the smaller, or lesser, German states in southern Germany, sided with Austria. Like the US Civil War which happened in that same decade, this conflict divided families, even royal families.\n\nThis conflict affected two sisters specifically, Crown Princess Victoria of Prussia, and Hereditary Grand Duchess Alice of Hesse and By Rhine. Prior to their marriage they were both princesses of the United Kingdom of Great Britain. Victoria, was the Princess Royal, eldest daughter of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, the Prince Consort, and Princess Alice was their second daughter. In 1858 Victoria married the future German Kaiser and King of Prussia, Friedrich III. In 1862 Alice married the future Grand Duke Ludwig IV of Hesse and By Rhine. Crown Prince Friedrich of Prussia was commander of one of the three division sof the Prussian Army and he was an essential leader in the Prussian victory at the Battle of Königgrätz on July 3, 1866. Prince Ludwig of Hesse and By Rhine found himself on the side with Austria and pitted against Prussia. He was a front line officer in a Hessian Regiment. With Prussia easily winning this war, Vicky was proud of the victories and accomplishments of her husband. However, Ludwig was feared for his life as Prussian troops marched into Darmstadt, the capital of the Hessian Grand Duchy.\n\nVicky and Alice, despite being on opposite sides of the war did have a strong relationship through the short conflict. Although Crown Prince Friedrich was a succesful leader during the conflict he was personally against the war. That did have some solace in easing family tensions. All of the parties mentioned wanted Great Britain to mediate the conflict but all efforts were squashed by Bismark. during this time Vicky had a tragedy. Days prior to her husband’s triumphant victory at the Battle of Königgrätz their son, Prince Sigismund, died of meningitis at 21 months and was the first grandchild of Queen Victoria to die. Therefore this tragedy also helped to detract Vicky from the war.\n\nAnother aspect of their relationship which helped them through the war was the fact that both being intellectual they were brought together over recent developments in both science and philosophy that made them both question their Christian faith. Liberal Biblical scholarship was in its infancy in 1866 but it had left the sisters to question some of the historical accuracy of the faith. They were also interested Darwin’s book, Origin of the Species, published in 1859. Their enlightened attitudes put them in disfavor with their mother, Queen Victoria, who could easily show favoritism or displeasure not only her children but anyone who displeased her and these new attitudes of her daughters did just that. It is interesting to see that royal families have petty squabbles just like the rest of us.\n\nToday I wanted to continue my discussion on royal marriages. As I mentioned in in the last post, by the mid to late 19th century royal marriages were conducted based on a need to marry within a specific social class rather than for political alliances. Also, with there being a relatively large amount of royal and noble families within Europe, there was a considerable pool to select from. Marriages were arranged to a certain degree at this time. Royals would browse the Almanach de Gotha, the Blue Book for Blue Bloods, looking to select a suitable match for their children or siblings. The royals themselves had some say in the matter at this juncture of time and did not have to always marry those who were suggested for them. Royals met and fell in love very similarly to how commoners such as myself meet and fall in love with our spouses. We meet them while engaging in our lives. In the 19th century, when royalty thrived, this class of people, although greatly interrelated, interacted with one another around a social calender. It was very easy to meet and fall in love with a potential spouse that met the criteria for this social class.\n\nEven with royals meeting and falling in love with one another didn’t always mean that love would be returned. Here is a prime example. In the late 1870s future German Emperor, Wilhelm II, fell in love with his cousin, Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine while attending the University of Bonn. He would meet with her and other royal cousins. He tried to win the affections this young and beautiful princess but she would not have anything to do with him. Rejected, he moved on and married Princess Augusta-Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein in 1881. A woman who was devoted to Wilhelm and although I think Wilhelm developed some level of love for his wife I do question to what degree those feelings were reciprocated. From what I have read he came to depend on her but at times he appeared to merely tolerate her. From my readings of the last German Empress she has been depicted as being rather dull and religiously zealous to the point of bigotry. Wilhelm’s brother, Prince Heinrich of Prussia, had better luck with the Hessian princesses by marrying Elizabeth’s sister, Irene in 1888.\n\nSometimes meeting a royal mate can come as a relief for royal parents. I understand that people may not always fall in love with the people our peers or family or society may approve of, and this was the same for royals. German Emperor Wilhelm II,’s son, Crown Prince Wilhelm, certainly liked the ladies but to the exasperation of his parents he would often select the objects of his affections from women of the lower classes. In 1904 Grand Duke Friedrich-Franz IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin married Princess Alexandra of Hanover and the Crown Prince was selected by his parents to deliver a wedding present to the new bride and groom. It was during this trip that Crown Prince Wilhelm met and fell in love with Princess Cecilie, sister of Grand Duke Friedrich-Franz IV, to the relief of his parents. The two were married in 1905 and despite having six children together the marriage was not a happy union. Although they never divorced, they did drift apart and Wilhelm continued on with his string of affairs.\n\nAnother sad story to me was the marriage between Princess Marie of Greece and Denmark and Grand Duke George Mikhailovich of Russia. Princess Marie was a daughter of king George I and queen Olga of Greece (Olga herself was born a Russian grand duchess). Grand Duke George was a first cousin of Emperor Alexander III of Russia and the son of Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia and Cäcilie (Cecilie) of Baden. Marie was close to her Russian cousins as was her sister, Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark. So it is of no surprise that the two sisters grew up to marry Russian royal cousins that they had known for years. Alexandra married Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia. Grand Duke George often called Marie “Greek Minny” to distinguish her from the Dowager Empress Marie of Russia, herself born a Danish princess (Dagmar of Denmark wife of Emperor Alexander III of Russia). George pursued his Greek Minny for years. She finally, and reluctantly, agreed to marry him although she admitted to George she was not in love with him. He accepted that she did not love him and he hoped that marriage would change her heart. It did not. The had two daughters, Nina and Xenia, but Marie never did develop much love for her husband and George was not happy knowing he was with a woman who could never return his. One of her daughters grew ill and Marie took their children to a different climate as a means to improve her daughter’s health and to get away from her husband. The marriage ended tragically when Grand Duke George was murdered in 1919 at the hands of the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution. Marie moved on and remarried a Greek Admiral, Pericles Ioannides, in 1922 and died in 1940 at the relatively young age of 64.\n\nIt seems very sad for both of them to be stuck in a loveless marriage. I guess loveless marriages are not just the domain of the common people. In fact it seems loveless marriages were too common in royal circles. Love doesn’t seem to come any easier to royals than it does for the rest of us. Money, property, titles and wealth is no guarantee of happiness in this life.\n\nFriday’s featured monarch is\n\nHI & RM German Emperor Wilhelm II, King of Prussia.\n\nI am going to take a different approach today with my featured monarch. I could list all of the historical facts and figures, which I am sure my readers already know, so instead I will share why I find the last German Kaiser to be such a fascinating individual to understand and study.\n\nI cannot really say I admire Wilhelm II because there were things in his character that shows a dark side to his personality and these characteristics also contributed to his downfall. However, he presided over a fascinating time of change as the 19th century transitioned into the 20th century. When the majority of European nations were moving away from authoritarian monarchies to a more democratic and parliamentary style of monarchy, Germany was a state where that shift had not taken place and the monarch still wielded considerable power.\n\nHe was born on January 27, 1859 and was christened HRH Prince Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor Albrecht von Preußen and was the son of future German Emperor and Prussian King, Friedrich III and his wife, Princess Victoria, Princess Royal, and daughter of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. The Prince Consort had dreamed of a liberal Germany under Prussian leadership but that was just not to be. The Prussian monarchy was steeped in the tradition of militarism and a conservative philosophy where the monarch held the power and constitutionalism was considered an anathema. From his earliest days there seems to have developed a battle over forming the ideologies of the future Wilhelm II. His parents wished to instill in him the liberal ideas of a constitutional form of government which protected the rights of the citizens/subjects while limiting the power of the Crown and giving more power to the Parliament.\n\nIn most families the parents will control the education of their children. But in the 19th century the education of the children of princes was controlled by the head of the royal house. In this case that was German Emperor and Prussian King, Wilhelm I, the staunch conservative grandfather of Wilhelm II. Wilhelm I along with his equally staunch conservative Chancellor, Otto von Bismark, made sure Wilhelm was raised with typical conservative Prussian values and beliefs. With Wilhelm firmly in the conservative camp he had a difficult relationship with both of his parents. He was also born with a physical handicap. During a very difficult birth his left arm was pulled from its socket and was permanently damaged. Despite surgeries and treatment he was never able to regain usage of his arm and had which withered and atrophied.\n\nThese circumstances are said to have played a great role in the development of his personality. In reading many books and biographies about he last Kaiser I wonder what his mental health diagnosis was. I wonder if he was bipolar? He seemed to have tremendous highs and lows. He was described as intelligent yet could also be volatile and had an explosive temper. After the Daily Telegraph Affair of 1908 where the Kaiser gave an interview in which he alienated Britain, France, Russia and Japan, his government forbade him from any more interviews that would be released unedited. The result of this affair lead the Kaiser into slipping into a severe depression for many weeks and there were people close to him say he never fully recovered from.\n\nIn order to keep these blog posts to a digestible level I will end it here and continue part II of my look at Wilhelm II next Friday in this section.\n\nCrown Prince Wilhelm of Germany and Prussia\n\nToday begins my Thursday segment where I focus on a prince or princess from either the present or the past. Today I will look at the life of Crown Prince Wilhelm of Germany and Prussia a person I find interesting for the times in which he lived and ultimately the unfulfilled destiny which remained beyond his grasp.\n\nHe was christened HRH Friedrich Wilhelm Victor August Ernst of Prussia and was the eldest son of future German Emperor Wilhelm II and his first wife, Princess Augusta Viktoria of Schleswig-Holstein (1858–1921). At the time of his birth he was third in line to the Imperial and Royal thrones of Germany and Prussia. His great-grandfather, German Emperor Wilhelm I, occupied the throne. His grandfather, Crown Prince Friedrich, was next in line followed by his own father, Wilhelm. Like his father, he was christened Friedrich Wilhelm but went by his second name. Wilhelm was also the great-grandson of Britain’s Queen Victoria through his grandmother, Princess Victoria, the Princess Royal, who was his father’s mother. By the time he was 6 in 1888 he went from being third in line to the throne to being the heir to the throne with the death of his great-grandfather, his grandfather and the accession of his father in the span of a few months.\n\nHe was raised in the traditional manner of a Prussian prince; schooled by tutors and on his tenth birthday in 1892 he entered the First Guard Regiment and was given the Order of the Black Eagle by his father. As he grew older Wilhelm enjoyed the life of a Prussian military officer who was devoted to military life. Another aspect of growing older and being heir to the throne Wilhelm became quite the ladies man and being involved with women would be a passion of his even to his detriment. One of his great loves was an American singer Geraldine Farrar but she was not of the stature for him to be allowed to marry her. As a future Emperor-King Wilhelm needed to follow the strict protocol of marrying a princess of equal rank to his.\n\nOn this date, July 5, 1904, 108 years ago Crown Prince Wilhelm met his future bride, Princess Cecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (1886-1954). At this time her brother, Friedrich Franz IV was the reigning Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin and had recently married Princess Alexandra of Hanover and Cumberland. Upon their return to Schwerin Crown Prince Wilhelm arrived in the capitol of the Grand Duchy to deliver the couple a wedding present on behalf of his parents. This is where he met the Grand Duke’s 17 year old sister, Princess Cecilie. He immediately fell in love with her and much to the relief of his parents he had found someone of equal rank. On June 5, 1905 the couple were married in pomp and splendor in Potsdam. Wilhelm and Cecilie had 6 children (4 sons and 2 daughter).\n\nIn 1914 Crown Prince Wilhelm’s life changed forever as the First World War broke out. Despite being in the military for the majority of his life he did not have much leadership experience but was given the command of the Vth Army. He oversaw the Verdun Offensive and was forever known by the French as the ‘Butcher of Verdun.” Crown Prince Wilhelm is on record as not being supportive of the war. When Germany lost the war the Crown Prince went into exile on the island of Wieringen, in the Netherlands and was not popular in Germany. His father, Wilhelm II, also sought asylum in the Netherlands settling on an estate in Doorn.\n\nIn 1923 after reassuring the German Government that he would not enter into politics Wilhelm was allowed to return to Germany. However, at one point he did have political aspirations and desired to run for Reichspräsident against Paul von Hindenburg in 1932. This ambition was curtailed when his father threatened to disinherit him if he chose this path. The former Kaiser was never supportive of the democratic process and the thought of a Hohenzollern prince running for an election was an anathema to him. From 1919 until 1934 a great aspirtation for the former Crown prince was a restoration of the monarchy.\n\nThe Crown Prince supported the rise of Hitler for a short time as did many German princes as Hitler used the promise of a restoration of the monarchy as a means to court their support. With the death of his friend, the former Chancellor, Kurt von Schleicher, in the Night of the Long Knives in 1934 enabled him to see Hitlers true colors. From that period on Crown Prince Wilhelm ceased his political activities and his pursuit for the Restoration of the monarchy. In the 1930s Wilhelm lived the life of a playboy enjoying fast cars and fast women, his relationship with his wife had long been over in everything but name.\n\nThe 40s saw the outbreak of World War II. In 1941 his father died at the age of 82 and for his supporters he was now the head of the Imperial Family and if the monarchy had survived he would have become Kaiser Wilhelm III. During the war he kept a low profile. His eldest son died in battle during the war. He was living in a lodge in Austria at the end of the war and even though he had not participated in it he was arrested by the French army for a brief period. He lived alone in a small five room house and fell into a depression. The world he grew up in was gone. Prussia, the sate that brought the Hohenzollerns to prominence, was formally dissolved on February 25, 1947 the Allied Control Council. From the end of the war to the end of his life Wilhelm lived as a private citizen with a small group of friends. On July 20, 1951 the chain smoking former heir to the glorious German Empire suffered a heart attack and died at the age of 69. He was succeeded by his second son, Prince Louis Ferdinand, as head of the Imperial house and claimer to the vacant thrones of Germany and Prussia.\n\nCrown Princess Cecilie.\n\nHRH Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom, The Princess Royal, German Empress & Queen of Prussia.\n\nBorn: November 21, 1840. Died: August 5, 1901.\n\nPrincess Victoria, the Princess Royal was the eldest child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. Her parents were a little disappointed that their first child was a boy, but many were relived that there was now at least one person in line for the throne ahead of the queen’s uncle, the much disliked King Ernst August of Hanover. Until the birth of her brother, Prince Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales, Victoria, called Vicky within the family, was heiress presumptive.\n\nVicky had a close relationship with her father and his liberal politics greatly influenced her. Her marriage at the age of 17 to the future King Friedrich III of Prussia was a part of her Father’s plan to see a liberal Prussia at the head of the German Empire with his daughter Vicky as empress leading the Germans from Conservatism to a liberal monarchy modeled after that of Great Britain. Although Albert, the Prince Consort, did not live long enough to see Germany become an empire under Prussian leadership he would have been disheartened to learn that it never strayed from its conservative ideals.\n\nVicky had a difficult time adjusting to Prussia and its rigid court. For her part, Vicky did carry a sense of pride in all things English which bothered many Germans at court. In 1861 she and her husband became the Crown Prince and Crown Princess of Prussia. Their desires to raiser their son, Wilhelm, in a liberal fashion brought her into conflict with her father-in-law, King Wilhelm I of Prussia, and Prussian Chancellor Bismark. They feared that liberalism would weaken the power of the monarchy and place power away from the king and chancellor and into the hands of the reichstag and that Vicky would place Britain’s interests over Germany’s.\n\nIn 1871 Germany became a federated empire with the Prussian king as emperor. The new emperor was 74 years old and Vicky and Fritz did not think they would have too many years before they in turn sat on the new imperial throne. In 1887 Crown Prince Friedrich was diagnosed with throat cancer. In March of the next year German Emperor Wilhelm I, King of Prussia died and Fritz became Emperor Friedrich III, King of Prussia. His reign was brief lasting only 99 days. With such a short time on the throne he could not impalement any liberal policies he and Vicky had envisioned. Vicky became known as the Empress Frederick in her widowhood and he relationship with her son, the new emperor, Wilhelm II, remained strained.\n\nVicky and Fritz had eight children (4 boys and 5 girls) with two of her young sons, Sigismund and Waldemar, dying at young ages affecting Vicky deeply. In her widowhood she continued to be a patron of the arts and education and established schools for the higher education of girls and for nurses’ training. She also continued to be close to her British relatives and kept a almost daily correspondence with her mother totaling over 3,500 letters.\n\nVicky’s mother died in January of 1901 and Vicky was unable to attend the bedside vigil due to the fact the she herself was also dying from bone cancer. Vicky died at the age of 60 and was buried along side her husband and their two young children at Friedenskirche in Potsdam."
