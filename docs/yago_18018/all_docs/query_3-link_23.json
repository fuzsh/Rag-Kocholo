        "text": "Royalty-watchers in the United States keep a close eye on the British monarchy: King Charles III and Queen Consort Camilla, heir to the throne Prince William and Princess Kate, their Wales children (especially amid the ongoing Kate drama), and Montecito residents Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan and their kids. We often remember the late Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Diana. And we regularly highlight peripheral British royals like Princess Eugenie and sister Princess Beatrice. But while the Brits may be the most popular and influential royals among Americans, there are actually quite a few royal families left in the world—some reigning, some not.\n\nWhile many of these aristocrats are largely unknown in the U.S., social media has increasingly brought the younger, next-generation HRHs to our attention. Some are full-on monarchs. Some are fashion It girls, models, designers, artists, accomplished athletes, or dedicated philanthropists. And some are just-plain-chic socialites and TikTokers.\n\nAhead, the 25 coolest young royals to know.\n\n1. Pauline Ducruet of Monaco\n\nPauline Ducruet is basically a modern Renaissance woman. The 29-year-old royal is the niece of Prince Albert II of Monaco, the younger child of Princess Stéphanie, and the granddaughter of actor and fashion icon Princess Grace of Monaco, a.k.a Grace Kelly. And she is a total jack-of-all-trades.\n\nIn 2001, after her mother became romantically involved with an elephant trainer, Pauline and her half sister Camille moved into a circus caravan, where Pauline quickly took to circus acts. She began performing in some of the shows, and even after her family returned to the palace, she decided to become an acrobat. But that isn’t the only physical vocation Pauline shines in—she is also a competitive diver. In 2010, she competed in the Summer Youth Olympics in Singapore, represented Monaco at the World Junior Diving Championships in Germany, participated in the European Junior Swimming and Diving Championships in Finland, and was nominated for the Sportsperson of the Year award for the 2009–10 season.\n\nNow, she serves as CEO and creative director of gender-inclusive clothing brand Alter Designs. Inspired by her mother and grandmother, Pauline developed a taste for fashion that she pursued by joining the Istituto Marangoni in Paris, studying at Parsons School of Design, and interning for Louis Vuitton. She founded Alter in 2018 and has since showcased her designs at Paris Fashion Week.\n\nShe is 16th in line to the Monegasque throne and has 83,000 followers on Instagram.\n\n2. Queen Jetsun Pema\n\nThe queen of Bhutan married into royalty at just 21 years old and today, at 33, remains the youngest queen consort in the world, as wife to King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck. Her Majesty attended Regent’s College in London, where she studied psychology, art history, and international relations; since then, she has accrued a full résumé of environmental and public health work.\n\nJetsun Pema is president of the Bhutan Red Cross Society, the United Nations Environment Program Ozone ambassador, and the royal patron of the Ability Bhutan Society, which was founded with her support. She is a World Wildlife Fund ambassador and works closely with the National Environment Commission, Royal Society for Protection of Nature, Clean Bhutan, and and other government and nongovernment agencies focused on conservation and other important environmental matters.\n\nOn Instagram, the queen has a fabulous 313,000 followers, and like a true committed mom, she posts mostly her kids: heir to the throne Gyalsey Jigme Namgyel Wangchuck, Jigme Ugyen, and Sonam Yangden.\n\n3. Lady Amelia Windsor\n\nThe chic, ultra-cool Lady Amelia is a granddaughter of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, Queen Elizabeth II’s first cousin. She is the youngest of three siblings, and the daughter of George Windsor, Earl of St. Andrews, and Sylvana Tomaselli, a Canadian academic and historian.\n\nA model who has walked in fashion shows for major brands including Dolce & Gabbana, Lady Amelia has also even done some fashion collaborations as a designer. When she’s not behind the scenes, she’s on the front row at fashion shows, or showing off her own slouchy, effortless style on Instagram, where she has 102,000 followers.\n\nThe 28-year-old is 43rd in line to the British throne.\n\n4. Prince Abdul Mateen\n\nThe 32-year-old prince of the South Asian nation of Brunei studied international studies and diplomacy at the University of London. Abdul Mateen is sixth in the line of succession to the Bruneian throne.\n\nIn January 2024, he married Anisha Rosnah binti Adam, 29, in the most spectacular 10-day ceremony, filled with plenty of luxurious fashion moments. The two have known each other since they were toddlers, as Anisha is the granddaughter of Pehin Dato Isa, special adviser to Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah and founding chairman of Royal Brunei Airlines. (Go to the last slide of this post for a sweet photo of them together when they were babies.)\n\nHe may be taken, but with 3.2 million Instagram followers, Abdul is known around the world—mostly on social media—as “the hot prince.” (It may have something to do with his sweaty workout pics.) He is also an award-winning polo player, trained helicopter pilot and major in the Royal Brunei Air Force, and known daredevil—see here for a video of him jumping out of a plane in the desert. That’s all.\n\n5. Princess Leonor of Spain\n\nSpain’s beloved young royal Princess Leonor, elder daughter of King Felipe VI and Queen Letizia—and therefore first in line to the Spanish throne—had an incredible 2023. As the heir to the throne, Leonor swore her allegiance to the Spanish Constitution before the Spanish parliament in celebration of her 18th birthday in November. The event paved the way for her eventual succession as queen, and since then, she has taken to her royal duties swimmingly.\n\nIn January 2024, she debuted at the Pascua Military ceremony, commemorating the start of a new military year. She is currently enrolled at the General Military Academy of Zaragoza, where she will complete three years of military training.\n\nLeonor has one sibling, sister Infanta Sofía of Spain, 16. Neither of them has a public Instagram account.\n\n6. Victoria de Marichalar y Borbón of Spain\n\nVictoria, 23, is the granddaughter of former King Juan Carlos, the niece of King Felipe, and an emerging fashion star.\n\nVictoria maintains a strong Instagram presence, with 269,000 followers on the platform, where she documents her world travels, modeling gigs, and attendance at fashion galas—all of which has quickly earned her “It girl” status. The royal, who is fifth in line to the Spanish throne, has also appeared on the cover of Elle Spain. Inspired by her father, Jaime de Marichalar, who has worked in the fashion industry as an advisor to LVMH founder and CEO Bernard Arnault, Victoria earned a degree in business administration and management at Madrid’s College for International Studies and hopes to follow in his footsteps.\n\nShe is also quite the equestrian, having ridden competitively.\n\n7. Arthur Chatto\n\nThe handsome Arthur Chatto, 25, is the grandson of Princess Margaret (younger sister of Queen Elizabeth II) and the son of Lady Sarah Chatto and British artist David Chatto. He has an older brother, 27-year-old Sam.\n\nArthur studied geography at the University of Edinburgh, where he became a personal trainer for BoundFitness, and later joined the Royal Marines with the intention to become an officer. He attended the late Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral in uniform.\n\nIn a testament to his athletic abilities, in 2020, Arthur and his rowing team became the youngest people to complete the GB Row Challenge, which earned them a Guinness World Record. He is also an ocean philanthropist who has pledged his support to the charity Just One Ocean, and a brand ambassador for Elliot Brown and Jöttnar.\n\nOh, and here he is as a kid with relatives Prince William and Prince Harry:\n\n8. Princess Maria-Olympia of Greece and Denmark\n\nPrincess Maria-Olympia of Greece and Denmark is a model, socialite, and member of the non-reigning Greek royal family. She is the oldest child and only daughter of Pavlos, crown prince of Greece, and his wife, Marie-Chantal Miller.\n\nThe 27-year-old is one of the most well-known royal It girls, and tends to spend time with fellow influencer royals from around the world, including Talita von Fürstenberg and Lady Amelia Windsor. The beauty and fashion model is managed by Untitled Entertainment, and has done ad campaigns for major brands, including, most recently, Louis Vuitton.\n\nFun fact: She used to date Peregrine Pearson, actor Sophie Turner’s new beau.\n\nThe ultra-cool princess has nearly 300,000 followers on Instagram and is also quite active on TikTok, where she regularly posts funny snippets from her life, beauty routines, and more.\n\n9. Prince Achileas-Andreas of Greece and Denmark\n\nPrince Achileas-Andreas is a socialite, actor, and member of the non-reigning Greek royal family and the extended Danish royal family. He is one of five children of Greece’s Crown Prince Pavlos (eldest son and second child of King Constantine II, the last king of Greece, who died last year and was the godfather of Prince William) and Marie-Chantal Miller: Olympia, 27, Constantine, 25, Achileas, 23, Odysseas, 19. and Aristides, 15.\n\nAchileas has appeared in several episodes of the soap opera The Bold and the Beautiful, as well as short film Just Noise, and has gained influencer status on Instagram with 411,000 followers. In May 2023, the NYC-born royal graduated with a bachelor’s degree from New York University. alongside his girlfriend Isabella Massenet (daughter of Dame Natalie, founder of Net-a-Porter).\n\nThe Greek monarchy is now symbolic and no longer rules. But the royal family is very active on TikTok, so on the family’s page, you can delight in cute videos of Achileas (or “Achi”) doing things like or with his brother.\n\n10. Prince Odysseas-Kimon of Greece and Denmark\n\nOdysseas-Kimon is the fourth child of Pavlos and Marie-Chantal. The 19-year-old recently followed in older brother Achi’s footsteps and enrolled at New York University. Since his parents live in a mansion on Manhattan’s Upper East Side and several of his siblings also live in NYC, he is close to family.\n\nApart from being a student, the young prince also runs a cool streetwear brand called Gallows Humour. His Instagram feed is pretty limited, but he’s still got nearly 16,000 followers.\n\n11. Princess Ingrid Alexandra of Norway\n\nPrincess Ingrid Alexandra, 20, is second in line for the Norwegian throne after her father, Crown Prince Haakon; if and when she eventually takes the throne, she will become Norway’s first female monarch in centuries.\n\nOutside of her royal duties, she is an avid skier and surfer (she won the women’s national junior surfing championship in 2020) and a bit of an adrenaline junkie—she crossed parachute jumping off her bucket list on her 19th birthday.\n\n12. Leah Behn of Norway\n\nLeah Behn, 18, the daughter of Princess Märtha Louise of Norway, may be sixth in line for the Norwegian throne, but she is already the queen of #GetReadyWithMe videos.\n\nAlways on the front row at Oslo Fashion Week, the royal It girl has been living her best life and documenting it all on and Instagram, where she has amassed 419,000 and 127,000 followers, respectively. Her Pinterest-worthy content includes makeup tutorials, moments from her world travels, and snaps of her fabulous wardrobe.\n\nShe made her red-carpet debut at a 2021 Kylie Cosmetics event and won the Best Beauty Influencer of the Year Award at Norway’s Vixen Awards the same year.\n\n13. Princess Alexandra of Hanover\n\nAlexandra, 24, is the daughter of Princess Caroline of Monaco and the niece of Prince Albert II. She is skilled on the ice, having represented Monaco at the European Youth Olympics in figure skating. Now, you can commonly find her sitting front row at fashion shows—including at Couture Week in Paris in February 2024.\n\n14. Princess Elisabeth of Belgium\n\nPrincess Elisabeth, Duchess of Brabant, 22, daughter of King Philippe and Queen Mathilde, is the heir to the Belgian throne. She is a student at Oxford University, where she is working toward a bachelor’s degree in history and political science—as well as a student of the world, fluent in Dutch, French, German, and English. The royal is also quite outdoorsy, as she enjoys skiing, rowing, and sailing.\n\n15. Tunku Abdul Rahman Sultan Ibrahim of Johor\n\nTunku Abdul Rahman Sultan Ibrahim, 31—the fifth son of Sultan Ibrahim Ismail of the Malaysian state of Johor—is a royal with a need for speed.

Princess Iman Bint Abdullah of Jordan\n\nPrincess Iman, 27, is the eldest daughter of King Abdullah II and Queen Rania; as Jordanian tradition dictates, she is not in line for the throne, as only male Muslim heirs are eligible.\n\nWithout the crown on her mind, the royal has taken to many sporty and academic hobbies. She is a gifted equestrian and was even named the best athlete in her graduating class at International Academy Amman. She went on to study at New York’s Parsons School of Design. Iman was the first of her three siblings to marry; she tied the knot last spring with Jameel Alexander Thermiotis, a managing partner of Greek descent at a New York venture capital firm. For the special day, she looked gorgeous in a long-sleeved gown with lace details on the cuffs and a mock neck, by Dior.\n\nSpeaking of gorgeous, the princess is a spitting image of her mom.\n\n17. Princess Aiko of Japan\n\nPrincess Aiko, 22, the only child of Emperor Naruhito, is not in line for the throne (as Japanese tradition allows only men to reign), but she has the disposition of a leader regardless. In addition to fulfilling her official duties as a member of the Japanese imperial family, Aiko is in her final year at Gakushuin University studying Japanese language and literature. Come her graduation in April 2024, she plans to work for the Japanese Red Cross Society, as she holds causes like helping survivors of natural disasters close to her heart.\n\n18.

She has the worldly experience to match, as she studied psychology and social sciences in the United States, France, and Ireland; worked as a journalist in the Middle East; and interned at the United Nations in New York. She is also a master on the tennis court. Oh, and she’s pregnant! She and husband Nicolas Bagory will welcome their first child this spring.\n\n19. Princess Catharina-Amalia of Orange\n\nThe 20-year-old, whose parents are King Willem-Alexander and Queen Máxima, is the heir apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, which includes the Caribbean countries of Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten.

During her first summer break, she worked at a beach bar in The Hague.\n\nThe young princess has often championed mental health and LGBTQIA+ issues in her charity work. Her very royal hobbies include riding, tennis, and singing.\n\n20. Countess Eloise of Orange-Nassau\n\nCountess Eloise, 21, is the first child and daughter of Prince Constantijn and Princess Laurentien of the Netherlands, and sixth in the line of succession to the Dutch throne. She is the only royal member of the family known to have an open Instagram account and often sells vintage clothes via the app, where she has 440,000 followers.\n\nThe royal is studying at the Hotel School in Amsterdam, and in 2021, she published a, Learning by Doing, about clothing, student life, and food.\n\n21. Princess Carolina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies\n\nThis 20-year-old princess is quite accomplished. Currently living between Paris, Monte Carlo, and Rome, she speaks six languages fluently (English, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Russian), works on various charitable endeavors, is active in several sports, and is studying acting. She made her film debut in 2014’s Grace of Monaco, next to Hollywood veteran Nicole Kidman. She has walked the red carpet at the Venice and Cannes film festivals, regularly sits front row at fashion shows around the world, and keeps a fabulous account of her adventures on Instagram, where she has 139,000 followers.\n\nUnfortunately, Carolina and her sister, Maria Chiara, are not technically in line to the throne, as succession to lead the House of Bourbon-Two Sicilies is limited to male heirs.\n\n22. Princess Maria Chiara of Bourbon-Two Sicilies\n\nA fashion influencer and philanthropist with a cool 104,000 Instagram followers, this 19-year-old is the younger sister of Carolina, and also lives between Paris, Monte Carlo, and Rome. Apart from being a regular at Fashion Weeks around the world, she also spends much time working with multiple charities—for example, she is an ambassador for France and Italy for the World Wildlife Fund.\n\nIn her free time, she plays piano, does judo (for which she has won medals), and plays tennis (for which she has won several trophies at the Monte-Carlo Country Club). She also speaks six languages, like her older sister.\n\n23. Cassius Taylor\n\nCassius Taylor is the son of artists Timothy Taylor and Lady Helen Taylor, whose father, Prince Edward, was Queen Elizabeth II’s cousin.\n\nAt 49th in line to the British throne—and therefore not too worried about ever having to lead the country—the young prince is into the arts. He studied arts management (specializing in music and art business) at Goldsmiths, University of London, and in 2022 founded Telltale, an “experiential consultancy” platform offering DJ sets around the world.\n\nIt’s no surprise, then, that the cool royal runs in high-profile circles; one of his close friends is Rafferty Law (son of actor Jude Law).\n\n24. Princess Sophie-Alexandra of Bavaria\n\nPrincess Sophie-Alexandra, 34, gained royal status in May 2023 when she tied the knot with Prince Ludwig Heinrich of Bavaria, 40, great-grandson of the German state’s last monarch, King Ludwig III. The two celebrated their union with a gorgeous wedding in Munich, the Bavarian capital.\n\nThe princess, who was born in Singapore and is a dual Dutch-Canadian citizen, is an academic powerhouse. After graduating with a bachelor’s degree in politics and East European studies from University College London, she earned a master’s from the University of Oxford, and is currently a part-time doctoral candidate in criminology at Oxford. Her work focuses on justice, violence prevention, and women’s rights.\n\nPassionate about her charity work, the royal is a dedicated ambassador for the Children’s Oncology Support Fund, and in February 2024 attended the Aspen Snow Ball hosted by champagne Taittinger, which raised funds for children with cancer.\n\n25. Princess Talita Natasha von Fürstenberg\n\nLast but not least, there is TVF. The chic young granddaughter of wrap-dress icon Diane von Fürstenberg is known professionally as Talita von Furstenberg, 24. She is a socialite, model, and fashion designer currently working for her grandma and launching DVF, the brand, into the modern It Girl era—Talita herself being an It Girl and all.\n\nAs fashion insiders know, designer Diane was once a princess, as she was married to Prince Egon zu Fürstenberg of Germany—the eldest son of Prince Tassilo zu Fürstenberg and Fiat heiress Clara Agnelli—from 1969 to 1983.\n\nAnd although Diane no longer has royal status, Talita is a princess because she is the daughter of Princess Alexandra and Diane and Egon’s son, Prince Alexander von Fürstenberg. On her father’s side, Talita is a member of the German Princely Family of Fürstenberg and an Italian Agnelli family heiress. (Her great-great-grandparents were Edoardo Agnelli and Virginia Bourbon del Monte.)"
