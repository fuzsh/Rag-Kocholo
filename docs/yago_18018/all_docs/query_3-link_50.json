        "text": "The recent centenary of the First World War shone again the spotlight on the status of Queen Victoria as the “Grandmother of Europe,” where eight out of her nine children married into the various royal houses of Europe; and this even continued with her grandchildren. Various books, documentaries, articles, and conferences have focused on Victoria’s older children – particularly Vicky and Alice whose children Kaiser Wilhem II and Tsarina Alexandra played a pivotal role in their country’s histories: with the former helping unleash the First World War and the latter the Russian Revolution that spelled the end for both the Hohenzollern and Romanov dynasties.\n\nTwo recent events in Scandinavia led me to look at Queen Victoria’s younger children and their descendants who have been less well known.\n\nSeptember 2023 marked the Golden Jubilee of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, making him Sweden’s longest reigning monarch (he had already broken the previous record set by Magnus IV’s reign of 44 years & 222 days in 2018). During the state dinner which formed part of the jubilee celebrations, the King was not only joined by members of the Swedish royal family, government officials and other important dignitaries but crucially by his fellow Nordic heads of state – the Queen of Denmark, the King of Norway (also descendants of Queen Victoria) and the Presidents of Finland and Iceland. The September celebrations marked the high point of the jubilee year which saw King Carl Gustaf and his wife Queen Silvia visit every province in Sweden.\n\nPhoto: Thron Ullberg/Kungl. Hovstaterna\n\nAnother event which happened on 14 January 2024 was the abdication of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark after a reign of 52 years. Her abdication marked the end of an era – not only in Denmark but also in Europe where she will be the last queen regnant for a while until the time comes for the likes of Victoria of Sweden, Ingrid-Alexandra of Norway, Leonor of Spain, Amalia of the Netherlands, and Elisabeth of Belgium. Margrethe II had previously said that she would never abdicate but announced her intention to do so when she delivered her annual New Year’s Eve speech to the nation on the 31st December 2023. And unlike Carl Gustaf’s jubilee which passed by unnoticed, the Danish queen’s speech became headline news in the UK, which I suppose is unsurprising given this is unprecedented and led to speculation as to why Margrethe would decide to do a U turn. Is it because she was trying to protect her heir and his wife from the fall out of some recent “scandal”? I believe that the simplest reason is the answer – Margrethe was a heavy smoker and had to undergo an operation last year, so in the end her decades of smoking and health problems associated with age have caught up with her and she felt she could no longer continue with her duties as sovereign.\n\nIt’s not surprising that the first to send a message of support to the abdicating queen and the new king Frederik X was the Swedish King. This message together with, the presence of Queen Margarethe II and being seated alongside the King of Sweden during the jubilee dinner not only underscored the close diplomatic relations between the two countries but also their close familial ties as both are first cousins descended from King Gustaf VI Adolf and his first wife Crown Princess Margareta.\n\nMargareta born Princess Margaret Victoria Charlotte Augusta Norah of Connaught in 1882 and nicknamed Daisy was one of the three children born to Queen Victoria’s third son, Arthur Duke of Connaught, and his Prussian wife Louise. Arthur could be described as the most “normal” and “boring” of Victoria’s sons, as he had an uneventful and dutiful life as well as a marriage that was happy despite his long-standing affair (which was encouraged by his wife) with Leonie Lady Leslie, a sister of Lady Randolph Churchill.\n\nArthur was also the antithesis of a “problem child.” He was unlike his oldest brother Bertie (the future Edward VII) and younger brother Leopold, both of whom rebelled against their mother’s expectations of them: the former with Victoria’s attempts to turn him into Albert 2.0 while the latter reacted against efforts to cast him into the family’s “saintly invalid” with the determination to live his life to the full. He was also unlike his next oldest brother Alfred who turned into an embittered alcoholic due to the collapse of his marriage to Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia and having to give up his naval career to become Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.\n\nThe abovementioned details are perhaps the reasons why Arthur is the least known of Queen Victoria’s sons and his children by extension are little known as well. While Arthur’s many nieces and nephews mostly married into German royal families, two of his children Arthur and Patricia married into the British aristocracy. Margaret on the other hand married into the Swedish royal family – Prince Gustaf Adolf, the oldest son of Crown Prince Gustav (who would go on to reign as King Gustav V of Sweden) who she met while on holiday with her family in Egypt. After a whirlwind courtship, the couple married at St George’s Chapel at Windsor in 1905, then made their way to Sweden where the princess changed her name to Margareta and made it her mission to assimilate into Swedish life.\n\nShe was vivacious and outgoing which endeared her to Swedes. In addition, she became fluent in Swedish and travelled to various parts of the country to learn more about Sweden and its people. This was also facilitated by her active charity work especially during the First World War where despite Sweden being neutral, Margareta used her office and position to help distribute home comforts to prisoners of war on both sides.\n\nMargareta could also be described as a princess and a woman ahead of her time. She and Gustav Adolf had five children – Gustaf Adolf, Sigvard, Ingrid, Bertil, and Carl Johan – and being a hands-on mother, Margareta refused to turn her children over to be totally raised by nannies and footmen. Taking an active interest in the development of her children, she involved them in many of her interests and even established a school in the family’s residence to give them their first lessons and meet other children their age. Already sports mad due to her British upbringing, with the Swedish press noting her proficiency in sports such as tennis, golf and cycling, Margareta also took to winter sports in her adopted country – enthusiastically encouraging other women to do the same. She founded an all-women hockey team in 1908 and this initiative spawned other all-women’s teams across the country.\n\nMuch like her paternal grandmother Queen Victoria, Margareta was a talented artist and a published author. She was friends with the artist Anna Boberg, her husband’s uncle Prince Eugen, himself a professional artist and was mentored by both. Unlike her grandmother who painted watercolours for her own private enjoyment, Margareta dabbled in oil painting and exhibited her work publicly while her forays into being a published author was through her love of gardening and creation of the garden at Sofiero Palace. Her two books Vår trädgård på Sofiero (Our Garden at Sofiero) and Från blomstergården (From the Flower Garden) were published in 1915 and 1917. Both books were illustrated with her drawings and photographs then sold in aid of her various charities.\n\nSadly, for her family and adopted country, Margareta died on 1 May 1920 from sepsis. Prior to this she had been suffering from a mastoid in her ear which was a result from a bout of measles and she was also pregnant with her sixth child. Prime Minister Hjalmar Branting on announcing her death said: “the ray of sunshine at Stockholm Palace has gone out.” Interestingly and perhaps as a reaction to her grandmother Queen Victoria’s morbid and obsessive mourning for Prince Albert, Margareta left strict instructions that in the event of her death there should be a little mourning, that children should not wear black, music be played and that her funeral should be open to all.\n\nMargareta was only 38 when she died but in her short life and tenure as Crown Princess, she managed to make an impact in her adopted country so perhaps it’s not surprising that huge numbers of ordinary people turned out for her funeral. She arrived in Sweden at a time when the country was undergoing huge political, economic, and social changes; Margareta responded to those changes positively through her charity and social work. Her social commitment lives on in the memorial fund that was established after her death as well as the causes championed by her great-granddaughter Crown Princess Victoria. Her artistic talents live on through her son Sigvard who carved out a successful career as a designer and technical adviser in film as well as her granddaughter Margrethe II of Denmark who designed costumes and sets for various stage and screen productions.\n\nShe might be virtually unknown in her country of birth but her legacy has lived on in her adopted country.\n\nFurther reading:\n\nUnfortunately books about Crown Princess Margareta are mostly in Swedish and are unavailable in the UK. The centenary of her death in 2020 saw the release of Princess Christina of Sweden’s book Hon Kallades Daisy (She Was Called Daisy) while the Royal Palace in 2021 hosted the exhibition Daisy: Kronprinsessan Margareta (Daisy: Crown Princess Margareta) which ran until 9 January 2022.

It will also be the first coronation in nearly 70 years and much like his mother Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation which was the first to be televised, Charles III’s coronation will be the first to utilise both social media and YouTube as well as traditional communication channels.\n\nSince the death of Queen Elizabeth II and the ascension of King Charles III to the throne, there has been a lot of speculation about what his coronation will be like; ranging from the sensible for instance, what sort of coronation will it be owing to the current economic climate? to the ridiculous and fanciful such as what tiaras will be worn. It has also not been helped either by the continuing drama surrounding Prince Harry and his wife Meghan – will they attend the coronation or not? Only time will tell if they do turn up or not.\n\nFrom initial press reports (many of which should be taken with a pinch of salt anyway), the coronation will be markedly shorter, the ceremony will be around an hour and a half compared to 4 to 5 hours in 1953. Due to costs, the Coronation Review of the Fleet has been scrapped and Queen Camilla has returned to the pre-1831 practice of using a previous consort’s crown instead of having a new one made. There’s also the acknowledgement that the Britain of 2023 is very different from 1953, as politicians and peers have reportedly been told that they will not be guaranteed invitations.\n\nContrary to popular belief, the coronation is not a ceremony that is unchanging or set in stone. True, there are some elements such as the recognition and anointing that remain more or less the same but certain parts of the ceremony have been altered or removed to fit the changing times and make concessions to economic realities. Any cost cutting has its historical precedent – for instance when William IV did away with certain practices such as the coronation banquet, the King’s Champion making an appearance in full medieval armour and axing the position of herb strewers – ladies who proceeded the Sovereign’s route inside the Abbey by strewing sweet smelling herbs and floral petals.\n\nChanges to the coronation ceremony have also been made especially in the last century, as there is the acknowledgement that the main role of the Monarchy is to act as a unifying force and that the coronation is for the people regardless of status, colour & creed, not only for the aristocracy and members of the Established Church.\n\nIn the run up to the event on 6 May, we shall be looking at three of the coronations that took place in the last century, how they have changed, how they have left their mark for the 1953 ritual and how they can influence the upcoming ceremony.\n\nKING EDWARD VII AND QUEEN ALEXANDRA:\n\nWhen the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra was scheduled for 26 June 1902, there was a general state of speculation about what the coronation would be like since the last one took place in 1838 and hardly anyone who witnessed it was still around by 1902.\n\nThe new king (unlike his mother) loved ceremony and pomp. Anna Keay observed that, “he loved the theatre and had a strong sense of both drama and romance.” This love of theatre was corollary to Edward’s strong sense of the importance of the visibility of the monarch and the royal family to the public. As he remonstrated with Queen Victoria, “the more people see the Sovereign, the better it is for the country.” As king, he revived much of the pomp and ceremony abandoned by Victoria after Prince Albert’s death and his renovation of Buckingham Palace was to reassert its status as the centre of the monarchy and to fulfil its main function of welcoming and entertaining guests from all over the country, the Empire, and the world.\n\nDespite King Edward VII’s love of pageantry, he felt that many aspects of the ascension and coronation ceremonies were out step with the times. He objected to the anti-Catholic wording in the ascension oath and when told that it would not be possible to change it, got his own back by mumbling through the words: thereby signifying his disapproval of the continued prejudice against many of his subjects and his desire to be a “king of all the people.” For the coronation however, he was persuaded by the courtier Reginald Brett, Viscount Esher that its “ancientness was precisely what gave the occasion its solemn majesty, and that he should retain, even enhance ‘all the ancient practices and traditions,’ omitting only those that were actually ‘ridiculous.’”\n\nIn the run up to the coronation, Edward VII was not feeling well, and doctors diagnosed an abscessed appendix. He was persuaded to undergo an operation, but the king refused, telling his doctor Sir Francis Laking, “the Coronation cannot be postponed. I won’t hear of it. I cannot and will not disappoint the people…..I will go to the Abbey on Thursday if I die there.” To which the doctor replied, “If Your Majesty did go on Thursday to the Abbey in all human probability you would die there.” In the end the king reluctantly gave way, the coronation was postponed to a later date, and the operation was performed in the Music Room at Buckingham Palace.\n\nDespite the postponement, Edward VII insisted that regional celebrations and the planned Coronation dinner for London’s poor should go ahead. He and Queen Alexandra paid for the festivities and meals out of their own pockets while businesses and wealthy friends such as Sir Thomas Lipton also contributed. The dinner was bolstered by food prepared for the postponed banquet which the king ordered should be given to the poor to avoid waste. One wonders what the poor of London made of the amounts of lobster and other rich foodstuffs they were served together with the regular fare of roast beef, potatoes, and ale.\n\nThe coronation was finally held on 9 August and as most of the representatives from other countries had left London due to the postponement, the ceremony had more of a domestic and Empire wide flavour as various African chiefs, Indian princes & sultans from Malaya joined the Dominion prime ministers in Westminster Abbey. Despite the postponement, Edward VII still felt weak, and parts of the ceremony had to be shortened further to avoid any strain and fatigue. Much to his disappointment, the king was crowned with the lighter Imperial State Crown rather than the St Edward’s Crown which was heavier. Ironically, Edward VII would have the opportunity to wear his namesake’s crown when it was placed atop his coffin in 1910.\n\nDespite the solemnity of the occasion, Edward VII saw the lighter side of things. As he and Queen Alexandra made their way down the stairs at Buckingham Palace, he saw his grandchildren looking at awe in him. He approached them with a smile and asked, “Good morning, children. Am I not a funny looking old man?” At his insistence, a special section of the Abbey was allocated for his special lady friends and previous and current mistresses which the wags described as “The King’s Loose Box.”\n\nThe actual ceremony went smoothly despite a few mishaps, as the Archbishop of Canterbury, Frederick Temple refused to delegate some of his duties despite his great age and infirmities. Throughout the ceremony, Temple had to be supported by two other bishops as he was struggling with his legs and during the actual crowning, his hands were shaking so badly that he placed the crown the wrong way round on Edward’s head and the king had to discreetly turn it around the right way. Temple’s eyesight was also so bad that he had to read the service from large scrolls written in large print.\n\nWhen the time came for the peers to perform their homage, it was George Prince of Wales who went first and observers noted that as George rose, his father pulled him closer to him and kissed him on both cheeks, a sign of the affection the king held for his only surviving son.\n\nAs for Queen Alexandra, the question was regarding her role in the ceremony and what she would be wearing as the last Queen Consort to be crowned was Queen Adelaide in 1831 and hardly anyone who witnessed that event was still alive to recall it. While courtiers scrambled to find records of previous coronations to ascertain what role the new consort would play, Queen Alexandra was seemingly unconcerned with precedent especially with regards to dress. Which was unsurprising as ever since the Danish-born queen came to Britain to marry the future Edward VII in 1863, Alexandra had been known for her beauty and style – other women copied what she wore and for the coronation, the new queen had a clear idea of what she wanted, “I know better than all the milliners and antiquaries. I shall wear exactly what I like and so will all my ladies – basta!”\n\nAlexandra was in her way a rule breaker and unlike her mother-in-law Queen Victoria and her daughter-in-law, Queen Mary she didn’t exclusively patronise British designers and stores for her clothes. For the coronation Morin Blossier, a Parisian dressmaker, made Alexandra’s gown from fabric produced in India and designed by the vicereine of India, Lady Curzon. The gown was two pieces made up of a boned bodice and a long skirt, from a cloth of gold and over it a net of Indian embroidery containing the motifs of the British Isles and the Empire. Completing the gown were long hanging sleeves and a standing collar that was trimmed with gold lace. The only part of her coronation ensemble that was British made was her robe of state made by Marshall and Snelgrove but instead of the traditional violet and crimson, it was in petunia purple. The robe was carried by eight pages of honour instead of the traditional maids of honour. Unlike the maids of honour who were the daughters of dukes, marquesses and earls, Alexandra’s pages were drawn from all ranks of the aristocracy and gentry.\n\nFor her crown, Alexandra decided against the traditional four full arches and decided to have eight half arches as a nod to her homeland, Denmark. Denmark was also reflected in one of the pieces of jewellery she wore – a replica of the Dagmar Cross which was given to her by her uncle Frederick VII on her wedding day. On her crown as well was the Koh-i-Noor diamond which later adorned the crowns of Queens Mary and Elizabeth in 1911 and 1937 respectively. However, there is an intriguing mystery about the many of the stones in Queen Alexandra’s crown; we know that the Koh-i-Noor was removed and replaced with a crystal version but the way the other stones were placed would have made it difficult for jewellers to prise them out without damaging the frame. Suzy Menkes who closely examined the crown now held at the Tower of London mused:\n\nCan it be that Queen Alexandra (“I shall wear exactly what I like…..Basta!”) chose to be crowned with a lightweight more comfortable crown rather than to have her head weighed down with real stones? Did the splendid, stately Queen Alexandra, a vision of Majesty in her maharajah’s ransom of jewellery, became Queen of England before God and her King in a crown of paste? (p. 49)\n\nPerhaps Menkes has a point here as it wasn’t only comfort that Queen Alexandra seemed to be after during the Coronation but also a mix of religious belief and vanity. Due to Temple’s frailty, it was decided that the Archbishop of York, William Maclagan would preside over the crowning of the queen. Prior to the ceremony, Alexandra had a meeting with Maclagan to go over the ceremony and was anxious with regards to the anointing. Traditionally, the oil would be poured on the head but as the queen would be wearing a toupee to conceal her thinning hair, she was worried that the liquid would damage the hairpiece. Maclagan solved the problem by anointing Alexandra over the forehead and according to Consuelo Duchess of Marlborough, one of the canopy bearers, the queen didn’t flinch when the oil trickled from her forehead down her nose.\n\nWhen Alexandra was finally crowned, it was the cue for the 400 peeresses in the congregation to put on their coronets and since they were also wearing tiaras, they had to arch their hands high to put them on. The sight of 400 white gloved hands high in the air in an almost balletic fashion was one of the highlights of the ceremony; as it was when following the short ceremony, Queen Alexandra wearing her crown and carrying both the consort’s sceptre and ivory rod, dropped a deep bow as she passed her husband the king. As Jane Ridley observed, “[Alexandra] was fifty-six, heavily made up, allegedly bald and almost stone deaf, but she seemed like a queen from a fairy-tale.”\n\nLEGACY:\n\nThe 1902 coronation would set many of the templates that would be followed in subsequent coronations. On Edward VII’s orders, the coachman’s box in the Gold State Coach was removed and the carriage was driven by postillion riders to enable the crowds to get a good view of him and the queen as they drove past. The box was never returned and since then, the coach has always been driven postillion style.\n\nA new state landau was also built for a post-coronation drive down the East End of London and its large body was built to accommodate the king’s rotund frame. This carriage has been widely used since then for various state and ceremonial occasions.\n\nEdward VII’s coronation also saw the first large scale participation by soldiers from the Empire and Dominions which again would be a defining feature in subsequent coronations.\n\nHowever, the biggest legacy of the 1902 coronation was in music. Sir Frederick Bridge, the man in charge of the music for the coronation, decided to use music from the great English composers of the 16th and 17th centuries – Thomas Tallis, Orlando Gibbons and Henry Purcell as well as those from the 19th century such as Sir Arthur Sullivan. There were also new commissions from contemporary British composers such as Sir Walter Parratt and Sir Hubert Parry. The latter has had the most impact on the ceremony as his version of “I Was Glad” together with the traditional “vivats” as performed by the King’s Scholars of Westminster School has been used in subsequent coronations.\n\nAn even bigger impact was Edward Elgar’s music. Although he was not commissioned to contribute to the music during the actual coronation service, he composed the Coronation Ode with words provided by the poet, essayist, and academic A.B. Benson. It was commissioned for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House on 31 June 1902 which was subsequently cancelled because of the postponement. The ode eventually had its debut performances at Sheffield and Bristol where it was well received. As Jeffrey Richards wrote:\n\nThe Coronation Ode of 1902 is ceremonial music of the first rank, the lyricism and splendour animated by genuine emotion and belief….[i]t is a celebration of monarchy and a hymn of hope to all the virtues and qualities that were expected of the new reign – peace, prosperity, freedom. (p. 63)\n\nThe sixth movement of the ode has now lived on as “Land of Hope and Glory” as Benson modified the original lyrics which included the famous chorus that has remained sung to this day at sports events and the Last Night of the Proms.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nDavid Duff.

She is succeeded by her son Charles, who at 73 years of age has already beaten the record previously set by William IV (who succeeded his brother George IV in 1830 at the age of 65) as the oldest person to ascend the throne.\n\nHaving read reams of commentary and watched countless footage about Elizabeth II’s passing two things struck me. One was due to the longevity of her reign is that how many people have said that they have known no other monarch than Elizabeth II. Even my father-in-law who was born in 1940 and was 11 years old when George VI died said pretty much the same thing. The second is when talking to various friends and colleagues there was the sense that they thought Elizabeth II would either live as long as her mother and husband or go on forever.\n\nDuring the 10 days of national mourning, we’ve noticed how history has repeated itself both with the coverage of the death and funeral as well as with the ascension of a new king.\n\nQUEEN VICTORIA VIS A VIS QUEEN ELIZABETH II\n\nOn the face of it, there is not much to say about supposed similarities between Queen Victoria and Queen Elizabeth II, in fact, commentators in the 1950s would always compare Elizabeth II to her Tudor predecessor and namesake Elizabeth I. There were hyperbolic proclamations of the hope that a second Elizabethan era would be as glorious as the first Elizabethan age and even Winston Churchill himself fell for the whole hype, proclaiming the new queen as another “Gloriana.”\n\nHowever, with the passage of time one can see the similarities not between the two Elizabeths but Elizabeth II and Queen Victoria. Both were not born to be monarchs but ended up on the throne due to twists of fate – Victoria due to the death of her cousin Princess Charlotte and the childlessness of another uncle, William IV, and Elizabeth due to the abdication of her uncle, Edward VIII. Both women were not particularly well educated but Elizabeth, once she was heir to the throne, had the advantage of at least taking lessons in history and constitutional theory from Henry Marten, a vice provost of Eton. There was also a striking similarity with their marriages – both women were devoted to their husbands and the marriages had an impresario behind them, with Victoria and Albert there was King Leopold I of the Belgians while Elizabeth and Philip had Lord Louis Mountbatten. It could be said that both Leopold and Mountbatten harboured dynastic ambitions and lived vicariously through their relations: the former with his ambition of having a Coburg on every throne in Europe and the latter with avenging his father Prince Louis of Battenberg’s forced resignation as First Sea Lord in 1914 due to his German title and deepening his links with the main line of the royal family.\n\nThe reigns of Victoria and Elizabeth II are characterised by a longevity which saw great political, economic, social, and technological change. While Victoria’s reign saw the British empire at its height as well as being the mistress of the seas, Elizabeth’s reign saw the final dismantling of empire and its transition to the Commonwealth; and whilst British naval power has long since gone, the country’s soft and cultural power has not waned.\n\nCrucially, both queens utilised the leading technologies of the day in order to connect with their people. Queen Victoria had photography, post cards the telegraph and even became a published author herself, helping entrench the image of her (especially during the second half of her reign) as “the Widow of Windsor” – black dress, white widow’s cap and pearl and diamond jewellery. The last years of her life also coincided with the advent of the motion picture and were used during her Diamond Jubilee and her funeral procession.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II reigned over a period where there were even greater technological advances. Her coronation in 1953 was televised, as were her Christmas speeches from 1957 onwards, and even weddings beginning with that of her sister Princess Margaret in 1960. She also began engaging with television: starting with the infamous Royal Family documentary in 1969 which was later acknowledged to be a mistake. However, it did not dissuade her from authorising more documentaries about the monarchy and its various aspects from the 1990s onwards, even providing commentaries and sharing her thoughts with some of them. The mass media also played a role in disseminating her image through photographs which over time inform our enduring image of Elizabeth II – the brightly coloured hat & dress, sensible shoes, handbag at the crook of her arm, corgis and horses.\n\nThe beginning of the 21st century saw Elizabeth II engaging with various new modes of communication such as the Internet and social media via its own website as well as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube accounts. It is highly significant that this engagement via the new media was very visible with her lying in state, funeral and committal service being televised and reported in real time via the Royal Family’s social media accounts.\n\nKING EDWARD VII VIS A VIS KING CHARLES III\n\nThe longevity and popularity of Victoria and Elizabeth II has led to concerns about their respective heirs, Albert Edward and Charles, as both men were not popular when they were Prince of Wales. As Victoria and Elizabeth aged, there were regular concerns and speculation about the state of the monarchy and the country after both women had passed away and their unpopular heirs succeeded them.\n\nAlbert Edward who succeeded to the throne in 1901 as Edward VII had an unhappy childhood -burdened by the twin expectations of monarchy rising to the challenges of the post-French Revolution order and his mother’s expectation that he would be the mirror image of his father Prince Albert as man and monarch. Unfortunately for Victoria, Edward would rebel against his upbringing and his life as Prince of Wales was characterised by gluttony, womanising, and gambling. One can see shades of George IV in Edward’s behaviour but unlike his predecessor, he was prudent with his money and benefitted from good financial advice which kept him out of debt.\n\nHe was also the subject of several scandals: most notably being named a co-respondent to the Mordaunt divorce case and the Tranby Croft case which damaged his standing and was held up as an example of how the upper classes fell short of the Church’s teaching on marital fidelity and middle class notions of respectability.\n\nKing Charles III’s childhood in contrast was not as unhappy as Edward’s but there’s no denying Elizabeth II and Philip were distant parents and the latter’s choice of schools did not suit Charles’ interests and sensitive nature. His unpopularity as Prince of Wales has been mostly through the very public collapse of his marriage to Diana Princess of Wales (who surprisingly had some parallelisms with Edward VII’s wife and queen Alexandra), his outspokenness and meddling on several issues, especially those to do with the environment.\n\nDespite all the naysayers, Edward VII proved to be a good and popular king. As Prince of Wales, he was conscious of the need for the royal family to be visible to its people and more than once persuaded his mother Queen Victoria to come out of her prolonged mourning telling her that “the more people see the Sovereign, the better it is for the country.” His reign as King saw the revival of much of the ceremony and pageantry abandoned by his mother and in order to facilitate this, the Mall was broadened with Admiralty Arch built as a gateway from Trafalgar Square to Buckingham Palace.\n\nThe bad relationship between mother and son was one of the reasons why Edward VII was unprepared when he ascended the throne. As one of his biographers Philip Magnus observed “[t]he art of constitutional government had to be learnt by King Edward, who found it increasingly convenient to meet and talk to individual ministers upon purely social occasions.” He also used his love of France and familial connections to help pave the way for the Entente Cordiale with France in 1904 and the Anglo-Russian alliance in 1907.\n\nIn light of Elizabeth II’s death, the question now is what sort of monarch will Charles III be? I don’t think he’s as unprepared as Edward VII was but there are lingering doubts about whether he will change his habit of outspokenness. During his first address as king, Charles has sought to assure the nation that like his mother, he will be committed to upholding Britain’s constitutional principles and traditions as well as acknowledging that “as I take up my new responsibilities. It will no longer be possible for me to give so much of my time and energies to the charities and issues for which I care so deeply.” The latter is especially telling as it seems to signal his awareness that his environmentalism is increasingly being seen as out of step with the Great British Public struggling to heat their homes this coming autumn and winter.\n\nThere has also long been the belief that the new King’s routine will not be the same as Elizabeth II’s, with media reports of plans to open Balmoral Castle fully to the public and Buckingham Palace being opened longer than the usual two months summer opening. Even as Prince of Wales, Charles was already called for a slimmed down monarchy, and it will be interesting to see how this all plays out.\n\nEither way Charles III would do well to follow his mother’s example of dignified silence and Edward VII’s dictum that he is the “king of all the people” – a unifying force and not a divisive one. Only time will tell how he will be as king amidst all the speculation and criticism due to his past actions and words – will King Charles III prove his doubters and critics wrong just as Edward VII did one hundred and twenty one years ago?\n\n2019 marks the bicentenary of Victoria and Albert’s births. There have already been books published, conferences as well as documentaries that attempts to shed new light or even (disappointingly) rehash the same old myths and out-dated information on the royal couple’s life and crucially that of Victoria’s life and reign.\n\nAfter a hiatus in 2018, ITV’s popular drama Victoria made a return this year and this time is set between 1848 and 1851. By the time series 3 opens, Victoria and Albert already have five children (Victoria, Albert Edward, Alice, Alfred and Helena) and she will go on give birth to two more (Louise and Arthur). Also, Albert by this time has, not without some difficulty, also established himself as the power behind the throne. While I have not had the time to do my customary fortnightly recaps, here are some of the thoughts I assembled while watching the programme:\n\n(For more detailed recaps, please visit the Armchair Anglophile)\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\nThe royal children especially Vicky and Bertie – while the programme took care to show the (still growing) family, the main focal point was Vicky (Princess Royal) and Bertie (Prince of Wales) who would have been eight and seven in 1848. The characterisations of the two oldest children are spot on, with Vicky showing the precociousness that would mark her as Albert’s favourite child. Bertie on the other hand while aware of his destiny isn’t happy; he tells anyone who is listening that he doesn’t want to be king and that Vicky being the eldest should be the sovereign.Bertie’s tantrums about not wanting to be king are the least of his parents’ worries. While the bright Vicky doesn’t need pushing and cajoling with her lessons and her ability to absorb and retain knowledge, Bertie’s progress is slow and wanting compared to his sister. In desperation, Victoria and Albert consult a phrenologist George Coombe who studies Bertie’s head and the verdict isn’t good, as Coombe delivered his verdict: “The feeble quality of the brain will render the Prince highly excitable… intellectual organs are only moderately well developed. The result will be strong self-will, at times obstinacy.” While phrenology is now dismissed as a pseudo-science, Coombe’s verdict in some aspects would be eerily accurate.\n\nThe Great Exhibition – series 3 concluded with the events leading to the Great Exhibition in 1851 and the final scene where Victoria, Albert and the rest of the family arrive at the Crystal Palace to officially open the exhibition was well done. It was obvious that the production designers did their research and studied contemporary accounts and illustrations in order to recreate that event.\n\nTHE BAD/INDIFFERENT:\n\nMrs Skerrett – the way her character has been written was pure soap and series 3 was no different especially with the way she was written out. The real Mrs Skerrett actually never married and lived to a ripe old age; apart from being Victoria’s chief dresser she was also in charge of the junior ones and was the principal liaison between the Queen and milliners, dressmakers and jewellers. Crucially she also liaised with artists such as Edwin Landseer and William Powell Frith with regards to commissions for paintings. Still Nell Hudson’s portrayal of the kindly and competent dresser was for me well done and kudos to the writer for making the relationship between Skerrett and Victoria at least believable.\n\nSophie Duchess of Monmouth – series 3 saw the introduction of a new Mistress of the Robes for Victoria in the person of Sophie Duchess of Monmouth (Lily Travers). I find the introduction of a fictional lady-in-waiting baffling considering that in real life, Victoria had several interesting women who attended to her: most notably Charlotte Countess Canning, who was married to George Earl Canning who was governor-general (and later first viceroy) of India. Charlotte kept up a correspondence with the Queen even after leaving royal service to join her husband in his Indian posting, and her letters provided Victoria with information about India from a woman’s perspective; which would have been absent in official documents sent by the government in India. The fictional Duchess of Monmouth’s background however is interesting as she’s revealed to be the daughter of a man who made his wealth in trade and that the Duke of Monmouth married her in order to save his crumbling estate and precarious finances, thus demonstrating an early example of the old landed aristocracy in alliance with the new industrial elite. The marriage is unsurprisingly unhappy and the duke always finds an excuse to belittle his wife for her inferior social background; something that the Queen is happy to overlook (again showing her lack of social as well as racial prejudice). Credit also to Daisy Goodwin for not writing Sophie as the stereotypical nouveau riche vulgarian and instead portray her as someone who is doing her best and is a devoted mother. In an interesting twist, part of the Monmouths’ storyline could be seen as a foreshadowing of the real life Mordaunts whose divorce would embroil the future Edward VII in scandal.\n\nTHE UGLY:\n\nThe ropey timeline – while I acknowledge that certain events have to be condensed for dramatic purposes, the timeline leaves a lot to be desired. The cholera epidemic is one example, while this series is set between 1848 and 1851, the “Great Stink,” as the epidemic would be known, did not occur until 1858 and led to the pioneering work of Dr John Snow, who established the cholera was a water borne disease – not airborne as has been previously believed. Another is that of Sir Joseph Bazalgette whose design of a new sewage system for London would ensure that there would be no future repeats of the Great Stink of 1858.\n\nPrincess Feodora – while the Duchess of Kent was MIA in series 3, her place was taken over by Victoria’s half-sister Princess Feodora of Hohenloe-Langenburg (Kate Fleetwood) who is depicted in the programme as arriving in Britain in the wake of the Revolution of 1848. While it’s nice to see more of Victoria’s family, my main objection is the way Feodora has been written and portrayed – the jealous sister who is a mainstay in fairy tales and soap operas. She causes mischief at court, attempts to drive a wedge between Victoria and Albert and is bitter about what she sees as Victoria’s good fortune. The Feodora we see in Victoria is the latest in a line of pantomime villains after Conroy and the Duke of Cumberland in the first two series. The real Princess Feodora (1807-1872) was no such person; despite the 11 year age gap between them she and Victoria were close all their lives and the fact that they were only half-siblings never occurred to them. Victoria was devastated when Feodora left in 1828 to marry an impoverished German prince Ernst of Hohenloe-Langenburg. The two sisters corresponded avidly and Feodora proved to be a source of advice and solace for Victoria especially after Albert’s death in 1861. Victoria meanwhile would help support Feodora’s children, the most notable being Prince Victor of Hohenloe-Langenburg (1833-1891) who settled in Britain as a naval officer and a noted sculptor.\n\nLord Palmerston – in series 3 is played by Laurence Fox who is too young to portray the wily Foreign Secretary, and I believe this was a failed attempt to recapture the buzz that surrounded Rufus Sewell’s portrayal of Lord Melbourne in the first two series. Lighting never strikes twice; while Sewell is a good actor who could convince viewers of Lord Melbourne as a younger, romantic figure, it doesn’t quite work with Fox whose portrayal of Palmerston sometimes descends into parody. Still Fox does make a passable effort of depicting the foreign secretary as an oily politician who happily styles himself as a man of the people and a champion of oppressed peoples abroad seeking freedom and liberalism while being an absentee landlord in Ireland and opposing further reforms at home. The real Palmerston has been described as a “Conservative at home and a Liberal abroad” but his tenure as Home Secretary and Prime Minister where he introduced further reforms to the Factory Act as well as changes to existing penal laws demonstrated that he could be radical as well by the standards of the time. However it is for his time as Foreign Secretary that he is best remembered, he famously declared that Britain had no permanent allies or enemies, only permanent interests, and his foreign policy was consistent with that maxim. His willingness to challenge even Queen Victoria and Prince Albert earned him their distrust but for his role in defending Britain’s interests abroad he received the affection and support of most of the press and public who called him “Pam”.\n\nSeries 3 is pretty much consistent with what we’ve seen with Victoria – romance and soap opera mixed with history. Yet again there were also indifferent subplots that didn’t go anywhere and an upstairs-downstairs relationship which I think didn’t really add anything to the overall narrative. In the end, Victoria’s problem is that it’s not quite able to resolve what the drama wishes to focus on – history or romance. What we get is a muddled mix of both.\n\noooOOOooo\n\nHaving written previously about life at court under the Georgians and Jane Austen, Lucy Worsley has now set her sights on Queen Victoria. Published last year with the paperback version released this year to coincide with the bicentenary, the question now is does Worsley have anything new to say about Britain’s second longest reigning monarch?\n\nI’ve always admired Worsley more as a writer than as a TV presenter and having enjoyed her different take on Jane Austen’s life through the homes she lived in, and she employs almost the same tactic with her biography of Queen Victoria. Rather than to go through the whole gamut of Victoria’s life, Worsley takes twenty four significant events in Victoria’s life and there’s none of the predictable ones such as the birth of her children, the Great Exhibition, the years following Albert’s death or her relationship with her various prime ministers. Instead Victoria’s story starts with the double wedding of the Dukes of Clarence and Kent in 1818, then there are encounters with leading personalities of the era such as Florence Nightingale and the Maharajah Duleep Singh as well as her visit to Benjamin Disraeli at his home Hughenden Manor among others.\n\nWhile Worsley had access to major archives especially the Royal Archives at Windsor where Queen Victoria’s diaries and letters are kept, she has also drawn heavily on recent works on Victoria with at least one or two of rather dubious nature. For instance Julia Baird is described as a historian but she’s not, a quick Google search would tell Worsley that Baird is a journalist whose biography Victoria the Queen is (in my opinion) not a very good one and doesn’t really add anything new to our knowledge or understanding of Victoria.\n\nThe book is a good read but I have a few concerns. First I found her chapters on Duleep Singh and the Munshi (Abdul Karim) to be highly simplistic; while I acknowledge that India and the raj might not be Worsley’s forte and beyond the scope of her tome, the section on Duleep Singh was truncated (or bitin, as I would muse in Filipino) while that on the Munshi was mostly a basic rehash of “white British racist, Indian victim” narrative when in reality it was far more complicated than that. Secondly, we don’t really have an explanation about Sir John Conroy, why was he so controlling? Did it ever cross his mind that perhaps being a benevolent father figure rather than a bully to the young Victoria might have brought him the recognition that he so desired? These are never answered much less raised and I seriously doubt we’ll ever know the answer.\n\nOn the positive side, Worsley brings out well parallelisms between Victoria and her mother the Duchess of Kent – both women lonely, in need of male company and frightfully insecure. Just as the Duchess had Conroy as her support, Victoria during her reign leaned heavily on a succession of men either as father figures (in the person of Lord Melbourne), as Gods who could do no wrong (Albert) or as confidants (Disraeli and John Brown). While this seems to make out Victoria as a weak person, Worsley argues that in many ways Victoria underestimated herself.\n\nNo more is this more apparent during her marriage to Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. While this marriage has always been portrayed as one of domestic bliss and romance, in recent years, historians have attempted to reassess the couple’s relationship and unearth that it wasn’t all hearts and flowers. I’ve always long suspected and Worsley confirms that Victoria was always more in love with Albert than he with her. Despite their shared interests and Victoria’s obvious pride at Albert’s achievements, the marriage was also punctuated by blazing rows and a mass of seething resentments. All of these began early on when Albert chafed at not being allowed to share in Victoria’s duties and where he was not even allowed any say in the royal nursery. Victoria on the other hand resented the constant pregnancies and found motherhood especially when her children were babies distasteful.\n\nOne aspect of the marriage which Worsley brings up especially in the chapter on Osborne House was Albert’s desire for control and this Italianate house which he designed was his domain. If Victoria was ever aware of Albert’s controlling nature, she chose to overlook it and held him as the standard to which her children especially her sons should aspire. However, Albert was not always the superman his wife and history would look up to – during the Crimean War, Albert bombarded the government with numerous memorandums with suggestions as how to improve things which the government more or less ignored. Victoria roused herself to do what she can for the morale of the troops and encourage Florence Nightingale in her pioneering nursing work. She knitted comforts for the soldiers, wrote letters of condolence to the bereaved, inspected hospitals and gave her name to a medal that was to be awarded to all ranks for valour.\n\nIt was Victoria’s approach that worked and was much appreciated; her efforts during the Crimean War was one that her successors have continued to utilise ever since. It was a sign of Victoria’s “emotional intelligence” and to underscore that someone high up cared for the welfare of the ordinary soldier and person; not just as a matter of policy or popularity, but as a deep-felt and genuine emotional connection.\n\nVictoria was a complex woman and while there are far more weightier tomes out there that delve into this monarch’s life in greater detail, even with these mere twenty-four events, Worsley has more or less succeeded in bringing this queen who gave her name to an era in all her contradictions in an accessible way.\n\nEvery Christmas the Sovereign delivers a speech to the nation – it usually lasts for ten to fifteen minutes and reflects on the year that is passing and hopes for the future. The speech has become so ingrained in how the British celebrate Christmas that it has been seen as a tradition and part of the routine of how people observe the festive season. But as like other things with the British monarchy, this “tradition” is not as old as we might think and from a historical point of view is seen as one of the many ways by which the royal family has utilised modern technology to reach out to its people as well as a means of adapting to the world around them.\n\nThe first Christmas speech was broadcast over the radio by King George V on 25 December 1932. As he would write in his diary: “At 3:35, I broadcasted a short message of 251 words to the whole Empire from Francis’ (Knollys) room.” Actually the broadcast was at 3:50pm as the clocks at Sandringham (where the broadcast took place) were set thirty minutes faster than normal time to maximise daylight. The fact that the King had agreed to broadcast a speech over the festive period was a triumph for the nascent British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) under the leadership of its Director General John Reith and it was used to inaugurate the corporation’s World Service.\n\nHowever, it had not been an easy road to that historic event in 1932. Although radio had been around since the 1920s and the BBC was established in 1926, the King resisted any attempts to engage with the new medium. This despite the fact that he allowed his speeches for important state and ceremonial occasions such as the opening of the British Empire exhibition at Wembley to be broadcast live over the radio.\n\nGeorge V was instinctively and naturally a conservative and had been a reluctant participant in the changes brought upon by political, social and demographic changes during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As the second son of the future King Edward VII, George V was originally not trained to become King; rather it was his older brother Prince Albert Victor (known to the family as “Eddy”) Duke of Clarence who received the education deemed appropriate for a future monarch.\n\nThe Prince of Wales, mindful of the brutal hothouse education that was imposed on him by his own father Prince Albert, took great care to ensure that his children had at least the semblance of a normal (by the standards of the time) upbringing which would allow them to be children. He also enrolled Eddy and George in the navy with the understanding that while the former would eventually leave in order to further prepare himself for his role as a future King, George who was the spare and a relatively junior member of the royal family stayed; with an eye towards becoming a career naval officer in order to make his way in the world.\n\nAs Matthew Glencross noted, his time in the navy would have an eventual impact on George’s outlook, mentality and style of kingship. Unlike the army, the navy treated everyone the same regardless of social status. Every cadet had to undergo the same type of training and shared the same type of accommodation and rations. There was no special treatment for George just because he was a prince and whatever he felt about the separation from his parents and siblings (to whom he was very close), it was only shared through letters back home and repressed under the idea of duty which he imbibed and would later become a hallmark of his reign.\n\nAnother major impact of the navy on George and his eventual reign was how he saw himself. Because of his naval career, he was often absent from many family gatherings where he could get to know royals from the Continent, many of who were related to him. Unusually also for a prince at that time, George could barely speak French or German and this language barrier was a further factor in his lack of relationships with fellow royals. Glencross further observed that:\n\n“[H]e grew up without a sense of being part of an extended and cosmopolitan royal family…..[t]his meant that, outside his immediate family, by the time he was an adult George felt little affinity with various other royals to whom he was related, whether based in Britain or on the continent……[he] therefore did not, unlike his father and grandmother have a real sense of claiming membership of a Europe-centred ‘Trade Union of Kings’, something so central to his thinking, had little real influence on George, whose thinking was so much more local.” (p. 37)\n\nSince the King’s formative years had been spent with those in the middle class and gentry that were the bedrock of the Royal Navy, he was to see himself as British first and foremost and this would inform the decisions he would make during his reign.\n\nGeorge V’s view of himself as thoroughly British would stand him in good stead when he ascended the throne on the death of his father King Edward VII in 1910, and crucially during the First World War and its aftermath. From the beginning of his reign, George was eager to use ceremony to bind the royal family and its peoples- not just in Britain but also across the empire as a “family of nations.” This meant not only following his father’s dictum that “the more the people see their Sovereign the better it is for the country” but going one step further by interacting with ordinary people. He and his wife Queen Mary immediately went on visits to various parts of the United Kingdom, a pattern that continued throughout his reign and which endures to the present day.\n\nThe growing mass media was also harnessed. During the war, the royal family’s activities were reported in the press, just as with their pre-war visits to various towns and cities across the country where they were seen talking to ordinary citizens; the king, queen and their older children were photographed out and about doing their duty and their bit for the war effort. These were not for show but to underline the King’s desire to share with his subjects and soldiers their sacrifices. After the war, the public engagements continued, but there was an increase in the work that the royals did in the field of charity and the voluntary sector; family events such as weddings which were held privately in the past now became state and public occasions. All these were reported in the papers and increasingly were filmed to be shown in newsreels across the country and empire.\n\nPhilip Williamson wrote that as the royal family undertook more patronages and performed more engagements, they began to make more speeches and these were widely reported and commented upon. While speeches could be relied upon to be published in the newspapers, the novelty of hearing royalty speak live would be made possible with the development of radio or wireless technology. As early as 1923, it had already been proposed to broadcast live the wedding of Prince Albert Duke of York to Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, something which the couple agreed to but was vetoed by the Archbishop of Canterbury on the grounds that ‘men listening to the service in pubs would not bother to take their hats off.’ The following year, the opening ceremonies of the exhibition at Wembley were broadcast live and afforded the opportunity for the public to listen to the King speak even if they were not present at the venue itself.\n\nAs mentioned earlier in this blog, George V, while seeing the value of mass media as a way to cement that closer bond between crown and people, was disinclined to make a speech that would be broadcast outside an important occasion. It took years of persuasion not only from Reith but even courtiers: the most notable being Lord Stamfordham, the private secretary, and his assistant Sir Clive Wigram, to convince the King of the merits of making such a broadcast. Both men had long seen the potential of the new medium of broadcasting as a way for the royal family to reach out more to the people and thought that an address either during Christmas or New Year would achieve that objective.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1932 when together with the Prime Minister Ramsay Macdonald, that Reith and Wigram (who by then had replaced Stamfordham as Private Secretary) were finally able to persuade the reluctant King to make such a broadcast. Reith offered the King the option of a Christmas Day or New Year’s Day broadcast: George chose the former as he reasoned that the vast majority of people would be with their families that day just as he would be and it would underscore the importance of Christmas as a family day.\n\nOnce the King had agreed to deliver a speech on Christmas Day, he was not a passive bystander content to leave the planning and logistics to his courtiers and the BBC. While Rudyard Kipling was drafted to write the speech, there was active input and feedback from the monarch, ensuring that his character would shine through the speech. A BBC crew travelled up to Sandringham for the broadcast and after selecting a room for the broadcast to be carried out, George participated in voice tests to determine where in the room the table and the microphones would be set up. The control room was set up in the room next door while the microphones and cue light that were to be used by the King were covered in cases made out of Australian walnut.\n\nIt was understandable that the King would be nervous and so the table that was used for the broadcast was swathed in thick cloth to deaden the sound of rustling paper. As for the time that the speech would be broadcast, it was decided to schedule it at 3 o’clock in the afternoon as that time was seen as the most advantageous for reaching most of the countries of the Empire by shortwaves from British transmitters.\n\nThe speech itself was short, as the King observed in his diary, only 251 words, but they underlined George’s view of Britain and the Empire as one big family, and the possibilities of technology in enabling communication between this wide family scattered across the globe:\n\n“Through one of the marvels of modern Science, I am enabled, this Christmas Day, to speak to all my peoples throughout the Empire. I take it as a good omen that Wireless should have reached its present perfection at a time when the Empire has been linked in closer union. For it offers us immense possibilities to make that union closer still.\n\n“It may be that our future may lay upon us more than one stern test. Our past will have taught us how to meet it unshaken. For the present, the work to which we are all equally bound is to arrive at a reasoned tranquillity within our borders; to regain prosperity without self-seeking; and to carry with us those whom the burden of past years has disheartened or overborne.”\n\n“My life’s aim has been to serve as I might, towards those ends. Your loyalty, your confidence in me has been my abundant reward.”\n\n“I speak now from my home and from my heart to you all. To men and women so cut off by the snows, the desert or the sea, that only voices out of the air can reach them; to those cut off from fuller life by blindness, sickness, or infirmity; and to those who are celebrating this day with their children and grand-children. To all—to each—I wish a Happy Christmas. God Bless You!”\n\nIt was perhaps just as well that the table had been covered with that thick cloth as George revealed later that his hands were shaking throughout the broadcast. If there was any trace of nerves, the listeners did not notice. In fact, the broadcast was well received; as the writer Donald Spoto in his study of the royal family observed, George V’s speeches were a natural expression of his character and the Christmas speech was no different. The broadcast also revealed that the King had a talent for and showed himself to be an effective communicator over the radio; it also made him more human and approachable. By hearing his voice over the wireless, it was as if the King was present in every home that had tuned in to hear him speak.\n\nAlthough pleased that the speech went well, George V had no intention of making the Christmas address an annual event due to his nerves but upon seeing the letters of appreciation from ordinary members of the public not just in Britain but across the empire, he agreed to broadcast a speech every Christmas with the last in 1935. And while King George VI due to his stammer was not keen to carry on what his father had started, by December 1939 with the Second World War already in full swing, the Christmas broadcast was resurrected and since then it has been an annual fixture in British radio and later television.\n\nWhat made that first broadcast a success and led to the development of a new tradition? The writer John Pearson mused that George V’s “resonant diction and nautical sincerity” played a part and which one of the King’s early biographers, John Gore observed:\n\n“The homely simplicity and kindliness of his latest address to the Country and empire had been widely appreciated…..He knew himself now to be regarded as the Father of a great Family of Nations…..it was as a father of a family and a Father of the larger family of nations that he spoke each year those Christmas messages and he chose ideas, and words to clothe them, which suited the occasion, the conditions, and the character of the man who would speak them. The very simplicity of thought and the chosen words gave them the King’s authentic signature. He was a simple, natural, frank and friendly man and his favourite words were like himself.” (p. 423)\n\nIt wasn’t just George’s talent for broadcasting but also his wholesale commitment to his duty and another application of the lessons he learned in the navy as a young cadet. They stood him in good stead as the world changed and it enabled him and the royal family to adapt and move with the changing times. His grandmother and father had engaged with the innovations of their time – photography and moving images – and George V continued this engagement with technology through the medium of radio which as Pearson wrote “the broadcast marked in fact a further radical advance in the transformation of the monarchy by the mass media” and thanks to the wireless, “King George V could now seem even closer to his people as the nation heard its sovereign’s greeting live across the either……..[he] became something no monarch had ever been before in history, an intimately appreciated, widely known human being, a simple king in the age of the common man.”\n\nAlthough many would point out that the Christmas speech was another in a series of “invented traditions” and a response a response to a host of specific domestic and international political forces during the late 19th and 20th centuries, it can also be viewed in Takashi Fujitani’s words as a way to “dramatize the cultural values that have been shared by rulers and ruled alike – since who knows when” and these rituals allow the rulers to “place themselves in the cultural frameworks that already unify a people.”\n\nIn the end however, for King George V and his successors the annual Christmas speech was a way for the monarch to emphasise their “duty to the Crown and all it stood for, rather than on the privileges of royalty” as well as to reaffirm that all important bond between the monarch and his people.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nJohn Gore.

This idea was not new however as Victoria and Albert’s Uncle Leopold (later King of the Belgians) always nurtured a dream of having a Coburg on every throne in Europe – a dream which Albert carried on by marrying off his oldest daughter Vicky to Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia. Through Vicky and Fritz, Albert hoped that Prussia and later Germany could be transformed into a liberal state, made in the image of Britain. However this plan unravelled quickly with the early death of Frederick after a brief reign as Kaiser and never came to fruition.\n\nQueen Victoria viewed every pronouncement and scheme from her beloved Albert as akin to holy writ and as Deborah Cadbury shows in her recent work, her matchmaking would not only apply to her children but also extended to her grandchildren. Amidst the backdrop of the assassination of Tsar Alexander II of Russia in 1881 and its aftermath, Cadbury charts the Queen’s machinations as she tried to prop up Albert’s vision through her grandchildren.\n\nThese machinations often did not go according to plan as the Queen was frustrated in her attempts to block the marriages of her Hessian grandchildren Ella and Alix into the Russian imperial family. Victoria was a passionate Russophobe, her view of Russia partly coloured by the two countries’ disagreements over the Ottoman Empire and the on going “Great Game” over Central Asia and India. She also viewed the country as unsafe and admitted to feeling her blood feeling cold over the idea of “gentle, simple Alicky” as tsarina.\n\nAnother one of Victoria’s schemes that failed was marrying off one of her grandsons, Prince Eddy the Duke of Clarence. First on the list was his first cousin Alix of Hesse but she refused him, then Eddy himself fell in love with Helene of Orleans, who despite being Catholic was willing to convert to the Anglican faith to marry him. Despite the Queen’s support and her father’s eagerness to see his daughter as a potential queen consort, Pope Leo XIII threw a spanner into the works of the proposed marriage by refusing the princess a dispensation to convert to Anglicanism. Undeterred, Queen Victoria proposed as fiancée May of Teck, a distant relation with a flawed pedigree, but unfortunately it was not going to be third time lucky for Eddy as not long after the engagement, he caught influenza and died. After a suitable period of mourning, May was then engaged to Eddy’s younger brother George, who was also nursing a broken heart after the Duchess of Edinburgh put a stop to any moves to marry off her daughter Marie to the smitten George. Instead “Missy” was married off by her mother to Crown Prince Ferdinand of Romania.\n\nBubbling under the surface of these entanglements was the constant threat of assassination attempts and violence from revolutionary and anarchist groups. Ella’s gilded bubble was shattered when her husband Sergei was assassinated in 1905, while another of Victoria’s granddaughters, Ena of Battenberg survived one as she and her new husband King Alfonso XIII of Spain were in their carriage following their wedding in 1906. These incidents among others were a harbinger of what was to come especially in the wake of the First World War: but Queen Victoria and her son and successor King Edward VII clung naively to Albert’s vision and maintained that peace could be achieved through strengthening the family bonds between the various monarchies of Europe.\n\nCadbury writes in a brisk and conversational style that is readable and she has helpfully drawn up a handy dramatis personae at the beginning to help the reader through the myriad of names and nicknames that are scattered throughout the narrative. While the popular press then and hagiographers write about these royal marriages as love matches, Cadbury disagrees and presents the reality behind these marriages. The story of Nicholas II and Alexandra (Alix)’s marriage is one of love and tragedy but Cadbury does not ignore the fact that despite their personal happiness both were temperamentally unsuited to the roles they had been destined to fulfill. If Nicholas was not suited to be the autocrat like his father, Alexandra despite her royal blood and impeccable family connections was not the right consort for Nicholas. Her unwillingness to follow well-meaning advice from family and friends not to mention her defence of autocracy with the same zeal that led her to wholeheartedly embrace the Russian Orthodox faith had disastrous consequences for her family and her adopted country.\n\nThe same is true with George V and Mary and I wish that the author had explored more of their married life, as there were already signs from the engagement that the marriage was not one of love as presented to the public but more of duty. One can only speculate what the former May of Teck thought and felt as she was shut out of even something as mundane as decorating her own home and her individuality all her life repressed and subordinate to George’s will and limitations. One of her earliest biographers perceptively noted that for May there was no higher calling than to be royal and perhaps that overrode any other considerations for her.\n\nApart from the narration, this book’s other main strength is with regards to pointing out strongly Queen Victoria’s weakness – her naïve view that foreign policy issues could be solved between families, not really realising that growing movements of nationalism, national identity and national interest were stronger than family ties. This was something her two successors – Edward VII to a lesser extent and George V to a greater extent understood, this played a part with the establishment of the Triple Entente between Britain, France and Russia in 1907 and later withdrawing the offer of asylum to Nicholas II and his family in 1918.\n\nIn the end, as Cadbury shrewdly observed, royal cousinhood would prove to be powerless against the tide of change and in the end also sowed its own seeds of destruction. After the First World War, the political power of monarchy was all but destroyed and never again would “equal” royal marriages be encouraged and viewed as tools of political alliances. A popular saying goes that “blood is thicker than water” but as this tome demonstrates, blood ties would be meaningless against a cataclysmic world war.\n\nOne of the main displays in the current exhibition at Chatsworth House is about the Devonshire House Ball of 1897. The Great Chamber contains displays pertaining to the ball together with life sized images of some of the famous guests at the ball such as the Duke and Duchess of York (the future King George V and Queen Mary), Victor Cavendish (the future 9th Duke of Devonshire) and Mrs Arthur Paget, while next door in the State Drawing Room was a display of some costumes worn during that evening.\n\nThe ball was held at Devonshire House in Piccadilly, London on the 2nd of July, during the height of the London Season. What made this ball special was that it was held in honour of Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee and as Deborah, the 11th Duchess observed, at a time when there were balls almost every night during the height of the Season, for a ball or event to stand out and generate interest, it had to be special. And indeed it was special – invitations were sent out and the dress code was “allegorical or historical costumes before 1815”. This was an encouragement to the guests to give their imaginations full rein for the costume that they planned to wear that evening.\n\nThe hosts of the ball were Spencer Compton Cavendish, 8th Duke of Devonshire and his German born wife Louise. The 8th Duke was a politician: as Marquess of Hartington he served as a Member of Parliament and a cabinet minister as a member of the Liberal Party. He also turned down the opportunity three times to become Prime Minister. By 1897 and now Duke of Devonshire, he was sitting in the House of Lords and had split with the Liberal Party over the issue of Irish Home Rule. With his personal life, the 8th Duke would have made a prime example of the saying “appearances can be deceiving” for his intellect and sense of duty was masked by a languid appearance and indifference towards the social side demanded of his position. He was known to be forgetful, shabbily dressed and had the habit of sleeping anywhere and everywhere. Once, finding the ministerial bench at the House of Lords fully occupied, he found another bench and promptly fell asleep. When he woke up and saw what time it was, he exclaimed, “Good heavens, what a bore, I shan’t be in bed for another seven hours.”\n\nHis appearance and bearing also masked a complicated personal life. A bachelor of many years standing, he carried on a long term affair with Louise Duchess of Manchester but during the 1860s was also involved with the noted courtesan Catherine (“Skittles”) Walters who was known for her prowess as an equestrienne and on the hunting field. The then Marquess of Hartington was smitten with her, provided her with a home in Mayfair and together was openly seen out and about in events such as the Derby. As Sophia Murphy observed that, Lord Hartington “made no secret of his love for her” but in the end their affair was mentioned in the papers (albeit in the form of coy blind items) and coupled with the weight of disapproval from the highest echelons of society, the affair ended, but he made sure that she was well provided for. Catherine for her part, left for France, only returning to Britain once memories of the affair had faded, and her discretion was rewarded by the Cavendish family who carried on forwarding the annual sum promised to her until her own death in 1920.\n\nThe main driving force behind the ball was Louise Duchess of Devonshire. Known as the “Double Duchess” because until only a few years before, she had been Duchess of Manchester. Born Louise von Alten, she was the daughter of a German count and in 1852 had married William Drogo Montagu Viscount Mandeville, heir to the Duke of Manchester. Three years later they became Duke and Duchess of Manchester. Beginning in the 1860s, she began an affair with Lord Hartington with the full connivance of her husband; their affair followed the usual pattern, it began long after she had provided her husband with the requisite sons to carry on the family line and was conducted discreetly among the whirl of dinners, balls, teas and shooting parties. Louise also maintained her dignity even when Hartington had other women and she never allowed her affair to threaten her own relationship with her husband. Such behaviour today would be seen as hypocritical but they scrupulously observed the rules governing their class and so long as those rules were observed there was no scandal and everything went smoothly.\n\nLouise quickly assimilated into her adopted country and through her entertaining advanced the political careers of both husbands. Although all her life she identified with her first husband’s political party, the Conservatives, her circle of friends and acquaintances was politically diverse. She didn’t hesitate to ensure that her dinners and balls were filled with leading politicians, regardless of their political affiliations and persuasion; her objective was that her home should be a meeting place for politicians of all stripes where they could talk in a more relaxed atmosphere away from the pressures of Westminster. Above all, she wanted to be surrounded by people who were interesting and who she liked and to ensure that they had a good time.\n\nShe also gained a reputation for being a skilled political hostess who became a sounding board for leading politicians and statesmen, and although she was dismayed that the 8th Duke of Devonshire three times turned down the opportunity to become Prime Minister, his status and wealth as well as his ability meant that Louise could entertain in style and befitting their position in the social and political life of the country. Louise’s marriage to the 8th duke which finally happened in 1891 meant that her position was more secure. As Duchess of Devonshire, she was chatelaine of seven houses (Chatsworth, Devonshire House, Bolton Abbey, Lismore Castle, Hardwick Hall, Chiswick House, Compton Place) and had large funds at her disposal which meant that she had a wider scope for her social talents. Esther Simon Shkolink in her study of late Victorian and Edwardian political wives noted that contemporary accounts were more or less unanimous in their praise of Louise’s entertaining with her “charm and attentiveness as a hostess but also her careful attention to detail.” Her guest list was always eclectic and came from different political parties and social classes as the Devonshire House Ball would later demonstrate.\n\nThe Devonshire House Ball in honour of Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee was part and parcel of Louise’s pattern of entertaining. She and the Duke were fond of horse racing and annually held a dinner and a ball during and after Derby Day, regularly entertained the Prince and Princess of Wales (later King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra) and gave lavish parties for special occasions, but the Diamond Jubilee gave Louise the idea to push the boat out – throw a ball but with a twist in the form of a fancy dress party.\n\nFancy dress balls had been a fixture at least since the sixteenth century; costumed masked balls were popular in Italy, particularly Venice, from where they spread to the rest of Europe. During the eighteenth century, they became popular at the various royal courts, especially in France, while in Britain costume masked balls were ticketed events held in pleasure gardens and assembly halls in major cities such as London and Bath. In these balls, attendees would usually be cloaked and masked (either with one covering half their face or one trimmed with silk or lace to cover the whole face) or dressed as characters from the past or from popular entertainment such as the commedia dell’arte. In the nineteenth century, theme balls became popular – Queen Victoria and Prince Albert threw three lavish themed costume balls during the 1840s and 1850s. The first was a medieval ball where the hosts and their guests were dressed in the style of the court of King Edward III; the second featured a Georgian theme while the last, held in 1851 had the court of Charles II as the subject. As Queen Victoria withdrew from social life following the death of Prince Albert, the mantle of royal entertaining passed onto her oldest son the Prince of Wales and his wife Alexandra, and during the 1870s they hosted a lavish costume ball at their London home Marlborough House which was heralded as a success and ensured the continued popularity of such events.\n\nFor her own ball, Louise decided that the theme would be “court or allegorical costumes before 1815” and as a later Duchess of Devonshire, Deborah mused in an article she wrote:\n\n“It was not difficult for Louise Duchess to mobilise her female guests – they can have had little else to do but arrange themselves for such an occasion and one can easily picture the excitement and pleasure it gave. But even clever old Louise must have been surprised at managing to persuade a lot of middle-aged men to order their costumes and suffer the tedium of trying them on.”\n\nFortunately help was at hand. Due to the popularity of fancy dress balls, there was a plethora of books and specialist hire shops on hand to offer advice. One such book was entitled Fancy Dress Described or What to Wear at Fancy Balls by Ardern Holt and it went through several editions. It gave descriptions of the most popular costumes which ranged from historical personalities to characters from fiction, myth and legend down to allegorical and national costumes from various parts of the world. In addition, the book also gave recommendations of what costumes would suit a particular hair colour, skin complexion and age.\n\nThe ball was eagerly anticipated and as Sophia Murphy observed that “[a]n invitation to the fancy dress ball confirmed membership of the ‘smart set’, and was therefore much sought after. Apart from this, everyone was eager to witness what promised to be one of the most lavish spectacles of the century; since it was the main subject of interest that season, everyone wanted to have the fun of trying to keep their outfits a secret while at the same time trying to discover what the others were wearing.” Many of the guests came together as a group and organise a procession and in the end five main groups or courts were organised: Elizabeth I of England which was led by Lady Tweedmouth; Maria Theresa of Austria under the Marchioness of Londonderry; Queen Guinevere & the Knights of the Round Table led by Lady Ormonde (she ended up being unable to attend due to bereavement so Lord and Lady Rodney went as King Arthur and Queen Guinevere); Louis XV & Louis XVI of France under Lady Warwick (as Marie Antoinette) and the court of Catherine the Great of Russia led by Lady Raincliffe.\n\nThree other groups more loosely defined were categorised by the costumes they were wearing such as the Italian, Oriental and Allegorical. Many other guests however decided not to join any group or procession as they went in an assortment of costumes ranging from their ancestors to those modelled from famous paintings or historical figures that did not fit into any of the groups or courts organised. With her customary attention to detail and zeal, Louise planned everything down to the last detail and even the servants on duty were in costume – the men were dressed in in Devonshire livery from the 18th century while the female staff were dressed in costumes from the Elizabethan period. Due to the large number of guests, it was necessary to hire outside staff for the night and Louise had them dressed in either Egyptian or Elizabethan dress.\n\nOn the night of the ball, the guests were greeted by Louise herself and her costume was described by The Times in great detail:\n\n“The Duchess of Devonshire, as Zenobia, Queen of Palmyra, wore a magnificent costume. The skirt of gold tissue was embroidered all over in a star-like design in emeralds, sapphires, diamonds, and other jewels outlined with gold, the corners where it opened in front being elaborately wrought in the same jewels and gold to represent peacocks outspread tails. This opened to show an underdress of cream crepe de chine, delicately embroidered in silver, gold, and pearls and sprinkled all over with diamonds. The train, which was attached to the shoulders by two slender points and was fastened at the waist with a large diamond ornament, was a green velvet of a lovely shade, and was superbly embroidered in Oriental designs introducing the lotus flower in rubies, sapphires, amethysts, emeralds, and diamonds, with four borderings on contrasting grounds, separated with gold cord. The train was lined with turquoise satin. The bodice was composed of gold tissue to match the skirt, and the front was of crepe de chine hidden with a stomacher of real diamonds, rubies and emeralds and jewelled belt. A gold crown incrusted (sic) with emeralds, diamonds, and rubies, with a diamond drop at each curved end and two upstanding white ostrich feathers in the middle, and round the front festoons of pearls with a large pear shaped pearl in the centre falling on the forehead.”\n\nOne of the guests Margot Asquith (wife of the future Prime Minister Herbert Asquith) expressed surprise at her host’s choice of costume. For her, Zenobia evoked beauty and romance but Louise in her view was neither. In her youth, Louise was known and praised for her beauty but as she grew older, her looks faded while her features became coarse and her figure grew rounder. As Duchess Deborah wrote: “The ‘Double Duchess’ was considered a great beauty, though with her frizzed up hair and short, thick neck it is hard to recognise her beauty in most of the likenesses we have of her. The people I have talked to who saw her only remember the crazily cracked make-up plastered thickly over her face, which made a bizarre effect on this grande dame receiving at the top of the staircase at Devonshire House.” Her costume was designed by the House of Worth and such was the skills of that venerable fashion house that they managed to make Louise a stately and imposing Queen of Palmyra rather than fat and coarse.\n\nThe Duke of Devonshire was dressed as the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V based on his portrait by Titian and keeping up with his modest tastes, the Duke’s costume was simple and the only adornment was the badge of the Order of the Golden Fleece which had been lent to him by the Prince of Wales for the evening and which the duke wore around his neck.\n\nAmong the guests were Lady Randolph Churchill (nee Jennie Jerome) as the Empress Theodora, Mrs Arthur (Minnie) Paget went as Cleopatra, the Duchess of Sutherland was costumed as Jane Seymour, the former Prime Minister the 6th Earl of Rosebery who was dressed as a gentleman from the 18th century (he wasn’t amused when some of the papers said that he was costumed as Horace Walpole), Lord Rownton who went as an archbishop and Arthur Balfour (future Prime Minister) as a Dutch gentleman. The Cavendish family meanwhile was represented by the Duke’s nephew and heir Victor who was costumed as Jean de Dinteville from Hans Holbein’s The Ambassadors while his wife Evelyn went as a lady from the court of Maria Theresa. Consuelo Duchess of Manchester, Louise’s daughter-in-law from her first marriage went as Anne of Austria “in a very striking gown of white and silver satin, decorated with swags of gold satin. On her head she wore a diamond crown with a large single pearl ornament in the centre of her forehead.”\n\nAs the ball was in honour of Queen Victoria (who did not attend), she was amply represented by members of her family. The Prince and Princess of Wales (who were costumed as a Grand Prior of the Order of St John of Jerusalem and Marguerite de Valois respectively) together with their children and in-laws attended as well as the Duke and Duchess of Teck and Prince Alfred of Edinburgh and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Foreign diplomats such as the Portuguese ambassador the Marquis de Soveral (a close friend of the Prince of Wales) and the Austrian ambassador Count Albert Mensdorff were also present and it’s no wonder that with such a guest list, the Devonshire House Ball was seen as the event of the 1897 London Season.\n\noooOOOooo\n\nMany guests did take much time and effort with their costumes. It was said that one guest who wore an Oriental dress wanted to make an entrance via an elephant and enquired London Zoo about the possibility of borrowing one. The zoo authorities however refused on the grounds that the elephant would be unable to cope with the crowds and traffic of London. One can simply conclude that she made her entrance via the usual horse and carriage. Others in their desire for accuracy and to stand out suffered through the evening with uncomfortable headdresses and props – such as the Hon Mrs Reginald Talbot who went as a Valkyrie and who developed a headache due to the metal winged helmet she was wearing but refused to take it off as it might ruin her hairdo. There was the Countess of Westmoreland costumed as Hebe cupbearer of the gods who was restricted with her movements the entire evening due to the huge stuffed eagle on her shoulder: while Lady Wolverton who attended as Britannia would have had to contend with not only a feathered helmet but also a triton and shield.\n\nWhile some male guests such as Herbert Asquith went to the ball grudgingly and made little effort with their costumes, others threw themselves wholeheartedly into the spirit of wearing fancy dress sometimes with even more enthusiasm than their wives. One of the most expensive costumes was worn by the 9th duke of Marlborough who went as the French Ambassador in one of the courts. It was made by House of Worth, a confection of velvet embroidered in silver, pearls and diamonds with a waistcoat made out of white and gold damask. The whole costume was mostly embroidered by hand as well as the pearls and diamonds and cost 5,000 francs. As Jean Philippe Worth later recalled, even he was shocked by the bill as he presented it to the duke.\n\nOutwardly the ball can be seen as the pinnacle of aristocratic dominance both in the political and social scene but in reality, the ball reflected the gradual changes happening in society. It was observed that society was “less clearly defined than it had been twenty years before” and the guest list reflected Louise’s wide circle of friends and acquaintances that crossed the political divide. More crucial however was the presence of men and women whose origins and occupation would have barred them from other aristocratic homes but who were invited to the Devonshire House ball while most of the aristocratic old guard were not. Examples of these were Ernest Cassel and Alfred Beit both of whom were Jewish and were in banking; the Earl of Iveagh and Lord Rothschild both of whom made their fortunes in commerce and finance; the actor Sir Henry Irving and the American born singer Mrs Ronalds who appropriately came as Euterpe, “the Spirit of Music” in a costume decorated with the musical score from Verdi’s opera Un Ballo in Maschera.\n\nThe ball in 1897 was the last major event held in Devonshire House and with the 8th Duke’s death in 1908 followed by Louise three years later marked the end of an era for the Devonshires. The 9th duke was faced with crippling death duties from his predecessor’s estate as well as debts from the 7th duke’s failed investments. In order to economise, the 9th duke accepted the position of Governor-General of Canada where he served from 1916 to 1922. While in Canada, negotiations for the sale of Devonshire House had begun and it was finally sold in 1920. Not long after the house was demolished and an office block now stands in its place.\n\nThe sale of Devonshire House showed that following the end of the First World War not even the grandest and wealthiest of the aristocracy were immune from the changes sweeping through the aristocracy as well as feeling the financial pinch. In the years following the sale and demolition of Devonshire House, other aristocratic townhouses were sold to be demolished, converted into office spaces or museums. At the same time, aristocratic entertaining also changed – many in the aristocracy could no longer afford to entertain on the same scale as their predecessors and balls and dinners were ceasing to become extensions of cabinet meetings and parliamentary sessions. The Devonshire House Ball of 1897 would certainly be the last of its kind and one that would never be repeated.\n\nNote:\n\nPhotos from the House Style exhibition at Chatsworth House taken by blogger\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nDeborah (Cavendish) Duchess of Devonshire.

Whilst today there is social media, forums and blogs that are devoted to the clothes worn by the Duchess of Cambridge, the Countess of Wessex and even the Queen herself, interest in the fashions worn by royalty has been around since before the age of the internet and mass media. During the 1950s, Princess Margaret could command enormous press attention for her clothes which as one newspaper breathlessly proclaimed that “what she wears is news”.\n\nAlthough royalty is not expected to be fashionable, the clothes that they wear are highly important. They should be visible enough to the greatest number of people as possible and allow them to stand out from among the crowds. Their clothes should take into account the occasion, the climate and who their audience will be. Accessories are also very important – hats should not obscure the face; bags and sleeves should not get in the way of shaking hands and shoes should be taken into account for the hours of standing and walking. Colours are equally or more so, very crucial as they can send out messages that can have more impact than words.\n\nCurrently, the Royal Collection Trust is presenting an exhibition of the clothes of Queen Elizabeth II spread across three royal residences to celebrate her 90th birthday. In this blog, we shall be looking at the sartorial choices of her predecessors and how they have made their own mark though their choices in clothing and style.\n\nQueen Victoria (1870-1901)\n\nBy the 1870s, Queen Victoria’s image as a grieving widow was one that the public had been accustomed to. It was also during this decade that she was beginning to emerge from her seclusion and her look was reflecting the prevailing mourning custom then of the transition from deepest or first mourning towards the second stage – crape by this point was less used and she began to wear dresses in black silk.\n\nAlthough she would time and again return to crape for the deaths of other family members and relations, it was by this point that our enduring image of Queen Victoria began to take shape. Photographs, prints and portraits of her depicted her as a stout woman in a black silk dress or black with touches of white, with her white widow’s cap atop her head and simple jewellery in pearls and diamonds apart from jet.\n\nEven for state occasions such as the state opening of Parliament, Queen Victoria refused to don the state crown and robe of state. Instead she continued to wear her widow’s cap and a simple dress in black and white but as a concession to the formality of the occasion would wear a small diamond crown (made for her by Garrard’s in 1870 and now on display at the Tower of London) which was lighter, fitted well atop her widow’s cap and provided both a compromise for the need of something suitably grand for a state occasion and appropriate for mourning. The sash and star of the Order of the Garter was her only concession to colour.\n\nThe same was true with her official photographs and portraits where again she would be depicted in a black silk dress trimmed with white lace, the small diamond crown atop her widow’s cap, the sash and star of the Order of the Garter across her chest and wearing pearl and diamond jewellery. An official portrait of the Queen by Heinrich von Angeli completed in 1875 depicted her wearing a double strand pearl necklace, pearl earrings, small pearl brooch and a pearl bracelet with a miniature portrait of Prince Albert. As pearls were appropriate for mourning, the symbolism of the jewels she was wearing for this portrait was not lost on the public as pearls symbolised “tears” and spoke of her continuing sadness over the loss of her beloved husband.\n\nFrom the 1880s onwards, Queen Victoria’s dresses were more aligned with the third stage of mourning where ribbo"
