        "text": "As you a native German, did you understand all, what she said? Because I thought I am pretty good in German, but I didn't understand her every time. But IMO, she spoke very good, it takes time as long as somebody so good speaks, so I think she took a few german-lesson before it. Or she took some weeks or months to learn only this speech. Very impressive.\n\nI understood her really well. There were only some words that I didn't get immediately but in connection with the whole sentence I understood it.\n\nAs somebody who doesn't speak the language at all it is really impressive and a beautiful gesture!!\n\nI remember that also Haakon held a speech in German when they were in Germany.\n\nFound it: The Crown Prince and Crown Princess in Germany - YouTube\n\nI saw an interview with Princess Grace on YouTube. She said she spoke to her children in English, Prince Rainier spoke to them in French, and they would speak to each other in French. I saw Prince Albert's from his wedding and he most definitely sounds American when he speaks English. I think Princess Stephanie does as well. Princess Caroline has more of a British accent .\n\nI have seen Princess Mathilde speaking English with a French accent\n\nQueen Paola has an Italian accent (no surprise ) and King Albert also had a French accent when speaking English.\n\nI doubt the Duchess of Cambridge has a working knowledge of Italian. 3 months is not enough time to learn a language and not to mention her stay at Italy was such a long time ago that whatever Italian she may have learned she probably forgot about it already.\n\nI didn't say fluent I said working knowledge - she spent half a day every day in italian lessons - that should give her a working knowledge. I am not fluent in French but when I go thereto France each year I can generally understand and converse within a couple of days. She needed to learn as part of her Art History course in Italy.\n\nBut hey, if we disagree, we disagree.\n\nI saw a doku about CP Victoria, and there was some scenes about her wedding-preparations. There was a very sweet moment when she explained something to the Princesses Ingrid-Alexandra and Catharina-Amalia in English. So I think they speak also English with eachother.\n\nAnd here is the video (it is german, by 8'50), there is said, that Princess Ingrid-Alexandra learned english, so she can speak with Catharina-Amalia):\n\nZDF-Royal: Die kleinen Königinnen kommen (2/3) - YouTube\n\nWhen she was a baby and toddler she live for a few years in Jordan. Arabic was Catherine first language. I don't think she speak it now (with the lost of practice you can lose fluency or knowledge of a language)\n\nI doubt that Arabic was her first language just because she lived there. For that to be the case her parents would have had to be using that language to her all the time as well and I really don't see them doing that.\n\nLiving in a country doesn't mean that you learn that language.\n\nYour first language will be the one that your family use around you all the time.\n\nIf her parents were using Arabic around her when living there then they would presumably have continued to use that language but as the evidence suggests that she is no longer able to speak the language which suggests again that she wasn't exposed to it all that much and certainly not enough to call it a first language.\n\nFinally I came across a video of Crown Princess Victoria speaking German more than two words\n\nThe kids are singing a funny version of the \"Happy birthday\" song, and she replies that she has never heard this before. Her German sounds so good that I am wondering why she didn't make any speeches in German when she came here in 2011!\n\nThat video is hilarious,she is speaking without accent-wow!She has a talent for languages and certainly her mother tought her a lot.The song is funny too,translated the rhyme would mean \"Happy Birthday to you,Happy Birthday to you,marmelade(jam) in the shoes,apricots in the trousers,Happy birthday to you\" *lol*\n\nI doubt that Arabic was her first language just because she lived there. For that to be the case her parents would have had to be using that language to her all the time as well and I really don't see them doing that.\n\nLiving in a country doesn't mean that you learn that language.\n\nYour first language will be the one that your family use around you all the time.\n\nIf her parents were using Arabic around her when living there then they would presumably have continued to use that language but as the evidence suggests that she is no longer able to speak the language which suggests again that she wasn't exposed to it all that much and certainly not enough to call it a first language.\n\nI think miche wanted to say Arabic was her first foreign language-we say that the language spoken by our family is our mother tongue and than you have a first,second,third...language from another country.\n\nAlso, some (I know Americans have this tendency and I believe the French do too) tend to feel that a person cannot really speak their language if they have a thick foreign accent even if they can understand everything the person says and can be understood by them. While others are more forgiving. And a good or even great accent accent actually can little to do with true fluency!\n\nI have to agree that it seems that many Americans might seem to feel that way!\n\nI however am not one of them as I have so much respect for anyone who takes the time to learn a language or even \"tests the waters\" while attempting to learn another language! It is not easy to do so -English is a hard language (from what friends who speak it as a second language tell me) to learn. I have so much respect for others as I myself struggle to learn languages due to hearing problems... So I am always in awe of those who can speak more than one language, let alone four or five.\n\nPrincess Anne speaks French; she took it at boarding school and the summer she turned 19.\n\nQueen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh, as reported here, speak French very well. Their children, Charles, Anne, Andrew and Edward all speak, at the very least, passable French.\n\nThis is because of the BRFs (includes the Queen Mother) strong ties to Canada - which has 2 official languages, English and French.\n\nIt's likely that the Queen has 'strongly encouraged' all of her grandchildren to have a real grounding in French as well - William spoke it passably during the 2011 tour of Canada. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fs2YfA1D4ns\n\nWith Charles and Anne the fact that they speak French has nothing to do with the association with Canada but the fact that at the time they were at school all well-educated children learnt French. Andrew also certainly studied French at school.\n\nI had a friend, in the mid-70s, who spent the first three years of her high school life at school in the UK and she told us that French was a compulsory subject in English schools at the time - she had been studying it for 7 years when she arrived to join us who had been studying it only for 2 and she was probably better than our teacher in many ways. As the Queen's children overlaps mine due to me being agewise between Anne and Andrew I believe that they would have studied it at school because they had to do so.\n\nQueen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh, as reported here, speak French very well.

The decision to learn French prior to then amongst both Canadians and the BRF was not mandatory, nor necessarily a concession to French Canadians.\n\nThe BRF's French language skills are more likely owing to the fact that French was a traditional language to learn for the upper classes.\n\nCanada has only officially been bilingual since 1982.

First paragraph here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Languages_Act_(Canada)\n\nAnd nowhere in my previous post did I say that speaking French was a concession to French Canadians or mandated by anyone in the BRF. I stated only that the Queen's children speak French and that French language skills were likely \"strongly encouraged\" by the Queen."
