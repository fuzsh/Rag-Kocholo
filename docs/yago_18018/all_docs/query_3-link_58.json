        "text": "There are several similarities between the lives of Empress-Queen Elisabeth of Austria and Diana, Princess of Wales, and people like to recognise this. Now I would like to show these similarities and that how two fairy tales ended with tragedy. Elisabeth is being called “the 19th century Lady Diana” by lots of people, actually I don’t like to use this term, but I understand why this is being used. Based on that Diana could be “the 20th century Empress Elisabeth”, couldn’t she?\n\nPrincess Diana tragically died in a car crash at the age of 36. If in August 1997 this tragedy had not happened, then the Princess of Wales would celebrate her 59th birthday today.\n\nIn front of the public from a very young age\n\nDiana Frances Spencer was born on 1 July 1961 in Sandringham, England, in a buildig called Park House, which her parents rented from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. The family of Diana, which was founded in the 15th century, is the part of the British aristocracy. There were some famous or well-known people from the Spencers, for example Sir Winston Churchill, who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\nDiana Spencer had four siblings, but one of them, a boy called John, died on the day when he was born. Elisabeth Amalie Eugenie von Wittelsbach, who was welcomed to the world on 24 December 1837, had two brothers who died as babies, and she couldn’t meet the older one, just like Diana, who also didn’t have the chance to meet his older brother.\n\nJust like the parents of Sisi, Viscount and Viscountess Althorp didn’t live happily together. From 1967 Diana lived together with her mother, Frances Shand Kydd (her mother was called like this, she used her second husband’s name), but her father, Edward John Spencer, won custody of his children. The Viscount and Viscountess finally divorced in 1969.\n\nUpon the death of his father, Edward Spencer became the 8th Earl Spencer, and from that time Diana was called Lady Diana, she was titled as a daughter of an earl. Earl Spencer and his family moved to Althorp, which was a residency of the family.\n\nBut not only Diana had a connection with Althorp. While she was hunting in England, Empress Elisabeth met the 5th Earl Spencer, who was the half-brother of Diana’s great-grandfather. Elisabeth gave a portrait of herself as a gift to the earl. The painting, which is still in Althorp, shows the Empress horse-riding.\n\nDestiny wanted to make the married lives of Diana and Elisabeth similar. Diana met her future husband, Prince Charles, Prince of Wales at the age of 16, while the prince was dating with Diana’s older sister, Sarah. As we know, Elisabeth married Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria instead of her sister, Helene, who was supposed to be the wife of the Emperor. These sisters…\n\nDiana and Charles started dating in 1980, and Charles asked her to marry him soon. Their engagement was announced in February 1981, and a few months later, on 29 July they got married in a fairy tale wedding. Nearly 750 million people watched the ceremony.\n\nBoth Sisi and Diana were young when they got married and gave birth to their eldest child. Elisabeth was 16, when she married Franz Joseph, and she welcomed her first child at the age of 17. Diana was a little bit older, she was 20 at the time of her wedding and 21 when she gave birth for the first time.\n\nWe can say that both the marriages of Diana and Sisi didn’t belong to the happiest ones, although they married by love. “Whatever love means” – as Prince Charles said.\n\nInstead of a fairy tale…\n\nLuxurious palaces, beautiful jewellery and a loving husband, who is a prince, or an emperor… Sounds like a fairy tale, but unfortunatelly I would not call the stories of Diana or Sisi a fairy tale. But now I would like to show a difference between their lives. I have read so many things about the relationship of Elisabeth and Franz Joseph, and I guess I can think that they loved each other, although Sisi was not in love with her husband during her whole life. Franz Joseph had several lovers, but the first and most important woman in his heart was always his wife. Unfortunately we can not say this about Prince Charles. But it’s true that he never let the love of his life away. Just actually this woman was not Diana, but Camilla Shand, who met the prince in the 1970s. That lady, who was known as Camilla Parker Bowles, married Charles in 2005 and since the wedding she is the Duchess of Cornwall (she does not use the title Princess of Wales because of the memory of Diana). “There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded” – said Diana.\n\nFrom the marriage of Diana and Charles, which was full of quarrels and jealousy, another boy named Henry (but everybody calls him Harry) was born on 15 September 1984.\n\nEverybody sees Diana as a victim, and Charles as a guilty guy, since he cheated on his wife, but Lady Di wasn’t innocent either. The Princess also had lovers, even though she said that she loved her husband. Now here is another difference: although there were and are rumours about it, Elisabeth never cheated on his imperial-royal husband.\n\nNeither Diana nor Elisabeth were the favourites of the court. They did not have a great relationship with their mother-in-laws (Queen Elizabeth II and Archduchess Sophie of Austria), but the nation loved them. Diana became the “Queen of Hearts”, and Elisabeth, although sometimes she was not the favourite of the Viennese people, was a beloved Queen of Hungary.\n\nTheir relationships with their children were also different. Diana lived for her boys, but Sisi didn’t manage to make a great relationship with her children, just with the youngest Marie Valerie.\n\n“From day one, I always knew I would never be the next Queen” – said Diana\n\nEmperor Franz Joseph and Empress Elisabeth didn’t have the chance of getting divoreced, since a catholic monarch cannot leave his wife. But Diana and Charles, who lived in the next century, could divorce. Their marriage was in ruins, and they announced that they sepparated in 1992, but divorced only in 1996. After Diana talked about her feelings in an interview in November 1995 The Queen asked her son and daughter-in-law to divorce. Finally they got divorced on 28 August 1996. Diana didn’t loose her titles, but from that time the people could not call her “Her Royal Highness”. The young Prince William, who was one of the closest condfidants of his mother, and who was her male version (according to Diana), told her mother: “Don’t worry, Mummy, I will give it back to you one day when I am king.”\n\nFairy tales without happy ends\n\nDiana, who was single from that time, still did a lot of charity work, but she wanted someone next to her who really loves her. In summer 1997 she accepted the invitation from Mohamed Al-Fayed, a rich man from Egypt, and joined him with her sons on his yacht called Jonikal. Here she met the son of the businessman, Dodi Fayed, who worked as a film producer earlier, and they fell in love. But unfortunately their relationship wasn’t a long one. On 30 August 1997 the couple stayed at Hotel Ritz in Paris, which is owned by Al-Fayed, and even though lots of photographers waited for them outside, they left the hotel. The photographers started chasing them. The driver of Diana and Dodi’s car sped up, and they blundered into a pillar of Pont de l’Alma tunnel. The driver was drunk and those who sat in the car didn’t fasten the seatbelt, although Diana always checked this. The only person who did fasten his seatbelt was a bodyquard called Trevor Rees-Jones, he was the only one who didn’t loose his life that night. The driver and Fayed died at the place of the car crash, Diana was taken to hospital where she died during an operation. This actually happened on the next day, on 31 August.\n\nDiana, who wasn’t afraid of hugging people with HIV, who was the fashion icon of her time, was mourned by her ex-husband, her sons, her family and a whole nation. Millions of people watched her funeral.\n\nA little bit more than one hundred years earlier, on 10 September 1898 Empress Elisabeth and her lady-in-waiting, Countess Irma Sztáray were to leave Geneva, and when they were on their way to the port, an Italian anarchist, Luigi Lucheni stabbed the 60-year-old Empress with a hand-made dagger. Elisabeth thought that he only wanted to steal her clock, and she continued her way. On the ship she didn’t feel good, and when Irma took off her corset, she realised that Elisabeth was injured. The Empress was taken back to Hotel Beau-Rivage, where she died after 2 o’clock pm. There are peple who say that maybe her life could have been saved with modern equipment. The Empress of Austria-Hungary left this world. “I wish my soul would fly into the sky through a little hole in my heart.” – said Elisabeth one day before her death.\n\nElisabeth’s body was taken back to Vienna. “No one will ever know how much I loved this woman.” – said Franz Joseph after he got the news of the death of her beloved wife.\n\nBoth the lives of the 19th century Diana and the 20th century Sisi had an impact on the after-ages. Neither of them became forgotten, and maybe people will never forget them. Diana became “Queen of Hearts”, and Elisabeth is loved as well. Films and books were created about them, and with the help of these they still live in our hearts. I am sure that millions of people will think about Diana on her birthday today, and she, and obviously Elisabeth, just as I mentioned, will never be forgotten."
