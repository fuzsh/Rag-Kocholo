So far I've seen a Rhea, Meadow, Ares, Marguerite, Violet Orion and Wren Eleanor! Almandine - Are you watching the new American Horror Story ? It's going to have two different stories with four episodes devoted to each. In this first one the main characters have a daughter named Almandine who they call Alma! Dove Orion - On Instagram there is an absolutely precious baby named Dove Orion. It would seem that Orion is becoming a popular middle for girls!\n\nOn My Mind: 8-22-21\n\nStarloe - While watching Good Morning America I noticed a really interesting name! They had a segment featuring different teachers and one of them was Starloe Galleta from Florida. In a world of Harlows, could Starloe, or even Starlow, be the next big thing? Evanora - I recently finished Auralee Wallace's first book in her newest series about a family of witches that run a B&B and happen to get caught up in some mysteries. One of her aunts is called Nora, but her full name is Evanora! I thought that was really pretty, and perfectly witchy. Evanora has another magical connection -- it's the Wicked Witch of the West's name in Oz the Great and Powerful . In the Company of Witches comes out October 5th, and will be a wonderful choice for all your Halloween needs! Riva - I just finished one of my most coveted books of 2021 -- Sistersong (read my review here !) by Lucy Holland. The eldest sister is named Riva, which I've always been partial to. Riva is a diminutive o\n\nThe Children of Princess Henriette of Orléans, Duchess of Vendôme\n\nPrincess Henriette of Orléans, Duchess of Vendôme Princess Henriette of Orléans, Duchess of Vendôme was born Henriëtte Maria Charlotte Antonia of Belgium to Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders and Princess Marie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen .

I can't really say what caused me to stop writing them, but I would love to get back to it! So for my first new one, I've chosen the beautiful Mary Astor. Born on May 3rd, 1906 as Lucile Vasconcellos Langhanke to a father who immigrated from Germany and an American mother, Mary's first foray into film was when she auditioned for Lillian Gish, who was so enamored of her recitation of Shakespeare that she shot a thousand feet of Astor. She went on to make her film debut at the tender age of fourteen in Sentimental Tommy , but her small scene ended up being cut.
