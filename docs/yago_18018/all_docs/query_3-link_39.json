In 1839 he moved to Munich to study painting. He also spent time in Paris from 1845, before eventually settling in Berlin in 1860, to begin his career. Lauchert was employed as a portrait painter by the courts of England, Germany and Russia. He was court painter to Prince Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst and, in 1857, married the Prince’s sister, Princess Amalie of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst, in Hersleben, Germany. At Christmas in 1858, he died of a heart attack in Berlin, aged just 44.\n\nSamuel Cousins was a well known mezzotint engraver of portraits and decorative subjects after his contemporaries and 18th-century British artists. Born in Exeter, he was the pupil of, and assistant to, the engraver S. W. Reynolds. Cousins set up his own business in London in 1825 and would later become the first engraver to be elected a Royal Academician. He engraved plates after the foremost artists of his day including Sir Edwin Henry Landseer (1802-1873), Sir John Everett Millais (1829-1896) and Franz Xaver Winterhalter (1805-1873). His younger brother Henry Cousins (c.1809-1864) was also a mezzotint engraver.\n\nExplore\n\nDetails\n\nTitle\n\nAlexandra of Denmark (1844-1925) Queen Consort of King Edward VII, as Princess of Wales\n\nDate\n\nMedium\n\nMezzotint\n\nAcquisition\n\nPresented by Sir David Scott, March 1957\n\nProvenance\n\nGiven by Edward Prince of Wales to Captain Charles Scott, 1879; gven to Ministry of Works by Sir David Scott, 1957\n\nGAC number\n\n3778"
