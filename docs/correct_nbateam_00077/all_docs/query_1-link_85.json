        "text": "OBVIOUSLY, after warning in the playoff preview the Warriors were the worst imaginable matchup for the Mavericks, I can’t be vaguely surprised Golden State is providing such legit comp. What’s shocking is Dallas’ utter emotional destabilization and failure to compete. Never has a team that’s won so many games (67) surrendered so unconditionally (Game 3) and decomposed so rapidly from jump street.\n\nSomehow you’d expect a little more aplomb from players who endured the crucible of crisis in last June’s Finals.\n\nThe Warriors should be brought up on charges of identity theft; the Mavs’ minds are messed up, cuz. Heads are hanging. Eyes are glazed. Feet are frozen. Focus is adrift. They’re folding to pressure on the free-throw line long before the shots become must makes. Nobody scored a single point Friday that remotely mattered, that’s how quickly Dallas was out of it.\n\nMeanwhile, the Warriors are running a full-court layup line. Mav-wrecks are allowing opponents to beat them down court and off the dribble. Effortlessly! Off half-court sets, no less! How can you let your man blow by continually when you know your “Help!” isn’t quick enough to react!?\n\nWhere’s the Mavs’ energy? Where’s the rage? Where’s the pride? Where’s the basketball HiQ? They say they hate losing. Prove it! The most anger they showed Friday was directed at the refs.\n\nYesterday, Avery Johnson had his players studying film early in the a.m. before going to practice for three hours. You didn’t have to be there to know the No. 1 topic of conversation was transition defense. In order to regain their confidence and take control of the series (yes, one lousy win in Oakland might be enough to do it) it’s imperative for the Mavs to retard the pace today and slice the Warriors’ fast-break points roughly in half from an indefensible 40 in Game 3.\n\nHow is that done? Open up the middle and honor spacing. Attack off pick-and-rolls and pull up for simple springers instead of risking charges. Set picks to free scorers and get to the welfare line like in Game 2.\n\nI know, easy for me to write. Especially in view of the Warriors’ wealth of matchup advantages. It bears repeating (slower this time so maybe even Charles Barkley and Kenny Smith can comprehend the extent of the problem), if the Mavs start either Erick Dampier or Desagana Diop then Dirk Nowitzki must cover Jason Richardson or Stephon Jackson or Monta Ellis. If the Mavs start a center, Baron Davis can’t be guarded or halfway trapped due to Dallas’ bulkiness and sluggish feet.\n\nLet’s pause for a second and recognize greatness. Next to Jason Kidd and Steve Nash, nobody delivers the ball better than the Baron of Basketball. And he has more viable targets than either of those two. Except for Andris Biedrins, every deployed player by Don Nelson is capable of flushing a 3-pointer or making a play. And Biedrins, who catches everything, is excellent at finishing on the roll.\n\nYes, the Mavs can prevail, but make no mistake about it, no NBA team has more firepower than the Warriors. Yes, it can be neutralized. The Spurs have no trouble dealing with the Warriors due to Tim Duncan’s inside presence. The Mavs don’t have a center who can even catch-and-score once and a while. That means Nowitzki must play out of position on the low post, but that doesn’t work, either. The Warriors’ center simply plays behind Nowitzki and someone else can front him, making it next to impossible for him to get the ball or any maneuvering room. At 15 feet, they grab, hold and push him out further. They attack Jerry Stackhouse and Josh Howard the same way in the post and outside.\n\nNash’s playmaking mentality might’ve come in handy in this series, I’m guessing. The Mavs are desperate for authentic floor leadership and point-guard skills. No offense to Jason Terry’s all-around quality, but he falls into the category of “What’s the point?”\n\nAmazingly, for three years, the Mavs’ imperfect storm has managed to conceal its darkest weaknesses: counterfeit caretaker and center cavity. That, my friends, is why Nowitzki deserved MVP last season and is favored to win it this season.\n\nWho would’ve thought, on this second Sunday of the second season, both of last season’s NBA finalists would be squirming like the 5-year-old who invariably sits next to me for hours on the JetBlue tarmac?\n\nShould the Mavs and Heat (barring a Red Sox-Yankees type revival) go down in the first round, I’m going to take a wild stab and claim it’d be the first time in league history the previous two finalists, given they qualified for the playoffs, got zapped so suddenly.\n\nAnd you thought the NFL prided itself on parity!\n\nIt’s pretty sad it took the Lakers until Game 3 before they junked their home run trot back on defense.\n\nYou mean to tell me all this time Kobe & his non-supporting cast could’ve rotated their feet faster, bent their backs lower, loosened their choke chains and extended coverage out further to contest dribbles and shots?\n\nYou mean to tell me the Lakers are capable of sweating Nash and cutting off his passing angles. Truly able to badger the Suns’ carefree, spot-up shooters out of their sweet spots and into discomfort zones?\n\nWas it my imagination or did they really crash the offensive boards, patrol the perimeter with a purpose and protect the paint?\n\nTruth be told, L.A.’s 95-89 soul-searching win did more to impeach its integrity than the team’s mortifying loss in Game 2 and distressing performance over the last month.\n\nNow that we’ve seen the Lakers bust their butts to control the minutes of their meeting with the Suns of Fun, now that we know they’re prepared to run the triangle offense and share the ball (at least until Kobe decides to dominate it in the fourth quarter), all that stuff about injuries, inexperience and lack of camaraderie is nothing more than underachievers trying to bail themselves out with lame excuses.\n\nThe latest version of the Lakers was impressive. Like the new Tundra, we’ll see whether their condition is temporary or they’ve honestly had “the quit” knocked out of ’em.\n\nThat and, as column composer Alan Elliott notes, “Whether Kobe wants to win as part of a team, or try to win it by himself.”"
