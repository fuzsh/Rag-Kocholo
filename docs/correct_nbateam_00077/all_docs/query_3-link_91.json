        "text": "By Mike Cranston,\n\nAssociated Press\n\nCharlotte | Michael Jordan has a message for Charlotte's skeptical fans: the expansion Bobcats are through building and ready to become winners.\n\nShedding their label as a frugal franchise with a hardworking yet starless roster, the Bobcats shunned a group of young college players on draft night for a proven veteran scorer with a hefty contract.\n\nJordan, a part-owner with the final say on personnel moves, pulled the trigger Thursday night on a deal that brought in Jason Richardson from Golden State. Jordan is convinced Richardson - who will earn about $51 million over the next four seasons - is the missing go-to scorer that will put the Bobcats in the playoffs for the first time.\n\n\"I think we've got a great makeup and a chance to make noise in the East,\" Jordan said. \"That's what a Jason Richardson brings.\"\n\nA sense of urgency has surrounded the Bobcats since the offseason began. The day Sam Vincent was hired to replace Bernie Bickerstaff as coach, Vincent said he would be \"incredibly discouraged and disappointed\" if Charlotte didn't make the playoffs next season.\n\nStrong words for a team that won only 18, 26 and 33 games during its first three seasons. But the Bobcats feel they need to become a playoff team to win over fans who soured on the NBA five years ago, when the Hornets moved to New Orleans.\n\nIt's why the Bobcats were unwilling to wait for a young player to develop. On draft night, they sent the eighth pick - 19-year-old Brandan Wright of North Carolina - to the Warriors for Richardson.\n\nThe move might end the fan apathy, but it will be costly. On top of Richardson's big contract, the Bobcats are hoping to re-sign leading scorer Gerald Wallace, who could command about $10 million a year.\n\nThe Bobcats earned a reputation for thriftiness under owner Bob Johnson, but their league-low payroll will spike considerably.\n\n\"I don't know if Bob knows how much we spent,\" Jordan joked. \"We said from day one that if we could go out and find someone significant that would make our basketball team that much better, then we would do that.\"\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Richardson, who grew up a Jordan fan and wears his No. 23, provides the Bobcats with something they've never had: a late-game threat.\n\nThe 26-year-old swingman averaged more than 19 points a game in his six-year career, including 23.2 points a game in 2005-06. Richardson is a good 3-point shooter, but he also is an exciting slasher who has won the league's dunk contest twice.\n\n\"The last couple of years, this team has put itself in winning situations in the fourth quarter,\" said Bobcats general manager Rod Higgins, who spent three seasons with Richardson in Golden State. \"When we thought about making this move, we wanted to try to get a veteran guy who could step up and make big plays for us.\"\n\nRichardson was a Golden State fan favorite, remembered for buying a full-page ad in Bay Area newspapers last year apologizing for the Warriors missing the playoffs. Richardson then averaged 19 points a game in this year's playoffs - when the Warriors stunned top-seed Dallas in the first round.\n\nBut Richardson has never been an All-Star and averaged only 16 points a game last season, while missing 31 games with assorted injuries. He's been criticized for his ball handling and defense, and is only a 69 percent free throw shooter.\n\nStill, if Charlotte re-signs Wallace - who becomes an unrestricted free agent Sunday - Richardson and Wallace together would bring some exciting possibilities.\n\nIf Wallace returns, the Bobcats would seem ready to compete for a playoff spot in the Eastern Conference."
