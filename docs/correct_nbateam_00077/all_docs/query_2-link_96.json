        "text": "Age: 34\n\nTitle: Founder + CEO of Bad Birdie\n\nMarried/Single: Married\n\nKids: One 7 month old daughter\n\nCity you live in: Phoenix\n\nA typical day in my life includes… Wake up. Think about golf. Early morning family time. Gym. Bad Birdie office. Think about golf. Family dinner. Hang with my wife once our daughter is down. Go to bed. Dream about golf.\n\nI was born… in Chicago, IL.\n\nMy favorite thing about Arizona… Love the year-round sun and amazing golf courses.\n\nI’m listening to… “Greenlights” by Matthew McConaughey.\n\nMy family… is just getting started. We just had our first daughter last summer and are hoping to have a few more but in no rush. Also, my wife is the rock that truly holds Bad Birdie together. Honestly, she is the real CEO (chief everything officer) of Bad Birdie.\n\nIf I could have dinner with anyone, it would be…Tiger Woods or my wife if he isn’t available.\n\nOne thing I cannot live without… Surprise iced Americanos delivered by Jenna.\n\nWhen I was younger, I wanted to be… a film director. I loved going to the movies as a kid so thought it would be rad to make them! Favorite movie – Indiana Jones. I do speed training on the regular to outrun those boulders.\n\nI’m inspired by… other entrepreneurs who’ve built amazing businesses without compromising their relationships with family and friends.\n\nThe one person who motivates me is… my daughter has changed a lot of my purpose in life. Makes me appreciate how much work my parents put in to create something special for my future. The value of hard work and grit is far from unnoticed within their character – something that I hope my daughter sees in me.\n\nIf I could change anything in the world, it would be… This is a tough question. I’m a big supporter for mental health. There’s a lot of hurt in the world and I think taking small steps towards emotional health (such as therapy) help us build more empathy and ultimately more love for people we do life with.\n\nThe perfect day would be… Big workout in the morning followed by brunch with the family. Golf in the afternoon and happy hour on a patio with friends to wrap up the day.\n\nMy first job was… a caddie at Forest Highlands when I was 12 years old! I worked there in the summers. You could say I caught the golf bug at a very young age.\n\nMy favorite escape… getting on my road bike for a few hours with no distractions. Not even headphones.\n\nMy life… is full of a lot of new changes. We recently moved the business to Arizona, so getting settled in with a new kid and new friends.\n\nI’m currently working on… employee empowerment within the Bad Birdie leadership team. We’ve built an incredible team and take pride in the confidence I have in our team members.\n\nAlways… try your best and forget the rest.\n\nNever… leave a birdie putt short.\n\nFavorite Quote… The closer you are to failure, the closer you are to success.\n\nBiggest Dream… Sponsor a #1 ranked player on the PGA Tour."
