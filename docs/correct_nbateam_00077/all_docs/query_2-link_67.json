        "text": "NBA Comparison: Vince Carter\n\nPositives : Has good vision on the court , can only get better with Coach Izzo’s help. Has a tenacity for rebounding, unbelievable vertical. Has improved his game immensely in his first year. Has developed a nice mid-range , and is becoming very good at hitting the three pointer. Just starting to understand Coach Izzo’s system , already has a few main points down . A major workhorse , always critical of his game always trying to improve it. Loves to play in the transition . Very exciting to watch because when the ball is in his hands, something exciting usually happens. Really loves to play in the big games."
