        "text": "A year from now, when Tom Izzo inevitably yells at Jase Richardson for turning the ball over, as young guards sometimes do, Richardson will have already heard it — from his mother.\n\n“Every single time I either make a turnover or I think I'm about to make one, I hear her voice in the back of my head,” Richardson said.\n\nJase Richardson, who verbally committed to Michigan State on Sunday, is the son of MSU legend Jason Richardson. It’s his mother, Jackie Paul, however, who had the most influence on his game, coaching his teams from his earliest memories through the eighth grade.\n\n“She definitely taught me a lot about how to play this game, how to be a point guard,” Jase said. “Most of my (basketball) IQ comes from her.”\n\nJase’s path to MSU, of course, is through his dad. But MSU didn’t land Jase — a top-35 recruit nationally, who’s playing his senior season at Christopher Columbus High School in Miami — because his dad wanted this for him. Jason kept himself out of the decision process, actually thinking that Alabama might be his son’s choice over MSU.\n\n“When he told us that he's going to Michigan State, it shook me,” Jason said. “I was like. ‘Wow, really?!’\n\n“My loyalty is to my son. I had to take all my feelings about being at Michigan State, winning a championship, the chemistry, the family atmosphere, I had to take that out of the consideration and make sure my son made the right decision for him.”\n\nThe thing is, all those things that Jason valued is what Jase saw when he visited MSU most recently for “Grind Week” — the week when Izzo invites back his former players who are still playing in the NBA or overseas to work out together and with MSU’s current team.\n\n“Just the brotherhood is what really stuck with me,” Jase said, “Just being there during ‘Grind Week’, you can see the brotherhood. Just having everybody back, just talking about how much this means to them. The tradition that they have, being with Coach Iz, being with the team, being with the guys.”\n\n“I think ‘Grind Week’, being there, was the deciding factor,” Jason said.\n\nRELATED: Couch: 3 quick takes on 2024 guard Jase Richardson picking Michigan State\n\nJase, who’s also grown close to MSU assistant coach Mark Montgomery, can sign his letter of intent as early as November. He said he hasn’t fully decided yet whether he’ll sign then or wait until the spring signing period.\n\nJase didn’t exactly grow up at MSU games. He’s only been on campus three times that Jason could recall — twice for visits during his recruitment and once when he was little, when his dad returned for a 10-year reunion of the 2000 championship team. Jase tagged along then because he liked MSU’s opponent that day, the Florida Gators.\n\nHe never asked his dad what it was like playing for Izzo, who can be demonstrative in his demands of his players.\n\n“I think the toughest coach he ever had in his life was his mom,” Jason said. “She's fiery, she's demanding. It's almost a similarity with Coach (Izzo). … That doesn't bother (Jase). He knows that that just helps him to become a better basketball player.\n\n“(Izzo) always been very demanding, but he always got the best out of his guys and the guys always loved him because we know it's nothing personal. He just wants to bring the best out of you. That's why guys keep on coming back. That's why guys, when they're on TV and he grabs somebody's jersey, we don't take it personal as former players and current players, because they know it's love.”\n\nJase grew up mostly in Denver — his family’s home base even late in his dad’s NBA career — before the family moved to Las Vegas for his high school career. He’s playing this final high school season in Miami.\n\nWhile Jason played at the game’s highest level, Jackie coached Jase and a group of kids — several of whom have gone on to play college basketball and football — at the game’s lower levels.\n\n“She made sure that he played basketball the right way,” Jason said. “That he played defense, that he was fundamentally sound. He's a natural point guard, he can shoot the ball, he can play defense. He's just not one-dimensional. He can do a lot of things — a rebounding guard, a post-up guard. I credit my wife for the skill level he has right now because that wasn't me. That was her, the way she coached him, the way she brought him up through basketball.”\n\nJase’s versatility as a guard should help him at MSU, where he hopes to play some alongside point guard Jeremy Fears Jr., who will only be a sophomore when Jase arrives.\n\n“I feel like we could really be a dangerous backcourt,” Jase said.\n\nContact Graham Couch at gcouch@lsj.com.
