        "text": "OAKLAND — The trade of Jason Richardson on Thursday marked the end of more than one era. Not only did it bring to a conclusion Richardson’s six seasons of unstinting hard work — with, for the most part, less exemplary results. It also completed a franchise remodel that may be as drastic as any one-year makeover in NBA history.\n\nGone are Richardson, Derek Fisher, Troy Murphy and Mike Dunleavy, taking with them more than $165 million in salary obligations. And where the June 2006 Warriors were seen as being overpaid, underachieving and ultimately irrelevant, their replacements are younger, cheaper and — hopefully for Golden State — more successful.\n\nExecutive vice president Chris Mullin’s favorite word in his meeting with the media Thursday was “flexibility.” But what, exactly, does that mean for the Warriors? Here are the answers to some of the most burning questions for Golden State’s fan base.\n\nWhat salary obligations do the Warriors still have? They’re on the hook for roughly $50 million for the 2007-08 season, either in guaranteed money for Al Harrington, Stephen Jackson, Sarunas Jasikevicius, Baron Davis, Adonal Foyle, Patrick O’Bryant, Andris Biedrins and Monta Ellis or qualifying offers made to Mickael Pietrus, Kelenna Azubuike and Josh Powell. That relieves the immediate pressure of incurring luxury-tax penalties, something the Warriors are loath to do.\n\nIn 2008-09, when big-money extensions to Ellis and Biedrins would kick in — if that’s the way the Warriors decide to go — Golden State owes $43.3 million. The season after that, only Harrington and Jackson are guaranteed money, a total of $17.7 million. In other words, the future is wide open.\n\nWill the Warriors now be big players in the free-agent market, and what about keeping free-agents-to-be Pietrus and Matt Barnes? They’re still going to be over the salary cap, so the best they can offer a free-agent is the midlevel exception, which will be roughly $5.5 million. As for Pietrus and Barnes, things are looking up. The Warriors were expected to keep only one of the pair because of luxury-tax concerns but now can consider bringing both back. The Warriors can match any offer sheet signed by Pietrus because he’s a restricted free agent; as an unrestricted free agent, Barnes can get up to the midlevel maximum.\n\nWhat, exactly, is this infamous $10 million trade exception? What good does it do? Can it help the Warriors get Kevin Garnett? Since the Warriors dealt Richardson without taking back any salary — draft rights are worth $0 for salary-cap purposes — they are free to absorb up to $10 million worth of excess salary in a future trade or trades completed before June 28, 2008 (assuming they don’t stay under the salary cap, which is a safe bet). That means the Warriors can ship out players worth $4 million and get back $9 million worth of talent in return, something ordinarily prohibited by salary-cap rules, and still have $5 million worth of the exception left to use in other deals.\n\nThere are several restrictions to using the exception; for example, it cannot be combined with another exception or outgoing player salaries to bring in a player worth more than $10 million. But the trade exception will allow the Warriors access to some free agents they wouldn’t otherwise have a shot at.\n\nForwards such as Rashard Lewis (Seattle), Gerald Wallace (Charlotte), Darko Milicic (Orlando) and Anderson Varejao (Cleveland) can now be signed by other teams and traded immediately to the Warriors for a relatively small cost. The Warriors also could use the trade exception to sweeten the pot for a player worth more than $10 million, such as Garnett, who’s scheduled to earn a league-high $22 million this season. While Golden State would still need to send out $17.6 million in salary to liberate Garnett from Minnesota — meaning Foyle would almost certainly have to be included — it could make its offer more palatable by taking on Mark Blount and Mark Madsen in a separate transaction, who will make a combined $9.2 million this season.\n\nNotes: John O’Connor, the lawyer and agent for Warriors coach Don Nelson, said that he expects the countersuit of Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban to fail. Nelson has filed suit to recover $6.6 million in deferred pay he says he’s owed by the Mavericks; the Fort Worth Star-Telegram revealed this week that Cuban replied last month with a claim that Nelson is violating a non-compete clause in the consulting contract he walked away from to rejoin the Warriors. Cuban wants Nelson to be barred from the Warriors’ bench until the five-year consulting deal expires. “If (Nelson) gets enjoined from coaching, you could knock me over with a feather,” O’Connor said. Nelson said he didn’t want to talk too much about the situation, but did charge that Cuban, “is like a politician. He fires off first, and then says we did it. … I’m basically embarrassed by the whole thing, but he’s not going to let it go away.”"
