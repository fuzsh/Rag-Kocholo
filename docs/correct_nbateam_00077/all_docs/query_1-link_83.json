        "text": "It’s one of the biggest upsets in NBA Playoff History. The 8th seeded Golden State Warriors would make easy work of the top-seeded Mavericks in the first round of 2007 NBA Playoffs. Under the leadership of former Maverick head coach Don Nelson and a young nucleus of players. Led by two-times NBA All-Star Baron Davis along with NBA Champions Stephen Jackson and Matt Barnes, former slam dunk champion Jason Richardson and Mickael Pietrus to name a few.\n\nJason Terry was a member of the 2007 Mavericks team that was ousted in six games. Terry recently appeared on the Mavs Fanatic Podcast and shared that future Hall of Famer Dirk Nowitzki threw a chair putting a hole in the visiting locker room at Oracle Area that is still there today. That 2007 Golden State Warriors team was able to get under the skin of Dirk Nowitzki.\n\nDirk will be entering his record-breaking 21st season with the Dallas Mavericks breaking the record of another future Hall of Famer Kobe Bryant, who played 20 seasons with the Los Angeles Lakers before returning after the 2016 season. Kobe would end his career by putting on a show by tallying 60 points in his final game. After the game, he would deliver the infamous mamba out speech and dropped the mic.\n\nJason Terry is currently a free agent after playing last season with the Milwaukee Bucks he told the Mavs Fanatic Podcast, which he did not plan on retiring before Dirk, Vince Carter, and Manu Ginobili. He did confirm that there has been some decision about him joining the Mavericks front office the last couple years, but he would like to put on a Mavs jersey and take off down the runway one more time before retiring. It would be a storybook ending to have both Dirk and Terry fade off into the sunset.\n\nTweet"
