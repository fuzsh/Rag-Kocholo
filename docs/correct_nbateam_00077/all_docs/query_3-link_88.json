        "text": "Jason Richardson played 33 games for the 76ers during the 2012-13 season before having surgery to repair a hole in the cartilage of his left knee. He hadn’t stepped on the court during a game since, until Friday night.\n\nRichardson made his return to the court and the starting lineup in a home loss to the Pacers. He showed some rust early on, airballing his first shot attempt.\n\nHe finished strong, however, with seven points, seven rebounds and two assists in 18 minutes.\n\n\"It was extra special,\" Richardson told reporters, per The Associated Press. \"Going through what I've been through the last two years, not knowing if I was ever going to play basketball again — this is special. It was an amazing experience.\"\n\nRichardson, a former No. 5 overall pick out of Michigan State and two-time slam dunk champion, serves as a veteran leader on a team laden with youngsters. He's in his 14th NBA season."
