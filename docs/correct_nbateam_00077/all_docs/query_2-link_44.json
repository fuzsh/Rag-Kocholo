        "text": "Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images\n\nJason Richardson has taken flight for the last time as an NBA player.\n\nThe 34-year-old announced his retirement on Instagram just before the start of training camps, deciding to walk away ahead of his 15th season.\n\nAfter stints with the Golden State Warriors, Charlotte Bobcats, Phoenix Suns, Orlando Magic and Philadelphia 76ers, Richardson was slated to join the Atlanta Hawks on a non-guaranteed deal. But he has battled injuries over the last few years, appearing in just 52 games since 2012-13, and recently learned he had bone spurs in his supposedly healthy right knee, according to Yahoo Sports' Marc. J. Spears.\n\n\"I didn't want to limp the rest of my life,\" Richardson told Spears of his decision to hang it up. \"I still have my whole life in front of me, God willing.\"\n\nDrafted fifth overall by the Warriors in 2001, Richardson is best known for his high-flying acrobatics as the headliner for mostly bad Golden State teams between 2001-02 and 2006-07. He won back-to-back Slam Dunk Contests in 2002 and 2003, and his 360-degree, in-game windmill jams became momentary therapy for an embattled Warriors fanbase.\n\n\"Through all the ups and downs of Warrior-dom in the early part of this century, Jason Richardson was the one constant,\" wrote Golden State of Mind's Bram Kincheloe. \"He was our superstar. He was our savior. He was the one shining, athletically gifted light amongst a team full of Danny Fortsons, Eric Dampiers and Chris Millss. He jumped higher than anyone. He tried harder than anyone.\"\n\nRichardson, to be sure, should be remembered for more than just dunks. He carried himself like the consummate hard worker.\n\nFew aging vets would have busted their butts to return from injury and make 19 appearances for a tanking Sixers squad, as he did. He also adjusted his game to account for those aching limbs, not unlike the previously high-flying Vince Carter, relying on his outside shooting (37 percent from deep for his career) rather than his atmospheric adventures.\n\nStill, rim-razing slams are an integral part of his legacy. There were so many of them. Too may to count. And though he hasn't been his soaring 20-something self for years, the realization that there will never again be a live-action shot of him abusing the iron is surreal.\n\nAnd so, we reflect on the best of Richardson—on the gravity-scorning airtime, the seat-clearing dunks and everything in between.\n\nThe 2006-07 Warriors weren't supposed to do much. They were projected to win only 40 games and spent the majority of the season below .500.\n\nIn the end, they did just enough to snag the Western Conference's eighth and final playoff spot, finishing with a pleasantly surprising 42 wins. And that was enough.\n\nNothing else needed to happen for the Warriors. The top-seeded 60-win Dallas Mavericks awaited them in the first round, and the Warriors were going to lose.\n\nThey didn't lose.\n\nGolden State unseated Dallas in six games, in large part because of Richardson. He averaged 19.5 points, 6.8 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.3 steals on 51.1 percent shooting through that series, joining Baron Davis as one of the team's two lifelines.\n\nLittle else mattered aside from that victory. The Warriors would fall to the Utah Jazz in five games during the second round, and it didn't matter. Golden State already did more than it was supposed to do.\n\nFittingly enough (sort of), this surprise run saw Richardson play his final games in a Warriors uniform. He was traded to Charlotte during the 2007 draft, on the heels of what is still one of the most impressive team feats in Warriors history.\n\nIt's really hard, if not impossible to single out one of Richardson's 360-degree dunks. There are so many of them.\n\nGo ahead and Google \"Jason Richardson 360-degree dunks.\" The results go on forever.\n\nWatch as many as you can. Lose yourself in them. Start questioning why no one else in today's NBA has made them a part of their everyday repertoires.\n\nThen, when you're done with all that, appreciate the above clip that shows Richardson routinely yet savagely taking flight and throwing down another 360-degree stuff in December 2008 during Phoenix's 110-102 win over the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nIs he the all-time leader in 360-degree jams? Who knows?\n\nMy unofficially official guess: hell yes.\n\nBack when Gilbert Arenas was still being paid to play basketball, Richardson and his budding running mate connected on a rare bounce-pass alley-oop while on the break during a 135-92 slaughtering of the Orlando Magic in November 2002.\n\nRelative to many of Richardson's other stuffs, this one is pretty tame. But you just don't see this kind of mid-game flair in the NBA anymore.\n\nPlus, Richardson really basked in this bucket. Time stood still as he elegantly floated through the air, leaning slightly sideways, before settling into a prolonged stay on the rim that almost assuredly would have earned a technical foul in today's league for its excessiveness.\n\nEven better, Shawn Kemp—who, for your information, unexpectedly hugged me once—pointlessly fouled him at the end.\n\nMaybe he was just trying to help Richardson off of cloud nine. For whatever reason, he half-pushed, half-grabbed Richardson's waist in a way that prompted the dunksmith to whip around around the rim, sort of like he was breakdancing in mid-air.\n\nYay, mid-air breakdancing.\n\nThis is what happens when Manu Ginobili tries taking a charge without exaggerating contact.\n\nWe really owe a retroactive thanks to the 2007-08 version of Raymond Felton. Had he not employed the totally unnecessary, make-Stephon-Marbury-proud handoff to Richardson in transition, there would be no poster slam on which to reminisce. There would be no reason to even mention this February 2008 bout with the San Antonio Spurs, as the Bobcats were pummeled into submission, losing 85-65.\n\nRichardson just annihilates the rim on this one, no spin necessary. He threw it down with such force—using only one hand, mind you—the resulting noise sounded like a dinosaur fossil being snapped in half.\n\nOn a totally unrelated note: Man oh man, has Ginobili been rocking the bald patch for a while.\n\nNo, seriously, there no words.\n\nExcept, wow.\n\nTrailing by two inside five seconds to play during a March 2006 tilt against the Mavericks, the Warriors looked on as Jason Terry tried stretching the lead to three. But, almost as if what came next was written in the stars, Terry missed his free throw.\n\nRichardson grabbed the rebound and, while not really known for his ball-handling chops, ran up the floor. He spun around Terry—because on-ball gyrations are his business—and tossed up an off-balance Hail Mary from a few feet behind the arc. It went in, because of course it did.\n\nThe Warriors won, head coach Mike Dunleavy awkwardly pumped his fist and Richardson yelled while making angry-happy faces.\n\nFun was had by all—except, you know, the Mavericks.\n\nOff-balance game-winning three-pointers are cool.\n\nReverse alley-oop-finishing, overtime-forcing buzzer-beaters are probably cooler.\n\nWith just 0.4 seconds left in regulation of this November 2010 matchup between Phoenix and the Memphis Grizzlies, Grant Hill threw an inbounds strike to a backdoor-cutting Richardson who had taken it upon himself to enter his comfort zone: a reverse-dunking motion.\n\nRichardson didn't actually dunk the ball. No, no, no. He took a gentleman's approach and guided it into the basket with his fingertips, completing one of the most softhearted buzzer-beaters in NBA history.\n\nPhoenix went on to win 123-118 in overtime, while Darrell Arthur, then of the Memphis Grizzlies, would use this lapse in defensive judgment as the learning experience that fueled his eventual rise into the Defensive Player of the Year conversation*.\n\n*One of these things may not be true.\n\nThere is a Jordan-like feel to the way Richardson could once absorb mid-move contact and then still fling the ball toward the basket. No-look reverse layups were kind of his thing.\n\nOn this particular play, he blows by Dirk Nowitzki during Golden State's Game 3 win over Dallas in the first round of the 2007 playoffs, attacking from the right baseline, at which point he's met by Erick Dampier as he begins to take flight. Richardson, still in mid-air, contorts his body around Dampier, swinging his arm under the outstretched one of Dallas' big man.\n\nSomehow, after all this, Richardson hasn't yet hit the ground, and he's able to convert the and-1 layup attempt.\n\nLooking back, he made finishes like these look easy. Effortless. Routine.\n\nBut make no mistake, they were incredibly difficult and not for those of limited, regular-human-being athletic prowess. It's Richardson who added the calm and cool.\n\nNext time you're watching an NBA game and see a defender—let's call him Blake Griffin—run from an explosive dunk attempt, this is why.\n\nNonchalantly crossing over Anthony Parker during Charlotte's April 2008 win over the Toronto Raptors wasn't enough. Well, actually, maybe it was. Richardson's subsequent beeline toward the basket could have just ended with an unchallenged one-handed slam. But no.\n\nRasho Nesterovic made the mistake of joining the impending photo op. Richardson rose up from just outside the restricted area and absolutely destroyed him with the right hand. You can actually see the basket sag more than usual as Richardson makes contact with the rim.\n\nNow, it must be noted that Nesterovic had a knack for photobombing posters. Andre Iguodala dunked on him once. So, too, did Kevin Durant. Even Tracy McGrady joined in on the fun.\n\nThat doesn't make what Richardson did here any less superhuman. This is basically the inverse of what DeAndre Jordan did to Brandon Knight in 2013. Nesterovic, a center, had a good six inches and 30 pounds on Richardson, and yet the 6'6\" guard still blew through the 7-footer like he was some inflatable pool toy.\n\nDunk Contest title defenses can be self-sabotaging. You struggle to come up with something new and fresh that also matches the degree of difficulty and fanfare from your first go-round.\n\nAnyone worried that Richardson would suffer from dunker's fatigue after winning the 2002 and 2003 competitions was eventually put at ease. He showed up ready to amaze with the above gem.\n\nOff the backboard? Check. Between the legs? Yup. Obligatory windmill motion? Absolutely.\n\nImportant: jeez. Fred Jones actually earned the win in this dunk-off, because the world is unfair, but still: jeez.\n\nNot unlike before, it's really difficult to put the sheer awesomeness of this aerial accolade into proper context. TNT analyst Kenny Smith came the closest to doing it justice.\n\n\"Are you kidding me?\" Smith exclaimed at the time. \"That is sick. That is sick. He's got the flu. He's sick.\"\n\nJust when you thought you had seen it all from Richardson, he went and pulled a sanity-shattering stunt like this, reinforcing his standing as one of the NBA's foremost modern-day dunking pioneers.\n\nStats courtesy of Basketball-Reference.com.\n\nDan Favale covers the NBA for Bleacher Report.
