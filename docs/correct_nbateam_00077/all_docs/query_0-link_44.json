        "text": "Four players key to the “We Believe” Warriors of 2007 are being brought back to Oracle Arena for Golden State fans to celebrate.\n\nBaron Davis, Jason Richardson, Stephen Jackson and Al Harrington have reportedly been invited to attend a playoff game and get a 10-year anniversary ovation. Those “We Believe” Warriors will be at a second-round game, as reported first by KNBR’s Murph & Mac.\n\n“That is unbelievable,” Jackson said on KNBR, reacting to the news. “I just got that text message too and I couldn’t reply quick enough. I can’t wait to be there, to be in that playoff atmosphere. It was some special time. I think the Bay is still rockin’ from when we played there, and for them to honor us 10 years later … it’s exciting. It’s going to be good to have all the guys back together in that arena.”\n\nThose four will be joined by Matt Barnes, who was on the 2007 team that bounced the No. 1-seeded Mavericks from the first round of the playoffs — and is on the Warriors again.\n\n“With Matt being on the team, we feel like we’re playing right now,” Jackson said. “I hope they get a championship, because if Matt is able to get a championship with this team, it feels like we all won.”\n\nClick here if you’re having trouble viewing the slideshow.\n\nWarriors ownership has changed since 2007, but Joe Lacob and Peter Gruber reportedly reached out to the Davis, Richardson, Jackson and Harrington.\n\nJackson waxed poetic about the 2007 season and playoff victory.\n\n“It was the birth of something. It was the birth of small ball,” Jackson said on KNBR. “To this day, that ‘We Believe’ team taught the fans in Oakland how to believe and how to believe anything can be done. Well now, these guys took what we done and just took it to another level. We definitely started it. We got this city rockin’ — we got that attitude of not giving up and believing in each other. It was just special. But these kids now — KD, Steph, Klay, Draymond, Shaun Livingston — these guys are just taking it to another level.”\n\nFour former Golden State stars will be visitors to that level in the second round.\n\n(Anyone who needs reminding of the “We Believe” Warriors would do well to check out this column by Marcus Thompson II about that era. That, and harken back to when columnist Tim Kawakami asked in a blog post, “How in the hell did the GSWs do this?”)\n\nBy the way, at least two of the four “We Believe” players are involved in Ice Cube’s BIG3 basketball league.\n\nHere’s a guess as to whether each player — sans Stak5, who’s clearly in — will say yes to Golden State’s ticket/reunion proposal…\n\nBaron Davis\n\nDavis’ decision to leave for the Clippers in 2008, he said at the time, was about moving to his hometown of Los Angeles — so an acceptance to 10-year affair could be in the cards.\n\nDuring his three seasons with the Warriors, including the 2006-07 season, Davis averaged 20.2 points, 8.1 assists, 4.5 rebounds and 2.1 steals (almost more like Draymond Green than Stephen Jackson, who claims he’s more the Money Green of that generation). The point guard played as recently as 2012, when he suited up 29 times for the Knicks, after leaving Golden State for the division rival Clippers nine years ago\n\nIt’s easy to wonder if Davis, who was The Beard before James Harden took the mantel, will play in BIG3 this summer. Could he be “Player X” listed on this press release from the league? If so, he’d be playing alongside Brian Scalabrine and coached by Warriors legend Rick Barry.\n\nJason Richardson\n\nDespite being traded in 2007, it seems like J-Rich would accept a reported invite since he recently thanked for the Warriors for happy birthday wishes.\n\nRichardson spent six seasons with the Dubs, who took him fifth out of Michigan State (like Draymond) in the 2001 draft, and averaged 18.3 points, 5.4 rebounds and 3.2 assists a game until a 2007 trade to Charlotte.\n\nAfter getting jettisoned by Golden State — as part of a 2007 trade for Brandan Wright, who was later swapped for the draft pick that netted Draymond Green — Richardson stayed in the NBA until 2015. That said, he told Marcus Thompson II, “I wish we coulda had that team together for one more year.”\n\nHe is actually fully signed up for BIG3, paired with co-captain and former Pistons star Chauncey Billups as well as player-coach Charles Oakley, the estranged Knicks legend. What a combo.\n\nAl Harrington\n\nThe parties parted peacefully, so it wouldn’t be wrong to venture a guess that Harrington will say yes. He did, after all, call for more pick and rolls involving Stephen Curry on Twitter recently.\n\nBaby Al arrived as part of the trade for Jackson in early 2007 and left 20 months later in a swap for Jamal Crawford. Harrington had publicly asked for a trade and was sent to the Knicks in a reunion with former Pacers president Donnie Walsh, so he was happy with the move. So why would he hold it against Lacob, Gruber and the guys?\n\nHarrington averaged 14.5 points and 5.7 rebounds in 139 games with the Warriors, 11 of which were in the playoffs. Those numbers about match his 13.5 points and 5.6 rebounds per game over a 16-year career.\n\nHe’s set to play with ex-Nets and Nuggets star Kenyon Martin, plus be coached by Rick Mahorn, in BIG3."
