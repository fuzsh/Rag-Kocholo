Jason Richardson Biography

Jason Richardson is known as one of the great slam dunkers of all-time. The Golden State Warriors selected Richardson out of the University of Michigan in 2001 after he helped the Wolverines to an NCAA National Championship. Upon joining the Warriors he competed in the NBA Rookie/Sophomore Challenge and won the NBA Slam Dunk Contest in consecutive years in 2002 and 2003. After seven seasons with the Warriors he joined the Charlotte Bobcats and then headed to the Suns and Magic before landing with the Philadelphia 76ers in 2012. Over the course of his career he was a consistent performer, averaging double figures for 13 consecutive seasons with his best years coming in 2005-06 and 2007-08 in which he averaged 23.2 points and 21.8 points respectively. Richardson has always been known for his hops, but it’s what he used them for that made him such a valuable asset to his teams over the years. His rebounding ability and explosiveness to the ball made him a valuable defender and feared threat in transition. Teams know that no matter where he is on the floor, they better account for him or he’ll make them pay by putting the ball in the hoop.
