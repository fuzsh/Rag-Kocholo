        "text": "Little Big Town featured powerhouse singer-songwriter and former co-headlining tour mate Miranda Lambert on a newly-released rendition of “Little White Church” on Friday (August 9). The collaboration arrives as Little Big Town celebrates the group’s 25th anniversary this year.\n\nLittle Big Town — the quartet made up of Karen Fairchild, Kimberly Schlapman, Phillip Sweet and Jimi Westbrook — released the band’s first-ever Greatest Hits album on Friday. The collection includes the new version of their 2010 anthem, “Little White Church,” featuring Lambert, and a previously-released version of “Shut Up Train” featuring Kelsea Ballerini. The career-spanning collection also includes “Boondocks,” “Better Man,” “Pontoon,” “Tornado,” “Girl Crush” and others, plus a collaboration with 2024 tour mates Sugarland.\n\nBoondocks\n\nI’m With the Band\n\nLittle White Church (feat.
