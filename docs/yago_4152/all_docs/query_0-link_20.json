        "text": "for video & electronics\n\nAu Secours! is a reimagining of the Abel Gance film of the same name starring Max Linder. The original footage is repurposed, repositioned, and subjected to some of the infinitely destructive capabilities of modern video technology and machine learning in order to both intensify and breathe new life into its narrative. Much like the film, the music is created in a similar fashion. The source material stems from a collection of my previously recorded music, mixed in with various sounds, snippets, and samples of instruments and objects I have recorded and accumulated over the years. Through a variety of electroacoustic techniques, the music is ultimately compiled, or rather collaged, into an entirely new work bearing virtually no resemblance to the content’s original form. By stripping away all relationships to their source materials, both the music and the film come together to express themes of desperation, isolation, horror, and psychosis."
