        "text": "Believed to be Max Linder's last surviving work.\n\nMax the lovable upper class twit is back, but in a more passive role (and minus top hat and gloves). He accepts a bet (from one of his not so lovable upper class twit mates) that he cannot remain in a haunted castle for one hour without crying for help.\n\nLight on humor, but maintains interest via a brisk pace, along with ample trick camera shots and close-ups that highlight Max's extraordinary expressive skills.\n\nStill, it would've had a very different ending if Max's bride were like my aunt, who always slept within reach of her pistol."
