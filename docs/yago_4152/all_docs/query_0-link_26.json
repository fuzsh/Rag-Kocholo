        "text": "This typically audacious and inventive short film from Abel Gance runs scarcely 23 minutes (though it was originally intended to be much longer) but is a treasure trove of outré camera effects and surreal weirdness. Supposedly filmed on a dare (Gance was to write, shoot and edit the whole thing in just three days), Gance expanded on some of the techniques he’d tried out in his previous film, La Roue (1923), which had experimented with lighting and editing techniques not previously seen, to quite startling effect. Although it’s a haunted house film (it’s been referred to in the past under the title The Haunted House) it’s not particularly scary and one suspects that Gance never really meant to it to. But it is a fascinating medley of wild camera tricks, old fashioned practical effects that date back to Georges Méliès being given a new spin and demented action set-pieces that all adds up to a frankly insane ride even today.\n\nWhat little plot there is, courtesy of Gance and his star Max Linder, has a faintly “meta” feel to it. Where Gance made the film on a dare, so the narrative begins with the overweening Count Maulette (Jean Toulout) issuing his own dare to some of his guests at a private club, taunting them to spend one hour in a supposedly haunted castle. The recently married Max (Linder) rashly accepts the challenge with a thousand francs at stake. To win the bet, Max needs to stay in the castle from 11 PM until midnight – a seemingly easy task until he’s assaulted by a barrage of supernatural events and disorientating happenings. Gance and his photographers Émile Pierre, André-Wladimir Reybas and Georges Specht have a field day with all manner of unexpected trickery, even warping the very film that they’re shooting on, creating woozy, vertiginous effects that are almost impossible to describe in mere words.\n\nMax is stalked by a living mannequin, men in skeleton suits, wild animals let loose in the hallways and what appear to be ghosts, driving him to the very brink of insanity. Although Au secours! (the title translates as Help!) was meant as a comedy, there’s something very disturbing about these scenes particularly today when more is known about Linder’s own unhappy circumstances. His mental health had never been great and his experiences as a despatch driver in the carnage of World War I had only made matters worse. It had been suspected that he’d entered into a suicide pact with his wife, the seventeen-year-old Hélène “Ninette” Peters (Linder was 40 at the time and, by all accounts, an abusive and jealous husband) when they were found unconscious in their Vienna hotel room on 24 February 1924. Months after completing work on Au secours!, Linder, by now a habitual user of opium which was further unhinging his mind, and Peters cut their own wrists and this time their suicide attempt was horribly successful.\n\nIt was a tragic end for a hugely popular comedy star, both in France and abroad (Charlie Chaplin was one of his legion of fans) and it makes the scenes of the fictional Max being driven insane rather hard to watch. Linder really throws himself into these scenes with an intensity that one now suspects was fuelled by his own psychological demons. The film concludes with Maulette playing a cruel trick, convincing Max that his wife Edith (Gina Palerme) is being menaced by a monstrous intruder in their home (the closest the film comes to a genuinely scary moment), causing him to flee the castle to save her and lose his bet.\n\nThere are some startlingly impressive images to be found here, the parade of monsters, apparitions and wildlife that assault Max becoming so odd that the film transforms from light comedy to surrealist nightmare in a heartbeat. Gance keeps up the comedy, making some of the encounters so absurd that laughter is the only sensible response, but it’s Gance’s use of old-as-film-itself trickery that makes the film so compelling. Though when Max starts leaping into the air (with the aid of an off-camera trampoline), moving around in highly accelerated motion and the image itself begins to pivot and distort around him, looking for all the world like there’s a fault in the projector, we’re in a place that we’d rarely been to in cinema before.\n\nAs a love letter to the pioneers of film effects (Méliès, George Albert Smith, Edwin S. Porter, Segundo de Chomón et al) Au secours! is a lot of fun. The comedy is broad and of the slapstick, knockabout style, and today much of the clowning looks quaint. But although the manifestations of the supernatural and the weird are often played for laughs, there are some very disturbing moments here and there. For Gance, the film proved to be the final brick in the road to his masterpiece Napoleón (which saw him continue to experiment with hew film-making techniques) which would occupy his time and energies for the next three years. One wonders if, in retrospect, he looked back on the quick, cheap and fun Au secours! with some fondness as the production on his epic wound on. It must have seemed an altogether simpler way of making a living…"
