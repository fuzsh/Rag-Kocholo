Cast is great with Ryan the MVP. Surprisingly emotional towards the last half.\n\nI didn't like the story in that one but Affleck's directing was amazing. Also Ed Harris <3\n\nPost by bobbystarks on\n\nFirst off, LOL at your avatar.\n\nAnyway, I watched Jarmusch's Broken Flowers (8/10) last night and I really dug it. Very quiet film and I loved how it used the different women he met as metaphors for the different relationships you experience throughout life. And Tilda Swinton was in the film for maybe two minutes and absolutely stole the show. How the hell does she do that??\n\nPost by pessimusreincarnated on\n\nPaterson (2016)- 8.5/10\n\nLovely little film. Could've easily come off as slight and pretentious, but thanks to Jarmusch's talent for creating stories that are small in scale yet rich in themes, it's a joy to watch. Adam Driver turns in his best performance yet as the soft-spoken, perceptive title character, really anchoring the entire film as a whole.\n\nPost by theycallmemrfish on\n\nArrival - ****.\n\nBought it early on Amazon and it really didn't disappoint. Loved everything about it.\n\nThis was also good because my previous first-viewing was Dirty Grandpa, which was the equivalent of taint sweat.\n\nPost by mhynson27 on\n\nI re-watched The Nice Guys the other night. Just as good and funny as I remember it. My #5 of 2016, I nominate Gosling, Rice and the Screenplay.\n\nPost by harlequinade on\n\nJust watched Pollock which was good, the acting however was great. I know a lot of people say this is Harris' best work but I saw Sweet Dreams last week and he was just incredible there. He was amazing here as was Marcia, very cool she got an Oscar for this.\n\nPost by Zeb31 on\n\nYou Can Count on Me. Wasn't a huge fan of Ruffalo's performance, but Linney is luminous and their last scene together is devastating. Very touching little film, even if it lacks the ambition and emotional punch of Lonergan's following two. 8/10.\n\nPost by napierslogs on\n\nFrank and Cindy. I've become a pretty big Johnny Simmons fan, although I normally wouldn't go for a movie like that. But I ended up liking it. Cute and funny at times, and the fact that it was a personal story definitely helped make it feel very honest emotionally. Solid acting.\n\n7/10\n\nPost by Pittsnogle_Goggins on\n\nEdge of Seventeen. Really liked this and was quite impressed with Steinfeld.\n\nAlso, I can't get anything to work for my avatar. Someone pleae help me!!!\n\nPost by Zeb31 on\n\nAlso, I can't get anything to work for my avatar. Someone pleae help me!!!\n\nGo to \"Profile\" at the top of this page.

It was as magnificent as 14 years ago. Last truly deserving Best Picture win, IMO, out of winners that I've seen (haven't seen NCFOM but hearing it's a masterpiece).\n\nPost by bobbystarks on\n\nEdge of Seventeen.

Then click the little checkbox on the left that says \"Use only the Uploaded/Linked\"\n\nAnd Steinfeld's just fucking fantastic, isn't she? The more I think about it the more it's becoming my favorite performance of the year.\n\nPost by elevenx23 on\n\nSteinfeld is fantastic, agreed. The older she gets the better her career will be. It's tough for teens to get great roles except once in a blue moon. Edge of 17 is once in a blue moon. Much like Saoirse Ronan. She was struggling too after her first Oscar nom.\n\nPost by bobbystarks on\n\nSteinfeld is fantastic, agreed. The older she gets the better her career will be.

Steinfeld and Oulaya Amamra\n\nin Divines are battling it out for the overall female performance for me. And then Bryce Dallas Howard in Black Mirror is my favorite of the year in any medium, but I'm strictly talking film.\n\nPost by Pittsnogle_Goggins on\n\nIt wont accept any link I put in though.\n\nYou mean it won't upload it at all?

Trying to do stuff from my ipad wasn't helping.\n\nYeah you got it. I can see your avatar just fine.\n\nPost by mikediastavrone96 on\n\nbobbystarks I still have plenty to see, but right now Steinfeld is still my favorite performance of 2016, just slightly edging out Casey Affleck in my last seen film Manchester by the Sea, which I gave an 8/10. Well, that was a very forced way to tie in the reply and the topic of the thread in one sentence.\n\nYeah Casey's definitely my favorite male performance of the year. Steinfeld and Oulaya Amamra\n\nin Divines are battling it out for the overall female performance for me. And then Bryce Dallas Howard in Black Mirror is my favorite of the year in any medium, but I'm strictly talking film.\n\nbobbystarks I've never seen Black Mirror, but been thinking of checking it out."
