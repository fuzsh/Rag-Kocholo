        "text": "Cinefranco Film Festival 2005 - UPDATE #3\n\nAu secours, j'ai trente ans!\n\nDirected by Marie-Anne Chazel\n\nFRANCE/93 MINUTES\n\nThis plotless comedy/drama follows the exploits of three 30-something friends - Yann (Pierre Palmade), Kathy (Giovanna Mezzogiorno), and Tara (Nathalie Corré) - as they deal with the news that Yann has cancer, a revelation that forces Kathy and Tara to make some changes in their lives. Au secours, j'ai trente ans! is pleasant enough, though far from engaging; the film runs out of steam about an hour in, thanks to an abundance of superfluous subplots (Kathy's late-in-the-third-act reunion with an old flame is the most obvious example of this). It also doesn't help that Kathy winds up with a verbally abusive jerk, a move that doesn't make a whole lot of sense given the character's fierce independence. It's the better-than-expected performances that keep Au secours, j'ai trente ans! from becoming an entirely interminable experience, as the actors effectively breathe life into these sporadically intriguing characters.\n\nout of\n\nJe n'aime que toi (My Only Love)\n\nDirected by Claude Fournier\n\nQUEBEC/105 MINUTES\n\nJe n'aime que toi follows aging novelist Georges Guérin (Michel Forget) as he befriends a hooker named Daisy (played by Noémie Godin-Vigneau), though their relationship initially has nothing to do with sex (Georges hires Daisy on an hour-by-hour basis to just talk about her experiences). Georges, in turn, uses said material as fodder for his new book, but soon finds himself experiencing some decidedly inappropriate feelings towards Daisy. Writer/director Claude Founier imbues Je n'aime que toi with a ponderous, heavy-handed vibe, something that's exacerbated by an excruciatingly slow-pace and Jorane's overbearing musical score. Though the performances are actually quite good, neither Forget nor Godin-Vigneau is able to breathe much life into this dialogue - which doesn't sound even remotely authentic (nobody talks this way).\n\nout of\n\nAgents Secrets\n\nDirected by Frédéric Schoendoerffer\n\nFRANCE/ITALY/SPAIN/109 MINUTES"
