        "text": "CLEVELAND, Ohio â€“ How impactful was the initial trailer for Scarlett Johansson's new film \"Lucy\" this past April? Well, it pretty much changed the marketing campaign for a film that wasn't getting as much attention as other potential summer blockbusters.\n\nUniversal Pictures moved the release of the film up a few weeks (it's out this Friday) to capitalize on Johansson's huge buzz. Now, it's poised to be a major hit.\n\nAnyone who wasn't on board with Johansson as the next big female action star after her turn as The Black Widow, was certainly more convinced after seeing the awesome trailer for \"Lucy.\"\n\nWhether the film is good or not remains to be seen. However, it could prove to be the latest in a long run of successes for the 29-year-old Johansson, who's been starring in movies for 20 years now.\n\nHer buzz started with the release of Robert Redford's \"The Horse Whisperer\" in 1998. The film starred Johansson as an emotionally and physically scarred girl whose family seeks help from a horse whisperer.\n\nJohansson's real breakthrough came starring along side Bill Murray in Sofia Coppola's Oscar-nominated \"Lost In Translation\" in 2003. She then went on to become Woody Allen's favorite actress in films like \"Scoop,\" \"Match Point\" and \"Vicky Cristina Barcelona.\"\n\nIt's highly doubtful that \"Lucy\" will be Johansson's most successful film, given the massive success of Marvel's \"Avengers\" films. But \"Lucy\" could be the first major blockbuster headlined by Johansson."
