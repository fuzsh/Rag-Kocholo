        "text": "Reviewed by Colin Jacobson (February 27, 2007)\n\nWith 2005s Match Point, Woody Allen did a lot to revitalize his career. Not only did critics like it, but also Allen attracted a decent audience to movie screens for the first time in quite a while. No, the flicks $23 million gross wasnt amazing, but since it was the first Allen effort since the mid-Eighties to pass the $20 million mark, this was a good improvement.\n\n2006s Scoop went back to Woodys old patterns. Critics failed to muster much enthusiasm for it, and the flick made a mere $10 million in the US. What should Allen learn from this experience? Quality flicks produce enthusiastic audiences. Since Scoop is eminently forgettable, the lackluster response to it shouldnt surprise.\n\nScoop opens with the funeral of daring reporter Joe Strombel (Ian McShane). After some eulogizing, we meet Joe himself as he finds himself stuck in a boat headed to the afterlife. Another dead passenger passes on her suspicion that rising politician Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman) is actually the notorious serial slayer known as the Tarot Card Killer.\n\nJoe cant keep this juicy information under wraps. He slips out of the boat and manages to channel his ghostly self into the presence of journalism student Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson). He relates his info to her while shes part of a magic trick performed by the Great Splendini, aka Sidney Waterman (Allen).\n\nSondra runs with this and involves Sidney. At first he doubts her, but when he also witnesses the apparition, he believes. Sondra and Sidney follow Lyman and she gets to know him when she pretends to drown. After Lyman rescues her, she fakes the identity of a Palm Beach heiress named Jade Spence. She refers to Sidney as her dad, and the pair get ensnared in British high society when Lyman takes a romantic fancy to her. The movie follows the character pairings and Sondras attempts to investigate the Tarot Card Killer.\n\nAlthough Allen made his name intelligent comedies, over the last couple of decades, much of his best work has come from more dramatic fare. Efforts like Match Point and Crimes and Misdemeanors proved bright and involving, while many of Allens comedic attempts lacked zest or cleverness. Instead, weve gotten witless fare like Mighty Aphrodite and Anything Else.\n\nWhile I wouldnt call Scoop as dismal as those flicks, I cant claim that it offers much entertainment. Indeed, it presents an awfully thin flick. The plot barely qualifies as such. Instead, its more of a story concept than a full-fledged tale. We get a cute idea spread across more than 90 minutes without decent development.\n\nAla something such as Manhattan Murder Mystery, Scoop attempts to span two genres as a comedy mystery. Like the somewhat more satisfying MMM, this sucker doesnt coalesce well and it fails to explore either area well. Scoops mystery elements prove wholly predictable and unsatisfying, while the comedy doesnt produce laughs. The movie meanders through its inevitable developments and doesnt manage to involve or amuse.\n\nMany times Allen casts an actor as a stand-in for himself. Oddly, even though Woody appears in the flick, Scoop does that as well. Im not sure if Sondra is supposed to be a Woody doppelganger, but she comes across that way. Unfortunately, Johansson doesnt do well in the part. Its odd enough to see a busty blonde Woody, but the part fails to fit Johanssons talents. She doesnt pull off the quirkiness necessary for the part. Sure, we can easily believe that Lyman will fall for super-hot Sondra, but Johanssons attempts to create a goofy, semi-nerdy character falls flat.\n\nThat goes for most elements of Scoop. It doesnt create a painful 96 minutes, but it does nothing especially well. It just meanders as it progresses toward its inevitable conclusion.\n\nScoop appears in an aspect ratio of approximately 1.85:1 on this single-sided, double-layered DVD; the image has been enhanced for 16X9 televisions. Only some minor issues popped up through this pretty good transfer.\n\nSmall concerns connected to sharpness. The movie occasionally came across as a smidgen soft and ill-defined. Those instances occurred infrequently, though, and the flick was usually detailed and concise. No jagged edges or shimmering occurred, but some light edge enhancement was apparent. I noticed no signs of source flaws.\n\nColors appeared good. The movie went with a full, warm palette much of the time, and it depicted the hues with nice definition. They were always rich and dynamic. Blacks seemed deep and firm, while shadows were fairly clear. Overall, this turned into a satisfying transfer.\n\nAs always, Woody Allen refuses to acknowledge the existence of multi-channel audio, so Scoop offered only a monaural soundtrack. The mix seemed typical and greatly resembled the audio for many other Allen movies. Dialogue was consistently intelligible and natural, and I heard no concerns related to edginess. Effects came across as accurate and distinct, though they didnt stand out as anything memorable. Since the movie never used loud elements, that wasnt an issue.\n\nThe score - which consisted entirely of classical recordings - was acceptable. I thought the music seemed clear but not very dynamic. Those elements stayed subdued. Overall, the track was passable and that was about it.\n\nA few ads open the DVD. We get a promo for Focus Features as well as trailers for Hollywoodland. And thats all she wrote, as no other extras appear here.\n\nAfter the involving Match Point, Woody Allens Scoop comes across as a lightweight piece of fluff. I dont mind that Allen went for something less intense as a follow-up to Match Point, but Scoop feels like something he thought up and wrote in a lazy afternoon. The DVD presents very good picture along with passable mono sound and no real extras. Thin and predictable, Scoop is forgettable Woody."
