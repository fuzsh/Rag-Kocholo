        "text": "God, I cannot wait for this film. This trailer looks so fantastic. The film, released by Fox Searchlight, is due out November 23rd.\n\nAnthony Hopkins is clearly gonna be in the front-running for Best Actor this awards season, as his portrayal of Hitch seems to be spot on.\n\nHelen Mirren also appears to be at the top of her game as Hitch’s wife Alma.\n\nI’m not the hugest Scarlet Johansson fan, but she at least looks a lot like Janet Leigh.\n\nWhat I am most exited for, though, is Michael Stuhlbarg’s take on Hollywood dynamo Lew Wasserman. Yes. Good.\n\nYou can watch the new trailer here:\n\n41.487115 -120.542456\n\nI first saw this movie in 2010 in preparation for the release of Sofia Coppola’s Somewhere (a film that I love dearly), but I wasn’t really sold on its merit at that time. I think some of that had to do with my dislike of Scarlett Johansson (I’m warming up to her a bit these days, but I could still take her or leave her). However, with every rewatch of this film I find more things to love about it. It’s kind of a distant film, but when you warm up to it, or rather it warms up to you, you’ll find it’s a real gem. The film was nominated for four Academy Awards, winning one: Best Original Screenplay (won), Best Actor Bill Murray, Best Director and Best Picture. The other films up for Best Picture that year were Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World, Mystic River, Seabiscuit and winner The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.\n\nRead the rest of this entry →\n\n41.487115 -120.542456\n\nSo here we are, the last decade of Woody Allen’s directorial filmography (you can see my first three post here, here and here). I am going to be honest right away and say that I pretty much hate and/or dislike all of these films. Okay, maybe not all. There is one that I actually like and three that I thought were “okay,” but the rest I either dislike or downright hate. So my discussions of them are not going to be very long because frankly I don’t want to waste my time writing about them. Feel free to disagree all you want, but that’s just how I feel about it. Also, don’t forget about the Woody Allen Blogathon on Friday!\n\nRead the rest of this entry →\n\n41.487115 -120.542456\n\nThis list was a lot harder to come up with because most of the actresses I like/consider to be great at their craft are Oscar nominees or winners. I was thinking perhaps the reason there are less underrated actresses is because there are less great roles for actresses and thus less actresses are able to really shine. That being said I did come up with a list of 20 contemporary actresses who have never been nominated that I think have given at least one Oscar-worthy performance, if not filled their career with them.\n\nRead the rest of this entry →\n\n41.487115 -120.542456"
