        "text": "Lost In Translation – Made\n\nAn actress familiar to us all now, at the age of 28 it has not taken Scarlett Johansson long to become a global superstar, not just in the acting department but also in the world of fashion and even music.\n\nSince her roll in Sophia Coppala’s ‘Lost In Translation’ she has gone on to work with distinguished actors and directors and being nominated for four Golden Globes as she made the transition from a promising child actor to worldwide phenomenon.\n\nAn Unlikely Match\n\nJohansson was cast as Charlotte; recently married to a celebrity photographer who is noticeably mistreating his wife by not giving her enough attention or love. The film is based around Charlotte’s relationship with Bob Harris (Bill Murray) who plays a married, American movie star on the decline.\n\nA very simple but effective plot sees these two characters create a bond we as the public all understand and is acted in such a way that both Johansson and Murray both won worldwide critical acclaim.\n\nCoppala admitted that she wrote the film with Bill Murray in mind, however, after this film Johansson’s career took off. She was only 18 at the time of filming but the casting of Murray ensured that his professionalism and ability as an established actor safeguarded Johansson’s inexperience.\n\nHer part was very natural; simplistic scenes and lines, awkward but amusing humour and most importantly, an understanding between the two despite the gulf in acting experience.\n\nWhat was most impressive though is how she added her own input. For example; the kiss between Charlotte and Bob during their final goodbye was not scripted, it was totally impulsive.\n\nInstead of playing it safe she did what all good actors do and played the moment; not afraid to push boundaries to try and improve the scene (which is turn she did as Coppala left the kiss in the final cut).\n\nIn the same year she also won critical acclaim for her part in ‘Girl With The Pearl Earring’ resulting in many tipping her for an Oscar suggestion but it wasn’t to be, instead she was up for another Golden Globe and this teenagers career had now well and truly began to blossom.\n\nGlobal Recognition\n\nJohansson was now being cast in roles written for actress’s way above her age and experience. She was given the lead part in the 2005 sci-fi, thriller ‘The Island’, alongside Ewan McGregor not long after being cast as Nola Rice in Woody Allen’s Oscar nominated ‘Match Point’.\n\nAgain, Johansson was cast to play a pretty American girl, mistreated by men, a roll she has seemed to have perfected. It was a very mature performance by Johansson in this film and she does manage to make us all feel apologetic for her characters plight.\n\nWoody Allen described this as his favourite film of his own and praised Johansson’s versatility in the part. He also described Johansson; during the filming of ‘Match Point’, as “sexually overwhelming”, saying that he found it “very hard to be extra witty around a sexually overwhelming, beautiful young woman who is wittier than you are.”\n\nThe parts kept on calling and non-so bigger that Christopher Nolan’s ‘The Prestige’. Probably the biggest film Johansson has appeared in to date, even though she did not win any awards for her part as Olivia Wenscombe; a magician’s assistant, she got to star alongside some big names.\n\nMichael Caine, Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and future co-star on ‘Vicky Cristina Barcelona’ Rebecca Hall all had major roles on this film with even David Bowie making an appearance.\n\nSex Symbol\n\nBy now Johansson had become a worldwide sex symbol as well as an extremely respected movie star. Johansson appeared on the cover of the March 2006 issue of ‘Vanity Fair’ in the nude, a stark change to when Johansson had to be convinced by Coppala to shoot scenes in her underwear!\n\n‘Maxim’ named Johansson No. 6 in their Hot 100 Issue in 2006 No. 3 in 2007,and No. 2 in 2008. In November 2006, Johansson was named “Sexiest Woman Alive” by ‘Esquire’. In February 2007, she was named the “Sexiest Celebrity” of the year by ‘Playboy’.\n\nWoody Allen went on to cast Johansson again in his 2008 film; ‘Vicky Cristina Barcelona’. Generally well received, it is probably the last best film she has appeared in.\n\nShe played an adventurous young woman who is enticed by Javier Bardem and is eventually caught up in conflicts of revulsion and lust with Bardem’s ex-wife Penélope Cruz (who incidentally won an Oscar for her role in this film).\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nBefore the release of ‘Vicky Cristina Barcelona’, Johansson had also released her debut album; ‘Anywhere I Lay My Head’. Although it received mixed reviews many music sites gave it praise. NME rated the album eight out of ten, calling it “brilliant” and writing that “just like Lou Reed with Nico and Serge Gainsbourg with Brigitte Bardot, Sitek has effortlessly translated Johansson’s magnetism on to record”.\n\nShe had also previously appeared in Justin Timberlake’s music video “What Goes Around… Comes Around” which was also a success.\n\nIf you want flexibility, Scarlett Johansson is your woman. In many ways she has made it in three different areas of show business and whilst some of it may be down simply to her frightening sex appeal, there is no doubt that Johansson had a burning desire to succeed and a confidence to deliver a convincing spectacle in a difficult role. ‘Lost In Translation’ is Johansson at her, natural, beautiful and innocent best, a stunning film that kick started a golden period for Johansson."
