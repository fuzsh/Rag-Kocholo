        "text": "From an early age, Scarlett Johansson was determined to make it as an actress, going through the classic journey of entertaining family members as a kid before moving on to progressively larger stages. Today, Johansson entertains on a global scale and holds the distinction of being the highest-grossing actress ever.\n\nJohansson got her first starring role at 12-years-old in the dark road comedy Manny & Lo, and it was only four years later she got the indie cred double whammy with Ghost World and The Man Who Wasn’t There. Lost in Translation, Sofia Coppola’s melancholic drama of drifting romantic souls, made her a household name. Next came a brief stint as Woody Allen’s muse in Match Point, Vicky Cristina Barcelona, and Scoop.\n\nJohansson joined the MCU as Black Widow in Iron Man 2, and has been a steady participant since, leading into Avengers: Endgame and side story Black Widow. She also received critical acclaim recently for Jojo Rabbit and Marriage Story. Take a look at every Scarlett Johansson movie ranked by Tomatometer! —Alex Vo\n\n#47\n\nThe Spirit (2008) 14%\n\n#47\n\nAdjusted Score: 18179%\n\nCritics Consensus: Though its visuals are unique, The Spirit's plot is almost incomprehensible, the dialogue is ludicrously mannered, and the characters are unmemorable.\n\nSynopsis: Apparently murdered cop Denny Colt (Gabriel Macht) returns as the Spirit, dedicated to protecting Central City from crime.
