        "text": "Originally titled “Project Artemis,” Apple Studios’ original space-race rom-com is now known as “Fly Me To The Moon.” Directed by Greg Berlanti (“Love, Simon,” and the overseer of the CW’s Arrowverse), the 1960s space film star Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum. Not much has been known about the movie until today, but today, Apple’s distributor, Sony Pictures, released the first trailer for the film, pulling back some of the curtain and details.\n\nREAD MORE: The 100 Most Anticipated Films Of 2024\n\nThe film co-stars three-time Academy Award nominee Woody Harrelson (“True Detective”), Ray Romano (“Everbody Loves Raymond”), Jim Rash (“Community,” “The Way Way Back”), Colin Woodell (“The Continental”), Donald Elise Watkins (“Emergency”) Noah Robbins (“Brighton Beach Memoirs”), Anna Garcia, Nick Dillenburg and Christian Zuber and more.\n\nWritten by Rose Gilroy, the daughter of Rene Russo and “Nightcrawler” filmmaker Dan Gilroy, the film is based on a story by Keenan Flynn and Bill Kirstein.\n\nHere’s the official synopsis:\n\nStarring Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum, FLY ME TO THE MOON is a sharp, stylish comedy-drama set against the high-stakes backdrop of NASA’s historic Apollo 11 moon landing. Brought in to fix NASA’s public image, sparks fly in all directions as marketing maven Kelly Jones (Johansson) wreaks havoc on launch director Cole Davis’s (Tatum) already difficult task. When the White House deems the mission too important to fail, Jones is directed to stage a fake moon landing as back-up and the countdown truly begins…\n\n“Fly Me To The Moon” went through some changes over the years. Originally, it was set to be directed by Jason Bateman (“Ozark”) and meant to be a reunion for Scarlett Johansson and fellow Marvel star Chris Evans. Evans and Bateman eventually dropped out, but Johansson and Tatum is certainly an interesting pairing. Berlanti is known for directing rom-coms like “The Broken Hearts Club,” and “Life as We Know It,” but he is also more recognized as a powerhouse TV producer, having overseen all of the former DC Comics projects that lived on The CW like “Supergirl,” “The Flash,” “Titans” and “Doom Patrol.”"
