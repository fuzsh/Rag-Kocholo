        "text": "Actress Scarlett Johansson stars in a new short film set to Bob Dylan's new song \"When The Deal Goes Down,\" which premiered on AOL yesterday and will be widely released online and to video channels today. Directed by Academy Award nominee Bennett Miller (Capote), the silent film was shot on 8mm and takes place in the early 1960s. Clues connecting the film's scenes to Bob Dylan's early career are creatively placed throughout the piece.\n\nThe film has been released in conjunction with Bob Dylan's new album, Modern Times, which was released Tuesday to massive critical acclaim. Rolling Stone declared it \"his third straight masterwork\" and awarded the album its highest rating of 5 stars. The Los Angeles Times called Dylan \"our living Rosetta Stone, his songs carrying forth the essence of a thousand blues and folk classics, connecting the canonical and the folkloric to the present day.\"\n\nBob Dylan is currently on his third annual tour of minor league baseball stadiums. His weekly XM Satellite Radio show, \"Theme Time Radio Hour,\" debuted in May and has quickly become one of that network's most popular programs, with a weekly audience of more than 1.7 million listeners.\n\nModern Times is Bob Dylan's 44th album, following Time Out Of Mind and \"Love And Theft\", which have been among his most commercially successful and critically lauded. Each of those albums has sold more than a million copies in the U.S. and earned Grammy nominations for Album Of The Year (Time Out Of Mind won that award in 1998).\n\nSOURCE: Columbia Records\n\nCONTACT: Claire Mercuri, Columbia Records, New York, +1-212-833-5121,\n\nClaire.Mercuri@sonybmg.com"
