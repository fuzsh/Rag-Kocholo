        "text": "Keep reading to see how it felt working out like Johansson and Pugh, and which super-powered regimen I preferred.\n\nDay 1: I started my experiment with a Johansson-inspired routine\n\nFrom previous experience, I know that training for a superhero role is no easy feat, but I was as prepared as I could be for a week of trying Johansson's routine.\n\nSomething I've learned from trying different workouts is that no matter how strong I think I am, stepping out of my comfort zone always keeps my muscles guessing.\n\nEric Johnson, cofounder of Homage Fitness and the personal trainer Johansson worked with for past Avengers films, told Harper's Bazaar in 2019 that he and the actress treated her training process like that of \"an athlete preparing for competition,\" so I knew I had my work cut out for me.\n\nJohnson said one of the many ways Johansson got herself in incredible shape for these films is by lifting weights, so for my first workout of the week, I kept things pretty simple with a traditional, full-body strength-training sequence.\n\nAfter warming up for a few minutes, I started with three sets of 10 snatch squats, in which you begin in a squatted position, lift the weights overhead as you stand, and lower your dumbbells again to complete a full squat.\n\nI started with medium-weight dumbbells and am only used to basic snatches, so the added squat really had my legs burning.\n\nThen I performed three sets of 10 bicep curls, overhead presses, chest flies, and tricep kickbacks, and by the final round, I was breathing heavily. I immediately wondered if I was going too hard on my first day and thought about how sore I'd feel tomorrow.\n\nDay 2: This gymnastics-inspired bodyweight workout was tougher than I expected\n\nI woke up more sore than I expected from yesterday's strength workout, so I figured I'd ditch the dumbbells and mainly do bodyweight exercises for today's routine.\n\nJohnson told The Hollywood Reporter in 2019 that he incorporated gymnastics-inspired moves into Johansson's workouts, so I did some research and found a similar bodyweight routine that consisted of exercises, like hollow holds and jackknifes, that work the core.\n\nFrom there I did three sets of bear planks with kickbacks to simultaneously work my upper and lower body, push-up-to-plank jackknifes, and L holds, maintaining each exercise for 30 seconds.\n\nI always underestimate just how tough bodyweight moves can be — I definitely used muscles I never worked before during today's workout.\n\nDay 3: I improvised with a portable heater for today's yoga workout\n\nSince I worked out my full body the past two days, I woke up sore all over.\n\nJohansson's regimen reportedly also involves hot yoga, so I was excited to give my body a much-needed rest on the mat.\n\nAs a big fan of hot yoga, I was eager to stream a class by my favorite studio for today's workout, setting the mood by turning on my portable heater so my muscles could relax in the somewhat warm room.\n\nThe 45-minute workout consisted of moves that flowed from downward dog to warrior pose to pigeon.\n\nSome poses hurt more than others due to my sore muscles, but overall, I was sweaty and feeling much more relaxed and loosened up by the end of the workout.\n\nDay 4: This workout using resistance bands and sliders left my muscles shaking\n\nI was feeling great after yesterday's yoga routine and ready to kick up the intensity for today's workout.\n\nJohnson said he incorporates pilates into Johansson's routine to figure out her muscle weaknesses, specifically SLT classes — a typically 50-minute session that combines cardio, strength training, and toning.\n\nRelated stories\n\nI love pilates and how the moves make me feel, so I was excited for today's workout, but since I don't have an SLT studio near me, I did my own routine.\n\nI whipped out my sliders to do three 12-rep sets of moves like plank-to-pikes, plank crunches with a twist, hamstring curls, and platform lunges, and my muscles were shaking by the second set of each exercise.\n\nAfter wiping my sweat with a towel and taking a water break, I took out my resistance bands and began working my upper body with the lighter ones.\n\nI couldn't get over how much my muscles were shaking and how intense the burn was. After doing a few 12-rep sets of each exercise, I decided to stretch and call it a day.\n\nDay 5: Today's HIIT-style workout was one of the toughest so far\n\nI was dreading this next workout since my body was already feeling tired from this week, but I drank some iced coffee, put on a great playlist, and pushed myself to get through today's intense plyometrics routine.\n\nConsisting of alternating explosive movements and rest, high-intensity interval training, or HIIT, can leave me feeling winded and tired fairly easily, so I knew today's session would be a tough one.\n\nHarper's Bazaar reported that medicine-ball throws, core work, and bear crawls are all moves Johansson regularly does in the gym to prepare for her superhero role, so I followed suit.\n\nI began with bodyweight squats to warm up my muscles before taking things to the next level with a series of squat jumps, burpees, and dumbbell swings that I performed in place of medicine-ball throws.\n\nAfter three 45-second rounds of each move, I had to take a breather and towel off. Once my heart rate was down a bit, I moved on to squat jumps, skiers, and burpee bear crawls, which were surprisingly tough on my quads.\n\nThis was definitely one of the more intense workouts of the week so far.\n\nDay 6: I was feeling sore but strong at this point\n\nAlthough I normally don't enjoy doing full-body sessions, Johansson's workouts were so versatile that my muscles felt like they were being challenged each day.\n\nFor the second to last day following a Johansson-inspired routine, I opted for more strength training, increasing my weight from 15 to 20 pounds since I was feeling good.\n\nTo work my upper body, I did three sets of 12 bicep curls, military presses (a move that Johansson reportedly favors), tricep kickbacks, and push-ups in place of pull-ups.\n\nMy heart rate was way up from this sequence, and after the third set of the last exercise, I was ready to work my lower body with deadlifts, squats, reverse lunges, and curtsy lunges.\n\nAlthough my legs were shaking by the last exercise, I felt really strong and was proud of myself for lifting heavier weights. I barely made it through the last rep before dropping my dumbbells and laying on my yoga mat for a few minutes to catch my breath.\n\nDay 7: Today's yoga routine and walk were much needed\n\nBy the last day of this week, my body was tired from head to toe, but I felt really accomplished about how hard I worked.\n\nTo give my sore muscles some much-needed rest, I looked up a yoga workout online and did a slow 30-minute routine. And since it was so nice out, I then put on my headphones and went for a walk around my neighborhood.\n\nI sometimes forget just how important recovery is and was happy I allowed my muscles to rest before starting Pugh's workout routine.\n\nWeek 2, day 1: I forgot how much fun dance workouts could be\n\nAccording to my research, Pugh's routine was very different from Johansson's, which I was happy to learn since my muscles just stopped being sore from all the weight training I did last week.\n\nPugh told Elle Canada in 2020 that she grew up dancing and appreciates exercises that require focusing on your movement.\n\nFollowing suit, I signed up for a virtual 305 Fitness dance-cardio class for my first workout of the week. I'm typically a fan of lifting heavy weights, so I was proud of myself for trying something different.\n\nBy the time the class ended, I was out of breath and dripping with sweat.\n\nDay 2: I worked leg muscles I didn't know I had during a kickboxing session\n\nIn a 2020 episode of Sue Perkins' podcast, Pugh said that to prepare for her \"Black Widow\" role, she worked with trainer James Shields and started her days with two hours of kickboxing.\n\nRelated stories\n\nSo after waking up and stretching my body a bit, I quickly looked online to find a session I could easily stream and follow along to.\n\nI completed a 30-minute PopSugar Fitness kickboxing workout that relied on bodyweight, but since I felt guilty for only exercising for a fourth of Pugh's usual two-hour session, I streamed another similar routine that incorporated more abs.\n\nThe two workouts consisted of a lot of front and side kicking, some punching, and cardio moves like jumping jacks, burpees, planks, and high knees.\n\nBy the end of this hour workout, my arms felt like jelly and my clothes were drenched in sweat — I couldn't believe Pugh kickboxed for as long as she did.\n\nDay 3: I got into full superhero mode during today's boxing workout\n\nI woke up surprisingly sore in my legs from all of the front and side kicks I did in yesterday's workout, but after a light stretch on my yoga mat, I geared up for today's session.\n\nWhile on the podcast, Pugh explained that combat training was a big part of her workout regimen for her \"Black Widow\" role, so after her kickboxing session with her trainer, she'd then work with a stunt coordinator to prepare for her fight scenes.\n\nI tried to think of what workout I could do that would somewhat resemble combat training and figured a boxing session would allow me to work on a fighter stance and throw some punches.\n\nI streamed a 45-minute workout from one of my favorite studios and spent the majority of the class throwing different punch combinations and doing defensive moves, like ducking and slipping.\n\nI had to take a few breaks throughout the workout since the different punching combos wore me out, but I kept at it, and by the end of the class, my arms felt like noodles.\n\nDay 4: I listened to my body and did some yoga\n\nKnowing Pugh said that she purposely did workouts that made her \"look good while moving the body,\" I figured yoga would be the perfect way to embrace fluid motions. So, I put music on and let my muscles do what felt best.\n\nThe many downward dogs, puppy poses, plank holds, forward bends, and hip stretches I did felt great after all of those grueling workouts I'd completed.\n\nI'm used to following an online class or routine when I practice yoga, so just listening to my body was a nice change.\n\nDay 5: I kicked things up a notch by adding weights\n\nI really wanted to keep my week of following Pugh's \"Black Widow\" fitness routine very true to what she did, so I continued with fight-style exercises for today's workout.\n\nSince most of these sessions had relied on bodyweight, I wanted to ramp things up a bit and add dumbbells to today's kickboxing routine.\n\nI streamed another kickboxing session that was a little more intense than the other day's, as it barely allowed for any breaks. It kept my heart rate up for the duration of the workout, and my chest burned after what felt like my 100th kick.\n\nAfter the workout ended, I took a few sips of water, toweled off, then began a weight-training sequence that consisted of simultaneous upper- and lower-body moves like squats into an overhead presses, lunges with a rotation, and push-ups into low squats.\n\nThe entire workout lasted about 90 minutes, and I definitely pushed myself hard during today's session.\n\nDay 6: I surprised myself by going on a run\n\nI was surprisingly sore from the past few days of bodyweight workouts. Although I'm an active person and my workout of choice is strength training, I rarely do the type of exercises that I'd been focusing on this week, so that explained my aching inner and outer thighs and upper back.\n\nI decided to use today as a cardio session to get the blood flowing and help get rid of some of the soreness in my legs, and since the weather was beautiful, I did something out of my comfort zone and went for a run.\n\nI hate running but didn't want to slow down the intensity at this point in the week by walking around my neighborhood, so I laced up my sneakers, put in my headphones, and just went for it.\n\nI only did 2 miles but was thrilled once that lap was over.\n\nDay 7: I ended this week the same way I started it\n\nTo end this week of trying Pugh's workouts on a high note, I signed up for a FORWARD_Space class that was divided into intervals of dance cardio and conditioning using 2- to 4-pound weights.\n\nThe instructor, music, and overall vibe of the class was so fun and different than other dance routines I'd tried before, so this session was the perfect way to end this long week of Pugh-inspired workouts.\n\nAfter reflecting on the past couple of weeks, I decided that I prefer Johansson's routine over Pugh's\n\nThe past two weeks of workouts were quite different from any other celebrity battles I've tried, and although Johansson's routine was more up my alley than Pugh's, I still gave both regimens my all.\n\nIn addition to enjoying the workouts Johansson did to prepare for her role, I was familiar with a lot of the strength-training exercises she used, so the actress' routine was easier to follow.\n\nOn the other hand, Pugh's regimen was a bit vaguer since the actress seemingly didn't follow such a planned-out routine and instead perfected her body movements for fight scenes by working with stunt trainers and focusing on kickboxing workouts.\n\nI still was sore from both actress' routines, and even though Pugh's mainly relied on bodyweight, I underestimated just how tough her kickboxing workouts would be. I respected her focus on exercises that made her look and feel strong during intense, action-packed scenes.\n\nBoth routines were tough in their own way, and I give a lot of credit to both Johansson and Pugh for working as hard as they did to prepare for their Marvel roles."
