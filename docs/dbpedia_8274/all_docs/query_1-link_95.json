        "text": "Woody Allen returns to London in his latest comedy “Scoop”. His last film, the critically acclaimed London-based “Match Point” saw a departure, of sorts, for Allen. The film veered away from his usually lighthearted comedic fare, in the direction of a morality tale in the garbs of a thriller. But, for those of us who enjoy the writer-director’s comedic flair a little more, he follows up “Match Point” with a delightful murder-mystery that should please his many fans.\n\nIan McShane (from HBO’S “Deadwood”) plays Joe Strombel, a legendary London newspaper reporter who we learn has died from coronary thrombosis. The film opens with his funeral, and then with his newspaper buddies gathered in a pub reminiscing about the kind of reporter Joe was. We then see Strombel for the first time, sailing on a foggy night, in a boat steered by the Grim Reaper. It is assumed they are headed for whatever eternity awaits them; Joe asks the Grim Reaper where they are going, evens tries to bribe him for the answer, but Grim doesn’t say a word. Joe then strikes up conversation with one of the other passengers, who informs him that she believes her death was caused by a poisoning. This wouldn’t normally be a big deal, but she adds that the person who killed her may have been the famous London aristocrat Peter Lyman (Hugh Jackman).\n\nShe believes that Lyman killed her because she figured out that he was the infamous “Tarot Card Killer” who had been preying on London prostitutes for quite some time. Strombel recognizes this as a big scoop for a potentially groundbreaking story, and finds a way to jump ship in order to inform a living reporter of the details.\n\nThat reporter is Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson). Pransky is at the magic show of third-rate vaudevillian “The Great Splendini,” otherwise known as Sidney Waterman (Woody Allen). Splendini calls her up onstage where he puts her in the “Dematerializer,” a large box which he promises will split her atoms (and so forth) and return her intact. While inside the box, Pransky is visited by Strombel, who informs her of all the juicy details regarding the “Tarot Card Killer.” He tells her who he thinks the killer is, and how important it is that she break the story if she can find enough evidence against the wealthy Lyman.\n\nPransky is in shock over the event, and returns the following day to ask Splendini/Waterman about the apparition. Waterman doesn’t believe her, until Strombel appears to both of them, prodding Pransky to get moving on the story. Pransky recruits Waterman to go along on the investigation, where they meet Lyman, and try to uncover evidence of his guilt in the killings. Along the way, complications arise when Lyman and Pransky take a shining to each other, and when the bumbling detectives’ plans begin to unravel.\n\nI guess it should be noted right off that I am a very big fan of Woody Allen’s comedies. I know he is most famous for the ones he released quite some time ago, but I have very much enjoyed the lightweight comedies he has given us over the past ten years or so. I enjoy his neurotic twitching and stuttering, and his brilliant delivery of lines that most others could never pull off. If Allen irritates you, if in your opinion Allen’s neurotic behavior becomes tedious, then “Scoop” might not be your kind of movie.\n\nThe performances in the film are all outstanding. I was not very familiar with the work of Ian McShane, but he is excellent in his supporting role as the reporter seeking his last big scoop. Woody Allen is exactly as we expect him to be—funny, insecure, bumbling—and he delivers another fine performance. Scarlett Johansson is the perfect choice to play opposite Allen; her bumbling simpleton reporter makes a great pair with Allen’s aging magician. And Hugh Jackman is smooth as ever, as the squeaky-clean aristocrat who may or may not have something to hide.\n\nUnfortunately, though, “Scoop” contains some elements that taint it for Christian audiences. There are a number of profane uses of the Lord’s name, as well as one or two GDs thrown in along the way. All of these words are pointlessly used by the characters, mostly out of frustration, but Christian ears will certainly not take kindly to them.\n\nThere are no sexual scenes in the film; however, sex is implied on more than one occasion. When we first meet Johansson’s character, she is interviewing a famous actor, who apparently gets her in bed in no time. Then, it doesn’t take long for her to jump in the sack with Lyman. Her character is a fairly well-written one, which is why such promiscuous and un-Godly behavior seems out of place. She, as well as another character, display cleavage during a few scenes, and is seen in nothing, but a towel, a few times.\n\nThere isn’t much violence to speak of—all of the killings occur off-screen. Some may be offended by the scene of the souls being shipped off to eternity by the Grim Reaper, although these scenes are not scary and are played for laughs. The film makes no mention of Heaven or Hell, and doesn’t seem too concerned with where exactly the souls are being shipped off to. Perhaps a scene like this could be used as a springboard into a discussion on salvation and eternal life by those Christians who may view this film with non-Christian friends. As always, though, parents are urged to look into this film and its content before allowing children to see it, although I doubt many children will be asking.\n\nStrictly as a movie, I really liked “Scoop”; I just wish it could have done without some of the afore-mentioned content. To be honest, I laughed out loud and more often than I have at any other movie that has come into theaters lately. I loved the ending, even though I must admit I was surprised a bit by it, and even it had me laughing to myself. I left the theater smiling, which doesn’t happen too often. But, I recognize that there are those who will be bored, or annoyed with Allen’s comedic tendencies. If you have seen his more recent comedies like “Curse of the Jade Scorpion” or “Small Time Crooks”, then know to expect more of that same kind of humor. So, if you didn’t like those, chances are you may think I am foolish (like most people apparently thought of me after my last review of “Lady in the Water”), for recommending this film. But if you did like them, then “Scoop” may be right up your alley, if you can get past the objectionable content. For me, “Scoop” ranks as an A-.\n\nViolence: Minor / Profanity: Moderate / Sex/Nudity: Moderate"
