        "text": "Quick Thoughts on all the Scarlett Johansson Movies\n\nAn American Rhapsody (2006) – Not only have I not seen the movie, I had never even heard of it before doing this research. Nastassja Kinski also stars in the movie.\n\nThe Avengers (2012) – How can this no be her best movie? Not only is The Avengers her highest grossing movie it is one the highest grossing movies of all time. The 88.7% rating from critics and audiences beats many of the Best Oscar® winning pictures of the past. The only area The Avengers is lacking in is award glory….as it only received one Oscar® nomination.\n\nThe Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) – a good but not great sequel\n\nThe Black Dahlia (2006) – Based on one of the greatest murder mysteries in Hollywood history. The movie is not as good as it could have been….but she plays her part the sexy vixen girlfriend very well….directed by Brian De Palma.\n\nCaptain America: Civil War (2016) – Takes a little while to get started but the airport fight scene is awesome.\n\nCaptain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) – A very entertaining movie….but probably the 5th best Captain America movie.\n\nChef (2014) – A highly enjoyable comedy drama.\n\nDon Jon (2013) – Don Jon is written and directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt….movie is pretty good but not as good as I was hoping for.\n\nEight Legged Freaks (2006) – A very very silly movie but it has a decent moments, just do not look for Oscar® worthy performances in this movie.\n\nFall (1997) – One of her first movies and her part is pretty small.\n\nGirl with a Pearl Earring (2003) – Yet another period piece, but this one has one of her better performances…she actually got a Golden Globe® nomination for her role in this movie. Colin Firth is outstanding as well.\n\nGhost in the Shell (2017) – not as bad as I thought it was going to be…it has some nice moments\n\nGhost World (2001) – I remember when this movie came out and it was getting lots of buzz around it….when I finally saw it I was not that impressed….and I am a huge Steve Buscemi fan and I really wanted to like it.\n\nA Good Woman (2004) – An interesting, though slow moving period piece. Tom Wilkinson is the best part of the movie.\n\nHail Caesar! (2016) Strongly strongly disliked this movie….a huge disappointment.\n\nHer (2013) – This is an excellent film. She only provides the voice….but her presence is amazing in this movie….one of the best movies I have saw in 2013.\n\nHe’s Just Not That Into You (2009) – A pretty big box office hit but not exactly a great movie. The ensemble cast needs more to do.\n\nHitchcock – I really enjoyed watching this movie….Anthony Hopkins is excellent as Hitch and Helen Mirren picked up a Golden Globe® for her performance. Johansson gets the Janet Leigh part.\n\nHome Alone 3 (1997) – Not sure many people even realize there was a third Home Alone movie. Her fourth lowest rated movie according to critics and audiences. She has a small part as one of the sisters of the latest kid to be Home Alone.\n\nThe Horse Whisperer – I recently watched this one. Probably the last great role for Robert Redford. Johansson was only 14 when the movie came out and she shows some serious acting skills at a very young age.\n\nIf Lucy Fell (1996) – I saw this movie many moons ago and I do not remember her part at all.\n\nIn Good Company – One of my favorite Johansson movies. She plays Dennis Quaid’s daughter who gets involved with Quaid’s younger boss, Topher Grace.\n\nIron Man 2 – Her first box office blockbuster and the first time she got to play Natalia Romanova..better known as the Black Widow. My least favorite of the four Iron Man movies but still an entertaining movie.\n\nThe Island (2005) – Director Michael Bay’s lowest performing movie at the box office. I liked this science fiction movie, but not enough to ever watch it for the second time.\n\nThe Jungle Book (2016) – Loved this movie. Great graphics, great story and great voice performances. Too bad her Kaa does not have a bigger part.\n\nJust Cause (1995) – This was the second movie of her career and a very small role as well. Sean Connery has the main role, which is not one of his better roles\n\nLost in Translation – A very well done adult drama with an Oscar® nominated performance from Bill Murray and a Golden Globe® performance by Johansson.\n\nA Love Song For Bobby Long (2004) – Have not seen this movie but she did get a Golden Globe® nomination for her role in the movie.\n\nLucy (2014) – Sadly this was not as good as I thought it would be…starts off strong but fades as the movie progresses.\n\nManny & Lo –This is a movie that is worth trying to find and watch. Johansson is excellent in the movie and even more impressive when you realize it was only her third movie of her career.\n\nThe Man Who Wasn’t There (2001) Box Office: – I am one of the few people to see this movie at the theater, probably the first time I took notice of Scarlett Johansson. This movie seems to be the forgotten movie of directors Joel and Ethan Coen’s career. Billy Bob Thornton is outstanding in a very low key performance.\n\nMatch Point (2005) – The first of three Woody Allen movies that she appeared in. She received a Golden Globe® nomination for this role. The only Woody Allen thriller to date and one to watch.\n\nThe Nanny Diaries (2007) – I actually liked this movie. It has some pretty strong support from Laura Linney and Paul Giamatti as Mr. and Mrs. X.\n\nNorth (1996) – Hard to blame the ten year old girl making her film debut for this mess of a movie. Director Rob Reiner and Bruce Willis do not have the same excuse.\n\nThe Other Boleyn Girl (2008) – Johansson and Natalie Portman play sisters who fall under the spell of Eric Bana who plays Henry VIII. This period piece is pretty interesting….but Portman has the better part.\n\nPerfect Score (2004) – A pretty typical high school comedy…but it is pretty cool to see the future Captain America (Chris Evans) and Black Widow acting together before becoming superheroes.\n\nThe Prestige (2006) – My favorite Johansson movie. Directed by Christopher Nolan, this movie is one that needs to be watched more than one time.\n\nRough Night (2017) – Have not seen this one yet….but I was not impressed with the trailers.\n\nScoop (2006) – Not one of director Woody Allen’s better movies. It was her 2nd of three Woody Allen she starred in, but easily the worst of the three movies.\n\nSing (2016) – Huge hit…but it did not keep me or my kids very entertained.\n\nThe Spirit (2008) – I had high expectations for this movie but I was let down. Compared to Sin City this blue screen movie does not measure up.\n\nSpongeBob Square Pants Movie (2004) – SpongeBob is King! ..though it might take some effort to hear her role.\n\nUnder the Skin – Mmmm….not sure about this one….I was disappointed in this one….but Scarlett is pretty good in the movie…and you have to give her kudos for taking the role.\n\nVicky Cristina – Her third and (so far) final Woody Allen movie. Lots of great roles in this movie…including an Oscar® winning performance by Penelope Cruz.\n\nWe Bought A Zoo (2011) – Matt Damon is the star and Johansson plays the love interest. Based on a true story and a movie the whole family can watch.\n\nCheck out Scarlett Johansson‘s career compared to current and classic actors.
