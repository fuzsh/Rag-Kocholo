        "text": "Actress Born Scarlett Ingrid Johansson on Nov. 22, 1984 in New York, NY\n\nScarlett Johansson's acting career started when she was a child, but it wasn't until she turned 18 that she had her breakout year. In 2003, she garnered rave reviews for two films: âGirl With a Pearl Earring,â sharing the screen with Colin Firth, and Sofia Coppolaâs âLost in Translation,â which earned her the best actress award at the Venice Film Festival.\n\nA New York City native, Johansson began acting for stage and screen at age 8 when her mother took her to auditions. Among her early films were Robert Redfordâs âThe Horse Whisperer,â âHome Alone 3â and âManny & Lo,â which also featured her twin brother, Hunter. Her first film was Rob Reinerâs âNorth.â She graduated from the Professional Childrenâs School in Manhattan in 2002.\n\nShe has worked with director Woody Allen in three of his films, âMatch Point,â âScoopâ and âVicky Cristina Barcelona,â and Christopher Nolan in the period magician drama âThe Prestige.â\n\nShe has also flexed her action-star muscles in Michael Bayâs âThe Islandâ opposite Ewan McGregor as a clone on the run and in âIron Man 2â as Marvel hero Black Widow. She reprised the role in the 2012 ensemble superheroes movie âThe Avengers.â\n\nThe Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. has nominated Johansson for a Golden Globe four times, for her performances in âPearl Earring,â âA Love Song for Bobby Long,â âMatch Pointâ and âLost in Translation,â the last of which also earned her a BAFTA award.\n\nA talent not only in film but also in music, Johansson has released two albums. On her first, âAnywhere I Lay My Head,â she sang covers of Tom Waits songs. Her second, âBreak Up,â released in 2009, was a collaboration with Pete Yorn, her agentâs brother.\n\nNamed by Esquire magazine as the \" Sexiest Woman Alive\" in 2006, Johansson married Canada-born actor Ryan Reynolds in 2008. The couple divorced in 2011.\n\nOutside acting, Johansson is a global ambassador for the anti-poverty coalition Oxfam, as well as for Red, Bonoâs campaign to eliminate AIDS. She also works with Planned Parenthood and USA Harvest/Blessings."
