        "text": "Summary\n\nScarlett Johansson’s range is evident in both indie hits like Lost in Translation and blockbuster films like Avengers: Endgame.\n\nJohansson’s career-defining roles include her work in critically acclaimed films like Her and her standout performances in Marvel movies.\n\nJohansson’s versatility shines in her diverse filmography.\n\nScarlett Johansson has become a household name and is widely loved among audiences of many genres. Johansson’s movies include both understated dramas like Marriage Story and action-packed sweeping epics like Avengers: Endgame. Her filmography features an impressive range of genre-defining and record-breaking movies.\n\nJohansson has grown in popularity significantly over the years. Recognized as an indie star from Lost in Translation in the early 2000s, she has since become one of her generation’s most reliable box office draws. Johansson’s work in the Marvel universe proves she isn’t afraid to be a part of a wider ensemble, a mentality that’s served her well in a variety of roles. While the actress has appeared sporadically on TV, typically in voice roles, her film appearances have come to define her career.\n\n20 The Other Boleyn Girl (2008)\n\nMary Boleyn\n\nWhile The Other Boleyn Girl is one of a few historical dramas in Johansson’s filmography – and noteworthy as a result – the movie received mixed reviews from critics. The film is ambitious in its adaptation of the original book, The Other Boleyn Girl by Philippa Gregory, and features a talented cast alongside Johansson including Natalie Portman and Benedict Cumberbatch. However, despite its merits, the response makes it far from Johansson’s most successful film.\n\n19 We Bought a Zoo (2011)\n\nKelly Foster\n\nWe Bought a Zoo was a hit when released in 2011. It’s a staple among family-friendly movies and worked very well for its time. The heartfelt story may have been well-received by audiences, but when compared to other films in Johansson’s portfolio, there are plenty that outshine it and make it look slightly bland in comparison.\n\n18 Hail, Caesar! (2016)\n\nDeeAnna Moran\n\nHail, Caesar! is another period film for Johansson and takes place in the 1950s. It’s also directed by the Coen Brothers, which already gives it some points. There are some iconic scenes in the film that feature Johansson – for example, the one where she swims in a mermaid-themed ballet. The enthusiasm she brings to the role certainly makes Hail, Caesar! stand out. However, the movie isn’t as well-known as some of Johansson’s other work.\n\n17 Ghost World (2001)\n\nRebecca\n\nJohansson’s portrayal of Rebecca in Ghost World is both hilarious and perfect for the film. As one of the two lead characters alongside Thora Birch’s Enid, Johansson is essential to the movie. While Ghost World is slightly obscure compared to some of Johansson’s other films, it had a massive impact on the actress’ future, defining her career in indie films, which eventually led to her success in Lost In Translation.\n\n16 Asteroid City (2023)\n\nMidge Campbell\n\nWes Anderson’s 2023 film Asteroid City was widely discussed ahead of its release because of its star-studded cast, featuring actors like Tom Hanks, Bryan Cranston, Adrien Brody, Tilda Swinton, and more. However, the movie itself isn’t Anderson’s best, despite largely positive reviews. However, as always, Johansson brings her all to her role and executes it perfectly even though it’s not a large part.\n\n15 Lucy (2014)\n\nLucy Miller\n\nLucy truly is one of Johansson’s biggest roles, even if on the lower side popularity-wise. As Lucy, Johansson is front and center for pretty much the entire film. In 2014, an action role like this came after audiences saw her as Black Widow in Iron Man 2 and The Avengers. However, as Johansson was part of a larger ensemble in those movies, Lucy offers a peak at what she would be capable of when she led Black Widow seven years later.\n\n14 Fly Me to the Moon (2024)\n\nKelly Jones\n\nFly Me to the Moon is one of Johansson’s newest films, where she stars alongside Channing Tatum. The movie takes place in the 1960s as NASA prepares for the Apollo 11 moon landing. It’s a fun role for Johansson, and with its historical and romantic comedy elements, combines multiple genres she’s excelled at in the past.\n\n13 Chef (2014)\n\nMolly\n\nChef is written and directed by Jon Favreau, who also stars in the film. It’s definitely a smaller movie for Johansson thanks to her more minor role. However, Chef received positive reviews, and it also serves as a fun reunion for Favreau, Johansson, and Robert Downey Jr., as all three worked together on Iron Man 2.\n\n12 Under the Skin (2013)\n\n“The Female”\n\nUnder the Skin is an A24 film directed by Jonathan Glazer that was released in 2013. It provides Johansson with one of her most unique roles, as she plays an extraterrestrial in Scotland, showing off her incredible range in the process. Although the film is exciting for how different it is from some of Johansson’s other works, it is not very well known, especially when comparing other films that she has starred in.\n\n11 The Man Who Wasn’t There (2001)\n\nBirdy Abundas\n\nThe Man Who Wasn’t There is another Coen Brothers film for Johansson, releasing 15 years before Hail, Caesar! The movie stands out thanks to its retro crime noir vibes and was notably converted to black-and-white, making it all the more impressive. Although not as well known as some of Johansson’s other movies, it’s certainly one of her most original.\n\n10 Isle of Dogs (2018)\n\nNutmeg\n\nIsle of Dogs is a stop-motion animated film by Wes Anderson, released five years before Johansson and Anderson worked together on Asteroid City. Johansson has done a fair amount of voice acting in her career, including in 2013’s Her. Her skills are on full display in Isle of Dogs, and the movie is also aided by the sheer fun of getting to see another stop-motion film by Anderson after Fantastic Mr. Fox.\n\n9 The Prestige (2006)\n\nOlivia Wenscombe\n\nLike many of Johansson’s films, The Prestige boasts an impressive team both behind and in front of the camera, with Christopher Nolan directing and Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman starring alongside Johansson. When it released in 2006, The Prestige earned acclaim, including Academy Award nominations. It’s also another interesting mashup of genres for Johansson, thanks to its period setting of Edwardian London and magical sci-fi touches. While not Johansson’s most well-known film, critical response to The Prestige proves it’s one of her best.\n\n​​​​​​​\n\n8 Captain America: Civil War (2016)\n\nNatasha Romanoff / Black Widow\n\nCaptain America: Civil War marks Johansson’s fifth time playing Black Widow. While Civil War was a massive success for Marvel both critically and financially, Johansson has a bigger role in other MCU films, which also broke more box office records.\n\n​​​​​​​\n\n7 Avengers: Infinity War (2018)\n\nNatasha Romanoff / Black Widow\n\nAvengers: Infinity War was incredibly successful upon its release in 2018, making over $2 billion by the end of its run and changing the MCU forever with Thanos’ snap. Like Captain America: Civil War, Infinity War features a relatively small part for Johansson thanks to its large ensemble cast, However, it does set her up for a major role in Avengers: Endgame thanks to Black Widow’s survival at the end of the film.\n\n6 Black Widow (2021)\n\nNatasha Romanoff / Black Widow\n\nIt’s hard to talk about Johansson’s expansive work in the MCU without mentioning Black Widow, which saw her character finally step into a leading role. Black Widow was a casualty of the pandemic, as it was delayed repeatedly before releasing simultaneously in theaters and on Disney+, likely hindering its performance. However, the movie was a hit with critics and even more so with audiences, who rated it an impressive 91% on Rotten Tomatoes. Black Widow is a perfectly bittersweet swan song for Johansson’s character, as the actress gives Natasha new layers the audience knows they’re enjoying for the last time.\n\n​​​​​​​\n\n5 Jojo Rabbit (2019)\n\nRosie\n\nJojo Rabbit was released in 2019, going up against a number of extremely successful films in the same year like Joker, Midsommar, Avengers: Endgame, and more. Even standing against so many other great releases, Jojo Rabbit‘s fierce uniqueness in its concept and story makes it stand out regardless. As the movie’s female lead, Johansson has a massive job, and it’s no wonder she earned a Best Supporting Actress nomination at the 2020 Oscars.\n\n​​​​​​​\n\n4 Avengers: Endgame (2019)\n\nNatasha Romanoff / Black Widow\n\nAvengers: Endgame is arguably the Johansson film audiences are most familiar with. While the actress again works in service of a larger ensemble, she gives one of the movie’s best performances in Black Widow’s death scene. It’s an absolute gut punch to viewers, and Johansson plays it with a gravitas that helps elevate Endgame to an incredible movie, not just an incredible comic book movie. Of course, the film’s record-breaking box office haul is worth mentioning, too – Endgame famously became the highest-grossing film of all time and held the spot for a year and a half.\n\n3 Her (2013)\n\nSamantha\n\nThough Her was released in 2013, it’s now seen as ahead of its time in nearly predicting the role AI would have on our lives in the future. Johansson has a unique and leading part in this film as the voice of the AI. Somehow, her work in the movie is some of the best in her career, with the actress making the voice-only nature of the role an asset to her performance rather than a hindrance. She excels at getting across incredible emotion just through voice and is one of the reasons Her was so well-received.\n\n2 Lost in Translation (2003)\n\nCharlotte\n\nLost in Translation was career-defining for Johansson, serving as a key breakout role. Her stellar performance is even more impressive considering she was paired with Bill Murray, who many would have found intimidating at that point in their career. However, Johansson more than holds her own, turning Lost in Translation into one of the most iconic indie films of all time.\n\n1 Marriage Story (2019)\n\nNicole Barber"
