        "text": "Background\n\nScarlett Johansson was born in New York City, New York, on November 22, 1984, to parents Melanie Sloan and Karsten Johansson. Her mother, who is also her former manager, is from a Jewish family and her father is an architect from Copenhagen. Johansson took her first steps in acting at a very young age after her mother started taking her to auditions. Her first professional acting gig was in the off-Broadway production “Sophistry” at New York’s Playwrights Horizons, at the age of eight. Johansson’s film debut would happen a year later in the fantasy comedy “North,” which would lead her to a couple of other minor roles before scoring her first lead role as Amanda in the film “Manny & Lo.”\n\nJohansson’s performance in “Manny & Lo” garnered several positive reviews, a nomination for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Lead Female, and the attention of the critically-acclaimed director Sofia Coppola, who cast her in the 2003 film “Lost in Translation.” In the same year, Johansson starred as a young 17th-century servant in Peter Webber’s film “Girl with a Pearl Earring,” based on the novel of the same name. For both films, she was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role at the Golden Globe Awards and BAFTA Award, winning the latter for “Lost in Translation.” In the following years, the actress would score two critically-acclaimed psychological thrillers, Christopher Nolan’s “The Prestige” and Woody Allen’s “Match Point,” which earned her a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress — Motion Picture.\n\nIn 2010, Johansson landed the part of the Black Widow in the blockbuster superhero film “Iron Man 2.” She would reprise the role in a series of other Marvel Cinematic Universe (M.C.U.) films for the next few years, including “Captain America: The Winter Soldier” and its sequel, “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” “Avengers: Infinity War,” and “Avengers: Endgame.” After venturing into the M.C.U., Johansson chronicles a woman in the process of getting a divorce in the comedy-drama “Marriage Story” with Adam Driver and portrays a mother in “Jojo Rabbit,” Taika Waititi’s satirical black comedy. Johansson received an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress for the former and Best Supporting Actress for the latter. With almost two decades of work under her belt, Johansson has proven to be one of Hollywood’s most talented actresses of all time.\n\nScarlett Johansson Movies"
