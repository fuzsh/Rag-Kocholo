        "text": "Jeff Goldblum sent Scarlett Johansson a message welcoming her to the 'Jurassic' family.\n\nThe 39-year-old actress is set to take the lead in the upcoming fourth 'Jurassic World' movie, and she received a surprise from the 71-year-old actor, who first played Dr. Ian Malcolm in 1993's original 'Jurassic Park' movie.\n\nIn a video played during her interview on 'Today' this week, he said: \"Dr. Johansson, this is Jeff Goldblum.\"\n\nReferencing the franchise's iconic \"Life will find a way\" quote, he added: \"Here’s what I want to say to you. This I know: Scarlett will find a way.\n\n“Don’t get eaten, unless you want to. I love you.”\n\nGoldblum reprise his role as Dr. Malcolm in three more sequels, including his return in 2022's 'Jurassic World Dominion'.\n\nJohasson - who previously worked with him on 'Asteroid City' - was overjoyed by his kind gesture.\n\nShe said: \"Oh my God, I can't believe Jeff said that to me. I think my life is complete now. I can retire.\"\n\nGoldblum isn't expected to be part of the new 'Jurassic World' film, which is an entirely new story separate from the 'Jurassic World' trilogy starring Chris PRatt and Bryce Dallas Howard.\n\n'Rogue One' and 'Godzilla' director Gareth Edwards will be at the helm, directing from a script written by David Koepp, who penned 'Jurassic Park' in 1993, and its sequel 'The Lost World: Jurassic Park' four years later.\n\nLast month, Johansson hailed the script as \"so incredible\".\n\nShe told ComicBook.com: \"I am an enormous ‘Jurassic Park’ fan. It is one of the first movies I remember seeing in theaters.\n\n\"I remember it so vividly. It was life-changing and mind blowing. I cannot express how excited I am.”\n\nAnd she admitted she has spent more than a decade trying to land a role in the franchise.\n\nShe added: “David Koepp wrote it and returned after 30 years to write it and he’s so passionate about.\n\n“I’ve been trying to get into this franchise in any possible way for over 10 years.\n\n\"I’m like, ‘I’ll die in the first five minutes! I can get eaten by whatever! I’ll do the craft service!’\n\n\"I’ll do anything for it. The fact that it’s happened in this way at this time just is actually unbelievable.”"
