Scarlett Johansson began acting as a child; her first role was in the movie North (1994). She was born November 22, 1984 in New York. With her beauty and penchant for trying to keep her private life out of the public eye, Johansson seems classier than many of her fellow actresses of the same age.

Johansson continued acting and gained recognition for her role in The Horse Whisperer (1998). She really became a household name in 2003, however, after starring in Lost in Translation with Bill Murray, and Girl with a Pearl Earring with Colin Firth. She was nominated for a Golden Globe for both films, in the best actress categories (comedy and drama).

Johansson continued acting in a wide variety of roles, from In Good Company (2004) to a voice role as Mindy the Mermaid in the SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004). Woody Allen cast her in three of his films, Match Point (2005), Scoop (2006), and a yet-unnamed film due out in 2008. Around the time she became Allen’s new muse, she also starred in the Michael Bay bomb, The Island (2005).

A Vanity Fair cover for which she posed nude with Keira Knightly (and with a clothed Tom Ford) garnered a lot of media attention in 2006. She’s been the spokesperson with many brands, including Louis Vuitton and L’Oreal. She continues to add in a variety of projects to her career, starring in a music video for Justin Timberlake, and playing a version of herself in an episode of HBO’s Entourage.
