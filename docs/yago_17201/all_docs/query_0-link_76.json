        "text": "Mexican director Guillermo del Toro's cinematic trajectory has already taken him from his native country in Cronos (1992) to the big budgets of Hollywood in Mimic (1997), Blade II (2002), and Hellboy (2004), and to Spain with his Mexican-Spanish co-productions, El espinazo del diablo and, more recently, El laberinto del fauno (2006). With particular attention to El espinazo del diablo, my interest lies in examining how the transnational status of this film generated a certain set of readings of the text. Three specific contexts of reception (Spain, Mexico and Hollywood) articulate my analysis of film critics' responses to del Toro's first 'Spanish' film. The final section of the essay offers a localized reading by examining del Toro's distinctive articulation of the horror genre in an established tradition of film-making on the subject of the Spanish Civil War and his inscription of the comic book Paracuellos in the filmic text.\n\nThis chapter discusses the evolution of Spanish horror film in the past decades. First, it examines the growth of horror in the context of film co-productions in the 1960s and 1970s. Second, it studies how horror film developed throughout the 1980s in the context of the re-establishment of a democratic regime. Third, it analyses the return of genre in the 1990s through the appearance of a new generation of filmmakers that redefined Spanish film. Fourth, it approaches horror film in the twenty-first century, with an emphasis on the key role of television operators as film production companies. Finally, it examines The Orphanage (J.A. Bayona 2007) as a national and international triumph that paved the way for an understanding of contemporary Spanish film within a series of both national and transnational coordinates."
