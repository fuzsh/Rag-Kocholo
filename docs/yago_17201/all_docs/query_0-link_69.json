        "text": "\"Are you telling me that an ape that lived two million years ago got out of that crate, killed the baggage man and put him in there, then locked everything up neat and tidy, and got away?\" Damn straight! Better bring in Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee to save the planet! Join your faithful Grue Crew - Doc Rotten, Chad Hunt, Bill Mulligan, and Jeff Mohr - as they take a ride on the Trans-Siberian Railroad, better known to those who ride it as the Horror Express.\n\nDecades of Horror 1970s\n\nEpisode 94 – Horror Express (1972)\n\nIn 1906, in China, a British anthropologist discovers a frozen prehistoric creature and must transport it to Europe by train.\n\nIMDb\n\nDirector: Eugenio Martín (as Gene Martin)\n\nWriters: Arnaud d'Usseau, Julian Zimet\n\nProducer: Bernard Gordon\n\nMusic: John Cacavas\n\nFeatured Cast:\n\nChristopher Lee as Professor Sir Alexander Saxton\n\nPeter Cushing as Dr. Wells\n\nSilvia Tortosa as Countess Irina Petrovski (dubbed by Olive Gregg)\n\nTelly Savalas as Captain Kazan\n\nAlberto de Mendoza as Father Pujardov (dubbed by Robert Rietti)\n\nHelga Liné as Natasha (dubbed by Olive Gregg)\n\nAlice Reinheart as Miss Jones (dubbed by Olive Gregg)\n\nJulio Peña as Inspector Mirov (dubbed by Roger Delgado)\n\nÁngel del Pozo as Yevtushenko\n\nJosé Jaspe as Conductor Konev\n\nGeorge Rigaud as Count Marion Petrovski\n\nDoes it need to be said how much Doc loves Horror Express? Peter Cushing! ‘Nuff said? Bill points out this is one of the few films in which Peter Cushing’s and Christopher Lee’s characters are working together and are both card-carrying members of the “good guys club.” The resemblance of Horror Express to John W. Campbell’s “Who Goes There?” was immediately obvious to Chad and made it a film he loves to love. Jeff digs Telly Savalas’ bigger-than-life performance and discusses producer Bernard Gordon’s writing career and time on the blacklist. The Grue Crew unanimously thought the “dinosaur-on-the-inside-back-of-the-eyeball” gimmick was pretty ridiculous but still cool as hell.\n\nBasically, your faithful Grue Crew could not heap enough praise on Horror Express. Doc and Jeff pretty much geeked out on the quality and all the extras on the recent Arrow Blu-ray release and think everyone in the universe should own it!\n\nWe want to hear from you – the coolest, grooviest fans: leave us a message or leave a comment on the site or email the Decades of Horror 1970s podcast hosts at docrotten@decadesofhorror.com.\n\n“Dead people who walk! You still don’t believe in zombies?” Of course we do! Join this episode’s Grue Crew - Whitney Collazo, Joseph Perry, Chad Hunt, and Jeff Mohr - as they take in some Lucha libre featuring the great El Santo in Santo vs. the Zombies (original title: Santo contra los zombies).\n\nDecades of Horror: The Classic Era\n\nEpisode 54 – Santo vs. the Zombies (1962)\n\nWrestling superhero Santo battles an evil scientist who has created a race of zombies.\n\nIMDb\n\nDirector: Benito Alazraki\n\nWriters: Benito Alazraki, Antonio Orellana, Fernando Osés\n\nFeatured Cast:\n\nSanto (Rodolfo Guzmán Huerta) as Santo / the Saint\n\nLorena Velázquez as Gloria Sandoval/Gloria Rutherford (US version)\n\nArmando Silvestre as Lt. Sanmartin / Lt. Savage\n\nJaime Fernández as Det. Rodriguez\n\nDagoberto Rodríguez as Det. Chief Almada\n\nIrma Serrano as Det. Isabel\n\nCarlos Agostí as Genaro / Uncle Herbert\n\nRamón Bugarini as Rogelio / Roger, the male nurse\n\nAlejandro Cruz as Black Shadow, a wrestler (as Black Shadow)\n\nGory Guerrero as Wrestler (as Gori Guerrero)\n\nSugi Sito as Wrestler\n\nEl Gladiador as Wrestler\n\nNeedless to say, your Classic Era Grue Crew loves Santo movies and Santo vs. the Zombies is no exception. Whitney recounts the importance of Santo in Mexico as relayed to her by her father, while Joseph schools everyone on some interesting information about lucha libre and luchadores. It is the classic battle between good and evil that warms Chad’s heart and as usual, he brings in a Batman connection. Jeff finally turns the corner as he too now loves the Santo movies and recommends director Benito Alazraki’s Curse of the Doll People (Muñecos infernales, 1961) as a decidedly creepy Mexican horror film.\n\nTreat yourself to a fun-filled experience and watch Santo vs. the Zombies! While you’re at it, make it a double feature with Santo and Blue Demon Against the Monsters and revisit episode 19 of Decades of Horror: The Classic Era on that film. Better yet, let your Grue Crew know your favorite Santo movie. They expect to be covering more!\n\nThe Decades of Horror: The Classic Era Grue Crew plan to release a new episode every other week. Hey, where else will you hear podcasts on films ranging from The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920) to The Curse of Frankenstein (1957) to Maneater of Hydra (1967)? The next episode in our very flexible schedule will be Carl Th. Dreyer’s Vampyr (1932).\n\nPlease send us feedback on the films we cover, ideas for future films, or the podcast itself. After all, without you, we’re just four unmasked luchadores talking about the films we love. Send us an email at feedback@gruesomemagazine.com or leave us a message, a review, or a comment at GruesomeMagazine.com, iTunes, the Gruesome Magazine Horror News Radio Facebook group or your friendly neighborhood podcast aggregator.\n\nTo each of you from each of us, “Thank you so much for listening!”\n\nJoin Doc Rotten and Vanessa Thompson for a quick review of the super hero sensation SHAZAM! And, by \"quick review\", we mean 45 minutes of joyful discussion all things DC's \"Captain Marvel.\" The film is directed by horror director David F. Sandberg who previously handled directing chores on LIGHTS OUT and ANNABELLE: CREATION. So, how does he handle a superhero film? Let's just say, \"As well as James Wan!\"\n\nThe review is mostly spoiler free until the end where we dive feet first into all the spoilers after a \"spoiler warning.\" Let us know what you think of SHAZAM! in the show note or by reaching out to feedback@gruesomemagazine.com.\n\nSHAZAM!\n\nWe all have a superhero inside us, it just takes a bit of magic to bring it out. In Billy Batson's case, by shouting out one word - SHAZAM! - this streetwise fourteen-year-old foster kid can turn into the adult superhero Shazam.\n\nIMDb\n\nDirector: David F. Sandberg\n\nWriters: Henry Gayden (screenplay by), Henry Gayden (story by)\n\nCast:\n\nZachary Levi ... Shazam\n\nDjimon Hounsou ... The Wizard Shazam\n\nMark Strong ... Dr. Thaddeus Sivana\n\nJack Dylan Grazer ... Freddy Freeman\n\nAsher Angel ... Billy Batson\n\nMarta Milans ... Rosa Vasquez\n\nGrace Fulton ... Mary Bromfield\n\nStephannie Hawkins ... Bus Passenger #6\n\nCooper Andrews ... Victor Vasquez\n\nLovina Yavari ... Store Clerk\n\nNatalia Safran ... Mrs. Sivana\n\nJohn Glover ... Sivana's Father\n\nCaroline Palmer ... Billy's Mom\n\nFaithe Herman ... Darla Dudley\n\nIan Chen ... Eugene Choi\n\n\"I don’t mind making it on the lawn. You wanna make it on the lawn?\" Sure sounds like a line of dialogue from a movie from the 1970s, but a horror movie? Join your faithful Grue Crew - Doc Rotten, Chad Hunt, Bill Mulligan, and Jeff Mohr - as they follow the sound of Donovan’s voice and end up somewhere between night and dawn with George Romero’s Season of the Witch.\n\nDecades of Horror 1970s\n\nEpisode 93 – Season of the Witch (1972)\n\nSynopsis:\n\nA bored, unhappy suburban housewife gets mixed up in witchcraft and murder.\n\n- IMDb\n\nWriter/Director: George A. Romero\n\nFeatured Cast:\n\nJan White as Joan Mitchell\n\nRaymond Laine as Gregg Williamson\n\nAnn Muffly as Shirley Randolph\n\nJoedda McClain as Nikki Mitchell\n\nBill Thunhurst as Jack Mitchell\n\nEsther Lapidus as Sylvia\n\nNeil Fisher as Doctor Miller\n\nVirginia Greenwald as Marion Hamilton\n\nBill Hinzman as The Intruder\n\nSeason of the Witch, aka Jack’s Wife, aka Hungry Wives, is one of Romero’s lesser known works but it still packs enough content to make it worth the watch. This one was Chad’s pick and he managed to find a film by the legendary director that none of the Grue Crew had seen! Bill discusses how the story’s premise is grounded in the women’s liberation movement of the ‘70s and makes sure to point out that Bill Hinzman, who plays The Intruder in this film, also played the ghoul that killed Barbara’s brother in Night of the Living Dead. The more Doc talks about the film, the more he finds to like, especially Raymond Laine’s performance as Gregg, the hip, philandering college professor. Jeff, on the other hand, takes a liking to Ann Muffly’s portrayal of Joan’s friend Shirley and doesn’t take kindly to the fake-pot-prank Gregg plays on her at a party. The entire Grue Crew commended Jan White for her lead performance and agree that true horror fans, especially Romero completists, should see Season of the Witch.\n\nWe want to hear from you – the coolest, grooviest fans: leave us a message or leave a comment on the site or email the Decades of Horror 1970s podcast hosts at docrotten@decadesofhorror.com."
