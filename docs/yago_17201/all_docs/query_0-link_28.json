        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\n229 9 Rags and Revolution Visions of the Lumpenproletariat in Latin American Zombie Films Mariano Paz The zombie has become so pervasive in American popular culture, particularly during the last few decades, that it is easy to forget that zombies originated in Latin American folklore and myth. Although the religious and cultural foundations of zombies can be traced to African culture, it is in Haiti where modern accounts of these figures were first recorded in literary and journalistic sources. It did not lake long before the zombie was taken up by Hollywood in early films such as White Zombie (Victor Halperin, 1932) and I Walked with a Zombie (Jacques Tourneur, 1943), although its cult status was not probably achieved until 1968, with the release of George Romero’s classic Night of the Living Dead. However, zombies have experienced unprecedented success in the twenty-first century, with the final two films in Romero’s saga (Land of the Dead [2005] and Diary of the Dead [2008]), the remake of Dawn of the Dead (Zack Snyder, 2004), the new zombie series Resident Evil, blockbusters such as I Am Legend (Francis Lawrence, 2007), and even the TV series The Walking Dead (AMC, 2010–). However, and despite its cultural origins, this particular subgenre has been almost completely absent from Latin American cinema. In 1961, Santo contra los Zombies (Santo vs. the Zombies, Benito Alazraki) featured 230 | Mariano Paz the famous Mexican wrestler Santo fighting against these creatures. This film was inscribed in a series of works in which Santo faced multiple monsters , including vampires, witches, Martians, and the Mummy, among many others—all of them an excuse for Santo to display his wrestling abilities. However, only recently were additional zombie films produced. In what is perhaps the only article on the topic of the Latin American zombie, Alfredo Suppia and Lucio Reis Filho (2010) have identified a select number of Latin American films that draw on the iconography of the zombie, although in many of these cases the zombies are nothing but a marginal presence, and these films would probably fall outside the conventional classification of the subgenre. Suppia and Reis Filho also identify a number of interesting examples of animation and independent short films. However, arguably the most relevant feature-length SF zombie films in the Latin American corpus are to be found in Plaga Zombie (Zombie Plague, dir. Pablo Parés and Hernán Sáez), a series of three films made in Argentina, and in Juan de los Muertos (Juan of the Dead, dir. Alejandro Brugués, 2012), the first zombie film made in Cuba. The Plaga Zombie trilogy comprises Plaga Zombie (1997), Plaga Zombie: Zona Mutante (Zombie Plague: Mutant Zone [2007]), and Plaga Zombie Zona Mutante: Revolución Tóxica (Zombie Plague Mutant Zone: Toxic Revolution [2012]).1 This chapter proposes a sociopolitical reading of the representation of the zombie in this group of films. I claim that zombies in this case can be read as an allusion to the lumpenproletariat—the social class that Marx (1995) described as the “refuse of society” and which includes the urban masses of vagabonds, criminals, outcasts, and the unemployed. These masses are located outside capitalist relations and are, in ideological and political terms, the opposite of the proletariat. From this starting point, I argue that, given the crucial differences in the economic and sociopolitical organization of Argentina and Cuba, the visions of the lumpenproletariat that the films offer inevitably respond to diverse understandings of class and social stratification. Drawing on contemporary social theorists who have revised the idea of the lumpenproletariat as described by Marx and Engels, I propose that zombies in the Argentinean films can be interpreted [167.71.63.233] Project MUSE (2024-08-21 03:16 GMT) Rags and Revolution | 231 according to what Zygmunt Bauman describes as “human waste”—the outcasts produced by post-industrial, globalized capital. In the Cuban film, the scenario presented is more ambiguous and might be better read through Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri’s concept of the multitude. In either of these approaches, Latin American zombie films hint at the possibility of an emancipatory potential that could be conveyed through the portrayal of these monsters. Latin American Zombies and the Lumpenproletariat Juan de los Muertos and the Plaga Zombie trilogy stand out not only in terms of nationality, but because they are small-scale, low-budget productions— even compared with less expensive European or American independent films. The Plaga trilogy has been entirely financed..."
