        "text": "The Velvet Santo.\n\nThis week is a change of pace, as we're treated to Santo in a Western. This time, Santo is called in to help mediate a situation in a remote Mexican village, which is located near a leprosarium. Six Lepers have escaped, and are stealing things along the outskirts of the village. It's up to Santo to capture the Lepers and keep the townspeople from burning down the leprosarium in a fiery act of mob violence.\n\nA Leper trying on some jewelry.\n\nI guess its suppose to be understood that this is one of Santo's Ancestors in the old west, dealing with this conflict. One might assume its just a very remote part of Mexico in the 1970s, and it easily could be, but Santo seems to be the only one enlightened enough to know there is a \"new\" cure for Leprosy known as dapsone. Since dapsone was introduced in the early 20th century, I think its safe to assume that the story takes place at least around the time that The Wild Bunch did. There's also no signs of electricity or cars.\n\nSanto beating another hapless badguy senseless.\n\nThere's some interesting moral quandaries thrown at Santo and the Sheriff, Dario, that he is assisting in this movie. The escaped Lepers aren't dastardly, mustache twirling bad guys, but only sick people who don't want to die fenced off from the rest of the world. They're not out to make anyone sick, and only steal what necessities they need. The real villain of the piece is Camerino, the local alarmist, who turns out to be the secret gang leader for a group of Bandidos. He convinces the Lepers to be a diversion to the townsfolk, while he goes about his criminal activities, planning to double cross them the entire time.\n\nA leper\n\nOne thing that has become obvious with these later movies, is Santo's age. At this point, in 1970, he had to be in his early 50s, and it shows. In the movie's sole wrestling match, (more a bare knuckle brawl, considering the time period) Santo goes shirtless for the first time in two or three movies, and you can see the beginnings of a Ric Flair sloppy tittied chest. It's no wonder they've had him sporting turtlenecks and jumpers lately. This time out, he wears a fancy purple jacket/shirt thing.\n\nSanto in action!\n\nThe plot, or what I gleaned from it when I actually bothered to pay attention, is that some rare jewel thief who calls himself the Stranger, is blackmailing female pro wrestlers into doing his dirty work for him. One in particular is being forced to be his apex henchman under threat of her captive father being murdered. Santo is brought in by Interpol to deal with the situation.\n\nLADY WRESTLER FIGHT!\n\nA tedious foot race ensues between Santo, the Police, and the Stranger with his lady wrestler henchwomen. Most of it is plodding and inane. The only amusing part, and its amusing because it doesn't intend to be, is when Santo and a Cop try to surveil their quarry on foot through city streets, ala The French Connection, only its painfully obvious to the crooks they're being followed, because one of the guys following them is in a SILVER SPARKLING LUCHADOR MASK! There's also some meant-to-be tantalizing stuff with a sexy belly dancer, and the return of That Guy who appeared in so many of these earlier movies as a villain. You know the one, I've mentioned him plenty of times. I'm not showing you a picture of him again, so go back through the previous reviews yourself. None of it really makes for anything exciting.\n\nYeah yeah...belly dancers, big F'ing deal...\n\nWith a title as dramatic as Santo Faces Death, you'd think something really dramatic and shocking would happen. You know Santo's not actually going to die, but maybe he'd have to best the grim reaper in chess or a best out of three pins wrestling match. Alas, this entry is the most mundane and tedious yet. Fuck this movie.\n\nSanto wrasslin' a croc.\n\nSanto then leads her father, godfather, boyfriend, some red shirts, and some secret bad guys on a quest through...I guess the Amazon? It's never mad clear, to retrieve her before she can be sacrificed. What follows is a tedious march through the jungle that lasts for days, which is great because it actually feels like days to watch it...\n\nMariana must be sacrificed at some moldy Incan ruin at the next full moon, so they slowly march through the jungle, then Santo's posse slowly marches through the same patch of jungle.\n\nSanto can't even be bothered brushing away poison ivy...\n\nIt's a shame that this is where the movie decides to go with its storyline, as it starts off strongly, even if it does seem a bit racist. Action pieces are set up, only for Santo to blandly foil them, almost with the wave of a hand. This happens repeatedly. His team encounters a massive Cayman, which Santo wrestles to submission. His team encounters a ferocious Leopard, which Santo wrestles into submission. There's unseen piranha, and electric eels, but Santo finds a reasonable work around. The electric eel scene is especially entertaining as Santo uses them to dispose of a traitor, hurling the man into the river, which instantly blazes intensely, and we're told the river is full of electric eels.\n\n\"We're Indians...get it?\"\n\nThere's also a reference by the villains to some obscure Incan god who is part man, part jaguar, who watches over them. This \"god\" reference pays off at the climax when some clown in a half assed jaguar costume attacks Santo. I bring this scene up because I laughed out loud at the beating Santo doles out to this poor bastard. This guy is seriously just in the movie to get his ass utterly stomped to pulp by Santo, and even then Santo just right hooks him, picks him up, and right hooks him again. I'm pretty certain this clown never lays a hit on Santo throughout their brief fight scene. I haven't seen Santo beat an opponent so utterly senseless since some of the early movies.\n\nSanto beating the Jaguar God senseless.\n\nThe 25th El Santo movie is sadly a lackluster one, especially considering how strong the past few movies have been. What could've been an interesting jungle survival story to drop Santo in turns into an exercise in tedium as Santo and friends spend most of the movie walking. The villains could've been interesting antagonists, but end up coming off as witless savages with unrealistic life goals.\n\n17th Century Man!\n\nIt's billed as a Santo/Blue Demon team up, but its mostly a Santo vehicle with Blue Demon getting an extended cameo. After the Extended flashback ends, and we jump forward to present day Mexico, Blue Demon's role in the story is mostly forgotten until the climax. Its technically not even \"our\" Blue Demon, as it is a past Blue Demon who is cursed. The plus side to this is that there is a vague sort of explanation as to Blue Demon's moniker. Once known as the Blue Knight in the 1600s, people started referring to him as a demon after he was cursed to walk the nether realms and serve the forces of evil, hence the name \"Blue Demon\".\n\nThe Worst Satanic ritual orgry....ever!\n\nOnce we're in the modern day, that is 1960s Mexico, we learn that the female descendent of the lead Witch Santo's ancestor sent to the stake to burn, is going to be possessed by her vengeful ancestor. This poses a problem for Santo, as this is his newest squeeze. I swear, for a dork in a silver wrestling mask, this guy sees more trim than a toilet seat. He definitely gives James Bond a run for his money, and likely changes his women out faster than he does his wrestling tights.\n\nDid you know they had mock turtlenecks in the 17th century?\n\nI have to admit to getting a strange enjoyment out of this return to Santo's lineage. It adds a greater weight and sense of a larger universe to these movies, knowing that there have been all these Champions of justice known as Santo through the ages. It's not the most terribly original idea for a superhero, as its been done with characters like The Phantom and even Batman, both of whom Santo is obviously modeled after, but still, its an effort to add a more complex storyline to these films and its welcome.\n\nOne of their few on-screen moments together, in Hell...\n\nWhat's not welcome is the continued practice of stealing footage from other movies. This time out its Mario Bava's Hercules In The Haunted World. Footage of the dead rising from graves is used repeatedly from this movie. Aside from it being obviously stolen, due to its overly grainy appearance, there's no effort to match it up to the rest of the movie! Shots of zombies rising from their tombs cut to scenes of Santo supposedly fighting these same zombies, only now they're wrestlers in white fright wigs instead of rotting corpses.\n\nA fine family film!\n\n24 films out, Santo and his filmmaking friends have decided to hue close to a tried and true formula, making this entry one of the more durable ones. It doesn't always fire on all cylinders and isn't nearly as strong as the previous film in this series, but its still one of the better entries. The effort to get the period stuff as right as possible on a Mexican film budget alone makes this a strong entry. There's some awkward stuff with Santo having a fencing match with two undead goons, but its more laugh inducing than groan inducing, as Santo's slow reaction time helps add to the film's offbeat charm.\n\nSanto in a 007 pose.\n\nThe gist of the film, what gist they bothered to give us as an excuse for so much monster fighting, is that a mad scientist named Dr. Bruno Halder has not only found a means to reanimate himself from the dead, but also had managed to exert mind control over numerous forms of supernatural life. Halder intends to use his discoveries to murder his brother, niece and Blue Demon, who all contributed to his death somehow. I guess that was explained in a Blue Demon movie I didn't see? It's uncertain. Santo becomes involved, since Halder's niece Gloria, is his new squeeze. Also at Halder's disposal is a duplication machine, similar in function to the one used by Hugh Jackman in The Prestige. Of course, Halder being a bad guy, he uses the machine for his own shallow selfish ends, managing to capture and duplicate Blue Demon, he sends out this evil clone to wreak havoc while the real Blue Demon is imprisoned in his lair.\n\nA group shot of the Antagonists.\n\nThe only thing that really matters with this movie is the monster fights, and they give it to you in spades. Santo fights as many as five monsters at once in any given fight sequence, and while the monster suits are amazingly shoddy (especially the Cyclops, whom you can see tears in the suit of by the climax), its part of the film's charm.\n\nFun with Frankenstien!\n\nMy only real complaint, aside from making Blue Demon a bad guy AGAIN for most of the run time, is the use of footage stolen from other movies. Santo, Gloria and her father try to hide out at a night club during one scene, taking in a show. Footage is then inserted from an obviously much older mexican musical. If you can't tell by the change in color and film stock that its not something they shot, you can tell by the fact that its a massive studio set, and when they cut back to santo, he's inside a small restaurant. No way in hell does that even flirt with the illusion of matching up."
