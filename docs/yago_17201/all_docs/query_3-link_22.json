It guides viewers through an uplifting musical journey, made real by the touching performances of stars Jennifer Lopez (in her breakout role) and legendary Mexican American thespian, Edward James Olmos.

Top of the World!”\n\nWith these iconic lines James Cagney—his voice aching with crazed intensity—cemented his comeback as Hollywood’s most explosive movie star. In 1949, as moviegoers sat transfixed by the screen, the movie stars’ manic desperation left little doubt: Cagney and White Heat had reached the peak of the gangster film. And today, 75 years later, few, if any, have come close to attaining such heights.\n\nUsing real-life gangsters like Ma Barker and her four criminal sons as a jumping off point, this firecracker of a story travels across the beauty of the High Sierra mountains, deep into the horrors of the penitentiary, and into the mind of a man suffering from “homicidal psychosis.”\n\nOn the edge of the gangster and film noir genres, it features a bold heist, a femme fatale, and moody black and white photography, all directed by gangster flick veteran Raoul Walsh (The Roaring Twenties, High Sierra).\n\nBut what really sets it apart is Cagney. Bursting with vulnerability and rage, he embodies Arthur “Cody” Jarrett, a violently volatile, (and highly quotable) criminal madman beset with mommy issues, a debilitating psychosomatic ailment, and a beautiful woman he can’t help but trust.\n\nCome see why White Heat, decades later, is still on top of the gangster heap, WITH THE REAL FLICKER OF 16MM FILM ON SCREEN!\n\nThe Senate Theater and The Detroit Theater Organ Society is supported by The Michigan Arts and Culture Council and The National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nParking is available in our gated lot, on Gilbert, and Michigan Avenue\n\nView Event →\n\nMosaic Youth Theater – Mosaic Actors Performance: Debating Destiny\n\nEmbark on a riveting journey of self-discovery with “Debating Destiny,” a captivating new play by James Anthony Tyler (“The Drop Off,” “hop the A,” “Some Old Black Man”).\n\nJoin Udonis Sparks as he confronts loss, discovers hidden talents, and faces life-altering choices.

Through their bond with each other they find joy, love, hope and kinship—with a little help from some vehicular arson.\n\nBased on the bestselling novel of the same name by Terry McMillan (How Stella Got Her Groove Back) this trailblazing hit film spurred the production of similar films for at least a decade and has had a long-lasting cultural impact. Though it focuses on middle class Black women and their particular problems it remains a touchstone of representation for any woman. Meanwhile, it dared to buck the trend of popular Black films that focused on the poverty stricken and violent lives of young Black men, proving once again the viability of films made for and about women—their desires, their issues, and their triumphs.\n\nOf course, with a cast like this how could you miss?\n\nSuperstar singer/actress Whitney Houston and critically acclaimed actress Angela Bassett lead the stacked ensemble,\n\na who’s who of Black actors from the mid-1990s featuring Loretta Devine, Gregory Hines, Giancarlo Esposito, Wesley Snipes and more.

Feb. 17\n\nDoors – 7:00 PM\n\nFilm – 8:00 PM\n\nTickets - $12\n\n1hr 11min | NR | Drama/Romance | United States\n\nLive Organ Accompaniment by Lance Luce\n\nDepravity seizes upon poverty as extravagance collides with innocence in Queen Kelly,\n\na silent drama of doomed romance, presented with live musical accompaniment by Lance Luce on the Senate’s Mighty Wurlitzer theater organ! This incomplete but still captivating exercise in cinematic excess from director/screenwriter Erich von Stroheim proves that even an unfinished work from a master is still a masterwork.\n\nCo-produced by and starring Gloria Swanson, one of the silent era's biggest stars, what survives of the film tells the story of a playboy aristocrat who balks at his betrothal to his mad queen. On the eve of the marriage, he falls for an enchanting and fiery convent girl (Swanson) and then schemes to possess her, no matter the cost.\n\nIn its existing form, the film presents a meticulously realized world in beautiful detail, a simple but sumptuous tale of worlds colliding—an ill-fated meeting that ends, (spoiler) in tragedy.\n\nBut the epic and transgressive melodrama that could have been was never completed, itself a victim of incompatibility. But rather than a clash of class and circumstance, what doomed Queen Kelly from reaching its potential was the battle between art and business, the vision of an auteur versus censorship.\n\nSilents at the Senate is proud to present the 1932 release of this almost lost piece of silent film history!\n\nReleased only in Europe well into the “talkie” period, this is the most concise and cinematically pure version of the film. It features the so-called “Swanson” ending, filmed after the dismissal of Stroheim and shot two years after the abrupt end to the production due to massive cost overruns and the directors’ efforts to skirt the demands of censors.\n\nThe Senate Theater and The Detroit Theater Organ Society is supported by The Michigan Arts and Culture Council and The National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nView Event →\n\nLove & Basketball (2000)\n\nDoors – 7:00 PM\n\nOrgan Overture – 7:30 PM\n\nFilm – 8:00 PM\n\nTickets - $6\n\n2hr 4min | PG-13 | Romance/Sports Drama | USA\n\nPassion and courage. Desire and determination. A deep connection built on shared dreams.\n\nIn Love & Basketball, romance got game.\n\nIn this new classic of American cinema, the lives of two young athletes and childhood friends (Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps) are intertwined as they attempt to navigate the world of competitive basketball. Meanwhile, a powerful attraction keeps them drawn to each other again and again through injury, struggle, and distance.\n\nGina Prince-Bythewood's semi-autobiographical debut feature is equal parts coming-of-age love story and nuanced sports drama, originally intended as a Black When Harry Met Sally. Upon its release this soon-to-be cult favorite garnered plenty of critical praise but was only a minor success at the box office. In the twenty plus years since, however, its reputation has only grown, turning it into a perennial favorite for Valentine’s Day viewing and earning it a rightful place in the National Film Registry.\n\nCome see this Spike Lee produced gem at the Senate, with all its action—on the court and off—splashed across our big screen!\n\nThe Senate Theater and The Detroit Theater Organ Society is supported by The Michigan Arts and Culture Council and The National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nParking is available in our gated lot, on Gilbert, and Michigan Avenue\n\nView Event →\n\nNuestra Cultura's Chicano History Week Film Screening, Director Q&A, and Art Show\n\nNuestra Cultura's Chicano History Week 2024 (Detroit, MI)\n\nJoin us for an exciting event celebrating Chicano History at the Senate Theater in Detroit, MI!

From engaging live art and thought-provoking panel discussions to Chicano art exhibitions, this event promises to be an unforgettable celebration of Chicano history and culture.\n\nAmerican Homeboy is a documentary film that explores the complex origins of pachuco and cholo culture which sprouted from American soil in response to wartime sentiment, social alienation, and government discrimination only to become a pop culture phenomenon. The film draws from rare interviews shot on 5k with leading Mexican American historians, academics, artists, activists, cholos, and former law enforcement officers against a backdrop of 50 hours of restored archival footage.\n\nView Event →\n\nFive Deadly Venoms (1978)\n\nDoors – 7:00 PM\n\nOrgan Overture – 7:30 PM\n\nFilm – 8:00 PM\n\nTickets - $6\n\n1hr 38min | R | Kung-fu/Mystery | Hong Kong\n\nCentipede!

Five Deadly Venoms.\n\nIn a feudal world of violence, corruption and intrigue, a young novice of the Poison Clan must seek out and discover the identities of the five former pupils of his kung-fu master so that he might reclaim the good reputation of their clan. But will he be able to tell which of them can be trusted and which of them must be defeated?\n\nThe Senate is excited to present this kaleidoscopic blend of kung-fu action, superhuman exploits, and intricate mystery from Hong Kong’s storied Shaw Brothers Studio. This is the film, perhaps more than any other martial arts picture in the post-Bruce Lee era, that kept kung-fu in the cultural consciousness within the United States. Through screenings at urban “grindhouse” theaters and steady rotation on television throughout the 1980s a cult following developed.\n\nAnd with its dazzling, fantasy world this low-budget adventure provided an escape to countless youth on Saturday afternoons while it inspired filmmakers like Quentin Tarantino and hip-hop luminaries like the Wu-Tang Clan.\n\nDon’t miss your chance to see this classic of Hong Kong cinema, presented just like Americans first saw it in 1978—dubbed in English with all the acrobatic action and bright colors splashed across a big screen.\n\nWe're being joined at Five Deadly Venoms by our friends at the Detroit Kung Fu Academy for a special guest introduction and a 5-10 minute kung fu demonstration during intermission.\n\nThe Senate Theater and The Detroit Theater Organ Society is supported by The Michigan Arts and Culture Council and The National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nParking is available in our gated lot, on Gilbert, and Michigan Avenue\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Night of the Hunter (1955)\n\nSat.

A terrifying evil that only righteousness can overcome.\n\nThe stuff of fables, of scripture, of the deep and eternal struggle in our souls. An old story, but rarely has this tale been told with such indelible and nightmarish beauty as in the noir/thriller classic, The Night of the Hunter!\n\nRobert Mitchum stars as Robert Powell, a murderous “preacher” in Great Depression era West Virginia. After being released from the state penitentiary he quickly closes in on the stash of stolen money he knows to be hidden somewhere in the home of his now executed cellmate. With charisma and sex appeal he insinuates himself into the life of the widow Willa Harper, (Shelley Winters) presenting himself as a man of God as he preys upon her unfulfilled desire and the innocence of her children.\n\nThe first and last film directed by acclaimed British actor Charles Laughton, The Night of the Hunter was initially ignored by audiences and harshly reviewed by critics. This, despite its daring visual style, a screenplay by Pulitzer Prize winner James Agee, and a movie star lead. Over the decades, however, the film developed a cult following thanks to television and revival art house theaters. Audiences were drawn to its strange synthesis of film noir mood, horror aesthetics, elemental themes, and abstract set design. As a result, its cult burgeoned while simultaneously undergoing a critical reassessment that now places it among the best of all time.\n\nDon’t miss this masterpiece on our big screen!\n\nThe Senate Theater and The Detroit Theater Organ Society is supported by The Michigan Arts and Culture Council and The National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nParking is available in our gated lot, on Gilbert, and Michigan Avenue\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Matrix (1999)\n\nSat.

(Okay, we're biased, but we think you'll agree!) That's right, we're carrying on tradition by closing out the 2023 Organ Pops Concert series at the Senate with a Christmas concert! This year we are featuring the supremely talented, Stephen Warner, an indefatigable champion of the art of the pipe organ!\n\nBut you won't simply be able to listen to unique theater organ arrangements of seasonal tunes on one of the largest theater organs ever built. Those timeless melodies will also be accompanied by the vocal stylings of Rose Warner, who will be adding to that yuletide cheer with the incomparable beauty of the human voice.\n\nAbout the Artist:\n\nStephen Warner is the organist at Jefferson Avenue Presbyterian Church in Detroit and a staff organist at the Michigan Theater in Ann Arbor. He grew up in Traverse City, Michigan, where he studied piano from age seven and participated in almost every facet of the Traverse City Public Schools music program.\n\nIn 2003, Mr. Warner completed dual bachelor’s degree in organ performance and in mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan. There, he had the opportunity to play the organ with many of the bands, orchestras and choirs, including the U of M Men’s Glee Club, which he was a member for 6 years. He studied organ primarily with Dr. James Kibbie and piano with Dr. Louis Nagel.\n\nMr. Warner studied engineering primarily due to his interest in organ building. He has had the privilege of working as an intern for John Brombaugh and Associates in Eugene, Oregon and now is an assistant for the Holden Pipe Organ Company in Ferndale, Michigan. Recently, Mr. Warner was awarded the David L. Junchen Technical Scholarship from the American Theater Organ Society. The summer of 2001 provided him with a unique study of the organ through a program called “Summer In French Organ Studies,” sponsored by the University of North Texas and the Bedient Pipe Organ Company. This program provided opportunities to perform on and learn the technical details of historic French instruments. This program has inspired Mr. Warner to consider a similar dual approach to studying the history of American instruments, particularly those of the 1920’s. The current application of this interest is in the creation of a fully illustrated book descibing the function and design of Jefferson Avenue Presbyterian's Skinner Organ. For this project, Mr. Warner has recieved the support of the Organ Historical Society through the awarding of the Mader Memorial Research Scholarship.\n\nMr. Warner has enjoyed a fruitful collaboration with his wife, Rose, singing with him in performances on both the classical and theater organ. He has also collaborated with long-time friend and saxophonist, Adam Olson, in recording and performing the works of vaudeville virtuoso, Rudy Wiedoeft. Lately, his performance focus has also turned to accompanying silent films, performing often at both the Senate and Redford theaters. Additionally, he has recently collaborated with banjo player Aaron Jonah Lewis on an upcoming album of traditional ragtime music entitled Ragtime Banjo Revival.\n\nThe Senate Theater and The Detroit Theater Organ Society, a non-profit and all-volunteer organization, is supported in part by The Michigan Arts and Culture Council and The National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nParking is available in our gated lot, on Gilbert, and Michigan Avenue\n\nView Event →\n\nIt's a Wonderful Life (1946)\n\nSat.

Merry Christmas you wonderful old Senate Theater!\n\nWe’re kicking off the season of giving this year by bringing you It’s a Wonderful Life. More than seventy-five years on, this enduring holiday classic remains just as romantic, funny, and heart wrenching as ever.\n\nYou’ve seen it again and again, but now you can see it on the big screen in a theater that was playing movies back in 1946 when this classic was released.\n\nGeorge Bailey (James Stewart) is an idealist, dedicated to his family and neighbors. Almost universally beloved, he is known as a man of integrity and generosity, living his entire life within the quaint confines of his hometown. But will a stifled ambition, the cruelty of fate, and the darkness lurking beneath his picturesque surroundings lead him over the edge of despair into ultimate destruction?\n\nYou probably know the answer. But the strength of this film, where integrity, generosity and the power of community defeats deceit, greed and a lust for power, is that knowing the end doesn’t matter. It never gets old, watching the life story of our flawed but thoroughly decent hero. We laugh and cheer at his triumphs. We ache and cry with him in his moments of darkness. We long to descend into the picture as Clarence, his guardian angel, descends from heaven to save his soul.\n\nCome experience this beautiful picture once again at the Senate. We’ll see you there!\n\nThe Senate Theater and The Detroit Theater Organ Society, a non-profit and all-volunteer organization, is supported in part by The Michigan Arts and Culture Council and The National Endowment for the Arts.\n\nParking is available in our gated lot, on Gilbert, and Michigan Avenue\n\nView Event →\n\nThe Fifth Element (1997)\n\nSat.

It is a garish vision of a wasteful and corrupt future as goofy, unhinged and colorful as it is dystopian. But beneath all the camp and color lies the belief that the “divine light” of love can conquer all — even an “ultimate evil” from the deepest, darkest depths of outer space.\n\nHollywood writer Robert Mark Kamen (The Karate Kid, Taken) and French writer/director Luc Besson (La Femme Nikita, Léon: The Professional) worked together to blend their American and European sensibilities, giving birth to this\n\nperhaps the oddest sci-fi extravaganza to ever make a killing at the international box office.\n\nAnd though it divided critics at the time, The Fifth Element has only grown in popularity and esteem since its release. Not only a lavish visual spectacle of practical and computer effects with exciting action sequences, it also boasts iconic turns from the likes of Bruce Willis, Gary Oldman and Milla Jovovich.\n\nWe’ll see you at the theater!
