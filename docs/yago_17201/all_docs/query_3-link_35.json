        "text": "Horror Hunt #34 (April 2021)\n\n10. Starring a pro-wrestler\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEl Santo was not only a legendary luchador and Mexican folk hero but also a busy actor, starring in 52 films between 1959 and 1982. Santo vs. the Evil Brain was the first of these films and I'm sad to say that it is a dud.\n\nThis film tells the tale of some kind of a crazed doctor engaging in some absurd brainwashing scheme that is hard to understand and even harder to care about. El Santo is little more than a glorified henchman that is tricked into helping the scheming doctor with his plans. Luckily another luchador is there to slap some sense into him and eventually they best…\n\nSanto's very first outing is fittingly where I decided to begin my introduction to the world of the character. And I thought it was pretty great all-around. What I love the most is that even in this pulpy, sci-fi kind of story, the Silver-Masked Man and Incognito, his compatriot, are not superpowered, despite their appearance. And when they fight, they're sloppy as fuck, taking tumbles over tabletops and rolling on the ground just as often as they are landing punches or lunging, wrestling-style, at their opponents. It makes for some particularly intense fight scenes, and super-entertaining, sometimes even comical. And the story, and the way the movie is filmed, reminded me for all the world of a comic book from…\n\nSanto vs. the Evil Brain (Santo Contra Cerebro del Mal) is a bit of an odd film, because, apparently, it's the first Santo film, but he's more of a bit player than the starring attraction. In fact, he's not even called Santo in the movie! (He's referred to as \"The Masked Man.\")\n\nThe film starts with some street thugs chasing down Santo and beating him into unconsciousness. (He puts up a good fight, but one guy chokes him with a chain.) He's taken back to the hideout of the mad scientist Dr. Campos (Joaquín Cordero). He's injected with a drug and given a dose of radiation; now his mind is under Dr. Campos's control! (Thus the \"evil brain\" of the…\n\nSanto vs. the Evil Brain is like Batman 1966, but Batman is played by Greg the Hammer Valentine.\n\nOne of the greatest things I have ever seen was Wrestlemania 3 and the match between Ricky the Dragon Steamboat and Macho Man Randy Savage. The athleticism, the storytelling, the emotion. Wrestling at its finest. I had it on VHS and watched it all the time when I was a kid in the late 80s.\n\nOn the same bill Greg Valentine was in a terrible tag team match with The Dream Team against the Rougeau Brothers. Slow, ponderous, tedious.\n\nIf I loved Santo vs. the Evil Brain, I would have said it was like Batman 1966 with Ricky Steamboat as Batman.\n\nSo…"
