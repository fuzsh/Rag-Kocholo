        "text": "“ \"Remember, they're vampire women, so get ready with the Cher jokes.\" ” - Crow\n\nThe Movie[]\n\nMain article: Samson vs. the Vampire Women (film)\n\nSynopsis[]\n\nThe heroic masked wrestler El Santo (aka \"Samson\") battles a coven of vampire women who are seeking to corrupt a virtuous young woman in order to preserve their lives and beauty.\n\nThe Episode[]\n\nHost Segments[]\n\nPrologue: The Satellite of Love has a moment of silence. Tom enjoys his by talking incessantly.\n\nSegment One: Deep 13 receives some Chinese food from an ethereal white deliveryman. Frank accounts for the great majority of the order and kindly sends some up to the SOL. Frank's fortune cookie specifically hints at his imminent death. Crow enjoys his lo mein, Mike has difficulty with his hot and sour clam soup, and Tom's hot dog gives him kisses.\n\nSegment Two: While the crew plays Stratego in their own way, Crow spies a mysterious figure outside the ship and receives an ethereal message.\n\nSegment Three: Torgo the White, complete with reconstructed knees, arrives in Deep 13 and takes Frank to Second Banana Heaven.\n\nSegment Four: Dr. Forrester receives the news from the SOL crew and realizes Frank is gone for good. Distraught, he sings the touching tribute \"Who Will I Kill?\"\n\nSegment Five: The Bots read their letters to Frank; however, only Gypsy's and Servo's (kind of) are actually appropriate for the occasion. Frank visits a mourning Dr. F from the ethereal outer world and pushes the button one last time for old time's sake.\n\nStinger: \"Chief, I saw two corpses in the garden.\"\n\nMST3K cast[]\n\nRegular cast\n\nMichael J.

Nelson - Torgo the White\n\nTrivia[]\n\nFrank Conniff's final regular appearance as TV's Frank. The Brains chose Samson and the Vampire Women for Frank Conniff's final episode due to Conniff's fondness for Mexican wrestling movies, though the original plan was supposed to feature episodes 5 & 6 of the 13-episode miniseries The Master instead. Frank would later come back for a cameo in Episode #1001 - Soultaker.\n\nThis was also Torgo's final appearance in an MST3K episode.\n\nThis episode was ranked #92 among backers of the Bring Back MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000 campaign in the Top 100 Poll.\n\nThe back of the box of the Mystery Science Theater 3000: Volume XXIV DVD set incorrectly refers to this episode as featuring an Italian film.\n\nThis episode aired fourth during Turkey Day '18.\n\nCallbacks[]\n\nOld props featured in Deep 13 during Dr. Forrester's song include the giant syringe, vice grips, the electric high-chair, the Chocolate Bunny Guillotine, Frank's hat from his schoolboy outfit, and boxing gloves. The lock of Frank’s hair that Dr. Forrester catches once Frank is killed by the Lawn Baby also makes an appearance at the end of the song.\n\n\"And a good friend\" (Rocketship X-M)\n\nTorgo returns (\"Manos\" The Hands of Fate) for the last time. Future episodes use Ortega in a similar role.\n\nIn the final Host Segment, Dr. Forrester sings a bit of \"The Greatest Frank of All\" from Episode #523.\n\nObscure References[]\n\n\"Oh, it's Ginger Rogers.\"\n\nGinger Rogers was an American actress, dancer and singer during the Golden Age of Hollywood in the 1930s and '40s.
