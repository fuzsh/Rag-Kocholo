        "text": "Within seconds of talking to 16-year-old Angela Aguilar, a few things become evident.\n\nShe is poised, proud of her Mexican heritage and excited to be able to continue the legacy of her family's dynasty — her grandparents, Antonio Aguilar and Flor Silvestre, and her beloved father, Pepe Aguilar.\n\nShe has scant memories of her grandparents. Antonio Aguilar was a popular film star and ranchera singer who recorded more than 150 albums and created the equestrian and music spectacle his son is continuing. Silvestre also had a career as a singer, actress and equestrienne.\n\nAntonio Aguilar's granddaughter remembers famous Aguilar dynasty\n\n\"I was very little when my grandparents passed away. But I remember standing on a sofa next to my grandmother on one of their farewell tours,\" she said. \"And as far as my dad, he really taught me everything I know.\"\n\nShe said, \"Singing is easy; it's the technical part that is challenging — to know how to do an octave, and a falsetto or vibrato and change tones.\"\n\nAguilar, who is bilingual but enjoys speaking in Spanish, said she probably learned more from seeing her father perform than from actual words of advice. In 2018, she was a Latin Grammy nominee for Best New Artist and her album \"Primero Soy Mexicana\" was nominated for Best Ranchero/Mariachi Album of the Year.\n\n\"I'm just very grateful for his patience in bringing me along and taking care of me,\" she said. \"I think the one thing he once told me is to be honest because people will not forget if you're dishonest ... to talk with honesty and without fear.\"\n\nAfter performing with him last year, Aguilar is returning to El Paso as part of her second solo tour Saturday at the Abraham Chavez Theatre.\n\nTeen singer honors Tejano legend with remixes\n\nShe is promoting her new album, \"Baila Esta Cumbia,\" which is a tribute to the late Tejano singer Selena Quintanilla.\n\nThe album features remixed versions of seven of the Tejano star's hits, including “Como La Flor,” “Bidi Bidi Bom Bom” and “No Me Queda Mas.\"\n\n\"I liked her music as a little girl,\" she said. \"And I think Selena was an inspiring woman, an American woman who wanted to sing in Spanish. And I believe there weren't as many women in her genre when she started, so she really opened doors.\"\n\nShe added, \"I love to dance and her songs are fun and just make me happy.\"\n\nAguilar said she's ready to return to El Paso and entertain families with a variety of songs from rancheras to cumbias.\n\nMore entertainment: Latin singer Alejandro Fernandez will bring his world tour to El Paso in September\n\nMore: 'It's going to be a party:' 80s Latin pop singer Lisa Lisa talks about upcoming show\n\nStay up-to-date on everything related to entertainment, restaurants and trending stories.
