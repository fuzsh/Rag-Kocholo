        "text": "\"Ahí va un puro mexicano\"\n\nOne of the earliest film by director Emilio \"El Indio\" Fernández, this is quite a strange one. The film pits Los Charros against Nazi agents. They trying to infiltrate Mexico for whatever reason.\n\nIt's tonally all over the place but it has its moments especially the musical segments.\n\nI didn't particularly enjoy it but I appreciated the effort.\n\nWatched a 120 minute version in Spanish.\n\nMexican Films I've Watched: List\n\nCharros vs. nazi spies. For reals. Emilio Fernandez pays his dues directing unambitious stuff so they'll give him a shot at his art-movies, like maybe next year? Deal?\n\nIt's not more ridiculous than a B-schedule Warners spy/war movie, but it's way tonally inconsistent -- there's enough straight-faced actionmelodrama stuff to satisfy an audience's simplest needs, but there's frequent lapses into deliberate self-parody -- dig the bombastic mock-epic music cues every time Pedro Armendariz appears on screen, or the climactic scene where he's operating a machine gun against an onslaught of axis agents... while holding a rooster under his arm.\n\nAvailable print is missing 40 minutes of footage, so you're only getting about 2/3 of the movie..."
