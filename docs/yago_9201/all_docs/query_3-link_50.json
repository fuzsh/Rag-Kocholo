        "text": "Music has little respect for borders.\n\nIt rides on air and infiltrates our bodies and minds. It mixes and recombines styles and genres, replicating through similarity and difference, location and kinship. It crosses boundaries, brings people together. It pierces the stupid walls of idiot men.\n\nArhoolie Foundation's Strachwitz Frontera Collection of Mexican and Mexican American Recordings comprises over 125,000 commercially produced recordings of music spanning from the early 1900s to the 1990s. With funding from Los Tigres del Norte Fund and hosted on the UCLA Digital Library, the UCLA Chicano Studies Research Center and UCLA Library partnered with Arhoolie to bring their digitization project online and make it more widely available for research and preservation. This collection is the largest repository of its kind in existence. This exhibition highlights the breadth of the collection, discussing the history of music and the ways history is represented in music. Utilizing materials from over a dozen of the CSRC’s archival collections, the exhibition offers a gateway to the Strachwitz Frontera Collection’s vast and invaluable holdings.\n\nExhibition curated by Doug Johnson, organized by Xaviera Flores and Matthew Vest, and supported by the UCLA Music Library and the UCLA Ethnomusicology Archive. Exhibit design by Matthew Vest. Yuri Shimoda developed the digital exhibit and design, Nick Carlozzi contributed to the exhibit case installation and digital editing, Doug Daniels managed the exhibit materials printing, and Jonathan Wilson configured the listening station.\n\nOne of the most significant examples of a person being immortalized by a corrido is Gregorio Cortez, a Texas farmer who killed a sheriff in self-defense and then evaded authorities for several days. He was the subject of several songs (the Frontera Collection has about 30 different versions) and a 1982 feature film starring Edward James Olmos. A 1929 rendition by Trovadores Regionales was added to the National Recording Registry in 2005.\n\nListen on the Frontera website: \"Gregorio Cortez\" by Trovadores Regionales\n\nSee also: http://frontera.library.ucla.edu/blog/2017/11/\n\nDuring the Great Depression, white resentment in the wake of economic calamity, coupled with a racist president’s calls for deportation, led to what is known as the Mexican Repatriation. As many as 2 million people of Mexican descent moved “back” to Mexico, though perhaps 60% of these were U.S. citizens by right of birth. Some of these mass deportations bore the veneer of voluntary migration, though most were certainly coerced. Musicians of the era documented this sad, shameful chapter of U.S. history that seems to be on the verge of happening again. In the 1930s, they at least let the families stay together.\n\nListen on the Frontera website: “El Deportado” by Los Hermanos Banuelos\n\nSee also: http://frontera.library.ucla.edu/blog/2016/04/\n\n\"Deportee Carlos Tamborrell with his children Mary Louise and Carlos Jr., Los Angeles, 1935” from the\n\nLos Angeles Times Photographic Archive, UCLA Library Special Collections\n\nFrom the Los Angeles Times, January 12, 1932\n\nPedro J. Gonzalez was a veteran of the Mexican Revolution who emigrated to Los Angeles, where he became a musician and a popular radio personality. His tireless civil rights activism made him the target of the Anglo establishment, which managed to frame him for rape, for which he was sentenced to 50 years in San Quentin. His unjust imprisonment put him in an unusual position: he became the subject of corridos, as well as a performer of them. In a recording of “Corrido de Pedro J. Gonzalez,” his band, Los Madrugadores, plays a tribute to him written by the Los Angeles-based composer Felipe Valdés Leal.\n\nListen on the Frontera website: “Corrido de Pedro J. González” by Los Madrugadores, Part 1 and “Corrido de Pedro J. González” by Los Madrugadores, Part 2\n\nGonzález was released from prison in 1940, after serving six years, on the condition that he be deported to Mexico.\n\nSee also: http://frontera.library.ucla.edu/blog/2016/11/\n\n>\n\nItems from the Pedro J. Gonzalez Papers, UCLA CSRC Archives."
