        "text": "Mexican singer and actress Flor Silvestre has died at 90 in her ranch “El Soyate” located in Zacatecas, Mexico, Billboard has confirmed. Silvestre was the wife of regional Mexican icon Antonio Aguilar and mother to Pepe Aguilar.\n\nAccording to an official press release, she died of natural causes the morning of Nov. 25. “The Aguilar family is thankful for those who always showed affection toward Flor,” the statement reads. “The family asks for privacy at this moment.”\n\nIn her 70-year career, the songstress born Guillermina Jiménez Chabolla was known for starring in classic black-and-white films as one of the leading stars of the “golden age” of the Mexican film industry, where she’d act and sing, showcasing her one-of-a-kind melodious voice.\n\nTrending on Billboard\n\nSilvestre — sister of fellow singer Enriqueta “Queta” Jiménez, who is known as “La Prieta Linda” — recorded ranchera, bolero, bolero ranchero, tambora and huapango in her more than 300 songs.\n\nBorn Aug. 16, 1930, Silvestre married actor and singer Antonio Aguilar, who died in 2007, in 1959, with whom she pioneered the Mexican folk equestrian shows. They had two sons: Toño and Pepe Aguilar. Silvestre is the grandmother of rising regional Mexican singers Angela and Leonardo Aguilar."
