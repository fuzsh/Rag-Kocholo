With a creative team that regularly included cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa, writer Mauricio Magdaleno, and stars such as Dolores del Río, Pedro Armendáriz, María Félix, Arturo de Córdova, and Ninón Sevilla, Fernández created an authentic Latino voice that continues to enchant and amaze, now returned to its full force and timbre in magnificent new restorations from the Mexican archives.\" —MoMA"
