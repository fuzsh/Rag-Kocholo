Is it possible that certain behavior patterns have been inherited?\n\nThey come out to say the worst thing about Ángela’s grandmother\n\nThe romance between Ángela Aguilar and Christian Nodal has been under public criticism since its confirmation.\n\nRumors of a possible engagement, fueled by a leaked video showing a ring on Angela’s finger, have kept the couple in the ‘eye of the hurricane’.\n\nIn the midst of all this, comments arose about the Aguilar family and, particularly, about Flor Silvestre, the iconic Mexican singer and actress, and Angela’s grandmother.\n\nThe controversy recalls Flor Silvestre’s own love story and the challenges she faced.\n\nWhat was the controversial love story?\n\nFlor Silvestre and Antonio Aguilar were an emblematic couple in regional Mexican music, staying together from their wedding in 1959 until Antonio’s death in 2007.\n\nTheir relationship, admired by many, was marked by respect and mutual admiration, free of scandals throughout the decades, according to the magazine Caras.\n\nFlor and Antonio met on a radio show and it took them eight years to start their relationship.\n\nDespite the challenges, which included Flor’s marriage to Paco Malgesto and Antonio’s jealousy, they managed to overcome all obstacles.\n\nShe left him and married Antonio Aguilar\n\nFlor, whose marriage to Paco Malgesto was on the decline due to his infidelities, found in Antonio a friendship that eventually turned into love.\n\nFinally, Flor decided to separate from Paco and married Antonio, the magazine Caras reported.\n\nThe above, consolidating a relationship that gave rise to two sons who would also follow in his footsteps in music: Antonio Aguilar Jr. and Pepe Aguilar.\n\nThe recent controversy surrounding Angela and Nodal has led many to compare their relationship to that of Flor and Antonio, suggesting that public relations problems and controversial decisions are a familiar pattern."
