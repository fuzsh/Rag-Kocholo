        "text": "LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Angela Aguilar comes from a famous musical family.\n\nHer grandparents were Antonio Aguilar and Flor Silvestre - both singers, actors and Mexican superstars. Dad is four-time Grammy-winning singer Pepe Aguilar.\n\nNow Angela is making a name for herself. She's proud of her family legacy but excited to pave her own path.\n\n\"I think we're all on the same highway but we're on just different lanes,\" said Aguilar.\n\nAngela has been singing since she was a little girl. Her latest single is \"Mis Amigas Las Flores,\" or \"My Friends, The Flowers.\" It is about love and self-discovery.\n\n\"When a guy does something wrong, he'll send you flowers. And in this case, I had this guy I wanted to date, and he wanted to date me. And he would do such terrible things and send me, like, truckloads of flowers,\" said Aguilar. \"We decided to make the video seem kind of like, like if these flowers were actual company, were actually like people that were surrounding us.\"\n\nAngela said the guy she sings about here did one good thing. Without knowing it, he helped her write a good song. And when it comes to her music, honesty is important.\n\n\"I sing the things that I can't talk about, and I feel like a lot of people resonate with that,\" said Aguilar. \"And that's what I've seen. I feel you can spot a fake from a mile away. And you might have an amazing voice but if you really don't feel what you're doing and you're not doing it for the right reasons, I feel like people can see that. I'm not the girl that's singing these different songs with vulgar lyrics and stuff that are selling right now. I'm a girl talking about flowers and how it hurt and I'm going to do it with mariachi and if people like it, that'll be amazing!\"\n\nAguilar also knows the lane she wants to stay in.\n\n\"Personally, me, I like to sing songs that I'm not embarrassed to sing in front of my grandma or in front of my parents. I like to perform songs that everyone can feel, and I sometimes think that using bad words is just because you don't know better adjectives.\"\n\nAngela was born and raised in Los Angeles, and she learned how to be a singer here. Now 20 and singing for most her life, she says she is still learning."
