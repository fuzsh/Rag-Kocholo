        "text": "His is one of the most famous names in Mexican showbiz, and for the first time, Pepe Aguilar brings his music to far Northern California.\n\nOn Monday, he'll take the stage at Rolling Hills Casino with his family, his band and his multi-genre music.\n\nSince the early 1990s, Aguilar’s name has been synonymous with his eclectic repertoire; a modern mixture of Latin, pop, folk, Mexican banda, canción ranchera and Tejano music.\n\n“It is no secret that I am a rocker at heart,” Aguilar said of his use of rock and other genres in his music. “I developed my sound by incorporating structures and instruments that weren’t used in regional Mexican music (in the 1990s).”\n\nHis band of performers include mariachi, drums and other percussion instruments, electric and acoustic guitars and keyboards.\n\n“This is a fusion that is a lot of fun to play,\" because \"audiences really get into it,” Aguilar said. “The connection with the audience is what makes the shows so festive and memorable.”\n\nHis unique style launched and sustained his career. Aguilar’s 27-album canon sold more than 12 million copies. He won four Grammys, five Latin Grammys and 19 Lo Nuestro awards. He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame — next to his famous father's star, and usually plays to sold-out venues in the United States and Mexico.\n\n“The artist’s career is of constant beginnings,” Aguilar said of his latest current tour. “Every time a new album is out you have to start again. You can imagine that in a career of 30-plus years, I’ve had plenty of new beginnings.”\n\nWith his passion for performing in front of live audiences, it might seem Aguilar was born to tour.\n\nIn fact, he was born on tour.\n\nThe son of actor, producer and singer Antonio Aguilar and movie star and singer Flor Silvestre, José Antonio Aguilar Jiménez came into the world on Aug. 7, 1968 while his parents were performing in San Antonio, Texas.\n\nThis summer, he’s on tour again. Music is still an Aguilar family tradition: His band of performers include his daughter Angela and son Leonardo.\n\nAguilar said he’s looking forward to his first concert in the North State.\n\n“Even though the area is quite rural, music fans are everywhere, especially in California,” he said. “As you know, Latinos go back a very long way here. The fans that came to my parents’ shows — have children, and even grandchildren, that have a love for their roots. That includes music.”\n\nAbout Pepe Aguilar’s concert:\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Monday, Sept. 2\n\nWhere: Rolling Hills Casino, 2655 Everett Freeman Way in Corning\n\nCost: Tickets are $35-$125\n\nInformation: Call 528-3500 or go to https://rollinghillscasino.com/event/pepe-aguilar/\n\nREAD MORE FROM AROUND THE NORTH STATE:\n\nAnderson teacher wants to put Redding 'on the road' to becoming a theater hub\n\nChill out: Grill serves hot lunch while frost rail keeps your drink cool\n\nShasta County reports two more west Nile virus mosquito samples\n\nFive takeaways from Shasta College's football scrimmage\n\nGuns, fire, compromise: Here's where Assembly candidates stand on the issues ahead of primary"
