        "text": "During Mexican Revolution, Rosalio Mendoza (Del Diestro) survives by making and winning favors from both factions, the governmental forces and Zapata's Army. His hacienda welcomes everybody, and Mendoza is considered a good friend of his guests. Eventually, the situation becomes unsustainable and he has to take sides. Betrayal and deception overcome and Mendoza's dark side surfaces.\n\nThe Mexican Revolution is on its way when six brave peasants, known as \"Los Leones de San Pablo\", decide to join Pancho Villa's army and help end the suffering in their community by assisting in the struggle. After several battles and valiant heroics, the original group is eventually reduced to the leader Tiburcio Maya (Frausto) and young Becerrillo (Vallarino). When Becerrillo is infected by smallpox, Villa orders Tiburcio to kill him and burn the corpse. After reluctantly doing his duty, Tiburcio is ordered to leave the army, and returns home.\n\nEmiliano Zapata was a peasant who understood the ideals of the working class. He became a figurehead of the revolutionary uprising in Mexico and his life as a leader, his wife and the battles of those who fight alongside him are portrayed. He lead an ongoing battle to redistribute lands to the peasants and fought against the powerful and oppressing regime of Porfirio Diaz.\n\nOne of the films in the series of seven tales that tell, in a funny sort of way, different stories lived by Pancho Villa and several characters from the small town, this time a priest, a butcher, high society people, revolution fighters and children.\n\nEl Prisionero 13 (Prisoner 13) is part of the trilogy of films made by Fernando Fuentes concerning the Mexican Revolution. The film centers on the drunkard Colonel Carrasco, whose wife Marta leaves him taking his young son. The child, Juan, grows into an admirable and well-mannered young man. Having been promoted to a higher rank of power amidst the Mexican Revolution, the indulgent and corrupt Colonel accepts a bribe to free a revolutionary, Felipe Martinez, from his prison. Martinez has been sentenced to execution at the hands of a firing squad. Carrasco asks to have the revolutionary replaced by absolutely anyone. In a twist of fate, that anyone turns out to be his own long lost son Juan. Upon receiving this news, Marta races to the prison and explains the predicament to Carrasco. He subsequently desperately attempts to prevent the gunning down of his son by his very own government officials.\n\nThe disembodied head of Pancho Villa, kept in a glass jar in a research institute, is the narrator of several short stories from his own life, stories that might or might not have happened but are the stuff of legend."
