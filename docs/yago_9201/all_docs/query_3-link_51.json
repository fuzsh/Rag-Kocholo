        "text": "MEXICO CITY, June 20 — Antonio Aguilar, the film star and ranchera singer who was considered the undisputed master of his genre for decades, died here on Tuesday. He was 88.\n\nThe cause was pneumonia after a battle with heart disease, a hospital spokeswoman, Shere Sanchez, said.\n\nNews of his death led to nationwide mourning for him as a symbol of the Mexican charro culture as well as a lastingly popular singer and actor.\n\nBorn in Zacatecas, a state in northern Mexico, in May 1919, during the Mexican revolution, Mr. Aguilar rose to the top of the Mexican country-music scene with his powerful voice and poignant lyrics. He recorded more than 150 albums in a half-century.\n\nHe composed classics of the ranchera genre like “Triste Recuerdo,” “Gabino Barrera” and “Un Puño de Tierra,” which are still sung throughout Mexico, often in cantinas and at parties, and which often evoke the intense melancholy just beneath the surface of life here.\n\n“Life soon ends and of what happens in this world only a memory remains/ When I die I will carry with me no more than a fistful of dirt,” go the concluding lines of “Un Puño de Tierra,” a song urging people to seize the day.\n\nMr. Aguilar studied singing and filmmaking for several years in Hollywood during the early 1940s, and when he returned to Mexico he made the transition to acting, eventually becoming a screenwriter and producer as well.\n\nHe was perhaps best known for portraying historical figures, like his memorable interpretation as the title role in “Emiliano Zapata,” a 1970 film about that rebel leader. He also appeared in the 1969 Hollywood film “The Undefeated,\" starring John Wayne, in which he played a Mexican general fighting for President Benito Juárez. In 2000 he was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nBut he never stopped working as a musician. He was the first Mexican singer to mix his concerts with a traditional rodeo show, known in Mexico as a charrería, which features dancing horses, lavish costumes and cowboy stunts. He toured with his wife, the singer Flor Silvestre, and their sons, Pepe and Antonio Jr., both musicians.\n\nIn the 1970s Mr. Aguilar took his show to major cities across the United States and Latin America, helping to spread the popularity of ranchera music, with its straight march and waltz beats and its sometimes mournful, sometimes humorous lyrics. He also became an unofficial ambassador of the charro culture, with its folkloric songs; traditional costumes, typified by mariachi musicians; and stunning feats of horsemanship. He was nicknamed El Charro de Mexico.\n\n“Antonio was the one to open doors for us in the United States and in Latin America with his great show,” said Vincente Fernández, another well-known ranchera singer.\n\nMr. Aguilar was one of the few Latino artists of his generation to fill Madison Square Garden for six consecutive nights. At the height of his popularity he was received by Presidents Carter and Reagan at the White House.\n\nMr. Aguilar grew up on a hacienda near Villanueva that his family had built 400 years before. His full name was Pascual Antonio Aguilar Barraza. As a young man he toyed with becoming a priest, worked as a mechanic and even won a scholarship to learn to fly in New York State.\n\nIn the end, however, his love of singing led him to move to Southern California to study opera under a master there, Andrés de Segurola. Later he gave up on an opera career and returned to his roots, to the ranchera ballads he had grown up with, and found his artistic niche. He married Miss Silvestre, his longtime companion and singing partner, in 1959.\n\nMr. Aguilar’s death seemed to wound this country. President Felipe Calderón visited the funeral home Wednesday afternoon to pay condolences just before a long funeral procession carried Mr. Aguilar’s remains to the Basílica de Guadalupe, the holiest Roman Catholic shrine in Mexico, where more than 2,000 mourners packed the aisles. Plans were made to hold memorial services in Mexico City, Zacatecas and, finally, at the family ranch, where Mr. Aguilar is to be buried."
