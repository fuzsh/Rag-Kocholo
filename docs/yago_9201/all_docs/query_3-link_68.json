He’s the son of Pepe Aguilar, who owns a surname that generates a great responsibility, but also supports him to continue with a legacy of great artists.

Leonardo together with his sister Angela recently became ambassadors of Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles. They pledged to donate a dollar from the sale of each album to help the most needy children in the hospital.\n\nRegardless of his young age, Leonardo is not afraid of the big stages or a large audience. A few years ago he was part of the farewell tour of his grandfather Antonio Aguilar. In one part of the show he sang a song next to him of his cousins ​​and siblings and even had the opportunity to also accompany his father in some of his presentations. He simply takes over the microphone in a creamy way ripping the applause of the people.\n\nAlthough Leonardo Aguilar is just beginning his career, he already has a distinction that other singers in a lifetime of trajectory do not achieve.
