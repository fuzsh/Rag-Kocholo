Emilio FernÃ¡ndez is well known as one of the biggest directors of classical Mexican cinema in the 1940s, who made a string of critical successes that attracted global critical attention and acclaim, including MarÃ­a Candelaria (1943), Flor Silvestre (1943), and Las abandonadas (1944). What is less well known is that, as a young man between 1926 and 1933, he lived and worked in Los Angeles as a Hollywood extra and bit player. Using textual analysis of his small appearances in five key films, this article shifts the focus onto the under-studied figure of the extra to explore FernÃ¡ndezâs little known sojourn in Hollywood. It argues that allowing attention to be drawn away from the centre of the films to FernÃ¡ndez on the margins makes space for a centering of Latinx experiences in early sound era Hollywood otherwise ignored in scholarship, and for a greater understanding of the role extras played in shifting representational imperatives as the film industry made its transition to sound.
