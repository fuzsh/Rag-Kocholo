Sydney History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms

Origins Available:

England

The name Sydney was brought to England in the wave of migration that followed the Norman Conquest of 1066. The Sydney family lived in St Denis, Normandy. 1 One noted author agrees with this generally accepted premise, but he points out that "proof is lacking. The only evidence noted is: Roger de Sancto Dionisio 1212 Fees for Norfolk." He feels that the name more likely originated at Sidney Farm, in Alfold, Surrey and meant "dweller by the wide well-watered land." 2

Early Origins of the Sydney family

The surname Sydney was first found in Kent where they settled in Lewes Priory in 1188, coming from Anjou in Normandy. The founder of this family in England was Sir William Sydney, Chamberlain of King Henry II., who came from Anjou with that monarch, and was buried at Lewes Priory, East Sussex in 1188. 3 In Surrey, we also found John ate Sydenye in the Subsidy Rolls for 1332 and in Sussex, William Sydny was recorded in 1428. 2

The Hundredorum Rolls of 1273 included: Richard de Sanct' Deonise, Norfolk; and Robert de Sanct' Deonisio, Devon. 4

Sydney Spelling Variations

Spelling variations in names were a common occurrence in the eras before English spelling was standardized a few hundred years ago. In the Middle Ages, even the literate regularly changed the spellings of their names as the English language incorporated elements of French, Latin, and other European languages. Many variations of the name Sydney have been found, including Sidney, Sydney and others.

Sydney migration to the United States +

For many English families, the social climate in England was oppressive and lacked opportunity for change. For such families, the shores of Ireland, Australia, and the New World beckoned. They left their homeland at great expense in ships that were overcrowded and full of disease. Many arrived after the long voyage sick, starving, and without a penny. But even those were greeted with greater opportunity than they could have experienced back home. Numerous English settlers who arrived in the United States and Canada at this time went on to make important contributions to the developing cultures of those countries. Many of those families went on to make significant contributions to the rapidly developing colonies in which they settled. Early North American records indicate many people bearing the name Sydney were among those contributors:

The Sydney Motto +

The motto was originally a war cry or slogan. Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.

Motto: Quo fata vocant

Motto Translation: Wherever fate may summon me.
