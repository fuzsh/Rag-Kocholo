        "text": "By Katherine L. Babson, Jr., Trustee\n\nBabsons have fought in wars in America since the end of the seventeenth century until current times. They have fought in King Philip’s War, the American Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Civil War (with Babsons fighting for the North and other Babsons, for the South), World Wars I and II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the current conflagrations. They have fought in the infantry and the calvary and on the sea, both in the Navy and as privateers.\n\nThis section will be expanded as time goes on. For now, it covers the Babsons who fought in King Philip’s War, the American Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, World War I, Korean War and the Vietnam War.\n\nNOTE: The reference to generation and number are keyed to The Babson Genealogy 1606-2017, Descendants of Thomas and Isabel Babson by Alicia Crane Williams, FASG.\n\nKING PHILIP’S WAR\n\n(1675-1676 in Southern New England)\n\nKing Philip’s War, also known as the First Indian War, the Great Narragansett War or Metacom’s Rebellion, took place in southern New England from 1675 to 1676. It was the Native Americans’ last-ditch effort to avoid recognizing English authority and stop English settlement on their native lands. It left several hundred colonists dead and dozens of English settlements destroyed or heavily damaged. Thousands of Indians were killed, wounded or captured and sold into slavery or indentured servitude. The war mostly ended Indian resistance in southern New England, paving the way for additional English settlements.\n\nThere was only one Babson who fought in this war:\n\nTHOMAS BABSON (third generation #6) born in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in 1658 and was lost at sea between 1677/8 and 1679. During King Philip’s War, he served as a soldier in the Massachusetts Militia led by Capt. William Turner’s Company at Hadley, Massachusetts and Hampton, New Hampshire. Rights to the land granted to Thomas in Kettle Cove on Cape Ann for his service in the war was given to his brother, John, in 1696/97.\n\nAMERICAN REVOLUTIONARY WAR\n\n(1776-1783)\n\nThere were six Babsons who fought in the American Revolutionary War, two of whom died in the conflict, and another who died from wounds afflicted on him. They, and other Babsons, also played significant roles as Privateers, which is a section “in progress”.\n\nWILLIAM BABSON (1721-1775) (fifth generation #19) was born in Gloucester and was the son of John and Hannah (Hodgkins) Babson. He was apparently the unfortunate soul who led the Royal Navy Captain into Gloucester Harbor soon after the declaration of war with England in the American Revolutionary War. William’s death in 1775 was “occasioned or hastened” by the Battle of Gloucester. He and his wife had 6 children. He was 54.\n\nSee more on William and the Battle of Gloucester.\n\nISAAC BABSON (1759-1800) (sixth generation #22), born in Wenham, Massachusetts, was the first Babson to graduate from Harvard College, Class of 1779. While he was still a student, Isaac enlisted in Capt. George Minot’s company of Col. Eleazer Brooks’ regiment and served from March 4-9, 1776 during the occupation of Dorchester Heights, Massachusetts. With cannon procured by Benedict Arnold and Ethan Allen and his Green Mountain boys in the battle of Fort Ticonderoga the previous spring, the victory at Dorchester Heights led to the evacuation of the British from Boston on March 17, 1776 (now locally celebrated as “Evacuation Day”). After graduation, Isaac became a steward on the privateer ship, Buccaneer. At his death in 1800, he left a wife and four children.,\n\nCAPTAIN SAMUEL BABSON (1740/1-1805) (sixth generation #26), born in Gloucester, was one of 16 men from Gloucester to serve in the war. Capt. Samuel served as a mariner on the ship Vengeance as part of the 44-ship naval armada on the expedition to Penobscot in August 1779. The Expedition’s goal was to reclaim control of mid-coast Maine from the British who had captured it a month earlier, naming it New Ireland. It was the largest American naval expedition of the war and the United States’ worst naval defeat until Pearl Harbor in 1941.\n\nIn 1780-81, Capt. Samuel commanded two privateers, the brig Ranger, and the brig Ruby, both with crews of 20 men. After the war, he owned two schooners, one of which, Sally, was captured by the French in 1797. His descendants filed claims under French Spoliation law. More than 100 years later, in 1907, Congress made an award for the claimed losses.\n\nCapt. Samuel died in 1805 at age 65. He and his wife had 5 children.\n\nJOHN BABSON 3rd (1746/47-about 1791) (sixth generation #27), probably served as matross (i.e., gunner’s mate) in Capt. William Ellery’s 1st company in Gloucester in 1776. He joined his brother, Capt. Samuel above, on the brig, Vengeance, in the disastrous Penobscot expedition in 1779 to rid the Maine coast of the British. It is presumed he was lost at sea in 1791 at about age 54. He had married and had one son.\n\nNATHANIEL STEVENS BABSON (1749-died after 1775) (sixth generation #28), like his brothers, Capt. Samuel and John (above), Nathaniel served in the Revolutionary War. In May 1775, he enlisted in Capt. Ezra Lunt’s Company of Col. Moses Little’s Regiment. He served at the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775, a failed attempt to end the British siege of Boston.\n\nNathaniel re-enlisted in Capt. Samuel Ward’s Company for Benedict Arnold’s expedition to Quebec with the intention of capturing Quebec City from the British. The Continental Army troops arrived, exhausted and hungry, and began a siege of the City in December 1775. They finally launched an assault on December 31. It was a devastating loss and Nathaniel was one of 350 men who were captured. No further record exists for him. He was about age 26 at that time.\n\nABRAHAM BABSON (1761-1839) (sixth generation #37) was born in Gloucester and moved with his family to Babson’s Ridge in Sedgwick, now Brooklin, Maine, in 1773. They were the first of many Babsons who ultimately lived in the area.\n\nAbraham enlisted in 1779 and served as a private in Capt. Nathaniel Fales’ Company. The Company was under the command of General Solomon Lovell who led the land forces of the failed Penobscot Expedition to dislodge the British from the mid-Maine coast around Castine.\n\nAbraham and his wife had 14 children, only one of whom died in infancy. He died at age 78.\n\nWAR OF 1812\n\n(June 1812-February 1815)\n\nThe War of 1812 was a conflict fought between the United States and Great Britain over British violations of U.S. maritime rights. It was ended with the Treaty of Ghent that restored pre-War boundaries. Britain recognized international immunity for US citizens and provided freedom of the seas for US merchant ships. Although there are only five Babsons who fought in this war, other Babsons played significant roles as privateers.\n\nNOTE: The reference to generation and number are keyed to The Babson Genealogy 1606-2017, Descendants of Thomas and Isabel Babson by Alicia Crane Williams, FASG.\n\nJOHN BABSON (1781-1825) (seventh generation #45) was born in Gloucester. He and his wife moved to Wiscasset, Maine, where he was the editor of the local paper, a merchant and ship owner. He served as a private in Capt. H. Whitney’s Company of Lt. Col. E. Cutter’s Regiment at Wiscasset for two short periods from June 20 to 24 and September 10 to 28, 1814. The British had succeeded in obtaining control of the mid-Maine coast. John joined others from Wiscasset and saw service there.\n\nJohn died in 1825 at age 44. He and his wife, Abigail Hughes (Hues) Babson, had 12 children, 5 of whom died in infancy and the twelfth child of whom was born posthumously.\n\nJAMES BABSON (1795-1844) (seventh generation #48), brother of John Babson (above), was born in Gloucester.\n\nHe is probably the James who served as a private in Capt. Dudley Sargent’s Company in Lt. Col. John Appleton’s Regiment in the Massachusetts Militia. He may have given service in Gloucester on September 19, 1814 “at the battle with the barges of the enemy”.\n\nJames died in Amesbury, Massachusetts, in 1844 at age 49. He was survived by his wife and their four children.\n\nJOHN BABSON (1786-c.1825) (seventh generation #51) was born in Gloucester. He probably was the “John Babson” who served in Capt. A Potter’s Company in Lt. Col. E. Cutter’s Regiment from July 12-13, 1814 at Wiscasset, Maine. He died around 1825, at age 39, probably leaving a wife and a son who was born after the war.\n\nEBEN BABSON (1792-1841) (seventh generation #52), brother of John (#51), was born in Gloucester and moved with his family to Maine in 1798. He served in Capt. J.O. Hotchkiss’ Company in the Massachusetts Militia. He received a pension.\n\nEben was the 8th of the 11 children of Capt. John (#31) and Susannah (Rogers) Babson. Capt. John was a privateer in both the American Revolutionary War and in the War of 1812. Capt. John moved his family to Somesville, the earliest European settlement on Mount Desert Island, Maine.\n\nEben died in Somesville, survived by his wife and 5 children, all of whom were born after the war.\n\nJOSEPH BABSON (1794-1881) (seventh generation #64) was born and died at Babson’s Ridge in Sedgwick on Penobscot Bay, Maine. He served as a member of Phineas Emerson’s Company in Col. Andrew Grant’s Battalion of the Massachusetts Militia.\n\nJoseph saw action at the Battle of Hampden on September 3, 1814. It was a British victory, Hampden was sacked and many prisoners were taken. It was the last serious battle on land in Maine and represented the end of two centuries of conflict over the sovereignty of district of Maine. Britain removed its expeditionary force from its base in nearby Castine, thus ensuring that eastern Maine would remain a part of the United States, whose boundary was settled by the Treaty of Ghent. The lack of support by Massachusetts was a factor in the subsequent movement for Maine statehood.\n\nJoseph married Emma (Freethy) after the war. She and their four children survived him.\n\nAMERICAN CIVIL WAR\n\n(1861-1865)\n\nBabsons fought for both sides in the Civil War. There are records of 16 Babsons who fought for the Union and 5 for the Confederacy. Father/sons/brothers/cousins enlisted together and cousins found themselves on opposite sides of the War. Of the 21 Babsons who saw service, 6 died, 5 were wounded and 3 were taken as prisoners of war.\n\nNOTE: The reference to generation and number are keyed to The Babson Genealogy 1606-2017, Descendants of Thomas and Isabel Babson by Alicia Crane Williams, FASG.\n\nFOR THE NORTH / Union\n\nSIMEON ELLIS ALLEN (1843-1864) (eighth generation #38iv.6) was born in Sedgwick (now Brooklin, Maine), one of eight children of Louisa Babson and her husband, Simeon Allen, a state representative. Simeon died in the Army on July 31, 1864. Presumably he had enlisted in the Maine Infantry and may have participated in the Richmond-Petersburg Virginia campaign—often known as the Siege of Petersburg, a series of battles around Petersburg from June 15, 1864-April 2, 1865.\n\nEDWIN BABSON (1831-1879) (eighth generation #87) was born in West Newbury, Massachusetts. He served in the U.S. Navy in the eastern and western Gulf, first aboard the Sagamore and later, on the R.R. Cuyler. He was appointed acting master’s mate on November 11, 1861, then in June 1862 named as acting master until his discharge on November 1, 1865. Both vessels were wooden screw steamers, steam ships that were powered by steam engines. The Union Navy played an important role in winning the Civil War with its blockade of 3,500 miles of Confederate coastline. When Edwin joined the U.S. Navy in 1861, he was one of only 9,000 seamen and when he was discharged 4 years later, there were about 59,000 sailors.\n\nEdwin married before the war and had two children born before the war, and two after the war. Edwin was the captain of a full-rigged barque, the Lizzie, which made voyages to the Orient and around the Cape of Good Hope. On a trip to Calcutta in 1879, with his wife and two of their children, Edwin died and was buried in Cardiff, Wales.\n\nWASHINGTON BABSON (1824-1896) (eighth generation #97) was born in Portland, Maine. President Lincoln’s first call for volunteers for the Union Army was in April 1861 and it required the State of Maine to raise one regiment of infantry for three months of Federal service. Washington enlisted in Company D, 1st Regiment, Maine Volunteer Infantry on April 27, 1861. The regiment of 779 soldiers was transferred to Washington, D.C. where it encamped on Meridian Hill, a strategic location overlooking the capital. The regiment saw no combat.\n\nAlthough the required federal service was three months, all of the soldiers, including Washington, had enlisted for 2 or 3 years. At the end of the three months, he joined Company E, 25th Regiment, Maine Infantry in September 1862 for 9 months of Federal service. This Regiment served garrison duty in the defense of the capital. He was mustered out with an honorable discharge in Portland on July 10, 1863 due to “nervous and physical prostration and heart disease”.\n\nWashington was married and had three children before the war, two of whom died in infancy. He divorced after the war and remarried. He was admitted to the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Veterans in Milwaukee in 1887 at the age of 63. He was widowed by that time.\n\nLt. JOSEPH B. BABSON (1839-1915) (eighth generation #117) was born in Sedgwick (now Brooklin), Maine. He enlisted on October 22, 1861 in Company H, 4th Regiment, Maine Volunteer Infantry for three years. He was promoted to corporal on March 1, 1862 and was detailed as Division Provost Guard from March 7 to April 24, 1862. His regiment participated in all the important battles in the Army of the Potomac (e.g., Battles of Gettysburg, the Wilderness, Spotsylvania Courthouse). The regiment was involved in Malvern Hill, the last of the Seven Days Battles that took place outside of Richmond, Virginia, the Confederate capital in July 1962. It is assumed Lt. Joseph was wounded there because he was in a hospital at Harrison’s Landing and Point Lookout, Maryland in August 1862. He was promoted to first sergeant and then suffered a gunshot wound to the thigh on November 27, 1863.\n\nHe was in MacDougall Army Hospital in Fort Schuyler, New York in July 1864 at the end of his three years of Federal service at which time he was transferred to the Army Hospital in Augusta, Maine. Lt. Joseph was declared “fit for duty” on October 29, 1864 at a camp near Petersburg, Virginia. He mustered in again and the Veteran Volunteers were transferred to Company F, 19th Regiment, Maine Infantry. He no doubt participated in the Richmond-Petersburg Virginia campaign—often known as the Siege of Petersburg, a series of battles around Petersburg from June 15, 1864-April 2, 1865. He was promoted to second lieutenant and mustered out as lieutenant in Bailey’s Crossroads, Virginia on May 31, 1865 following the Union victory.\n\nLt. Joseph married after the war and had two children, one of whom died in infancy. He was a widower and married again. He served as a Selectman in his native town of Brooklin from 1880-1883 and again from 1888-1891.\n\nCHARLES LEROY BABSON (1841-1922) (eighth generation #120) was born in Sedgwick (now Brooklin), Maine. He enlisted on July 28, 1862 for a three year tour of duty in Company K, 16th Regiment, Maine Volunteer Infantry. He received a gunshot wound to his left leg at the Battle of Fredericksburg on December 13, 1862. Gangrene set in which ultimately led to the amputation of his leg just below his hip. Charles was first sent to the General Hospital in Washington, D.C. and then received his disability discharge from Lovell General Hospital in Rhode Island.\n\nOn learning of a message from Army Headquarters that Charles had died, his brother, William, travelled to Rhode Island to bring home his body. Meanwhile, the nurse noticed movement in Charles’ finger and Charles was “brought back to life”. On brother William’s trip home alone, he caught pneumonia and died a few weeks later.\n\nCharles became engaged just before he entered the Infantry and he married at the end of the war. They had three children, the youngest of whom was born while Charles was the Keeper of the Pumpkin Island Lighthouse in Penobscot Bay in Maine, where he was Keeper for more than 30 years. See here to read a profile on Charles.\n\nJAMES EDWARD BABSON (1835-1903) (ninth generation #126) was born in Rhode Island and married in Wisconsin before the Civil War. He enlisted in Company B, 31st Regiment, Wisconsin Infantry on August 15, 1862. His regiment was involved in The Atlanta Campaign, a series of battles fought in southwest Georgia and around Atlanta in the summer of 1864. The Regiment also saw action in the Battle of Bentonville, North Carolina from March 19-21, 1865.\n\nJames was honorably discharged on June 20, 1865, at the end of the Civil War, near Lewiston, Louisiana. He suffered from deafness and severe liver trouble after the war and received a pension in 1891 after Congress broadened the categories for qualification for Civil War pensions in 1890.\n\nJames’ brother, Henry Pierce Babson (#127), also enlisted in the Union Army but with a regiment from Pennsylvania.\n\nJames and his wife had a child in 1861 who died in infancy. They had three more children after the war, one of whom died in infancy.\n\nAfter the war, James was a member of the County Board of Supervisors in Blockton, Iowa, where he and his family had settled and where he died. He was active in the Grand Army of the Republic (G.A.R.), a fraternal organization of Union Army veterans.\n\nHENRY PIERCE BABSON (1840-1913) (ninth generation #127) was born in Rhode Island. He served as a sergeant in Company F, 9th Regiment, Rhode Island Volunteer Infantry, from May 26 to September 2, 1862. His regiment saw garrison duty outside of Washington, D.C. for the 3 month enlistment period.\n\nHenry’s brother, James Edward Babson (#126), also enlisted in the Union Army but with a regiment from Wisconsin.\n\nHenry married in 1861 before the beginning of the Civil War. He was divorced after the war, remarried and divorced again. He married for the third time in 1885. He had no children\n\nHenry was a proprietor of general stores in Coventry Centre and Hope Village, Rhode Island.\n\nERASTUS WALCOTT BABSON (1828-1884) (ninth generation #128) was born in Coventry, Rhode Island. He enlisted in Company A, Rhode Island 12th Infantry on October 13, 1862 for a 9 month muster. He was in one of the 12 infantry regiments in the Civil War from Rhode Island. His regiment saw action in the disastrous Union defeat at Fredericksburg, Virginia in December 1862 and then in the abortive offensive, the Mud March, from January 20-24, 1863, an attempt to cross the Rappahannock River to reach Richmond, the Confederate capital. He mustered out in July 1863. He applied for a pension in 1880 which was denied but an application for a pension was approved for his widow in 1885.\n\nErastus was married, divorced and remarried. He had no children. He was described as a “machinist” in the 1850 census.\n\nHENRY WHITMAN BABSON (1843-1935) (ninth generation #132) was born in Woodstock, Connecticut. He enlisted in Company K, 18th Connecticut Volunteers on August 9, 1862. He was taken prisoner in June 1863 in the Second Battle of Winchester (Virginia). The Confederates captured Winchester and took many Union prisoners, including most of troops in his regiment. Henry was a prisoner-in-war in Libby, a confederate military prison, in Richmond, Virginia, for officer prisoners-of-war. Henry was then moved to Belle Isle prison, a confederate prison in the James River, for non-commissioned officers and privates. It was a tented prison, subject to harsh winters and excessive summer heat, and subject to disease. Henry was paroled and sent home. He had had typhoid fever and malaria. He was returned to his regiment and saw two engagements in the Shenandoah Valley that was the location of operations and battles from May to October, 1864. Henry was discharged at Harpers Ferry on June 27, 1865 at the end of the war.\n\nHenry married on the day he enlisted in the infantry in August 1862 and divorced soon after the war. He did not remarry and had no children. He was active in veterans’ organizations in Connecticut throughout his lifetime.\n\nCongress broadened the qualifications for Civil War pensions in 1890. He applied for a pension in 1892.\n\nJOHN WARNER BABSON (1834-1911) (ninth generation #133) was born in Hopkinton, Rhode Island. He enlisted in Company M, Pennsylvania 4th Calvary Regiment on August 13, 1861. He served as a quartermaster sergeant. The 4th participated in battles at Antietam, Fredericksburg and Mud March before he mustered out on March 26, 1863 at Potomac Creek, Virginia. He received a pension.\n\nJohn married in 1872 and had two step-children. He and his wife divorced about 10 years later and had no children. He was listed as a “wagon maker” in the 1880 census.\n\nFRANCIS H. (FRANK) BABSON (1843-1904) (ninth generation #141) was born in Gloucester and was the son of Captain Edward and Amanda Babson. For more on his parents, see Captain Edward and Amanda Babson.\n\nFrank enlisted as a private in Company G, 8th Regiment, Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. The 8th Regiment of infantry was activated for federal service in the Union Army for three separate tours. The regiment consisted almost entirely of companies from Essex County, Massachusetts. Frank and his second cousin, Osman (#146), also from Gloucester, joined on September 15, 1862, for the second tour of the Regiment for a term of 9 months. The regiment was stationed in New Bern, North Carolina and participated in several expeditions and saw minor skirmishing. He mustered out on August 7, 1862.\n\nBy 1900, Frank was in San Diego, California. He did not marry and had no children.\n\nOSMAN BABSON (1842-1908) (ninth generation #146) was born in Gloucester. Osman enlisted as a private in Company G, 8th Regiment, Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry. The 8th Regiment of infantry was activated for federal service in the Union Army for three separate tours. The regiment consisted almost entirely of companies from Essex County, Massachusetts. Osman and his second cousin, Frank (#141), also from Gloucester, joined on September 15, 1862, for the second tour of the Regiment for a term of 9 months.
