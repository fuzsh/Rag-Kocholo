Kathy also traveled to visit her kids and grandchildren, whether at their homes or on family trips, cherishing every moment with them. Kathy lived her life as a strong, independent woman who deeply loved and cared for her family and many good friends. Her legacy of love, creativity, and generosity will be remembered and cherished by all who knew her.

Known to his Maine friends and family as Mickey, his New Hampshire friends and family as \"Larry The Lion\" and his Florida friends as Larry. In 1956 he met his future wife Diane Thorne, and married her on April 23, 1960. Friends and family only gave them 3 years because they argued constantly. Boy did they prove everyone wrong as they were together for 64 years and married for 60 years. He built two empires in his lifetime, but will always be known for The Hungry Lion Restaurant, which he owned and operated for 18 years in Keene, NH. The Hungry Lion was arguably one of the most noted restaurants in the New England area. He was an accomplished chef and was known for making anything anyone wanted and having it be the best thing anyone had tasted. The Hungry Lion hosted many noted sports figures, politicians and a few band's that went on to have successful careers in the music industry. The employee Christmas parties were infamous along with their New Year's Eve festivities. In 1984 he sold The Hungry Lion, for the retirement life, moving his family to Inverness, FL. He decided retirement wasn't all it was cracked up to be and in 1986, he built his second empire known as The Gathering, A Restaurant. He successfully owned and operated The Gathering for 28 years, with his late wife Diane. Larry became known for his cooking while Diane became known for her bubbly personality and shutting him down when he got too loud. On a good night you could hear the arguments between himself and his Chef, Charlie. The same could be said of The Hungry Lion. You're laughing or smiling right now, if you were there. In 2007 Larry became a devoted caregiver to Diane who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. He dedicated himself to her for the next 12 years until her death in 2019. To say he had a fiery personality or was a hot head is an understatement. One could also say he would do anything for anyone and would give you the shirt off his back which he did from his early years until his death. He loved singing and didn't care where he was, especially after some wine. He would serenade anyone and if they got up to leave, he'd follow them until he finished. He was the king of cheesy one-liners like, \"I'm really good to my wife. I don't come home often\" or \"This tastes like cake, donut?\" Larry was an avid golfer in his retirement years and continued cooking for anyone who would eat. Larry was preceded in death by his wife of 60 years, Diane Colford and is survived by his three children, Celeste (Andy) Bolduc of Dexter Me, Lance Colford of Orlando Fl and Elisha (Heather) Colford of Inverness, FL.

In 1970 they moved to Fort Lauderdale, FL, and moved around and traveled a lot with Joe’s work; but eventually retired in Inverness, FL (Citrus County) where they have lived since 2001. Her most important role in life was mother to two children, Daniel (Cowboy) and her Angel Tami. Lynn measured success by being a loyal and trusting life partner to Joe and raising two happy children. With that, her dreams came true and she lived a full life. She stayed home and cared for her children when they were young, but eventually went to work at Motorola in the mid 1970’s.

For her many friends she will always be remembered as someone who had a caring heart and was always there for you. To have Lynn as a friend was to have someone that you could 100% count on, no question. But what stands out beyond that is a sense of humor that will keep smiles on our faces for years to come. Lynn loved to light up a room with laughter. Lynn was a fighter, and an inspiration, as she battled numerous health issues throughout her life. At the young age of 34 she beat breast cancer. She was badly hurt years later in a serious motorcycle accident and faced a long recovery both physically and medically. These among other health issues through the years never dampened her sense of humor and her desire to put others first. Her favorite hobby was arts and crafts, of many kinds.

She was 65. Susan was the eldest child of Adeline and Bill Harrison, born on January 28, 1959 — a birthday she shared with two of her three siblings. A fifth generation Floridian, she grew up in Sarasota, where she delighted in going on boat rides through the bay with her family. The Harrisons also made frequent trips to the family ranch in Parrish and to Gainesville to cheer on the Florida Gators. A lifelong fan, she followed all Gator sports and took any losses to heart. Susan was a devout Christian. She was raised at First Baptist Church of Sarasota and made her profession of faith when she was 8 years old. Her entire life, she was active in church ministries, most recently as a deacon and member of the prayer committee at First Presbyterian Church of Inverness. One of her projects with the church involved collecting suitcases for foster children. Music was a defining part of Susan’s life. At age six, she began piano lessons. She honed her skills over the next six decades. Following the recitals of her youth, she played for countless church services, community concerts, weddings and funerals in Citrus County, where she lived for 36 years. Additionally, she played the organ and handbells, and had a beautiful voice. When she was not accompanying her church’s choir on the piano, she was likely singing in it. Susan was among the first students at Pine View, Sarasota’s public school for gifted children. She graduated second in her class at age 17 in 1976. She then studied at Sophie Newcomb College, part of Tulane University, in New Orleans, where she majored in music and sociology, graduating summa cum laude in 1980 and as a member of Phi Beta Kappa honor society. A year earlier, on March 9, Susan’s life took a serendipitous turn. She had planned a weekend trip to Sarasota to attend a Vladimir Horowitz concert. When the renowned pianist canceled his performance, Susan’s mother suggested she remain at school. To cheer her up, Susan’s Phi Mu sorority sisters dragged her to a party, where she met a medical student, Tom Hendrick, who would be graduating and starting his residency in Ohio only a few months later. Susan and Tom dated weekly for the remaining eight weeks of Susan’s semester, then continued their relationship long distance before marrying on June 14, 1980. While Tom worked as a surgical resident with the United States Air Force at Wright State University, Susan attended the University of Dayton School of Law. She graduated third in her class, was the editor of Law Review, and later received the highest score of anyone taking the Florida Bar exam in 1983. Despite her acumen, Susan never practiced law. She had her daughter, Katie, in 1984, followed by her son, Charlie, in 1987. She devoted herself to their upbringing. Though she loathed driving, she spent countless hours chauffeuring her children across central Florida to gymnastics, golf and tennis practices and competitions. She chaperoned field trips, helped with homework, prepared meal after meal and counseled her children through the travails of growing up. The family also enjoyed frequent trips to Disney World, as well as annual vacations over the children’s spring and summer breaks from school. As empty nesters, Susan and Tom embraced traveling, visiting more than 70 countries and all seven continents. It was on a month-long cruise to New Zealand and Australia this winter that her illness became apparent. Susan’s greatest joy was spending time with her family and her dogs, which, over the years, included several English setters, poodles, yorkies, a Lhasa Apso and two Biewer terriers. In 2019, she became a grandmother, a role in which she thrived. She relished visits and FaceTime calls with her grandchildren and showered them with thoughtful gifts. She leaves behind Tom Hendrick, her husband of nearly 44 years; one sister, Nancy Taylor (Dobie); two brothers, Bill (Cathi) and Robert (Nancy) Harrison; her children, Katie Vincent (Bill) and Charlie Hendrick (Mia); four grandchildren, James and Andy Vincent and Ellery and Tanner Hendrick; and three dogs, Duke, Bailey and Tinsley.

Born in Ferrisburgh, VT, the 12th child of Ray Elson Husk and Caroline E Black My dear wife, we have been blessed with time for remembrance; an opportunity to share with each other the joys, concerns, happenings and feelings we have known, and to rekindle our appreciation for those things we have experienced. We have worked hard to make several houses into homes, kneeled in the dirt together to plant food for our family, supported each other through times of sickness and financial difficulty, and celebrated victories when we fought for what was needed in our children’s lives. We’ve spent the night at the bedside of a sick child and gave God the praise when the fever broke. We’ve built fences, moved buildings, boiled syrup, harvested crops, helped neighbors, served our local church, and, most importantly, shared these experiences with our four kids as they grew in knowledge and understanding, and ultimately sent them into the world, with our prayers and encouragement, to live their lives as the Lord leads them. We’ve rejoiced as our children found mates of the Lord’s choosing and were blessed with children of their own! What a joy to see our love for each other multiplied, as a little bit of us continues on in each of them. On and on it goes as our grandchildren are now adding our great-grandchildren to the cause for good in this world, and they are such a blessing, every one! Thankfulness is the best word I can gather, as I think of our life together, and I want to end with the poem I wrote for you a couple decades ago. I offer it here as it still says, what I want to say, in the best way I know how. “The blessings that the Lord provides at times are left unseen, as we go about our private lives just chasing our own dreams. Then the Lord sends us someone who cares, He guides them from above. For there’s a reflection of Jesus Christ there in the hearts of those we love. Lives when lived together oft-times contain some strife, but it’s the trials and the testing that bring a depth of love to life. Oh, I know that our togetherness is sanctioned from above. For I know that Jesus made you, and that He made you just for me to love. So, as we walk in Jesus’ love, know what our role can be. Let us share His joy with those around that all might soon be free. May others see His love in us, that love we’ve come to know, that the blessings, all the blessings to other’s lives from Christ may flow. And I thank the Lord for all the blessings, all the blessings that He’s given. I thank the Lord for all the blessings and for the Son, the One who’s risen. And I thank the Lord for all the blessings and for the joy of being free. But, most of all I thank Him for the blessing, for the blessing that you are to me!” All my love forever, Jim\n\nLisa A Reese, 68, Inverness, FL\n\nLisa A.
