Stout, affectionately known as Barb to her loved ones, passed away peacefully on July 23, 2024, in Salem Regional Medical Center after a short illness. Barb was born on April 14, 1941, in Salem, the daughter of the late Frederick and Devota (Hawn) Knutti. Barb's life was a testament to her enduring kindness and her unwavering commitment to those she loved. She was married to her husband, Henry C. Stout, on January 28, 1964. Their partnership continued until Henry's passing in 2021. Together, they raised three daughters: Terri Stout of Salem, Susan Harry and her husband James of Fairbanks, Alaska, and Brenda Gray and her husband Nicholas of Colorado Springs, Colorado. Barb's role as a mother was one she cherished deeply, and her guidance and wisdom continue to live on through her children. Her family circle extended to include her brother, William Knutti of Austintown, and her four grandchildren, Emma, Wade, Autumn, and Amber. Barb's presence was a source of joy and comfort in their lives, and she took great pride in each of their accomplishments and unique paths. A graduate of Western Reserve High School, class of 1959, Barb first became a cosmetologist and later furthered her education by earning an associate degree in nursing from the Hannah Mullens School of Practical Nursing in 1986. Her passion for caring for others led her to a career first with Canterbury Villa and then at the Auburn Care Center, where she was a valued member of the nursing staff until her retirement in 2013. Her colleagues and patients alike will remember her for her compassionate nature and her dedication to providing comfort and care to those in need. Outside of her professional life, Barb had a variety of interests that brought her joy including daytime dramas, gardening and cooking. Barb also had a soft spot for animals, especially her dogs, who were her constant companions. They were a source of comfort and happiness for her, and she took great pleasure in caring for them throughout her life. As Barb's family and friends reflect on her life, they will find comfort in the memories of the time spent with her, the lessons she taught, and the love she freely gave. Barb's journey may have come to a peaceful close in the same town where it began, but the echoes of her life's song will resonate for generations to come. Friends and family will be received from 5:00-6:00 p.m., Friday, August 2, 2024, at Stark Memorial Funeral Home. A funeral service will follow at 6:00 p.m. at the funeral home, with Pastor Peter Fowler officiating.

Wagner, 69, passed away on Monday, July 29, after a courageous battle with melanoma. Born to Clarence and Vesta Wagner in 1954, he was the youngest of eight siblings. Graduating from Louisville High School in 1973, he spent the next 12 years working at Diebold in Canton, earning his real estate license, and entering the real estate business. During that time, he was drawn more and more to the auctioneering business. He entered the three-year Missouri Auction School program and graduated from the CAI Certified Auctioneer Institute through Indiana University. He was a member of both the Ohio and National Auctioneers Associations for more than 40 years. He served as director of the NE Ohio Auctioneers Association for four years, and as chairman of the Ohio Auctioneers Assoc. in Columbus during its winter convention for several years. For 40 years, he was Cutler Real Estates Auctioneer, selling real estate and chattels, and was very proud of his indispensable Auction Team, which included many family members. The buyers and sellers always knew they could count on us to be accurate and true, he once said. He was very proud to have Dave Gill as a partner auctioneer and close friend for many years. In 1978, he fell in love with his one and only, Michelle (Casper). They married in 1980 and had two children. Throughout his life, he was engaged in the farming business, which gave him much joy and satisfaction. Accompanied by horses, dogs, and chickens, the family enjoyed the country life. He also loved target shooting, tractor pulls, and the latest innovations in agriculture and farm equipment. Above all, he treasured and prioritized his family who survives him: wife, Michelle; son Adam (Amy) Wagner; and daughter Lindsey (Sean) Noland, along with their children Joseph and Kenley. He is also survived by a brother, Sonny Wagner of Canton, and three sisters, Vivian Johnk of Texas, Bette Talkington of Texas, and Marjorie (Jerry) Peterson of Alliance.
