        "text": "Sydney History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nThe name Sydney was brought to England in the wave of migration that followed the Norman Conquest of 1066. The Sydney family lived in St Denis, Normandy. 1 One noted author agrees with this generally accepted premise, but he points out that \"proof is lacking. The only evidence noted is: Roger de Sancto Dionisio 1212 Fees for Norfolk.\" He feels that the name more likely originated at Sidney Farm, in Alfold, Surrey and meant \"dweller by the wide well-watered land.\" 2\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Sydney family\n\nThe surname Sydney was first found in Kent where they settled in Lewes Priory in 1188, coming from Anjou in Normandy. The founder of this family in England was Sir William Sydney, Chamberlain of King Henry II., who came from Anjou with that monarch, and was buried at Lewes Priory, East Sussex in 1188. 3 In Surrey, we also found John ate Sydenye in the Subsidy Rolls for 1332 and in Sussex, William Sydny was recorded in 1428. 2\n\nThe Hundredorum Rolls of 1273 included: Richard de Sanct' Deonise, Norfolk; and Robert de Sanct' Deonisio, Devon. 4\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Sydney family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Sydney research. Another 117 words (8 lines of text) covering the years 1515, 1529, 1534, 1554, 1563, 1580, 1586, 1595, 1598, 1619, 1623, 1626, 1641, 1649, 1659, 1676, 1677, 1680, 1681, 1682, 1683, 1698, 1702, 1704, 1705, 1729, 1737 and 1743 are included under the topic Early Sydney History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nSydney Spelling Variations\n\nSpelling variations in names were a common occurrence in the eras before English spelling was standardized a few hundred years ago. In the Middle Ages, even the literate regularly changed the spellings of their names as the English language incorporated elements of French, Latin, and other European languages. Many variations of the name Sydney have been found, including Sidney, Sydney and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Sydney family\n\nOutstanding amongst the family at this time was\n\nAlgernon Sidney (Sydney) (1623-1683), an English politician, opponent of King Charles II of England, charged with plotting against the King and was executed for treason\n\nHenry Sydney (or Sidney), 1st Earl of Romney (1641-1704)\n\nLoading...\n\nSydney migration to the United States +\n\nFor many English families, the social climate in England was oppressive and lacked opportunity for change. For such families, the shores of Ireland, Australia, and the New World beckoned. They left their homeland at great expense in ships that were overcrowded and full of disease. Many arrived after the long voyage sick, starving, and without a penny. But even those were greeted with greater opportunity than they could have experienced back home. Numerous English settlers who arrived in the United States and Canada at this time went on to make important contributions to the developing cultures of those countries. Many of those families went on to make significant contributions to the rapidly developing colonies in which they settled. Early North American records indicate many people bearing the name Sydney were among those contributors:\n\nSydney Settlers in United States in the 19th Century\n\nGeo Sydney, who arrived in Arkansas in 1888 5\n\nSydney migration to Australia +\n\nEmigration to Australia followed the First Fleets of convicts, tradespeople and early settlers. Early immigrants include:\n\nSydney Settlers in Australia in the 19th Century\n\nLee Sydney, aged 26, a farm labourer, who arrived in South Australia in 1850 aboard the ship \"Stag\" 6\n\nMr. George Sydney, British Convict who was convicted in Stafford, Staffordshire, England for 7 years, transported aboard the \"Corona\" on 13th October 1866, arriving in Western Australia, Australia 7\n\nSydney migration to New Zealand +\n\nEmigration to New Zealand followed in the footsteps of the European explorers, such as Captain Cook (1769-70): first came sealers, whalers, missionaries, and traders. By 1838, the British New Zealand Company had begun buying land from the Maori tribes, and selling it to settlers, and, after the Treaty of Waitangi in 1840, many British families set out on the arduous six month journey from Britain to Aotearoa to start a new life. Early immigrants include:\n\nSydney Settlers in New Zealand in the 20th Century\n\nPhyllis Sydney, aged 18, who arrived in Auckland, New Zealand aboard the ship \"S. S. Waimana\" in 1926\n\nLouie Sydney, aged 15, who arrived in Auckland, New Zealand aboard the ship \"S. S. Waimana\" in 1926\n\nJohn Sydney, aged 13, who arrived in Auckland, New Zealand aboard the ship \"S. S. Waimana\" in 1926\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Sydney (post 1700) +\n\nSylvia Sydney, Actress and film star\n\nJohn Sydney Millar CBE (1934-2023), Northern Irish rugby union prop who played for Ballymena RFC and international rugby for Ireland and the British Lions\n\nMajor-General John Sydney Lethbridge CB, CBE, MC (b. 1897), British soldier in the Second World War with British Expeditionary Force in France in 1939, Commander Royal Engineers for the 59th (Staffordshire) Infantry Division\n\nEdwin Sydney Stuart (1853-1937), American politician, Governor of Pennsylvania from 1907-1911\n\nAlan Sydney Minter (1951-2020), British professional boxer who held the undisputed middleweight title in 1980\n\nMr. Robert Sydney Barnes B.E.M., British Trainer and Parent Consultant for Adoption UK, was appointed the British Empire Medal on 8th June 2018, for services to Adoption 8\n\nAlfred Sydney Wigan (1814-1878), English actor-manager who took part in the first Royal Command Performance before Queen Victoria on 28 December 1848 9\n\nMr Sydney Tavender, British chairman of the Cotswold branch of the Far East Prisoners of War during World War II\n\nJohn Sydney Buller MBE (1909-1970), English first-class cricketer\n\nSir Arthur Sydney Hutchinson KBE CB CVO (1896-1981), British soldier and civil servant\n\nRelated Stories +\n\nThe Sydney Motto +\n\nThe motto was originally a war cry or slogan. Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Quo fata vocant\n\nMotto Translation: Wherever fate may summon me.\n\nCitations +\n\nSmith, Eldson Coles, New Dictionary of American Family Names New York: Harper & Row, 1956.
