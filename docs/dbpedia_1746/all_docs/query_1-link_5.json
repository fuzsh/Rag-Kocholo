        "text": "This is an ongoing project to provide information about the individuals who have served as Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Treasury Department has served the Commonwealth since the 1700s. Many recognize Samuel Carpenter (1649-1714), a friend and partner of William Penn who also served as a Deputy Governor of colonial Pennsylvania, as the first treasurer of Pennsylvania (serving from 1704 to 1710, as well as 1711 to 1713).\n\nPennsylvaniaâs State Treasurer has not always been an independently elected office. The stateâs original 1776 Constitution authorized the state House of Representatives to âchoose â¦ the treasurer of the state.â\n\nThe 1790 Constitution required that âThe State Treasurer shall be appointed, annually, by the joint vote of the members of both Houses,â meaning the House of Representatives and the Senate â which did not exist prior to the 1790 Constitution. Pennsylvaniaâs 1838 Constitution continued that practice: âA State Treasurer shall be elected annually, by joint vote of both branches of the legislature.â\n\nHowever, in 1872, the state constitution was amended to give the voters the ability to choose their Treasurer: âA state treasurer shall be chosen by the qualified electors of the state, at such times appointed and for such term of service as shall be prescribed by law.â Subsequently, the 1874 Constitution set the term of the State Treasurer at two years and prohibited officeholders from âholding the same office for two consecutive terms.â\n\nThe most recent change to the office of State Treasurer is found in the 1968 Constitution, which includes the following provision (Article IV, Section 18): âThe terms of the Auditor General and of the State Treasurer shall each be four years from the third Tuesday of January next ensuing his election. They shall be chosen by the qualified electors of the Commonwealth at general elections but shall not be eligible to serve continuously for more than two successive terms. The State Treasurer shall not be eligible to the office of Auditor General until four years after he has been State Treasurer.â\n\nSamuel Butler\n\nEarly Life & Childhood\n\nOne of five children born to a deep-rooted, Chester County Quaker farming family that were the original settlers of the area, Butler was born in Uwchlan Township on February 2, 1825, to James Butler (1767-1837) and Mary Phipps (1783-1866).\n\nHe was raised on the Uwchlan Township family farm that his ancestors had lived on for years, and starting in 1841 he attended local Unionville Academy after some experience in public schooling. Unionville Academy was a new school that was known at the time for its wide subject matter of algebra, history, grammar, surveying, and foreign languages, and other then Butler, its notable alumni included German minister Bayard Taylor.\n\nEducation and political ambition also ran in the family, as Butlerâs older brother William later became a U.S. Circuit Court Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, his son Thomas became a U.S. Congressman, and his grandson General Smedley Darlington Butler (1881-1940) is one of only 20 men in the entire history of the United States to have ever received the Medal of Honor not once, but twice.\n\nFamily & Early Career/Political Involvement\n\nAfter his schooling in the local public school system, and later graduating from Unionville Academy, Butler was hired there as a teacher and taught for about eight years, afterwards moving to Butler County, Ohio, for a short while. He returned to Uwchlan Township in 1850 and married fellow Chester County native and Quaker Margaretta Paschall Woodward (1831-1901) sometime around 1850. They had three children, Anna (1851-1940), Henry (1852-1931), and Thomas (1855-1928), the latter later becoming a congressman.\n\nUpon his return and marriage, Butler returned to farming on his ancestral home in Uwchlan Township. He carried on with this for a number of years, including throughout his time in the Pennsylvania political arena. He served in the Civil War during this time, and continued to be a visible member of the community as a result of his ancestral ties and business dealings. He was once described by the Bedford County Press and Everett Press as being âheld in high esteem by all the residents of Chester Countyâ¦a very pleasant, courteous gentleman, strictly honest and honorable in all dealings.â\n\nWell-established in the 1860s as a Chester County farmer, Butler then took to political pursuits and involvement in local and statewide politics as a member of the Republican Party. The Bedford County Press and Everett Press describes his career as being, for two consecutive terms, Director of the poor of Chester County. He was also Director of The National Bank of Downingtown, was annually re-elected to the post of Director of the Farmerâs National Bank of West Chester, and since its organization was a Director of the Chester County Guarantee, Trust and Safe Deposit Company. In his community, Butler also started a âdebating schoolâ for local individuals to voice their concerns to others about governmental going-ons.\n\nAs a result of his rising political profile, in 1870, he was nominated for State Treasurer by the Republican Party of Pennsylvania and lost. After his loss in 1870 for the role of State Treasurer, Butler ran for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, and won. He served in the 1877, 1878 and 1879 House Sessions â giving up his seat to once again run for Treasurer.\n\nCampaign & Role as Treasurer\n\nIn 1879, Butler launched another campaign for State Treasurer after being nominated. As reported during the Pennsylvania Republican Party Convention, in the Harrisburg Telegraph in July 1879, the party chair, in his remarks, said that âhe had been requested by the citizens and Republicans of the county of Chester to place in nomination before you one of their citizensâ¦ I name to you, gentleman, Hon. Samuel Butler of Chester County.â He was consistently praised for his honesty, reputation, and fidelity.\n\nCompletely unopposed, Butler accepted the nomination and waltzed to victory in November by receiving the largest majority vote that any Republican had marked in Pennsylvania since the Civil War. However, he still had critics â an August 13, 1879, letter in the Selinsgrove Times-Tribune from a âPatriotâ brands Butler an âan arrant fraud,â and The Allentown Democrat in October 1880 remarked that they could not understand âhow the âringâ came to select him as Treasurer.â\n\nAfter being elected as State Treasurer, but before taking office, Butler discovered a $300,000 deficiency (about $8.7 million in 2022 dollars) in state funds from his predecessor. It âalarmed him terribly,â and he was reported to be completely taken aback as to how the discovery should be addressed. He met with his predecessor still in office, who newspapers say broke down in tears to Butler. âNever deviating from the path of duty,â Butler secured legal counsel and worked to ensure Treasuryâs funds were all accounted for and repatriated. It was described as a âtrying experience for poor Butler.â\n\nButler served as Treasurer from 1880 to 1882, and in 1881 was reported in the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader as a suggested Republican candidate for Governor. The newspaper referred to him as âone of the men who cannot be moved from the path he believes to be right.â\n\nFailed Gubernatorial Campaign & Later Years\n\nAttempting a jump from the Treasury to the governorship, Butler appeared to have overwhelming support for the Republican nomination in 1882. Newspapers were flooded with reports of his impending success at the convention, but for whatever reason â not made clear in newspaper reports, the entire planned ticket was nominated with the exception of Butler. He was beat out for Governor and as a consolation was put in the ring for a seat in Congress â where he placed second. Whatever political forces wanted Butler to fail were successful, and Butlerâs statewide political career came to an unceremonious halt at the May 1882 state Republican Party convention.\n\nButler continued to live in Uwchlan Township after his time as Treasurer and failed run for Governor. Despite leaving the political arena with a loss under his belt, he was still well-respected in Republican circles and across the state, with many newspapers still referring to him as âHonest Sam Butler.â\n\nHe continued his agricultural pursuits and died at the age of 65 of a âlong and severe illnessâ on February 1, 1891, in Chester County. He is buried with his wife at Oaklands Cemetery in West Goshen Township, Chester County.\n\nSilas Bailey (Baily)\n\nEarly Life & Childhood\n\nSilas Milton Bailey, sometimes spelled Baily, was born on January 4, 1836, in Brownsville, Fayette County, Pennsylvania to William H. Bailey (Baily) and Dorcas Nixon. He was the eldest child out of six that lived to adulthood, and his mother died when he was just ten years old.\n\nHis family originally had roots in Maryland, before deciding to settle for good in Fayette County, Pennsylvania. His father was a jeweler, who then turned his attention to law. He was admitted to the bar in 1845, with his wife, Dorcas Nixon, being described in History of Fayette County as a âfarmerâs daughter.â\n\nSilasâs family moved throughout Fayette County during his childhood, and they lived in Uniontown as of 1850, according to that yearâs census. He attended the âcommon schoolsâ in Fayette County, then entered Madison College for additional education before withdrawing and following in the footsteps of his father by taking up the jewelry business. After apprenticing for three years, he opened his own business in Greensville in 1858.\n\nCivil War Service\n\nAt the age of 25, in May of 1861, Bailey put his jewelry business on pause and enlisted in the Civil War. Without any military experience, he gathered together the first large group of soldiers from Greene County, titling themselves the âGreene County Rangersâ from Company I of the Pennsylvania Reserveâs Eighth Regiment. Bailey was elected Major of the entire Eighth Regiment, and together they took part in some of the Seven Days Battles.\n\nSeriously wounded at one of those battles, The Battle of Gaines Mill, he recovered after four months and rejoined the Rangers in September of 1862. His horse was shot out from under him during the Battle of Antietam, and Bailey was wounded once again at the Battle of Fredericksburg. After that, he was promoted to Colonel and had various other leadership duties. When the war wound down, he was breveted by President Andrew Johnson in May of 1865 and was named a Brigadier General.\n\nPost-War & Early Political Service\n\nReturning to Uniontown widely considered a military hero, Bailey resumed his work as a jeweler and silversmith. A staunch Republican â but one who was reported as not being active in seeking leadership â he was nominated without âsolicitation by himself or his friendsâ in 1878 to run for Congress. It was described as a hopeless campaign that he still made an effort to win. And despite his eventual loss, Bailey led the Republican ticket by a considerable margin. In 1880, he was elected to be a Grant-supporting delegate at the Republican Convention, and on September 8, 1881, he was nominated at the Pennsylvania Republican Convention to be the nominee for State Treasurer by a vote of 157-84, defeating Sen. William Bradford of Bradford County.\n\nIn nominating Bailey for this position, Pennsylvania Attorney General Henry Palmer described him as âa man in the prime of life â¦ a man who attested his love of liberty.â After a spirited campaign, Bailey won a plurality due to a Republican-Independent being in the race â he defeated the Democratic candidate by almost 7,000 votes. Upon taking office, the Harrisburg Daily Independent described the previous Treasurer, Samuel Butler, as leaving Bailey âa clean balance sheet and a clear course.â His Democratic opponent, Robert E. Pattison, became governor in 1883.\n\nTime as Treasurer & Other Political Aspirations\n\nBailey served as Treasurer from 1882 to 1884. He fought with shuttered banks to get state funds returned, and filed lawsuits to claw back taxpayer dollars. His initial 1883 report on Pennsylvaniaâs economic health was âa very satisfactory paper,â according to the Chambersburg Public Weekly Opinion, and he was described as someone who was moving Pennsylvania âin the direction of real reform.â\n\nHowever, at the conclusion of his term in 1884 and in the following years, he was attacked repeatedly by his successor in the press and was even sued by the Commonwealth for not clawing back enough taxpayer dollars from shuttered banks. They thought he should be held personally liable for this financial loss; however, Bailey did not let the slight stop his further political aspirations. In summing up his time as Treasurer, Indiana Progress said of Bailey âhe went out of office a poor man.â\n\nIn 1890, Bailey made an unsuccessful bid to be Sergeant-at-Arms of the United States Senate. He lost despite the support of Senator Matthew Quay, also chair of the Republican National Committee at that time. Bailey then turned his sights to be the Pension Agent at Pittsburgh, once again with Senator Quayâs support. However, it appears that he did not obtain that position, either. Continuing with his profession as a jeweler and silversmith, Bailey sold his business and retired early in 1900, shortly before his death.\n\nLater Years & Death\n\nNever married, and never having children, âGen. Bailey,â as he was frequently referred to, died on May 5, 1900, in Uniontown. His death was reportedly caused by complications from one of the bullet wounds he obtained from his service in the Civil War. He had been âsick for some timeâ according to the Monongahela Valley Republican and was buried in Oak Grove Cemetery, located in South Union Township.\n\nWilliam Livsey\n\nEarly Activities & Beginnings of A Political Career\n\nWilliam Livsey was born around November 13, 1828, in England. His immediate background, as well as when he came to the United States, is unclear, however it is known that he was a veteran of the Crimean War and was present during the siege of Sebastopol, serving in the Commissary Department of the English Army.\n\nAfter immigrating to this country likely in the 1850s, he settled in Pittsburgh and entered civil service as a Treasury Clerk there. While serving, he traveled west at the start of The Civil War and enlisted in a Union Illinois regiment. He survived the war, returned to Pittsburgh, and resumed his career in the financial sector as a bookkeeper for the Pittsburgh-based firm Littell & Meckling. During this time, he also married a woman by the name of Mary Ann.\n\nAfter time had passed at Littell & Meckling, Livsey moved back to civil service as Clerk under Treasurer Magee, and Chief Clerk in Pittsburgh. When Samuel Butler was elected State Treasurer, he appointed Livsey as Cashier of the Pennsylvania Treasury. He held this position until Butlerâs term expired, and despite urges by incoming Treasurer Silas Bailey to stay on, decided to instead be installed as Chief Clerk in the Controllerâs Office.\n\nWhen the Controller died in office, Livsey took his place permanently. The Telegraph described him as âof a retiring disposition, but is a genial gentleman and makes friends with all whom he becomes acquainted.â\n\nBeginning to Run for Office\n\nWhile running for his first elected term as Treasurer in 1883, as a Republican, Livsey was described by The Sentinel as someone with a âthorough knowledge of financial affairs, having been thoroughly trained in the banking business â¦ during the term of Treasurer Butler he was Chief Clerk of the State Treasury and was reappointed to that responsible position by Treasurer Bailey.â\n\nLivsey did not have an easy waltz to the Republican nomination for Treasurer in 1883. He initially placed a distant second on the crowded ballot before eventually claiming victory on the sixth tally. He was also facing discrimination, with the Harrisburg Telegraph detailing reports describing Livsey as a âBritish subject â¦ [a] sympathizer with the oppressors of Ireland.â\n\nHe won the general election despite this pushback, with The Tribune declaring on November 8, 1883 that, âIn Pennsylvania, The Republicans have elected William Livsey, of Allegheny, for State Treasurer.â\n\nTerms as Treasurer & Campaigns\n\nLivseyâs first term as Treasurer of Pennsylvania lasted from 1884 to 1886. As far as the daily running of the office went, he made general published reports about the condition of the Pennsylvania Treasury, as like appeared in the Harrisburg Telegraph on August 1, 1885. He did not serve without critics, however. A few months prior, on July 14, 1885, it was reported in the Lancaster New Era that âthe present incumbent, William Livsey, has I am told, lost $10,000â¦(he) will leave office at the end of the horn.â\n\nMore than six months before his first term ended in May of 1886, it was reported in November 1885 that Livseyâs ally, political boss and U.S. Senator Matthew Quay, would be retaining him as Cashier of the Treasury afterwards. This came true, as on May 3, 1886, it was reported by the Harrisburg Telegraph that with the expiration of Livseyâs term, âhis connection with the office would not cease.â Not all Pennsylvanians held Livsey in high regard, though; he was referred to as a âcreatureâ in the York Democratic Press on May 7, 1886.\n\nWhile serving as Cashier through 1887, his ally, Treasurer (later Senator) Quay resigned. Livsey then once again held the role as Treasurer for the term of 1887 to 1888, as reported in the Sunbury American. âThe resignation was accepted and Ex-State Treasurer William Livsey, the cashier under Col. Quay, was immediately appointed to the vacancy.â\n\nUpon leaving office for this second term, incoming Treasurer Capt. William Hart found the state accounts to be âcorrect to a cent, and the balance sheet cleanâ as was written in the Reading Times on May 8, 1888. He also became an aide with the rank of Lt. Colonel, on the staff of Pennsylvania Governor James Beaver.\n\nOn November 13, 1889, Livsey was appointed to one final term as Treasurer by Governor James Beaver, to fill the term of the late Capt. Hart who had died in office. This would be Livseyâs third term as Treasurer, elected to the position only once, and appointed twice. A little more than a week later after his appointment, a sweeping grand jury indictment was brought against allies of Senator Matthew Quay, including Livsey.\n\nThe grand jury was investigating Livsey, along with at least four former state treasurers â Quay, Hart, Henry Boyer and Benjamin Haywood â and others for improper use of state funds. This continued for much of his last appointed term, and in July 1891, while news continued to be spread constantly about his possible misuse of funds and corruption allegations against him and other Treasury officials in Pennsylvania, Livsey completely disappeared.\n\nLater Life & Death\n\nLivseyâs later life, much like his early life, is mostly a mystery. After fleeing Harrisburg and possibly Pennsylvania to avoid professional ridicule and potential legal issues in July 1891, he disappeared from public life for many years.\n\nIt is known that he stayed around Pittsburgh, and moved from there to the Detroit Metropolitan area around 1900, to be closer to his only son. He died five years later around the age of 76 on April 16, 1905, in Michigan, and is buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Watertown, Jefferson County, Michigan. He left behind several adult children. His wife, Mary Ann, had passed just shy of a year prior.\n\nMatthew Quay\n\nEarly Life\n\nMatthew Stanley Quay, a boss of Pennsylvania political machinery in the mid-to-late 19th century, was born in Dillsburg, York County, Pennsylvania, on September 30, 1833, to the Rev. Anderson Quay and his wife, Catherine McCain.\n\nIn his early years, he attended academies in Beaver and Indiana counties before heading off to Jefferson College, now Washington & Jefferson College. He was a member of Beta Theta Pi and graduated in 1850 to begin reading law.\n\nPolitical Beginnings, Personal Life, & Military Service\n\nWhile beginning his career as a lawyer in Beaver County, Quay began to be drawn towards political pursuits. He ran for and was elected to the position of Beaver County Prothonotary, which he held from 1855 to 1861. When the Civil War broke out, Quay served as a First Lieutenant and Colonel with the 134th Pennsylvania Volunteer division. His service to these roles caught the attention of Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin, who tapped him to serve as his own personal private military secretary.\n\nQuay often answered the mail of soldiers and their families who would write to Governor Curtin. The Governor, seeing Quay operating in this role, later appointed him to the position of Assistant Commissary General of Pennsylvania and Military Secretary of Pennsylvania from 1863 to 1865. Quay saw active duty despite his service with the Governor, and was awarded a Medal of Honor in 1888 for his actions during The Battle of Fredericksburg.\n\nA Republican, he was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for the 1865, 1866, and 1867 terms, declining reelection in 1868. He was publisher and editor of Beaver Radical from 1868 to 1873, and was elected as a Delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1872, 1876, 1880, 1892, 1896, and 1900. He was Chair of the Republican State Committee from 1878 to 1879 and again from 1895 to 1896, and he was appointed Secretary of the Commonwealth from 1872 to 1878 and from 1879 to 1882.\n\nIn 1855, Quay married Agnes Barclay and the couple had numerous children. Only five lived to adulthood.\n\nCampaign For & Time as Treasurer of Pennsylvania\n\nQuay, fully in control of the political machinery, campaigned to become Treasurer of Pennsylvania in 1885 for the 1886 to 1887 term. It was a controversial campaign, with many newspapers publishing stories and letters to the editor regarding their opposition to him.\n\nHe also faced a âwealth of religious oppositionâ according to the Lancaster Intelligencer, and the Wilkes-Barre Union Leader wrote that âWith Matt Quay â¦ managing the state funds there would be no end to the possibilities of speculation. Newspapers outside the state wrote highly of him, with the New York Tribune calling his acceptance of the nomination ânot a machinic one.â In reply, the Chambersburg Valley Spirit wrote that Quay must have had to âkeep from laughing aloudâ upon reading it. The Philadelphia Times published an excerpt from a Philadelphia-area party speech in which the local party boss said âMatthew Quay is the most unfit, desperate, reckless and dangerous man in all our Commonwealth and not a respectable banker or businessman.â\n\nHowever, most knew that Quay would have an easy waltz to the Republican nomination and victory in general election. The opening line in the Philadelphia Times article reporting his acceptance of the Republican nomination was, âThe buzz-saw cut clear through today.â\n\nAs expected, Quay won the general election for Treasurer of Pennsylvania and served from 1886 to 1887. His name was in the papers nonstop, with allegations of corruption, mismanagement, planned runs for higher office, and more. His attention to the Treasury during his term was questioned, and he immediately ran for and won election as a United States Senator. He resigned as Treasurer on August 24, 1887.\n\nLater Political Pursuits\n\nQuay was additionally appointed Philadelphia Recorder in 1879, a position created for him by the Legislature, although as a political move he shortly ditched the position. He served as Chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1888 to 1891, and he was frequently quoted as saying that his work as RNC Chair was personally responsible for the election of Benjamin Harrison as President. Harrison said that âProvidenceâ attributed to his victory, but Quay replied that âProvidence hadnât a thing to do with it.â Harrison went on to tell people that Matthew Stanley Quay of Beaver County, Pennsylvania, was a presidential kingmaker.\n\nThe capstone of his political career was serving as a United States Senator from 1887 to 1899 and from 1901 to 1904. With controversy over the election and his seating as a Senator, Quayâs power over the Pennsylvania political machine waned in later years, although he still claimed responsibility for the selection of Theodore Roosevelt as Vice President for the 1900 U.S. Presidential Election. That controversy, which raged on from 1899 to 1901, revolved around a criminal trial for misappropriating public funds. In the end, he was acquitted and returned to the Senate â however, different political factions blocked his re-seating for almost two years.\n\nDeath\n\nHis legacy as a political boss is mixed. One of the first known political figures bought by Standard Oil, Quay controlled almost all federal construction patronage and ran a political machine that dominated Pennsylvania politics for many years. Through various political chairmanships, appointments, positions, elected offices, agreements, and controversial elections, Quay âwas a central figure in Pennsylvania politics from the 1860s until his death â¦ [H]e was responsible year in and year out for supervising the party organization and patronage system. His role in the U.S. Senate was to supervise political affairs back in Pennsylvania. He paid little attention to legislation except for higher tariffs to benefit his state's manufacturing industries and keep wages high.â\n\nQuay died in office as a U.S. Senator on May 28, 1904, in Beaver County, and is buried at Beaver Cemetery and Mausoleum.\n\nWilliam Hart\n\nEarly Life & Military Service\n\nWilliam Hart was born on March 15, 1842, in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, one of seven children to John Hart and Almira Hallman. His father, a carpenter, was born in Montgomery County, and his mother was born in the county as well. His ancestors, according to the Harrisburg Telegraph, âwere among the first settlers in the state, and were always distinguished for thrift, energy, and culture.â\n\nHart was raised in the Whitemarsh and Upper Merion areas, attending the county common school, and around the age of 14, started working as a farmhand to support himself financially. At 17, he started apprenticing to become a bricklayer, and about two and a half years later, he dropped the trade in order to serve in the Civil War.\n\nAround the age of twenty, he enlisted as a Captain in the 51st Pennsylvania Volunteer Division, Company F. Hart served for three years and fought in numerous battles, being named Assistant Adjutant General of Volunteers on May 1, 1865. Under the command of General John Hartranft, who later served as Governor of Pennsylvania, Hart served until being mustered out in September of 1865 âwith high honors,â according to the Harrisburg Daily Independent.\n\nHe married Salome Beyer on November 15, 1866, at St. Matthewâs Evangelical Lutheran Church in Philadelphia. The couple had three children and lived primarily in Dauphin County.\n\nNext Steps & Beginning of Government Service\n\nWhen his military service had subsided, Hart received a clerkship in the Pennsylvania Treasury in 1867. He served in this capacity until 1871, when he was made Assistant Pennsylvania Treasurer/Cashier of the Pennsylvania Treasury. Upon taking the position, his predecessor remarked of him in the Reading Times by saying âwith his pleasing manner, great qualifications, and strict integrity, he ought to succeed. He must succeed.â\n\nOutside of the Treasury, Hart was involved in local business. As written about in the Perry County Democrat, he âhad been secretary of the Huntingdon Reformatory Commission and secretary and treasurer of the Commonwealth Guarantee Trust and Safe Deposit Companyâ since the organizations were founded.\n\nHart held the role of Assistant Pennsylvania Treasurer/Cashier of the Pennsylvania Treasury for seven years, until he ran for State Treasurer in 1887. He had the âinside trackâ for the Republican nomination, which he received, however he lost the general election to Democrat Amos Noyes. Due to the office changing political hands, his position was terminated, and Hart was out from the Pennsylvania Treasury after over ten years of service.\n\nSecond Run for Treasurer, Time in Office, & Death\n\nYears later, Hart once again ran for state Treasurer. He was nominated by Senator Alexander F. Thompson (R-Dauphin County) at the 1887 State Republican Convention, who praised Hart as possessing âall the requisite qualifications to perform the arduous duties of that position,â according to the Harrisburg Telegraph. âCapt. Hart, in the various positions which he has held, has proved himself an honest, faithful, efficient, and incorruptible public servant â¦ [C]onsistent in his Republicanlism, he has at all times adhered to the principles for which he fought on the field of battle.â\n\nUnopposed, Hart claimed the nomination and moved onto the general election, which he won by 45,000 votes. As Treasurer, he âserved the people of the Commonwealth with carefulness and faithfulness. Conservative in the management of the Treasury, the interests of the people (were) carefully guarded and their finances scrupulously cared for.â He was a ânoble manâ who had âability and intelligence in grasping difficult problems,â as reported in the Harrisburg Daily Independent upon his death.\n\nUnfortunately, he did not complete his full term as Pennsylvania Treasurer. Afflicted with an illness related to the brain, Hart succumbed to his ailment and died in Harrisburg on November 9, 1889. He was buried in Harrisburg Cemetery, leaving a wife and two children.\n\nRemarking upon his tenure, the Harrisburg Daily Independent also wrote in November 1889 that âhis was an administration â¦ of success.â\n\nHenry K. Boyer\n\nEarly Life\n\nHenry Kline Boyer was born on February 19, 1850, in Evansburg, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania. The youngest of two children to blacksmith Ephraim Boyer and his wife Rebecca Kline, Henry was raised mainly in Montgomery County, with his father at one point even being the official town blacksmith of Evansburg. He attended formal schooling in Montgomery County from a young age, with an aptitude for math and a love for English and history. Boyer later attended Freeland Seminary, which is now known as Ursinus College.\n\nHe completed his formal education at only sixteen years of age, and in 1866 became a schoolteacher at the public school in his neighborhood. Kline then moved on to other teaching positions, including ones with a âclassical academyâ in Philadelphia and a Quaker school in the Byberry neighborhood of the city.\n\nIn 1868, he received a grammar school teaching certificate and moved to Camden, New Jersey, to work as the principal of a school there. Boyer did this until 1871, at that time he left his position in Camden to pursue the study of law in Philadelphia at the firm of former United States Attorney General Benjamin H. Brewster. In 1873, at the age of 23, Boyer was admitted to the Bar in Philadelphia County, where he focused on civil cases.\n\nPolitical Career Begins & Flourishes\n\nStarting out as a lawyer, Boyer took up permanent residence in Philadelphia and practiced well through the 1880s, attracting political attention. He was an active member of the Young Republicans of Philadelphia, and âhis growing inclination for public affairs led him in the Spring of 1882 to attend a meeting of Republicans â¦ to (choose) delegates for the state convention.â He was announced then as a delegate for the Seventh Ward of Philadelphia. He received a strong showing but lost. In the fall, he then ran for and won his first race, for the Pennsylvania Statehouse. Winning handily, Boyer had gone from a lawyer to a politician.\n\nHenry K. Boyer served as State Representative for the 7th District of Philadelphia County for six terms, both before and after his time as Treasurer. Boyer served from 1883 to 1890, 1893 to 1894, and 1897 to 1898. He became a powerhouse in the State Legislature, with some of his legislative activities involving being a driving force behind the bill that created the Pennsylvania State Board of Health, encouraging citizens to plant trees, and regulating pharmacies. His action on these matters during his first term did not go without notice, as on January 4, 1887, at the age of 37, Boyer was elected as the unanimous choice of the Pennsylvania House Republican Caucus to be the next Speaker of the House. He was elected Speaker again the next term, and for a third non-consecutive time upon his return to the house in 1896 after serving as Treasurer.\n\nAs Treasurer\n\nThe sitting Speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, Boyer was elected as Treasurer of Pennsylvania in 1889. The State Republican Convention, which less than 10 years before had denied his bid to be only a delegate to it from Philadelphia, unanimously selected him as their pick for Treasurer. Pennsylvania Senator Boies Penrose introduced him at the convention, with the Philadelphia Times quoting Penrose as saying that he knew of âno other manâ for the job.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Boyer said he was a âproud and happy man,â and that the party had âmade a correct choice. â¦ I assure you I will endeavor to merit your confidence.â Boyer was elected in what was the largest total majority ever given to a Republican candidate in a political off-year. When the returns were coming in, the Snyder County Tribune reported that âWell, we have got Boyer and are very happy.â\n\nIn the role of Treasurer, Boyer authored the extensive Revenue Act of 1891, and he saw to it that schools specifically received substantial funding. However, in 1891, Boyer was locked in a corruption scandal along with Auditor General Thomas McCamant. A Philadelphia politico had been discovered that year as being corrupt, so a sweep across the Commonwealth revealed allegations of corruptionâ¦as far as Boyerâs direct role in any corruption, it was written that he was âcriminally negligent at best and corrupt at worst.â\n\nThe scandal ultimately did not lead to his removal from office after the Senate split on talks to oust him, although Dauphin County prosecutors charged him with the misappropriation of $600,000 in funds. Once again, it never got off the ground, and Boyer retired at the end of his term while immediately making another successful bid to the Pennsylvania House and Speakership.\n\nLater Life & Death\n\nBoyer went back to the House after his term as Treasurer, holding the Speakership once more. The Capitol burned down during his tenure, and Boyer led sessions of the Legislature from places like the nearby federal courthouse and Grace United Methodist Church. He resigned from the House on January 17, 1898, after being appointed as Superintendent of the U.S. Mint in Philadelphia. He retired from the Superintendent position in 1902, and after that, spent the rest of his life in various pursuits.\n\nHe was a fan of farming, especially dairy farming, and at one point through his retirement had a 130+-acre dairy farm that he worked painstakingly on. It was reported that at this farm, Boyer remodeled every single farm building, purchased the best farm implements, got everything up to date, and had some of the most fertile soil in Pennsylvania. Besides investing in his dairy farm, he invested in land and other buildings, such as an old hotel, and enjoyed planting as much foliage as possible around his many acres of land, just as he encouraged citizens to do in one of his signature bills as a state representative.\n\nIn 1910, he was living as a boarder in Collegeville, Pennsylvania, in 1920 he was living by himself in Lower Providence, Pennsylvania, and in 1930 Boyer was living in Red Hill, Pennsylvania.\n\nNever married, and never having children, Henry K. Boyer died at the age of 83, days shy of his 84th birthday, on February 14, 1934, in Red Hill, Pennsylvania. He was buried at Chelten Hills Cemetery. The York Dispatch eulogized him as âone of the well[-]known figures of a past generation in politics,â and the Philadelphia Inquirer highlighted him as âan outstanding figure in Pennsylvania politics in the last quarter of the 19th century.â\n\nJohn W. Morrison\n\nEarly Life\n\nJohn Wallace Morrison was born in the Philadelphia area on February 15, 1841, to Irish parents John Morrison and Hannah Wallace. He was one of at least 11 children and was raised mainly in western Pennsylvania. Living in Mercer County at a young age, Morrison obtained an apprenticeship position in Pittsburgh to work as an errand boy and assistant for a photography store owned by a brother-in-law. It was the same store and business that he would buy outright years later, and a position that Morrison would hold until the beginning of the Civil War.\n\nMilitary Service, Community Engagement, & Political Beginnings\n\nIn 1861, Morrison returned to the Mercer County area from Pittsburgh and enlisted in the military. He was a Private in Company E, 100th Pennsylvania Volunteers Division. Eighteen months of being in this role led to a promotion as Sgt. Major, after two months he was then a Second Lieutenant, and then he held that position until mustered out of service. While in the military, the Harrisburg Telegraph reports him as always being âlively, cheerful, hopeful, (and) full of grit â¦ his splendid record as a comrade and soldier since the war make him exceedingly popular with all classes.â\n\nMorrison returned to work as a merchant in Pittsburgh after the war, marrying Jerusha Burchfield shortly after his return. Together, they raised their family mostly in Bellevue, Allegheny County. In the 1880s, while living in Bellevue and being active in the community as a bookkeeper, Morrison was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives as a Republican. He served as Journal Clerk of the House (1885-1887) and Chief Clerk of the House (1889-1891). After his stint as a Representative, Morrison decided to seek the position of Treasurer of Pennsylvania.\n\nPath To & Time as Treasurer of Pennsylvania\n\nMorrison, living in Allegheny County at the time, was nominated for Treasurer on the first ballot at the State Republican Convention in August 1891, with a vote in affirmation of 167-31-2. There, Mr. A.C. Robertson of Allegheny County stated that Morrisonâs name was âa synonym â¦ for honesty and bravery â¦ the Allegheny contingent fairly cheered themselves hoarse over Mr. Robertsonâs eloquence and the record of the man.â The Carlisle Evening Herald also reported that Morrison and the rest of the statewide Republican slate âwere vigorously cheered, returned their thanks, and (then) the convention adjourned.â\n\nMorrison went on to defeat his opponent, and was sworn in as Treasurer in 1892. Upon taking office, he was âhighly pleasedâ with the Commonwealthâs finances. He was popular throughout his two-year term, filing the normal Treasury statements in papers throughout the Commonwealth while at the same time being lauded by the press.\n\nUpon leaving office, The Harrisburg Telegraph reported that he âleaves the position with the hearty and well-deserved praise of citizen of the State. A partisan in politics, his political predilections were never shown in the conduct of the affairs of his department. Scrupulously honest, hewing to the line at all times when the interests of the State were to be furthered, a good business man, courteous at all times, he was an official of who the State could well be proud. The people of Pennsylvania made no mistake when they elected John W. Morrison State Treasurer. He went into office with the idea that the Stateâs business was his particular private business, and on that line he based all of his actions. That he succeeded is evident.â\n\nSpeaking more about his time as Treasurer, the Harrisburg Daily Independent said of Morrison that he âhas been assiduous in the discharge of the duties of his office, only spending Sunday of each week with his family at Alleghany â¦ [H]e is to-day one of the most popular officials that has ever served the state of Pennsylvania. The attaches of the treasury as well as all other state departments and citizens of Harrisburg regret to see Captain Morrison leave the position which he held and filled with so much honor and nobility.â\n\nLater Political Pursuits & Death\n\nAfter the end of his term, Morrison moved to Delaware County with his family and was appointed Deputy Commissioner of Banking for the State of Pennsylvania in 1895. He served in the role for more than 20 years. He died on August 12, 1934, in Radnor, Pennsylvania, months after the passing of his wife. He was survived by four children, and was buried in Valley Forge Memorial Gardens in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania.\n\nSamuel Jackson\n\nEarly Life\n\nA Civil War Union Brevet Brigadier General, Samuel McCartney Jackson was born on September 24, 1833, near Apollo, Armstrong County, Pennsylvania. The youngest of two children to farmer John Jackson and his wife Elizabeth McCartney, Henry was raised mainly on the family farm in Apollo. At the age of 12, he enlisted as a drummer boy in the Pennsylvania Militia. Jackson held membership for many years, well through the Civil War, and at the age of 16 he started schooling at Jacksonville Academy in Indiana County. After the unexpected death of his father, he dropped out after a year of schooling and focused his pursuits on the militia while residing in the Apollo area.\n\nAfter trading in his early dream of a strong liberal arts education for an early career in the militia, Jackson moved up through the military ranks. When the Civil War broke out while in his mid-20s, Jackson committed the actions in which he was always remembered for. About his service, it was written that âhe was promoted step by step until he obtained a Captainâs commission â¦ [A]t Spotsylvania, Jackson commanded his Brigade so well that he was brevetted a Brigadier General. At Gettysburg, General Jackson displayed his keenness of judgment and powers of command by ordering his Regiment forward â¦ he fought at Second Bull Run, Antietam, and Fredericksburg just to name a few.â\n\nAs a farmer and merchant with strong roots to the area, Jackson additionally served as postmaster of Apollo in 1861, and later was elected Burgess. In these positions as a community leader and politician, he was vital to bringing the sheet steel industry to the Kiskiminetas (Kiski) Valley.\n\nIn 1860, Jackson married Martha Byerly, with whom he had three children. She died in 1864, and in December 1869 he remarried Mary Easton Wilson in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania. They had two children. Through his youngest daughter, Elizabeth Jackson Stewart, Jackson is the great-grandfather of famed 20th century actor James Stewart, who was born in Indiana County.\n\nPost-Civil War: Political & Business Endeavors\n\nIn 1871, Jackson assisted in organizing the Apollo Savings Bank, serving as Cashier there until 1882 when President Chester Alan Arthur appointed him as an IRS collector for the area. He served in that position until 1885, until political removal by President Arthur. Jackson was later elected president of Apollo Savings Bank, which changed its name to the Apollo Trust Company. He held that position until his death. After the war ended, Jackson was also involved in the oil business in Venango County, Pennsylvania; however, he returned to Armstrong County in 1889.\n\nThat year, using his status as a Civil War leader, community merchant, and local politician, he was elected to the Pennsylvania General Assembly as a Representative for the 1868 and 1869 terms. It was a position in which Jackson was later re-elected to, and eventually, decided against a third term. He was later elected to and served in the State Senate from 1875 to 1876. In the Senate, Jackson was Chairman of the Bank Committee, and a member of the Bill Comparison and Military Affairs Committee.\n\nIn 1886, Jackson and others in the Apollo community assisted in the founding of the firm of P. H. Laufman & Co. Limited, with a capital stock of $150,000. They had three mills in operation, with Jackson being elected Treasurer as a stockholder. The company was sold to the United States Steel Corporation in 1900. Jackson was a lifelong member of the Presbyterian Church, and was also an elder. As a politician and leader, he was active in local affairs, seeking to improve the life of the public.\n\nAs Treasurer\n\nAfter serving terms as a Pennsylvania Representative and Senator, being considered at times a candidate for Governor, and receiving the endorsement of his county to run for Congress but never officially doing so, the last elected position Jackson ran for and held was that of Treasurer of Pennsylvania. The nomination that year was his for the taking â with his background and party connections, the field was cleared in his favor.\n\nAfter securing the nomination by acclamation, he was elected to the position in 1893 with a margin of more than 135,000 votes. Before the election, The Harrisburg Telegraph wrote that Jackson was a man who âdeserves honor.â He took office in 1894 and appointed B.J. Haywood as Cashier, keeping all other staffing assignments intact. Jackson kept the office in seemingly good financial condition, and retired upon the completion of his term in 1896.\n\nLater Life & Death\n\nAfter retiring from politics, Jackson remained active in community affairs and was widely respected across the Commonwealth until his passing. After an illness, Brevet Brigadier General Jackson died on May 8, 1906 in Apollo. He is buried in Apolloâs Riverview Cemetery. Armstrong County, Pa., Her People, Past and Present, published in 1904, writes that âhis was surely the fullness of an ideal life. As a soldier he was obedient and brave; as an officer, gallant and fearless; as a statesman, conscientious and wise.â\n\nBenjamin Haywood\n\nEarly Life & Starting Out in Business\n\nBenjamin Haywood was born on April 12, 1849, in Hickory Township, Mercer County, Pennsylvania. His family was living on a farm in what is now Hermitage. He was one of four children born to Benjamin and Catherine (Long) Haywood. His parents were described in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette as âwell-respected citizens of the community.â Both of his parents were also born in Pennsylvania, and his father was a farmer.\n\nBeing raised in Mercer County, Haywood was a member of the local home guard and was educated in the county common schools. At sixteen, he entered the Iron City Business College of Pittsburgh for business courses. While working as a clerk around this time, he discerned that he preferred retail merchandising, and after his formal education took that on as a profession.\n\nIn 1873, he took a position as a bank teller in West Middlesex Borough, Mercer County, and stayed in that position for five years. Haywood was extremely involved in West Middlesex politics, also serving as a member of the Borough Council, Auditor, and three terms as Burgess. He additionally held memberships in fraternal organizations, including the Ancient Order of United Workmen and the Freemasons.\n\nAround the same time that he switched his profession more into the financial world, Haywood married Elizabeth Powell on July 29, 1873. The couple had no children.\n\nPolitical Involvement & Professional Development\n\nFour years after his marriage, Haywood accepted an appointment as postmaster of West Middlesex, a position he held from 1877 to 1885. He additionally became a Message Clerk for the Pennsylvania Senate during the 1885 and 1887 sessions, and served for four years as Chairman of the Mercer County Republican Committee. His work as Chairman was well-noted and received, with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette writing that Haywood âdisplayed great tact in organizing the Republican forces and wresting the control of the county from Democrats.â\n\nIn 1887, Haywood was elected to a three-year term as Prothonotary of Mercer County, and shortly after the expiration of that term, he was appointed receiver of the First National Bank of Clearfield by the Comptroller of the Currency. Writing about his role there, the Snyder County Tribune said âhis management of the affairs of this institution was such as to win for him the highest approval. The creditors were paid in full, the stockholders have received a dividend of 30%, and there is prospect of more.â\n\nIn 1893, Haywood ran for the Republican Nomination to be the Treasurer of Pennsylvania as a political ally of the powerful Pennsylvania Senator, Matthew Quay. He was sidetracked from contention due to conflict between dueling political machines in different corners of the Commonwealth, with the Pittsburgh Press declaring on August 14, 1893, that Haywood had been âdumped â¦ it can now be accepted as settled that (Col. Samuel) Jackson will be the Republican nominee for State Treasurer.â Haywood quickly dropped out of the race.\n\nIn 1894, he was appointed Cashier of the Pennsylvania Treasury Department by Col. Samuel Jackson, the same man who had beat him out for the nomination the prior year. He held this position until his own election outright as Pennsylvania Treasurer.\n\nCampaign & Time as Treasurer\n\nIn 1895, as Cashier of the Pennsylvania Treasury Department, Haywood garnered enough support from county political organizations across the Commonwealth to set himself up for another run for Treasurer. Described by the Harrisburg Telegraph as a âgenial, big-hearted Republican,â it was a waltz to the nomination.\n\nAt the Pennsylvania Republican Party Convention that year, his nomination was introduced by the Hon. Representative Henry Hall (R-Mercer County) and approved by acclamation. He defeated his Democratic opponent by more than 174,000 votes, and took office in 1896.\n\nAs Treasurer, Haywood maintained an active political profile, supporting Sen. Quay for the Presidency and becoming involved in a number of political disputes. The Treasury remained in what appeared to be good order throughout his term, however Haywood, Quay, and other politicos became embroiled in a lawsuit regarding the use of public funds, it consumed press coverage for a good portion of his final time in office. Despite this, Haywood was described by press reports as one of the most popular Treasurers to date.\n\nUpon the expiration of his term, he was re-appointed as Cashier of the Pennsylvania Treasury by his successor, James Beacom.\n\nPost-Office & Death\n\nHaywood was sick while leaving office, and the illness continued while he worked in his old role as Cashier of the Pennsylvania Treasury. His time in Harrisburg became less frequent. In 1898, by âextraordinary willpower [he] went to the department on Christmas Eve and distributed gifts to the employees before starting back for Sharon [Pennsylvania].â\n\nA few months later, on February 23, 1899, Haywood died in Sharon. His widow lived until 1924. Both are buried at Haywood Cemetery in West Middlesex, Pennsylvania.\n\nJames S. Beacom\n\nEarly Life\n\nJames Spear Beacom was born in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania on December 9, 1853, to schoolteacher-turned-minister Henry Beacom and Mary Spear. He was one of five children and was raised mainly in western Pennsylvania. Beacom was educated in the Westmoreland County Public Schools, attending Elderton Academy. He owned and operated the Blairsville Enterprise, a Republican newspaper, and began employment as a principal at Blairsville Academy. In the 1880s, he graduated from Washington & Jefferson College after studying law.\n\nPolitical Beginnings & Personal Life\n\nAfter graduating from Washington & Jefferson, Beacom returned to Westmoreland County where he began practicing law. A staunch Republican active in political circles and volunteering with campaigns, he allied with powerful Pennsylvania politician Matthew Quay and was elected as a Republican member of the House of Representatives in 1886 for the 1887-88 session. Beacom was a successful candidate for re-election in 1888 for the 1889-90 session and retired from the House after the end of his second term. In 1896, he was elected to be a Delegate At Large at the Republican National Convention in St. Louis, Missouri, after failing to secure a nomination for Congress. The Canonsburg Weekly Notes described Beacom as âa good lawyer with a big practice.â\n\nBeacom married Mary H. Zimmers, a graduate of the Blairsville Female Seminary, on July 17, 1888, in Indiana County, Pennsylvania. Together, they raised four children on North Main Street in Greensburg, Westmoreland County.\n\nPath To & Time as Treasurer of Pennsylvania\n\nAfter serving in the House for two terms, as well as being a delegate to the 1896 Republican National Convention, Beacom decided to be a candidate for the Republican Nomination for Treasurer of Pennsylvania.\n\nDespite an effort by the Allegheny County Republicans to stop his bid, Beacom easily was given the Republican Treasurer nomination in 1897. He had strong opposition in the form of a Prohibition Party candidate, which hurt his chances for the general election. On Election Day, he won with an overall plurality of over 146,000, but he ran behind the Republican state ticket. Newspapers do attribute this to the Prohibition Party, but also to Beacomâs allegiance to political boss Matthew Quay. The Wilkes-Barre Semi-Weekly Record wrote that ââ¦ he (Beacom) is admittedly an upright, honest man â¦ he is thus singled out for opposition because he has stood with Senator Quay.â\n\nAfter being inaugurated, Beacom took charge of state finances and was active in civic and social events throughout the Capitol and Commonwealth. Democrats were eager to flip the office, and in 1899, it was reported that âDemocratic leaders â¦ have been amazed at the bold and defiant matter in which Republicans â¦ have met every attack made upon the administration of the State Treasury. â¦ State Treasurer James S. Beacom â¦ meets the people face to face to discuss the condition of the Commonwealth with the taxpayers.â\n\nBeacom served until 1900 and was succeeded by James Barnett. After his term, The History Of Westmoreland County wrote that Beacom âeffected some radical changes in the management of that important office, leaving its finances in better shape than many previous years.â\n\nLater Political Pursuits & Death\n\nAfter the end of his term, Beacom sought and was elected to another term in the House as a Republican. Once again, he did not seek re-election afterwards and then held no elected or appointed position for many years after returning to Greensburg.\n\nIn 1920, he was appointed as a Judge on the Westmoreland County Orphanâs Court. He served for two years. For a number of years, Beacom sat on the Board of Trustees of his alma mater, Washington & Jefferson College. He was also Methodist and a longtime member of the Methodist Episcopal Church in Westmoreland County.\n\n76-year-old James Spear Beacom died at his residence, 521 North Main Street in Greensburg, Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania, on February 15, 1930. He was buried at Blairsville Cemetery in Blairsville, Indiana County, Pennsylvania, and was survived by his wife, son, and three daughters.\n\nJames E. Barnett\n\nEarly Life, Career, & Military Service\n\nJames Elder Barnett was born on August 1, 1856, in Elders Ridge, Indiana County, Pennsylvania. The oldest of three children to minister John Morrison Barnett and his wife Martha Robinson Elder, census records indicate that James was raised mainly in Connellsville, Fayette County, Pennsylvania, before moving to Washington County. He was educated in the county common school system, and chose to attend Jefferson College. Barnett graduated from there in 1882, studied law, and chose to continue studies at Columbia Law School. In 1890, Barnett was admitted to the Bar.\n\nEven though Barnett had formal training and education as a lawyer, his main pursuits involved the military. He joined the 10th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Division in 1884, âstarting out as a Private and working up to the Lieutenant-Colonelcy,â and even âdeclined an appointment to the Colonelcyâ in 1899, according to the Altoona Post. With his high military profile and law degree, Barnett was appointed Deputy Secretary of The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in 1896.\n\nThe Daily American out of Somerset also reported that Barnett âorganized the borough of East Washington, Pennsylvania, and served as burgess for three terms.â\n\nCampaign For & Time as Treasurer\n\nBarnett received the Republican nomination for Treasurer of Pennsylvania on August 24, 1899, as an ally of Pennsylvania political boss Matthew Quay. His very public military service, along with his formal training as a lawyer and hometown political involvement, led him to this position. The News-Journal in Lancaster reported at the time that the nomination for Barnett was âmade by acclamation and he was unanimously accepted.â\n\nWhile the campaign for Treasurer began in earnest, however, Barnett was returning from military service in the Philippines. He was officially discharged on August 22, 1899 â just two days before receiving the Republican nomination. In fact, newspaper records also indicate that he was recovering from a bout of malaria during the campaign season. This is shown in the Chambersburg Public Weekly Opinion on September 22, 1899, when it was reported that âLieutenant-Colonel James E. Barnett, of the Tenth Pennsylvania Volunteers, (was) just home from Luzon.â\n\nIn this same issue, playing off of his military strength, it was also shown how fellow veterans and military members who served with Barnett were forming a âBarnett Battalion â¦ who propose to cooperate in the canvas for the election of Lieutenant-Colonel James E. Barnett, of the Fighting Tenth Regiment, for State Treasurer.â\n\nA week before Election Day, on November 4, 1899, the Lewisburg Chronicle ran a large article about the candidacy of Barnett and described him this way: âA brave soldier â¦ as Lieutenant-Colonel of the famous 10th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, he made a great name for himself as a courageous officer and a daring soldier. He is honest, faithful and sincere and will conduct the high office to which he will be elected on Tuesday, with fidelity and honor.â\n\nDespite having Quayâs backing, Barnett did face political attacks from his own party. Congressman Ernest Acheson, also from Washington County, attacked Barnett in a published July 20, 1899, York Times interview for not being a âstraight Republicanâ â¦ Congressman Acheson then went on to also accuse Lieutenant-Colonel Barnett of contributing âto Democratic success.â Attacks were made upon his military service, too, with the Pittsburgh Daily Post reporting on November 8, 1899, that his reputation was âcut considerablyâ as a result.\n\nDespite the critics, Barnett won the election by more than a 100,000-vote plurality and became the next Treasurer of Pennsylvania.\n\nUpon his installment into office on May 7, 1900, the Somerset Herald wrote âPennsylvania has a State Treasurer who owns himself.â Barnett was applauded for his work at Treasury throughout his 1900-1902 term, with even the sitting Governor publicly praising him for his work in keeping the department in a strong financial position. He published specific financial figures frequently for the public, participated in fairs and community engagements, and âensure(d) a continuance of the careful business administration of the office,â as written in the Indiana Weekly Messenger on May 9, 1900.\n\nHe left office in 1902, and before he did so, gave out countless cigars to those he had worked with in Treasury and on Capitol Hill. He never held another elected political position and returned to the practice of law in the East Washington area, remaining in the public eye as a military figure.\n\nLater Life & Death\n\nIn 1910, Barnett was living in East Washington. He listed his occupation in the census that year as a civil lawyer, aged 48. Ten years later, he lists himself as a general practice attorney, still living in East Washington. In 1930, he is still marked as a lawyer in census data, and finally in 1940, Barnett appears to be retired. He never married, and died at the age of 83 at his home in East Washington, Pennsylvania on June 10, 1940. He had been ill for years prior, and was buried at Washington Cemetery in Washington, Pennsylvania, with a headstone showcasing his promotion to Brigadier General.\n\nFrancis (Frank) Harris\n\nEarly Life, Career, & Government Service\n\nFrancis Graham Harris was born on November 6, 1845, in Karthaus, Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, to John Harris and Eleanor Graham. His father, a miner, was born in Scotland and died when Francis was 10; his mother Eleanor, who was born in Pennsylvania, died before he was five. As a result, Harris was raised in various towns throughout Clearfield County by his maternal aunt and uncle, Hetty Graham and Col. Samuel Patchen, who were reportedly involved in the Underground Railroad.\n\nHe attended the county schools while growing up in Clearfield County, and the Lewisburg Chronicle wrote in 1902 that during the summer âfrom the time he was twelve years of age â¦ (he) worked on the farm â¦ and in the winter worked in the lumber woods and on a saw mill, and became a practical farmer and lumberman. At the age of 15 he made his first trip down the Susquehanna as a raftsman, and at 20 he was one of the best pilots on the river.â\n\nHe went on to Dickinson Seminary (now Lycoming College) at the age of 24 and graduated with honors in 1873. He then attended Lafayette College for law, and graduated in 1876. Immediately upon graduation, he was hired as a Principal of the Clearfield County grammar schools, and in 1879 was admitted to the Clearfield County Bar. In 1881, he was elected to chair the Clearfield County Republican Committee until 1883, and was elected to Clearfield Council, a tenure lasting seven years.\n\nIn April 1879, Harris married Elizabeth Frances Baird. They had three children together, none of whom lived to adulthood. Elizabeth died in 1904, and Harris remarried Glenora Gearhart.\n\nRun for Treasurer & Time in Office\n\nAs an established county lawyer with experience in local political circles, Harris was a Republican Delegate to the 1883 State Party Convention, and was pushed to run for the State Legislature in 1896. He decided to do so, won by more than 1,400 votes, and was twice re-elected, serving three terms from 1897 to 1902. While in the Legislature, Harris was a member of the Judiciary Committee and at one time chaired the Fish & Game Committee. Harris was heavily involved in that area legislatively, as he wrote a noted 1897 game bill and was a member of the Pennsylvania State Sportsmenâs Association.\n\nHe also ended up chairing the Judiciary Committee during one of his terms, and sought the Speakership in a failed 1901 bid. He left the Legislature after his 1901-1902 term. The Lewisburg Chronicle summed up his legislative career as âfair, upright, and honorable, and his ability and integrity are unquestioned.â The Evening Republican in Meadville heaped more praise on the legislative skill Harris possessed, writing that he was ââ¦ one of the most forceful and tactful leaders on the floor of the house, he has always commanded respect.â\n\nA sitting Representative in 1901, Harris was nominated for and won the Republican nomination for Treasurer of Pennsylvania that year with no opposition. Upon his nomination, the Lewisburg Chronicle wrote that âFrank G. Harris, our neighbor from Clearfield â¦ is a man of sterling qualities, who will perform the duties of that office in a matter that will reflect credit upon his party and the state â¦ [L]eft an orphan boy in early childhood, he struggled up through poverty and toll to an honorable position among men.â\n\nHarris easily won the general election and was sworn in for a term lasting from 1902 to 1904. He published regular accounts of state funds in the newspapers, attended community events, and left office when his term expired in 1904. His term was relatively quiet, as most newspaper records during his time in the treasurerâs office consist of those state funding accounts. Treasurer was the last elected position he would hold and capped off his long political career.\n\nLater Life & Death\n\nHarris was involved in real estate, and also at one time was director of the Clearfield Trust Company and Clearfield Hospital. He remained a general practicing attorney in Clearfield County, and died at the age of 83 on May 20, 1929, in the town of Clearfield, and was buried in the local Hillcrest Cemetery.\n\nWilliam Mathues\n\nEarly Life, Education, & Beginning of Government Service\n\nWilliam Lincoln Mathues was born on March 24, 1862, in Aston, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, one of seven children to William F. Mathues and Emiline Willis. His father, a dry goods merchant and Deputy Sheriff, was born in Chester County, while his mother was born in Aston. Mathues was raised in Delaware County and went to the county common schools from a young age and graduated from the local high school in Media. He then began reading law and was admitted to the Bar in 1884.\n\nMathues married Charlotte Goodley in 1884; they had four boys. She died in 1891, and he remarried Maurgarita R. Louden in 1894. Together, they had two more boys, both of whom did not live to adulthood.\n\nAlmost immediately after being admitted to the Bar, Mathues began his political career in Delaware County. Speaking about his various positions and long career as a politician, The Lewisburg Chronicle wrote that he âhas always taken an active interest in public affairs.â\n\nHe served as Deputy Sheriff (under his father, who was then serving as Sheriff) for two years from January 1885. He then became Deputy Prothonotary of Delaware County, a position he held until 1892. In November 1891, he was elected to the office of Prothonotary and Clerk of the Courts in Delaware County â¦ he gave eminent satisfaction in the discharge of his official duties, so much so that he was repeatedly urged to continue in office â¦ Mr. Mathues is the acknowledged leader of the Republicans of Delaware County. He has labored intelligently and unceasingly in behalf of the Republican Party â¦ to him must be given much of the credit for the harmonious conditions which exist among the Republicans of Delaware County. He has been Chairman of the Delaware County Executive Committee for the last six years and has represented his party in numerous conventions.â\n\nNext Steps, Campaign for Treasurer, & Time as Treasurer\n\nAfter graduating high school in Media, reading law in his local community, and then immediately jumping into politics alongside his father, Mathues had amassed considerable political power. Having cemented himself as a political force in Delaware County, his political foray to the office of State Treasurer was widely supported in his area and across the state.\n\nThe headline of the Delaware County Daily Times on May 26, 1903, read âDelaware County To Take The State Capital By Storm Today,â documenting the âBiggest demonstration ever made by Delaware County at the Capital of the Commonwealth, to be given in honor of William Lincoln Mathues, the Chief of the Local Organization, Who is to Be a State Standard Bearer â¦ Splendidly Equipped Clubs to move on Harrisburg and Show the People How to Whoop âEm Up For The County Leader, The Next State Treasurer.â\n\nThis campaign strategy worked, and during the summer of 1903 Mathues was unanimously named the Republican nominee for Treasurer, marking the first statewide win for him in what was at that point a strong, local political career. He defeated his Democratic opponent by the largest margin for a Republican in state history at that time, and took office on May 2, 1904. As reported in the Lancaster News-Journal, Mathues said âthere would be no radical change in the administration of the treasury.â\n\nAfter a failed run for Governor in 1905 (while he was the sitting Treasurer), Mathues left office in 1906 as generally popular. However, from this time until the end of his life in 1908, he became embroiled in a corruption scandal that ended with him being sentenced to prison. Mathues was accused of misappropriating state funds relating to capitol furnishings and construction, especially as it related to contracts, to benefit himself and his political machine, throughout his time in office. None of this emerged publicly until after his term ended.\n\nConviction & Death\n\nPublic opinion significantly turned on Mathues in 1907. In September of that year, he was caught in the Capital at midnight scanning through the Treasury books with some of his top political lieutenants from Delaware County. Mathues was described as a nervous wreck, and everyone was escorted out.\n\nHis successor, Treasurer William Berry, went public about his distrust, problems, and suspicions with Mathues, and articles filled the newspapers with headlines like, âNew Capitol Graft Exposed.â A formal investigation was launched and warrants were issued. Mathues tried to portray himself as just a poor administrator during his term as Treasurer, as referenced in the Pittsburgh Press on June 27, 1907.\n\nAs reported in the Coudersport Cotter Enterprise, on December 18, 1907, Mathues was sentenced to two years in Philadelphiaâs famous Eastern State Penitentiary for âconspiracy to defraud the state through contracts for furnishing.â It was the maximum penalty allowed, handed down by Dauphin County Judge George Kunkel.\n\nHowever, Mathues never served his sentence, as he died of pneumonia in Media on December 30, 1908. The Harrisburg Telegraph eulogized him as a born leader and a household name, who was feared by those who did not respect him. Mathues was buried in Media Cemetery in Delaware County.\n\nWilliam Berry\n\nEarly Life, Education, & Career\n\nWilliam Harvey Berry was born on September 9, 1852, in Edwardsville, Madison County, Illinois, one of four children to Benjamin Berry and Mary Beard. His father, a mechanic and inventor, was born in Illinois and had deep family ties to that state, while his mother was born in Virginia. Berry was raised in Illinois and took an interest in mechanics while attending the county schools, moving from Illinois to Buffalo to attend a mechanical academy there.\n\nIn 1873, he graduated from that institution and then moved to Chester, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, where job prospects were. Berry then worked with the Eddystone Manufacturing Company in that area and was even at one time appointed master mechanic, holding the position for over seventeen years. Berry married Susan Schofield on October 1, 1879, in Philadelphia, and together they had four boys and a girl. They raised their family in Chester.\n\nIn his adopted hometown of Chester, Berry began the Berry Engineering Company in 1903, which produced a specialty boiler. In addition to running this business, also in Chester, he served as Treasurer of the Fields Brick Company.\n\nBeginning of Government Service, Campaign for Treasurer, & Time as Treasurer\n\nAs a noted businessman, engineer, and machinist, Berry began his political career locally, being elected Mayor of Chester in early 1905. His political star grew quickly, as Berry resigned the position before the year was even over to campaign as a Democrat for Pennsylvania State Treasurer.\n\nAfter capturing the nomination, Berry was elected Treasurer of Pennsylvania in November 1905, the first Democrat to win a statewide election in Pennsylvania in more than 40 years. Newspaper reports in the days preceding the election heralded the end of the âRepublican Machine,â including the Carlisle Evening Herald on November 8, 1905: âThe election of William H. Berry, a Democrat, as Treasurer of Pennsylvania by such a splendid majority, does honor and credit to her good citizens in every walk of life â¦ the lesson means the beginning of the end of the greatest and most corrupt machine ever conceived in American politics. It means that the debauchery of the peopleâs money in the state treasury â¦ is over.â\n\nAfter taking office in early 1906, Berry promised âreform in Treasury methods,â as reported in the Harrisburg Telegraph on October 13, 1906. However, as the lone statewide elected Democrat in a usually Republican position, he frequently was targeted in the press. âBerry Confesses â¦ Accused of the Very Practices For Which He Denouncedâ the piece in the Telegraph read, documenting a âbackyard dealâ business arrangement that Berry apparently had as Treasurer with a Trust Company, that the press viewed as unsecure and not having enough sound financial protection for citizens of the Commonwealth. The Lewisburg Chronicle was more direct in talking of the matter, writing that âBerry is a shattered idol.â\n\nHowever, in 1907, Berryâs reputation began to turn more positive after his predecessor, former Treasurer William L. Mathues, was found snooping around the Treasury financial books at nearly midnight and was escorted out of the building. The event even earned coverage in The New York Times, which reported, âA sensation was caused here [Harrisburg] to-day by the discovery that William L. Mathues, formerly State Treasurer, who figures in the new Capitol scandal, was detected looking over the books of the Treasury Department about 11 oâclock last night. Patrick McGrann, a clerk, found Mathues.â\n\nBerry ordered an investigation, and went straight to the press with his distrust of Mathues and his suspicions that something untoward was going on. His office ultimately uncovered $7.7 million worth of unappropriated costs related to Capitol furnishings that had been approved by Mathues. At the end of his term in 1908, The Harrisburg Telegraph reported on May 20, âMr. Berryâs official conduct is so great as to win the admiration of the people of the Commonwealth.â\n\nPost-Treasury & Death\n\nAfter leaving office, Berry stayed active in politics. He ran for Governor in 1910 as an independent on the Keystone Party platform, but was defeated in a close election, 41 percent to 38 percent, by Republican John Tener. Berry served as a Delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1912 and 1924, and stayed active as an engineer and mechanic.\n\nOn June 19, 1928, Berry died in Chester and was buried at Chester Rural Cemetery.\n\nJohn Sheatz\n\nEarly Life, Military Service, & Career\n\nJohn Oscar Sheatz was born on February 22, 1855, in Lehigh County, likely in Mechanicsville, as one of four children to John Sheatz and Almira Troxell. His parents were both born in the Commonwealth, and Sheatz was eligible for membership in the Sons of the American Revolution. He was educated in the county schools and attended Muhlenberg College. He also held a military position as a First Regiment Infantry Member of the Pennsylvania National Guard.\n\nIn the mid-1880s, he married Marion Queen, and the couple had one daughter, also named Marion. Regarding his career, Sheatz became an apprentice at the Baldwin Locomotive Works for five years, and was employed there for a further 13 years.\n\nEarly Political Career, Run for Treasurer, & Time as Treasurer\n\nSheatz began his political career in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, being elected as a Republican in 1902, 1904, and 1906. He was a well-respected and active member of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives for three terms, before turning his sights on becoming Treasurer of Pennsylvania. When he decided to run for the position, the convention in the summer of 1907 was âunanimousâ for him to be the Republican nominee for Pennsylvania State Treasurer that year, as reported in the Harrisburg Telegraph on June 6.\n\nHe then attracted wide media attention across the state while campaigning. On September 20, 1907, the Mount Union Times declared, âSheatz In Demand â¦ He Is The Man Of The Hour.â As the election drew near, the Snyder County Tribune ran this headline on November 1, 1907: âSheatz Has Scored, Nominee For Treasurer Has Made A Hit With The People.â The article stated, âJohn O. Sheatz â¦ is winding up a tour of the state â¦ he has shown himself to be a real vote getter.â\n\nSheatz defeated his Democratic opponent and took office on May 6, 1908, resigning from his House Seat on May 1, 1908. âMr. Sheatz practically made a clean sweep [by] replacing all the former force with new men,â wrote the Franklin Repository that same day. âThe whole affair was very informal.â Sheatz served from 1908 to 1910 in the typical style of most of his predecessors, reporting Commonwealth financial statements in the papers as well as attending social and political events. However, as his term was expiring in 1910, the Commonwealth faced an interesting quandary related to his service.\n\nThe News-Journal in Lancaster reported in May 1910 that âJ.A. Stober had been elected to succeed Mr. Sheatz, but died several months after the November election.â Despite losing the election, Sheatz â in light of his opponentâs untimely death â refused to leave office when his term expired. Further, he defied calls to yield to the person appointed by Governor Edwin Sydney Stuart (a fellow Republican) to replace him, Congressman Charles F. Wright (also a Republican).\n\nEventually, the state Supreme Court decided the issue as described by the Harrisburg Daily Independent with this headline on Monday, May 2, 1910: âState Supreme Court Ousts John O. Sheatz From State Treasury â¦ Unique Controversy Ends With Todayâs Decision.â\n\nLater Years & Death\n\nAfter being removed from office in 1910, Sheatz failed in a 1911 campaign to serve as Philadelphia City Controller. However, he then ran for and won a special election for Pennsylvania State Senate, serving from 1912 to 1914. His term in the Senate was his final political endeavor. After leaving the Senate, he became President of the Moshanon Creek Coal Mining Company.\n\nThroughout his life, Sheatz also dabbled in the real estate industry at the same time as political service and coal mining, while additionally serving as Treasurer of the Frank Queen Mining Company in New York. This is what he was doing in 1920, while enumerated by the Census with his wife and living in Philadelphia. Sheatz died on June 25, 1922, in Atlantic City, New Jersey. He is buried in West Laurel Hill Cemetery in Bala Cynwyd, Montgomery County.\n\nCharles Wright\n\nEarly Life\n\nCharles Frederick Wright was born on May 3, 1856, in Forest Lake, Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania as the youngest of two children to Chester Wright and Julia Nickerson. His parents were both born in the Commonwealth, and his father was a manufacturer with a family that was well-known in Susquehanna County. Wright was educated in the county, attending nearby Montrose Academy, and graduated in 1874.\n\nAdditionally, he was involved with the manufacturing of some chemical wood products as well as oil work. Wright married Rose Allen, likely in the early 1880s, the couple had two children. He later married Minnie Miller in Susquehanna Depot on April 30, 1890. They had one son together.\n\nEarly Political Career and Appointment & Run for Treasurer\n\nWhile working mainly in the Susquehanna County financial sector, especially in the 1890s, Wright began to be notably involved in Republican politics. His first election to public office was in 1898, and he served as a Congressman in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1899 to 1905. During his time in the House, Wright served during one term as Chairman of the House Committee on Expenditures in the Department of Agriculture. His brother, Rep. Myron Young, had held the same Congressional seat until his unexpected death in 1894.\n\nDeclining to run for reelection to Congress in 1904, Wright resumed professional pursuits in the financial sector before being appointed to the position of Pennsylvania State Treasurer by Governor Edwin Stuart in 1910. His appointment was made because J.A. Stober of Lancaster County had been elected as Treasurer, but had died before taking office. Incumbent Treasurer John Sheatz then refused to yield the office.\n\nThe Punxsutawney News wrote on January 24, 1912, when Governor Stuart made this decision to now install Wright, âthere was a great deal of satisfaction.â It was then written that Wright âhas discharged the duties of the difficult position to the complete satisfaction of the public â¦ he has made a record in office for efficiency that is unsurpassed.â\n\nBeing that Wright was not elected to the 1910 term, there was discussion about whether he would be constitutionally eligible to run for a term in 1912. The Punxsutawney News made its position clear: âMr. Wright should be renominated and reelected.â\n\nWhen the 1912 Republican Party State Convention came around in Pennsylvania, however, despite the powerful backing of Senator Boise Penrose (R-PA), Wright was unable to secure the nomination to serve a second term as Treasurer. He was confident of a victory in news reports of the days leading up to the convention, and was reported in April as having sent out a form letter to all delegates asking for their support, but as the Pittsburgh Daily Post wrote on May 2, 1912, âWright was defeated badly.â\n\nHe retired at the end of his term in May 1913, and was succeeded by the man who beat him in the primary, Robert Young.\n\nLater Years & Death\n\nAfter losing the 1912 primary, Wright became the Pennsylvania Commissioner of Public Service in 1915 and 1916. He mainly resumed banking and other financial pursuits, and died in Susquehanna Depot on November 10, 1925. He is buried in his hometown of Susquehanna Depot, at Evergreen Cemetery.\n\nRobert Young\n\nEarly Life & Career\n\nRobert Kennedy Young was born on June 14, 1861, in Wellsboro, Tioga County, as the oldest of three boys to Hugh Young and Lois Butterworth. His father, an Irish immigrant, worked in the financial sector as an executive as well as being involved with politics, serving as a State Representative for one term, and his mother was born in neighboring Potter County. His paternal uncle, Thomas Young, was a U.S. Congressman and then Governor of Ohio from 1877 to 1878, while his maternal great-uncle, David Wilmot, represented Pennsylvania both in the U.S. House (1845 to 1851) and the U.S. Senate (1861 to 1863).\n\nYoung was educated in the local Wellsboro schools as well as in New Hampshire, and then read law in his hometown to pass the Bar in 1885. He started up a partnership with the man he read law under, Major George Merrick, in 1886. Merrick was his uncle.\n\nThe Harrisburg Telegraph wrote on May 1, 1912, that Young also was âPresident of the Wellsboro Electric Company, a director of the Tioga County Savings and Trust Company and Secretary of the Tioga County Bar Association â¦ also Librarian of the Tioga County Historical Society and was counsel for the State Capitol Building Commission.â He married Emma Van Mater on October 23, 1890; the couple had no children.\n\nEarly Political Career & Ultimate Run for Treasurer\n\nAfter starting his career as a lawyer and businessman, Young became heavily involved in politics. He was elected as Justice of the Peace of his community in 1889 and was a Delegate to the Republican State Convention in 1895. He was elected as a Republican to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives in both 1896 and 1898, serving through 1900. In 1904, Young was elected as a Delegate to the Republican National Convention.\n\nIn 1906, Young accepted the Republican Nomination for State Auditor General. He stressed reform and the return of calm interparty relations. He was not present at the convention, and responded to his nomination in the form of a letter that was widely published throughout the Commonwealth. Ultimately, Young defeated his Democratic opponent, William T. Creasy, and took office in 1907. He was the 32nd Auditor General of Pennsylvania and served through 1910.\n\nAfter being termed out of office, Young continued his political involvement as well as his multiple business pursuits. He ran for State Treasurer in 1912 against incumbent Charles Wright and was easily nominated, 244 to 108, despite Wrightâs confidence going in. The Wellsboro Agitator remarked during the campaign in October of 1912 that âif experience counts for anything ex-Auditor Robert K. Young is bound to be the most efficient state treasurer that the Keystone State has ever had â¦ not one will dispute the fact that his tenure of office was as near perfect as mortal man could make it.â\n\nUpon taking office, he drifted away from the Pennsylvania Republican party factions and took on more of an independent stance. His management of the Treasury and his alerts about Treasury affairs were amplified by newspaper reports throughout his term. Some of those reports read âTreasurer Explains Withdrawal Needâ read the Philadelphia Inquirer on January 9, 1914. More pressing, the Harrisburg Telegraph published âCondition Of Treasury Alarming â¦ State Treasurer Issues Formal Public Statement to Public and Bankâ on June 30, 1915. These were not direct reflections on him, but rather announcements he was putting out to the media to keep the public informed.\n\nYoung was a successful candidate for renomination, despite reports like in the Pittsburgh Daily Post on February 6, 1914 that âhe [was] not very keen on doing so,â and served as Treasurer through 1917.\n\nLater Years & Death\n\nAfter leaving office, Young attempted to hold the position of Pennsylvania Commissioner of Public Service while serving on the Public Service Board, however his promotion was blocked by his home countyâs state Senator. He died shortly thereafter on September 12, 1917, in Blossburg, Tioga County, after complications from a June fall at his fishing cottage, and is buried at Wellsboro Cemetery.\n\nHarmon Kephart\n\nEarly Life & Career\n\nHarmon Mortimore Kephart was born on July 17, 1865, in Frankstown, Blair County, Pennsylvania, as the eldest of five children to Samuel Kephart and Henrietta Wolfe. His parents were both born in the Commonwealth, and his father, who died on Kephartâs 10th birthday, was a Civil War veteran and well-known western Pennsylvania violin player. A younger brother later served as a Pennsylvania Superior Court Judge, and another younger brother later held a high military rank.\n\nKephart was educated in the McAlisterville State Soldiersâ Orphan School, an institution meant for those who had Civil War veterans as parents or parents who had died while serving, graduating in 1881. He then began his career as a locomotive fireman. Beginning this position with the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1882, Kephart was promoted to locomotive engineer in 1883 and continued with the company until 1885. At that time, he took the same position with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, and continued with them until 1895.\n\nOn October 20, 1887, Kephart married Ida Walton in Fayette County. The couple had three children together.\n\nEarly Political Career\n\nKephart was elected as a Republican in 1894 to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, for the 1895 term. He declined to stand for re-election but launched an unsuccessful campaign in 1899 for the same position. Later, in reports looking back on his government service, Kephart was informally charged with ârunning a speakeasy in Room 213 at the State Capitolâ during his single term as a Representative, as reported in the Bloomsburg Press-Enterprise on May 15, 1916.\n\nIn 1903, Kephart launched an ill-fated bid to become Pennsylvania State Treasurer under the banner of the Citizens Party. He continued to stay involved in Republican politics and within his community of Connellsville, holding membership with the Tariff and Americus Republican Clubs of Pittsburgh as well as the Elk, Moose, and Eagles fraternal organizations. As a businessman, he was involved in the real estate and coal industries and owned the popular Smith House Hotel in Connellsville from 1897 to 1905.\n\nIn 1907, Kephart was appointed as Chief Clerk of the Pennsylvania State Senate. In this position, his political influence grew. The Uniontown Morning Herald reported that he became âone of the most active Republican politicians in this (western) part of the state, and was declared âone of Connellsvilleâs leading men of affairs â¦ the most popular man who ever held the position of Chief Clerk in the Senate.â The next year, Kephart was elected to be a Delegate at the 1908 Republican National Convention.\n\nRun for Treasurer & Time in Office\n\nWhile serving as Chief Clerk of the Pennsylvania State Senate, Kephart launched another bid for Pennsylvania State Treasurer, this time as a Republican. In the 1916 Republican Primary, he won a commanding three-to-one victory and faced Democrat James Cramer in November. He defeated Cramer and resigned his position as Chief Clerk of the Pennsylvania State Senate on May 2, 1916, to assume the position of Pennsylvania State Treasurer later that month.\n\nIn the position, Kephart often published notices of state funds, attended some social events, and stayed in touch with his community. âState Treasurer H.M. Kephart was a visitor here (Meyersdale, Pennsylvania)â the Republic published on October 18, 1917. âHe is still the same old genial and big-hearted Harmon Kephart of former days.â He left office when his term expired in 1921.\n\nLater Life & Death\n\nIn later years, after leaving office, Kephart moved out of the Connellsville and Harrisburg areas and into Lower Merion, in Montgomery County, before later returning.\n\nHe faced some negative public reports in his retirement. On January 26, 1926, the Evening News in Wilkes-Barre reported that Kephart had received a number of loans from state banks while in office that had not been financially sound. On April 14 of the same year, the Harrisburg Telegraph then reported how he was being sued for more than $24,000 in default of business debts. Later, on December 23, 1933, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette additionally published reports accusing Kephart of scholarship fraud at state universities.\n\nIn 1935, Kephart returned to state service as a supervising machine operator in the Department of Internal Affairs. On April 19, 1948, he died in Conellsville after an extended illness, and is buried within the town at Old Saint Josephâs Roman Catholic Cemetery.\n\nCharles Snyder\n\nEarly Life\n\nCharles A. Snyder was born on April 16, 1867 in Pillow, Dauphin County, as the youngest of two children to Civil War veteran William Snyder and Leah Brua. His parents were both born in the Commonwealth, his father was a blacksmith, and he was mainly raised in Dauphin and Schuylkill Counties. Receiving an education in both local county public school as well as private school, Snyder pursued a career in law. He studied law after ending his formal education and was admitted to the Schuylkill County Bar in 1889.\n\nOn May 21, 1891, Snyder married Laura Arters. The couple had two children together.\n\nEarly Political Career & Eventual Run for Treasurer\n\nAfter beginning his law career, Snyder took to Republican politics. His local political involvement included serving as Deputy District Attorney and Solicitor in Pottsville, Schuylkill County Controller, as well as Schuylkill County Solicitor. Many years later, reflecting back on his career, the Harrisburg Independent would write in December of 1931 that he was ââ¦ stepping out of one big office into another.â\n\nThe Independent continued, âSnyder (was) one of the most picturesque political figures in Pennsylvania politics. He started his career in Schuylkill County, but later loomed so large on the political horizon â¦ he was known as the best-dressed politician in the State. Invariably, he wore a fresh carnation in his lapel, which won for him the friendly nickname of âCarnation Charley.â He had been known on âThe Hillâ in Harrisburg for more than thirty years. His jaunty carriage, the peculiar tilt of his hat, and the ever present carnation marked him as he made his way to and from the legislative halls.â\n\nSnyder began his service in Harrisburg after being elected as a State Representative for the 1903-1904 Session. He was reelected twice before standing down for a potential consecutive fourth term in the House. After resigning, he made a campaign for the State Senate that same year, being elected to join the 1909-1910 legislative session. Snyder was then continuously reelected until he made a bid for Pennsylvania Auditor General in 1916.\n\nRunning on the Bull Moose and Republican tickets, he faced Democrat James Murrin in the campaign. The strong ties and reputation Snyder had throughout the Commonwealth as a result of his lengthy time in public service, paired with his demonstrated closeness to his community, were political positives at the time that assisted in the campaign.\n\nâVote For Your Neighbor For Auditor General, Charles A Snyder of Schuylkill,â the Wilkes-Barre Times Leader read, on May 16, 1916. Come November, Snyder was victorious. He officially resigned from his seat in the state Senate on April 30, 1917, to assume the position of Auditor General, serving until 1921.\n\nWhile serving as Auditor General in 1920, Snyder mounted another campaign, this time for Treasurer. Once again, his statewide political connections along with strong relationships in his community provided very politically valuable. âCharles A. Snyder has done much to make this county prominent in state affairsâ wrote the Pottsville Republican on November 1, 1920. âThe future is very bright with prospects for greater political prominence bestowed upon Mr. Snyder, which will add to our countyâs position in outside public affairs. No one should think of politics when it comes to vote on Tuesday for State Treasurer Snyder.â\n\nRunning against Democrat Peter Elsesser, Snyder notched another political victory in November 1920 and won election as Treasurer, a position he held from 1921 to 1924. In 1921, as Treasurer, he was also elected as Chairman of the State Workmenâs Compensation Board. He maintained prominent status as Treasurer despite somewhat frequent attacks from the press for hints of corruption. Nonetheless, Snyder finished his term and appeared to be popular with the public and his county in newspaper reports. His political allies, especially back home, often hit back at these attacks. âAttacks Indicate Snyderâs Strengthâ read one story from the Pottsville Republican on March 18, 1922.\n\nWhen his term as Treasurer expired in 1924, Snyder attempted to regain his state Senate seat in that yearâs election. He was unsuccessful, marking a rare political loss.\n\nLater Years & Death\n\nAfter leaving office as Treasurer, Snyder was appointed as a Special Deputy in the Auditor Generalâs Office during 1925 and 1926. After this term expired, Snyder ended up almost right where he started years ago, as the elected District Attorney of Schuylkill County. Reelected in 1931, he was one day away from being sworn in for a second term as District Attorney when he died on December 7, 1931, in Pottsville.\n\nSnyder was buried at Charles Baber Cemetery in that town, and upon his death, Governor Gifford Pinchot remarked in the Harrisburg Independent that a âno more vital and colorful figure has existed in my time in Pennsylvania politics.â\n\nSamuel Lewis\n\nEarly Life & Career\n\nSamuel Smyser Lewis was born on February 17, 1874, in York, Pennsylvania, as one of six children to Melchinger Lewis and Justina Maul. His parents were both born in York County, and his father was a machinist. A brother, Robert J. Lewis, was a lawyer, school controller of York, city solicitor, and eventual United States Congressman, from 1901 to 1903.\n\nLewis was educated in the county schools and attended Muhlenberg College; around this time, he also held a military rank. After graduating from Muhlenberg, he passed the Bar in York County and became a practicing lawyer. In the years following, Lewis was appointed Postmaster of York, Pennsylvania, in 1906 (a position he held until 1914), President of the State Association of Postmasters, and also worked for Congressman Daniel Lafean. In 1904, he was elected as an Alternate Delegate from Pennsylvania to the Republican National Convention. With time, he became the boss of York County Republican politics.\n\nOn April 27, 1911, Lewis married Miriam Frazer in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The couple had three children together, including two daughters who lived to adulthood.\n\nPolitical Involvement & Eventual Run for Treasurer\n\nOn April 28, 1911, the Carlisle Evening Herald published the following about Lewis and his career. âMr. Lewis is the postmaster at York and one of the most prominent men of his city and county. He has been President of the State Association of Postmasters and was for a time identified with one of the important departments at Washington. He is a member of the York County Bar and has been long been the confidante of Congressman Lafean (R-PA); his wide acquaintance throughout the district has given him a considerable influence in Republican party affairs. Mr. Lewis is also connected with several fraternal organizations and is active in Masonic circles, being an officer of the Zembo Temple. He is genial and popular and has many friends in Cumberland.â\n\nAfter establishing himself as a professional and political figure in the York area, Lewis became Assistant Auditor General and continued to be heavily involved in Republican politics. He ran as a Republican for Auditor General of Pennsylvania in 1920, and had the backing of the State Republican organization. The campaign began early that year. âResolutions endorsing Samuel S. Lewis for the Republican Nomination for Auditor General of the state were immediately adopted today by the Executive Committee of the Republican Party in York County,â the York Dispatch wrote on January 5, 1920, â[t]hus formally launching the candidacy of a Yorker for one of the highest offices.â\n\nLewis easily obtained the Republican nomination in the primaries. This is highlighted by The Evening Sun in Hanover, on January 21, 1920: âHarmony Effected In G.O.P. Slate â¦ Philadelphia Papers Report Peace In Republican Ranks With Samuel S. Lewis, York, On Ticket â¦ (he) will be recognized as the candidate for Auditor General.â\n\nLewis faced Democrat Arthur McKean come November, and won by a commanding 600,000 vote majority. After election day, in discussing his widespread political beginnings and connections that led up to his candidacy and victory for Auditor General, the Harrisburg Telegraph published the following on November 3, 1920: âTwo years ago Mr. Lewis organized the county so effectually that he not only trimmed a faction opposing him and won undisputed leadership â¦ it was a great day for the hard-working, square-fighting, level-headed Republican leader of York County who is a state figure now.â\n\nWhile Auditor General, Lewis showed himself knowledgeable in the financial sector, especially the tax code, and also attended social events, gave speeches, and continued to direct York Republican politics.\n\nWith his term expiring in 1925, he decided to launch another campaign, this time for Treasurer, in 1924.
