She married the late Bernard Grossman in 1955, and had three children.

Agency work was demanding, yet Elaine always made sure there was a casserole in the refrigerator ready for her children to heat up for dinner. Instructions began with “remove the aluminum foil and plastic wrap” since the time when it all fused together at one hastily warmed up dinner.\n\nUpon her retirement, Elaine started volunteering at the City Museum; using her art talents to help visitors create rubbings among other activities, and she enjoyed spending time with her family and grandchildren.\n\nAlong the way, her relationship with former in-law, Edmund Bloomquist, deepened into marriage in 1995. Ed helped fix and repair things around her house, and Elaine fixed the dinners. The two shared 23 years together and enjoyed travel, reading, theater, and spending time with family. Ed passed away after a brief illness in January 2019, leaving Elaine with an even emptier nest.\n\nHer children rallied around her with the advent of Covid—delivering groceries, fixing and sharing meals, and carefully arranging visits with family, including a new great-grandson.
