Their daughter Maria Louisa Jenks was born on February 16, 1817 and passed away on July 18, 1817. This lot does not have a lot number.\n\nLot 5 South Side. Josiah A. Young. February 2, 1848 – August 27, 1918.\n\nJosiah was the son of fisherman William Young and Elizabeth Backus Young (Styles). He was the third husband of Susan J. Gardner Francis McGarvey, widow of William R. Francis and Alexander McGarvey, marrying on July 19, 1884. The couple did not have children of their own; however, Susan had two sons from her marriage to Alexander McGarvey Sr., Alexander Jr. and Andrew.\n\nJosiah was fourteen-years old when he enlisted in the U.S. Navy during the Civil War. He served from November 18, 1862, until August 1865 on board ships National Guard, Connecticut, and Rhode Island. After the war, Josiah resided on Pine Street. He was a member of Grand Army of The Republic (GAR), Thomas M. Gardner Post. Josiah recorded his occupations as day laborer and “odd jobs” in the 1900 and 1920 U.S. Federal Censuses. You may view Josiah in “Gathering of Civil War Veterans” in the Nantucket Historical Association collection. Image Number P1574.\n\nLot 5 Charles Albert Selden. October 10, 1870 – February 9, 1949.\n\nBorn on Nantucket, Charles was the older of two children born to Charles Selden Sr. and Lydia Hodges Selden. Charles was a twenty-five-year-old journalist when he married twenty-five-year-old teacher Grace Savage in Medford, Massachusetts, on October 13, 1895. He was the grandson of Captain Sylvester Hodges. In Nantucket Doorways: Thresholds to the Past, Edouard A. Stackpole and Melvin B. Summerfield write that Charles was inspired by his grandfather:\n\n“When I thought of him [Captain Hodges] sailing a seventy-foot brig from Nantucket to the Antarctic Ocean, hunting for seals in the South Shetland Islands with no charts to help him, I never considered any of the tasks which first appeared insurmountable as being impossible.”\n\nCharles graduated from Brown University in 1893 and apprenticed with the Providence Journal. He next worked at the New York Sun and, in 1904, became a correspondent at the New York Evening Post. There, in 1913, he became assistant editor and then editor of the paper. Three years later, Charles became a traveling correspondent for the NewYork Times, and, in 1918, he became the correspondent for the New York Times in Paris and London. Charles also wrote articles for the Ladies Home Journal. He covered events from the sinking of the Titanic to the Versailles Treaty at the end of World War I to the Lorano Treaty, a prelude to World War II. Charles interviewed Mohandas K. Gandhi and reported on the abdication of Edward VIII to marry Bessie Wallis Warfield Spencer Simpson. In 1936, Charles retired to Nantucket to live in his boyhood home on Liberty Street. A February 11, 1949, editorial in the New York Times remembers Charles as a legendary journalist:\n\n[He] was a newspaper man’s ideal of a newspaper man. Whether the matter in hand was the signing of a peace treaty to end a war, the abdication of a king in romantic circumstances, or a mere local happening in our city, he attacked the story with equal zest and gave to it a human quality which was his own, and a distinction which was the envy and admiration of his fellow-craftsmen. His spontaneous curiosity was so disarming that the most reticent became communicative under its spell.\n\nThe Times takes note of their colleagues’ affection for Charles:\n\n. . . His whimsical stories about this town for the Sun and the old Evening Post are legends in NewYork’s newspaper offices, and it was said of him that he never went out on a story that he did not bring back a good one – even if the story he went out on did not pan out, and his point of observation as at the auction of a famous actress’s treasures – was a seat on the curbstone outside.\n\nAs a man and a fellow-workman he was the salt of the earth – with that extra tang of the island of his birth – and his old comrades on all the newspapers he served so well remember him with warm affection.\n\nCharles died on Nantucket at Nantucket Cottage Hospital at the age of seventy-eight.\n\nLot 8 B South Side. Captain Allen Fuller. October 3, 1786 – June 22, 1850.\n\nCaptain Allen Fuller was born in Barnstable, Massachusetts, the son of Zaccheus and Martha Fuller. His first wife was Betsey Smith of Barnstable, Massachusetts. Captain Fuller had two daughters from his first marriage Nancy (b. 1816) and Catharine (b. 1817). He and his second wife Phebe Ellis, had four children. In the 1850 U.S. Federal Census, Captain Fuller recorded his occupation as trader. The Massachusetts Vital Records, 1841-1910 listed Captain Fuller as a merchant. Captain Allen Fuller died of consumption at the age of sixty-two years. Allen Fuller's death was recorded as June 24, 1850, in the Massachusetts Vital Records 1841-1910; however, engraved on his marker is June 22, 1850.\n\nLot 8 B South Side. Phebe Fuller. 1798 – December 12, 1860.\n\nPhebe was born in Sandwich, Massachusetts, the daughter of Benjamin and Susan Ellis. She was Captain Allen Fuller's second wife, and they had four children: Paulina (b. 1820), Phebe (b. 1823), Allen (b. 1829), and Josephena Maria, who died suddenly from \"violent fever\" at three years and four months. Their son Allen married and separated from Captain Nathaniel Fitzgerald's daughter Hannah.\n\nThe widow Phebe lived on the north side of Silver Street, where she had a store in the front section of her home. On the night of November 22, 1860, a neighbor passed the house and noticed that the door was open. It was nine o’clock in the evening.\n\nThe neighbor, concerned that the elderly Phebe was ill entered and found the shop empty. She walked into the living room where she found Phebe Fuller on the ground in a pool of blood. She had been severely beaten her scalp was torn from her head in several places. Her right ear was split, her nose was fractured and her right arm and hand were severely bruised. Next to her body was a bloodied whalebone fid,the instrument used in the assault. Fids were used to separate the strands in rope on whaleships. This fid could have already been in Phebe’s home. After all her late husband was a captain. The money drawer in the shop was open with money in it;\n\nbut there was no way to ascertain if any monies had been taken.\n\nThe neighbor called for help. Captain Nathaniel Fitzgerald (See Lot 139) answered the call and carried Phebe to her couch. Dr. John H. Sherman was summoned. Phebe was alive but unconscious having suffered a severe head injury. She would slip in and out of consciousness for the next two weeks. On November 25, she said, “I cannot live. Let no one follow me to the grave; I am principled against it.” When asked who did this she said Patience Cooper. As she slipped in and out of consciousness, she would give different accounts of the incident. In one account when asked who did this, she named Patience Cooper. In another, she said a white man whom she had never seen before had committed the crime. In yet another version, she gave a detailed description of what Patience Cooper did to her.\n\nPhebe died from her injuries on December 12. Patience Cooper, characterized by Nantucket historian Edouard Stackpole as a mulatto woman, was arrested for the murder of Phebe Fuller. At Patience Cooper's first trial for the murder of Phebe Fuller a witness who stated Phebe Fuller had often mistaken people for other people was not brought into evidence. The jury returned with a guilty verdict. This verdict was appealed, and in 1862, a new trial was ordered. At her second trial, Patience Cooper was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to ten years in the House of Corrections.\n\nPatience began to serve her sentence at the Old Jail. She was able to take in sewing and washing, the jailer would set aside her earnings for her future use.Throughout the two trials, Patience Cooper maintained her innocence. A number of summer visitors took an interest in Patience Cooper among them a Mr. Salom would often speak to her about the crime; he was able to get her to speak about it where others could not. He convinced her to speak with the authorities about the crime. Patience did and swore on a bible that she had no knowledge of the murder. Mr. Salom said one of the criteria before her sentence could be commuted was a full and free confession of guilt. It was on a Sunday in May that Patience made her confession dictated to Mr. Salom. In it, she said she was guilty of causing the death of Mrs. Fuller. She went to see Mrs. Fuller about her bill. They had an argument provoked by Mrs. Fuller using bad language at her. Patience said she struck her in the head several times.When she left the shop Mrs. Fuller was leaning against the counter. When asked what she did next she replied she went directly home through Silver Street and up Pleasant Street. When asked if she washed the blood off Patience replied that there wasn’t any blood on her hands or clothes. She then added that her confession was to ease her mind and that she was sorry for having caused her death. When asked if she had an accomplice she replied no. Patience Cooper served her ten-year sentence and then spent the last years of her life at the asylum where she died on October 29, 1885 at the age of seventy-five.\n\nIsland sentiment was mixed about Patience's confession. Many believed she confessed in order to secure the commutation of her sentence. Others believed she was shielding the guilty party, while others believed in her guilt. Who murdered Phebe Fuller? The story remains a true Nantucket murder mystery.\n\nLot 8 Lewis H. Wendel (Wendell) (Wendall). d. December 16, 1878.\n\nLewis was a genuine Nantucket washashore! He was born in Stettin, Prussia. Lewis was a crew member on the brig Florida that wrecked off Sankaty in 1833. After his rescue, he made Nantucket his home. Lewis married Eunice N. Rogers on October 14, 1834.

Among his customers were the Gas Works Company and the Straw Works, and for forty years, his \"Prussian blue cart\" delivered the mail from the boat to the post office. He organized a benevolent society comprised of sixteen ladies to render aid to the needy.\n\nIn The Island of Nantucket: What It Was and What It Is, Edward K. Godfrey writes of Lewis \"For nearly half a century [Lewis] lived upon the island, highly respected and esteemed by all classes.\"\n\nLot 10 Hon. David Joy. October 18, 1808 - April 5, 1875.\n\nHon.

Mann in 1880, her second husband. Charlotte along with her first husband, the Honorable David Joy, were active in the anti-slavery and temperance movements. Following David's death, Frederick Douglass wrote a letter of condolence to Charlotte:\n\n...happiness to see much of our departed friend. The reports of his noble life and of his benevolent works have reached me from many quarters. Permit me then, in the name of my long enslaved and now emancipated people, Whose cause he made his own -- remembering those who were in bonds as bound with them and in my own name, to bring one laurel to the tomb of this true man and noble benefactor.\n\nFrederick Douglass\n\nCharlotte Austin Joy Mann is also memorialized on her family's monument in the Isaac Austin lot 435.\n\nLot 11 Mount Vernon Clinton \"Mitchy\" Mitchell Ray.

The Lieutenant, divesting himself of his coat and shoes, plunged in after him, in a rolling sea infested with man-eating sharks, and only after considerable difficulty was he himself saved when two miles away from his ship. The poor fellow, whom Lieutenant Ackley so bravely tried to save, was injured by striking the rail of the ship in falling, and, probably thus rendered unconscious, soon sank in the deep to rise no more.”\n\nDouglas-Lithgow also wrote of the interment of Admiral Ackley:\n\n“Admiral Ackley is buried on Nantucket within the sound of the sea he loved, on the island which was the dearest spot of earth to him.”\n\nInscribed on Admiral Ackley's marker: \"HOME IS.
