Lot 5 Charles Albert Selden. October 10, 1870 – February 9, 1949.

Born on Nantucket, Charles was the older of two children born to Charles Selden Sr. and Lydia Hodges Selden. Charles was a twenty-five-year-old journalist when he married twenty-five-year-old teacher Grace Savage in Medford, Massachusetts, on October 13, 1895. He was the grandson of Captain Sylvester Hodges. In Nantucket Doorways: Thresholds to the Past, Edouard A. Stackpole and Melvin B. Summerfield write that Charles was inspired by his grandfather:

“When I thought of him [Captain Hodges] sailing a seventy-foot brig from Nantucket to the Antarctic Ocean, hunting for seals in the South Shetland Islands with no charts to help him, I never considered any of the tasks which first appeared insurmountable as being impossible.”

Charles graduated from Brown University in 1893 and apprenticed with the Providence Journal. He next worked at the New York Sun and, in 1904, became a correspondent at the New York Evening Post. There, in 1913, he became assistant editor and then editor of the paper. Three years later, Charles became a traveling correspondent for the NewYork Times, and, in 1918, he became the correspondent for the New York Times in Paris and London. Charles also wrote articles for the Ladies Home Journal. He covered events from the sinking of the Titanic to the Versailles Treaty at the end of World War I to the Lorano Treaty, a prelude to World War II. Charles interviewed Mohandas K. Gandhi and reported on the abdication of Edward VIII to marry Bessie Wallis Warfield Spencer Simpson. In 1936, Charles retired to Nantucket to live in his boyhood home on Liberty Street. A February 11, 1949, editorial in the New York Times remembers Charles as a legendary journalist:

[He] was a newspaper man’s ideal of a newspaper man. Whether the matter in hand was the signing of a peace treaty to end a war, the abdication of a king in romantic circumstances, or a mere local happening in our city, he attacked the story with equal zest and gave to it a human quality which was his own, and a distinction which was the envy and admiration of his fellow-craftsmen. His spontaneous curiosity was so disarming that the most reticent became communicative under its spell.

The Times takes note of their colleagues’ affection for Charles:

. . . His whimsical stories about this town for the Sun and the old Evening Post are legends in NewYork’s newspaper offices, and it was said of him that he never went out on a story that he did not bring back a good one – even if the story he went out on did not pan out, and his point of observation as at the auction of a famous actress’s treasures – was a seat on the curbstone outside.

As a man and a fellow-workman he was the salt of the earth – with that extra tang of the island of his birth – and his old comrades on all the newspapers he served so well remember him with warm affection.

Charles died on Nantucket at Nantucket Cottage Hospital at the age of seventy-eight.

Lot 8 B South Side. Captain Allen Fuller. October 3, 1786 – June 22, 1850.

Captain Allen Fuller was born in Barnstable, Massachusetts, the son of Zaccheus and Martha Fuller. His first wife was Betsey Smith of Barnstable, Massachusetts. Captain Fuller had two daughters from his first marriage Nancy (b. 1816) and Catharine (b. 1817). He and his second wife Phebe Ellis, had four children. In the 1850 U.S. Federal Census, Captain Fuller recorded his occupation as trader. The Massachusetts Vital Records, 1841-1910 listed Captain Fuller as a merchant. Captain Allen Fuller died of consumption at the age of sixty-two years. Allen Fuller's death was recorded as June 24, 1850, in the Massachusetts Vital Records 1841-1910; however, engraved on his marker is June 22, 1850.

Lot 8 B South Side. Phebe Fuller. 1798 – December 12, 1860.

Phebe was born in Sandwich, Massachusetts, the daughter of Benjamin and Susan Ellis. She was Captain Allen Fuller's second wife, and they had four children: Paulina (b. 1820), Phebe (b. 1823), Allen (b. 1829), and Josephena Maria, who died suddenly from "violent fever" at three years and four months. Their son Allen married and separated from Captain Nathaniel Fitzgerald's daughter Hannah.

The widow Phebe lived on the north side of Silver Street, where she had a store in the front section of her home. On the night of November 22, 1860, a neighbor passed the house and noticed that the door was open. It was nine o’clock in the evening.

The neighbor, concerned that the elderly Phebe was ill entered and found the shop empty. She walked into the living room where she found Phebe Fuller on the ground in a pool of blood. She had been severely beaten her scalp was torn from her head in several places. Her right ear was split, her nose was fractured and her right arm and hand were severely bruised. Next to her body was a bloodied whalebone fid,the instrument used in the assault. Fids were used to separate the strands in rope on whaleships. This fid could have already been in Phebe’s home. After all her late husband was a captain. The money drawer in the shop was open with money in it;

but there was no way to ascertain if any monies had been taken.

The neighbor called for help. Captain Nathaniel Fitzgerald (See Lot 139) answered the call and carried Phebe to her couch. Dr. John H. Sherman was summoned. Phebe was alive but unconscious having suffered a severe head injury. She would slip in and out of consciousness for the next two weeks. On November 25, she said, “I cannot live. Let no one follow me to the grave; I am principled against it.” When asked who did this she said Patience Cooper. As she slipped in and out of consciousness, she would give different accounts of the incident. In one account when asked who did this, she named Patience Cooper. In another, she said a white man whom she had never seen before had committed the crime. In yet another version, she gave a detailed description of what Patience Cooper did to her.

Phebe died from her injuries on December 12. Patience Cooper, characterized by Nantucket historian Edouard Stackpole as a mulatto woman, was arrested for the murder of Phebe Fuller. At Patience Cooper's first trial for the murder of Phebe Fuller a witness who stated Phebe Fuller had often mistaken people for other people was not brought into evidence. The jury returned with a guilty verdict. This verdict was appealed, and in 1862, a new trial was ordered. At her second trial, Patience Cooper was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to ten years in the House of Corrections.

Patience began to serve her sentence at the Old Jail. She was able to take in sewing and washing, the jailer would set aside her earnings for her future use.Throughout the two trials, Patience Cooper maintained her innocence. A number of summer visitors took an interest in Patience Cooper among them a Mr. Salom would often speak to her about the crime; he was able to get her to speak about it where others could not. He convinced her to speak with the authorities about the crime. Patience did and swore on a bible that she had no knowledge of the murder. Mr. Salom said one of the criteria before her sentence could be commuted was a full and free confession of guilt. It was on a Sunday in May that Patience made her confession dictated to Mr. Salom. In it, she said she was guilty of causing the death of Mrs. Fuller. She went to see Mrs. Fuller about her bill. They had an argument provoked by Mrs. Fuller using bad language at her. Patience said she struck her in the head several times.When she left the shop Mrs. Fuller was leaning against the counter. When asked what she did next she replied she went directly home through Silver Street and up Pleasant Street. When asked if she washed the blood off Patience replied that there wasn’t any blood on her hands or clothes. She then added that her confession was to ease her mind and that she was sorry for having caused her death. When asked if she had an accomplice she replied no. Patience Cooper served her ten-year sentence and then spent the last years of her life at the asylum where she died on October 29, 1885 at the age of seventy-five.

Island sentiment was mixed about Patience's confession. Many believed she confessed in order to secure the commutation of her sentence. Others believed she was shielding the guilty party, while others believed in her guilt. Who murdered Phebe Fuller? The story remains a true Nantucket murder mystery.

In Nantucket: A History, Douglas-Lithgow related an event illustrating Ackley’s valor:

“It is not generally known, nor is it recorded in the files of the Navy Department, that Admiral Ackley, when a lieutenant, nobly risked his life, in 1873, in trying to save a seaman who had fallen overboard from his ship, the Omaha. The Lieutenant, divesting himself of his coat and shoes, plunged in after him, in a rolling sea infested with man-eating sharks, and only after considerable difficulty was he himself saved when two miles away from his ship. The poor fellow, whom Lieutenant Ackley so bravely tried to save, was injured by striking the rail of the ship in falling, and, probably thus rendered unconscious, soon sank in the deep to rise no more.”

Douglas-Lithgow also wrote of the interment of Admiral Ackley:

“Admiral Ackley is buried on Nantucket within the sound of the sea he loved, on the island which was the dearest spot of earth to him.”

resulting in the murders of the Captain, first mate, second mate and third mate occurred. Samuel Comstock,

who then sailed the Globe to the Mulgrave Islands, led the mutiny. Six crew members escaped, who later giving depositions to the U.S. Consul at Valparaiso, Chile, cut the lines and sailed to Chile leaving the other seamen behind. Comstock was shot by his accomplices, for giving clothes and other items to the natives, before the items had been divided. When the schooner Dolphin arrived at the islands and found William Lay and Cyrus Hussey, the only survivors, the others, including Roland Coffin having been killed by the natives.

Gorham Coffin, one of the owners of the Globe and Roland's uncle was outraged at the accounts in the depositions implying Roland was suspected of having knowledge of the mutiny, and was an informant to Comstock about the crew after the mutiny. He wrote to Secretary of State John Quincy Adams "not wishing to extenuate his fault, if guilty,

but to prevent if possible that aught may be set down in malice." He also wrote to Secretary of the Navy Samuel L.

Southard "while justice is stern, may not her sister virtue, mercy, be awed into silence, but be ready to extend her

shield, over those who have been forced to yield to necessity, with a drawn sword over their heads." Having this

letter forwarded to Commodore Hull and writing to Daniel Webster with the argument in Roland's defense as the

the crew was jealous of Roland due to his hard work and being related to owners of the ship.

NANTUCKET

Just a sandy wind-swept island!

What more would you have it be,

With a turquoise sky above it,

Around it a sapphire sea?

When its dawns are pearl and opal,

Its noons are crystal clear,

And its sunsets shower down gold dust

Till the diamond stars appear --

When to those who are born on the island,

And to many from over the sea,

‘Tis fairer then all its jewels,

What more does it need to be?

Molly served as secretary to the Volunteer Aid Society of Nantucket. This organization was a branch of the Volunteer Air of Massachusetts serving to raise money and collect clothing for soldiers in the Spanish-American War. She resided at 8 Pleasant Street.

The hearth-fire of course was out.

When toward the end of her life, Mother told me the story, it seemed to me a trifle out of the ordinary for a girl to receive a caller before daylight, and in a freezing room, too; but I let that pass. When the story was told, I did exclaim, "But surely you couldn't engage yourself to marry a man after seeing him only three times!" "Well" said Mother serenely "I told him he might come back!"

In silence let them flow

For him whose heart hath beat

In unison with you!
