Commenting on the results, Wale Tinubu, Group Chief Executive, Oando PLC said:

“Despite the persistent pipeline vandalism across the Niger Delta, which continues to dampen crude production, we achieved a profit after tax of N 74.7 billion in 2023 largely driven by increased trading volumes due to our strategic global partnerships and net foreign exchange gains on the group’s foreign currency denominated assets as against losses on our foreign currency denominated liabilities. Furthermore, our milestone signing of the Sale and Purchase Agreement with Eni towards the acquisition of 100% of the shares of NAOC Ltd, marked a pivotal moment for our organization and is poised to unlock substantial synergies in the near future. Our focus is now on completing the acquisition and seamlessly integrating operations to deliver exceptional value to our shareholders”

Revenue

Revenue for the period increased by 71%, positively impacted by significant increase in our trading activity and exchange rate translations, despite lower oil, gas and NGL production volumes and realized prices.

Operating Profit

Operating Profit for the period increased by 924% primarily driven by the above-mentioned increase in revenue, as well as a significant increase in other operating income largely because of foreign exchange gains on the group’s US dollar denominated monetary assets despite an increase in admin expenses primarily from exchange losses from the impact of the Naira devaluation on our foreign currency denominated liabilities.

Profit-After-Tax

The above factors resulted in a Profit after Tax position of N74.7billion in 2023, despite a 35% increase in net finance costs due to an increase in interest rates on several of our major facilities in line with increases in global interest rates.

Ends.
