Oando Energy Resources is a leading African exploration and production company. An independent oil and gas company with world-class operations, we are at the cutting edge of Africa’s upstream sector, with significant investments in a robust portfolio of oil and gas fields, as well as participating interests in onshore and offshore producing assets.

Our extensive asset base covers exploration, development, and production assets for both oil and gas, situated on and offshore in Nigeria, and the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of São Tomé and Príncipe.

Through our extensive local operating capabilities, we have partnerships with both indigenous and international oil companies, and we hold interests in 14 licenses for the exploration, development, and production of oil and gas assets located onshore, swamp, and offshore.

We deliver sustainable value to our stakeholders as we continually grow our reserves by harnessing the optimum potential from our existing range of oil and gas resources, while also acquiring near-term producing assets from international oil companies.

Alongside seasoned professionals who join us from a wide range of multinational companies, we nurture talented young individuals through a challenging accelerated training and exposure programme.

We are also committed to actively contributing to the socio-economic development of communities where we operate by creating jobs and increasing local capacity. Through a systematic implementation of our Environmental Health and Safety Management System, we ensure that our operations within these communities are safe, environmentally friendly, and socially responsible.
