        "text": "Business is open in Africa. The former “hopeless” continent is thriving with trade and investment opportunities; Africa has seen increased Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and its major companies are also divesting business operations overseas. African companies going global have reached unprecedented heights in recent years. These companies ‘overseas expansion’ is characterised by their diversity in terms of industries and geography. And the phenomenon is set to continue this year and beyond. African companies that have been successful in their expansion strategy include: SABMiller, MTN, Naspers, BHP Billiton, Richemont, Sasol, Shoprite, Airtel Africa, Dangote Group, Oando and Capitec amongst others. In this article, we take a look at a couple of African businesses going global in 2013 and how successful it has been.\n\nSABMILLER\n\nFor more than a decade World No.2 brewer SABMiller, which was launched in Johannesburg, South Africa, more than 150 years ago, has been on a drive to become a global player through making multi-billion rand acquisitions throughout the world. It has since become the world’s second biggest brewer after the US’s Anhauser Busch.\n\nLast year, SABMiller and Anadolu Efes completed the transaction to form a strategic alliance for Turkey, Russia, the CIS, Central Asia and the Middle East. The deal was originally announced on 19 October 2011. SABMiller now has a 24 percent equity interest in Anadolu Efes, which is listed on the Istanbul Stock Exchange.

The proceeds from the Rights issue will be used for the part-repayment of 60 billon naira ($384 million) syndicated loan used to fund the acquisition of upstream assets and swamp drilling rigs. Also, it will be used for the part-financing of acquisition of upstream and midstream assets by Oando’s Upstream subsidiary, Oando Energy Resources as well as investment in working capital to support increased level of business.\n\nIn December 2012, Nigeria’s leading indigenous energy group announced that its affiliate, Oando Energy Resources (OER), entered into agreements with ConocoPhillips (COP) to acquire its entire business interests in Nigeria for an estimated $1.79 billion including customary adjustments.
