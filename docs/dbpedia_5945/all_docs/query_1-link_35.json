        "text": "Oando\n\nWednesday, March 7, 2007\n\nWith the support of Alliance Oil Producing Nigeria Ltd., Oando Exploration & Production Ltd., (OEPL), and its Local Content Vehicle (LCV) partner, Arc Oil & Gas, has signed a Joint Operating Agreement (JOA) with Nigerian Agip Oil Co. on OPL 282.\n\nOEPL is a subsidiary of Oando Plc, Nigeria’s integrated energy solutions provider which runs a number of operations across West Africa.\n\nOando, as part of the LCV, has a 40% interest in Alliance Oil Producing Nigeria Ltd., which corresponds to a 4% non-operating interest in the block, while Nigerian Agip Oil Co. has a 90% stake and is the operator of the block. The signing of the JOA truly serves the purpose of the government to allow local companies to participate in the upstream industry.\n\nA PSC has also been signed between NNPC, the Nigerian Agip Oil Co., and Alliance Oil Producing Nigeria Ltd.\n\nMr. Eamon Labode Akinosho, managing director of OEPL, after signing the agreements commented, “As an indigenous exploration and production company, the experience of working with Agip will have tremendous benefits for future growth of our operations.”\n\nCurrently, OEPL has a 45% non-operating stake in OML 56, the Obodugwa-Obodeti Marginal Oil Field, as well as a 60% operating interest in OPL 278.\n\n« GO BACK\n\nYou may also like"
