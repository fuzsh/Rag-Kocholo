        "text": "There are many benefits to renewable energy.\n\nRenewable energy is a clean, inexhaustible alternative to fossil fuels, which contribute to a significant portion of greenhouse gases worldwide. But despite the industry’s advantages, many people have overlooked the safety repercussions for field workers.\n\nThese are the most significant safety concerns for employees who work in renewable energy:\n\nWork Safety: Renewable Energy vs. Fossil Fuels\n\nWhat’s the difference between the safety risks in the renewable energy and fossil fuel sectors? It’s important to note that each industry has similar concerns, which are mainly fall hazards and electrical currents. Further, confined spaces in power plants and other workspaces are risks.\n\nEach sector also presents unique challenges. Those who work in the coal industry won’t always encounter the same challenges as workers in the solar industry. These environments involve different processes. That’s why coal’s mortality rate per terawatt-hour is higher than solar’s by a large margin.\n\nBut even though the renewable energy sector may be safer, workers can still face occupational threats daily.\n\nCommon Hazards in the Renewable Energy Industry\n\nThe hazards renewable energy workers encounter are often universal issues that people in similar fields experience. That said, clean power alternatives, like wind, have specific challenges that increase safety risks for operators and mechanics. This industry isn’t immune to threats.\n\nHere are a few to consider:\n\n1. Machinery Misuse\n\nBetween geothermal pumps and wind turbines, renewable energy features unique equipment and tools. For example, solar energy requires an array of photovoltaic modules to source power, so workers must know how to install them. This task requires specific knowledge.\n\nAnyone who misuses machinery can expose themselves to safety risks. That’s true in any field — but especially in ones that involve specialized components. Otherwise, workers can fall victim to thermal burns, toxic chemicals and more.\n\n2. Fall Hazards\n\nThose in the renewable energy sector are as prone to falls as workers who deal with fossil fuels. Take wind power as an example. It has the most job growth in clean energy* alongside solar power. However, wind may also be the most dangerous sector regarding falls."
