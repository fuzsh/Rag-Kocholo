As an African independent, Oando PLC’s sponsorship and partnership speaks to the caliber of the conference – taking place in Cape Town from November 4-8 – as a premier event for the African oil and gas industry.\n\nOando PLC company signed an $800 million loan document with pan-African financial institution the African Export-Import Bank in November last year to facilitate the acquisition of 100% of the shares of exploration and production company the Nigerian Agip Oil Company. The transaction will see Oando PLC’s participation interest in OML 60, 61, 62 and 63 – situated in the northern Niger Delta – increase from 20% to 40%. During AEW 2024: Invest in African Energy, the company will outline how this strategic acquisition supports the company’s growth objectives in Africa.\n\nAEW: Invest in African Energy is the platform of choice for project operators, financiers, technology providers and government, and has emerged as the official place to sign deals in African energy.
