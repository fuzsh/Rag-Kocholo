        "text": "CALGARY, Alberta, April 24, 2013 /PRNewswire/ --\n\nOando Energy Resources Inc. (\"OER\" or the \"Company\") (TSX: OER), a company focused on oil exploration and production in Nigeria, today announced that the damaged Kwale-Akri pipeline, which connects OER's Ebendo field (OML 56) to the Brass export terminal, has been fully repaired. Full production from the Ebendo field of 3,200 bopd (1,400 bopd net to OER) has resumed.\n\n\"Re-establishing full integrity of the Kwale-Akri pipeline is an important development for OER,\" said Pade Durotoye, CEO of Oando Energy Resources. \"Not only are we able to re-commence our existing production volumes, but we are also able to support our 2013 Ebendo drilling campaign with sufficient takeaway capacity. We also continue to make good progress with the establishment of an alternative pipeline that will further support development of this field.\"\n\nOn November 12, 2012, production from the Ebendo field was shut-in as a result of required repairs and maintenance on the 10 inch Kwale-Akri oil delivery pipeline that is operated by Nigerian Agip Oil Company Limited (\"NAOC\"). A partial resumption of production from the Ebendo field commenced on December 27, 2012, however, a requirement for further repairs resulted in another production shut-in from February 13, 2012 until the date hereof.\n\nAbout Oando Energy Resources Inc. (OER)\n\nOER currently has a broad suite of producing, development and exploration properties in the Gulf of Guinea (predominantly in Nigeria) with current production of approximately 4,300 barrels of oil per day from the Abo Field in OML 125 and the Ebendo Field in OML56. OER has been specifically structured to take advantage of current opportunities for indigenous companies in Nigeria, which currently has the largest population in Africa, and one of the largest oil and gas resources in Africa.\n\nForward Looking Statements:\n\nThis news release contains forward-looking statements and forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws.
