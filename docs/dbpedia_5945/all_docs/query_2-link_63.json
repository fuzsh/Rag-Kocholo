        "text": "Part of downtown Orlando’s Parramore District, the Kia Center is the first NBA facility to earn a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) new construction certification from the U.S. Green Building Council. Home to the Orlando Magic, Orlando Solar Bears and Orlando Predators, and host to a wide range of concerts and special events, the venue uses 20% less energy and 40% less water than arenas of similar size.\n\nThe Kia Center’s eco-friendly features include preferred parking for hybrids and other energy-efficient vehicles, high-efficiency heating and cooling systems, ultra-low-flow toilets, a reflective and insulated roof that reduces cooling costs, high-tech monitoring systems that shut off the lights when a room is empty, bicycle racks, showers and changing rooms for workers who bike to work, systems to treat storm runoff before it can pollute nearby lakes, and recycling bins for fans and concertgoers.\n\nLocated east of Orlando in Christmas, Orlando Wetlands Park is one the largest man-made wetlands in the world. The structure was designed with a hydraulic capacity of 35 million gallons per day of reclaimed wastewater.\n\nThe water is transported through a 4-foot diameter pipeline for approximately 17 miles to the influent distribution structure of the wetlands. Seventeen cells and three distinct wetland ecosystems were created to remove residual amounts of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, from the reclaimed water.\n\nThese ecological communities include deep marsh areas, mixed marsh, wet prairie and hardwood cypress swamps. The site added 2.3 million aquatic plants, including 200,000 trees, to build these thriving environments. The reclaimed water meanders through the various habitats and eventually arrives at the two outfall structures for the wetland system. The flow leaves the Orlando Wetlands Park via a canal and flows into the St. Johns River.\n\nOrange County was awarded a $20 million grant to create Local Alternative Mobility Network (LAMN) in Tavistock Group’s Lake Nona community in the City of Orlando. The BUILD grant is going toward creating new and modifying existing infrastructure in Lake Nona, including multi-modal corridors with autonomous vehicle lanes, bicycle and pedestrian pathways, an integrated and multi-use mobility hub, and support for autonomous vehicles (AV), which have already been deployed as the Beep shuttle service.\n\nOrlando is an ideal place to test autonomous vehicles because it provides a range of weather conditions, it’s home to many tech universities that provide talent, and the state of Florida has favorable regulation for self-driving cars. No wonder we’re home to Luminar, which designs lasers and sensors for self-driving cars to navigate roads. Also of note, the SunTrax test facility is a 2.25-mile track designed to test high-speed travel.\n\nConstruction and expansions at Orlando International Airport (MCO) and Port Canaveral, as well as expansions to passenger rail, continue to increase the number of sustainable transportation options in the region.\n\nMayor Buddy Dyer assembled the city’s first Office of Sustainability and Resilience to implement the Green Works Orlando initiative by coordinating with city departments and community stakeholders to ensure the effectiveness of immediate and long-term sustainability planning efforts. Some of the earlier successes of Green Works Orlando included the development of a “Sustainability” chapter in the city’s Municipal Code.\n\nThe Green Works Municipal Operations Sustainability Action Plan was adopted in 2012 and focused on municipal operation actions that the city and its employees could take to ensure that Orlando is leading by example across each key area of sustainability practices. The 2012 Municipal Plan identified 12 goals and more than 100 strategies for achieving them. In January 2017, the city published a Municipal Plan Progress Report, which detailed the city’s advancements toward its goals and the associated benchmarks, identified areas that need additional resources, and also added a focus on resiliency.\n\nFollowing the adoption of the Municipal Plan, the city prepared a Community Sustainability Action Plan in 2013 and released the most recent version in 2018. Through an extensive engagement and collaboration process with community representatives, the Community Sustainability Action Plan has served as a roadmap, including ambitious goals, strategies, and reporting targets and metrics, to help guide Orlando to become one of the most sustainable U.S. cities by 2040.\n\nTo date, the city has implemented various programs and policies that support residents and businesses in making their homes and communities more sustainable.\n\nOrlando has begun powering city facilities through onsite solar installations and subscribing over 50 facilities to community solar. These include all city parks and neighborhood centers, 17 fire stations, the Orlando Police Department, and City Hall.\n\nThrough the 2030 Solar Pledge, the city is committed to powering its facilities with 100% solar power within the next decade. We have also partnered with Solar United Neighbors (SUN) to offer an annual purchasing cooperative to make it easy and more affordable for residents to go solar.\n\nAs a result of these efforts, Orlando was recognized for achieving the LEED for Cities Gold certification for its citywide sustainability and resiliency efforts, the highest level of performance for any city in the Southeast United States, as well as an EPA Green Power Partner for its growing use of renewable energy.\n\nOur city was approved for a $17.5 million green bond to implement energy efficiency retrofits to 55 city buildings, which saves over 23% energy use and up to $2.5 million per year. Orlando also enabled more than $500 million for Property Assessed Clean Energy (PACE), an innovative program that provides financing for energy efficiency upgrades and solar installations.\n\nWe’re proud to be the first city in Florida to pass a Building Energy and Water Efficiency Strategy (BEWES) ordinance to drive energy and water efficiency in the city’s largest buildings. And we’ve committed to meeting Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver or higher standards for all newly constructed city buildings.\n\nWith a goal of providing safe, comfortable and convenient access for all users, Orlando has adopted a Complete Streets policy. As part of that initiative, we’ve expanded bicycling infrastructure with a total of 250.5 miles of on-street bike lanes and 36.2 off-street bike trails.\n\nOrlando has also implemented electric bike and scooter share programs that resulted in 1,241,609 trips for a total of 1,293,383 miles between January 2020 and January 2022. We’ve partnered with LYNX to convert LYMMO downtown circulator fleet vehicles to zero-emission electric buses, with eight buses in operation currently.\n\nYou will also find more than 100 new electric vehicle charging stations in city parks, neighborhood centers, parking garages and public venues. And we’re committed to converting 100% of the city fleet to electric or alternative-fueled vehicles by 2030.\n\n• US DOE Better Buildings Challenge: 20% reduction of energy use in city buildings by 2021.\n\n• Energy Secure Cities Coalition: Transition city fleet and public transit vehicles to 100% electric and alternative fuels by 2030.\n\n• Ready for 100: Transition city electric grid to 100% renewable energy for municipal ops (2030) and city-wide (2050).\n\n• Global Compact of Mayors for Climate & Energy: Commitment to measure, track and reduce our greenhouse gas emissions in alignment with the Paris Climate Agreement.\n\n• Under2 MOU / We Are Still In / America Is All In: Official sub-national agreement commits to aligning with the Paris Climate Agreement of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n• Climate Emergency Declaration: Official recognition of the climate crisis as an emergency.\n\n• Beyond 34 Initiative: Commitment to move to zero waste community by 2040.\n\n• Building Energy & Water Efficiency Strategy (BEWES): Commitment to measure and track the energy and water performance of city buildings annually.\n\n• Clean Energy for Low-Income Communities Accelerator (CELICA): Working to develop action plan to increase the adoption of clean energy in low-income communities.\n\n• NWF Wildlife Habitat Certification: Create or restore wildlife habitat in the community and do education and outreach.\n\n• Mayor’s Monarch Pledge: Committing to both restore habitat in the community and encourage citizens to do the same.\n\n• Cities With Nature: A partnership with TNC and ICLEI to begin addressing the natural and built environments.\n\n• Net-Zero Carbon by 2050: OUC’s announcement of the EIRP underscores our goal to achieve net-zero carbon emissions citywide by 2050.\n\n• 100% Electric Lymmo Bus System by 2025: In collaboration with OUC and LYNX, the city has committed to transitioning the downtown Lymmo BRT to 100% zero-emission electric by 2025.\n\n• Race to Zero: An evolution to our Under2 MOU, Ready for 100, GCoM, ICLEI, CDP and other climate commitments.
