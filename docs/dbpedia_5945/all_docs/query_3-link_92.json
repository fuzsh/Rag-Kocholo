        "text": "Total Energy Consumption\n\nConsumption per capita was 0.8 toe in 2022 (more than 40% higher than the average for Sub-Saharan Africa). Electricity consumption per capita is relatively low in comparison to neighbouring countries and reached 120 kWh/hab in 2022 (2.8 times lower than the average for Sub-Saharan Africa).\n\nSince 2012, total consumption has increased at an average of 1.7%/year to 168 Mtoe in 2022.\n\nInteractive Chart Nigeria Total Energy Consumption\n\nCrude Oil Production\n\nOil production is falling due to declining investments, unplanned outages due to aging infrastructure and poor maintenance, crude oil theft, and pipeline sabotage. Since 2010, it has halved (-52% or -6%/year) to 61 Mt in 2022. The output is a third lower than the Nigeria's OPEC quota for 2022 (88 Mt). In 2022, Nigeria lost its place as the largest African oil producer, surpassed by Algeria (65 Mt). Its oil production remains higher than those of Angola (55 Mt) and Libya (54 Mt).\n\nThe country is promoting the exploitation of fields located in the deep and very deep offshore.\n\nInteractive Chart Nigeria Crude Oil Production\n\nOil Products Consumption\n\nSince 2014, oil product consumption has been relatively stable, at around 20 Mt/year. Previously, it rose by 17%/year between 2009 and 2014.\n\nTransport is the main consuming sector, accounting for 90% of total oil product consumption (77% in 2010), followed by residential and services (6% in 2022, compared to 15% in 2010).\n\nGraph: OIL CONSUMPTION (Mt)\n\nGraph: OIL CONSUMPTION BREAKDOWN BY SECTOR (2022, %)\n\nInteractive Chart Nigeria Refined Oil Products Production\n\nNatural Gas Consumption\n\nGas consumption remained stable in 2022, at 22 bcm, after a rapid increase between 2009 and 2021 (by around 7%/year, including +8% in 2021).\n\nThe industry sector absorbed 38% of gas consumption in 2022 (up from 14% in 2010); 34% is used for power generation (48% in 2010) and 28% for the oil and gas sector (\"others\", 38% in 2010).\n\nGraph: NATURAL GAS CONSUMPTION (bcm)\n\nGraph: GAS CONSUMPTION BREAKDOWN BY SECTOR (2022, %)\n\nInteractive Chart Nigeria Natural Gas Domestic Consumption\n\nCoal Consumption\n\nCoal consumption is marginal (less than 0.1 Mt in 2022) and is exclusively used in the industry sector.\n\nGraph: COAL CONSUMPTION (Mt)\n\nGraph: COAL CONSUMPTION BREAKDOWN BY SECTOR (2022, %)\n\nInteractive Chart Nigeria Coal and Lignite Domestic Consumption\n\nPower Consumption\n\nElectricity demand fell by 7% in 2022 to 26.5 TWh. Previously, electricity consumption showed much slower growth than before, following the fall in economic growth with 3%/year over 2013-2021, compared to around 9%/year between 2000 and 2012).\n\nGraph: ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION (TWh)\n\nRenewable in % Electricity Production\n\nIn the ETP (2022), renewables are expected to account for 40% of capacity in 2030, totalling 17 GW (2.1 GW in 2022), and 96% in 2050 with 248 GW. The power sector should reach carbon neutrality by 2050.\n\nThe National Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Policy (2022) includes a \"30:30:30\" scheme that plans to add 30 GW of power capacity by 2030, with renewables contributing 30% of the country's energy mix.\n\nInteractive Chart Nigeria Share of Renewables in Electricity Production (incl hydro)\n\nCO2 Fuel Combustion/CO2 Emissions\n\nThe updated NDC (2021) set an unconditional GHG emission reduction target of 20% below a BAU scenario by 2030 and a conditional target with international support up to 47% (i.e. a level of 244 MtCO2eq for the conditional target compared to a BAU level of 453 MtCO2eq). In addition, Nigeria pledged to reach net-zero emissions by 2060."
