        "text": "Hello! I’m Lisa and I follow environmental policy for The Times. There was a big win for fossil fuels this week, so the newsletter team invited me in to talk about what Big Oil is thinking and what we might expect from the industry going forward.\n\nTo sum it up, confidence is high in the oil and gas world. That’s very different from where we were just a couple of years ago and it has important implications for the global transition to cleaner energy.\n\nA huge decision on Alaska\n\nYou might have read my articles over the past few days about the Willow project in Alaska. That’s an $8 billion plan to extract 600 million barrels of oil from the largest remaining expanse of wilderness in the United States. President Biden approved Willow on Monday, much to the displeasure of environmentalists.\n\nWhen he did, he also enacted some new protections designed to limit fallout in the drilling area, which lies about 200 miles north of the Arctic Circle. They included a ban on offshore drilling in the Arctic Ocean and safeguards for some nearby wetlands.\n\nHow did the oil industry react? In a sign of that newly restored swagger, rather than just taking the tremendous victory of Willow and laying low, executives generally made a point of criticizing the new environmental protections.\n\n“In the current energy crisis, the Biden administration should be focused on strengthening U.S. energy security and standing with the working families of Alaska by supporting the responsible development of federal lands and waters, not acting to restrict it,” said Frank Macchiarola, a senior vice president at the American Petroleum Institute, a trade organization.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
