Inspiring energy New strategic advances Chairman’s statement Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 24 The year 2013 commenced brightly with an oversubscribed N54.6 billion Rights Issue exercise which concluded in February. The success of the Rights Issue re-affirms investor’s belief in our strategy of growing our higher-margin upstream business, whilst also optimizing our balance sheet. The rewards are at the cusp of being reaped as our upstream business, Oando Energy Resources, has today emerged as Nigeria’s leading indigenous hydrocarbon producer. In the Upstream division, OER has made significant progress in organic development with successful drilling campaigns during the course of the year. Production from the Abo field within OML 125 averaged 3,321 bbl/d light oil (net Working Interest) in 2013 as we successfully drilled 3 wells to maintain production levels. Significant progress was made in the construction of an alternative 45,000 bbls/d, 51km pipeline which will provide another evacuation route through the Trans Forcados export pipeline; completion is expected before the end of 2014. In addition to this, two wells were drilled – Ebendo 5 and 6 as we grew our oil production within OML 56. We continue to make significant progress in bringing the Akepo and Qua Ibo fields into first oil. Corporate Governance\n\n25.

The INTEGRITY rig celebrated 4 years without Lost Time to Injury (LTI), signifying our commitment to world class operating standards, with the proactive use of our EHSSQ and operational processes. In the midstream division, we commissioned the Alausa Independent Power Plant in Q4 2013, thus growing our power generation capacity by 22.5MW, and expected contributions of N1.2 billion in annual EBITDA. We also successfully commissioned a 5 mmscf/day Compressed Natural Gas facility which will act as a precursor for gas customers pending the construction of the GL4 pipeline expansion in Lagos; this pipeline expansion will increase the pipeline’s overall capacity by 30mmscf/day. These recent developments prove that despite the strategic sale of our 128km pipeline in Southern Nigeria, our gas and power business continues to grow and contributes significantly to the Group’s overall performance. As downstream players continue to battle delayed subsidy payments from the Federal Government, we are being proactive in creating value as we explore efficient channels to increase our margins and add value to the sector, with the completion of our subsea Apapa jetty. This will contribute to our net profit through tolling fees and will result in substantial cost savings on imports. We are also focusing on increasing our product diversity and geography across Africa, with supplies into new markets and countries. The year 2014 is beginning to reap the rewards of the strategic initiatives employed in the preceding year. We have successfully cemented our leading status as Nigeria’s premier indigenous E&P player, whilst also growing the midstream business and re-focusing the pioneer downstream business. In a challenging operating environment, evolution remains paramount and we still continue to work diligently to stay ahead of our peers, whilst creating value to our esteemed shareholders. Thank you HRM Oba Michael A. Gbadebo, CFR Chairman We are being proactive in creating value as we explore efficient channels to increase our margins and add value to the sector, with the completion of our subsea Apapa jetty. 3.9kboed daily production\n\n26.

Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 34 The Company has successfully built a vast portfolio of oil and gas assets in selected African basins in partnership with both Nigerian and Multinational companies. OER holds interests in 10 licenses for the exploration, development and production of oil and gas assets located onshore, swamp, and offshore. The Company has strategically focused its growth on organic means through the optimisation of its existing portfolio, developing proven but undeveloped assets; and inorganic means, through governmental bid rounds in Africa as well as acquiring unutilized near-term production assets from International Oil Companies during divestment programmes. 2013 Economic Review: Global primary energy consumption increased by 2.3% in 2013, compared to 1.8% in 2012, with growth accelerations for oil, coal, and nuclear power. However, global growth remained below the 10- year average of 2.5%. Growth was below average for all regions except North America. Oil remains the world’s leading fuel, with 32.9% of global energy consumption. Emerging markets continued to provide a large proportion of the world’s crude oil demand growth, with demand for the first quarter of 2013 up 1.4 mb/d on the previous year. Emerging markets accounted for 80% of the increase in global energy consumption. The EIA forecasted non-OECD oil demand exceeding that of OECD nations for the first time in April 2013.

Inspiring energy New strategic advances OER 2013 asset profiles Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 36 Background Oando Energy Resources (“OER”) owns a 15% participating interest in OML125, which it acquired in 2008 from Nigeria Agip Exploration (“NAE”). The block is operated by NAE and located in Nigeria’s deep offshore segment with an acreage size of 1,983 km2. Production from the Abo field within OML 125 averaged 3,321 bbl/d light oil (net WI) in 2013, as against 3,473 bbl/d, representing an 11% decline compared to the previous year. The OER total production attributable for its interest was 1.21 mmbbls. The Abo field produces through a floating production, storage and offloading (“FPSO”) vessel with oil capacity of 40,000 bbls/d, gas production capacity of 114 MMscf/d and a water production capacity of 9 Mbbl/d. The FPSO also has capacity to re-inject up to 30 Mbbls/d of water and 12 MMscf/d of gas and a total storage capacity of 993,000 bbls. Capital Projects During Q1, 2013, NAE, together with the Company, completed the work-over of the Abo 9 well that started in 2012. Abo 9 is a gas injection well that will provide pressure support for the Anom01 and Anom02 producing reservoirs. Gas injection is due to commence in 2014. The Abo Phase 3 development commenced in January 2013 with the side track of Abo 4 well. Abo 4 was drilled and completed in Q2, 2013 on the B207 reservoir. Abo 4 ST was producing light oil at a rate of 1,380 bbls/d (gross, WI) on December 31, 2013. In June 2013, an up-dip side track of the Abo 3 well on the B200 reservoir was completed, which only flowed for 72 hours (approximately) during testing before production ceased. Production ceased due to sand blockage in the flow line to the Abo FPSO. OER expects production to re-commence from Abo 3 ST in 2014, on clearance of the sand blockage in the flow line. Lastly, the Abo 8 well was completed as an oil producer on the Anom01 and Anom02 reservoirs. Production has not yet commenced from the Abo 8 well as the required flow line is a long lead item, delivery of which is expected to be Q3, 2014. Budgeted Capital Expenditure The capital expenditure budget represents the estimated level of required funding to support the planned growth, development and maintenance of the oil and gas field. The following expenditures are budgeted for 2014 and beyond: • As noted above, additional capital expenditure is required prior to commencing production from Abo 8. As such, budgeted expenditure of US$5.1 million has been agreed to fund the purchase of the flow line. This expenditure was initially expected to be incurred in 2013. However, due to long lead times, this expenditure has been delayed and is now expected to be completed by Q3, 2014. • The capital expenditure budget includes US$7.5 million to be spent on the initial drilling of the Abo 12 well. Abo 12 is a development well with an exploration tail. The well is expected to be drilled during Q2, 2014 and is planned to further drain the Anom02 reservoir and explore the shallow A197 reservoir and the deeper Anom3 reservoir. • The capital expenditure budget also includes an additional US$19 million to fund the completion of both the Abo 8 and Abo 12 wells and US$5.9 million to extend the life of the existing FPSO unit. Both capital projects are expected to be completed by year end 2014. • Until the re-processed seismic data for OML 125 has been reviewed by NAE, and prospectively re-assessed, there are no further plans to drill exploration wells on any of the other prospects in OML 125.

Strategic Report Business Review Corporate Governance Corporate Responsibility Financial Statements Supplementary Information Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 37 Background OER owns a 15% participating interest in OML 134, which it acquired in 2008 from NAE. The block is in the exploration phase and is operated by NAE. The block is located in Nigeria’s deep offshore segment with an acreage size of 1,132 km2. Water depths for OML 134 range from 550m to 1,100m. Capital Projects OER acquired seismic data in 2010 and the processing of this data was completed in Q4, 2012. Based on the results of the seismic interpretation, an exploration well was drilled into the Minidiogboro prospect in Q4, 2013. A number of shallow (H245, H310, H350, H355) and intermediate (H520, H522, H524) sands were targeted by the drilling, with an average probability of success of 26%. Four of the target sands in the shallow zone were found to be gas-bearing while two were found to be water-bearing. In the intermediate zone, only one water-bearing sand was penetrated before the well had to be suspended due to increasing pressures. The well has been suspended as a gas discovery, whilst the field undergoes further appraisal. The capital expenditure incurred in drilling the well was US$7.8 million. Budgeted Capital Expenditure The capital expenditure budget represents the estimated level of required funding to support the planned growth, development and maintenance of the oil and gas field. The following expenditure is budgeted for 2014 and beyond: • Based on results from the drilling of the exploration well into the Minidiogboro prospect, OER plans to continue exploration and evaluation activities in 2014. Budgeted expenditure associated with the project is estimated to be US$7.4 million.

Inspiring energy New strategic advances OER 2013 asset profiles Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 38 Background OER holds a 45% participating interest in the Ebendo field area with acreage size of 65 km2 carved out from OML 56. The field was awarded by the Federal Government of Nigeria during the marginal field allocation round in 2003. The asset is operated by Energia Ltd. In 2013, production (gross, W1) from the Ebendo Field averaged at 679 bbl/d, representing a 54% increase in production over 2012 due to additional well capacity and the optimisation of crude oil storage and injection. As at December 31, 2013, there were four production wells on the Ebendo Field. Three wells were active producers in 2013. OER’s total production attributable to its working interest for 2013, net of crude oil losses was 247,886 bbls. Capital Projects Ebendo oil production is currently evacuated to a third party gathering facility at Umusadege and then, via the Kwale-Akri pipeline, to the NAOC JV crude oil transportation infrastructure for export at the Brass River Terminal. The asset experienced notable downtime in 2012 and 2013 due to incidents of sabotage and crude oil theft on the export pipeline. In 2013, NAOC allocated crude oil losses of 25% to the production from the Ebendo Field (2012 – 17%). In addition to losses experienced due to crude oil theft and sabotage, the current evacuation route through the 7,000 bbls/d Kwale-Akri pipeline is subject to capacity restrictions on the volumes of oil that can be transported. In an effort to increase pipeline capacity, evacuation options and to reduce losses from theft and sabotage, OER is involved in the construction of an alternative 45,000 bbls/d, 51 km pipeline. The Umugini pipeline will provide an alternative evacuation route through the Trans Forcados export pipeline which will deliver crude oil to the Forcados export terminal operated by Shell. To date OER has contributed US$3.72 million for its share of costs. Construction was suspended at the start of Q3, 2013 due to rising water levels in the seasonally flooded areas of the terrain over which the pipeline is being constructed. The pipeline is now expected to be completed in Q4, 2014. It is expected that capital expenditure of US$4.33 million will be required from OER to complete the pipeline. Negotiations regarding the crude oil handling agreement with the pipeline and export terminal operators are ongoing. In addition to the pipeline construction, OER spent US$19.1 million on completing wells Ebendo 5 and Ebendo 6 on OML 56. The Ebendo 5 well discovered two shallow reservoirs (XIIa and XIII sands) and encountered five hydrocarbon bearing reservoirs (XV, XVI, XVII, XVIIIa and XVIIIb). The Ebendo 6 well was perforated on levels XV and XVI and completed as a dual string on both sands. Both wells have been suspended pending the completion of the Umugini pipeline. Budgeted Capital Expenditure The capital expenditure budget of US$22.73 million represents the estimated level of required funding to support the planned growth, development and maintenance of the oil and gas field. The following expenditures are budgeted for 2014 and beyond: • The capital expenditure budget includes additional costs of US$4.33 million associated with the construction of the Umugini Pipeline. The pipeline is expected to be completed Q4, 2014. • The capital expenditure budget also includes US$8.7 million for drilling of Ebendo 7, which is expected to occur during Q2, 2014. In addition, US$9.7 million is to be spent throughout the course of 2014 on other capital construction commitments on various completion works and maintenance.

Strategic Report Business Review Corporate Governance Corporate Responsibility Financial Statements Supplementary Information Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 39 Background OER holds a 40% participating interest in the Akepo field (“OML 90”). Sogenal is OER’s partner and holds a 60% participating interest in the field and is currently the operator of the field, while OER is the technical partner. The Akepo field is located in shallow water in the Niger Delta, on an area of 26 km2 carved out of OML 90. The original discovery wells on the Akepo field (Akepo 1 and 1 ST) were drilled in 1993 by Chevron. The Akepo 1 ST well was later successfully re-entered and completed in December 2009. Capital Projects OER, with its partner, successfully re-entered and tested the suspended Akepo-1 ST well. Drill stem tests proved flowing hydrocarbons in all three targeted reservoirs. The Akepo-1 ST was completed as a two-string multiple on two of the three zones, with the third zone selective on the long string. Following the completion, the Akepo-1 ST was successfully flow tested on D6 sand. The well is now suspended, awaiting completion of field development. OER, with Sogenal, had originally commenced negotiations with the Nigerian Agip Oil Company (“Agip”) to evacuate the oil to Agip’s Benigboye facility through a 5 km onshore and 10 km offshore pipeline that was required to be newly constructed. As a result of unforeseen issues with the contractor selected to construct the pipeline (insolvency of contractor), OER revised its field development plan to include the use of barges to transport crude oil production to the Chevron export terminal at Escravos rather than through the pipeline to the Agip Benigboye facility. Budgeted Capital Expenditure The capital expenditure budget of US$2 million represents the estimated level of required funding to support the planned growth, development and maintenance of the oil and gas field. The following expenditure is budgeted for 2014 and beyond: • The capital expenditure budget includes US$2 million to develop an evacuation route for crude oil production from OML 90. As mentioned above, the evacuation plan includes the use of barges to transport crude oil production to the Escravos facility. It is expected that these costs will be incurred by Q3, 2014.

The license covers an area of 14 km2, carved out from OML 13. The transfer of OER interest remains subject to third party and Nigerian governmental consent. Approval of the Nigerian Department of Petroleum Resources was obtained in October 2012 and OER awaits approval from the Nigerian Minister of Petroleum Resources. The field is operated by Network Exploration and Production Nigeria Limited (“NEPN”). In the event that the consent of the Nigerian Minister of Petroleum Resources is not obtained, OER shall be entitled to certain economic interests in the Qua Ibo Field. If the economic interests are for any reason unenforceable, then OER is entitled to be reimbursed by NEPN in respect of all the disbursements, costs and contributions made by OER in respect of the development and operation of the Qua Ibo Field. Pursuant to the terms of a farm-in agreement, OER has the option and right to acquire up to a 40% interest in the share capital of NEPN at an aggregate subscription price of US$1 which, so long as the economic interests are valid and effective, bear no economic rights or obligations and shall, if the economic interests become invalid and ineffective, entitle OER to 40% of the economic rights and benefits in all distributions of NEPN. Capital Projects There are two main reservoirs targeted for development, namely D5 and C4. D5 reservoir contains light oil while C4 reservoir contains heavy oil. A successful production test was conducted on D5 reservoir. A drill stem test was attempted on C4 but the well was unable to flow because the screens plugged-up with sand during the well test. The well was subsequently completed with sand exclusion screens and an electrical submersible pump, the latter is an artificial lift device that will enhance production of the heavy crude oil. Qua Ibo Marginal Field development phase 1 started with a drilling campaign in September 2012 and two wells have been successfully drilled and completed; namely Qua Ibo 4 and Qua Ibo 3 ST1. Oil production from D5 reservoir is expected to commence in Q3, 2014 after the commissioning of the OER/NEPN crude oil processing facility which is currently under construction and should be finalised in 2014. Production from the C4 reservoir is expected to commence Q1, 2015. Budgeted Capital Expenditure The capital expenditure budget of US$40.6 million represents the estimated level of required funding to support the planned growth, development and maintenance of the oil and gas field. The following expenditures are budgeted for 2014 and beyond: • US$23.4 million expected to be spent in Q2, 2014 on drilling and completions work on Qua Ibo 5; and • US$17.2 million to be spent on construction of the OER/NEPN crude oil processing facility, which is expected to be completed in Q2, 2014.

Strategic Report Business Review Corporate Governance Corporate Responsibility Financial Statements Supplementary Information Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 41 EEL holds a 30% participating interest in each of deep water blocks, OPL 321 and OPL 323, awarded in the Nigerian 2005 licensing round. During 2011, the Federal Government of Nigeria continued to appeal a high court judgment in favour of the operator, the Korean National Oil Corporation (“KNOC”). The judgment, granted in August 2009, had ruled that the government had acted unlawfully in January 2009 when it voided the allocations of OPL 321 and OPL 323 to KNOC (but not to EEL), nearly three years after the Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) had been executed. Despite requesting and receiving a refund of its share of the signature bonuses of US$161.7 million in September 2009, EEL vigorously maintains its interests in the two blocks. In 2011, Oando/EEL campaigned for a settlement among the government and industry stakeholders. These efforts continue with the aim of achieving a resumption of exploration activities on these highly prospective blocks. A high quality 3D seismic survey has already been used to evaluate a number of large prospects and to select the well locations. Equator Exploration Limited (EEL) In 2009, Oando PLC acquired an 81.5% interest in EEL. The acquisition included interests in six licenses. Three of the blocks are offshore Nigeria, two in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Sao Tome and Principe and one in the Joint Development Zone.

In February 2010, in accordance with agreements signed in 2001 and 2003, the government of São Tomé & Príncipe awarded the Group Blocks 5 and 12, located within the country’s large Exclusive Economic Zone (“EEZ”). For Block 5, negotiations of satisfactory PSCs with the government were completed during 2011 and the agreements were signed on April 18, 2012. Negotiations for Block 12 are on-going. During 2011, existing 2D seismic surveys were used to complete the evaluation of the blocks and identify a number of prospects. In order to manage the exposure to the risks of high cost exploration in a frontier province in ultra-deep water, OER is considering farm outs. A number of world class oil companies have visited the data room in order to assess the opportunity, though there have been no firm commitments from any of them to farm into the block. OER had a total commitment of US$5.2 million related to the provision of a performance guarantee and commitment to a four year work programme of 2D and 3D seismic acquisition and studies. If justified by the results of the seismic surveys, OER can elect (for an additional cost to be determined) to drill the first exploration well in the following two year period. OER committed to a performance bond of US$5.2 million, during Q1, 2014. Inspiring energy New strategic advances OER 2013 asset profiles In April 2005, EEL signed a Finance and Service Agreement with Peak Petroleum Industries Nigeria Limited (“Peak”), the leaseholder of OML 122, an offshore indigenous block. In return for providing funds and supplying technical services, EEL became entitled to a share of any oil and gas production from the Bilabri and Owanare discoveries and from any discovery made by a selected exploration well. Four attacks by militants, three involving the taking of hostages, forced the suspension of offshore operations a number of months before production was due to commence from Bilabri. The termination of contracts with suppliers resulted in major financial penalties to EEL. To relieve these, EEL entered into the Bilabri Settlement Agreement (“BSA”) with Peak in 2007 whereby Peak assumed responsibility for existing debts and for funding the future development in exchange for EEL accepting significant reductions in its shares of oil and gas production. Peak breached this agreement and EEL was awarded US$123 million plus interest in an arbitration tribunal in May 2008. Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 42 In 2011, Peak continued to be unable to meet its obligations under the BSA. Consequently, Oando/EEL pursued winding up proceedings against Peak in the courts of Nigeria. A court has issued a final order for the winding up of Peak and has appointed a final liquidator. Lawyers for the Group have advised that an appeal by Peak has little merit. In the meantime, Oando/EEL also offered Peak a settlement in which Oando/EEL would resume the funding and operations of the Bilabri Oil Field Development in return for an increased participating interest in the oil production and for an assignment of a direct interest in OML 122 with the government. The settlement negotiations broke down and EEL thereafter made an application to the Nigerian courts to wind up Peak. The court granted this application and ordered the winding up of Peak. The court also appointed a Liquidator to take over Peak’s assets. Peak has filed several appeals in this regard and these matters are currently pending before the Court of Appeal. In the event that control of the asset is regained, either through a settlement or through the winding up of Peak, Oando/EEL would resume activities on the Field Development Plan for the Bilabri Oil Field. This calls for the chartering of a Floating Production Storage and Offtake system and the completion of three sub-sea wells, two with horizontal completions.

Inspiring energy New strategic advances Oando Business Review Energy Services Limited (OES) A foremost provider of top quality service to operators of exploration and production companies in the Nigerian energy sector, Oando Energy Services Limited (\"OES\") operates the largest swamp rig fleet in the Niger Delta. This we have been able to achieve through the implementation of advanced technology and adherence to world class safety practices. Our vision is to be the preferred value-adding integrated oil field services provider to the Sub-Saharan upstream oil sector. Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 44 Review of 2013 In the year under review, crude oil prices were relatively steady rising to US$111 per barrel in early 2013 and remaining above the US$100 per barrel mark throughout the year. The Nigerian Government, in seeking to take advantage of the high crude oil prices, restated its target of achieving 2.5mbpd of oil production. To this end, while ensuring the continued stability of the oil industry, the government continued the amnesty programme and renewed its push for the quick passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (“PIB”). Furthermore, the government threatened to withdraw all idle marginal oil fields from their respective operators following their expiration in 2013. These initiatives contributed to increased operator confidence especially for those who have progressed in their planned programmes for 2013 and beyond, evidenced by the direct enquiries received, actual tenders released/progressed and the arrival of assets into the country to commence operations. In 2013, OES, using three of its operational rigs, continued to provide drilling services to its clients: Nigerian Agip Oil Company (“NAOC”) and Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Limited (“SPDC”).

Strategic Report Business Review Corporate Governance Corporate Responsibility Financial Statements Supplementary Information OES 2013 asset profiles OES Integrity During the period, the flagship 3000HP 15000PSI rig, OES Integrity, continued its contract with NAOC and following the expiration of the one year extension contract, OES Integrity was awarded two terms of six-month extensions in December 2012 and June 2013 respectively pending the resolution of the replacement tender which was released in December 2012. In February 2013, the ageing engines of the rig were replaced with four new CAT 3516B engines to ensure continued smooth operations. In the same month, the much awaited first High Pressure (“HP”) well was spudded and OES achieved the feat of drilling the deepest well ever in NAOC swamp operations (17,848 feet). The OES Integrity rig has operated successfully without any recordable incidents and celebrated four (4) years without a Lost Time Injury (“LTI”) incident. Whilst the rig targeted operational efficiency of above 95%, slight operational issues relating to key equipment such as mud pump valves caused it to post operational efficiency of 93.3%, slightly falling short of its target for the year. Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 45\n\n46. Inspiring energy New strategic advances OES 2013 asset profiles OES Passion The 3000HP 10000PSI rig, OES Passion, concluded its first year of operation for SPDC in May 2013 and despite experiencing minor issues at the commencement of the contract, the collaboration between the operations team and the technical services team led to an increase in operational efficiency throughout the year. The rig drilled four wells and achieved operational efficiency of 94.3% for the period, against the 95% target. The rig also celebrated one year operations without an LTI incident in May. To ensure that the rig minimized downtime and improved efficiency, three new radiators were installed. Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 46 OES Teamwork Our 3000HP 10000PSI swamp rig, OES Teamwork surpassed its operational efficiency target of 95%, achieving 97.25% operational efficiency in 2013. During the year, the rig drilled and completed three wells for NAOC and maintained its zero LTI safety record. The rig’s two-year secure contract with NAOC expired September 30, 2013 and although NAOC had indicated its willingness to exercise its one year extension option on the rig, subject to its partners’ approval, subsequent notification from NAOC has expressed its desire to farm-out the rig for a period to interested parties as a result of senior partner budget cuts. The rig continues to work with NAOC on its current location on a well-by-well basis. Business Review\n\n47. Strategic Report Business Review Corporate Governance Corporate Responsibility Financial Statements Supplementary Information 97.25% operational efficiency in 2013 on OES Teamwork Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 47 OES Respect Following the successful conclusion of a 20-year lifetime refurbishment and upgrade project in October 2013, 3000 HP, 10,000 PSI swamp rig OES Respect. Drilling and completion fluids OES set its sight on better performance in the drilling and completion fluids business for 2013 to that achieved in the preceding year. Key initiatives like reduced dependency on current technical partners were initiated as OES entered into discussions with other sources for the supply of drilling fluids chemicals which should result in a reduction in costs by 5-7%. The first batch of products were ordered and delivery is expected in January 2014. Furthermore, significant steps were taken towards increasing the support provided to our clients as OES was able to identify a suitable partner for the construction of a 25,000bbls capacity mud plant to be located in Onne, Port Harcourt. This is seen as a major boost to the delivery of services to clients, increased capacity to take on more jobs as well as the elimination of exposure to product shortages. OES retained on-going contracts for the provision of drilling and completion fluids to its clients such as NAOC, Energia Limited (“Energia”), Oando Energy Resources Limited (“OER”) and Enageed Resources INC. (“Enageed”) while a six (6) month extension was secured with Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (“SNEPCo”) pending when the replacement tender is concluded and contract awarded. OES increased its profitability by securing better terms for the supply of production chemicals to its clients such as SPDC, SNEPCo and TOTAL. Margins were also improved with the conclusion of commercial terms with SPDC for the provision of solids control on OES Passion in addition to providing this service on OES’ other operational rigs. The exceptional performance by the drilling fluids unit resulted in the business exceeding the previous year’s revenue and Profit after Tax (“PAT”) by 36% and 20% respectively.\n\n48. Inspiring energy New strategic advances OES 2013 asset profiles Business Review Drilling bits In 2013, OES’ drilling bits unit won a 2-year fixed contract with Nigerian Agip Exploration (“NAE”) with a possible one year extension and also secured contract extensions with clients such as SPDC, SNEPCo, NAOC and Nigerian Petroleum Development Company Limited (“NPDC”). During the year, there were price wars amongst drill bits contractors who held multiple contracts with existing clients. OES, who in prior years had dominated the Geo-Pilot bit niche of the market, lost ground to competitors who provided cheaper Chinese and Russian Geo-Pilot bit technology. Unfortunately, increased manufacturing costs experienced by Halliburton Drill Bits Systems (“Halliburton”) affected OES’ ability to effectively compete with other suppliers for securing orders to clients. The period saw the business suffer a 57% drop in revenue as against budget. In a bid to claw back market share and remain competitive, OES has negotiated and secured with Halliburton better payment terms, volume discounts and improved lead time for the delivery of bits to clients. The broadening of the relationship between OES and Halliburton was to ensure that both parties are able to capture a large percentage of the market share going forward. This has resulted in Halliburton providing support in-country as well as OES looking further afield for opportunities to add all-purpose bits for less challenging formations to its product offering. The under par performance of the drill bits business underlined the need for the broadening of the Product Service Line (“PSL”). Key focus was on opportunities for additional services to improve the profitability of the PSL. OES is in discussions with a Canadian manufacturer of Slotted Liners with a patented technology for marketing opportunities of those products in Nigeria. While the service line did not commence as hoped in 2013, significant industry research as well as marketing efforts were carried out towards the possible commencement of the business line in 2014. To ensure that OES Respect operations commenced fully with minimal delays, OES hired and retained personnel on the OES Respect project to ensure learning’s from the project were not lost. Such personnel have been retained to crew the rig while it is warm stacked at Onne and upon contract commencement. The increase in capacity of the drilling fluids business has led to an increase in number of OES personnel, with skilled personnel increasing from 446 at the start of the year to 494 at the end of the year. OES has maintained its status as a fully indigenous company with the percentage of Nigerian employees remaining high at 96%. The benefits of the technical team, constituted in 2012 to enable us further provide technical assistance to operations and reduce Non-Productive Time (“NPT”) on our rigs was realised and in full display throughout the year as we saw evident reduction in the number of human errors and equipment failures experienced in our operations. In a bid to respond to our clients in a timely manner OES successfully relocated its operational offices in Port Harcourt to Intels Camp Aba/Port Harcourt Road to ensure close proximity to our key clients. The company continued to lead indigenous drilling contractors by building on its safety performance during the year and recording over four (4) years without an LTI. In further demonstration of our commitment to high level of service delivery to our various clients, our vision of continuous customer excellence and desire to ensure that our processes and procedure are robust and capable of taking the company to its next level, we pursued the closeout of our ISO 9001:2008 certification. This was successfully concluded in December with the issuance of a certificate by the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (“SON”). 96% OES - indigenous staff Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 48\n\n49. Strategic Report Business Review Corporate Governance Corporate Responsibility Financial Statements Supplementary Information 494 OES skilled personnel Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 49 While for the most part 2013 was successful, the sudden notification by both NAOC and SPDC of the reduction in their budget for drilling operations severely impacted our ability to plan for future activities. Furthermore, both clients were unable to promptly meet their financial obligations for services already rendered under the rigs, fluids and bits contracts thereby resulting in receivable figures peaking at approximately US$73 million in December 2013. OES achieved financial close for the capital structure optimization and balance sheet restructuring exercise during the year. Outlook We anticipate and are aggressively working to secure an extension for the OES Integrity contract with NAOC through active participation in the on-going replacement tender which is currently at the technical stage. We foresee a contract extension award which will see the rig operational for the whole year pending the conclusion of the tender and award of contract. OES expects a possible farm-out of the rig by NAOC for a period in 2014 following which the rig will return under the existing one year option agreement. Discussions are on-going with a potential client who has indicated interest in engaging the rig. The rig is also being marketed through participation in on-going tenders with NPDC and Chevron. Discussions have reach an advanced stage with numerous potential operators for the engagement of OES Respect. There are currently six swamp assets operating in Nigeria and based on tenders released, demand exists for eight more rigs. These points towards opportunities for the engagement of the rig. Eearnings from the commencement of the OES Passion will be utilised to mitigate against any start-up difficulties when the rig eventually commences operations. Growth in the drill bits business will be achieved through active participation in tenders, continuous engagement with current clients and marketing of new clients. We will increase sales of drill bits to our current clients through the introduction of more competitively priced bits. These bits will be targeted towards more price sensitive operators and will be especially attractive to marginal field operators while we continue to leverage on our alliance with Halliburton to provide drilling optimisation solutions. OES made progress in identifying suitable partners for its proposed commencement of Directional Drilling (“DD”), Logging While Drilling (“LWD”) / Measurement While Drilling (“MWD”) service offering and identified suitable tool manufacturers for the commencement of this business in 2014. Increased effort will be placed on executing an alliance agreement with an established MWD/LWD/DD service provider with OES providing services on the top/intermediate sections while more challenging sections will be handled by the partner. Commencement of this business line is scheduled for Q4, 2014. Significant focus will be placed on securing contracts for the sand control solutions (Slotted Liners) by offering services towards the end of the year to independents as well as majors who have assets facing high sand concentration in their formation. A substantive agreement has been signed with a Canadian partner towards the deployment of Slotted Liner technology by Q3 2014. Training for the first batch of OES personnel is scheduled to commence in February 2014. With discussions at an advanced stage on the lease of a new build mud plant and the commencement of the purchase of chemicals from more reputable suppliers, 2014 will see the Drilling Fluids and Mud Engineering business grow with better margins and the elimination of supply shortages. OES will significantly increase its capacity and ability to service its current clients as it takes on new ones. With the experience garnered from offering solids control services on all OES’s rigs, the team is working on offering this service to other clients through participation in tenders and marketing of the offering to marginal field operators. OES will continue in its recruitment drive to employ and engage top class Talent from all over the world under our on-going capacity building programmes such as the “Rig Track” programme for graduate trainees and “Fast Track” programme for mid-career hires. These programmes, which commenced in 2012, will ensure that we maintain a pool of talented and motivated employees who will work and be trained within our operations unit to deliver quality service to our clients. In 2014 we will be pursuing new business lines and services to leverage on existing relationships and complement our current offerings. In-roads are being made towards participating in the land and jack up terrains with the plan of adding one more rig to our fleet. This growth will be achieved through strategic alliances with capable asset owners who have demonstrated a desire to enter the Nigerian/West African drilling market. We will also evaluate deep water opportunities as they come along to ensure we are better poised to take advantage of such opportunities in 2015 and beyond.\n\n50.

Inspiring energy New strategic advances OGP 2013 asset profiles Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 54 Natural gas distribution Gaslink Nigeria Limited (GNL) OGP’s flagship company, supplied natural gas to over 140 customers through its circa 100km pipeline network in the Greater Lagos Industrial Areas. During the year under review, we completed the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and awarded the Engineering Procurement & Construction (EPC) contract for the Greater Lagos Pipeline Expansion (Phase IV) Project. In line with our drive for operational excellence and safety practices, our emergency response system was upgraded to an automated real time reporting system. All mechanical works on the de-sanding facility which was being built to control the occasional sand incursion in a certain segment of our pipeline have been completed and we expect to commission the facility in 2014. During the year under review, 4 days of gas outage was experienced due to a major transmission pipeline maintenance programme by our gas supplier, the Nigeria Gas Company (NGC). It should be noted that some of our existing industrial customers, who have been unable to recover from their respective business operational challenges, could not utilize our natural gas during the year under review. East Horizon Gas Company (EHGC) EHCG continued to supply gas to our foundation customer United Cement Company of Nigeria Limited (UNICEM) at its plant near Mfamosing in Cross-River State. In addition to our anchor customer, we are currently at various stages of negotiations of gas supply contracts with a number of potential gas customers in the Calabar area. In 2013, significant disruptions in our gas supply to UNICEM was experienced. This was due to various incidences of pipeline vandalism and NGC’s upstream gas supply challenges. A total of 89 days of gas outage was recorded in 2013. Security surveillance along the Right of Way has since been intensified to forestall future occurrences of pipeline vandalism.

Central Horizon Gas Company (CHGC) This is the vehicle incorporated to takeover, rehabilitate and expand the Trans Amadi industrial area, currently delivers natural gas to nine (9) industrial customers in Port Harcourt. Whilst the existing pipeline rehabilitation work is currently underway, several other potential industrial customers have been identified and have entered into discussions with same. These new connections will drive the expansion of the pipeline network in the Port Harcourt Area. We experienced 36 days of gas outage in the pipeline, an increase of 11 days over the 29 days recorded in 2012. The gas outages were mainly due to SPDC’s scheduled maintenance programs and other upstream gas supply challenges. Gas Network Services Limited (GNSL) This is the project vehicle for our pilot Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) offering. This project enables customers outside our existing pipeline grid to access natural gas for their industrial processes and power generation. The plant, located in Isolo area of Lagos State, commenced commercial operation in September 2013. Having previously received grant funding from the United States Trade Development Agency (USTDA) to evaluate a possible nationwide rollout of CNG installations for vehicular use, we commissioned the feasibility studies in 2013 which is expected to be completed by 2014. This is in continuation of our efforts at ensuring that natural gas becomes the fuel of choice for vehicles, thereby contributing to the reduction of emissions. Power generation Akute Power Limited (APL) APL is our first Independent Power Plant (IPP) which commenced operations in 2010, has now run continuously for three years.

It has an annual retail and distribution capacity of up to 2 billion litres and services over 200 industrial customers (cutting across the major sectors) in Nigeria, Togo and Ghana. OMP’s operations range from sales to marketing and to the distribution of refined petroleum products including Premium Motor Spirit (PMS), Automotive Gas Oil (AGO), Dual Purpose Kerosene (DPK), Aviation Turbine Kerosene (ATK), Low Pour Fuel Oil (LPFO), Lubricating Oils and Greases, Bitumen and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG, commonly known as cooking gas). Terminaling Oando Terminals and Logistics (OTL) is the downstream infrastructure management company of the Oando Group. OTL’s main focus areas are as follows: • Monetising the Apapa Single Point Mooring (ASP) Jetty: The ASP jetty was designed to increase the vessel delivery capacity and off-loading efficiency of petroleum products at Apapa, Lagos. It was conceived to bypass the infrastructural bottlenecks experienced on the Apapa axis thus eliminating the lightering and demurrage charges currently being incurred by marketers. OTL will monetise the jetty by offering throughput services to Oando Marketing PLC (OMP) and other petroleum product marketers on the Apapa axis on an open access basis. • Optimising the downstream division’s existing terminal infrastructure asset: Oando downstream has an asset base of White Product Terminals, ATK depots, Bitumen Plant, Lube Plants and LPG filling Plants. OTL is responsible for optimising these assets to ensure maximum return on investment for our shareholders. The excess capacity available at these terminals would be offered to third party petroleum marketers as throughput. • Identifying infrastructure gaps in the downstream sector: OTL will work with its partners in West, East and Southern Africa to develop the required infrastructure to monetise identified gaps.\n\n60.

OST has a 15% market share of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) importation into Nigeria. Review of 2013 Oando Marketing PLC (OMP) successfully completed the development of its ultra-modern 30KT per annum lubricant blending and filling plant in Apapa, Lagos boosting its ability to supply Oando Oleum at more efficient rates to its customers in the southern parts of Nigeria. Hitherto, all production of Oando Oleum was done in Kaduna. OMP also completed relocation from Victoria Island to its new head office in Apapa for close proximity to its core business; thereby boosting efficiency and strengthening its ability to deliver growth and real value long into the future. Product review PMS volumes sold in 2013 was 1.3bn litres (14% below prior year). The decline from 2012 was as a result of a 9% drop in Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) allocations as well as the unprecedented glut which drove a price war on bulk PMS sales. AGO volumes sold during the previous period was 340m litres (5% higher than previous year). This performance was driven largely through sales via our specialized channels such as Marine and Value Added Peddling (VAP). This underscores our strategy of increasing revenue through tailored services which add significant value to our customers. HHK volumes grew by 6% over 2012 to 125m litres. This was largely driven by sustained supply from major depots which represented an opportunity for OMP to acquire the products. Oando PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2013 60 Other products (lubricant, specialties) Lubricant volume sold was 16.5m Litres (2% below prior year). Reduction compared to prior year was due to strict balance sheet protection strategies deployed by the company as OMP gradually repositioned its lubricants portfolio to focus on higher margin products. The Lagos blending Plant was completed with the commencement of lubricant production in Q2. LPG volumes sold was 21,929MT (3% above prior year). The loss of sales experienced from supply challenges during the NLNG/NIMASA (Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency) face off was largely offset by the attainment of secured off-taker status from NLNG. OMP remains the market leader in this product segment with over 50% market share among Major Marketers. ATK volumes sold was 124m Litres representing a growth of 41% from 2012. This growth was driven by bulk volume sales to Major Marketers. Another initiative which was actualized in 2013 was business expansion into Ghana. Two new Bowsers with combined capacity of 44,000 litres were also added to our Fleet during the year under review. The ASPM Jetty berthing platform was completed with no incident recorded while the sub-sea and on-shore pipeline connections commenced and reached advanced stages. Outlook Oando Marketing PLC remains positive about the future with the drive to boost its competitiveness in the sector and increase its returns on capital invested. Key focus areas are; • To boost returns on capital employed by increasing the performance of its assets. • Investing on higher yield opportunities whilst divesting from low yield or underperforming opportunities Specifically; the company will: • Continue to rationalize its distribution infrastructure to boost its average throughput per day without compromising its market share in the local market. • Continue to grow its LPG business, leveraging its LPG switch campaign and funding from international debt providers which it received in 2013. • Going forward, our focus will be on further improving our forecourt and off forecourt sales through the Pay-As-U-Gas initiative, 3kg cylinder push, Bulk sales and Secondary Distribution Points channels. • Refocus its lubricants business, launching a premium high margin grade in 2014 while also optimizing its new and more efficient production facility in Lagos. • Grow contribution of its non-fuel sector by 50%. • Increased focus on people development with special emphasis on core and function specific competencies and on developmental competencies for future roles in the organization. Business Review\n\n61.

We will continue to invest more in educating all staff and 3rd party contractors to ensure zero fatalities through educational efforts around the hazards of their operating & physical environments. Oando Terminals and Logistics’ key projects and activities for 2014 include: • The ASPM jetty would commence operations in 2014. • Upgrade of Apapa terminal will commence in 2014. The project is targeted at optimising ASPM as well as revenue generation for OTL. The project is targeted at Terminal Upgrade and Automation. Storage Capacity would be increased by approximately 200%, while load out capacity would be doubled. This project is expected to commence in the second half of 2014 and to be completed by 2016. • The Marshalling Yards would be fully upgraded and automated to ease the congestion along the Apapa axis. The marshalling yard will operate 24 hours a day / 7 days a week to ensure continuous and efficient loading at the terminal. This will significantly improve truck load-out rates as well as the terminal loading capacity ultimately improving product delivery across the country. Conclusion We are very excited about the opportunities that lie ahead for your company. The acquisition of ConocoPhillips Nigerian businesses will give us the perfect platform to focus on the higher margin upstream sector to increase returns to shareholders in the short and long term. In the midstream, the expansion of the Lagos state gas pipeline with the Greater Lagos 4 project will commence in the short term and in the mid-term we look forward to the construction of the EIIJ pipeline from Escravos-Lagos Pipeline System (“ELPS”) in Ogun State and will deliver gas to Oyo State, Kwara State and adjoining states of Osun and Ekiti. In the downstream, we are extremely proud of the ASPM which will support the industry by passing the infrastructure bottlenecks at Apapa Lagos and reduce our lightering and demurrage charges therefore positively impacting our bottom line. As we increase our upstream participation alongside other current projects, we look forward to a stellar performance in 2014 and beyond. Mr. J. A. Tinubu Group Chief Executive\n\n62.
