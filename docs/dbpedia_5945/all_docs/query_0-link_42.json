        "text": "From coal and natural gas to solar energy and landfill gas, the Stanton Energy Center (SEC) continues to lead the way as the most diverse generation site in the state. This is a winning combination for customers and the Central Florida community — providing affordable rates and a reliable, clean and well-diversified power supply.\n\nFuel Diversity Pays Off\n\nFuel diversity and operational flexibility have always played a major role in OUC’s generation capacity planning strategies. Fuel markets and the regulatory environment continue to be uncertain and, at times, volatile. Building sufficient flexibility in the generation capacity portfolio is critical to adapting to changing conditions and mitigating the impact to customers.\n\nOUC's commitment to fuel diversity helps keep costs low and allowed the utility to reduce its fuel rate by nine percent in 2016.\n\nLandfill Gas"
