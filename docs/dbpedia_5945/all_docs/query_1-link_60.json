The phase 2 expansion is also called Okpai Phase 2, Kwale IPP Phase II[9] and Okpai Phase II Independent Power Project (IPP),[11] depending upon which company is talking about it.[12]\n\nPhase 1 of the plant was commissioned in 2005.[11] In 2017 Oando Plc secured the Nigerian federal government’s approval for an expansion, essentially doubling the plant's size.[13][14][15]\n\nOando reported spending on $17.5 million on capital expenditures on Kwale IPP Phase II in 2017,[9] indicating construction had begun.\n\nOver the years, Oando has faced serious financial issues that came to a head in mid-2019 when Nigeria's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ordered Oando's entire board to resign.[16]\n\nThe plant's commissioning was delayed to Q3 of 2019[17], however even post-commissioning in 2020 power was not being sent to the grid.[18]\n\nOpposition\n\nIn mid-2019, local Okpai citizens protested against the power plant's operators, claiming the company failed to build promised infrastructure and supply power.[19][20][21]\n\nArticles and Resources\n\nReferences\n\nAdditional data"
