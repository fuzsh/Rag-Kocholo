        "text": "JOHANNESBURG – JSE-listed Nigerian oil company Oando plc saw its profits after tax declining by 16percent in the six months to end June, hit by a once-off 14 billion naira charge (R548.10million), but the 15percent increase in crude oil production made up for this decline. As a result, the group’s profit after tax declined to 7.2bn naira during the period, down from last year’s 8.5bn naira.\n\nHowever, chief executive Wale Tinubu said the half year 2019 was a positive period for the group as it achieved strong top and bottom line earnings despite its overall performance being tempered by a one-off 14bn naira charge.\n\n“Our crude oil and natural gas production grew by 15percent and 8percent, respectively, compared to the similar period last year while we also achieved a significant reduction in our reserve based lending facility to approximately $0.4m (R5.7m) from $450m, a 99percent reduction,” Tinubu said.\n\nThe group increased its production by 8percent to 40873 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/day) compared to 37814boe/day while natural gas production increased by 8percent to 128533 thousand cubic feet per day (mcf/day), up from 118866mcf/day compared to last year.\n\nIts turnover was up by 6percent to 315.4bn naira, up from 297.3bn naira compared to last year, and the group also managed to slash its total borrowing by 5percent to 200.7bn naira, down from last year’s amount of 210.9bn naira. However, the group said since financial year 2014, it had reduced its debt by 58percent from 473.3bn naira, while its upstream borrowings have reduced by 72percent from $801.6m in 2014.\n\nOando incurred capital expenditure of $62.3m during the period, up from $24.7m compared to last year.\n\nThe group is listed on both the Nigerian Stock Exchange and the JSE.\n\nLooking ahead, Tinubu said oil prices had averaged $65 a barrel for most of 2019 and they will continue employing price protection strategy by hedging its production.\n\n“Our focus will be on achieving further growth and profitability by delivering on our production growth initiatives through strategic alliances and partnerships. We also concluded the divestment of our residual interest in Axxela for $41.5m, in line with our strategy of divesting from non-strategic assets and remain on track to deliver on all our initiatives for the year,” Tinubu said.\n\nOanda’s share price has been under pressure due to a controversial spat with Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which in 2017 ordered a probe into the firm aimed at corporate governance and financial mismanagement.\n\nOando recently secured a court injunction restraining SEC from executing sanctions against the company including a fine of 89675000 naira.\n\nThe court also restrained the commission from enforcing its decision to appoint an interim management team for Oando.\n\nCredit: IOL/BUSINESS REPORT\n\nDuplo, the leading provider of payment, spend, and vendor management solutions for African businesses, is predicting that changing global trade patterns and the emergence of new payment solutions will drive significant growth in cross-border B2B payments in Africa and unlock the full potential of intra and extra-continental trade.\n\nThe report, titled “The State of Cross-Border B2B Payments in Africa and its Impact on Trade,” is the third in an annual series of B2B payment reports from Duplo, and it examines a wide range of issues, including key drivers of intra- and extra-African trade, the current state of cross-border B2B payments in Africa, and the outlook for the future.\n\nThe report reveals that the value of intra-African trade reached an estimated $193 billion in 2022, accounting for 13.8 percent of total African trade. This figure, while significant, likely understates the true scale of intra-African commerce, as a significant proportion of cross-border trade is informal and underreported. According to the report, 40 percent of cross-border trade payments between East and West African countries are made in cash, with underreporting ranging from 12 to 76 percent. At the same time, traditional banking channels still dominate large-value formal cross-border B2B payments, despite the high transaction fees and lengthy processing times. These realities underscore the critical need for B2B cross-border payment solutions that can accurately capture and efficiently facilitate these transactions.\n\nDownload BAO E-MAGAZINE\n\nInteroperability between different payment systems is also a major challenge, especially when it comes to cross-border transactions. According to the report, out of 32 instant payment systems spread across Africa, less than half are able to work together seamlessly. This is why initiatives like the Pan-African Payment and Settlement System (PAPSS), although still in its early stages, are crucial for streamlining and formalizing trade across the continent.\n\nWhen it comes to extra-African trade, Africa’s share of global trade value has remained stagnant at 3%. However, new global trends such as the emergence of various Asian countries as economic powerhouses, the new multi-polar world order fronted by the US and China, and other trends point to a shift in global trade patterns. These developments present opportunities for effective B2B cross-border payment solutions that will not only support more trade across and outside the continent but also enhance transparency, improve efficiency, reduce transaction costs, and offer other benefits.\n\nCommenting on the report, Yele Oyekola, CEO and co-founder of Duplo, said, “As businesses navigate new opportunities and challenges that come with changing global trade patterns, there is an increasing need for efficient and cost-effective cross-border payment solutions. Our report highlights the critical role technology can play in overcoming traditional banking limitations. We believe that by embracing these new technologies, businesses can unlock the full potential of intra- and extra-African trade, driving economic growth across the continent.”\n\nThe State of Cross-Border B2B Payments in Africa and its Impact on Trade is available to download for free on Duplo’s website\n\nFounders Factory Africa now 54 Collective CEO, Bongani Sithole (Image: Supplied).\n\nToday, leading African venture capital firm, Founders Factory Africa (FFA), has announced its rebrand and name change to 54 Collective, evolving its business model to better support transformative technology ventures across the continent through catalytic capital and value-add support through its Venture Success Platform.\n\n54 Collective, builds on its exceptional track record of investing in and scaling early-stage ventures in Africa. The new name, 54 Collective, reflects the firm’s ambitious pan-African vision, aspiring to help entrepreneurs grow their businesses to serve all 54 African countries.\n\nThe firm is a commercial-first investor and embeds impact in everything it does. 54 Collective invests in ventures from idea to Pre-Series A stage by offering catalytic capital, and value-add support through its Venture Success Platform.\n\nDownload BAO E-MAGAZINE\n\n“Our catalytic capital and value-add support to founders, through our Venture Success Platform, signifies our evolution and ongoing mission to support entrepreneurs across Africa and enable them to build without boundaries to drive commercial and impact returns. Our name change to 54 Collective communicates our continued commitment to African founders. We are more supportive than ever of unlocking opportunities for entrepreneurs and ensuring a level playing field for youth and women founders,” commented 54 Collective CEO Bongani Sithole.\n\nInvestment strategy\n\n54 Collective, offers equity and non-dilutive capital up to a total of $500k, enabling founders to scale their ventures across the continent. To break barriers of access, female founders receive an additional $150k, to their male counterparts, in the form of a non-dilutive capital.\n\nThe Venture Success Platform is made up of a team of highly experienced venture specialists who provide tailored support. This is in the form of product, growth, commercial relationships, business strategy, talent, technology and data to build ventures for scale. The team also ensures that founders have access to the right funding by preparing them for investor readiness, investor access, fundraising strategies, unlocking debt and impact capital. The Venture Success Platform empowers founders to succeed globally by facilitating networking and community building opportunities.\n\nThis unique combination of significant funding and comprehensive support distinguishes 54 Collective as the only Venture Capital firm in Africa offering early-stage founders with the highest amount of catalytic capital and support from the largest Africa-based venture capital team with over 70 staff members in Kenya, South Africa, Nigeria and the UK.\n\nThe firm has evolved from investing only in the Agtech, Fintech, and Healthtech sectors to being sector-agnostic in its investments, supporting more founders across many sectors on the continent. ​​54 Collective helps founders navigate complex challenges to achieve commercial success and make an impact on the continent through economic growth and job creation.\n\nIn 2023, Founders Factory Africa was named one of the top venture capital investors in Africa, with an active portfolio of over 50 ventures across 10 countries. To date, the firm has supported more than 70 ventures across Africa and helped its portfolio startups to raise nearly $140 million in follow-on capital.\n\nA future of empowerment\n\nWith seven of the world’s fastest-growing economies in Africa, the continent’s venture capital sector is rapidly expanding, with $6 billion invested annually. However, this represents less than 1 percent of global venture funding, indicating a significant unmet need for smart capital.\n\n“We are pursuing opportunistic investments in different sectors across the continent where there are uniquely large opportunities for startups to scale and create sustainable impact in these sectors. Our goal is to invest in 105 startups across Africa in the next five years, enabling entrepreneurs to provide solutions to the continent’s biggest challenges and transforming lives and industries,” concluded Sithole.\n\nThe firm is well on its way to achieving many of its five-year goals which range from enhanced financial inclusion, improved healthcare access, and creating dignified and fulfilling work to creating a gender forward portfolio. 54 Collective is targeting a portfolio where 50% or more of its startups are founded by women. Currently, from the 17 investments made between January 2023 and July 2024 in its portfolio, 45% of them are founded by women. The firm’s investments are also creating social economic impact in the wider economy. For example, Asaak, a vehicle asset financing company has improved financial inclusion for over 11,000 bodaboda drivers. An impact study uncovered that 79% of these drivers improved their quality of life significantly and 80% increased their income after receiving credit from Asaak.\n\nSpeaking on the significance of the brand evolution and future ambitions, 54 Collective’s Executive Chairman and UTOPIA CEO Roo Rogers said, “54 Collective is a powerful economic and social force in the African economy. It is anchored with strong roots on the continent and exceptional network and reputation across the globe. Together with our sister funds, we continue our mission to redistribute investment and knowledge pathways towards a more inclusive, relevant, and equitable future for the Global South.”\n\n54 Collective’s vision is to create a future where African entrepreneurship drives generational progress and prosperity across the continent. The firm’s new name, catalytic capital, and value-add Venture Success Platform offering, marks a new era for the venture capital ecosystem. 54 Collective is redefining investing across Africa, enabling its founders to build without boundaries and solve some of Africa’s biggest challenges."
