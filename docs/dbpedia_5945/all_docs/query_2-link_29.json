Stanton Energy Center. The power station is a 1,951.0-megawatt (MW) coal- and gas-fired power station owned and operated by the City of Orlando, Florida. The coal units co-fire with landfill gas.[19]\n\nCoal was supplied from Carlisle Mine (Crimson Coal), Sugar Camp Mine (Forsight coal), Oaktown Fuels Mine No 1 (Crimson Coal), and Oaktown Fuels Mine No 2 (Crimson Coal).[20]\n\nAs of October 2020, both coal-fired units were slated for a conversion to natural gas by the end of 2027.[21]\n\nAs of December 2021, Unit 1 was scheduled to retire in 2025 instead of being converted to gas.[22][23]\n\nOwnership\n\nThe Stanton Energy Center is owned by 3 companies, Orlando Utilities, Florida Municipal Power Agency and the Kissimmee Utility Authority, the first 2 released their ownership percentages in their financial filings but KUA did not.\n\nGas-Fired Generation\n\nOn December 8, 2020, the Board adopted the Electric Integrated Resource Plan (EIRP) designed to balance the customer driven attributes of reliability, affordability, sustainability and resiliency and achieve its Net Zero CO2 Emissions strategic goal by 2050 with interim CO2 emission reduction goals of 50% and 75% in 2030 and 2040, respectively.[24]\n\nAccording to 2022 Audited Financial Statements, in order to meet the first interim goal of a 50% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030, the EIRP - also known as the Clean Energy Plan - outlined milestone targets including the conversion of the two coal-fired generation units at the Stanton Energy Center to gas no later than 2027, enhanced customer-focused energy efficiency programs and the investment in new solar generation and energy storage. While plans are in process to deliver on each of these initiatives, the gas conversion plans for both coal-fired generation facilities at the Stanton Energy Center were modified in conjunction with the acquisition of OGS, an existing dual-fired (gas - primary fuel and diesel oil - back-up fuel) combined cycle generation facility in September 2021 allowing for one of the coal-fired generation facilities, Unit 1, to be retired.[25]\n\nOUC 2023 Audited Financial Statements mention again the retirement of Unit 1 and the conversion to gas of Unit 2.[26]\n\nEmissions Data\n\n2006 CO2 Emissions: 6,534,109 tons\n\n2006 SO2 Emissions:\n\n2006 SO2 Emissions per MWh:\n\n2006 NOx Emissions:\n\n2005 Mercury Emissions:\n\nDeath and disease attributable to fine particle pollution from the Stanton Energy Center\n\nIn 2010, Abt Associates issued a study commissioned by the Clean Air Task Force, a nonprofit research and advocacy organization, quantifying the deaths and other health effects attributable to fine particle pollution from coal-fired power plants.[27] The study found that over 13,000 deaths and tens of thousands of cases of chronic bronchitis, acute bronchitis, asthma-related episodes and asthma-related emergency room visits, congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, dysrhythmia, ischemic heart disease, chronic lung disease, peneumonia each year are attributable to fine particle pollution from U.S. coal-fired power plants. Fine particle pollution is formed from a combination of soot, acid droplets, and heavy metals formed from sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and soot. Among those particles, the most dangerous are the smallest (smaller than 2.5 microns), which are so tiny that they can evade the lung's natural defenses, enter the bloodstream, and be transported to vital organs. Impacts are especially severe among the elderly, children, and those with respiratory disease. Low-income and minority populations are disproportionately impacted as well, due to the tendency of companies to avoid locating power plants upwind of affluent communities.\n\nThe table below estimates the death and illness attributable to the Stanton Energy Center. Abt assigned a value of $7,300,000 to each 2010 mortality, based on a range of government and private studies. Valuations of illnesses ranged from $52 for an asthma episode to $440,000 for a case of chronic bronchitis.[28]\n\nTable 1: Death and disease attributable to fine particle pollution from the Stanton Energy Center\n\nType of Impact Annual Incidence Valuation Deaths 11 $78,000,000 Heart attacks 15 $1,600,000 Asthma attacks 150 $8,000 Hospital admissions 7 $180,000 Chronic bronchitis 6 $2,700,000 Asthma ER visits 9 $3,000\n\nSource: \"Find Your Risk from Power Plant Pollution,\" Clean Air Task Force interactive table, accessed February 2011\n\nLawsuit\n\nIn December 2018, residents living near the Stanton plant filed a lawsuit claiming that plant owner Orlando Utilities Commission are exposing residents to toxic chemicals and radioactive elements contained primarily in airborne dust from coal ash, and that rare adult cancers and pediatric cancers have been on the rise in nearby neighborhoods. The lawsuit claims an investigation of soil at homes north of the coal plants found radioactive polonium and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, both cancer-causing byproducts of burning coal, at levels exceeding government limits. Lawyers are seeking class-action status for the suit.[29] The class action was filed on March 27, 2019.[30]\n\nStanton ranked 1st on list of most polluting power plants in terms of coal waste\n\nIn January 2009, Sue Sturgis of the Institute of Southern Studies compiled a list of the 100 most polluting coal plants in the United States in terms of coal combustion waste (CCW) stored in surface impoundments like the one involved in the TVA Kingston Fossil Plant coal ash spill.[31] The data came from the EPA's Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) for 2006, the most recent year available.[32]\n\nStanton Energy Center ranked number 1 on the list, with 8,423,056 pounds of coal combustion waste released to surface impoundments in 2006.[31]\n\nAs of August 2022, the 90 acre coal ash landfill was continuing to contaminate local groundwater. The landfill evades EPA environmental protections due to an unclosed loophole in the 2015 coal ash rule.[33]\n\nCitizen groups\n\nBig Bend Climate Action Team\n\nConservancy of Southwest Florida\n\nEnvironment Florida\n\nFlorida Wildlife Federation\n\nSave It Now, Glades\n\nSierra Club Florida Chapter\n\nProposed IGCC plant\n\nSouthern Company, in partnership with the Orlando Utilities Commission and the U.S. Department of Energy, proposed to build a 285 MW IGCC coal plant at the Stanton Energy Center. The project received a Department of Energy pledge of US$293 million in long-term loans.[34]\n\nIn November 2007, Southern Company took the unusual step of canceling the project two months after ground had been broken.[35] The company cited concerns that Florida Governor Charlie Crist would press for additional carbon controls.[36]\n\nIGCC Project Details\n\nSponsor: Orlando Utilities Comm. / Southern Company/ DOE\n\nLocation: Orange County, FL\n\nSize: 285 MW\n\nType: IGCC\n\nProjected in service: 2010\n\nStatus: Cancelled 11/07\n\nArticles and Resources\n\nReferences\n\nAdditional data"
