        "text": "Disney has had a long-term goal to achieve net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from our direct operations (Scope 1 and 2) since 2009, and we remain committed to this ambition. In alignment with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Paris Climate Agreement, we have now also set quantitative and timebound absolute reduction goals for emissions from our direct operations (Scope 1 and 2), and absolute reduction and supplier and licensee engagement goals for emissions from our value chain (Scope 3). In 2023, these goals were validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi).\n\nEmissions from our direct operations come primarily from energy use in our parks and resorts, major corporate campuses, and from fuel used by our cruise ships. Emissions in our value chain come from a wide range of sources, including manufacturing of consumer products, production of media content, and food and beverage operations.\n\nWater Stewardship: At Disney, we recognize that water is essential for ecosystems and a vital resource for communities and our operations around the world. We also recognize that water is a highly local issue, with unique considerations in each geography. In keeping with the latest data and standards, each of our high-impact sites around the world will implement localized watershed stewardship strategies, focusing on both water conservation within our operations and investments to conserve and protect local natural water systems.\n\nSustainable Seafood: Responsible selection and sourcing of seafood is important to the future of our business, to the livelihoods of the fishing industry worldwide, and to the health of the planet for future generations. In fiscal 2023, our U.S. parks, resorts, and cruise lines sourced 96% sustainable seafood.\n\nSince 2009, Disney has operated under a long-term vision to achieve zero waste in our operations. We have made significant progress toward this goal including through a series of waste management initiatives to reduce, reuse, recycle, donate, and encourage behavior change initiatives with our guests and employees, in order to divert as much material as possible from landfills.\n\nWhile we are proud of the progress we have made, we are committed to doing more. We will work to achieve zero waste to landfill for our wholly owned and operated parks, resorts, and cruise line by 2030. We have a responsibility to achieve our zero waste ambition in order to protect the ecosystems and communities that host us, as well as do our part to minimize our global environmental footprint. This will take the dedicated effort of our cast members and guests alike to get us one step closer to a world without waste.\n\nDisney brings stories and characters to life through innovative and engaging products from toys and t-shirts to books and games. We are committed to responsibly reducing the environmental impact of materials used in the creation and packaging of these items.\n\nAs a result of evaluating the impact we can have across our company-branded product portfolio, we identified a set of materials that are consistently used in high volumes and across a number of different product categories and/or are known to have significant environmental impacts associated with their production and use: forest products including paper, wood, and palm; textiles; and plastics. Our materials goals focus on reducing the environmental impacts of these materials while also helping our manufacturing network to become cleaner, safer, and healthier as a whole.\n\nIn collaboration with our various design teams across the company, and leveraging the creative expertise of our Disney Imagineers, we have established a new, rigorous set of design standards that will guide the development of all new building projects. Whether it’s an office building, resort, film stage, or attraction, we will design all new construction with a focus on minimizing waste, water, and energy in the construction and use of the building.\n\nFor the reopening of Mickey’s Toontown at Disneyland Park in Anaheim, California, the Café Daisy kitchen was completely redesigned to incorporate sustainability. All gas appliances were removed, and the kitchen now utilizes only electric equipment. The redesign increased the greenscape ratio and introduced recirculating water features that greatly reduce the land’s overall water use."
