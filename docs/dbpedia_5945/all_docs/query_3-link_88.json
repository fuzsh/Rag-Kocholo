        "text": "By Sully Manope\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo has been long expected to issue tender for new blocks on its western coastal basins. The Licensing, which has been speculated to take place in 2016, is subject to terms that are still being defined. There will be tougher terms, according to Babette van Gessel, president of the International Licencing Association.\n\nApart from the western coastal basins where the focus of speculation is, there is vast open acreage in the eastern part of the country, Ms. Van Gesel explains in a paper Licencing in Africa; Bid Rounds, Blocks. President Joseph Kabila has approved a new oil code, which has noticeably few changes to the bill that was passed in parliament. Ms. Gessel cautions investors to expect tough terms; saying that the minimum capital gains tax is between 35 and 45%. The state also has an expanded role-it will hold 20% carried interest.\n\nShe notes that some of the unanswered questions around accessing permits in the DRC include the implementation of the oil code as well as criteria for exploration permits.“There, certainly, is need for greater transparency”, she declares. The lack of clarity of the processes could deter investment.\n\nIn the DRC, there have been long standing issues around the maritime boundary with Angola offshore on the one hand and with Uganda onshore in the Lake Albert. Again, 2016 is election year in the DRC and that in itself certainly puts a brake on things.\n\nBy Toyin Akinosho, Publisher\n\nThe three Nigerian independents that emerged on the final list of bidders for Uganda’s six-block licencing round are the only proven oil producers among the seven firms from four countries.\n\nWalterSmith Petroman Oil, Oranto Petroleum International Ltd and Niger Delta Petroleum Resources Ltd, have been in the business for a total of 50 years aggregate. They have equity daily oil production ranging from 3,000BOPD to 11,020BOPD.\n\nIn contrast, the remaining four, including Armour Energy Limited of Australia, Rift Energy Corporation of Canada, Glint Energy LLC of USA and Swala Energy Ltd of Australia, are rookies in the E&P business. None of these International Oil Firms has a barrel of oil to its name.\n\n→ Read the rest of this entry\n\nThe Client:\n\nMackenzie Stuart is working with a leading global provider of Freight Forwarding, Supply Chain Management and Warehousing Services.\n\nThey provide multi-modal forwarding solutions, high-end contract logistics service and supply chain optimisation solutions worldwide.

The U.K.-based subsidiary of South Korea’s state-owned KNOC had pulled out of Mauritania and Guinea but was committed to Manatee-1 as an obligatory exploration well.\n\nDrilled with the jack up Paragon M825, Manatee-1 reached total depth of 1,447 metres, intersecting 26metres of gas bearing section of varying quality throughout the wellbore. “Wellbore conditions did not permit the acquisition of a full suite of logging tools in the deeper sections of the hole which makes the analyses of these lower intervals inconclusive at this time”, a press release on the well indicated. ”Additional technical work will be completed with the samples and material collected from the well to improve the understanding of their quality in a post well analysis”, the release explained.\n\nDana Petroleum holds 55% participating interest in Bakassi West, with two Canadian minnows SDX Energy and Soft Rock Oil Co Ltd, holding 35% and 10% respectively. “The secondary objective was to see whether we could make a commercially viable gas discovery”, notes Paul Welch, Chief Executive of SDX Energy, the 35% partner. “At this stage it is too early to quantify the Manateee-1 gas potential\n\nand our technical team will be working closely with our partners to evaluate the well results to determine if the gas volumes on the block have commercial potential”. SDX may be keen on staying in West Bakassi, but Dana Petroleum prefers to focus on Egypt as its preferred country of interest in Africa. The three other countries that the company has interests are entirely on the North Sea: the UK, Norway and the Netherlands.\n\nShell Nigeria gleefully reported in the last fortnight, that it had ramped up to 20MMscf/d of gas, in the Agbada Early Gas Production Facility (EGPF), into its eastern domestic gas network.\n\nThis is a figure that is about a quarter of the plant’s installed capacity. The widely distributed press release about the ‘achievement’ is symbolic of the crying inadequacy of natural gas supply into the Nigerian electricity system, where over 4,000MW of power generation capacity is idled by lack of natural gas to supply them. At the moment, there are very few projects under construction that are aimed at boosting gas supply into the electricity system in a short amount of time.\n\nThey include the NPDC operated 150MMscf/d Utorogu NAG 2, which was expected to have been commissioned by August 2015 and the Seplat-operated increase of its Oben Processing Plant capacity from 300MMscf/d to 525MMscf/d. The country’s publicly generated power, which hit 5,074 megawatts on February 2, 2016, has dropped by 50% in the last two weeks due to gas shortages and transmission challenges.\n\nThe electricity industry is getting less than 70% of the 1Billion standard cubic feet per day it clearly needs to produce just 4,000MW of gasfired electricity. Still, Shell’s Corporate Media Relations Manager, Mr. Precious Okolobo, excited about his company’s Agbada achievement, explained that a peak production of 40MMscf/d is expected to be achieved, sometime soon, in addition to oil production of about 2,500 barrels per day."
