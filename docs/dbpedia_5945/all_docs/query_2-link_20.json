        "text": "This section covers researching past and present oil and gas companies, resources for starting a company in the oil and gas industries, and references to top companies. Energy companies, nationally owned and privately owned, are some of the biggest companies that have every existed in the world. Many of them are well known, Exxon (U.S.), Chevron (U.S.), Saudi Aramco (Saudi Arabia), Gazprom (Russia), China National Petroleum Corporation (China), Equinor (formerly Statoil of Norway), TOTAL (France), and ENI (Italy). Additionally, companies that use oil and natural gas, like autos, electric providers, and airlines are also among the most well-known and largest companies.\n\nThe oil and gas industry is frequently divided into three segments: upstream, midstream and downstream. While each of these areas has a number of independent companies, major companies in oil and gas are often considered integrated, meaning their businesses consist of a mix of upstream, midstream and downstream activities. Companies can be private, public, or state-owned, which impacts the amount of information available.\n\nSupermajor integrated oil and gas companies are involved in each segment of the industry and are defined as typically having market capitalization of $100 billion or more. They are often international oil companies (IOCs).\n\nMajor integrated companies are defined as typically having market capitalization of $10 billion to $100 billion.\n\nAn independent company focuses on one segment of the industry and is defined as a producer who does not have more than $5 million in retail sales of oil and gas in a year or who does not refine more than an average of 75,000 barrels per day of crude oil during a given year.\n\nRegardless of size, there is more data available for publicly-owned companies. Private companies, including government-owned companies, are often not legally required to disclose information, making company research more difficult. More details on general company research can be found in our guide:\n\nUpstream companies focus on exploration and production. Most crude oil production is controlled by National Oil Companies, which includes OPEC, or integrated international oil companies. Upstream companies benefit from high oil and gas prices and high volumes. Other metrics include rig count and capital spending.\n\nMidstream companies handle the transportation and storage of oil and gas. This segment is made up of many independent transportation operators. Oil and gas volumes are important to midstream companies, and prices as they relate to volume: If the price drops so low that upstream companies stop producing, midstream companies are not needed for transportation.\n\nDownstream companies manage the refining and marketing of oil and gas. There is lower market concentration than the upstream segment. Downstream companies benefit from profit margins where they are able to sell their refined products for more than the cost of acquiring the crude resources. Other metrics include the number and size of refineries.\n\nBecause this industry often shifts with mergers and acquisitions, we've provided example companies in each segment of the industry.\n\nAdditional works on companies in the oil and gas industries in the Library of Congress may be identified by searching the Library of Congress Online Catalog under appropriate Library of Congress subject headings.
