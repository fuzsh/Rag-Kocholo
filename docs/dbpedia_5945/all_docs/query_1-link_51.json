Furthermore, our milestone signing of the Sale and Purchase Agreement with Eni towards the acquisition of 100% of the shares of NAOC Ltd, marked a pivotal moment for our organization and is poised to unlock substantial synergies in the near future. Our focus is now on completing the acquisition and seamlessly integrating operations to deliver exceptional value to our shareholders”\n\nOPERATIONS REVIEW\n\nUpstream:\n\nProduction for the twelve months ended 31 December 2023:\n\nFYE 2023 FYE 2022 % Change Crude Oil (bbls/day) 6,024 4,939 22% NGLs (bbl/MMscf) 241 472 -49% Natural Gas (boe/day) 14,572 15,292 -5% Total (boe/day) 20,837 20,703 1%\n\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2023, average production was 20,837bbl/day, compared to 20,703bbl/day in 2022. In 2023, production consisted of 6,024bbls/day of crude oil, 241bbl/day of NGLs and 14,572 boe/day of natural gas. Marginal Production increase was a result of repairs of shut in wells offset by persistent sabotage activities.\n\nDuring the twelve months to December 31, 2023, the Group incurred $52.9 million on capital expenditures related to the development of oil and gas assets and exploration and evaluation activities, compared to $101.9 million in the twelve months to December 31, 2022.\n\nCapital Expenditures in 2023 consisted of $50.6 million at OMLs 60 to 63 incurred on oil and gas properties, $2.2 million at OML 56, and $0.1 million at OML 13.\n\nTrading:\n\nTraded volumes for the twelve months ended 31 December 2023:\n\nTraded Volumes FYE 2023 FYE 2022 % Change Crude Oil (bbls) 32,792,888 21,820,894 50% Refined Products (MT) 1,645,535 1,937,833 -15%\n\nIn FYE 2023, Oando Trading sold approximately 32.8 million barrels of crude oil under various contracts with NNPC Limited.\n\nFINANCE REVIEW\n\nN Million (unless otherwise stated) FYE 2023 FYE 2022 % Change Revenue 3,403,475,797 1,993,754,362 71% Operating Loss 214,519,985 20,584,252 924% (Loss)/Profit-After-Tax 74,723,154 (81,230,816) 192% Average Realized Oil Price (US$/bbl) 83.15 109.55 -24% Average Realized GasPrice (US$/bbl) 12.06 14.74 -18% Average Realized NGL Price (US$/boe) 4.87 6.23 -22%\n\nRevenue\n\nRevenue for the period increased by 71%, positively impacted by significant increase in our trading activity and exchange rate translations, despite lower oil, gas and NGL production volumes and realized prices.\n\nOperating Profit\n\nOperating Profit for the period increased by 924% primarily driven by the above-mentioned increase in revenue, as well as a significant increase in other operating income largely because of foreign exchange gains on the group’s US dollar denominated monetary assets despite an increase in admin expenses primarily from exchange losses from the impact of the Naira devaluation on our foreign currency denominated liabilities.\n\nProfit-After-Tax\n\nThe above factors resulted in a Profit after Tax position of N74.7billion in 2023, despite a 35% increase in net finance costs due to an increase in interest rates on several of our major facilities in line with increases in global interest rates.\n\nEnds.\n\nFor further information, please contact:\n\nAyotola Jagun\n\nCompany Secretary\n\nThe Wings Office Complex\n\n17a Ozumba Mbadiwe Avenue\n\nVictoria Island,\n\nLagos, Nigeria.\n\nTel: +234 (201) 270400, Ext 6159\n\najagun@oandoplc.com\n\nAdeola Ogunsemi\n\nChief Financial Officer\n\nThe Wings Office Complex\n\n17a Ozumba Mbadiwe Avenue\n\nVictoria Island,\n\nLagos, Nigeria.\n\nTel: +234 (201) 270400, Ext 6506\n\naogunsemi@oandoplc.com\n\nFor Oando PLC"
