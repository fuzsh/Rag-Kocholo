        "text": "What is Sustainable Aviation Fuel?\n\nSustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) is a low-carbon synthetic jet fuel that can be used safely in any turbine-powered aircraft. Derived from sustainable feedstocks – including cellulosic biomass, wastes and residues, waste steel mill gasses and captured CO₂ – SAF potentially can reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) by up to 80% compared to conventional jet fuel and is considered pivotal to achieving the aviation industry’s goal of a 50% net reduction in CO₂ emissions in 2050.\n\nWhile the availability of SAF at FBOs around the country continues to grow, additional supply at a competitive price is critical to achieving industry sustainability goals, with a goal of reaching a production capacity of 3 billion gallons by 2030."
