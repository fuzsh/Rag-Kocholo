        "text": "(Permanent MusicalAccompaniment To This Post)\n\nBeing our semi-regular weekly survey of what's goin' down in the several states where, as you know, the real work of governmentin' gets done, and where we must bust in early May, orders from the DA.\n\nWe begin with Breaking News New York, where there was aserious Holy Fking Hell moment in the state legislature.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that in addition to his $121,000 salary as speaker, Silver earned $650,000 to $750,000 from outside legal work in 2013, according to the last financial disclosure form he filed with the state. Sources say federal investigators have been looking at Silver's income from Goldberg & Iryami, a small Manhattan firm that specializes in seeking reductions in city real-estate taxes. He did not report any work with that firm on his financial disclosure form, but a source told the Times he's received \"substantial\" payments over several years. Silver claims he discloses all of his income, as required, but has said little about the current federal investigation.\n\nThis is a monster story. Silver has been a power beyond powers in New York politics for almost 40 years. And he may only be the biggest trophy on the mantel when this is all finished. And it is not unreasonable to speculate that this may be something of a bustling in the hedgerows for the Dark Prince of Albany, who has worked to squash the ongoing probe and, in this case, at least, has achieved an epic fail in that regard.\n\nThe investigation into Silver stems from the Moreland Commission, the anti-corruption probe that was looking into the questionable behavior of several Albany lawmakers before Governor Andrew Cuomo abruptly shut it down in April. Preet Bharara, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, then seized the commission's files and said his office would continue its work. In an October radio interview, he described New York's government as \"a little bit of a corruption disaster,\" and specifically pointed to lawmakers' odd sources of income.\n\nNo, Andrew. You will not be president, either.\n\nLet us truck on down the Grifter Highway to Virginia, where a former state legislator has fallen victim to that most ironic of all tragedies -- being indictedwhen you're already in jail. And worse, being indicted for perjury and forgery when you're already in jail for child molestation. (There is not much good that can happen to you when you are already in jail for child molestation.) And woree-est of all, being indicted for perjury and forgery when you're already in jail for child molestation and taking the victim's Mom down with you.\n\nMr. Morrissey now stands accused of forging a document he vouched for in court, and of persuading the girl's mother to swear to its authenticity. The mother was also indicted on perjury and forgery charges.\n\nI never advocate vigilante justice of any kind, but, as Mr. Rock of Brooklyn once said, \"But, I....understand.\"\n\nWe leave the realm of Me Some Too, Yes? politicians and move along to Illinois, where we confront another basic question of our increasingly ridiculous era:What About The Children?\n\n\"If your child has an account on a social networking website, e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, ask.fm, etc., please be aware that State law requires school authorities to notify you that your child may be asked to provide his or her password for these accounts to school officials in certain circumstances,\" according to a letter obtained by Motherboard.\n\nOne thing I do know, and that's that, given this kind of opportunity, \"limited circumstances\" do not stay \"limited\" for very long. Between this, and the phony War On Drugs, we are going to raise a generation of children who have no idea that the Bill of Rights exists, or that it applies to them in any way. There are people who believe that's a good thing. I am not one of them.\n\nScooting north to the newly formed petro-state of North Dakota, we discover, once again, that pipelines leak because they're pipelines.\n\nAbout 70,000 barrels, or nearly 3 million gallons, of the brine escaped a rupture in a gathering line operated by Summit Midstream subsidiary Meadowlark Midstream. Brines are also referred to as \"produced water,\" which is extracted along with oil and gas during exploration and production. Chloride, ammonia and other contaminants in brine threaten life underwater. The company has been using vacuum trucks to suck about 65,000 barrels of water from the creek -- but a significant amount of that is likely freshwater that was there before the spill. \"The problem is that ... the creekbed is kinda being replenished with water so we extract, it fills; we extract, it fills,\" said John Morgan, a spokesman for Summit Midstream.\n\nYeah, nature's stubborn that way. On the other hand, The Williams County Brine Spill is a great title for a folk song.\n\nIt's a little chilly here. We need some Florida sunshine.And guns.\n\n\"I don't think that law abiding citizens should be stripped of that right to defend themselves and others, just because they walk onto a college campus,\" said Rep. Steube. Steube is one of the lawmakers behind House Bill 4005, which removes university campuses from the state's designated \"gun free zones.\" That means any student, worker, or faculty member with a concealed weapons permit, could legally carry a gun.\n\nI detect some room for compromise here. People can agree to vote for the bill, as long as Florida State disbands its football program immediately.\n\nScooting along the Big Diagonal, we find ourselves in Washington state, where a pol named Martin Moore seems rather confused at where rank, embarrassing opportunism has led him.\n\nMoore, a former Democrat, served as Freeman's legislative assistant and advisor during his time in office. \"I think the Democrats have become intolerant of ideas they may differ on,\" Moore said in an interview. \"Our district is a very unique district. It's almost to the point that it's independent.\" Moore said the 30th District needs bipartisan leaders and votes, which he plans on providing if elected. \"I became a Republican because they are a party of reforms, a party of putting people first and getting things done,\" he said.\n\nMoore is also attended by ghosts.\n\nMoore said Freeman looked at people's hearts. \"I bet you anything he's smiling and I'm taking Roger along this journey with me,\" he said. \"I think he's excited.\"\n\nI bet you anything he doesn't look at all well, but do continue, young padawan. Oh, you say you're another martyrto the cause of Bob Casey? 'Tis a pity.\n\nMoore worked as an aide for Freeman. He also is close friends with state Sen. Mark Miloscia who switched parties last year and won election as a Republican to the 30th District state Senate seat. Like Miloscia, Moore said he no longer felt welcome in his former party as a \"pro-life\" Democrat opposed to abortion. \"The party has become so incredibly intolerant of people who might disagree with them on some issues,\" Moore said in an interview. \"The party has shifted enormously, and it's gone to the far left.\"\n\nThe Left was so intolerant that this guy had an entire career with the Democratic party before he decided to bolt. The fee-fee, how it does burn.\n\nThe state legislature of the newly insane state of North Carolina is back in town for its \"long session,\" so we transport ourselves eastward to Raleigh and discover that, yes, beyond all possible odds, the newly insane state of North Carolina has rendered itself even more newly insane.\n\nState Rep. Paul \"Skip\" Stam, who was re-elected speaker pro tempore of the House during the opening of the legislature's new session on Wednesday, has announced that House leaders will hold a legislative briefing Jan. 28 on a proposed \"religious freedom\" bill. State Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger said last October that he'd be introducing legislation designed to allow registers of deeds and magistrates to opt out of serving LGBT citizens if doing so \"would violate their core religious beliefs.\"\n\nFirst of all, Paul \"Skip\" Stam? Do you need a four-letter nickname when your given name is only four letters. Is this just a Southern thing or what? And, of course, this retrograde statute is nakedly unconstitutional, and may be rendered moot by the Nine Wise Souls anyway, and if North Carolina wants to stand on its rights as a state, we can always send Zombie Bill Sherman back and explain to them again.\n\nAnd we conclude, as is our custom, in the great state of Oklahoma, where Official Blog Dowser Friedman Of The Plainsupdates us on the effects of the Great Climate Change Hoax in the home state of Jim Inhofe.\n\n\"I've lived here my whole life, and the creeks I always played on when I was a kid, they don't run anymore,\" Archer says. \"Tom Steed is the life and the blood of southwest Oklahoma. Right now we're providing 100 percent of the water to Altus. We're providing over half of the water supply to Frederick. We're providing, I think, about half the water supply to Snyder.\" The lake is in trouble. Only 23 percent of the usable water is left. If nothing is done, Tom Steed could be depleted by November 2016. The rosier outlook has the lake surviving until 2021. The Oklahoma Water Resources Board is working with the federal government on a water study for southwest Oklahoma to determine how much water can be pumped from aquifers, and how best cities can insulate themselves from future droughts.\n\nFor the last 100 years, it's been oil. For the next, it's going to be water. It is not going to be pretty at all.\n\nThis is your democracy, America. Cherish it."
