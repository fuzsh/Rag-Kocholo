        "text": "Background\n\nThe American Chemistry Council (ACC) describes itself as “the leading association representing the $553-billion U.S chemicals industry.”\n\nIt “represents a diverse set of companies” and delivers “value” to members through “best-in class member engagement, political advocacy, communications and scientific research”, according to its website.\n\nACC members listed on its website include subsidiaries of Chevron, ExxonMobil, Shell, Total and BP as well as four out of the five largest pesticides manufacturers in the world – Bayer, BASF, FMC and Corteva.\n\nThe ACC was previously led by Jack N. Gerard, who left the ACC in 2008 to lead the American Petroleum Institute (API).\n\nGerard was described by the Washington Post as “the force majeure behind Big Oil,” for his work at the API where he pushed the organisation into a much greater focus on political campaigning and orchestrated “aggressive” and well-funded campaigns against Obama administration attempts to regulate the energy industry.\n\nWhile at the ACC he worked to turn the organisation into a more “potent political force” and coordinated a campaign to secure passage of legislation that would open new areas off the U.S. coast to drilling for natural gas.\n\nThe ACC received $1,207,000 from the API between 2006 and 2018 and has also received funding from the Association of American Railroads and the National Association of Manufacturers both of which have lobbied against restrictions on the oil and gas industry, according to its 990 forms.\n\nThe ACC’s donations include contributions to the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH) – a non-profit which has previously said there is “no scientific consensus concerning global warming” – and the George Mason University (GMU) Foundation.\n\nGMU has been described as a “magnet for right-wing money” and is home to the Mercatus Center thinktank which has repeatedly cast doubt on the science of man made climate change and which received at least $10,474,500 from Koch Foundations from between 1997 and 2011, according to Greenpeace’s Polluter Watch Project.\n\nACC and the American Legislative Exchange Council\n\nThe American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) is a US corporate lobbying group which drafts legislation and encourages US state law-makers to sign up to them “wholesale”.\n\nThe ALEC Exposed project, run by the Center for Media and Democracy, found that the group had drafted over 800 so-called model bills, working with corporations including ExxonMobil, Koch Industries, Peabody Energy, and Reynolds Tobacco to influence legislation.\n\nThe ACC has worked closely with ALEC on policy issues and appeared on a list of attendees at ALEC’s 44th annual conference in 2017 as well as its conference in 2019.\n\nSince 2011, the ACC has helped pass bills preventing bans on plastic bags based on ALEC models in 13 states and it has also helped shape ALEC policy proposals.\n\nIn 2011, a resolution to modify the Toxic Substances Control Act proposed by the ACC — “in response to mounting NGO resolutions containing unfounded health allegations and misinformation about regulatory oversight” — was approved by ALEC’s Energy, Environment & Agriculture Committee at its annual summit attended by dozens of lawmakers.\n\nThe ACC and lobbying on a US-UK Trade Deal\n\nThe ACC made numerous attempts to influence the proposed US-UK trade deal. In January 2019, the ACC gave evidence to the US-UK trade hearing on Brexit in Washington, D.C, while in May 2020 it issued a joint statement on the US-UK deal with British chemicals trade body, the Chemical Industries Association (CIA).\n\nThe ACC’s key demands include “regulatory cooperation” between the countries as well as the provision in any trade deal of “investor state dispute settlements” (ISDS).\n\nWhile the term “regulatory cooperation” denotes joint standards agreed by trading partners to regulate certain types of goods, campaigners at the Pesticide Action Network argue that it has a history of being used by producers seeking to lower EU regulations on health and the environment, including around the use of potentially hazardous pesticides. The EU chemical regulatory system, which the UK has adhered to, offers significantly stricter regulations on chemicals than the US. For example, the EU has banned more than 1,300 chemicals for use in cosmetics, while the US has banned 11.\n\nInvestor State Dispute Settlements have been a key source of controversy over a US-UK trade deal, having previously been used by private companies to protest regulations aimed at protecting the environment.\n\nIn France, for example, the threat of action from Canadian oil and gas company Vermilion caused a weakening of climate protection laws aimed at restricting oil and gas production. In 2008, an ISDS provision was used by pesticides Dow Agrosciences LLC, which made a claim for $1.5 million in damages from the Government of Canada after a ban on certain types of lawn pesticide was introduced by the government of Quebec.\n\nStance on Climate Change\n\nIn a document outlining the organisation’s climate policy positions, available on its website as of August 2020, the ACC states that “climate change is a global challenge that requires long-term commitment and action by every segment of society”. The policy document argues the chemicals industry, including oil and gas producers, is critical to achieving effective climate change solutions.\n\nFunding\n\nThe ACC had a total revenue of nearly $128 million in 2018, including $85.8 million in membership dues, according to its 990 forms.\n\nThe ACC ranks among the largest spending lobby groups in the US, spending $7.6 million on lobbying in 2019. As of August 2020, it had also made $468,197 worth of political donations since 2018, most of which were sent from its Political Action Committee (PAC).\n\nRecipients of donations of over $10,000 or more from its PAC in 2019-2020 included:\n\nRepublican Main Street Partnership\n\nProgressive Americans for Democracy\n\nBlue Dog PAC\n\nCommittee for Hispanic Causes-BOLD PAC\n\nCongressional Black Caucus PAC\n\nNew Democrat Coalition\n\nDemocratic Congressional Campaign Committee\n\nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee\n\nNational Republican Congressional Committee\n\nNational Republican Senatorial Committee\n\nCandidates who received donations from the ACC PAC include Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Iowa Senator, Joni Ernst, senior Republican senator, James Inhofe, and senator and former Presidential candidate, Ted Cruz, all of whom have cast doubt on the veracity of climate science.\n\nAmerican Chemistry Council as recipient\n\n(Data from 990 forms.)\n\n*Note that Dow Chemical Company totals are via Conservative Transparency and have not been verified by DeSmog. Other values have been taken from the ACC’s 990 forms.\n\n** API donation for $1,000,000 is labelled “Coalition for American Jobs C/O American Chemistry Council.” The Coalition for American Jobs is a 501(c)(6) listed under “related Tax-Exempt Organizations” in the ACC’s 2010 and 2011 990 forms and the ACC is the “direct controlling entity.”\n\nAmerican Chemistry Council as donor\n\n(Data from 990 forms.)\n\n*The “Research Foundation for Health and Environmental Effects” is a 501(c)(6) listed under “related Tax-Exempt Organizations” in the American Chemistry Foundation’s 990 forms.\n\nAmerican Chemistry Council Political Contributions via 990s\n\n990 Forms\n\nKey People\n\nFormer ACC President, Jack N. Gerard, who joined the group in 2005 and served as President and Chief Executive until leaving in 2008, went on to lead the American Petroleum Institute, the principal lobby group for the US oil and gas industry.\n\nPrior to working for the American Chemistry Council, Gerard led the National Mining Association (2000 – 2005).\n\nView the attached spreadsheet of the data presented below of American Chemistry Council Key People by year (.xslx).\n\nLeadership\n\nBoard of Directors\n\nHighest Compensated Board Members and Key Employees\n\nHighest Compensated Independent Contractors\n\nActions\n\nMay 11, 2020\n\nThe American Chemistry Council issued a joint statement with UK chemical and pharmaceutical trade association, the Chemical Industries Association (CIA), where it called for a “high-standard, market opening, comprehensive agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States,” and restated several of its key demands set out in a US-UK trade hearing held by the US Trade Representative’s Office in January 2019. This included the demand for the elimination of tariffs on all chemical imports, regulatory cooperation and greater data sharing between the two countries.\n\nCIA members include several UK subsidiaries of oil and gas companies represented among ACC members, including ExxonMobil Chemical Ltd and Shell Chemicals UK Ltd, as well as chemicals giant INEOS. Through the Chemistry Growth Partnership, a government-industry initiative in which it has a leading role, INEOS has called for the UK government to exempt the chemicals sector from certain climate policies and green taxes post-Brexit.\n\nINEOS has also held numerous meetings with the UK government’s Department for Exiting the European Union. On the same day as a November 2016 meeting with INEOS, Robin Walker, then Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, assured the CIA’s annual conference that the UK’s position in trade talks would be to continue working towards “freer trade across the globe.”\n\nJanuary 29, 2019\n\nAt the US Trade Representative’s hearing on “negotiating objectives” for the proposed US-UK trade deal, the ACC’s Director for International Trade, Ed Brzytwa set out the ACC’s demands for trade talks.\n\nThese included the removal of tariffs on chemical goods flowing between the US and the UK, “regulatory cooperation” between the two countries, and a provision allowing for investor state dispute settlements (ISDS).\n\nApril 2009\n\nIn April 2009, the ACC protested the US Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) finding that greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions endangered public health and could be regulated under the Clean Air Act.”\n\nIn response to the EPA’s finding, then ACC President, Cal Dooley, said:\n\n“We believe that the Clean Air Act is not well-suited to address greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources. Given the national implications of carbon dioxide regulation by EPA and the interdependent nature of climate and energy issues, climate policy should be discussed and developed in Congress in tandem with energy policy.”\n\nThe decision to include greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act was made by the Obama administration in an attempt to pass comprehensive climate change legislation after the failure of attempts to introduce a “cap and trade” system.\n\nJanuary 2007\n\nThe ACC completed its merger with the American Plastics Council (APC). In a 2001 statement announcing the intention to go forward with the merger, James Harris, chairman of the APC Board of Directors and Senior Vice President of ExxonMobil Chemical Company said:\n\n“The new American Chemistry Council will take the best from both organisations and integrate them in ways that will enable us to achieve greater societal recognition of the benefits of our products and our industry…we believe the American people support a strong and competitive chemicals and plastics industry and, through this decision, we plan to more effectively demonstrate how we improve the standard of living and lifestyles.”\n\nRelated Organizations\n\nAmerican Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) – The ACC has worked closely with ALEC on policy areas including plastic bans and in both 2017 and 2019, the ACC appeared on a list of attendees at ALEC’s annual conference.\n\nAmerican Petroleum Institute (API) – The ACC received $1.2 million in funding from the API between 2006 and 2018, according to its 990 forms.\n\nMembers\n\nAs of August 2020:\n\nSocial Media\n\n@AmChemistry on Twitter\n\nAmerican Chemistry on Facebook\n\nAmericanChemistry on Youtube\n\nOther Resources\n\nResources"
