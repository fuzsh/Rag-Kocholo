        "text": "Some say that education will be the issue for the 2020 campaign. It should be! While we created a strong and prosperous economy, built communities and raised families, utopians have been hard at work as well. In their long march through our institutions, they have taken over media, the courts, universities, entertainment, corporations, charities and even the churches. In our schools, our children are being steeped in socialism, oppression studies, climate alarmism, moral relativism and multiculturalism. They are being dumbed down, sexualized, surveilled and marketed. What is happening in our schools is nothing short of child abuse and treason.\n\nWhether you have children or grandchildren in the system doesn’t matter. This affects all of us! Government schools are how we get people like AOC elected. It is how they can propose policies like the Green New Deal and produce voters who never question how much it will cost us when everything they offer is “free!”\n\nPlease join us at 6PM on September 3 at the Red Lion Bellevue to learn about how you can fight back and save our children and in so doing, restore this nation. We can make a difference!\n\nWe will be viewing a dramatization of James Clavell’s short story The Children’s Story. Chilling! Following that, ERC board member Marty McClendon will lead an outstanding panel of experts including the following education experts:\n\nJ.R. Wilson has more than 30 years of experience working in public education. In addition to being an elementary school principal, he has taught every grade kindergarten through sixth grade and middle and high school math. He earned an M.Ed. and an Ed.S. at the University of Georgia. He has worked as a curriculum specialist, as a staff development coordinator and has helped write science and math standards. He served on the Washington state Where’s the Math? Executive Committee. Mr. Wilson participated in the U.S. Coalition for World Class Math review of the Common Core State Standards Initiative. He is one of the co-founders of Truth in American Education and currently blogs at The Underground Parent.\n\nJorge Ramos will lead us through how to opt out of some of the most egregious programs. He joined Pacific Justice Institute as the full-time staff attorney to open their Seattle office in 2018. He received his law degree from Seattle University School of Law in 2010 and was admitted to the Washington State Bar in 2011. His seven years of expertise in various jurisdictions, practicing many areas of law, complements PJI’s desire to take on the many religious liberties issues emerging in Washington State.\n\nKaren Larson will take us though how we can support homeschooling as an alternative to government schools. She understands homeschool laws and can explain how to transition children from government schools to homeschooling.\n\nEastside Republican Club’s monthly meetings are held at Red Lion Hotel Bellevue; click here for location information and directions.

He is one of the nation’s leading experts on free-market environmental policy. Todd is the author of multiple studies, articles and books including: Eco-Fads: How the Rise of Trendy Environmentalism Is Harming the Environment. He was a Wall Street Journal Expert Panelist for energy and the environment. Todd’s in-depth research on the failure of the state’s 2005 “green” building mandate continues to receive national attention. He formerly served on the executive team at the Washington State Department of Natural Resources, and was Director of Public Relations for the Seattle SuperSonics and Director of Public Affairs for the Seattle Mariners. Todd holds a Master’s degree from the University of Washington.\n\nLuis Berbesi, the Chair of the 32nd LD, has over 20 years of engineering experience in technology and cyber security which have taught him persistence, business acumen, and the notion that he can overcome any challenge. Luis is a frequent advocate at both the Washington State legislature in Olympia and King County, speaking against proposed legislation that fails to serve the best interests of Shoreline residents. He focuses on issues over party lines, and advocates for budgetary actions that prioritize primary services over tax increases. Luis originally hails from Venezuela where he witnessed the quick decline of a country that chose the path of socialism, and advocates against it in his new home country. He sees this as only achievable through the preservation of the inherent human rights enshrined in the Constitution of the United States.\n\nEastside Republican Club’s monthly meetings are held at Red Lion Hotel Bellevue; click here for location information and directions.

This year he’s promoting Initiative 973, “Bring Back Our $30 Car Tabs”, which would repeal the onerous Sound Transit car tab tax among others, and Referendum 80, “Give Them Nothing”, which would repeal recent pay raises for state legislators and statewide elected officials. He has stood strong in the face of legal persecution by the Washington State Attorney General, who is demanding he be permanently banned from political activity in Washington.

His web site is http://www.wethegoverned.com/.\n\nSome activists write letters to the editor. Groups such as the American Coalition for Equality (ACE) hold state politicians accountable.
