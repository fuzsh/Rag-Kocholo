        "text": "A classicist, especially one interested in the reception of Antiquity, views the Harry Potter novels as an incredibly promising means to increase popular awareness of the classical themes lurking behind every corner of this enchanting narrative. I will attempt first to document this belief by analysing the wider context provided by all concerned publics, from reviewers, critics, scholars, and translators to rank-and-file readers of all ages, as well as movie viewers, Internet surfers, users of all secondary products such as video games, and marketers who orchestrate this symphony of willing players. Promotion of Antiquity appears to be a by-product riding on Harry Potter's popularity. Still, the unprecedented, wide appeal generated by the novels ensures not only that readers, viewers, gamers, fanfic writers and the like learn something (more) about Graeco-Roman Antiquity but also that they view it as part of their historic cultural past and a way to understand the world today. In the Potter universe, classical mythology is not a collection of fairy tales: it is as real and powerful as magic but, like magic, accessible only to the initiated. My second goal is to discuss and reflect on the classical elements in the novels viewed as school stories and according to the particular role each element is designed to play; I will also attempt to explore how they function, if at all, in the audiovisual sphere of today's popular culture and whether the influence of Rowling's classical fascination can be detected there. Scholars and Readers The Harry Potter phenomenon, now late in its second decade, has produced a record amount of secondary literature,1 of uneven quality and nature; most of\n\nIn this article, we examine the balance of imagination and authenticity in Rowling’s medievalism through the productive and counterproductive ways in which the author makes use of fairy tales to augment her Potter universe in the later ancillaries, such as The Tales of Beedle the Bard. As we compare fairy tale elements in an expansion like Beedle the Bard with the approach found in the original heptalogy, we witness a process similar to other ways in which medievalisms are exploited by market forces.\n\nThis paper presents the results of an ethnographic survey that investigates contemporary receptions of the archaeological site of Hadrian’s Library in Athens. Situated in the centre, this large (1 ha) archaeological area defines the modern cityscape. Based on a survey of 100 respondents, it was investigated how modern Athenians perceive the 2nd c. CE library, thus illuminating modern Greek reception of Roman imperialism in Greece. This case-study explores an understudied aspect of Greek historical reception (the place of ‘Rome’ in modern Greek identity) and contextualises it in the Greek modernisation processes of the 19th and 20th centuries. A crucial phenomenon is the notion of purification processes in Greek mnemo-politics, i.e. the modern nationalist grand narrative of a cultural bridge between the ‘Golden Age’ of Perikles to 19th century modern Greece and the elimination of historical elements that do not fit that narrative. This research situates itself in relation to scholarly work on the colonial legacies of Greek archaeology (Hamilakis 2007; Greenberg & Hamilakis 2022; Yalouri 2001) and the recent ‘Dëcoloиıse Hellάş’ initiative. In line with this, the paper explores how purification processes and education continually shape new forms of nationalist ideology and how this may have informed current receptions of Hadrian’s Library. This creates fertile ground for drawing in the Deleuzian notion of ‘virtuality’ in relation to purified archaeological sites such as the Library of Hadrian, pointing to the ways that imaginations of the library have shaped the site and its reception since its ‘re-discovery’ in the 19th century."
