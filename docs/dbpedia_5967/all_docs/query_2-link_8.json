It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the franchise's films and other television series. It is a spin-off from the first Marvel Netflix series, Daredevil (2015–2018). The Punisher was produced by Marvel Television in association with ABC Studios and Bohemian Risk Productions, with Lightfoot serving as showrunner.\n\nJon Bernthal reprises his role from Daredevil as Frank Castle / Punisher, a vigilante who uses lethal methods to fight crime. Ben Barnes, Amber Rose Revah, Jason R. Moore, and Deborah Ann Woll also star. They are joined by Ebon Moss-Bachrach, Daniel Webber, Paul Schulze, Michael Nathanson, and Jaime Ray Newman in the first season, with Josh Stewart, Floriana Lima, and Giorgia Whigham joining for the second season. A television series centered on the Punisher received a put pilot commitment at Fox in 2011, but that project fell through. In June 2015, Bernthal was cast as the character to appear in the second season of Daredevil. Development on a spin-off began by January 2016, and Netflix ordered the series that April when the involvement of Bernthal and Lightfoot was confirmed. The series explores the title character's grief and violence, and was filmed in New York City.\n\nThe first season was released in its entirety on Netflix on November 17, 2017, followed by the second on January 18, 2019. They were met with mixed reviews, but received several accolades including a Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Award nomination. Netflix cancelled The Punisher on February 18, 2019. All of the Marvel Netflix series were removed from Netflix on March 1, 2022, after Disney regained the license for them. They began streaming on Disney+ from March 16. Bernthal will reprise his role as Frank Castle in the upcoming Marvel Studios Disney+ series Daredevil: Born Again.\n\nPremise\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter exacting revenge on those responsible for the death of his family,[a] the first season finds former Force Recon Marine Frank Castle, known throughout New York City as \"the Punisher\", uncovering a larger conspiracy beyond what was done to him and his family.[1] The second season sees Castle, who has been living a quiet life on the road, drawn into the mystery surrounding the attempted murder of Amy Bendix, forcing him to decide if he should embrace his life as the Punisher.\n\nCast and characters\n\n[edit]\n\nMain\n\n[edit]\n\nJon Bernthal as Frank Castle / Punisher:\n\nA vigilante who aims to fight the criminal underworld by any means necessary, no matter how lethal the results.[3][4] Daredevil season one showrunner Steven S. DeKnight said this version of Punisher would be \"completely the Marvel version\", as previous portrayals did not appear under the Marvel Studios / Marvel Television banner.[5] However, Bernthal did study all the previous portrayals, saying, \"once you devour and eat up as much as you can, my way is to make it as personal as possible\". On how Castle resonates with him, Bernthal said, \"He ain't got a fucking cape. He ain't got any superpowers. He's a fucking tortured, angry father and husband who's living in this unbelievable world of darkness and loss and torment.\"[6] Bernthal added that there would be \"a military component\" in the series since Castle is \"a soldier... [The series] will be somewhat centered on that\".[7] He also stated that \"the character that was portrayed on Daredevil season two was sort of the origin tale of how this guy became the Punisher, why he put on the vest.\"[8] Bernthal noted he \"always want[ed] to preserve the essence of\" Castle, who Bernthal described as \"brutal\", \"damaged\" and \"tortured\", by exploring \"the pain and what's behind the violence and the reason why he's committing the violence\" that is \"utterly satisfying and addictive for him\".[9]\n\nEbon Moss-Bachrach as David Lieberman / Micro:\n\nA former NSA analyst who assists Castle after faking his death.[10][11] Regarding Micro's relationship with Castle, Moss-Bachrach said, \"We have found ourselves with common enemies and it's a marriage of convenience.\" Moss-Bachrach also felt the comics version of the character was \"a one-trick pony\", supplying equipment to Castle, but that the character gets \"interesting when their relationship gets bad\" and hoped to explore that in the series.[8]\n\nBen Barnes as Billy Russo / Jigsaw: Castle's former best friend from when they served in Force Recon together. Russo runs Anvil, a private military corporation.[12][10] In season 2, he develops scars on his face, memory loss, and a broken mind like a \"jigsaw puzzle\" after Castle bashes his head into a mirror at the end of the first season.\n\nAmber Rose Revah as Dinah Madani:\n\nAn Iranian-American DHS Special Agent, stationed in Afghanistan, who returns to New York City for an investigation that leads her to cross paths with Castle.[10][13] Revah noted that Madani \"sees herself as American – that's what her being is, that's what she wants to protect, that's why she does what she does.\" As Madani is not based on a character from the comics, Revah's \"research was based more on Homeland and what it's like for those people, and the logical processes the character would be going through. I think, for a lot of actors, if you're playing someone from comics, you probably feel you have some sort of responsibility to represent this character in a light that reflects how they were represented in the comic books. Because I didn't have that, it probably let me be more open in my representation.\" Revah spoke with actual Homeland officers as well as Iranian people \"to make that [part of the character] authentic.\" A special shotgun was made for Revah to use, designed for her stature.[13]\n\nDaniel Webber as Lewis Wilson: A young U.S. Army veteran of Afghanistan struggling with his new life as a taxi driver. He attends group therapy sessions with other servicemen under Curtis Hoyle.[14][15] Webber felt his character was \"a mirror to Frank's journey. These characters really look at each other and they both go separate routes.\"[16]\n\nPaul Schulze as William Rawlins III: The Director of Covert Operations at the CIA, who crosses paths with Castle due to their time in Afghanistan.[14]\n\nJason R. Moore as Curtis Hoyle: A friend of Castle, one of the few people who knows he is alive and former U.S. Navy SARC, who became the leader of a therapy group after losing the lower part of his left leg in combat.[14]\n\nMichael Nathanson as Sam Stein: An HSI Special Agent and Madani's partner.[14]\n\nJaime Ray Newman as Sarah Lieberman: David's wife.[14]\n\nDeborah Ann Woll as Karen Page:\n\nA reporter at the New York Bulletin and Matt Murdock's former assistant, who befriended Castle after working on his case. Woll reprises her role from previous Marvel Netflix series.[17][18] Regarding Page's continuing relationship with Castle, Woll said, \"Frank has a soft spot in Karen's heart, and certainly with the dark history that Karen has, there are very few people she can share her authentic self with. Frank is someone who she could potentially fully open up to.\"[7] She added, \"there's something about Frank where [Karen] doesn't have to be ashamed of her darkest, deepest side of herself. She gets to be more honest with him\".[8]\n\nJosh Stewart as John Pilgrim: A man with a calm exterior and a ruthless interior, who is forced to use the violent skills he developed in his former life once again.[19] Stewart described him as an alt-right, Christian fundamentalist.[20]\n\nFloriana Lima as Krista Dumont: A psychotherapist for military veterans[19] who works with Billy Russo. She is \"very covered up\" and \"very uptight\" in her personal life and \"doesn't want to let anyone into her personal world,\" according to season two costume designer Lorraine Calvert.[20]\n\nGiorgia Whigham as Amy Bendix: A drifter with a mysterious past.[19] She is a teenager who dislikes using profanity and is on the run from Pilgrim's men which leads to her eventually crossing paths with Castle.[20]\n\nRecurring\n\n[edit]\n\nIntroduced in season 1\n\n[edit]\n\nShohreh Aghdashloo as Farah Madani: Dinah's mother who runs a successful psychiatric practice.[21][22]\n\nJordan Mahome as Isaac Lange: A military veteran who attends Hoyle's support groups.\n\nKelli Barrett as Maria Castle: Castle's deceased wife.[23]\n\nAidan Pierce Brennan as Frank Castle Jr.: Castle's deceased son.[16]\n\nNicolette Pierini as Lisa Castle: Castle's deceased daughter.\n\nRipley Sobo as Leo Lieberman: David and Sarah's daughter.[23]\n\nKobi Frumer as Zach Lieberman: David and Sarah's son.[23]\n\nTony Plana as Rafael \"Rafi\" Hernandez: The director of operations for Homeland Security and Madani's mentor.[24]\n\nRoyce Johnson as Brett Mahoney: A Detective-Sergeant at the NYPD's 15th Precinct.

The series would be an hour-long procedural following NYPD detective Frank Castle, \"whose alter ego is that of a vigilante seeking justice for those failed by the court system.\" Ed Bernero was attached as executive producer,[27] but by May 2012, the project had not moved forward.[28] A year later, the character's film rights reverted to Marvel from Lionsgate.[29] In June 2015, Jon Bernthal was announced as cast as Frank Castle in the second season of Daredevil on Netflix.[3] The series was the first of several live action series provided to Netflix by Marvel Television and ABC Studios, with subsequent series featuring Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist all leading up to a miniseries based on the Defenders.[30]\n\nBy January 2016, ahead of the Daredevil season two release, Netflix was in \"very early development\" on a spin-off series titled The Punisher, and was looking for a showrunner. The series would be centered on Bernthal as Castle, and was described as a stand-alone series, outside of the series leading up to The Defenders.[31][32][33] Head of Marvel Television and executive producer Jeph Loeb implied that Marvel Television had not instigated the development of the spin-off and were focusing on making \"the best 13 episodes of Daredevil season two\" at the time, but did say, \"I'm never going to discourage a network from looking at one of our characters and encouraging us to do more ... If we are lucky enough that through the writing, through the direction, through the actor that people want to see more of that person, terrific.\"[34] Loeb stated a month later that the reports about the potential spin-off were \"something that people are speculating on, as opposed to something that's actually happening.\"[35]\n\nIn April 2016, Netflix officially ordered a full 13-episode season of The Punisher, confirmed Bernthal's involvement, and named Steve Lightfoot as executive producer and showrunner.[4][36] Loeb, Cindy Holland, and Jim Chory also serve as executive producers.[36][10] A second 13-episode season was ordered in December 2017.[37][38]\n\nWriting\n\n[edit]\n\nLightfoot noted that \"anti-heroes with dark pasts, that are morally grey, are always interesting to write.\" On deciding to work on The Punisher, Lightfoot stated, \"I was drawn to a guy who is dealing with grief – how does he do that?... We talked a lot as we developed the show that once you take hold of the hand of violence it's impossible to let it go. That relationship to violence really interested me, not just the fact he has the ability to use it but also the cost of it.\"[8] Lightfoot was inspired by the Bourne film series and the film American Sniper when approaching the series.[16]\n\nCasting\n\n[edit]\n\nBernthal had been cast as Castle in June 2015 to appear in the second season of Daredevil,[3] and was confirmed to be reprising the role for the spin-off in April 2016.[4] That September, Ben Barnes was cast in the series in an unspecified series regular role.[12] The next month, set photos revealed that Deborah Ann Woll would reprise her Daredevil role as Karen Page,[17] while Barnes was announced as playing Billy Russo, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Amber Rose Revah also joined the series, as David Lieberman / Micro and Dinah Madani, respectively.[10][11] At New York Comic Con, Bernthal confirmed Woll as a co-star.[18] At the end of October, Marvel announced the additional casting of Daniel Webber as Lewis Wilson,[14][15] Jason R.

He continued that as time has passed, Marvel Studios has begun to see \"how well integrated the [Marvel Television] stories are\" and personally felt \"confident\" in saying Daredevil specifically was part of the Sacred Timeline.[67] With Echo's release, all of the Netflix series were retroactively added to the MCU Disney+ timeline, with The Punisher placed alongside the Phase Three content of the MCU, after Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017).[68][69] An update to the Disney+ timeline split out the series by season, with The Punisher's second season placed between Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018).[70] Bernthal will reprise his role as Frank Castle / Punisher in the Marvel Studios Disney+ series, Daredevil: Born Again (2025).[71]\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
