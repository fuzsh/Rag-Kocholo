        "text": "It's easy to fall in love with Italian. Together with French, the Italian language is widely regarded as one of the most beautiful languages in the world.\n\nThere is no need to innumerate all the reasons why you should learn Italian. After all, this would create a never-ending list. From gelato to Firenze, from la vera pizza to the Sistine Chapel, the appeal of Italy and all things Italian is truly endless. Today, our purpose isn't to state the obvious, but to assist you in reaching your goal in the most creative way possible!\n\nIf you're here, you're probably looking to become fluent in Italian, and one of the best ways to do so is by watching Italian TV shows. If hopping on a plane and hanging out in Italy for a few months isn't an option, then diving into Italian TV shows and series is the next best thing.\n\nPronto? Andiamo!\n\nTips to Learn Italian with TV Shows\n\nWatching Italian television and media will offer you the opportunity to become familiar with the sounds, intonation, and rhythm of the Italian language.\n\nBy watching TV shows and movies, you are essentially training your ear to identify different words, as well as identify them when used in context by native speakers.\n\nAbsorbing real-life expressions in your target language will take you a long way on your path to fluency. It will enable you to become fluent and comfortable when writing in Italian and enhance your Italian conversational proficiency. Let's face it, this is every learner's ultimate goal, right?\n\nIf you're into cinema, you'll know how iconic the Italian film industry is, with directors such as Federico Fellini, Sergio Leone, or the more contemporary Paolo Sorrentino, who directed the Young Pope, starring Jude Law and Diane Keaton.\n\nYou can check out some of the best Italian movies on Netflix, Lingopie, or Amazon Prime.\n\nWatch with the language in mind, not just the story\n\nIn addition to this, consider checking out the Italian dubbed version of your favorite TV show in your native language. Through this technique, you can focus solely on learning the Italian language, (especially if you're a big fan and already know the plot well).\n\nWhilst watching TV shows and movies from your native country won't teach you about Italian culture when you watch dubbed series or movies, you'll still benefit from learning Italian in an (almost) natural way.\n\nUse Italian subtitles to your advantage\n\nIf you are able to watch your chosen Italian TV shows and movies with subtitles, this will undoubtedly be the most beneficial way to watch them, even if it is a bit overwhelming.\n\nBy watching Italian TV shows with English subtitles, you'll still absorb the phonetics and the rhythm of the language, and doing so is hugely beneficial for your language progress in the longer term.\n\nOnce you've watched the whole show and you know what happens, watch it again. And again. And again. This will help you to become more familiar with the language, its grammatical structures, vocabulary, and colloquialisms.\n\nPay attention to Italian culture and cultural cues\n\nAs you watch an Italian TV show, be mindful of the fact that you're also being exposed to Italian culture. This is a very important component of learning any language.\n\nAlthough it's never too wise to generalize, you will be able to pick up on some traits that will be common to most Italian people.\n\nThe Best Italian TV Shows to Watch\n\nIn this section, you'll find out about the range of Italian TV shows and movies available on Lingopie. These will help you to optimize your learning journey.\n\nAs you pick which ones to watch, focus on what seems more interesting and engaging to you, but don't forget to bear in mind the level for which each show is most suitable.\n\nNow, let's get into it.\n\nThe Boss Hunt\n\nInspired by a true story that took place in Italy in 2011, \"The Boss Hunt\" is a crime drama series that will keep you on the edge of your seat.\n\nWHAT IT'S ABOUT\n\nPolitical corruption at its finest.
