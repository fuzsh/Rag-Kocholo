        "text": "Always keen on the spectators’ freedom of interpretation, André Bazin’s film theory not only asks the famous question “What is cinema?,” but it also explores what is a human. By underlining the importance of personalist ethics, Angela Dalle Vacche is the first film specialist to identify Bazin’s “anti-anthropocentric” ambition of the cinema in favor of a more compassionate society. Influenced by the personalist philosophy of his mentor, Emmanuel Mounier, Bazin argued that the cinema is a mind-machine that interrogates its audiences on how humankind can engage in an egalitarian fashion towards other humans. According to Bazin, cinema’s ethical interrogation places human spirituality or empathy on top of creativity and logic. Notwithstanding Bazin’s emphasis on ethics, his film theory is rich with metaphors from art and science. The French film critic’s metaphorical writing lyrically frames encounters between literary texts and filmmaking styles, while it illuminates the analogy betwe...\n\nOf all the criticisms of André Bazin’s defense of cinematic realism, the most damning has been the claim that he did not account for its role in normalizing ideological and political interests. This article seeks to demonstrate that, on the contrary, he asserted a deep connection between the emergence of the medium and the political pressures of the age. The idea of ‘totality’ (and its three iterations indicated in the title) provides us the best clue to traces of these pressures and cinema’s complicity with them in Bazin’s writings. Through a philological approach, the article links some of Bazin’s most directly political writings—on Stalinist cinema, the war documentary, and Italian neorealism—to the original version of ‘The Myth of Total Cinema’. The argument it recovers is that the ideologically abusive uses to which cinema had been susceptible in Bazin’s time proceed in a deep way from its relationship to the contradictions of democratic politics of the century. In the course of this demonstration, the article traces Bazin’s response to Maurice Merleau-Ponty on the question of Stalin’s show trials, the influence on him of the Annales school, and his invocation of Joseph Goebbels’ understanding of ‘total war’.\n\nThis article focuses on objectivity and duration as main features of the realistic understanding of cinema defended by André Bazin. In so doing, it establishes a dialogue between Bazin’s ideas and those of contemporary theorists such as Gunning, Rosen and Carruthers. It is thus observed that the “essential objectivity” of the photographic image, which Bazin associates with its “automatic” or mechanical origins, demands a central position for the subject, who recognises the images projected as evidence of the world. Cinema adds duration, the “mummification of change”, which Bazin understands in a Bergsonian sense. Cinema thus snatches reality from the flow of time, halts the inherent decay of that flow, and incorporates it into a moment—the moment of its projection— that is not its original time and that can be revisited ad infinitum.\n\nIn 1951 André Bazin, the French film critic and founder of Cahiers du Cinéma, reported that the film on art had “snowballed since the war ... becoming the most important development in the past twenty years in the history of documentary, maybe in the history of cinema itself.” (Andrew 2011, 153-166) Despite this enthusiastic statement, among painters and art historians, the encounter of painting and film triggered a wave of hostility due to the invasive nature of technology. As the critic himself recognized: “in order to make use of painting, cinema betrays it in all regards. The dramatic unity and logic of the film sets up chronologies or fictive links between works that are sometimes very distant in time and spirit.” (Bazin 1952, n.p.) How could the nonhuman lens of the camera have any respect for the touch of the painter’s hand? And how could the hand of the film editor be so daring as to cut up and rearrange art that had an internal logic of its own?"
