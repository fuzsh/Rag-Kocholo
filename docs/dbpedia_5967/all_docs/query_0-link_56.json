Introduction\n\nThe subject of Western cinematography was presented in a rather limited volume on the pages of the Soviet Screen magazine in 1957-1960. However, with the appointment of film critic Dmitry Pisarevsky (1912-1990) to the post of editor-in-chief the \"thaw\" tendencies in the Soviet screen led to a gradual increase in the number of materials about foreign cinema on the pages of the magazine (sometimes they took up to a third of the total volume of the issue). Increasingly, photographs of Western movie stars were published (in rare cases, even on color covers), neutrally or positively presented biographies of Hollywood and European actors and directors, articles about Western film weeks and international film festivals, reviews of Western films, etc. Although, no doubt, there were also ideologically biased materials in this magazine.\n\n2. Materials and methods\n\nThe research methodology consists of key philosophical provisions on the connection, interdependence and integrity of the phenomena of reality, the unity of the historical and the social in cognition; scientific, film studies, sociocultural, culturological, hermeneutical, semiotic approaches proposed in the works of leading scientists (Aronson, 2003; Bakhtin, 1996; Balazs, 1935; Bibler, 1990; Casetti, 1999; Demin, 1966; Eco, 1976; Eisenstein, 1964; Gledhill, Williams, 2000; Hess, 1997; Hill, Gibson, 1998; Khrenov, 2006; 2011; Kuleshov, 1987; Lotman, 1973; 1992; 1994; Mast and Cohen 1985; Razlogov, 1984; Sokolov, 2010; Stam, 2000; Villarejo, 2007 and others).\n\nThe project is based on a research content approach (identifying the content of the process under study, taking into account the totality of its elements, the interaction between them, their nature, turning to facts, analyzing and synthesizing theoretical conclusions, etc.), on a historical approach-consideration of the concrete historical development of the declared theme of the project.\n\nResearch methods: complex content analysis, comparative interdisciplinary analysis, methods of theoretical research: classification, comparison, analogy, induction and deduction, abstraction and concretization, theoretical analysis and synthesis, generalization; methods of empirical research: collection of information related to the subject of the project, comparative-historical and hermeneutic methods.\n\nThis article continues our previous series on the analysis of the film press (Fedorov, 2002a, Fedorov, 2002b; Fedorov, Levitskaya, 2022a, Fedorov, Levitskaya, 2022b, Fedorov, Levitskaya, 2022c, Levitskaya, 2022; Levitskaya, Fedorov, 2023).\n\n3.

Lishchinsky (born 1933) - film critic and journalist. Graduated from VGIK. Worked and published in the magazine Soviet Screen. In 1973 he emigrated to Israel, where he continued his journalistic activities, but without specializing in cinematography.\n\nHowever, it was the \"thaw\" of the materials of the Soviet Screen of the 1960s in general and the increase in the volume of articles on Western cinema in particular that caused an extremely negative reaction from the Soviet authorities in 1968.\n\nThe catalyst for this was the events in Czechoslovakia and the entry of Soviet troops into this country in August 1968. It became clear to Soviet ideologists that \"socialism with a human face,\" which already threatened the fortress of the ideological foundations of the USSR with its very proclamation, was largely supported by the Czechoslovak cinema and press.\n\nHence, it is not surprising that, in the wake of the \"Prague Spring\", Prof. Dr. V.A. Razumny (1924-2011), member of the Union of Cinematographers of the USSR and the Soviet Communist Party, known at that time for his strict party views, wrote a kind of policy article \"Position, but what?\" (Razumny, 1968: 26-27), which already on October 1, 1968 was handed over to the set, and on October 19, 1968 was published in one of the leading mouthpieces of the Soviet Power - the magazine Ogonyok (editor-in-chief - playwright A. Safronov (1911-1990), published at that time with a circulation of two million copies.\n\nAnd although the article by V. Razumny was about the journal Cinema Art, it was clear that such lines should be understood in the broader context of the Soviet film press: \"The criterion for determining the creative height of new films here is most often not success with the audience, but how on the contrary, it is a \"fashion\" inspired by Western \"models\" with their modernist incomprehension, pessimism and despair, with their inability to see in the surrounding life a Man with a capital letter, a hero inextricably linked with his people, a fighter for the happiness and well-being of people. It is precisely such \"fashionable\" - albeit not accepted by the audience - films that are in the center of attention of the Cinema Art magazine. They are considered here as the true spokesmen of modernity, its requirements. Moreover, such a point of view has been literally imposed on the readers of the journal in articles and reviews for many years. ... The editors are very diligently implanting in Soviet cinematography a \"fashion\" for plotless movies. It imposes in every possible way: either by praising the refusal of the filmmakers from the plot, or by directly declaring the plot, the very adherence to the principle of plotting is a kind of anachronism. ... Isn't it time for the Committee on Cinematography under the Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Union of Cinematographers of the USSR to pay serious attention to the position of the magazine Cinema Art?\" (Razumny, 1968: 26-27).\n\nV.A. Razumny also criticized articles by the well-known film critic J.L. Warszawsky (19112000), who was deputy editor-in-chief of Soviet Screen magazine in 1968.\n\nFurther, on November 23, 1968, in the Ogonyok magazine, following the article by V.A. Razumny, an open letter by the People's Artist of the USSR Nikolai Kryuchkov (1911-1994) was published, in which he sharply scolded not only the Cinema Art journal, but also the Soviet Screen for promoting Western cinema and hushing up Soviet cinema: \"It is a great pity that V. Razumny's article does not mention another film magazine, the Soviet Screen, which comes out in fantastically large print runs - more than four million copies a month! About fifty million copies a year! That's hundreds of tons of precious paper! This is the work of a large army of people! And what? What is the purpose of the Soviet Screen magazine? This question can be firmly answered: mainly advertising of foreign films, foreign directors and actors, and sometimes, only sometimes, rather vague notes about Soviet cinematography appear on the pages of the Soviet Screen magazine with the definition mainly \"like\" or \"dislike\" this or that critic this or that Soviet film. One gets the impression that the Soviet Screen magazine writes about Soviet films under compulsion. It is absolutely necessary to strengthen the editorial boards of both magazines... with people who will be able to put these press organs at the service of Soviet cinematography and Soviet audiences\" (Kryuchkov 1968: 17).\n\nAnd it must be said that the attack of the magazine Ogonyok on the magazines Cinema Art and Soviet Screen had significant consequences: in early 1969, film critic Lyudmila Pogozheva (1913-1989) was dismissed from the post of editor-in-chief of the magazine Cinema Art. She was replaced in this position for a long time by Evgeny Surkov (1915-1988).\n\nAnd here is the editor-in-chief of the Soviet Screen - Dmitry Pisarevsky - withstood this blow and held out in office until 1975. Was not fired from the magazine and his deputy J. Warszawsky. Apparently, D. Pisarevsky \"at the top\" turned out to have much more connections than L. Pogozheva, and the Soviet authorities believed in his ability, under the influence of \"party criticism\", to completely change the content of the Soviet Screen. Which, in principle, was done: for this, it is enough to compare the contents of the magazine in 1968 and 1969...\n\nThe non-randomness of the appearance of articles by V. Razumny and N. Kryuchkov in Ogonyok was soon confirmed: on January 7, 1969, the Resolution of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party \"On increasing the responsibility of the heads of the press, radio, television, cinema, cultural and art institutions for the ideological and political level of published materials and repertoire\" (Postanovlenie..., 1969) was issued, which did not become property mass audience, but was distributed through \"party\" channels for responsible persons.\n\nAnd here it should be noted that Dmitry Pisarevsky, starting from 1969, tried to strictly follow all the directives of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, because of which the information about foreign cinema in the magazine underwent significant ideological changes.\n\nArticles on the history of Western cinema\n\nFrom the first year of its resumption (1957), the Soviet Screen began publishing articles on the history of cinematography, including foreign ones, quite regularly.\n\nAt the same time, the initial stage of the development of cinema in the West (1895-1910), as a rule, was covered in an ideologically neutral way. Such were, for example, notes about the brothers Lumiere (V pervyi..., 1957: 21) and Georges Melies (Dolinsky, Chertok, 1965: 18-19; Sadul, 1961), about the first acting experiments of M. Linder and Ch. Chaplin (Film ..., 1965).\n\nAs for the history of cinema art of the 1920s, here the Soviet Screen tried to emphasize the positive influence of Soviet cinema on the world process of development of the \"tenth muse\": The era of differentiation of directions and personalities in cinema, which brought such phenomena as the Swedish school, German expressionism and chamber drama, impressionism and the French avant-garde, and above all the revolutionary realism of the Soviet Union, the work of Chaplin and Stroheim, even before the advent of sound in cinema, created a whole series of masterpieces that remain classic to this day. This great flowering of cinema in the mid-twenties had two immediate causes. Firstly, the artists generally became aware of the expressive means at their disposal, learned how to use them and anticipate the results of their searches. On the other hand, we finally found masters who are not looking for cheap applause from onlookers, but for depth and human truth. The third reason acted indirectly, determining the direction of development, both the form and the content of films. Cinema, which broke with the fair stage of development, however, did not cease to be the art of the masses. Films should have been made for millions, not for millionaires. Only the public spectator could become a patron of the cinematographer, otherwise the production costs would not be reimbursed (Velikie..., 1965: 18).\n\nHowever, the film critic G. Avenarius (1903-1958) wrote about Chaplin's early directorial works in a completely \"ideologically consistent\" way, insisting that these films \"expose assertions about the imaginary perfection of the capitalist world\" (Avenarius, 1958: 11).\n\nA rather detailed (by the standards of the Soviet Screen, of course) and distinctly Marxist biased analysis of Western film classics was given by film critic R. Yurenev (1912-2002) in his article \"The Best Films of the World\" (Yurenev, 1959: 12-13), published in links with a survey of film critics from different countries, conducted by the Belgian Cinematheque.\n\nHere R. Yurenev wrote that Intolerance (USA, 1916) by Griffith was rightfully included in the top dozen, but still the main idea of this film is expressed rather vaguely, the composition is immensely complex, many techniques are now hopelessly outdated. On the other hand, in Greed (USA, 1924), Erich von Stroheim \"passionately exposes. the vice that destroys human destinies -greed, the passion for money, for gain\" (Yurenev, 1959: 12).\n\nRecalling Carl Dreyer's drama The Passion of Joan of Arc (La Passion de Jeanne d'Arc. France, 1928), R. Yurenev first noted that in this film the actress strikes with sincerity, truth and depth, but then exclaimed pathetically: \"But isn't this hymn to suffering too gloomy? Isn't the mystical spirit too palpable in him, isn't his pathos reduced to affirming the frailty of everything human?\". And then he made a \"party\" conclusion: \"Being a great work of art, the film The Passion of Joan of Arc expresses ideas that are alien to very many people of our time\" (Yurenev, 1959: 12).\n\nFurther, R. Yurenev reminded the readers of the magazine that The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari. Germany, 1920) by Robert Wiene absorbed the spirit of despair and\n\nconfusion, the desire to escape from life into the world morbid fantasy, into a world of bizarre ghosts and has become a source of anti-realistic, reactionary currents in Western cinema (Yurenev,\n\n1959: 12).\n\nMuch warmer R. Yurenev appreciated the drama The Last Man (The Last Laugh/Der Letzte Mann. Germany, 1924) by Friedrich Murnau, arguing that in it one can hear a protest against the lack of rights of a person in a capitalist society, it has a life truth, deep psychologism, although this film with its bourgeois liberalism, with its cautious criticism and ironic happy ending, forcibly imposed on the director, cannot claim to be the best film of all time (Yurenev, 1959: 12).\n\nR. Yurenev also approached Orson Welles's drama Citizen Kane (USA, 1941) rather sternly, as the directorial techniques in it are varied, but somewhat mannered, deliberate, pretentious. Citizen Kane is a good, strong film, but undoubtedly not the best (Yurenev, 1959: 13).\n\nR. Yurenev's favorites turned out to be three masterpieces of Western film classics: Gold Rush (USA, 1925) by Ch. Chaplin, The Grand Illusion (La Grande illusion. France, 1937) by Jean Renoir and Bicycle Thieves (Ladri di biciclette. Italy, 1948) Vittorio De Sica.\n\nAccording to R. Yurenev, in the Gold Rush, Chaplin ridicules the pursuit of profit, and the romance of gold digging, and the notorious American enterprise, and presumptuous egoism. In a magnificent film, comedy is intertwined with melodrama, the struggle of a small tramp, strong only in his humanity, is crowned with victory; movie is both sensitive and infinitely funny, has cheerfulness, and anger, and subtle lyricism, and reckless eccentria (Yurenev, 1959: 12).\n\nThe Great Illusion \"conquers with its humanism, bold anti-war orientation, richness and diversity of its cinematic language\" (Yurenev, 1959: 13), and Bicycle Thieves is the most striking work of the so-called \"Italian neo-realism\", a movement of progressive artists that arose after the liberation of the country from fascism (Yurenev, 1959: 13).\n\nHere it should be noted that, as in the 1920s, the Soviet Screen still treated Ch. Chaplin's films with maximum reverence.\n\nThus, in her retrospective article, film critic V. Kolodyazhnaya (1911-2003) called Ch. Chaplin a great comedian who, in A Woman of Paris (USA, 1923), with the extraordinary flair of a great realist artist, a subtle and intelligent innovator, creates in this film he is a new psychological drama for his time, reflecting in clear and convincing images all the injustice of bourgeois society, hostile to the human person (Kolodyazhnaya, 1959: 13).\n\nFrom other materials of the Soviet Screen of the \"thaw\" period on the topic of the history of cinema, one can note rather benevolent, but with \"politically correct\" accents, articles about G. Garbo (1905-1990), D. Durbin (1921-2013), D. Coogan (1914-1984), M. Pickford (1892-1979).\n\nIn particular, it was noted that in relation to D. Durbin in Hollywood, \"predatory exploitation of a successfully found and already successful image\" was used, and G. Garbo was forced to play insidious seductresses in vulgar Hollywood melodramas. Only after breaking out of the framework of the bondage contract, Garbo managed to play really interesting dramatic roles (Kartseva, 1962).\n\nBiographies and creative portraits of Western actors and directors\n\nCreative portraits of American and British filmmakers\n\nAn indisputable favorite of the genre of creative portraits of Western actors and directors in the Thaw period of the Soviet Screen was Chaplin (1889-1977): the magazine published four articles of this kind (Alexandrov, 1964: 8; Bleiman 1966: 17-18; Ershtrem, 1957: 12-13; Kukarkin,\n\n1959: 12-13).\n\nIn particular, A. Ershtem wrote that Ch. Chaplin's film A King in New York (UK, 1957) turned into a great event not only in the cultural but also in the political life of Western Europe. ... this is an interesting result of the long and fruitful work of the \"king of laughter\", who, at sixty-seven, is full of strength, energy, bold creative searches. Chaplin spent more than thirty years in the USA, he has the right to talk about those who corrupt for the sake of the dollar ordinary Americans who want to win world domination. A King in New York is a burning satire on the reaction prevailing in the USA, on the violation of the freedom of the individual (Ershtrem, 1957: 12-13).\n\nFilm critic and culturologist A. Kukarkin (1916-1996) was more strict with Ch. Chaplin, because, in his opinion, he did not always succeed ... with equal success to realize his plans, in some cases the well-known limitations of his ideological positions made themselves felt\". However, further A. Kukarkin emphasized that, despite this, in the New Times sprouts of social protest break through and the formation of its class consciousness takes place. The Great Dictator... is already an\n\nangry political pamphlet directed against fascism..... Chaplin's latest films represent one of the\n\ngreatest achievements of critical realism in the post-war cinema of the West (Kukarkin, 1959: 13).\n\nAnd the finale of A. Kukarkin's article did resemble a celebratory toast: \"Looking back at the creative path that Charlie Chaplin traveled, when his 70th birthday is solemnly celebrated, you clearly imagine the origins of the great love that he won from ordinary people all over the world, as well as and the origins of the hatred that his wonderful works aroused in reactionary circles of various stripes and shades. The most talented cinema artist of our time, the singer of Man, the fighter for peace, the angry denunciator of capitalism, Charles Spencer Chaplin is bound by inseparable ties with all progressive mankind\" (Kukarkin, 1959: 12-13).\n\nFilm critic M. Bleiman (1904-1973) was, in fact, in solidarity with the opinion of A. Kukarkin: \"Chaplin's political statements are sometimes naive\", however, \"the constant theme of Chaplin's films, the theme of human grief and loneliness, loss and humiliation in the city of \"yellow devil\", is based on the biography of the artist, on his sharpest, most powerful impressions\" (Bleiman, 1966: 17-18).\n\nBut a connoisseur of the work of actress Vivien Leigh (1913-1967), film critic V. Utilov (19372011), rejecting any ideological passages, wrote that she is an actress of an exceptionally wide range, equally bright and interesting in comedic, dramatic and tragic roles, Vivien Leigh has created many remarkable, dissimilar images in the cinema (Utilov, 1960: 16).\n\nIn a purely positive way, but with \"Marxist accents\", film critic E. Kartseva (1928-2002) talked about the work of an outstanding actor Spencer Tracy (1900-1967): He participated in more than 60 films, starting in the thirtieth year, and throughout his artistic life he never betrayed his principles, never took part in films that degrade human dignity, trample justice or built on lies masquerading as truth. ... Soviet viewers saw Spencer Tracy in films of different periods ... They could be convinced of the versatility of his talent and his loyalty to a certain, very accurately defined type of American - a restrained, incorruptibly honest and independently thinking person with an organic sense of humor and a heightened sense of justice, or, in other words, the best representative of his nation (Kartseva, 1966: 18-19).\n\nIn approximately the same spirit, E. Kartseva wrote about another famous American actor, Henry Fonda (1905-1982). Here she praised Henry Fonda's \"extremely realistic\" performance in Twelve Angry Men (USA, 1957) and noted as great success the roles he played in the Young Mr. Lincoln (USA, 1939), The Grapes of Wrath (USA, 1940) (Kartseva, 1961: 16-17).\n\nTheater and film critic V. Shitova (1927-2002) highly appreciated the work of Anthony Quinn (1915-2001): \"He has a strangely rough, powerful face, excised with large, scar-like folds ... The face of a man, not that gloomy, but like something very different from the rest, was on the screen the face of a pirate, a savage, a gangster, an immigrant. But most often it was the face of a stranger, a person who is somehow torn out of his own environment ... Gradually, the constant theme of Quinn crystallized out - the very motive of the strength and loneliness of his heroes, which is so clearly felt in many films\" (Shitova, 1962: 14).\n\nAnd, of course, the Soviet Screen could not ignore the work of one of the few Hollywood black actors at that time - S. Poitier (1927-2022): No matter what features Poitier endows his characters, no matter what contradictions or complex spiritual world no matter how their images were filled, each hero is based on a truly national character. Behind the imaginary, purely external constraint, the versatility of the character is visible, in which such storms and passions lurk that the viewer intuitively expects their explosion. And when the temperament breaks out, it conquers so much that those around it completely obey its power. Sidney Poitier has become prominent in American theater and cinema. He belongs to those truly talented artists who find inspiration only in new socially significant themes (Krylova, 1960: 19).\n\nIn 1962, in connection with the triumphant release of the western The Magnificent Seven (USA, 1960) on the Soviet screens, a biographical note about the actor Yule Brynner (1920-1985) was published in the Soviet Screen. In general, it was also positive, although with an indication of the \"star disease\" of the actor (Pravda ..., 1962).\n\nUnbelievable, but true: the magazine Soviet Screen did not always scold Psycho by A. Hitchcock. So in an article about the work of an actor Anthony Perkins (1932-1992), film critic E. Kartseva informed readers that almost simultaneously with the film On the Beach (USA, 1959) Perkins starred in Alfred Hitchcock's film Psycho (USA, 1960), and completely new sides of his talent were opened here. Using the traditional theme of Perkins, Hitchcock showed what a tragic aspect a strong human feeling can take (this time - love for a mother). The charm of the actor,\n\nhis still charming smile and carefree gait hid an ominous pathology. A handsome young man turned out to be a mentally ill killer. Psycho brought Perkins worldwide fame (although the great humanistic theme that he developed in all his previous work turned out to be turned inside out) (Kartseva, 1966: 19).\n\nBut the outstanding British actor Sean Connery (1930-2020) in the \"thaw\" Soviet Screen was not lucky. A very critical article was published about his work under the eloquent title \"Prisoner of James Bond\" (Shirokov, 1965). Here, the actor was blamed for his participation in Bond: \"We are talking about cleverly crafted film detectives, in which a certain James Bond occupies a central place - a cynical and cruel, unscrupulous, but outwardly charming \"secret agent of the intelligence service of Her Majesty the Queen of England\". It should also be said that over the past two or three years this movie character has taken an important place in the system of militaristic bourgeois propaganda. Its creators have worked hard to ensure that this \"hero\" in spite of his inhumane nature becomes popular among a not too picky public\" (Shirokov, 1965).\n\nCreative portraits of French and Italian filmmakers\n\nFor obvious reasons, the magazine Soviet Screen willingly published materials about Western \"progressive filmmakers\" who had already passed away, who could no longer be involved in anything hostile to the USSR.\n\nSo the work of Gerard Philip (1922-1959) was devoted to two very positive articles (Gulyanitskaya, 1961; Obraztsova, 1960: 17-18). Assessing the work of this outstanding actor from a Marxist-Leninist position, the theater critic A. Obraztsova (1922-2003) wrote as follows: The work of Gerard Philippe is dear to us, this wonderful artist is close to us. ... The smile of Fanfan la Tulipe lit up with its light, the joy of the hearts of viewers in many countries ... His work took a special place in the post-war artistic life of France, because it actively resisted the pessimism that emerged in a number of works, and empty entertainment and, vulgarity, bad taste, flourishing in commercial film production. The light, transparent, graceful art of Gerard Philip claimed life, struggle, freedom, courage. It proceeded from the folk foundations of French culture and was progressive, international in ideological aspirations (Obraztsova, 1960: 17-18).\n\nAs for other French and Italian stars of the middle and older generation, the Soviet Screen wrote very positively about J. Gabin (Bozhovich, 1966: 18-19), A. Magnani (Rubanova, 1965: 23), Bourvil (Dolinsky, Chertok, 1967), Fernandel (Chernenko, 1965: 18-19), M. Morgan (Lishchinsky, 1968: 18-19), L. Ventura (Markov, 1968), Y. Montand (Semenov, 1967), M. Mastroianni (Bachelis, 1964: 16-17) and others.\n\nSo film critic V. Bozhovich (1932-2001) rightly noted that Jean Gabin (1904-1976) is characterized by an almost hypnotic ability to influence the audience, which the French call \"the power of presence\", is characteristic, of course, not only of Gabin. But experience shows that actors who have nothing but \"presence\" quickly lose their power. And if for decades Gabin remained the hero of the public consciousness, then the psychological reasons that were at work here cannot be separated from the historical reasons. This is what happens when an actor, by the very structure of his feelings, temperament, mentality and character, manages to respond to the deep and essential needs of the time. ... Gabin brought to the screen the spirit of true democracy, merged with a strong-willed, effective principle and deep respect for the human person. ... The bad complexity of the world around Gabin opposed his need for clarity, a high desire for simplicity. It is as if he forges his images with a heavy hammer among fiery splashes and flashes of flame. He does not have that ease of sliding transitions, that emotional mobility and nervous responsiveness to the slightest irritation - all that so often bribes us in the actors of the modern French school. But from him comes a feeling of great inner strength: we have a nature that does not want to be exchanged for trifles. Gabin is a strong-willed and passionate actor. He does not kindle, but restrains his passion. That is why his emotional explosion is so devastating: the actor does not flare up, he is heated from the inside. The growing pressure of passion is interspersed with moments of pre-storm calm. And finally, a long-contained outburst of rage (Bozhovich, 1966: 18-19).\n\nThe magazine also noted the importance of the work of another charismatic actor of the European screen - L. Ventura (1919-1987): With a strong-willed face, a cold look, quick, decisive actions, dismissive of conventions. Lino Ventura created his own type of heroes. His gangsters, as a rule, are courageous people, who do not lose their calmness or camaraderie, no matter how difficult it is for them. The acting style of the actor is restrained, he carefully selects expressive means, knows how to convey calmness, inner strength, confidence of his characters (Markov, 1968).\n\nFilm critic I. Rubanova wrote about the work of Anna Magnani (1908-1973) just as reasonably and stylistically vividly: \"Even long before the world recognized the actress from Rome - the Open City, the audience of the Italian capital fell in love with her in everyday comedies, where she played next to the favorite of the Romans, the comedian Toto. Anna Magnani was also known from cabarets, in which she sang mocking songs ... And she herself, with a tousled mop of hair, with quick and dexterous hands, was not an actress, it seems, but simply one of those who sit in the hall. Roman, in a word. This absolute involvement with the audience played a decisive role for Italian cinema in its time. ... Magnani not only worked well with the directors of the new Italian cinema, but together with them, in essence, can be called its creator. She gave the screen its democracy, its temperament, not only ardent, but also multifaceted; your optimism, which instilled hope in the hearts of the audience even in those cases when sad things happened on the screen. She gave the screen her heart. And she became a symbol of truth in art, became his bellissima -the most beautiful. Because it was a generous gift\" (Rubanova, 1965: 23).\n\nFilm critics M. Dolinsky and S. Chertok (1931-2006) spoke similarly about Anna Magnani, using the epithets \"great\", \"actress of tragic power\" (Dolinsky, Chertok, 1966: 9-10).\n\nFilm critic I. Lishchinsky praised the work of Michelle Morgan (1920-2016) on the pages of the Soviet Screen: \"The heroine of Michelle Morgan, as a rule, is a thin and vulnerable person. Her strength is pride and dignity. This is Michelle Morgan's desire to conquer fate, to prove stronger than circumstances, to prove, at least by her own example, that this world is reasonable, logical, clear. But in fact, the world around is not like that. Circumstances will assert their strength, destroying her happiness, and the characters of the actress will not give up. ... Michelle Morgan is not only a professional actress, but also trained in French. In her interpretation, the lessons of both cinema and theater are felt. It moves easily, freely, and this freedom is restrainedly noble. There is a certain roundness in her gesture. ... Morgan's acting colors are muted: her smile is a half-smile, her joy is a little sad from the start\" (Lishchinsky, 1968: 18-19).\n\nFilm critic T. Bachelis (1918-1999) wrote about the work of M. Mastroianni (1924-1996), a favorite of the Soviet public of the 1960s, with traditionally placed \"necessary\" ideological accents for those times: Some spiritual uncertainty and softness of character, instability of desires and moods are hidden behind the charming appearance and plasticity of Mastroianni's hero, as he appeared in The Sweet Life (La Dolce vita/La Douceur de vivre. Italy-France, 1960). There is no pride or ambition in him. This is by no means an \"intellectual hero\" and not a man of will; what attracts in him is not purposefulness, but impressionability, emotional susceptibility (both to beauty and to any vulgarity and falsehood). The contemplative Marcello glances around, his thoughtfulness and absent-mindedness are colored with slight irony; therefore, his smile is a smile as if to himself, not specially addressed to anyone, not addressed. Unlike, say, Giulietta Masina's smile, which was entirely turned to other people, addressed to the world around. In the very deep bitterness that The Sweet Life is saturated with, both the passionate power of exposing bourgeois society and the position of protecting a person from the dirt and foam of this society that overwhelmed the screen were expressed, from his satiated and false \"love\", from his spiritual flabbiness and impotent, confused intellectualism. The film speaks bluntly: society is to blame for the fact that the individual is leveled. ... Naturalness, behind which one can guess the possibility of improvisation, plasticity that can give grace to any characterization - in a farce, in an epic, in a lyrical monodrama. Smoothness, lightness, ease, some kind of free manner to live on the screen in the circumstances of any plot - this is Mastroianni's style - the style of the person he portrays, and of himself as an artist. And finally, the last one: looking at the game of this master, you feel that he trusts the viewer, knowing that he will perfectly understand the joke, the humor, and any conventions of the plot. Marcello Mastroianni's performance is similar to his smile: shy and frank, modest and slightly ironic, this is a smile of confidence (Bachelis, 1964: 16-17).\n\nStarting from 1968 and for many years (up to the \"perestroika\" times), the Soviet press tried not to mention the famous chansonnier and actor Yves Montand (1921-1991), who was \"fined\" in connection with his speeches in defense of the \"Prague Spring\". However, in 1967, it was not only possible, but also necessary, to write positively about a singer and actor popular at that time in the USSR: \"Yves Montand entered the age of maturity. He is full of energy - manages to play theatre, acting in cinema, singing from the stage. ... And most recently, Montand starred in the film by Alain Resnais The War is Over (La Guerre estfinie. France-Sweden, 1966). The hero of Montand is a Spanish revolutionary underground, a man who sees the meaning of life in the struggle. ... We see\n\non the screen a very smart, courageous, let's say more, talented person, played by Montand with restraint and simplicity\" (Semenov, 1967).\n\nWho knows, perhaps, if it were not for the events of 1968, then the \"progressive\" film The War is Over would have hit the Soviet box office. But in the end, he remained out of sight of the mass audience in the USSR...\n\nOf course, in the late 1950s and 1960s, the Soviet Screen also wrote about young Western actors and actresses at that time. In particular, the work of S. Lauren (Goncharova, 1968: 15), S. Sandrelli (Ivanova, 1967: 14), C. Deneuve (Gosti..., 1966. 11: 13), A. Karina (Chernenko, 1966: 24), A. Delon (Lishchinsky, 1967: 7).\n\nIn fairness, it was emphasized that Anna Karina (1940-2019) finally found her type of modern woman, rushing about in search of the authentic, natural, real, and every time she loses in a world where a person becomes a toy of circumstances. It is no coincidence that the fate of almost all of her heroines is tragic: their purity, on which the dirt of life leaves no trace, is doomed to death. ... She found her character and played her \"from all sides.\" Perhaps, in the future, a different fate awaits her heroine, and she will finally understand that death is not the only way out that one can win in life (Chernenko, 1966: 24).\n\nYes and A. Delon \"is not one of those who pursue easy success. Knowing full well that he does not have a real acting school, he seeks to improve his skills\" (Poznakomtes..., 1962). And although \"Alain Delon seems to have been created for the covers of newsreels - young, slender, frankly handsome\", he is \"a professional, a hard worker, for whom his acting business has both meaning and purpose in life. Such devotion to art, of course, impresses, but also a little bit alarming. Especially when it comes to an artist, who studies a person in all the complexity of his nature, a thinking and acting person. In art, a whole picture of the world is recreated, and it is especially dangerous for an artist to become isolated in his craft ... Alain Delon can act in a variety of roles. And even more: the multiplicity, the multi-character of one and the same person is the most important leitmotif of his work\" (Lishchinsky, 1967: 7).\n\nBut the most popular Western young actress at the Soviet Screen (Sher, 1962: 18-19; Valentinova, 1959; Znakomtes..., 1966: 18-19) after the impressive success in the Soviet film distribution The Blonde Witch (La Sorcière/ Haxan. France-Sweden, 1955) was, of course, Marina Vlady. This happened partly because of her Russian origin, but most importantly because of her openly expressed leftist views and sympathies for the USSR. Plus, in 1968, the shooting of the Soviet-French film The Plot for a Short Story with her participation began.\n\nIn particular, readers of the magazine were reminded that Soviet viewers first met M. Vlady when the film The Blonde Witch was released, where Marina Vladi - Inga turned out to be the soul whole, trustingly sincere, pure and selfless - truly Kuprin. She is ours! That's what immediately made the audience fall in love with a completely unfamiliar performer. The simplicity and spontaneity of the game, plasticity and grace, the inner purity of most of the heroines did not allow this love to fade away (Znakomtes..., 1966: 18-19). A few years later, the film critic Y. Sher wrote that M. Vlady over the years comes acting experience and creative maturity (Sher, 1962: 19).\n\nIn 1966, in the article \"Meet the Polyakov Sisters\" (Znakomtes..., 1966: 18-19) Soviet Screen briefly and very kindly told readers about the life and film / theater career of four sisters, French actresses of Russian origin - Marina Vlady, Odile Versois (1930-1980), Helene Vallier (19321988) and Olga Varen (1928-2009).\n\nAmong the French and Italian directors, Soviet Screen tried to single out, of course, \"progressive artists\" who were in no way noticed in public speeches against the USSR.\n\nFilm critic A. Braginsky (1920-1916), who specialized in French cinematography, was sure that the directorial style of René Clair (1898-1981) is one in its essence and at the same time inexhaustibly inventive in form ... Dynamic editing, clear development of characters, an abundance of tricks that always carry great semantic load, genuine musicality and - most importantly -excellent taste distinguish his films. ... Rene Clair is one of those French artists who managed to reveal the soul of the people of their country (Braginsky, 1962: 17).\n\nAssessing the work of Jean-Paul Le Chanois (1909-1985), film critic I. Lishchinsky wrote that his films \"are different in topics, but in all the same call sounds, which he repeats with the passion of a preacher: \"People, understand each other!\". These are works about solidarity and mutual assistance, about not skimping on good feelings \"And two comedies - Papa, Mama, the Maid and I (Papa, maman, la bonne et moi... France, 1954) and Papa, Mama, My Wife and Me (Papa, maman, ma femme et moi... France, 1955) is a brilliant, laid-back story, repackaged with\n\njokes, comic tricks. ... Such is the work of Le Chanois. This is a very French artist: smart and light, cheerful and humane. He loves his simple characters, and his sincere feeling awakens the same feelings in the audience. And that is why we love Le Chanois\" (Lishchinsky, 1960: 14-15).\n\nCreativity of another very popular among Soviet viewers of the era of the \"thaw\" director-Christiane-Jacques (1904-1994) - Soviet Screen also presented on its pages in general positively. For example, film critic I. Rubanova praised the adventure comedy Fanfan la Tulipe (France-Italy, 1951) and, insisting that the best of what Christian-Jacques created, he did in the spring of liberation, when hope was seething and the future smiled with the promise of democratic reforms, she regretted that in recent years, Christian-Jacques has become involved in the production of standard commercial products (Rubanova, 1965).\n\nReferring to the multifaceted work of the outstanding director and actor Vittorio De Sica (1901-1974), film critic V. Bozhovich (1932-2001) also did not avoid critical notes: While Rossellini, Fellini, Visconti paved new paths for Italian cinema, the thankless task fell to Zavattini and De Sica to exhaust all the possibilities of the method to the end and draw a line under the postwar development of neorealism. Such a work, \"closing\" a certain period, was the film The Roof (Il Tetto/Le Toit. Italy-France, 1956). It turned out to be a collection of commonplaces of neorealist cinema, worldly authentic, but devoid of the former artistic power and persuasiveness. It was impossible to go further along the same path. The creators of the film themselves felt this too ... In De Sica's latest films, Marriage Italian Style (Matrimonio all'italiana/Mariage à l'italienne. Italy-France, 1964), Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow (Ieri, oggi, domani/Hier, aurjourd'hui et demain. Italy-France, 1963) in addition to being made by the hand of a master, there are many moments that attract attention . ... Of course, the main goal ... is to entertain the viewer. But what is also important is where the author is looking for the possibility of entertainment, where he sees the fullness and boiling of life. ... Let's hope that Vittorio De Sica, this greatest master of neorealism, will make another new contribution to the development of Italian cinema (Bozhovich, 1967).\n\nTheater expert and film critic V. Shitova (1927-2002), analyzing the work of the director Luchino Visconti (1906-1976), staged his drama Rocco and His Brothers (Rocco ei suoi fratelli/Rocco et ses frères. Italy-France, 1960) in parallel with Fyodor Dostoevsky's novel The Brothers Karamazov, noting that the great and strict artist\" \"peers with pain at the cruel patterns of human dehumanization. Even such a beautiful, mentally perfect being as Rocco cannot resist this process. ... The scale of the shown moral tragedy is so significant that the ending, in which there is only a faint ray of hope and the promise of renewal, cannot be its true resolution (Shitova, 1962).\n\nFilm critic I. Rubanova was in full solidarity with her, writing that the works of L. Visconti \"they do not often appear on the screen, but each of them is a premonition of new themes, new concerns of Italian cinema, the discovery of its new expressive possibilities. ... Visconti worked all his life in such a way that each of his films is a stage in the development of national cinematography and, to some extent, world cinematography\" (Rubanova, 1966: 19).\n\nOf course, the magazine could not ignore the analysis of the work of one of the most prominent Italian directors of the \"left flank\", a member of the Italian Communist Party Giuseppe De Santis (1917-1997), emphasizing that he needed to have great courage to \"in the most difficult years reaction, \"gagged\" to stand firmly on the extreme left flank of Italian cinema, preaching with his work the art of great social and artistic generalizations. ... De Santis did not compromise his convictions one iota\" (Lunyakova, 1966: 16).\n\nBut the work of the famous Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni (1912-2007) in the Soviet Screen of the first half of the 1960s received a very negative assessment. Film critic and screenwriter of the \"old Soviet school\" N. Kovarsky (1904-1974) considered that Antonioni, moving away from the principles of neorealism, changed both the characters and the social environment in which they live, and the themes, and the range of problems. Neorealism was revolutionary ... Antonioni replaced the rebellious pathos of neorealism with a bad predilection for dubious mental difficulties for characters extremely reminiscent of the heroes of decadent literature. ... In essence, both his characters and his films - one of the characteristic phenomena of conformism, which has no signs of ideological and artistic revolutionary and is marked by all the signs of bourgeois stagnation. For all his talent and fashionable \"leftism\", his films are sometimes reminiscent of the salon melodramas that were so characteristic of pre-First World War Italian cinema. Art is bread. It is our daily bread. And the art of Antonioni, an artist who is undoubtedly\n\ntalented, whose characters and whose films are meaningless and empty, is not bread and not even ersatz. It is a stone instead of bread (Kovarsky, 1962).\n\nInterviews with Western filmmakers\n\nIt is clear that the Soviet Screen tried to publish interviews only with those Western filmmakers who fit into the ideological framework of \"progressive artists\" set by the authorities.\n\nThus, interviews with Ch. Chaplin often appeared on the pages of the magazine (Alexandrov, 1962; 1964; Belova et al., 1961).\n\nA special role here was assigned to the director G. Alexandrov (1903-1983), who met Chaplin personally more than once. At the same time, G. Alexandrov did not tire of emphasizing that Chaplin indignantly condemns the preparations for a nuclear war, calls on artists to fight against nuclear weapons with all their creativity, to do everything possible to strengthen peace (Alexandrov, 1962), and \"each new meeting with Chaplin - this is a meeting with youth, enthusiasm, humor and creative inspiration ... We didn't touch on any topics in our long conversations with Chaplin! They talked about the Stanislavsky method (Chaplin is his ardent supporter), and about Freud's psychoanalysis (\"They replaced all creative methods in the USA,\" my interlocutor said), and about the problem of standardizing actors in Hollywood (\"Most of them play the same, only in different costumes\"), and about the production of War and Peace in the USSR (\"Finally, you Russians will film your brilliant novel yourself\"),\n\nInterviews were also published with such famous directors as Joris Ivens (1898-1989) (Mastera..., 1957: 16-17), Federico Fellini (1920-1993) (Mikhan, 1967: 14-15), Yves Ciampi (19211982) (Senin, 1966: 18-19),Giuseppe De Santis (1917-1997) (Dolinsky, Chertok, 1965: 14-15); Nanni Loy (1925-1995) (Bogemsky, 1966: 18), Luigi Comencini (1916-2007) (Tokarevich, 1966: 20), etc.\n\nLet us cite a fragment of an interview with L. Comencini, which is typical in this sense, where he emphasized that \"a film, like every work of art, should raise issues that are important for a given country, should have its own national features and characteristics. Otherwise, it will lose the only form that is the only one capable of embodying the content that is urgently needed by the people of the country where the film was created. I do not always agree with our esthetic critics who call on filmmakers to create films that the audience does not accept. The position of such critics is understandable to me; often they are even right, especially when they are fighting against the vulgarization of art. Yet no one makes films for himself or for critics. Therefore, I firmly know that I must make films that are accessible to the audience and will be successful with them\" (Quoted in: Tokarevich, 1966: 20).\n\nAs for Western actors and actresses, their interviews were in most cases less socially oriented. This applies, for example, to texts of interviews with Sophia Loren (Soviet Screen, 1965: 17-18), Claudia Cardinale (Soviet Screen, 1967) and others.\n\nPerhaps only an interview with Marlene Dietrich (1901-1992) turned out to be openly biased by M. Dolinsky and S. Chertok, and as a result, the authors made the following conclusion: \"We knew a lot about Marlene Dietrich the actress, but we did not fully imagine Dietrich the person. Now the acquaintance has taken place. It brought admiration for her young talent, respect for her position as a citizen and artist, for whom art is a weapon\" (Dolinsky, Chertok, 1964: 19).\n\nEvaluation of Western films that hit the USSR film distribution\n\nOpinions of the reviewers of the \"Soviet Screen\" about American, British and Canadian films shown in the Soviet box office\n\nIn the era of the \"thaw\", the magazine first of all tried to review Western films that got into Soviet distribution. So in the late 1950s and early 1960s, a number of British dramas were generally highly appreciated in the materials of the Soviet Screen: as a rule, these were adaptations of classic literary works: The Million Pound Note (UK, 1953), Great Expectations (UK, 1946), Oliver Twist (UK, 1948), Richard III (UK, 1955) (Nedelija..., 1959; Vilesov, 1960: 7-8; Utilov, 1961: 14-15).\n\nIn particular, film critic V. Utilov (1937-2011) wrote that Great Expectations (UK, 1946) managed to create (especially at the beginning of the film) a truly Dickensian atmosphere of action\", and in Oliver Twist (UK, 1948) David Lean's in much greater depth than in his previous film, shows the social environment that breeds poverty and crime. Confident acting, precise directing, a perfectly conveyed atmosphere of horror and impotence before the authorities ... , an original cameraman's decision ... all this gave Lean the opportunity to make a film that deservedly won fame as the best adaptation of Dickens' novel (Utilov, 1961: 15).\n\nTrue, in the film The Million Pound Note (UK, 1953), despite the fact that the scriptwriter of the film approached the film adaptation of Twain's work with great tact, retaining all the main plot points of the story,\" and \"the film retained the satirical nature of the story, aimed at condemning the power of money in a capitalist society (Vilesov, 1960: 7), an overly sentimental interpretation of the plot was noticed.\n\nOf course, the magazine could not but respond to such large-scale hits of the Soviet film distribution as War and Peace (Guerra e pace. USA-Italy, 1956) by King Vidor and Spartacus (USA, 1960) by Stanley Kubrick.\n\nWith regard to the film adaptation of War and Peace, it was rightly noted that in this picture one can feel a relatively careful attitude to the text of L.N. Tolstoy, especially in family scenes. A number of episodes relating to the life of Natasha Rostova are distinguished by lyricism and psychological truthfulness. ... However, in comparison with the grandiose epic canvas of Tolstoy, the film loses significantly (Voina ..., 1959).\n\nA deep analysis of the historical drama Spartacus (USA, 1960) was given on the pages of the Soviet Screen by film critic Y. Khanyutin (1929-1978). He wrote that in Spartacus \"directing, albeit without special insights, but confident and strong, the work is professional and clean. ... a brilliant cast quartet of Kirk Douglas, Laurence Olivier, Charles Lawton and Peter Ustinov. Yes, all this is a magnificent and exciting spectacle! But it's not just a spectacle. ... From the very concept of \"gladiator\" poetic veils are removed, and the authors show the school of gladiators as a prototype of modern slavery. The director and screenwriter discover the mechanism of violence, methods that turn a person into a slave, methods that have survived without much change from ancient times to the present day. ... Crassus, played by Laurence Olivier, is the most interesting figure in the film. There is clarity of purpose, inflexibility and intelligence in this man with thin lips and a heavy gaze. In him -the individuality is so large that even Spartacus loses next to him - Kirk Douglas, but not to mention Gracchus. ... But Spartacus is not inferior to Crassus. This is the only person for whom Crasse feels keen curiosity, fear and even envy. Fear, for he is a god as long as he is worshiped. Envy, because he, Crassus, can force you to obey, but he cannot command you to love yourself. ... The pathos of the film is in a clear sense of the connection of times. He not only restores history, but also learns from it. Therefore, the picture has become something more than just a picturesque spectacle from Roman life with indispensable and inevitable Hollywood clichés\" (Khanyutin, 1967: 16-17).\n\nIdeologically very important for the Soviet film distribution was the film by S. Kramer Judgment at Nuremberg (USA, 1961). And film critic T. Bachelis (1918-1999) rightly wrote that in this movie shot without any directorial or camera effects, with calm, sober and tough realism ... veracity is elevated to the law and brought to the magic of documentary.\" ... It is known that fascism relies on the philistine environment, using for its demagoguery the everyday needs and interests of the masses. The novelty of the film Judgment at Nuremberg - in the study of the nature of fascism, its psychology, in the assertion that fascism exploited not only base and dirty, but sometimes high motives of people, relied not only on philistine instincts, but also speculated on such concepts as patriotic duty and law. He, this \"ordinary fascism\", hides in every atom of injustice; it nests wherever people deceive themselves into thinking that the political end justifies the means. Such a reminder is more than timely, and it somehow resonates with excitement, the exciting interest with which we watch the film Judgment at Nuremberg (Bachelis, 1966: 16-17).\n\nThe unconditional support of the Soviet Screen was also received by Arthur Penn's socio-critical drama The Chase (USA, 1966): \"Where is America going? Who will be next? Where are the origins of the cruelty and violence that has been cultivated for so long in the United States of America and for which now one has to pay so tragically? These questions are now being asked by more and more people in the United States, and more and more often American cinematography is trying to find answers to them\" (Fedorova, 1968: 15).\n\nPositively viewed on the pages of the magazine and the anti-racist theme in the drama One Potato, Two Potato (UK-USA, 1964) (Karaganov, 1964: 18-19; Lishchinsky, 1965).\n\nAnd in relation to the film The Road Without End (The Shiralee. Great Britain, 1957), it was noted with satisfaction that the authors conceived the film as a psychological drama, the action and meaning of which are closed in a narrow circle of experiences of several people. But their desire to realistically show the fate of an ordinary person led to the fact that the film outgrew the idea, turning into a story about ... an unemployed tramp. Social motives burst into the chamber plot (Skalova, 1959: 13).\n\nThe realism of the social theme was noted in the Soviet Screen and reviewers of dramas The Luck of Ginger Coffey (USA-Canada, 1964) (Karinskaya, 1966: 19), Left, right and center (UK, 1959) (Demin, 1965: 19-20), This Sporting Life (UK, 1963) (Galanov, 1963: 16-17).\n\nThe film Hell Drivers (Great Britain, 1957), popular with Soviet viewers, received an assessment in the magazine with a pronounced Marxist approach: \"The film looks tense. In front of the camera lens, there was material that was fertile for an action movie: roaring trucks, various fights, distorted faces of villains ... All this was edited with great cinematic skill. ... But it is sincerely a pity that the rich arsenal of cinematic means was put into action without deep thought, without a serious analysis of life phenomena, and therefore without any benefit. ... the authors of the film came close to serious accusations. Revealing the methods of brutal exploitation and outright fraud, they could and should have taken the last step - to call it the essence of the capitalist system. And then the meaning of their work would become honest and revealing. But the machination ... turned out to be only an outline of an adventure plot that drowned out the social sharpness\" (Loktev, 1960).\n\nAbout entertaining American and British films, Soviet Screen wrote much less often. But to pass by the comedies Roman Holiday (USA, 1953) and Only girls in jazz (Some Like It Hot. USA, 1958) magazine, of course, could not.\n\nCuriously, about Roman Holiday (USA, 1953) in the Soviet Screen a kind of discussion arose.\n\nOn the eve of the release of Roman Holiday in the Soviet film distribution, a warm review was published in the magazine, which stated that in this comedy lyricism and subtle humor are intertwined ... with the motives of social satire. Realistic, lively scenes from the everyday life of the Romans, deeply humane images of ordinary people are opposed by the world of an arrogant and spiritually empty aristocracy, served in the techniques of the grotesque, caricature. ... Roman Holiday once again confirmed the great skill and talent of William Wyler (Dobrokhotov, 1958).\n\nBut already after the release of Roman Holiday (USA, 1953) in the all-Union distribution, screenwriter and film critic M. Bleiman (1904-1973) caustically (but, based on the genre of this now classic film - completely unfounded) emphasized that in this movie has one thing that makes it not only ridiculously old-fashioned, but falsely propagandistic. Wyler not only defends the right to love for his heroine, He also pities the poor representative of the royal family (Bleiman, 1960: 14-15).\n\nFive years later, film critic Y. Khanyutin (1929-1978) spoke rather sourly about the famous musical My Fair Lady (USA, 1964): recognizing that the film has staged scope, brilliant colors, stereo sound\", he lamented that \"Shaw's irony, Lowe's poetic music dissolved in the ponderous monumentality of the production (Khanyutin, 1965: 14-15).\n\nBut play/screenwriter Victor Slavkin (1935-2014) took the comedy Some Like It Hot (USA, 1958) much more favorably, noting that the film was based \"as old as the genre of comedy itself, the trick of dressing a man as a woman has been laid down. ... The film would have been sugary in American style if the authors hadn't added a rather strong dose of parody to it. They not only tell us a banal story, but also have a great laugh at it. That's what makes the movie really interesting. So, the plot itself is banal. But the way it is told makes us smile, giggle, laugh and cry with laughter for an hour and a half. With each frame, the stamped frame is overgrown with a tie of funny clutches and unexpected twists. ... By the way, about ... ambiguity. The filmmakers are constantly walking along the wire, risking every second to fall into the abyss, where bad taste and vulgarity await them. But the skillful, ironic acting of Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, Joe Brown, the charm of Marilyn Monroe, the clarity of directing (Billy Wilder) and the wit of the script help to balance on a thin wire\" (Slavkin, 1966: 19).\n\nIn connection with the re-release of the musical melodrama The Great Waltz (USA, 1938) in the Soviet film distribution, the reviewer of the Soviet Screen noted that in this picture talented cinematographers, artists splendidly recreated the spirit of the composer's work, revealed the world of his images (Skazki... , 1960). But melodramatic Rhapsody (USA, 1954) reproached that film's creators sometimes begin to savor Louise's secular manners, her outfits, the life of a wealthy family... Here vulgarity comes into the picture (Skazki..., 1960).\n\nAnd the American film adaptation of Mark Twain's The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (USA, 1960) received a completely negative assessment in the Soviet Screen, since the reduction of the most important and key Twain scenes (for example, ridiculing the American aristocracy, scourging shameful relic of \"blood feud\") and the exorbitant expansion of others ... was by no means accidental. Everything revealing, which is the main value of the novel, is removed; everything purely entertaining, devoid of any social significance, is expanding (Nikolaeva, 1962: 19).\n\nOn June 18, 1962, the Western of John Sturges The Magnificent Seven (USA, 1960), which was destined to become the highest grossing Western film on Soviet screens: 67.0 million viewers in the first year of film distribution alone. This movie eventually managed to get ahead of all other American and European hits, including Spartacus (63 million viewers), Mackenna's Gold (63 million viewers), and others. Only Mexican Yesenia managed to achieve the best attendance figures among foreign films in the USSR.\n\nSoviet Screen responded to the rental triumph The Magnificent Seven (USA, 1960) article by film critic E. Kartseva (1928-2002), in which this movie received a mixed assessment.\n\nOn the one hand, E. Kartseva noted that the film ... is distinguished by good directing, talented acting, excellent filming. The wide screen, color and huge depth of the frame recreate with our own eyes the pictures familiar to us from childhood from books. ... The Magnificent Seven differs in many ways from most empty and meaningless Westerns, where a brave, white-toothed cowboy will certainly emerge victorious from the most difficult and risky situations, receiving the title of an \"honest\" person and his beloved girl as a reward. The film almost does not feel that touch of well-being and optimism, which has always been characteristic not only for \"westerns\", but also for the entire bulk of Hollywood production. Therefore, it is no coincidence that the film lacks a traditional happy ending. ... The main conflict lies here not in the familiar primitive scheme of opposing \"good\" and \"bad\" bandits, but in the moral duel of the peasants with the \"knights of fortune\". And the fact that the peasants are the winners is very significant. Perhaps none of the \"Westerns\" known to us has risen to such a critical look at its bandit heroes (Kartseva, 1962).\n\nBut on the other hand, E. Kartseva \"party\" reminded the readers of the magazine that elements of the standard for\" Western ideology are absolutely unacceptable for us. ... Works that voluntarily or unwittingly promote cruelty and murder are spiritual food alien to us. N.S. Khrushchev rightly said this in his conversation with American journalists. If we talk about the educational role of this film, then it can do more harm than good to young people (Kartseva, 1962).\n\nThe opinions of the reviewers of the \"Soviet Screen\" about French and Italian films shown in the Soviet box office\n\nThe Soviet Screen's approach to French and Italian films that got into Soviet distribution was standard for those years: articles and reviews praised films for \"criticism of bourgeois society\", for \"humanism and faith in humanity\", for \"a call to fight for workers' rights\" and anti-war pathos (Bozhovich, 1960: 12-13; 1967: 14-15; Esli..., 1957: 7; Ilinskaya, 1959; Khanyutin, 1961; 1956; Kozintsev, 1959: 4-5; Kuznetsov, 1965: 2-3; Loktev, 1965; Lvov, 1960: 16; Novogrudsky, 1958: 4; Orlov, 1959; Roof, 1958: 5; Sher, 1960: 17; Tokarevich, 1960: 14-15; 1961, etc.) and scolded for \"thoughtless entertainment\", \"bad taste\", \"propaganda of the bourgeois way of life\" and so on (Orlov, 1966: 14-15; Vladimirov, 1960, etc.).\n\nOne of the first weeks of foreign cinema (in this case, French) was held in Moscow in 1959. Almost all the films presented on it were later released to Soviet distribution: Marie-Octobre (France, 1958), The Lovers of Montparnasse (Montparnasse 19/Les Amants de Montparnasse. France -Italy, 1957), The Hunchback of Notre Dame (Notre-Dame de Paris. France-Italy, 1956).\n\nIn this regard, the film critic S. Komarov (1905-2002) published a review article in the Soviet Screen, where he spoke very positively about all these films (Komarov, 1959: 12-13).\n\nThis high appraisal of French films of the 1950s was also supported in further \"thaw\" publications of the Soviet Screen.\n\nThus, it was emphasized that in Les Misérables (Die Elenden. France-Italy-GDR, 1958), the authors carefully, with great love transferred the novel to the screen. They managed, without overloading the action with an abundance of details, to select all the most interesting and necessary to characterize the era, the main and secondary characters. The image of Jean Valjean was recreated with remarkable skill by one of the greatest French actors, Jean Gabin (Les Misérables, 1960: 15).\n\nAnd Marie-Octobre (France, 1958) by J. Duvivier is only at first glance, a filmed performance, but in fact, the dialogue is extremely cinematic, the word is inseparable from plasticity. The action would be incomprehensible without close-ups, without details, without a duel of eyes, without that complex mini-film dramaturgy that is peculiar only to cinema. ... An interesting film created by talented masters of French cinema (Manevich, 1960).\n\nSoviet Screen reacted with great enthusiasm to the film If All the Guys in the World... (Si tous les gars du monde. France, 1956), which became a major event in world progressive cinema. ... Immediately after the screenings, viewers of six cities exchanged impressions of the film with each\n\nother over the radio. Muscovites who were sitting in the \"Udarnik\" cinema expressed their opinion and heard a voice from [Paris, New York and Oslo]. All the movie was highly rated...The director of the film, Christian-Jacques, also spoke on the radio call. ... The idea of international solidarity of the \"steam room of the whole world\", people of good will, who joined their efforts in the name of saving human lives, found an exceptionally vivid artistic embodiment in the film, convincing with its artless simplicity and truthfulness of life (Esli..., 1957: 7).\n\nThe magazine emphasized with satisfaction that in Rue des Prairies (France-Italy, 1959), director Denis de la Patelière managed to visually show those forces, those methods that the modern capitalist world uses to conquer and subjugate the morally unstable part of the working youth. ... Patelière has a fixed, observant look. He seeks and always finds the smallest and smallest touches that make his heroes alive, close and understandable people (Lvov, 1960: 16).\n\nEvaluating the film Sky above (Le ciel sur la tete. France-Italy, 1964) film critic Y. Khanyutin (1929-1978) wrote that he is about the responsibility of people who have received the most terrible weapon of destruction in their hands. The hero of Sky Above is an aircraft carrier - a perfect work of technical thought - stuffed with electronics, automation and... nuclear bombs. ... Technology is smarter than man. It is possible that among a number of correct and indisputable thoughts of Ciampi about the responsibility of people for the fate of the world, about the dangers of suspicion, there was also a bitter thought about the discrepancy between the pace of technical progress and the pace of spiritual aesthetic development (Khanyutin, 1965: 14-15).\n\nIn the film Tamango (La rivolta dell'esperanza. France-Italy, 1958), the reviewer of the Soviet Screen emphasized the anti-colonial theme: The work was made by the hands of a master who has a clear worldview, who sees in film art a powerful means of fighting for a better future for peoples. Tamango will not leave our audience indifferent. This film makes more real, more tangible and understandable those events in the life of the African continent, which each of us learns from the telegrams of TASS correspondents and newspapers (Sher, 1960: 17).\n\nBut film critic V. Bozhovich (1932-2021), even in the psychologically subtle autobiographical drama by François Truffaut The 400 Blows (Les Quatre cents coups. France, 1959) emphasized the \"anti-bourgeois orientation\": the linking of facts and events does not play a significant role in this film. The main thing is the subtle psychological elaboration of images, the accuracy of details, the richness of life observations and the agitation of the authors, which gives the work some special tender and painful penetration. Gradually, without intrusive frontal techniques, the authors of the film - director Francois Truffaut and screenwriter Marcel Moussy - reveal to the viewer a picture of a bourgeois society in which lies, hypocrisy and indifference have become the norm of human behavior. They reflect, but do not reason, ask, but do not teach. And they offer the viewer to take part in solving the question: Who is to blame? Who is to blame for the fact that, in general, a good boy, striving for people, for love, for human warmth, is torn out of society, turned into a criminal, doomed to loneliness? The film does not answer this. ... But first of all, I would like to talk about the most important thing. And the main thing in this film is the idea, humanity, concern for the fate of people and society (Bozhovich, 1960: 12-13).\n\nTurning to the analysis of the works of Italian cinematography, the reviewers of the Soviet Screen during the \"thaw period\" supported neorealist films with great enthusiasm (Krysha, 1958: 5; Novogrudsky, 1958: 4; Orlov, 1959; Solovyova, 1960: 18; Tokarevich, 1961; Trombadori, 1960: 10-11 and others).\n\nIn particular, the films Umberto D (Italy, 1952) and The Roof (Il Tetto, Italy-France, 1956) by Vittorio De Sica (Asarkan, 1965: 16; Krysha, 1958: 5), The Year Long Road (La Strada lunga un anno. Italy-Yugoslavia, 1957) by Giuseppe De Santis (Orlov, 1959), Generale Della Rovere (Il Generale della Rovere. Italy, France, 1959) Roberto Rossellini (Tokarevich, 1961), The Machinist (Il Ferroviere. Italy, 1955) Pietro Germi (Novogrudsky, 1958: 4), The Job (Il Posto, Italy, 1961) Ermanno Olmi (Rassadin, 1963), Piece of the Sky (Un Ettaro di cielo/Un morceau de ciel. Italy-France, 1958) (Zorky, 1962: 20), Rome at 11 o'clock (Roma ore 11. Italy-France, 1952) (Loktev, 1965), etc.\n\nIn particular, film critic and poet V. Orlov (1929-1972) argued that The Year Long Road leads to the emergence of a new, powerful image - image of the people, the builder of the road ... [this] is a great, deep, true work\" (Orlov, 1959). And the journalist A. Asarkan (1930-2004), reviewing Umberto D, wrote that \"great art always brings joy, even when it comes to sad things\", and this \"film is truthful, hard , distinct (Asarkan, 1965: 16).\n\nThe film critic A. Novogrudsky (1911-1996) noted that at the same time, neorealist cinema is characterized by a certain limitation of ideological horizons: fixing individual pictures of life, noting certain facts of social injustice, the films of Italian directors usually do not indicate a way out of that kingdom of evil, which they so temperamentally and passionately condemn (Novogrudsky, 1958: 4).\n\nAnd the theater and film critic I. Solovieva emphasized that the film by Luigi Zampa The Judge (The All of Us Are Guilty/Magistrate. Italy-Spain, 1959) is already academic neorealism. It seems as if the search and the crisis have passed by this calm and conscientious director. There is no piercing feeling of the truth being discovered for the first time, there is no passionate excitement of the artist who turned to this truth. Behind the characters and events of the film, it seems, is not so much life as the film school and its requirements. And truthfulness also exists here as a requirement of the school. ... The story, banal and tragic, is told in Zampa's film with enough freshness of observations, told with talent. ... This is a picture conscientiously made in the best traditions. Having said this, you will quite accurately determine its shortcomings and its advantages (Solovieva, 1960: 18).\n\nThe film The Man in Short Pants (LAmore più bello/L'uomo dai calzoni corti/Tal vez mañana. Italy-Spain, 1958) also received an ambiguous assessment in the magazine. Noting that this picture was shot at the level of the best works of Italian cinema, the reviewer wrote, for all that, the desire of the audience to find out whether Salvatore's mother is worthy of love is natural. However, the authors evade the ethical assessment of her crime against morality and do nothing to ensure that the spectator himself makes the verdict. And the belated repentance of the mother, and the sudden determination, and the break with her husband, and the lightning-fast reconciliation, all this is \"compassionate\", sugary, sentimental and in many ways spoils the overall good impression of the picture (Dmitriev, 1960: 15).\n\nAnalyzing the films Marriage Italian Style (Matrimonio all'italiana/Mariage à l'italienne. Italy-France, 1964), Boom (Il Boom. Italy, 1963) and Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow (Ieri, oggi, domani/Hier, aurjourd'hui et demain. Italy-France, 1963), film critic T. Bachelis (1918-1999) noted that you can no longer call them neorealistic - they resemble rather a brisk sale of neo-realist jewels at not too high prices. Nevertheless, the first love of Italian cinematographers gave their art the strongest, tangible impetus for development to this day. Even today, Italian cinema enters into a sharp, internally dramatic relationship with reality, with the life of today's Italy. True, he no longer peers as intently as before into this life, into its details, into everyday life, in a fluid and changeable everyday life. On the other hand, he claims - sometimes quite justifiably, relying on a great experience of knowledge and on the energy of a generalizing thought - to comprehend the very meaning of modernity, to express in the most acute and distinct form that feeling of a painful crisis that permeates artists and which they would like to overcome (Bachelis, 1966: 16-17).\n\nBut Seduced and Abandoned (A Matter of Honor/Sedotta e abbandonata/Séduite et abandonee. Italy-France, 1964) by Pietro Germi, according to T. Bachelis, was the closest thing to neo-realism, to its ideas and forms ... Comedy, witty and funny, a little bitter. The taste of bitterness, and also, perhaps, the place of action - Sicily, beloved and glorified by neorealists, the poorest and wildest land of Italy - makes one recall the former, now perceived as classics films by Germi ... But still, in the end, there remains a feeling of some kind of annoyance. Germi makes us laugh at the misfortune. He does it gracefully and deftly. But Stefania Sandrelli, who plays Agnese with a boisterous temperament and genuine pain, nowhere laughing at her character, seems to object to the director and reminds him of the times when neither grief nor the shame of Sicily were laughed at, when the tragedy of a wounded love did not become an occasion for funny comedy, even if made with skill and talent (Bachelis, 1966: 16-17).\n\nTrue, the literary critic and film critic M. Kuznetsov (1914-1980) Boom (Italy, 1963) received a much more positive assessment on the pages of the Soviet Screen: In terms of its visual means, the film Boom is emphatically modest. And what the deepest tragedy of the individual in the modern Western world is revealed here, how brazenly, but at the same time, decently unrespectable inhumanity marches in the picture! Here is an example of how everyday squabbles are raised to tragic heights by the forces of real art, an example of how cinema can look deeply into the life of society (Kuznetsov, 1965: 16-17).\n\nThe same M. Kuznetsov spoke highly of the drama The Women at War Camp Followers (Le Soldatesse/Des filles pour l'armée. Italy-France-Yugoslavia, 1965) by Valerio Zurlini, who received the Golden Prize of the Moscow International film festival: This is a strong, direct, cruelly\n\ntruthful picture, the fire of true art burns in it. Started almost in a frivolous spirit, a story about a \"transport of love\" moving in the days of the war with live goods for soldiers' brothels, this film story soon grows into a harsh story about trampled and monstrously perverted human relationships, about grossly mutilated destinies. ... That is why this film, full of deep truth, merciless denunciation, excellent direction and acting skills, was so warmly received at the festival (Kuznetsov, 1965: 3).\n\nQuite often, the \"thaw\" Soviet Screen wrote about French and Italian melodramas that do not pretend to the philosophical depth of film images: The Blonde Witch (La Sorcière, La Haxan, France-Sweden, 1955) (Warszawsky, 1959), The Naked Maja (La Maja desnuda. Italy-France-USA, 1958) (Kartseva, 1968: 16-17), Anatomy of a Marriage (La Vie conjugale/La vita coniugale. France-Italy, Germany, 1963) (Kuznetsov, 1965: 16-17), etc.\n\nFor example, film critic J. Warszawsky (1911-2000) spoke rather reservedly about the favorite of Soviet viewers of the late 1950s - The Blonde Witch (La Sorcière, La Haxan. France-Sweden, 1955), reproaching her for being too free interpretation of the prose of the classic of Russian literature: \"The plot of the film is built in a lively, exciting way. . The film was made skillfully and conscientiously. But what was it made for? ... How much richer in thoughts and feelings is Kuprin's story! ... The content of the film is only superficially similar to Kuprin's story -cordial, warm, touching readers \"for the living\" ... Marina Vlady draws the image of her heroine with spectacular, but cold colors. She is beautiful, capricious, but where is the power of love in her, which raises the well-known Kuprin Olesya to such a proud height! This is what we will not find in the film ... Kuprin was carried away by the poetry of love, the authors of the film - the unusual amusing position in which the hero found himself. Here is the boundary between Kuprin's idea and the imagination of the filmmakers. That is why we can accept André Michel's film only as a curious experience of film adaptation \"on the theme of Kuprin\" - an experience far from the poetic work of a great Russian writer\" (Warszawsky, 1959).\n\nBut film critic Y. Khanyutin (1929-1978) treated the adventure melodrama Angelica, Marquise of Angels (Angélique, marquise des anges. France-Italy-Germany, 1964) with depressing seriousness: \"The creators of Angelica, Marquise of Angels, having made an excursion into distant French history? Brave cavaliers, splendidly wielding swords, fatal passions, secret passages of the Louvre, gloomy intrigues of the court, and with all this - the demonic, seductive in his ugliness Count - Hossein and dazzling in her luxurious robes, and especially without them, young Angelique - Mercier. But ... nevertheless, this is a document of time, if not the past, then the present. . that the desire to distract the viewer coincides at some point with his need to be entertained, is this not an important and disturbing message from the ship of modernity?\" (Khanyutin, 1965: 14).\n\nTo the melodrama Anatomy of a Marriage (La Vie conjugale/La vita coniugale. France-Italy-Germany, 1963), the literary critic and film critic M. Kuznetsov (1914-1980) reacted warmer, but with obvious sadness of nostalgia: It attracts the artistic technique itself: first, the whole story appears as a story of a husband, and then all the same events are drawn through the eyes of a wife. From this it was possible to make a funny farce, an elegant comedy, but director André Cayatte created a psychological drama not without merit. There is humanity, warmth in the picture, there is a captivating authenticity of acting - Jacques Charrier and Marie- José Nat, there are many subtle and accurate observations. ... All this is true. But again, a feeling of slight disappointment does not leave you: the whole drama of married life revolves somewhere \"around\" deep life problems ... Yes, nice, yes, \"talented in places\", however - shake - does not shake. ... In it, in this film, there was a strangely predominant note of some kind of lethargy, timidity - in the approach to life, in artistic decisions, in daring, finally ... As if we were facing the art that we knew, the same a glorious tradition, a manner... And at the same time - something like a lower class, weaker, somehow faded (Kuznetsov, 1965: 16-17).\n\nBut about the melodramatic musical The Umbrellas of Cherbourg (Les Parapluies de Cherbourg. France-Germany, 1964), crowned with the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nFirst, one of the leading ideologists of the then Soviet film criticism, A. Karaganov (19152007), having visited the Cannes Film Festival, lamented that the jury had awarded the main prize to The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, but this film, alas, is very far from the problems that are now worrying the people viewer (Karaganov, 1964: 18-19).\n\nM. Kuznetsov (1914-1980) approached this masterpiece of Jacques Demy, although warmer, but sour, emphasizing that The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a modern opera, more of a film opera,\n\nthe characters are from today's life, the usual everyday conversation is set to music, the plot is a modest everyday drama... Really, it's curious! And something happened. There is a kind of grace in the film, an atmosphere of quiet sadness. What else? They say that there is also a thought: they say, although the heroes achieve the bourgeois ideal - wealth, but there is no happiness, love is also needed. It is possible that this thought will be able to be subtracted, excuse me - \"to look out\" in this sweet, but, alas, extremely shallow film. After all, despite the deliberately bright colors, he is all kind of internally faded, the stamp of artistic anemicity, thinness lies both in directing and in acting ... And not at all because the authors prefer halftones, want to speak softly, take mediocre characters (Kuznetsov, 1965: 16-17).\n\nAnd only film critics M. Dolinsky and S. Chertok, in our opinion, adequately assessed this film, based not on stereotypical ideological approaches, but on the features and logic chosen by the authors of the genre and style: There is such a kind of literature - a poem in prose. Jacques Demy filmed The Umbrellas of Cherbourg as a poem in music and color. The coloristic solution of this picture with bold, bright spots of carmine, crimson, ocher on a lilac-black background, a picture where the air itself seems to change shades every minute, resembles, although it does not repeat, does not imitate, the canvases of the Impressionists. ... The poet always sees the world in his own way, for him the word \"sadness\" is not only herself, but all the infinite richness of human feelings is in it. This film is full of sadness. And, without being imbued with it, without trusting the poetry contained in each frame, one can, as if hearing everything, hear nothing. And then a cold analysis will come into play, easily revealing in the plot both unoriginality, and sentimentality, and a certain isolation. And then algebra will kill harmony, destroy the fragile world of poetry, dissipate the charm.\n\nThe Soviet press has already written about the film The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. This picture was reproached for its intimacy, reproaches, to be honest, strange, because, going this way, one can also complain about Pushkin, who wrote \"I remember a wonderful moment ...\" too intimately, only about love. It was even said that Demy's film is asocial, that the hero who goes to the Algerian war could just as well go on a trading business: after all, this war is only named, but there is no wide public background in the picture.\n\nIt really does not exist, because the task was completely different. And does anyone have the right to demand from the delicate canvases of Renoir the battle scale of Delacroix's canvases, from the lyrics - the properties of the epic? ...\n\nThe film simply would not exist if it did not combine text with music. He is the first step into an unexplored area. Demy brilliantly proved in practice the possibility and legitimacy of the existence on the screen of such a conditional genre as a film opera, destroying the speculative theoretical constructions of his opponents. . The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is a film opera in its purest form, where both the laws of the screen and the laws of music are observed and correlated with the same tact. No, the rigid standards of rationalism do not apply to poetry and music. This movie should be watched with an open mind. He must be trusted (Dolinsky, Chertok, 1966: 12-13).\n\nBut the next musical by Jacques Demy - The Young Girls of Rochefort (Les Demoiselles de Rochefort. France, 1966) - was, in our opinion, quite reasonably perceived by T. Bachelis (19181999) without enthusiasm: Accepted to think that pure entertainment is bad in principle. Jacques Demy and composer Michel Legrand, the authors of the charming, elegant film The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, apparently undertook to refute this current opinion when they created The Young Girls of Rochefort - a three-hour mass gala performance with dances and songs in delicate pink, yellow, bluish tones. ... All this would be nice if it were not so treacherously long and - again. Demy decided to develop the wonderful findings of the Umbrellas on a large scale, and from this alone everything changed. Naivete, repeated twice, runs the risk of seeming stupid. What was so charming and original in The Umbrellas of Cherbourg - their ingenuous lyrics, recitatives, bold colors of painted nature and, finally, captivating melodies that led the dramaturgy of the film, musical and color in nature, all disappeared. The cute, provincial town of Cherbourg has turned into some kind of huge stadium, which is provisionally named the city of Rochefort. It seems to me that there has been an attempt to Americanize the genre, to compete with West Side Story, to make it a French, provincial version. Unfortunately, the variant turned out to be really provincial (Bachelis, 1967).\n\nBut, undoubtedly, the main Western melodrama in the Soviet film distribution of the 1960s was the film by Claude Lelouch A Man and a Woman (Un homme et une femme. France, 1966), as well as The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, which received the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nAnd here the theater and film critic T. Bachelis (1918-1999), in our opinion, very accurately and stylistically exquisitely wrote on the pages of the Soviet Screen that the film A Man and a Woman is filled with love for life, for beauty, sometimes unfinished, into poetry, sometimes sad. ... Lelouch experiences and causes aesthetic pleasure. An operator himself, Lelouch combines the color of the world and its colorlessness, grayish mists in special rh"
