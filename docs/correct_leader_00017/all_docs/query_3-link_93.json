        "text": "I was heading for an intersection on my bicycle when the traffic light turned red, but I decided to race right through it. Three or four other cyclists did the same thing — even though it was a busy Saturday afternoon and the intersection was hardly a quiet one — but there was one guy who dutifully stopped and waited for the green light. He had gray hair and rode a black bike, and I'd seen him before. Not only on his bike, but on many other occasions. It was Wim Kok, our prime minister.\n\nThis was ten years ago, when fear had not yet taken root in the Netherlands; when Theo van Gogh, a film director and contributor to Dutch Esquire, had not yet been assassinated by a Dutch-Moroccan Muslim; when second- and third-generation immigrants from Morocco had not yet connected their frustration to the cries from bearded men with medieval thoughts; when a cunning politician with a bleached tuft of blond hair and an anti-Muslim agenda (Geert Wilders) had not yet won 24 seats in a 150-seat parliament. These were, one could say, happier times.\n\nToday we face a hard new reality. There is less tolerance of outside cultures and lifestyles than at any other time in recent history, with opposition to immigrants reaching an all-time high and Wilders comparing the Koran to Mein Kampf. Harsh economic conditions are giving way to drastic cuts in our foreign-aid budget, which we have historically used to assert ourselves in the world. Our social safety net, our vigorous government funding of the arts, our acceptance of soft drugs, our approach to environmental protection: Much of what has made the Netherlands the very model of a strong, progressive nation-state is under attack. We even kicked the shit out of the Spanish team in the final of the World Cup in 2010. Shame on us.\n\nBut there are signs of hope: Even though the new prime minister is a forty-five-year-old liberal — a \"liberal\" in the Netherlands might be considered \"conservative,\" even right wing, in other areas of the world, including the United States — he has an authentic smile and a good heart. He isn't in a relationship and might be gay — nobody cares — and before entering office, he volunteered as a social-sciences teacher in a racially mixed school in a low-income neighborhood in The Hague every Thursday morning. To this day he still does, euro crisis or not. I like to think he goes there by bike. —Arno Kantelberg, editor in chief, Esquire Netherlands"
