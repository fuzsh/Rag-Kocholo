        "text": "The electoral campaign leading to the elections held on 15 May 2002 was marked by the murder of Mr Pim Fortuyn, a maverick politician who launched his own anti-immigration party in February 2002 after being ousted from the \"Liveable Netherlands\" party. He was killed on 6 May 2002 after giving a radio interview in the town of Hilversum, near Amsterdam. The leader of the Pim Fortuyn List (Lijst Pim Fortuyn-LPF) had been rising quickly in opinion polls and could have been the winner of the elections, according to the polls. He had gained widespread support with his controversial views, including the demand that the Dutch borders be closed to new immigrants, or calling Islam a \"backward\" religion.\n\nAs a result of the murder, the leaders of the other political parties in the race decided that the election should go on but without resuming the electoral campaign.\n\nTurnout in the election was high, with nearly 80 per cent of all registered voters casting ballots.\n\nThe opposition Christian Democrats won a resounding victory in the elections, taking 43 of the 150 seats, while the Pim Fortuyn List came in second, with 26. The centre-left coalition, in power for the past eight years suffered a severe defeat, with the Labour Party of outgoing interim Prime Minister Wim Kok taking only 23 seats, the same number as the allies in the coalition, the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD). The Green Left won 11 seats, the Socialist Party 9, the Left Liberals (D66) 7, and the Christian Union 4.\n\nLabour Party parliamentary leader Mr Ad Melkert resigned after the party lost almost half its seats and was replaced by the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Ms. Jeltje van Nieuwenhoven.\n\nOn 28 May 2002, Mr Frans Weisglas (VVD) was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives. On 4 July 2002, the new coalition government made up of the Christian Democratic Alliance (CDA), the Pim Fortuyn List and the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) was sworn in."
