I wish to change name of one of the main characters. He is Dutch, around 40 years old and needs to have a bit of an international sounding name. Any Dutch people in here who has any names to suggest?

So a man who were born in the late sixties would probably not have been named Sebastian in Holland? If so, would he have a short name? Bastian? Same goes for Alexander? Alex? If someone's name is Willem, what would then his short name in English be? Will?\n\nSabsP\n\nVeteran Member\n\nTime of past OR future Camino\n\nsome and then more. see my signature.\n\nMar 3, 2014\n\n#7\n\nAlex would be the abbrevation. And yes Will for Willem.

I was supposed to walk in September, but now I am to release a book about the Camino in September instead. Funny thing how the Camino provides ... Well, well, the physical path of the Camino will stay.\n\nOk, so off goes Alexander. Is it the same with Sebastian, i.e. Sebastiaan or is it possible to have with one a. Is Peter normally spelled Peter or Pieter, or are that two different names? This guy is typically middle class/upper middle class and very well educated.

I think he had said he had done over 12,000km on the different routes. It seems appropriate that his name be immortalized in a book. On the other hand he was in his sixties, rather than born in the sixties, so perhaps the name wouldn't qualify.\n\nF\n\nFormer member 22438\n\nGuest\n\nMar 3, 2014\n\n#17\n\nThis is a bit of a strange camino question, but here goes:\n\nI have written a book that to a large part take place on the Camino (a bit like The Way but the main character is a woman and a lot younger) and now it is to be published in Sweden to begin with, but who knows what will happen...

But Victor, Willem and Pieter would fit too. All are 60ies names.\n\nPeter is different from Pieter. The first E in Peter in Dutch is pronounced like the A in 'name'. Like German and Scandinavian languages I think. Pieter is pronounced like the English Peter.\n\nAlexander is indeed a Dutch name but no one would call someone Alexander all the time. This would become Alex or Sander. Still, the first name of the Dutch King is Alexander... (so don't do it! )\n\nSebastian would be called Bas. That might be a good one. Short, typical Dutch.\n\nWill isn't really used. It would be Wil or Wim.\n\nArno is the name of the Dutch hospitalero/owner from l'esprit du chemin in SJPdP.... A nice one?\n\nI checked a Dutch internet site, couldn't find the 60 names, but did find the 70 names.

But a lot of Hollands people were not in mind this name was forever...It was for making joke with the French occupier who did'nt understand this words.

That relatively common mistake, comes from the fashion to name Galician restaurants like O'something, to make the name \"cooler\"or more international by imitating the Irish names.\n\nBut, the \"O\" in O Cebreiro is the article \"The\" and so that it doesn't need any apostrophe.

Not a deeper spiritual aim but during the walk more deeper thoughts came up and the camino virus too. So now we will go for the next time within 8 weeks from now.\n\nMaybe because we walked together as a married couple ,enjoying it and having fun, we were not involved in what they say problems from others at all.\n\nMost of the time we met \"happy ?\" people..

Michael will be a very happy chap, since he would hate to call someone Piet\n\nAt times I was quite annoyed when watching The Way, and probably some pilgrims will be upset with my book as well. However, my intention is good - the whole point with the book is making people take a pause and start to think about what they REALLY wish to do with their lives, to make people see that much of what we are doing and how we live, is what society make us think we want and not what we need and wish deep within our souls.\n\nThe book is about this young woman, Emma. All her life she has been striving for more - a better job, better salary, better flat to live in, nice clothing etc. When work is making her ill and stressed out she quits her job and move from Stockholm to London where the man she is in love with lives. Their love affair turns into a disappointment and her life into a misery. When life is as dark as it can be she hears about the Camino de Santiago de Compostela and decides to go. During long days of walking under the fierce July sun she is forced to confront her dark moments and memories from her life and childhood. She meets people from many parts of the world that become very important to her and make her see life in a different perspective. The one month walking holiday in Spain turns out to be not only a physical journey but foremost an inner journey that forces Emma to re-evaluate her life and everything she has ever believed in.\n\nThe book will be out in book stores in Sweden in mid August or beginning of September. If you wish to know more about release dates and so forth you can \"like\" my Facebook writers page (se below). The page is unfortunately only available in Swedish.\n\nwww.facebook.com/camilladavidssonm\n\nThanks for all that has contributed to this thread and make me feel safe with the name change to Pieter. He is a very important character of the book, so a real help for me!!!\n\n/Camilla"
