The two new nominees have been selected to succeed Mr. Wim Dik and Mr. Arie Maas, who both decided to retire from the SB for personal reasons.\n\nMr. Kok has extensive political, industrial and social experience and expertise, both in the Netherlands and in Europe, that is expected to be of great value to TPG. From 1994 until 2002 he was Prime Minister of The Netherlands. Other key positions include his chairmanship of FNV, the largest confederation of trade unions in the Netherlands, from 1973 until 1985 and his position as Minister of Finance from 1989 until 1994. Currently, he is an advisor to the European Commission about the consequences of the enlargement of the European Union with ten new members in 2004.\n\nMr. Dahan, a Dutch citizen who is a permanent resident of the United States of America, has acquired broad executive experience in the Netherlands, The United Kingdom and the USA during his career at Exxon Mobil Corporation, where he was Executive Vice President and Director. Mr. Dahan has a sound knowledge of the US business market, which is expected to be especially beneficial for TPG."
