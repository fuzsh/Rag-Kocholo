        "text": "This is why, since the Second World War, the Netherlands has been the first to throw itself into almost any international alliance – making a radical break with the neutral stance it clung on to in the past.\n\nMembership of the European Union has always been perceived by the Dutch as a good thing. As one of the ‘founding fathers’ of the EU, the Netherlands ensured that its voice was heard by the ‘big boys’ when the club was being set up, and has continued to do so.\n\nHighly dependent on trade for their prosperity, the Dutch realised the importance of the common market and recognised that the Communities provided a safe haven for a small country in international affairs.\n\nGiving up bits and pieces, and gradually chunks, of sovereignty to the greater good – European integration – has hardly ever posed a problem for them.\n\nIf the Dutch government that presided over the summit of Union leaders which completed the Maastricht negotiations had got its way, the EU would have been built on one pillar instead of three.\n\nWhen its federalist proposals were thrown out by everyone else, it was a major blow for Dutch diplomacy.\n\nConsequently, in the run-up to its EU presidency this time (its tenth since the creation of the Union) the government is adopting a more cautious approach.\n\nAlthough almost every presidency has a habit of saying it will not indulge its own national fads and fancies, Dutch ministers are genuinely taking a careful and modest approach – seeking to maximise their influence by adopting a non-aligned position.\n\nFor the second time in the Nineties, responsibility for bringing the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations to a successful conclusion will fall on Dutch shoulders. But even though completing the IGC is the government’s priority, it is not thoroughly convinced that the agreement which emerges from the talks will be dubbed the ‘Amsterdam’ treaty.\n\nFor it is far from certain yet that the negotiations will end at next June’s summit in the city.\n\nGiven this uncertainty, Dutch Foreign Affairs Minister Hans van Mierlo’s presidency programme focuses instead on the EU’s ‘unfinished business’ – preparing for economic and monetary union and enlargement.\n\n“The presidency will put all its efforts into the continuation and, if possible, finalisation of the specific tasks that are required of it. This demands a pragmatic approach. The presidency will be guided in the first place by the agenda determining European reality,” says the document.\n\nIt would be wrong to conclude from this that the EU is a major topic of debate in the Netherlands. It is not. ‘The more Europe, the better’ tends to be the attitude of both the government and the national parliament.\n\nDutch politics are based on a tradition rooted in seeking – and finding – consensus.\n\nClear proof of this can be found within the cabinet itself – the so-called ‘purple’ government under the leadership of Labour Prime Minister Wim Kok, but uniting the blue-coloured liberal VVD, the centre-left party D’66 and the red PvdA Labour Party.\n\nFor the first time since the Second World War, the Christian Democrats find themselves in opposition – but without anything to really oppose.\n\nBig business, as well as organised labour, favours membership of the EU and all that comes from it. After all, the Netherlands is highly dependent on trade.\n\nNor do ordinary Dutch citizens lose any sleep over it.\n\nThere are, however, some exceptions to this rule. There was consternation across the whole country when the French tried to interfere with the Netherlands’ notoriously tolerant approach to soft drugs by producing a document on a common EU drugs policy to be discussed during this weekend’s Dublin summit.\n\nThe dispute it sparked featured on the pages of every Dutch newspaper and, in contrast to its isolation within the Council of Ministers, the Dutch government’s position won widespread support at home.\n\nGiving in to the French and others who had been sniping at Dutch drugs policy since 1995 was simply out of the question.\n\nJust as the Dutch presidency’s future began to look bleak, a diplomatic crisis arising from this sensitive dossier was averted and the Netherlands heaved a sigh of relief.\n\nFeelings about Europe also began to run high when Liberal Party (VVD) leader Frits Bolkestijn questioned whether, instead of handing over endless areas of policy to majority voting in the EU, the Netherlands should fight to hold on to its veto.\n\nEven though this was mild by British or Scandinavian standards, Bolkestijn was criticised for his ‘nationalist’ attitudes and condemned as a Eurosceptic.\n\nIf anything could make the Dutch sceptical, it would be overspending and waste of the EU’s budgetary resources.\n\nThe Netherlands was one of the last countries to approve the Delors II budgetary package after years of parliamentary wrangling over increased contributions.\n\nThe country has, for five years, been a net contributor to the Union budget and its government takes a very tough stance when it comes to authorising extra spending, as Commission President Jacques Santer discovered when he tried to win member states’ support for a shift of resources from the agricultural budget into spending on Trans-European Networks (TENs).\n\nBut while other finance ministers rejected the idea outright, the Netherlands came up with an alternative. It proposed cutting 700 million ecu from the budget for internal policies – nicknamed the ‘playground’ of the European Parliament – and redirecting this money into TENs projects.\n\nAlthough few in the Netherlands could be described as genuine Eurosceptics, an opinion poll published during the summer suggested that ordinary members of the public are less keen on further Union integration than the Dutch government.\n\nThe poll found that a majority wanted Europe to remain as it is now: a Union in which there was close cooperation between member states, but no federalism. Most wanted national vetoes retained for common foreign and security policy issues and said there should be no European army. Only a minority supported deeper EU involvement in employment issues. Most, however, were in favour of EMU.\n\nWhile purses may feel heavier as the Dutch quarter system makes way for euro centimes, the majority of the population does not seem to mind putting up with this in exchange for the extra prosperity offered by the single currency. Even Queen Beatrix has made it clear that she does not mind at all if her picture disappears from coins.\n\nEMU is almost taken for granted. It is seen as a natural necessity. The Netherlands – which has one of the most open economies in Europe and has long adopted a monetary policy which is a mirror image of that pursued by Germany – needs EMU to keep things going.\n\nWhile austerity has only just begun to bite in many member states, 15 years of financial discipline and asceticism have been fruitful – the Netherlands is ready for the single currency.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEconomically, the country is on its way up, growing by 3% in the third quarter of this year compared with the same period in 1995; and unemployment is falling.\n\nDutch enthusiasm for EMU paid off when one of its own won the single currency’s most important job.\n\nWim Duisenberg will succeed Alexandre Lamfalussy as president of the European Monetary Institute next summer and will almost certainly be the European Central Bank’s first president – thanks to the Nederlandsche Bank’s track record of preaching and practising price stability. Duisenberg is a chip off the old German monetary block."
