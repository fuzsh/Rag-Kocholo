        "text": "The resignation a few days ago of the centre-left Dutch premier Wim Kok hardly caused a ripple - he is not actually stepping down until the elections next May and (a lesson for Tony Blair and Gordon Brown?) has micromanaged the succession to a job he has held for 15 years. His mantle falls on the slightly pinker Ad Melkert, parliamentary leader of the Dutch Labour party - a party congress in December permitting.\n\nMr Kok, relatively young and fit, looks likely to emulate his centre-right predecessor Ruud Lubbers and become a candidate for some top-flight international job, perhaps at the EU.\n\nYet his going has wider significance for the centre-left in the UK, as elsewhere in Europe. \"Modernisation\" began in the Netherlands before the Blairites took power; but left modernisers in the Netherlands now give the appearance of intellectual exhaustion, which surely has lessons for the Blairites. It is not that Mr Melkert is doomed to fail. On present evidence, Dutch electors will probably back something not dissimilar to the current coalition between the Labour party, assorted liberal democrats and the free-market centre-right People's party (VVD).\n\nBecause Mr Kok's personal popularity is said to be worth up to 10 seats in the Dutch lower house of parliament, where the VVD is already strong, it does, however, look like the centre-right will take the lead. Perhaps the very swap-ability of the parties is the point - people no longer know how to distinguish us from the conservatives, one of Mr Kok's lieutenants says.\n\nDuring recent months the belief in the social democratic recipe for marrying social justice and free enterprise has evaporated. Even last week's démarche by French socialist prime minister Lionel Jospin on the so-called Tobin tax had an oddly dispirited, even cynical air to it. The growth cycle has turned down, regardless of the colour of the governments in power in Berlin, Paris, the Hague or London. Suddenly, an intense focus on work as the way out of poverty - a hallmark of social policies in the Netherlands before Labour came to power in the UK - looks risky: what if there are no jobs for poor people to be dragooned or cajoled into?\n\nThere are special Dutch factors. The cabinet nearly split over the engagement of Crown Prince Willem-Alexander with Máxima Zorreguieta, daughter of a controversial former minister in the Argentine junta. The public are in a bad mood: trains do not run on time; hospital waiting lists are up (where have we heard such complaints before?). Fatal fires at a discotheque and a factory led to anguished questions about the competence of the state to inspect and secure its citizens. Sickness benefit payments are booming.\n\nThe growth over which Wim Kok has presided since 1994 is petering out and there is talk of \"stagflation\". It is exaggerated, but a hike in VAT earlier this year did help push inflation up over 5% while employment has faltered - the electronics giant Philips has been cutting thousands of jobs amid a general slowdown.\n\nDutch growth had been impressive - 3.2% a year from 1994-98 compared with the EU's 2.5%; the chart shows employment growth. But the \"polder model\" - relatively strong unions operating within a national compact based on generous welfare provision (what we in the UK used to call the social compact) - is proving no less vulnerable than its neighbours. Dutch growth this year could none the less still outstrip the UK's. Much hinges, as next door in Germany, on the speed of upwards movement in wages. That in turn rests on the compatibility of corporatism with liberal individualism within the same labour market.\n\nThe centre-right says the problem is insufficient flexibility. Dutch Euro-commissioner Frits Bolkestein, formerly a VVD leader, wants the Dutch to move closer to the American model of a smaller state and deregulated labour markets. \"The recent success of the Dutch economy is merely relative to a worse past,\" he says, complaining that the reduction in government spending as a proportion of GDP from 66% in 1985 to its present level of 50% is not enough. Officially, he notes, 13% of the Dutch working population is now disabled. \"If a genuine figure, that would make the Netherlands the unhealthiest place in north-western Europe, although having the highest life expectancy.\"\n\nHe sounds like Tony Blair, one of whose first actions after the June election was to push reform of incapacity payments. Because they have gone some way down this road, Dutch Labour leaders are ambiguous. State secretary Dick Benschop has acknowledged they do not quite know what to do next. \"We must beware of going back to the old positions,\" he says. But what does governing from the left now involve? Pragmatism, as the UK elections showed, is not exactly popular, though rightwing eccentricity is even less so.\n\nPragmatism, as the forthcoming Dutch and Swedish elections may show, could give more moderate rightwing parties an opportunity to return to power. The problem, it is being said within Euro-left conclaves, is not a resurgent right. Despite the Berlusconi victory in Italy there are few signs of that elsewhere. The problem is the old Herbert Morrison cliche about socialism being what Labour governments do. If the principles are only to be inferred from what the Blair (or Jospin or Rasmussen) governments do, they may not amount to much that is coherent or attractive.\n\nWim Kok's departure marks the end of that brief dream of social democratic hegemony when, in the late 90s, the capitals of Europe and the White House were ruled by politicians of mildly progressivist mien. It never amounted to much in terms of coherent foreign or EU policy. As the world economy turns down - the latest IMF forecasts are bleak - it looks like these few years during which the \"third way\" could seriously be talked about as the wave of the future were merely a bubble."
