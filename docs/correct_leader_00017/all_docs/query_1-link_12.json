        "text": "Former social democratic prime minister of The Netherlands between 1994 to 2002. Wim Kok led a coalition of two political opposites: the social democrats of the PvdA and the liberals of the VVD. Prior to becoming prime minister he was minister for Finance. Considered a competent, sincere politician, capable of forging alliances between political and socio-economic adversaries. During his tenure as prime minister unemployment figures dropped and general income levels rose continually, but his governments were unable to stem growing problems in the sectors of healthcare and education. Internationally lauded as proponent of the \"Third Way\", striking a balance between right-wing economic and left-wing social policies.\n\nKok entered politics after he made a career in the labour unions. As chairman of the largest labour union Kok was instrumental in forging a pact between labour unions and employer organisations in 1982.\n\nContentssopgave van deze pagina:\n\nPersonal data\n\nName and surname\n\nWillem (Wim) Kok\n\nDate of birth\n\nSeptember 29th 1938\n\nPlace of birth\n\nBergambacht (The Netherlands)\n\nFamily\n\nW.\n\nKok (father, a carpenter)\n\nN.\n\nde Jager (mother)\n\nM.L.
