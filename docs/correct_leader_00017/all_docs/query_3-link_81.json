        "text": "BANQUET HALL, THE BEEHIVE\n\nMr Prime Minister, Mrs Kok and members of your delegation, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nPrime Minister, I have great pleasure in formally welcoming you to New Zealand.\n\nYou are the first Prime Minister of the Netherlands to officially visit this country.\n\nBut given the misunderstanding which surrounded the visit of your advance party, led by Abel Tasman some 355 years ago, I can understand your delay!\n\nDespite that difficult first encounter, relations between the Netherlands and New Zealand have developed a particular warmth and understanding.\n\nTo be politically correct I should welcome you as the leader of what's been described as a 'purple' three party coalition - and a word of advice - have you checked on how things are at home at the moment?\n\nLast night I announced my intention to step down as Prime Minister after the APEC meeting and a short visit to China - China is a very big country and a short visit could take a little time - but I do plan to be home for the millennium celebrations.\n\nMr Prime Minister, our people have grown close to each other - almost in inverse proportion to the distance that separates us.\n\nAlthough it was a Dutch cartographer who gave these islands the name New Zealand, it was the arrival here of migrants from your country which deepened the bonds between us.\n\nWith the generous assistance of the Dutch Government, the post-war years saw some 28,000 people from the Netherlands gather their possessions and sail to New Zealand, to establish new lives for themselves and their families.\n\nIn doing that they showed great courage and great confidence in themselves, and in offering them a home New Zealand has been repaid many times over.\n\nThe Netherlands' loss was our gain.\n\nDutch migrants to New Zealand, then and now, brought with them skills, energy and determination.\n\nI recall the arrival of many of them into the farming community I grew up in.\n\nYour countrymen and women quickly earned a reputation for hard work and community-mindedness.\n\nThere were some difficulties.\n\nEyes lit up when these strapping young men arrived - the difficulty was in teaching them how to play rugby.\n\nThere are now, Mr Prime Minister, an estimated 70,000 New Zealanders who claim Dutch ancestry.\n\nThere is no facet of New Zealand society to which they have not contributed - be it in manufacturing, science, culture or exports.\n\nI have no doubt that New Zealand and its development is very much the better for this strong Dutch connection.\n\nNext week New Zealanders will be considering the role of immigration as we convene our first ever National Population Conference.\n\nYour visit then is a timely opportunity to mark the importance of the Netherlands' contribution to New Zealand, through immigration.\n\nAs the son of migrant parents myself I have a soft spot for the contribution migrants and their families have made to New Zealand.\n\nOne such Dutch New Zealander will surely end up as Prime Minister one day.\n\nA past Prime Minister of New Zealand, Sir Keith Holyoake, remarked to the UN General Assembly 21 years ago \"we are a multiracial society. We are British, we are Maori. We are Polynesian. We are also Chinese, Danish, Yugoslav, Indian, Dutch and others.\" \"Some\", Sir Keith continued, \"might see this cultural diversity as a liability or as a source of friction. We do not. It is a strength.\"\n\nYet the Netherlands' contribution to New Zealand extends beyond the gift of its migrants here, remarkable though that may be.\n\nDutch corporate investment is also an enduring feature of New Zealand's economy.\n\nTwo Dutch companies stand out as household names in New Zealand.\n\nPhilips have manufactured and distributed a wide range of electronic goods.\n\nI hope I will not be accused of commercial favouritism in saying the name Philips has come to assume a reputation for reliability and safety in the New Zealand market.\n\nAnother Dutch company, Shell Oil, has been active in New Zealand's transport-fuels sector since the 1920s.\n\nShell has also contributed actively to the exploration and development of our indigenous fuels industry.\n\nThese Dutch companies - and others which arrived more recently - underline the success of the Netherlands as a nation of traders and investors.\n\nWe too have learnt that to prosper we have to trade.\n\nMr Prime Minister, I welcome you also as the leader of a nation at the heart of Europe.\n\nThe Netherlands is at the forefront of both the single market in Europe and Europe's outreach to the Asia-Pacific.\n\nPrime Minister, we watch events in Europe closely - for several reasons.\n\nFirst, there are the family and cultural connections, particularly with the British Isles and with the Netherlands.\n\nAnd, despite the diversification of our commerce, the European Union remains a crucially important market, as well as a source of investment and technology.\n\nWe also watch Europe closely as much of our history is written on its battlefields.\n\nBeyond the two World Wars we remain in Europe, this time in Croatia - alongside the Netherlands - making our contribution to international peace and security.\n\nBecause of our experience of war in Europe we regard with hope and expectation the cause of European unity.\n\nThe end of conflict and the creation of an outward-looking European Union committed to peaceful interdependence is very much in the world's interest.\n\nThe Netherlands has been in the forefront of this development.\n\nPrime Minister, your country has shown the world that a small country can be a good regional and global citizen and still retain the essence of a distinctive national identity.\n\nThis is a legacy which we also like to see as our own.\n\nIn many ways we reflect similar views. Our common membership of international forums is a case in point.\n\nWe approach many of the world's problems in a similar way: working for progress in a practical but enlightened fashion.\n\nSome observers have claimed this is simply an alphabetical accident.\n\nThat because the Netherlands and New Zealand sit alongside each other in the UN, and elsewhere, we either swap notes or use the same text!\n\nI think not.\n\nWhat is true is that the fundamental values we hold in common, make it likely that our countries will adopt similar views on such diverse issues as disarmament, human rights, international development and multilateral trade.\n\nIn recent years, our respective regions have undergone significant change.\n\nFor us, the relationship with Australia and with the wider Asia-Pacific region has assumed a new significance, politically as well as economically.\n\nThese are natural developments but not ones that are, or need be, exclusive in nature. In fact the opposite is the case.\n\nThe opening up of the New Zealand economy and its essential global orientations - which of course finds its mirror in the Netherlands - makes it more likely than ever that we will meet and compete - but always as friends - not just in our respective countries but also in the market places of Europe, Asia and elsewhere in this rapidly shrinking world.\n\nBut for the time being, Mr Prime Minister and Mrs Kok, we are very happy that you are here among us as good friends, indeed as family from overseas.\n\nYou are almost a New Zealander now, as we together watched a New Zealand-bred horse win today's Melbourne Cup.\n\nI wish you a very productive visit here and in Australia, and a safe journey home and a safe arrival.\n\nIn today's politics arriving home can be the dangerous part.\n\nENDS"
