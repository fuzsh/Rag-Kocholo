        "text": "(born 1938), Dutch politician. While European nations in the 1990s struggled to reduce inflation and government spending without triggering unemployment and social upheaval, The Netherlands succeeded better than most. Between 1992 and 1997 the Dutch economy grew faster than that of Britain, France, or Germany, with higher employment and less labor unrest. The Dutch success reflected an unusual degree of cooperation among government, employers, and labor unions. Its chief architect was Prime Minister Wim Kok, a former minister of finance.\n\nKok was born in Bergambacht, The Netherlands, on Sept. 29, 1938. He attended the Netherlands School of International Business. After serving in the military and working briefly for a trading company, in 1961 he began a career of more than two decades in labor union administration. Starting as an adviser or assistant international officer for the construction workers’ union, he rose to the position of staff member for economic affairs in 1965 and union secretary in 1967.\n\nIn 1969 he transferred from the construction union to the executive board of the Netherlands Federation of Trade Unions, first as secretary, then as deputy chairman in 1972 and chairman from 1973 to 1985. From 1979 to 1982 he also chaired the European Trade Union Confederation. As the top labor leader in The Netherlands, Kok was instrumental in negotiating an agreement between labor unions and employers in 1982 according to which unions would not demand pay increases of more than 2 percent per year, and employers in return would provide shorter work weeks and more jobs. That agreement set the model for the Dutch style of collaborative economic planning.\n\nKok left trade union work in the mid-1980s for politics as a member of the Labor party. He became a member of parliament and Labor party leader in 1986. Three years later, the same year in which he was elected deputy chairman of the Socialist International, he entered the cabinet in a coalition government headed by Christian Democrat Prime Minister Ruud Lubbers. For nearly five years beginning on Nov. 7, 1989, Kok was deputy prime minister and minister of finance for The Netherlands. He followed a policy of austerity while maintaining the social welfare programs that were most important to workers.\n\nWhen no party won a majority in May 1994 elections, Kok and his Labor party took several months to negotiate a coalition with the Liberals and the Democrats 66. By mid-August they agreed on a program to reduce public spending while meeting key labor demands. The plan would cut public spending by some $10.1 billion over the next four years, lower the minimum wage, trim several taxes, and charge patients part of the cost of using the National Health Service. At the same time, the coalition promised not to reduce government payments for unemployment or disability. The military chief of staff resigned to protest proposed cuts in defense.\n\nKok took office as prime minister on Aug. 22, 1994. The Christian Democrats were left out of the coalition government for the first time in their history. Kok’s economic policy, formulated through a painstaking consensus process, revived the economy without setting off strikes. Employment strengthened. Although one third of the jobs in 1997 were temporary or part-time, even part-time workers received benefits. When European leaders met in Amsterdam on June 16, 1997, analysts advised them to look at the Dutch economy if they wanted to see a model for prosperity with stability."
