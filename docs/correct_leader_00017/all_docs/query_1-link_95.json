        "text": "Seven years after the event, the Dutch government finally admitted yesterday that it could have done more to prevent the slaughter of up to 8,000 Bosnian Muslims at Srebrenica by Serb forces in 1995 and resigned.\n\nWith just under a month to go before general elections, Wim Kok, the outgoing Labour prime minister, signalled that his cabinet had decided that the conduct of Dutch peacekeeping troops and the Dutch government at the time had left the government with no choice but to resign en masse.\n\nQueen Beatrix accepted the cabinet's resignation last night and called for a new caretaker government to be formed to fill the political vacuum until a pre-planned general election on May 15.\n\nMr Kok's position had been fatally weakened by the publication of a damning report from the Netherlands Institute for War Documentation last week which laid much of the blame for the Srebrenica massacres at the door of Dutch politicians. Two members of his cabinet had already indicated that they would resign, piling pressure on the entire government to do the same.\n\nMr Kok, 63, was prime minister at the time of the Srebrenica killings and served as finance minister in the previous administration, which took the ill-fated decision to dispatch peacekeeping troops to the region.\n\nSrebrenica, a flashpoint in the 1992-95 Bosnian war, was designated a United Nations \"safe haven\" but instead became the scene of the most heinous atrocity committed on mainland Europe since the Nazis.\n\nA lightly armed battalion of 110 Dutch troops was supposed to defend 30,000 mostly Bosnian Muslim refugees from advancing Bosnian Serb forces. Outgunned and outnumbered, the troops' resolve cracked and the town was taken without a shot. The resolve of the Dutch cabinet at the time also faltered and it was decided that the soldiers should withdraw and leave the Muslims to their fate.\n\nBosnian Serb forces under General Ratko Mladic then murdered up to 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys in cold blood throwing the bodies into mass graves.\n\nLast week's report ended seven years of investigation. It concluded that Dutch politicians had put prestige before planning and sent poorly prepared troops on an ill-defined \"mission impossible\".\n\nGeke Feber, the Dutch agriculture minister, heard of the resignation of her prime minister while she was presiding over the meeting in the Hague of the Convention of Biological Diversity. As she is a member of the Dutch cabinet, she automatically lost her job.\n\nEarlier, the veteran environment minister Jan Pronk had said he too would resign. He was a member of the cabinet which made the fateful decision to hand the prisoners over. Survivors of the massacres complained yesterday that the Dutch move was too little too late. \"They should have resigned ages ago,\" said Sabaheta Fejzic, 50, who lost her son at Srebrenica. \"They will never wash the guilt off their faces.\"\n\nSo far only one man - Bosnian Serb general Radislav Krstic - has been brought to book over Srebrenica by the UN tribunal in the Hague. He was found guilty of genocide and sentenced to 46 years in prison last year."
