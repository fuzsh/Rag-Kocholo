        "text": "The Netherlands maintains ties with various European countries with a view to consultation and knowledge exchange.\n\nApeldoorn: British-Dutch Dialogue\n\nThe Apeldoorn Conference Series is a bilateral meeting between the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, which was initiated in 1999 by the then Prime Ministers Tony Blair and Wim Kok. The conference provides a platform for business people, academics and politicians to discuss current political and social issues. It has taken place every two years since 2000. In 2004 a Young Apeldoorn Conference was also set up for young professionals under 35. Both conferences are held in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom alternately.\n\nContact\n\nBritish Council Amsterdam\n\n+31 (0)20 550 6060\n\ninformation@britishcouncil.nl\n\nCross-border cooperation\n\nFor over half a century, the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany have worked to improve cross-border cooperation. In 2009 a cross-border cooperation task force (GROS) was set up, comprising representatives of nearly all ministries and border regions, in a bid to solve the most urgent cross-border problems. When a problem is identified, seminars or workshops are organised with neighbouring countries to find solutions that generally involve harmonising legislation or aligning procedures.\n\nThe task force seeks to:\n\neliminate the bureaucratic obstacles encountered by cross-border commuters;\n\npromote the recognition of secondary school diplomas;\n\nfacilitate cross-border transport by train and bus, as well as by ambulance;\n\npromote partnership between hospitals on either side of the border;\n\nfoster cross-border cooperation in crisis management, disaster response and\n\nbetween police and law enforcement authorities in border areas.\n\nDutch-German Conference\n\nThe Dutch-German Conference was established in 1994 by the then German and Dutch foreign ministers, Klaus Kinkel and Pieter Kooijmans. It brings together prominent figures from the worlds of politics, business, science, academe, culture and government with a view to strengthening bilateral ties. It also furthers knowledge of political and social developments by focusing on topical and social issues.\n\nThe conference is organised by a Dutch and a German steering committee and is held every 18 months in the Netherlands and Germany alternately.\n\nContact:\n\nDutch-German Conference Secretariat\n\nc/o Ministry of Foreign Affairs\n\nWestern and Central Europe Department/Western Europe Division (DWM/WE)\n\n+31 (0)70 348 6737\n\ndwm@minbuza.nl\n\nFranco-Dutch Cooperation Council\n\nThe aim of the Franco-Dutch Cooperation Council is to strengthen relations between the Netherlands and France and promote dialogue in a range of areas. Its members are prominent in the fields of politics, the media, scholarship, culture and industry and have a special interest in Franco-Dutch relations. Projects and meetings are set up at various locations, in France and the Netherlands alternately.\n\nThe Council carries out a number of projects:\n\nSince 2004, annual exchanges have taken place between journalists from leading French and Dutch newspapers. These have led to a greater understanding of one another’s work and a better knowledge of the situation in the host country.\n\nSince the establishment of the Council, the annual Erasmus-Descartes Conference has been held in Paris and Amsterdam alternately. The conference themes are both political and scholarly. Every two years, up and coming Dutch and French young people from the the world of business, politics and academe meet to discuss current issues and exchange ideas.\n\nContact (the Netherlands):\n\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs\n\nWestern and Central Europe Department/Western Europe Division (DWM/WE)\n\n+31 (0)70 348 5115\n\ndwm@minbuza.nl\n\nContact (France):\n\nEmbassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in Paris\n\n+33 1 4062 3330\n\npar-pcz@minbuza.nl\n\nHungarian-Dutch Round Table Conference\n\nThe aim of the Hungarian-Dutch Round Table Conference is to enable civil servants, businesspeople and academics to exchange thoughts on a particular theme.

After Poland joined the EU, emphasis shifted to partnership within the Union.\n\nThe Utrecht Conference is held annually and provides a platform for bilateral consultation between various ministries.
