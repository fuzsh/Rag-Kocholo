        "text": "Wim Kok, who has died aged 80, was Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 1994 to 2002, heading a “purple coalition” which legalised same-sex marriage, prostitution and euthanasia, stimulated the economy with tax cuts and pressed ahead with privatisation; on his watch the Treaty of Amsterdam was concluded in 1997, strengthening the institutions of the EU.\n\nA former leader of the Dutch trade union movement who headed the Labour Party for 16 years, Kok was an accomplished negotiator and ran his government well. Christopher Fildes described him (a little unfairly) in The Daily Telegraph as “the latest in a line of renta-Dutchmen who can be relied on to say the anodyne thing and thus become candidates for international posts”.\n\nHowever, his government will always be associated with the most shameful episode in the nation’s recent history: the failure of Dutch troops to prevent – and indeed their facilitation of – the massacre of up to 8,000 Muslim men by Bosnian Serbs in July 1995 in the UN “safe area” of Srebrenica.\n\nDespite clear evidence of murder and brutality, the UN force’s Dutch deputy commander signed a declaration with the Serb Ratko Mladic – later convicted of war crimes – that the Serbs had adhered to “all the regulations of the Geneva Convention”, then drank a toast with him. The troops of his 13th Air Mobile Infantry Battalion flew home to a heroes’ welcome.\n\nThat October, the report of a parliamentary commission exposed the craven way UN officials and Dutch officers had reacted to repeated threats, brutality and harassment from the Serbs by handing over civilians under their protection. It presented a sorry tale of impotence in the face of evil, with UN officials unwilling to discern the obvious through a fog of wishful thinking, and ordinary soldiers cowed by superior force, their morale at rock bottom as the Serbs cut off supplies and refused to let in replacements.\n\nThe UN had declared Srebrenica a “safe area” in April 1993 because of continuing Serb attacks on the Bosnian Muslims. Two years later, enraged by guerrilla raids from the enclave, Mladic decided to wipe it out. The Serbs overran one Dutch observation post after another with minimal resistance, taking 55 hostages. Muslim guerrillas threatened to kill the rest of the force if they gave up the remaining posts.\n\nThe Dutch pulled back to their compound at Potokari, where by July 11 1995 6,000 Muslims, mainly women and children, had taken refuge, with 24,000 more outside. Next day, the Serbs began segregating the sexes in the crowd and taking the men away; the Dutch then handed to the Serbs the people in the compound, including 250 men. Few of the men were heard of again.\n\nKok insisted the report revealed “no question of reprehensible negligence”, saying the troops had had to operate in “barbarian circumstances”. No minister resigned, and the coalition not only survived the revelations, but was re-elected in 1998.\n\nNevertheless, the steady drip of opprobrium took its toll on Kok; he stood down as party leader late in 2001, and further disclosures about the near-cowardice of the Dutch force led him to resign as prime minister with weeks of his term still to run.\n\nIn 1961 he started at the Socialist NVV trade union federation, working his way up to become for 12 years from 1973 its chairman. From 1979 to 1982 he chaired the European TUC.\n\nShortly after the death of General Franco in 1975, Kok had his passport confiscated by plain-clothes police when he tried to attend a 50th anniversary commemoration in Madrid of the death of Pablo Iglesias, the father of Spanish socialism.\n\nEarly in 1977, workers staged a wave of guerrilla strikes across Holland in an effort to break the government’s ceiling for pay claims. Kok declared: “We want to show that we control the Dutch labour force now.”\n\nIn 1982 the NVV merged with its Catholic counterpart after six years of close cooperation to form the country’s largest trade union grouping, the FVV. Kok became its leader, mobilising resistance to what he claimed were the Thatcherite, monetarist policies of Ruud Lubbers’s centre-Right government.\n\nHe stood down as a trade union leader before the 1986 election to enter politics, winning a seat in the Lower House. When Joop den Uyl retired that July after 20 years as Labour leader, Kok took his place, leading the opposition to Lubbers’s government.\n\nWhen the coalition broke up in May 1989, Kok asked Queen Beatrix for a dissolution. Labour went into that September’s election on an anti-nuclear platform: withdrawal of US nuclear weapons from Europe and cuts in Dutch defence spending.\n\nKok made a strong finish to the campaign, but both main parties lost seats. After eight weeks of negotiations Lubbers’s Christian Democrats formed a coalition with Labour, and Kok became deputy prime minister and minister of finance.\n\nIn the run-up to conclusion of the Maastricht treaty, he pressed for member states to dovetail their economic plans as preparation for a single currency. In a snub to Jacques Delors, he insisted that any EC government should be free to opt out, but he also upset Norman Lamont by insisting on the text of the British opt-out being scrutinised line by line.\n\nLubbers retired before the May 1994 elections, at which the Socialists again lost seats but ended with one more than the Christian Democrats. Kok was invited to form a government – breaking off negotiations to attend John Smith’s funeral in Edinburgh – and that August was installed as Prime Minister, heading the first coalition without Christian Democrat participation since 1908.\n\nHe joined John Major in criticising German calls for an exclusive fast-track club at the centre of the EU. He and Prince Bernhard floated the idea of inviting German officials to the 50th anniversary celebrations the following May of Holland’s liberation from the Nazis, but dropped it after an angry reaction from resistance veterans.\n\nKok welcomed the election of Tony Blair’s government in 1997 and was an early disciple of the “third way”. Blair invited Kok to sell the benefits of a single currency to British business, and when in 2000 Blair persuaded the Lisbon EU summit to adopt a radical programme of economic reform, Kok was one of his key supporters.\n\nIn 1999 he was blamed by a parliamentary commission for failing to ensure that the crash of an El Al cargo jet into an Amsterdam apartment block with the loss of 43 lives was adequately investigated.\n\nHis administration was responsible, however, for a succession of liberalising reforms including the full legalisation of prostitution in 2000, of same-sex marriage the year after that, and the passing of the Termination of Life on Request and Assisted Suicide Act in 2002.\n\nKok announced his retirement as Labour leader in December 2001, standing down in favour of Ad Melkert. He intended to remain prime minister until elections in May 2002, but weeks before then a further report on Srebrenica from the Institute of War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies persuaded him he had no choice but to resign.\n\nHe was invited to head a caretaker government until the elections, which produced a centre-Right coalition under Jan Peter Balkenende. Thus it fell to Kok and a makeshift coalition to cope with the fallout from the murder of the ultra-nationalist MP Pim Fortuyn.\n\nOut of office, he headed a group pressing for implementation of the Lisbon strategy, and after Dutch voters’ rejection of the draft European Constitution in 2006 served on the d’Amato Group, which unofficially reworked it as the Treaty of Lisbon – which included Article 50 enabling a nation to withdraw.\n\nKok was president of the Club of Madrid from 2009 to 2013, and a member of the International Commission on Missing Persons and the board of the Anne Frank Foundation. He was vice-chairman of the Netherlands Bank and a director of ING, TNT, Royal Dutch Shell and KLM. He was a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Orange-Nassau.\n\nWim Kok married Rita Roukema in 1965. He adopted two children from her previous marriage, and they had a son of their own.\n\nWillem Kok, born September 29 1938, died October 20 2018"
