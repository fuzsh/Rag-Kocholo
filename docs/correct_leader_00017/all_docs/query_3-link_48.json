        "text": "Singapore Government Press Release\n\nMedia Division, Ministry of Information & The Arts, #36-00, PSA Building, 460 Alexandra Road, Singapore 119963, Tel: 3757794/5\n\nSPEECH BY SINGAPORE PRIME MINISTER GOH CHOK TONG AT DINNER HOSTED IN HIS HONOUR BY THE PRIME MINISTER OF THE NETHERLANDS HIS EXCELLENCY WIM KOK, ON WEDNESDAY, 9 OCTOBER 1996 IN THE HAGUE, THE NETHERLANDS\n\nPrime Minister\n\nMrs Wim Kok\n\nDistinguished Guests\n\nLadies and Gentlemen\n\nMy delegation and I are honoured to be here tonight. I thank you for your warm welcome and gracious hospitality. I am happy to revisit your remarkable country that for centuries has made outstanding contributions in many fields.\n\nIn April 1991 when your former Prime Minister Mr Lubbers came to Singapore, Netherlands was about to assume the EU Presidency at a crucial time of final negotiations for the implementation of the Single European Market, the launching of the Inter-governmental Conference (IGC) on the European Monetary Union (EMU), and the negotiations which led to the Masstricht Treaty.\n\nToday as I return the visit, your country is again preparing to take over the EU Presidency from January to July 1997, again at a crucial time of the final stages of another IGC and the launch of the EMU. I do not think that it is a mere coincidence that the responsibility of the EU Presidency falls on the Netherlands at crucial moments in the history of European construction. Rather it is a reflection of the confidence and trust other EU member states have in the skill and ability of the Netherlands to broker compromise and agreement.\n\nDespite your understandable preoccupation with European affairs in the next few months, Singapore is confident that the Netherlands will not be Eurocentric. You have not been Eurocentric in the last 400 years, or the first Dutch fleet would not have landed in Sumatra, Indonesia, in 1596.\n\nDespite Prime Minister Lubbers' obvious preoccupation with the European tasks ahead in 1991, his message to us in Singapore was about growing global interdependence. He assured us that the EU would continue to be outward looking even with the advent of the Single European Market in 1992.\n\nToday, I heard the same message from Prime Minister Wim Kok. It reinforces our continued confidence that the Netherlands will maintain its outward looking policies despite the expansion and deepening of European integration.\n\nAt the ASEM Summit in Bangkok, Netherlands and Singapore share the aim of fostering closer links between Asia and Europe. Let us maintain the momentum of the Bangkok summit with concrete projects. Singapore has proposed the establishment of an Asia-Europe Foundation (ASEF). This Foundation, which we plan to launch next year after consultations with ASEM countries, aims to promote greater interaction and exchanges between students, academics, researchers, scientists, cultural groups, media people and young leaders from the two regions. The Netherlands, with its strong historical and contemporary links with Asia, can be at the forefront of efforts to develop this greater understanding between Asia and Europe. You have this opportunity when the Netherlands assumes the Presidency of the European Union in the first half of 1997.\n\nAt the bilateral level, Singapore and the Netherlands have much in common, including trade in our blood. Trade accounts for over 80% of the Netherlands' GDP. In Singapore's case, it is 300% of our GDP. The Dutch are recognised as one of the greatest sea-faring peoples and traders of the world, boldly searching for new markets and opportunities. This enterprising and pioneering nature continues to this day. Dutch MNCs, like Philips and Shell, are world leaders in their respective fields. Philips, for example, pioneered CD technology.\n\nWe both play complementary roles in our respective regions. Our strategic locations and excellent ports enable our two countries to use each other as gateways to our respective regions. Singapore provides a regional base through which Dutch companies can test and market their products and services to the Asian region. In doing so, Singapore adds value to Dutch businesses in Asia.\n\nWhile large Dutch MNCs like Shell and Philips are well established in Singapore, Dutch SMEs can also benefit from a presence in Singapore for their regional operations in Asia. The business delegation that is accompanying me is eager to work with their counterparts in your country to identify joint projects in Asia as well as in Europe.\n\nSingapore recognises the Netherlands as a springboard for the European market. Currently, the Netherlands is the 9th largest recipient of Singapore's investments abroad. Your establishment of a Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency Office in Singapore this year will attract more Asian investments to the Netherlands. With world-class ports and strong European-wide transportation networks, the Netherlands can serve as an important distribution hub for Singapore and other Asian companies.\n\nAs nations whose prosperity and survival depend on trade, the Netherlands and Singapore have a common stake in ensuring a free and open world trading system. Singapore will be hosting the first Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation in December 1996. We are working with like-minded countries like the Netherlands to ensure forward movement in the WTO's trade liberalisation agenda.\n\nMr Prime Minister\n\nThe links between Singapore and the Netherlands are deep and strong. Singapore has always had positive feelings towards the Netherlands. We see eye-to-eye on many economic and political issues. There is much potential for synergies between our two economies. I now look forward to working with you to realise our shared vision of a strong Asia-Europe relationship.\n\nLadies and Gentlemen\n\nMay I now ask you to join me in a toast to the continued good health of Her Majesty Queen Beatrix and to peace and prosperity in the Netherlands.\n\n--------------"
