        "text": "AMSTERDAM, The Netherlands (CNN) -- Fritz Wester, political correspondent for RTL in The Netherlands, was in the Dutch parliament to see Prime Minister Wim Kok announce the government's resignation.\n\nQ: Was the mass resignation a surprise?\n\nA: It was a dramatic moment in parliament. We knew Kok was to retire as prime minister at the forthcoming election but we had not expected his career to end in this way.\n\nThe prime minister came to the conclusion after reading the report of the Netherlands Institute for War Documentation that what was said in the report was so serious that he had to take the political consequences.\n\nKok said the international community can't take responsibility for the events in Srebrenica, but I will do so.\n\nMORE STORIES\n\n Dutch PM resigns over Srebrenica\n\nEXTRA INFORMATION\n\nIn-depth: Netherlands Decides 2002\n\nIN-DEPTH\n\nSrebrenica: Five days of evil\n\n Survivor's Story\n\n Gallery\n\n Massacre background\n\n Rebuilding Srebrenica\n\n Prayers for the dead\n\n Grief of the widows\n\n Mass grave found\n\n War crimes defendants\n\n Profile: Radko Mladic\n\n Profile: Radovan Karadzic\n\nRESOURCES\n\nNIOD Report Summary\n\nIt was a dramatic emotional moment from a man at the end of his political career. I think he emerged as a man of honour.\n\nCertainly I think Wim Kok would have wished things to have been different.\n\nQ: There will be elections in The Netherlands in a month. Will Kok's PvdA Labour Party benefit from the move?\n\nA: Maybe the voters will respect the decision of the cabinet and it will improve their standing. It is hard to say at the moment.\n\nThe opposition parties are glad to see the government has fallen. But maybe the voters will remember the resignations and vote for Mr Kok's party.\n\nAt the moment the opposition Social Democrats are ahead with the Christian Democrats second. There is a new (right wing) party Leefbaar Nederland which will have a lot of seats in parliament next time.\n\nThe next government will be a coalition, but the only coalition that looks possible now is betwen the Christian Democrats, the Liberals and Leefbaar Nederland.\n\nQ: What happens next?\n\nA: On Wednesday there will be a debate in parliament on the report. After that the ministers responsible will continue in their jobs until the new coalition has been formed after the elections on May 15.\n\nQ: Is the defence minister from 1995 among those who resigned?\n\nA: Wim Kok was prime minister at the time, of course, but Defence Minister Dr Joris Voorhoove is no longer in the government -- he has a job with an international institute. He is not politically active.\n\nQ: Have there been resignations in the military as well?\n\nA: Some of the generals will lose their jobs within a few months on the grounds that they were responsible for mistakes and cover-ups.\n\nNo one in the military has been sacked yet but some have resigned.\n\nIt is predicted that one general who is chief of the land forces will lost his position very soon now.\n\nQ: Will any of those involved have to face the courts?\n\nA: There will be a parliamentary investigation soon in the summer in which the main players can be asked about their role.\n\nThe Srebrenica affair is sure continue for few months yet."
