Unfortunately, this call for the abolition of private property, which Marx consistently held from early adulthood until the end of his life, is as misunderstood as it is familiar.

That this has not yet been done can be attributed, in large part, to the fact that Marx never clearly formulated or expressly labeled these arguments--all we have are scattered references of varying lengths. Because of this, it must be pointed out that the arguments presented here are \"reconstructed\" from Marx's corpus. This is mainly an interpretative task, one which involves making explicit those arguments which are only implicit in the texts themselves.\n\nIn the first chapter, I shall define Marx's general concept of property. In addition, the key phrase \"the abolition (Aufhebung) of private property\" will be examined. Chapter Two will present the arguments against capitalist private property, while Chapter Three will provide a number of arguments for individual/social property. Indirectly, the latter chapter will also serve as a type of general sketch or blueprint of Marx's vision of post-capitalist society.\n\nChapter Four will be divided into two sections. The first will deal with the recently much discussed question of Marx's concept of justice. There are some Marx scholars, such as Robert Tucker and Allen Wood, who either deny that Marx was ever concerned with criticizing capitalism from the point of view of justice or maintain that his notion was a relativistic one. I shall defend the position held by Ziyad Husami and others that, in fact, Marx did have a concept of justice and that it was non-relativistic.\n\nThe second section will be devoted to a critique of Marx's position on property rights and distributive justice from Robert Nozick, a contemporary social and political philosopher whose view is quite contrary to Marx's. I shall summarize his position on distributive justice and show how it determines his view of property rights. Finally, his views will be compared and contrasted with Marx's, and a defense of\n\nthe latter will be offered.\n\nIn~the concluding chapter, I shall present my critique of Marx's position. My remarks will focus on the following questions: (1) If Marx's economics, especially his labor theory of value, is incorrect or inadequate (as most Western economists believe), does this necessarily invalidate his arguments on property? (2) Can alienation, as Marx described it, really be overcome by an abolition of private property? and (3) Was what Marx wrote on self-realization sufficient, given its importance to· the arguments?"
