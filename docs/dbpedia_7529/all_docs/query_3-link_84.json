Marx explored the idea that society and history are shaped by economic conflict, leading to the development of Marxism. Specifically, Marx contended that class conflict between the bourgeoisie (owners of the means of production) and proletariat (wage earners) shaped society. Two of his most notable works are The Communist Manifesto (1848), written with Friedrich Engels, which systematically outlined of the political doctrine of communism and Das Kapital (1867), which critiqued capitalism.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nToggle\n\nKarl Marx Pronunciation\n\nPronunciation Usage Guide\n\nSyllabification: karl marx\n\nAudio Pronunciation\n\n– American English\n\n– British English\n\nInternational Phonetic Alphabet\n\nAmerican English – /kɑrl mɑrks/\n\nBritish English – /kɑːl mɑːks/\n\nUsage Note\n\nMarx’s ideas along with those of Émile Durkheim (1858–1917) and Max Weber (1864–1920) played a significant role in the development and growth of the social sciences.\n\nWorks by Marx\n\nMarx, Karl.

Marx was a utopian who centered his attention on capitalism and its internal dynamics, assuming that when socialism replaced capitalism many of world’s problems would disappear” (Hughes and Kroehler 2008:12).\n\n“What are social classes in Marxist theory? They are groups of social agents, of men defined principally but not exclusively by their place in the production process, i.e. by their place in the economic sphere. The economic place of the social agents has a principal role in determining social classes. But from that we cannot conclude that this economic place is sufficient to determine social classes. Marxism states that the economic does indeed have the determinant role in a mode of production or a social formation; but the political and the ideological (the superstructure) also have an important role. For whenever Marx, Engels, Lenin and Mao analyse social classes, far from limiting themselves to the economic criteria alone, they make explicit reference to political and ideological criteria. We can thus say that a social class is defined by its place in the ensemble of social practices, i.e. by its place in the ensemble of the division of labour which includes political and ideological relations. This place corresponds to the structural determination of classes, i.e. the manner in which determination by the structure (relations of production, politico-ideological domination/subordination) operates on class practices – for classes have existence only in the class struggle” (Poulantzas 1973:27).\n\nRelated Video\n\nAdditional Information\n\nCarlisle, Rodney P., and James H.
