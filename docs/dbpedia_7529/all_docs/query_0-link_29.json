        "text": "The Karl Marx House museum, located in Trier, Germany, is a biographical and writer's house museum. It is the birthplace of Karl Marx, the father of Marxism, who was born in the house in 1818. The museum is dedicated to the life and writings of Marx, as well as the history of communism.\n\nHistory of the Building\n\nThe house where Karl Marx was born was originally built in 1727 as a two-story baroque building. It was not until 1947 that the building was opened as a museum dedicated to the life and works of Karl Marx.\n\nThe Exhibition\n\nOn the occasion of the bicentennial of Karl Marx's birth on 5 May 2018, the exhibition at the Karl Marx House museum was completely reworked. The new concept, entitled \"From Trier to the World. Karl Marx, his ideas and their impact until today\", offers a comprehensive look at Marx's life, his work, and the global impact of his ideas."
