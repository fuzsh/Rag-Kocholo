        "text": "In Trier’s various museums, preparations for Karl Marx’s 200th birthday are in full swing.\n\nDeliveries of documents chronicling Marx's life and works are arriving from all over the world. This week, for instance, evidence of his doctorate was showcased to the press at the Landesmuseum.\n\nThe father of communism was born on 5 May 1818, and grew up at a time when poverty was prevalent among Trier's residents. After leaving his home town, Marx lived in different cities around the world.\n\nVisitors who are interested in learning more about the different stages of the philosopher's life will have the opportunity to do so at the City Museum, where each stage is carefully presented as part of an exhibit.\n\nThe Landesaustellug (State Exhibition) in Trier will open to the public from 5 May to 21 October, this year.\n\nAdditionally, in a novel modern tribute to the philosopher, visitors may be \"given the green light\" by Karl Marx himself, as Trier introduces a set of anniversary traffic lights to mark the occasion.\n\nLecture at the National Literary Centre in Mersch\n\nKarl Marx, Marxism and Literature\n\nEven though Marx has not authored any specific piece of literature, there are multiple instances in his writing where he deals with the discipline of literature, which he reluctantly dropped in favour of philosophy and economics.\n\nIn a lecture by Dr Norbert Campagna, Marx's work is used as a starting point to explore three questions:\n\nIn what ways do we argue that literature is a mirror of reality?\n\nIn what way can the literary works of a particular period appeal to people spanning different generations?\n\nAnd finally, what is the historical role and mission of the author?\n\nNorbert Campagna, Dr. phil. habil., is Associate Professor at the University of Luxembourg, teacher of the Preparatory Classes at the Lycée Classique d'Eschternach (LCE) and philosophy teacher at the Lycée de Garçons Esch-sur-Alzette (LGE). He has published 26 books, 40 articles for academic journals, and over 120 contributions to various collections of essays."
