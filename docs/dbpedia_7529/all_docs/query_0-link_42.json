[Photo/Xinhua]\n\nThe bronze figure portrays a middle-aged Marx in walking, with a book in his left hand, together with his iconic beard. It is situated in proximity to Porta Nigra, a large Roman city gate that's landmark of Trier, one of Germany's oldest cities.\n\nWeighing 2.3 metric tons, the bronze figure was mounted in front of a former Marx family home.\n\nThe statue's height, 5.5 meters, was made to coincide with his birthday on May 5, said its creator Wu Weishan, a Chinese artist.\n\nMarx, son of a Jewish lawyer, spent 17 years in Trier, southwestern Germany, before becoming a great thinker.\n\n\"Marx's ideas are of great value to the world, and in particular had far-reaching influence on China,\" Guo Weimin, deputy director of the State Council Information Office of China, said in a speech shortly before the statue's debut.\n\nMalu Dreyer, the governor of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate, in which Trier is located, called the statue from China \"a pillar and a bridge for our partnership\".\n\nHundreds of people, including local residents, tourists and Chinese guests, took part in the debut, the climax of a series of events in Trier to commemorate Marx."
