He explored sociopolitical theories and became a journalist creating socialist writings causing him to be banished from Germany and France. Marx is the creator of the Communist Manifesto which was published in the year 1848 and lived his last days in london where he wrote the first volume of Das Kapital.

His father was one of the most respected lawyers in Trier, when Marx turned seventeen he was enrolled in the Faculty of Law at the University of Bonn. A year later his father sent him to a more serious college in berlin that he attended for four years studying law and philosophy. Marx became a member of the Young Hegelians, a radical group of students that criticized religion and politics. At the end of 1843 Marx moved to Paris. Throughout the first few months he was in paris he became a communist and recorded his views in the Economical and Philosophical Manuscripts, which would not be published\n\nKarl Heinrich Marx, born May 5, 1818 into a white-collar class home in Trier on the stream of Moselle came from a lineage of rabbis. Although born Jewish, when the laws forbad his father, a lawyer, to advance his social class, they converted to Lutheranism, yet did not practice Christianity. Openly an atheist, Marx’ ideology was based heavily on a more socialistic communism view, which theorists believed was a religion within itself, and so “Marxism” was born. This concept changed how social class developed and gave dimensions to governmental and socio-economic factors.\n\nAfter Jenny and Karl were married, the two of them decided to move to Paris together. On May 1, 1844, the newly wed couple had their first child, Jenny. While in Paris, Marx devoted himself to studying political economy and the history of the French Revolution. He was also working with Ruge in publishing the Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher. This paper, however, did not last very long like his last one. The paper only had one issue before Guizot banned it along with Marx from France in 1845.\n\nKarl Marx was born in 1818. Throughout his life, he wrote a lot of texts touching different topics such as philosophy, history, political science, and more. In 1843, he got married with Jenny von Westphalen. For ten years, he was writing political comments for the New York Tribune. Beside that, Marx had no regular salary. For the most of his life he was poor and suffered from chronic and painful health problems. Karl Marx was acquiring knowledge about how the modern European society was working, about its political and economical aspects of capitalism. He was writing in the sphere of social sciences. However, sometimes his works included the natural sciences. Karl Marx died in 1883 in London. (“Marx, Karl”)\n\nKarl Marx’s Communist Manifesto was published in 1848. Although Karl Marx had been relevant and influential since 1830s it was not until he earned his PhD from the University of Jena in 1941 and established himself as an author, academic, and a journalist living between Cologne and Berlin both in Germany. However, it was not until he penned his signature work, the Communist Manifesto that he solidified his stance on power and power relationship within society. Marx’s theory states that, Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other — Bourgeoisie and Proletariat (Walters, 2015) and his ideas of capitalism began the great debate of a power struggle between those with it and those without it. The Bourgeoisie is the wealthy middle class and the Proletariat is the industrial working class. These two groups were and will always be at odds over many types of power, including but not limited to: financial capability, political power, social capital, property and business ownership, access to opportunity, fair and equal justice, etc…Marx had many pupils who he mentored and peers who helped him expand and sharpen his theories. One of the prominent disciples of Marx, Pierre Bourdieu, built upon Marx’s conflict theory and other thoughts about class and society.\n\nThe main contributor to the book was Karl Marx. Marx was born on May 5th, 1818 in Western Germany. When he turned seventeen he enrolled at the University of Bonn to study law.

This experience led to his first work, “The Condition of the Working Class in England.”\n\nMarx devoted himself to an intensive study of history and elaborated on his idea of historical materialism. He traced the history of the various modes of production and predicted the collapse of the present one—industrial capitalism—and its replacement by communism. Next, Marx wrote The Poverty of Philosophy in1847, a response to Pierre-Joseph Proudhon's The Philosophy of Poverty and a critique of French socialist thought. These works laid the foundation for Marx and Engels' most famous work, The Communist Manifesto. Later that year, Europe experienced tremendous revolutionary upheaval.

Once finished with his doctorial thesis on the philosophy of Epicurus, Karl turned to his mentor, Bruno Bauer, whom he hoped would be able to help him get a job as a professor at Bonn. Marx was soon notified that Bauer had been removed from his position due to his outspoken atheism ². Marx was unable to find a position due to his connections with Bauer. Marx's connections with Bauer were not the only problem keeping him from receiving a lecture's job; Marx had joined a group called the \"Left Hegelians.\" This circle of intellectuals sought to draw atheistic and revolutionary conclusions from Hegel's philosophy ³.
