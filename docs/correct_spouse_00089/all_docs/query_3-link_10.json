        "text": "I would suggest that Deborah was NOT married to Barak for the following reasons:\n\nThe two lived in different places: Deborah was from Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; Barak was Kedesh in Naphtali. These are far apart.\n\nThe two words quoted by the OP as related are not etymologically related but only vaguely semantically related.\n\nEllicott says this of the name Lapidoth, which occurs nowhere else, means “flames,” “lamps,” or “splendours;” and Rashi says that she was called “a woman of lamps,” from making the wicks for the lamps of the sanctuary.\n\nAgain, Ellicott suggests Barak.—The name means “lightning” (Jos., Antt.), as does Barca, the family name of Hannibal and Hasdrubal. So in Virgil, the Scipios are called “two lightnings of war.” (Comp. Boanerges, Mark 3:17.)\n\nTo call these two meanings the same is to stretch the meanings too far."
