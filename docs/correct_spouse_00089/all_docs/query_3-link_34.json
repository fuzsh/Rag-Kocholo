        "text": "I have not found a commentary but have found articles, i.e. Painting Deborah by Angela Yarber (2015/03/14):\n\nMost often, the text is translated as “Deborah, wife of Lapidoth, a prophetess, was judging Israel.” Because women in scripture are most often named in relation to a man—wife, mother, daughter—translators assume that Lapidoth is the name of Deborah’s husband, even though his name has appeared nowhere else in scripture. Women rarely stand on their own in the bible. Not surprisingly, the word for woman and the word for wife are identical in Hebrew, one in the same. But eshet lappidot can also be translated as “fiery woman,” “woman of fire,” “spirited woman,” “woman like a torch.” Not merely a wife, Deborah may have been a bit feisty, fiery. Or some scholars contend that this fire-and-torch-like woman may have had red hair.\n\nAlso in the book The Old Testament Story by Don C. Benjamin (2004):\n\nOTS 2004: 146 (taken directly from his writings) The story introduces Deborah as “wife of Lappidoth” (Judg 4:40. Beyond this title, however, Lappidoth appears nowhere else in the Bible. It would be more characteristic of the hero story if “wife of Lappidoth” were translated as “woman of fire.” Saul is tall, David is ruddy handsome, Ehud is left-handed, Samson is muscular, and Deborah is a “torch.” She has red hair."
