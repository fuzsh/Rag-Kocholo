        "text": "Brother Branham Said:\n\nAnd this place here, we had just left theâ€¦A few years before this, had been the prophetess, Deborah; and Barak. And how that she had prophesied and told them what to do, and it was just exactly right; Barak, the great warrior; and how that they made a song, of the triumph over the enemy. But as soon as they got out of the twist, right straight back into the rut they went again. If that isn't the picture of the church today! Just as soon as it gets out of one twist, right into another one it goes. 61-1231E\n\nDeborah and her husband, Lapidoth lived in Mount Ephraim, under the \"palm tree of Deborah.\" The Israelites often came to her and heard her judgment and wisdom. She must have been very wise and godly.\n\nOne day, Deborah spoke to a great military man named Barak. She told him that Israel should attack its enemy, Jabin the King of Hazor, and his powerful military leader, Sisera. Barak knew how God had blessed Deborah so he told her that he would not go to war, unless she agreed to go with him.\n\nDeborah agreed, but before they left for war, she made one thing clear. God was going make the mighty leader, Sisera, die by the hand of a woman, not by Barak.\n\nBarak gathered ten thousand men for the battle, and Sisera gathered all of his men, even nine hundred chariots of iron!\n\nOnce the battle started, it was clear that the Lord was with the Israelites. They defeated Sisera's army, but Sisera himself was escaping. He ran as fast as he could away from the battle, in order to save his own life.\n\nSisera must have thought he had finally escaped when he came to the tent of a woman named Jael. She told him to come in, and not to be scared - she would hide him.\n\nSisera quickly went in and hid under a blanket. The evil Sisera was exhausted and thirsty, so he begged Jael for a drink of water. Jael, instead, gave him a nice big drink of milk.\n\nWith a big glass of milk in his belly, hiding under a warm blanket, Sisera went right to sleep. That's when Jael quietly snuck in and killed the great and terrible leader, Sisera - the enemy of Israel."
