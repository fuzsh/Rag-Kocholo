        "text": "City News Service\n\nChristian Brando, the troubled son of a Hollywood icon who killed his half-sister’s boyfriend in 1990, died of pneumonia at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center at 1:47 a.m. Saturday. He was 49.\n\nA family attorney said Brando – born May 11, 1958 – succumbed to complications of pneumonia at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center. His ex-wife, Deborah Brando, confirmed his death in an interview with People magazine.\n\nBrando served about five years in prison for the May, 16, 1990, shooting death of Dag Drollet. Brando, then 32, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the death of 26-year-old Drolett, his sister Cheyenne’s lover and the father of her unborn child.\n\nThe murder took place at Marlon Brando’s hilltop estate when her brother confronted Drollet after Cheyenne confided that he had been beating her. He said he never intended to kill Drollet, but that the man tried to grab a gun he held and it went off.\n\nBrando’s legendary actor father used his estate near Coldwater Canyon to secure the $2 million bond for his eldest son, and later testified in an emotional, rambling plea for leniency.\n\nChristian Brando was given a 10-year prison sentence but ended up serving nearly five years at the California Men’s Colony at San Luis Obispo. He was also sentenced to three years probation.\n\nThe younger Brando was the subject of a tempestuous child custody fight between his father and his first wife, Anna Kashfi. At one point, courts ordered the mother’s custody terminated because of her drug use, but she kidnapped the boy and fled to Baja California.\n\nChristian was returned to his father’s custody, and returned to his mountaintop home off Mulholland Highway. But he reportedly was raised most of his childhood at an Ojai boarding school.\n\nBrando dropped out of school and was using drugs as a teen, and reportedly worked as a tree trimmer and fishing barge pilot in Alaska. But he moved back to the Hollywood Hills in 1990, where the confrontation with Drollet happened.\n\nBrando had been hospitalized since Jan. 11 with pneumonia."
