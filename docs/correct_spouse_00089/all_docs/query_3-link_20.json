Deborah and Barak deliver them from Jabin and Sisera\n\n17. Jael kills Sisera\n\n(4) Deborah.--The name means \"bee,\" like the Greek Melissa. The names of Jewish women were often derived from natural objects, as Rachel, \"a lamb,\" Tamar,\"a palm,\" &c. It has been sometimes regarded as a title given to her as a prophetess, just as the priestesses of Delphi were called Bees (Pindar, Pyth. iv. 106); and priests were called by the title Malebee (Ess?n). But the fact that Rachel's nurse (Genesis 35:8) had the same name is against this supposition, though Josephus (Antt. v., ? 5) accepts it. She had, as Cornelius a Lapide quaintly says, \"a sting for foes, and honey for friends.\" The pronunciation Deb?rah is now so deeply-rooted in England (possibly from the Vulgate, Debbora) that it would, perhaps, be pedantic to alter it; but properly the \"?\" is long ?????; LXX., Deborra and Debb?ra).\n\nA prophetess.--Literally, a woman, a prophetess; like Miriam (Exodus 15:20), Huldah (2Kings 22:14), Noadiah (Nehemiah 6:14), Anna (Luke 2:36), &c. She is the only female judge, or, indeed, female ruler of any kind in Jewish history, except the Phoenician murderess, Athaliah. She is also the only judge to whom the title \"prophet\" is expressly given. \"Prophetess\" (like the Latin Vates) implies the possession of poetic as well as of prophetic gifts (Exodus 15:20); and we see her right to such a title, both in her predictions (Judges 4:9), her lofty courage (Judges 5:7), and the splendour of her inspired song (Judges 5). She has modern parallels in the Teutonic prophetesses, Veleda and Alaurinia (Tac., Germ. 8), and Joan of Arc, the \"Inspired Maid of Domremi.\" Among the Jews prophetesses were the exception; among the ancient Germans they were the rule. . . .\n\nParallel Commentaries ...\n\nHebrew\n\nNow Deborah,\n\nוּדְבוֹרָה֙ (ū·ḏə·ḇō·w·rāh)\n\nConjunctive waw | Noun - proper - feminine singular\n\nStrong's 1683: Deborah -- two Israelite women\n\na prophetess,\n\nנְבִיאָ֔ה (nə·ḇî·’āh)\n\nNoun - feminine singular\n\nStrong's 5031: A prophetess, inspired woman, a poetess, a, prophet's wife\n\nthe wife\n\nאֵ֖שֶׁת (’ê·šeṯ)\n\nNoun - feminine singular construct\n\nStrong's 802: Woman, wife, female\n\nof Lappidoth,\n\nלַפִּיד֑וֹת (lap·pî·ḏō·wṯ)\n\nNoun - proper - masculine singular\n\nStrong's 3941: Lappidoth\n\nwas judging\n\nשֹׁפְטָ֥ה (šō·p̄ə·ṭāh)\n\nVerb - Qal - Participle - feminine singular\n\nStrong's 8199: To judge, pronounce sentence, to vindicate, punish, to govern, to litigate\n\nIsrael\n\nיִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל (yiś·rā·’êl)\n\nNoun - proper - masculine singular\n\nStrong's 3478: Israel -- 'God strives', another name of Jacob and his desc\n\nat that\n\nהִ֛יא (hî)\n\nPronoun - third person feminine singular\n\nStrong's 1931: He, self, the same, this, that, as, are\n\ntime.\n\nבָּעֵ֥ת (bā·‘êṯ)\n\nPreposition-b, Article | Noun - common singular\n\nStrong's 6256: Time, now, when\n\nLinks\n\nJudges 4:4 NIV\n\nJudges 4:4 NLT\n\nJudges 4:4 ESV\n\nJudges 4:4 NASB\n\nJudges 4:4 KJVJudges 4:4 BibleApps.com\n\nJudges 4:4 Biblia Paralela\n\nJudges 4:4 Chinese Bible\n\nJudges 4:4 French Bible\n\nJudges 4:4 Catholic BibleOT History: Judges 4:4 Now Deborah a prophetess the wife (Jd Judg.
