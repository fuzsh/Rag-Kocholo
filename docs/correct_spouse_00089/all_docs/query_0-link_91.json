        "text": "Elvis Presley performs ‘Hound Dog’ in 1956\n\nIconic Hollywood actor Marlon Brando had a close connection with Elvis Presley throughout the years, but they both had very personal and very secret conversations with a woman named Carmen Montez throughout their lives - according to a book by author Gary Lindberg.\n\n\"Brando on Elvis: In His Own Words\" publishes Brando's secret letters sent to Montez for the first time throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Montez was apparently a pen pal and agony aunt to both Elvis, Brando, and some other Hollywood stars over the years.\n\nAnd one of Brando's letters to Montez detailed his worry for Elvis in February 1969.\n\nBrando wrote to Montez that \"it looked like Elvis really didn't feel like talking to anyone\".\n\nThis letter came after claims that Elvis had been savagely attacked by unknown assailants - suspected gang members who attempted to kidnap him.\n\nHe said: \"I know he's there shut up in the house, and I know he got the note I left him, but he hasn't responded. I didn't think Pris [Priscilla] would get to him this time. I mean get under his skin. Especially if she made him so mad in Memphis.\" (sic)\n\nBrando went on to criticise Elvis' wife at the time, Priscilla Presley, for not supporting her husband during his hardship.\n\nIn the letter Brando alluded to Priscilla and Elvis arguing in recent months. He noted how she \"could have been the one\" to help him get over his trauma from the past.\n\nBrando added: \"He's just begun to find himself as a man. And a patient, understanding wife could have done wonders.\"\n\nThe actor suggested Elvis could have instead found solace in another woman. While he had cheated on his wife in the past - most notably with actress Ann-Margret - Brando mused that the star \"didn't have it in him anymore\".\n\n\"Now Elvis,\" he wrote. \"Partly out of morality, and partly out of fear, won't turn to another woman, and he seems to fear other men.\"\n\nFinally, he added that he believed Elvis was doubting his own sexuality.\n\nREAD MORE: Elvis: Austin Butler 'reduced to tears' after 'heckling'\n\nInvalid email\n\nWe use your sign-up to provide content in ways you've consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

I sometimes think he fears that he's a latent homosexual.\"\n\nWhile some people have questioned the validity of these handwritten letters, publisher Calumet Editions claim they have proof the articles are genuine.\n\nThe Godfather actor knew all about experimenting sexually with other men.\n\nAuthor William J Mann wrote of Brando's life in the biography \"The Contender\". Within this tome, he revealed Brando had many sexual relationships with men as well as women throughout his life.\n\n\"When I awake in the morning,\" Mann wrote of Brando. \"The first thing he thought about was: ‘Who am I going to f**k today?' even if there was a woman sleeping beside him.\"\n\nDON'T MISS...\n\nElvis: Austin Butler 'reduced to tears' after 'heckling' [NEWS]\n\nElvis Presley's 'lost' gold and jewels with Tom Parker up for auction [INFO]\n\nMarilyn Monroe refused to date Elvis in public but shared secret night [INSIGHT]\n\nRichard Harris does hilarious Marlon Brando impression\n\nMann added that Brando \"casually slept with men\" while at Shattuck Military academy.\n\nHe wrote: \"The relationship was nothing extraordinary; sexual play between cadets at military schools was not uncommon.\"\n\nBrando himself once said: \"Let’s say sex has no sex.\"\n\nSo then, he may have been on to something about Elvis' \"latent\" sexuality. The Jailhouse Rock singer was born and raised in a traditional Christian family, and was used as a sex symbol for women throughout the 1950s and 1960s, so he may not have had the chance to explore his own desires.\n\nBrando was not the first person to make comments about Elvis' sexuality over the years.\n\nGerald Peters, Elvis' chauffeur and close friend, described the King as a \"man's man\".\n\nHe also alluded to the star's ambiguous sexuality, adding: \"Although he loved Priscilla dearly, he preferred the company of men.\" He also stressed how much Elvis loved hanging out with his large entourage of male friends: The Memphis Mafia.\n\nElvis biographer Kathleen Tracy also claimed the King would, on occasion, ask his best friend, actor Nick Adams, to stay with him overnight. Adams is best known for having an affair with iconic star James Dean.\n\nRead all of Marlon Brando's letters about Elvis here."
