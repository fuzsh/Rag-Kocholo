        "text": "Christian Brando was put on probation for domestic abuse in 2005\n\nChristian Brando, the son of late Hollywood legend Marlon Brando, and his ex-wife have settled opposing legal claims alleging domestic violence.\n\nThe terms were not disclosed in court papers filed in Los Angeles.\n\nIn December 2005, Deborah Brando alleged Mr Brando beat and threatened to kill her. He later claimed she broke into his home and attacked him.\n\nMr Brando spent five years in jail in the 1990s for the manslaughter of his half-sister Cheyenne's boyfriend.\n\nDeborah Brando's legal action claimed violation of civil rights, assault, domestic violence, battery and emotional distress.\n\n'Savage' beating\n\nLast August, Mr Brando counter-sued with the allegation that his then-wife had broken into his home in December 2004 and \"savagely\" beaten him.\n\nShe was upset because he wanted to annul their marriage 10 weeks after their wedding, his legal action said.\n\nIn January 2005, Mr Brando pleaded no contest to two charges of spousal abuse.\n\nHe was given three years probation and ordered to undergo drug and alcohol rehabilitation as well as a domestic abuse prevention programme."
