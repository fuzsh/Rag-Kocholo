Yeah Right!\n\nMarty\n\nBill Burk\n\nI sincererly hope that he don't actually believe\n\nthat it's Elvis' daughter since there's no evidence to back it up:\n\nI covered Deborah Presley's trial in a MEM court whereby she claimed she was\n\nElvis' dauighter. Judge threw the case out. Her \"proof\" was that her mother\n\ntold her moms had once confessed to a priest that Elvis was her father !!\n\nI mean, what more do you need than that?\n\nAnd Christian Brando is also tied into the Robert Blake murder story. He was\n\nsomehow connected to Blake's now dead wife, who, by the way, also lived in\n\nMemphis for awhile.\n\n007\n\n--\n\n******************\n\nBill E.
