        "text": "Actor Eugene Levy and his wife, Deborah Divine, are one of the longest standing couples in Hollywood. Levy and Divine have been married since 1977, and they are still going strong today.\n\nWhile Levy is a household name due to his movie and TV career, his wife lives more quietly, generally staying out of the public eye. Ahead is everything to know about Divine and her love story with Levy.\n\nLevy and Divine have been together for 50 years.\n\nTheir romance goes way back. Divine and Levy began dating in 1973 and got married in 1977.\n\nDivine and Levy share two children, both of whom grew up to be actors.\n\nOn Aug. 9, 1983, the couple welcomed their first child together, Daniel (yes, that Dan Levy). Then, on Sept. 10, 1986, Divine gave birth to their daughter, Sarah.\n\nDan and Sarah went on to be successful actors. Dan and his dad co-created and co-starred in the award-winning TV show, They played beloved father-son duo Johnny and David Rose. Sarah also had a role on the series. She was Twyla Sands, the waitress and local café owner.\n\nThe only member of the Levy family who wasn’t cast in the show was Divine, but she likes it better that way. The mother of two prefers to keep out of the spotlight, working behind the scenes instead. But Levy still gives Divine much credit.\n\nAt the 2020 Emmy Awards, Levy won Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, and he made sure to show his wife some love.\n\n“I first want to thank my darling wife of 43 years, Deb Divine, for all the love, support, and sage counsel over the years,” he said in his acceptance speech. “I wouldn’t be up here without you, Deb. I love you.”\n\nDivine worked in TV production.\n\nDivine is in the industry too—just not in front of the camera. Per her IMDb page, she is credited as a writer for the ’90s sitcom Maniac Mansion. Levy makes a cameo on the show in season 3.\n\nDivine supported Levy as he accepted his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nIn March 2024, Levy received his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Divine attended the ceremony, along with their daughter. In his acceptance speech, Levy gave Divine a special shoutout, crediting her for his achievement.\n\n“You can’t have your name put on a star on Hollywood Boulevard without someone having your back, and Deb’s had mine for 47 years,” he said. “There would be no star today without you.”"
