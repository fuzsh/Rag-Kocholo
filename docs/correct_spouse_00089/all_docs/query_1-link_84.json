        "text": "Christian Brando, the troubled eldest son of the late famed actor Marlon Brando, died Saturday from pneumonia at a Los Angeles hospital, a family attorney said Saturday. He was 49.\n\nThe younger Brando had small roles in a few movies, including 1968's \"I Love You, Alice B. Toklas!\" But he was better known for his brushes with the law, spending five years in prison after pleading guilty to manslaughter in 1990 for killing his sister's boyfriend, Dag Drollet, at the Brando family's estate.\n\nBrando's ex-wife, Deborah Brando, sued him for domestic violence in 2005. He countersued, alleging that his ex-wife broke into his home and beat him because he wanted to annul their marriage only 10 weeks after exchanging vows.\n\nThe lawsuits were settled last year on undisclosed terms.\n\nIn 2005, Brando pleaded guilty to two counts of spousal abuse and was placed on three years' probation and ordered to drug and alcohol rehabilitation, as well as a spousal-abuse prevention program.\n\nHe also was the one-time lover of Bonnie Lee Bakley, who was shot to death in 2001. At one time, Bakley claimed Brando had fathered her child, but tests showed the child belonged to actor Robert Blake, whom she later married.\n\nThe family attorney said Brando was not married at the time of his death and did not leave any children.\n\nASSOCIATED PRESS"
