        "text": "Christian Brando, the troubled eldest son of Hollywood icon Marlon Brando, has died at the age of 49, media reports said.\n\nThe New York Post and People magazine both reported on their websites that Brando, son of the late screen star and and Welsh actress Anna Kashfi, had died of complications from pneumonia.\n\n\"His body was totally compromised,\" Brando's ex-wife, Deborah, told People.\n\nFriends of the family could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nPeople reported that he had been in a coma and on a ventilator.\n\nBrando made worldwide headlines in 1990 when he pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter after shooting to death his half-sister Cheyenne's boyfriend, Dag Drollet, a crime for which he served five years in prison.\n\nChristian Brando had dated Bakley, and defence lawyers suggested that he could have been the killer.\n\nBrando was called as a witness during Blake's subsequent civil trial but refused to testify and was ordered held in contempt of court.\n\nIn 2005, he pleaded guilty to spousal abuse charges involving his then-wife, Deborah, and was placed on probation."
