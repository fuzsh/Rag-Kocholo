        "text": "Christian Brando had a few minor film roles\n\nChristian Brando, eldest son of the late actor Marlon Brando, has died in Los Angeles, aged 49.\n\nHe had reportedly been in a coma and on a ventilator, and died of complications arising from pneumonia.\n\n\"His body was totally compromised,\" said his former wife, Deborah. \"He'd lived so hard.\"\n\nAfter a few minor acting roles, he hit the headlines in 1990, when he shot dead his half-sister's boyfriend, for which he served five years in jail.\n\nIn 2005, he pleaded guilty to abusing his then-wife Deborah and was placed on probation, and ordered to undergo drug and alcohol rehabilitation.\n\nChristian Brando also figured in the murder trial of Hollywood actor Robert Blake, whose wife was shot to death in 2001.\n\nHe invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination on the stand when a lawyer for Blake, who was eventually acquitted, suggested that Brando had been the killer.\n\nMarlon Brando died in 2004\n\nChristian Brando had a small number of film roles, including an appearance in I Love You, Alice B Toklas! at the age of 10.\n\nBut he will be best remembered for the 1990 death of Dag Drollet, boyfriend of his half-sister Cheyenne, at the Brando family's estate.\n\nHe said in court that he had accidentally shot Mr Drollet as they struggled for a gun during an argument over whether the boyfriend had beaten his pregnant girlfriend.\n\nPleading guilty to manslaughter, he spent five years in prison.\n\nCheyenne committed suicide in 1995 at the age of 25.\n\nMarlon Brando, star of On The Waterfront and The Godfather, died in 2004 at the age of 80."
