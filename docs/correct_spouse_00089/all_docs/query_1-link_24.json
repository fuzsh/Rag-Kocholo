        "text": "Marlon Brando's son Christian died as a result of his hard living, ex-wife Deborah said yesterday.\n\nShe said: \"His body was totally compromised. He lived so hard.\"\n\nChristian, 49, eldest of the screen legend's nine children, died of pneumonia at the weekend after 15 days in hospital in Los Angeles.\n\nThe high school dropout had small roles in a handful of movies, including I Love You, Alice B. Toklas!(1968)but was better known for his brushes with the law.\n\nIn 1990 he was jailed for shooting dead his pregnant half-sister Cheyenne's boyfriend Dag Drollet, who he accused of beating her, and served five years for manslaughter.\n\nIn 2005 he admitted abusing his then wife Deborah, put on probation and ordered into drug and alcohol rehab."
