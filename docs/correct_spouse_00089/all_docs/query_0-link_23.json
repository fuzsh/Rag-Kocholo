I have been know as the illigitimate Daughter of Elvis, the wife of Christian Brando, the former daughter in law of Marlon Brando. It is my sincere desire to let you have a glimpse into my real life. I want to speak to the issues that have been fodder for tabloids and rumors. I want so share the things I love. The New Children's book I have just released and upcoming books I have written. I will journal her at least thre times a week. I am a painter. I am a jeweler designer, and a perfume maker. It is my belief that we are all children of the Divine. It is my belief that every single one of us human beings are truly of Divine Origin. I will answer all questions, taking three a week. I will offer prayers and ideas for self help, and teach the art of loving oneself, so that we may love others. Even, those that are caue us harm , or appear to be enemies. I have been bleseed with deep and lasting wounds, that had to be healed with the light of the truth. It is my honor and my pleasure to begin the thread of my blog."
