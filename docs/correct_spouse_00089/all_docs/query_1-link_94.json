        "text": "LOS ANGELES - Christian Brando, the troubled eldest son of the late famed actor Marlon Brando, has died from pneumonia at a Los Angeles hospital, an attorney said Saturday. He was 49.\n\nDefendant Christian Brando (L) is kissed by his father, actor Marlon Brando, after a judge accepted the elder Brando's home as bail for his son during a hearing in Santa Monica, California in this August 14, 1990 file photo. [Agencies]\n\nBrando died Saturday morning at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, said David Seeley, an attorney representing Marlon Brando's estate.\n\nSeeley said Brando was taken to the hospital on Jan. 11. There are no funeral plans yet scheduled, he added.\n\n\"This is a sad and difficult time for the family,\" Seeley said.\n\nBorn May 11, 1958, the younger Brando had small roles in a handful of movies, including 1968's \"I Love You, Alice B. Toklas!\" but he was better known for his brushes with the law.\n\nHe spent five years in prison after pleading guilty to manslaughter in 1990 for killing his sister's boyfriend, Dag Drollet, at the Brando family's estate.\n\nBrando said he accidentally shot Drollet as they struggled for a gun during an argument over whether Drollet, 26, had beaten Brando's pregnant half-sister, Cheyenne.\n\nCheyenne, who later gave birth to Drollet's son, committed suicide in 1995 after losing custody. She was 25.\n\nBrando's ex-wife, Deborah Brando, sued him for domestic violence in 2005. She claimed that shortly after their 2004 marriage, Brando repeatedly beat her and threatened to kill her in the presence of her teenage daughter.\n\nBrando countersued, alleging that his ex-wife broke into his home and beat him because he wanted to annul their marriage only 10 weeks after exchanging vows.\n\nThe lawsuits were settled last year on undisclosed terms."
