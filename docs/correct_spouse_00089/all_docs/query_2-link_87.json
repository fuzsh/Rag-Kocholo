        "text": "\"My family's weird,\" he told his probation officer. \"We had new additions all the time. I'd sit down at the table with new people and I'd have to ask: 'Who are you?' Invariably they were a brother or sister I had never met.\"\n\nMoody and irresponsible, Christian Brando followed in a long tradition of Hollywood rich kids, becoming addicted to drink and drugs. His friends at school were also the children of celebrities; many of them drove flashy cars, although Marlon Brando refused his son's requests for such expensive trappings.\n\nIn his early twenties Christian Brando became a bar brawler, drifting through various dead-end jobs, until he was invited to try his hand as an actor by a studio keen to exploit the famous surname. Having, as a child, had small roles in The Secret Life of an American Housewife and I Love You, Alice B Toklas! (both 1968), he appeared in two further films, but nothing came of them.\n\nIn 1988, aged 30, he inherited $100,000 and an annual allowance from a trust fund set up by his father. At the same time, Marlon Brando loaned his son a further $200,000 to buy a house for himself and his wife Mary, but Christian's drinking and womanising soon destroyed the marriage. He fell out with his father when his mother turned up destitute on his doorstep; Brando Sr ordered his son to send her away.\n\nBrando Jr had two stormy marriages. Having assaulted Mary, he threatened to shoot her during the ensuing divorce proceedings. In 2005 his second wife, Deborah, sued him for domestic violence, claiming that shortly after their marriage the previous year, Brando had repeatedly beaten her and threatened to kill her in the presence of her teenage daughter.\n\nChristian Brando was born on May 11 1958, the eldest of Marlon Brando's nine children. The child's mother (whom Brando had met in 1954 on the set of On The Waterfront) had been a beautiful British actress called Anna Kashfi, a one-time London shop assistant who claimed to be the illegitimate daughter of an Indian nobleman but who (by most accounts) was said to be Joanne O'Callaghan, the daughter of an Irish labourer who had moved to Cardiff.\n\nTugged back and forth between his parents, and shuttled between his father's homes in Hollywood and Tahiti, he was often left in the care of Brando's latest girlfriend. In December 1964, after Anna Kashfi attempted suicide, Brando Sr was awarded temporary sole custody of his son, then aged six, but this was countermanded by a second judge who ordered Christian into the care of his aunt, a schoolteacher.\n\nIn 1972, while his father was abroad filming Last Tango in Paris, Christian was kidnapped by a gang of Anna Kashfi's hippie friends, to whom she had apparently promised to pay $10,000. When she refused to pay they took the boy to Mexico, where a posse of private detectives hired by Brando rescued him late one night and returned him to Los Angeles. Back in court his father was awarded sole custody.\n\nAs a teenager Christian dropped out of high school and started drinking and using LSD. He tried a variety of jobs, including working as a welder, barman and tree-trimmer, and for a time lived in Alaska, piloting a barge for a fish processor. When his marriages failed, he returned to live at his father's estate in the Hollywood Hills."
