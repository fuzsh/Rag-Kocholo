        "text": "IT’S war over the body of Christian Brando, who died Saturday in Los Angeles from AIDS-related pneumonia at 49.\n\nThe ex-wife of Marlon Brando’s ex-con son has teamed up with his estranged mother, and the two are now battling Christian’s girlfriend and adopted siblings over who will get his remains and what will be done with them.\n\nBrando’s ex-wife of three months, Debra Presley – who married him in 2004 and claims to be the illegitimate daughter of Elvis – joined Christian’s estranged mom, Anna Kashfi, in the fight.\n\nSince Brando had no wife or kids, Kashfi is in control because she’s considered his next of kin. She’s the one who requested the autopsy.\n\n“These two want to take the remains to Washington and have him buried because he used to live there,” said Keith Fink, a lawyer for Donna Geon, Brando’s girlfriend of three years. “They don’t want his girlfriend or the siblings to even see the body for no reason at all.”\n\nBut Geon says Christian’s wishes were to be cremated and have his ashes spread in Franklin Park in Los Angeles, the same place his screen legend father, Marlon, had some of his ashes spread.\n\nChristian’s half-sister, Rebecca Brando, and half-brother, Teihotu Brando, along with Geon, hired Fink to assist them in getting rights to the body.\n\nFink plans to file a motion in LA Superior Court on the trio’s behalf to have the corpse released to them after it leaves the county coroner’s office pending an autopsy.\n\n“Their grievance is that they’re the ones who loved Christian. They want his remains to stay in California and they want to do what he wished,” said Fink.\n\n“Meanwhile, the mortuary complained to me that Anna ignored them when they explained how the body should be properly clothed and cared for. They are just being petty, vindictive, small people who border on looney toons.”\n\nFink has little time to persuade the court to declare the body should go to his siblings instead. If Brando’s body remains in Kashfi’s possession and she cannot afford a funeral, he will be cremated anyway.\n\nA family spokeswoman for Kashfi and Presley did not return calls."
