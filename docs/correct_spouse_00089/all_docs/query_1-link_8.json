        "text": "Christian Brando and his ex-wife have settled dueling lawsuits alleging domestic violence.\n\nTerms were not disclosed in court papers filed Monday, the same day jury selection was to begin for trial. Brando is the son of the late Marlon Brando.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in December 2005 — two months after the couple married — Deborah Brando alleged Christian Brando repeatedly beat her and threatened to kill her in the presence of her daughter, now 14.\n\nThe suit claimed violation of civil rights, assault, domestic violence, battery and emotional distress.\n\nChristian Brando countersued last August, alleging his ex-wife broke into his home in December 2004 while he was asleep and “savagely” beat him. Deborah Brando was upset that he wanted to annul their marriage 10 weeks after exchanging vows, the suit said.\n\nAn attorney representing Christian Brando declined to comment. Attempts to reach Deborah Brando’s attorney were unsuccessful.\n\nThe pair met in 1990, the year Christian Brando pleaded guilty to manslaughter for killing his sister’s boyfriend Dag Drollet. He spent six years in prison.\n\nBrando was charged Jan. 10, 2005, with two counts of spousal abuse. He pleaded no contest, was placed on three years of probation and was ordered to undergo drug and alcohol rehabilitation, as well as a spousal-abuse prevention program."
