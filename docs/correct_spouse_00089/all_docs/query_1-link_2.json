        "text": "It might have been a blessing that Christian Brando didn't regain consciousness during the last two weeks of his life. Christian, the eldest of Marlon Brando's 11 known children, was rushed to hospital on 11 January after Donna Geon, his girlfriend, found him on the floor of their rented apartment in Hollywood, barely conscious and gasping for breath. From then until his death, at 1.47am on 26 January at the Hollywood Presbyterian Hospital, Christian Brando was in a coma, kept alive on a respirator, his body 'totally compromised', according to his ex-wife Deborah Presley.\n\nUnconscious, and ravaged by double pneumonia, Christian Brando, who was only 49, was spared the humiliation of knowing that the family fights that had consumed almost every moment of his tragic life were still raging as he lay dying, and would continue with even greater ferocity after his death.\n\nThe warring factions were fighting even at his bedside. On one side stood Donna Geon, Teihotu Brando, Christian's half-brother, who had flown in from Tahiti, Rebecca Brando, his half-sister, and the executors of his father's estate. In the opposite corner were Christian's mother, Anna Kashfi, Marlon Brando's first wife, who had not seen her son for more than two decades; his two ex-wives, Mary McKenna and Deborah Presley, and a number of Marlon Brando's closest aides and confidantes, including Angela Borlaza, Marlon's maid and one of his lovers in the last decade of his life, and JoAnn Corrales, the actor's one-time business manager.\n\nThey couldn't agree on whether or not a memorial service should be held. They argued about whether Christian should be cremated or buried. They even fought over what clothes Christian's body should be dressed in. And, of course, they fought over money, over whatever estate Christian, who was deemed 'indigent' when he was admitted to hospital and did not make a will, may have had, or have had claim to.\n\nFinally, they argued about whether an autopsy should be performed. Kashfi and Presley wanted to know what had really killed him. The tabloids suggested that Christian's abusive, addictive lifestyle had finally caught up with him. But Kashfi and Presley questioned why he had not been taken to hospital sooner, before he collapsed. Although Donna Geon and the estate's executors opposed an autopsy, the LA County Coroner decided to perform one after hearing Presley and Kashfi's concerns.\n\nBeyond these specific issues, though, those who had been closest to Marlon Brando say he would have been horrified at the circumstances of his son's death - so young, without health insurance, and in a public hospital.\n\n'Marlon had always said that whoever was going to be in charge of the estate had to know the dynamics of the family,' says Deborah Presley, who had known Christian since 1990 and married him in October 2004. (In 1989 the Supreme Court refused to hear Presley's claim to be the illegitimate daughter of Elvis Presley.) 'The executors of the estate were supposed to make sure that Christian was taken care of. Everybody knew that Christian was Marlon's number one son. Marlon wanted Christian to always have a roof over his head. And he was always supposed to have health insurance. Marlon knew Christian couldn't take care of himself.'\n\nIndeed, despite their rows and estrange-ments, Marlon had always done what he could to care for his troubled son. 'Marlon always wanted, basically, to feel inside himself that he was being a proper father,' says George Englund, Brando's closest friend for more than 50 years and the last to see the actor, the night before he died.\n\n'Christian led a very self-abusive life,' says Peter Manso, who chronicled Marlon Brando's tumultuous life in his massive 1994 biography Brando. 'But the fact that he was living on welfare and died in a city hospital would have troubled his father. The executors are sitting on $20m. The least they could do is bury him.'\n\nBut a source close to the executors told the New York Daily News that 'Christian's death was a tragedy, but the executors won't be shamed into a funeral they're not legally allowed to pay for. It's up to the Brando beneficiaries.'\n\nUnfortunately, the 'Brando beneficiaries' - specifically Anna Kashfi, Christian's mother and next-of-kin, who lives on social security - did not have the money to pay for Christian's funeral. Deborah Presley, who works as a teacher of autistic children, says that to scrape together the funeral expenses she and Kashfi have had to sell their stories to the tabloids.\n\nWithin days of Christian's death, the bedside rows erupted into a flurry of lawsuits, reigniting battles that had lain dormant since Marlon's death three years ago. In separate lawsuits, Deborah Presley and Angela Borlaza claimed that a much-disputed codicil to Marlon Brando's 2002 will had been forged.\n\nJust 13 days before Marlon Brando's death on 1 July 2004, when some believe the actor was suffering from dementia, a codicil was added to his will which named Mike Medavoy, a film executive, his brother-in-law Larry Dressler, an accountant (whom Brando had never met) and Avra Douglas, a friend of Rebecca Brando, to be executors of his $21.6m estate. They replaced the executors named in Brando's 2002 will, his long-time confidantes JoAnn Corrales, Brando's business manager who had also acted as Christian's maternal guardian since he was 15, and Alice Marchak, the most trusted figure in Marlon Brando's life, the woman who had known and cared for him for more than 50 years. Lawyers for the executors deny that the codicil was forged. They say Brando changed executors because he had already fired Corrales and he felt that Marchak was too old to cope with the complex legal issues that would arise when he died.\n\nBut Christian was so infuriated at what had happened that, according to a lawsuit filed by Deborah Presley in 2005, he repeatedly threatened to kill Medavoy. Christian was not alone in criticising Medavoy and the other executors for allowing development on Teti'aroa, the Tahitian island he had bought in 1965 and which had been valued at $8.6m in his estate. 'If I have my way,' Brando wrote in his 1994 autobiography Songs My Mother Taught Me, 'Teti'aroa will remain forever a place that reminds Tahitians of who they are and what they were centuries ago. My greatest hope is to return it to what Polynesia used to be.'\n\nLess than a year after Brando's death, the estate sold a $2m interest in the island to Richard Bailey, who is due to open a luxury hotel there later this year. Bailey says he spoke with Brando about the development before his death. 'The concept for Teti'aroa is very much in keeping with what Marlon wanted,' Bailey insists.\n\nSome people believe that even in the womb, a baby can pick up the energy around it. If so, Christian would have felt the furious enmity between his parents, who argued before he was even conceived, two months before their marriage. Within days of their wedding, Brando, then 33, was infuriated when he discovered that the beautiful, exotic-looking Kashfi, 10 years his junior, was not Indian as she had claimed, but Welsh, and that her real name was Joanne O'Callaghan.\n\nWhen it came time to name their child, who was born on 11 May 1958, Kashfi was furious when she learned that Marlon had called him Christian after one of his homosexual lovers, the French actor Christian Marquand. So she always called him Devi, his middle name, the Hindu name for the female aspect of the divine.\n\n'His mother would only call him Devi, and his father would only call him Chris or Christian,' says Deborah Presley. 'He was so splintered from early on. He didn't have a chance.'\n\n'Christian was such a beautiful boy,' remembers George Englund, who was Anna Kashfi's chaperone on her first date with Brando. 'He had Anna's dark, vivid eyes. But very early on he became the battleground between Anna and Marlon.'\n\nWithin a year Brando and Kashfi were divorced, and for most of the next two decades they fought bitterly over Christian. When Kashfi, increasingly mentally unstable, overdosed on barbiturates, Brando was given temporary custody. At one court hearing a friend of Kashfi's testified that she had found Kashfi 'passed out, lying in her own vomit', while Christian played outside on the edge of a swimming pool.\n\nIn March 1972, while Brando was in France, shooting Last Tango in Paris, Kashfi removed Christian, then 13, from school after he had set fire to his dormitory, and had him abducted to northern Mexico. Hearing that his son had been kidnapped, Brando hired a private detective, who found Christian with a group of hippies, who were hiding him in a tent. The hippies confessed that Kashfi had promised them $10,000. A friend later said that Christian, who was traumatised by the event, later started buying guns because he was 'very, very afraid of being kidnapped again'.\n\nAfter Christian, who was already having serious problems with drugs and alcohol, dropped out of school at 16, he spent much of his time in Kalama, a small town in Washington state, where JoAnn Corrales tried to look after him. For the rest of his life Christian felt he could find some elusive peace there, 1,000 miles from Hollywood and his warring parents. He loved the forests, he loved fishing and he loved working with his hands. There, and on his trips back to LA, he worked on and off as a tree-trimmer and a welder.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Christian divided his time between his father's house, which shared a driveway with Jack Nicholson's home on Mulholland Drive on the top of the Hollywood Hills, and another house his father bought for him nearby, on Wonderland Avenue, which Christian used as a crash-pad, often letting homeless people and his drug friends stay there. His relationship with his father, who gradually became a recluse, was extremely complicated and fractious.\n\n'When I went to meet Marlon, I noticed that when Christian is near his father, he seems to shrink, he becomes a gnat,' film producer Carmine De Benedittis later recalled. 'He seems to be crushed by the force of his father's character. It's a very heavy load, to be called Christian Brando.'\n\nThe night of 16 May 1990 would change the lives of Marlon Brando's family forever. At the actor's Mulholland Drive home, using a .45 calibre hand-gun, Christian shot and killed Dag Drollet, the boyfriend of his beautiful 20-year-old half-sister, Cheyenne. Christian told police that over dinner earlier that evening Cheyenne, who was eight months pregnant with Drollet's child, had told him that the 26-year-old Drollet, the son of a prominent Tahitian businessman, had been slapping her around. Christian, who had been drinking heavily, claimed he threatened Drollet with the gun, and that it had gone off accidentally as they struggled.\n\nThis claim was patently false. Drollet was found in the den of Brando's 12-room home, 'lying back on the couch, kind of like he was watching TV', said the first person on the scene. Eerily, the television was on, flipping continuously through the channels. Drollet had been shot once in the face and had died instantaneously. In one hand he held a cigarette lighter, in the other the television's remote control.\n\nMarlon Brando had tried to revive him with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Cheyenne, who had suffered with severe mental problems since her mid-teens, and was said to be schizophrenic, later admitted that Drollet had not harmed her.\n\nMarlon Brando, perhaps fearing that Cheyenne's testimony might harm Christian's defence, secreted her out of the country, first to Tahiti and then to France, where she was admitted to a mental hospital.\n\n'Brando took an active role to limit our ability to prosecute,' said LA district attorney William Clark. 'It was a strategic decision on his part that Cheyenne return to Tahiti, and I think in the end it wound up destroying his daughter. He threw her into the conspiracy.'\n\nAfter a number of suicide attempts, Cheyenne eventually hanged herself in her mother's house in 1995. She was 25. She is buried next to Drollet in Tahiti. Their son, Tuki, now 18, is a model and is currently the face of Versace menswear.\n\nThe murder of Drollet, Christian's arrest and his subsequent trial on first-degree murder charges caused a Hollywood media sensation. The obese Brando's testimony on his son's behalf, sobbing on the stand, admitting his failings as a father, was to many cynical onlookers the highlight.In February 1991, after intense plea-bargaining, Christian pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. He was released after serving just four and a half years in California Men's Colony, a state prison in San Luis Obispo.\n\n'The story he told me later was that he thought the safety [catch] was on,' says Deborah Presley. 'He was just going to scare Dag. When he went up to Dag and said, \"You'd better stop\", it went off. He was totally shocked, devastated. Christian doesn't have the guts or the courage to shoot a man. He's like a little scared boy.'\n\nOn Christian's release from jail, Marlon immediately sent him to Washington state, to Kalama, where JoAnn Corrales sponsored him while he was on parole. 'I had known Christian since I felt him kicking inside his mother's stomach,' says Corrales. But Christian had been traumatised by the shooting, by the trial and by his time in jail, and he quickly became more seriously involved in drugs and alcohol. Presley says that while he always drank heavily, smoked pot and snorted cocaine, during the six years he lived in rural Washington he became seriously addicted to 'crystal meth', methamphetamine.\n\nChristian had a number of run-ins with the law there. In 2000 he failed to appear in court after being arrested for drink-driving.\n\nHe was fined $800 and sentenced to two days in jail. Later that year he was taken to a hospital with a broken jawbone after three men beat him up in his home.\n\nIn October 2001, Brad Gillaspie, a local police officer, answered an emergency call and found Christian in someone else's house 'under a kitchen table, surrounded by chairs and screaming that a monster was after him'.\n\n'I've dealt several times with Christian Brando,' says Gillaspie. 'He's very prevalent on the drug scene.'\n\nChristian saw little of his father in those years and only moved back to Los Angeles after his father's death in July 2004. Marlon, who was 80, died of respiratory failure brought on by pulmonary fibrosis. Christian was further traumatised when, apparently without warning, his father's ashes were sent to his workplace in Kalama via FedEx.\n\nFor a few months Christian lived in the house on Mulholland Drive, sometimes with other family members, later with Deborah, whom he married in October of that year in Las Vegas. But they were soon kicked out of the house by the executors who wanted to sell the property, says Presley.\n\n'They told us they were going to put armed guards on the gate,' said Presley. She says she pleaded with the executors: 'You've got $21m of Marlon's money and you're supposed to be the family's caretaker. Christian and I need a place to live.'\n\nIn May 2005 Jack Nicholson bought the property, which had been valued at $10m in the estate, for $5m. Christian and Deborah separated after less than three months of marriage. Deborah had gone to hospital after being attacked by Christian and city authorities pressed charges against him for spousal abuse. Christian pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to three years' probation.\n\nIn a civil lawsuit filed the following year, Presley claimed that Christian had terrible fits of rage, beat her, threatened to suffocate her, and terrorised her and her 11-year-old daughter. Christian eventually agreed to pay her $45,000. But Presley claims that sum has not been paid in full, which she says gives her a claim over Christian's estate, and the right to contest Marlon Brando's will.\n\nSuddenly homeless in January 2005, Christian moved in with Donna Geon, a blonde Hispanic in her late forties, whom he had only recently met. She had a one-bedroom apartment in a building just off Sunset Boulevard in the grimier part of Hollywood. Like Christian, Geon was not holding down a steady job.\n\nIn October 2005, the executors of Marlon Brando's will authorised a payment of $200,000 to Christian, which represented some of the proceeds from the sale of his father's memorabilia at Christie's, a sale which Christian had opposed. Those close to Christian say the lump-sum payment was a terrible mistake and only fuelled his drinking and other addictions.\n\nDuring this time Christian became unexpectedly embroiled in the bizarre trial of actor Robert Blake for the murder of Bonnie Lee Bakley, a grifter and blackmailer who pursued celebrities. Christian had had a brief affair with Bakley and she had convinced him that she had had his child, which she even named Christian. In fact, the child turned out to be Blake's. One line of Blake's successful defence in his trial was that Christian had hired someone to kill Bakley. Blakes's lawyers even produced a tape recording of Christian telling Bakley, 'You're lucky someone ain't out there to put a bullet in your head.'\n\nAccording to people who knew Geon and Christian well, their relationship was always tempestuous. People closest to Christian say that recently they found it harder and harder to see or talk to him. They claim that Geon particularly didn't like him having female friends.\n\nNeighbours say they often heard Christian and Geon arguing, and one close neighbour says he had to move out of the building because he couldn't take the rows any more. Friends also say Christian hated living in the dingy apartment block, which faces the glaring neon signs of the Seventh Veil strip club on Sunset Boulevard, and yearned for the forests and lakes of Washington.\n\nLast summer he became even more depressed and started drinking more heavily when he failed his welding exam. Despite these problems, friends and relatives are now asking why, when he was so seriously ill with double pneumonia, was he not taken to hospital until he collapsed.\n\nWhat is most curious and ironic in the aftermath of Christian's death is that whatever he may still be owed from Marlon's estate (which could be millions) will now go to Anna Kashfi, his mother, the person Brando hated most. The irony is not lost on George Englund, Marlon's oldest friend.\n\n'The aftermath of Marlon's life is even more amazing and dismaying than the life he lived,' says Englund. He calls what has come after him, 'a twisted ball of yarn'. But Englund had tremendous sympathy for Christian, whose relationship with Marlon he saw played out over many years in tragedy.\n\n'Marlon and I made a picture together called The Ugly American,' Englund recalls. 'In it an Asian leader is talking to hundreds of followers and he says, \"There's an old saying: When two elephants fight, the grass is wounded.\" That's the way I see Christian. He was the wounded grass on which two ferocious elephants fought all those years.'"
