        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Christian Brando, the troubled son of actor Marlon Brando, who made headlines in 1990 when he was arrested in the shooting death of his half-sister”s boyfriend, died early Saturday. He was 49.\n\nBrando died from complications of pneumonia at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles, said David J. Seeley, an attorney for Marlon Brando”s estate.\n\nThe legal proceedings against Brando for the killing of Dag Drollet caused a firestorm of media attention. His legendary father used his estate to post the $2 million bond for his son and later offered rambling and emotional testimony pleading for leniency for the oldest of his nine children.\n\nChristian Brando, then 32, eventually pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the death of 26-year-old Drollet, the lover of Cheyenne Brando, who was then pregnant by him. Brando was given a 10-year prison sentence and served nearly five years at the California Men”s Colony at San Luis Obispo. He was sentenced to three years probation.\n\nYears later, Christian Brando would be called to court in another high-profile legal case, the civil trial of Robert Blake in the murder of his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley.\n\nChristian Brando was born in Los Angeles on May 11, 1958. His mother was Marlon Brando”s first wife, the Calcutta, India-born actress Anna Kashfi. Christian was a toddler when the couple separated and divorced. A protracted custody battle ensued.\n\nKashfi initially was awarded custody of her son, but that order was removed five years later when a judge declared that her “reliance on drugs and alcohol” contributed to an uncontrollable temper. The court ordered that Christian, then 6, live with the actor”s older sister. By 1972, Marlon Brando, who by that time had married twice more and had three more children, was granted custody of Christian, who was raised by nannies and sent to boarding school.\n\nBut while the actor was out of the country filming “Last Tango in Paris,” Kashfi allegedly kidnapped Christian and took him to Mexico. The boy eventually was found living in a tent and sick with bronchitis.\n\nKashfi continued to press for custody but gave up her struggle in 1974 when her ex-husband pledged that she would get reasonable visitation rights with her son.\n\nChristian dropped out of school in 11th grade and began drinking and using LSD, tried a variety of jobs, including welder and tree trimmer, and lived for a time in Alaska, piloting a barge for a fish processor during the summers. He tried his hand at acting but mostly lived for years with his father in Brando”s hilltop Los Angeles estate.\n\nIt was there that on May 16, 1990, Christian Brando confronted Drollet after Cheyenne confided that he had been beating her.\n\nIn an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Brando said that later revelations about Cheyenne”s mental health made him later question whether she was ever beaten by Drollet.\n\n“I feel like a complete chump for believing her,” he said.\n\nIn pleading for a reduced sentence for his son, the elder Brando took the stand and said: “I think that perhaps I failed as a father.”\n\n“I”m certain that there were things that I could have done differently, had I known better at the time,” the elder Brando said, at times choking back tears. “But I didn”t.”\n\nWhile in prison, Christian Brando completed his high school equivalency degree and worked in a vocational education machine shop.\n\nIn 1995, Cheyenne hanged herself at her mother”s home outside Papeete, the French Polynesian capital on the island of Tahiti. She was 25. Cheyenne was the daughter of Marlon Brando and Tarita Teriipaia, who were married after appearing together in the 1962 film “Mutiny on the Bounty.” Cheyenne”s son, Tuki, was being raised in Tahiti by Drollet”s parents.\n\nMarlon Brando died at 80 on July 1, 2004.\n\nIn 2005, Christian Brando was called to testify in Blake”s civil trial. But Brando, who was briefly romantically involved with Bakley, invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to answer questions about his relationship with her. He was fined $1,000 for contempt of court. When Bakley had a baby girl in June 2000, she named her Christian Shannon Brando and led Brando to believe he was the father. A paternity test later established that Blake was the father and the baby”s name was changed to Rose Sophia Lenore Blake.\n\nLos Angeles police investigated and cleared Brando of any involvement in the May 4, 2001, killing of Bakley.\n\nBut Brando”s troubles with the law continued.\n\nIn 2005, he was charged with two counts of spousal abuse against his then-wife Deborah Brando. He pleaded no contest and was placed on three years probation and ordered to undergo drug and alcohol rehabilitation, as well as a spousal abuse prevention program.\n\nHe and his ex-wife filed civil suits against each other but they were settled quietly in 2007.\n\nIn addition to his mother, Brando”s survivors include six half-brothers and half-sisters."
