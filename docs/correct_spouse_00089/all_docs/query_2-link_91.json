        "text": "<h3>Singer stayed closeted, feared hurting group</h3>NEW YORK - Lance Bass, a band member of \\'N Sync, says he\\'s gay and in a \"very stable\" relationship with a reality show star.Bass, who formed \\'N Sync with Justin Timberlake, JC Chasez, Joey Fatone and Chris Kirkpatrick, tells People magazine on its Web site that he didn\\'t earlier disclose his sexuality because he didn\\'t want to affect the group\\'s popularity.\"I knew that I was in this popular band and I had four other guys\\' careers in my hand, and I knew that if I ever acted on it or even said (that I was gay), it would overpower everything,\" he tells People.Bass says he wondered if his coming out could prompt \"the end of \\'N Sync.\" He explains, \"So I had that weight on me of like, \\'Wow, if I ever let anyone know, it\\'s bad.\\' So I just never did.\"The singer says he\\'s in a \"very stable\" relationship with 32-year-old actor Reichen Lehmkuhl, winner of season four of CBS\\' \"Amazing Race.\"As for why he\\'s talking about this now, Bass says, \"The main reason I wanted to speak my mind was that (the rumors) really were starting to affect my daily life. Now it feels like it\\'s on my terms.\"<h3>Brando abuse lawsuit won\\'t be dismissed</h3>LOS ANGELES - A judge again refused to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the wife and stepdaughter of Christian Brando alleging they were often abused and threatened by him.Deborah Brando and her 13-year-old daughter filed suit in December citing violation of their civil rights, assault, domestic violence, battery and emotional distress.Superior Court Judge Edward A. Ferns rejected a motion to dismiss the case in April, and on Tuesday Ferns said he saw nothing different to change his mind.Attorney Brian Oxman, representing Deborah Brando, said he was pleased with Ferns\\' ruling.Brando and his wife met in 1990, the year he pleaded guilty to manslaughter for killing his sister\\'s boyfriend Dag Drollet. Christian Brando spent six years in prison. They married in October 2004 and divorced earlier this year.The lawsuit, which seeks unspecified monetary damages, said Christian Brando, now 48, \"began a pattern of domestic violence, sexual abuse and physical assaults and batteries against Ms. Brando and her daughter.\""
