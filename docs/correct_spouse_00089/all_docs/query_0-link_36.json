        "text": "'Perhaps I failed as a father,\" said Marlon Brando during the court hearing in May 1990 in defence of his son Christian, who had been arrested for the murder of his half-sister's boyfriend. \"The tendency is always to blame the other person. There were things I could have done differently. I did the best I could.\"\n\nCan blame be apportioned to anyone for the tormented life of Christian Brando, who has died of pneumonia aged 49? Though having the ostensible advantage of being the first born of one of the most famous actors in film history, few children could have had a more unstable childhood.\n\nChristian, named after the French actor Christian Marquand, was not yet a year old when his parents divorced. Marlon had met 21-year-old Anna Kashfi at Paramount Studios in 1955, when she was playing a Hindu girl in The Mountain. Always attracted by the exotic - his second wife was Mexican, his third Tahitian - Marlon believed Kashfi to be the daughter of wealthy Calcutta parents. In truth, she was Joanna O'Callaghan, an ex-waitress and model from Cardiff, the daughter of a Welsh factory worker. (She later claimed that he was her stepfather and she was half-Indian.)\n\nThe couple quarrelled almost immediately. With Brando openly flaunting his sexual conquests, Kashfi began to use barbiturates and drink heavily. At their divorce, Christian became the subject of a bitter battle, only ending when Brando won custody of his son, aged 13. This was granted after Kashfi had Christian, who she called Devi, kidnapped from school and taken to Mexico, for which she was later arrested.\n\nBy then, Brando was married to Tarita, and was shuttling back and forth between Hollywood and his private island near Tahiti. Christian, who was brought up by an assortment of nannies and servants, was a reluctant witness to his father's philandering. \"The family kept changing shape,\" he once said. \"I'd sit down at the breakfast table and say, 'Who are you?'\"\n\nMarlon Brando may have been a great actor, but the role of a father was beyond him. Significantly, in his 39-film career Brando played a parent on screen only three times, including his 10-minute appearance as Superman's father in Superman (1978). \"This is a false world,\" he said. \"It's been a struggle to try to preserve my sanity and sense of reality taken away by success. I have to fight hard to preserve that sense of reality so as to bring up my children.\"\n\nChristian was often expected to be the parent to some of Brando's other children. He felt especially protective towards his half-sister Cheyenne, Tarita's daughter, who suffered from schizophrenia, and alcohol and drug abuse.\n\nChristian, too, was taking drugs and drinking heavily, although he had a job as a welder. A high-school dropout, he was struggling to establish his own identity while enjoying the benefits of his father's wealth and fame. However, the dark, good-looking youngster did try his hand at acting. By the time he was 10, he had appeared in two Hollywood movies under the name of Gary Brown, The Secret Life of an American Wife and I Love You, Alice B Toklas (both 1968). Fifteen years later, Barbra Streisand gave him a bit part as a yeshiva student in Yentl (1983), and he had his biggest role as a terrorist in a low-budget Italian movie called La Posta In Gioco (1988). But the career led nowhere.\n\nChristian was 22 when he married his longtime girlfriend Mary McKenna. They were divorced six years later, with McKenna claiming that Christian had threatened to kill her and had abused her physically. Certainly, he was subject to fits of violence. So when Cheyenne told him that her Tahitian boyfriend Dag Drollet, the father of her unborn child, beat her regularly, he saw red.\n\nNot realising that she was lying, Christian, who was extremely drunk, arrived at his father's Los Angeles mansion, where Cheyenne and Drollet were staying in May 1990, carrying a .45-calibre revolver. \"I did not go into that room to kill Dag Drollet. I just wanted to scare him,\" he explained. He later told the court that the gun went off accidentally and a single bullet hit Drollet in the head. \"I just sat there and watched the life go out of this guy,\" he declared.\n\nChristian was charged with murder and being in possession of illegal weapons, a stockpile of which were found in his home. After months of court hearings, during which Marlon, in one of his greatest performances, delivered a heartfelt plea for mercy as a loving, but inept father, Christian was given a 10-year sentence for voluntary manslaughter. He served half his sentence. (Cheyenne, who did not testify at the trial, gave birth in Tahiti to Drollet's son, Taki. She hanged herself in 1995.)\n\nIn 2001, Christian was implicated in the murder of actor Robert Blake's wife, Bonnie Lee, who he was dating, but was acquitted. He tried to put his life together again by joining Alcoholics Anonymous, continuing his welding and marrying Deborah Presley (who claimed to be the unrecognised daughter of Elvis Presley) in 2004. But during the marriage, Christian was sentenced to three years probation for spousal abuse. The marriage lasted less than a year. Unlike his father, who had nine children, Christian Brando had none.\n\nÂ· Christian Brando, actor, born May 11 1958; died January 26 2008"
