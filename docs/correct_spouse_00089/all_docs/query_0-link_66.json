        "text": ",\n\nPriscilla Presley was signing copies of her coffee-table book ELVIS BY THE PRESLEYS at a recent event in Los Angeles, when who walked in but Deborah Presley Brando! Deborah is apparently the daughter Elvis had with his first love, Barbara Jean Lewis, when he was starting out in the music business – long before he met Priscilla. Elvis helped Barbara out with some money, but they never married. Priscilla has never really acknowledged Deborah or met her. Deborah has also written a book, MEMOIRS OF A STARSEED CHILD – ELVIS, MARLON, CHRISTIAN, AND ME about HER life without her father and her marriage to Christian Brando. Priscilla’s entourage must have flinched when Deborah appeared at Priscilla’s event, but they allowed her to approach Priscilla. Deborah gave Priscilla a copy of HER book and said “I’ve always wanted to meet you!” To her credit, Priscilla was quite gracious and kind to Deborah. Nice to know the two writers were civil, after all these years…\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nIf at first you don’t succeed, try try again is exactly what Jennifer Lopez is doing. First she applied that proverbial saying to Ben Affleck, marrying him 20 years after their ill-fated first engagement – and now she’s applying it to her memoir. In 2014, Jennifer released her first book, True Love and while it made the bestsellers list, it paled in comparison to sales for other celebrity tell-alls. Jen has decided to write True Love Volume 2, which is the working title of her current memoir. Expect her to reveal how she and Ben reconciled after two decades, her co-parenting with Marc Anthony, and her struggles and successes as a Latina in Hollywood. A publishing insider says this book is projected to outsell her previous one by a mile! Let’s face it, a lot has happened since her first book…\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA Busy Jennifer promoting her movie This Is Me…Now in NYC (that bodyguard behind her looks ready for action!)\n\nThanks to two sons in the NFL and the world’s biggest celebrity as her likely daughter-in-law, it’s no surprise that Donna Kelce quietly has a 7-figure book deal in place to write her memoir. Donna and her ex-husband Ed stayed married for years – even though the romantic part of their relationship ended quite some time before that. They did that to give their sons Jason and Travis a two parent household, dividing their time with their sons’ various athletic commitments. Now Donna has been tapped to write a book, with a working title of America’s Mom, to share her parenting tips as well as the untold stories and sacrifices of her life. Our source says that Travis’ better half, Taylor Swift, encouraged Donna to tell her story and share her advice. She’s working with a ghostwriter and the goal is to release the tell-all just in time for the 2024-2025 NFL kickoff season.\n\nPhoto: Instagram\n\nAs we previously reported, Meghan Markle is quietly working on her own autobiography after her husband Prince Harry’s tell-all, Spare, became a worldwide best seller. Although Meg has yet to CONFIRM she’s writing this book, my source reveals that not only has she written approximately one-third of the manuscript, but she’s even come up with the title. As of now – and remember this could change – she wants to call the book Shade! The reason? The word used to be derogatory towards blacks, and according to the source, it is also the the word used by someone in the royal family questioning the possible skin tone of Meg and Harry’s then unborn son, Archie. As our source explains, Meghan feels the royals shaded her, so that’s why she chose that as the working title. Plus, Megan liked that Harry’s book had a one word title and she wants to follow in his literary footsteps.\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nIs Matthew Perry’s former Century City condo cursed? In his autobiography, Friends, Lovers and The Big Terrible Thing, the late actor wrote about some DARK times in his penthouse condominium at The Century, one of the premier full service buildings in LA. Matthew eventually sold the condo to a tech billionaire, but the guy barely moved in before deciding it wasn’t for him, so he sold it to Rihanna for a loss. Now superstitious Rihanna isn’t sure SHE wants to move into the sprawling condominium, given the Matthew connection, so she’s thinking of selling it and might even have to take a loss. Even though he died elsewhere, the condo has a negative vibe since Matthew wrote about how unhappy he was there.\n\nJust a few years ago, Jennifer Aniston revealed she had NO plans anytime soon to write her memoir, but Matthew Perry’s unexpected death has made Jen rethink this. Jen is obviously devastated and still in shock over the loss of her Friends costar, but she’s found some comfort in knowing Matthew was able to share his story – including his struggles with addictions – with the world before passing. According to a friend, Jen has had a change of heart at writing her own story so she’s quietly working on a manuscript. From her challenging relationship with her mom, to her time on Friends, and of course her failed marriage to Brad Pitt, Jen is ready to tell her story. My source says that well-mannered Jen won’t throw anyone under the bus, and is already reaching out to get permission from anyone she plans to mention.\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nSeems like you couldn’t cruise the internet without seeing Jada Pinkett Smith EVERYWHERE, promoting her new book Worthy this week. And it IS full of bombshells about life with and without her husband Will. Although Will’s successful autobiography Will was just released in 2021, it was written BEFORE his infamous 2022 Oscar outburst where he punched Chris Rock. Looks like Jada’s success has inspired Will to write ANOTHER book – explaining the Oscar slap and his complicated life with Jada. He wants to clarify a lot of things with HIS side of the story about their separation etc. Will plans to announce it sometime next year because he wants Jada to have her moment. It’s the battle of the books…\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nSandra Bullock is getting ready to spill the beans on her life story and it was her late partner, Bryan Randall, who encouraged her to do it. She’s lived through plenty of ups and downs, and among the highs are her adopted children and winning an Oscar. The lows include having her then spouse Jesse James cheat on her, and recently losing the love of her life Bryan to ALS. Through it all, Sandra has remained stoically tight lipped. After her divorce from Jesse, Sandra turned down millions to write her autobiography. It was Bryan who inspired her to tell her entire story and his, hoping to shed some light on ALS as well as inspire people with her perseverance. A publishing source reveals Sandra could get over $10 million for the book, and just in case we needed another reason to love her, she plans on donating the proceeds to ALS research.\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nThere’s one group of people who might NOT be so thrilled that the strikes in Hollywood seem to be ending – those in charge of promoting Britney Spears’ upcoming memoir, The Woman In Me. Britney‘s tell-all tome is supposed to hit bookstands on October 24, but according to our insider, her publishers were NOT upset that the Hollywood strikes might have prevented her from doing publicity to promote the autobiography. Now that the strike seem to be ending, some connected to the project fear that Britney is in no mental condition to go on a grueling book tour. If she babbles incoherently, it’s going to be a hard sell to make any reader believe she wrote any of the book!\n\nInstagram Photo of Britney doing her knife dance\n\nIt’s no secret that out of the three kids the late Ivana Trump had with her ex-husband Donald, she was closest to her daughter, Ivanka. According to a family friend, Ivanka wants to honor her mom by publishing a coffee table book on her opulent life. From big hair to extravagant jewels and palatial mansions, Ivana had a lavish style all her own. Although Ivanka prefers a more to toned down aesthetic, she appreciated her mom’s love of glamour. She’s sorting through a lifetime of photos and is writing anecdotes to go along with the snapshots she chooses to include in her book.\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA Ivanka and Ivana in 2007"
