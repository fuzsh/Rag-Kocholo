        "text": "Lily starts off stuck living in an unloving, abusive household and decides to free herself from the negative atmosphere that she had been living in her whole life. Lily is perpetually abused by her father. He forces her to kneel on Martha White's, gets exasperated every time she speaks, and yells at her for no reason. Lily is not the only one noticing the terrible treatment, Rosaleen does too. Once after Lily had to kneel on the Martha White's Rosaleen said to her, “Look at you, child. Look what he’s done to you” (Kidd 25). Noticing the unloving treatment Lily gets, Rosaleen knew that their household was demoralizing place for Lily to be in, which is why she didn’t question when Lily when she later runs away. Lily one day realizes she needs to do something about her horrible life at home. While sitting in her room she hears a voice in her\n\nIn exactly fifty pages, Lily goes from, “My mother had left me. I hate her” (Kidd 251) to “… I have forgiven us both…” (Kidd 301). For the first thirteen of fourteen chapters, Lily hates her mother, and she makes this very clear. She directly tells August: “My mother had left me. I hate her” (Kidd 251). It’s not until August explains that Lily’s mother, Deborah, “... was practically skin and bone… And all she did was cry for a week,” that Lily starts to understand why she had to leave: she was being treated abusively by T. Ray (Kidd 252). Once Lily has this information, she begins the healing and forgiving process. This process is also helped along by Lily finally knowing the full truth about her mother’s mysterious death. The fact that Lily physically chases T. Ray as he’s about to leave the Boatwright’s house shows that she is ready to know, once and for all, the truth about her mother’s death. She is prepared for the possibility that she did in fact kill her mother. By allowing herself to know the truth, she forgives herself and her mother for leaving. She even says, “I guess I have forgiven us both, although sometimes in the night my dreams will take me back to the sadness, and I have to wake up and forgive us again” (Kidd 301). Progress in the process of Lily forgiving herself and her mom is clearly shown. Overall, she has condoned the actions of her mother, but still has little “flashbacks” or moments of weakness where she has to forgive\n\nIn addition to the Black Mary, Rosaleen showers Lily with love and support. Rosaleen treats Lily like she is her own daughter. Rosaleen accepts the way Lily is and has faith in her. \"'Here you go. Happy Birthday\" (28). Rosaleen cares about Lily and knows when something is important to her, like her Birthday. Lily never gets anything from T-Ray on her Birthday, but Rosaleen cares so much about her that she still gets Lily something. Rosaleen can tell when Lily is in pain or is sad like most mothers can. \"'Well why don't we sit down on the side of the road awhile?'\" (28). Rosaleen acknowledges the fact that Lily feels upset, and is comfortable expressing the need to rest and relax. Since Lily has known Rosaleen a long time she is comfortable expressing herself around Rosaleen and knows that Rosaleen will listen to her problems and insecurities. \"'I was the only one who knew that despite her sharp ways, her heart was more tender than a flower skin and she loved me beyond reason'\" (11). Rosaleen and Lily have a connection that most mothers and daughters have. They care\n\nRay looked at Lily he realized that he couldn't stand her anymore because she looked too much like Deborah, which is when August offers him a way out of the uncomfortable situation. On page 298 she said \"Mr. Owens, you would be doing Lily and the rest of us a favor by leaving her here...We love Lily, and we'll take care of her I promise you that. We'll start her in school here and keep her straight.\" August gives T. Ray a way out of taking care of his daughter and having to be reminded of Deborah and it also solves the major conflict of whether Lily and Rosaleen are going to have to back to Sylvan and stay with T. Ray or whether she will be able to stay with the Boatwrights. Adding on, just as T. Ray is about to leave Lily runs up to him, and asks him what really happened that day when her mother died and on page 299 it states \"You didn't mean it, but it was you...Maybe he was telling me the truth, but you could never know a hundred percent with T. Ray.\" This also is a very important part of the novel because Lily realizes she lost her real mother but when she looks at the porch she has 8 other mothers. On page 302 it states \"All these mothers. I have more mothers than any eight girls off the street.\" This quote is very important because it finally dawns on Lily that she isn't alone, and she doesn't just have one mother but eight of them. Furthermore, another conflict that is resolved, is about Lily breaking Rosaleen out of jail. On page 301 it states \"He says they\n\nT. Ray breaks the news that Lily’s mom had left Lily with him and had come back to pack up her stuff when the big argument between he and Lily’s mom happened. At that point, Lily has enough of T. Ray, so she starts to have a mini-mental breakdown. Amidst the chaos going on inside her mind, she hears a voice say, “Lily Melissa Owens, your jar is open” (41). That little voice means all the difference in the world to Lily. To Lily, it is as if her mother is saying to leave T. Ray and start a new life. Right then she knows that she has to\n\nOn the day of December 17, 1760 Deborah Sampson was born in Plympton, Massachusetts. She was the oldest of the other 5 siblings she had Sylvia, Ephraim, Hanna, Jhonathan III, Elisha, and Nehemiah. Her birth parents are Deborah Bradford Sampson and Jonathan Sampson. Right before her 5th birthday her father left the family and no one ever heard from him after that. When she was around the age of 8-10 she became an indentured servant. The only education she got was from the boys in the family from what they had learned in school. When she was the age of 15 she started learning other types of things like sewing, spinning, and riding horses. Once she was 18 she was freed from being an indentured servant.\n\nThis winter has really taken a toll on me and my life. For a long time have I not been able to find the joy and happiness in my heart. I have tried to read books but their special effect has evaded me. I feel that I am living in a world of dread anxiety and doubt. At the source of this dread was a story I wrote and sent to Mr. Anagnos of the Perkins Institution for the blind. The story was titled, “The Frost King” and I wrote it for his birthday. Mr. Anagnos enjoyed his present so much that he published it in a report at Perkins Institution. Unfortunately when my story was read, it was almost identical to a story called “The Frost Fairies” written by an author by the name of Margaret T. Canby who had written the story years before I was born. The two stories were so alike that i was sure it had been read to me and that my story was in fact a plagiarism. I was devastated and I couldn't get past the fact that I had disgraced myself. Mr. Anagnos was suspicious and was under the impression that Miss Sullivan and I had purposely stolen someone else's work to win over his favor. I was brought before a court made up of teachers and administration stalking my every move. They separated me from Miss Sullivan and questioned me. With every question asked i could feel the suspicion and disappointment in\n\nThe story of Deborah and Jael begins in Judges 4, in which Deborah the prophetess grants military wisdom to the Israelites in how best to handle their plight at the hands of King Jabin of Canaan. Deborah sends for the military leader Barak, son of Abinoam, and when he arrives she advises him in the name of Yahweh to take 10,000 men to Mount Tabor. While they wait, she would draw out Sisera, the leader of the Canaanite army under King Jabin, and guide him into the crosshairs of Barak and his men. Barak hesitantly agrees and together, he and Deborah leave to gather men and for Deborah to lure Sisera to the battle (The Harper Collins Study Bible, Judges 4:1-10)."
