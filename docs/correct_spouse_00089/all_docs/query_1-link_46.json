        "text": "(Los Angeles-AP) December 29, 2005 - A lawsuit filed by his ex-wife and stepdaughter accuses actor Christian Brando of abuse and death threats.\n\nA lawyer for Deborah Brando and her 13-year-old daughter says the suit also alleges violation of their civil rights, assault, domestic violence, battery and emotional distress. Attorney Brian Oxman says unspecified damages are being sought.\n\nBrando attorney Bruce Margolin says neither he nor Brando have seen the lawsuit and can't comment.\n\nBrando pleaded guilty to charges of spousal abuse in January and was sentenced to drug and alcohol rehab and three years of probation.\n\nHe and his ex-wife met in 1990, the same year he pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter for the shooting death of his half-sister's boyfriend. Brando, the son of the late actor Marlon Brando, served five years in prison."
