        "text": "LOS ANGELES – Christian Brando, the troubled eldest son of famed actor Marlon Brando, has died from pneumonia at a Los Angeles hospital, an attorney said Saturday.\n\nMr. Brando, 49, died Saturday morning at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center, said David Seeley, an attorney representing Marlon Brando’s estate.\n\nSeeley said Mr. Brando was taken to the hospital on Jan. 11. There are no funeral plans yet scheduled, he added.\n\n“This is a sad and difficult time for the family,” Seeley said.\n\nMr. Brando was the eldest of the actor’s nine children who included one adopted daughter, according to a will the Oscar-winner left following his death in 2004. Mr. Brando’s mother was actress Anna Kashfi. She and Marlon Brando divorced after a year. That touched off a 16-year custody battle for Christian, who was 5 months old at the time of the separation.\n\nBorn on May 11, 1958, Mr. Brando was a high school dropout and never had much of a career. He had small roles in a handful of movies, including 1968’s “I Love You, Alice B. Toklas!” but he was better known for his violent brushes with the law.\n\nHe spent five years in prison after pleading guilty to manslaughter in 1990 for killing his sister’s boyfriend, Dag Drollet, at the Brando family’s hilltop estate.\n\nMr. Brando said he accidentally shot Drollet as they struggled for a gun during an argument over whether Drollet, 26, had beaten Mr. Brando’s pregnant half-sister, Cheyenne.\n\nCheyenne later gave birth to Drollet’s son but lost custody of the child. She hanged herself in 1995. She was 25. Family associates said she had been distraught since the death of her boyfriend.\n\nIn a 1991 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Mr. Brando said he never intended to kill Drollet.\n\n“I just wanted to scare him,” but then Drollet tried to grab the weapon and it went off, Mr. Brando said.\n\n“I just sat there and watched the life go out of this guy,” Mr. Brando said.\n\nAt his son’s trial, Marlon Brando pleaded for leniency, telling the court: “I think that perhaps I failed as a father.”\n\nWhile in prison, Mr. Brando worked in a machine shop and earned his high school equivalency degree.\n\n“I found him to be an extremely personable, bright gentleman,” said Bruce Margolin, an attorney who represented Mr. Brando. “He was very well-loved in his family. I think his life was too short.”\n\nMr. Brando’s ex-wife, Deborah Brando, sued him for domestic violence in 2005. She claimed that shortly after their 2004 marriage, Mr. Brando repeatedly beat her and threatened to kill her in the presence of her teenage daughter.\n\nMr. Brando countersued, alleging that his ex-wife broke into his home and beat him because he wanted to annul their marriage only 10 weeks after exchanging vows.\n\nThe suits were settled last year on undisclosed terms.\n\nMr. Brando was charged in January 2005 with two counts of spousal abuse and he later pleaded no contest. He was placed on three years’ probation and ordered to drug and alcohol rehabilitation as well as a spousal-abuse prevention program.\n\nMr. Brando also was the one-time lover of Bonnie Lee Bakley, who was shot to death in 2001. At one time, Bakley claimed Mr. Brando had fathered her child and even named the girl Christian Shannon Brando. It was changed after a paternity test showed the girl’s father was actor Robert Blake, whom Bakley later married.\n\nBlake was tried for her murder and acquitted but later ordered to pay $30 million in a wrongful death lawsuit. During that civil case, Blake’s lawyer suggested Mr. Brando was the killer, although police never implicated him.\n\nMr. Brando, who had denied any involvement, invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination on the stand during the trial."
