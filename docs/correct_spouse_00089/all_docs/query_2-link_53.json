        "text": "Marlon Brandoâs oldest kid, Christian Devi Brando (May 11, 1958 â January 26, 2008), was an infrequent actress and the eldest of Marlon Brandoâs children. At his fatherâs Mulholland Drive home in the Hollywood Hills, Christian Brando fatally shot Dag Drollet, the lover of his half-sister Cheyenne, on May 16, 1990, resulting in the death of Dag Drollet. The family turmoil and subsequent trial received a great deal of attention that year. He entered a guilty plea to manslaughter in 1991 and was sentenced to jail for the crime. In 1996, he was granted his freedom. It was revealed that Brando had a romantic connection with Bonnie Lee Bakley, and that he may have been involved in her murder when evidence was presented during Robert Blakeâs trial for the 2001 death of his wife, Bonnie Lee Bakley, in 2004. After pleading no guilty to spousal abuse of his then-wife Deborah in 2005, Brando was sentenced to one year probation. On January 26, 2008, he passed away from pneumonia at the age of 49.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nChristian Brando Net Worth : $ 9 Million\n\nChristian Brando Wiki\n\nChristian Brando FAQ\n\nChristian Brando Net Worth : $ 9 Million\n\nLets check out updated 2021 Christian Brando Net Worth Income Salary report which is given below :\n\nChristian Brandoâs Salary / Income:\n\nPer Year: $ 4,00,000\n\nPer Month: $ 32,000\n\nPer Week: $ 8,000\n\nPer Day:Per Hour:Per Minute:Per Second:$ 1140$ 19$ 0.3$ 0.05\n\nChristian Brando Wiki\n\nFull NameChristian Devi BrandoNet Worth$9 MillionDate Of BirthMay 11, 1958Died2008-01-26Place Of BirthLos Angeles, California, USAProfessionActor\n\nChristian Brando FAQ\n\nHow did Christian Brando get so rich?\n\nWhat is Christian Brando Earning per day ?\n\nLets check out Christian Brando Wife / Husand Net Worth ?\n\nHow much does Christian Brando make per day?\n\nHow much Christian Brando Net Worth ?\n\nHow Christian Brando become rich ?\n\nHow does Christian Brando make money ?\n\nWhat is Christian Brando Income ?\n\nHow much Christian Brando Salary ?\n\nHow old is Christian Brando Age ?\n\nHow tall is Christian Brando Height ?\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJuYp7a0wMiapWaaopa7pbuMp5ytZaekv7W0jKKlnKedmnq0rcuaqbJllZa%2Fr7XNoKpmmpmktLOtz6GwaA%3D%3D\n\n← Previous Post\n\nNext Post →"
