        "text": "Christian Brando, the eldest son of the late legendary actor Marlon Brando, is reported by several Web sites to have died at 1:47 a.m. today at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\nA hospital official, contacted by the Daily News, refused to confirm Brando’s death, but said at 12:15 p.m. that the hospital would issue a statement shortly.\n\nBrando, 49, was hospitalized Jan. 11 with pneumonia.\n\nMonday, his attorney Benjamin Brin said, “The prognosis is for a complete recovery. He’s going to be OK.”\n\nBut another friend, who asked not to be identified, said he was in grave condition. “He’s … not doing very well. He has pneumonia with complications,” the friend told Reuters.\n\nChristian Brando was born May 11, 1958, as the result of an affair between his father and actress Anna Kashfi.\n\nChristian pled guilty to manslaughter in 1990 for killing his sister’s boyfriend, Dag Drollet, and spent six years in prison.\n\nIn 2005, he pled guilty to spousal abuse with his then-wife Deborah Presley and was placed on probation."
