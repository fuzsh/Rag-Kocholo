Christian Brando, son of late actor Marlon Brando, has been sued by his ex-wife and stepdaughter, who alleged he abused and threatened to kill them, their attorney said Thursday.

Deborah Brando and her 13-year-old daughter filed a lawsuit against Brando in Superior Court for violation of their civil rights, as well as assault, domestic violence, battery and emotional distress. They are seeking unspecified damages, lawyer Brian Oxman said.

Brando and his ex-wife married in October, 2004, and divorced earlier this year, Oxman said. AP
