Priscilla Presley was in shock when Elvis Presley's alleged love child attended and stood in front of her at a book signing event, as told by a spiritual seer. Elvis Presley's family history has some surprises, especially involving Deborah Presley Brando. While not everyone may be familiar with her, she has been described as potentially Elvis' eldest daughter, possibly born out of wedlock. What adds to the intrigue is her marriage to the late Christian Brando, son of Marlon Brando.

Venting Sessions and Book Signing Appearance

Deborah contacted Ed Lozzi, a public relations specialist based in Beverly Hills, for the contact information of a spiritual seer named John Cohan. She believed Lozzi could connect her with Cohan due to their shared acquaintances.

Speaking to Cindy Adams of the New York Post, Cohan revealed that Deborah repeatedly contacted him, bombarding him with texts, requests for a reading, and inquiries about his fees. According to Cohan, their conversations turned into venting sessions about various personal matters, and despite her persistence, he never actually provided her with a reading. Eventually, he stopped responding to her messages altogether.

Cohan shared about Deborah's unexpected appearance at a book signing event hosted by Priscilla Presley, Elvis Presley's former wife. Deborah claimed to have had conversations with Lisa Marie Presley, Elvis' daughter, during which Lisa allegedly dismissed her significance in her life.

Cohan was adamant about the authenticity of these claims and was even willing to undergo a lie detector test to confirm these were Deborah's own words. He also mentioned that Deborah has authored a book, although its availability remains unclear.

Deborah's Intergenerational Journey

Deborah recently released her memoir, "Memoirs of a Starseed Child: Elvis, Marlon, Christian and Me." The memoir primarily focuses on her intergenerational journey and delves into her life before and after the revelation of her paternity.

One day, in 1954, at Howard Simpson's recording studio in Charlotte, North Carolina, Elvis met Barbara Jean, who would become the secret love of his life. Two years later, in March 1956, Deborah Delaine was born, coinciding with the height of Elvis' fame. Although Deborah had her suspicions, her mother did not confirm Elvis as her biological father until August 16, 1977, the day Elvis passed away.

This memoir answers inquiries surrounding Deborah's mother's relationship with Elvis when she was only 15. It also provides insights into the dynamics of the Presley family, including endorsements and betrayals. It also delves into Deborah's marriage to Christian Brando, the eldest son of Marlon Brando. Additionally, the book presents forensic and scientific evidence and court documents to support its narrative.

A Call for Family Unity and Recognition

In January 2023, Deborah made a public statement amid Lisa Presley's hospitalization. Upon learning of her biological sister, Lisa Marie Presley's hospitalization, Deborah felt compelled to reach out to her, emphasizing the importance of love and family.

She acknowledged the pervasive myth surrounding Lisa Marie being Elvis Presley's only child while asserting her existence as his eldest daughter, conceived in 1955. Deborah lamented the influence of fame and money in driving a wedge between family members and called for recognition of the truth and acknowledgment of all of Elvis's children.

Expressing concern for Lisa Marie's well-being, Deborah criticized the pressures of fame and its toll on her sister. She supported her extended family, acknowledging their shared connection and heritage beyond the spotlight.

In closing, Deborah extended her love and condolences to her nieces and other family members, emphasizing the importance of recognizing and embracing their shared familial bonds.
