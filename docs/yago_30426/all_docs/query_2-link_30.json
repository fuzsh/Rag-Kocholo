        "text": "The bittersweet pathos runs deeper in this sequel to The Fiddler in Barly. Metabel is now sixteen, “small for her age, with rain-colored eyes.” Her father has died:\n\nHe forgot the home he had left, the small bare shack on public ground at the village edge, the cheerless faces of his neighbors, the preacher’s last grave words, uttered without much hope; he forgot his poverty and his pain, and he forgot his daughter Metabel, baptized Mehitabel, to whom he left his bedding, an old hammer, a corncob pipe, some pans for cooking, and a broken chair.\n\nAlone, except for the company of the little dog Musket, she sets out one day for Hemlock, the small mountain that stands over Barly. Lost as night falls, she comes to a cottage where an old farmer named Henry and his nephew Joseph, a woodcutter, take her in. Curiously, they tell her that they have never heard of Barly and, indeed, in the morning Metabel sees that the road back to Barly has disappeared. Weeks go by and she is content to stay with Henry and Joseph, cooking and cleaning for them. They, in turn are glad to have her stay with them, and Metabel and Joseph fall in love.\n\nAs in The Fiddler in Barly, the interactions between the human characters are mirrored by those among the animals. Musket in particular meets a fesity younger dog named Susan and struggles to keep his equilibrium. Musket fancies himself older and experienced, indifferent to the storms of sexual passion and the gnawings of jealousy and ego. He is at one point approached by a mouse engaged to be married, who wants advice since his fiancee “is not a virgin. She has already been unfaithful to a number of my friends. Nevertheless, to be near her fills me with rapture.” Musket calmly counsels the mouse to marry: experience is good, he says. He even tells a scandalized horse: “Women should sin a little before they are married, for the joy and the experience.”\n\nYet, when he meets Susan he finds himself suddenly insecure over the possibility of rejection, or betrayal, a parallel to Metabel, whose insecurities prod her to invent stories about boyfriends back in Barly as a means to defend her ego around Joseph. And when Musket has his chance with Susan he does not seem to be able to, well, perform. “Never mind,” Susan tries to reassure him as they both trot back from the woods, “I am not sad about this, really. Supposing that in the future we simply confine ourselves to conversation?”\n\nBut in addition to humans and human-like animals, Nathan introduces an important, third kind of character. Metabel meets a “little man dressed in green” who explains that he is the god of “good humor.” This “very small god” contrasts himself to the big gods of the world, who fight with each other in heaven while “their mortal admirers slaughter each other upon earth.” In a passage notable for its reference to the Jews, the little god suggests that an exception to the strife of the big gods and their followers is the Jewish god, who is not given to fighting despite the attacks from hostile Christians, though neither is he capable of the very small god’s good humor. The little god in green tells Metabel:\n\nThe god of the Jews has had his nose pulled many times. But he is tough; almost as tough as I am. I respect him for his obstinacy. I would like to be friends with him, but he will not have it. “There is no good humor,” he assures me proudly, among the Jews.” And he covers up his beard with his hands, to keep an enraged archbishop from pulling it out.\n\nWe learn that the little god is responsible for bringing Metabel to Hemlock, out of his concern for Joseph. Joseph, as his uncle Henry complains, is content with his modest existence, and will not even cut down the ash trees that grow on Hemlock and are particularly sought after by the mill in the nearby town of Wayne. The small god likes it this way, as it preserves the woodland and the homes of its small animals. But the wealthy Prissy Deakan, daughter of the owner of Wayne’s bank, has her eye on Joseph, and wants to marry him and make him over into a go-getter, respectably ambitious. The little god tells Metabel that Prissy wants Joseph “for what he will be when she gets through with him. But you and I love him as he is.”\n\nWith dreams of a road running through Hemlock and money to be made at the mill, Prissy goads Joseph into cutting down an ash tree, the breaking of an almost magical taboo and the first step in his corruption—and Hemlock’s. But the small god arranges it so that the tree falls on Metabel, helping her win Joseph’s love. They share a virginal kiss and are to be married. Metabel feels like a small David who has overcome the Goliath of Prissy Deakon and her wealth and status.\n\nBut there is no happy ending here. Joseph soon wants to provide Metabel with material things, beginning with a wedding dress. He starts cutting down more ash trees. The big, bullying gods of industry and development take over. The home of the little god is being laid waste. He foresees that, despite their love for each other, Joseph will eventually come to hate himself for his new ambitions, and Metabel will come to hate herself for being their cause. Tragically, the little god decides to exile Metabel back to Barly so as to preserve his little haven of ash trees, as well as the memory of the couple’s sweet love before it withers.\n\nAt the book’s end, Metabel is back in Barly, in sight of Hemlock but with no road that can take bring her to Joseph. She learns to live with her loss, helped by the occasional visits of the little god, knowing that Joseph is once again living the life he is meant to, even if apart from her. “And in her heart nodded and whispered the green untroubled woods of Joseph’s home,” writes Nathan, “where the sun shone when Barly was in shadow.”\n\nA film treatment of the novel was apparently sold to Walt Disney in 1946."
