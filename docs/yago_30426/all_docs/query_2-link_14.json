        "text": "Robert Nathan is one of those names now known only, it seems, to people who’ve enjoyed the films based on his work. Portrait of Jennie and The Bishop’s Wife are both, apparently, regarded as classics in the movie world – but less known is their author, who was extremely prolific. I love his novels, which take only a couple of hours to read but transport the reader away for a while. When I read about Stonecliff (1967), I knew I had to get hold of a copy.\n\nStonecliff is the house of Edward Granville, noted writer. He is a recluse, and Stonecliff is isolated on a cliff in California, but he accepts a visit from Michael Robb – the narrator. He has been commissioned to write the great man’s biography, and is allowed to stay.\n\nI have been sitting here at my desk with the last page of my book in front of me – my book, still untitled, the biography of the novelist Edward Granville. It is all done, complete, with names and dates and places, facts gathered from many sources, including Stonecliff itself. And yet in a real sense it is not done at all, for I know that the life of the book itself has escaped me; the mystery that baffled me then eludes me still.\n\nThat’s the opening of the novel, and consider me hooked. The greatest mystery is Granville’s wife – absent from the house – and the young woman who is there and whom Robb finally meets; she is beautiful, captivating, and elusive. He gradually begins to suspect that she is the creation of Granville – has he called her to life with his pen? And what exactly is their relationship? How should the biographer interpret what he sees, and can he get to the bottom of the mystery?\n\nI rushed through the book gleefully. Nathan is not a great prose stylist, but there is also nothing obstructive in his writing – and he is an expert at conveying atmosphere. So I wouldn’t want to quote many of the lines out loud, but he builds wonder and romance (in the traditional sense of the word) so adeptly that I loved my short stay in Stonecliff. It’s the fourth novel I’ve read by him, and I’ll certainly seek out more. They so perfectly suit certain moods. And if you happen to be in America, you can snap them up very easily."
