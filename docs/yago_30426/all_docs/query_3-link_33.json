        "text": "The Orchid is not one of Robert Nathan’s fantastical novels, though it is another of his ironic moral entertainments. Set in Nathan’s fairytale-like New York City, its two main themes have been seen in several of his earlier novels: marriage and art. Rather than presenting these as binary opposites in a simple choice between commitment to one’s spouse and commitment to one’s craft, Nathan presents a few different parallel struggles with fidelity—marital and artistic—along with other notes and preoccupations that make the book more slippery than it first appears.\n\nAt the center of the novel is the beautiful actress and single mother Rose Grogarty. She is having an affair with the married Julian Heavenstreet, a wealthy steel magnate. He would like to leave his wife Alma, a dizzy society matron who wishes her husband would notice her existence. Julian will provide generously for Rose if she marries him, but he also insists that she give up her stage career.\n\nIf these are the nobles of this Shakespearean comedy, the rudes (who in another book by Nathan might be talking animals) are the failed Italian tenor Mr. Gambrino, who holds on to his identity as an opera singer even though his livelihood is the operation of a carousel in the park, and Rose’s hairdresser, the single Mrs. Connor, who gives her beloved Gambrino her life savings so that he can give up the merry-go-round business and return to music.\n\nTo Mrs. Connor’s dismay, Gambrino uses her money instead to purchase a new carousel, ditching the traditional animals for airplanes and cars in an embrace of the modern—though he keeps one giraffe among the bunch for sentimental reasons. Gambrino understands that he is not really committed to singing, while his business is the thing that actually brings pleasure to an audience and will allow him to support Mrs. Connor. The high note he sings at the end, unheard beneath the noise of the merry-go-round, and slightly lowered in pitch to conform to his vocal limitations, is his authentic note, and he is pleased with it.\n\nThe grand opening of his new carousel, a carnivalesque and alcohol-warmed (with hidden flasks because of Prohibition) gathering of all the novel’s characters, becomes the final scene for Rose as well. She makes her decision to reject Julian, despite the material security he can provide, and she instead embraces the sweet spectacle of all her friends riding the carousel, with the city around them, and life and its transient beauty enwrapping the whole. Julian returns to a forgiving Alma in a picture of marriage as fragile yet worthwhile, requiring compassion and responsibility.\n\nThis summary suggests the more simplistic, even naïve outlines of the book. But it leaves out a number of odd moments and loose ends that, while not entirely dispelling the sense of soap-bubble lightness, leave one wondering precisely what Nathan is up to.\n\nThere is, for instance, a thread of cynical and discontented commentary on the literary trends of Nathan’s day. He throws in an author visiting from Australia, ignored at her own publisher’s party by the dissipated New York literary establishment getting drunk and cheating on their spouses.\n\nTwo attendees at the party are the “the great Irish critic” Stang and the Jewish poet Stoffel. Stang opines that Anatole France “is finished. He is dead.” This is evidently an unfair judgement Nathan feels has been passed on his own wry and yearning aesthetic, influenced by France.\n\nStoffel, meanwhile, responding to Stang’s claim that hard, modern realism is the future of literature and it is found most of all in Ireland, scoffs: “If you never were a Jew on the east side of New York, you don’t know realism at all.” Stoffel’s commentary, which perhaps reflects Nathan’s perspective on the emergent American Jewish literature of immigrant and working-class New York, as well as what will emerge in a few years as his engagement with Zionism, is heard once again in the novel. “You had to be a Jew, to know about life,” he tells the visiting novelist. “I believe in life.” She responds: “Do you. . .believe in the Jews?” “No,” said Mr. Stoffel.\n\nMatilda Arbuthnot, the visiting novelist, meanwhile finds that none of the Americans who fête her have read her books. Nevertheless, Alma hopes for marital advice from the visiting author: “You are so wise because you have written books,” she says. “Books like Mary of the Lane, which sounds so peaceful.” (Arbuthnot’s tragic books are far from peaceful—does this reflect Nathan’s feeling that his own books have been misconstrued?)\n\nArbuthnot’s response to this request for relationship advice takes an odd turn. “I am, thank God, still a virgin,” says the writer. “The very thought of being fondled, in an intimate way, by a man, repels me.” The awkward conversation continues:\n\n“The body,” she declared, “has never attracted me, in a sexual sense. That is to say, the male body . . . I confess, the female contours often draw me irresistably. But so far nothing has come of it—nothing serious that is.”\n\nAnd she gave Mrs. Heavenstreet a thoughtful look.\n\n“Do have a muffin,” said Mrs. Heavenstreet.\n\nMiss Arbuthnot went on, with her mouth full of muffin: “As a child, my father fondled me rather a bit. A great, moist, hairy man, my father; I took quite an aversion to it. . . .”\n\nAnother moment at which the seemingly ethereal atmosphere of the novel is punctured is when Mrs. Connor, distraught because Gambrino is spending her money on a new carousel, turns tearfully to a friend. The friend at first assumes she is pregnant and needs an abortion.\n\nAnd then there are the loose ends. The book opens with two familiar types in Nathan’s books: a kindly old professor and a child (Rose’s). Yet we never see the child again after the first chapter, and the old professor, while he can be credited with bringing about the culminating carousel episode, is otherwise peripheral to the novel.\n\nNathan’s fictions so far are curious, intriguing, if sometimes frustrating. They are not at all oblivious to sorrow and suffering, but they are driven by irony rather than tragedy. This irony is a constant; his characters do not generally change. Indeed, they have little psychological interiority. Instead, they have considerable moral interiority, and rather than changing, they tend to enact a sudden departure from the type they seem to be, in a moment of uncharacteristic decision: for loyalty, courage, or compassion. The consequences of these moments are not dramatic, but quietly tremulous. Though The Orchid reminds us of Nathan’s debt to Anatole France, we are perhaps more reminded of films of the time, both the recently abandoned silents and the new talkies, with types and quirky humor and little poignant decisions observed by audiences in the dark.\n\nAs Nathan’s next novel, One More Spring, will be his first breakout success, we may want here to consider the literary landscape in which he was writing, by listing some representative titles by his contemporaries. These should remind us that, among other things, the later selection and imposition of a more modernist canon does not reflect the different kinds of novels read by Americans at the turn of the 1930s, or the many authors considered major figures at the time and who are today relegated to historical significance.\n\nAmong the subsequently canonized writers, Hemingway published A Farewell to Arms in 1929, while Fitzgerald’s Tender Is the Night appeared in 1934. Nathaniel West’s Miss Lonelyhearts appeared in 1933. William Faulkner’s As I Lay Dying was published in 1930, Sanctuary in 1931. Dos Passos’s The 42nd Parallel and Nineteen Nineteen appeared in 1930 and 1932, respectively. Ethnic literature landmarks Jews Without Money, by Mike Gold, and Black No More, by George Schuyler, appeared in 1930 and 1931, respectively.\n\nBut that list of titles would not have been recognized at the time as anything like an accurate gauge of the best of American fiction, let alone an index of reader taste. In 1930, the first American author to win the Nobel prize for literature was Sinclair Lewis, whose Dodsworth appeared in 1929. The Pulitzer in 1931 went to Margaret Ayer Barnes’s Years of Grace; the following year to Pearl Buck’s The Good Earth. Fanny Hurst published Back Street in 1931 and Imitation of Life in 1933. Cimarron by Edna Ferber appeared in 1930. One of the major titles of the decade was Hervey Allen’s Anthony Adverse (1933), and the early 1930s also saw such hardboiled or grotesque novels as Dashiell Hammett’s The Maltese Falcon (1930) and Erskine Caldwell’s Tobacco Road (1932).\n\nThe first list of nine titles is more familiar to English department syllabi, and three of the books were made into films during the 1930s: A Farewell to Arms (1932); Miss Lonelyhearts (1933); and Sanctuary (1933). Yet all of the books in the second list had been made into Hollywood films by 1941, with the sole exception of Barnes’s Years of Grace—and her novel from the year after her Pulitzer, Westward Passage, was made into a film in 1932. Nathan in many ways belongs with the second group of writers and, in this sense, he was at the time far more popular and mainstream than many more familiar names today—or, rather, would become so with the publication of One More Spring in 1933 (adapted for film in 1935).\n\nA Cedar Box (1929)\n\nNathan’s second collection of poems is a modest affair in all ways, including length (48 pages, including the foreword by Louis Untermeyer). The title poem is the standout, a clever conceit in which a chess game is observed to end, always, with a coffin-like “closed and quiet cedar box”—like life. Otherwise there are some Dickinsonian notes, but with misty edges, not sharp ones.\n\nThe most interesting thing about the book may be the dedication: to Nathan’s storied aunt Annie Nathan Meyer and her husband. The Orchid is meanwhile dedicated to Nathan’s maternal grandmother, described as “the gayest, truest, quickest, and most lovable of all my friends.”"
