        "text": "Robert Lindsay Nathan, Jr .(September 24, 1952-February 14, 2023)\n\nRobert Lindsay Nathan, Jr. of Canyon Lake, TX passed away after a short battle with cancer on February\n\n14, 2023. “Bama”, “Lindsay”, “Robert” or “Bob” was born in New Orleans, LA on September 24, 1952 to\n\nRobert Lindsay Nathan and Rhea Fonde Nathan who both predeceased him. Lindsay is survived by his\n\nbrother Lawrence Bruce Nathan (nephews Lawrence Tyler Nathan and Robert Parker Nathan); his sister\n\nJudy Nathan Cisco and her husband William James Cisco Sr. (nephew Nathan Thomas Cisco); and his\n\nbrother John Harrington Nathan (wife Donna Bowling Nathan, predeceased) (nieces Rhea Fonde Nathan,\n\nSarah Winston Nathan and nephew John Harrington Nathan, Jr.)\n\nRobert spent most of his childhood in Sheffield, AL before moving to Texas during high school. He\n\ngraduated from Memorial High School in Houston in 1968 and went to Texas A & M where he obtained\n\nhis Bachelors Degree in Environmental Design (1972) and his Masters in Architecture (1974). He then\n\ntraveled the world working in construction management where he developed a stellar reputation for\n\nperfection and reliability with his peers in the industry. He retired in 2017 and moved back to a favorite\n\nspot, the Phish Kamp at Canyon Lake, TX . He also spent these retirement years designing and building a\n\nhome and art/music studio in Trinidad, CO.\n\nBama was loved by so many for his peaceful loving nature, his kindness and sincerity, his quick and\n\ngentle wit, his extreme intellect and truthfulness, and his love of music and the arts. He was a gifted\n\nsinger and songwriter and traveled the world playing his music. He produced four albums and will have a\n\nfifth produced and completed posthumously. He generously gave his money and time to other\n\nmusicians to pursue their dreams, and he made the Phish Kamp, his home/cabin/campsite a revolving\n\ndoor for friends and strangers to drop by to pick a few songs and enjoy the camaraderie that some\n\nbelieve only musicians and artists can fully appreciate. He called the Phish Kamp the world’s “open\n\nsource art project.” He often spoke of the need for everyone in the world to contribute artistically in\n\ntheir best way for the benefit of mankind.\n\nLindsay was a lifelong member of the First Presbyterian Church of Sheffield, AL where he spent his\n\nchildhood. Throughout his life, he donated to the church and would visit it whenever he was back in\n\nAlabama. It was at church camp in his younger years when he developed his love for playing the guitar\n\nbecause the older guys that played “got the attention of the girls.”\n\nAfter cremation, Robert has requested that his ashes be scattered in two places—his property on his\n\nmini-mountain in Tarpley, TX and at his beloved childhood lake home on the Tennessee River in\n\nSheffield, AL. These services will be held at a later date for his family.\n\nHe has requested that in lieu of\n\nflowers, that any donation or gifts be made to the O’Neal Comprehensive Cancer Center at University of Alabama at Birmingham, 210 D WTI, 1720 Second Avenue South, Birmingham, AL 35294."
