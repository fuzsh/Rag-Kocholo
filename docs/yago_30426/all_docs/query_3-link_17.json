        "text": "“HE DID NOT WANT HIS WIFE TO ADORE A STRANGER”: FIRST EDITION OF NATHAN’S MUCH-LOVED NOVEL, THE BISHOP’S WIFE, 1928\n\nNATHAN, Robert. The Bishop’s Wife. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, (1928). Octavo, original yellow cloth, graphic endpapers, original dust jacket.\n\nFirst edition of Nathan’s whimsical tale, basis for the 1947 Oscar-winning film of the same name starring Cary Grant and Loretta Young, and the 1996 film, The Preacher’s Wife, starring Denzel Washington and Whitney Houston, scarce in original dust jacket.\n\nRobert Nathan’s The Bishop’s Wife was immediately praised on publication in 1928 as “idyllic”—the work of a writer much loved for “tender, subtle” works always infused with a gentle whimsy and light irony, including the equally popular Portrait of Jennie (1940). In The Bishop’s Wife, Nathan’s portrayal of the relation between Dr. Michael (an angel), the Bishop’s wife, and Juliet, the young daughter, is especially “tender, his most beautiful writing” (New York Times). The novel was adapted to the screen in the 1947 Oscar-winning film of the same name, starring Cary Grant and Loretta Young, and again in 1996 as The Preacher’s Wife, starring Denzel Washington and Whitney Houston. “First Edition” stated on copyright page.\n\nBook fine, scarce dust jacket bright and lovely with vertical crease to spine panel, a bit of rubbing. A beautiful copy."
