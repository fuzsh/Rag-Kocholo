        "text": "This is the season of summer's ending . . There's a golden haze in the air . . The leaves take on jeweled colors . . There's the fragrance of drying grasses and the fugitive aroma of apples, hickory nuts and muscadines.\n\nIt is a time of sweet sadness, as of a giant bell tolling far away, or the distant, wind-blown whistle of a train in the night.\n\nJ.C. 10-21-10\n\nIt was Memorial Day, 1985, and the eastern sky was rosy with dawn. A wandering breeze stirred the rippling folds of the flag just outside the front door as I ventured out to pick up the paper, and I recalled standing on the green turf of the American cemetery on the coast of Normandy, moved by the beauty of the great flag that hung there at half-staff, grieving for the thousands whose graves are marked by the white marble crosses and the Stars of David. I remembered, too, the way the sunlight reflected off the blue-green waters of the sea, far below the steep cliffs, and the gulls soaring in the gusty wind, wings white against the sky.\n\nAs I reentered the house and opened the paper, I was suddenly jolted in a different direction: \"Robert Nathan dies,\" read the headline . . Death, the proud brother of sleep, had taken one of my heroes.\n\nMore than a half century ago, Mr. Books (Gilbert Govan) who tended the bookstore at Payne's, brought Nathan's writings into my life. It was love at first reading. In my early 20's then, I was deeply moved by a sonnet Gilbert quoted to me:\n\n\"I ride the great black horses of my heart\n\nwith reins of steel across their flying hair;\n\nso slow are they to halt, so swift to start,\n\nthe stormy-breasted stallions of despair. ..\"\n\nThe first of Nathan's brief and poignant novels I read was Jonah, a tale about the Old Testament prophet. It contains the following passage:\n\n\"As evening fell, he found himself beside a little pool in the desert; here he sat down to rest. The sky was green with early night; the evening star, smaller than the moon and silver as a distant sea, sailed above Sharon. Before him lay the desert, heavy with silence, drenched with the cold dew of evening; Jonah shivered and drew his cloak about him.\n\n\"As he sat there, his head bowed upon his hands, a fox came out of a hole, and seeing Jonah, exclaimed: ‘There is the man of God.'\"\n\nA spell was cast over me that has lasted ever since.\n\nAmong his many books are Portrait of Jennie, One More Spring, Winter in April, The Bishop's Wife and The River Journey — all quiet but powerfully moving masterpieces in miniature.\n\nYet, memorable as are his novels, his poems are even more so. Today not many know them, I suppose. Unfortunately, this may be one of those temporary Dark Ages that afflict affluent societies, when real poetry and music almost perish.\n\nEven today, though, most would surely appreciate the haunting beauty of such lines as:\n\n\"Tread softly, sorrow, for the summer passes,\n\nHer leaves are falling in continual rain;\n\nLet me be silent as the withered grasses,\n\nLet me be quiet as the gathered grain...\"\n\nor the equally nostalgic\n\n\"Now blue October, smoky is the sun,\n\nMust end the long, sweet summer of the heart.\n\nThe last brief visit of the birds is done;\n\nThey sing the autumn songs before they part...\"\n\nLike Edna St. Vincent Millay, Nathan understood that real poetry is the child of music and painting. His own always combine pleasant and musical sounds with lovely color and flowing, graceful line. And there is profound wisdom in:\n\n\"Ask not for freedom if you fear to weep,\n\nOr dream of peace if terror makes you start.\"\n\nBorn in New York City in 1894, Robert Nathan was educated at Phillips Academy at Exeter, then at Harvard, where he was an editor of The Harvard Monthly, in which his first stories and poems appeared. Later, while working in an advertising agency in 1919, he published his first novel, Peter Kindred, which was followed by scores of others and by his poems. He quickly acquired a reputation as a master of satiric fantasy unique in American literature. An accomplished musical amateur, he was a skillful fencer, and was fond of swimming and tennis.\n\nIn mid-life he moved to the West Coast where he lived with his English-born wife, Anna, to whom he dedicated his last book of poems, Evening Song.\n\nBecause he and Mrs. Books (Christine Noble Govan) were such good friends, I always felt that somehow he was my friend, too. How fitting and proper that both should enter Valhalla this year.\n\nWe corresponded for years . . and, shortly before his death, he wrote me, \"You are the only one who still reads me.\"\n\nJack Smith, of the Los Angeles Times, relates that he had once written about the melancholy of Sunday afternoon and that Nathan had responded:\n\n\"Even children feel a vague sadness late of a Sunday afternoon, in that hour when the light has turned gray and cold and before the yellow lights are lit in the blue evening air. It is because Sunday is a special day, unlike any other ... \"On Sunday, anything can happen, something marvelous ... One waits for it all week; and then, as the day passes, and the light begins to fall, one realizes that nothing marvelous has happened at all.\n\n\"Old people feel like that, too. They look ahead to Sunday only to realize, when it comes, that nothing marvelous has happened, or ever will; they are simply one week older. But there is this difference: by the time the lamps are lit, old people are already looking ahead to Monday when the world picks up again. Perhaps ... on Monday something marvelous ...\"\n\nBut most precious of all to me is his sonnet that tells so briefly, but truly, what lies in the heart of each of us:\n\n\"The heart in wonder, like a lonely wren,\n\nWill sing a while and then be still as long.\n\nHe waits an answer ere he sings again,\n\nWho sings for love, and not alone for song.\n\nThe bird's shy pipe will falter in the end,\n\nThe heart's voice sicken if it be not heard;\n\nThey seek the absent, the beloved friend —\n\nSong is for lovers, whether heart or bird.\n\nSo, if you hear me, tell me that you hear,\n\nLest I grow weary and forget to sing;\n\nAs in this sweet green season of the year\n\nThe bird that hears no answer lifts his wing\n\nAnd far away, dejected and remote,\n\nTried other woodlands with his lonely note.\"\n\nCan you imagine leaving a better memorial?"
