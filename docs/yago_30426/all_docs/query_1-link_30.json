        "text": "The collection includes drafts of writings, correspondence, photographs, scrapbooks, clippings, drawings, diaries, and audio recordings documenting the life and work of the American writer Robert Nathan. Drafts of Nathan's writings make up the bulk of the collection, and include novels, screenplays, short fiction and prose, speeches, and poetry; the writings include story ideas, or \"false starts,\" that Nathan did not publish. Correspondence and other papers document his family relationships, in particular that with his sister Marian Kraus Sandor. Other major correspondents include Stephen Vincent Bene?t, Herbert Feis, Lawrence Kubie, Dan H. Laurence, and Marjorie Bitker. The collection also documents an exhibition of Nathan's work in the Yale University Library in 1962.\n\nOrganized into 4 groupings: Acquisitions 1964-circa 1970, Acquisitions circa 1970-1982, November 1982 Acquisition, and Other Acquisitions.\n\nMaterial within this collection has been organized roughly by acquisition reflecting the fact that the collection has been acquired in increments over time, and reflecting previous arrangement and description by the library. Researchers should note that material within each acquisition or group of acquisitions overlaps with/or relates to material found in other groups. For instance, correspondence and writings can be found in all groupings. In order to locate all relevant material within this collection, researchers will need to consult each acquisition described in the Collection Contents section. Researchers should also note that similar material can be arranged differently in each acquisition, depending on how the material was organized when it was received by the library."
