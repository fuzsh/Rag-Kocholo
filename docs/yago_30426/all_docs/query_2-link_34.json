        "text": "It is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of Nathan \"Nat\" Robert Turner, Sr., a beloved husband, father, grandfather, brother, and friend. He left us on August 19, 2023 at age 82. Born at home on September 1, 1940, in Wirtz, Virginia, to Kent Turner and Angie Brown Turner, Nat lived a life filled with dedication, love, and purpose.\n\nNat was a proud graduate of the University of Virginia (Phi Beta Kappa) and Penn State, where he earned his Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Electrical Engineering, respectively. His distinguished 61-year career from farmer to Engineer began at General Electric in 1962, which became Lockheed Martin, and where he remained throughout his tenure. With unwavering focus and intelligence, he contributed significantly to vital U.S. space systems and was recognized throughout his life with numerous industry accolades.\n\nBeyond his professional achievements, Nat enjoyed repairing wayward vehicles, building projects, people watching, and mowing everywhere. Above all, his greatest passion was caring for his family, whom he loved deeply. He was a dutiful, focused, and quiet man, doing anything necessary to ensure their success and security.\n\nNat was the cherished husband of Jessie Anne Stahl, a marriage that spanned over 46 years. Their love was strong and reflected through the five children (and many pets) they raised together.\n\nNat was preceded in death by his siblings, Elonza Turner, Joel Turner, and Iris Turner, as well as his nephew, Ashley Turner. He is survived by his wife, Jessie; his siblings, Jimmy Turner (Betty Jo) and Robin Cooper (Bill); his sister-in-law, Pat Turner; his children, Robert Turner (the late Bill), Kimberly Morris (James), Andrew Turner (Corrie), Daniel Turner (Jen), and Natalie Sohn (Will); his grandchildren, Jake, Samantha, Alex, Sayge, Curran, Emily, James, and Oliver; and many beloved nieces, nephews, and friends who will miss him dearly.\n\nA private service will be held to honor Nat's life. In lieu of flowers, the family kindly requests donations be made to the W. E. Skelton 4-H Center, which has been a long connection to the Turner family and community, or to a charity of your choice."
