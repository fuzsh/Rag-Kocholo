        "text": "INSPIRED STORIES FOR GIVING\n\n“This is the message I wanted to get across to students. That you can do anything, you can accomplish things, and it doesn’t matter where you start. If you reach that deeply inside of yourself, you can do great things.“ — Robert Danziger\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobert (Bob) Danziger wanted to provoke some thinking when he asked that the three-tier amphitheater at the heart of the new College of Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences building be named the RND Amphitheater. Sure, those are his initials (Robert Nathan Danziger), and when you say it out loud, it sounds like the area he spent most of his career in: research and development. But visit rndamphitheater.com and you’ll see that simple answer quickly funnels you into a series of stories one could spend hours exploring — which was the legacy donor’s true hope and intent.\n\n“I want students to be inspired by the stories that inspired me,” he said. And so while Danziger may have developed catalyst chemistry for ultra-low emissions from gas-fired power plants and worked on the international space station, it’s the stories behind that work that make it meaningful.\n\nThe website collects information about the lives and accomplishments of Danziger and his wife, Martha Drexler Lynn, Ph.D., but also presents the stories that inspired their passions.\n\nIn addition to being an alternative energy pioneer, Danziger is an author, a musician, a filmmaker, a composer and an inventor. He holds 10 patents and has given away 65 million milkweed and wildflower seeds to support pollinators. In 2011, the university awarded him an honorary doctor of fine arts degree for his work in music, invention and pioneering sustainable energy, and in 2013 he addressed the graduating class as their commencement speaker (you can also watch that speech on the website.)\n\n“Stories are the sort of thing to inspire a student,” said Danziger. “Stories give people insight into what makes them, them.”\n\nOne of the stories Danziger finds most inspiring is that of the Voyager spacecraft — a project he personally had nothing to do with, but saw come together during his time working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\n“I think this is the greatest achievement of humankind to date” Danziger writes on the website. Voyager is interesting not only because of the science and engineering genius it took to launch an object from Earth into interstellar space, but also because it contains a record of music and art as examples of the best of who we are, in the hopes we’ll one day be able to communicate with civilizations from other planets. The first piece of music that appears on that record is Bach’s Brandenburg Concerto, and the story behind that piece of music has also been one of Danziger’s inspirations.\n\nBach was orphaned at age 10. By adulthood, he had carved out a successful career as a musician and composer, was married and had seven children (six surviving). While he was away from his family, working with his employer Prince Leopold, his wife fell ill and died. This news was kept from him so that he would continue his work. When Bach returned home and discovered what had happened, he was devastated and furious. With the support of his band, he made it through this period of despair, eventually meeting and falling in love with the soprano, Anna Magdalena Wilcke. They married, had 13 children, and were musical collaborators for the rest of his life.\n\n“This is, arguably, the greatest story in history,” Danziger said. “It spans the arc of contentment, to despair, to the highs of new love, and what it means to live.”\n\nMusic is a lifelong passion of Danziger’s. He learned to play bass at age 18, while laying in bed for months recovering from a serious back injury after falling off a ladder. Because of his limited mobility, he developed an unusual technique. The next year, while goofing around on his bass at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, he caught the eye and ear of legendary jazz musician Cecil Taylor, and was recruited into Taylor’s experimental band.\n\nAfter leaving college, completing his equivalency exam and attending law school, Danziger continued to pursue his passion for music — composing soundscapes and producing award-winning film scores even as he launched and ran his own alternative energy company. One of his projects was writing a jazz-classical crossover version of the Brandenburg Concertos.\n\nDanziger and Lynn have also shared this love of music with the university’s faculty, staff and students by supporting an annual partnership between the campus and the Monterey Jazz Festival with gifts during their lifetime and with a legacy gift. This partnership brings renowned jazz performers to the campus to create provocative musical collaborations that blur the lines between musical genres.\n\nIn another example of the couple’s generosity toward the university, Martha Drexler Lynn made a planned gift to create the Martha Drexler Lynn Fellowship for faculty scholarship.\n\n“I wanted faculty to have a chance to keep up with their field and bring high quality knowledge back to students,” she said. Her fellowship is limited to liberal arts faculty, because there is more funding generally available to faculty in the sciences. “But the liberal arts — they enrich one’s life.”\n\nThe Lynn Fellowship will enable faculty to take a year away from teaching in pursuit of a special project or research interest, and share what they learn with students when they return. “I hope to fund it before I die, because it will be great fun to see the projects burbling among the faculty,” she said.\n\nJust around the corner from the RND Ampitheater, the dean’s suite in the new CAHSS building is dedicated to Lynn in thanks for this gift.\n\nLynn is an academic herself, focused on the decorative arts — functional artwork made from glass, metal, ceramics, wood, and textiles. It’s a field that gets less attention than painting and sculpture, but one perhaps more relevant to our day to day lives. “You are probably sitting on a chair or sofa. Anytime you wander into IKEA to buy a side table, consider what has gone into it. Design, manufacturing, sociological expression, function. There’s a long international history and a lot of theoretical thought to assess and appreciate decorative arts, and it’s pretty cool,” she said.\n\nLynn has written several books on ceramics and spent much of her career as a curator for the Los Angeles County Museum of Arts. She shared that curatorial skillset with the university as a member of the University Art Committee and adjunct faculty member, where she taught a course on regional art that satisfied students’ upper level writing requirement.\n\n“Teaching that class made me aware of the things [students] are overcoming in getting an education. So many are bilingual and the first in their family to go to college. It really makes you take your hat off,” she said.\n\n“CSUMB professors will do anything they can to help that student,” said Danziger. “You can get a great education at CSUMB. The professors are there to give you one if you want it.”"
