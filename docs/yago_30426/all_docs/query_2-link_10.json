        "text": "The 1947 film adaptation of Robert Nathan’s The Bishop’s Wife does not have the popular cache of Christmas favorites It’s a Wonderful Life (1946) or Miracle on 34th Street (1947). The wonder is, rather, that it is as successful a Christmas film as it is, given the source material. As we have seen, Nathan’s novel is a critical meditation on American society and human nature that ends in a somber vision of loneliness and longing. With a sexually repressed clergyman and an angel who nearly breaks up his marriage, it took a lot of changes to Nathan’s material to make the film appropriate as a Hollywood seasonal favorite.\n\nIn fact, the American Film Institute website informs us that the production was beset with problems. Casting was uncertain, with many late replacements and, apparently, a switch of roles between Cary Grant and David Niven in the angel and bishop roles. Producer Samuel Goldwyn fired the director, and stopped production for a month at considerable cost in order to reorganize the cast and writing. There are reports that Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett were brought in to make changes to the Leonardo Bercovici and Robert Sherwood script.\n\nYet, when all was done, the movie received five Academy Award nominations, including for Best Picture, and won for Sound Recording. Cary Grant and Loretta Young are particularly good in the role of the angel and the bishop’s wife. If their turn has never been as iconic as that of Jimmy Stewart in Capra’s Christmas favorite, it still gets December replays.\n\nThe Jewish content of the novel and its painful reflections on antisemitism are, perhaps unsurprisingly, excised entirely, along with the character of Mr. Cohen. I say “perhaps” because this was the time in which some of the first explicit and major Hollywood explorations of antisemitism were making waves. The premiere of Gentleman’s Agreement took place a month before the premiere of The Bishop’s Wife.\n\nBut then Nathan’s novel does not offer a redemptive message about American goodness, in regard to either antisemitism or erotic longing, and so those parts get cut or reimagined. The film script gives us a cathedral that is to be a monument to the vanity and controlling whims of the wealthy Mrs. Hamilton. Cary Grant’s angel, who goes by the name Dudley rather than Michael, discerns that Mrs. Hamilton was once in love with a poor musician and that her current “edifice complex” is an attempt to repress that painful longing. Once she is able to acknowledge that she married her husband for his wealth and that her true love was always the musician, she decides to give her money, not for the construction of the new cathedral, but for relief of the poor and needy.\n\nDavid Niven’s bishop is a pallid, petulant presence in the movie, but we are given to understand that he has lost his bearings as pastor, husband, and father, and needs to rediscover his priorities and humanity. He is not at first happy when Mrs. Hamilton redirects her funds to the poor, even though she appoints him director of those funds, but we subsequently see him walking through the snow to his old church in the poor neighborhood. This lets us know that he is reconnecting with his social values.\n\nAnd when he realizes that his wife is likely to run off with Dudley, he is determined to fight for her, even against an angel. (Even against Cary Grant!) This signals the other necessary change of heart, letting us know that he is reconnecting with his masculinity, his passion, and his familial life. The bishop’s wife has already spurned the angel’s advances—those advances being an unsettling plot element from the novel that is toned down but preserved in the film—but it is the bishop’s willingness to wrestle an angel that lets Dudley know that all will be well in this family, and that he ought to go before he falls for any more mortal women. “Kiss her for me, you lucky Henry,” Grant tells the bishop.\n\nThe movie ends with the bishop’s Christmas sermon in the old church, a sermon that has been rewritten by the angel. It is a slippery text, that begins by criticizing an American materialism that focuses on Christmas gifts while forgetting the “one empty stocking” of the child Jesus. We might be heading toward the stunning message of Linus in “A Charlie Brown Christmas,” turning toward the religious event of Christmas over the commercialized holiday. But that is not where this sermon goes. “Let us ask ourselves what he would wish for most,” the bishop tells the congregation. The answer: “Lovingkindness, warm hearts, and a stretched out hand of tolerance.” The ecumenical, social values of postwar American liberalism are the answer here to what Jesus wants.\n\nThe Preacher’s Wife, Penny Marshall’s 1996 gospel remake of The Bishop’s Wife, has Denzel Washington as the angel and Whitney Houston as the wife of the title. The filmmakers may have believed that two such stars could overcome the defects of the script. Washington is at his most winsome, filling Cary Grant’s shoes and then some, and Houston is at her loveliest. But screenwriters Nat Mauldin (mainly known for work on television shows such as Barney Miller) and Allan Scott (a Scot who had already collaborated on decidedly non-family friendly movies by Nicolas Roeg, Dario Argento, and Danny Boyle), while creating some enjoyable scenes, tend to fracture the narrative arc and introduce distractions. The rambling result is at times more interesting than the 1947 version, but much less satisfying.\n\nVoice-overs by the preacher’s son, a mush-mouthed, cutesy kid, are one big misstep. Another is the predictable and lazy treatment of this version’s Hamilton, a wealthy real estate developer (Gregory Hines) who grew up in the poor neighborhood and now wants to knock down the old church, put in a mall and tennis courts, and build a new hi-tech cathedral in a tonier neighborhood that will include day care facilities and a senior citizen center. Roots and community are important but, the dark side of gentrification aside, it isn’t entirely clear, why his plan is worse than sinking more money into his old dysfunctional, graffiti-marked hood. In any case, while Cary Grant uncovers his Hamilton’s inner sorrow, Washington just performs some angelic parlor tricks and then tells Hines: “Listen to your heart. Do what it tells you.”\n\nBut it is the relationship between Houston and her pastor husband (Courtney Vance, who, as good as he is an actor, has no hope of being noticed in scenes with Washington and Houston) that is the center of the movie, yet slips away in a now-we’re-up, now-we’re down looseness that undercuts the narrative build-up and release that would make it a better watch. Vance’s pastor is a good man, and a good husband, even if his community is short on money and intact families, and the movie entertains a few different reasons for why Houston is drifting away. Once Washington enters the picture and the heat turns up between him and Houston, few husbands, one suspects, would win out. Interestingly, while it undermines the sharpness of the movie’s narrative, Houston’s ambivalent and regretful rejection of her angel for her husband is the closer of the two films to the bittersweet yearning of Nathan’s novel.\n\nThere are some okay musical numbers—the soundtrack is the best-selling gospel album of all time, according to Wikipedia—and Vance delivers a killer sermon at the end, certainly better than David Niven’s in the 1947 movie. Amidst all the hallelujahs will anyone think to ask about the angel’s backstory? Early in the movie, and in contrast to the divinely created messengers of Nathan’s novel and first movie, Washington’s angel says that he was originally a human being, “cut down in my prime.” Later, he mentions that his mother once lost someone dear to her—meaning himself. Intriguing, but left unexplored."
