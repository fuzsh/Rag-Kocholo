        "text": "Robert “Bob” Nathan passed away early in the morning on May 28th 2020, just two days after celebrating his 91st birthday. Bob Nathan was a dear father, husband, grandfather and he is missed immeasurably. Bob grew up in Chicago’s Hyde Park and was married to the love of his life Roslyn “Roz” Nathan for nearly 66 years. They were set up by his father, a dentist, in 1954. Bob served as a military psychiatrist after being drafted post Korean War in, and went on to have a 35+ year career as a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst practicing in Pennsylvania, Colorado, New York and Virginia.\n\nThey raised three boys in suburban Philadelphia and for many years had a horse farm in Chester county PA. After their children were grown they moved to Colorado to the town they honeymooned in. They spent several years touring the country in an RV and settled in Upstate New York and finally Charlottesville VA, each time in service of their grandchildren. Bob is survived by his wife Roslyn “Roz”, his three sons Barnett “Bart” (Kathy), Richard “Rick” (Sherry Dubester) and Joshua “Josh” (Amy Engel) and his seven grandchildren Ariel, Kira Dubester, Layla, Sasha, Isaac, Aaron “Ari” and Asher. He is predeceased by his brother Ira Nathan.\n\nBob was a protective and kind grandfather, shepherding grandchildren from activity to activity and playing a role in their upbringing. He was also intensely brilliant, always willing to engage in a philosophical, medical or political discussion depending on the issues of the day. He was loved by his family and friends. He is missed."
