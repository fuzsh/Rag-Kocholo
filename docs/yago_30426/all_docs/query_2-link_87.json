        "text": "Obituary of Leslie Lewis Nathan\n\nLeslie Lewis Nathan of Edwards, Colorado (and part time of Palm Desert, CA) died peacefully in Denver at Rose Medical Center surrounded by her family on June 17th, 2024, at the age of 75 due to a previously unidentified kidney infection that escalated into septic shock.\n\nBorn in Houston, Texas in 1948, Leslie was the daughter of the late Harry and Helene (Rabinovitz) Lewis and was predeceased by her sister Barbara Lewis. She is survived by her beloved husband and best friend of 57 years, Dr. Robert Nathan, and cherished two sons, Brett (Jennifer) Nathan and Douglas (Tammy) Nathan, along with four grandchildren, Emma and Caroline Nathan, and Asher and Noa Nathan, as well as her sister Beverly Lewis Lerner of Houston, Texas, sister-in-law and brother-in-law Nancy and Bob Goldstein of Miami, Florida and step mother-in-law Toni Nathan of Aventura, Florida. She also had many nieces, nephews, great nieces and nephews, as well as being an incredible friend to all who knew her.\n\nLeslie earned her bachelor’s degree at Tulane (Newcomb) University in 1970 where she was a member of the Alpha Epsilon Phi sorority. Following graduation, she and Robert Nathan moved to Miami, Florida for Robert to pursue medicine and where she began a career in education. Their young family relocated to Colorado in 1977 where Robert continued his career in medicine specializing in Allergy and Immunology. Leslie flourished in Colorado Springs raising their two sons while being a travel agent and meeting planner for numerous pharmaceutical companies. They have been members of Temple Emanuel in Denver, Colorado, Temple Shalom in Colorado Springs, Colorado and B’nai Vail in Vail, Colorado. Her passions ranged from golf, pilates, yoga, travel, canasta, online New York Times word games and so much more. She was fortunate to visit over 130 countries with her husband, frequently with family and friends over the years with many more trips planned in the upcoming years. She served on a wide range of boards and had many philanthropic pursuits, receiving numerous honors for her community work.\n\nHer zest for life was contagious to anyone that met her and her sudden passing has left a void not only with her family, but with her friends. She will be dearly missed and forever remembered. May her memory be a blessing and continue to live on in all those who she has touched.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, tributes to her memory may be made to Sharsheret in support of the Jewish breast and ovarian cancer community, which has personal ties to her family, friends, and sorority at Tulane.
