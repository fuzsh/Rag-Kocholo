        "text": "Blonde and petite, she was labelled by studios \"The British Bombshell\" and starred in numerous films, including How Green Was My Valley (1941), Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? (1962) and The Sound of Music (1965).\n\nIn 1981 a car accident left her paralysed from the waist down, yet she never thought of retirement. For the last 25 years of her career she played the part of Lila Quartermaine in the soap opera General Hospital.\n\nBut last year Daily Variety reported that she had been unceremoniously dismissed, aged 90.\n\n\"They told me age had nothing to do with it,\" she recalled. \"I mean come on, this is youth-obsessed Hollywood, of course age is against me.\" Her advice to young actors was simply to \"learn your lines and be on time\".\n\nAnna Lee was born Joan Boniface Winnifrith on January 2 1913 at the village of Ightham, Kent, one of five children of the Rector of St Peter's Church, who also coached the children of Arthur Conan Doyle at his rectory.\n\nAs a child Joan was \"always showing off\", she recalled, and was encouraged to act by her parents. She chose as her role models Greta Garbo, Pola Negri and Colleen Moore.\n\nIn 1935, now using the name Anna Lee, she was signed to Gaumont British, and appeared in a series of Quota Pictures.\n\nIn 1933 she married the director Robert Stevenson, who gave her her first lead as Dr Clare Wyatt, opposite Boris Karloff in the horror The Man Who Changed his Mind (1936), followed by that of Kathy O'Brien in King Solomon's Mines (1937), with Paul Robeson.\n\nIn March the next year Anna Lee gave birth to the couple's first child, Venetia, and less than three months later the Stevensons left England for Hollywood. There she was put to work almost immediately, starring alongside Ronald Coleman in the Lewis Milestone comedy My Life with Caroline (1941). Next came How Green Was My Valley (1941), in which she played Bronwyn; \"The Beautiful English Rose\", predicted The New York Times, was in Hollywood to stay.\n\nUnder special orders from General Patton, she spent several months visiting field hospitals throughout the Mediterranean. In 1945 Patton made her an honorary private in the Sixth Army.\n\nAfter the war, she was married for a second time, to George Stafford, and resumed her career with a starring role in The Ghost and Mrs Muir (1947). She recruited her biggest fan base when she played Sister Margaretta, one of the singing nuns, in The Sound of Music (1965).\n\nThe 1960s also provided her with roles in the John Ford westerns Two Rode Together (1961), and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962). Around this time, she and her husband lived on a ranch in Montana, where she learned to rope and brand cattle.\n\nIn 1970 she married for the third time, to the author and poet Robert Nathan, 20 years her senior. In 1982 she was appointed MBE, after raising money to preserve the White Cliffs at Dover and Ightham Mote. (Her brother Sir John Winnifrith was director of the National Trust)."
