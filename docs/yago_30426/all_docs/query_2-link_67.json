After retiring in 1999, he became a wood-worker, happily creating gifts for family and friends.\n\nRobert and Carol were avid members of the Gold Wing Motorcycle Club, Reading chapter, and took many memorable trips around the United States. Robert was a huge Philadelphia sports fan.\n\nOne of Robert's fondest memories as a young boy was serving as a bat boy for the Reading Phillies for many years at the former Municipal Stadium.\n\nRobert is survived by two daughters, Cheryl A., wife of William R. Maull, Muhlenberg Township, and Lori A., wife of Scott M. Calpino, Bernville. One grandchild, Benjamin Nathan Maull, Palmyra, also survives him, as well as two nephews and one niece.\n\nHe was predeceased by one brother, Daniel Bauder, in 1986.\n\nRobert's family would like to extend a special thank you to the staff at Rittenhouse Village, Muhlenberg, for their kindness and friendship to Robert during his time there.\n\nFuneral services will be private at the convenience of the family.
