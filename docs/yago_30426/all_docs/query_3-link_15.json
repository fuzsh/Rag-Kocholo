        "text": "(1894–1985). U.S. novelist and poet Robert Nathan is best known for fantasies combining sentiment and satire. Several of his works, including The Bishop’s Wife (1928) and Portrait of Jennie (1940), were made into successful movies.\n\nRobert Nathan was born in New York City on Jan. 2, 1894, and educated at Phillips Exeter Academy, Harvard, and abroad. He began writing while still in school and became a full-time writer in 1925. Nathan wrote more than 40 novels, and though his outlook became darker and less optimistic over the course of his career, his works often dealt with the transcendent power of love and faith. Among his many novels are Peter Kindred (1919), Autumn (1921), The Puppet Master (1923), One More Spring (1933), Winter in April (1938), Mr. Whittle and the Morning Star (1947), The Devil with Love (1963), The Elixir (1971), and Heaven and Hell and the Megas Factor (1975). Nathan’s books of poetry include Youth Grows Old (1922), The Cedar Box (1929), The Darkening Meadows (1945), and The Green Leaf (1950). He died on May 25, 1985, in Los Angeles, Calif."
