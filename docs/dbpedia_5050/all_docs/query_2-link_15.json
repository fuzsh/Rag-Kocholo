Common causes for this include:\n\nThe text has been set to right, centered, left, or justified alignment. Use the alignment tools under the Paragraph section of the Home menu to set the alignment you want.\n\nA special indentation, such as a first line or hanging indentation, may have been selected. Check the indentation settings by highlighting your text, go to the Home menu and click on the Paragraph settings arrow, and then see if anything is selected under the \"Special\" menu.\n\nThe indentation settings have been changed. Select the ruler by going to the View page. Check to see if the pages are set where you want them.\n\nYou may have extra spaces in your document that is shifting the text. You can check to see if there are extra spaces by clicking the paragraph button under the paragraph settings on the Home menu (it looks like a backwards P). Dots in the center indicate spaces and paragraph symbols indicate new paragraphs. Extra spaces can be deleted by using the backspace or delete keys on the keyboard."
