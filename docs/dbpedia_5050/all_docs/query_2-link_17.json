A speed limit is the maximum speed considered safe for the area under ideal driving conditions.\n\nThe following speed limits are set in law for the specified areas, whether posted or not. They apply unless a different speed is posted or an established city ordinance specifies otherwise.\n\n15 Miles Per Hour\n\nWhen driving in alleys.\n\nNarrow residential areas.\n\n20 Miles Per Hour\n\nIn any business district.\n\nWithin a school speed zone.\n\n25 Miles Per Hour\n\nIn residential districts.\n\nIn public parks.\n\nOn ocean shores, if vehicles are permitted.\n\n55 Miles Per Hour\n\nOn all roads and highways not meeting any other definition unless otherwise posted.\n\nINTERSTATE SPEED LIMITS\n\nSpeed limits will vary on interstate highways.\n\nVariable Speed Signs\n\nDigital speed limit signs have replaced some standard speed signs in Oregon. The digital signs use road, weather, traffic and visibility sensors to lower the speed limit when conditions require drivers to slow down. The digital displays may also show the reason for a reduced speed. There are two types of digital variable speed signs:\n\nVariable speed signs, based on specific conditions, work to improve safety and reduce the chance of a collision by:\n\nThe Basic Rule Law\n\nThe basic rule states you must drive at a speed that is reasonable and cautious for existing conditions. The basic rule applies on all roads at all times.\n\nTo obey the basic rule, think about your speed in relation to other traffic, pedestrians, people riding bicycles, the surface and width of the road, hazards at intersections, weather, visibility, and any other conditions that affect safety. The basic rule does not allow you to drive over the speed limit.\n\nIf you drive at a speed that is unsafe for existing conditions in any area, at any time, even if it is slower than the speed limit, you are violating the basic rule.\n\nSlow Drivers\n\nIf you drive slower than the normal speed of traffic, you must use the right lane or drive as closely as possible to the right curb or edge of the road, unless you are preparing to make a left turn.\n\nWatch for congestion behind you if you drive slower than the designated speed. Pull off the road at the first safe area and let the traffic behind you pass.\n\nRacing\n\nIt is illegal to race on any road. Racing can be any acceleration or speed contest or the making of a speed record.\n\nVehicle Speed and Pedestrian Fatalities\n\nPavement Markings\n\nOregon’s pavement markings follow the national standards. You must obey all pavement markings unless you see a police officer or road worker redirecting traffic.\n\nYellow Markings\n\nAre used to separate traffic moving in opposite directions (center line) and to mark the left edge of one-way roads and ramps, two-way left turn lanes, and painted medians.\n\nSolid yellow line\n\nMarks the left edge of one-way roads and ramps.\n\nBroken yellow center line\n\nIndicates a two-way road used for traffic traveling in opposite directions. Passing is allowed for both directions of travel.\n\nDouble center line consisting of a solid yellow line and broken yellow line\n\nIndicates where passing is allowed. A broken yellow line on your side of the lane indicates you are allowed to pass. A solid yellow line on your side of the lane indicates you are not allowed to pass.\n\nDouble solid yellow line\n\nIndicates passing is not allowed for both directions of traffic. You may turn left, to enter or exit a roadway, across double solid yellow lines after waiting for oncoming traffic to clear.\n\nTwo-way special left turn lane\n\nIf a two-way left turn lane has been provided, do not make a left turn from any other lane. It is illegal to travel in a two-way left turn lane, so enter the lane just before you want to make the turn. Wait in the left turn lane until traffic clears and you can complete the turn.\n\nYou may turn from a side street or driveway into a two–way left turn lane. You must stop to wait for traffic to clear before moving into the lane to your right. Make sure the left turn lane is clear in both directions before entering the lane. It is illegal to use these lanes to speed up and merge with traffic or for passing cars to access a turn lane at an intersection.\n\nPainted median with double solid yellow lines on both sides\n\nMarks the area between two directions of travel. You may make a left turn across a painted median after waiting for oncoming traffic to clear. You may not use a painted median as a turn lane. It is illegal to travel in a median with double yellow lines.\n\nYellow diagonal stripes\n\nUsed within a painted median to inform you of fixed objects in the road ahead or areas where vehicle use is not allowed. It is illegal to drive in or make a turn across these stripes.\n\nWhite Markings\n\nAre used to separate lanes of traffic flowing in the same direction and mark the right edge of travel lanes. These are also used for crosswalks, stop lines, symbols, and words.\n\nSolid white line\n\nUsed for an edge or fog line to help drivers to stay on the road.\n\nWide solid white line\n\nUsed to direct traffic into specific lanes, such as turn lanes, and to separate bike lanes from other traffic lanes. Crossing a wide solid white line is permitted but discouraged.\n\nBroken white line\n\nSeparates lanes of traffic going in the same direction. Crossing a broken white line is permitted with caution.\n\nDotted white line\n\nShort dotted lines placed closer together than a broken line. Crossing a dotted line is permitted with caution.\n\nWhen used prior to an exit ramp or intersection, it informs you that the lane you are traveling in will not continue on the same route, such as a right-turn only lane or an exit only lane on the freeway.\n\nWhen used at a freeway entrance ramp, it informs you that you are entering the freeway and must merge into traffic.\n\nWhen used within an intersection, it will help guide you through the intersection into the proper lane.\n\nDouble solid white line\n\nMeans you are not allowed to change lanes and is usually accompanied by a sign prohibiting lane changes for a certain distance. Stay in your lane.\n\nMarked crosswalk\n\nNoted by white lines in an area where pedestrians cross the road. Stop when a pedestrian is in the crosswalk.\n\nStop line\n\nA solid white line across your lane to show the point at which you are required to stop.\n\nBike lane\n\nIdentified by a wide white line with a bicycle symbol or a bike lane sign. Bike lanes may be painted green.\n\nYield line\n\nA row of triangles in your lane, pointing toward your vehicle to indicate the point at which you are required to yield.\n\nWhite chevrons\n\nMay be used to inform you of fixed objects in the road ahead or other areas where vehicle use is not allowed.\n\nMaintaining a Space Cushion\n\nWhen a driver makes an unexpected or quick movement, other drivers need time to react. The only way you can be sure you have enough time to react is by leaving plenty of space between your vehicle and the vehicles around you. That space becomes a “space cushion.” You should try to keep a cushion of space ahead, to each side and behind you.\n\nFollowing Distance\n\nThe speed at which you drive determines how much time you have to act or react and how long it takes to stop. The higher the speed you are traveling, the less time you have to spot hazards, judge the speed of other traffic, and react to conditions.\n\nAlways maintain a safe following distance from the vehicle in front of you. You will have a better view of the road to watch for problems and more time to react.\n\nA safe following distance is defined as 2-4 seconds. For speeds greater than 30 mph, a safe following distance should be 4 seconds or more to allow you time to make a decision and take action.\n\nTo determine if you are following too closely:\n\nWatch for when the rear of the vehicle ahead passes something like a sign or pole. Count the seconds it takes you to reach the same spot.\n\nYou are following too closely if you pass the mark before you finish counting at least two seconds.\n\nIf so, increase the space between you and the vehicle ahead and count again at another spot to check your new following distance. Repeat until you are no closer than two seconds behind the other vehicle.\n\nWhen stopping behind another vehicle, make sure you can see where the rear tires of the vehicle in front meet the road. After traffic starts to move, return to a safe following distance.\n\nThere are situations, such as those listed below, when you need even more space between your vehicle and the one in front of you. In all of these situations, you should increase your following distance:\n\nOn wet or slippery roads. You need more distance to stop your vehicle.\n\nWhen the driver behind you wants to pass. Slow down to allow room in front of your vehicle for the passing vehicle to complete the pass.\n\nWhen following people riding bicycles or motorcycles. You need extra room in case the rider loses control or stops suddenly.\n\nWhen following drivers who cannot see you. The drivers of large vehicles may not be able to see you when you are directly behind them. These vehicles also block your view of the road ahead.\n\nWhen you have a heavy load or are pulling a trailer. The extra weight increases your stopping distance.\n\nWhen it is hard for you to see. In bad weather or darkness, increase your following distance to make up for decreased visibility.\n\nWhen stopped on a hill. The vehicle ahead may roll back when it starts to move.\n\nWhen you are learning to drive. The extra room provides you time to make critical decisions as you learn.\n\nWhen approaching or in a work zone. Traffic may slow or stop unexpectedly in these areas.\n\nSide Space Cushion\n\nA space cushion to the side will give you room to react defensively to sudden moves toward your lane by other vehicles. You should:\n\nBe cautious when driving alongside other vehicles on multi-lane streets. Someone may crowd your lane or try to change lanes and hit you. If possible, drop back a little or move ahead of the other vehicle.\n\nKeep as much space as possible between your vehicle and oncoming vehicles. In general, it is safest to drive in the center of your lane so your vehicle can move left or right to avoid a potential problem.\n\nMake room for vehicles entering freeways. If there is no one next to you, move over a lane. Help other drivers signaling for a lane change make the move safely by slowing down or speeding up a little, if needed.\n\nKeep extra space between your vehicle and parked cars by moving away from them without leaving your lane. A vehicle door may open in your path or someone may step out of a vehicle or from between parked vehicles.\n\nSpace Cushion Behind\n\nYou can help keep the driver behind you at a safe distance by keeping a steady speed and signaling in advance by gently pressing the brake when you have to slow down or stop. Your brake lights will alert drivers behind you that you are slowing down. If a vehicle behind you is following too closely and there is a right lane, move over to the right. If you can’t move over, slowly reduce your speed. This may encourage the vehicle to pass you or to stop tailgating. Never brake hard to discourage tailgating; you could get hit from behind.\n\nBacking Up\n\nA mistake that drivers make when backing up is failing to look both ways behind them. Mirrors do not give you a full view. To see as much as possible, turn your body and head to the right and look out through the rear window. Check for pedestrians and approaching traffic by glancing to either side, then back up slowly.\n\nStopping Distances\n\nYou need to know how long it takes to stop any vehicle you drive. Stopping distance can depend on road and weather conditions, the weight of your vehicle, your reaction time, and the braking ability of your vehicle. The faster you drive, the greater your stopping distance even in ideal conditions.\n\nStopping takes longer than you think. At 60 mph, the distance traveled from the point you recognize a hazard ahead and apply the brakes, to where your vehicle comes to a stop is greater than the length of a football field.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nIt is important for drivers to scan ahead for trouble spots as far as you can see to help you avoid the need for last-minute moves. Scanning means taking in the entire scene, including the sides of the road. Scanning the road ahead and to the sides helps you see pedestrians ahead, potential hazards, vehicles that may enter your path, or signs routing you to another street or road. Look for clues that a driver ahead may be going to slow down or stop, such as a person riding a bicycle or pedestrian on the road ahead, brake lights coming on, or blinking turn signals.\n\nCurves\n\nSlow down before you enter a curve. Use the speed shown below a curve sign as a guide, if posted. Look through the curve to where you want to go and then check the lane position of approaching vehicles. Stay to the right of the center line and in the middle of your lane. Be alert for bicyclists, pedestrians, or slow-moving vehicles hidden around the curve. As you come out of a curve, increase your speed gradually.\n\nChanging Lanes\n\nYour “blind spot” is the area around your vehicle that you cannot see from the driver’s seat even with the use of your mirrors. Avoid driving in another driver’s blind spot, if possible.\n\nBefore you change lanes:\n\nUse your turn signal to let other drives know you plan to change lanes.\n\nCheck your side and rearview mirrors for traffic approaching you from behind.\n\nGlance over your left shoulder if you are moving left. Glance over your right shoulder if you are moving right so you can see if there are any vehicles in your blind spot.\n\nPassing\n\nPassing another vehicle is a normal part of driving, but can be very dangerous. Give yourself a good view of the road ahead by not following vehicles too closely, especially large trucks and trailers. Know the speed and acceleration ability of your vehicle. Be sure you have enough room to complete the maneuver. If you have to cut back into your lane too soon, you risk sideswiping the vehicle you are passing. If you do not get back into your lane soon enough, you risk a head-on collision with an oncoming vehicle. When in doubt, stay in your lane.\n\nWhen passing another vehicle on a two-lane road, you should pass only to the left of the vehicle. Your pass may not begin before the start of a passing zone and must be completed before you enter a no-passing zone. Do not exceed the speed limit when passing; it is against the law to exceed speed limits at any time.\n\nCheck for a clear path ahead. Before you start to pass, check your mirrors and your vehicle’s blind spot by glancing over your shoulder to the rear in the direction of the lane change. Turn on your signal, increase your speed and complete your pass as soon as possible. When you can see the vehicle you passed in your rearview mirror, signal and return to your lane.\n\nNo Passing\n\nSigns and pavement markings help you determine where you are allowed to pass other vehicles. Do not pass in any area where your view of oncoming traffic is limited.\n\nDo not cross the center line to pass when:\n\nSolid Yellow Line and No Passing Zone: You are in a no-passing zone. Do not attempt to pass a vehicle if you cannot safely return to your lane before entering a no-passing zone.\n\nHills and Curves: Your view of oncoming traffic is blocked because you are on a hill or in a curve.\n\nIntersections and Railroads: You are approaching, at or in an intersection or railroad crossing.\n\nCrosswalks: The vehicle ahead is stopped at a crosswalk to permit a pedestrian to cross."
