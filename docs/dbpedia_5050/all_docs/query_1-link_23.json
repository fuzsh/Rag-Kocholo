        "text": "Problem\n\nWhen you select text in a think-cell element and click Home > Paragraph > Align Right in PowerPoint, the text may jump out of its containing think-cell label or element, and may even leave the visible slide area. If a think-cell label uses Align Right by default, e.g., category labels in bar charts, this happens when you insert such a chart.\n\nExplanation\n\nThe problem only occurs if the text box includes a tab stop. If PowerPoint's body text placeholder on the slide master contains a tab stop, think-cell is affected because it follows the body text placeholder's text settings.\n\nThe problem is caused by a bug in PowerPoint 2007 and later. PowerPoint 2003 behaved correctly. We have filed a case with Microsoft, but a fix for current PowerPoint versions was denied. If you want to contact Microsoft Office Support and ask them to reconsider, you may refer to case number 114071111611362. The problem can be reproduced without think-cell.\n\nSolution\n\nAs a workaround until Microsoft fixes this bug, do not use tab stops together with PowerPoint's Align Right button if the shape has Wrap text in shape set to off. This includes think-cell labels because think-cell needs to control text wrap more accurately than Wrap text in shape can achieve.\n\nIf the tab stop is in PowerPoint's body text placeholder, you can fix the problem for all subsequently inserted think-cell labels:\n\nOpen the Slide Master in PowerPoint: View > Master Views > Slide Master\n\nGo to the slide master's top level slide and remove any tab stops from the body text placeholder. You may have to increase the width of the body text placeholder in order to see the tab stop in PowerPoint's ruler.\n\nClick PowerPoint > Slide Master > Close > Close Master View.\n\nDelete and reinsert existing think-cell labels to fix them.\n\nTo fix the problem for individual think-cell labels without changing PowerPoint's body text placeholder:"
