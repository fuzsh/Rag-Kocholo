Is there a way to align those numbers to the left or the center as well?\n\nAs a typographical norm, lists are never center aligned. It affects their readability and is non-standard. If we are determined to center the list, then we should remove the list-style, which makes more sense on an unordered list.\n\nul { list-style: none; margin: 0; padding: 0; } li { text-align: center; }\n\nBullets and numbers are actually not part of the LI, but are pseudo-elements applied :before the list item element. They take their position reference from the UL left and margin properties, as I understand it. Do some follow up reading.\n\nYou can use list-style: inside; to align the numbers.\n\nyou can read more about this here, and his parent list-style\n\nthe initial value is set to outside, but i have the feeling firefox set it to inside by default. Anyway, this property gives you control of position the bullets/numers from your list.\n\nwhat do you mean with not collaps toward the center of the line?\n\nif i have this code:\n\n<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta charset=\"utf-8\"> <title>align</title> <style> li {list-style-position: inside;} </style> </head> <body> <ol> <li style=\"text-align: left\">item 1</li> <li style=\"text-align: center\">item 2</li> <li style=\"text-align: right\">item 3</li> </ol> </body> </html>\n\nthe numbers seems to align, don’t ask me for the technical reasons. I don’t know, and don’t like this aligning much more then you, i just stumbled on this property one time by accident."
