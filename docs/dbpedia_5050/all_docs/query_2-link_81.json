        "text": "Stress symptoms may be affecting your health, even though you might not know it. You may blame sickness for that annoying headache, your sleeping troubles, feeling unwell or your lack of focus at work. But stress may really be the cause.\n\nCommon effects of stress\n\nStress symptoms can affect your body, your thoughts and feelings, and your behavior. Knowing common stress symptoms can help you manage them. Stress that's not dealt with can lead to many health problems, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, obesity and diabetes.\n\nCommon effects of stress On your body On your mood On your behavior Headache Anxiety Overeating or undereating Muscle tension or pain Restlessness Angry outbursts Chest pain Lack of motivation or focus Drug or alcohol misuse Fatigue Memory problems Tobacco use Change in sex drive Feeling overwhelmed Avoiding friends and staying at home Stomach upset Grumpiness or anger Exercising less often Sleep problems Sadness or depression Getting sick easier due to a weaker immune system\n\nAct to manage stress\n\nIf you have stress symptoms, taking steps to manage your stress can have many health benefits. Check out many possible stress management tips. For example:\n\nGet regular physical activity on most days of the week.\n\nPractice relaxation techniques. Try deep breathing, meditation, yoga, tai chi or massage.\n\nKeep a sense of humor.\n\nSpend time with family and friends.\n\nSet aside time for hobbies. Read a book, listen to music or go for a walk. Schedule time for your passions.\n\nWrite in a journal.\n\nGet enough sleep.\n\nEat a healthy, balanced diet.\n\nStay away from tobacco and alcohol use, and use of illegal substances.\n\nAim to find active ways to manage your stress. Idle ways to manage stress that don't get you moving may seem relaxing. But they may make your stress go up over time. Examples are watching television, going on the internet or playing video games.\n\nWhen to ask for help\n\nIf you're not sure if stress is the cause, or if you've taken steps to control your stress but you keep having symptoms, see your health care provider. Your health care provider may want to check for other potential causes. Or think about seeing a counselor or therapist, who can help you find the sources of your stress and learn new coping tools. And if you are concerned about harming yourself, call 911 or a suicide hotline.\n\nAlso, get emergency help right away if you have chest pain, especially if you also have shortness of breath; jaw, back, shoulder or arm pain; sweating; dizziness; or nausea. These may be warning signs of a heart attack and not simply stress symptoms.\n\nSee more In-depth"
