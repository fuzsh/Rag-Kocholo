We work with companies and businesses across the North West, from Southport to Wigan, to provide effective, and successful web design solutions. As a result, we have produced this guide to everything you should know about the advantages of left aligned heading text.\n\nWhat are the advantages of left aligned heading text?\n\nAligning the title or heading text, above the fold, on the left hand side of the page is a design practice that can bring a range of advantages and benefits. These include:\n\nGrabbing attention- left aligned title text is sure to be one of the first website features that visitors to your website see. In the UK, we read from left to right, and so if the title text is positioned on the left, you can be sure that this will grab the attention of the website users immediately, and be instantly read. When positioning the title text on the right, there is always the risk that your website users will focus on the stunning above the fold imagery, instead of the text, and so they may miss an important piece of information or design.\n\nSpace for stunning imagery- by positioning your heading text on the left, the rest of the screen is free to show the rest of the above the fold content, which should include stunning imagery or design. When title text is overlayed in the centre of the screen, and the centre of the imagery, it can detract attention away from the imagery, while also become more difficult to read, especially on smaller screen sizes. Left aligned title text will not have this issue.\n\nStand out- aligning the title text on the left hand side of the page, instead of the centre, can help to make your website just a little bit different, so that you can stand out from competitors online. This in turn will help your company website be more memorable to website visitors, and potential customers and clients, which can result in an increase in brand awareness, and an increase in return traffic.\n\nWhat are the considerations for left aligned heading text?\n\nTo make sure that your left aligned heading text brings these advantages, there are some design considerations to take into account. These include:\n\nThe right typography- the font style you choose needs to match your company branding, and convey the right message about your company. As this will likely be the first ting that website users and potential customers see, this needs to be perfect.\n\nThe right line spacing- spacing between letters and words, as well as the heading text and the rest of the content is very important. This can help draw attention to the text, while also setting this apart within it’s own space to be clear and easy to read, on all screen sizes and devices.\n\nFor more information or for professional web design support, get in touch with the experts today, here at Pumpkin Web Design Manchester."
