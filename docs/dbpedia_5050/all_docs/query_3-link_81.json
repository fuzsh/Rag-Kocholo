However, you can achieve a visual effect that will help eliminate confusion with multiple columns displaying icons.\n\nHighlight the column which you wish to bring the numbers and icon closer together.\n\nRight Click.\n\nSelect Format Cells.\n\nClick the Alignment tab if it does not appear by default.\n\nLocate the Horizontal Text Alignment drop down box.\n\nSelect Right (Indent)\n\nChange the Indent value to one that moves your numbers to a position that visually eliminates the confusion.\n\nClick OK.\n\nCheck the results and adjust the Indent value as necessary."
