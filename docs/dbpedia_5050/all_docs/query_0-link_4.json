        "text": "Lots of creatives stay clear from Hyphenation as it can create short sections of words at the start or end of lines; however, used with the proper settings, Hyphenation can be a great tool to explore.\n\nYou can add Hyphenation by using the shortcut Cmd+Opt+Shift+H or Ctrl+Alt+Shift+H, which will usually improve the spacing between words but can introduce other issues\n\nWord Spacing – making tweaks here can help avoid massive gaps and keep the spacing tighter.\n\nLetter spacing – by default, InDesign doesn't allow letter spacing; however, some minor tweaks can help remove gaps and potentially reduce the number of lines in the text frame.\n\nGlyph Scaling – again, by default, the characters are not set to scale up or down but introducing a tiny amount of tolerance can further improve the appearance of the text.\n\nComposer Settings - The default setting will be Adobe Paragraph Composer, which is usually fine. However, if you work with small amounts of text and want better control over keeping certain words on one line, you can change this to Adobe Single-line Composer. Then when adding a soft break (Shift+Enter), only the following line changes, rather than the whole text frame being affected."
