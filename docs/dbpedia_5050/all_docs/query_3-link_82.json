I have a boolean pushbutton and I want to move the button text towards the left. My problem is I'm having a heck of a time grabbing and moving just the text. 99% of the time my cursor grabs and moves the whole button, but all I want to do is move the text around. I've done it successfully a couple of times, but most of the time I can't select just the text. What's the secret??\n\n********************************************\n\nAmateur programmer for over 10 years!\n\n********************************************\n\nThanks! I haven't messed with Labview in over 5 years and I'm rusty as can be. Every time I moved the cursor inside the pushbutton it would change to the little hand, and I was going nuts trying to remember how to select and move just the text. I have a lot of cobwebs to clean out!\n\n********************************************\n\nAmateur programmer for over 10 years!\n\n********************************************"
