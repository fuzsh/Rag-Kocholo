        "text": "Answer\n\nThe text-align property is used to align the inner content of a block element. This means that in addition to aligning text, it can also be used to align inline or inline-block elements within a containing div.\n\nYou will learn more about inline, inline-block, and block level elements in the next exercise.\n\ni think you misunderstood my question, since the instructions said that the browser will align the text to the left of the browser! i mean that seems impossible because the text of any webpage is shown in a web-browser such as mozilla firefox, google chrome , internet explorer & safari etc. if we for example have symbolise the browser with these to signs | browser symbole | then to align text to the left of the browser would be something like this: “text that is left of the browser” | browser symbole |\n\nif text was left of the browser it would be in some other program or desktop that is not the browser or are they trying to say that the text is to be scrolled so that if the browser is rendered at some point the other text will be achieved by scrolling to the left?\n\nHi illpro1, I think you may have misread or misunderstood the text of explanation in the lesson. I am talking about this part\n\nThe text-align property can be set to one of the following three values: left — aligns text to the left hand side of its parent element, which in this case is the browser. Ok. This is not saying to the left of the browser window or the HTML page itself. If no ‘text-align’ rule is put in a .css file then by default the browser will align things to the left side of the browser window or view screen or however you like to think about viewing/looking at a web-page. You can prove this to yourself by making a simple HTML file using the <h>A Test</h>then displaying it your browser of choice. It’s when you as the writer or author or maker of the web-page would like to have some header or paragraph or some other kind of element to appear lined up on the page somewhere else other than the left side is when you use the a text-align to place where you or your customer/client/friend wants it. I really hope this helps clear up the purpose of the text-align property as it is used in CSS files. Oh, and by the way I fully understand what you mean when you say how can the browser be considered the parent. To my mind the browser program isn’t the ‘parent’ in a relational sense to any web-page/web-site. It is the program that displays the contents of the web-page/web-site. The only way I can wrap my mind around it as a ‘parent’ is to think in terms of containers(think of a boxes within boxes) and in this case the browser is kind of like the parent container and the operating system(windows,linux,etc.) is the parent of the browser program and the hardware(motherboard,memory, etc) is the parent of the operating system.\n\nRegards, Wispring"
