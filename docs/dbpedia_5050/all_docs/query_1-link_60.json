        "text": "Hey - Cool. The Confluence team updated the new editor to allow you to set the \"page\" to be full width. So you can now choose.\n\nIf you do go full width, it forces all tables to also go full width which is less than ideal though.\n\nSince this is so unintuitive, it took me a few seconds to figure out what you were talking about. Here's a screenshot to help everyone else find it a little more quickly:\n\nSame problem here, - new cloud Confluence instance -\n\nThe tables start to scroll sideways even there is space left, very inconvenient.\n\nDo anyone has a solution?\n\nSame here. I can see a cloud instance bought a while ago where all content is left-aligned, but after setting up a new instance to demo to our department head, everything is center aligned and wide tables with a centered paragraph above and below looks...rubbish.\n\nI'm almost embarrassed to demo this and I'm currently looking at alternatives.\n\nThe issue for me is that we are not effectively able to use the screen-width. For example, I frequently have tables embedded in my page. Tables are an easy way to present information in a very consumable way. I also find I have to make the tables wider since I have 5+ columns, some with \"comments\" type content.\n\nSo you end up with a page that looks very strange with narrow content, then wide content (tables), then narrow content. All center aligned.\n\nI'd like to have control over the width of the page, and how my content is aligned.\n\n@Nathan Nguyễn This is also happening to me but I was able to find a workaround: If you have any confluence pages that were created using the old legacy template, just clone one of those and copy-paste your page contents to that and save it and just never convert it to the new layout if the popup box asks you to convert it. Worked for me.\n\nI've got the same problem. Table is very narrow and centered. Doesn't look very nice and isn't very useful.\n\nA simple 'left justify' button would be ideal, but the 'Full width' option does seem to work in some situations."
