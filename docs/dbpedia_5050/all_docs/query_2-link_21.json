        "text": "PASSING\n\nKEEP TO THE RIGHT\n\nIn normal driving, you should always keep to the right. NEVER drive on the left half of the road in the following instances:\n\nWhen pavement markings prohibit driving on the left (a no passing zone)\n\nWhen there are two or more traffic lanes in each direction\n\nWhen you are within 100 feet (about 5 car-lengths) of, or crossing, an intersection or railroad crossing.\n\nWhen you are on a hill, curve, or any other place where vision is limited.\n\nWhen within 100 feet of a bridge, viaduct, or tunnel.\n\nYou should always keep to the right half of the road EXCEPT:\n\nWhen passing another vehicle on a two or three-lane street.\n\nWhen driving on a one-way street.\n\nWhen the right half of the road is blocked\n\nPreparing for a left turn at an intersection, private road or driveway\n\nWhen driving more slowly than the normal speed of other vehicles or as close to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway\n\nWhen operating a vehicle on a roadway having four or including two-way movement of traffic, you may NOT cross the center line EXCEPT:\n\nWhen official traffic control devices designating a specific lane to the left side of the center line\n\nPreparing for a left turn at an intersection, private road or driveway\n\nPassing to the left: Passing zones:\n\nObey any sign or markings clearly visible for that section of road\n\nYou may NOT drive on the left in a No Passing Zone\n\nBASIC SAFETY RULES WHEN PASSING LEFT OR RIGHT\n\nIt is not always safe to pass. You should be patient and wait until the time is right. Crashes resulting from improper passing can be deadly.\n\nMake certain the way is clear.\n\nGive the proper signal before changing lanes.\n\nTap your horn when necessary to avoid surprising the driver ahead.\n\nAvoid cutting in too quickly if you must return to your original lane\n\nHOW TO PASS ON A TWO-LANE ROAD\n\nKeep enough distance between you and the car in front of you so you can see ahead clearly. Check rearview and side mirrors and turn your head and look back; someone may be passing you. Signal left.\n\nCheck well ahead for “NO PASSING ZONE” and oncoming cars. Be sure you have time and space enough to overtake the car ahead and return to the right lane before an approaching car comes within 200 feet of you.\n\nTap your horn when necessary to alert the driver ahead.\n\nPass on the left and do not return to the right until you are safely clear of the overtaken vehicle. Wait until you can see the car you have just passed in your rearview mirror before returning to the right lane.\n\nSignal right turn to return to the right lane. Be sure to turn off your signal after you have completed the lane change.\n\nPASSING ON THE RIGHT\n\nIn Texas and many other States, you may pass on the right only when conditions permit you to do so safely, such as:\n\nThe road is clear of parked vehicles or other things and is wide enough for two or more lanes in each direction.\n\nYou are on a one-way road.\n\nYou may pass on a paved shoulder when the vehicle you are passing is slowing or stopped on the main traveled portion of the highway, disabled, or preparing to turn left.\n\nDo NOT pass on the right by driving off the paved portion of the highway.\n\nWHEN YOU ARE GETTING PASSED\n\nDo not increase your speed.\n\nKeep in your lane.\n\nWhen being passed on the left, and lanes are not marked, move to the right as far as you safely can.\n\nMake it as safe and easy as you can for the other driver to pass you.\n\nONE-WAY ROADWAYS & ROTARY TRAFFIC ISLANDS\n\nOn one-way roads, you can only drive the direction of the one way.\n\nWhen encountering a traffic island, always drive to the right of the island.\n\nBLIND SPOT DRIVING\n\nDon’t drive in other drivers blind spot. The blind spot is that area that rearview mirrors cannot show. Either pass the other driver or drop back. When you pass a car, get through the blind spot as quickly as you can. Approach cautiously, but once you are alongside, speed up and get by quickly.\n\nRIGHT-OF-WAY\n\nDrivers, at times must yield the way to others. There are certain rules to help determine the right-of-way, but if the other driver doesn’t follow these rules, give them the right-of-way. Remember, in every situation, right-of-way is something to be given, not taken. All drivers should know and understand the rules which determine the right-of-way. The graveyards are filled with people that had the right-of-way.\n\nINTERSECTIONS CONTROLLED BY SIGNS AND SIGNALS\n\nWhen signs and signals control traffic at an intersection, obey them. Know the meaning of these signs and signals.\n\nSINGLE OR TWO-LANE ROAD INTERSECTING WITH MULTIPLE-LANE ROAD\n\nWhen driving on a single or two-lane road you must yield to:\n\nVehicles traveling on a divided street or roadway.\n\nVehicles traveling on a roadway with three or more lanes\n\nUNPAVED ROAD INTERSECTING WITH A PAVED ROAD\n\nIf you are driving on an unpaved road, which intersects with a paved road:\n\nYou must yield the right-of-way to the vehicles traveling on the paved road\n\nINTERSECTIONS NOT CONTROLLED BY SIGNS AND SIGNAL’S, MULTIPLE LANES, OR PAVEMENT\n\nYou must yield the right-of-way to any vehicle that entered the intersection on your right or is approaching the intersection from your right.\n\nIf the road to your right is clear or if approaching vehicles are far enough from the intersection to make crossing safe,\n\nthen you may proceed.\n\nLEFT TURNS\n\nYou must yield the right-of-way to any vehicles coming straight through from the other direction. A driver intending to turn a vehicle right or left shall signal continuously for not less than the last 100 feet of movement of the vehicle before the turn.\n\nPRIVATE ROADS AND DRIVEWAYS\n\nWhen entering or crossing a road, street, or highway from a private road, alley, building, or driveway after stopping prior to the sidewalk, you must yield the right-of-way to all approaching vehicles and pedestrians.\n\n“T” INTERSECTION\n\nWhen approaching an intersection of a through street from a street that ends at an intersection:\n\nStop\n\nYield the right-of-way to the vehicles on the through-street.\n\nENTERING OR LEAVING A CONTROLLED-ACCESS HIGHWAY\n\nThe driver of a vehicle proceeding on an access or frontage road of a controlled access highway must yield the right-of-way to:\n\nA vehicle entering or about to enter the road from the highway\n\nA vehicle leaving or about to leave the road to enter the highway\n\nIn other words, if you’re driving on the access or frontage road, you have to yield to all vehicles entering and/or exiting the highway. All lanes must yield, not just the nearest lane to the highway.\n\nDRIVING ON MULTIPLE-LANE ROADWAYS\n\nOn a roadway divided into three or more lanes providing for one-way movement, a vehicle entering a lane of traffic from a lane to the right shall yield the right-of-way to a vehicle entering the same lane of traffic from a lane to the left.\n\nRAILROAD GRADE CROSSINGS\n\nWhen you approach a railroad crossing, you are required to stop within 50 feet but no closer than 15 feet from the nearest rail if:\n\nA clearly visible railroad signal warns of the approach of a train.\n\nA crossing gate is lowered, an official traffic-control signal or a flag person warns of the approach or passage of a railroad train.\n\nA railroad engine approaching within approximately 1500 feet of the highway crossing emits a signal audible from such distance and such engine by reason of its speed or nearness to such crossing, is an immediate hazard.\n\nAn approaching train is plainly visible and is in hazardous proximity to the crossing.\n\nA person who fails to obey the law regarding railroad grade crossing is subject to a fine of not less than $50 or more than $200.\n\nNever stop on railroad tracks. Trains do not, and cannot, stop at crossings; THEY ALWAYS HAVE THE RIGHT-OF-WAY.\n\nBe sure all tracks are clear before proceeding after a train has passed. There could be more than one track and one train could block your view of another train approaching.\n\nIn 2021 Texas was ranked first in the nation in highway-rail grade crossing collisions, according to the Operation Lifesaver website. Of the 2,147 vehicular railroad collisions that occurred nationwide, 247 occurred in Texas.\n\nIn highway-rail grade crossing fatalities, Texas is ranked fourth in the nation with 17 in 2021. For many, these numbers are mere statistics—that is, until a friend, acquaintance or family member is involved in such an accident.\n\nRIGHT-OF-WAY TO EMERGENCY VEHICLES\n\nYou must yield the right-of-way to police cars, fire trucks, ambulances and other emergency vehicles which are sounding a siren or bell, or flashing a red light.\n\nPull to the edge of the road and stop.\n\nIf the road is congested, slow down and leave a clear path for the emergency vehicle.\n\nDo NOT follow within 500 feet of a fire truck answering an alarm or an ambulance when the flashing red lights are on.\n\nIf you approach an emergency vehicle that has lights activated:\n\nVacate the lane closest to the emergency vehicle, if the highway has two or more lanes traveling in the direction of the emergency vehicle.\n\nIf you cannot vacate the lane; slow down to 20 mph less than the posted speed limit when the limit is 25 mph or more.\n\nSlow down to 5 mph or less if the posted speed limit is 25 mph or less.\n\nRIGHT-OF-WAY TO SCHOOL BUSES\n\nIf you approach a school bus from either direction, and the bus is displaying alternating flashing red lights, you must stop BEFORE REACHING THE SCHOOL BUS and not pass until:\n\nThe bus has resumed motion,\n\nor\n\nThe bus driver signals you to proceed,\n\nor\n\nThe visual signal is no longer activated (stop signs out or lights flashing).\n\nYou don’t need to stop when meeting or passing a school bus which is:\n\nOn a different road,\n\nor\n\nUpon a controlled-access highway where the bus is stopped in a loading zone and pedestrians are not allowed to cross the roadway.\n\nFailure to obey the laws regarding the right-of-way to school buses will cost you at least $500 or up to $1,250. A second offense committed within 5 years is punishable by a minimum fine of $1,000 and a maximum fine of $2,000 or suspend your license for 6 months, jail time or community service. Texas cities are equipping school buses with video cameras that can record vehicles breaking the law.\n\nRIGHT-OF-WAY TO PEDESTRIANS\n\nAvoid turning your vehicle into a deadly weapon. You should always be on the lookout for pedestrians whether they have the right-of-way or not.\n\nAt an uncontrolled intersection (no traffic signs or signals) if a pedestrian has entered the crosswalk they have the right-of-way.\n\nIf a pedestrian has a “WALK” signal or a green light, they have the right-of-way.\n\nTURNS\n\nTurning a corner appears to be a simple task. However, confusion in traffic and many crashes are caused by drivers who do not turn correctly.\n\nThere are seven steps in making a turn correctly:\n\nMake up your mind before you get to the turning point. NEVER make a last-minute turn; it is too dangerous.\n\nLook behind, and to both sides to see where other vehicles may be before you change lanes. Check your blind spots.\n\nMove into the proper lane as soon as possible. The faster the traffic is moving, the sooner you should move into the proper lane. If you cannot get into the proper lane at least within one-half block before you turn, you should not turn, but continue straight ahead.\n\nGive the proper turn signal at least 100 feet before you make your turn. If using a hand signal, hold it until you are close enough to the intersection for others to know what you intend to do. Do not hold the hand signal while making the turn; you need both hands on the wheel.\n\nSlow down to a reasonable turning speed. Do not use the brake or clutch while actually turning.\n\nMake the turn correctly. This will be easy if you are in the proper lane and proceeding slowly enough at the time you begin to turn.\n\nFinish the turn in the proper lane.\n\nRIGHT TURNS\n\nHow to Make a Right Turn\n\nWell ahead of the turning point, signal for a lane change and when it is safe, move your vehicle to the far right lane.\n\nBegin right turn signal and start slowing down at least 100 feet from the corner.\n\nLook both ways before starting to turn.\n\nKeep as close as possible to the right edge of the road. Turn using both hands on the wheel.\n\nLEFT TURNS\n\nHow to Make a Left Turn\n\nWell ahead of the turning point, signal for a lane change and when it is safe, move close to the center lane.\n\nBegin left turn signal and start slowing down at least 100 feet from the corner.\n\nLook in all directions carefully before starting to turn. Stay to the right of the centerline as you enter the intersection. YIELD the right-of-way to any vehicle (including bicycles) approaching from the opposite direction.\n\nComplete the turn to the right of the centerline of the road into which you are turning by entering the lane in which you will interfere the least with other traffic.\n\nLEFT TURN FROM ONE-WAY ONTO TWO-WAY STREET\n\nTurn from the left lane.\n\nLEFT TURN FROM TWO-WAY ONTO ONE-WAY STREET\n\nEnter the one-way street in the left lane\n\nLEFT TURN FROM ONE-WAY ONTO A ONE-WAY STREET\n\nTurn from the far left lane into the far left lane of the one-way street.\n\nYou may make a left at a red light from a one-way street to a one-way street, unless a “NO LEFT TURN ON RED” sign is posted. Be sure to yield to any oncoming traffic.\n\nSTOPS\n\nA “STOP” sign can be red with white letters OR yellow with black letters. Stop before the crosswalk or intersection, or stop lines. Do NOT block the pedestrian crosswalk. A stop means that you must bring your car to a complete stop; slowing down is not enough.\n\nIf you stop behind another stopped vehicle, you must make another stop at a clearly marked line or before entering the intersection if a stop line is not present.\n\nThe “4-WAY” or “ALL WAY” sign added to a stop sign advises that ALL approaching traffic to this intersection must stop.\n\nSPEED AND SPEED LIMITS\n\nYou should always drive at the same speed as the main stream of traffic. Always be aware of how fast you are driving. You must obey the speed limit but sometimes it is safer to drive with the flow of traffic. The flow can mean faster or slower than the posted limit.\n\nAlways keep a safe distance from the car in front of you; the faster you go the greater the distance you should keep from the car ahead of you. A good rule is to stay at least two (2) seconds behind the vehicle ahead of you. To apply the two second rule, start counting one thousand one-one thousand two after the vehicle in front of you has passed a fixed object (a mile marker, pothole, anything that won’t move). If you pass the same fixed object before you reach one thousand two, you are following too close.\n\nKnow when to slow down:\n\nWhen the road is wet (rain, snow, sleet). Many drivers discover too late what a little rain can do. Roads become slippery when wet, making your car harder to control.\n\nWhen the road is crowded.\n\nWhen your vision is limited. You should always be able to stop within the distance that you can see ahead of your car.\n\nAlways adjust your speed according to your own physical condition and the condition of your automobile. If you are tired or not feeling well, don’t drive. Never force yourself to drive.\n\nDuring periods of heavy traffic, inclement weather, low visibility, or other poor driving conditions, speed must be adjusted so that accidents will be avoided.\n\nRAILROAD CROSSINGS\n\nThere are several signs, signals and pavement markings that indicate highway-railroad crossings. When you see one of them, slow down and be ready to stop.\n\nTrains cannot stop quickly. An average freight train traveling at 30 MPH needs a stopping distance of more than half a mile. Longer trains moving at faster speeds can take one and a half miles or more to stop. Any pedestrian or person driving a vehicle and approaching a railroad-highway grade crossing must stop 50 feet, but not less than 15 feet from the nearest rail of the railroad when: the electrical or mechanical warning devices are flashing, the crossing gate is lowered, a human flagger is warning of an approaching train, or an approaching train is clearly visible and is in close proximity to the railroad-highway grade crossing. Do not proceed until you can do so safely.\n\nAlways approach highway-railroad crossings at a reasonable speed and be prepared to stop if you have to. Be especially alert when you are following buses or trucks, which may have to stop at highway-railroad crossings even when gates are up and the warning lights are not flashing. If your car stalls on the tracks don’t hesitate. Get yourself and your passengers out and away from the car immediately. If a collision is imminent, the safest direction is toward the train but stay off the tracks. That way you will be least likely to be hit by your vehicle or any debris from the collision.\n\nTRAFFIC SIGNALS, SIGNS, AND HIGHWAY MARKERS\n\nTRAFFIC SIGNALS\n\nTraffic signals are there to help provide for the orderly movement of traffic. You must obey these signals EXCEPT when an officer is directing traffic. You must obey a traffic officer at all times, even if he is telling you to do something which is ordinarily considered against the law.\n\nSTEADY RED LIGHT: Stop before entering the crosswalk or intersection. You may turn right unless prohibited by law. You may also turn left if both streets are one way unless prohibited by law. You must yield to all pedestrians and other traffic lawfully using the intersection.\n\nSTEADY YELLOW LIGHT: Caution, a red light is coming up. You must stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at the intersection, if you can do so safely.\n\nSTEADY GREEN LIGHT: Go if it is safe to do so. Watch for vehicles and pedestrians in the intersection. Beware of careless drivers who may try to race across the intersection to beat a red light.\n\nGREEN ARROW AND RED LIGHT: Proceed carefully in the direction of the arrow after yielding right-of-way to other vehicles and pedestrians.\n\nFLASHING RED LIGHT: Stop completely before entering the crosswalk at the intersection. Proceed when you can do so safely.\n\nFLASHING YELLOW LIGHT: Slow down and proceed with caution.\n\nTraffic signs help in the following ways:\n\nWarn you of hazards ahead.\n\nGuide you to your destination (route identification).\n\nInform you of local regulations.\n\nRegulate the speed and movement of traffic.\n\nStandard sign colors\n\nRED: Stop or prohibitions\n\nMovement permitted or direction guidance\n\nBLUE: Motorist services guidance\n\nYELLOW: General warning, caution\n\nBLACK: Regulation\n\nWHITE: Regulation\n\nORANGE: Construction and maintenance work\n\nBROWN: Public recreation and scenic guidance\n\nStandard sign shapes:\n\nOCTAGON: Stop\n\nHORIZONTAL RECTANGLE: Guide signs\n\nEQUILATERAL TRIANGLE: Exclusively for yield signs\n\nPENANT: Advance warning of No Passing Zones\n\nDIAMOND: Existing or possible hazards\n\nVERTICAL RECTANGLE: Regulatory signs\n\nPENTAGON: School advance and school crossing\n\nROUND: Railroad advance warning signs\n\nYou may have seen signs that say “No Engine Brake”. An engine brake is a braking system used primarily on semi-trucks or other large vehicles that modifies engine valve operation to use engine compression to slow the vehicle. They are also known as compression release engine brakes.\n\nWhen trucks use the engine to slow the truck, it makes a sound like ratatatatatata as the truck slows. It’s loud, annoying and disruptive in residential areas. The “No Engine Brake” sign can be found anywhere but mostly on hills.\n\nBlue reflectors are used to mark fire hydrants for the fire department. You may notice these on any street or parking lot. These help the firemen locate these hydrants in all conditions, including heavy smoke.\n\nYIELDS\n\nThe “YIELD” sign tells you that the road you are on joins (merges) with another road ahead. You should slow down or stop if necessary so that you can yield the right-of-way to vehicles on the other road. All lanes on an access or frontage road must yield to vehicles exiting the highway.\n\nSCHOOL ZONES\n\nThe speed shown on the sign is in effect when the yellow light is flashing. Be extremely careful for school children.\n\nWARNING SIGNS\n\nWarning signs alert drivers to conditions which are immediately ahead of and tell you what to look for. There may be road hazards, lane changes, direction changes, or some other situation which you should know about. Disregarding warning signs may be a traffic violation and get you a ticket.\n\nGUIDE SIGNS\n\nGuide signs are especially helpful when you are not in your home area. They furnish information which makes the trip more pleasant, which road you are on and how to get where you want to go for example. Sometimes you will see a smaller green sign with white letters on top of a guide sign along the highway. If the smaller sign is on the right side of the larger guidance sign, the exit for that smaller sign is on the right. A smaller sign on the left side of the guidance sign indicates a left exit for that destination.\n\nTop sign on left/left exit Top sign on right/right exit\n\nRAILROAD WARNING SIGNS\n\nA few hundred feet before a railroad crossing, you should slow down and be prepared to stop. If you see a train coming -STOP- never try to beat a train.\n\nStop not closer than 15 feet or farther than 50 feet from the nearest rail if when railroad lights (if provided) begin to flash, even before the gate lowers across your side of the road. Remain stopped until the gates are raised and the lights stop flashing.\n\nA driver commits an offense if the operator drives around, under, or through a crossing gate or a barrier at a railroad crossing while the gate or barrier is closed, being closed, or being opened.\n\nSCHOOL BUSES MUST STOP AT ALL RAILROAD GRADE CROSSINGS.\n\nPAVEMENT MARKINGS:\n\nBROKEN YELLOW LINE: Divides a two-lane, two-way traffic rural road. Keep to the right of the yellow center line. You may cross the broken line when passing another vehicle or when the right half of the roadway is closed. Do not cross the line if it is not safe.\n\nBROKEN WHITE LINE: Divides a multiple-lane, one-way road. You may drive in any lane. You can cross the line to pass or change lanes, but only when it is safe.\n\nA CENTER LANE WITH TWO SOLID YELLOW LINES With TWO BROKEN YELLOW LINES INSIDE: ”Suicide lane” – for left turns only. Never use this lane for passing or as a through-lane.\n\nSOLID YELLOW DOUBLE LINE: Divides a multiple-lane, two-way road. Do not cross this line to pass. Slower traffic should keep in the right lane.\n\nSOLID YELLOW LINE WITH BROKEN YELLOW LINE: When the broken yellow line is on your side of the road, you may pass but only when it is safe to do so.\n\nTWO THICK WHITE LINES AT INTERSECTIONS: indicate pedestrians crossing areas. When required to stop, you must do so before the crosswalk.\n\nONE THICK WHITE LINE ACROSS TRAFFIC LANES: Stop lines. When these lines are present, you should stop behind the line leaving the line in front of your vehicle.\n\nSOLID WHITE LINES AT PAVEMENT EDGE: Used for edge lines, shoulder markings, channeling, transitions, and lane-use control. Do not cross these lines.\n\nDOUBLE SOLID WHITE LINES: Do not cross these lines.\n\nCONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE DEVICES\n\nVarious traffic control devices are used in construction and maintenance work areas to direct drivers or pedestrians safely through the work zone and to provide for the safety of the highway workers.\n\nOrange signs, barricades, drums, cones, tubes, flashing arrow panels and flag persons are the most commonly used traffic control devices in a construction/maintenance zone. Most signs in work areas are diamond shaped, a few signs are rectangular.\n\nBarricades, vertical panels, drums, cones and tubes are the most commonly used devices to guide drivers safely through the work zone. The diagonal stripes on the barricade or vertical panel guide the driver towards the direction in which the traffic should pass. Stripes sloping down downward and to the right means the driver should bear to the right of the barricade. Stripes sloping downward and to the left means the driver should bear to the left past the barricade.\n\nFlag persons are provided in highway and street work zones to stop, slow, or guide traffic safely through the area. You must obey flag persons.\n\nTraffic fines are DOUBLED for violations of the law that occur in construction zones where workers are present. Workers must be present and the construction zone or maintenance work zone has an applicable maximum lawful speed sign posted.\n\nPEDESTRIAN SAFETY\n\nThe driver should always pay special attention to the pedestrian and the bicyclist. However, there are certain safety rules which pedestrians and bicyclists should follow:\n\nObey all traffic control signals unless you are otherwise directed by a pedestrian control signal.\n\nDo not cross the street between two intersections. It is dangerous to cross in the middle of the block.\n\nUse sidewalks when available, and do not walk in the street.\n\nWalk on the left side of the road if there are no sidewalks. Step off the pavement when a car approaches.\n\nIf you cross a street at any point other than within a crosswalk at an intersection, you (the pedestrian) must yield the right-of-way to all vehicles.\n\nWhen using a crosswalk, keep right if possible.\n\nBlind, partially blind, or disabled persons may carry a white cane while walking.\n\nNo person may stand in the roadway for purpose of soliciting a ride, contributions, or business. A person may stand in a roadway to solicit a charitable contribution if authorized to do so by the local authority.\n\nDo not suddenly walk or run into the street in the path of a vehicle. These sudden actions may make it impossible for the vehicle operator to yield.\n\nWait on the curb, not in the street, until the traffic signals change to green or “Walk”.\n\nAlways wear white or light-colored clothing, or carry a light or reflector when walking at night.\n\nLook both ways before crossing the street and before stepping from behind parked cars.\n\nBe extra careful when getting off a streetcar or bus.\n\nGet in and out of cars on the curb side of the road when possible.\n\nDo not walk on a roadway when you are under the influence or consuming an alcoholic beverage. Alcohol is a contributing factor to pedestrian traffic crashes.\n\nPEDESTRIAN LAWS AND SAFETY TIPS FOR THE MOTORIST\n\nThe law states that a driver shall take the necessary precautions to avoid injuring or endangering a pedestrian crossing or attempting to cross the street. The driver shall bring the vehicle to a full stop if injury or danger can only be avoided by that action.\n\nIf you see a pedestrian crossing or attempting to cross the street, slow down, use your horn if necessary, and be prepared to stop.\n\nBe alert to a pedestrian guided by an assistance animal or carrying a white cane. The white cane indicates the person may be blind, partially blind, or disabled.\n\nWatch especially for the blind persons at bus stops, intersections, business areas, and near schools for the blind.\n\nSTREET RACING\n\nA person may not participate in any manner in a street race, a vehicle speed completion, a drag race or acceleration contest, or a test of physical endurance of the driver of a vehicle.\n\nDrag race is defined as two or more vehicles from a point side by side at accelerating speeds in a competitive attempt to outdistance each other or one or more vehicles over a common selected course, from the same place to the same place, for the purpose of comparing the relative speeds or power of acceleration of the vehicle or vehicles in a specified distance or time.\n\n“Race” means the use of one or more vehicles in an attempt to:\n\noutgain or outdistance another vehicle or prevent another vehicle from passing;\n\narrive at a given destination ahead of another vehicle or vehicles; or\n\ntest the physical stamina or endurance of an operator over a long-distance driving route.\n\nThe penalty for racing is a Class A misdemeanor if it is shown on the trial of the offense that:\n\nthe person has previously been convicted one time of an offense under for racing; or\n\nthe person, at the time of the offense was operating the vehicle while intoxicated or was in possession of an open container\n\nIt becomes a State felony on the third conviction. It becomes a third degree felony if anyone suffered an injury and a second degree felony if anyone suffers serious bodily injury or death.\n\nIMPROVED SHOULDERS\n\nAn operator may drive on an improved shoulder to the right of the main traveled portion of a roadway if that operation is necessary and may be done safely, but only:\n\nTo stop, stand, or park;\n\nTo accelerate before entering the main traveled lane of traffic;\n\nTo decelerate before making a right turn;\n\nTo pass another vehicle that is slowing or stopped on the main traveled portion of the highway, disabled, or preparing to make a left turn;\n\nTo allow another vehicle traveling faster to pass;\n\nAs permitted or required by an official traffic-control device; or\n\nTo avoid a collision.\n\nAn operator may drive on an improved shoulder to the left of the main traveled portion of a divided or limited-access or controlled-access highway if that operation may be done safely, but only:\n\n(1) To slow or stop when the vehicle is disabled and traffic or other circumstances prohibit the safe movement of the vehicle to the shoulder to the right of the main traveled portion of the roadway;\n\n(2) As permitted or required by an official traffic-control device; or\n\n(3) To avoid a collision.\n\nA limitation in this section on driving on an improved shoulder does not apply to:\n\n(1) An authorized emergency vehicle responding to a call;\n\n(2) A police patrol or\n\n(3) A bicycle.\n\n(4) A slow moving vehicle\n\nINTERSECTIONS\n\nIntersections are one of the most common locations for traffic accidents. Besides having vehicles moving in up to four directions, there might also be stopped, slowing or speeding vehicles; red light runners; drivers changing lanes; pedestrians; and drivers attempting to enter moving traffic. Because intersections present so many unpredictable situations you, as a good defensive driver, will always anticipate what might happen before you arrive at one.\n\nWhen approaching an intersection:\n\nTry to enter the correct lane for your intended action well in advance of reaching an intersection. Be sure to signal before changing lanes.\n\nWatch for caution signs warning you of special circumstances at intersections. For example turn restrictions, pedestrian crossings or construction. Signs get knocked down, so beware of the drivers ahead of you.\n\nWatch for other vehicles changing lanes abruptly. Sideswipe collisions are common around intersections. Stay out of other driver’s “blind spot” where they can’t see you in the rear- and side-view mirrors.\n\nMaintain a safe distance between your car and the vehicle in front of you. Rear-end crashes are also very common near intersections.\n\nBe alert to brake lights or turn signals beyond the vehicle ahead of you. Anticipate when others will slow down.\n\nAfter checking to your left when turning right, always look ahead and right before accelerating. Vehicles ahead of you may stop for pedestrians crossing the street. This is a very common rear-end crash.\n\nWatch for pedestrians in all directions before making a turn at an intersection. Also, keep an eye out for cyclists going straight through the intersection, either on your right or on the sidewalk.\n\nDon’t adjust your radio or stereo, dial your cell phone or be distracted by other things when entering an intersection. Inattention is a common cause of crashes.\n\nIf vehicles are stopped at an intersection with no signs, use extra caution when approaching them. They are usually stopped for a good reason.\n\nDon’t tailgate. You never know when the person ahead may turn or stop when approaching an intersection. Tailgating behind large trucks is especially hazardous. You can’t see around them, nor can you see traffic signals ahead. You may enter the signal during the red phase.\n\nWhen crossing an intersection:\n\nWatch for cross traffic. Running a red light, intentionally or not, is a leading cause of intersection crashes.\n\nBe alert to traffic from the opposite direction turning across your lane in an intersection. Even though you may have the right of way some intersections allow left-turns without a green arrow.\n\nDon’t race a yellow light. Don’t assume you are safe crossing on a yellow light.\n\nAlways stop behind the marked stop line or crosswalk. Keep your wheels straight and your foot on the brake while you wait.\n\nDon’t enter an intersection if traffic is backed up on the other side. You may get stuck in the middle of the intersection if the traffic doesn’t move.\n\nDon’t change lanes while driving through the intersection. If you are not in the correct lane before entering the intersection, change lanes after you have cleared the intersection.\n\nTreat a non-functional traffic signal as an “all-way stop.” When you get to your destination, be a good neighbor and call local officials about the disabled signal.\n\nOCCUPANT RESTRAINTS\n\nAccording to a research report from the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration, seatbelts save approximately 13,000 lives in the United States each year. Furthermore, the NHTSA estimates that 7,000 U.S. car accident fatalities would have been avoided if the victims had been wearing belts.\n\nBeing thrown from a moving vehicle is the number one cause of death in car crashes. Staying inside the vehicle is your best chance for survival. Seat belts are designed to keep you inside the vehicle. By the time you need a seat belt, it is too late to put one on so start each trip with all occupants wearing their seat belts.\n\nSafety belts are life belts. They help to keep you:\n\nFrom being thrown from your car during a collision. (Your chances of being killed are five times greater if you are thrown from your car.)\n\nFrom hitting the dashboard too hard.\n\nIn better control of your car.\n\nHUMAN TRAFFICKING\n\nHuman trafficking affects both adults and children, men and women, and people from all parts of Texas, the United States, and around the world.\n\nHuman trafficking happens all over Texas, not just at the border, not just in big cities, not just in rural areas. Texas consistently has the 2nd highest number of calls to the National Human Trafficking Hotline every year.\n\nThere are four major types of trafficking:\n\nAdult Sex Trafficking – Trafficking of adults for sex by force, fraud, or coercion in strip clubs, brothels, massage parlors, street prostitution, or internet prostitution.\n\nAdult Labor Trafficking – Trafficking adults for labor by force, fraud, or coercion into industries, such as agriculture, food service, manufacturing, domestic servitude, or hospitality.\n\nChild Labor Trafficking – Trafficking children, under the age of 18, by force, fraud or coercion into industries such as agriculture, food service, manufacturing, domestic servitude, or hospitality.\n\nChild Sex Trafficking – Trafficking children, under the age of 18, by any means into the commercial sex industry.\n\nAny child can become a trafficking victim, but research has shown that children with increased vulnerabilities are more often targeted according to the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children. Some high-risk groups include: children who are chronically missing or frequently run away; children who have experienced child sexual abuse; children who live with someone with significant substance abuse issues; and children who identify as LBTBQ and have been disowned or stigmatized by their family.\n\nMany traffickers use websites with chat and messaging features, like Snapchat and online gaming platforms, to prey on young people and lure them into meeting in person.\n\nRed Flags for Sex Trafficking\n\nThis is a list of signs or “red flags” that might indicate that sex trafficking is occurring.\n\nPerson seems overly fearful, submissive, tense, or paranoid.\n\nPerson is deferring to another person before giving information.\n\nPerson has physical injuries or branding such as name tattoos on face or chest, tattoos about money and sex, or pimp phrases.\n\nClothing is inappropriately sexual or inappropriate for weather.\n\nMinor is unaccompanied at night or falters in giving an explanation of who they are with and what they are doing.\n\nIdentification documents are held by another.\n\nPerson works long or excessive hours or is always available “on demand.”\n\nOverly sexual for age or situation.\n\nMultiple phones or social media accounts.\n\nSigns of unusual wealth without explanation—new jewelry, shoes, phones without any known form of income.\n\nPerson lives in a “massage” business or is not free to come and go.\n\nWhat can you do?\n\nHere are five key ways you can help spot the signs and prevent child sex trafficking, adapted from prevention efforts designed by the U.S. Department of State and leading child experts:\n\nEducation. Increase your general knowledge and awareness of child sex trafficking, which can help identify potential sex trafficking victims and link them to professional advocates.\n\nRecognize the Signs. Recognizing the warning signs of child sex trafficking increases the ability to identify potential victims and provide help. Some red flags include: unexplained school absences; the presence of multiple cell phones, burner phones or erased call logs; multiple fake IDs; a young person appearing malnourished or hungry, or dressed inappropriately for weather conditions; bruises or other signs of physical trauma; signs of drug addiction; and, presence of a noticeably older, controlling or abusive “boyfriend” or “girlfriend.”\n\nReport Your Suspicions. Always report suspicions of child sexual abuse. Call your local law enforcement or The National Human Trafficking Hotline.Regardless of whether you are a parent or not, you can still make a huge difference – just by being watchful of what’s going on. If you see a child that you feel is in distress, they’re anxious, upset, they’re asking for help or assistance –call to law enforcement or the National Human Trafficking Hotline.\n\nRaise Awareness. It takes a village to raise a child, and also to protect them. Raise awareness in your family, among your peers and in your community on ways to recognize the signs and risk factors associated with child sex trafficking. Download and share resources developed by the Department of Homeland Security’s Blue Campaign, including informational pamphlets, toolkits and key cards featuring trafficking indicators and a tip line.\n\n5. Take Action. Become an advocate for victims and potential victims.\n\n“When you talk to someone who you suspect is being trafficked, ask them if they need help, if someone is hurting them, if someone is making them do things they don’t want to do, or is there someone touching them in their private areas,” say Phrasing it in that way is critical because many victims may not understand what the word “trafficking” means.\n\nIf you see something, say something – whether that be reporting suspected trafficking activities to law enforcement or offering direct assistance to the victim.\n\nPay Attention\n\nPay close attention to the people in your neighborhood and community. Report behaviors that might be evidence of human trafficking. Call as soon as possible after you make the observations. The fresher the information, the more likely law enforcement can take action.\n\nDon’t Approach Traffickers\n\nHuman traffickers are some of the most violent offenders in Texas. Don’t approach them yourself. Instead, contact law enforcement and allow them to respond.\n\nReport suspicious activity:\n\nIn an emergency, dial 911.\n\nTo report suspected human trafficking to Federal law enforcement:\n\n1-866-347-2423\n\nTo get help from the National Human Trafficking Hotline:\n\n1-888-373-7888\n\nor text HELP or INFO to BeFree (233733)\n\nTEXAS DRIVING with DISABILITY PROGRAM\n\nWhat is the Texas Driving with Disability Program?\n\nThis Texas trail-blazing program focuses on improving the interaction between law enforcement and drivers with disabilities with unique communication needs. Texans now have the option to disclose “Communication Impediment” directly on the front of their Driver License or State ID or when registering their vehicle through the DMV. This will alert the trained officer of an individual who may be slower to respond or one who is deaf or hard of hearing.\n\nWhat diagnosis is considered a “communication impediment” under the Texas Driving with Disability Program?\n\nMedically, each disorder lends itself to its own category. However, for law enforcement coding and training purposes, the term “Communication Impediment” is divided into two groups.\n\nWhat are my choices and how do I get started?\n\nCommunication Impediment on Driver License & State ID\n\nCommunication Impediment with a Peace Officer is an optional indicator offered by the Department of Public Safety (DPS) on the Texas State ID and Driver License for those wanting to alert law enforcement of a potential challenge with communication. Ask your doctor to complete form DL-101 and present it at the driver license office. “Communication Impediment” will appear on the front of your card.\n\nCommunication Impediment in Vehicle Registration\n\nThe Texas Law Enforcement Telecommunication System (TLETS) provides authorized law enforcement personnel with query access to the Texas Department of Motor Vehicle (DMV) registration system. Returns of vehicle and driver information are presented through authorized TLETS terminals. The option for disclosure of a communication disability/impediment when registering a vehicle through the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles. Communication Impediment or Deaf/Hard of Hearing will then be privately placed in TLETS thus alerting the officer of communication need prior to approaching the vehicle in a pullover scenario. There are two forms that are available:\n\nAn approved medical provider will need to complete your preferred form. Present the completed form when you register or update your vehicle with Texas DMV.\n\nNew Card: On the Front Side of the Driver’s License and the ID card.\n\nID card\n\nNote: Medical information provided under this program is protected and is not subject to release under the Public Information Act.\n\nANATOMICAL GIFTS\n\nAnatomical gift is the donation of whole or part of a human body to take effect upon or after death of the donor. Any individual of sound mind and 18 years of age or more may donate all or any part of his body. An anatomical gift can only be made by a document of gift signed by the donor who may designate a particular physician or surgeon to carry out the appropriate procedures. An anatomical gift may be made by will as well. You now have the ability to sign up online when you go to renew your driver’s license.\n\nThe donor can later amend or revoke an anatomical gift either orally or through a signed written statement. Delivery of the document of gift during the lifetime of the donor is not essential to validate the gift. The rules covering anatomical gift vary in the different states of the United States. In Texas; a person who has testamentary capacity under the Texas Probate Code may give all or part of the person’s body for a purpose specified by statute.\n\nLITTER PREVENTION\n\nThe Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) spends approximately $11.5 billion dollars yearly to pick up litter. A growing population makes prevention key to solving the problem.\n\nDon’t Mess with Texas has been educating Texans about litter prevention since 1986. TxDOT’s litter prevention program includes Adopt-a-Highway and a grassroots partnership with Keep Texas Beautiful.\n\nThe number of people who have admitted to littering in the past 5 years is 75% that is 3 out of every 4 Texans.\n\nApproximately 1.5 billion pieces of litter accumulate on Texas roadways each year.\n\nTobacco trash is the most common form of litter found on Texas roadsides, and that’s no wonder — 50% of Texas smokers admit to tossing their butts out the window. But here’s a gross tidbit: it can take a cigarette butt up to 20 years to decompose because of the plastic in the filter.\n\nMore than one-fourth (29%) of all litter items are food-related — from fast food items to candy wrappers.\n\nLitter can harm animals. They can get caught in plastic six-pack rings or choke on virtually anything, especially gum or cigarette butts.\n\nYou can be fined $500 for littering in Texas, each time. Over 5 pounds or 5 gallons and the fine is $2000 each time.\n\n40% of Texans believe prisoners are responsible for cleaning up the highways. (They’re not. We are.)\n\nIf every litterer in Texas picked up just six pieces of trash every month, our highways would be completely litter-free.\n\nLAW ENFORCEMENT & EMERGENCY VEHICLES\n\nEmergency vehicles are used by law enforcement, fire departments and emergency medical services. The law was changed in 2013 to include Emergency Medical, blood and organ, State Health Services, public & private ambulances, volunteer fire or ambulance and Federal Government Law Enforcement vehicles. If it has flashing lights, a siren or both-YIELD!\n\nA fire engine and an ambulance have two red lights on the front and back of the vehicle. Both have a siren.\n\nA volunteer fireman, driving a personal vehicle, may have one red light on the vehicle roof.\n\nA police vehicle will have an audible signal and may have lights of any color mounted on the vehicle.\n\nWHEN AN EMERGENCY VEHICLE APPROACHES YOU:\n\nOn the immediate approach of an authorized emergency vehicle using audible and visual signals or of a police vehicle lawfully using only an audible signal, an operator, unless otherwise directed by a police officer, shall:\n\nYield the right of way;\n\nImmediately drive to a position parallel to and as close as possible to the right-hand edge or curb of the roadway clear of an intersection; and\n\nStop and remain standing until the authorized vehicle has passed.\n\nWHEN YOU APPROACH AN EMERGENCY VEHICLE:\n\nThis law includes stationary tow trucks and TxDOT vehicles, utility service vehicles, garbage trucks, tollway project entity vehicles as well as all stationary law enforcement and emergency vehicles when lights are activated.\n\nDrivers nearing any stopped emergency vehicle listed above that has lights activated, unless otherwise directed by a law enforcement officer, to: Vacate the lane closest to the emergency vehicle, if the highway has two or more lanes traveling the direction of the emergency vehicle;\n\nor\n\nslow to a speed not more than 20 miles per hour (mph) less than the posted speed limit when the posted speed limit is 25 mph or more; or Slow to a speed not more than five mph when the posted speed limit is less than 25 mph. A violation is a punishable by a maximum fine of $200. If the violation results in property damage, the maximum fine increases to $500. If the violation results in bodily injury, the offense is enhanced to a Class B misdemeanor.\n\nINCLEMENT WEATHER\n\nChanging weather conditions require changing driver procedures. When the road surface is wet or icy, braking and handling abilities are impaired. It is best not to drive at all in inclement weather but if you must drive, make sure your vehicle is operating safely and stay informed on weather conditions.\n\nThe best way to maintain control and safety once you are out driving in inclement weather is by slowing down your speed. In addition to slick roadways, bad weather can also make driving dangerous because of low visibility. You should lower your speed according to the visibility in front of you, keeping in mind what it would take to stop if you were to suddenly see another vehicle’s tail lights a few feet in front of your car.\n\nIf you cannot see beyond a few car lengths in front of your vehicle because of snow, rain, fog, or other weather, you should pull off as far as possible to the side of the road at an appropriate place, turn on your hazard lights (flashers), and wait out the weather, preferably a safe distance from the vehicle, which could be struck by another motorist in the low-visibility conditions. This highlights the need for appropriate outerwear and other supplies to have, such as an umbrella and flares.\n\nSome drivers do not adjust their driving to the conditions, and continue at regular speeds in situations that warrant caution, lower speeds, and greater distances between vehicles. Focus on your own driving, and if conditions are making you concerned, slow down. Other motorists who want to drive fast through inclement weather should be allowed to pass, but don’t be distracted by them. The best thing you can do to deal with aggressive drivers is to avoid being one. It makes even less sense to be an aggressive driver in inclement weather.\n\nAs in all driving conditions, refrain from talking on a cell phone when driving.\n\nIn 2013, the Texas Transportation Commission was given the authority to temporarily change the speed limit to address inclement weather conditions, congestion, road conditions or any other condition that affects the safe and orderly movement of traffic on roadways. Notice of the changed speed limit can be displayed by using a portable message sign.\n\nFINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY and COMPULSORY INSURANCE\n\nSAFETY RESPONSIBILITY ACT\n\nThe Safety Responsibility Act is in place to ensure that all drivers are financially responsible for the death, injury, or property damage that they may cause while operating a motor vehicle. All owners and/or operators of motor vehicles in Texas must have at least the minimum amount of liability insurance.\n\nThe minimum liability amounts are:\n\n$30,000 against injury or death of one person\n\n$60,000 against injury or death of two persons\n\n$25,000 against property damage\n\nIn order to comply with the Safety Responsibility Act, a driver, unless exempt, must maintain liability insurance or be self insured under the provisions of the Act. Evidence of financial responsibility must be presented to the proper authorities at the time a person applies for a driver license, registers a motor vehicle, or obtains a motor vehicle inspection certificate.\n\nEvery operator of a motor vehicle in Texas is required to furnish upon request, evidence of financial responsibility to a law enforcement officer or to another person involved in a crash. The following list includes what is acceptable proof of financial responsibility:\n\na liability insurance policy in at least the minimum amounts listed above\n\nor,\n\n-a standard proof of liability insurance form issued by a liability insurer that includes:\n\nname of the insurer\n\ninsurance policy number\n\nthe policy period\n\nname and address of each insured\n\nthe policy limits or a statement that the coverage complies with at least the minimum amounts of liability insurance required by this Act;\n\nand\n\nthe make and model of each covered vehicle\n\nan insurance binder that indicates the owner and/or operator is in compliance with the Act\n\na certificate or copy of a certificate issued by the state comptroller that show the owner of the vehicle has on deposit, money or securities, in at least the amount of $55,000.\n\nor,\n\nA surety bond of issued by the Department of Public Safety that shows that the vehicle is a vehicle that has a bond on file with the department.\n\nView the first video before taking the quiz.
