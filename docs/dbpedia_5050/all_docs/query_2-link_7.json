Also, most of the sources I consulted, as part of research, used left-aligned text.\n\nIs it just a subjective matter, or is there a standard?\n\nLook for the specification and implement it.\n\nIn your particular case, your teacher specified that she prefers justifying, so you should act accordingly, since she is the one who will grade your essay.\n\nLater in your academic career, you may come into situations where the format is specified by an institution rather than an individual person, for example, a journal or a funding agency.\n\nanswered Mar 19, 2017 at 20:05\n\nlighthouse keeperlighthouse keeper\n\n26k33 gold badges6767 silver badges118118 bronze badges"
