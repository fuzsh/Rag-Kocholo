        "text": "What is diplopia?\n\nDiplopia is the medical term for double vision or seeing double. The definition of diplopia is seeing two images of a single object you’re looking at.\n\nDouble vision is usually a temporary issue, but it can also be a sign of more serious health conditions. It can be scary when something affects your vision. Diplopia can decrease your depth perception, making driving or walking more difficult and potentially unsafe.\n\nVisit a healthcare provider or eye care specialist right away if you start seeing double.\n\nTypes of diplopia\n\nAn eye care specialist will classify your double vision as either monocular or binocular.\n\nMonocular diplopia happens when you have double vision even when you close or cover one of your eyes. It may look like there are shadows in your vision. Monocular diplopia is the most common (and usually least serious) type.\n\nBinocular diplopia is having double vision when both of your eyes are open. It goes away if you cover or close one eye. Your eyes being out of alignment or health conditions that affect your vision are common causes. Binocular diplopia is usually more serious.\n\nVertical and horizontal diplopia\n\nYour eye care specialist might also classify diplopia as vertical or horizontal depending on where the doubled images appear in your vision.\n\nVertical diplopia means you’re seeing extra images above or below your true vision.\n\nHorizontal diplopia is seeing doubled images side to side.\n\nHow common is diplopia?\n\nDiplopia is very common. Experts estimate that more than 800,000 people a year in the U.S. visit an eye care specialist because they’re having some form of double vision.\n\nIt’s also one of the most common reasons people go to the emergency room. Around 50,000 people every year go to the ER because they have double vision.\n\nHow do you fix double vision?\n\nWhich treatments you’ll need depends on what’s causing diplopia. Your eye care specialist or healthcare provider will treat the cause.\n\nSome people only need new (or adjusted) glasses or contacts. You might have to cover one eye for a while or wear a special contact lens to help your eyes regain their usual sight.\n\nYour eye care specialist will walk you through how to manage your symptoms, including getting rid of the diplopia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow soon after treatment will I feel better?\n\nIt depends on what’s causing the diplopia. Some cases of double vision go away on their own, others won’t get better until your eye care specialist treats the cause.\n\nIf you need surgery to correct the issues in your eye (like removing cataracts), you might need a few weeks to feel better.\n\nWhat can I expect if I have diplopia?\n\nDouble vision is usually a short-term issue. You shouldn’t drive or do anything else that could hurt yourself or others while your vision is impaired. Depending on what’s causing the diplopia, you might need to make some adjustments to your daily routine.\n\nWhen should I worry about double vision?\n\nDouble vision is always concerning, but you shouldn’t assume the worst. Most cases are temporary. In fact, the diplopia might go away on its own. But you should still get your eyes checked if you experience double vision.\n\nIf you have double vision more than once, or if it comes and goes, you could have transient (intermittent) diplopia. Even if your double vision clears up on its own, you should see an eye care specialist or healthcare provider.\n\nHow do I take care of myself?\n\nTell your eye care specialist about any changes in your eyes or vision. If you wear glasses or contacts, have your eyes examined regularly so your provider can adjust your prescription as often as necessary.\n\nWhen should I see my healthcare provider?\n\nVisit your eye care specialist as soon as you notice any changes in your vision. Whether it’s something as simple as needing new glasses or a more serious condition, don’t wait for symptoms to get worse before having your eyes checked.\n\nWhen should I go to the emergency room?\n\nGo to the emergency room if you’re experiencing double vision that doesn’t go away in a few hours, or if you have any of the following symptoms:\n\nEye pain.\n\nDizziness.\n\nMuscle weakness.\n\nSlurred speech.\n\nConfusion.\n\nDiplopia can be the first sign of serious brain issues like strokes, and you shouldn’t ignore it.\n\nWhich questions should I ask my provider?\n\nQuestions you may want to ask your provider include:\n\nWhat’s causing the double vision?\n\nHow long will it last?\n\nWhich treatments will I need?\n\nHow often should I have my eyes and vision checked?"
