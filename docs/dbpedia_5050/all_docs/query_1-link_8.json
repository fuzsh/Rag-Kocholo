        "text": "People should try to give a straight answer to a straight question. Here is one:\n\nFor Word 2010:\n\n1) On the Home tab, click Show paragraph marks (the button that looks like an inverted P). 2) Double-click on the header of your document. 3) Under Header and Footer Tools, in the Design tab, click Insert Alignment Tab. 4) Choose Right, click OK. You will see that an arrow character was added. Select it and cut it (Ctrl+X) 5) Paste the character between the words that you want to split. 6) Voil√†\n\nThis is accomplished with tabs. The tab stops that show in the ruler at the top of the page determine not just the position of the tab, but also how the text will be aligned relative to that marker.\n\nYou can quickly set tabs by clicking the tab selector at the left end of the ruler until it displays the type of tab that you want and then clicking the ruler at the location you want.\n\nThe various types of tab alignment have intuitive symbols:\n\nSource\n\nIn your case, you position Left and Right tab stops where you want them and insert a tab character between the portions of text that will be left- and right-aligned.\n\nThe rules is way too complicated. Make a one row, two-column table. Set the borders on the table to NONE, make the left column aligned left, and the right column aligned right. The next line can just be a normal line outside the table."
