        "text": "An incredible finals day saw Joe Clarke MBE and Kimberley Woods win silver and bronze medals in the kayak cross events at Paris 2024 Olympic Games.\n\nIn a day of high octane action at Vaires-sur-Marne, Clarke and Woods both made it onto the podium in the inaugural Olympic kayak cross events.\n\nSadly, it was not to be for Mallory Franklin, who was eliminated in the quarter finals.\n\nFeeling inspired and want to give kayak cross a try yourself?\n\nUse our club finder tool to find your nearest club that offers canoe slalom or kayak cross.\n\nYou can also find upcoming kayak cross events you can watch or take part in here.\n\nIn the men's event, Joe Clarke won his quarter and semi finals to progress into the final.\n\nThird off the start in the quarter final, Clarke made a sensational move to take second and finish behind Manuel Ochoa, who was relegated after a fault on gate 8.\n\nThe semi final saw Joe power away from the field and comfortably take his place in the final alongside Finn Butcher in second place.\n\nJoe took the far right lane in the final, but off the start line Butcher took the lead, with Clarke in second place after his route was blocked off by bronze medallist Noah Hegge.\n\nDespite the best efforts of the Stafford and Stone paddler to catch the New Zealander, Joe crossed the line in second place to claim a superb silver medal.\n\nIt is Joe's second Olympic medal after winning individual kayak gold at Rio 2016.\n\nSpeaking after the race Joe Clarke said:\n\n“I'm very happy. A long kayak cross schedule getting yourself ready for it each day. I'm delighted with how I've managed that.\n\n“I won every single round coming into the final. I had a lot of work to do with Noah (Hegge) coming into my lane, so I'm delighted to win the silver with the hand I was dealt in the final.\n\n“I came wanting to win gold, but I'm not disappointed in any way. Silver for Team GB is absolutely massive. I'm proud of myself with how I've performed, and that was an epic final.\n\n“To bounce back after a tough start to the final, I'm delighted.\n\n“I'm biased when I say kayaking is the best sport in the world. I think kayak cross will get kayaking to the masses. It's a great package for TV. It's been a great advert as slalom was an absolute spectacle.\n\n“I'm proud my little boy Hugo got to see this today. He hugs my medal. I can't wait for some family time to celebrate with my wife and everyone. My wife (Bel) has sacrificed so much to get me here and support me to be in the best shape and win medals.\n\n“We're just getting started. I'm here with a silver medal and there's definitely more to come. I'm loving life.\n\n“Two medals in five minutes for Team GB. Doesn't get any better than that.”\n\nKimberley Woods progressed smoothly through the quarter and semi finals, winning both of her heats with power and precision through the tricky upstream gates.\n\nIn the quarter final, Kimberley and Alena Marx broke clear of the field to qualify for the semi finals.\n\nWith another dominant display of paddling, Kimberley cruised into the final with another victory, ahead of Angele Hug.\n\nIn a dramatic final, Kimberley was in second place behind Noemie Fox off the ramp.\n\nChasing down the Australian, on the final upstream gate Kim made a brave move to win the Olympic title to pass Fox on the final upstream gate.\n\nHeld on the water with Fox moving away for gold and Hug in the silver medal position, Kimberley crossed the line in fourth place.\n\nBut a fault by Elena Lilik on upstream gate 2 promoted Woods to third place and secured a brilliant bronze medal, her second medal of the Games.\n\nSpeaking after crossing the line Kimberley Woods said:\n\n“There was a moment I couldn't quite get the gate round. I made that decision to hold my position. You can't control what others do.\n\n“There was a moment where I knew I could take the other up and take the silver medal.\n\n“I was in the Olympic final, I wanted to go for gold. I went for it and went for the brave moment. It didn't pay off and I thought I was fourth.\n\n“I really proud of a second bronze medal.\n\n“I went to congratulate Noemie (Fox) straight away. We've been on this journey together getting to the Olympic Games and we're all really good friends.\n\n“Watch this event as the atmosphere is insane. It's an amazing sport to be part of. I'd encourage anyone to give it a go.\n\n“There's so much to it. The start ramp, the roll and the three other people at the same time.\n\n“I'm loving every single minute. The crowd. The music. Representing Team GB and everyone at home. I'm grateful to use my platform for this amazing sport.\n\n“My mantra is don't finish last in the final. I nearly did because of my decision. I rarely make those decisions. I didn't want to play it safe. It's an Olympic final and happens once every four years.\n\n“I'm a brave person in and outside the boat.\n\n“As Joe said, two medals in five minutes for Team GB. Just incredible.”\n\nIt was not to be for Mallory Franklin, who was eliminated in the quarter final.\n\nIn third place, Mallory moved into second with a clean turn around gate 2 and kept out of the traffic behind her.\n\nBut a late move in the roll zone was called by the officials, which brought Mallory's Olympic campaign to an end.\n\n“It was a fight that round. I couldn't get my strokes in. There was a lot of fighting. I went a different way and I think they resulted in a late roll. I need to see it back.\n\n“People are liking this event of kayak cross which is great.\n\n“The experience of the Games has been good. I got to experience the Olympic crowd and perform in front of them.\n\n“My results haven't been what I wanted. I really looking forward to going and watching some sport and enjoying the rest of the Games.”\n\nOn the final day of competition for canoe slalom and kayak cross, Team GB achieved four medals across the six events, the biggest haul for slalom at an Olympic Games.\n\nTeam GB Canoe Slalom and Kayak Cross results\n\nSilver – Adam Burgess: men's individual canoe\n\nSilver – Joe Clarke: men's kayak cross\n\nBronze – Kimberley Woods: women's individual kayak\n\nBronze – Kimberley Woods: women's kayak cross\n\nFifth – Joe Clarke: men's individual kayak\n\n12th place – Mallory Franklin: women's individual canoe\n\nQuarter finals – Mallory Franklin: women's kayak cross"
