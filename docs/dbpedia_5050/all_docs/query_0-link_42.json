        "text": "A car’s steering and suspensions system connects the body of your car to the wheels that propel it forward. So, when the alignment is off, it can throw your whole vehicle out of sync. Driving on bad alignment can have consequences not only for your vehicle’s suspension system, but also the wear of your tires and, most importantly, your safety as you drive. Get to know the signs of bad wheel alignment and why you should come in for an alignment check as soon as possible if you suspect your alignment is off.\n\nHOW LONG CAN YOU DRIVE WITH BAD ALIGNMENT?\n\nYou do not want to risk driving when something is clearly out of sync with your vehicle. Bad alignment is not a problem that corrects itself without professional wheel alignment service and can damage your vehicle in the long run. Continuing to drive a vehicle with bad alignment will:\n\nWear out your tires faster and even permanently damage them\n\nIncrease friction on your tires, making them less fuel efficient\n\nMake steering difficult to control and may put you at risk of an accident\n\nMost of this can be avoided as long as you take your vehicle in for wheel alignment service regularly, around every 6,000 miles. But, if you suspect your vehicle has an alignment problem between appointments, schedule service with a professional to get to the root of the problem as soon as possible.\n\nWHAT ARE THE SIGNS OF BAD ALIGNMENT?\n\nYou should be in control of your car, not the other way around. How your vehicle handles, or mishandles, is the clearest sign you have bad alignment. Here’s some of the most important warning signs to watch out for:\n\nYour vehicle drifts. Position your steering wheel straight. If your vehicle drifts right or left even with the steering wheel dead center, you probably have an alignment problem.\n\nYour steering wheel is off-center. Your steering wheel is a great indicator of potential issues. If it is clearly off center while driving straight down the road, this is an example of bad alignment.\n\nYour tires have excessive wear on one side. Bad alignment can cause uneven tire wear because the weight of your vehicle is concentrated on the inner or outer line of its tread.\n\nTIRES PLUS CAN FIX YOUR BAD ALIGNMENT\n\nWe recommended having your vehicle’s wheel alignment checked at least every 6,000 miles. If you see symptoms of an alignment problem in between appointments, you should not hesitate to bring your car in ahead of schedule. At Tires Plus we offer a variety of alignment services, so you can choose what’s right for your vehicle."
