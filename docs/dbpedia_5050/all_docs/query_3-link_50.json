        "text": "Hi all,\n\nI'm trying to align horizontal rows of text. I'll create a polyline that is 90 deg, straight up and down and I want to align with this polyline. I have all the text I need justified to the top left. I will use command ALIGN and the input required is first point --> second point --> and on and on. However, the alignment doesn't happen. It just doesn't execute.\n\nAm I missing something? Operator error?\n\nThanks and any tips appreciated.\n\nAnyone,\n\nIn regards to getting BricsCAD synched from office PC to Laptop, where would one find a list of all the locations BricsCAD stores the customizations done on the PC, so they can be copied to the Laptop?\n\nAnd no, I don’t even remember all the customizations I have done over the nearly 2 yrs. since installing BCAD.\n\nThe only help given so far is to “create a new profile on the Laptop of what you want”.\n\nTo “re-create” a profile would not help.\n\nHow do I remember all the changes I have made?\n\n‘My hard disk’ doesn’t maintain everything I have done to BCAD, I let BCAD remember how I want it to act, & it does it quite nicely. My memory is not that good.\n\nWhat is needed, is to copy the profile data, which is on the PC, to the Laptop, so the Laptop looks & feels just like the PC.\n\nAlso needed would be the files containing the data for all other customizations that exceed the “out of the box BricsCAD” original installation.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nMike\n\n@MDunn\n\nThe ingredients are:\n\n1) profile export - do using profile manager off start menu, not in options like acad\n\n2) custom menus - check the CUI for what is loaded, grab those and put in same spot on laptop\n\n3) any custom lisps or programs - look in options at your support paths, are any non-OOTB? Copy any to laptop that are\n\n4) anything customized in your %appdata%\\Bricsys\\BricsCAD folder (profile folder), copy to laptop\n\n5) any custom startup lisps like On_doc_load.lsp and On_start.lsp\n\nThe most important thing is make support paths the same, and copy and load the same menus.\n\nIf you find commands missing, you know you left things out so can look for those.\n\nDon't forget to use (findfile \"somefile.lsp\") on command line to ask bcad where it finds some file.\n\nThat helps sort out where things are coming from.\n\nthx\n\nAnd no, I don’t even remember all the customizations I have done over the nearly 2 yrs. since installing BCAD.\n\nSo do I.\n\nSince V19 there is finally a Filter in Settings,\n\nto show only the Settings you have changed.\n\nThis is really helpful.\n\nI would just care a bit about all the path settings you bring\n\nover to the laptop from the PC.\n\nAs a shared local drive on the PC may be mounted under a\n\ndifferent drive letter or name on the laptop. Or a different\n\nuser name for local paths and such things.\n\nWrong Paths in Settings could cause Bricscad to not find\n\nimportant resources. For some problems it may throw out\n\nwarning messages, for some paths like in user folder it may\n\njust create new ones from scratch and you may not even\n\nnotice.\n\nJames & Michael,\n\nThank you very much for the synching info. Working from home as of Friday, have the PC here actually, but I still need to get the Laptop synched w/ it so I don't go crazy going from one to the other.\n\nGot the IT guys trying to figure out why I can't print from home to the office. Turns out my upload speed is from the stone age. Upgrade to FIWI, should fix the issue.\n\nView from my home office, HR department has improved also: A couple of immature bald eagles looking for dinner floating down the Kenai River as the ice goes out. About 50 feet from my desk.\n\nMike\n\n@ MDunn:\n\nIf you export Settings to a CSV file it is relatively easy to remove all the 'read only' lines and then strip out everything except variable names and values. Those can go into a lisp file to automagically set the variables in the new installation. I had to edit some of the value entries because of formatting issues (the export does not always display in the format that is needed by setvar, ie., numbers were returned but setvar required a string for a particular variable). This took a bit of time but was much faster than going through settings one line at a time."
