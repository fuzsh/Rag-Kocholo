The running head is not required for student papers unless the instructor or institution requests it. Thus, typically only professional papers include a running head.\n\nFollow these guidelines to include a running head in an APA Style paper:\n\nType the running head in all-capital letters.\n\nEnsure the running head is no more than 50 characters, including spaces and punctuation.\n\nAvoid using abbreviations in the running head; however, the ampersand symbol (&) may be used rather than “and” if desired.\n\nThe running head appears in the same format on every page, including the first page.\n\nDo not use the label “Running head:” before the running head.\n\nAlign the running head to the left margin of the page header, across from the right-aligned page number."
