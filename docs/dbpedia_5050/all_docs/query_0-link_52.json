The tutorial below will help you to achieve just that!\n\nGet Google’s Google Workspace for your Business Here – fully managed or 20% off.\n\nWhat is Justified Text?\n\nJustification in this sense, means that every line is the same width. Justified blocks of text appear to have a straight line down the right-hand side as well as the left hand side. So, each line starts and finishes at precisely the same point.\n\nThis is achieved in a couple of ways: by increasing the spaces between words, the spaces between letters, in order to achieve the style.\n\nJustifying Text Using Google Docs\n\nGoogle Docs in Google Drive, (Google’s word processor, available to Google Apps users in the cloud, for free, or included in an Apps subscription) allows you to justify either your whole document, or a single paragraph or block of text.\n\nGet Google’s Google Workspace for your Business Here – fully managed or 20% off.\n\nTo Justify All Text in Google Docs\n\nTo achieve justified text, you will want to click the button which looks like 5 parallel lines and type your text.\n\nTo Justify One Paragraph in Google Docs\n\nTo justify a paragraph or block of text, simply highlight the text you’d like to appear justified, then click that symbol.\n\nWhere’s the Button??\n\nThat symbol looks like this in Google docs – just push the button!\n\nShortcuts & Hotkeys?\n\nIs there an even faster way? Yes! The shortcut keys (on windows machines) are pressing the following at the same time:\n\nCtrl + Shift + J\n\nIf you do this while a block of text is justified, it will justify only that text. If you do it with the cursor sitting flashing, all text you type afterwards shall be justified.\n\nYou can find the full list of keyboard shortcuts for Google Docs here.\n\nLeave a comment below if you have further questions."
