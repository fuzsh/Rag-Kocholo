        "text": "The Romanian government on August 28 approved the start of negotiations with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) for the purchase of a major stake in Moldova's Danube River port of Giurgiulesti.\n\nThe port, located near Moldova's borders with Romania and Ukraine, is 134 kilometers from the Black Sea and can be accessed by river and sea vessels.\n\nTwo different port infrastructure entities operate in Giurgiulesti -- Giurgiulesti State Port and Giurgiulesti International Free Port. The Moldovan government said on August 28 that it does not intend to sell the state port.\n\nThe negotiations will take place with the operator of the Giurgiulesti International Free Port, Danube Logistics SRL, which was acquired by the EBRD in 2021.\n\nThe Romanian government approved a memorandum to form a negotiation commission and begin talks with the EBRD to acquire Danube Logistics SRL. The purchase would be made through a company controlled by the Romanian state through the Transport Ministry.\n\n\"The Romanian state has expressed interest to buy the shares given competition between Constanta port and the other Black Sea ports and those of other EU states, as well as the expansion of Constanta port and its transformation into a market leader for central and southeast Europe,\" the memorandum said.\n\nA Moldovan government spokesperson said EBRD is negotiating with several potential investors, including from Romania, Turkey, the Netherlands, and Denmark.\n\nThe Romanian government did not specify when it expected negotiations to take place or how much it was willing to pay, but it appears to be under pressure to start negotiations because the Bulgarian company MBF Port Burgas has already shown interest in Giurgiulesti.\n\nMBF Port Burgas operates two terminals in the Port of Burgas in southern Bulgaria and is part of Navigation Maritime Bulgare (Navibulgar). Until 2008, Navibulgar was the largest shipping company owned by the government in Sofia.\n\nAfter the privatization, Navibulgar ended up in the portfolio of billionaire brothers Kiril Domuschiev and Georgi Petrov Domuschiev, who are close to former Prime Minister Boyko Borisov.\n\nRFE/RL contacted MBF Port Burgas for comment but didn't receive a response.\n\nAn EBRD official confirmed to RFE/RL that the bank wants to sell its stake in the port of Giurgiulesti and is interested in making the process transparent.\n\n\"EBRD wants to find a reputable buyer for the port. We are often approached by various interested buyers, but we are currently focusing on working with the government of the Republic of Moldova to pave the way for a transparent sale process,\" the EBRD official said.\n\nRomania's main Black Sea port of Constanta has seen an influx of investment, including EU funds to increase its capacity, since becoming Ukraine's biggest alternative grain export route following Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022.\n\nAccording to the memorandum, taking into account the competition between the Port of Constanta and the other ports of the Black Sea basin and of the EU member states, the purchase of Giurgiulesti International Free Port would help to expand the port of Constanta and transform it into a market leader for Central and Southeastern Europe.\n\nThe Romanian state's interest in the port was announced last year by Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu.\n\nThrough this investment, Romania will become one of the most important international hubs for the reconstruction of Ukraine after the end of the war, he said at the time.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nIt is \"positive news\" that French President Emmanuel Macron will visit Serbia, said the head of the Delegation of the European Union, Emanuele Giaufret, in Belgrade on August 28, assessing the visit as an important step in Serbia’s path to the European Union.\n\nThe two-day visit, set to begin on August 29, will include a meeting between Macron and President Aleksandar Vucic and is also expected to see the signing of an armament deal to sell French fighter jets to Serbia.\n\nAlong with the signing, Macron will unveil a plaque marking the completion of modernization works at Belgrade's Nikola Tesla Airport, visit the Matica Srpska Gallery in Novi Sad, and give a speech at the Forum on Youth and Artificial Intelligence.\n\n\"It is part of the engagement of the member countries working to strengthen bilateral relations with Serbia, and it is also important in the context of Serbia's European path,\" Giaufret told reporters at a school exchange program event in Belgrade, Beta agency reported.\n\nThe Elysee Palace previously announced that Macron will confirm his support for Serbia's European integration and that his visit will be an opportunity to talk with Vucic about the economy, health care, energy, culture, and artificial intelligence.\n\nMacron's visit comes less than five months after he hosted the Serbian president in Paris. It will be the second visit of the French president to Serbia in the last five years, following the strengthening of relations between the two countries.\n\nSerbia, which has been a candidate for membership in the European Union since 2012, has irritated the European Union by maintaining ties with Russia during its war of aggression against Ukraine and by refusing to impose sanctions on Moscow over its war.\n\nThe European Union told Serbia on August 15 that this behavior is not compatible with EU values and the accession process. Brussels also said the EU \"wants to count on all candidate countries as reliable European partners for common principles, values, security, and prosperity.\"\n\nThe reaction followed meetings between Serbian Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vulin and Kremlin officials in Moscow along with claims of intelligence cooperation with Russia.\n\nWhile in Moscow, Vulin repeated that he is proud that Serbia is \"not part of the anti-Russian hysteria\" and has not joined the Western sanctions imposed in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAt least nine people were killed by fresh Russian attacks on two Ukrainian regions on August 28 as Kyiv's drones struck three Russian regions, setting an oil depot on fire in Russia's Rostov region.\n\nSeveral of those killed were in Ukraine's eastern region of Donetsk, where fighting has been going on for several months as Russian troops press their offensive toward the regional hub of Pokrovsk.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\n\"This morning, Russians killed four people and destroyed a house in Izmaylivka in the Kurakhove community,\" Donetsk Governor Vadym Filashkin said on Telegram.\n\nFilashkin said that two more people were killed by Russian shelling in Chasiv Yar, in the region's Bakhmut district, which was the scene last year of a monthslong clash between Ukrainian forces and attacking mercenaries from the notorious Wagner Group.\n\nA total of 16 houses and two high-rise buildings were also damaged in the shelling, Filashkin said.\n\nIn the Kharkiv region, Russian forces launched a guided aerial bomb on the center of Kupyansk, injuring 14 people, including three police officers, the Kharkiv regional prosecutor's office said.\n\nThe head of the regional military administration, Oleh Synyehubov, said hundreds of windows in residential and municipal buildings were damaged as a result of the shelling. Other administrative buildings, shops, and civil infrastructure were also damaged, Synyehubov said.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said the air strike on Kupyansk had resulted in several deaths but didn't say how many. He also again urged Western leaders to allow Ukraine to use the weapons their countries have provided for long-range strikes against Russian targets.\n\nZelenskiy in his evening video message said the situation in Pokrovsk and other areas in Donetsk region was \"extremely difficult.\"\n\n\"The key Russian efforts and the largest forces are concentrated there, and the stability of each of our units, our ability to destroy the occupier, is very important now,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\nIn Ukraine's southern region of Zaporizhzhya, a Russian drone attack killed three people -- two women and a man -- the region's Governor Ivan Fedorov said.\n\n\"Two women aged 83 and 86 and a 61-year-old man died, three more women aged 19, 30, 56, and a 59-year-old man were wounded as a result of a Russian drone attack,\" Fedorov said.\n\nKryviy Rih, in the southern region Dnipropetrovsk region, was again targeted on August 28 by a Russian missile strike that wounded three people, regional Governor Serhiy Lysak reported, a day after another Russian Iskander missile hit a hotel in the city, killing four people.\n\nLysak said infrastructure and cars also sustained damage in the city.\n\nMeanwhile, Russian officials and Telegram channels reported Ukrainian drone strikes on three regions of Russia, including a first attack on a remote Russian region.\n\nUkraine, whose civilian and energy infrastructure has been battered by relentless Russian strikes since the start of Moscow's unprovoked invasion in February 2022, has in turn resorted in recent months to targeting oil and fuel installations inside Russia that mainly work for the military.\n\nThe governor of the southern Russian region of Rostov, Vasily Golubev, confirmed reports on Russian Telegram channels of a fire at an oil depot in the Kamensky district.\n\nA strong explosion occurred before the fire broke out at the depot located close to the village of Molodezhny, reports on Telegram said.\n\n\"In the Kamensky district, as a result of a drone attack, a fire broke out at a fuel depot. There are no casualties. Emergency response forces are involved in the extinguishing the blaze. There is no threat of fire spreading to residential buildings,\" Golubev wrote on Telegram.\n\nGolubev said earlier that four drones had been shot down by Russian air defense systems above his region.\n\nBaza, a Telegram channel with close ties to Russia's security services, said debris from two drones ignited a fire at three storage tanks in the Kamensky district.\n\nVideos posted on Telegram purported to show what appeared to be large fuel tanks burning in the dark.\n\nUkraine has not commented on the information, which could not be independently confirmed immediately.\n\nIn another Rostov district, Proletarsk, fuel tanks were reportedly still on fire some 10 days after they were hit by Ukrainian drones.\n\nIn the southwestern Voronezh region, Governor Aleksandr Gusev reported a fire \"near explosive objects,\" likely an ammunition depot.\n\nHe said there were no casualties among civilians, but the residents of two nearby villages had been temporarily evacuated by bus as a precaution before being returned to their homes.\n\nSuspected Ukrainian drones also attacked the Kirov region, some 1,500 kilometers northeast of Ukraine's border. The drones targeted an oil storage facility in the regional city of Kotelnich.\n\nKirov Governor Aleksandr Sokolov reported that there were no casualties as a result of the attack and no fire ensued. According to him, \"the situation is under control.\"\n\nThe government in Russia's Kursk region said on August 28 that it would introduce additional security measures in the Kurchatov district and at the Kursk nuclear plant from August 29.\n\nAleksei Smirnov, governor of the Kursk region, said entry to the town of Kurchatov, where the plant is located, would be temporarily restricted.\n\nUkrainian forces began an incursion into the Kursk region on August 6, and fighting has taken place within about 40 kilometers of the nuclear facility.\n\nThe Ukrainian military said it had shot down a Russian Su-25 plane in Kramatorsk, in the eastern region of Donetsk.\n\n\"In the direction of Kramatorsk, our military shot down a Russian Su-25 aircraft that was trying to fire at the positions of units of the Defense Forces. Antiaircraft forces employed \"a well-aimed shot from a MANPADS system,\" to destroy the plane, the military said in a statement.\n\nMANPADS (Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems) are lightweight and highly mobile antiaircraft weapons.\n\nNATO members meeting in Brussels on August 28 reaffirmed their commitment to further strengthen Ukraine's defenses.\n\n\"Ukraine continues to intercept Russian missiles on a daily basis, saving countless lives. But Ukraine's ability to maintain their defenses requires increased supply and more support,\" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in a statement.\n\n\"In the wake of the latest Russian assault, Allies today reaffirmed they are stepping up their military aid to Ukraine,\" Stoltenberg said. \"We must continue to provide Ukraine with the equipment and munitions it needs to defend itself against Russia’s invasion. This is vital for Ukraine’s ability to stay in the fight.\"\n\nTelegram chief Pavel Durov has been indicted on charges of failing to curb extremist and illegal content on the popular messaging app and placed under judicial supervision, the Paris prosecutor's office said on August 28.\n\nDurov is required to report to the police station twice a week and is prohibited from leaving France, the prosecutor's office said in a statement posted on X. Investigative judges in Paris also ordered the Russian-born co-founder and CEO of Telegram to pay 5 million euros bail.\n\nDurov was detained at Le Bourget airport outside Paris on August 24 and held for questioning. According to French media reports, this was done at the request of a special unit within France's Interior Ministry in charge of investigating crimes against minors.\n\nThe allegations against Durov include that his platform is being used for child sexual abuse material and drug trafficking, and that Telegram refused to share information or documents with investigators as required by law.\n\nThe first preliminary charge against him is for \"complicity in managing an online platform to allow illicit transactions by an organized group,'' a crime that can lead to sentences of up to 10 years in prison and a 500,000 euro fine, the prosecutor's office said.\n\nPreliminary charges under French law mean magistrates have strong reason to believe a crime was committed but allow more time for further investigation.\n\nTelegram said in a statement on August 25 that Durov had nothing to hide, adding it was absurd to hold an owner responsible for the abuse of the messaging and social media platform.\n\nIn addition to Russian and French citizenships, Durov holds passports from the United Arab Emirates and the Caribbean island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis.\n\nThe U.A.E. Foreign Ministry said it was \"closely following the case\" and had asked France to provide Durov \"with all the necessary consular services in an urgent manner.\"\n\nIn Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on August 27 that the allegations against Durov were \"very serious\" and that \"they require evidence that is just as serious\" to erase the suspicions of many that the billionaire's arrest was politically motivated.\n\nWithout substantial evidence, \"we are witnessing a direct attempt to restrict freedom of communication and, one might even say, direct intimidation of the head of a large company,\" Peskov said.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has tried to allay such suspicion, saying on August 26 that Durov's arrest was solely part of an independent investigation.\n\nIn a post on X, Macron said France is \"deeply committed\" to freedom of expression but that \"freedoms are upheld within a legal framework, both on social media and in real life, to protect citizens and respect their fundamental rights.\"\n\nTelegram was founded by Durov and his brother in 2013 in the wake of the Russian government's crackdown after mass pro-democracy protests that rocked Moscow in 2011 and 2012.\n\nOne of its main advantages is the encryption of communications and the anonymity of users. In groups, the user's phone number is not visible.\n\nIn his first major interview in seven years, which he gave to U.S. conservative media figure Tucker Carlson on April 17, Durov vowed that Telegram aims to be a \"neutral platform\" and not a \"player in geopolitics.\"\n\nCritics in Ukraine, however, say it spreads misinformation and facilitates illegal actions. Some accuse Telegram of having ties to the Russian state and of contributing to its war effort.\n\nTelegram, based in Dubai, boasts more than 900 million users, the majority of them in Russia, Ukraine, and other former Soviet republics, and is the third-largest communication platform worldwide after WhatsApp and Messenger.\n\nBut Telegram has proved to be a powerful tool in spreading disinformation. A 2023 investigative journalism report found it to be the largest platform for disinformation in Central and Eastern Europe. In 2022 it ran it afoul of authorities in Germany, who issued fines of 5.1 million euros ($5 million) against the operators of Telegram for failing to comply with German law.\n\nA third member of a Belarusian family has been told to leave Sweden by September 3 after a relative was arrested in Belarus following his deportation after being denied political asylum.\n\nFamily members told RFE/RL's Belarus Service on August 28 that the man, along with his mother, was deported on August 21. The detained man's sister, meanwhile, is scheduled to be deported to Belarus by next week.\n\nThe family arrived in Sweden in 2022 saying a probe had been launched in Belarus against them over their participation in mass protests in 2020 against the official results of a presidential election that handed victory to authoritarian ruler Alyaksandr Lukashenka amid opposition claims the vote was rigged.\n\nThe father of the family died in a Belarusian prison, the relatives said, asking that their family name not be published. All of them had taken part in anti-Lukashenka rallies in Belarus that lasted for months after the election, they said.\n\nAfter the father was arrested in fall of 2022, the mother and son fled Belarus for Sweden using Italian visas. The daughter joined them afterward, with all three requesting political asylum in Sweden.\n\nThe father had been sentenced to three years in prison on charges of insulting Lukashenka, inciting hatred, and organizing mass unrest. RFE/RL obtained documents confirming the man's death in Belarusian custody in August 2023.\n\nThe daughter told RFE/RL that the Swedish authorities were reluctant to consider their applications for asylum because they entered Sweden on Italian visas. The woman said her mother and brother were sent to Belarus via Lithuania.\n\n\"They deported them by plane. Mom said it all was carried out with violence against them. My brother resisted a little; my mother was handcuffed -- like some sort of murderer,\" the woman said.\n\nAccording to her, Lithuanian officials then brought her mother and brother to the neutral zone along the Lithuanian-Belarusian border. The brother was then arrested on unspecified charges, while the mother was allowed to travel on to Minsk.\n\nHer brother's exact whereabouts and the exact charges he faces remain unknown.\n\nSwedish human rights defender Martin Ugla told RFE/RL that his country's legislation regarding political asylum is very complex, and while the case is \"outrageous, it's not a surprise.\"\n\n\"The fact is that in order to get asylum in Sweden, you need to prove very clearly that you are in danger of being detained at home. And it is difficult, including in cases concerning Belarus. We know what is happening there, but it is very difficult to prove that it is you who will be detained,\" Ugla said.\n\nAccording to the Swedish human rights defender, after 2020, only about 3 percent of Belarusians who applied for asylum in Sweden received it. The rest were forced to look for other ways of legalization or ask for asylum in other countries.\n\nThe former editor in chief of Novaya Gazeta and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Dmitry Muratov has called on the Red Cross to intervene to alleviate the situation of Aleksei Gorinov, who is serving a 7-year sentence that rights groups and his supporters say is politically motivated.\n\nGorinov, 63, a former Moscow municipal lawmaker, was sentenced in July 2022 for spreading \"fake news\" about the Russian military because of his stance in opposition to Russia's aggression against Ukraine.\n\nIn November 2023, a new criminal case was opened against him for \"justifying terrorism.\"\n\nMuratov sent the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Mirjana Spoljaric-Egger, a request to assist in providing medical assistance to Gorinov.\n\n\"The consequences of inaction are obvious. I ask you, Ms. Spoljaric, to facilitate the provision of medical assistance and to intervene to stop the torture of Aleksei Gorinov by authorities. I again ask you for an urgent inspection by the Red Cross into places where internationally recognized political prisoners are held in Russia and Belarus,\" Novaya Gazeta quotes Muratov's letter as saying.\n\nNovaya Gazeta writes that Gorinov was not issued a mattress or blanket, does not have hot water or a working toilet, and is deprived of books, letters, and phone calls. The publication says that due to his complete isolation, Gorinov has begun to forget words.\n\n\"He is facing a second sentence -- in a case regarding conversations he had with cellmates in which he allegedly justified terrorism,\" Novaya Gazeta writes, adding that the accusation is based on false testimonies by other prisoners.\n\n\"The word of a criminal against the word of a political prisoner is, of course, more significant; Gorinov will be given an extra sentence. He will certainly not live to see the end of it,\" Novaya Gazeta writes.\n\nGorinov was the first individual to receive a prison term under the article on the dissemination of \"fake\" information about the Russian military, which was added to the Russian Criminal Code after the start of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nGorinov underwent surgery to remove part of one lung in 2016. His support group has repeatedly reported on his health problems in prison.\n\nAfghanistan is one of the largest recipients of humanitarian aid from the European Union, EU officials said on August 27, one day after saying it was appalled by a new decree issued by the Taliban-led government further restricting the lives of women.\n\nThe European Union this year has provided 125 million euros ($139 million) to Afghanistan for humanitarian-aid purposes, Balazs Ujvari, European Commission spokesman for budget, human resources, humanitarian aid, and crisis management, said at a European Commission news briefing in Brussels.\n\nIn addition to classic aid distribution, the EU has also organized 35 “air-bridge” flights carrying 1,600 tons of aid since 2021.\n\n“This shows that in a broad variety of areas, we are deploying a variety of humanitarian and civil-protection tools as well to try and alleviate the ongoing difficulties in the country,\" Ujvari said.\n\nEuropean Commission chief spokesman Eric Mamer added that when the EU distributes humanitarian aid, it works with partner organizations, not the government.\n\nNabila Massrali, spokeswoman for EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, said the EU reacted very quickly on August 26 to the Taliban’s so-called Law on the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, but at the same time she defended keeping ties with the Taliban.\n\n“When it comes to the engagement with the Taliban, we do maintain contact...to allow the dialogue for political priories of the EU and to ensure that the EU can provide support to the Afghan people, and this is very important,” she said at the briefing. “The EU engagement with the Taliban is not an acknowledgement of legitimacy.”\n\nIn addition to saying it was appalled by the August 26 decree, the EU statement called it a “serious blow undermining the rights of Afghan women and girls, which we cannot tolerate.”\n\nThe decree imposes further restrictive dress codes for women and says that voices of women must not be heard in public, “which effectively deprives Afghan women of their fundamental right to freedom of expression,” the EU statement said.\n\nThe European Union said the decree, issued on the third anniversary of a suicide bombing at Hamid Karzai International Airport that killed 13 U.S. soldiers and scores of Afghans during the chaotic U.S. withdrawal, also gives the Ministry for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice a mandate to enforce it.\n\n“This, together with the restrictions imposed, punishable under Taliban law, violates legal obligations and treaties to which Afghanistan is a state party, including by undermining Afghan people’s right to due process,” the EU statement said.\n\nIt also noted that the decree creates another obstacle to normalized relations and recognition by the international community -- goals that the Taliban publicly aspires to.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Kyiv has conducted its first test of a domestically produced ballistic missile as Russia unleashed a second day of deadly strikes on across Ukraine.\n\nZelenskiy also said at a news conference following a forum in Kyiv on August 27 that the war with Russia would eventually end in dialogue, but that Kyiv had to be in a strong position.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nZelenskiy said he hoped to go to the United States in September to attend the UN General Assembly in New York and meet U.S. President Joe Biden and present a plan to end the war. Kyiv's incursion into Russia's Kursk region is part of that plan, but it also includes other steps on the economic and diplomatic fronts, he said.\n\n\"The main point of this plan is to force Russia to end the war,\" he said, adding that he wants it to be fair for Ukraine.\n\nHe did not elaborate on the next steps but said he would also discuss the plan with Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate running for president, and probably also with former U.S. President Donald Trump, the Republican candidate.\n\nHis announcements came as Ukraine has been pleading with its Western allies to remove their ban on Kyiv using weapons they supplied to attack military targets deep inside Russia in order to prevent Moscow's forces from destroying civilian and energy infrastructure.\n\nUkraine has also said it is working on developing the Hrim-2 short-range ballistic missile system, which is designed to combine the features of a tactical missile system and a multiple rocket launcher.\n\nLast weekend Zelenskiy also confirmed the existence of the domestically produced Palianytsia missile, which he called a \"new class\" of weapon for Ukraine.\n\nZelenskiy spoke hours after at least five people were killed and several more were wounded in a second massive drone and missile attack by Russia on Ukraine in as many days.\n\nIn Russia's Kursk, where fighting has been under way since August 6 when Ukrainian forces launched a shock incursion into Russian territory, Rafael Grossi, the chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the UN nuclear agency, visited the Kurchatov nuclear plant amid fears about the atomic installation's safety.\n\nGrossi said after the visit that there was a risk of \"nuclear incident\" at the plant, where the situation was serious.\n\nThe Kurchatov plant is situated some 60 kilometers from the Ukrainian border on the banks of the Seym River, where there has been heavy fighting for the past three weeks.\n\nSeparately, the Ukrainian military's top commander, General Oleksandr Syrskiy, said that his forces now control 1,294 square kilometers and 100 settlements in Kursk. He also said Ukrainian troops have taken a total of 594 Russian prisoners during the ongoing operation in Kursk.\n\nAs Russia launched another wave of strikes, the Ukrainian Air Force said it had shot down a total of 60 drones and 5 missiles early on August 27.\n\nThe fresh wave of attacks prompted an all-out air-raid alert declared for the whole of Ukraine.\n\nUkrainian aviation expert Valeriy Romanenko told RFE/RL that the recent massive air strikes that Russia has launched are meant to exceed the capabilities of Ukraine's antiaircraft missile systems.\n\nRockets fly in a \"bunch\" and appear to air-defense systems be just one rocket, Romanenko said. The air-defense system launches a single rocket, but there is not one but five or six to shoot down.\n\nRomanenko also pointed out that the Russians are using X-101 missiles, which have a range of almost 5,500 kilometers.\n\n\"The Russians take advantage of this and plan trajectories in such a way as to avoid the positions of antiaircraft missile systems as much as possible,\" he told Current Time, the Russian-language network run by RFE/RL. They also use variations in the terrain where possible, programming the rockets to pass undetected behind hills and other topography and make many turns without losing the target.\n\nIn the latest wave of Russian missiles strikes, a hotel in Kryviy Rih in the southern region of Dnipropetrovsk was hit. Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram that a man and a woman had been killed and five people were wounded.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:00:49 0:00\n\nLocal officials also said that two people had been killed in overnight Russian strikes in the southern region of Zaporizhzhya.\n\nIn the northeastern region of Kharkiv, a Russian missile killed one person and wounded another five, regional Governor Oleh Synyehubov said on Telegram.\n\nIn the Khmelnytskiy region, eight Russian drones were shot down, but a person was wounded during the attack, regional Governor Serhiy Tyurin said on Telegram.\n\nAir defense systems shot down all 15 drones that attacked Kyiv, the administration of the Ukrainian capital said, adding that a fire broke out due to falling debris in a forest park in the city's Dnipro district.\n\nVyacheslav Gladkov, the governor or Russia's Belgorod region bordering Ukraine, claimed early on August 27 that the situation was challenging but manageable in the area amid an attempted incursion by Ukrainian troops.\n\n\"According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the situation on the border remains difficult, but under control. Our military is carrying out planned work. I ask you to remain calm and trust only official sources of information,\" Gladkov wrote on Telegram. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine on Gladkov's claim.\n\nWith reporting by Reuters\n\nThe Basmanny district court in Russia sentenced former Ukrainian Ambassador to Kazakhstan Petro Vrublevskiy in absentia to six years in prison on August 26 on a charge of inciting ethnic hatred.\n\nEarlier this year, Russian authorities issued an arrest warrant for Vrublevskiy and placed him on the country's registry of terrorists and extremists.\n\nVrublevskiy found himself at the center of a scandal in August 2022 -- about six months after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine -- after he said in an interview with noted Kazakh blogger Dias Kuzairov that \"the more Russians we kill now, the fewer of them our children will have to kill in the future.\"\n\nMoscow and Russian organizations in Kazakhstan then demanded that Astana expel the diplomat for his controversial statement, but Kazakh authorities refused, though they did ask Kyiv to replace him.\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in early October 2022 that Moscow was \"outraged\" by the fact that Vrublevskiy remained in Kazakhstan, adding that the Kazakh ambassador to Russia had been summoned over the issue.\n\nIn response, the Kazakh Foreign Ministry said that the tone of Moscow’s request to expel the Ukrainian ambassador was \"dissonant to the character of the allied mutual ties between Kazakhstan and Russia as equal strategic partners.\"\n\nThe Kazakh side also said at the time that Astana and Kyiv have a \"full understanding\" of the situation and that a decision on the diplomat leaving Kazakhstan would be made solely by Kyiv.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy sacked Vrublevskiy in mid-October 2022.\n\nThe Kazakh government under President Qasym-Zhomart Toqaev has been trying to juggle its good ties with Ukraine, its Western allies, and Russia since Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWhile not openly condemning Russia’s aggression, Toqaev has publicly stated that his country would not recognize Russian-occupied entities in Ukraine’s eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions.\n\nKazakh businesses last year set up so called \"invincibility\" yurts (traditional nomadic felt tents) in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, and several other Ukrainian cities, to provide local residents with food, tea, warmth, and the possibility of charging electronic devices.\n\nWith reporting by Interfax and TASS\n\nAt least 4 people were killed while several others were either wounded or missing on August 27 in a second massive drone and missile Russian attack on Ukraine in as many days that included a strike on a hotel in Kryviy Rih, in the southern region of Dnipropetrovsk.\n\nThe fresh wave of attacks came as Rafael Grossi, the chief of the UN nuclear agency, was expected to visit the Russian nuclear plant in Kursk, where fighting has been under way since August 6, when Ukrainian forces launched a shock incursion into Russian territory.\n\nDnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram on August 27 that a man and a woman had been killed in the overnight missile attack on the Kryviy Rih hotel. \"5 were wounded, a 43-year-old woman is in a severe state,\" Lysak said, adding that the fate of two more people was unknown, and they could still be under the rubble.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has been copied to your clipboard.\n\nwidth px height px\n\nThe URL has been copied to your clipboard\n\nNo media source currently available\n\n0:00 0:00:49 0:00\n\nLysak said that four high-rise buildings and several shops were also damaged in the attack. He said that Nikopol has also come under attack.\n\nLocal officials also said that two people had been killed in overnight Russian strikes in the southern region of Zaporizhzhya.\n\nAir defense systems shot down all 15 drones that attacked Kyiv, the administration of the Ukrainian capital said, adding that a fire broke out due to falling debris in a forest park in the city's Dnipro district.\n\nThe August 27 attack prompted an all-out air-raid alert declared for the whole of Ukraine.\n\nLive Briefing: Russia's Invasion Of Ukraine\n\nRFE/RL's Live Briefing gives you all of the latest developments on Russia's full-scale invasion, Kyiv's counteroffensive, Western military aid, global reaction, and the plight of civilians. For all of RFE/RL's coverage of the war in Ukraine, click here.\n\nThe Ukrainian Air Force said it had shot down a total of 60 drones and 5 missiles early on August 27.\n\nReports of drone and missile attacks have also come from Zhytomyr, Vinnytsia, Khmelnytskiy, and other regions.\n\nIn the Khmelnytskiy region, eight Russian drones were shot down, but a person was wounded during the attack, regional governor Serhiy Tyurin said on Telegram.\n\nGrossi, the director of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said on Twitter that he was going to the Kursk nuclear plant to assess the situation there.\n\n\"Given the serious situation, I’m personally leading tomorrow’s IAEA mission to the Kursk Nuclear Power Plant in Russia,\" Grossi said on X.\n\nThe plant is situated some 60 kilometers from the Ukrainian border on the banks of the Seym River, where heavy fighting has been under way for the past three weeks.\n\nOn August 26, Russian forces launched more than 200 drones and missiles at Ukraine's territory, killing at least seven people and damaging energy infrastructure.\n\nThe August 26 attack was condemned by U.S. President Joe Biden as \"outrageous.\"\n\nFollowing the August 26 attacks, President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on Ukraine's global allies to take \"decisive action\" and allow Ukraine to strike military targets deeper inside Russia with Western-provided weapons.\n\n\"Ukraine cannot be constrained in its long-range capabilities when the terrorists face no such limitations,\" Zelenskiy said.\n\n\"Weakness and inadequate responses fuel terror.... Every leader, every one of our partners, knows the decisive actions required to end this war justly,\" he added, while calling Russian President Vladimir Putin a \"sick creature.\"\n\nThe detention of Pavel Durov, the Russian-born co-founder and CEO of the Telegram messaging app, has been extended by a French investigative judge until August 28 as Moscow expressed outrage over what it said appeared to be \"a direct attempt to restrict freedom of communication.\"\n\nDurov, a billionaire who holds citizenships from Russia, France, the United Arab Emirates, and the Caribbean island nation of St. Kitts and Nevis, was detained at Le Bourget airport outside Paris on August 24 and held for questioning. The Paris prosecutor's office said late on August 26 that Durov's detention order was extended for 48 hours, meaning he must be charged or set free by August 28.\n\nFrance's OFMIN, an office tasked with preventing violence against minors, has reportedly issued an arrest warrant for Durov in a preliminary investigation into alleged offenses, including fraud, drug trafficking, cyberbullying, organized crime, and the promotion of terrorism.\n\nTelegram has said that Durov “has nothing to hide” and that it is “awaiting a prompt resolution of this situation.\"\n\nIn Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on August 27 that the allegations against Durov were “very serious” and that “they require evidence that is just as serious” to erase the suspicions of many that the billionaire's arrest was politically motivated.\n\nWithout substantial evidence, \"we are witnessing a direct attempt to restrict freedom of communication and, one might even say, direct intimidation of the head of a large company,” Peskov said.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron has tried to allay such suspicion, saying on August 26 that Durov's arrest was solely part of an independent investigation.\n\nIn a post on X, Macron said France “is deeply committed” to freedom of expression but that “freedoms are upheld within a legal framework, both on social media and in real life, to protect citizens and respect their fundamental rights.”\n\nDubai-based Telegram boasts more than 900 million users worldwide. In his first major interview in seven years, which he gave to U.S. conservative media figure Tucker Carlson on April 17, Durov vowed that Telegram aims to be a \"neutral platform\" and not a \"player in geopolitics.\"\n\nCritics in Ukraine, however, say it spreads misinformation and facilitates illegal actions. Some accuse Telegram of having ties to the Russian state and of contributing to its war effort.\n\nDespite its critics, there is “no such decision [to close Telegram] being prepared by the National Security and Defense Council,” Yaroslav Yurchyshyn, a Ukrainian lawmaker from the opposition Holos party and the chairman of the Committee on Freedom of Speech in Ukraine's parliament, said August 26.\n\nYurchyshyn told RFE/RL that Ukraine plans to monitor the situation for now and added that the blocking of Telegram in Ukraine is still possible.\n\n“We understand that the French are considering accusations of promoting terrorism, and this has greatly worried the Russian authorities because communication [on Telegram] is not only about military operations in Ukraine,” Yurchyshyn said.\n\nHe noted that communications about the Wagner Group’s special operations in the Central African Republic or other African countries in which France has influence have also taken place on Telegram.\n\n“That is, most likely, the French special services receive additional information that may be of interest to our special services,” he said.\n\nAccess to Telegram was temporarily restricted by Russia in 2018. The decision was made after the messaging app allegedly refused to provide Russia's FSB security agency with encryption keys from users' correspondence, citing the secrecy of correspondence guaranteed by the Russian Constitution.\n\nThe decision to block was sharply criticized by many Russian public figures, as well as critics of the Russian government. However, independent Russian media reports indicated that Telegram reached a compromise with the authorities and has been sharing some data with the security services for several years, although that has been denied by Telegram."
