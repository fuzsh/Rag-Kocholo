        "text": "This is more of a Graphic Design question rather than UX.\n\nThat said, countries that use the Latin alphabet, we read left-to-right and we're accustomed to aiming for that left side of the column when reading and scanning.\n\nSo, most of the time, by default, you'd want to left-align everything.\n\nBut there are exceptions and sometimes center-aligning makes sense.\n\nIn your example case, though, I see no benefit to center alignment so would keep them left aligned.\n\nI think the main question is what context you are doing this in. Generally left aligned will work for most Web applications. What I've found is that this will become more of a relevant question when you have multiple levels of headings.\n\nFor example, the Chicago Manual of Style will place top level headings center, with all sub-level headings left aligned, and also change size or weight depending on how many levels down you go.\n\nEssentially, if you are posting some really detailed, multi-level, documents, maybe you should pick a style and use their standards. Otherwise, I'd hang left :)"
