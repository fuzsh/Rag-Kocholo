        "text": "There were multiple offensive line configurations for Notre Dame coach Joe Rudolph to consider when projected starting left tackle Charles Jagusah went down with a season-ending right pectoralis tear over the weekend.\n\nHe could take projected starting right tackle Aamil Wagner and place him on the left side. He could move one of his guards to tackle. He could have tabbed a young, promising lineman to fill the void.\n\nBut choosing the path of least disruption, Rudolph tabbed graduate student Tosh Baker – the mammoth (6-foot-8, 320-pound) Scottsdale, Ariz. product – to return to the starting lineup after working with the No. 1 unit throughout most of the spring.\n\nThe rest of the starting offensive line – Pat Coogan or Rocco Spindler at left guard, Ashton Craig at center, Billy Schrauth at right guard and Wagner at right tackle – will remain the same.\n\n\"Tosh has started games at both right and left,\" said Rudolph Tuesday. \"His understanding is outstanding. His competitive level and his care level is off the charts. He's ready to go.\n\n\"That's the one thing I've appreciated about Tosh. No matter what role he's had or what title — like working into a practice or working into a game — he's attacked it with the same approach.\n\n\"We're disappointed for Charles. It breaks your heart for him, but we're excited about the opportunity that opens up. The next person steps in and we're going to have him ready to be his best.\"\n\nRudolph was recently tasked with the job of telling Baker that Wagner, a red-shirt sophomore, would be the No. 1 right tackle heading into pre-season camp with Jagusah on the left. Baker had started the Sun Bowl against Oregon State at right tackle to conclude the '23 season when veteran Blake Fisher opted out to begin preparation for the '24 NFL draft.\n\nBaker also started Games 3 and 4 in 2021 at left tackle before Joe Alt emerged and developed into an All-American and first-round draft choice. Baker received most of the No. 1 snaps at right tackle this past spring.\n\nBut the talented and more mobile Wagner emerged as the No. 1 man at right tackle when camp opened. Then just a few days into camp, Jagusah got caught in the rubble and suffered the season-ending injury. It prompted head coach Joe Rudolph, offensive coordinator Mike Denbrock and Rudolph to have to make a snap decision.\n\n\"Aamil outplayed (Baker) in the spring,\" Rudolph said. \"He just played more consistently and noticeably better than him. We're always going to have a competitive camp, so (Baker) was still competing over there on the right side with Aamil.\n\n\"Tosh battled. He didn't play bad. He did a lot of good things in the spring, and it was a tough conversation. You've just got to be honest, and you've got to say, 'Hey, this is where we're at.'\n\n\"What I love about Tosh is he was like, 'Hey man, I want a chance to compete and take that back.' He wasn't like, 'Oh, I'm leaving.' These guys have a love for each other. They understand that even though they have had disappointment, they're going to keep competing for it. They also know somewhere in their heart like, 'Man, (Aamil) went out and did that.'\"\n\nOutside the Notre Dame circle following Jagusah's season-ending injury, there was speculation that the Irish might move the 6-foot-6, 290-pound Wagner to the left side – traditionally the tackle spot where smaller and more mobile players align – with Baker taking over at right tackle.\n\nRudolph said he's more inclined to pick the left and right tackle positions based upon comfortability and adaptation to the two spots.\n\n\"Aamil feels more comfortable on the right, and I think Tosh feels more comfortable at left,\" Rudolph said. \"That just kind of sorted out accidentally. The whole reason to have Tosh at right for the bowl game was I thought he was a better pairing with Billy (Schrauth at right guard), and I thought Charles was a better pairing with Pat (Coogan) on the left side. It wasn't necessarily that I thought one guy had to play one side or the other.\n\n\"I just try to put guys in the best position that I think they can be successful with. Sometimes it's what they do most naturally from a physical standpoint — their build, the way they are…Like Aamil, I kept him on the right side because structurally he's just a lot cleaner when he works from the right side, for whatever reason.\n\n\"I don't try to pigeonhole a guy in one spot or the other. If I think he can really help us or he would raise the level of play at a certain position, I would get him there to help us.\"\n\nRudolph also eschewed the notion of disrupting the chemistry at other starting positions along the line by moving a guard – Schrauth would have been the most likely player to move – to a tackle position.\n\n\"I just think you make sure that you don't weaken one thing to help another,\" Rudolph said. \"Anything's a possibility, for sure, but that would be a reason to not do it.\"\n\nThe Irish were counting on Jagusah to quickly grow up at the left tackle position. Banged up (knee) coming off surgery in the spring of '23, Jagusah was not fully ready physically to play at his highest level in the Sun Bowl.\n\nBut he battled through, held down the No. 1 spot on the left side in the spring, and then reshaped his body with Director of Football Performance Loren Landow during the summer. Jagusah emerged as a trimmed down version of himself when camp opened.\n\nBut now it's up to Baker, who impressed with his commitment to the cause.\n\n\"I think it says everything about him,\" said Rudolph of Baker, who could have chosen to transfer when he was told he was not the projected starter for the Texas A&M game. \"It says everything about how he believes in this place and how he believes in his teammates.\n\n\"At a place like Notre Dame, that's got to be an edge for you. The group you put on the field, they've got to love each other, man. They've got to be willing to make sacrifices for each other. They've got to be willing to go to places that you wouldn't go if you didn't care about the guys around you. And he displayed that in a big way.\n\n\"I think the guys know that about him. Although they feel horrible for Charles, they're ultimately really excited that Tosh gets this opportunity to step up.\"\n\nRudolph is counting on Baker to tap into his skills that led to his four-star, No. 57 national ranking coming out of Pinnacle High School in Phoenix in 2020. Baker was Notre Dame's No. 2-rated prospect in the 17-man class, surpassed in ranking by only tight end Michael Mayer.\n\nRudolph chose Baker over red-shirt sophomore Ty Chan and promising freshmen Guerby Lambert and Anthonie Knapp. Another option would have been red-shirt freshman Sullivan Absher, who played left tackle during the spring before transitioning to left guard over the summer.\n\n\"He's got incredible size, incredible length,\" said Rudolph of Baker. \"He understands technique. He understands situational football. He will play physical. He will give you everything he has. He's a great communicator.\n\n\"I think the guys see him as a leader. I've got no doubt about his ability to step in there and do a great job. I think Tosh is our answer at the left tackle position.\""
