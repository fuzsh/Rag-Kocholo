        "text": "Using \\hfill won't necessarily result in the middle text being centered, as the example below demonstrates. If you want to place the text in such a way that the middle text is really centered, I would suggest using \\parboxes, as the example shows (I used the \\lipsum[2] command to generate text to be used only as a reference):\n\n\\documentclass{article} \\usepackage{lipsum} \\newcommand\\textbox[1]{% \\parbox{.333\\textwidth}{#1}% } \\begin{document} \\noindent Left longer sample simple text\\hfill Center?\\hfill Right \\noindent\\textbox{Left longer sample text\\hfill}\\textbox{\\hfil Center\\hfil}\\textbox{\\hfill Right} \\noindent\\lipsum[2] \\end{document}\n\nIf this construct will be used many times, it would be better to have a command; something along the lines of the \\textline command whose definition and use are illustrated in the following example (in which I also incorporated egreg's suggestion about \\raggedleft, \\centering and \\raggedright):\n\n\\documentclass{article} \\usepackage{lipsum} \\newcommand\\textline[4][t]{% \\par\\smallskip\\noindent\\parbox[#1]{.333\\textwidth}{\\raggedright\\texttt{+}#2}% \\parbox[#1]{.333\\textwidth}{\\centering#3}% \\parbox[#1]{.333\\textwidth}{\\raggedleft\\texttt{#4}}\\par\\smallskip% } \\begin{document} \\lipsum[2] \\textline[t]{555\\,555\\,555}{Some Name}{[email protected]} \\lipsum[2] \\end{document}\n\nThe task is accomplished easily with boxes:\n\n\\noindent \\makebox[0pt][l]{+999\\,555\\,999\\,555}% \\makebox[\\textwidth][c]{Ben Lee User}% \\makebox[0pt][r]{\\texttt{[email protected]}}\n\nThis doesn't check for overlaps, but the chance to getting overlaps is very small.\n\nOne macro for it might be\n\n\\newcommand{\\headerline}[3]{% \\par\\medskip\\noindent \\makebox[0pt][l]{#1}% \\makebox[\\textwidth][c]{#2}% \\makebox[0pt][r]{\\texttt{#3}}\\par\\medskip}\n\nto be used as\n\n\\headerline{+999\\,555\\,999\\,555}{Ben Lee User}{[email protected]}\n\nA more efficient (and more obscure) solution\n\n\\newcommand{\\headerline}[3]{% \\par\\medskip\\noindent \\makebox[\\textwidth][s]{\\rlap{#1}\\hfill#2\\hfill\\llap{\\texttt{#3}}}% \\par\\medskip}\n\nYour question sounds to me like you are doing your CV in LaTeX, or something similar. Yet another solution to achieve neat alignment would be to use a table. Using the tabularxpackage, for example, you can stretch a table to the size \\textwidth and place each item into its own respective cell.\n\n\\documentclass{article} \\usepackage{float,tabularx} \\newcolumntype{Y}{>{\\raggedleft\\arraybackslash}X} \\newcolumntype{Z}{>{\\centering\\arraybackslash}X} \\begin{document} \\begin{tabularx}{\\textwidth}{X Z Y} +123 456 789 & Your Name & [email protected] \\end{tabularx} \\end{document}\n\nThis produces a table with three identically-spaced columns, stretching in sum to the size of \\textwidth. As Z is specified, the content of the cells is also centered. Alternatively, X would left-align and Y right-align. You can use p{1.5cm} or so to have a specific column stretch to a predefined size. As long as you use any of X, Y, Z together with it, the table will stretch to the width of your text margin."
