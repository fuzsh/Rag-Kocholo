        "text": "MS-Word is a word processing application that provides many powerful tools, these tools provide a great advantage to the user. It is used to create documents like letters, articles, etc. MS-Word is an interactive and very user-friendly application. It has been developed by Microsoft Corporation Ltd.\n\nText Alignments\n\nThis is one of the features provided by MS-Word to its user. This feature is used by the user to align text or paragraphs so that it gives a good look or a kind of systematic look. There are 4 types of text alignments which are left-aligned, center-aligned, right-aligned, and justified. (All 4 are shown in the below image.\n\nLeft-Aligned Text\n\nA paragraph or a text is left-aligned when that paragraph or text is aligned evenly along the left margin of the page in MS-Word. Now, we will learn step by step with the help of a diagram to make a paragraph text left-aligned.\n\nStep 1: First open MS-Word on your PC.\n\nStep 2: Now, Open the document or create a new one in which you want to perform this operation.\n\nStep 3: Now, select the paragraph text which you want to make Left-aligned.\n\nStep 4: Now, go to the “Home” tab and click on that. (As shown in the below image)\n\nStep 5: Now, go to the “Paragraph” section in the “Home” tab and click on the Left-Align text button.\n\nStep 6: The paragraph text is aligned to left successfully.\n\nAlternate way or using shortcut key:\n\nThe shortcut key for Left-Aligned Text is “Ctrl + L”.\n\nNow, we can use a shortcut key for the same. Let us see this also step by step:\n\nStep 1: First open MS-Word on your PC.\n\nStep 2: Now, Open the document or create a new one in which you want to perform this operation.\n\nStep 3: Now, select the paragraph text which you want to make Left-aligned.\n\nStep 4: Now, use the Shortcut key which is “Ctrl +L “.\n\nStep 5: The paragraph text is aligned to left successfully.\n\nCenter Aligned Text\n\nA paragraph’s text or a text will be center-aligned if the paragraph or text is in the center of the left and right margins of the page in MS-Word. Now, we will learn step by step with the help of a diagram to make a paragraph text center-aligned.\n\nStep 1: First open MS-Word on your PC.\n\nStep 2: Now, Open the document or create a new one in which you want to perform this operation.\n\nStep 3: Now, select the paragraph text which you want to make Center-aligned.\n\nStep 4: Now, go to “Home” tab and click on that. (As shown in the below image)\n\nStep 5: Now, go to the “Paragraph” section in the “Home” tab and click on the Center-Align text button.\n\nStep 6: The paragraph text is aligned to the center successfully.\n\nAlternate way or using shortcut key:\n\nThe shortcut key for Center-Aligned Text is “Ctrl + E”.\n\nNow, we can use a shortcut key for the same. Let us see this also step by step:\n\nStep 1: First open MS-Word on your PC.\n\nStep 2: Now, Open the document or create a new one in which you want to perform this operation.\n\nStep 3: Now, select the paragraph text which you want to make Center-aligned.\n\nStep 4: Now, use the Shortcut key which is “Ctrl +E“.\n\nStep 5: The paragraph text is aligned to the Center successfully.\n\nRight-Aligned Text\n\nA paragraph’s text is said to be right-aligned when it is aligned evenly along the right margin of the page in MS-Word. Now, we will learn step by step with the help of a diagram to make a paragraph text right-aligned.\n\nStep 1: First open MS-Word on your PC.\n\nStep 2: Now, Open the document or create a new one in which you want to perform this operation.\n\nStep 3: Now, select the paragraph text which you want to make Center-aligned.\n\nStep 4: Now, go to the “Home” tab and click on that. (As shown in the below image)\n\nStep 5: Now, go to the “Paragraph” section in the “Home” tab and click on the Right-Align text button.\n\nStep 6: The paragraph text is aligned to the center successfully.\n\nAlternate way or using shortcut key:\n\nThe shortcut key for Right-Aligned Text is “Ctrl + R”.\n\nNow, we can use a shortcut key for the same. Let us see this also step by step:\n\nStep 1: First open MS-Word on your PC.\n\nStep 2: Now, Open the document or create a new one in which you want to perform this operation.\n\nStep 3: Now, select the paragraph text which you want to make Right-aligned.\n\nStep 4: Now, use the Shortcut key which is “Ctrl +R“.\n\nStep 5: The paragraph text is aligned to the Right successfully.\n\nJustified Text\n\nA paragraph’s text is said to be justified when it is aligned evenly along both the left side and the right side margins of the page in MS-Word. Now, we will learn step by step with the help of a diagram to make a paragraph text justified.\n\nStep 1: First open MS-Word on your PC.\n\nStep 2: Now, Open the document or create a new one in which you want to perform this operation.\n\nStep 3: Now, select the paragraph text which you want to make justified text.\n\nStep 4: Now, go to the “Home” tab and click on that. (As shown in the below image)\n\nStep 5: Now, go to the “Paragraph” section in the “Home” tab and click on Justify text button.\n\nStep 6: The paragraph text is aligned to the Justified text successfully.\n\nAlternate way or using shortcut key:\n\nThe shortcut key for Justified Text is “Ctrl + J”.\n\nNow, we can use a shortcut key for the same. Let us see this also step by step:\n\nStep 1: First open MS-Word on your PC.\n\nStep 2: Now, Open the document or create a new one in which you want to perform this operation.\n\nStep 3: Now, select the paragraph text which you want to make Justified Text.\n\nStep 4: Now, use the Shortcut key which is “Ctrl +j“.\n\nStep 5: The paragraph text is aligned to the Justified text successfully."
