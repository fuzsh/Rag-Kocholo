        "text": "The step-by-step maneuvers in this section are similar to those taught in formal driver education courses in Oregon.\n\nFirst Things First\n\nIt is important to start at the beginning with proper procedures for entering the vehicle, making adjustments, starting the car, and securing the car. Make sure your teen learns, practices, and can demonstrate these driver behaviors before you start practice driving.\n\nEntering the Vehicle\n\nBe Well Rested and Alert\n\nNEVER drive a vehicle when you are tired or sleepy, emotionally upset, or under the influence of alcohol or drugs (including prescription, over-the-counter medicines, and marijuana).\n\nHave Key In Hand\n\nWhen you know you are going to your car, have your key out in your hand. For your personal safety, NEVER search for your keys through your clothes or purse at your car. The goal is to have your keys in a location where you can retrieve them quickly and spend as little time as possible trying to open your car.\n\nApproach with Awareness\n\nAs you approach your car, check around and inside the vehicle. Look inside to ensure no one has entered your car and is waiting for you. You should park in well-lit areas away from places where someone could be hiding (bushes, vans, etc.). Your personal safety could be at risk!\n\nLock All Doors\n\nImmediately after entering the vehicle, lock all doors before you insert the key into the ignition. Someone can easily jump into an unlocked car.\n\nMaking Adjustments\n\nAdjust Seat Position\n\nMove the seat forward/backward to where your feet rest on the firewall just underneath the brake pedal without bending your knees or extending your legs. Then adjust the seat back so your torso is 10-12 inches from the steering wheel. If your steering wheel adjusts, angle it down as far as you can and still see the shape of the dash/display between the upper half of the steering wheel. This is to position it for emergency air bag deployment.\n\nPut the ball of your right foot on the brake pedal. From your foot position, make sure you (a) have full range of motion in your ankle, (b) can fully depress the brake without your heel coming off the floor and (c) can pivot on your heel to put the ball of your foot on the gas pedal.\n\nMake adjustments for best vehicle control and personal comfort.\n\nAdjust Safety Belts\n\nSit up straight with your hips and back against the seat back.\n\nAdjust the lap portion of the safety belt low across your hips and pelvis — NEVER across your stomach.\n\nAdjust the shoulder portion across your chest and collarbone — NEVER across the front of your neck or face, behind your back, or under your arm.\n\nMake sure the lap and shoulder belts are snug.\n\nHint: It is better to have all HVAC and radio devices tuned up and tuned in before you belt yourself into place.\n\nAdjust Head Restraint\n\nTo correctly adjust a head restraint, the top of the head restraint should reach at least as high as the top of your ear and be set back no more than 3 inches from your head. Close head restraints can be twice as effective in preventing injuries as those which are set back too far.\n\nAdjust the Mirrors\n\nThis technique reduces the size of typical blind spots and is also great for reducing headlight glare from behind. Make the following adjustments while you are sitting up straight with your hips and back against the seat back!\n\nAll 3 mirrors, tilt the mirror up or down so the horizon is visible across the center of each mirror.\n\nDriver side mirror, lean your head slightly to the left and adjust the mirror in or out until you can see down the left side of your vehicle.\n\nPassenger side mirror, lean your head slightly to the right and adjust the mirror in or out until you can see down the right side of the vehicle.\n\nRearview mirror, adjust the mirror so you get the widest view out the back window.\n\nNote: Mirrors do not completely eliminate blind spots. Always do a chin-to-shoulder turn of your head to check blind spots before ever making a lateral movement.\n\nDefinition\n\nBlind Spot: the area that is not visible to the driver without turning their head and looking.\n\nStarting the Car\n\nMake sure the transmission is in “PARK\" and the parking brake is applied.\n\nPlace your right foot on the brake and hold it down.\n\nTurn the key halfway to the “ON\" position and allow the onboard computer to boot up. (You may have a newer vehicle with a fob. Secure the fob before pushing the “start\" button.)\n\nCheck gauges and warning lights.\n\nThen turn the key the rest of the way to the “START\" position and release immediately.\n\nTurn your headlights on. Remember you can be seen up to 9/10 of a mile away with headlights on, even in the daytime.\n\nTurn on other necessary accessories if you have not already done so – climate control, wipers, etc.\n\nBefore entering traffic, release parking brake and signal. Check mirrors, look over the shoulder to check blind spot, and go when clear.\n\nSecure the Car After Driving\n\nPlace your right foot on the brake and hold it down.\n\nSet the parking brake.\n\nShift the transmission to “PARK.\"\n\nTurn off all accessories – lights, wipers, climate control, etc.\n\nTurn off the vehicle and remove your key from the ignition. If you have a fob, be sure to put it in your pocket or purse before leaving the vehicle.\n\nBacking\n\nBacking increases the risk for crash because it is much more difficult to see obstacles behind us. In addition, backing up requires more space to maneuver because your back tires do not turn. Plan ahead and position the car so you can pull forward whenever parking.\n\nMake sure your teen learns, practices, and can demonstrate proper backing procedures.\n\nCommon Errors\n\nImproper body position\n\nSpeed too fast\n\nFailure to determine that path of travel is clear\n\nFailure to look back during the whole maneuver until the vehicle is completely stopped\n\nIncorrect steering\n\nBacking Straight\n\nPut your right foot firmly on the brake pedal.\n\nShift to “REVERSE\" and release the parking brake.\n\nDo a 360 degree search to make sure the area is ALL CLEAR!\n\nYield to ALL pedestrians, people riding bicycles, and vehicles.\n\nHold the steering wheel at the 12 o'clock position with your left hand.\n\nTwist your body, place your right arm on the seatback and look over your right shoulder continuously while backing with occasional side to front glances.\n\nTrail brake (do not accelerate using the gas pedal) at a walking pace or even slower when you are near obstacles, cars, people riding bicycles, and pedestrians.\n\nNote: You should never back up long distances on common roadways (forward movement is the law!).\n\nBacking Turns\n\nPut one hand at the 12 o'clock position and turn your head in the direction you intend the rear of the vehicle to travel.\n\nWhen turning the rear of the car to the right, look back over your right shoulder.\n\nWhen turning the rear of the car to the left, look back over your left shoulder.\n\nContinue to look over your shoulder and trail brake (do not accelerate using the gas pedal) while moving at a walking pace.\n\nBegin the turn when the center of the rear tire is aligned with the curb or edge of the road.\n\nBacking Into a Driveway\n\nSignal once you've identified a location to pull over.\n\nCheck your rearview mirror and blind spots for traffic and pedestrians.\n\nLeave the traffic lane and stop within 18 inches of the curb.\n\nShift to “REVERSE\" and complete a 360 degree search to make sure the area is ALL CLEAR.\n\nLook over your shoulder and trail brake (do not accelerate using the gas pedal). Move at a walking pace.\n\nBegin the turn when the center of the rear tire is aligned with the curb.\n\nBacking Out of a Driveway\n\nWith your right foot on the brake pedal, shift to “REVERSE.\"\n\nDo a 360 degree search to make sure the area is ALL CLEAR.\n\nLook over your shoulder and trail brake (do not accelerate using the gas pedal) at a walking pace.\n\nStop short of your intended path of travel (for example, before a sidewalk or the roadway). Stop before entering the roadway and make sure you yield to all traffic, people riding bicycles, and pedestrians.\n\nDo another 360 degree search and when clear, continue to look over your shoulder and trail brake.\n\nBegin the turn when the center of the rear tire is aligned with the curb or edge of the road.\n\nComplete the turn in the smallest amount of space.\n\nStep on the brake and shift to “DRIVE.\"\n\nDefinitions\n\n360 Degree Search: physically turn your head and body to look all the way around your car.\n\nTrail Brake: a slight decrease of pressure on the brake pedal.\n\nBlind Spot: the area that is not visible to the driver without turning their head and looking.\n\nPath of Travel: the area you want the car to go.\n\nParking\n\nMake sure your teen learns, practices, and can demonstrate parking in different situations.\n\nParking is ALWAYS prohibited:\n\nIn front of driveways.\n\nWithin 10 feet of fire hydrants.\n\nIn or near intersections.\n\nClose to crosswalks or stop signs.\n\nEntering Angle Parking\n\nCommon Errors for Entering Angle Parking Are:\n\nFailure to signal.\n\nThe vehicle is too close to parking space on the side.\n\nFailure to see traffic in the rear.\n\nSpeed is too fast.\n\nFailure to target to the center of space.\n\nProper Procedures for Entering Angle Parking\n\nSignal.\n\nSlow or stop the vehicle at least 6-8 feet from the parking space.\n\nCheck your blind spot on the side of the parking space for traffic and pedestrians.\n\nBegin turning when you can see the center of the parking space without your line of sight (or view) cutting across the parking line.\n\nCreep (move very slowly) and turn the wheel sharply toward the center of the space.\n\nOnce you enter the space, straighten the wheels and center the vehicle in the space.\n\nStop even with the curb or parking line.\n\nSecure your vehicle.\n\nFigure 5. Enter Angle Parking\n\nDefinitions\n\n360 Degree Search: physically turn your head and body to look all the way around your car.\n\nTrail Brake: a slight decrease of pressure on the brake pedal.\n\nExiting Angle Parking\n\nCommon Errors for Exiting Angle Parking Are\n\nFailure to signal.\n\nFailure to check rear.\n\nSpeed is too fast.\n\nFailure to look back while backing.\n\nStarts turning before bumper is cleared.\n\nProper Procedures for Exiting Angle Parking\n\nCheck to the rear for a clear path.\n\nWith your foot on the brake, shift to “REVERSE.\"\n\nDo a 360 degree search and yield to all traffic and pedestrians.\n\nLook over your shoulder and trail brake (do not accelerate using the gas pedal) at a walking pace.\n\nCheck the front of your car for clearance.\n\nBegin turning when your front bumper is even with the rear bumper of the parked car to your left or the dash of your car appears to clear the car to the side.\n\nContinue to look to the rear while backing into the nearest lane.\n\nStop smoothly and shift to “DRIVE.\"\n\nFigure 6. Exit Angle Parking\n\nPulling Forward into Perpendicular Parking Space\n\nCommon High Risk Errors Are:\n\nFailure to approach and align to space correctly.\n\nFailure to search for, communicate with, or yield to other traffic.\n\nSpeed is too fast.\n\nFailure to straighten wheels and align in middle of space.\n\nProper Procedures for Pulling into Perpendicular Parking (on the Right)\n\nSignal and position the vehicle 6-8 feet from the parked cars or as far to the left of the lane as possible.\n\nCheck traffic behind you.\n\nCreep and turn the wheel sharp to the right of the space.\n\nCheck your right rear fender for clearance.\n\nStraighten the wheel when you are centered in the space.\n\nIf necessary, shift to “REVERSE\", complete a 360 degree search to make sure the area is all clear, and creep back slightly turning the wheel to the left.\n\nUse a forward reference point to avoid hitting a curb.\n\nFigure 7. Perpendicular Parking\n\nConsider Backing into the Space\n\nIt's safer to drive out of a space in a forward motion.\n\nRequires less time and space.\n\nBetter view when leaving the space.\n\nAvoids backing out into traffic.\n\nOthers are more likely to let you out.\n\nBacking into Perpendicular Parking Space\n\nCommon High Risk Errors\n\nFailure to approach and align to space correctly.\n\nSpeed is too fast when turning to 45 degree angle or backing.\n\nForgets to shift to \"REVERSE\".\n\nFailure to straighten wheels and align in middle of space.\n\nProper Procedures for Backing into Perpendicular Parking (on the Right)\n\nSignal to the right.\n\nSlow the vehicle and approach the space 3 feet away from the parking space.\n\nStop when the driver's body appears to be aligned in the center of the parking space.\n\nCheck for traffic and pedestrians.\n\nTurn the wheel all the way to the left and slowly move to a 45-degree angle to the space. An easy way to do this is look over driver side mirror. Whatever appears over the top of the mirror before you turn is 45-degrees.\n\nStop. Shift to reverse. Turn the wheel all the way to the right.\n\nDo a 360 degree visual check.\n\nCreep backward until your car is perpendicular to the space you picked.\n\nStop moving. Straighten the wheels and back the vehicle into the space.\n\nStop even with the curb or parking line.\n\nFigure 8. Backing into Perpendicular Parking\n\nAdvantages of Backing into the Space\n\nIt's safer to drive out of a space in a forward direction.\n\nRequires less time and space.\n\nBetter line of sight while leaving the space.\n\nAvoids backing out into traffic.\n\nOthers are more likely to let you out into traffic flow.\n\nParallel Parking\n\nEntering a Parallel Parking Space (on the Right)\n\nCheck the rearview mirror and signal.\n\nStop 2-3 feet beside the front vehicle and line up rear bumpers.\n\nShift to “REVERSE.\" Turn the wheel all the way to the right.\n\nDo a 360 degree search. Look over your shoulder and inch backwards.\n\nLooking out the driver's side mirror, stop moving when you see the inside corner of the vehicle (curbside) to the rear.\n\nStraighten the wheels and back in a straight line until your right front wheel aligns with the back corner of the car in front.\n\nCheck the front of your car to make sure it clears.\n\nTurn wheels all the way to the left and continue to inch back until the car is parallel to the curb.\n\nWhen parallel to the curb, straighten wheels and center your vehicle in the space.\n\nExiting a Parallel Parking Space\n\nReverse and inch back until you can see the front car's rear tires. Stop and turn the wheels all the way toward your intended path of travel.\n\nCheck your blind spot for people riding bicycles, pedestrians, and traffic.\n\nSignal and yield to other traffic.\n\nSearch your intended path of travel and enter the nearest travel lane when clear.\n\nCancel signal and check rearview mirror.\n\nFigure 9. Parallel Parking\n\nDefinitions\n\nTrail Brake: a slight decrease of pressure on the brake pedal.\n\nBlind Spot: the area that is not visible to the driver without turning their head and looking.\n\nPath of Travel: the area you want the car to go.\n\nCommon Parallel Parking Errors Are:\n\nApproaches too close or too fast.\n\nFailure to shift to REVERSE.\n\nFailure to look back while moving back.\n\nBegins turning too early.\n\nFailure to check the front of the car for clearance.\n\nParking on Hills\n\nCommon Errors for Parking on Hills Are:\n\nFailure to search for, communicate with, or yield to other traffic, people riding bicycles, and pedestrians when entering or exiting the roadway.\n\nExcessive speed on approach.\n\nFailure to set parking brake when securing the vehicle.\n\nGood Habits/Proper Procedures for Parking on Hills\n\nChoose a legal space and signal.\n\nCheck your rearview mirror and blind spots.\n\nApply the brake and approach parallel to and 6 inches from the curb.\n\nMake a smooth stop and shift into “NEUTRAL.\"\n\nTurn the wheels in the proper direction.\n\nIf facing-up hill with curb, turn wheels left, toward the roadway. (FIG 1.)\n\nIf facing down-hill with curb, turn wheel right, away from the roadway. (FIG 2.)\n\nIf there is no curb, turn wheels right, away from the roadway. (FIG 3.)\n\nIf there is a curb, while in neutral, slowly release the brake until the vehicle's tire stops at the curb.\n\nWith your right foot on the brake, secure vehicle by setting your parking brake, then shifting to \"PARK\".\n\nTop: Turn wheels left.\n\nBottom: Turn wheels right.\n\nTurns\n\nMake sure your teen practices and can demonstrate precision right and left turns. As you practice, remind your teen:\n\nStop at intersections at the legal stop line. If there is no line, then stop at the crosswalk/sidewalk. If there is no crosswalk/sidewalk, then stop before the imaginary line extending from the curb line or edge of roadway.\n\nALWAYS look to the left, to the front, to the right, and then to the left again before entering any intersection. Look twice for pedestrians, people riding bicycles, and motorcycles.\n\nMake ALL turns from the nearest legal lane into the nearest legal lane!\n\nRight Turns With a Required Stop\n\nCommon Errors for Right Turns With a Required Stop Are:\n\nFailure to check for people riding bicycles or pedestrians before starting forward motion.\n\nStops over legal stop area.\n\nFailure to turn head before turning wheel.\n\nTurns wheel before starting forward motion.\n\nTurns into wrong lane.\n\nTravels in or cuts across the bike lane marked with a solid white line.\n\nTravels in on-street parking spaces.\n\nDefinitions\n\nBlind Spot: the area that is not visible to the driver without turning their head and looking.\n\nControlled Brake: firm, steady, even pressure on the brake pedal\n\nLight Acceleration: light pressure on the gas pedal.\n\nProper Procedures for Right Turns With a Required Stop\n\nSignal, check mirrors and blind spot. Check the right blind spot to move right and the left blind spot to move left.\n\nUse controlled braking and allow sufficient space on the right to avoid hitting the curb when turning, approximately 3 feet from the right edge of the roadway. Be careful not to drive in parking spaces or bike lanes.\n\nStop at the legal stop area and search the intersection for vehicles, pedestrians, people riding bicycles, and potential hazards. Be careful not to stop in a bike lane or parking space.\n\nBEFORE turning the wheel, turn your head in the direction you intend to travel.\n\nUse light acceleration and begin to turn when the dashboard is aligned with the curb.\n\nStraighten and use progressive acceleration to reach your targeted speed.\n\nCheck rearview mirror.\n\nRight Turns Without a Required Stop\n\nCommon Errors for Right Turns Without a Required Stop\n\nLate or no signal.\n\nConfusion on right-of-way, fails to yield.\n\nFailure to search intersection in all directions.\n\nFailure to search before turning wheel.\n\nTurns into wrong lane.\n\nAccelerates prematurely.\n\nFailure to yield to people riding bicycles going straight.\n\nProper Procedures for Right Turn Without a Required Stop\n\nSignal, check mirrors and blind spots. Check the right blind spot to move right.\n\nUse controlled braking in a position approximately 3 feet from curb, parked car, parking space or bike lane.\n\nSearch intersection in all directions for vehicles, pedestrians, people riding bicycles, and potential hazards.\n\nBEFORE turning the wheel, turn your head to the right. Yield to pedestrians and people riding bicycles.\n\nBegin the turn when the dashboard is aligned with the curb line.\n\nTrail brake until halfway through the turn.\n\nStraighten and use progressive acceleration to reach your targeted speed.\n\nCheck rearview mirror.\n\nDefinitions\n\nProgressive Acceleration: a steady increase in pressure on the gas pedal.\n\nTrail Brake: a slight decrease of pressure on the brake pedal.\n\nLeft Turns With a Required Stop\n\nCommon Errors for Left Turns With a Required Stop\n\nFailure to make a complete stop.\n\nStops over the legal stop point.\n\nStops too close to vehicle ahead.\n\nFailure to yield to pedestrians and people riding bicycles.\n\nCuts across the center yellow line when beginning or negotiating a left turn.\n\nProper Procedures for Left Turns With a Required Stop\n\nSignal you are turning left.\n\nUse controlled braking and approach in Lane Position 2.\n\nStop at the legal stop area, which is the stop line, pedestrian cross walk, or imaginary line extending from stop sign.\n\nSearch the intersection for vehicles, pedestrians, people riding bicycles, and potential hazards.\n\nBEFORE turning the steering wheel, turn your head in the direction of the turn.\n\nBegin turn when your line of sight (or view) to the center of your intended lane does not cut across the curb line.\n\nUse light acceleration and turn the steering wheel simultaneously.\n\nStraighten and use progressive acceleration to reach your targeted speed.\n\nCheck rearview mirror.\n\nLeft Turns Without a Required Stop\n\nCommon Errors for Left Turns Without a Required Stop\n\nConfusion on right of way.\n\nLate or no signal.\n\nFailure to check blind areas.\n\nForgets to search intersection for traffic, people riding bicycles, and pedestrians.\n\nToo much steering.\n\nLate steering recovery.\n\nTurns into incorrect lane.\n\nBrakes too hard.\n\nAccelerates too soon or too much.\n\nProper Procedures for Left Turns Without a Required Stop\n\nSignal, check mirrors and blind spot.\n\nUse controlled braking and use Lane Position 2.\n\nSearch the intersection for vehicles, pedestrians, people riding bicycles, and potential hazards.\n\nBEFORE turning the wheel, turn your head in the direction you intend to travel.\n\nBegin turning when the front bumper is even with the curb line.\n\nTurn into the nearest legal lane of travel.\n\nTrail brake until halfway through the turn.\n\nStraighten and use progressive acceleration to reach your targeted speed.\n\nCheck rearview mirror.\n\nDefinitions\n\nControlled Braking: firm, steady, even pressure on the brake pedal.\n\nLane Position 2: the left side of the lane.\n\nLight Acceleration: light pressure on the gas pedal.\n\nProgressive Acceleration: a steady increase in pressure on the gas pedal.\n\nBlind Spot: the area that is not visible to the driver without turning their head and looking.\n\nTrail Brake: a slight decrease of pressure on the brake pedal.\n\nBicycles on the Roadway\n\nObey speed limits. Excessive speed is a factor in a high number of crashes involving people riding bicycles.\n\nBe aware of how wide your car is and pass people riding bicycles carefully. If you pass a person riding a bicycle who is traveling in your lane of traffic and you are going over 35 mph, Oregon law requires that you pass at a distance that is sufficient to prevent contact if the person were to fall.\n\nDo not move your car into a bike lane to make a right turn. Check for people riding bicycles before making a turn across a bike lane.\n\nPeople riding bicycles can travel at high speeds, often as fast as other traffic. Don't assume there is more time to turn in front of a person riding a bicycle than in front of a car.\n\nThe Bike Box\n\nStop for the traffic signal behind the bike box.\n\nDon't stop on top of the bike box.\n\nNo right turns on red at these intersections.\n\nIf turning right on a green light, signal and check for and yield to cyclists to the right.\n\nThe color of the bike box may vary.\n\nFigure 10: Bike Box\n\nTop Arrow: Bike Box\n\nMiddle Arrow: Wait Here\n\nBottom Arrow: Bike Line\n\nPhoto: Graphic provided by City of Portland Bureau of Transportation\n\nRight Turns Across a Bike Lane\n\nGet as close as is practical to the right curb or edge of the road without interfering with pedestrians or people riding bicycles. A bicycle lane is considered the edge of the roadway. Do not move into a bicycle lane in preparation for a right turn. Always check for bicycles going straight in a bike lane and yield to them before making a right turn.\n\nTop Arrow: Bike Lane\n\nBottom Arrow: Parked Car\n\nFigure 11b: Right Turns\n\nINCORRECT:\n\nTop Arrow: Bike Lane\n\nBottom Arrow: Parked Car"
