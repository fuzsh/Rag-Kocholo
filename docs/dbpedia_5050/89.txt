I doubt this is possible, but wanted to ask just in case... Also, I did find this Q/A, but it's not the right solution for my situation (or I'm doing it wrong)...

I have a column of single lines of text (e.g. each div inside the column is white-space: no-wrap), and this column is 50% of the page's width... I can easily add overflow: hidden and text-decoration: ellipsis to get each line of text to truncate on the right-hand side, but I've been asked to make it truncate on the left (to cut-off the start of each line)...

The problem with solutions like using direction: rtl is that it causes all the lines that don't truncate to be right-aligned, and I need those to still be left-aligned... Is that possible?

Edit, to add example code:
