        "text": "Best Italian Restaurant\n\nBar Volpe\n\nWith about as many Italian restaurants in Boston as there are pasta types, sometimes it takes a big personality and bold flavor to break through all the noise. Food-TV star Karen Akunowicz is doing just that at Bar Volpe. The restaurant and pastificio is bursting with the colorful flair and attention to detail that the James Beard Award–winning chef is known for (case in point: a fun take on a caviar course that includes ricotta gnocchi with dollops of caviar, chives, and plenty of lemon butter). Regulars know not to skip the snacks — a.k.a. stuzzichini — such as fried ’nduja-and-mortadella-stuffed olives and fritti misti with a spicy Calabrian-pepper spread. 170 W. Broadway, Boston, MA 02127, barvolpe.com.\n\nBest Comeback\n\nHarkertown\n\nBoston lost many restaurants to COVID, but few closings caused more anguish for local foodies than the loss of Garrett Harker’s Kenmore Square trio: beloved brasserie Eastern Standard, New England seafood spot Island Creek Oyster Bar, and peerless speakeasy the Hawthorne. Thus the hallelujahs from food geeks, cocktail mavens, and Fenway bound fans alike when a reborn Eastern Standard and the Hawthorne-like Equal Measure opened less than a half-mile from the stomping grounds of their former incarnations. Who says you can’t go home again? 775 Beacon St., Boston, MA 02215, easternstandardboston.com; equalmeasurebos.com.\n\nBest Doughnuts\n\nBlackbird Doughnuts\n\nThis decadent doughnut shop has upped its game this year (which is impressive since its game was already one of the best in town) with the debut of chocolate and vanilla mini doughnut pops and “brioche babies” — or bite-size doughnut holes — in the inventive, indulgent flavors Blackbird is known for, including lavender-matcha and “Oreo sugar.” We’ll take a dozen, please. Multiple locations, blackbirddoughnuts.com.\n\nBest Burger\n\nSeamark Seafood & Cocktails\n\nMichael Schlow’s burger at the now-closed Radius showed Boston what’s possible between buns — and now it’s back again at his new Encore Boston Harbor endeavor. The juicy patty is a well-built reminder of the pinnacle of the craft, topped with sharp cheddar, crispy onion strings, and zingy horseradish sauce. 1 Broadway, Everett, MA 02149, seamarkencore.com.\n\nBest Dumplings\n\nDumpling Café\n\nKnown at this Chinatown mainstay as “mini juicy buns,” these soup dumplings are steamed-to-springy-perfection pouches of dough ready to spill molten pork broth into your spoon for slurping. Less dramatic yet equally delicious are chef Peter Wang’s Taiwan-style pan-fried dumplings featuring aromatic minced pork. 695 Washington St., Boston, MA 02111, dumplingcafe.com.\n\nBest Brunch\n\nWaverly Kitchen & Bar\n\nIt’s seven times the fun with brunch available daily (with some added decadence on the weekend), whether you’re feeling sweet (seasonal offerings like lemon curd and blueberry French toast) or savory (smoked-Gouda mac ’n’ cheese with biscuit crumbles and bacon). Fancy coffee cocktails help start the day strong, and a fireplace keeps things cozy. 231 Bunker Hill St., Boston, MA 02129, waverlycharlestown.com.\n\nBest Pizza\n\nCiao! Somerville\n\nAt this Green Line–adjacent sister restaurant of the beloved Ciao! Pizza and Pasta in Chelsea, it’s easier than ever to enjoy the cloud-like, charred-just-right crust expertly topped with, say, wood-fired fennel sausage. Just be sure to save room for dessert: in this case, pizza topped with mascarpone, bananas, strawberries, and Nutella. 688 Broadway, Somerville, MA 02144, ciao-somerville.com.\n\nBest Barbecue\n\nSweet Cheeks Q\n\nYou’d be forgiven for making a meal solely of giant, fluffy biscuits with honey butter and a selection or two from Sweet Cheeks’ lengthy bourbon and whiskey list. But then you’d miss the expertly smoked meats, from the sliced brisket to the heritage-breed pulled pork, at chef Tiffani Faison’s beloved barbecue outpost. Bring the family (kids love it here!) and try it all at this always-consistent destination in an ever-changing neighborhood. 1381 Boylston St., Boston, MA 02215, sweetcheeksq.com.\n\nBest Mac 'n' Cheese\n\nStillwater\n\nChef and restaurateur Sarah Wade’s mac ’n’ cheese is ultra-decadent, topped with pulled pork in molasses barbecue sauce and a sprinkling of Ritz crumbs. It’s creamy, it’s dreamy, and it checks two important culinary boxes at once: salty/sweet and smooth/crunchy. 120 Kingston St., Boston, MA 02111, stillwaterboston.com.\n\nBest Clam Chowder\n\nLegal Sea Foods\n\nIf it’s good enough to serve at each presidential inauguration, it’s good enough for us. Clam chowder is a dish nearly as old as Boston itself, and the Legal Sea Foods’ version — a rich combination of little neck clams, chunky potatoes, and salt pork — consistently represents the city well. Multiple locations, legalseafoods.com.\n\nBest Ice Cream\n\nToscanini’s\n\nThe week before Gus Rancatore opened the doors to his ice cream shop, Toscanini’s, in Central Square, he stood on the sidewalk just up Massachusetts Avenue in Harvard Square, surveying the landscape. It was 1981, a time in Boston when Rancatore says there were a “comical number of ice cream stores,” from the hallowed Bailey’s downtown and iconic Steve’s in Davis Square to the small local chain Brigham’s. That day in Cambridge, it was winter — and snowing. “I looked to my left, and I looked to my right, and people were everywhere eating ice cream cones,” Rancatore remembers. “I thought to myself, This will probably work out.” Continue reading ... Cambridge, tosci.com.\n\nBest Lobster Roll\n\nSaltie Girl\n\nThe secret is out: Saltie Girl’s off-menu fried-lobster roll is a winner. Tail, knuckle, and claw meat is spiced up with Korean chili flakes, dressed with sweet-corn butter and beurre blanc, and served on a bun that’s buttered and toasted just right. 279 Dartmouth St., Boston, MA 02116, saltiegirl.com.\n\nBest Neighborhood Restaurant, Jamaica Plain\n\nTonino\n\nAfter honing his culinary dexterity at local hot spots such as Sarma and Giulia, Luke Fetbroth is reimagining the Italian-American comfort food of his childhood at Tonino, where he is both chef and co-owner. That translates to light-as-air tomato-pie slabs, Taleggio-and-balsamic-stuffed cappelletti, and ethereal tiramisu served by the massive bowlful. 669A Centre St., Jamaica Plain, MA 02130, toninojp.com.\n\nBest Neighborhood Restaurant, South Boston\n\nMoonshine 152\n\nWhether you’re tucking into the Ron Swanson–inspired scallion-pancake quesadilla with pulled pork or the over the-top monthly burger special, chef Asia Mei’s cozy Southie joint is certain to wrap you in a warm, comfort-food-filled hug. Bonus points for the Jell-O shot of the moment. 152 Dorchester Ave., Boston, MA 02127, moonshine152.com.\n\nBest Restaurant in a Hotel\n\nCoquette\n\nBoston hotel restaurants are usually staid affairs, but the Omni Boston Hotel at the Seaport broke the mold with its opulent stunner Coquette, particularly after a 2023 culinary revamp from coastal French to broader Mediterranean. The gorgeous room echoes the hip, nightclubby vibe of other spots from COJE Management Group, including Yvonne’s and Mariel. And with superb cocktails and a crowd-pleasing, highly shareable menu, it’s little wonder that Coquette has emerged as an “it” place for girls’ nights out, dress-to-impress dates, and extravagant business entertaining. 450 Summer St., Boston, MA 02210, coquetteboston.com.\n\nBest Burrito\n\nChilacates\n\nChilacates’ burritos are fresh, authentic, and reliably comforting every single time. The kitchen starts with some seriously generous portions (plenty to save in the fridge for your next meal, trust us.) Then there are the proteins — 12 to choose from, including birria, grilled shrimp, and chorizo, as well as vegetarian options and a breakfast burrito — plus countless sauces and toppings. And unlike most so-called destination burritos out there, with 11 locations, Chilacates is a destination that’s probably pretty easy to get to. Multiple locations, chilacatesmx.com.\n\nBest Fried Chicken\n\nHemlock Grill\n\nEating well with a view of a sunny fairway usually requires a tony country club membership. But even non-golfers are welcome at the unassuming 19th hole at Brookline’s proletarian Putterham public links. Here, chef Alex Sáenz plates Boston’s crunchiest, juiciest fried chicken, with bolder duffers opting for his searing, vivid-red “Nashville Hot” style. 1281 West Roxbury Pkwy., Brookline, MA 02467, hemlockgrill.com.\n\nBest Meatball\n\nTable\n\nThe bright, San Marzano–based marinara enveloping Table’s generously sized beef, pork, and veal meatballs makes every season feel like tomato season. And that’s not the only reason to celebrate at this restaurant, where every meal feels like a dinner party thanks to the communal seating and family-style platters of food you’ll share with your group. 445 Hanover St., Boston, MA 02113, tableboston.com.\n\nBest Bagel\n\nCafé Fresh Bagel\n\nA great bagel does three things well: texture, flavor, and shape. And this longtime takeout favorite nails them all. A glossy, crackly crust with a slight chewiness gives way to an interior with plenty of “pull” to it. A hint of sweetness balances any savory toppings you might add (think: lox; chicken salad; or bacon, egg, and cheese), and a perfectly sized middle makes for even toasting and plenty of room for one of nine available flavored cream cheeses. Add a large iced coffee, and every morning is yours for the taking. 896 Highland Ave., Needham, MA 02494, .\n\nBest Bakery\n\nYafa Bakery & Café\n\nWhile you’re at Yafa Bakery & Café, you’re sure to encounter the following things: An assortment of delicate pastries and fresh breads; rows upon rows of date-based confections; and owner Abdulla Awad’s megawatt smile. The flavors and baking styles are inspired by Awad’s Palestinian upbringing and cuisines from elsewhere in the Middle East — as evidenced by the addition of ingredients such as orange blossom, rose petals, pistachio, and more. Don’t forget a cup of fresh-squeezed minty lemonada. 594 Somerville Ave., Somerville, MA 02143, yafabakerycafe.com.\n\nBest Chocolate\n\nChocolate Therapy\n\nWe’re not exactly advocating eating your feelings…but when the treats come from Chocolate Therapy, it might not be the worst idea in the world. Thirteen years ago, owners Pam and David Griffin left corporate America to try their hand at chocolate-making — and the results speak for themselves. The couple recently relocated their shop to Wayland and keeps the cases stocked with row upon row of bonbons in unique flavor combos (London Fog, Key lime, French toast) that are as beautiful as they are utterly delicious. 63 Andrew Ave., Wayland, MA 01778, thechocolatetherapystore.com.\n\nBest Dinner and a Show\n\nGrace by Nia\n\nDressed-to-impress crowds come to this sleek supper club for the elaborate cocktails and soulful southern-inspired fare, including fried green tomatoes with fresh mozz and bourbon-peach spare ribs. They stay for the music — live jazz acts tinged with soul, R&B, hip-hop, and reggae — in a glamorous space. 60 Seaport Blvd., Thrid Floor, Boston, MA 02210, gracebynia.com.\n\nBest Fancy Dessert Spot\n\nZuzu’s Petals\n\nThis romantic wine and dessert bar is delightfully screen-free — but even without your iPhone camera, the memory is sure to last. The Earl Grey–infused dark-chocolate mousse and the tonka-bean crème brûlée are the ultimate shareable treats, especially with an intriguing glass of red wine. 204 Hampshire St., Cambridge, MA 02139, zuzuspetalscambridge.com.\n\nBest Swanky Tasting Menu\n\nLenox Sophia\n\nChef-owner Shi Mei’s intimate restaurant wows over a journey through five courses, described so simply on the menu that the explosion of flavor surprises and delights each time a new plate arrives (see: the “rice and peas” with crawfish and spring veggies). 87 A St., Boston, MA 02127, lenoxsophia.com.\n\nBest Date Night\n\nUrban Wild\n\nCome for the bowling alley, music venue, beer garden, and more at this new Charlestown hang. Stay for the cooler-sized fruity cocktails, heaping plates of saucy popcorn chicken, and foot-long mozzarella sticks, all of which practically guarantee a good time. 100 D Hood Park Dr., Boston, MA 02129, urbanwildboston.com.\n\nBest East African Restaurant\n\nFasika Café\n\nThis Ethiopian eatery is a homey stop for breakfast, lunch, or dinner on a prominent corner of Nubian Square. That’s thanks to the stewardship of owner Befekadu Defar and his family, who serve robust Ethiopian coffee and prepare traditional dishes like tender beef, lamb, and sun-hued vegetarian stews served sans silverware with a pile of springy injera to swipe it all up. The lentil- or beef-filled sambusas, meanwhile, are fried finger food at its finest. 51 Roxbury St., Roxbury , MA 02119, fasikaresturaunts.com.\n\nBest Neighborhood Restaurant, Chinatown\n\nTaiwan Café\n\nTaiwanese cuisine embraces flavors from Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Sichuan — hence the versatility and enduring popularity of this cheery spot. Even rookies to Chinatown’s food scene can safely skip the General here in favor of beautifully rendered traditional dishes like scallion-pancake rolls with roast beef, Taiwan-style pan-fried dumplings, sautéed littlenecks with basil, and beef noodle soup. 34 Oxford St., Boston, MA 02111, ordertaiwancafe.com.\n\nBest Neighborhood Restaurant, Dorchester\n\nComfort Kitchen\n\nThe dining scene in Boston’s largest neighborhood didn’t always reflect the area’s diversity — that is, until Comfort Kitchen came along. The restaurant at the intersection of Caribbean, African, Asian, and American soul-food cuisines offers everything from jackfruit sliders and harissa-date chicken bowls from the afternoon café to occasion-worthy plates (think: jerk-roasted duck leg with rice and peas) and Sumac Sour cocktails come dinnertime. 611 Columbia Rd., Dorchester, MA 02125, comfortkitchenbos.com.\n\nBest Neighborhood Restaurant, Charlestown\n\nPrima\n\nFresh breads and cheeses, jumbo steaks, and big-as-your-face chicken Parm have helped this City Square newcomer carve its own niche among the city’s abundant Italian steakhouses. The elegant design doesn’t hurt, especially the pink-and-red “Rose Room” in the back — book that Valentine’s Day reservation ASAP. 10 City Sq., Boston, MA 02129, primaboston.com.\n\nBest Neighborhood Restaurant, East Boston\n\nAngela’s Café\n\nLocals flock to both Eastie locations of this Mexican favorite for crowd-pleasers such as fresh, high-quality guacamole, ceviches, tacos, and burritos. But the best reasons to visit are the rare in-Boston flavors of Puebla, seen in the menu’s rajas poblanas (shredded peppers with sour cream and queso fresco), Adobo-marinated tacos arabes, and dishes sauced with ravishingly complex moles, pipiáns, and tingas. East Boston, angelascafeboston.com.\n\nBest Neighborhood Restaurant, Seaport\n\nHook + Line\n\nThis new arrival from restaurateur Tom Schlesinger-Guidelli is a sprawling temple to New England seafood (with an adjacent market) that buoys our hopes for a Seaport that’s more Boston than not. Wood-grilled fish dishes are the star of the show here, but don’t miss local classics like lobster rolls and fried Ipswich clams. 10 Fan Pier, Boston, MA 02210, hookandlinebos.com.\n\nBest Neighborhood Restaurant, Beacon Hill\n\nMa Maison\n\nAs Boston’s longest tenured French chef-owner, Jacky Robert still shines at this bustling bistro. His menu offers a superb greatest-hits-of-Paris playlist — escargots, seared foie gras, onion soup, coq au vin, veals, sweetbreads, and nice-priced French wines — that will have you humming “La Vie en Rose” all the way home. 272 Cambridge St., Boston, MA 02114, mamaisonboston.com.\n\nBest Neighborhood Restaurant, North End\n\nThe Daily Catch\n\nAround in one form or another for more than 50 years, this neighborhood staple still draws lines daily for its hearty portions of Sicilian-inspired seafood and pasta, served in hefty pans rather than plates. The fresh squid-ink linguine is a must, especially with the ground calamari-and-anchovy filled aglio olio topping. 323 Hanover St., Boston, MA 02113, thedailycatch.com.\n\nBest Neighborhood Restaurant, Downtown\n\nBoston Chops\n\nThanks to a few hip newcomers, scrappy Downtown Crossing is having a moment. If you ask us, that’s even more reason to celebrate this luxe steakhouse, which remains a neighborhood favorite after six years. The restaurant is where businessfolk with expense accounts can summon Japanese Wagyu and trophy bottles of Burgundy while the rest of us enjoy modestly priced prime steak frites, melt-in-your-mouth popovers, and excellent cocktails. 52 Temple Place, Boston, MA 02111, bostonchops.com.\n\nBest Steakhouse\n\nGrill 23 & Bar\n\nChris Himmel’s earliest memories involve running around the dining room at Grill 23 & Bar, the stately Back Bay steakhouse that celebrated its 40th anniversary last year. The second-generation owner was five when the restaurant opened; 20 years later, he assumed control of the day-to-day operations, and nowadays is president of the entire Himmel Hospitality Group, which also includes Harvest, Bistro du Midi, and the Banks Fish House. Continue reading ... 161 Berkeley St., Boston, MA 02116, grill23.com.\n\nBest Wine Bar\n\nGray’s Hall\n\nThe low-key vibe at this natural wine bar is matched by approachable menu items like Big Mac–style cheeseburgers and some of the city’s best arancini, plus friendly, down-to-earth servers who’ll chat you up about pét-nat and rare Greek grape varietals while lo-fi ’90s rap plays over the speakers. 615 East Broadway, Boston, MA 02127, grayshall.com.\n\nBest Cocktail Bar\n\nGood Company\n\nFermented garlic honey, salsa verde oil, whey, and carrot soda might not sound like cocktail ingredients. But at Charlestown newbie Good Company, owner and industry vet Seth Freidus embraces a “farm-to-glass” concept that yields unique, and uniquely tasty, beverages. (The less adventurous can find comfort in solid renditions of mules, G&Ts, and the like.) 100 Hood Park Dr., Boston, MA 02129, goodcompanyboston.com.\n\nBest Afternoon Tea\n\nSilver Dove Afternoon Tea\n\nIs afternoon tea the new three-martini lunch? Thanks to Silver Dove, which opened last year downtown, it just might be. Everything about this impeccable British-style tea service is at once cozy and oh-so-civilized, from the savory and sweet finger foods to the rose-studded entryway wall and green velvet banquettes. 24 Tremont St., Boston, MA 02108, silverdovetea.com.\n\nBest Coffee Shop\n\nMadhouse Café\n\nThis hip Roxbury coffee shop attached to a custom motorcycle garage is the place where mocha lattes and motors come together. Sip on a sweet tahini latte and enjoy Lebanese handpies while watching mechanics at work through the giant window connecting the spaces. 24 Blue Hill Ave., Boston, MA 02119, madhousecafe.com.\n\nBest Gourmet Grocer\n\nEBO & Co. Grocery\n\nBoston native Alexis Cervasio created a haven for seafood lovers in Eastie when she opened EBO & Co. Grocery in 2021, named after her popular roving dining experience, East Boston Oysters. The shop carries everything you’d find at her pop-ups, from fresh oysters to bottles of funky natural wine to locally made condiments like Buenas chimichurri — and so much more. Looking for recipe inspiration? Head downstairs to Over the Tunnel Books, Cervasio’s tiny new bookstore, packed with cookbooks, food magazines, and complimentary self-serve espresso. 110 Meridian St, Boston, MA 02128, ebogrocery.com.\n\nBest Restaurant, General Excellence\n\nSarma\n\nIsn’t pan-Mediterranean mezze pretty much everywhere these days, you ask? Why, yes it is — but chef-owner Cassie Piuma’s free wheeling ethos produces something above and beyond that (see: her avocado muhummara and basturma bánh mì). You’ll understand the many award nods and accolades once you soak up Sarma’s lively yet chill vibe, listen to its erudite, earnest servers, and navigate your own euphoric jaunt across a dozen distinct culinary traditions. 249 Pearl St., Somerville, MA 02145, sarmarestaurant.com.\n\nBest Chef's Counter\n\nUrban Hearth\n\nThe four-seat chef’s counter offers a front-row seat to the culinary ballet performed seamlessly by chef Erin Miller and her team, who weave together an adventurous tasting menu from the freshest seasonal ingredients in the tiniest of kitchens. Here, it’s high-end dining sans snobbery — while dishes are plated to tweezered perfection, the vibe is alway sconvivial and warm. 2263 Massachusetts Ave. , Cambridge, MA 02140, urbanhearth.net.\n\nBest Restaurant with a View\n\nContessa\n\nSeventeen stories up, diners are wowed by the city skyline all around and the Public Garden and the Common below at this Italian destination crowning the Newbury Boston hotel in the Back Bay, where reservations haven’t gotten any easier to come by since its 2021 debut. Inside is equally breathtaking: Patrons dress to impress — or to pose for the ’gram — amid Contessa’s elegant décor, from colorful tiles to velvety seating. Add a plate of spicy capellini with lobster or a hefty Florentine-style steak for two — magnifico! 3 Newbury St., Boston, MA 02116, contessaristorante.com.\n\nBest Food Hall\n\nHigh Street Place\n\nThis atrium food hall in the Financial District makes a strong case for returning to the office — or, better yet, converting those underused buildings into more housing. But even if you don’t live or work downtown, it’s worth stopping by for one of the city’s best cocktail bars (Daiquiris & Daisies), craveable quick bites like Mike & Patty’s breakfast sandwiches, and globetrotting chef Tiffani Faison’s take on both lobster rolls and pepperoni pizza. 100 High St., Boston, MA 02110, highstreetplace.com.\n\nBest Portuguese Restaurant\n\nBaleia\n\nLike spotting a majestic marine mammal in the ocean, it’s relatively rare to find modern Portuguese cuisine in Boston, but this year in particular, chefs throughout the city have been making salt cod cool again — particularly this restaurant from the team behind SRV, Gufo, and the Salty Pig. Named after the Portuguese word for “whale,” Baleia is ably and excitingly spotlighting the country’s ingredients and style, from spritzy drinks made with white port wine to grilled sardines and smoky homemade chouriço sausage. 264 E. Berkeley St., Boston, MA 02118, baleiaboston.com.\n\nBest Restaurant with a Side of Learning\n\nLehrhaus\n\nWhere else can you listen to Yiddish folklore with a soundtrack of live klezmer music while dining on mac-and-cheese kugel? This self-described “tavern and house of learning,” which grabbed national attention with its splashy 2023 opening, offers a unique blend of educational opportunities and excellent food. Order up dishes inspired by the Jewish diaspora, from herring tartine to chopped “not liver” made with eggplants and nuts, while surrounded by Jewish texts old and new — and don’t forget to pop in for a class. 425 Washington St., Somerville, MA 02143, lehr.haus.\n\nBest Pop-up\n\nGaaeng\n\nAmong the most coveted reservations in town right now, Gaaeng’s intimate pop-up supper clubs take diners on a deep, flavor-packed dive into oft-obscure Thai recipes from lesser-known regions or eras past. Strangers become friends over these communal, hands-on meals as they eagerly scoop up dishes like deep-fried soft-shell crab dumplings or spicy pork-jowl salad. At some events, collabs with local bartenders up the ante with creative cocktail pairings. Various locations, .\n\nBest Irish Pub\n\nThe Dubliner\n\nBuoyed by a fervidly proud Irish-American population, Boston boasts many fine pubs serving good Irish whiskey and proper Guinness pints. Quality Irish cuisine? Not so much — at least not until Donegal native Aidan McGee (who cut his teeth at multiple Michelin-starred restaurants in the U.K.) debuted the Dubliner opposite Government Center. Here, he brings Irish fare closer to acclaimed Dublin levels with stellar fish and chips, traditional Sunday roasts, and an unmatched Irish whiskey selection. 2 Center Plaza, Boston, MA 02108, thedublinerboston.com.\n\nBest Jamaican Restaurant\n\nJamaica Mi Hungry\n\nThere’s no weak link on the menu at this Jackson Square favorite, which celebrates its fifth anniversary this year: Simple sides like curry vegetable stew or sweet plantains shine just as bright as the headliners, from hearty beef ribs to the fiery jerk chicken that nods to chef and owner Ernie Campbell’s native Jamaica. Don’t miss the crispy coconut shrimp with sweet-spicy dipping sauce — a crowd-pleaser for kids and grownups alike. 225 Centre St., Jamaica Plain, MA 02131, jamaicamihungry.com.\n\nBest Indian Restaurant\n\nHimalayan Bistro\n\nBoston’s South Asian food scene has exploded over the past two decades thanks to pioneers like Himalayan Bistro, which introduced Nepali cuisine here in 2006. Nearly 20 years later, this sparse, serene West Roxbury stalwart is still slinging an eclectic array of complexly spiced dishes from across the subcontinent, from the kormas ofthe ancient Mughals to the saags of the Punjab to the khukhuras of Kathmandu. Bring an appetite and friends, and order plenty of the sublime naan. 1735 Centre St., West Roxbury, MA 02132, himalayanbistro.net.\n\nBest West African Restaurant\n\nSuya Joint\n\nCecelia Lizotte, a 2024 James Beard Award semifinalist, is busy expanding Suya Joint to Providence this year. But lucky for us, the bustling West African restaurant continues to wow crowds in Nubian Square, showcasing cuisine from Nigeria and the broader region. Start your meal with the namesake suya — spiced grilled beef skewers — but save room for a heaping portion of the Nigerian stew egusi, made from ground pumpkin seeds and spinach. 185 Dudley St., Boston, MA 02119, suyajoint.com.\n\nBest Reason to Wait in a Really Long Line\n\nNeptune Oyster\n\nA true Boston experience for locals and tourists alike? Braving the Neptune Oyster line. In any weather, at any time of day, a queue of seafood lovers continues to snake down Salem Street, waiting to cozy up inside the small, packed restaurant — celebrating its 20th anniversary this year! — for a taste of the acclaimed lobster roll, hot with butter or cold with mayo. Those in the know venture onto other parts of the menu, too, enjoying delicate crudos, raw-bar classics, and caviar- and smoked-bluefish-topped johnnycakes. 63 Salem St., Boston, MA 02113, neptuneoyster.com.\n\nBest French Restaurant\n\nDW French\n\nAt this shiny Fenway newcomer, chef Douglass Williams (of Mida fame) focuses on giving the people exactly what they want — and what they want, it seems, is tender steak with unlimited frites and a nice glass of Bordeaux. In fact, everything on the menu of French classics — from escargot and moules frites to trout almondine — is très bon. 1391 Boylston St., Boston, MA 02215, dwfrench.com.\n\nBest Thai Restaurant\n\nMahaniyom\n\nBring a big group to this Brookline Village hot spot — you’ll want plenty of friends to share with as you order up bowls of nang kai tod (crispy chicken skin), warming kang pu (crab curry), and a unique green papaya pad thai. Wash it down with a cocktail (or three) highlighting Southeast Asian flavors — we love the Sazerac with Thai tea–infused rye — before heading down the street for more snacks at little sibling Merai, which is slated to open this year. 236 Washington St., Brookline, MA 02445, mahaniyomboston.com.\n\nBest Mexican Restaurant\n\nSabina Mezcaleria\n\nThe city’s first mezcaleria serves up nearly two dozen varieties of the Mexican liquor — but make no mistake, the food menu is just as robust (and delicious). With gourmet tapas such as spicy ceviche, smoked-fish-and-Oaxaca-cheese quesadillas, and blue-corn-tortilla taco stopped with crispy soft-shell crab, it’s no wonder weekend reservations fill up fast. 253 Newbury St., Boston, MA 02116, sabinamezcaleria.com.\n\nBest Sushi Restaurant\n\nUni\n\nWhy go to Japan for sushi when Uni sushi chef Tsuyoshi “Take” Takeishi can bring the freshest Japanese fish straight to you? Pull up one of four barstools reserved every Thursday night at Uni for the new Edomae-style omakase tasting experience, and across 20 courses and two hours, Takeishi will prepare and serve you exceptional seasonal bites, stopping only to show you on his tablet some of the unfamiliar seafood — striped beakfish, broadbanded thornyhead, purple sea urchin from Nagasaki — that makes every bite worth swooning over. 370A Commonwealth Ave., Boston, MA 02115, uni-boston.com.\n\nBest Vegan Restaurant\n\nLulu Green\n\nYou don’t have to be a vegan to love the food at Lulu Green. From the “cheese” on the mezze menu that will make you gasp,“I can’t believe it’s not Brie” to the succulent seitan tacos al pastor, each dish will leave you with the feeling that nothing is lost when the animals are left in the field and off the menu. 246 W. Broadway, Boston, MA 02127, lulugreen.com.\n\nBest Seafood\n\nMoëca\n\nThe décor at this neighborhood spot maybe deep blue and gray like the New England sea, but the seafood dishes here are filled with influences from distant shores — an Italian semolina gnocchi, a Thai-inspired yellowfin tuna crudo, and a buttermilk deep-fried monkfish that puts southern-fried chicken to shame. 1 Shepard St., Cambridge, MA 02138, moecarestaurant.com.\n\nBest Farm-to-Table Restaurant\n\nField & Vine\n\nOptimal conditions for growing a neighborhood restaurant include relaxed hospitality and an always-surprising menu. Field & Vine has both by the barrowful. Bright flavors and earthy elements are highlighted in seasonal dishes such as tuna carpaccio with caramelized pistachios, and grilled duck breast with pipián rojo, a creamy sauce made of pumpkin seeds and spices. Add in grower-made wines and a setting that recalls a fairy hideaway, and it’s no surprise that this talented team — cultivated by married couple Sara Markey and Andrew Brady — has branched out with two additional restaurants, June Bug and Dear Annie. 9 Sanborn Ct., Somerville, MA 02143, fieldandvinesomerville.com.\n\nBest Greek Restaurant\n\nBar Vlaha\n\nHungry Hellenophiles won’t find the traditional gyro and grilled octopus at this festive Greek restaurant, now in its second year and as busy as ever. Instead, they can expect a hearty menu inspired by the Vlach communities of northern Greece. That translates to flaky phyllo pies (including one with cornmeal, wild greens, and feta), rustic platters of charcoal-grilled meat, and other traditional dishes served up by acclaimed chef Brendan Pelley. Add a glass of Greek wine or a funky cocktail, and it’s dinner at yiayia’s house with an upscale spin. 1653 Beacon St., Brookline, MA 02445, barvlaha.com.\n\nBest South American Restaurant\n\nCeleste\n\nThe bandbox of a space, with 18 seats at banquettes and six at the bar, charmed us. The delectable menu embracing Peru’s seafood bounty and cornucopia of chilies, maizes, potatoes, and tomatoes tantalized our tastebuds. But it was the two patios — the sociable sidewalk out front, and the secluded, romantic one on the side — that made us absolutely fall in love with Celeste. 21 Bow St., Somerville, MA 02143, celesteunionsquare.com.\n\nBest Spanish Restaurant\n\nTaberna de Haro\n\nChef-owner Deborah Hansen opened this paragon of tapas as a tiny storefront more than 25 years ago, eventually expanding with the adjacent Straight Law bar and a popular sidewalk patio. Along the way, she built the city’s most expansive, award-winning Spanish wine and sherry lists. As she glides into semi-retirement, we’re beyond thrilled that brand-new owner and Boston hospitality stalwart Kristie Weiss (formerly of Haley.Henry and Nathálie) is keeping both Hansen’s beloved Spanish menu and Hansen herself onboard as wine manager. 999 Beacon St., Brookline, MA 02446, tabernaboston.com.\n\nBest Chinese Restaurant\n\nSzechuan Mountain House\n\nFiery Sichuan specialties abound at this swanky New York import, which has been drawing huge crowds to Allston since its late 2023 debut. The menu doesn’t shy away from ingredients that may be less familiar to American palates, from a dish of blood curd, tripe, and intestine in spicy chili-oil broth to braised frog meat in sour, spicy soup. But tried-and-true favorites like mapo tofu and peppercorn beef are just as delicious. Cool down with the can’t-stop-snacking salted-egg-yolk corn. 89 Brighton Ave., Retail A, Boston, MA 02134, szechuanmountainhouse.com.\n\nBest Middle Eastern Restaurant\n\nBab Al-Yemen\n\nBoston needs more occasion-worthy Middle Eastern restaurants, so the 2022 arrival of this pretty Yemeni spot was especially welcome. Its lower-level dining room evokes the colors of the modern San’a skyline, while the homey yet plush first floor offers both Western seating and traditional Yemeni dining on low tables and floor cushions. It’s a lovely and atmospheric setting for the halal delights of Yemeni cuisine: enormous flatbreads, airy legume spreads, and hearty lamb stews and roasts. 468 Commonwealth Ave., Boston, MA 02215, babalyemenboston.com.\n\nBest Vietnamese Restaurant\n\nThe Eaves\n\nTalk about a hidden gem: This tiny restaurant and cocktail bar from the Cicada team is tucked inside a former storage space at Somerville’s Bow Market. While the debut last year was quiet, the experience of dining here is anything but thanks to dishes that blend chef and co-owner Vincenzo Le’s life experience in Vietnam and New England (duck-confit dumplings; fluke tartare with lemongrass). A soundtrack that bops from disco to Asian pop to 1960s French ballads adds to the fusion-y vibe. 1 Bow Market Way, Somerville, MA 02143, no website.\n\nBest Puerto Rican Restaurant\n\nVejigantes\n\nThe chuleta kan kan certainly makes a dazzling impression at this vibrant spot from longtime Boston restaurateurs Hector and Nivia Pina: Sourced directly from Puerto Rico, the succulent 18-ounce bone-in pork loin chop is served with the belly and crispy skin still attached. But really, anything on the menu, from classic mofongos (mashed plantain or cassava with meat inside) to house-special paellas, is worth trying. The extensive list of fun cocktails garnished with fresh flowers, umbrellas, and mini bottles of champagne, meanwhile, practically guarantees a good time. 57 W Dedham St., Boston, MA 02118, vejigantesrestaurant.com.\n\nBest Power Lunch\n\nAbe & Louie’s\n\nThis old-school steakhouse in the heart of the Back Bay is a testament to the power of dark wood and mouthwatering meat when it comes to making a deal over the midday meal. With caviar, Wagyu, and a signature seafood tower on the afternoon menu (plus sandwiches and salads for the slightly less indulgent), the city’s movers and shakers consistently rely on Abe & Louie’s to impress whatever VIPs they’re wining and dining over lunch. 793 Boylston St., Boston, MA 02116, abeandlouies.com.\n\nBest Multi-Location Maestro\n\nDavio’s Northern Italian Steakhouse\n\nIt’s time to stop calling Davio’s a “chain” (a term proprietor Steve DiFillippo has said is “a knife in my heart.”) With all 11 locations still fully owned by him and his family, diners universally acknowledge that the Italian steakhouse has long been a local landmark woven into the region’s tapestry, a place where the staff treats you like family and the signature meatballs and mouthwatering steaks are cooked to perfection every time. Consistency and service, be thy name. Multiple locations, davios.com.\n\nBest High-Roller Spot\n\nRare Lounge\n\nLooking to celebrate your newfound winnings but not quite in the mood for the full-on steakhouse experience at Encore’s Rare? Then the similarly named lounge right next door is a sure-fire bet. After all, the onion dip is topped with caviar, the asparagus is “jumbo,” and the cocktails have names like Lucky Streak and You Only Live Twice. Oh, and if you’re looking for a $225 bourbon (23-year-old Pappy Van Winkle) or a $800 dram of rye (WhistlePig Boss Hog II), consider this your new home away from home. 1 Broadway, First Floor, Everett, MA 02149, encorebostonharbor.com.\n\nBest New Restaurant\n\nLa Padrona\n\nYes, it’s practically brand-new, but — alacazam, alacazoo! — renowned chef Jody Adams and her prolific business partners, Eric Papachristos and Jon Mendez, have already conjured a breathtaking Italian restaurant inside the luxurious Raffles Boston hotel. Start with drinks downstairs before ascending the eye-popping staircase into a dazzling brown-and-gold-toned dining room with a showstopper of a bar in the center. And with Adams’s food on display, you’ll likely agree she and her partners have taken the promise of an empty shell just off Stuart Street and turned it into the dreamiest of dining experiences. 38 Trinity Pl., Boston, MA 02116, lapadronaboston.com.\n\nBest Place to Spot an Out-of-Town Celeb\n\nStrega by Nick Varano\n\nEven celebrities need to eat when they’re in Boston, and nobody — we mean nobody — packs ’em in like North End restaurateur Nick Varano. Want to catch a glimpse of Ed Sheeran, Mariah Carey, or Pedro Martínez? To say nothing of Celtics super-fan Donnie Wahlberg or the Celtics themselves, including Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum? There’s literally only one place to go. (Stargazing tip: Book a table before or after TD Garden events, especially when a VIP is in town.) 379 Hanover St., Boston, MA 02113, stregabynickvarano.com."
