Rani has performed her unique blend of jazz, funk, and ukulele soul all over the Pacific Northwest, Midwest, East Coast, and India. She is an endorsed artist with Lanikai Ukuleles, and a member of 4Culture’s Touring Arts Roster. Champagne Honeybee has released 2 EPs of original music, and has a full-length studio album in the works.\n\nchampagnehoneybee.com\n\nNajamoniq Todd is a rare breed of integrative artist that draws bridges between worlds. A singer rooted in the rich soil of gospel, jazz and blues, she blends fundamentals into her own musical fabric. Backed by homespun house beats and distorted guitars she delivers indie-soul anthems about freedom and self-love, inspiring her audience to dance it off, dream big and heal by overcoming obstacles and swerving on haters. When she’s not instigating dance parties she is crushing the business world as owner & CEO of her own beauty salon, Mirror Ready Glam, while settling the score on outmoded beauty standards as a plus-size model in her spare time. She lives with her partner and musical collaborator, Tony Jones in Tacoma.\n\nGenre bending-blending singer/songwriter/guitarist Cyd Smith is hard to pin down. An accomplished guitarist and stellar vocalist with years of experience performing in the Northwest, she can deliver a self-penned song with depth and charm or give new meaning to a vintage swing standard. Or perhaps she’ll get your feet tapping to a ripping guitar arrangement of an old piano rag or heat up the room with a classic blues ballad.\n\nFrom her first open-mic performances at the O.K. Hotel in Seattle, Washington to her performances at Benaroya Hall, J.R. Rhodes’ belief in the transformative power of music are distilled into songs of quiet intensity that traverse spirituals, folk, blues, jazz, and rock.\n\nMs. Rhodes is currently working on two new albums. One recording is a folk album including music inspired by the lives, works and wisdoms of women of colour including Alice Walker, Nikki Giovanni, Elizabeth Cotten and more. The other recording is a collection of songs of African-American heritage including spirituals, slave songs and lullabies. Ms. Rhodes is also currently expanding her music business to include a philanthropic aspect focusing on uplifting girls and women of colour by creating and sharing community outreach events and workshops around health & well being including mental health as well as financial wellness.\n\njrrhodesco.com\n\nDate And Time\n\nShare With Friends"
