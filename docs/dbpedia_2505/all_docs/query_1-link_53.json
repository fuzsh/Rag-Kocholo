        "text": "Moab Folk Camp 2024 Instructors\n\nCara Luft\n\n​Cara Luft is an award-winning musician, singer and songwriter, a plucky performer with an impish sense of humour and a founding member of two Canadian folk super-groups: The Wailin' Jennys and The Small Glories. Brought up by folk-singing parents in a vibrant music community, Luft has a spirit that drives her to connect with people, and for this she is loved everywhere she goes. She is one of Canada's hardest working musicians, armed with amazing tenacity, vision, energy and a contagious hilarity. In 2011 she branched out into instructing at music camps for adults and teens, discovering an immense joy and skill in helping others tap into their own creativity. Cara’s the real deal, there’s nothing pretentious about her. And that sense of honesty, integrity, personality and spontaneity permeates both her music and her live shows. www.caraluft.com\n\nNina Gerber\n\nSince her accompaniment of Kate Wolf first earned her recognition, Nina Gerber's acute skills as performer, producer and arranger have continued to deepen. Her contributions to acoustic music have earned her a following as loyal as for the numerous high talents she has accompanied - proving the shadows equal to the spotlight in the creation of honest, powerful, and beautiful music. Nina has a unique ability to completely free herself within an eclectic range of styles. Presented with folk, country, bluegrass, rock, or blues, she is able to fall into leads which have rare reverence for the true feeling of a song, always emphasizing taste over technical display. She seeks to express through her hands, rather than gain attention, and it is this integrity which makes her expressions worth intent listening.\n\nAbbie Gardner\n\nBest known as a founding member of Americana harmony trio Red Molly, Abbie Gardner is a joyful dobro player and singer/songwriter with an infectious smile. She loves teaching dobro and songwriting, whether in person or with her down-to-earth “Woodshed” YouTube lessons filmed from her home in the shadow of New York City. Abbie goes out of her way to make it fun and achievable, while seeking to forever expand her own knowledge.\n\nAbbie has taught dobro at Nashville Dobro Camp, Grand Targhee, ResoSummit and Rockygrass Academy. She specializes in singing while playing, dobro as a rhythm instrument, treating musician’s injuries (as an Occupational Therapist) and creating lyrical solos in G tuning or D tuning. On the songwriting side, Abbie has taught at Swannanoa Gathering, Summer Songs, and New England Songwriter’s Retreat; as well as running her own Zoom writing classes seasonally since April 2020. She’s endlessly fascinated by music, so there are no dumb questions in her classes!\n\nLewis Mock\n\nLewis Mock is a multi-instrumentalist/vocalist who began performing professionally at eight years of age. He has opened for many internationally known artists, and has performed with award-winning artists: Melissa Manchester, Maureen McGovern, Suzy Bogguss, and Debbie Boone, and the John Denver Band. He is a multiple award winning songwriter. He has performed on award-winning national television commercials and movie soundtracks. His licks have been published in Guitar Player Magazine. For ten years he was a Professor at the Colorado Springs Conservatory teaching guitar and musicianship, and is a regular instructor at the Colorado Roots Music Camps. He is a 2018 inductee into the Kansas Music Hall of Fame. He is currently recording, writing, and performing with the national bluegrass powerhouse, the Red Mountain Boys, and freelancing with multiple groups in the Pikes Peak Region.\n\nDavid Roth\n\nDavid Roth is a singer, songwriter, recording artist, and enthusiastic instructor who has taken his songs, experience, and expertise to a wide variety of venues in this and other countries full-time for more than three decades. His work has found its way to Carnegie Hall, the United Nations, several Chicken Soup for the Soul books, the Kennedy Center, Peter, Paul, & Mary and Kingston Trio CDs, the Kerrville (TX) New Folk Award, NASA’s Goddard Space Center, the Rise Up Singing and Rise Again (sequel) songbooks, and 15 CDs on the Wind River and Stockfisch (Germany) labels. David has taught singing, songwriting, and performance at SummerSongs (NY - where he serves as Executive Director), the Augusta Heritage workshops (WV), Common Ground on the Hill (MD), the Woods Dance & Music Camp (Ontario), Moab Folk Camp (UT), the National Wellness Institute (WI), the Swannanoa Gathering (NC), and for many other songwriting groups and associations around the country. David annually leads musical tour groups to Ireland and Scotland and is creator/director of the Cape Cod Songwriters Retreats which began in 2014. He’s also organizer/host of the Cape’s Full Moon Open Mic which since 2005 has provided a forum for musicians to connect/be heard while at the same time collecting donations ($17,000 to date) for local non-profits to help neighbors in need. www.davidrothmusic.com\n\nCosy Sheridan\n\nCosy Sheridan has been called one of the era’s finest and most thoughtful songwriters. She first appeared on the national folk scene when she won the songwriting contests at The Kerrville Folk Festival and The Telluride Bluegrass Festival in 1992 and released her critically acclaimed CD Quietly Led. The Albuquerque Journal called her “a buddhist monk trapped in the body of a singer-songwriter.” Backed by the strong rhythms and harmonies of her bass player Charlie Koch, she plays a percussive bluesy style of guitar – often in open tunings and occasionally with two or more capos on the guitar. “You can't make it into double digits, and continue touring for twenty or so years, unless you know what you're doing, and do it well,” wrote The Chicago Examiner. She has performed at Carnegie Hall, The Cowgirl Hall of Fame and on the Jerry Lewis Telethon. She was a voice student at Berklee College of Music and a guitar student of legendary finger style players Guy Van Duser and Eric Schoenberg. She teaches classes in songwriting, performance, and guitar at workshops and adult music camps across the country. She is the director of Moab Folk Camp in Moab, Utah. www.cosysheridan.com\n\nEric Jones\n\nEric Jones is a student of early Americana music. His sound reflects a fondness for dressing-up traditional songs in new musical styles. He was a founding member of the Irish-American band Keltika, and the western slope string band Big Timbre. In addition to his solo work, he can be heard playing mandolin with the alt-bluegrass band Quicksand Soup and the folk-rock Rogue Assets. Eric has been hosting jams and teaching mandolin at the Moab Folk Camp since its first year.\n\nMandy Danzig\n\nMandy plays almost anything with strings, and during her shows, she flows effortlessly from one instrument to another, weaving in and out of songs with her effervescent storytelling. Shows are rollicking romps through traditional and original music filled with joy, and an invitation for everyone to join the choir and sing along. As a teacher she is dedicated to the idea that the act of making music belongs in everyone’s life regardless of skill. Classes are a joyous supportive between student and teacher in pursuit of that goal. Mandy (She/Her/Hers) used to perform and teach under a different name and pronouns but she changed her name when she came out as transgender in December of 2019. A member of the duo Otter Creek, her song “The Fiddle Preacher” reached the top 10 on the Folk DJ charts. She has performed with the Salt Lake Choral Artists, the Southern Nevada Musical Arts Society, and the Utopia Early Music Ensemble in state premiers and programs that blend both classical and folk traditions. In collaboration with Wendy Lowder, her arrangement and performance was on TLC's Sister Wives. She is on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter as MandyLynnDanzig and can be found online at www.MandyLynnDanzig.com.\n\nAnke Summerhill\n\nAnke has been with the Moab Folk Camp since its beginnings and is an invaluable member of our staff. In recent years, she has worked with people of all ages in her community and beyond and is continually inspired by the healing power of music. She especially enjoys exploring songwriting and the creativity of playing the guitar with others as a way to weave community. Originally from Munich, Germany, Vancouver, British Columbia; and now surrounded by Utah's desert beauty, Anke’s diverse background and powerful gift of observation has seasoned her songwriting and performances with qualities which show genuine compassion. In addition to recording her own well received full-length CD projects, The Roots Run Deep and Shine On Through, her songs have found their way onto many CD compilations and samplers used in a wide variety of community fundraising projects. She recently recorded Utah Phillips' song, \"Miner’s Lullaby\" for the 2010 tribute project, The Long Memory ~ Utah remembers Bruce \"Utah\" Phillips, and she loved singing harmonies on Hal Cannon's debut solo recording. www.AnkeSummerhill.com\n\nCharlie Koch\n\nCharlie Koch has trained horses, sailed across the Atlantic more than once, and fronted an R&B band. He skippered a race boat for Buckminster Fuller. He whipped in for a fox hunt in Ireland and saddle-broke young horses on a breeding farm in France. He taught tennis, skiing, and horseback riding. He trained as a body-oriented psychotherapist. These days, he tours playing bass for his wife, singer/songwriter Cosy Sheridan. In his first CD, Help Me To Believe, Charlie sings of his father, who was also a sailor, and of his longing for a place to call home. His love songs are heartfelt. His melodies are influenced by such diverse writers as Otis Redding, Ray Charles, and James Taylor. His guitar playing has roots in soulful country blues."
