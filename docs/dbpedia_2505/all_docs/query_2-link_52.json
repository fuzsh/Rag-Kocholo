His social media handle may be Liam the everyday cat, but you will quickly discover that he may not be your everyday cat. Liam is, in fact, a cat actor and a pet influencer.\n\nContent\n\nFirst off, we gotta acknowledge that this is one STUNNING cat. Especially when he’s wearing one of his kitty outfits – his favorite being a tie. Yes, a tie. But hey, he’s not just a pretty face, this cat has skills! Firstly, he can do tricks. We’re talking “sit,” “high-five,” “handshake,” and more. Tell us when last you saw a cat learning tricks. We’ll wait.\n\nThis tabby cat also loves the great outdoors – going on adventures and camping. Gotta say, Liam looks like he is living his best life. We’re low-key jealous LOL!\n\nWe love Liam’s vibe. Even if you’re not really a cat lover, Liam will gain your interest and keep you wondering what he will do next. He really is a natural at being a pet influencer.\n\nCollabs\n\nBeing the smart cat that he is, Liam knows that Collabs are where it’s at. He has already secured a few, which you will see littered (pun intended) across his posts. Why wouldn’t you want to work with a cat who has a knack for keeping followers intrigued? We can’t think of a reason either. Contact this pet influencer to partner up and get your brand in the spotlight.\n\nHanna M. – @westieboywilson\n\nIntroducing us to her West Highland White Terrier (Westie if you prefer), is Hanna. The Westie in question? Wilson. He’s a happy chap whose personality shines through effortlessly… and all 31k+ of his growing fanbase soak it up.\n\nContent\n\nGotta say, we’re soaking it up too. Wilson has a million-dollar smile sure to brighten up any dull day. Even when he’s just chilling, lazing around in the sun with his shades on, #issavibe. He definitely loves being in the backyard. You can look forward to him chasing his oversized ball, running around, lazing around, and just generally living his best doggo life.\n\nIf you’re considering what type of dog to get, here is a quick warning.

Alongside him, you will also find Amber, his poodle puppy bestie. Together, they make adorable content, tugging at our heartstrings.\n\nContent\n\nRegal cuteness. That’s what you get when you put these two poodle puppies together. We’re talking matching outfits (including Easter hoodies), hilarious Insta Reels, and puppies just being, well… puppies!\n\nTheir mom, Natalia, has done (and continues to do) a great job with her choice of content. Her captions are witty and rib-tickling, keeping us fully entertained. Teddy does a great job as a pet influencer and so does Amber. Together, there is no heart they can’t win!\n\nCollabs\n\nIf you, like us, are thinking, “These two pet influencers are so cute, they must have scored several Collab deals,” you would be right. No need to look too far to find out just how many – they’re showing off their achievement of 200+ brand deals in their Instagram bio. Clearly, Teddy and Amber are pros at what they do.

Additionally, you can find the three of them on three social media platforms – TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook. Hey – more dogs, more coverage needed!\n\nWhy does their follower and fan count keep rising? Must be those dazzling smiles. Or perhaps it’s the hilarious captions.
