You may be looking for the episode or the Farmworld version.\n\n2021 Music Hole Award Nomination This article was nominated in the 2021 Music Hole Awards. It was nominated for the following category: Best Vocalist. However, it didn't win.\n\n2021 Who Would Win Tournament Nomination This article was nominated in the 2021 Who Would Win Tournament. They only made it to the second round, and the tournament is now concluded.\n\nJake (full title: Jacob \"Jake\" the Dog, Sr.[2]) is the deuteragonist of Adventure Time. He is a dog/shape-shifter hybrid, referred to by others as a \"magic dog\". He is Finn's constant companion, best friend, and adoptive brother.\n\nJake has a unique set of abilities called Stretchy Powers that allow him to manipulate the shape and size of his body, coming in handy on innumerable occasions throughout his and Finn's adventures. Jake was 28 years old at his debut in \"magical dog years,\" and ages throughout the series, though he rarely acts mature. It is inferred that magical dogs have a lifespan similar to Humans, as demonstrated by an aged Jake in \"Dungeon Train.\" Then again, how exactly magical dog years correlate to human years remains to be seen, although both Finn and Jake were shown to be babies around the same time, showing that they age slightly faster, however, his age as of \"Joshua and Margaret Investigations\" suggests that it slows down to the rate of human's aging at some point. Jake is currently in a relationship with Lady Rainicorn, and, by \"Jake the Dad,\" they are the parents of five Pups.\n\nQuick Answers\n\nWhat are Jake's stretchy powers in Adventure Time?\n\nJake from Adventure Time has stretchy powers, enabling him to alter his body's shape. These powers are frequently used in the series, including in battles against foes like the Lich. However, overstretching can thin his body, endangering his organs and potentially causing death. Jake can also create holes in his body and transport objects through himself. Occasionally, these powers act against his will, such as when his stomach formed a fist to punch him.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nHow old was Jake the Dog at his debut in Adventure Time?\n\nAt his debut in Adventure Time, Jake the Dog was 28 in 'magical dog years'. While the exact correlation to human years is unclear, it's inferred that Jake's aging process is akin to that of humans.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat is Jake's relationship with Finn in Adventure Time?\n\nIn Adventure Time, Jake and Finn are best friends and adoptive brothers. Despite their contrasting personalities, they form an excellent team. Jake uses his stretchy powers to protect Finn, even emotionally supporting him during his crush on Princess Bubblegum. They consider each other as family, with Finn viewing himself as Jake's 'puppy' son.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nWhat is Jake's full title in Adventure Time?\n\nIn the Adventure Time series, Jake is fully titled as Jacob 'Jake' the Dog, Sr. He is recognized as a magical dog and shape-shifter hybrid with Stretchy Powers, enabling him to alter his body's form and dimensions. Jake serves as a constant companion, best friend, and adoptive brother to Finn.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nHow does Jake's shape-shifting ability aid in his and Finn's adventures?\n\nJake's shape-shifting ability plays a vital role in his and Finn's adventures. He can enlarge his body to transport multiple passengers, minimize to fit in Finn's pocket, and morph into different forms. He can also harden or sharpen parts of his body, which is beneficial in battles. On occasions, Jake has transformed into a muscular entity, acting as armor for Finn, enabling Finn to manipulate his actions. Jake's stretchy powers have been utilized to combat various adversaries, including the Lich and an army of Earclopses.\n\nProvided by: Fandom\n\nDesign and voice acting\n\nJake is voiced by John DiMaggio (2019)\n\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2023)\n\nSeries creator Pendleton Ward has stated that he wrote Finn and Jake, including Adventure Time as a whole, as though he were playing a session of Dungeons & Dragons, a tabletop role-playing game. Ward commented that Finn and Jake's motivations are noble, with a desire to \"slay monsters, explore dungeons, find loot.\" He further said that \"Jake was more into the loot\". Ward spent much of his childhood at home, describing his \"[indoor] adventure experience\" as inspiring Finn and Jake the Dog's adventures. Early on in the development of the show, Ward had intended for Finn and Jake to be nomads who lived in tents. However, this was changed to having them live in a permanent home at Cartoon Network's request. Jake has three, four, or five fingers on each hand, as well as both hands and paws, which means, according to Ward, that he has the ability to grow and be flexible. He first appeared in the short film \"Adventure Time\", which centers around rescuing Princess Bubblegum (Hynden Walch) from the evil Ice King (John Kassir). This short aired as part of Nickelodeon's Random! Cartoons showcase in 2008. John DiMaggio voiced the character, then called Jake, in short.\n\nIn 2018, when Adventure time was about to end, DiMaggio said \"Until something's signed on the line there is no speculation ... this is it. It's over. It's done. And that's OK.\" He further said \"A lot of me is in Jake, and I'll miss that part, that connection.\" Adventure Time composer Tim Kiefer said that the show had gradually become an exploration of the \"Hero's journey\" through the characters.\n\nBackground\n\nJake was conceived when his parents, Joshua and Margaret, were on an investigation tracking down a shape-shifting creature in the forest near\n\nTree Trunks's house. During the investigation, they were attacked by the creature, and it bit Joshua on the head. Jake was later born from the pustule that formed from the bite on his father's head and was taken in by Joshua and Margaret to live alongside their natural-born son Jermaine. It is inferred that Jake's Stretchy Powers that he has had since he was a puppy are a result of his biological relationship with the shape-shifting creature, although Jake himself never learned this until the creature (revealing his name to be Warren Ampersand) returned in \"Jake the Starchild.\" Before this point, Jake believed he had gained his powers from rolling in mud as a puppy.[3] Little is revealed of Jake's past with his family. At some point, when Jake and Jermaine were still infants, Joshua and Margaret found a human baby named Finn abandoned in the woods, raising him as their own. Jake would develop a lifelong friendship with Finn over the years. Joshua was known to push his three sons to be tough, while Margaret was often more protective and nurturing towards them. Jake regardless generally holds fond memories of being raised by them in their old house.\n\nSometime around Joshua and Margaret's deaths, Jake moved into the Tree Fort with Finn while Jermaine stayed at their parents' house. For a while, Jake was known to be a successful criminal until he retired to take part in a more respectable life as an adventurer with Finn, later settling down with Lady Rainicorn to become a father.\n\nAppearance\n\nJake can morph into all sorts of fantastic shapes with his powers, but typically takes the form of an average sized yellow-orange bulldog. As revealed in \"Donny,\" he wears transparent pants made of spider webs spun by pixies. In \"What Was Missing,\" he borrows the pair of pants that Marceline wore in \"It Came from the Nightosphere.\"\n\nIn the animated short, he looked very similar to how he does now, but his eyes stayed the same throughout the episode, and his hands had no fingers except for when he was meditating.\n\nIn earlier seasons, Jake's design was drawn more thin and streamlined, but as the series progressed, he became more textured and bulbous, to add a realistic appeal.\n\nDue to a curse placed upon him by a wizard some point before the series began, his innards emit a vanilla odor, as stated by him in \"The Silent King.\"\n\nAfter the events of Elements, Jake has turned into a giant, blue-skinned, five-eyed monster that resembles a hybrid between his former self, and Warren Ampersand which is his true form. However, he quickly got changed back into his smaller, two-eyed, yellow self in \"Abstract.\" It was later revealed in \"Come Along With Me\" that Jake is able to change between his shapeshifter alien form and his dog form.\n\nAbilities\n\nJake's Stretchy Powers enable him to modify the size, shape, and dimensions of every part of his body. Not only can he stretch and contort himself into highly specific forms, but he can also rearrange his internal organs, bones, and teeth. In \"Evicted!,\" he was able to shrink and move his internal organs and blood into his left thumb. Also in \"Jake vs. Me-Mow,\" he enlarged his liver fifty-one times a dog his size, preventing him from succumbing to Me-Mow's poison. One frequent use of his powers is Key Hand, which he uses to pick locks. He has also used his arm as a bow able to accurately shoot arrows at a short distance.\n\nAlthough he lacks the zeal for fighting that Finn possesses, Jake is a capable fighter. What he lacks in Finn's talent for swordsmanship, he makes up for in toughness and magical brawn. He is a capable hand-to-hand fighter and can transform his limbs into weapons. He can also stretch to entangle enemies or grow to gain a height and weight advantage. Jake’s powers are magical in nature. His shapeshifting can grant him supernatural strength, allowing him to simply overpower his enemies. However, Pendleton Ward has said in an interview that Jake uses his powers lazily and does not know their full extent, often hindering Jake's effectiveness in combat. Despite stating outright that he's multiple times stronger than Finn, Jake often leaves the brawling to his adoptive brother.\n\nAs shown in \"Mystery Train,\" Jake is also able to stretch himself to \"create\" an entirely new person, as long as they remain connected to him. In \"You Made Me,\" he is shown to be able to move objects through his body freely when he lets Princess Bubblegum jump into his mouth and then pushes her up through his back. Jake can be stretched by force as seen in \"Ocean of Fear,\" when Finn stretched Jake's ears to avoid making contact with the ocean and in \"Beautopia\" when forced into a paddle. Jake's powers are sometimes used against his will, as in \"Power Animal\" where Jake's stomach took the shape of a fist and punched him so that he would wake up and eat.\n\nJake's stretching ability is subject to the principle of conservation of mass as seen in \"The Limit.\" However, the ratio at which he retains mass is different than what applies to other masses in Ooo. It is revealed that while Jake can stretch his body to incredible lengths, his body could be pulled so long that it becomes dangerously thin. Once his mass is distributed along a certain length of his body, it becomes difficult for him to support himself; at one point, Jake was forced to walk along the ground. If he were to stretch beyond his absolute limit, it is presumed that he would completely thin out and die.\n\nAfter receiving training from his true father Warren Ampersand, Jake can now change to a blue color and in this state, his powers are even more advanced. He was able to grow a pair of wings which allowed him to take flight.\n\nOn two legs, without his powers, Jake is rather weak and can barely even run, as seen in \"The Witch's Garden,\" though this could partially be due to the bipedal humanoid body he was given in the episode. In most other cases, he seems to prefer running on all fours.\n\nBeing a dog, Jake has an acute sense of smell, as he can apparently smell the precise location of an object miles away. In \"The Chamber of Frozen Blades\" he stated that his sense of smell is \"1,000 times better\" than Finn's, although compared to normal dogs this is a low estimate, suggesting that he was either just guessing, or his sense of smell is similar to that of an average dog. He also claimed in \"The Enchiridion\" that he could not only smell the book but also that it was in a room inside of a castle.\n\nHe also owns a sword, a shield, and an ax but seldom uses them in combat. In \"Mystery Train,\" when disguised as the Conductor, he briefly uses a sword to fight Finn, who defeats him effortlessly. During the same time, he also displays a prowess for skateboarding, as he performs jumps, ollies, and grinds, several atop a moving train. Jake's penchant for skateboarding is also shown in \"Dark Purple\" and \"Wheels.\"\n\nJake also has a supernaturally powerful imagination (on the verge of having psychic powers) as seen in \"Rainy Day Daydream.\" Anything he imagines becomes reality; however, only he can see his own creations.\n\nMusical\n\nJake is a skilled musician as well, particularly with the viola, which can have peculiar effects when playing certain pieces such as the first movement of Beethoven's 14th piano sonata. Jake's viola is the home of Shelby the Worm and has the word \"toots\" scratched on the back, which is shown in the episode \"What Was Missing.\" In the same episode, Jake purposefully breaks his viola and, later, repairs it. Jake also plays the acoustic guitar, as seen when he plays the titular song in \"Susan Strong.\" It is shown in \"Incendium\" that he can also play the ukulele. Jake will beat-box on occasion, such as in \"Slow Love,\" \"Daddy's Little Monster,\" and \"Dad's Dungeon.\" In \"Death in Bloom,\" Finn describes Jake as \"the musical one.\" Jake also sings often in the series, usually along with Finn or on his own. In \"Mortal Recoil,\" he can also turn his butt into drums, which he uses to play a song for Princess Bubblegum.\n\nFighting style\n\nJake does not share Finn's aggressive style of fighting and does not rely on any form of formal training mainly focusing on overpowering his opponents with giant muscles and giant size and weight. Jake does more than punch and kick; his powers allow him to stretch and knot up his opponents, though this has shown to be effective only on certain characters such as Ice King, who struggled to break free of Jake's grip, whereas Hunson Abadeer can break free almost instantly.\n\nSkills and hobbies\n\nJake is a natural born singer and dancer, in fact, his first words were a song and dance, and he loves to see others do it too. He even showed a dancing bug \"how it's done.\"\n\nJake also claims to be very proficient at the board game Card Wars. He has a very good understanding of the game since he was able to explain all of the rules to Finn. However, Finn was able to nearly beat him easily (he purposefully lost to spare Jake's feelings).\n\nIn \"Freak City,\" Jake claims he can sense when Finn is about to cry, saying \"it's like a mother-daughter thing.\" Apparently, Jake can also calm Finn down with his saliva.\n\nJake can also speak Korean, which he uses to communicate with Lady Rainicorn. In \"Her Parents,\" he writes a note to Lady's mother and father using Hangul, the Korean writing system and greets them speaking the formal Korean language.\n\nIn \"Power Animal,\" Jake's body is filled with the energy of \"a thousand partying demons,\" as a catch from his wish granted by the Party God. As a result, a few temporary powers were granted to him, such as the ability to fly (although, this might not have been flight, but merely a sort of homing beacon to find Finn because Jake did not appear to have any control over his direction). In receiving these powers, his body began to glow, and his eyes became stars flashing multiple colors.\n\nIn \"The Chamber of Frozen Blades,\" Jake and Finn both gain powers similar to the Ice King by reading the Ice Ninja Manual, but lose their powers after the episode is over, as they did not have enough time to commit the incantations and hand positions to memory.\n\nIn \"The New Frontier,\" Jake says that he will probably live another hundred years suggesting that his magical powers also make it so Jake will live much longer than the average dog.\n\nIn \"Dad's Dungeon,\" Jake farts on the Fruit Witches while climbing away from them (holding Finn) causing the witches to fall down presumably due to the stench.\n\nIn \"Blood Under the Skin,\" Jake is shown to be able to easily understand poems by feeling it.\n\nLike dogs in the real world, Jake has been shown to bark instinctively, most often when angry. He barks when disciplining the Candy Kids in \"Goliad\" and at the Green Knight for threatening and fighting Finn in \"Gumbaldia.\" In \"Gut Grinder,\" he barks and howls after being put in a trance from getting his stomach petted.\n\nAs shown in \"The Great Bird Man,\" Jake knows how to read Braille, which was taught to him by his ex (who was revealed to be Moniker who debuted in Daddy-Daughter Card Wars).\n\nJake has also shown to be a skilled thief as revealed in the episode \"One Last Job,\" having stolen the Baker's Shard, one of the most highly protected jewels in the Candy Kingdom.\n\nJake also lacks the ability to do math. In many episodes, it is shown that he can barely even count to ten.\n\nAt various points in the series, Jake has been shown to be a very proficient chef who regularly experiments with new techniques and dishes.\n\nPersonality and character traits\n\nJake is generally laid-back and tends not to worry about things. He relies heavily on his powers (or Finn) to get him out of any dangerous predicament. While he often cracks jokes at serious times, Jake always has a lecture or a song to cheer Finn up if he is feeling disheartened. Acting as Finn's world-wise mentor, Jake is always willing to give input and advice about a situation, but his suggestions are usually inconsistent, ranging from encouraging and helpful suggestions to ridiculous nonsense. He can be somewhat irresponsible at times, frequently leaving Finn to fight most of a battle on his own, but he always pulls through when he is needed most.\n\nJake may be dyslexic, as evidenced by the fact that he writes backward, as shown on his note to Finn in \"Storytelling.\" However, Finn also writes backwards in several episodes, indicating that this may be the result of Joshua and Margaret's parenting style or a common mistake in the Land of Ooo. Jake is easily persuaded into doing dangerous and irresponsible things, as in \"The Limit\" when he states that he will do anything if someone says his name three times.\n\nJake loves to eat. He likes junk food, especially pie, burgers, and ice cream, but he has stated in \"Slumber Party Panic\" that eating chocolate or fudge would probably kill him, much like a normal dog. He is not afraid to try new foods (as seen in \"Her Parents\") and invents many of his own foods. There is evidence of his ability to cook; he makes Korean food for Finn at the beginning of \"Apple Thief,\" and he cooked all the food that he used to make the Everything Burrito. He made coffee in \"Beautopia,\" bacon pancakes in \"Burning Low\" and also scrambled eggs in \"Frost & Fire.\" He used his cooking skills to create an incredible sandwich in \"Time Sandwich\" that contained several unusual and original ingredients such as lobster soul and a bird from the kitchen window.\n\nJake also possesses symptoms of ADHD. He can literally forget about a conversation in a moment and start doing something completely unrelated, such as putting an ice cream cone in a toaster. This is shown in \"Power Animal\" when he gets continually distracted by his surroundings while looking for Finn. Cinnamon Bun summarizes it quite nicely, saying, \"Jake, you don't really focus at all.\" This is also shown in \"Burning Low,\" when he falls asleep twice: once when Princess Bubblegum is trying to explain why Finn cannot be with Flame Princess, and again when Finn tries to get poetry ideas from him.\n\nJake can be rather fickle at times. A prime example of this is in \"The Duke,\" when he convinces Finn to blame the Duke of Nuts for turning Princess Bubblegum green and bald, but later spends the rest of the episode trying to convince Finn to confess that he did it. In \"Freak City,\" he spends most of the episode trying to convince Finn to remain a \"good-smelling\" foot, and uncharacteristically tells Finn to give up hope. This behavior is somewhat explained later by his confession that he kind of always wanted to be a foot.\n\nAt times, Jake is shown to have somewhat of a dark side. Throughout the series, Jake makes some questionable comments and actions that come off as evil or selfish, such as in the episode \"My Two Favorite People,\" when he laughs evilly. Furthermore, in \"Susan Strong,\" he says \"We can rule them like gods. Angry gods.\" Another example of Jake's darker side is seen in the episode \"Apple Thief,\" when he mentions that he used to \"[steal] old ladies' purses\" and \"hock stolen bikes.\" Jake also acts questionably in \"Conquest of Cuteness,\" when he suggests squishing all the cute people instead of helping them feel better like Finn wanted to do. In \"Morituri Te Salutamus,\" Jake shouts at the cute animals to go away after saving them. Jake has a tendency to steal items without realizing what he is doing, as seen in the episodes \"The Witch's Garden\" and \"City of Thieves.\" He also steals valuables from the graveyard in \"Ghost Princess,\" but his excuse was that he \"didn't know it was wrong.\" This could be a result of his criminal past. In the episode \"Hot to the Touch,\" when Finn and Jake are flying in the robot suits Neptr made, Jake says \"I feel like I could touch the heavens and sock angels.\"\n\nJake is generally easy-going, but certain things have been known to set him off. In \"Goliad,\" Jake yelled and barked at the children when they would not calm down. He is also shown to take some games very seriously, such as Card Wars and Kompy's Kastle. In \"Card Wars\" Jake becomes visibly upset when Finn starts to beat him, and BMO reveals that when it won against Jake before, he would not talk to BMO for a month. In \"Who Would Win\" Finn breaks Jake's portable Kompy's Kastle game (which Jake has to play every day in order to maintain his rank) and Jake responds by physically attacking Finn. Jake is not afraid of death as shown in \"The New Frontier.\"\n\nIt is possible that Jake has a particular phobia of intruders, and or interlopers. As in the episodes: \"Conquest of Cuteness,\" \"Evicted!,\" and in \"Earth & Water,\" when he perceives that someone has entered their house without permission, and remains unseen, he is quite petrified with fear; rushing to Finn and clinging to him, or simply screaming and falling prone on the ground. This could imply that he is not a natural guard dog, either by nature or by nurture; despite his career path of adventuring, perhaps preferring the up-front adversity. In Davey, when Finn (dressed as Davey) runs into Jake, he forms his hand into a cage, traps the \"intruder,\" and yells for Finn.\n\nHe is a firm believer in fate and destiny. Jake also believes in Grob Gob Glob Grod and Glob World. He is also not very willing to do things that require effort sometimes as shown in \"The Witch's Garden\" when he is unwilling to run and save Finn from Gary. His lack of effort is also shown in \"Who Would Win\" when he states that he would rather play Kompy's Kastle than train. Jake's firm belief in determinism is underpinned, or at least is indicative, of a possible commitment to the philosophical creed of stoicism. In the episode \"Puhoy\" Jake consoles Finn's love induced melancholy by suggesting he 'focus on what's real' as opposed to \"getting all hung up on imaginary problems.\" To explain this he throws his favorite cup out the window in order to make it \"not real\" so he does not care about it anymore. This is a direct reference to the third aphorism of stoic philosopher Epictetus' Enchiridion (135AD), which in turn may be the influence on the Enchiridion that was destroyed by the Lich. However, later that episode he fishes the cup out so his belief in determinism is somewhat inconsistent.\n\nJake also seems to like boots, as seen in \"City of Thieves\" Jake steals boots from a store, and also in \"Incendium\" when he goes out to find Finn a new love interest, he puts on a pair of boots, meaning that Jake likes wearing boots sometimes. He has also been known to have a great love for sandwiches as seen in \"Jake the Dog,\" \"The Limit\" and \"Dungeon\", with \"Jake the Dog\" and \"Dungeon\" being the most notable examples seeing as how he was willing to waste his only wish for a sandwich and choose a sandwich as a weapon, respectively.\n\nAge\n\nIn the debut of the series, Jake was said to be 28 years old in \"magical dog years,\" although at the time, it wasn't specified how old that is in human years. In \"Dad's Dungeon\" and \"Jake the Dad\" he and Finn are seen as babies at the same, meaning that he ages at a faster rate than humans, but a slower rate than dogs do normally. However, this may just be an error.\n\nIn \"Memory of a Memory\" in Finn's memories Finn is seen as a baby and pictures on the wall show Jake and Jermaine as older kids hinting that Jake may be older than Finn in human years.\n\nIn \"Joshua and Margaret Investigations,\" in the flashback of the day Jake was born, it also mentioned the events that occurred after Flame Princess's birth in \"Earth & Water\" happened on the same day, meaning that Jake would be 16 years old in human years.\n\nHis current biological age is 34, as stated by Steve Wolfhard in the Conversation Parade podcast,[4] meaning that at some point his aging slowed down from when he was a puppy. Jake says in \"Daddy-Daughter Card Wars\" that he's lost track of how old he is, but thinks he might be almost 40.\n\n\"The First Investigation\" once again shows Jake and Finn being babies at the same time, implying that they may be the same age in human years.\n\n\"Jake the Starchild\" shows that Jake (and Jermaine) turned five while Finn was still a baby, and later shows as a teenager graduating high school, with Finn still as a baby, implying that he may age fast and making Jake's real age even more difficult to comprehend.\n\nLikewise, in the prequel Adventure Time: Distant Lands special \"BMO\", Finn is a young child while Jake is appears to be a preteen or teenager.\n\nAppearances\n\nThis section needs expansion. You can help by adding to it. (June 2023)\n\nJake the Dog is the main character of Adventure Time and often appears alongside his best friend and adopted brother Finn the Human.\n\nIn the series finale \"Come Along With Me,\" Finn and Jake help Princess Bubblegum fight her dictatorial uncle Gumbald. Realizing that violence is not the answer to the conflict, they ally with Gumbald to defeat the evil deity GOLB, who is intent on destroying Ooo. GOLB is defeated, although Fern dies in the aftermath. Jake and Finn promises to plant Fern's seedling in the ruins of the treehouse, which has been destroyed. The seedling grows into a new treehouse, with a grass sword inside. Finn and Jake are shown relaxing on a beach.\n\nThe Adventure Time: Distant Lands special \"Together Again\" takes place sometime after the end of the series, when Jake has died of old age. He then journeys through the Dead Worlds to be reunited with Finn, who is also deceased. After reuniting with Finn in the afterlife, the two choose to reincarnate back into the living world.\n\nOthers\n\nSince Adventure Time's inception, Jake has appeared in various comic book series, video games, and other merchandise. Jake's first console game appearance was as a playable character in Adventure Time: Hey Ice King! Why'd You Steal Our Garbage?!!, which was released on Nintendo DS and 3DS in 2012. He was subsequently a playable character in Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I Don't Know! (2013), Adventure Time: The Secret of the Nameless Kingdom (2014), and Adventure Time: Pirates of the Enchiridion (2018).\n\nJake has also made crossover appearances in other franchises and media. He appeared in the seventh season Futurama episode \"Leela and the Genestalk\". In the Futurama episode, Jake had a minor dialogue, and was still voiced by DiMaggio, who also voiced one of the main characters in Futurama, Bender. The opening sequence couch gag in the 28th season The Simpsons episode \"Monty Burns' Fleeing Circus\", Homer Simpson appears as Jake in an extended couch gag parodying the opening sequence of Adventure Time. He also appeared in the Uncle Grandpa episodes \"Pizza Eve\" and \"Cartoon Factory\". He also appeared in the OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes episode, \"Crossover Nexus\". Jake is a playable character in toys-to-life game Lego Dimensions (2015), beat 'em up game Cartoon Network: Battle Crashers (2016), crossover game Bloons Tower Defense: Adventure Time (2018), and fighting game Brawlhalla (2019), and action-adventure game Immortals Fenyx Rising (2020). In November 2021, Jake was confirmed to appear as a playable character in the fighting game MultiVersus (2022).\n\nFionna and Cake\n\nMain article: Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake\n\nA gender-swapped version of Jake called Cake the Cat appeared in the season 3 episode \"Fionna and Cake\", and was brought back in subsequent episodes. Cake is a main character in the spin-off series Adventure Time: Fionna and Cake. The concept for Fionna and Cake came from drawings made by Adventure Time storyboard artist Natasha Allegri. Both Fionna and Cake the Cat became popular with Adventure Time fans. Cake later appeared in the fifth-season episode \"Bad Little Boy\", the sixth-season episode \"The Prince Who Wanted Everything\", the eighth-season episode \"Five Short Tables\", and the ninth season episode \"Fionna and Cake and Fionna\".\n\nEpisode appearances\n\nMajor appearances\n\nEvery episode except the following:\n\n\"What is Life?\"\n\n\"It Came from the Nightosphere\" (non-speaking cameo)\n\n\"Too Young\"\n\n\"Fionna and Cake\" (non-speaking cameo)\n\n\"Thank You\"\n\n\"Another Way\"\n\n\"BMO Noire\"\n\n\"Lady & Peebles\"\n\n\"I Remember You\"\n\n\"Finn the Human\"\n\n\"Up a Tree\"\n\n\"Mystery Dungeon\"\n\n\"Vault of Bones\"\n\n\"Simon & Marcy\"\n\n\"BMO Lost\"\n\n\"The Suitor\" (non-speaking)\n\n\"The Party's Over, Isla de Señorita\" (non-speaking cameo)\n\n\"Sky Witch\" (non-speaking cameo)\n\n\"Frost & Fire\"\n\n\"Too Old\"\n\n\"Earth & Water\"\n\n\"The Vault\"\n\n\"Box Prince\"\n\n\"Apple Wedding\"\n\n\"Bad Timing\"\n\n\"Billy's Bucket List\"\n\n\"Breezy\"\n\n\"Sad Face\" (non-speaking cameo)\n\n\"Something Big\"\n\n\"Little Brother\"\n\n\"Thanks for the Crabapples, Giuseppe\"\n\n\"Nemesis\"\n\n\"Joshua and Margaret Investigations\"\n\n\"Dentist\"\n\n\"The Cooler\"\n\n\"Astral Plane\"\n\n\"Gold Stars\"\n\n\"The Visitor\" (non-speaking cameo)\n\n\"Dark Purple\"\n\n\"Hoots\"\n\n\"All's Well That Rats Swell\" (non-speaking cameo, short)\n\n\"The Gift That Reaps Giving (short)\n\n\"Cherry Cream Soda\"\n\n\"Everything Stays\"\n\n\"Summer Showers\"\n\n\"Scamps\"\n\n\"The Hall of Egress\"\n\n\"High Strangeness\" (non-speaking cameo)\n\n\"Jelly Beans Have Power\"\n\n\"Mysterious Island\"\n\n\"Hide and Seek\"\n\n\"Min and Marty\"\n\n\"Bespoken For\"\n\n\"Skyhooks II\"\n\n\"Ketchup\" (flashback; non-speaking)\n\n\"Fionna and Cake and Fionna\"\n\n\"Whispers\"\n\n\"Three Buckets\"\n\n\"The Wild Hunt\"\n\n\"Son of Rap Bear\" (non-speaking)\n\n\"Bonnibel Bubblegum\"\n\n\"Temple of Mars\"\n\n\"Diamonds and Lemons\"\n\n\"BMO\" (non-speaking cameo)\n\nAbsences\n\n\"Bad Little Boy\"\n\n\"Rattleballs\" (mentioned)\n\n\"The Red Throne\" (mentioned)\n\n\"Lemonhope Part 1\"\n\n\"Lemonhope Part 2\"\n\n\"The Prince Who Wanted Everything\"\n\n\"Princess Day\"\n\n\"Evergreen\"\n\n\"Friends Forever\"\n\n\"Be Sweet\"\n\n\"Orgalorg\"\n\n\"On the Lam\"\n\n\"Sow, Do You Like Them Apples\" (short)\n\n\"Varmints\"\n\n\"Broke His Crown\"\n\n\"Lady Rainicorn of the Crystal Dimension\"\n\n\"Bun Bun\" (imitation)\n\n\"Five Short Tables\"\n\n\"Happy Warrior\" (mentioned and pictured)\n\n\"Hero Heart\" (mentioned)\n\n\"Ring of Fire\"\n\n\"Blenanas\" (mentioned)\n\n\"Obsidian\" (pictured as a tattoo)\n\n\"Wizard City\" (pictured)\n\n\"Simon Petrikov\" (mentioned and pictured as a tattoo)\n\n\"Prismo the Wishmaster\" (cameo)\n\nRelationships\n\nMain article: Jake's relationships\n\nVarious Forms\n\nPast Lives\n\nAlternate Universe Jakes\n\nName Image Description Farmworld Jake Main Article: Farmworld Jake\n\nIn the episode \"The Lich,\" after real Finn and Jake are pulled in the wormhole by the Lich disguised as Billy, the scene goes to another dimension where we see Farmworld Finn with a robotic arm and playing the flute. Jake is seen as a normal dog with small eyes and has no shapeshifting or stretching powers and is unable to speak but barks like a normal dog. This was caused by Finn's wish for the Lich's nonexistence. At the climax of \"Jake The Dog,\" after Finn saves Jake from the goo pit of the Mushroom Bomb, Jake acts more rabid and aggressive. Later on, he gained his powers in the Farmworld but had terrible results as he attacks Farmworld Finn while turning into a giant Lich-like monster.\n\nOlder/Dungeon Train In the episode \"Dungeon Train\", Finn observes a possible future scenario where he doesn't leave the Dungeon Train, and keeps fighting the train's denizens. Finn is initially content with this outcome, until he sees that Jake stayed with him all those years, trying in vain to get Finn to leave with him. Jake Plants Main Article: We're Plants\n\n\"We're Plants\" is a duet Finn and Jake perform in the episode \"Food Chain.\" It features Finn and Jake as two flowers singing about how days move faster from a plants perspective due to them moving slowly. Half way through, they are being eaten by caterpillars and crying for help. They are happy when two birds arrive to eat the caterpillars.\n\nWeirdo Jake Main Article: Weirdo Jake\n\nWeirdo Jake is an alternate version of Jake the Dog. He resides in the Grotto World, which can only be accessed via a whirlpool in The Grotto of the Water Nymphs. He lives in a regular tree with Weirdo Finn.\n\nJacques the Raccoon Main Article: Jacques\n\nJacques the Raccoon is a fictional character created by the Ice Queen in her fan-fiction, intended to be a gender swapped version of Cake. He is presumably Flynn's adoptive brother, as that is the relationship of their genderswaps.\n\nCake the Cat Main Article: Cake\n\nCake the Cat is the gender-swapped version of Jake in the Ice King's self-written fan-fictions, created by Adventure Time character designer Natasha Allegri. She is a supporting character in Adventure Time: Fionna & Cake. She is also featured in the episodes \"Fionna and Cake,\" \"Bad Little Boy,\" \"The Prince Who Wanted Everything,\" \"Five Short Tables,\" and briefly in \"Fionna and Cake and Fionna.\" She is also mentioned by the Ice King in \"King Worm\" and \"Mystery Dungeon\".\n\nCake travels with Fionna, and Lord Monochromicorn is her boyfriend. She has Stretchy Powers and can morph her body just like Jake. As a cat, she also possesses the ability to see in the dark. The fur on her tail stands on the end (or \"frizzes out\") when there is danger around or when she gets excited (e.g., when Lord Monochromicorn speaks to her).\n\nIn the sequel series Adventure Time: Fionna & Cake, it was revealed that Cake and Fionna are real due to Prismo's inspiration to create his own reality, but had been hidden within Ice King's mind.\n\nBaby Jake Main Article: Baby Jake\n\nJake, also known as Baby Jake is the version of Jake from the Baby World timeline who makes his first appearance in \"The Winter King\".\n\nDisguises and Forms\n\nName Image Description\n\nJake's subconscious\n\nJake's subconscious is the subconscious manifestation of Jake that appears in the episode \"The Witch's Garden.\" He is first seen at the River of Junk when Jake said that crossing the river looked hard. Jake's subconscious then appears before Jake and also tells him that it is too hard to cross the river and that Jake should simply wear a hat instead. This suggests that Jake's subconscious has a personality similar to Jake's. He later appears when Jake is making his appeal to the Witch in order to get his powers back. When Jake refuses to give in to the Witch's humiliating demands, Jake's subconscious tells Jake that he is the subconscious form of Jake's old magical self, and is, therefore, beginning to die. This makes Jake start to cry and apologize. The Witch is thoroughly happy with Jake's sorrow and decides to take pity on him. She returns his powers and subsequently restores the vitality of his subconscious self. Jake and his subconscious then leave the Witch's garden in laughter after Jake takes away the Witch's cane, rendering her powerless.\n\nAlthough Jake's subconscious is translucent and merely Jake's subconscious, he is still solid as when Jake cried over his dying body, tears ran off to his sides. This also means that Jake's subconscious can affect the material plane, as shown when he passes the hat to Jake; he also blames his subconscious for somehow getting a donut, so it could've been that his subconscious actually went and brought it to Jake. It can be assumed that only magical beings can see Jake's subconscious because while Jake was having a vibrant conversation with his subconscious, Finn tells him to \"stop talking to yourself!\" (however, since Jake's subconscious is himself, Jake, another interpretation could be that Finn literally meant that Jake should stop talking to \"himself.\") The Witch who stripped Jake of his magical powers was also somehow able to see him and hear him.\n\nBlue Nose\n\nMain article: Blue Nose\n\nBlue Nose is the main character in the episode, \"Sad Face.\" He's Jake's tail wearing a small black fedora, and makeup to depict a white face, red frown, and blue nose. He takes on a mind of his own and joins the Traveling Mini Circus in order to free Goralina from the grasp of the Ringmaster. In the end, he was successful.\n\nConductor\n\nThe Conductor is the main antagonist in \"Mystery Train.\" He is seen with a winking, smiling, and blushing (all at once), and his pink head is much wider than his body. He wears a blue suit and hat. Throughout the episode, he comes and goes during the train ride, and begins creeping Finn out. Not until all other suspects are dead is he actually suspected of murdering all the candy people, because according to Finn, \"It's never the creepy guy who's the murderer.\" After supposedly \"murdering\" everybody, including Jake, an enraged Finn chases him across the entire length of the train. After a short one-on-one battle in the train's control room, he is revealed to be Jake in disguise-via pink and blue paint and his stretchy powers. The paint may be some sort of liquid candy since Jake licked it off of himself after he revealed himself.\n\nMagic Fist\n\nMagic Fist is the disguise Finn and Jake wore in \"Wizard Battle\" in order to be eligible to compete. Finn and Jake wear a big red trench coat, a blue hood, and dark blue shades. Only Finn's face and Jake's arms and legs can be seen, and the rest is kept under the coat. Jake was the 'magic second head' of Magic Fist and Magic Fist's Limbs are Jake's arms and legs. Since Jake cannot see while his head is inside the cloak, Finn tells Jake where to attack with clock position code.\n\nGut Grinder\n\nEven though Jake was not the Gut Grinder, he believed himself to be the Gut Grinder so much he became one. Soft People, Cube People, and Spiky People all thought that Jake was the Gut Grinder. Once he believes he is the gut grinder, his eyes become black and white spirals (most likely to emphasize his craziness). And throughout the episode, the scared townspeople thought Jake was the Gut Grinder. The Gut Grinder was actually Sharon the mayor's wife, who made her costume look like Jake because she thought he was hot. The actual gut grinder costume looks similar to Jake, but with dark orange, rough fur, and the same crazy spiral eyes (he also carries a mace which looks like Jake's face, with pink spikes and a white and pink striped handle).\n\nGroucho\n\nWhen entering the Spiky Village in the episode \"Gut Grinder\"; Finn gave Jake a pair of \"Groucho glasses\" so that the Spiky People would not think Jake was the Gut Grinder. Jake donned the combination glasses/nose/mustache and introduced himself as \"Groucho,\" a clear homage to Groucho Marx. He walks on four legs, sports a much wider body (to the proportion of a horse, or a similarly-sized animal) and wears the glasses on a fake head, while his face lies hidden between the front two legs.\n\nBaron of the Grasslands\n\nIn \"Incendium,\" Jake claims to be the \"Baron of the Grasslands,\" and an envoy of \"Prince\" Finn. Jake pretended that he was of royal blood to court Flame Princess for Finn, but later on, discovers that Flame Princess is evil. He is seen blue because he is using flame shield; this also causes his backpack and boots to look blue. He is seen using a flame guitar while in this persona, which he uses to sing \"All Warmed Up Inside\".\n\nRandy Butternubs\n\nIn the episode \"The Creeps,\" Jake wears a tall top hat with a green mask along with a purple cape with a tuxedo and a bow tie. He also wears black shoes. Jake shows a lack of appreciation for his alias when he throws the card on the ground.\n\nLumpy Jake\n\nIn the episode \"Trouble in Lumpy Space,\" Jake was turned lumpy during the Mallow Tea Ceremony when Lumpy Space Princess falls on him and bites him causing Jake to get The lumps. When he turned back to normal Jake, he was at Promcoming and he fell on the antidote that Finn brought. He is pink and his face looks the same. He only has four lumps, not including his tail and talks like Lumpy Space Princess. He also developed an attitude similar to Lumpy Space Princess. Lumpy Jake is hated by Lumpy Finn.\n\nDemon Jake\n\nDemon Jake appears in \"Daddy's Little Monster\" so they can sneak into the Nightosphere. He sings \"Political Rap\" in this form. Jake looks like a quadrupedal demon with big and sharp teeth. He has pointy ears, his eyes are black with white diamonds in the center, and an extra large jaw to showcase the many pointy teeth.\n\nZombie Jake\n\nZombie Jake appears in \"From Bad to Worse,\" when he was bitten by Mr. Candy Cane as a Candy Zombie. Zombie Jake looks like Jake, but with dark yellow-gray skin and cracks throughout his skin, along with dark-rimmed light green eyes. Zombie Jake is the first zombie to be cured in \"From Bad to Worse,\" but turns back into a zombie merely seconds later after being bitten again. A different version of Zombie Jake appears in the Adventure Time game, Rhythm Heroes.\n\nJakesuit\n\nThe Jakesuit first appears in \"The Silent King.\" This is the only way the goblins will not see their \"King\" being 'un-kingly.' The Jakesuit consists of Jake as armor with a hole for Finn's face; the hole looks like the hole on Finn's hat. This suit makes it's user look extra muscular, although that's just because of Jake's stretchy powers.\n\nThe Jakesuit returns again in the episodes \"Jake Suit\", \"Reboot,\" and \"Together Again\".\n\nMilkman/Mailman Jake\n\nIn the episode \"Princess Cookie,\" Jake dresses as a milkman in order to try to rescue the hostages (he wanted to dress as a milkman, but Princess Bubblegum said it wasn't realistic). Finn dresses in an outfit similar to that of a ninja, pretending to be Jake's shadow. At the end of the episode, dressed as a mailman, he delivers a daisy crown to Baby-Snaps. His milkman outfit is a simple white suit and cap, with a black tie, belt, and boots. His mailman outfit is a white button-up t-shirt with blue shorts held up by the same belt, a tan safari hat, and a blue satchel filled with mail.\n\nRainicorn Jake\n\nIn the episode, \"Her Parents,\" Jake dresses up like a Rainicorn to impress Lady's parents. In his imagination, he has stripes in light pink, dark pink, purple, neon green, yellow, and salmon (the legs have the same pattern as Lady's legs). In reality, he is simply covered in ketchup and mustard.\n\nFemale Cinnamon Bun\n\nIn the episode, \"All Your Fault,\" Jake is shapeshifted to look like a female Cinnamon Bun. He also wears a pink bow and is called \"girlfriend\" by Cinnamon Bun. This is not the same as the Cinnamon Bun gender-swap; although both have bows on their head, Jake's is pink, while the gender-swap's is green (she also has a green dress, while Jake's version has no clothes).\n\nFinn's memory Jake\n\nMain article: Imaginary Jake\n\nIn the episode \"Puhoy,\" Elder Finn has a flashback about Jake, but he looks odd and morphed. His nose and jowls are further up, in between his eyes. His jowls also appear to be longer than usual. His eyes are the opposite color, with the outsides white and the insides black. Also, he has three white hairs on his head. He also gives different advice than actual Jake did.\n\nPete Sassafras's lawyer\n\nIn the episode \"Candy Streets\" when Pete Sassafras is in the Candy Dungeon, Finn and Jake are interrogating Pete. Because they are certain he is guilty, as a joke, Jake makes a fake lawyer sprout from himself. The lawyer lets Pete know that he is ultimately guilty, and Pete is obviously a little confused by this. He looks to have short hair, wide eyes, and a shirt and tie (although this is made completely of Jake's skin).\n\nJMO\n\nIn the episode \"Be More,\" Jake shapeshifts into a MO in order to gain entrance to the MO Co. There is no known JMO created by Moe, although it can be assumed that there is one for every letter, and that we simply haven't seen a real JMO before.\n\nSheet Ghost Jake\n\nIn the episode, \"Ghost Fly\", in an attempt to stop the Ghost Fly, Jake gathered some \"unfinished business\" and was then zapped by BMO so that he may become a Sheet Ghost. In this form, he could enter the same realm as the Ghost Fly and make physical contact with him.\n\nHermit Eyes Forms\n\nIn the episode \"Don't Look\", Finn acquired a pair of magical eyes that caused people to turn into exactly what he saw them as. When Finn saw Jake as a good older brother, he caused Jake to appear to look like a humanoid with a varsity jacket. He later made Jake into a large eared, wrinkly old man with a cane after Jake shared wise words of advise.\n\nIce Jake\n\nIn the episode \"Winter Light\", shortly after entering the Ice Elemental section of Ooo, Jake began to speak depressing remarks as he grew an ice spike on his head. Shortly after this, the rest of his body turned to ice as he held his knees and continued to wallow in sadness. Although Patience St. Pim said that Jake would never leave, now having succumbed to her element, Finn took Jake anyway. After returning to the Cloud Kingdom, Jake returned to normal.\n\nSlime Jake\n\nIn the episode \"Slime Central\", Finn and Jake at first disguised themselves as Slime Elementals. However, after going into Slime Princess' body to retrieve the jewel from her crown, Jake became too comfortable and succumbed to his slime elemental transformation. This caused him to assimilate with Slime Princess until the end of the Elementals series.\n\nSoul Jake\n\nIn the episode \"Together Again\", when communicating with Peppermint Butler, Finn and Jake appeared to look like blue transparent spirits.\n\nFish/Mermaid Jake\n\nIn the episode \"Together Again\", Finn and Jake possess fish in Life's universe, causing them to turn into mermaids. At first, Jake appeared to look more like a normal fish, but was able to change his form to look more like a mermaid.\n\nQuotes\n\nSee Jake/Quotes\n\nSongs\n\n\"Home Song\"\n\n\"Where Is Finn?\"\n\n\"On a Tropical Island\"\n\n\"We're Finn and Jake\"\n\n\"I'm On a Boat\"\n\n\"Hobo Dreams\"\n\n\"Big Liver\"\n\n\"Lady Song\"\n\n\"All Warmed Up Inside\"\n\n\"Bacon Pancakes\"\n\n\"Three Nice Dudes\"\n\n\"Egg Song\"\n\n\"Broke Up\"\n\n\"Puppy Jake Song\"\n\n\"Jake & Lady Song\"\n\nReception\n\nJake has received mostly positive reviews from critics. Brandon Zachary of Comic Book Resources claimed that Jake is the best character on TV, stating that \"while Finn has experienced a strong character arc, Jake has proved to be far more fascinating.\" Dan Neilan of The A.V. Club claimed that \"Jake is the ultimate sidekick,\" stating further that \"Not only can he grow, shrink, and transform into any shape that might help his buddy Finn during battle, but he can also dance, sing, and make a mean plate of bacon pancakes.\" Richard Whittaker of The Austin Chronicle noted that he felt that the \"strong but emotionally vulnerable\" Cake was written in a way that successfully provided a female analog for Jake as a gender-swapped version. Cassidy Ward of Syfy mentioned of how \"bizarre\" the biology of Jake. Writing for Vox, Emily VanDerWerff called the series \"this era's finest coming-of-age story\", mentioning how Jake \"has moved from happy wanderer to something like adulthood.\"\n\nJake became popular among Adventure Time's fanbase. In 2019, Rich Goldstein of The Daily Beast commented on Jake's popularity among cosplayers, saying \"Halloween nights and comic conventions of the last few years have seen an increase in the number of children (and adults) all over the U.S. who wore Finn and Jake costumes.\" John DiMaggio recalled \"walking around at conventions and seeing everybody wearing their Finn costumes and their Jake costumes and how the characters endeared themselves to people\". A float in Jake's likeness was included in the 2013 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.\n\nTrivia\n\nJake is a Bulldog.[5] Therefore, his family and very likely the dog pictured with Bob are the same breed.\n\nOn the other hand, Pendleton Ward has several pugs.[6]\n\nJake writes a newspaper column titled Begs the Question.\n\nIn \"Daddy's Little Monster\" Jake is able to use his Stretchy Powers to change the shape and increase the number of his teeth.\n\nJake wears transparent pants spun from spider webs by pixies, as seen in the episode \"Donny.\"\n\nJake has an eye patch collection, as seen in the episode \"The Jiggler\"; however, due to the events of the episode, their condition is no longer mint.\n\nMarceline and Jake are the only people known to have called Princess Bubblegum by her first name Bonnibel.\n\nJake stars in the Double Rainbow promo where there are two Rainicorns as the double rainbow.\n\nAccording to Jake in the Legends of Ooo game, he does not like touching Slime Princess.\n\nIn the game Legends of Ooo, he says that he bathes once a year.\n\nIn the episode \"The Silent King,\" Jake reveals that his insides were cursed to smell like vanilla by a wizard.\n\nJake's gender/species-swapped character is Cake.\n\nJake has a bio suit in the game Project Exonaut.\n\nJake gets annoyed or even angered when Finn plays his viola badly, as seen in the episode \"Gut Grinder.\"\n\nBoth he and Finn are afraid of spiders as seen in the episode \"Marceline's Closet.\"\n\nIn the episode \"Return to the Nightosphere,\" it is revealed that Jake knows at least one Japanese phrase.\n\nIn \"Sons of Mars,\" it is mentioned by Grob Gob Glob Grod that he was prophesied to meet them.\n\nIn \"The Hard Easy,\" Jake has a pocket (in his skin/fur) when he kept the lollipop bag the mudscamps gave them.\n\nIn the alternate universe into which Finn travels at the end of \"The Lich,\" Finn's family pet is a non-magical dog named Jake that looks nearly identical to normal Jake.\n\nIn \"The Pods\" Jake reveals that his favorite food is ice cream.\n\nHe has been to 4 dead worlds: one in \"Sons of Mars,\" one in \"Death in Bloom\" and one in \"Ghost Fly,\" although in \"Sons of Mars,\" only his unconscious body is shown there and in \"Together Again\"\n\nIn \"Shh!\" and \"Video Makers\" (briefly), Jake writes with his right hand which means he is right handed.\n\nIn \"Princess Potluck\" Jake mentions that he does not like cats.\n\nIn \"One Last Job,\" Jake returns with his criminal group Gareth, The Flying Lettuce Brothers, and Tiffany to save Jake Jr. This tells us that Jake was once a real criminal as he says in \"Apple Thief.\"\n\nJake's behavior as a dog is running and standing with his legs and arms, barking (his usual voice is still heard), and wagging his tail.\n\nIn the episode \"The Pit,\" Jake almost refers to himself as \"Jay T. Doggzone,\" further suggesting that they may be the same person.\n\nAlthough he has an extremely powerful imagination as seen in \"Rainy Day Daydream,\" Jake is very bad at remembering things.\n\nAlthough in \"Still,\" Ice King mentions one of the things he knows about Jake is that he doesn't have ice in his drink because of his sensitive teeth, Jake has iced tea in \"Princess Potluck.\"\n\nAs seen in the episode \"Sad Face,\" Jake has an unusual multiple personality disorder, in which his tail is the 2nd personality of him.
