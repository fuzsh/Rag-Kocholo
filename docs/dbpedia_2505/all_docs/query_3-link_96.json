        "text": "With some 43 million native speakers, Spanish is the second most spoken language in the United States. This figure is mainly due to a large Mexican population in the country, which means that Mexican dog names should be widely understood.\n\nWhether it’s the deeper meaning behind them or just their Latino lilt, here are the best Mexican dog names for your chiquito canino.\n\nNames worthy of a muchaco\n\nWe’ll start by examining which Mexican and Spanish male names are suitable for dogs. Many soccer players bore the name Diego (Maradona was the uncrowned king of the game), so this name would go well with a playful and resolute mutt.\n\nFernando would be a great name for a dog strong as a bull\n\nOscar for an attention-seeking animal\n\nSebastián for a gentle flower, and\n\nEmilio for a dog you love dearly.\n\nThe list of famous male names goes on with:\n\nRoberto\n\nJavier\n\nAlejandro (Lady Gaga said “hi”)\n\nCarlos\n\nFrancisco\n\nAntonio\n\nJorge\n\nFabio (a common name in Italy as well)\n\nLuis\n\nManuel\n\nJuan\n\nJosé (could the last two names be more Spanish?)\n\nPedro\n\nPaco (for a peaceful pup)\n\nRicardo\n\nMateo\n\nPablo\n\nGabriel (a divine name)\n\nEduardo\n\nMiguel\n\nHugo\n\nAdrian\n\nWhen it comes to godlike names, then apart from Gabriel, we suggest:\n\nDavid (if you have Jewish roots)\n\nJesús\n\n(San) Salvador\n\nMartín\n\nSantiago\n\nModern names include:\n\nPoncho (yes, after the outer garment)\n\nSergio\n\nGerardo\n\nMarco (another Italian-sounding name)\n\nCaleb\n\nLeo (a good name for a lion-hearted pup)\n\nTomas\n\nEzra\n\nDaniel (pronounced differently than in English)\n\nJulian\n\nArturo\n\nLorenzo\n\nMany soccer players bore the name Diego (Maradona was the uncrowned king of the game), so this name would go well with a playful and resolute mutt.\n\nNames worthy of a muchacha\n\nWhen it comes to girl names:\n\nEsmerelda\n\nNina (a “little girl”)\n\nRosa\n\nFrida (after the lauded Mexican painter)\n\nCarmen\n\nRosalinda\n\nMaria, and\n\nLola\n\nsound the most Mexican. Then we have the international name such as:\n\nAna\n\nGloria\n\nElena\n\nSofía\n\nSara (for a wise lady)\n\nElena\n\nSelena\n\nJosefina also sounds French a bit and Antonia Italian.\n\nThe full list goes on:\n\nAdriana\n\nMartha (could be a patriotic name after George Washington’s wife)\n\nLuisa\n\nTeresa (a name many European women leaders bore)\n\nVerónica\n\nElisa\n\nLucia\n\nSilvia\n\nCuban-American singer & songwriter Camila (Cabello) has a catchy name, while Mira(nda) is a name for a pup everyone admires. Finally, there are:\n\nJuana\n\nXiomara\n\nAriana\n\nEstelle (the star of your life)\n\nLía\n\nCatalina\n\nGabriela\n\nAurora (the dawn of your life)\n\nAdalia\n\nVanessa\n\nValeria (sounds like a Roman matron)\n\nClarisa (did you watch the eponymous 1993 telenovela?)\n\nCuban-American singer & songwriter Camila (Cabello) has a catchy name, while Mira(nda) is a name for a pup everyone admires.\n\nFood-inspired Mexican dog names\n\nLet’s face it, every time you are thinking about which food to order, Mexican is among the top three cuisines.\n\nWell, Burrito and Taco are not only delicious dishes but suitable dog names.\n\nWould you like some Salsa with your Nacho?\n\nMargarita is a girl name that slides down the throat,\n\nPaloma suits a white pup perfectly,\n\nTortilla is ideal for a dog that likes to wrap around its owner,\n\nChurro befits a slender canine, such as a Dachshund, and\n\nTaquito is a name every small dog will wear with pride.\n\nThen there are:\n\nPico (for a canine with a reddish fur coat, perhaps?)\n\nJícama\n\nTamale\n\nQueso\n\nCarnitas\n\nBean(s) (another small-dog name)\n\nFrijoles\n\nFlan\n\nCanela\n\nEnchilada (for a pup with a chill personality)\n\nTajín\n\nCeviche\n\nMole\n\nHorchata\n\nPozole\n\nPoblano\n\nYuca\n\nTraditional Mexican cuisine is so multicultural that we could never complete the list of catchy dish names. We’ve all heard of:\n\nQuesadilla\n\nFajita, and\n\nGuacamole but\n\nElote\n\nSopapilla, and\n\nCotija\n\nalso sound like interesting dog names Finally, make sure your Tostada is Fresca (good names for a canine duo).\n\nBurrito and Taco are not only delicious dishes but suitable dog names.\n\nPlaces in Mexico as inspiration for dog names\n\nWhen we think of Mexico, we probably think of a vast desert but in fact, the country is home to all sorts of landscapes, from rainforests to rugged mountains. Charming place names in Mexico can definitely serve as inspiration for naming your mutt Cancún (for example).\n\nAcapulco is another world-famous name (and seaside resort), while folks will also recognize names such as:\n\nTijuana\n\nJuárez\n\nGuadalupe\n\nToluca\n\nVeracruz\n\nSonora (it’s also a state, not only a desert), and\n\nPuebla\n\nLesser-known Mexican place names\n\nThe Mexican countryside conceals many more names suited for a pet canine:\n\nReynosa\n\nDurango (suitable for a hunting and/or large dog)\n\nColima\n\nHidalgo\n\nMérida\n\nSaltillo (has a small dog ring to it, doesn’t it?)\n\nMazatlán\n\nEnsenada\n\nIxtapa\n\nCozumel\n\nDepending on your knowledge of Mexican geography, the list is virtually endless:\n\nMorelia\n\nChiapas\n\nChihuahua (yes, this breed has its own state in Mexico)\n\nOaxaca\n\nTorreón\n\nJalisco\n\nTabasco (a “sassy” state in the southeast of the country)\n\nBonus category: Mexican dog names with a deeper meaning\n\nApart from being widely spoken, Spanish is considered the language of love and passion, much like Italian or French. Mexican dog names, therefore, can have a deeper meaning, symbolizing the relationship you share with Fido.\n\nIf you find your pet precious, then name it Precioso or Preciosa.\n\nLoveable names\n\nSpeaking of passion, the following names articulate it well:\n\nBeso is a “kiss,”\n\nLinda & Lindo mean “pretty,”\n\n“Baby” is Bebé,\n\nAmor is “love,”\n\nCorazón is “heart,” and\n\nQuerida is a “loved one” – the ideal name for a newborn female dog (as well as Bonita – “the pretty one”).\n\nIf you find your pet precious, then name it Precioso or Preciosa.\n\nPollito (“little chick”) is another endearment term, as well as Alma, the canine “soul” of your life.\n\nFeliz and Sol are names for a dog that make you smile with happiness.\n\nGoofy names\n\nMoving on from loveable names, we present you with a selection of goofy names that may or may not refer to the physical traits of your mutt. Gordito/Gordita, meaning “chubby,” is by far the all-time favorite.\n\nPerrita or Perrito is perfect for a small dog breed\n\nHermosa is well-suited for a beautiful girl\n\nToro for a pup that charges like a bull\n\n(Son)Risa for a happy-go-lucky dog, and\n\nLoco/Loca for a mutt with a will of its own.\n\nMexican dog names aren’t just melodious but they convey a deeper meaning. Naming your family dog Diablo means burglars will think twice before jumping over the fence. Joking aside, we hope that you now have a wider pool of catchy Mexican-sounding names to choose from."
