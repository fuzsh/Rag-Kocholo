        "text": "Last updated on April 8, 2023\n\nStudying abroad in the picturesque Basque Country in the spring of 2012 has been one of the highlights of my young life. Bilbao was my first encounter with Spain outside of textbooks and audio tapes in my Spanish classes. The city ignited my long-term love affair with Spain, a fondness that is still going strong. But being black in Spain came with its own challenges. As a black expat, I couldn’t escape the racist attitudes and prejudices of some Spaniards, who need extensive schooling on cultural sensitivity, tolerance, and just plain decency.\n\nNot too long after I arrived at Universidad de Deusto, I learned that black soccer players were regularly subjected to racist chants at games against Athletic Bilbao. I looked into this phenomenon and discovered that racist chants were actually common at soccer matches in Spain. A fan once threw a banana at Dani Alves, a Brazilian soccer star who used to play for Barcelona. In another incident, the referee had to stop a match because the monkey noises aimed at Athletic Bilbao’s Iñaki Williams, who is of Ghanaian-Liberian descent, were getting out of hand. When I went to a Barcelona-Rayo Vallecano game in Madrid two years ago, fans seated not too far from me hurled racist insults at Neymar Jr. Racism in Spain definitely extends far beyond the soccer stadium, but is it something black travelers should be concerned about?\n\nIn addition to studying in Bilbao, I also spent 10 months teaching English in Madrid. I moved to Madrid in 2015 because all I could think about after leaving Bilbao was going back to Spain. I could go on and on about the wonders of Spain – the festivals, the lifestyle, the Moorish architecture, Tinto de Verano, Rabo de Toro...But I also think it’s important to examine the glaringly obvious yet unacknowledged race issue there. Beneath the colorful images of Flamenco dancers and valiant matadors, there is hostility, intolerance, and discrimination against black people.\n\nMy goal with this post isn’t to attack Spaniards or play the victim card. It is to address the concerns of black travelers who are skeptical about visiting Spain because they’ve heard countless stories about racism. I want to paint a complete picture of my experience in Spain to hopefully put those concerned travelers at ease.\n\nEveryone experiences racism differently\n\nYour perception of how racist Spain depends on your country of origin and your upbringing. Context matters a great deal. I’m a Nigerian-born, American citizen. Before moving to America at age 9, I had no concept of racism. While the legacy of slavery and colonialism lives on, race is irrelevant in a black nation with no white settlers like Nigeria. What matters is your ethnic group or tribe.\n\nUpon moving to America, my parents kept me focused on practical matters, such as getting straight As so I could get into college and go to medical school. I never paid attention to debates around race in America, and my experiences with white Americans in the suburbs of Los Angeles were mostly positive. That’s why I’ve normally dismissed microaggressions as a mere annoyance. What really irks me is blatant discrimination.\n\nDuring my 15+ months in Spain, I rarely experienced blatant discrimination. Most of the racism I experienced was in the form of annoying microaggressions, which I initially ignored. But after experiencing unwarranted hatred day after day, it began to take a toll on my self-esteem. I’ll focus on incidents that occurred during my second move to Spain because they are fresher in my mind. I want you to take this with a grain of salt. My experience is just that – my experience. It’s not necessarily representative of the black experience in Spain.\n\nThe incident in Valencia\n\nI was denied service at a tapas bar in the city of Valencia, in the eastern part of Spain.\n\nMy twin sister, Kosiso, our Chinese friend, Zulian, and I walked into the bar and sat down. We waited for the camarero (waiter) to take our order. He never did.\n\nSome elderly Spanish people walked into the bar and the waiter served them immediately. I thought maybe he did that as an act of deference. But after close to 10 minutes of chatting and waiting, I looked up and made eye contact with him. He gave me the mother of all dirty stares as if he was disgusted by my mere presence. Then he continued what he was doing.\n\nI was taken aback because I had frequented tapas bars around Spain without problems. Occasionally, I would get snarky comments, but I was never flat out refused service. That was the moment when I felt most unwelcome in Spain. First, I was livid. Then I felt sorry for that lowly piece of trash. You have to be miserable to go around filled with hatred for those who’ve done nothing to you. I wanted to rip that fool to shreds but took the higher ground. I wouldn’t stoop to his level. Instead, I graciously left the bar with my two companions.\n\nCo-workers were rude and unfriendly\n\nAt the elementary school in Madrid where I taught English, there was a group of 40-something female teachers who made it quite clear that they didn’t like black people. One time, I was sitting at the lunch table with staff and heard them openly mocking my Senegalese twists. They didn’t even bother to hide their disparaging remarks. I was sitting right across the table! I wanted to fight them so badly, but I also needed a job. Pretending I didn’t hear them, I continued eating. Looking back, I regret not speaking up for myself. Maybe I could have politely said that they were being disrespectful. At the same time, I wonder if doing so would have made a difference.\n\nAt the school, I really tried to get along with my co-workers, greeting teachers or staff in the hallways and playgrounds. Some of them would just ignore me. Others went as far as to roll their eyes and walk off. After experiencing this many times, I developed a new policy: as long as I was getting my paycheck on time (Spanish schools are notorious for paying teachers late) I couldn’t care less about those charlatans. Deep down, though, I did care a little. It was hurtful to be treated like garbage in a country that I thought so highly of.\n\nThere appears to be a preference for white English teachers\n\nLanguage assistants in Spain often supplement their income by offering private classes to the children of teachers at their schools.\n\nTwo of my fellow assistants, Fola and James, were respectable black men with college degrees. The third, Jonah, was a white man not much different in temperament to the other two. However, the teachers clamored to work with Jonah. When he was all booked up, Jonah referred the teachers to Fola and James. They were simply not interested. It was Jonah or bust.\n\nI brought up this issue with Fola, who had also worked at the school the previous year. Apparently, this was a pattern: the teachers always fought over the white language assistants. To them, minority language assistants were not fit to teach their precious kids. An alarming number of black and minority language assistants I spoke to told me similar stories. I wouldn’t be surprised if these incidents were part of a bigger trend.\n\nThere is a condescending attitude toward Latinos\n\nAt my school, there was a biracial Cuban teacher, the only non-Spaniard among the permanent staff. A kind and jovial man, he invited all the language assistants to his home for a Cuban dinner with his wife. He also took us on a day trip one weekend. Simply put: he was the only one among the older teachers who gave us the time of day.\n\nThe other teachers ostracized him for one reason: his Latino heritage. It was clear from their condescending attitude. They made fun of his accent and his mannerisms. They excluded him from teacher functions, like Friday lunches at a nearby bar. I guess it should come as no surprise that some Spaniards think they are superior to those from their former colonies, especially those with melanin in their skin.\n\nBus rides made me feel like an alien\n\nA considerable number of people, both young and old, would not sit next to me on the bus. You’d think I had two heads! Here’s a typical scenario: the bus is packed to the brim. Someone walks in, sees the seat next to me, looks me up and down, and then scurries to the back of the bus. You would think I had three eyes! If I got a dollar each time that sort of thing happened, I would be a thousandaire!\n\nIn another bus incident, Fola and I boarded a shuttle to drive up to El Escorial, a monastery right outside of Madrid. When we got on, Fola asked the driver if he was going to the monastery just to be sure. The driver ignored him, pretending he hadn’t heard the question. I then repeated the question, but he just frowned, shrugged his shoulders, and murmured something under his breath. This is a hallmark of racism in Spain: being as rude and unhelpful as possible!\n\nContinue reading: The 5 Friendliest European Countries in Europe for Black Travelers\n\nBlackface is a tradition\n\nSpaniards don’t see anything wrong with blackface. During Christmas, Los Reyes Magos (the three wise men) are the star of the show. Forget Papa Noel (Santa Claus). Balthazar, one of the three wise men, is an Arab but for some reason, Spaniards think he’s black. Every Christmas, Spanish men in every corner of the country put on blackface to portray Balthazar. I understand that Blackface is seen as just wearing a costume in Spain, but this is the 21st century. Can we get with the program?\n\nOn a popular TV show, Tu Cara Me Suena (Your Face Looks Familiar), Spanish celebrities regularly dress up as black artists and perform their hit songs in front of judges. It’s like The Voice, Blackface style. I watched impersonations of Ne-Yo, Stevie Wonder, and Celia Cruz. My gosh, they were beyond cringe-worthy!\n\nEvery region is unique\n\nEvery autonomous community has something different to offer, from the wine country in La Rioja to the pristine beaches of El Pais Vasco. Galicia, the last stop of the famous Camino de Santiago, has some of the best seafood I’ve ever eaten. Segovia is home to a real-life Cinderella castle; the Alcazar of Segovia was a source of inspiration for Walt Disney.\n\nMy favorite part of Spain is undoubtedly Andalusia, the southernmost autonomous community. This Morocco-esque region truly embodies the spirit of Spain and its traditions: the devotion to family, zeal for life, and fidelity to enjoying the little things. Andalusia is also the birthplace of Flamenco and, unlike in Barcelona, tapas come free with your drink! (That’s how it’s supposed to be.) Make sure you visit La Alhambra in Granada, La Mesquita de Cordoba, and El Alcazar de Sevilla. Those are some of the most beautiful architecture I’ve seen in all my 26 years.\n\nAfter Andalusia, I would recommend El Pais Vasco, the Basque Country. San Sebastian is hands down the best city for food in Spain. The pintxos (tapas) bars there are on another league. The main beach, La Concha, is easily one of the best in Spain. Bilbao, where I studied abroad, is another favorite. It’s much quieter than San Sebastian but is great for art lovers.\n\nIf you liked this post, please share!\n\nCheck out my Spain Bucket List Series to find out the best things to eat, see, do in every corner of Spain\n\nCulture: 9 Experiences You Must Have in Spain\n\nFood: 6 Dishes to Eat in Spain Besides Paella and Tapas\n\nPacking tips: The Ultimate Packing List for Your Summer Vacation in Spain\n\nTravel Tips: 10 Travel Tips You Need To Know Before Visiting Spain\n\nInspiration:15 Photos That Will Inspire You to Visit the Cies Islands\n\nOff the beaten path: 8 Underrated Cities You Need To Visit in Spain\n\nBeaches: The 10 Best Beaches in Spain You Should Visit Before You Die\n\nSolo Travel: 10 Unconventional Tips For Female Solo Travelers in Spain\n\nBarcelona: A Self-Guided Walking Tour of Barcelona"
