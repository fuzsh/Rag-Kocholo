We love all things French, including baguettes, fragrant cheeses, and movies about sad and aimless people. Also, mime IS art, thank you very much!    All kidding aside, let's get down to brass tacks. I have had a very rough go of it and do not have much experience functioning as a companion animal in the urban environment. A lot of the sights and sounds you take for granted are intimidating and overwhelming to me. I need an owner that will be my rock and guide me from a place of compassion. I am not a ready to go out of the box kind of dog.  Once I build trust, I do enjoy light pets on my head and cheeks  I have been known to enjoy treats. You can use them as a good tool to build trust with me. Psssst... hot dogs are my favorite.   To learn more about my specific needs, please read my  What to Expect  handout.   Mastiffs of any type, even the French ones, should never be viewed simply as gentle giants. We are large, powerful dogs that require a focused and attentive owner to provide what is needed for us to be the best dogs we can be. Therefore, we may not be the best choice for a first time dog owner. Someone very familiar with  canine body language  is a must for me.   I have been diagnosed with  ringworm . This will require continued treatment and isolation from other animals and children.  Allons enfants de la Patrie, le jour de gloire est arrivé!   The type of home I'm looking for:   I would flourish in a calm environment and a low-traffic home.  I am not the best option for an apartment or other shared living-type environment.   I must go to a home with a fenced in yard.   I need to go to a home without small children.  I would prefer to be the only pet in the home. I have no known experience with cats or other small animals.   I will need to  meet  any canine companions prior to getting adopted.  It could be with you!
