        "text": "We all know those people who have accounts for their babies or pets. Did you know even Hollywood A-listers take part in that, too? It doesn’t matter if you’re famous or not — if someone feels as though they’ve got some cuteness overload to share, there will be a page dedicated to that. We must admit, it is kind of charming for grown adults to run pages of cute content from the perspective of their furry friends. Some celebrities’ pets have enough followers that their accounts have been verified on Instagram, while others are still steadily climbing in popularity to gain enough followers to get that blue checkmark.\n\nFor example, Paris Hilton has an entire Instagram dedicated to all of her “fur kids,” called Hilton Pets (@hiltonpets). The heiress has more than just dogs, which most people don’t know. On her official website, the Simple Life alum has a page dedicated to all the pets she currently has and once had. This includes miniature pigs, ponies, ferrets, monkeys, cats, and bunnies — oh my! Paris even has a verified TikTok account with the funniest and cutest videos featuring her adorable pets.\n\nBenefits of Having a Pet\n\nStudies have shown that the bond between people and their pets is linked to several health benefits, according to the CDC. Pets can increase opportunities to exercise, get outside, and socialize. Regular walking or playing with pets can decrease blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and triglyceride levels. Pets can help manage loneliness and depression by giving us companionship. When cats purr, they emit a range of 20-140 Hz, which is known to be medically therapeutic for illnesses and lower stress. Most households in the United States have at least one pet.\n\nKeep scrolling to see which celebrities have verified Instagram accounts for their adorable pets."
