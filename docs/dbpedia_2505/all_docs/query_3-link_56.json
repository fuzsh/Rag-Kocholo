        "text": "Were you looking for Ferdinand (film), the 2017 film? This is the page for the the character. As these pages share similar names which are often confused, if an internal link led you here by mistake, do consider changing the link.\n\n“ It seems like from the moment you're born, people think they've got you all figured out. Based on how you look, how you talk, where you're from... But it's not that simple, especially when it comes to me. I'm a little bit more complex... I'm Ferdinand! ”\n\nFerdinand is the titular main protagonist of the film of the same name and of the book that the film is based on, The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf.\n\nFerdinand is a big bull with a big heart who would rather smell flowers than participate in bullfighting. He was mistaken for a dangerous beast and taken from his home to be made into a fighting bull.\n\nFerdinand is voiced by John Cena as an adult and Colin H. Murphy as a calf.\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nFerdinand's character design took a year and a half to complete, his fur alone taking three weeks. [1]\n\nBiography[]\n\nDays in the Casa[]\n\nFerdinand and his father, Raf, were from the Casa del Toro owned by Moreno, the latter being a fighting bull. One day, while Valiente, Guapo, and Bones were practicing bullfighting in a pen, Ferdinand emerges from behind a door with a bucket of water and makes his way, without getting seen or entangled in their fight, to a little red flower in the pen. He affectionately speaks to it and waters the plant gently before taking a long sniff.\n\nA truck, which Valiente calls the \"Winner's truck\", backs into the pen and Ferdinand asks what it is. Valiente replies with a snort, claiming that he knows nothing and proceeds to explain that the truck indicated that the matador would pick a bull to fight in Plaza de Toros. The other bulls start fighting and bragging and Bones is pushed to the ground by Valiente. Concerned, Ferdinand helps him up, only for the other bull to reject his aid.\n\nDuring this time, Valiente spots his flower and starts mocking him. Ferdinand is challenged to a fight but he refuses, remarking that Valiente can hit him if he wants to but not the flower. Confused and taken aback, Valiente leaves.\n\nSoon, the adult bulls charge out to display their fighting to the matador in the ring. Ferdinand and the other calves cheer for their fathers. When Ferdinand's father, Raf, wins over his father, Valiente scoffs and leaves Ferdinand's side. As they trot back to their own pen, he witnesses Valiente's father dismiss his son furiously.\n\nFerdinand trots up to Raf gleefully and the latter greets him by tossing him onto his back. He proceeds to talk about fighting for glory in the Plaza and that one day, Ferdinand would be a better fighting bull than him. Bashfully, Ferdinand expresses his reluctance for either of them to fight and asks if he could still win without fighting, to which Raf gently tells him that he wished life would be like that for Ferdinand. He promises to return and show him all of his secret moves, pressing his forehead against Ferdinand's and Ferdinand watches as he boards the truck.\n\nHe returns to his pen, only to see a fuming Valiente trample his flower and leave with his father in anger. During the rest of the day, he waits inside his pen for his father to come back but when the truck finally arrives at night, he excitingly crawls out of his pen only to find the truck empty; much to his shock and sadness. Then, Valiente's father coldly states to Ferdinand that his father was \"soft\" and that \"the soft ones always go down,\" therefore, demanding his own son to \"bull up\" after that. Spotted outside by one of Moreno's men and afraid of ending up like his father, Ferdinand escapes from Casa del Toro without hesitation and boards a cargo train headed for Seville despite the men's best attempt to catch him with a rope.\n\nDays on the farm[]\n\nAfter Ferdinand escapes the Casa, he finds himself alone somewhere in Seville one rainy night until he gets spooked by a distant barking he hears and tries to get further away until he slips off a muddy hill and gets knocked out as he sees two figures: a dog and a man, approaching before blacking out.\n\nIn the morning, Ferdinand wakes up to find himself inside a barn. When the door opens and he sees a small figure approaching, he gets a bit scared; thinking the figure wants to harm him. The figure is revealed to be an 8 year old girl named Nina who means him no harm. Nina realizes that Ferdinand likes flowers when he starts sniffing the flower perched on her left ear. When she allows Ferdinand to smell it and pets him gently while promising to take good care of him, Ferdinand begins to like and trust her. Then, Ferdinand is introduced to the other figures he saw last night before passing out who are revealed to be Nina's florist/farmer father, Juan and their pet dog, Paco. Nina takes Ferdinand into a field full of flowers with a cork tree at the top of a hill. Ferdinand begins to enjoy this moment as he sniffs flowers, chases a butterfly, and sits next to the tree with joy while admiring the view from there.\n\nAs time goes on, Ferdinand and Nina bond as they spend plenty of time together, which includes watching television, riding through Sunflower fields, comparing their heights, rolling down the hill, dancing, and feeding each other even when Ferdinand has fully matured; much to Juan's joy and Paco's partial jealousy.\n\nThen, one day, when getting ready to go for Flower Festival day in the village, he takes the time to greet Paco, whom he considers like a brother. At first, Ferdinand refuses to listen to Paco concerning the bad news despite his best efforts until Juan reveals the truth to Nina when Nina appears excited about taking him to the festival like every year given the fact that he's not a little calf anymore; much to Ferdinand and Nina's shock. After they leave while taking Paco in his place, Ferdinand sits by his favorite cork tree, confused as to why he can't go to the festival anymore despite his size and age. Ferdinand has a hard time making decisions about whether to go or not; knowing that if he goes, Nina will be happy leaving Juan disappointed for his disobedience but if he stays, Nina will be sad and Juan will be satisfied with his cooperation. To make things fair, Ferdinand makes a bet with himself. If an orange doesn't fall from a tree or a rock still stays in the same position by the time he counts to 3, he will go but to no avail. Finally, he tries to count to 10 before one of the chicken eggs hatches but when he notices it's about to hatch, he cheats by counting really fast and finally, goes to the festival.\n\nTime at the festival[]\n\nFerdinand's presence provokes a small twitch of fear in everybody; given his size except for a crying baby girl who takes a sudden liking to him when he starts making faces at her in order to cheer her up. Nevertheless, Ferdinand proceeds to join up with Nina while sniffing flowers in his path. However, when he finds Nina and though she is happy to see him, she reminds him that he shouldn't be here but when Ferdinand backs away while breaking free from a clothesline, he accidentally sits on a bumblebee, which causes him to bellow so loud, run, and charge out of control like a raging, wild bull; nearly hurting everyone while destroying things in his path. Thus, scaring everyone and giving them the assumption that he is a wild, dangerous beast despite Juan's best attempt to convince them that he is actually gentle.\n\nWhen the cops arrive to handle the situation, Paco tells him to get back to the farm while he holds them off but to no avail. Then, Ferdinand finds himself hiding in a China shop. Despite his best efforts to stay hidden while avoiding breaking stuff, he provokes a large sneeze when the elderly lady owner naively mistakes and uses his tail as a duster against his muzzle while cleaning dishes. This action finally gets him spotted, caught, and then shipped into a truck despite his best efforts to avoid getting in and Nina trying to convince everyone including the authorities that he is a gentle bull. As Ferdinand is driven further away, Nina, with her father and Paco in pursuit, tries to catch up with him but fails, thus, reducing her to tears and leaving her heartbroken.\n\nBack at Casa del Toro[]\n\nAfter a long drive, at night, Ferdinand suddenly finds himself back at Casa del Toro, the very same place he was born and ran away from when he was a calf. Ferdinand starts panicking while accidentally getting his horns stuck in the truck hole. Moreno thinks he's a beast \"going out of control\" and instructs one of his men to bring Lupe, the \"calming goat\" so as to \"calm him down.\" Ferdinand is introduced to Lupe as she tries in vain to calm him down but to no avail until he breaks himself free and out of the truck and accidentally lands on her, which he apologizes for and helps her up, after which she is surprised by his large size.\n\nFerdinand tries to explain to Lupe that he needs help escaping the Casa, but she thinks he means he needs help to become a fighting bull and thinks he is simply denying the things that happened to get him sent there. Ferdinand tries to follow her and accidentally breaks down a door, after which he meets Bones, Guapo, and Valiente, who are all grown up now and are joined by Angus, a bull who can't see very well due to his long locks covering his eyes, and Maquina, a silent bull who Lupe says was \"created in a lab\" and can neither say nor feel anything at all. Then, Ferdinand meets Valiente again, who isn't at all intimidated by Ferdinand's large size as he continues mocking and messing with him, and says that it will make him look better when he beats him to a pulp inside the ring, after which he sarcastically says: \"Welcome back, Ferdinand.\" and walks away in anger, leaving Ferdinand and Lupe stunned.\n\nMeeting the hedgehogs[]\n\nAfterwards, Lupe excitedly shows Ferdinand the stables he is sleeping in, which is the same one from when he was a calf, and is now extremely small and cramped for him. Lupe tries to befriend Ferdinand by coughing up a flower as a gift, feminine touch, and symbol of their relationship, after which she falls asleep with a bucket that she lives in over her head. Ferdinand tries to sleep despite her loud snoring and is soon woken up by three hedgehogs, Una, Dos, and Cuatro, who attempt to steal their food and the flower before being spotted by Ferdinand; much to their annoyance. He initially thinks they are bugs and is fooled by them into thinking they aren’t doing anything wrong, after which he is hit on the head by Lupe's bucket as she wakes up and gets into an argument with the hedgehogs. After Una pokes Lupe with one of her quills during the argument, the hedgehogs fall off the ledge and into the stables, where they try to attack Ferdinand, thinking he is going to eat them.\n\nFerdinand stops Lupe from antagonizing them and then explains that he isn’t going to eat them. Realizing Ferdinand is not like the other bulls around here, they decide to start over and introduce themselves. After learning about their supposedly deceased brother, Tres, Ferdinand lets the hedgehogs leave with their food (except the flower, which Lupe demands stays) and gives them a lift up to the window.\n\nAfter this, Ferdinand tries to sleep again, but is annoyed by Lupe's sleepwalking. He sneaks out of the barn and around to the other side of the building where he tries to cross an electric fence but is electrocuted, after which he meets the snobbish horses: Hans, Klaus, and Greta, who snobbishly tell Ferdinand that he can’t cross the fence or they will alert the humans, after which they go back inside, leaving Ferdinand alone.\n\nEl Primero's Arrival[]\n\nThe next morning, Ferdinand is woken up by an excited Lupe informing about El Primero's arrival, who accidentally steps on his tail, which causes him to scream and accidentally kick her into a wall, which he apologizes for afterwards. Ferdinand and the bulls approach to witness his arrival while Lupe explains to a reluctant Ferdinand that El Primero is the greatest bullfighter in all of Spain. Once El Primero arrives at Casa del Toro and when they learn that he has come to select a bull for his final fight, the other bulls except Ferdinand are excited but dismayed when they see that Lupe thinks this is her chance to train and make a fighter out of Ferdinand as his coach.\n\nThe Trial for El Primero[]\n\nA reluctant Ferdinand and the others are seen getting ready to show off their fighting skills and training for El Primero in the ring. After receiving a quick pep talk from Lupe, he is made to come out first by Moreno since he wants him to be the first bull to do so; much to the other bulls' annoyance when Angus calls Ferdinand \"the teacher's pet\" and Bones points out that \"nobody likes the teacher's pet\" to Ferdinand. Then, Valiente reveals to Ferdinand that he has been waiting for this day for a long time and states that it's going to get messy out there. When Ferdinand refuses to go out while unintentionally blocking the others' passage, Valiente pokes him on the rear with his horn to force him to get out there.\n\nDuring the trial, Ferdinand tries to avoid violence despite the other bulls trying to either hit or fight him and Lupe's encouragement. Then, Valiente challenges Ferdinand to a fight until Guapo intervenes. When Ferdinand tries to help Guapo up after passing out; thanks to Valiente messing with his head again, this causes Valiente and the rest of the bulls to foul up, therfore, causing an embarrassment to them and unimpressing El Primero, who decides to leave until Moreno asks him to reconsider, which he does for the next two days before his final fight in Madrid.\n\nUpset for not getting picked by El Primero, Ferdinand is reprimanded by the other bulls for making them look bad even though that was hardly his intention and all he was doing was just trying to help Guapo. When Ferdinand reveals he isn't a fighter, everybody is confused including Lupe; though this is barely a surprise and a bit of a shock to Bones and Valiente since they've known about his pacifism since they were calves as pointed out when Valiente still refers to him as the \"same, scared, little coward he always was.\"\n\nThen, everybody hears Guapo boasting about his \"success\" back at the trial to them as he is seen boarding a truck; assuming he has been picked by El Primero. But as they watch him leave, they realize that the truck he is boarding on is actually a meat truck that transports bulls to the chop house nearby if they fail to impress the matador and are considered \"soft\" as pointed out to Ferdinand by Bones when he asks him where they are taking Guapo; much to Bones' horror and shock and a fact which Guapo remains oblivious to for now.\n\nUpset, Bones blames Valiente for this because of messing with Guapo's head during the trial; a fact which Valiente tries to deny while stating that \"Guapo was never going to make it to the ring.\" When Ferdinand asks him if that's the reason why he deserves to go there, Valiente coldy states that things have changed around here ever since he ran away while pointing out that bulls are either considered as fighters or meat now. Then, he leaves after coldly referring to Ferdinand as \"meat.\"\n\nBonding with Bones[]\n\nThat night, Ferdinand stares out the window of his stables while thinking of Nina (who is also thinking of him) until he hears Bones crying for the loss of his friend but Bones tries to deny his crying to be due to allergies to pollen and that Guapo was more of his competition than his friend when Ferdinand expresses his sorrow for Guapo and mentions the word \"friends\" to him. But when Bones actually reveals how much he really cared about Guapo, Ferdinand reassures him that it's okay to feel bad about it. When Ferdinand promises Bones to keep this a secret, Bones begins to respect him; telling him that \"he's okay\" but points out that if he doesn’t want to end up like Guapo, he is going to have to start training seriously; admitting this is the one thing Valiente is right about.\n\nTraining and dancing[]\n\nThe next morning, Ferdinand observes the other bulls training in various ways as the hedgehogs, mainly Una point out to Ferdinand that El Primero is watching them while relaxing in the drinking water barrel until Lupe tries yet again to convince him to toughen up. Then, Ferdinand notices Angus charging at a barrel again, the same time a Bunny hops in front of it, which Angus can't see due to his long locks obscuring his vision. To avoid a disastrous collision, Ferdinand runs alongside him, shouting at him to look out before knocking him out of the way and nearly hitting Bunny himself. He manages to avoid him, albeit causing him to pass out while Ferdinand accidentally and temporarily gets his horns stuck in a water tank.\n\nFerdinand manages to revive the Bunny through cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, who quickly dives back into his hole in anger then angrily tosses a carrot at him despite Ferdinand's apology, which causes Valiente to laugh at him. Later, Ferdinand reveals to Angus that he was responsible for knocking him out of the way when he notices him inadvertently talking to a tractor. Ferdinand tries to make Angus feel better when Angus begins to worry that he could be next just like Guapo. Then, Angus reveals his \"terrible secret\" to him that he can’t see very well (which he says to a pitchfork that he thinks is Ferdinand). When Angus begins to panic, Ferdinand finally licks his hair up, allowing Angus to see well for the very first time; much to his joy. With his eyesight fully restored, Angus observes the things around him and finally manages to destroy the barrel.\n\nAngus states to Ferdinand that he has given him a fighting chance and asks why would he do such a thing despite their differences, Ferdinand replies that if they don't look out for each other, who will and states that his good act wasn't that big of a deal but in Angus' opinion, it was indeed. After Ferdinand and Angus have a quick bonding moment, Lupe takes Ferdinand aside to tell him another important lesson, which is to stop helping the competition. She tries to explain how bullfighting is like a dance, at which point the three horses: Hans, Klaus, and Greta show up and mock Ferdinand again for not being able to dance. When Lupe stands up to them for Ferdinand, Ferdinand simply proves them wrong by dancing pretty good in front of them; much to Lupe and the hedgehogs' amazement. When all three horses start dancing, Angus joins along in Ferdinand's defense. Then, when the horses insist on proving that they are better dancers than the bulls, Ferdinand and Angus are joined by Bones and finally Maquina while the hedgehogs turn on the music on the radio as they have a dance-off, with Lupe and the hedgehogs dancing as well. They eventually win and mock the horses as Valiente walks up and watches what’s happening.\n\nAs Ferdinand and the others celebrate and laugh over their victory on the horses (with Maquina smiling for the very first time), their happiness is cut short when Valiente intervenes to remind them that as they continue doing other things besides training and fighting, they will be sent to the chop house sooner than they think as he still continues boasting about being the one to be selected to fight in the ring tomorrow against El Primero. Ferdinand tries to object and offers to take them with him back to his home on the farm, but then Valiente asks him why they sent him back here in the first place if it was so great out there, but before Ferdinand can answer, Valiente unjustly interrupts him by pointing out that he is a bull no different from the others no matter what he thinks. Unfortunately, Valiente's statement proves efficient enough to convince the others to reluctantly and regrettably resume training.\n\nThen, Ferdinand talks to Lupe about escaping from Casa Del Toro and manages to convince her to go with him the moment he mentions his owner, Nina and the fact that she will love her if she comes with him, but when she points out that escaping from here is very difficult after gladly rejecting her former dream to train Ferdinand to become a champion bull, Ferdinand; remembering how the hedgehogs managed to slip through the horses' pen on the first night they met, decides to enlist their help in exchange for the flower Lupe gave him; much to her annoyance.\n\nEscape from Casa Del Toro[]\n\nThough reluctant at first, they agree to help when Cuatro is the first and only one to accept the gift in exchange for their help. Using one of her quills, Una unlocks the door that leads straight to Moreno's garage and into his house. Though this means trouble, the hedgehogs point out it's the only way to get out, so, Ferdinand and Lupe agree to go along with it. Despite difficulties like Ferdinand taking Una's statement of \"doing exactly what they do\" by rolling like a ball literally and both Ferdinand and Lupe accidentally starting up El Primero's car radio after sneaking in through the small garage window, the hedgehogs are able to provide a distraction good enough to fool two of Moreno's employees by dancing until Dos bites one of them on the finger after mistaking them for squirrels.\n\nLater, after resolving Ferdinand's balance problem in the kitchen, Ferdinand and Lupe discover a room full of swords, trophies, and worst of all, horns belonging to past bulls that actually thought they could win a fight against matadors including Ferdinand's father, Raf, which explains why Ferdinand ran away from the Casa the first time when he was a calf; fearing he would suffer the same fate as his father did. Realizing the truth, Lupe sympathizes with him and regrets her former dream as they proceed to the now-opened door. Nevertheless, this revelation makes Ferdinand decide to reveal the truth to the rest of the bulls just when Lupe and the hedgehogs are close to freedom so as not to allow them to suffer the same fate as well.\n\nFerdinand and Lupe head back to the stables to wake up and inform everybody about the truth. At first, they are skeptical and refuse to leave until the hedgehogs arrive with a pair of bull horns trophy to further intensify Ferdinand's evidence about the bulls' fates in the arena; stating that whether they get selected by the matador or not, they will all die either way. Nevertheless, Valiente, being the stubbornest of all bulls, refuses to believe his story and challenges him to a fight, which results in Valiente losing his right horn and being sent to the chop house and worst of all, Ferdinand getting selected by El Primero, who witnessed the whole thing; much to everyone's shock.\n\nRealizing what getting selected means for Ferdinand, Lupe states that they should get him out of here immediately, but Ferdinand refuses unless everyone comes with him, which everybody gladly agrees to. Nevertheless, when Ferdinand mentions everyone, he also means rescuing Valiente from the chop house despite their differences in the past.\n\nLater, after the hedgehogs trick and trap the horses inside their pen, Ferdinand and the others enter after Maquina chews off and swallows the electric wires of the fence and try to hold the horses off inside their pen so as not to alert the humans while Ferdinand goes out and up to the chop house to rescue Valiente.\n\nAfter entering the chop house, Ferdinand searches and calls out for Valiente until he finds him locked inside a temporary enclosure, waiting to be the next victim of the factory's deadly machinery. Ferdinand frees him and asks him to hurry up because they don't have a lot of time, but Valiente refuses to leave; given his recent state and preferring to accept his fate rather than to run away from it since he thinks it's over for him and still believes in the whole \"You're either a fighter or you're meat\" thing. Ferdinand tells him it doesn't have to be that way and that he's \"more than just a set of horns\" while offering him a chance to come back home with him as well but Valiente scoffs at the possible idea of sniffing flowers and paling around with goats. After Ferdinand points out that all this is his thing, he kindly tells Valiente that he can live his own life now unless he gives up. Then, both of them hear a voice in the place, which Ferdinand recognizes as Guapo's; implying that Guapo is still alive. When Ferdinand asks Valiente to come help out, Valiente simply refuses to leave and listen to him any further as he coldly tells him to go away. Disappointed, Ferdinand reluctantly leaves but not before stating that he was wrong about believing that Valiente was more of a fighter than a quitter.\n\nFerdinand finds Guapo hung up while trying to escape. However, when he tries to help him get down, Ferdinand accidentally and unintentionally activates the security alarm system, which activates the factory's machinery. Ferdinand tries in vain to save Guapo from being crushed to death but to no avail. Luckily, just before Guapo is close to sudden death, Valiente suddenly comes out of nowhere and uses his horn to disable a pole so as to stop the machine just in time from crushing him momentarily; much to Ferdinand and Guapo's surprise. Ferdinand acts surprised by Valiente's sudden change of heart and act of heroism, to which Valiente simply replies: \"Thought you could use an extra horn.\" When Guapo gets dragged away to proceed to further machines that turn bulls into meat in one direction, Ferdinand and Valiente proceed to further rescue Guapo before getting dragged along in the opposite direction.\n\nAfter all three bulls have been dragged through the mechanism while avoiding some deadly machinery, they finally get themselves iced in the freezer and then sent down and out of the factory and the ice as they roll back down in a cart to and break through the horses' pen.\n\nAfter rescuing Valiente and Guapo from the chop house and the horses are dealt with for good for now, the hedgehogs take command of the truck transporting the bulls and Lupe and drive further away from Casa del Toro after the humans have been alerted. On the way, they stop the truck to avoid hitting the same Bunny again, which Ferdinand brings on board as well for Angus (later, Maquina) to revive next, and then, continue to drive on with Moreno and his men in pursuit in his car.\n\nDuring the chase, the hedgehogs accidentally turn left after misunderstanding Lupe's sense of direction until they including Ferdinand and Lupe notice a low bridge on their way and duck to avoid collision while screaming, which somehow destroys the top of the cart carrying the bulls and the Bunny now perching on Maquina's head; making it a close shave for them.\n\nWhen Moreno and his men get closer and after Una manages to subdue them momentarily, which ends with Una being rescued by Valiente, the humans crash into a haystack pile in a field as Ferdinand and the company drive further away towards Madrid.\n\nEscaping to the train station in Madrid[]\n\nThe gang are stuck in a heavy traffic jam in Madrid until they notice Moreno and his men having caught up to them and decide to go on hoof to the train station that will take them to Ferdinand's home where he grew up in Seville with the hedgehogs riding on Ferdinand while the Bunny rides on Maquina. During the chase, Ferdinand is saved by Bones from getting caught by one of Moreno's men with a rope. At one point during the chase, near a restaurant, after Bones saves Ferdinand, Ferdinand catches some porcelain dishes and cups with a tray with great success to avoid greater damage being accidentally and unintentionally caused by the bulls. Then, the other bulls except Ferdinand, of course, are seen charging at a phony matador (a guy in a matador cutout actually). Later, Ferdinand can be seen enjoying some churros with his friends while riding a bus to the train station. At the station, after the hedgehogs watch on the board for which track to take, Ferdinand and the others follow them. Unfortunately, they are spotted by Moreno and his men and their passage is somewhat blocked. After Ferdinand gives Una a boost to locate the train headed for Seville, as previously asked by Una, and Una notices it leaving and informs them, Ferdinand and the others hurry to catch up with it. While the bulls push a cart to connect it to the train, the hedgehogs climb aboard to help with the connection and Lupe uses the train switch to get the cart onto the track that the train is on. As soon as everbody is on board the cart after it's been connected to the train, Valiente asks Ferdinand to climb aboard next but Ferdinand insists he climbs up next instead while dragging and pushing him up the cart by force and later, stays behind as Moreno and his men catch up with them. When Ferdinand sacrifices himself to save his friends and Lupe stays behind as well, his friends are saddened as they watch him get captured by Moreno and his men to be taken to the arena in El Primero's final fight while riding further away.\n\nThe fight in the ring[]\n\nAfter Ferdinand and Lupe have been brought to Plaza del Toros and before the fight begins, inside his temporary enclosure, Ferdinand listens to Lupe's words of kindness and encouragement even if it means having to fight his way out of this situation.\n\nWhen the door opens, Ferdinand comes out while Lupe stays behind inside momentarily. Once inside the ring, El Primero taunts him with his cape and commands in Spanish so as to push him into fighting him, but Ferdinand still refuses and is, of course, afraid to die. Nevertheless, El Primero then has the entire cuadrillas trying to push Ferdinand into fighting, but to no avail until one of the picadors pokes him on the rear with a spear, which eventually causes him to bellow and run in pain and charge straight towards El Primero's cape, therefore, giving him his \"fight\" and the admiration of his fans as well. Trying to avoid another spear from another picador, Ferdinand runs and charges towards the cape again, but the next time, while El Primero's back is turned, Ferdinand accidentally and unintentionally snatches the cape with his horns, where the cape remains temporarily attached on, which partially and temporarily blinds him, thus, causing a slight embarrassment for El Primero in front of everyone; much to the matador's anger. Slightly embarrassed and upset, El Primero tries in vain to recover his cape but Ferdinand keeps resisting, thus, rendering the fight more like a \"bullfighter fight\" instead until El Primero suddenly finds himself on Ferdinand's back after finally and momentarily grabbing the cape. Then, Ferdinand starts to panic and the fight turns into a rodeo; much to the crowd's amusement until Ferdinand accidentally and unintentionally tosses El Primero out of the ring.\n\nHowever, Ferdinand is now left to deal with a humiliated and enraged El Primero having stormed back inside the ring with banderillas and proceeding to try in vain to kill him, but Ferdinand still resists every attempt on his life until finally, El Primero accidentally and unintentionally scratches Ferdinand on his right shoulder, which drives him so mad as he bellows loudly in so much pain up to a point where he suddenly begins to retaliate in anger; much to everyone's shock.\n\nAt first, Ferdinand hesitates until he notices a flower under his hoof, thus, making him realize that he is becoming the fighter he was never willing to be at all. So, Ferdinand generously spares El Primero and proceeds to sniff the flower as El Primero walks further back away.\n\nAfter Ferdinand is done sniffing the flower, El Primero approaches and ungratefully proceeds to try and kill Ferdinand with a sword once and for all. As El Primero gets ready to deliver the final blow, Ferdinand unexpectedly surrenders himself to El Primero; much to everyone's confusion. Nevertheless, El Primero continues until the crowd, touched by Ferdinand's gentle nature and bravery, suddenly shouts for him to let Ferdinand live and spare his life and proceeds to cheer for him, thus, making history as the first bull to ever make it out of a bullfight alive by being himself.\n\nAfter El Primero, having regained his honor and respect, nods to Ferdinand and finally leaves the ring as he retires with honor and dignity, Ferdinand finally finds himself happily reunited with his owner, Nina and the rest of his friends having followed him into the ring as well so as to rescue him, thinking they are too late at first, as the crowd continues cheering for him and throwing flowers for him in the ring; much to his delight and joy. Impressed, Ferdinand's friends sit to praise him for his efforts.\n\nBack home on the farm[]\n\nAfter winning the fight, Ferdinand and his friends are taken in a truck by Moreno back to Juan's farm in Seville where Ferdinand grew up most of his life. Once Ferdinand and the others are out, Ferdinand tells Paco how much he missed him but Paco denies that he missed him; a fact which can be denied when Ferdinand points out to Paco that his \"tail doesn't lie\" when he notices his tail wagging after calling him \"brother\" again. After Lupe becomes the first to be welcomed on the farm and loved by Nina, Ferdinand makes his way into a field of flowers on top of a hill as he sniffs flowers and then, happily watches the sunset over Ronda from there next to his favorite tree until he is joined by the other bulls along with Lupe.\n\nPhysical Appearance[]\n\nFerdinand is the largest bull around, his hefty built giving him the appearance of a dangerous fighting bull, despite his personality demonstrating otherwise. Sporting shiny, smooth black fur, Ferdinand also has a beige snout and a pair of white horns.\n\nHe has blue eyes, surrounded by tan rings, and a tuft of dark brown fur on the top of his head. His built, composing of a large and muscular chest and smaller rump, makes him seem like the ideal bull fighter.\n\nWhen he was a calf, Ferdinand was much scrawnier and smaller. He had shorter stubby horns, slight buck teeth and large ears and often wore an excitable or depressed expression. Two short locks of fur stand on top of his head.\n\nPersonality[]\n\nFerdinand, contrary to the beliefs of others in the film, is a pacifist by nature. He enjoys calm and peaceful activities such as sniffing flowers and walking along the streets of Spain. He hates violence, which explains his aversion to bullfighting. He has been seen desperately trying to resuscitate a bunny whom he thought he had killed, which he succeeds at doing in the end.\n\nHe is also known as even-tempered, respectful, dependable, gentle, kind, sweet, caring, generous, independent, adventurous, determined, courteous, soft, and thoughtful.\n\nA truly lovable bull, he exhibits his big heart and love for people, which is often displayed as adorable awkwardness, curiosity and clumsiness. Such can be seen as he peeks from behind some balloons and gazes lovingly at Nina and his constant awe and wonder at everything as he travels around Spain.\n\nThis clumsy bull goes to the flower festival in town but after getting stung by a bee, he accidentally destroys part of the town (including a local china shop).\n\nAnother trait of Ferdinand's personality is that he never holds grudge and is willing to help others no matter what they did to him in the past, shown when he saved and helped the bulls of Casa del Toro with their respective problems even after they bullied him and treated him badly.\n\nAbilities[]\n\nFerdinand is endowed with great physical strength - being the biggest bull but he never uses it to fight, hurt or overpower someone, only to help others such as to lift a water trough over his head in order to water the flowers.\n\nAt various moments, his strength is also used to create a passage, like when Ferdinand goes to rescue Valiente from the slaughterhouse, he pulls the door off its hinges with his horns and opens the metal door as if it were made of paper.\n\nAnother clear demonstration of Ferdinand's strength is evident when he moves the cart with a single push so as to connect it to the train heading for Seville, probably in a sudden adrenaline outlet. After that, he turns and blocks the vehicle that Moreno and his men were using to chase them with his horns and obviously, with the help of his physical strength as well.\n\nRelationships[]\n\nNina[]\n\n“ Who's my good boy? You're my good boy! ” —Nina to Ferdinand [src]\n\nRaised alongside Nina, Ferdinand inevitably has a close bond with her. Ever since the girl was a child, they had been spending plenty of time together despite being a bit scared during their first encounter as a calf on his first day at the farm. This includes watching television, rolling down the hill, riding through sunflower fields, comparing their heights, dancing, and feeding each other. Their closeness prevailed even until Ferdinand matured.\n\nTheir bond is often exhibited via physical closeness and sentiments for each other. They are virtually inseparable in their childhood and when Ferdinand was captured, both of them yelled out for each other. Nina and Ferdinand both faced sleepless nights thinking about each other, the former staring at The Cork Tree where they used to hang out. While Ferdinand stares at the wall thinking of Nina's bedside.\n\nFerdinand, overcame with longingness, decides that Nina \"needs him\" and escaped to see her. They later reunited and greeted each other with a tight embrace. In various promotional material, Nina is seen pressing her head against Ferdinand's with her eyes closed, with her hands on his chin. This showcases their tight bond and trust of each other.\n\nPaco[]\n\nFerdinand gets along very well with Paco. He refers to him as his \"brother\", and gives him nicknames like \"Pac\", \"Pac attack\", \"Pac-man\" and \"Dawg\". One thing Ferdinand can't stand about Paco is his laws of nature speech which annoys him. Paco refers to Ferdinand as being \"normal\" which Ferdinand declines. However he was clueless on the fact that Paco was jealous of his bond with Nina. On the other hand Ferdinand can tell when Paco is lying whenever he sees Paco's tail wag uncontrollably. He basically ignores Paco when the dog tries to tell him that he can't go to the flower festival anymore, and tries to cheer him up after Juan told him that he couldn't come because he wasn't little anymore.\n\nWhen Ferdinand accidentally caused chaos during the festival, Paco told him to go back home while he stalled the cops. After Ferdinand is about to be in a bull fight, Paco alerts Juan about this. When Ferdinand comes back home, he tells Paco that he missed him. Whereas Paco claims that he didn't but Ferdinand smiles as he can see Paco's tail wag by telling him this.\n\nMaria[]\n\nFerdinand gets along very well with Maria, to the point that he tries non-stop to help Maria learn how to fly. He ends up shooting her in the air, but gets worried when she doesn't come down for a long time. Ferdinand calls out to her and panics for Maria. Luckily, Maria lands safely on her home by flapping her wings; much to Ferdinand's relief, and is happy that Maria can somewhat fly.\n\nJorge[]\n\nFerdinand gets along very well with Jorge, due to the fact that the rooster sleeps on the roof of the house's entrance. Whenever Jorge is asleep, Ferdinand happily wakes him up so the rooster can alert everyone on the farm to wake up with his iconic noise. His chant is referred to by Ferdinand as music to his ears.\n\nJuan[]\n\nThough Juan was the one more than kind enough to take Ferdinand in when he was a lost calf, not much is known about Ferdinand's relationship with Juan, except that Ferdinand was sad that he couldn't go to the flower festival upon reaching adulthood. Even though Ferdinand was clueless as to why he couldn't go, Juan knew the reason why Ferdinand couldn't come, because in reality, when someone sees a bull, they get frightened by thinking that Ferdinand would hurt them. Juan's fear was realized when Ferdinand came to the festival and accidentally got stung by a bee, which made him cause chaos and ruin property.\n\nAs everyone panics, Juan told them that Ferdinand wouldn't harm them. When Ferdinand was taken away, Juan was sad. Two days later, he found out that Ferdinand was being taken to a bull fight and went with his daughter to go save him from getting killed. After the fight, Ferdinand was happy to see his adopted family again.\n\nRaf[]\n\nBecause he was a calf that was rejected and had no closeness at first with Guapo, Valiente, and Bones, Raf was the only one who really approached Ferdinand as a friend and as his father.\n\nFerdinand showed concern for his father in relation to him to fight against the matador, but Raf assured him that he would return and so Ferdinand did not sleep waiting for his father to return.\n\nWhen the truck that took him, returns, he excitedly waits for him, but when he discovers that his father was defeated, saddened, he escapes from there; fearing he might suffer the same fate as well.\n\nValiente[]\n\nSince the time they were calves, Ferdinand and Valiente had no close friendship and Ferdinand was often Valiente's main target for bullying given his pacifist nature and despite bullying others like Guapo and Bones.\n\nValiente would often call him \"flower bull\" and threaten to smash his flower in order to challenge him to a fight, which Ferdinand refused and chose to allow to hit him rather than the flower; an act which confused Valiente and the others. Nevertheless, when Valiente's father wasn't picked to fight the matador, he ended up stomping Ferdinand's flower after all.\n\nLater, at night, when he found out that Ferdinand's father didn't return from a fight, Valiente somewhat showed remorse to Ferdinand in his facial expression but then refrained from it when his own father asked him to bull up before Ferdinand decided to run away.\n\n2 years later, after Ferdinand was unfortunately sent back due to an accident and misunderstanding back in his home town involving a bumblebee, though fully matured, Valiente still continued to show animosity of Ferdinand. The next day, Valiente threatened to hurt him during a trial for El Primero before being interrupted by Guapo's interference. After Ferdinand unintentionally caused an embarrassment for everyone when trying to help Guapo up due to fainting, Valiente continued referring to Ferdinand as \"the same, scared little coward he always was.\" Then, when Ferdinand was concerned about Guapo being sent to the chop house, Valiente warned him that things have changed since he ran away and that now, bulls are either fighters or meat while referring to him as meat as he walks away.\n\nThe next day, after Ferdinand embarrassed himself when trying to avoid hitting a Bunny and then getting a carrot thrown on his face, Valiente proceeded to mock him even more. Later, after the bulls won a dance-off against some horses, Valiente warned everyone that unless they resume training, they will end up in the chop house as well and refused to listen to Ferdinand's reason as to why they sent him back in the first place.\n\nAt night, after Ferdinand found out the truth about the bullfights when trying to escape, Valiente refused to listen to him and challenged him to a fight, which eventually got him to losing his right horn then getting sent to the chop house and Ferdinand selected by El Primero.\n\nThough their relationship was rocky, Ferdinand was still determined to save Valiente but the latter still refused to join him; given his state. Preferring to face his destiny rather than to follow his own as suggested by Ferdinad, he told him to leave him. However, when Guapo, still being alive, was close to sudden death, Valiente suddenly and unexpectedly rushed in to help Ferdinand save him, revealing that he has had a change of heart, which has put him on friendlier terms with Ferdinand and later, everyone else.\n\nDuring their escape from Casa del Toro to the train station in Madrid, Valiente proves to be more caring when he suggests that Ferdinand climbs next onto the cart they connected to the train headed for Seville as Moreno and his men were catching up with them, but Ferdinand pushes him up and chooses to stay behind to sacrifice himself in order to save the others.\n\nAfter the fight, however, Valiente and the others proved their loyalty when they chose to go after Ferdinand and rescue him rather than to continue with their escape to Ferdinand's home in Seville.\n\nBones[]\n\nSince the time they were calves, Bones and Ferdinand had a rocky relationship and Bones would often call him a \"Weirdo\" despite Ferdinand's attempt to help Bones up at one point after being pushed away to the ground by a bullying Valiente, who bullied Ferdinand more than anyone ever did before Ferdinand ran away one night.\n\n2 years later, after Ferdinand was unfortunately sent back due to an accident and misunderstanding back in his home town involving a bumblebee, Bones was the first to recognise Ferdinand as he was amazed by his growth spurt and suddenly regretted every time he called him \"Weirdo\" as well. The next day, after Ferdinand accidentally and unintentionally embarrassed everyone in front of the matador, which didn't get them selected for now, Bones was more confused than he was furious when he learned that Ferdinand was still the same pacifist not wanting to fight for glory in the ring he always had been since they were calves.\n\nRight after that, Guapo is getting in a truck, believing he was picked by El Primero. But to everyone's, mostly Bones', shock, Guapo was sent to the Chop House, but didnt realize it until he was already there. At night, Ferdinand hears Bones crying for the loss of his friend but Bones tries to deny his crying to be due to allergies to pollen and that Guapo was more of his competition than his friend when Ferdinand expresses his sorrow for Guapo and mentions the word \"friends\" to him. But when Bones actually reveals how much he really cared about Guapo, Ferdinand reassures him that it's okay to feel bad about it. When Ferdinand promises Bones to keep this a secret, Bones begins to respect him; telling him that \"he's okay\". Next day, while training, Bones nodded at Ferdinand before returning to training. When Ferdinand and Angus are having a dance-off against the horses, Bones, who hates the horses very much, joins the bulls, then Maquina joins in too. After their victory, Bones, along with Angus and Maquina, showed more respect and even a friendship with Ferdinand. But after Valiente told everyone they would end up like Guapo if the didn't train, they all left Ferdinand to continue training.\n\nLater, at night, when Ferdinand woke everybody up and told them that they had to leave immediately, Bones still remained stubborn, skeptical, and confused towards Ferdinand's plan as he and the others still believed they could win a fight once one of them gets selected by El Primero tomorrow until Ferdinand had the hedgehogs: Una, Dos, and Cuatro show them proof by bringing forth a trophy of horns belonging to one of the previous wannabe-fighters from the past who believed they could actually win including Ferdinand's own father, Raf, as discovered when Ferdinand and Lupe were trying to escape with the hedgehogs' help earlier in the night. Horrified to have learned the truth about the bullfights, Bones and the others changed their minds and took Ferdinand's side except Valiente, who still remained more stubborn than the others.\n\nAfter Valiente foolishly challenged Ferdinand to a fight, which eventually got Valiente into losing his right horn then sent to the chop house and Ferdinand selected by El Primero, Bones and the others were worried about what Ferdinand's situation will result to in the end. When Ferdinand disagreed to leave in order to avoid a terrible fate unless everyone came with him, Bones and the others gladly agreed even if what he meant by \"everyone\" also meant rescuing Valiente from the chop house despite their differences in the past.\n\nAfter rescuing both Valiente and Guapo from the chop house, escaping from Casa del Toro to the train station in Madrid, and witnessing Ferdinand get captured and taken to the ring by Moreno and his men, Bones and the others proved their loyalty when they chose to go after Ferdinand and rescue him rather than to continue with their escape to Ferdinand's home in Seville.\n\nBunny[]\n\nFerdinand is always concerned when the Bunny is around; especially since he doesn't want him to get hurt or killed. Examples are when Angus almost ran him over and when the Bunny almost got hit by a truck while escaping from Casa del Toro. Ferdinand saved the Bunny twice but only gave him CPR once, as Maquina revived him then, making the two friends as the Bunny can be seen sitting on his head later in the film.\n\nLupe[]\n\nAt first, Ferdinand found Lupe to be a bit annoying and was confused about her thinking he wanted to fight. After spending some time together, though, the two got along and became close friends. Even though Ferdinand didn't want to fight, Lupe gave him advice and was touched when he helped Angus with his seeing problem. When the two slept together on Ferdinand's first night at Casa del Toro, Ferdinand made sure he didn't hurt Lupe, however he did apologize to her after accidentally smashing her into a wall the next morning.\n\nWhen the other bulls were fighting each other during the trial for El Primero, Ferdinand tells her that he is alright because he is not used to violence but Lupe told him to hit something or the other bulls will hit him. After Ferdinand helped Angus with his seeing problem, Lupe also yelled at him to stop helping others. After the bulls won a dance battle against the horses, Ferdinand offers Lupe to come with him back to his home. Lupe refuses, saying their is no other place to go for a goat. When Ferdinand tells Lupe that Nina would love her, she asks him what love is. As Ferdinand looks at her, Lupe sarcastically says she isn't giving up her dream of being a trainer.\n\nHowever she decides to go with him back home and calls Ferdinand her best bud. She then warns that security is tight at night and that there is no way out. But Ferdinand while smiling tells her that isn't true, and they talk to the three hedgehogs for help escaping.\n\nShe is with Ferdinand when he unsuccessfully tries to roll towards the house (due to taking the hedgehogs orders to do what they do literally) and she is shocked upon finding out what really happens to the other bulls. When Ferdinand is chosen to fight in the ring against El Primero after unintentionally beating Valiente in a fight, Lupe is annoyed when Ferdinand decides to not leave as planned, unless everybody comes with him. However she and everyone else does help distract the horses while he goes to save Valiente, who was sent to the chop house.\n\nWhen everyone tries to use the train to escape at the train station, Lupe is shocked upon seeing Ferdinand risk his life to get captured, and as a result, she stays back with him.\n\nBefore he goes into the ring, Lupe tells Ferdinand that he has no choice but to fight. However she begs him to do it so he doesn't get killed. Lupe watches Ferdinand's fight and is happy that his life was spared thanks to the audience telling El Primero not kill him. When she and the other bulls move into Ferdinand's home, Lupe is happy upon seeing that Nina loves her.\n\nAngus[]\n\nOn the night that Ferdinand was brought to Casa del Toro, Angus took a sudden disliking to Ferdinand when they first met; stating he wasn't scared of him due to his size despite his hair locks partially blinding him.\n\nAngus expressed more dislikes of Ferdinand the next day when he was chosen to come out first for the trial for El Primero while referring to him as \"the teacher's pet\". After Ferdinand accidentally and unintentionally embarrassed everyone in front of the matador, which didn't get them selected for now, Angus was more confused than he was furious when he learned from Ferdinand that he was actually a pacifist and not a fighter wanting to fight for glory in the ring.\n\nThe next day, after a little mishap with a barrel and a Bunny, Angus, realizing he was doomed like Guapo once they find out that he can't see very well, shared his \"terrible secret\" with Ferdinand (which was his sight problem, as he thought nobody knew about it) and began to panic until Ferdinand helped him out by licking up his front hair locks. Overjoyed, Angus finally managed to hit the barrel and thanked Ferdinand for giving him a fighting despite the confusion as to why and began to develop love and respect for him. Later, Angus proved to be more loyal and defending of Ferdinand when he joined him in a dance-fight against the snobbish horses: Hans, Klaus, and Greta. After winning the dance-fight, Angus and the others celebrated their victory with joy before Valiente's intervention and were reluctantly forced to resume training despite Angus and the others newfound respect for Ferdinand, with Angus stating that Valiente was right about them being sent to the chop house if they don’t train hard despite Ferdinand's efforts to convince them to come back home with him instead.\n\nLater, at night, when Ferdinand woke everybody up and told them that they had to leave immediately, Angus still remained stubborn, skeptical, and confused towards Ferdinand's plan as he and the others still believed they could win a fight once one of them gets selected by El Primero tomorrow until Ferdinand had the hedgehogs: Una, Dos, and Cuatro show them proof by bringing forth a trophy of horns belonging to one of the previous wannabe-fighters from the past who believed they could actually win including Ferdinand's own father, Raf, as discovered when Ferdinand and Lupe were trying to escape with the hedgehogs' help earlier in the night. Horrified to have learned the truth about the bullfights, Angus and the others changed their minds and took Ferdinand's side except Valiente, who still remained more stubborn than the others.\n\nAfter Valiente foolishly challenged Ferdinand to a fight, which eventually got Valiente into losing his right horn then sent to the chop house and Ferdinand selected by El Primero, Angus and the others were worried about what Ferdinand's situation will result to in the end. When Ferdinand disagreed to leave in order to avoid a terrible fate unless everyone came with him, Angus and the others gladly agreed even if what he meant by \"everyone\" also meant rescuing Valiente from the chop house despite their differences in the past.\n\nAfter rescuing both Valiente and Guapo from the chop house, escaping from Casa del Toro to the train station in Madrid, and witnessing Ferdinand get captured and taken to the ring by Moreno and his men, Angus and the others proved their loyalty when they chose to go after Ferdinand and rescue him rather than to continue with their escape to Ferdinand's home in Seville.\n\nMaquina[]\n\nOn the night that Ferdinand was brought to Casa del Toro, Maquina gave a first menacing glare and grunt at Ferdinand; implying his dislike of him. Ferdinand was surprised at how quiet he was and shocked when he easily killed a fly just by blinking, saying that he seemed fun.\n\nMaquina expressed more dislikes of Ferdinand the next day when he was chosen to come out first for the trial for El Primero while grunting at him angrily. After Ferdinand accidentally and unintentionally embarrassed everyone in front of the matador, which didn't get them selected for now, Maquina was even more furious than ever as he continued grunting at him.\n\nThe next day, after a little mishap with a barrel and a Bunny, Maquina proved to be more loyal and defending of Ferdinand when he joined him and the others in a dance-fight against the snobbish horses: Hans, Klaus, and Greta. After winning the dance-fight, Maquina, smiling for the very first time, and the others celebrated their victory with joy before Valiente's intervention and were reluctantly forced to resume training despite Maquina and the others newfound respect for Ferdinand and Ferdinand's efforts to convince them to come back home with him instead.\n\nLater, at night, when Ferdinand woke everybody up and told them that they had to leave immediately, Maquina still remained stubborn, skeptical, and confused towards Ferdinand's plan as he and the others still believed they could win a fight once one of them gets selected by El Primero tomorrow until Ferdinand had the hedgehogs: Una, Dos, and Cuatro show them proof by bringing forth a trophy of horns belonging to one of the previous wannabe-fighters from the past who believed they could actually win including Ferdinand's own father, Raf, as discovered when Ferdinand and Lupe were trying to escape with the hedgehogs' help earlier in the night. Horrified to have learned the truth about the bullfights, Maquina and the others changed their minds and took Ferdinand's side except Valiente, who still remained more stubborn than the others.\n\nAfter Valiente foolishly challenged Ferdinand to a fight, which eventually got Valiente into losing his right horn then sent to the chop house and Ferdinand selected by El Primero, Maquina and the others were worried about what Ferdinand's situation will result to in the end. When Ferdinand disagreed to leave in order to avoid a terrible fate unless everyone came with him, Maquina and the others gladly agreed even if what he meant by \"everyone\" also meant rescuing Valiente from the chop house despite their differences in the past.\n\nAfter rescuing both Valiente and Guapo from the chop house, escaping from Casa del Toro to the train station in Madrid, and witnessing Ferdinand get captured and taken to the ring by Moreno and his men, Maquina and the others proved their loyalty when they chose to go after Ferdinand and rescue him rather than to continue with their escape to Ferdinand's home in Seville.\n\nGuapo[]\n\nSince the time they were calves, Guapo and Ferdinand had a rocky relationship as well even though Guapo never showed any signs of hostility or animosity unlike Bones and especially, Valiente.\n\n2 years later, after Ferdinand was unfortunately sent back due to an accident and misunderstanding back in his home town involving a bumblebee, though fully matured and somewhat shocked by his enormous size, Guapo tells Ferdinand that he isn’t intimidated by his \"freakish hugeness\"; either to display further animosity or to hide the fact that he is indeed scared by Ferdinand's size.\n\nDuring the trial for El Primero, after Guapo fainted due to Valiente messing with his head, Ferdinand rushed to his aid, showing care and concern for him despite all the things Guapo said to him. Ferdinand was even more concerned when he found guapo had been taken to the chop house for failing to impress the matador.\n\nLater, Guapo was actually more than glad to see Ferdinand when he came to rescue him after failing to save Valiente and talk some sense into him. They eventually become friends after Ferdinand and Valiente save him from the chop house. After escaping from Casa del Toro to the train station in Madrid and witnessing Ferdinand get captured and taken to the ring by Moreno and his men, Guapo and the others proved their loyalty when they chose to go after Ferdinand and rescue him rather than to continue with their escape to Ferdinand's home in Seville.\n\nUna, Dos, and Cuatro[]\n\nWhen Ferdinand first met the hedgehogs the night he was brought back to Casa del Toro after a little misunderstanding involving a bumblebee at the village, they quickly assumed that he was like every other bull around here: meat-headed, mean, and brutish; other than the fact that he was the biggest bull they had ever seen, and thought he was going to \"eat\" them when he caught them stealing his stuff, which provoked them to try attacking him with their quills.\n\nHowever, once Ferdinand reassured them otherwise, Una and Cuatro quickly realized he was different from all the other bulls while Dos still remained slightly skeptical and they decided to start over as friends. After being properly introduced, Ferdinand proved to be even friendlier when he offered the hedgehogs a chance to take some food if they wanted since he wasn't really hungry and a boost up the window despite Dos' slight reluctance and suspicions.\n\nAs days passed, the hedgehogs began to like Ferdinand much more even when he started displaying some interesting dance moves in a dance-fight against the snobbish horses as they helped out by putting on some music on the radio, which they stole from the unsuspecting horses' stables on Ferdinand's first night at Casa del Toro, to spice the dance competition up a bit.\n\nWhen they learned from Ferdinand that he was intending to escape Casa del Toro (again) at night, they seemed a bit confused and Dos demanded something in return for their help. Ferdinand offered them the toy flower Lupe gave him as a gift on the first night, which they also tried to steal at first. Though Dos refused, Cuatro accepted with pleasure and the agreement was settled.\n\nAfter learning the truth about the bullfights and Valiente got sent to the chop house due to losing his right horn in a foolish fight against Ferdinand, the hedgehogs were glad to learn that Ferdinand was intending to take everyone back with him to Juan's farm where he grew up most of his life.\n\nAfter escaping from Casa del Toro to the train station in Madrid while riding on Ferdinand's head at first and witnessing Ferdinand get captured and taken to the ring by Moreno and his men, the hedgehogs and the others proved their loyalty when they chose to go after Ferdinand and rescue him rather than to continue with their escape to Ferdinand's home in Seville.\n\nHans, Klaus, and Greta[]\n\nUnlike the other bulls that grew up at Casa del Toro most of their lives, Ferdinand's relationship with the horses have remained permanently rocky to this day ever since the night they first met as the horses have proven themselves to be quite snobbish and more stubborn than ever towards him including around other animals as well.\n\nA few days later, the horses started bullying Ferdinand even more when Lupe suggested he should think of the bullfight like some kind of a dance. When Ferdinand tried to prove to them otherwise, the horses challenged him and the other bulls minus Valiente to a dance-fight, which eventually got them electrocuted by the electric fence, therefore, losing the challenge.\n\nEl Primero[]\n\nWhen Ferdinand first met El Primero, the latter took no interest in him when he saw that he wasn't exactly fighting material.\n\nHowever, a few days later, after Valiente foolishly challenged Ferdinand to a fight and lost his right horn in the process one night, El Primero finally took a vast interest in Ferdinand, thinking Ferdinand was finally fighting material, and chose him to be the bull he's going to fight in the ring the next day; much to Ferdinand and the others' horror.\n\nThe next day, after Ferdinand was sadly captured by Moreno and his men and brought to the ring while escaping with his friends back home in Seville despite the others having escaped successfully, El Primero didn't hesitate to start the fight despite the latter's pacifism, reluctance, and fear of getting killed.\n\nEventually, after Ferdinand accidentally and unintentionally humiliated him during the fight, El Primero, in a fit of rage and anger, began to take drastic measures using banderillas to finish off Ferdinand once and for all. When El Primero accidentally scratched him on his right shoulder, Ferdinand bellowed loudly in so much pain up to a point where he suddenly began to retaliate in anger.\n\nHowever, Ferdinand hesitated at first until he noticed a flower under his hoof, thus, making him realize that he was becoming the fighter he was never willing to be at all. Despite sparing his life and after sniffing the flower, an ungrateful El Primero still insisted on delivering the final strike with his sword until the crowd, touched by Ferdinand's gentle nature and bravery, demanded he spare the bull and proceeded to cheer for him, thus, becoming the first bull to have ever won a fight in history.\n\nHaving regained his honor and respect, El Primero nodded to Ferdinand and finally left the ring as he retired with honor and dignity, never to be seen or heard from again.\n\nMoreno[]\n\nLittle is known about Ferdinand's relationship with Moreno despite having been born at the latter's establishment in his youth.\n\nHowever, the night Ferdinand ran away from Casa del Toro after learning about his father's death, Moreno tried to stop Ferdinand from escaping before sending out his men to finish the job instead.\n\nTwo years later, when Ferdinand was sent back after a little misunderstanding at the village in Seville where he grew up most of his life, Moreno, though having failed to recognize him as his missing bull, quickly took him for a \"monster trying to tear the truck apart\" when Ferdinand was actually panicking and struggling and after he saw how big Ferdinand was when finally coming out of the truck.\n\nThe next day when El Primero came to select a bull for his final fight, Moreno insisted Ferdinand be the first one to enter the ring and demonstrate his \"fighting skills\", thinking he would be the perfect one for the matador to fight; given his size and false reputation.\n\nThe very next night, after Ferdinand was finally chosen by El Primero due to a misunderstanding involving a fight with Valiente and after Ferdinand and his friends escaped Casa del Toro, Moreno was more than determined to get Ferdinand back for El Primero on account of El Primero threatening to fight him in the ring if he loses \"his bull.\"\n\nDuring the chase from Casa del Toro to Madrid and through the streets of Madrid, Moreno and his men never gave up pursuing Ferdinand mostly and his friends. Finally, after Ferdinand sacrificed himself to save the others with Lupe staying behind as well, Moreno and his men captured and dragged him mercilessly into the truck and straight to the ring where El Primero was preparing to fight him.\n\nDuring the fight, however, Moreno changed from rooting for El Primero to rooting for Ferdinand up to a point where he and the rest of the crowd did not want the bull to be slain in the end; given the latter's obvious pacifistic, kind, and gentle nature as demonstrated when he spared El Primero's life due to a misunderstanding.\n\nTouched by Ferdinand's kindness and courage and especially, his reunion with his owner, Nina and his friends who somehow returned to the ring to save him, Moreno generously returned Ferdinand and his friends back to Juan's farm in Seville before finally returning to his establishment, never to be seen or heard from again.\n\nMemorable Quotes[]\n\nBy Ferdinand[]\n\n“ I'm not gonna fight you, Valiente. ” —Ferdinand refusing to fight Valiente [src]\n\n“ You can hit me if you want, but leave the flower alone. ” —To Valiente threatening to fight him [src]\n\n“ Can I be a champ without fighting, maybe? ” —To his father [src]\n\n“ I'm not a fighting bull. ” —To Una [src]\n\n“ Nina needs me.
