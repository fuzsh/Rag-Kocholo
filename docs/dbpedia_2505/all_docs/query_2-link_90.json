        "text": "Galapagos penguin\n\nbird\n\nGalapagos penguin, (Spheniscus mendiculus), species of penguin (order Sphenisciformes) characterized by the presence of a narrow C-shaped band of white feathers that extends from the eye to the chin on each side of the head and a single band of black feathers that cuts across the large region of white feathers on the breast. Galapagos penguins, the most northerly of all penguin species, inhabit the western part of the Galapagos Islands; however, some individuals may occasionally venture to other islands in the archipelago. Compared with other penguin species, the population is small, numbering no more than a few thousand individuals.\n\nPhysical features\n\nGalapagos penguins are among the smallest of all penguin species. They average about 53 cm (about 21 inches) in length and weigh from 1.7 to 2.6 kg (about 4–6 pounds), males being slightly larger than females. As in other members of the genus Spheniscus, plumage covering the chin and back is black, and most of the breast plumage is white. However, the C-shaped strips of white feathers on the sides of the head are much thinner than those present on African (S. demersus), Humboldt (S. humboldti), and Magellanic (S. magellanicus) penguins. Juveniles, in contrast, have a gray head and back and white underside. They also possess white patches of feathers on their cheeks. The chicks are covered in a fluff of light gray downy feathers.\n\nPredators and prey\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nUltimate Bird Trivia Quiz\n\nGalapagos penguins subsist on small fish, such as pilchards (sardines) and mullet, and possibly crustaceans. Galapagos penguins often hunt in groups; they pursue their prey in the water and capture them from the side or from below. Adults and juveniles are food for sharks and Galapagos fur seals (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) in the water. On land all age classes are vulnerable to the native Galapagos hawk (Buteo galapagoensis) and to introduced predators—such as dogs, cats, rats, and other birds of prey.\n\nNesting and breeding\n\nMore than 95 percent of all breeding takes place on the islands of Isabela, Fernandina, and Santa Cruz on the western end of the Galapagos archipelago. There are also small colonies on Bartolomé, Santiago, Logie, and Floreana. Young are produced throughout the year, and nests are built with rocks and twigs or within lava rock depressions within about 50 metres (about 165 feet) of the shoreline. Most breeding pairs are monogamous for life, and prolific pairs can produce up to three clutches of eggs per year, with females often laying two eggs per clutch.\n\nThe eggs are deposited in the nest within four days of one another, and incubation is shared equally between the parents. The incubation period lasts 38–42 days, after which both parents provide for their chicks by alternating feeding and guarding duties on a daily basis until the chicks are 30 days old. The chicks continue to remain in the nest when they are between 30 and 60 days of age, sustained by periodic feedings by their parents. Unlike most other penguin species, Galapagos penguin chicks do not join “crèches” (groups). The fledging period continues until the chicks are 60–65 days old, and they become completely independent at age 3–6 months. Galapagos penguins can live as long as 15–20 years, but most succumb to predation or to food shortages caused by the periodic, but dramatic, changes in nearby ocean currents.\n\nConservation status\n\nGalapagos penguins are extremely susceptible to disruptions in food availability caused by strong El Niño episodes. During normal years or during La Niña years, the upwelling of the cold, northward-flowing Peru Current brings nutrients to the surface waters. During years dominated by El Niño, however, the warmer surface waters hold fewer nutrients, because upwelling is dampened. Under these conditions, plankton populations are low and fish stocks decline. The strong El Niño episodes of 1982–83 and 1997–98 correlated with sudden crashes in the Galapagos penguin population. Although the population recovered from those events, the pace of recovery was often slow because female mortality tends to be higher than male mortality in such years. In addition, feral cats, introduced from the mainland, kill many adult Galapagos penguins on Isabela and Fernandina annually. Some ecologists fear that avian malaria carried by the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus could devastate the remaining Galapagos penguin population, because most other penguin species are susceptible to the disease. Galapagos penguins have been listed as endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species since 2000.\n\nJohn P. Rafferty"
