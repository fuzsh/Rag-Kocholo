        "text": "For Callen, the bourgeois spectator saw Degas’s Little Dancer as his own moral “antithesis,” for a “cathartic effect” like terror before the sublime, in order to reinforce the ideological controls for his class.[13] Hargrove sees Degas’s critique of his male peers who pursue dancers for sex: Little Dancer, she proposes, parodies a venerated devotional type, yielding an effigy of a “Madonna of Vice” to “tweak” men for contributing to France’s presently compromised morality.[14] For Druick, Degas inserted Little Dancer especially into the debates about the effect of heredity and environment on France’s social malaise by 1870.[15] In this context, Druick links the wax to Degas’s Criminal Physiognomies with a new ambiguity, proposing that the documented lives or faces of the criminals fit neither criterion (heredity or environment), so Degas altered their portraits in his pastel physiognomies to suit scientific theories, yet left any cues about their fate unclear. Degas, Druick argues, portrayed his own ambivalence, as an engaged citizen whose views about heredity and environment were shaped by his class. Druick feels that the artist left the dancer’s future even more open, so that it could include improvement brought about by education and social reform.[16] Thus, the pastels of the teenage criminals could represent the fourteen-year-old girl’s peers, if she kept true to type, or her antithesis, if she moved above her inherited world.\n\nA contemporary literary example seems especially relevant here, Émile Zola’s naturalist two-part saga L’ Assommoir (1877) and Nana (1880), texts that critics frequently invoked in discussions of Degas’s entries of 1881 and that explore the unstable interplay of heredity, environment, and circumstance. In the first of several “threshold” moments, at the beginning of L’ Assommoir, the young, beautiful Gervaise considers her prospects: “Her dream was to live amongst good people because bad society, said she, was like the blow of a bludgeon [assommoir] — it cracked one’s skull, it would lay a woman on her back in no time. She fell into a cold sweat at the thought of the future, and compared herself to a coin tossed up in the air and coming down head or tail, according to how it struck the ground.”[17] Against her grim assessment of the two possible paths determined by chance, Gervaise’s eventual downfall seems less predetermined than a bad toss of the coin.\n\nDruick’s argument that Degas leaves the dancer’s fate unclear, for whatever reason, accords well with the range of critical views of the girl’s lineage, current influences, and prospects. Ephrussi sees her as genetically predetermined; the Comtesse Louise perceives a teenage Nana, Gervaise’s daughter who becomes a courtesan.[18] Mantz condemns, among other things, a corrupt environment: for him, Little Dancer unmasks the Opéra’s moral threat even to respectable girls who may fall prey to its influence.[19] De Villars, however, sees only untainted promise. For her, Little Dancer is an Ugly Duckling, awkward with adolescence and deformed by her training, who would eventually dance gracefully and enjoy the “royal” beauty promised by her features.[20] For its first viewers, then, this controversial sculpture of a modern adolescent social type may not have suggested any single future, indicative of both the figure’s ambiguous rendering and the splintered views of its public.\n\nIf Degas meant to direct Little Dancer’s reading by framing it with related subjects (his pastel Criminal Physiognomies in 1880 / 1881 and, for its projected 1880 venue, the reworked Young Spartan Girls Provoking the Boys, 1860, oil on canvas, National Gallery, London, apparently not exhibited), then more questions emerge from Degas’s additional entries in 1881 that present other modern urban female types: a dancer embracing a subscriber in the coulisses, a laundress, cabaret singers, and portraits, the most often commented upon among them a decorative frieze of fashionable women.[21] Such a survey of modern Parisians raises new possibilities about heredity, environment, and chance to consider with the Criminal Physiognomies and Little Dancer, especially with their equal prominence in the exhibition. This fledgling dancer — whether socially base, temporarily awkward, or devoted to her career — might become one of the fashionable as well as the backstage siren.\n\nComplicating the picture, Degas’s sonnet “Petite danseuse,” thought to have been written c. 1889, after he exhibited Little Dancer, pleas for her professional success with a startling condition:\n\nIf Montmartre provided her spirit and her forebears\n\nRoxelane[22] [provided] her nose and China her eyes,\n\nIn turn, Ariel, give this recruit [to the dance]\n\nYour light steps for daytime, your light steps for night . . .\n\nBut for my known taste! may she be aware of her special qualities\n\nand preserve her street breeding at the golden palace [the Opéra].[23]\n\nDegas expects a glorious professional future for this young and talented girl but fears it might strip her of qualities that he cherishes in Paris’ exotic, rather than loathsome, street society. Does this sonnet explain his sculpture or at least convey a similar view?"
