        "text": "As Cat Power, Chan Marshall has spent more than 20 years making dreamy music, music that would sound great in an empty dive bar in the South as you look at the sunlight reflected in a glass of bourbon you’re too hypnotized to drink. Music that would sound great reverberating from a room in the back of a house, gliding around walls. Her new album, Wanderer, is her 10th, and her first in six years. It was prompted by the death of a friend, but it’s not a sad album. It’s a searching album about life and survival and, like all of her music, it’s hard-traveled and bone-deep soulful.\n\nAs I wait in the dark, ornate lobby of Hollywood’s Chateau Marmont, I’m told Marshall is ready for me. I go past a gate to the piercing sunlight of the hotel courtyard, where Marshall guides me through the maze of bungalows to the one where she’s staying. On the way, she tells me about how she was supposed to record a song with Johnny Cash, but it didn’t happen. She also tells me about a dream she had where she met Johnny in a diner, and he told her his wife June bore him a son, and the son’s name was Icarus. We find her bungalow and sit down.\n\nThe room is hot and muggy, shockingly so, and there’s a lot of energy in the air. Not just because Marshall is rapidly walking to and fro, plugging things in, taking clothes out of her suitcase, or because a photographer is about to come in and set up equipment. It’s also because Marshall is talking as fast as she can manage, juggling five or six thoughts at once and trying not to let any of them fall away. She’s working hard.\n\nAs our conversation goes on, as she makes iced tea and discusses the musical influences of her Georgia childhood in the 1970s, I notice her voice begin to drift south. It’s something in the melodies of her sentences, the way she says “pecans,” the offhanded mentions of tobacco towns, the asides about “smokin’ and drinkin’.” By the time she lights her first cigarette, we’re not in Hollywood anymore, we’re in Atlanta.\n\n“Salty Dog Blues” (Traditional)\n\nI just remember a couple songs from that age. I was raised by my grandmother until I was around 5, and she sang “Salty Dog” when we’d be shelling pecans, splitting beans, or peeling clementines. She liked it when I sang “Salty Dog,” so I sang it to her for maybe 10 years of my childhood. I knew it through my grandmother [and later covered it]—I looked it up last night because I didn’t know if it was a real song or not. I’d never heard it was called “Salty Dog Blues.” To me, it was just “Salty Dog,” a song my grandmother would sing, that I learned to sing, that I sang to her.\n\nWhodini: “Freaks Come Out at Night”\n\nI lived on the side of this highway across from a gas station, and we didn’t have much. But I had a Whodini cassette and that’s what I had. That was what I listened to. There’s so much music I knew as a kid because of DJs. It’s not like now, with the pre-programmed radio. There was always a DJ playing albums and taking requests! That’s where I heard Whodini, and I loved “Freaks Come Out at Night.” I loved other things, but I couldn’t buy other things. I had that cassette and I loved it because I had it! I had neon parachute pants and I was in this tobacco town, and I was a total freak.\n\nI had also heard about that song from roller skating. I was always roller skating as a little kid in Atlanta. Around then, I moved about six times, back and forth, in and out. And when I started moving around, I would go roller skating. I’d always go alone. Sometimes I’d make a friend, but when you’re moving all the time it’s hard to make friends.\n\nWhen I was around 12, we were in this Atlanta suburb, Sandy Springs, in an apartment building called The Lodge. It was a big swingers apartment, which I didn’t know. One day, I turned on PBS and saw this file footage, and it was Aretha Franklin. I knew who Aretha Franklin was, but I’d never seen this history before. The camera was real close-up, and I thought she was crying. She probably was. It was so much. She had a tiara on, her hair was up, an empire waist. She’s got this band here, her magic band, her skin, her flesh, all the sound coming out. The camera panned out, and it was this big theater, and I noticed everybody there was very fancy and white. Then it panned back to her face. I had been singing “Amazing Grace” since I was a little kid, but watching the physicality of her singing live, really watching, I saw something different. I saw the spirituality, her connection with life itself, this life-force energy, and suddenly I started crying. I was just weeping because I had discovered some kind of truth. I was forever changed by that performance.\n\nFlat Duo Jets\n\nI tried to buy certain albums by certain bands, and I was never let down, but the physicality of energy transference with some live bands shifted the core of my being. When I was 16, I went to go see the Cramps in Atlanta. Flat Duo Jets went on before them, and I didn’t give a shit about the Cramps that day. It was great to see these legends that everyone loves, but when I saw and heard Flat Duo Jets with Dexter Romweber, all my dreams came true. I had an appreciation for a certain kind of historical music, and then I discovered someone who’s nailing down all that history, who’s with me. When you’re at a show like that, you don’t think anything, you’re just learning, and all your senses are thriving. You’re consumed. As I grew up, I kept searching and searching for albums with that, but it’s very hard to find that on an album.\n\nThe Rolling Stones: Sticky Fingers\n\nI knew I couldn’t be in Atlanta anymore because I’m not stupid. I know in life we make stupid choices, but I thought I was probably going to make a really bad choice if I decided to stay in Atlanta and hang out with my friends and do heroin, so I decided not to stay there anymore. I didn’t know that heroin had already gone up to New York, because I was young.\n\nIn 1992, when I was 20, I was livin’ in New York and I had a friend who passed from AIDS, and my boyfriend was a junkie, and my best friend was a junkie, and another friend was a junkie—things were very grim. And Sticky Fingers was one of my records.\n\nMy boyfriend, who I love very much, just out of the blue was like, “I’m leavin’, the car is packed.” With no warning or whatever. That feeling of abandonment—I just played “I Got the Blues” for a month solid. And “Sway” was huge for me, because it became a totem when I left Atlanta. Even if my friends did end up in the dust, which they did, that record just has a lot of weight.\n\nBob Dylan: “Moonshiner”\n\nI was in a lover’s bedroom, and the Bootleg Series had just come out. I hadn’t gotten it yet, and he played it. I was so in love with this person who was so abusive. I just came to terms with it recently. He was a good man, he just had a lot of demons. He put this on, and it validated my pain, and listening somehow took the pain away. “Moonshiner” was the softest bed I could ever lie on. I felt validated, realized.\n\nHot Boys: Guerrilla Warfare\n\nI loved to dance and roller-skate when I was younger, so I heard a lot of funky shit growing up. And when I heard the Hot Boys, my reaction was instant. Rhythmically, hypnotically, the storyline, the camaraderie, the messages, the slang. And the reality of a song like “Tuesday & Thursday,” talking about when you get your check, from the government or work, how your whole life equates to Tuesdays and Thursdays. You got so much work to do, so many bills to pay, you gotta make that shit last. At that time there was so much music that my friends were making that had no groove in it, so I just wanted something I could fuckin’ move to.\n\nMiles Davis: Ascenseur pour l’échafaud Soundtrack\n\nA friend of mine, [filmmaker] Jem Cohen, had told me about this director named Louis Malle; I had never watched his movies, but I remember seeing an album that had his name on it, and it was a soundtrack by Miles Davis. I bought it and from the moment that I played it, I couldn’t put it away. Side A, Side B, Side A, Side B, Side A, Side B. That album is one of the greatest things I’ve ever heard in recorded music.\n\nMiles helped me fucking relax, but I was going through so many family and business and physical health problems. Before I had a nervous breakdown, I had been listening to that record pretty solidly for months. And then when I came out of that darkness, The Breakthrough by Mary J. Blige pulled me out.\n\nWhen I was listening to The Breakthrough, I was sober for the first time—I was a little kid drinkin’ beer at 5 years old, smokin’ at 6, that’s the way the world was for me. It was what everyone in the goddamn room was doing, and no one was fuckin’ payin’ attention to me, and I wanted to be like everybody else I admired, the adults. Those albums are really important as bookends to my mid-30s, to survival.\n\nNina Simone: “Funkier Than a Mosquito’s Tweeter”\n\nThis is when I was on the Sun tour. I was working, got really sick, left everything, and just started playing solo again, wanting to write and sing new songs, continue my path, tell stories, so I wasn’t listening to music. But because I was working so hard and I needed something to keep me going, discovering Nina Simone singing this song was fucking incredible. When you drive around L.A., you fucking play that shit."
