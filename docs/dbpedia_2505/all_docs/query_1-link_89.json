        "text": "With an aim to identify the characteristics of the best foraging areas for black guillemots (Cepphus grylle), researchers in SEAPOP have studied foraging behaviour and habitat use of black guillemots at three breeding locations along the Norwegian coast. Although differences in foraging activity and habitat use were found, one parameter in particular stood out as the most important.\n\nPeatlands are superstars that are literally and figuratively stepped on. But they store huge amounts of carbon – and a few bog bodies!\n\nMercury is known to have an adverse effect on animal wildlife, and mercury contamination has increased through anthropogenic inputs. A new study examines the mercury exposure and the potential health risks for 36 Arctic seabirds and shorebirds.\n\nA new EU project launched last week will evaluate changes in bird abundance and distributions in Europe and develop new tools to meet global biodiversity targets for 2030.\n\nNINA's expertise in biodiversity and environmental solutions is in high demand in Europe. Five research projects have been funded in the latest call from The European Biodiversity Partnership, BIODIVERSA+.\n\nIt is with huge sadness and shock that we have been informed that our colleague Ketil Skogen passed away suddenly on Saturday the 22nd of April 2023.\n\nSuccessful breeding is crucial, but climate change can make timing of breeding more demanding. A new study including data from several colonies monitored throughout the SEAPOP programme has now examined how seabirds adjust their breeding phenology.\n\nAmerican children have been inspired by NINA’s research on painting wind turbine rotor blades black to reduce bird collisions. This has taken them to the top of the First Lego League.\n\nResearchers have taken over 400 DNA samples from Norwegian rivers. The aim is to analyze as many as 800 samples nationally to investigate how various forms of hydropower affect species living in the river. Ultimately, the goal is to help the hydropower industry produce more sustainable renewable energy.\n\nInterest in the economic potential of the oceans is increasing. In Norwegian waters, marine activities present many potential stressors to seabirds and migratory birds when crossing the ocean​​."
