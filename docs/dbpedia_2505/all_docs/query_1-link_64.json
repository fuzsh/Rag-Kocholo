Nina Yasmineh was first praised by Pancakes and Whiskey two years ago with the debut of her first EP, Seven Years.\n\nIn those two years, Yasmineh has been thriving full force, with an EP every year along with remixes, covers, and collaborations.\n\n“I’ve been used up/drained to the bottom of the well/it’s a funny place to be/when all you do is keep asking to be filled.” Nina’s delivery on her new track, “Pirates,” is honest, true, and a true sliver of insight into the girl’s vulnerable heart, as she sings, “baby I’m all done/maybe I’m the quiet, fortunate one.”\n\nHer lyrics speak a vulnerable dynamic that allows the listener to relax and reflect. With the help of some bells and Rhodes, it’s that same vulnerable place that Yasmineh takes us to is a place where we give up on love, and submit to the cold truth of being alone.\n\nThere’s too many bands these days who worry about the delivery of the song and fail to get the message across. Yasmineh is a true artist; no need for ribbons and sparkles – the female artist with similar sounds to Delta Ray or Zella Day and Verité has a taste for authenticity in a sea of New York loud rock bands, Nina rings true.\n\nThere is nothing forceful about Yasmineh’s entire package. She intertwines a folk style with her own individual sound, breeding a sensual, introspective light of the dark depths of love that only the true battle survivors of heartbreak can understand.\n\nBe sure to catch Nina this Saturday (7-11) at the Bowery Electric!"
