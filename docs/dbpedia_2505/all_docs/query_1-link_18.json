        "text": "Originally hailing from Warsaw, alternative pop singer-songwriter, pianist and producer Nina Anto has been crafting a truly unique musical output over the last few years. Each song she pens is a puzzle piece that forms a vivid sonic world where themes of fear, love, hate, compassion, tears, laughter, life, death, rebirths, heartbreaks, imperfections, mistakes, harmony and disharmony all collide in her meaningful writing.\n\nThrough her heartfelt writing, Nina Anto has explored the issues of our generation and aims to provide solace and advocate for human rights, as demonstrated by her contributions to an awareness campaign on pediatric organ transplants and her vocal support for safe music education and the mental health of young musicians.\n\nFirst sharing her sound with the world back in 2018 via her debut single “Her Silence,” the following two years saw her release a string of well-received singles while collaborating with the likes of The Sound Creatures and Lessless. After relocating from London to Los Angeles, she performed at the LA-based radio station dublab and secured support from KCRW and national media outlets in Poland for her song “Necrosis.” Now, after a brief hiatus, she returns with her new single “Show Me Your Scars,” featuring American rapper Danny Clvrk.\n\nDrawing inspiration from artists like Moses Sumney, Sampha and James Blake, “Show Me Your Scars” showcases Nina Anto’s ethereal vocals set against a gentle piano-based sound tinged with delicate strings. The song explores the complexity of relationships, focusing on the authenticity of individuals rather than their superficial appearances.\n\nInspired by her encounter with a neighbour who often only showed their positive and happy side, Nina Anto reassures listeners that it’s okay to be vulnerable in the presence of the right people. Expanding on this context, she offers, “I had a conversation with Danny about what the song meant to me, and he admitted it was hard for him to be vulnerable because of how society sees men. Wanting to break the pattern, I invited Danny to have a featured rap verse on the song, a way for him to express his thoughts and feelings, and hopefully, also a way to start the conversation.”\n\nOpened with the delicate tones of airy piano notes as Nina’s alluring voice floats above to spin elegant melodies, a hushed beat enters to add a gentle rhythmic sway. With graceful vocal layers casting an enchanting musical landscape, “Show Me Your Scars” offers a moving sound full of blissful melodies, poignant lyricism, intricate arrangement and beautiful vocals. With Danny Clvrk threading slick rapped flow via mellow delivery, he injects his own musical flair to the track, resulting in a stunning collaboration that draws on the talents of both artists to offer a mesmeric and truly original sound.\n\nListen to Show Me Your Scars below\n\nMore from Music\n\nEditor Picks"
