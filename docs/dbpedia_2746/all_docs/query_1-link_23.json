The opening section, Intro- ducing Boston, maps the city and sets it in its geographical, historical, and cultural context. Boston at a Glance is an overview of the city's main attractions. Section two, Boston Area by Area, starts on page 38 and describes all the important u i ii i 1^1 Window at First Baptist Church (see p92) sights plus three recommended walks, using maps, photographs, and detailed illustrations. The sights are arranged in two groups: those in Boston's central districts, and those a little farther afield. Tips for hotels, restaurants, shopping, entertainment, and sports can be found in Travelers' Needs, while the final section, Survival Guide, contains practical advice on everything from public transportation and telephones to personal safety. FINDING YOUR WAY AROUND THE SIGHTSEEING SECTION Each of the six sightseeing areas is color- coded for easy reference. Every chapter opens with an introduction to the area it covers, describing its history and character. For central districts, this is followed by a Street-by-Street map illustrating a particularly interesting part of the area; for sights farther away, by a regional map. A simple numbering system relates sights to the maps. Important sights are covered by several pages. The area shaded in pink is / shown in greater detail on the Street-by-Street map. 2 Street-by-Street Map This gives a bird's-eye view of interesting and important parts of each sightseeing area, with accurate drawings of all the buildings within them. The numbering of the sights ties in with the preceding area map and with the fuller descriptions on the pages that follow. 1 Introduction to the Area For easy reference, the sights are numbered and plotted on an area map, with \"T\" stations shown where helpful. The key sights (historic buildings, churches, museums, and open-air sights) are listed by category. A locator map shows where you are in relation to other areas of the city center. Color-coded thumb tabs mark each area. A list of star sights recommends the places that no visitor should miss. 1 Suggested walking route HOW TO USE THIS GUIDE BOSTON AREA MAP The colored areas shown on this map (see inside front cover) are the five main sightseeing areas of central Boston (exclud- ing the Farther Afield section.)

Founded in the early 17th century around a large natural harbor at the mouth of the Charles River, the modern city now covers an area of 49 sq miles (127 sq km) and has a population of 600,000. Boston is the capital of Massachu- setts and a major center of American history, culture, and learning. Ujf ^^= H^rjjfoRONTO Lester B.

By around A.D. 500 Algonquin Indians were widespread in the region. Hunter-gatherers, they fished, farmed beans and pumpkins, and hunted moose and deer. They were made up of seven tribes, the closest geographically to present- day Boston being the Massachusetts, Wampanoags, andNipmucks. Other tribes in the region included the Nausets around Cape Cod, the Pennacooks far- ther north, and Pocumtucs and Mohicans to the west. Their dialects came from the same language, and their physical features were similar. Each tribe lived in close-knit communities of approx imately 250 people. Artist's impression of the Viking Leif Erikson's ship THE FIRST EUROPEANS During the Age of the Vikings, Norsemen from Scandinavia adventured far from home, reaching North America. The coastal land of Vinland discovered by Leif Erikson in around A.D. 1000 may well have been on the Massachusetts coast. French and Spanish fishermen fished here in the mid- 15th century and the Italian-born explorer John Cabot led an English expedition to the New England coast once in 1497 and again in 1498. A few years later Miguel Cortereal sailed from Portugal to Massachusetts, where his ship was wrecked. His name was found carved on a granite rock with the year 1511. Throughout the 16th century, the English, French, Portuguese, Spanish, and Ital- ians explored the East Coast, whaling, fishing, and trading with the natives. In 1602 the English- man Bartholomew Gosnold sailed to Massachusetts, land- ing on the peninsula he called Cape Cod and traversing the island he would name Martha's Vineyard after his daughter. He returned to England with furs from the natives and sassafras to be used medicinally. In 1607 James I of England offered land in the New World to two companies. What is now Virginia he gave to the London company, led by Captain John Smith. To a group from Plymouth, England, he assigned New England and land as far south as what is now Delaware. The Plymouth Company set out in 1607 to found a colony along the Kennebec River in present-day Maine, but the harsh winter led the company to return to England. John Smith's Virginia expe- dition was more successful. In May 1607 he arrived in Jamestown, where he founded a permanent colony.

This land would become a haven for people who were victims of religious persecution, especially Puritans, who did not adhere to all the beliefs and rituals of the Church of England. One group of Puritan separatists had already left England to seek greater freedom in The Netherlands, but had faced economic hardship there. Lured by Captain Smith's reports, they returned to England to seek a grant for land in the New World. Joining other Puritans led by William Bradford, they set out from Plymouth in two ships, the Mayflower and the Speedwell. Quickly discovering that the Speedwell was leaking, they returned to Plymouth, crammed into the Mayflower, and set sail again on September 16, 1620. Meeting of John local native in Two months later the 102 Pilgrims arrived at Cape Cod. Before disembarking, they formulated the \"Mayflower Compact,\" agreeing to govern themselves democratically with \"just and equal laws... for the general good of the colony.\" The Pilgrims named their new home Plymouth and soon made friends with the natives. On April 1, 1621, Governor John Carver and Chief Massasoit signed a peace treaty. They celebrated the first Thanksgiving that year sharing provisions with their native hosts. FOUNDING OF BOSTON Charles I assigned land 40 miles (65 km) north of Plymouth colony, near the Charles River, to the Massachusetts Bay Company, a large group of Puritans. In the spring of 1630 over 1,000 Puritans departed in 11 ships bound for Massachusetts. Some settled in Salem and other communities along the Massachusetts Bay.

Across the river lived a recluse, an Anglican clergyman, William Blackstone. He learned that disease was rampant among the Puritans due to the scarcity of fresh drinking water, and invited them to move their settlement over the river. Winthrop and his followers were quick to accept. They first called this new land Trimountain, but soon renamed it Boston after the town in England they had left behind. In 1635 they established the Boston Latin School, the first public school in the British colonies. A year later the Puritans founded a university, named subsequently after John Harvard, who had bequeathed it his library. Although the Puritans had come to Massachusetts in pursuit of religious freedom, they often proved intolerant of others. Anne Hutchinson was driven out of Boston in 1638 for not conforming to the Puritan tradition. Many Quakers were also beaten, fined, or banished. The Quaker preacher Mary Dyer was hanged for religious unorthodoxy on June 1, 1660 on Boston Common. In 1692 after several girls in the town of Salem accused three women of witchcraft, mass hysteria broke out throughout Massachusetts, and many innocents were tried, and hanged. No one felt safe until Governor William Phips put an end to the trials in 1693. Mary Dyer with other condemned Quakers, before being hanged in 1660 SEEDS OF REBELLION The British had passed the Navigation Acts to encourage the colonists to trade only with them, but when the colonists refused to obey, Charles II withdrew the Massachusetts Bay Charter in 1684, putting the colony under the control of the king. His successor James II appointed Sir Edmund Andros as royal governor. After James II lost power, the colonists arrested their governor and in 1689 established their own government. But in 1691 William and Mary granted a new charter to the Massachusetts Colony, combining the Massachusetts Bay and Plymouth colonies and recognizing a bicameral legislature. Later, the British and French started a long series of battles over New World territory. France finally ceded control of Canada and the American West, but the cost of war had taken its toll on the British, and the colonists were asked to pay their share in taxes. The seeds of rebellion were sown.

The colonists' main quarrel with Britain lay in taxation. The Stamp Act of 1765, and the later Townshend Acts, which placed duties on imports, inflamed colonists because they had no vote. \"No taxation without rep- resentation\" became a common cry. The so-called \"Sons of Liberty,\" led by Samuel Adams, demanded and received the repeal of the Stamp Act. However, attempts to enforce the Townshend Acts led to the Boston Massacre, a tragedy which signaled increas- ingly poor relations between Britain and its colonies. THE BOSTON MASSACRE (1770) At the time of the Townshend Acts, British troops were sent to Boston to protect customs commissioners. Bostonians often scoffed at the soldiers and threw stones. On March 5, 1770 the jeering got out of hand. Shots were fired and five Americans fell. Five Americans were killed when British troops shot into the crowd. The Boston Tea Party (1773) In protest at taxation, Boston patriots boarded three British East India Company ships and threw their cargoes of tea into Boston Harbor (see p75). The Battle of Bunker Hill (1775) In June 1 775, militiamen from all over New England had traveled to Boston to wrest control of the city from the British The Americans lost the ensuing battle, the bloodiest of the Revolution. TIMELINE 1765 British Parliament passes the Stamp Act 1765 1 773 Tea Act gives British East India Company monopoly. Boston Tea Party 1770 1767 Townshend Acts place duties on imports 1 766 Repeal of the Stamp Act 1 770 Five Americans killed in Boston Massacre THE HISTORY OF BOSTON Evacuation of Boston 1776 Following the Battle of Bunker Hill, Boston remained under British control. For almost a year American troops lay siege to the city, until in March 1 776 George Washington master- minded a strategy that led the British finally to evacuate. John Hancock A key participant in the Revolution, Hancock was chosen as a delegate of Massachusetts to attend the first ever Continental Con- gress, held in 1 774. British soldiers were sent to protect customs commissioners. Declaration of Independence (1776) Events surrounding the Battle of Bunker Hill and the evacuation of Boston inspired insurrection throughout the 13 colonies. This led, in July 1 776, to the signing of the Declaration of Independence . Freedom from Britain finally came in 1 781. PAUL REVERE'S RIDE On April 18, 1775 the British planned to march to Lexington to capture Samuel Adams and John Hancock, and then on to Concord to seize arms. To warn of the arrival of British troops, sexton Robert Newman hung lanterns in the tower of the Old North Church (see p71) and, so legend has it, Paul Revere undertook his \"midnight ride.\" Revere 's ride is immortalized in Longfellow's epic 1863 poem Tales of a Wayside Inn. During the ensuing skirmish at Lex- ington Green, eight American militiamen were killed - the first battle of the American Revolution had been fought.

Its port boomed, and trade, with China in particular, flourished. Some Bostonians made their fortunes at sea; others started profitable textile mills. A number of old Boston families - the Cabots, the Lowells, the Lodges - rose to great prominence boast- ing of their lineage, their wealth, and their Yankee independence. The United States elected not one but two members of the Adams family (both Boston residents) to the presidency: John Adams (1797-1801) and his son John Quincy Adams (1825-1829). John Adams' wife Abigail, one of the nation's most revered first ladies, made an early call for women's rights when she admonished her husband to \"remember the Ladies,\" for \"we ...will not hold ourselves bound by any law in which we have no voice, or representation.\" Boston soon earned a reputation as the intellectual capital of the new United States. The Boston Athenaeum (see p49), both a museum and Abigail Smith Adams (1744-1818) library, was first organized in 1807 \"for the promotion of literary and scientific learning.\" Eminent Bostonians (see pp30-3V at this time included the essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson, who formed the Trans- cendental Club, naturalist Henry David Thoreau, novelist Nathaniel Hawthorne, poet Henry Wads- worth Longfellow, whose epic poem made famous the midnight ride of Paul Revere (see p21), James Russell Lowell, the first editor of the Atlantic Monthly, and poet, diarist and edu- cational reformer Oliver Wendell Holmes (see p45) . The Boston Public Library, the oldest free library in the U.S., was founded in 1852. Initially most of Boston's European settlers came from England, but from 1846 Boston attracted thousands of immigrants driven out of Ireland by the potato famine. When the Irish first arrived they settled in overcrowded tenements along the city's waterfront and faced discrim- ination from the city's residents, especially its social elite, the Boston Brahmins (see p45). Signs went up The Boston Athenaeum, first organized in 1807 but later housed in this building, which was designed in 1846 TIMELINE 1 787 Constitutional Convention held in Philadelphia I 1 789 Inauguration of George Washington as president 1812 War with England 1786 Daniel Shay's rebellion t J 1800 1 796 John Adams elected as second president George Washington (1 732-99) 1825 William Ellery Channing founds American Unitarian Association 1820 1 807 Boston Athenaeum is founded THE HISTORY OF O S T O N 23 Irish immigrants, who poured into mid 19th-century Boston around the city with the words \"No Irish Need Apply.\" But despite these obstacles, the Irish rose in stature and by the end of the 19th century would dominate Boston politics and other areas of the city's life. THE ABOLITION MOVEMENT Some of America's most vehement anti-slavery sentiment originated in Boston. William Lloyd Garrison (see p30) published the first issue of The Liberator on January 1, 1831 calling for the unconditional abolition of slavery: \"I will not equivocate ... I will not excuse ... I will not retreat a single inch ... and I will be heard.\" Not all Bostonians sym- pathized with his cause. To escape from angry mobs he once had to seek safety for the night in a Boston jail. Garrison and other aboli- tionists (Charles Sumner, Wendell Phillips, Frederick Douglass) gave rousing anti- slavery speeches in Faneuil Hall (see p63), and accounts of their fiery oratory spread across the United States. The city also played an ac- tive role in the underground railroad. Fugitive slaves were assured a safe haven, and popular stopping-off points were the Second African Meeting House, the home of Lewis Hay den (a former slave), and John J. Smith's barbershop on the corner of Howard and Bulfinch Streets. When the first shots of the Civil War were fired on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, President Abraham Lincoln immediately asked volunteers to enlist. The state of Massachusetts answered the call first, sending 1,500 men within four days. As soon as African Americans were admitted to the Union forces, black soldiers started training in Boston. The Boston Brahmin, Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (see p30) led these men (the 54th Regiment of the Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry) in an assault on Fort Wagner, South Carolina - Shaw and 62 members of the regiment lost their lives. The battle is still re- membered for the role played by African Americans, and a monument (see p47) to it on Boston Common was dedicated on May 31, 1897.

The Back Bay had been filled and some of the neigh- boring towns already annexed. However, on November 9, 1872, Boston suffered a ter- rible setback as flames from a fire that started in a dry goods store spread to warehouses downtown, destroying 765 buildings. Newspaper headlines declared a loss of $250 million with \"rich men beggared in a day.\" The city recovered quickly, though, rebuilding and revitalizing textile and shoe manufacturing. Public institutions also continued to flourish. The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (see pp 104- 7) was opened in 1876, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra (see pi 60) founded in 1881. The first subway in the United States, the \"T,\" opened in 1897. In The Great Fire of Boston, November 9, 1872 Boston and the surrounding areas educational establishments such as Harvard, Radcliffe, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.), the New England Conservatory of Music, and Boston University all played their part in making the city a mecca for young students. The re- nowned collector of art Isabella Stewart Gardner (see pi 03), a rich, famously out- spoken, and well-con- nected woman, opened her house to the public on New Year's Day, 1903. Harvard University students rowing on the Charles River, 1896 THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY Following World War I, changing political and cultural attitudes across the U.S. increasingly left government clashing violently with the wishes of the people. Life in Boston was no exception. The Boston Police Strike of 1919 marks one of the most dramatic chapters in the U.S. Labor movement. As many as 1,290 policemen filed complaints over low wages, unsanitary stations, and lack of overtime com- pensation and sought affili- ation with the American Federation of Labor (A.F.L.). When the strike started, mobs smashed windows and looted stores. After a skirmish with state militia, in which two were wounded and nine killed, A.F.L. president Samuel Gompers persuaded the police to return to work. However, this was not just a time of conflict, but also TIMELINE 1872 The Great Fire of Boston 1884 First Irish mayor, Hugh O'Brien, elected 1897 The \"T,\" the U.S.'s first subway, opens. 1905 \"Honey Fitz\" elected mayor 1919 Boston Police Strike results in riots 1876 Museum of Fine Arts, Boston opened 1881 Boston Symphony Orchestra formed 1914 James Michael Curley elected mayor for the first time 1912 Fenway Park opens 1 903 Isabella Stewart Gardner opens her house to the public THE HISTORY OF O S T O N 25 one when popular culture came to the fore. One way this manifested itself was in spectator sports, which began to enjoy unparalleled pop- ularity. Fenway Park in Boston, home to the Boston Red Sox, had opened on April 20, 1912. The Boston Red Sox won the World Series four times before 1918. Supposedly cursed by the sale of slugger Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees, they did not win the World Series again until 2004. Prominent politicians from this time included John F. Kennedy's grand- father, John F. Fitzgerald, or \"Honey Fitz,\" as he was known, who was elected mayor in 1905. The flam- boyant James Curley, son of Irish immigrants, who became mayor, congressman, and gov- ernor, and spent time in jail for fraud, be- came a legend in his own lifetime. Babe Ruth (1895- 1948) in an ad for chewing gum POST-WAR POLITICS The most famous Boston-born politician was John F. Kennedy, the great-grandson of an Irish potato famine immigrant. In I960 he became the U.S.'s first Catholic, and youngest elected, president. His brother, Robert, served as attorney general and U.S. senator for New York. The Irish, how- ever, were not the only immigrants to enter politics. Michael Dukakis, the son of Greek immigrants, was elected governor in 1974, becoming Demo- cratic presidential candidate in 1988. The late 20th century saw extensive immigration from the Caribbean, Southeast Asia, Pakistan, and India, adding new talents and cultural traditions to city life. John F. Kennedy, perhaps the most famous of all American politicians, born of Boston Irish stock CITY RENAISSANCE In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, Boston built a prosperous economy based on finance, medicine, and higher education, revitalizing the city's cultural life and gentrifying historic neighborhoods. In 2004 the Boston Red Sox broke their curse and won baseball's World Series, transforming Boston's ethos from resignation to aspiration.

Wealthy 19th-century patrons stocked art museums that have now become world-class collections, the best example being the Museum of Fine Arts. Likewise, Boston's leadership in scientific inquiry has created first-rate natural history and science collections. Museums such as the John F. Kennedy Library and Museum provide insight into some of the city's most compelling and influential historical figures, while a strong architectural heritage means that some of the museum buildings are also very beautiful. Harvard University Museums These museums house a diverse range of collections: European Art, archaeology, natural history, and Asian and Near Eastern Art. The Sackler Museum (right) displays highlights of the art collection. Museum of Science A favorite family destin- ation, this museum has more than 550 interactive exhibits, that explain the laws of nature and the science of computers. Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum This Venetian-style palazzo stands as Isabella Gardner left it- filled to the brim with fine old masters and modern paintings. Her taste in art was considered by many to be impeccable. Museum of Fine Arts One of the largest museums in North America, the MFA is famous for its Greek, Roman, and Egyptian art, and French Impressionist paintings.

Mark Twain once I observed that \"In New York they ask what a man is worth. In Boston they J ask, 'What does he know?'\" This insistence on the power of ideas has made Boston a magnet for thinkers and doers, and a hotbed of reform movements and social revolution. Education has always been one of the city's leading industries. Consequently, Boston is disproportionately represented in the honor roll of American intellectual life. Bostonians are generally considered to be liberal minded, and tend to occupy the left flank of American political thought. Malcolm X (1925-65), one of Boston's many famous residents REFORMERS, RABBLE ROUSERS, AND REVOLUTIONARIES Even while Boston was still in its infancy, Bostonians began to agitate to do things differently. Anne Hutchinson (1591-1643) was exiled for heresy in 1638 (she moved south to found Portsmouth, Rhode Island), while friend and fellow religious radical Mary Dyer died on the Boston Common gallows for Quak- erism in 1660 (see pl9) . Spokesman for the Sons of Liberty and part-time brewer Samuel Adams (1722-1803) incited Boston to revolution in the \"Boston Tea Party\" (seep75). The city bubbled Abolitionist Garrison over with 19th-century reform- ers, including Dorothea Dix (1802-87), who championed the welfare of the mentally ill, and William Lloyd Garrison (1805-79), publisher of The Liberator, who was one of America's most strident voices calling for the abolition of slavery. Malcolm Little (1925- 65) spent his adolescence in Boston before converting to Islam in prison and emerging as the charismatic Black Muslim leader Malcolm X. Like Malcolm X, Nguyen Tat Thanh | (1890-1969) spent part of his youth in Boston, working for a time in the restaurant of the Omni Parker House Hotel (seep58). Traveling much of the world in his 20s, he was later to assume the name Ho Chi Minh. BOSTON BRAHMINS In I860 Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809-94) dubbed Boston's prosperous merchant class the \"Boston Brahmins ... a harmless, inoffensive, untitled aristocracy\" (seep45). Any suggestion that the Brahmins were unaccom- plished, however, could not be farther from the truth. Julia Ward Howe (1819-1910) was a prominent abolitionist and later a crusader for women's rights. She also penned the Unionists' Civil War marching song, \"The Battle Hymn of the Republic.\" Brahmin Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (1837-63) led the all-Black 54th Massachusetts Regiment in the Civil War, and Major Henry Lee Higginson (1834- 1919) survived the war to found the Boston Symphony Orchestra in 1881. Many famous authors were also Brahmins, notably the Lowell clan: James Russell Lowell (1819-9D was the leading literary critic of his day, Amy Lowell (1874-1925) championed \"free verse\" and founded Poetry magazine, and Robert Lowell (1917-77) broke the barriers between formal and informal verse in American poetry. The Brah- mins' greatest chronicler was the noted historian Samuel Eliot Morison (1887-1976). The Brahmins persist through business partnerships, family trusts, and intermar- riage, as highlighted in their ditty: \"And this is good old Boston, The home of the bean and the cod, Where the Low- ells talk to the Cabots, And the Cabots talk only to God.\" INVENTORS AND ENTREPRENEURS Innovation has always been a way of life in Boston. Donald McKay's (1810-80) East Boston clipper ships revolutionized international sea trade in the 1850s. Working in his Cambridge OSTON AT A GLANCE 31 Edwin Land (1909-91), inventor of Polaroid instant photography workshop, Elias Howe (1819-67) created the modern sewing machine, radically altering both the clothing trade and the shoe industry. Alexander Graham Bell (1847-1922) had offices in Cambridge and Boston, and later joined the faculty of Boston University. This was part of a trend of academic affiliation that became almost the rule for Boston's inventors. Edwin H. Land (1 909-91) experimented with polarized light in his Harvard lab before inventing Polaroid instant photography. The innovators Bolt, John F. Kennedy Beranek, and campaign button Newman also made academic affiliations with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and they also sent the world's first electronic mail message in the 1970s. psychology and physiology, but also promulgated philo- sophical pragmatism, the concept that the worth of an idea is based on its usefulness. His student, George Santayana (1863-1952) blossomed as the 20th-century's chief phi- losopher of aesthetics. More pragmatically, the Harvard economist John Kenneth Galbraith (1908- 2006) investigated the sources of societal affluence and advocated social policies to put that affluence to work for the common good. THINKERS In addition to showing the world how to do things, Bostonians have always been adept at explaining why. In his many essays and poems, Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803- 82) first laid the philosophical groundwork for an American school of transcendental religious thought. Meanwhile, his friend and fellow Harvard graduate Henry David Thoreau (1817-62) wrote many seminal works of nat- ural philosophy. A professor at Harvard, William James (1842-1910) not only taught POLITICAL LEADERS Boston's most infamous politician was the \"rascal king\" James Michael Curley (1874-1958), who served many terms as mayor and U.S. Congressman, winning his last election from a jail cell. His life was to serve as the model for the novel The Last Hurrah. Boston also gave the country four presidents: John Adams (1735-1826) and his son John Quincy Adams (1767-1848); the tight-lipped ex-governor Calvin Coolidge (1872-1933), who rose to prominence by crushing the Boston police strike in 1919; and John F. Kennedy, infamously assassinated in Dallas in 1963. Kennedy's brothers were also prominent on the national stage: Robert F. Kennedy (1925-1968) served as attorney general and then as senator, when he, too, was assassinated. Edward M. Kennedy (1932-2010) served for 46 years in the U.S. Senate as a leading advocate for social justice. His good friend, Thomas P. \"Tip\" O'Neill (1912- 94), served as U.S. Speaker of the House. AUTHORS America's first published author was Boston's Anne Bradstreet (1612-72). The first published African American author was Phillis Wheatley (1753-84), born in Africa, enslaved, then freed in Boston. Her 1778 volume, Poems on Various Subjects, Religious and Moral, echoed Boston authors' moral concerns. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-82) made his fortune from best-selling verse epics such as Evange- line and Hiawatha, but made his mark translating Dante. Although associated with nearby Concord, popular novelist Louisa May Alcott (1832-88) also lived on Beacon Hill and was active in Boston reform movements. New York-born Henry James (1843-1916) was educated at Harvard and often returned to Boston from his London home, spending a lifetime contrasting American and European culture. Former U.S. poet laureate Robert Pinsky (born 1940) teaches at Boston University, as does novelist Leslie Epstein (born 1938). The popular Boston-based fictional detective Spenser is the creation of Robert Parker (1932-2010), and when not hanging out with Clint Eastwood, suspense novelist and screenwriter Dennis Lehane (born 1966) broods at Fort Point Channel. Louisa May Alcott (1832-88), : Boston's reform movement 32 INTRODUCING BOSTON Boston's Architecture Buildings followed British styles through the 1790s, when the first American architect of note, Charles Bulfinch, defined the Federal style. In the 19th century, Bostonians evolved a local Victorian style, which first embraced Greek Classicism, then French and Italian styles. Two styles of the late 19th century, Renaissance Revival and Richardsonian Romanesque, remained influential through World War I. In the 20th century, Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.) attracted many leading modern and post-modern architects, all of whom left their mark. BOSTON GRANITE Freestanding Federal-style Harrison Gray Otis House FEDERAL Charles Bulfinch and his protege Asher Benjamin adapted British Georgian styles to create Boston's first signature architectural style. Typical of this style are freestanding mansions and town houses, with symmet- rical brick facades adorned by shuttered windows, and ground-floor windows set in recessed arches. Entrances are often cut from granite slabs, featuring gently fluted columns. The largest and most elegant rooms of Federal homes are usually found on the second floor. Some of the grander exam- ples of Federal domestic architecture, found mainly on Beacon Hill, feature ornamental ironwork and are often crowned with octag- onal cupolas. Chestnut Street on Beacon Hill (see pp42-3) represents the greatest con- centration of Federal-style row houses in Boston. Individual examples of the style include the Harrison Gray Otis House (seep52) and the Hepzibah Swan Houses (seep45). The granite outcrops found around Boston Harbor provided stone for the city's waterfront development in the early 19th century. Techno- logical advances had made it possible to cut entire columns from single blocks of granite. Freed from the constraints of soft limestone or sandstone, Alexander Parris and other architects adopted granite as a principal material for markets and ware- houses, as can be seen for exam- ple at Charles- town Navy Yard (see pi 15) and Quincy Market (seep64). Al Renaissance Revival interior of the Boston Public Library IK though the basic Granite style is an adap- facade of tation of Greek Revival, it also includes modern innovations such as iron tension rods and laminated wooden ribs to support copper domes. Distinctive, multicolored, square tower of Trinity Church RENAISSANCE REVIVAL Charles McKim's 1887 design for the Boston Public Library (seep96), conceived as a \"palace of the people,\" established Renaissance Revival architecture as a favorite American style for monumental public structures. Evenly spaced windows and arches, adorned by inscriptions and sculptural details, define the style. Soaring, barrel vaulted interiors are also featured. Bos- Greek Revival ton's Renaissance Quincy Market Revival struc- tures make ex- tensive use of New England and Italian marbles, carved stucco ceilings, and carved wood in staircases and walls. Many of the Italian artisans who were brought over to execute this work stayed in Boston, forming an elite group within the Italian immigrant community by around 1900. RICHARDSONIAN ROMANESQUE America is far too young to boast a true Romanesque style, but Henry Hobson Richardson effectively created one from European inspira- tions and American stone. By the 1870s, the wealthy city of Boston demanded BOSTON AT A GLANCE 33 more elaborate churches than the existing sparsely designed \"boxes with a spire.\" Gothic styles, however, were associ- ated with medieval Catholicism and were unacceptable to the Protestant heirs of the Puritans. Richardson's churches provided a pleasing alternative. Often, the build- ing's main components were massed around a central tower, as can be seen in Boston's most important example of the style, Trinity Church (seepp94-5), as well as in the First Baptist Church (seep92). In sharp contrast to the Boston Granite style, which used many similar materials and sharp angles, Richardson used stones of contrasting colors and rounded off virtually every square edge. Romanesque-style front portico of the First Baptist Church VICTORIAN Boston's Victorian style largely eschews the pointed Gothic lines of English Victorian in favor of French Academic, French Empire, and various Italianate influences. The variations are displayed in an almost chronological march of styles in the Back Bay and South End (seepp88-9), paralleling the decade-by-decade creation of filled land in those neighborhoods in the second half of the 19th century. Earlier buildings tend to reflect their stylistic influences more accurately; for example, the Italianate Gibson House Museum (see p92) on Beacon Street, which would have been among the first wave of Back Bay development. The later town houses of Italianate interior detail of the Victorian Gibson House Museum upper Newbury Street and Massachusetts Avenue reflect a more mature synthesis: raised granite entrances, slate- shingled mansard roofs, and dormer and bay windows. Nowhere is the transition from early to late Victorian styles so evident than on the walk westward, from the center of Boston, along Commonwealth Avenue (seep93)- ART DECO Most of Boston's Art Deco buildings are clustered around Post Office Square in the Financial District, with the former Post Office (see p65) and the New England Telephone Building (see p65) being the finest examples. Essentially tall buildings of light gray granite, they are constructed with vertical strips and slit windows that elongate their forms. Elaborate geometric steps and surface ornament on the ■JlH I mm r ■ ii i upper stories help relieve their mass. Boston Art Deco tends also to make great use of Greco-Roman geometric friezes and stylized, vegetable-inspired ornament. Some Financial District Art Deco buildings also feature bas-relief murals of historic and heroic themes. Back Bay was once the site of many Art Deco storefronts with stylized Parisian pilasters and grillwork, but only the former quarters of Shreve, Crump & Low Inc. on Boylston Street (seep96) remain intact. . ii ii ii •■ ii ■■ ei •• The Art Deco New England Telephone Building, overlooking Post Office Square Modernist interior of the Kresge Chapel, built in the 1950s MODERNISM The willing embrace of Modernism at Boston and Cambridge colleges has graced the Boston area with a wide range of outstanding 20th-century buildings where simplicity of form is favored over ornament, and expressive lines grow out of function. When Bauhaus director Walter Gropius fled the Nazis for the safety of Harvard University, he served as a magnet for some of the mid-century's great designers and architects. The range of styles in Boston's Modernist buildings is diverse: the poetic sculptural grace of Eero Saarinen's Kresge Auditorium and Chapel at M.I.T. (see pi 09); Le Corbusier's Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts (see pill); and Josep Lluis Sert's International- style Holyoke Center, both near Harvard Yard (seeppllO-11). 34 INTRODUCING BOSTON BOSTON THROUGH THE YEAR P A li erhaps more than in any other city i in the U.S., Boston's cultural life tends to follow the academic calendar, with the \"year\" beginning when classes commence at its many colleges and universities in September, and winding down a little with the start of the summer recess in May and June. In between is so-called \"ice cream\" season, when the warm weather causes most activities to shift out of doors, and reading lists favor Model of a saint. North End Italian Feast Days fiction over more scholarly texts. Though the cultural life of the city tends to flourish from fall to spring, the summer months do feature many of Boston's major carnivals, festivals, parades, and free outdoor concerts at the Hatch Shell (see p92).

The south slope, facing Boston Common, became the main seat of Boston wealth and power, while the north slope and the land rolling down to the mouth of the Charles River, known as the West End, became pop- ulated by tradesmen, servants, free blacks. South-slope Beacon SIGHTS AT A GLANCE retained its cachet into the late 19th century, while the north slope and West End degen- erated. Urban renewal in the 1950s and 1960s cleared away the slums and coherent neigh- borhood of the West End, while gentrification of the north slope made even the most modest homes on Beacon Hill highly and desirable, and this neighborhood Hill one of Boston's most picturesque.

Many of the district's houses were designed by Charles Bulfinch (see p53) and his disciples, and the south slope evolved as a textbook example of Federal architecture. Elevation and view were all, and the finest homes are either on Boston Common or perched near the top of the hill. Early developers abided by a gentleman's agree- ment to set nouses back from the street, but the economic depression of 1807-12 resulted in row houses being built right out to the street.

The main shop- ping and dining area of the Beacon Hill neighborhood, the curving line of Charles Street hugs the base of Beacon Hill, giving it a quaint, village- like air. Many of the houses remain residential on the upper stories, while street level and cellar levels were converted to commercial uses long ago. Though most of Charles Street dates from the 19th century, widening in the 1920s meant that some of the houses on the west side acquired new facades. The Charles Street Meeting House, designed by Asher Benjamin (see p32) in 1807, was built for a Baptist congregation that practiced im- mersion in the then adjacent river. It is now a commercial building. Two groups of strik- ing Greek Revival row hous- es are situated at the top of Charles Street, between Revere and Cambridge Streets. Charles Street was one of the birth- places of the antique trade in the U.S. and now has more than a dozen antique dealers. Louisburg Square O Map 1 B4. © Charles/MGH, Park Street. Home to millionaire politicians, best-selling authors, and corporate moguls, Louisburg Square is arguably Boston's most prestigious address. Developed in the 1830s as a shared private preserve on Beacon Hill, the square's tiny patch of greenery sur- rounded by a high iron fence sends a clear signal of the square's continued exclusivity. On the last private square in the city, the Columbus narrow Greek Louisburg Revival bow-fronted town houses sell for a premium over comparable homes else- where on Beacon Hill. Even the on-street parking spaces are deeded. The traditions of Christmas Eve carol singing and candlelit windows are said to have begun on Louisburg Square. A statue of Christopher Columbus, presented by a wealthy Greek merchant in 1850, stands at its center. Mount Vernon Street O Map 1 B4. (J) Charles/MGH, Park Street. In the 1890s the novelist Henry James (seep3V called Mount Vernon Street \"the most civilized street in America,\" and it still retains that air of urbane culture. Most of the developers of Beacon Hill, who called themselves the Mount Vernon Proprietors, chose to build their private homes along this street. Architect Charles Bulfinch (seep53) envisioned Beacon Hill as a district of large freestanding mansions on spacious land- scaped grounds, but building costs ultimately dictated much denser development. The sole remaining example of Bulfinch's vision is the second Harrison Gray Otis House, built in 1800 at No. 85. The Greek Revival row houses next door (Nos. 59- 83), graciously set back from the street by 30 ft (9 m), were built to replace the single mansion belonging to Otis's chief devel- opment partner, Jonathan Mason. The original mansion was torn down after Mason's death in 1836. The three Bulfinch- designed houses at Nos. 55, 57, and 59 Mount Vernon Street were built by Mason for his daughters. No. 55 was ultimately passed on to the Statue, Nichols family Square (see p45) in 1885. BEACON HILL AND WEST END OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES AND THE BOSTON BRAHMINS In I860, Oliver Wendell Holmes (see p30) wrote that Boston's wealthy merchant class of the time constituted a Brahmin caste, a \"harmless, inoffensive, untitled aristo- cracy\" with \"their houses by Bulfinch, their monopoly on Beacon Street, their ancestral portraits and Chinese porcelains, humanitarianism, Unitarian faith in the march of the mind, Yankee shrewdness, and New England exclusiveness.\" So keenly did he skewer the social class that the term has persisted. In casual usage today, a Brahmin is someone with an old family name, whose finances derive largely from trust funds, and whose politics blend conservatism with noblesse oblige toward those less fortunate. Boston's Brahmins founded most of the hospitals performing arts bodies and museums Oliver Wendell of the greater metropolitan area.

Modernized in 1830 by the addition of a Greek Revival portico, the house is never- theless a superb example of Bulfinch's domestic architec- ture. It also offers an insight into the life of a true Beacon Hill character. Rose Standish Nichols moved into the house aged 13 when her father pur- chased it in 1885. She left it as a museum in her will in I960. A woman ahead of her time, strong-willed and famously hospitable, Nichols was, among other things, a self- styled landscape designer who traveled extensively around the world to write about gardens.

The only woman who was ever a member of the Mount Vernon Proprietors (seep44), Mrs. Swan had these houses built by Bulfinch as wedding presents for her daughters in 1806, 1807 and 1814. Some of the most elegant and distinguished houses on Chestnut Street, they are backed by Bulfinch-designed stables that face onto Mount Vernon Street. The deeds restrict the height of the stables to 13 ft (4 m) so that her daughters would still have a view over Mount Vernon Street.

The elite Somerset Club stands at Nos. 42-43 Beacon Street. In the 1920s to 1940s, Irish Catholic mayor James Michael Curley would lead election night victory marches to the State House, pausing at the Somerset to taunt the Boston Brahmins within. The Parkman House at No. 33 is now a city-owned meeting center. It was the home of Dr. George Parkman, who was murdered by Harvard professor and fellow socialite Dr. John Webster in 1849.

British troops camped here during the 1775-76 military occupation. As Boston grew in the 19th century, the Boston Common became a center for open-air civic activity and remains so to this day. By contrast, the 24-acre (10-ha) Public Garden is more formal. When the Charles River mudflats were first filled in the 1830s, a succession of landscape plans were plotted for the Public Garden before the city chose the English-style garden scheme of George F. Meacham in 1869. The lagoon was added to the garden two years later.

Designed by English architect Peter Banner, who adapted a design by the earlier English architect Christopher Wren, the church was commissioned by parishioners wanting to establish a Congregational church in the heart of Boston. The church was, and still remains, one of the city's most influential pulpits. Contrary to popular belief, the sermons of Park Street ministers did not earn the intersection the nickname of \"Brimstone Corner.\" Rather, the name came about during the War of 1812 when the U.S. and Britain were in conflict over British restric- tions on trade and freedom of the seas, as well as the U.S.'s ties with Napoleonic France. The U.S. militia, based in Boston, stored its gunpowder in the church basement as safekeeping against bombardment from the British navy, hence the nickname. Park Street Church later became famous throughout the islands of the Pacific, when in 1819 the church sent a num- ber of Congrega- tional missionaries to carry the Gospel to Pacific islanders from a base in the Hawaiian Islands. In 1829, William Lloyd Garrison (1805-79), a firebrand of the movement to abolish slavery, gave his first abolition speech from the Park Street pulpit, while in 1849 a speech called The War System of Nations was addressed to the American Peace Society by Senator Charles Sumner. Much later, in 1893, the anthem America the Beautiful by Katharine Lee Bates debuted at a Sunday service. Today the church continues to be involved in religious, political, cultural, and humanitarian activities. Old Granary Burying Ground O Tremont Street. Map 1 C4. (X) Park Street. Q 9am-5pm daily. Named after the early colonial grain storage facility that once stood on the adjacent site of Park Street Church, the Granary Burying Ground dates from 1660. Buried here were three important signatories to the Declaration of Independence (seep21) - John Hancock, Samuel Adams, and Robert Treat Paine, along with Benjamin Franklin's parents, merchant-philanthropist Peter Faneuil, and some victims of the Boston Massacre. The orderly array of grave- stones, often featured in films and television shows set in Boston, is the result of mod- ern groundskeeping. Few stones, if any, mark the actual burial site of the person memorialized. In fact, John Hancock may not be here at all. On the night he was buried in 1793, grave robbers cut off the hand with which he had signed his name to the Declaration of Independ- ence, and some scholars believe that the rest of the body was later spirited away during 19th-century construct- ion work. Although many heroes of the Revolution are still known to be buried here, Paul Revere, one of Boston's most famous sons, was nearly denied the honor because the cemetery was technically full when he died in 1818. The city made an exception, and he was able to join his comrades in perpetuity.

Among the ^pi Athenaeum's major holdings are the 1 personal library that once belonged to George Washington and the theological library supplied by King William III of England to the King's Chapel (seep 58). In its early years the Athenaeum was Boston's chief art museum; when the Museum of Fine Arts was proposed, the Athenaeum graciously donated much of its art, including unfinished portraits of George and Martha Washington purchased in 1831 from the widow of the painter Gilbert Stuart. Non-members of the Athenaeum may visit only the first floor of the building, an area that includes the art gallery (with changing exhibitions) and several reading rooms.

Holmes Alley, once an escape route for slaves on the run BLACK HERITAGE TRAIL In the first U.S. census in 1790, Massachusetts was the only state to record no slaves. During the 19th century, Boston's substantial free African American commu- nity lived principally on the north slope of Beacon Hill and in the adjacent West End. The Black Heritage Trail links sev- eral key sites, ranging from the African Meeting House to private homes that are not open to visitors. Among them are the 1797 George Middleton House (Nos. 5-7 Pinckney Street), the oldest standing house built by African Americans on Beacon Hill, and the Lewis and Harriet Hayden House (No. 66 Phillips Street). Escaped slaves, the Haydens made their home a haven for runaways in the \"Underground Railroad\" of safe houses between the South and Canada. The walking tour also leads through mews and alleys, like Holmes Alley at the end of Smith Court, once used by fugitives to flee professional slave catchers. Free tours of the Black Heritage Trail are led by National Park Service rangers - (617) 742-5415 - from Memorial Day weekend to Labor Day, 10am, noon, and 2pm Monday to Saturday, leaving from the Shaw Memorial.

The U.S.'s oldest black church building, it was the political and religious center of Boston's African American society. Cato Gardner, a native African, raised $1,500 toward the eventual $7,700 to build the church and is honored with an inscription above the entrance. The interior is plain and simple but rang with the oratory of some of the 19th century's most fiery abolition- ists: from Sojourner Truth and Frederick Douglass to William Lloyd Garrison (see p30), who founded the New England Anti-Slavery Society in 1832. The meeting house basement was Boston's first school for African American children until the adjacent Abiel Smith School was built in 1831. When segregated education was barred in 1855, however, the Smith School closed. The meeting house became an Hasidic synagogue in the 1890s, as most of Boston's African American community moved to Roxbury and Dorchester. The synagogue closed in the 1960s, and in 1987 the building reopened as the linchpin site on the Black Heritage Trail. 49 Abiel Smith School, where Boston's free blacks received an education 50 P M; BOSTON AREA BY AREA Massachusetts State House ® The cornerstone of the Massachusetts State House was laid on July 4, 1795, by Samuel Adams and Paul Revere.

Descended from both British colonial administrators and Boston revolutionary patriots, Otis took a practical view of local government that paved the way for Boston's develop- ment as a powerhouse of international trade and finance. Having already made a fortune in the land development of Beacon Hill, Otis commissioned this home as a showpiece, where he could entertain. It was the first of three homes Bulfinch designed for him. After Otis moved out, the house fell on hard times as the West End neighborhood around it absorbed successive waves of immigration, and tenements replaced single family homes. By the 1830s the Otis house was serving as a ladies' Turkish bath and later became a patent medicine shop before ending up as a boarding house. Historic New England saved the building in 1916 and established its headquarters here. A gallery in the house depicts the time when the building was a boarding house in the 1950s.

The operating theater, with seating for observers, is set beneath a skylit dome. In 1846, the use of ether as a surgical general anesthetic was first demonstrated here. A free tour of the hospital is offered at 12:30pm on the third Friday of each month (Jan-Nov, reservations are required). CHARLES BULFINCH Born in 1763 in Boston, Charles Bulfinch (see p32) was among America's first professional architects and one of the most influential. He rose to prominence with his 1795 plan for the Massachusetts State House (seepp50-51), and went on to design many of the neighboring mansions on Beacon Hill. His own forays into real estate development cast him into bankruptcy, but he continued to enjoy the steady patronage of Boston's wealthiest citizens for his elegant yet boldly confident house designs. These patrons also helped him secure many public commissions, including the renovation of St. Stephen's Church in the North End (see p72) and the enlargement of Faneuil Hall (seep63). His application of local granite building stone to the Massachusetts General Hospital surgical pavilion laid out principles later followed by Alexander Parris and others as they forged the Boston Granite style of architecture, exemplified by Quincy Market (seep64) and Charlestown Navy Yard (see pi 15). Bulfinch left Boston in 1818 to assume direction of the construction of the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, DC. 19th-century view of Massachusetts State House from Boston Common Charles Bulfinch's Ether Dome, part of the Massachusetts General Hospital Museum of Science and Science Park © Science Park.

I^QQ www.mos.org The Museum of Science straddles the Charles River atop the inactive flood control dam that sits at the mouth of the Charles River. The museum itself was built in 1951, but Science Park has taken shape around it since, virtually obscuring the dam structure with theater and planetarium buildings and a massive parking garage. With more than 550 inter- active exhibits covering natural history, medicine, astronomy, and the wonders of the physical sciences, the Science Museum is oriented to families with children. In 1999 the museum absorbed the holdings of Boston's Computer Museum, one of the first of its kind in the world. The Mugar Omni Theater contains a five-story domed screen with multi-dimensional sound system with wrap- around sound, and shows mostly educational films, usually with a natural science theme. The Charles Hayden Planetarium offers daily shows about stars, planets, and other celestial phenomena. An extensive array of edu- cational toys can be bought from the museum's shop, while the food court has a number of concessions catering to children's tastes. OSTON AREA BY AREA 55 OLD BOSTON AND THE FINANCIAL DISTRICT This is an area of Boston where old and new sit one on top of the other. Some of its sights, situated in the older part of the district closest to Boston Common, predate the American Revolution (see pp20-21). Much of what can be seen today, though, was built more recently. The north of the district is home to Boston's late 20th- SIGHTS AT A GLANCE Historic Streets and Squares Blackstone Block © Post Office Square © Historic Buildings and Churches Boston City Hall O Center Plaza Q Custom House O Faneuil Hall Q Government Center King's Chapel and Burying Ground © New England Telephone Building © Old City Hall Old Corner Bookstore Q Old South Meeting House O Old State House pp60-6l Omni Parker House Q Quincy Market O yards British Lion, Old State House century, modernist-style City Hall and Government Center, while to the east is the city's bustling Financial District.

Bowdoin, Government Center, State, and Haymarket \"T stations are located at the heart of the district. The area is also served by buses 6, 7, 92, 93, 352, 353, 354, and 355. <| Custom House, Boston's original skyscraper and one of the most distinctive buildings on the city skyline Street-by-Street: Colonial Boston An important part of Boston's Freedom Trail (seeppl24-7) runs through this historic core of the city, the site of which predates American Independence. Naturally, the area is now dominated by 19th- and 20th-century development, but glimpses of a colonial past are prevalent here and there in the Old State House, King's Chapel and its adjacent burying ground, and the Old South Meeting House. Newer buildings of interest include the Omni Parker House, as well as the towering skyscrapers of Boston's financial district, located on the northwest edges of this area. * King's Chapel and Burying Ground A church has stood here since 1688, though the current building dates from 1749.
