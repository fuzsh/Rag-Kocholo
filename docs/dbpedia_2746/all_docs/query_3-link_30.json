        "meta_description": "Ghost Frequency II - Resonance by Cameron Undy, released 01 March 2024\n\n1. Resonance\n2. Running Stream\n3. The Heart\n4. Smoke\n5. Morning Tide\n6. Son of Euclid\n7. Embers\n8. Running Stream II\n9. Earth Moves\n\nSydney-based Cameron Undy presents the follow-up to his critically acclaimed Ghost Frequency solo guitar project, Ghost Frequency II - Resonance. Born from a fascination with rhythms of the African diaspora, the series elegantly captures the echoes of the ancestral dances, ceremonies, and rituals that have enriched the world of contemporary music. Like ghostly artefacts, these rhythms serve as both ancient relics and sources of inspiration, connecting the present to distant civilizations.\r\n\r\n“Few musicians would possess more depth of talent than Sydney’s Cameron Undy.. this thoroughly intriguing and unprecedented album is a major achievement.” ★★★★★ The Australian\r\n\r\n&quot;Much like the light from a star that burnt out millions of years ago, these rhythms are as real and present as a footprint in the sand,&quot; says Undy. \r\n\r\n&quot;My music doesn&#39;t replicate specific African rhythms; instead, they are reflections or shadows of these &#39;ghosts&#39;.&quot; The resulting sounds are geometric distortions of original archetypes, generated using principles of natural sequence and analog transformation opening pathways to new connections in the mind and body.\r\n\r\nThe new album features nine original pieces, each with its own unique resonance. Tracks like Running Stream and Running Stream II take listeners to a place of retreat and natural energy, while The Heart is a dedicated homage to the &#39;Uluru Statement of the Heart&#39; by Australia&#39;s First Nations People and embodies the spirit of &#39;makarrata&#39; - coming together after a struggle, acknowledging wrongs, and living in peace. Embers explores the rhythms of a crackling fire bed and Earth Moves expresses the wonder of how we dance even as our planet speeds across the universe.\r\n\r\n“subtly crafted…etched with exquisite restraint…clean lines and deep insistent grooves…a compelling and satisfying brew.” Rhythms Magazine \r\n\r\nCameron Undy&#39;s prolific career spans jazz, funk, avant-garde, and dance music. His previous release, &#39;Ghost Frequency&#39; (Earshift, 2022), garnered critical acclaim. He has been recognized as one of Sydney Morning Herald&#39;s 100 &#39;Most Influential and Inspiring People of 2011&#39;. Undy is also the Co-Founder of The Jazzgroove Association (1995-2014) and Venue 505 (2004-2022), listed among &#39;Downbeat&#39;s Top Jazz Clubs in the World&#39;.\r\n\r\nCritics have praised the first of his &#39;Ghost Frequency’ releases for its unique approach to rhythm and technique. The Weekend Australian hailed it as a &quot;major achievement&quot;, while Rhythms Magazine appreciated its &quot;subtly crafted&quot; nature, &quot;etched with exquisite restraint&quot; and &quot;deep insistent grooves.&quot;",
