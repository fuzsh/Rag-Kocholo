Members of Bitter Sweet Kicks, King Of The North, Smudge, Le Bastard, The Stevens, Nation Blue, Even, The UV Race, Cash Savage & The Last Drinks, Bowers, Saskwatch and The Pretty Littles as well as Fraser A. Gorman, Dan Sultan, Dave Larkin and Mark Evans from AC/DC round out the squad.\n\nThe Megahertz will feature a splendid selection of community broadcasters from both Triple R 102.7FM and PBS 106.7FM. They’ll be lead by Co-Captains, Emma Peel (Switched On – PBS) and Stew Farrell (Breakfasters - Triple R), plus Director of Coaching Neil Rogers (The Australian Mood – Triple R), Coach Vince Peach (Soul Time – PBS), Assistant Coaches DQ (PBS/Triple R Swami) and Tim Harrington (Triple R Breakfasters Sports Guy), Club Strapper Pauly P (Livewire - Triple R), Club Administrator Crispi Winsor (PBS) and Megahertz President Jon Von Goes (JVG Radio Method – Triple R).\n\nThe event is a celebration of Melbourne’s dynamic music and community broadcasting scene. The teams aim to reflect the diversity of the communities from which they’re drawn, with a focus on fun, safety and respect for other players and of course the umpires. Proceeds from the day are donated to Reclink Australia.\n\nReclink Community Cup is a fun family day out, with children’s activities, food and beverage stalls and an opportunity for a grass roots kick-to-kick for crowd members during match breaks. Performers on the day include Painters & Dockers, Saskwatch, The Smith Street Band, Fraser A. Gorman, David Bridie and Elmo & Friends\n\n2014 Reclink Community Cup\n\n12 noon, Sunday 22 June\n\nElsternwick Park\n\nPhoto: Jay Hynes"
