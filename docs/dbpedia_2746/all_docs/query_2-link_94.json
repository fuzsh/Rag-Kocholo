        "text": "THE annual rock'n'ruck fund-raising day of music and football, the Reclink Community Cup, is on this Sunday at Elsternwick Park. Established in 1993, the game between the Rockdogs - musicians and music-industry workers - and the Megahertz - community-radio broadcasters from Triple R, PBS FM and RMIT's SYN FM - raises money to help the Reclink charity use sport and the arts to enhance the lives of disadvantaged people.\n\nAccording to Triple R broadcaster and the head of football operations for the Megahertz, Jon Von Goes, the radio team, which was narrowly defeated last year, is in fine form. ''We're better this year,'' Von Goes says. ''We started training two months ago, every Sunday morning at a park in Brunswick.''\n\nThe Megahertz are coached by PBS presenter Vince Peach and co-captained by breakfast-show presenters Jess McGuire from Triple R's Breakfasters and Maddy Mac from PBS' The Breakfast Spread.\n\n''You can't take it too seriously; we all have a really good time,'' says Rockdogs captain Dan Sultan, who is playing his third consecutive community cup. ''I am a lot fitter than last year and I haven't had a drink for months.''\n\nPaul Kelly is again coaching the musicians' team, with former wrestlers the Ox and Mr Damage as assistant coaches. This year, players lining up for the Rockdogs include Tim Rogers, Dave Larkin, Mark Evans from AC/DC, Ross Knight from Cosmic Psychos, Rebecca Barnard, members of Bitter Sweet Kicks, the Bowers, the Vasco Era, the Gin Club, Money for Rope and all of the Spazzys (including newly qualified lawyer Kat Spazzy), who had pizza and beers delivered to them on the field last year. ''The Rockdogs' lifestyle kicks in during the last quarter,'' Von Goes says. ''It is not a pretty footy game to watch.''\n\nSultan agrees. ''If you are there to catch up with your mates, feed your dog half-eaten pies and kick a football with your kids, then that is all right,'' he says.\n\n''If you are there to watch footy, you will be sorely disappointed.''\n\nLegendary band Blue Ruin, with singer Quincy McLean and guitarist Mulaim Vela, has reformed for the event and will be joined on the bill by Boomgates, Bunny Monroe and Drunk Mums. All bands are playing a Cramps cover, in keeping with this year's theme: Can the Megas do the Dogs?\n\nDevo on the Green\n\nSIMPLE Minds and Devo will tour Australia together at the end of the year for A Day on the Green. They will be joined by the Church on all shows and the Models on December 1. They play the Palais Theatre on November 29 and Rochford Wines on December 1. Tickets on sale July 2\n\nParklife line-up\n\nAUSTRALIAN acts the Presets, Tame Impala and Hermitude will headline the national 2012 Parklife festival at Melbourne's Sidney Myer Music Bowl and Kings Domain on October 6. Passion Pit, Nero, Plan B, Justice DJs, Robyn, Chairlift, Chiddy Bang, Wiley, Labrinth, Jacques Lu Cont, DJ Fresh, Charli XCX, Rusko, Benga, St Lucia, Parachute Youth, Modestep, Alison Wonderland, Jack Beats, Citizens!, Lee Foss and more will be part of the line-up. General tickets go on sale July 3, with early-bird sales from June 26. parklife.com.au.\n\nFirst Harvest crop\n\nBECK, Sigur Ros, Mike Patton's Mondo Cane, Grizzly Bear, Ben Folds Five, Beirut, Santigold, Cake, the Dandy Warhols, the Black Angels, Ozomatli, Chromatics, Liars, F--- Buttons, the War on Drugs and Dark Dark Dark are the first batch of acts announced for the second annual Harvest festival. More acts will be added to the line-up, including some Australian acts.\n\nAfter last year's event was marred by long queues for toilets, food and drinks (beer, wine and cider were sold out by 4pm), promoter AJ Maddah told Sticky, ''As for amenities, I have taken control of these personally and will be micro-managing every aspect.''\n\nThe festival will take place at Werribee Park on November 11. Tickets go on sale on June 28.\n\nHave a heart\n\nLANIE Lane, Tim Rogers, Stonefield, Normie Rowe, Lawrence Mooney, Fiona O'Loughlin, Nick Barker and Cal Wilson will play the fifth annual Heart of St Kilda Concert at the Palais Theatre on July 18. The evening will be hosted by Brian Nankervis of RocKwiz, with more artists to be added to the line-up. The Sacred Heart Mission provides care for the homeless and people in poverty in St Kilda.\n\n100 Regal years\n\nTHE Northcote Theatre, also known as the Regal Ballroom, is celebrating its centenary with a month of shows, starting on Wednesday with two nights of Louisiana's Lil' Band o' Gold. Other acts playing over the next month include the Fauves, Even, Barry Morgan, Jim Keays, Dave Graney & the Lurid Yellow Mist and the League of Extraordinary Gentlewomen. It will return to being a picture theatre for a week during celebrations, screening classics such as Cinema Paradiso, Moulin Rouge, The Shining, The Artist and The Godfather.\n\nGigs\n\n■TONIGHT Diafrix and young artists from the Art Centre's hip-hop music mentoring program Dig Deep perform a free concert at the forecourt on St Kilda Road from 5.30pm as part of Refugee Week; Jamie Hutchings (ex-Bluebottle Kiss) plays his only Melbourne show at the Empress before touring France and China with his new group the Goldfish Memories; My Dynamite, Matt Sonic & the High Times and King of the North celebrate the 35th anniversary of AC/DC's Let There Be Rock at Cherry Bar; '80s hair-metal legends Heaven reform to play the Evelyn; Perth's one-man electro-punk explosion Tomas Ford plays late at Pony; acclaimed blues-folk artist Liz Stringer continues her tour behind the recent Warm in the Darkness, playing the Caravan Music Club tonight and Meeniyan Hall tomorrow with Van Walker.\n\n■SATURDAY Psych stalwarts the Lovetones celebrate their 10th anniversary and release of Collected Works at the Workers Club with Immigrant Union and Field Trip; party band El Moth & the Turbo Rads bring their funky reggae-rock to Bar Open; singer-songwriter Fred Smith plays Bella Union Hall with Liz Frencham; Gruntbucket are at Tago Mago in Thornbury; the New Centre of the Universe Vol. 1 tape, featuring garage bands from Melbourne and Geelong, put together by Billy Gardner from the Living Eyes, will be launched at Gasometer over two stages with 15 bands for $15, including the UV Race, Frowning Clouds, Chook Race, Bad Aches, Mesa Cosa, the Murlocs and Ross de Chene Hurricanes.\n\n■WEDNESDAY Lost Sunnies, the new musical project for former Drones guitarist Rui Pereira, with Link Meanie and Andrew McGee, play the Tote with the Steins and the Old Faithfuls; and Mikelangelo performs Leonard Cohen's Songs of Love and Hate at the Old Bar.\n\n■THURSDAY Blues-rock duo Jackson Firebird, from Mildura, play with noise-punk trio River of Snakes at the Retreat; Melbourne's Kingswood, Money for Rope and Damn Terran have teamed up for This Epic Tour and play two consecutive nights at the Workers Club."
