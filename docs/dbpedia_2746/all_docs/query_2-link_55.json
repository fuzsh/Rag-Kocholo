        "text": "As part of the NBA’s Future Starts Now initiative, the NBA App, NBA.com and NBA YouTube will stream select games from Nike’s EYBL Peach Jam tournament in Augusta, South Carolina from July 17-21.\n\nNike Peach Jam (formerly Peach Basket Classic) has been a part of the EYBL circuit since 2010, with notable alumni including 2023-24 All-Stars Jayson Tatum, Julius Randle and Trae Young.\n\nSince September 2023, the NBA has partnered with numerous grassroots organizations to create unique experiences for fans to follow the pathways of elite youth prospects from across the globe. This has included scholastic and summer circuit events, international leagues and camps, as well as All-Star games.\n\nBelow are a few high-impact prospects to keep an eye on during the week and onwards:\n\nCameron Boozer: Nightrydas Elite (FL)\n\nIncoming Duke freshman Cooper Flagg is currently at the helm of ushering in a new wave of elite prospects. The top player in the class of 2025 isn’t far behind. The son of former NBA All-Star Carlos Boozer, Cam has the size, skillset and savvy of a seasoned pro. The 6-foot-9, 235-pound (and still growing) forward scores in an array of ways from the paint and perimeter due to his shooting touch and finishing ability.\n\nBoozer’s strength and soft hands also enable him to rebound at a high rate — both major qualities that currently have him slated as a projected lottery pick in the 2026 NBA Draft.\n\nAJ Dybantsa: Oakland Soldiers (CA)\n\nElite athleticism, a high motor and the ability to get to the rim at will are the major strengths of the 6-foot-9 Brockton, Massachusetts native. Dybantsa is a three-level scorer who creates opportunities for himself and others, excelling in the open court as an elite ball handler. There’s also a lot of upside defensively, considering he can guard one through four and is a fierce competitor.\n\nInitially a rising junior, the 17-year-old reclassified to the class of 2025, as he and Cam Boozer are expected to be the top prospects coming out of college in 2026.\n\nTyran Stokes: Oakland Soldiers (CA)\n\nStokes and Dybnatsa were teammates this past season at Prolific Prep and have continued to make the case as the top one-two punch in high school basketball for the Oakland Soldiers.\n\nStokes is a big-bodied bruiser that impacts the game in every way imaginable. At 6-foot-8, the 16-year-old is a highly skilled finisher, passer and rebounder. Stokes currently operates on the wing and the block, as his game will continue opening up as his jump shot improves.\n\nDarius Acuff Jr.: The Family (MI)\n\nAcuff Jr. is a dynamic playmaker who also pesters guards on defense. As shifty as they come at 6-foot-2, he’s able to get his shoulders past most, attacking the rim like a running back exploding out of an open hole.\n\nA strong frame, long wingspan and a versatile offensive package are reasons why the rising IMG Academy senior is regarded as one of the top guards on the summer circuit."
