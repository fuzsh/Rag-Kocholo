        "text": "From 1960s mods to 1980s skinheads, British subcultures have thrived to varying degrees in Australia despite many seemingly quintessentially alien on its shores. Supposedly, Joe Strummer noted with surprise the preponderance of punks and skinheads “with suntans” attending gigs on the Clash’s 1982 tour of Australia.\n\nWhile some subcultures have a natural shelf life, northern soul aficionados are a notable exception. If anything, the older “soulies” get, the more passionate they become. And now, as a film about northern soul’s 1970s heyday gains traction in the UK, Australians old and young are reactivating the scene, especially in Melbourne.\n\nAmong the hundreds turning up on a weekly basis to the Cherry Bar on AC/DC lane, some may not understand the nuances or even identify themselves with their original forebears, but an increased interest in the music is undeniable.\n\nThat music has it roots in up-tempo black American soul 1960s and 70s soul, which found favour in working class regions of northern England (hence the name). A northern soul playlist rarely reads like a greatest hits CD; the average Joe or Jane won’t subliminally recognise the sounds of a Vietnam War soundtrack or the latest TV advert. And forget Motown’s headline acts – or at least their most famous work.\n\nDig a little deeper and it’s the authentic sounds of the DJ’s turntable combined with northern soul’s dance moves – and dress sense – that create its distinct flavour. With a lineage dating back to the mods (and their various offshoots down the decades), there is no shortage of sharp suits on the floor. And the dancefloor action of flips, kick and spin is sharper still, especially considering the age of some soulies today.\n\nVeteran Melbourne northern soul DJ Vince Peach estimates the average hardcore fan turning up at Australia’s National Soul Weekender – this year in Brisbane from 24 to 26 October – is in their 40s. Plenty are older: “I’m always expecting someone to have a heart attack but it’s never happened yet,” he says through a still-thick Scouse drawl.\n\nPeach was imbued with the northern soul spirit during his formative years in Liverpool and has been DJing virtually from the start of the scene. Now in his 60s (not that his tireless small hours at the turntable would suggest it), he has found himself accommodating a younger audience, drawn in primarily by word of mouth.\n\nIn an age where the word indie can mean mainstream in fashion and music, perhaps this seeming nostalgia makes sense among the new breed. Like any self-respecting subculture, northern soul accommodates those who are consciously or sub-consciously seeking refuge away from the pack.\n\n“They can see it’s real,” says Peach of his young attendees. “It used to be that most younger people coming were from mod culture, but now we get ordinary kids that have heard of this great music and start coming along.” The Sydney scene has yet to match Melbourne’s Cherry Bar, he adds. “Though that is probably more to do with licensing laws, than anything else.”\n\nPerhaps some of that authenticity is stamped on the records – normally original pressings – used in the DJ booth. Rare vinyl featuring favoured artists “regularly goes for four figures”, a telling sign of the singular passion of its enthusiasts. But young people are into the records too, says Peach. “They come and ask about it, or they take photos and want to hunt them out themselves. The record shop scene is probably as healthy as it has ever been. And practically every pub in Melbourne has turntables these days. It has all been a revelation.”\n\nThe scope of the northern soul catalogue evolved as black American contemporary music shifted, and has been broadening ever since. “It doesn’t matter if the artist is black, white or pink, as long as it sounds right,” says Peach. And what constitutes the right sound? “It has to have the right groove definitely. A good voice, and a good tempo. Real instruments, nothing electronic.” Playing digital music is unthinkable.\n\nAustralian artists boast an unlikely connection to northern soul. Several homegrown songs are very much in demand including Lynne Randell’s Stranger In My Arms which, according to Peach is “one of the most sublime pieces of northern soul you will ever hear”. In Australia and the US, the song was a B-side to the questionable Eurovision-tinged 1967 hit Ciao Baby. But that’s in keeping with the northern soul spirit: the more obscure the better. “There was a constant surge by the DJs to turn up songs that none of the other DJs had access to,” Peach says.\n\nThe biggest Australian record in the UK scene at the moment is the Marcia Hines track You Gotta Let Go which, but for the take-up by soulies, would have remained largely forgotten after its mid-70s release. Doug Parkinson’s 1978 version of Stranger In My Arms is another popular song with Aussie origins and more evidence of the cross-section of artists in the modern northern soul playlist."
