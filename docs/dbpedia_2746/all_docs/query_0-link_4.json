        "text": "Port Fairy Folk Festival has announced an exciting and global line-up for 2025, with renowned folk musicians from around the world ready to descend upon the stunning seaside destination of Port Fairy over the March long weekend.\n\nThe 48th Port Fairy Folk Festival is shaping up to be an enticing musical fusion of international and local artists, with fresh faces and returning artists destined to bring joy to the festival’s devoted and music-loving audience.\n\nSTRAWBERRY FIELDS 2024 LIVE MUSIC ACT & DJ COMPETITION\n\nApplications for the Live Music Act & DJ Competition are open, closing on September 8. It’s not often you get the chance to perform for 13,000+ people in the beautiful Australian bush - but this is exactly the opportunity Strawberry Fields Festival will be giving to live musicians and DJs alike for its landmark 15th anniversary edition.\n\nBorn out of a deep love for the dance floor, Wrong Way Up is the Melbourne-based Afro-synth duo of vocalists/songwriters Emmanuela Degery and ADP. Together they channel vintage Afro disco and psychedelic boogie to bring a new kind of heat.\n\nPaying homage to Frances Bebey, William Onyeabor and Lijadu Sisters, Wrong Way Up delivers energetic melodies, deep grooves and addictive chants. Featuring quirky synthesizers and 1970s drum machines, their new EP Full Blast on Soundway Records is a sonic landscape that feels fresh and unique.\n\nThis week’s PBS Feature Album is PLASMATA, the sophomore record from four-piece funk-punk ensemble Proto Moro.\n\nPLASMATA draws inspiration from Greek mythology, the stories of Medusa and Hephaestus serving as a statement to the environmental atrocities being committed by mining companies and big corporations on Indigenous Country today. The anxiety that comes with the destruction that capitalism has created embodies itself within the instruments and voices of Proto Moro, giving the record its explosive sound.\n\nThis week’s PBS Feature Album is the debut record In The Space You Carry by local multi-instrumentalist Darvid Thor.\n\nIn The Space You Carry is a catharsis from youth, a shedding of skin. Leaning into the cinematic and orchestral spaces within the indie and alternative music idiom, Darvid’s absorbing, photosynthetic, warped, beautiful music reminds us to slow down, take a breath, and take stock of what’s around us.\n\nEntries have opened for the annual UpStart Award, closing at midnight on August 31.\n\nThe UpStart Award is an annual grant for emerging Victorian singer-songwriters. Each year the winner of the award receives a grant of $10,000, with 2nd place receiving $3000 and 3rd place receiving $2000. The remaining 7 artists, who make up the top 10, will receive a grant of $1000. The award is funded by a music loving family in Melbourne and the winner will be decided by a panel of local artists and music experts.\n\nThis week’s PBS Feature Album is Megaflower, the third studio album from Brisbane/Meanjin rock group Full Flower Moon Band.\n\nProduced by frontwoman Kate Dillon aka Babyshakes, Megaflower features the full five-piece, triple-guitar line-up that audiences have grown accustomed to over the last two years of must-see live shows. Presenting a new direction for the band, their latest release emphasises expansion and diversity rather than just intensifying their rock sound."
