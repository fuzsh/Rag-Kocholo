With the 2014 Reclink Community Cup just a few weeks away, it's now to reveal the line up for the annual AFL clash between the community radio Megahertz and the Rockdogs, comprised of Melbourne's Rock n' Roll royalty.

Tim Rogers will captain the Rockdogs under the direction of coach Tex Perkins. Members of Bitter Sweet Kicks, King Of The North, Smudge, Le Bastard, The Stevens, Nation Blue, Even, The UV Race, Cash Savage & The Last Drinks, Bowers, Saskwatch and The Pretty Littles as well as Fraser A. Gorman, Dan Sultan, Dave Larkin and Mark Evans from AC/DC round out the squad.

The Megahertz will feature a splendid selection of community broadcasters from both Triple R 102.7FM and PBS 106.7FM. They’ll be lead by Co-Captains, Emma Peel (Switched On – PBS) and Stew Farrell (Breakfasters - Triple R), plus Director of Coaching Neil Rogers (The Australian Mood – Triple R), Coach Vince Peach (Soul Time – PBS), Assistant Coaches DQ (PBS/Triple R Swami) and Tim Harrington (Triple R Breakfasters Sports Guy), Club Strapper Pauly P (Livewire - Triple R), Club Administrator Crispi Winsor (PBS) and Megahertz President Jon Von Goes (JVG Radio Method – Triple R).

The event is a celebration of Melbourne’s dynamic music and community broadcasting scene. The teams aim to reflect the diversity of the communities from which they’re drawn, with a focus on fun, safety and respect for other players and of course the umpires. Proceeds from the day are donated to Reclink Australia.

Reclink Community Cup is a fun family day out, with children’s activities, food and beverage stalls and an opportunity for a grass roots kick-to-kick for crowd members during match breaks. Performers on the day include Painters & Dockers, Saskwatch, The Smith Street Band, Fraser A. Gorman, David Bridie and Elmo & Friends
