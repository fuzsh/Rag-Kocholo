The Winners of the 2006 Drama Desk Awards were announced last night (Sun 21 May) at an event hosted by Harvey Fierstein at the LaGuardia Concert Hall at the Lincoln Center.

This has been a good year for imports on Broadway. The Canadian musical Drowsy Chaperone won seven awards and British originated production, The History Boys by Alan Bennett was awarded five, followed by John Doyle's revival of the British originated production Sweeney Todd.

It was a disappointing evening for See What I Wanna See, although nomiated for 9 awards, it walked away empty handed, as did The Wedding Singer which had received 8 nominations. Grey Gardens was nominated for twelve awards, but picked up only one, and the Jersey Boys, which was hotly tipped to do well, had to settle for just two awards, despite the show's eight nominations.

The Drowsy Chaperone: 7

Special Awards:

Each year, the Drama Desk votes special awards to recognize excellence and significant contributions to the theater. For 2005/2006, these awards went to:

To the BMIÃ¯Â¿Â½Lehman Engel Musical Theater Workshop for nurturing, developing and promoting new talent for the musical theater.

To The York Theatre Company for its vital contributions to theater by developing and presenting new musicals.

To Sh-K-Boom and its label Ghostlight Records for dedication to the preservation of musical theater through cast recordings.

The Drama Desk also presented the following special award:

A lifetime achievement award to Horton Foote for his 'bountiful body of work that sensitively explores the human condition'.

The Drama Desk was founded in 1949 to explore key issues in the theater and to bring together critics and writers in an organization to support the ongoing development of theater in New York. The organization began presenting its awards in 1955, and it is the only criticsÃ¯Â¿Â½ organization to honor achievement in the theater with competition between Broadway, Off Broadway and Off-Off Broadway productions.
