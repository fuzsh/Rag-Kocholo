        "text": "Correction Appended\n\nDrama Desk Awards\n\nWith seven prizes, including outstanding musical, \"The Drowsy Chaperone\" led the way when the 51st annual Drama Desk Awards, which were to be announced Sunday night in ceremonies at La Guardia Concert Hall. Among plays, the big winner was Alan Bennett's \"History Boys,\" with five awards, including outstanding play. The four awards for \"Sweeney Todd\" included outstanding revival of a musical, and the two prizes for Clifford Odets's \"Awake and Sing!\" included outstanding revival of a play. Honors for outstanding actor and actress in a play went to Richard Griffiths for \"The History Boys\" and Lois Smith for \"The Trip to Bountiful.\" John Lloyd Young of \"Jersey Boys\" and Christine Ebersole of \"Grey Gardens\" were named outstanding actor and actress in a musical. Honors for performances in featured roles went to Jim Dale of \"The Threepenny Opera\" and Beth Leavel of \"The Drowsy Chaperone\" for musicals and to Samuel Barnett and Frances de la Tour, both of \"The History Boys.\" Accolades for directing went to Nicholas Hytner of \"The History Boys\" and John Doyle of \"Sweeney Todd,\" and Kathleen Marshall won for her choreography of \"The Pajama Game.\" The award for outstanding solo performance went to Anthony Sher for \"Primo.\"\n\nDixie Chick Takes Back Her Apology\n\nNatalie Maines, right, of the Dixie Chicks wants to take it back. No, not her 2003 expression of shame that \"the President of the United States is from Texas.\" She wants to take back her apology. In an interview with Time magazine for \"Radical Chicks,\" the cover story of the issue out today, Ms. Maines, who is promoting the band's new album, \"Taking the Long Way\" (Open Wide/ Monument/Columbia), said: \"I apologized for disrespecting the office of the president. But I don't feel that way anymore. I don't feel he is owed any respect whatsoever.\" After Ms. Maines made her initial comment when she was performing in London with the other Chicks, Emily Robison and Martie Maguire, on the eve of the war in Iraq, radio stations in the United States reported protests from angry listeners, and some stations dropped the Chicks from their playlists. Members of the band, which has won multiple Grammy Awards, received death threats. Billboard reported on Friday that the first two singles from the new album, to be issued tomorrow, had received disappointing airplay: \"Not Ready to Make Nice,\" a response to those who threatened the Dixie Chicks with death, peaked at No. 36 on the Hot Country Songs chart and began to descend after seven weeks, and \"Everybody Knows\" stood at No. 50, down two notches in its fourth week. \"Not Ready to Make Nice\" never moved higher than 32 on the Adult Contemporary chart.\n\nKatharina Wagner Ousts 'Meistersinger' Designer\n\nKatharina Wagner, the 28-year-old great-granddaughter of Richard Wagner who is to stage his \"Meistersinger\" at the Bayreuth Festival in Germany next year, has dismissed her set designer, Alexander Dodge, Agence France-Presse reported. The two worked together on four other operas that she had directed since 2002. In a statement the festival attributed the parting to \"insurmountable artistic differences\" and said, \"Since the success of the production is paramount for both of them, Katharina Wagner and Alexander Dodge have decided amicably and in the interest of the festival to suspend their collaboration for this staging.\" The organizers said that Tilo Steffens would replace Mr. Dodge and that Michaela Barth had been appointed costume designer. \"The premiere will take place as planned on July 25, 2007,\" they said. Ms. Wagner is the daughter of Wolfgang Wagner, 86, who wants her to run the festival when he steps down.\n\nStolen 'Harry Potter' Car Is Found in Castle\n\nThe flying car from the \"Harry Potter\" films that vanished last year rather miraculously (since it has no engine), has been recovered. Fittingly, it turned up at a mist-shrouded ruin, the 14th-century Carn Brea Castle in Cornwall, England, Agence France-Presse reported. The battered blue 1962 Ford Anglia seen in the films based on the J. K. Rowling novels, was stolen last year from a high-security South West Film Studios lot in St. Agnes in Cornwall. The Sun of London reported that a gang tried to sell the car last week, but when the prospective buyers, who were led to a storage area, noticed that it was missing its license plate (7990 TD), the deal fell through. Then the gang moved the car to the castle. \"We received an anonymous call from someone telling us its location,\" said Tim Roberts, a police officer. \"It still seems to be in good order, and I would guess whoever left it there did so with their tongue firmly in their cheek. I'd love to think Harry himself had driven it there to take part in some adventure at the castle, but the reality is probably a little less interesting.\"\n\nBasketball and Wrestling Compete for Viewers\n\nCBS won the concluding Friday of the official television season in Nielsen's estimates. Its season finale of \"Numbers\" (12.49 million) was the night's most-watched show. Another returning CBS crime show, \"Close to Home\" (9.64 million), also ended its season. For the week that ended on May 14, USA Network's \"WWE Monday Night Raw\" topped the list of the most-watched shows on basic cable, with 5.42 million viewers. But TNT's playoff basketball coverage put that channel in first place in prime time overall among total viewers and adults 18 to 49. In that age group, wrestling and basketball, also on ESPN, occupied 8 of the top 10 slots for the week. The two entertainment shows that nudged their way in were the May 9 \"Real World\" (1.83 million 18-to-49-year-olds) on MTV and the Discovery Channel's \"Deadliest Catch\" (1.61 million 18-to-49-year-olds), also on May 9. KATE AURTHUR\n\nHemingway Papers in Cuba Are Being Sent to U.S.\n\nMore than 20,000 documents relating to Ernest Hemingway are being sent by Cuba to the United States as part of an agreement to restore and digitize them, the BBC reported. Marta Arjona, the president of National Council for Cultural Heritage in Cuba, called the papers an \"invaluable\" gift of material from 1939 to 1960, when Hemingway spent much of his time in Cuba. The papers include letters in which Hemingway discussed World War II and the Spanish Civil War. She said that under the agreement, experts from the United States have traveled to Cuba to help restore the Museo Ernest Hemingway, in the house where Hemingway lived.\n\nMasked Lordi Wins Eurovision Crown\n\nThe Finnish heavy-metal mock-satanic band Lordi won the 51st Eurovision Song Contest in Athens on Saturday, touching off an ecstatic celebration yesterday in Helsinki. The masked and horned quintet, with its eight-foot retractable latex wings, won with a rendition of \"Hard Rock Hallelujah,\" prompting its bat-winged frontman, Mr. Lordi (real name Tomi Putaansuu), to ask: \"How cool is this? We're a rock band, and we just won a pop-song contest.\" With 292 points, Finland finished ahead of the Russian heartthrob Dima Bilan (248) and the folk group Mata Hari (229) from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Agence France-Presse reported. Although some Finns had feared that Lordi would put the country in a bad light, the band's victory prompted widespread elation, The Associated Press reported. President Tarja Halonen sent a congratulatory telegram, and Culture Minister Tanja Karpela said the victory, decided by a popular vote among 600 million viewers, demonstrated that Finnish music could be successful abroad. Lordi's victory also means that next year's contest will be held in Finland."
