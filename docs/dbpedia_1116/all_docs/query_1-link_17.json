        "text": "Randall Hickman and Douglas Davis bring the hysterical, Broadway hit musical “The Drowsy Chaperone” to the Welk Resort this August.\n\nWith 5 Tony awards, and 7 Drama Desk awards under its belt, “The Drowsy Chaperone” dominated the 2006 New York Theater season. The rarely produced gem of a show is “a show within a show,” a loving parody of the American musical comedies of the 1920s. The story centers around a middle-aged, asocial musical theater fan; as he plays the record of his favorite musical, the (fictional) 1928 hit “The Drowsy Chaperone,” the show comes to life – onstage – in his New York apartment. When the fridge door opens – out pops an actor. A Murphy Bed lowers from the wall to reveal another character. And wait until you see where an airplane comes from!\n\nThe New York Times said: “The gods of timing, who are just as crucial to success in show business as mere talent is, have smiled brightly upon “The Drowsy Chaperone.”\n\nUnder the direction of award winning Director/Choreographer, Ray Limon, a cast of 13 triple threat performers are set to take the Welk Resort stage by storm as they bring this NEW, OLD FASHIONED musical to life.\n\nRegular price tickets for this production are $35. Call Doug Davis at 760-806-7905 between 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. daily.\n\nProduction dates are August 4 – 27. Shows are Thursday, Saturday and Sunday at 1 p.m. and Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m."
