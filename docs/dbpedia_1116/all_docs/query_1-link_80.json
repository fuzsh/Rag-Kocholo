        "text": "Poway High School’s Titan Theatre, choir and music programs present “The Drowsy Chaperone,” opening Friday at the Poway Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nThe show will run for two weekends, with performances at 7 p.m. Friday and Saturday and Friday, Feb. 10 and 2 and 7 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 11. All performances will be at the PCPA, 15498 Espola Road next to the high school.\n\n“The Drowsy Chaperone” is a modern parody of American musical comedies of the 1920s. It opened on Broadway in 2006 and won five Tony awards and seven Drama Desk awards.\n\nDirector Sharon Wezelman said the show was really fun and that it has some larger-than-life characters.\n\nIn the show, Man in Chair, an agoraphobic Broadway fanatic, puts on a recording of his favorite 1928 fictional musical, “The Drowsy Chaperone.” As he listens to it, the characters appear and his apartment is transformed into a Broadway set. The Man in Chair provides a running commentary about the show to the audience, breaking the fourth wall.\n\n“It flashes between him and the show,” said Wezelman. “It’s a show within a show.”\n\nThis is the first time Poway High School has performed “The Drowsy Chaperone,” Wezelman said.\n\nJust as in PHS’ fall musical, “Stage Door,” Wezelman said the understudies will be in a show. “The understudies did really well (in “Stage Door”) and were excited to actually get a show and not just learn the role in case of an emergency,” she said. “(Having the leads and understudies work together) has been really nice, they’ve been working together well and helping each other learn the parts.”\n\nThe show stars Marisa Cooper as Mrs. Tottendale, Jake Hardison as Underling, Trevor Haumschilt as Aldolpho, John Lettang as Robert, Summer Scott as Kitty, Zachary Nunn as George, Jadyn Ponder as Gangster No. 2, Leif Proctor as Man in Chair, Audrey Stillwell as the Drowsy Chaperone, Cassidy Stillwell as Gangster No. 1, Austin Thatcher as Feldzieg, Kate Thorvick as Janet and Cassie Walker as Trix.\n\nThe understudies are Scott Bedford (Robert), Sarah Butikofer (Janet), Joy Dorko (the Drowsy Chaperone), Adam Hunter (Aldolpho), Emma Mansfield (Mrs. Tottendale), Natalie Marriott (Kitty) and Ben Pattinson (George).\n\nAll the cast members have previous experience in acting, many in prior school productions and several with outside theater companies such as Christian Youth Theater and California Youth Conservatory Theater.\n\nDorko said that the show was really different. “It’s a commentary on stereotypical Broadway musicals,” she said.\n\nSeveral cast members said they weren’t previously familiar with the show but enjoy how funny it is. “It’s pretty ridiculous,” said Scott, “but it’s so ridiculous it’s funny.”\n\n“This is a meta show,” said Hardison. “It speaks a lot to things we love and love to hate about musical theater. It’s very touching in that way. It’s a musical for fans of musicals.”\n\nTickets are $15 for adults, $13 for kids, students and seniors. Tickets are available through the PCPA box office, by calling 858-748-0505, online at powaycenter.com or at the door.\n\nCorrection: The previous version of this story listed Summer Scott as the understudy in the role of Kitty and Natalie Marriott as the lead. Scott is in the lead role of Kitty and Marriott is the understudy.\n\nEmail: news@pomeradonews.com"
