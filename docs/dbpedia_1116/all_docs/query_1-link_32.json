        "text": "In a year crowded with new musicals, \"The Drowsy Chaperone,\" a postmodern paean to the tinny musicals of the 1920's, led the field yesterday with 13 Tony Award nominations, including best musical, best direction and best leading actor and actress.\n\nFollowing close behind was \"The Color Purple,\" the musical adaptation of Alice Walker's novel, known around Broadway as the Show That Oprah Winfrey Made, with 11 nominations, including best musical and four acting nominations.\n\nBut despite those shows' tallies, the Tony nominating committee spread the joy, giving a nod to more than half of the shows that opened on Broadway during the 2005-6 season.\n\n\"Jersey Boys,\" the musical biography of the Four Seasons and considered — until the romp of \"The Drowsy Chaperone\" yesterday morning — the odds-on favorite in the new musical category, picked up eight nominations, including one for John Lloyd Young, who plays Frankie Valli. \"The Wedding Singer,\" the musical adaptation of Adam Sandler's 1998 movie, rounded out the category with five nominations. The show's leading actor, Stephen Lynch, who was making his Broadway debut, also picked up one.\n\nThe 60th annual Tony Awards ceremony will be broadcast on CBS on June 11 from Radio City Music Hall.\n\nAs always, what made the list quickly took a backseat in Broadway conversation to what did not. Julia Roberts, for example, did not win a leading actress nomination for her performance in the sold-out revival of Richard Greenberg's \"Three Days of Rain.\" The show ended up with only two nominations, for scenic and lighting design.\n\nThe corporate players also had a mixed day: Transamerica's production of \"Hot Feet\" was ignored, while Disney's \"Tarzan\" received only one nomination, for lighting design. Time Warner fared only slightly better; Warner Brothers' first venture into musicals — \"Lestat\" — picked up two nominations, for Carolee Carmello as best featured actress and for costume design. New Line Cinema, a division of Time Warner, did better than its corporate cousin, with \"The Wedding Singer,\" which it co-produced.\n\nSome of the big veteran Broadway players were bruised as well: the two Neil Simon revivals, \"The Odd Couple\" and \"Barefoot in the Park,\" were ignored entirely, while Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical \"The Woman in White\" picked up only one nomination, for best original score.\n\nBut the British imports and the nonprofit theaters had another excellent showing. In the new-play category, Alan Bennett's \"History Boys,\" unsurprisingly, led the way with seven nominations, three of them for acting. \"The Lieutenant of Inishmore,\" a comic bloodbath by the Irish playwright Martin McDonagh, was close behind with five, followed by David Lindsay-Abaire's \"Rabbit Hole,\" the only play by an American playwright, and Conor McPherson's \"Shining City,\" both produced by Manhattan Theater Club.\n\nThe musical revival category was dominated by the Roundabout Theater's production of \"The Pajama Game,\" which picked up nine nominations, including ones for Harry Connick Jr. as leading actor and Kelli O'Hara as leading actress. John Doyle's stark re-creation of \"Sweeney Todd\" was close behind with six, followed by the Roundabout's \"Threepenny Opera.\"\n\nClifford Odets's \"Awake and Sing!,\" produced by Lincoln Center Theater, led the play revival category with eight nominations, including three for acting. The other plays in the category were Edward Albee's \"Seascape\" (also a Lincoln Center production); \"The Constant Wife,\" W. Somerset Maugham's 1926 play revived by the Roundabout Theater; and Brian Friel's \"Faith Healer,\" for which Ralph Fiennes picked up a leading actor nomination.\n\nMr. Fiennes, who plays the mesmerizing title character, will compete against Richard Griffiths, the steadfastly impractical teacher in \"The History Boys\"; Oliver Platt, a guilt-plagued widower in \"Shining City\"; David Wilmot, the casually violent terrorist in \"The Lieutenant of Inishmore\"; and Zeljko Ivanek, the barely hinged Captain Queeg in \"The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial,\" which closes on Sunday.\n\nThese performances differ from those in the leading actress category in that — until Sunday, at least — you can still see them. All of the plays in the leading actress nominations have closed. Lynn Redgrave and Kate Burton both picked up nominations for their droll mother-daughter performances in the revival of \"The Constant Wife\"; Cynthia Nixon won a spot for her work as a grieving mother in \"Rabbit Hole,\" as did Judy Kaye, who played a tone-deaf socialite in \"Souvenir,\" and Lisa Kron, for her performance in her recently closed autobiographical show, \"Well.\"\n\nIn most cases, the notable absences are within categories, not entire categories themselves. But an exception is the brand-new award for best performance by an actor or actress in a recreated role, which was expected to go to either Jonathan Pryce for stepping into \"Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,\" or Harvey Fierstein for recreating the role of Tevye in \"Fiddler on the Roof.\" To the surprise of many, no award will be given this year in this category.\n\nThe Antoinette Perry Awards, as they are officially known, are administered by the League of American Theaters and Producers, the industry trade association, and the American Theater Wing, a charitable group that founded the Tonys in 1947. The nominations were made by a committee of 23 theater professionals, and there are approximately 750 eligible Tony voters, including actors, writers, producers, stagehands, press agents and theater owners.\n\nSince the first ceremony — a dinner at the Waldorf-Astoria, where prizes included money clips and cigarette lighters — the awards have become Broadway's top honor for artistic achievement. And since 1967, when the show was first televised nationwide, the ceremony has also become a high-profile marketing opportunity, three valuable hours to exhibit Broadway to people living outside of the New York area, a demographic that in recent years has risen to well over half the Broadway audience.\n\nThe awards include only theaters of a certain size in Manhattan — the Broadway theaters — though there is an annual award given to a regional theater for excellence. This year the award will go to the Intiman Theater in Seattle."
