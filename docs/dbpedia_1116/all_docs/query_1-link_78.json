        "text": "A modern musical theatre addict is feeling glum, so to cheer himself up he plays the soundtrack of his favourite musical, the 1928 comedy The Drowsy Chaperone. As the hi-fi crackles into life, so does the musical, in the middle of the stage. It tells the story of a Broadway starlet who wants to swap performing for a life of wedded bliss, her producer who wants to stop her, her chaperone, the debonair groom, the dizzy chorine, the Latin lover and a couple of gangsters who double as pastry chefs.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone opened in New York in 2006 and went on to win Tony Awards, Drama Desk Awards, Outer Critics’ Circle Awards and Drama Critics’ Circle Awards.\n\nThe multi award-winning performer Elaine Paige makes her return to the West End stage in the title role.\n\nFor more information on this production read The First Night Feature or The Big Interview with Elaine Paige."
