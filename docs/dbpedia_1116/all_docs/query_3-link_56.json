        "text": "By Alyssa Erspamer\n\nHave you ever had difficulty in deciding whether to see an over-the-top musical or a snarky comedy? Well, The Drowsy Chaperone, South’s winter musical, is a mixture of both. It’s literally “a musical within a comedy,” as actor Alex Lau said.\n\nThe play is technically set in the modern day, opening with a scene of actor Andrew Hardigg reclining on a couch and talking directly to the audience about musical theatre, specifically, his favorite show: The Drowsy Chaperone. Hardigg puts on a record and sits on his couch listening to the music as actors come out and add words, actions, and glamour for the audience.\n\nAll characters but Hardigg are in the musical The Drowsy Chaperone, which is set in the ‘20s. Throughout the show, Hardigg comments sporadically, adding humor to the dazzling musical.\n\n“It’s a classic ‘20s-style musical, but wrapped in the modern, or contemporary day,” said Jeff Knoedler, the director of the production. “[Hardigg’s character] is like us—sort of cynical, sort of snarky, sort of ironic.”\n\nThe other characters, on the other hand, are almost too much, each with a very specific persona that remains constant throughout the show. There is an excessive and exotic European, an extremely forgetful and slightly crazy old lady, a stiff and statuesque butler, and two small and tough gangsters. In addition, there is a colorful and elaborate ensemble.\n\n“The ensemble puts the extra ‘umph’ in the production,” production member Sophie Cash said.\n\nThe ensemble, like all of the characters, is dressed in amazing costumes that are both excessively glittery and of the time period. Thus, there are many flappers.\n\nEmma Spector, one of the six dancers who taps and performs throughout the show, feels that the costumes better the show. “I have six different costumes that I wear throughout the show and all of them help add to the story in some way, even if it’s just to make the audience smile,” she said.\n\nThe costumes were designed by two students, Eugi Zeng and Sophie Veksler, and the school’s costume designer, Martha Heller. Most of the main characters have several costumes throughout the show, as does the ensemble, and there are several quick changes, including one that happens onstage behind a curtain of umbrellas.\n\n“We like making [the costumes] intricate and detailed,” Zeng said. “It’s really the details that make the show. If something is sloppy the audience takes note.” Zeng acknowledges that the musical takes some courageous decisions concerning quick changes, but she believes the final result is worth it.\n\n“[The costumes] are so flamboyant and sparkly and just so out there,” said Brianna McIsaac, a props master.\n\nThe set, on the other hand, is more subdued. On the left of the stage there is a little room full of playbills and objects where Hardigg is situated throughout the musical. But other than the corner of the stage, there is not too much else set-wise. There is a big structure in the background, and the ensemble wheels on and off various pieces like a couch or a mirror.\n\n“The set is the imagination of [Hardigg],” said Ella Belfer, the set designer. “So big structural pieces but not so much an incredibly detailed set. It also contrasts with his clustered studio.”\n\nThis setting worked for the dance numbers, as they often times include practically the whole cast, and the stage can get very crowded. The dancing is so important to this musical due to its many numbers—twelve. The music in this show is different than other musicals done at South, such as last year’s Beauty and the Beast. It is jazzier, representing the style of the ‘20s.\n\n“I really enjoy the music and I love the whole twenties vibe,” said Zoe Clayton, who plays the drowsy chaperone. “The music really gets me—very catchy and inspiring. You sing [the songs] all the time and it gets annoying but I love it.”\n\nThe music is played by a pit orchestra under the stage, comprised of students and professionals alike. One trumpet player, Paul Perfetti, played for Les Misérables for 20 years and participated in two national tours of the show.\n\n“I like how in this orchestra professionals and students are working side by side. It’s beneficial for the kids coming up learning,” he said.\n\nBut beyond the music, the dancing, and the story, there is another intriguing element. It, as is becoming almost a tradition, stars Principal Joel Stembridge in a minor role. Stembridge did theatre in high school and college, and used to teach a theatre class.\n\n“I love the concept of it,” Stembridge said. “It’s all in [Hardigg’s] mind, and the audience gets taken along for the ride.”\n\nThe show will be premiering at South Feb. 7 at 7:30. Tickets for Friday night and Saturday night will be honored on Sunday at 2:00 and 7:30, respectively."
