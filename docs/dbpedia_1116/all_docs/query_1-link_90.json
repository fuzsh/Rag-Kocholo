As the houselights dim, a man in a chair appears on stage and puts on his favorite record: the cast recording of a fictitious 1928 musical. The recording comes to life as the man in the chair looks on.\n\nThe 20-member cast includes junior theater arts majors Leah Dalrymple of Simi Valley, Malissa Marlow of Thousand Oaks, Kevin Repich of Simi Valley and Chris Reynolds-Baldwin of Moreno Valley, as well as freshman Andrew Cervantes of Simi Valley.\n\nKen Gardner, chair of CLU’s theater arts department, directs. Music lecturer Heidi Valencia Vas provides musical direction, and music professor Daniel Geeting conducts the orchestra.\n\nBarbara Wegher-Thompson, a senior adjunct faculty member in the theater arts department, is the choreographer.\n\nAdmission is $20."
