        "meta_description": "Our season begins with a classic comedy musical! A humorous and lovable homage to the 1920s Jazz Age of musical theatre, this show-within-a-show follows mistaken identities, dream sequences, thugs disguised as chefs, and an anxiety-riddled narrator whose love for the show at times causes even more confusion and chaos. Winner of five Tony awards, including best book and best original score, in addition to seven Drama Desk Awards, including outstanding musical!Music and Lyrics by Lisa Lambert, Greg MorrisonBook by Bob Martin, Don McKellarAugust 22 &#8211; September 14, 2024Musical",
