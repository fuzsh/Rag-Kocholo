        "text": "To close out Celebrate the Arts Week 2024, Shorecrest Performing Arts presented the musical “The Drowsy Chaperone” on April 18-20 in the Janet Root Theatre. Winner of five Tony Awards including Best Book and Best Original Score, “The Drowsy Chaperone” is a loving send-up of the Golden Age musical, featuring one show-stopping song and dance number after another.\n\nWith the house lights down, a man in a chair appears on stage and puts on his favorite record: the cast recording of a fictitious 1928 musical. The recording comes to life as the man in the chair looks on. Mix in two lovers on the eve of their wedding, a bumbling best man, a desperate theatre producer, a not-so-bright hostess, two gangsters posing as pastry chefs, a misguided Don Juan, mistaken identities, dream sequences, and an intoxicated chaperone – and you have the ingredients for a madcap evening!\n\nA cast of students in grades 8-12 were directed by Michael McCarthy, Shorecrest Upper School Musical Theatre Teacher. Choreography by Jill Godfrey. DrewMcKinney was Technical Director.\n\nView Photos\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone was presented through special arrangement with Music Theatre International (MTI). All authorized performance materials are also supplied by MTI. www.mtishows.com.\n\nTHE DROWSY CHAPERONE\n\nMusic & Lyrics by Book by\n\nLisa Lambert and Greg Morrison Bob Martin and Don McKellar\n\nOriginal Broadway production of The Drowsy Chaperone produced by Kevin McCollum, Roy Miller, Bob Boyett, Stephanie McClelland, Barbara Freitag and Jill Furman.\n\n#UpperSchool #MiddleSchool #Arts #Troupe3140 #ShorecrestTroupe3140 #ShorecrestArts #CelebratetheArts"
