My Very Own British Invasion is produced in association with Hal Luftig, Craig Haffner and Rodney Rigby. My Very Own British Invasion will begin performances Thursday, Jan 31, 2019, and will continue through Sunday, Mar 3, 2019, at Paper Mill Playhouse. My Very Own British Invasion is generously supported by The Blanche and Irving Laurie Foundation and sponsored by JPMorgan Chase & Co. Paper Mill Playhouse’s 2018–2019 season is proudly sponsored by Investors Bank.\n\nDirected and choreographed by Jerry Mitchell (Kinky Boots, Paper Mill’s Half Time), and with music direction by Lon Hoyt (On Your Feet!), the principal cast will feature newcomer Jonny Amies as Peter, Bryan Fenkart (Waitress) as John, Erika Olson (Beautiful: The Carole King Musical) as Pamela, Kyle Taylor Parker (Kinky Boots) as Gino, Conor Ryan (Desperate Measures) as Trip, John Sanders (Groundhog Day) as Fallon, and Daniel Stewart Sherman (Kinky Boots) as The Hammer. They will be joined by Travis Artz, Gemma Baird, John Campione, Emma Degerstedt, Trista Dollison, Jay Donnell, Graham Scott Fleming, Douglas Goodhart, Cory Jeacoma, Sage Melcher, Jen Perry, and Daniel Yearwood.\n\nThis world-premiere musical tells a fable of young love, set against the backdrop of the exploding 1960s music scene–when England launched the little dustup that became known as the British Invasion. Based on the experiences of Peter Noone of Herman’s Hermits, who was just a teenager willing to sacrifice international stardom for the sake of girl he loves, the show features more than two dozen chart-topping hits from all the best British bands of the era.\n\nThe production team includes scenic design by David Rockwell, costume design by Gregg Barnes, lighting design by Kenneth Posner, sound design by Andrew Keister, projection design by Andrew Lazarow, and hair and wig design by Josh Marquette. The production stage manager is Tripp Phillips. Casting is by Telsey + Company, Patrick Goodwin, CSA. Jonny Amies is appearing with the permission of Actors’ Equity Association. Paper Mill Playhouse gratefully acknowledges Actors’ Equity Association for its assistance of this production.\n\n“I was 16 when I walked into the Bag O’ Nails in London for the first time. I had the number one record in England (“I’m Into Something Good”) and John Lennon got me a drink as I sat and watched the hoi polloi of what is now known as the British Invasion—Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Twiggy, Richard Harris, Marianne Faithfull, Mick Jagger, Mary Quant, and many more. Somehow the music had connected us all! Each person had a song that went with their character and I knew this musical story was meant to be put on a stage.”\n\n–Peter Noone, singer-songwriter, guitarist, pianist and actor, best known as Herman of the successful 1960s pop group Herman's Hermits.\n\nMy Very Own British Invasion will be performed at Paper Mill Playhouse eight times a week, Wed–Sun. Performance schedule: Wed at 7:30PM, Thur at 1:30PM and 7:30PM, Fri at 8:00PM, Sat at 1:30PM and 8:00PM and Sun at 1:30PM and 7:00PM. Tickets are on sale now starting at $34.

I have every reason to believe that this streak of success will continue unabated with My Very Own British Invasion.”said Gene R. Korf, Executive Director of The Blanche and Irving Laurie Foundation.\n\nDeborah Kennedy, Managing Director, J.P. Morgan Private Bank said, “At J.P. Morgan we see the arts as valuable expressions of creative ideas, that have a real and lasting benefit to society.
