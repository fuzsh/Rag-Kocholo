Welcome to The Drowsy Chaperone, a musical comedy swooping into town with tons of laughs! The story opens with a die-hard musical theater fan playing their favorite cast album, a 1928 smash hit called, yep, you guessed it - The Drowsy Chaperone. The production magically bursts to life, and we are instantly immersed in the glamorous, hilarious tale of a celebrity bride and her uproarious wedding day, complete with thrills and surprises that take both the cast (literally) and the audience (metaphorically) soaring into the rafters – surprises and good old-fashioned musical theater comedy around every corner!\n\nThe journey of THE DROWSY CHAPERONE began in 1997, when Don McKellar, Lisa Lambert, Greg Morrison, and a circle of friends put together a satirical take on vintage musicals to celebrate Bob Martin and Janet Van De Graaf’s pre-wedding festivities. After a 1998 world premiere at The Rivoli in Toronto, the show hit the Los Angeles stage in 2005 and opened on Broadway the following year, winning five Tony Awards and seven Drama Desk Awards. IMDB notes that a major motion picture version is categorized as in development with Playbill and Broadway Buzz pointing out that Tony Award winner Hugh Jackman, Academy Award winner Anne Hathaway, and film and music icon Barbara Streisand are interested in starring in the forthcoming film version. These latest rumors are just increasing our excitement about Broadway Training Center’s November production!\n\n“The Drowsy Chaperone extends a warm embrace to every show queen and misfit theatre geek who ever escaped … into the cocooning fantasy world of a musical.” – Variety‘s David Rooney\n\nWHEN: Fri.
