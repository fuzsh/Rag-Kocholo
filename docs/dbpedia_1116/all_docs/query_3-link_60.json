        "text": "Alan Bennett's The History Boys was named Best Play and The Drowsy Chaperone was awarded Best Musical when the New York Drama Critics' Circle announced their annual awards on May 11.\n\nTwo special citations were awarded by the New York Drama Critics' Circle: one to John Doyle, Sarah Travis and the company of the revival of Sweeney Todd and one to Christine Ebersole for her performance in the off-Broadway musical Grey Gardens. This is the first time in the organization's history that two special citations have been awarded.\n\nThe History Boys consists of an unruly bunch of bright, funny sixth-form boys in pursuit of sex, sport and a place at university, a maverick English teacher Richard Griffiths at odds with the young and shrewd supply teacher Stephen Campbell Moore. There is also a headmaster Clive Merrison obsessed with results, and a history teacher Frances de la Tour who thinks he's a fool. Staff room rivalry and the anarchy of adolescence provoke insistent questions about history and how to teach it. The show, a huge hit in the UK, opened a limited engagement at the Broadhurst Theatre on April 23, 2006."
