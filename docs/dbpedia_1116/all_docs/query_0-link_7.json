        "text": "The Drowsy Chaperone, a well-received sendup of 1920s musicals, and The History Boys, Alan Bennett's drama about English prep-school boys, were the big winners Sunday at the 51st annual Drama Desk awards in New York.\n\nChaperone and History Boys won a total of seven and five Drama Desks respectively, including the top awards of outstanding musical and outstanding play, solidifying their front-runner status going into next month's Tony Awards.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone, which originated as a small 1998 production in Toronto, has proven popular with both critics and audiences. It also won awards for its music, lyrics, book, sets, costumes and featured actress. Reuters"
