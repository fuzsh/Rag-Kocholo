Will the gangsters disguised as bakers force the producer to stop the wedding? Will the drowsy (actually drunken) chaperone do her job or will the Latin film star seduce the bride instead? Can an aviatrix save the day?\n\nSilly? Yes. Inspired? Yes. A 1928 musical? No.\n\nWritten by Canadians Bob Martin and Don McKellar (book), Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison (music and lyrics), The Drowsy Chaperone opened on Broadway in 2006, winning Tony and Drama Desk awards in nearly every category. A deliriously witty love letter to musical theatre, it gets special delivery treatment in Gillian Barber’s funny, energetic Theatre Under the Stars production, graced with talent galore.\n\nMan in Chair, played with sweet, nerdy congeniality by Shawn Macdonald, sets up each scene and relates the biographies of the fictional musical’s fictional performers as each one enters, sometimes through the door of a giant upstage fridge.\n\nHe advises us to ignore the lyrics of a song about a monkey on a pedestal and just enjoy the music. He quickly changes a record that generates a ludicrous racist scene in “an oriental palace.” Oops, wrong record. He quietly, elegantly dances with the dancers.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nAnd those dancers can dance. The groom (Stuart Barkley) and his best man (Blake Sartin) tap their brains out. With a cast of 28, choreographer Shelley Stewart Hunt has a large chorus of talented dancers to support them. Barkley dances through another number, Accident Waiting to Happen, blindfolded on roller skates. He’s a strong singer, too.\n\nThe gangsters (Kai Bradbury and Nicholas Bradbury) threaten the producer (Stefan Winfield) with impressive acrobatic choreography and a song that puns on baked goods. Silent film star and macho Latin lover Aldolpho (a scene-stealing, scenery-chewing Dimitrios Stephanoy) is consistently hilarious, all Dracula cape and attitude.\n\nAs in many of this summer’s shows, the women own centre stage. The wonderful Caitriona Murphy plays the diva-esque title character like an alcoholic Barbra Streisand. Murphy belts like Babs, too, in her anthemic number, As We Stumble Along.\n\nAnd Shannon Hanbury out-divas the diva as bride-to-be Broadway starlet Janet. Hanbury is simply sensational, a musical triple threat. In Janet’s feature number, Show Off, Hanbury sings, “I don’t wanna show off no more,” then does just that with big-time dance moves, ridiculously high kicks and splits, multiple costume changes (designer Chris Sinosich doing her usual magic) and an altogether killer performance.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nKudos to music director/conductor Kevin Michael Cripps, his 12-piece orchestra, and sound designer Brad Danyluk, whose clear mix lets us hear all the clever lyrics along with the fine music on the TUTS’ outdoor stage.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone plays in rep with Mary Poppins through mid-August, a quintessential Vancouver summer experience under the stars in Stanley Park.\n\nRecommended from Editorial\n\nTUTS's Barber cuts to the chase with The Drowsy Chaperone under the stars\n\nTheatre review: Bard's Two Gentlemen of Verona serves up great comic theatre\n\nTheatre review: Love, loneliness and vibrators star in Ensemble Theatre's In The Next Room\n\nThe Metro Vancouver theatre scene\n\nCLICK HERE to report a typo.\n\nIs there more to this story?
