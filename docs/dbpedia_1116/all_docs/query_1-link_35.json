        "text": "Shows will take place at Barnum Hall on March 3 and 4 at 7 p.m. and March 5 at 3 p.m., following three successful shows last week\n\nTickets are now available for Samohi Theatre’s production of The Drowsy Chaperone, a romantic tale set in the roaring 20s with a cast of zany characters that includes dancing gangsters, huge musical numbers, mistaken identity and vaudeville-style gags. The show will take place at Barnum Hall on March 3 and 4 at 7 p.m. and March 5 at 3 p.m., following three successful shows last week. Tickets can be purchased at samohitheatre.org.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone has been hailed as “the Perfect Broadway Musical” by New York Magazine and won five Tony Awards and seven Drama Desk Awards when it first played on Broadway in 2006. In this witty “Musical within a Comedy,” the audience is transported to another world as a die-hard musical fan plays his favorite cast album, a 1928 smash hit “The Drowsy Chaperone,” which magically comes to life.\n\n“This show was a HUGE hit on Broadway, and our amazing production features a full pit orchestra, incredible costumes, show stopping dance numbers, tons of laughs and over 100 Samohi students! Suitable for all ages, you don’t want to miss this fun show!” said Theatre Director, Kate Barazza.\n\nThe show features glamorous brides, tap-dancing groomsmen, and a madcap group of fellow characters alongside a chaperone who should probably drink some coffee. Theatre Director Kate Barazza says the production features over 100 Samohi students, a full pit orchestra, incredible costumes, show-stopping dance numbers and tons of laughs suitable for all ages.\n\nFor more information about the show, contact samohi.theatre.info@gmail.com or visit their EPK available online."
