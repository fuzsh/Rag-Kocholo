        "text": "Canadian export The Drowsy Chaperone was a big winner at the Drama Desk awards in New York Sunday, taking home seven of the coveted prizes.\n\nIt was chosen best musical of the New York theatre season by the panel of theatre journalists and critics, while The History Boys, by British writer Alan Bennett, was named best play.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone is a \"mocu-musical\" in which a man plays his favourite LP â the cast recording of a faux 1928 musical entitled The Drowsy Chaperone â as it comes to life for the audience.\n\n\"The Man in the Chair,\" the lead character played by Bob Martin, offers a running commentary, occasionally replaying a favourite bit or stopping the action to offer related trivia.\n\nMartin and Don McKellar took the award for best book for a musical and Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison won the awards for best music and best lyrics.\n\nBeth Leavel won for featured actress in a musical. David Gallo won for the sets and Gregg Barnes for costumes.\n\nThe production, which had been nominated for 14 Drama Desk awards,has also won a best musical award from the New York Drama Critics Circleand has been nominated for 13 Tony awards.\n\nMartin, who played the\"Man in the Chair\"role since the early Toronto production, lost out in best male lead in a musical category. That award went to John Lloyd Young for playing pop star Frankie Valli in Jersey Boys.\n\nChristine Ebersole won best female lead in a musical for her work as both a mother and daughter in Grey Gardens.\n\nIn addition to being chosen best play, The History Boys picked up a best actor award for Richard Griffiths; featured actor, Samuel Barnett; featured actress, Frances de la Tour; and best director, Nicholas Hytner.\n\nLois Smith received the top actress prize for her portrayal of a lonely woman who returns to her old home in The Trip to Bountiful. Playwright Horton Foote was given a lifetime achievement award."
