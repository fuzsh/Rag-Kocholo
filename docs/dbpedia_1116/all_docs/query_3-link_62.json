        "text": "Fun musical takes place in March; cast and volunteers are busy preparing\n\nThe James I. O’Neill High School Drama Club is thrilled to present The Drowsy Chaperone!\n\nThe musical is winner of five Tony awards, including best book (by Bob Martin and Don McKellar) and best original score (Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison). The delightful musical farce is a love-letter to Jazz Age musicals, O’Neill’s director Mara Davi said this week. Davi should know — she starred in the Broadway production of the musical alongside Bob Saget, Jo Anne Worley, and Cindy Williams.\n\nWhen a die-hard theatre fan plays his favorite record for the audience, the songs and characters come alive with song, dance, humor, and a little magic.\n\nShe calls the cast of 20 “magnificent actors”. They are: Megan Charlton (ensemble), Tyler Dehm (gangster #1), Madison Eby (gangster #2), Katie Elgan (ensemble/reporter #1), Patrick Flynn (George), Lucas Haley (underling), Ava Hurtado (Mrs. Tottendale), Miranda Kassa (Trix the Aviatrix), Abigail Kreh (Kitty), Kathryn Laird (superintendent/ensemble), Ava Lopez (Janet Van De Graaff), Greg Luzzatto (Man in Chair), Julia Olivia (ensemble), Tim Podias (Feldzeig), Grace Quander (ensemble/reporter #2), Sadie Scott (ensemble), Jeremy Stoll (Aldolpho), Eleanor Sullivan (Drowsy Chaperone), Daniel Wilson (Robert Martin) and Elizabeth Visger (ensemble).\n\nIn addition to Davi leading the students, music director Richard Schacher will lead a professional 13-piece orchestra to play this award winning score.​​\n\n“Also integral to the production are choreographer Ellissa Eby, production supervisor Aaron Gaines, club advisor Joanne Roffman, and incredible parent volunteers,” Davi said.\n\nMostly, she praises O’Neill’s students:\n\n“The students of the Drama Club have been involved in every aspect of production, building and painting the set and props, advertising, fundraising, and playbill design; and they are looking forward to sharing what they’ve been working on with their community,” she said.\n\nThe show will play in the O’Neill High School auditorium on Friday, March 10 at 7 p.m.; Saturday March 11 at 3 and 7 p.m.; and Sunday, March 12 at 3 p.m."
