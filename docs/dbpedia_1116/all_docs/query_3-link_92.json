        "text": "Before it was an award winning Broadway musical, The Drowsy Chaperone was first performed at a stag party. Toronto theatre mainstays Don McKellar, Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison initially developed the script in 1998 as a wedding gift for their friends Janet Van De Graff and Bob Martin—something still reflected in the names of the soon-to-be-betrothed couple in the musical-within-the-play.\n\nMartin enjoyed the performance—initially at notorious Toronto bar The Rivoli, for his stag—so much, he joined the trio as a writer. They tightened up the script for a run at the subsequent Toronto Fringe, where it won rave reviews and garnered intense audience interest. After the success of the Fringe production, Toronto über-producer, David Mirvish, booked it for a run at the Theatre Passe Muraille, where it garnered further acclaim.\n\nThe success of the ’99 run encouraged Mirvish to find an even bigger venue, and so The Drowsy Chaperone opened at Toronto’s Winter Garden Theatre. Besides holding 1000 people, more than 10 times the size of any place Chaperone had played previous, the Winter Garden also used to play host to ’20s vaudeville productions not terribly unlike the musical.\n\nThe show opened on Broadway on May 1, 2006 with Bob Martin himself in the role of the Man in the Chair. The show was nominated for 14 New York Drama Desk Awards four days before it even opened. It ran for 674 performances, closing on December 30, 2007 after earning two Tonys, for score and book, and four Drama Desk Awards, including outstanding musical, score, book and music.\n\nBob Martin has been working as an actor and writer in Canadian theatre, film and television for over 3 decades. He has had a long association with the Toronto Second City, where he co-wrote and performed in four Second City revues, directed three, and had a stint as Artistic Director.\n\nHe is a co-creator of The Drowsy Chaperone, and has performed in many of its incarnations including Ahmanson Theatre (Los Angeles), Marquis Theatre (Broadway), Novello (London).\n\nBob has won a number of awards for his work including an LA Drama Critics Circle Award, an L.A. Stage Alliance Ovation Award, a Drama Desk Award, a Theatre World Award, and a Tony Award. He is also co-creator of the critically acclaimed dramatic series Slings & Arrows. Recent TV projects include Michael: Tuesdays and Thursdays I & II (CBC), Sensitive Skin I & II (HBO), and Elf: Buddy’s Musical Christmas (NBC).\n\nRecent theatre projects include Elf (Broadway), and Minsky’s (Ahmanson LA).\n\nDon McKellar was born on 17th August 1963 in Toronto, Canada. Beginning his career in the theatre at a young age McKellar co-founded Childs Play Theatre, and went on to study English and theatre at the University of Toronto. In 1989, he co-founded the Augusta Company with Daniel Brooks and Tracy Wright. He then began writing feature films including the screenplay for Bruce McDonald’s film Roadkill (1989).\n\nMcKellar has produced engaging and provocative work in film, TV, and theatre. He made his directorial debut in 1992 with two short films, Blue (starring David Cronenberg) and Bloody Nose. In 1998, he completed his first feature film, Last Night, which he directed, wrote, and starred in, for which he won the Prix de la Jeunesse at the Cannes Film Festival.\n\nMcKellar is particularly memorable for his acting roles as Curtis in 2 seasons of Twitch City, voicing the character Jack in 5 seasons of Odd Job Jack and as pretentious theatre director Darren Nicholls in Slings and Arrows.\n\nAlong with co-writer Bob Martin, McKellar won the 2006 Tony Award for Best Book for a Musical for The Drowsy Chaperone.\n\nGreg Morrison (born 1965) is a Canadian writer and composer best known for his work on the music and lyrics of The Drowsy Chaperone, which he wrote with Lisa Lambert.\n\nHis credits as a composer and lyricist for both theatre and film include Hello…Hello (Tarragon Theatre), Mump and Smoot in Something Else (Canadian Stage, Yale Repertory Theatre), American film Treading Water, and Canadian television series Slings and Arrows.\n\nHe also has extensive credits for directing and musical directing shows across the United States and Canada.\n\nHe is a recipient of a Canadian Comedy Award and a Sterling Award for Original Composition.\n\nJacques Lemay has directed and choreographed hundreds of theatre and opera productions across Canada, as well as film and television. He is a former Artistic Director of the Charlottetown Festival and founding Director of the Jazz Dance department for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet. He gained renown as a choreographer for the RWB and other international companies.\n\nHe was Artistic Director and Senior Choreographer of the Calgary Olympics Opening Ceremonies; Producer/Artistic Director of the 1994 Victoria Commonwealth Games, Special Olympics World Winter Games, Canada Summer and Winter Games, Opening Ceremonies of Confederation Bridge; Creative Advisor for the Vancouver Olympics Opening and Closing Ceremonies; and Artistic Director of six Royal visits. He has been retained by the Canada Council for the Arts and provincial and territorial arts councils.\n\nLemay also co-founded the Canadian College of Performing Arts. Recently, his work was seen in Simon Boccanegra, his sixteenth production with Pacific Opera Victoria."
