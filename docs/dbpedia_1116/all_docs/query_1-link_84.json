        "text": "“Deadwood Dick,” an old-fashioned Western melodrama, and “The Drowsy Chaperone,” a send-up of 1920s stage musicals, are two of the five plays in this summer’s Redlands Theatre Festival repertory season.\n\n“Deadwood Dick” continues Aug. 4, 7, 12 and 18, and “The Drowsy Chaperone” continues Aug. 5, 11 and 20.\n\n‘DEADWOOD DICK’\n\nHeroes, villains and damsels in distress are just some of the colorful characters in “Deadwood Dick” or “The Game of Gold.”\n\nBased on the works of 19th-century dime novelist Edward L. Wheeler, the play centers around the villain Black’n Red versus the heroes Ned Harris and Wild Bill Hickock, who team up to block the villain’s evil plans and save the day during the Gold Rush days in Deadwood Gulch.\n\nAdd a Robin Hood-type hero named Deadwood Dick, Calamity Jane, a kidnapped wealthy heiress, a lost gold mine and a little gunplay, and the audience will soon be booing the bad guys, cheering the heroes, and oohing and ahhing the damsels.\n\n“‘Deadwood Dick’ is a rollicking, traditional melodrama of the Old West,” said director Shannon Galuszka. “We’ve come up with a family comedy using old models like silent movies and Dudley Do-Right stories with your typical heroines, villains and, of course, the good guys.”\n\n‘THE DROWSY CHAPERONE’\n\n“‘The Drowsy Chaperone’ is a loving send-up of the Jazz Age musical, featuring one show-stopping song and dance number after another,” said director Lisa Lyons of Riverside. “The RTF cast is amazing. You’ll laugh until you cry, and then you’ll laugh again.”\n\nThe show opens when a man in a chair appears on stage and puts on his favorite record, the cast recording of a fictitious musical, Lyons said, and then the recording then comes to life around him.\n\nWith music and lyrics by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison, and book by Bob Martin and Dob McKellar, “The Drowsy Chaperone” debuted in 1998 in Toronto and opened on Broadway in May 2006.\n\nThe play was nominated for multiple Broadway and London theater awards, winning five Tony Awards and seven Drama Desk Awards. There have been major productions of the play in Toronto, Los Angeles, New York and London and in Japan, and there have been two North American tours.\n\nABOUT THE FESTIVAL\n\nOther plays in Redlands Theatre Festival’s summer repertory season are “The Belle of Amherst,” continuing Aug. 9 and 17; “Peter and the Starcatcher,” Aug. 3, 6, 13 and 19; and “Leaving Iowa,” Aug. 10 and 16.\n\nAll performances are at 8:30 p.m. in Avice Meeker Sewall Theater in Prospect Park at Cajon Street and Highland Avenue in Redlands.\n\nSingle tickets are available for $16 for performances Tuesday and Wednesday and $21 for Thursday through Sunday shows. Group tickets also are available at a discounted rate.\n\nTickets are available at the Redlands Theatre Festival box office in Prospect Park or by calling 909-792-0562. The box office is open 5 to 9 p.m. every show night through Aug. 20.\n\nTicket information also is available at www.rftseason.com.\n\nNo children younger than 5 will be admitted.\n\nTheatergoers may park on Cajon Street and take the free tram ride to and from the theater, beginning at 6:30 p.m. on show nights. The tram also is available after performances. Picnicking is allowed on the festival grounds before each show. A refreshment stand is open before each show and at intermission.\n\nSource: Redlands Theatre Festival"
