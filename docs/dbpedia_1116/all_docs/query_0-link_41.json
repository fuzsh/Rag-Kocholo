        "text": "(New York, November 30, 2007) The League of American Theatres and Producers presented Broadway’s Back! this afternoon, a free public concert featuring Tony Award®-winners Angela Lansbury, Bernadette Peters, and Bob Martin. Mr. Martin (creator of The Drowsy Chaperone) served as the host of the event, which included cast members from dozens of Broadway shows on stage performing together, to celebrate the return of Broadway and the holiday season.\n\nBroadway's Back! featured Angela Lansbury performing “We Need a Little Christmas” from Mame, the title role she created on Broadway. Lansbury was most recently seen on Broadway in Terrence McNally's Deuce, for which she received a Tony nomination as Best Actress in a Play. Bernadette Peters, who last appeared on Broadway in the acclaimed revival of Gypsy (2003 Tony Award nomination for her performance as Mama Rose), sang the Irving Berlin classic “There’s No Business Like Show Business” from Annie Get Your Gun – however, as a special twist, the lyrics were adapted to fit the occasion.\n\nThe concert took place on stage at the Marquis Theatre, home of the musical The Drowsy Chaperone (winner of 5 Tony Awards in 2006). Seth Rudetsky, who is currently appearing on Broadway in the revival of Terrence McNally’s The Ritz, led a full orchestra.\n\nAppearing in the event’s All Star Chorus were Broadway cast members Howie Michael Smith and Jen Barnhart (Avenue Q); Michelle DeJean and Solange Sandy (Chicago); Paul McGill and Deirde Goodwin (A Chorus Line); John Bolton (Curtains); Bob Saget and Beth Leavel (The Drowsy Chaperone); Max Crumm and Laura Osnes (Grease!); Bill Ryall (Dr. Seuss’ The Grinch Who Stole Christmas: The Musical); Shannon Durig and Gerorge Wendt (Hairspray); Michael Longoria, Collin Donnell, Dominic Nolfi, Johne Leone (Jersey Boys); Laura Bell Bundy (Legally Blonde the Musical); Max Von Esson (Les Misérables); Carolee Carmello (Mamma Mia!); Jim Romick (The Phantom of the Opera); Tamyra Gray and Justin Johnston (Rent); Seth Fisher (Rock ‘n’ Roll); Rick Holmes (Monty Python’s Spamalot); Jarred Gertne and Sara Inbar (The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee); Lea Michelle and Jonathan Groff (Spring Awakening); Stephanie Block and Annaliegh Ashford (Wicked); Kerry Butler and Cheyenne Jackson (Xanadu); and Frankenstein (The New Mel Brooks Musical Young Frankenstein).\n\nAbout the concert and the return of Broadway, host Bob Martin said, “It’s a prayer answered. Forget the windup LED flashlight and the “Sex and the City” box set – this is the best Christmas present a single, middle-aged, man - living alone in New York City, could ask for! Broadway’s long, dark night is over!”\n\nBob Martin won Tony and Drama Desk Awards for Best Book of a Musical for The Drowsy Chaperone, the musical in which he also starred as Man in Chair. His Canadian stage credits include An Awkward Evening with Martin and Johnson, The Good Life, Alumni Café, Skippy's Rangers and Old Wine, New Bottles. His film credits include \"Childstar,\" \"Last Night,\" \"Torso\" and \"Clubland.\" Martin was also the writer and creative producer for the television series \"Slings & Arrows.\"\n\nThe concert was produced by Jeffrey Seller and Matthew Rego on behalf of The League of American Theatres and Producers and General Managers were Richards/Climan, Inc."
