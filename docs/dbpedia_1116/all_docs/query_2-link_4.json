        "text": "The Drowsy Chaperone tickets are a chance to see a musical that was most likely never intended to be the hit that it has become. The play was put together for non-commercial purposes, and is the result of a deep friendship shared by many parties involved. A look at the production history will explain the story behind the musical.\n\nReasons for Production\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone was originally put together in Canada, and the motivation behind it is the stuff of legend in Broadway and theater circles. The musical was made as a bachelor party present to Canadian comedian Bob Martin and his wife-to-be, Janet Van De Graaff, in 1998. It was performed at the Rivoli Theatre in Toronto, and the performance was such a resounding success that those involved decided to do something with such a fortuitous masterpiece.\n\nMartin and his friends decided to add to the production and release it at the Toronto Fringe Festival in 1999. A narrator role was added for Martin, and the play enjoyed the same success as it had in its original private run. Given the overwhelmingly positive response, the team decided to put even more financial backing into the production, which turned out to be a good decision, as the play did very well in Toronto over the next couple of years.\n\nSuccess Beyond Canada\n\nThe show continued to gather a sterling reputation, and ultimately it was decided that the play needed to push towards the ultimate destination for any theatre production - Broadway. Before that could happen, however, the producers offered The Drowsy Chaperone tickets to thespians in Los Angeles in 2005, and once again, the play did very well and garnered positive reviews from audiences and critics.\n\nUltimately, the show was ready for the “big stage,” and opened on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre in May of 2006. The play was the first Canadian production to reach Broadway in 25 years, and has become a national treasure north of the border.\n\nIn terms of awards, The Drowsy Chaperone won five Drama Critics Circle Awards, seven Drama Desk Awards and five Tony Awards, and the commercial success of the production has been outstanding in every respect.\n\nThe Story\n\nThe play itself is a running homage to American musicals in the 1920's and every cultural aspect that was prevalent at the time is featured. The Roaring ‘20's were indeed a unique time in American history, and the play adds humor and intrigue to these cultural and historical phenomena through the perspective of musicals that were produced at the time.\n\nIf you want to see an “accidental” classic for a night of laughter, The Drowsy Chaperone tickets are a great option."
