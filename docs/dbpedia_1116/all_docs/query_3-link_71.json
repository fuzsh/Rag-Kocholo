        "text": "NORTH SEWICKLEY TWP. -- An award-winning, yet seldom-recognized, musical set in the 1920s, \"The Drowsy Chaperone,\" has Riverside students on stage for the 54th year.\n\n\"I wanted the community to see our students do something challenging when it comes to comedy and dance,” said producer Vaughn Hudspath.\n\nThe Riverside School District presents the musical comedy \"The Drowsy Chaperone\" in four performances Thursday through Sunday at Riverside High School.\n\nDirector Andrew Koval has put together a cast of more than 75 students from the high school and middle school to present what has been described as a \"musical within a comedy.\"\n\nHudspath said performances of the musical that won five Tony Awards in 2006, including Best Book and Best Original Score, are not to be missed.\n\n“‘The Drowsy Chaperone’ is a loving look at the jazz-age musicals and features one show-stopping song and dance number after another,\" Hudspath said. \"It is seldom seen in our area.\"\n\nSet in the 1920s, the musical begins with a person playing their favorite record from a musical, so the audience, too, is listening when the recording comes to life. The fantasy revolves around the person in the chair, who frequently interrupts the songs and dances with comments about the musical performances. It creates an atmosphere of suspended reality filled with laughs.\n\nThe show includes two lovers on the eve of their wedding, a bumbling best man, a desperate theater producer, a not-so-bright hostess, two gangsters posing as pastry chefs and a misguided Don Juan, who all create a hilarious parody.\n\n\"I selected this show because our last several shows were very much in the mainstream and very popular shows like ‘Seussical’ and ‘The Wizard of Oz,'\" Hudspath said.\n\nRiverside junior Alivia Leyland is excited be playing Kitty, who she describes as a dumb-blonde showgirl-type.\n\n“It is so much fun to playing a role so different from my usual roles and to be playing a character that I'm not. I just love Kitty and I use a character voice in the production that is annoyingly nasal,\" Leyland said.\n\nWhen \"The Drowsy Chaperone\" was introduced in May 2016, Leyland had never heard of it, but went straight to YouTube to learn about more about the show.\n\n\"When I saw it took place in the 1920s, I was excited. That is my favorite era. I love the songs and dances of that time,\" Leyland said.\n\nLeyland, 17, who lives in Franklin Township, has participated in Riverside's musical theater since she was in eighth grade. She studies at Siri's School of Performing Arts in Harmony and plans to continue to perform.\n\n\"I just feel like God has blessed me with the talent to do this. I love to perform. The energy and the adrenaline rush I feel when I am on stage is wonderful,\" Leyland said. \"Performing is a passion of mine. I plan to make it a career.\""
