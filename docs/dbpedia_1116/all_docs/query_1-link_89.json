        "text": "Ten performances only, at the Arthur Newman Theatre beginning March 9, 2017.\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone was called “the perfect musical” by New York magazine. It begins as a die-hard theatre fan puts the cast album of his favorite stage musical on his record player to chase his blues away. Suddenly, his dingy apartment’s magically transformed into a 1928 Broadway set and he finds himself in the center of a “musical within a comedy,” mixed up in mayhem with a starlet, her groom, a desperate producer, gangsters, a drunken chaperone and more. Featuring such songs as “Fancy Dress,” “As We Stumble Along” and “Show Off,” the original Broadway run of The Drowsy Chaperone won Tony Awards for Best Book of a Musical and Best Original Score. You simply can’t miss this crowd-pleasing musical treat!\n\nLance Phillips-Martinez directs the talents of: Timm McBride (Man in Chair), Coco Girelli (Janet Van De Graff), Ryan Holmes (Robert), Karen Ellison Schmitt (Chaperone), Allan H Jensen (Aldopho), Angus Feath (George), Arnie Kleban (Feldzeig), Adina Lawson (Kitty), Marjory Edson Lewis (Tottendale), Steven Ciceron (Underling), Mark Demry (Gangster #1), Ed Lefkowitz (Gangster #2), Denise Carter & Keisha D Sings (alternating as Trix), Heidi Hapner (Ensemble/Dance Captain), Daniela Ryan (Ensemble) and Alex Updike (Ensemble).\n\nThe production team includes: Heidi Hapner (Choreographer), Donald Kelley (Musical Director), Jenny Ferguson (Stage Manager), Ron Phillips-Martinez (Sets), Phil Murphy (Lights), Janelle Kauffman (Props/ASM), Claudia Brigitte Gomez (Props/Production Assistant).\n\n“We are very honored to present this fantastic musical to the Coachella Valley another Neil Simon comedy treasure.” says Artistic Director/Director Lance Phillips-Martinez, “This five-time Tony award winning musical aims to please and have something for everyone. It is hysterically funny and the music is beautifully crafted. You simply cannot miss this show!”\n\nThe Drowsy Chaperone is a musical with book by Bob Martin and Don McKellar and music and lyrics by Lisa Lambert and Greg Morrison. It is a parody of American musical comedy of the 1920s. The story concerns a middle-aged, asocial musical theatre fan; as he plays the record of his favorite musical, the (fictional) 1928 hit The Drowsy Chaperone, the show comes to life onstage as he wryly comments on the music, story, and actors. The Drowsy Chaperone opened on Broadway on 1 May 2006 The show was nominated for multiple Broadway (2006) and London (2008) theatre awards, winning five Tony Awards and seven Drama Desk Awards.\n\nThe Arthur Newman Theatre is located at 73-750 Catalina Way, Palm Desert CA, 92260.\n\nShow Times: Thursday, Friday and Saturday at 7pm, with Saturday and Sunday matinees at 2pm."
