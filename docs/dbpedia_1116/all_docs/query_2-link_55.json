        "text": "Without knowing too much, it’s easy to know that [TITLE OF SHOW] is a musical written for “theater-people” by “theater-people.” But that doesn’t mean that even the most in-the-know theater person is going to catch every. single. reference in [TITLE OF SHOW], because let’s face it—it’s a lot.\n\nBut since [TITLE OF SHOW] is a great musical for anyone who has every had a dream, and worked hard to achieve said dream, we put together a guide to some of the more obscure references that are sprinkled like glitter throughout this show. And just like glitter, this sh*t is everywhere. And like glitter, it’s more fun if you know what’s coming. So, buckle up and check out some of the crazy references made throughout the script of [TITLE OF SHOW]\n\nMary Stout: A seasoned Broadway actor who is best known for playing “character roles” both in Broadway productions as well as in television and movies. She was famously–albeit unfortunately–hit by a hot dog cart in the city. Rumor is she still gets free hotdogs on 46th\n\nHenry, Sweet, Henry: Based on the 1964 novel The World of Henry Orient by Nora Johnson and the subsequent film of the same name, the plot focuses on Valerie and Marian, two wealthy, love-struck teenagers who stalk an avant-garde composer and aging philanderer. It closed in 1967 after just 80 performances on Broadway\n\nWonderful Town: A 1953 musical that tells the story of two sisters who aspire to be a writer and actress respectively, seeking success from their basement apartment in New York City's Greenwich Village. The music was written by Leonard Bernstien, but never found success anywhere near his West Side Story or Candide.\n\n“The Festival” : A nod to the very repetitive line from Stephen Sondheim’s Into the Woods. “The King is throwing a festival.”\n\nShogun, the Musical: Based on James Clavell’s 1976 novel, Shogun: The Musical took eight years to get off the ground. When the production finally opened at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC, it closely resembled Les Misérables and The Phantom of the Opera in size and scope, with a cast of thirty-eight characters, more than three hundred costumes, a libretto nearly entirely sung, and a running time of 3½ hours. After a much needed revamp, it finally went into previews before opening on November 20, 1990. During a press preview, the leading man was struck by a set piece in the second act, causing the show to end abruptly and certainly not helping reviews. Luckily, the actor was alright and able to return to the show shortly thereafter. Unluckily, this mammoth of a show closed after only 72 performances.\n\nRuthless: The Musical: Ruthless! The Musical is an all-female musical that spoofs Broadway musicals, like Gypsy and Mame, and movies such as The Bad Seed and All About Eve. This musical never made it to Broadway, but during its 1992 off-Broadway run, the central role of Tina was understudied by Natalie Portman and Britney Spears.\n\nDinah Manoff: An American stage, film, and television actress and television director. She is best known for her role as Marty Maraschino in the movie-musical adaptation of Grease.\n\nLeader of the Pack: A 1984 American jukebox musical based on the life and music of singer/songwriter Ellie Greenwich or wrote or co-wrote such hits as \"Be My Baby\", \"Then He Kissed Me\", \"Do Wah Diddy Diddy\", \"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\", \"Leader of the Pack\", and \"River Deep – Mountain High.”\n\nTommy: The Who’s Tommy is a rock musical based on the 1969 rock opera by the same name. The show ran on Broadway from 1993–95.\n\nJohn Cameron Mitchell: A Broadway actor who is most well known for writing the musical Hedwig and the Angry Inch\n\nMichael Crawford: A Broadway actor best known for originating the role of the Phantom in The Phantom of the Opera.\n\nJim Dale: In the United States, Jim Dale is most recognised as a leading actor on Broadway in the 80’s where his career earned him five Tony Award Nominees, as well as for narrating all seven of the Harry Potter audiobooks in the American market\n\nBarnums: Step aside The Greatest Showman, Barnum is the original Broadway musical about P.T. Barnum. The show ran for just a little over two years on Broadway from 1980–1982.\n\nMazeppa: A reference to the stripper Mazeppa from the musical Gyspy whose gimmick is famously how she can “bump it with a trumpet”\n\nKwamina: In Kwamina, the son of an African tribal chief returns home after attending medical school in London and finds his modern methods conflict with his village's traditions. He also butts heads with the village's white female doctor, but he ultimately falls in love with her. The problematic show ran for only 32 Broadway performances.\n\nStarlight Express: What do you get when Andrew Lloyd Webber combines an animated TV series based on Thomas the Tank Engine, a novelty pop single, and an animated film based on Cinderella? Starlight Express. This show tells the story of a young but obsolete steam engine, Rusty, who races in a championship against modern engines in the hope of impressing a first-class carriage, Pearl. Oh, and it’s all famously done on roller skates… However, the weird premise of the show didn’t detract from its success. It holds the title as the ninth-longest running theatrical production on the West End and is also the most successful musical in Germany, where it has been performed in a purpose-built theater since 1988. You can learn more about that here: All aboard for Bochum: the German town where Starlight Express has run nonstop since the 80s\n\nChess: This musical combines the music writing talents of two ABBA members with the lyricist writing talen of Tim Rice to give you a musical about a politically driven, Cold War–era chess tournament between two grandmasters, one American and the other Soviet Russian, and their fight over a woman who manages one and falls in love with the other. It premiered on Broadway in 1988 and survived for only two months,\n\nJukebox Musical: A musical that takes the song from one artist and group and weaves a story around the songs. Famous examples include Mamma Mia, American Idiot, and All Shook Up!\n\nAlice Ripley: A Broadway actor who is best known for her Tony-award winning performance as Diana in Next to Normal\n\nI Love My Wife: A satire of the sexual revolution of the 1970s, the musical takes place on Christmas Eve in suburban Trenton, New Jersey, where two married couples who have been close friends since high school find themselves contemplating a ménage-à-quatre. Surprisingly, this show ran over 850 times over a span of two years in the late 70’s.\n\nRomance/Romance: This show is composed of two acts linked only by the common theme of love and one song performed in both acts. The first, The Little Comedy, is based on a short story and explores the budding relationship between two people who have adopted personas other than their own in late 19th century Vienna. Summer Share, the second act based on Jules Renard's 1898 play Le pain de ménage, is updated to the late 1980s and set in The Hamptons, where two married couples find themselves gradually progressing from harmless flirtation to the serious possibility of an illicit affair. Oddly enough, this show starred Barry William of Brady Bunch fame.\n\nThe Golden Apple: The Golden Apple is a musical adaptation of parts of Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey. The musical transferred to Broadway on April 20, 1954, to the Alvin Theater where it played for only 125 performances despite rave reviews.\n\nMerrily We Roll Along: This 1981 musical was written by the great Stephen Sondheim but name recognition wasn’t enough to make it a hit. After only 16 Broadway performances and merciless reviews, this show closed prematurely.\n\nGot Tu Go Disco: A woman who sells disco clothes in a store hates disco music, until her boyfriend convinces her to go to the local dance club, where she becomes its queen. After many delays the show ran for nine previews and eight regular performances, not even long enough for it to face the wrath of the “Disco Sucks” movement.\n\nBagels and Yox: This Yiddish-flavored music, comedy and dance revue ran for more performances than the Broadway revival of \"Oklahoma!\" the same year. However as a Times Revue put it, “Bagels and Yox maintains an even level of noisy mediocrity” making its 208 show run impressive.\n\nA Change in the Heir: Two branches of the same royal family bring up their children as the opposite sex in hopes of gaining the crown. Mistaken identity and romance result in this musical farce. Considered a big Broadway “flop” after surviving only 23 performances.\n\nCensored Scenes from King Kong: Yes, this is a real show. And yes, it may win the shortest run on this list. This musical comedy imagines that scenes cut from the film \"King Kong\" actually contained information for secret agents, but only ran for a total of FIVE Broadway performances before closing. Fun fact: Carrie Fisher (of Star Wars Fame) played the lead.\n\nOBIE Award: The Obie Awards or Off-Broadway Theater Awards are annual awards originally given by The Village Voice newspaper to theater artists and groups in New York City. In September 2014, the awards were jointly presented and administered with the American Theatre Wing. As the Tony Awards cover Broadway productions, the OBIE Awards cover off-Broadway and off-off-Broadway productions.\n\n“Shields and Yarnel”: Shields and Yarnell were an American mime team, formed in 1972, consisting of Robert Shields and Lorene Yarnell.\n\nThe Naked Cowboy: Robert John Burck, better known as the Naked Cowboy, is an American street performer who is best known for singing regularly in New York City's Times Square wearing only cowboy boots, a hat, and white briefs, with a guitar strategically placed to give the illusion of nudity. In 2010, he announced he would be running for president in the 2012 election as a member of the Tea Party Movement.\n\nMamie Duncan Gibbs: A Broadway star who has worked with many Broadway stars and has credits that include “Kiss Me, Kate,” “Chicago” and “Cats.” In a 2008 interview with the New York Times, Jeff Bowen says, “That one is kind of intentionally obscure. In the scene, these guys are flying over New York, and they see the Naked Cowboy, Red Lobster, everything that everyone knows. Then Hunter gets excited because he sees Mamie Duncan-Gibbs, and Jeff calls him out on it”\n\nShakespeare: The one and only William Shakespeare who’s work created in early Elizabethan England is still performed to this day all over the globe. He was the author of Romeo & Juliet, Hamlet, A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and many, many more.\n\nSondheim: Stephen Sondheim was an American composer and lyricist. Among the most important figures in 20th-century musical theater, Sondheim was praised for having \"reinvented the American musical\" with shows like Company, Into the Woods, Sunday in the Park with George, Sweeney Todd, and A Little Night Music. Sondheim sadly passed away right before Thanksgiving in 2021.\n\nSedaris: An American humorist, comedian, author, and radio contributor. Much of Sedaris's humor is autobiographical and self-deprecating and often concerns his family life, his middle-class upbringing in the suburbs of Raleigh, North Carolina, his Greek heritage, being gay, his jobs, education, and much more. He is most well known for writing Me Talk Pretty One Day about his time living in France with his husband.\n\nLily Tomlin: An American actress, comedian, and writer who is best known for her roles in Laugh-In, the hit Netflix series Frankie & Grace, and as the voice-actor of Miss Frizzle in The Magic School Bus. She is a Tony award winning actor and a Broadway veteran. In 2014, she was given Kennedy Center Honors and in 2017 she received the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award.\n\nChristopher Guest: An American-British screenwriter, composer, musician, director, actor, and comedian best known for his short mockumentary comedic films like Best in Show and Waiting for Guffman.

The show has tackles often “taboo” subjects such as racism, homosexuality, and internet pornography. This show was also developed at the Vineyard Theatre before it went on to Broadway. Fun fact: the same guy who wrote the music to this show also wrote the music for Frozen.\n\nThe Post, Time Out, Variety: All New York newspapers and publications that have a big sway in what “makes it or breaks it” on Broadway.\n\n“The Gray Lady”: For much of its existence, the New York Times was known as “The Gray Lady,” both for its tradition of only printing in black and white and for its careful, deliberative approach to journalism.\n\nBernadette Peters: An American actress, singer, and children's book author.

Get your tickets to [TITLE OF SHOW] playing from January 14–February 6 and see how many references you can pick-up on. And don’t forget to impress your friends with your vast new-found knowledge from Aspects of Love to Starlight Express. Both by Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber, btw.\n\nIn the spring of 2004, two “nobodies” in New York decided to enter a new work into the inaugural New York Musical Theater Festival. With a deadline only three weeks aways, the two nobodies, Jeff Bowen and Hunter Bell, set off to write an original musical. However, Bowen and Bell quickly realized that the conversations they were having about writing an original musical were far more interesting than the actual content they were creating. Thus was born the idea of “a musical about two guys writing a musical about two guys wiring a musical” and [TITLE OF SHOW] slowly began to take form.\n\nOne of the most fascinating things about [TITLE OF SHOW] is that the four characters in the the musical are not just characters with made-up names and backstories, they are actual New York-based actors who played themselves on stage for the entirety of this production. The four characters in the show are Jeff, Hunter, Heidi and Susan, roles that were originated by Jeff Bowen, Hunter Bell, Heidi Blickenstaff, and Susan Blackwell, respectively.\n\nJeff Bowen and Hunter Bell originally met in 1995, but their apparent chemistry wasn’t immediate. “We laugh about it now, but the first time I met Hunter, I didn’t really like him,” Bowen said in a 2011 Dramatic interview with Alisha McKinney, \"He came in, and he knew all his lines and had all of his singing done on the first day. So I completely judged him, like: ‘Who is this complete goody-goody?’ And then I found out that he had just done the show a month before,” Bowen chuckled. “But we became pretty good friends right away.”\n\nThe two would go on to not only be good friends, but have their friendship immortalized through musical theater. Amazingly, the show that started as a writing exercise was submitted to the judges for the 2004 New York Theater Festival, and—to their surprise—was not only accepted for the festival, but was offered a six-night run at the Belt Theatre. The performance space, aptly named as it was a former belt factory, was so awkward that many shows in the festival refused to perform there. But that didn’t stop their enthusiasm, and that enthusiasm paid off.“It was a Tuesday afternoon performance, and there were 12 people in the audience, and it was like raining outside, and all these other shows were hits, and we were in the [Belt Theatre] doing our little show and we were like: ‘Let’s rock this.’ And sure enough The New York Times was there and put a little blurb about it, and that helped get a little attention,” recalled Bell.\n\nThe show did indeed catch the eye of Broadway producer, Kevin McCollum, who helped the foursome workshop, revise and expand the show. Two years later, [TITLE OF SHOW] made its way to “off-broadway,” landing a slot in the Vineyard Theatre’s regular season line-up. This led to an extension of the production and eventually to its Broadway debut on July 17, 2008. From the Festival to Off-Broadway to Broadway, the four cast members stayed the same with Bowen, Bell, Blackwell and Blickenstaff all playing themselves each night on stage.\n\n[TITLE OF SHOW] has gone on to come a cult favorite of not only self-described “theater nerds” or “musical theatre kids,” but for anyone who has ever had a dream and decided to see where it leads. For the four dreamers of this show, [TITLE OF SHOW] became just one of many accomplishments in their still-growing careers.\n\nFor Jeff Bowen, he has continued to make a name for himself as a lyricist and composer, creating original compositions for The Actors’ Fund, the Drama Desk Awards, TV-shows, another off-Broadway production entitled NOW. HERE. THIS., and even Disney.

For theatre artists, the homecoming has been ten-fold. We’ve celebrated the return of theatre; now, it’s time to celebrate the people who make it happen.” says director, Jake Sung-Guk Sullivan. “[TITLE OF SHOW] is a love letter to musicals, sure, but more importantly, it’s a bittersweet, hilarious, and strikingly honest ode to what it means to be someone working in theatre: to all the anxieties and stresses and existential crises one constantly faces, and most importantly, to the reasons we as humans are drawn to create theatre, in the face of whatever life throws at us.” Sung-Guk Sullivan is making his directorial debut at Lyric Arts after performing as Juan Perón in EVITA and as Clown 1 in the ’21–’22 production of THE 39 STEPS. However, Sung-Guk Sullivan is not new to directing. Serving as the high school director for Anoka High School, Sung-Guk Sullivan has been with the public school for six years and has directed many performances with them.\n\n[TITLE OF SHOW] features four performers, most of whom are brand new to the Lyric Arts family. Making their Lyric Arts debut are Bradley Johnson as Jeff, Lux Mortenson as Susan, and Alice McGlave as Heidi. Returning after his debut in NEW VOICES CABARET this past May is Brendan Nelson Finn, who rounds out the cast as Hunter. This cast also includes Bradley Beahen who serves as Music Director in addition to Larry, the piano player who is on stage the entire time with the cast interacting with the actors and participating in the show.\n\nIn addition to Jake Sung-Guk Sullivan and Bradley Beahen, Artistic Staff also includes choreography by Nickie Kromminga Hill, stage management by Ellen DeYoung, scenic design by Cory Skold, property design by Kat Walker, costume design by Samantha Fromm Haddow, lighting design by Jim Eischen, sound design by Julie Zumsteg with assistance from Paul Etsby, and intimacy direction by Callie Aho.\n\n[TITLE OF SHOW] is based on true events and tells the story of Jeff and Hunter, two self-described nobodies who decide to enter into a New Works Festival in New York City. With their friends, Heidi and Susan, the group set out write an original musical—with a deadline just three weeks away. As the friends discover that their conversations about writing a musical is far more interesting than what they were trying to write about, the musical they are attempting create soon morphs into \"a musical about two guys writing a musical about two guys writing a musical.” Against all odds, the show is chosen for the New Works Festival but their success there is just the beginning of the story. Jeff, Hunter, Susan, and Heidi are soon faced with bigger questions as their small musical starts to attract attention from big Broadway producers. With monetary and literary success in such close proximity, this tight-knit group of four is suddenly forced to ask themselves—is fame worth more than friendship?\n\n[TITLE OF SHOW] is the third show in a season full of heart-warming classics, intriguing thrillers, and joy-filled musicals, including titles like THE MOUSETRAP, SMOKEY JOE’S CAFE, LITTLE WOMEN, and SOMETHING ROTTEN! Single tickets for [TITLE OF SHOW] and the rest of the 21–22 Season can be purchased by calling the box office at 763.422.1838 or by going to www.lyricarts.org/tickets. 5-show Flex Passes are also still available.
