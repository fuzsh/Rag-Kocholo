        "text": "“The Drowsy Chaperone” was like an applied splash of fresh water when it opened on Broadway in 2006.\n\nAudiences, exhausted by the “Gone With the Wind” length of “Les Miz” and bludgeoned by 2006’s oversize clunkers, “Ring of Fire” and “Lestat,” welcomed with open arms this one-act, no-intermission spoof of 1920s musicals. So did the awards voters. The show won five Tony Awards, including best book and best music and lyrics, and the Drama Desk Award for best musical.\n\nAnd so, it was only logical and happy news that the powers at the Gateway Playhouse in Bellport should grab this show as part of their 60th season celebration. The Gateway production does have an intermission, which is a bit of a mood breaker, just as the audience is getting into the spirit of the goofy goings on. Still, they did the same intermission insert in their two mountings of “A Chorus Line” with no noticeable lack of audience appreciation.\n\nThe Gateway’s production is unfailingly high spirited and continuously entertaining. Its only noticeable flaw is the portrayal of the “Man in a Chair,” whose sadness over the state of the contemporary American musical is assuaged by an escape into his record collection of vintage productions—one of which is a ’20s gem titled, of course, “The Drowsy Chaperone.”\n\nThe Man shares his thoughts and his record collection with the audience, and my recollection of Bob Martin’s portrayal of him on Broadway was as an enthusiastic archivist, conducting an ebullient, illustrated tour through the absurdities of a ’20s model musical that comes to life in his somewhat grungy apartment.\n\nIn Bellport, Nat DeWolf’s performance is so over-the-top gay that he emerges more as a caricature from the musical within a play than a commentator upon it. This makes for some noticeable confusion in the audience, which isn’t swept away until the arrival of some fancy tap dancing and a show-stopping number by the show’s star partway into the evening.\n\nIt took a good 25 minutes for the Gateway audience last Saturday night to catch on to the fun, but when they did, they responded mightily. Except for the aforementioned stumble in the direction of one character, director Dom Ruggiero draws wonderfully on-target and hilariously caricatured portrayals of stock characters from the Roaring Twenties musical theater scene, and keeps the goings on going on at breakneck speed.\n\nJody Madaras’s choreography keeps the abbreviated ensemble stepping high and fast. Jeff Hoffman’s musical direction is, as usual, brightly energetic. Brittany Loesch’s scenery, though sparse in the musical scenes, is effective, as is Christopher J. Landy’s lighting design. Margaret McKowen’s costumes are wacky and colorful.\n\nAllyce Beasley portrays an addle-brained mother of the bride with a light touch. The scene in which she gives her “underling,” portrayed by Bob Freschi, instructions in disguising drink orders in case of an infiltration by Prohibition Agents is an ascending delight.\n\nAs Robert, the groom in an impending wedding (which in true ’20s musical style results in a multiple wedding by the finale), Sean Montgomery is suitably and stylishly matinee idolish, and as George, his best man and friend, Matthew Crowle is a winning juvenile.\n\nAnthony Reimer’s cigar chomping Broadway producer is right out of the stock trunk, and Ellie Mooney’s squeaky voiced, mugging turn as Kitty, his assistant, is a sweet delectation. Her leading of the super production number “Toledo Surprise” is nonstop fun. James Donegan’s mobile-faced, multilingual, cape-sweeping Latin lover Adolpho is a comic tour de force (or maybe tour de farce).\n\nAs the bride’s chaperone, who is constantly drowsy because of her nonstop swilling of martinis, Lauren Cohn is a musical comedy pleasure, trilling the reprised “As We Stumble Along,” and outrageously funny in her faux romantic scenes with Adolpho.\n\nJennifer Byrne’s star stint as Janet Van De Graaff, the musical star who wants to give up the stage for the less exhausting demands of a housewife, has the same kind of magic that Foster Sutton brought to the role in the original Broadway production. Her multiple acrobatic and balletic dazzlements in “Show Off” (which she repeatedly sings that she doesn’t want to be) are terrific show stoppers, and her dramatic mugging in the show’s climax is deliciously dynamic.\n\nIf you like satire and the musical theater, and respond to high spirited, expert dancing, you’ll love the Gateway’s “Drowsy Chaperone.” It continues every night but Monday and in numerous matinees through August 22 at the Gateway’s home in Bellport. The box office number is 286-1133."
