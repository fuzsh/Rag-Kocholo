Outstanding Ensemble Performances Awards were given to the cast of Stuff Happens and the cast of Awake and Sing!

Special Awards were presented to: the BMI—Lehman Engel Musical Theater Workshop "for nurturing, developing and promoting new talent for the musical theater"; The York Theatre Company "for its vital contributions to theater by developing and presenting new musicals"; Sh-K-Boom and its label Ghostlight Records "for dedication to the preservation of musical theatre through cast recordings."

Also, the Drama Desk presented a special, lifetime achievement award to playwright Horton Foote. Foote's two plays produced in this season—The Trip to Bountiful and The Traveling Lady—both received nominations for Outstanding Revival of a Play.

The Drama Desk Awards were taped and will be subsequently broadcast nationwide on PBS stations. In New York, the program will be shown on Thirteen/WNET and on NYC-25 TV. The broadcast package was arranged by Roy A. Somlyo, who joined the Drama Desk Awards as consulting producer in 2004 after serving five years as President/CEO of the American Theatre Wing.
