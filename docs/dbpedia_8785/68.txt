The Bank of Guyana is responsible for issuing and managing the Guyanese Dollar.

Exchange Rate System

The Guyanese Dollar operates under a managed floating exchange rate system, where its value relative to other currencies is determined by market forces, such as supply and demand.

The Bank of Guyana may intervene in the foreign exchange market if necessary to maintain stability or prevent excessive fluctuations.

This system allows the Guyanese Dollar to respond to external shocks and changes in global market conditions while maintaining a certain level of stability.
