        "text": "Compare today’s best exchange rate for Guyanese dollar. We compare live prices for money transfer providers in United States — so you can get the best value for your money.\n\nPlanning to send Guyanese dollar with Wise? Sign up and get notified when we launch.\n\nSign up to the waiting list\n\nIt’s simple. The lower the cost of converting your money to GYD, the more money for you. That’s why it’s important to see the full cost of an international transfer before you send it.\n\nWhen sending money abroad, banks or other providers will likely charge you a conversion fee. But that’s not all. Hidden markups in the exchange rate can end up costing even more than the conversion fee itself. This means that when sending international transfers, many banks and providers charge you twice. All without telling you.\n\nAnd if you decide to convert your money in cash, you could be charged:\n\n- a conversion fee\n\n- a hidden markup in the exchange rate\n\n- and extra delivery charges, if you’re ordering your money in advance\n\nYou should always look for the best possible exchange rate, regardless of the conversion method you’re using.\n\n1. Banks trade at the real rate. When exchanging Guyanese dollar between themselves, banks and transfer services use the mid-market rate (also known as the interbank rate). It’s the fairest possible rate. The real exchange rate.\n\n2. They add a hidden markup for customers. This is why you’ll see different exchange rates across providers. You’re paying the difference between the mid-market rate and the rate quoted by your transfer service.\n\n3. You lose money. You’re charged the hidden markup when you make a transfer — often without even realising. Even when services claim to have zero fees, you’re still being charged.\n\nKnowing when to transfer GYD can be tricky. Exchange rates are often volatile, as they react to economic and political events. And rates move so quickly — when you find the right time, how do you lock it in?\n\nWe can let you know when it gets better. Sign up for rate alerts, and you’ll get live updates straight to your inbox."
