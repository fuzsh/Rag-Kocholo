        "text": "Guyana's coin currency history dates back to its time under British colonial rule, prior to gaining independence in 1966. During this period, Guyana used the British colonial currency system, which included coins such as the British penny, shilling, and pence.\n\nShortly after gaining independence, in 1967, Guyana introduced its own series of coins with denominations including 1, 5, 10, 25, and 50 cents, as well as 1 dollar. These coins were part of Guyana's initial steps towards establishing its independent monetary system.\n\nIn 1976, Guyana transitioned to a decimal currency system and issued a new series of coins, maintaining similar denominations. This transition marked an important milestone in the country's economic autonomy. Due to high inflation in 1996, Guyana introduced higher denomination coins, including 1, 5, and 10 dollar coins, to accommodate the changing economic landscape.\n\nThe symbol for the Guyanese dollar is \"$\" or \"GYD\", representing its currency in international markets. Guyana's coins range from 1 cent to 5 dollars, each exhibiting distinct compositions and designs. The lower denominations, such as the 1 and 5 cents, are typically crafted from bronze, while the 10 and 25 cents are composed of nickel-plated steel. Higher denominations, like the 50 cents, 1 dollar, and 5 dollars, are commonly made of a copper-nickel alloy.\n\nNotably, the 10-dollar coin stands out with its equilateral-curved heptagonal shape, adding a unique feature to Guyana's coinage.\n\nIn August 2020, the Bank of Guyana issued a significant addition to its coinage with the introduction of the $100 coin, which marked the first colored coin in Guyana's currency history.\n\nThese coins often feature national symbols, historical figures, or landmarks, reflecting Guyana's rich cultural heritage and history."
