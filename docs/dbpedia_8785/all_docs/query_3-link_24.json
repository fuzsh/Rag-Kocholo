        "text": "The upgraded 1,000 GYD (Guyana Dollars) banknote was issued on March 4, 2019, with a 6 mm RAPID® micro-optic security thread from Crane Currency replacing the previous holographic stripe and colorshift thread.\n\nThe blue micro-optic feature displays fluid and highly visible movement behind the national flower the Victoria Regia Lily. With only a slight tilt of the banknote, high contrast bands in the RAPID feature move up and down behind the denomination ‘1000’ as the flower petals shimmer in blue and white.\n\nThe economy has traditionally been very diverse. The country is covered with dense forests and is home to fertile agricultural lands and abundant natural resources with gold, bauxite, sugar, rice, timber and shrimp among its leading exports.\n\nBut things changed rapidly in 2015 when large fields of oil and gas were found outside the coast. At the time of production start in 2019, around 100,000 barrels of oil were expected to be extracted every day and the levels have since increased.\n\nFor a country with just around 740,000 citizens within 215,000 square kilometers, the new emerging oil and gas sector now represents billions in revenues.\n\n“I see the oil and gas income as a windfall. Our traditional sectors will still be in focus, and we will continue to develop and keep an eye on the employment rates. The growth must be sustainable – we don’t want to have the ‘Dutch disease’,” says Dr. Gobind Ganga."
