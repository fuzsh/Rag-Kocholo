        "text": "Time Difference\n\nThe United Kingdom (GMT) is five hours ahead of Guyana, where they currently observe Guyana Time (GYT) all year. Daylight Saving Time has never been used here and so the clocks do not change seasonally.\n\nMoney\n\nCredit card use is growing in the retail and hospitality sectors but Guyana is still a largely cash-based economy, which is something to be mindful of when travelling here. Scotia Bank’s ATMs accept most international bankcards (Visa/Mastercard) and US Dollars are the more widely accepted foreign currency (it can be worth carrying some small denomination notes).\n\nElectricity\n\nIn Guyana the supply voltage is 120/240V and the power plugs and sockets are of type A, B, D and G meaning you will not need a converter or transformer, but you will need a travel adaptor.\n\nShops and Amenities\n\nGenerally, merchants open from 8am until 12pm and then again from 1pm until 4.30pm Monday to Friday, with Saturday opening hours from 8am until 12pm. Stabroek and Bourda markets are often open 24/7.\n\nMedia\n\nGuyana has a daily newspaper owned by the Guyanese government called The Guyana Chronicle and they also publish a weekly Sunday Chronicle. There’s the popular Official Gazette of Guyana and television wise, the main stations are NCN news and CNC Channel 6, which offer news updates, Bollywood and Hollywood Movies as well as local talk shows.\n\nPost\n\nPost offices are open between 7am and 3pm Monday to Friday, 7am to 11am on Saturdays and closed on Sundays.\n\nPhone\n\nTo call the United Kingdom from Guyana, dial: 001 - 44 followed by the number you’re calling.\n\nInternet and Mobile Coverage\n\nIn Guyana, Internet access has been continuously rising and improving its coverage, meaning it’s now at a much higher level and should be more accessible. There are two mobile operators: GTT+ (formerly Cellink plus, by GT&T) and Digicel Guyana, with good coverage throughout and the introduction of 5G.\n\nCurrency\n\nGuyanese dollar"
