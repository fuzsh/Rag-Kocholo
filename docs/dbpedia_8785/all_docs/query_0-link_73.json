        "text": "Description\n\nThe Guyana dollar is the official currency in Guyana since 1839, when it started a transitional changeover of the Dutch guilder to the British pound sterling system. In the 1970s, an anti-inflationary measure was come with the US dollar and the Eastern Caribbean Currency Authority, whose Guyana was a member, arranged the switch in 1975. Coins were issued in 1967 in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 cents. Then, because of the high inflation, the 1, 5 and 10 dollars coins were introduced.\n\nThe 1 Dollar coin front design features the National Coat of Arms (which includes the Crown of the Cacique, two diamonds, a helmet, two jaguars holding a beak, sugar cane and a rice stalk, a shield decorated with the Victoria amazonica lily, the national flower of Guyana, three blue lines representing the three rivers. Guyana’s main birds and the national bird, the hoatzin. Finally, the national motto, “One People, One Nation, One Destiny,” appears below the shield). The reverse coin design has a hand gathering rice, a staple food in Guyana and the denomination. This coin is part of the 1996 – 2005 series, its rim is fluted, and its color is bronze.\n\nText: 1 Dollar, Guyana, One people, One Nation, One Destiny, Bank of Guyana, Rice Harvest, 2002."
