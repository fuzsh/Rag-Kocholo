        "text": "Though Guyana is experiencing substantial economic growth, both the government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) agree that the value of the Guyanese dollar should remain the same for now.\n\nIncreasing the value of the dollar refers to an appreciation of the currency. The increase of the currency is measured against another currency; for example, increasing the Guyanese dollar against the United States (US) dollar.\n\nAccording to a report issued by the IMF on Tuesday, both the government and staff of the Fund agreed that exchange rate stability currently serves Guyana’s needs best- particularly given the underdevelopment of domestic financial markets.\n\n“The accumulation of substantial buffers in the Natural Resource Fund will also strengthen Guyana’s headroom to maintain a stable exchange rate,” the report stated.\n\nIt was, however, advised that foreign exchange interventions should be used to address disorderly market conditions and to smooth short-term fluctuations in the nominal exchange rate in some instances.\n\nBut eventually increasing the money value has not been ruled out.\n\nIn fact, the report said that both the IMF staff and the local authorities agree that this can be examined in the medium to long term as Guyana becomes a major oil producer.\n\nIt was noted that the country’s monetary policy framework can be revised eventually to allow the exchange rate to absorb external financial shocks and increase its flexibility to maintain competitiveness.\n\nEarlier this year, President Dr. Irfaan Ali explained that if Guyana’s currency changes “overnight”, there will be rapid changes in the cost of items.\n\nGovernor of the Bank of Guyana (BoG) Dr. Gobind Ganga elaborated on this.\n\nEssentially, if the value of Guyana’s currency increases – that is, fewer Guyana dollars will be needed in exchange for a higher valued currency like the US dollar – the money raked in from exports will decrease.\n\nAnd though the cost of imports will reduce with an appreciation of the currency, the Central Bank Governor explained that the country’s expenses may not readily decline.\n\nTo illustrate this, he used the example of the exchange rate between Guyana and the US.\n\nIf some Guyanese export – be it sugar, rice, gold or otherwise – is sold for US $1 million, the amount received would equate to about GY $215 million using an exchange rate of GY $215 to US $1.\n\nDr. Ganga, however, noted that if the currency appreciates and there is an exchange rate of GY $210 to US $1, the country would earn GY $210 million instead. Unless the cost of producing those export products reduces, there will be a gap in money received."
