        "text": "I am the Colin Powell Chair for Cancer Research, Chair of the Department of Health Services Research, and a Professor of Medicine in the Department of Breast Medical Oncology at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. My research interests include quality of health care delivery, disparities, and outcomes for cancer patients. I am currently funded through NCI, CPRIT, and Susan G. Komen. I serve as the co-leader of the Risk, Detection and Outcomes Program for the MD Anderson Cancer Center Support Grant. I have over 250 publications and have a track record of continuous funding since 2004. I have served on national guideline committees including as the Chair of ASCO's Clinical Practice Guideline Committee, co-Chair of ASCO's Breast Cancer Guideline Advisory Group and as a member of the NCCN Breast Cancer Guideline Panel. I am the Chair of ASCO's Nominating Committee.\n\nThroughout my career, I have been committed to mentoring and educating junior investigators. I previously coordinated the educational activities for the Department of Breast Medical Oncology and served on the Fellowship Committee. While I managed this rotation, the department was twice selected as Teaching Department of the Year. I received two nominations for the Educator of the Year, and I was nominated the UT Regents Award in Education. In my current position, I consider my most important responsibility to be mentoring and developing the careers of trainees and junior faculty. I have successfully mentored prior trainees on NCI K awards (5), ASCO Young Investigator Grants and DOD grants. My work in mentoring was recognized with the Cancer Medicine Mentor of the Year Award and the MD Anderson President's Faculty Excellence Award in Education and Mentorship."
