POINT OF VIEW PAPER\n\n\"It was clear Elizabeth was frustrated--she tried several times to get past the guards. The last time she tried, they pointed their bayonets at her.\n\n\"They're pointing guns at her! Are they going to shoot a teenager on live television?\"\n\n\"Oh, my Lord,\" Aunt Bessie mumbled, her eyes fixed on the television screen.\n\nSylvia grabbed her aunt's hand. \"If that was me, I'd be so scared I'd be wetting my pants? I know she's terrified!\"\n\nElizabeth turned then, glanced around to see what she should do, or to look for help perhaps, and all that stood in front of her was a sea of angry white faces. She walked slowly down the steps, and as she got closer to what was now a mob, they grew fierce.\n\nSylvia started to cry as she watched. \"Oh, Aunt Bessie, a lady is spitting on her.\"\n\n\"She's all alone,\" Aunt Bessie moaned.\n\n\"They're calling her names! How can grownups do that to a kid?\" Tears streamed down Sylvia's face.\n\nElizabeth walked slowly and silently. It was unbelievable.\n\nRead the passage above and explain how the point of view of the character who makes the observation influences the description. How would Elizabeth have written this passage? How would a person in the mob have written this passage?\n\n2. DESCRIPTIVE PAPER\n\n\" The explosions that surrounded her the next moment caused her to drop the eggs in her hand as she was tossed to the floor. Her head connected with the floorboards before the rest of her body. A shelf full of groceries fell over onto Sylvia. As if she were outside of herself watching the horrible scene, she knew she was screaming, knew she was falling, knew this must be what it felt like to die.\n\nThe noise of the falling shelves and dry goods frightened her more than the feeling of crumpled wood on her legs. Most of it fell around her rather than upon her. Even so, sheer terror overwhelmed her. Her screams became clogged as debris filled her mouth, and she was finding it hard to breathe.\n\nStunned for a moment, Sylvia at first could see nothing. Gradually she dimly became aware of eggshells and gooey egg yolk in her hair and on her clothes. Something wet and drippy snaked down her back. Her mouth was full of a thick and powdery substance. She couldn't move her legs. Her head throbbed. Rachel seemed to have disappeared. . . . Sylvia sat up carefully and tried to catch her breath, but she coughed once more as a sharp, acrid odor filled the small room. The smell reminded her of the barbecues her father prepared on holidays--how her mother always fussed at him because he used too much kerosene to start the fire. Fire. It was then the odor of burning wood and oil assaulted her. Oh, my God! The store's on fire!\"\n\nUsing the passage above as a guide, write a descriptive paper that uses sensory imagery. Use vivid verbs and powerful adjectives and adverbs as you write. Use as many of the senses as you can--sight, sound, smell, touch, taste--as well as deep, rich colors.\n\n3. NARRATIVE PAPER\n\n\"Knocking down fire barriers and jumping over hoses, Calvin arrived with a clatter on his bicycle. \"Where's my mother?\" he shouted over the noise of the fire trucks and hoses. \"Sylvie? Are you okay? Have you seen my mother?\"\n\n\"I don't know, Calvin. Everything happened so fast.\" Sylvia looked distraught as Calvin ran toward the burning buildings.\n\n\"You can't go in there, son!\" an officer yelled at Calvin, chasing him. \"It's totally engulfed!\"\n\nCalvin ignored him and kept on running. The officer caught him and tackled him to the ground. Calvin squirmed and fought, but the policeman was stronger. \"I gotta find her! I gotta find my mother!\"\n\n\"If she's in there, you can't help her, son,\" the policeman said gently.\n\nFinally, what was left of the two buildings, with a great whoosh, crumbled in on themselves. The crowd stepped back in awe at the horror of it all. Sparks and flames flew into the sky, along with thick, black smoke. Calvin wept.\"\n\nWrite a narrative paper from the point of view of someone whose friend or family member is in a dangerous situation. Tell the story as the person tries to grasp the enormity and horror of what is happening.\n\n4. EXPOSITORY PAPER\n\n\"Sylvia thought about the women she'd seen in those magazine ads--all of them housewives, not professionals. \"Absolutely,\" she said. \"I want to do more than what I see women doing on television, Rachel,\" Sylvia admitted. \"I Love Lucy is a great show, but all she does is stay home, clean house, and get in trouble with Ricky! Besides, who's gonna take seriously a lady who's wearing a lace apron and holding a mixing spoon in her hand?\"\n\nBoth girls laughed. \"That's why Lucy is so popular! You and I think alike, Sylvia Faye. Do you think there will ever be a television program with a policewoman or lady detective or lady doctor as the main character?\"\n\n\"Only if she's funny and acts silly,\" Sylvia replied, as she helped Rachel sort the goods for the shelves.\"\n\nWrite an expository (explanatory) paper on the role of women in television and magazine commercials. Discuss how those roles and images have changed since 1957.\n\n5. PERSONAL ESSAY\n\n\"I just got finished looking at myself closely--at least as much of me as I can see in our tiny bathroom mirror.\n\nThe mirror is a little warped, but it showed me a brown-skinned girl with puffy black hair, a nose that's too large for her face, and full, possibly kissable lips, assuming I could find somebody who wanted to kiss them. Reggie's lips would be a nice starting point!\n\nI have ridiculously bushy eyebrows and short, stubby eyelashes. OK, I'll never be a movie star. My skin is too oily, so my face always looks shiny--I hate that--and I have tiny little pimples that dot my forehead and cheeks. Goodness! I'll never get married at this rate!\n\nLooking at myself on the inside is even harder I'm not talking about hearts and lungs and stuff like that, but whether I'm brave like Miss Washington said, or noble, or admirable, or any of those adjectives they only use at somebody's funeral. I know I'm just as intelligent as any white student, and just as worthy of a good education as anybody else in this country. Why should the color of my skin make a difference? I don't get it.\"\n\nWrite a self-descriptive personal essay. Focusing on the positive, include your interior as well as exterior assets.\n\n6. PERSONAL ESSAY 2\n\n\"When I take Tiny Tears out and hold her in my arms, the smell of her, almost like baby powder, still makes me smile. Her eyes really blink in her sculpted face. When you squeeze the doll's tummy, she coos. That sound, the feel of her soft, rubber body, even her slightly-scratched, painted-on hair take me back to a time of safety and happiness and real joy. I still love that doll and she is the most beautiful thing I own. And she's a little white baby. They don't make Negro dolls.\"\n\nWrite a personal essay that describes a special memory or object in your life. Explain why it is meaningful to you. Be sure to include sensory imagery--sights, smells, touches, tastes, sounds.\n\n7. PERSUASIVE PAPER\n\n\"I think I finally understand Gary's anger and hatred and his need to DO! It's a good thing I like to write--it's my way of letting out all that stuff without screaming. I want to hit something, hurt something! I want to break a window or smash in some ugly, yellow teeth! I want to cry.\n\nI can still smell their rotten breath, see the hatred in their little bitty eyes, feel their hands on us. And how dare Johnny touch my baby sister! She's too young to have to live like this. She's supposed to worry about stupid little-kid stuff like playing with her dolls and tea cups, not about unwashed teen-aged bigots knocking her around on the sidewalk. This is going to mess her up for a long time--maybe for the rest of her life. Memories like that don't go away.\n\nI know I'm not going to forget. Ever.\n\nIs this what it will be like every day at Central High? Walking down the halls with people who hate you just because your skin is darker than theirs? Maybe I'm not the hero Miss Lillie says I am. Maybe this is not the path I'm supposed to walk. So many folks are depending on me, putting me up on a pedestal I never asked to be on. It was never my idea to do this anyway--it was Gary who wanted to be in the front of the fight. I hate fighting. Does that make me a coward?\"\n\nWrite a persuasive paper that argues ONE of the following points:\n\n\"Individuals who are full of hate and bigotry are the source of much unhappiness in the world.\n\n\"All human beings are given strong spirits in order to withstand the difficulties of life.\"\n\n\"Individuals who suffer discrimination become stronger and can help others as a result. OR \"Individuals who suffer discrimination become weaker and can be destroyed as a result.\n\nWhether you agree or disagree, your paper should address only one side of the issue. Use specifics from the novel to support your points.\n\n8. CHARACTER SKETCH\n\n\"Miss Ethel Washington, their English and Social Studies teacher, who was a stern, unsmiling woman with large hips and a tiny waist, got the class quiet and serious with a glance. She was tall and plump, and from what Sylvia could tell, probably close to sixty years old. She had taught many of their parents and a few of their grandparents as well.\n\nHer black hair, streaked with lots of gray, was pulled back tightly into a bun on her neck. She wore large brown glasses, which fell to the tip of her nose when she asked a question in class, and sturdy brown shoes that were never seen untied. Her dresses, made of stiff fabric in various shades of black or gray or brown, never seemed to wrinkle. Sylvia had never seen Miss Washington wear a brightly colored or a flowered dress. She figured a painted rose or a daisy just might wilt, like one of Miss Lillie's leftover buds, if it had to lie that close to the body of Miss Ethel Washington!\"\n\nWrite a character sketch of a strong powerful person that you know or have met. Use strong verbs and adjectives, as well as sensory imagery.\n\n9. POETRY\n\n\"Sometimes I feel like scrambled eggs\n\nall runny in the pan\n\nMy life's the yolk\n\nand I'm the joke\n\nthat's served with cheese or bran . . .\"\n\nWrite a poem in the format of \"Scrambled Eggs\" that includes your feelings. Include sensory imagery and vivid vocabulary.\n\n\"She tends us like hyacinths--\n\nDelicate sprouts, fragile buds,\n\nDetermined we will bloom.\n\nFiercely she rips the weeds\n\nfrom around us--\n\nNo ragged, uncultured\n\npiece of greengrowth\n\nwould ever dare to approach us.\"\n\nWrite a poem in the format of \"My Mother's Garden\" that discusses a favorite person in your life. Include sensory imagery and vivid vocabulary. \"You grasp frantically\n\nto fight away the void of air\n\nand the collapse of earth\n\nand the sting of fire.\"\n\nWrite a poem in the format of \"Searching for a Dream\" that discusses hopes and dreams and possibilities. Include sensory imagery and vivid vocabulary.\n\n10. RESEARCH PAPER\n\nA. Research the history of school segregation and integration in the United States."
