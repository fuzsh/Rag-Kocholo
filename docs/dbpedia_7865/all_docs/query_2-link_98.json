I want to find something to run toward.\n\n– Hannah Harrington\n\nThe place in which I’ll fit will not exist until I create it.\n\n– James Baldwin\n\nConsequently we should also not use the other for our own supposed redemption. The other is no stepping stone for our feet. It is far better that we remain with ourselves.\n\n– @RedBookJung\n\nPeople should know that not only the neurotic, but everyone, naturally prefers never to seek the causes of any inconvenience in himself, but to push them as far away from himself as possible in space in time. Otherwise he would run the risk of having to make a change for the better.\n\n– Carl Jung\n\nTo write well, to write passionately, to be less inhibited, to be warmer, to be more self-critical, to recognize the power of as well as the force of lust, to write, to love.\n\n– John Cheever\n\nThe analyst must go on learning endlessly.

One begins to copy oneself and to copy oneself is more dangerous than to copy others.\n\n– Picasso\n\nThe Buddha encouraged us to think of the good things done for us by our parents, by our teachers, friends, whomever; and to do this intentionally, to cultivate it, rather than just letting it happen accidentally.\n\n– Ajahn Sumedho\n\nI will examine their leaves as pages in a text and consider the bookish pigeons, students of winter.\n\n– Edward Hirsch\n\nI am so small walking on the beach at night under the widening sky.\n\n– Edward Hirsch\n\nTalking about dreams is like talking about movies, since the cinema uses the language of dreams; years can pass in a second, and you can hop from one place to another.\n\n– Federico Fellini\n\nI’ve always felt that there’s a very thin membrane between madness, alcoholism, and/or destitution and being an OK American guy in a comfortable heated apartment with meatballs and a decent Sauvignon Blanc in the fridge.\n\n– August Kleinzahler\n\nMemory is not in the head / only.\n\n– Margaret Atwood\n\nThe Sea will be the Sea, whatever the drop’s philosophy.\n\n– Attar of Nishapur\n\nWhoever marries\n\nthe spirit of a\n\ngenerational will\n\nbe widowed by\n\nthe next.\n\n– Leonard Cohen\n\nAs the saying goes:\n\nThe sign of true\n\nlearning is a\n\npeaceful\n\ntemperament, and\n\nthe sign of having\n\nmeditated is fewer\n\nafflictions.\n\n– Dudjom Rinpoche\n\nMy imagination functions much better when I don’t have to speak to people.\n\n– Patricia Highsmith\n\nIn poetry, the language of doubt must be written in doubt-free language.\n\n– Bakhtin\n\nTo explain the pleasure I take/in loneliness, I speak of privacy.\n\n– Chase Twitchell, Inland\n\nRead, read, read. Read everything — trash, classics, good and bad, and see how they do it. Just like a carpenter who works as an apprentice and studies the master. Read!\n\n– William Faulkner\n\nI was a ballot box stuffed full of everyone’s opinions except my own.\n\n– Rudy Francisco\n\nI know what they’d like, they’d like a blank they could fill in.

Why don’t they get up and go?\n\n– Iris Murdoch\n\nIdeally, art, pure, is of a sphere and of no country; the first real artists, always and everywhere, have either been importers or immigrants bringing the light with them.\n\n– Oscar Florianus Bluemner\n\nEverything you write is autobiographical, even science fiction, and the planet Ork. In some way even that is a reflection of you—who you are.\n\n– Paula Fox\n\nArt has always had a balancing effect on your mind; it is a reminder that you are more than a body and its accompanying grief.\n\n– Carmen Maria Machado\n\nI want to write a novel with no missed notes.\n\n– Barry Hannah\n\nBecause survival is insufficient.\n\n– Emily St. John Mandel\n\nHow sad it is when a luxurious imagination is obliged in self defense to deaden its delicacy in vulgarity, and riot in things attainable that it may not have leisure to go mad after things that are not?\n\n– John Keats\n\nIf I can keep you I should want to live forever.\n\n– Franz Kafka, 1912.\n\nLet us riot in the unattainable!\n\n– Dean Young\n\nIndian Summer\n\nblueberries burst\n\nin the batter\n\n– Jennie Townsend\n\nI remember so many things\n\nSo many evenings rooms walks rages\n\nSo many stops in worthless places.\n\n– Louis Aragon\n\nEvery poem holds the unspeakable inside it. The unsayable… The thing that you can’t really say because it’s too complicated. It’s too complex for us. Every poem has that silence deep in the center of it.\n\n– Marie Howe\n\nYou must see the totality of your personality in the present—all the thoughts, desires, feelings, and dreams, which are continuous with your past. You may also see your personality, at all times continuous with the social structure around you, in all your relationships, the influence of your society on your personality, and so on. You will see that your ego activity is what connects you to the social network of personality, making you vulnerable to the various external influences that obscure the truth of who you are, and what reality is. When you see this completely, it is possible for the movement in you—that connects you with the rest of society—to stop. When it stops, you become pure, clarified personality, soul with no ego structure. This clarifies and heals the split from Being. The split simply is not there. In that instant you see that you and the supreme reality are one. For the first time, you can perceive the actual substance of the personality without the past. The basis of the personality, the underlying principle that makes it possible for you to be a person, the thing that you have rejected all this time, is nothing but the supreme reality as a person. The very substance of the personality is ultimately a substance which I call the Supreme Pearl, or the supreme person: pure personal presence with no qualities. It is just Being, pure and simple, but manifesting as a human person. So when the personality is completely clarified, and yet you feel you are a person, the personality doesn’t disappear; it is now the supreme person, the truest person. This is a sublime reality existing as you, the human individual.\n\n– A. H. Almaas, Diamond Heart Book Four\n\nHumor (is) the process that allows one to brush reality aside when it gets too distressing.\n\n– André Breton\n\nMy most boomer take is that not everything needs to be a subscription service.\n\n– Frances Klein\n\nThe real difficulty is to overcome how you think about yourself.\n\n– Maya Angelou\n\nThe big secret is the ability to stay in the room. The writer is the person who stays in the room.\n\n– Ron Carlson\n\nI’ll never go back to being what I may never have been….\n\n– Fernando Pessoa\n\nThe king fears only the poet.\n\n– African proverb\n\nThere were moments, of course. Those small spaces in time, too soon gone, when everything seems to stand still, and existence is balanced on a perfect point, like the moment of change between the dark and the light, and when both and neither surround you.\n\n– Diana Gabaldon, Outlander\n\nWhat we need is recklessness and an owl-shit outburst and a good smack upside the head every now and then. I, too, am creature of electrified lint; give me a doily, and I’ll blow my nose on it, and I mean that in the best possible way.\n\n– Dean Young\n\n…it’s not always easy to tell who the rightful narrators should be, unless we keep redefining with each page what it means to conquer and be conquered.\n\n– Edwidge Danticat\n\nArt is a harmony parallel to nature.\n\n– Paul Cézanne\n\nWithout walking I would be dead. [. . .]\n\n– Robert Walser\n\nIf you operate out of “what is” instead of living mired in your projections, you can begin to work your way out of any dilemma. When reality is honored, you are speaking from a divine place.\n\n– Robert A. Johnson, Jerry M. Ruhl, Contentment\n\nSomething changed in the world. Not too long ago, it changed, and we know it. We don’t know how to explain it yet, but I think we all can feel it, somewhere deep in our gut or in our brain circuits. We feel time differently. No one has quite been able to capture what is happening or say why. Perhaps it’s just that we sense an absence of future, because the present has become too overwhelming, so the future has become unimaginable. And without future, time feels like only an accumulation. An accumulation of months, days, natural disasters, television series, terrorist attacks, divorces, mass migrations, birthdays, photographs, sunrises. […] Perhaps if we found a new way to document [the world], we might begin to understand this new way we experience space and time.\n\n– Valeria Luiselli\n\nWe watch the pitiful little ferry boats that ply between this world and that other one touched to flame by sunset.\n\n– Denis Johnson, Night\n\nMen tire themselves in pursuit of rest.\n\n– Laurence Sterne\n\nUnmindful people go after sensory objects and get bewildered. Those who are mindful, on the other hand, want to find the root of the entire process.\n\n– Bhante Gunaratana and Julia Harris\n\nBut the sky slips a coin in the slot between two buildings.\n\n– Denise Levertov, Suburban Dusk\n\nI cringe when critics say I’m a master of the popular novel. What’s an unpopular novel?\n\n– Irwin Shaw\n\nIf you can’t tell whose imagination you’re living in, you’ll interiorize someone else’s worldview, limitations, fears, and desires, thinking they’re What Reality Is Like. Imaginal literacy is a core competency\n\n– River Kenna\n\nMy glass is filled, my pipe is lit, My den is all a cosy glow; And snug before the fire I sit, And wait to feel the old year go.\n\n– Robert W. Service\n\nMen often bore, books often bore, all things human can bore; nature, never.\n\n– John Fowles\n\nThe acid of modernity has taken away many things. But what will not disappear is passion, because we live in bodies, because we have eyes and ears and tongues and noses and fingers and skin. What will not disappear is joy, to the extent that children are born, and to the extent that there is something that brings us closer to ‘nature’, and to the extent where there is literature and art and music and dance. (… ) What will not go away will be human evil.\n\n– Susan Sontag\n\nWhen I first read the dictionary. I thought it was a poem about everything.\n\n– Steven Wright\n\nThe children laugh at us. The children hear what we will not.\n\n– Penina Ava Taesali\n\nLightning\n\nanchors the hard dry rice field\n\nto the evening sky\n\n– Yosa Buson (tr. Allan Persinger)\n\nI, like any decent person, often tire of my point of views.\n\n– Arno Schmidt\n\nThe effect of life in society is to complicate and confuse our existence, making us forget who we really are by causing us to become obsessed with what we are not.\n\n– Chuang Tzu\n\n“I’m not saying that you have to be a reader to save your soul in the modern world,” Walter Mosley said. “I’m saying it helps.”\n\n…it’s a worm in the brain, solitude is.\n\n– Edith Wharton\n\nIn a nation of sex-obsessed saints and greedy selfish liberals, in a nation approaching a racial chasm grounded on growing poverty and a rampant lack of compassion, there seems to be a deep need to determine if someone else’s thoughts are proper rather than well stated, or true, or funny, or felt.\n\nEdward Abbey was not cut out for such a world. He will never be what you approve of, though he will be what you secretly think but are afraid to say or admit to. And he will most often act out the one thing you dream of but cannot do: live your life regardless of the opinions of others.\n\n– Charles Bowden\n\nThe sadness is real whether you say it or not.\n\nThe sadness is only a hydra if you call it one.\n\n– Patrick Roche\n\nIf the desire to write is not accompanied by actual writing, then the desire must be not to write.\n\n– Hugh Prather\n\nThe cause of happiness is rare, And many are the seeds of suffering! But if I have no pain, I’ll never long for freedom; Therefore, O my mind, be steadfast!\n\n– Shantideva\n\nA library is not only a place of both order and chaos; it is also the realm of chance. Books, even after they have been given a shelf and a number, retain a mobility of their own. Left to their own devices, they assemble in their own formations; they follow secret rules of similarity, unchronicled genealogies, common interests and themes.\n\n– Alberto Manguel\n\nToday’s real college is a collection of books.\n\n– Thomas Carlyle\n\nAuthoritarianism and democracy are not compatible. Authoritarian systems need to have everything spelled out in terms of clear-cut causes and effects (who has the power and who doesn’t). A machine is the perfect metaphor authoritarianism. While it tries to make us into interchangeable machines, democracy invites us to more fully become our unique and unpredictable selves. Authoritarianism tends to make human society less like the natural world while democracy makes us more like natural ecosystems.Authoritarianism restricts communication in favor of pre-established rules while democracy – like biological evolution – uses communicational influence and adaptation to evolve the rules.\n\nThough we are only starting to recognize the full ramifications of what switching from a coercive to a communicational paradigm could mean for human experience, this has been implicit in the idea of democracy from the beginning. And now that new biological discoveries about communicational proteins in the body (peptides) and evolution through alliance (symbiogenesis) are showing that biological complexities are not entirely comprehensible in mechanistic terms, the natural wilderness appears to be a messy but functional democracy.\n\n– George Gorman\n\nAnd now I know\n\nWhy comes the snow:\n\nThe bare black places lie\n\nToo near the sky.\n\n– Charles Bertram Johnson\n\nThe Narrow Way\n\nBelieve not those who say\n\nThe upward path is smooth,\n\nLest thou shouldst stumble in the way,\n\nAnd faint before the truth.\n\nIt is the only road\n\nUnto the realms of joy;\n\nBut he who seeks that blest abode\n\nMust all his powers employ.\n\nBright hopes and pure delights\n\nUpon his course may beam,\n\nAnd there, amid the sternest heights\n\nThe sweetest flowerets gleam.\n\nOn all her breezes borne,\n\nEarth yields no scents like those;\n\nBut he that dares not grasp the thorn\n\nShould never crave the rose.\n\nArm—arm thee for the fight!\n\nCast useless loads away;\n\nWatch through the darkest hours of night,\n\nToil through the hottest day.\n\nCrush pride into the dust,\n\nOr thou must needs be slack;\n\nAnd trample down rebellious lust,\n\nOr it will hold thee back.\n\nSeek not thy honor here;\n\nWaive pleasure and renown;\n\nThe world’s dread scoff undaunted bear,\n\nAnd face its deadliest frown.\n\nTo labor and to love,\n\nTo pardon and endure,\n\nTo lift thy heart to God above,\n\nAnd keep thy conscience pure;\n\nBe this thy constant aim,\n\nThy hope, thy chief delight;\n\nWhat matter who should whisper blame,\n\nOr who should scorn or slight?\n\nWhat matter, if thy God approve,\n\nAnd if, within thy breast,\n\nThou feel the comfort of His love,\n\nThe earnest of His rest?\n\n– Anne Brontë\n\n[The will to see oneself as fragile]\n\nThe will to see oneself as\n\nfragile, fallible,\n\nliable to fail.\n\nTo consider a stranger and\n\nhear, in the mind’s ear,\n\none’s true voice\n\ninsisting: I must change.\n\nOrdinary people do this\n\nPatient urgent work\n\nalone and together\n\nday upon day upon day.\n\nLike my mother, once,\n\nleading her ailing mother\n\nback through the maze\n\nof our suburban scrawl,\n\npast ache, past haze,\n\npast confusion and rage\n\ntoward a neat room\n\nwhere waited prayer,\n\nfear, forgiveness,\n\ngrief, grace. This\n\nis a poem about kin\n\nand neighbors and nations\n\nadrift, in error, under siege.\n\nThis is a ceasefire poem.\n\n– Tracy K Smith\n\nWhat a shame it is to hear someone declare that things lose their beauty at night ! All lustre, ornamentation and brilliance come into their own at night.\n\n– Yoshida Kenko\n\nThought experiment: What if your deepest wound were caused by jealousy of you? That could be a person, or a spirit, a family or a culture. Let yourself imagine it is true, just for a moment. – who do you see? – What about you are they jealous of? (be free here to believe what comes up) – How does this change the way you relate to your wounds? Thinking about wounds these days; hope this short experiment opens a dream door into your healing.\n\n– David Bedrick\n\nI Am Happy Living Simply\n\nby Marina Tsvetaeva\n\nTranslated by Ilya Kaminsky and Jean Valentine\n\nI am happy living simply:\n\nlike a clock, or a calendar.\n\nWorldly pilgrim, thin,\n\nwise—as any creature. To know\n\nthe spirit is my beloved.\n\nTo come to things—swift\n\nas a ray of light, or a look.\n\nTo live as I write: spare—the way\n\nGod asks me—and friends do not.\n\nThis\n\nis a poem about kin\n\nand neighbors and nations\n\nadrift, in error, under siege.\n\nThis is a ceasefire poem.\n\n– Tracy K. Smith\n\nBecause I know\n\nNow: how it feels\n\nTo sip that small space\n\nBetween becoming\n\nAnd being found.\n\n– Camonghne Felix\n\nIn the Woods of Language, She Collects Beautiful Sticks\n\nby Valzhyna Mort\n\nlike a snail with a shell of sticks\n\n— she loads them on her back —\n\nLike a camel with a hump of sticks\n\n— on her back, on her back —\n\nLike a horse with a knight of sticks and a stick for a sword\n\nWhere is she taking this load of sticks?\n\n— on her hump, on her hump —\n\nShe has no house, where is she taking the house she doesn’t have?\n\n— in the fire she is taking it in the fire —\n\nIn the fire she is making a poem entirely out of sticks on fire and it goes like this\n\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nso weird when people read a novel looking for answers. novels are questions. question after question after question.\n\n– Isle McElroy\n\nObserving language’s soaring and moving autonomy, I used to tell myself: it’s not me who writes this, it’s the Night.\n\n– Hélène Cixous\n\nI am made and remade continually. Different people draw different words from me.\n\n– Virginia Woolf\n\nthere are two wolves inside each of us, one is always hungry and the other one is always sleepy.\n\n– Kristof Smeyers\n\nThe entire continent of Africa is responsible for less than 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n– Vanessa Nakate\n\nINTER-BEING\n\nIf you are a poet, you will see clearly that there is a cloud floating in this sheet of paper. Without a cloud, there will be no rain; without rain, the trees cannot grow; and without trees, we cannot make paper. The cloud is essential for the paper to exist. If the cloud is not here, the sheet of paper cannot be here either. So we can say that the cloud and the paper “inter-are”…\n\nIf we continue to look into this sheet of paper, we can see the sunshine in it. If the sunshine is not there, the forest cannot grow. Without the sunshine nothing can grow, not even us. So we know that the sunshine is also in this sheet of paper. The paper and the sunshine inter-are. Looking more deeply, we can see the logger who cut the tree and brought it to the mill to be transformed into paper. We also see the wheat. We know that the logger cannot exist without his daily bread. So the wheat that became his bread is also in this sheet of paper. The logger’s father and mother are in the paper as well. Without all of these other things, there would be no sheet of paper at all.\n\nLooking even more deeply, we can see we are also in the paper. This is not difficult to see, because when we look at a sheet of paper, the sheet of paper becomes the object of our perception. It is becoming more and more clear to neuroscientists that we cannot exactly speak of an objective world outside of our perceptions, nor can we speak of a wholly subjective world in which things exist only in our mind. Everything – time, space, the earth, the rain, the minerals in the soil, the sunshine, the cloud, the river, the heat, and even consciousness – is in that sheet of paper. Everything coexists with it. To be is to inter-be. You cannot just be by yourself alone; you have to inter-be with every other thing. This sheet of paper is, because everything else is.\n\nSuppose we try to return one of the elements to its source. If we returned the sunshine to the sun, would the sheet of paper still be possible? No, without sunshine the tree cannot be. If we returned the logger to his mother, then we wouldn’t have a sheet of paper either. Looking in this way, we see that this sheet of paper is made up entirely of “non-paper elements” and if we were to return any one of these non-paper elements to their source, there would be no paper at all. As thin as this sheet of paper is, it contains everything in the universe. So the one contains the all.\n\n– Thich Nhat Hanh\n\nThe world we live in is vastly different\n\nfrom the world we think we live in.\n\n– Nassim Nicholas Taleb\n\nThe wind has blown a warm yellow moon up over the sea; a bulbous moon, which sprouts in the soiled indigo sky, and spills bright winking petals of light on the quivering black water.\n\n– Sylvia Plath\n\nOur age not only does not have a very sharp eye for the almost imperceptible intrusions of grace, it no longer has much feeling for the nature of the violences which precede and follow them.\n\n– Flannery O’Connor\n\nHe was not dogmatic enough to believe that you must\n\nhave boards and footlights to be within the theater; he carried the stage with him in his heart.\n\n– Isak Dinesen\n\nIs no one inspired by our present picture of the universe? This value of science remains unsung by singers: you are reduced to hearing not a song or poem, but an evening lecture about it. This is not yet a scientific age.\n\n– Richard Feynman\n\nThe first poets were gods. Poetry began with the bicameral mind. The god-side of our ancient mentality, at least in a certain period of history, usually or perhaps always spoke in verse. This means that most men at one time, throughout the day, were hearing poetry (of a sort) composed and spoken within their own minds.\n\n– Julian Jaynes\n\nWhen we manage a flash of mercy for someone we don’t like, especially a truly awful person, including ourselves, we experience a great spiritual moment, a new point of view that can make us gasp. It gives us the chance to rediscover something both old and original, the sweet child in us who, all evidence to the contrary, was not killed off, but just put in the drawer. I realize now how desperately, how grievously, I have needed the necessary mercy to experience self-respect. It is what a lot of us were so frantic for all along, and we never knew it. We’ve tried almost suicidally for our whole lives to shake it from the boughs of the material world’s trees. But it comes from within, from love, from the flow of the universe; from inside the cluttered drawer.\n\n– Anne Lamott, Hallelujah Anyway: Rediscovering Mercy\n\nThe world did not begin with me\n\nit will not end with me\n\nI am one pulsebeat in the throbbing river\n\n– Octavio Paz\n\nThis activist, conservative majority has already dealt significant blows to the power of the executive branch to regulate wetlands, securities and student loans. And extremist judges are already attacking the authority of the FDA, including its approval of critical abortion medications like mifepristone. If the Court proceeds to overrule Chevron, this could upend the field entirely, and we would enter an entirely new and uncharted world of conservative judicial activism.\n\n– Jay Kuo\n\nTimes without number I have asked myself how it could have come to that. Now, from a distance of thirty years, I see the answer clearly: little by little.\n\n– Mary Lawson\n\nIt’s much easier to integrate a lunch counter than it is to guarantee an annual income, for instance, to get rid of poverty for Negroes and all poor people. It’s much easier to integrate a bus than it is to make genuine integration a reality and quality education a reality in our schools. It’s much easier to integrate even a public park than it is to get rid of slums.\n\n– Martin Luther King\n\nI believe in progress through movement. In moving you find the answers, or at least I do. I didn’t know what the [Harold] Pinter plays meant until I was in rehearsal and then in performance: I didn’t spend time reading theories or looking for clues. The answers come from doing. With plays, with life, with friends, with children–you keep moving and doing and the answers come. Or they don’t come. But you’re moving and learning. You’re of use.\n\n– Frances Sternhagen\n\nThe real difference between God and human beings, he thought, was that God cannot stand continuance. No sooner has he created a season of a year, or a time of the day, than he wishes for something quite different, and sweeps it all away. No sooner was one a young man, and happy at that, than the nature of things would rush one into marriage, martyrdom or old age. And human beings cleave to the existing state of things. All their lives they are striving to hold the moment fast….Their art itself is nothing but the attempt to catch by all means the one particular moment, one light, the momentary beauty of one woman or one flower, and make it everlasting.\n\n– Karen Blixen\n\nBrother! I’m not despondent and I haven’t lost heart. Life is everywhere, life is in us ourselves, not outside. There will be people by my side, and to be a human being among people and to remain one forever, no matter in what circumstances, not to grow despondent and not to lose heart — that’s what life is all about, that’s its task. I have come to recognize that. The idea has entered my flesh and blood. Yes its true! The head that created, lived the highest life of art, which recognized and got used to the exalted needs of the spirit, that head is already cut off from my shoulders. There was a memory and images created and not yet embodied by me.\n\n– Fëdor Mikhailovich Dostoevskiy\n\nThe knowing self is partial in all its guises, never finished, whole, simply there and original; it is always constructed and stitched together imperfectly, and therefore able to join with another, to see together without claiming to be another. Here is the promise of objectivity: a scientific knower seeks the subject position, not of identity, but of objectivity, that is, partial connection.\n\n– Donna Haraway, Situated Knowledges\n\nTending my inner garden went splendidly this winter. Suddenly to be healed again and aware that the very ground of my being — my mind and spirit — was given time and space in which to go on growing; and there came from my heart a radiance I had not felt so strongly for a long time… You tell me how you are able to feel fully alive every moment of the day and that your inner life is brimming over; you write in the knowledge that what you have, if one looks at it squarely, outweighs and cancels all possible privations and losses that may later come along. It is precisely this that was borne in upon me more conclusively than ever before as I worked away during the long Winter months: that the stages by which life has become impoverished correspond with those earlier times when excesses of wealth were the accustomed measure. What, then, is there to fear? Only forgetting! But you and I, around us and in us, we have so much in store to help us remember!\n\n– Rainer Maria Rilke\n\nThe kind of hope I often think about I understand above all as a state of mind, not a state of the world. Either we have hope within us or we don’t; it is a dimension of the soul; it’s not essentially dependent on some particular observation of the world or estimate of the situation. Hope is not prognostication. It is an orientation of the spirit, an orientation of the heart; it transcends the world that is immediately experienced, and is anchored somewhere beyond its horizons. Hope, in this deep and powerful sense, is not the same as joy that things are going well, or willingness to invest in enterprises that are obviously heading for success, but, rather, an ability to work for something that is good, not just because it stands a chance to succeed. The more unpropitious the situation in which we demonstrate hope, the deeper the hope is. Hope is definitely not the same thing as optimism. It is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty that something makes sense, regardless of how it turns out. In short, I think that the deepest and most important form of hope, the only one that can keep us above water and urge us to good works, and the only true source of the breathtaking dimension of the human spirit and its efforts, is something we get, as it were, from “elsewhere”. It is also this hope, above all, which gives us the strength to live and continually to try new things, even in conditions that seem hopeless as ours do, here and now.\n\n– Vaclav Havel\n\nIntellectual, spiritual, and artistic initiative is as dangerous to totalitarianism as the gangster initiative of the mob, and both are more dangerous than mere political opposition. The consistent persecution of every higher form of intellectual activity by the new mass leaders springs from more than their natural resentment against everything they cannot understand. Total domination does not allow for free initiative in any field of life, for any activity that is not entirely predictable.\n\nTotalitarianism in power invariably replaces all first-rate talents, regardless of their sympathies, with those crackpots and fools whose lack of intelligence and creativity is still the best guarantee of their loyalty.\n\n– Hannah Arendt, On Totalitarianism\n\nTotalitarian regimes seem to have an intuitive awareness that it becomes hard for people to change after a certain age, which is why so much effort is made to indoctrinate the young from an early age.\n\n– Norman Doidge\n\nReading is escape, and the opposite of escape; it’s a way to make contact with reality after a day of making things up, and it’s a way of making contact with someone else’s imagination after a day that’s all too real.\n\n– Nora Ephron\n\nI don’t think anyone really knows how a story takes shape.\n\n– Elena Ferrante\n\nI’m so compelled by fiction, too, because it pushes me much more quickly and readily than nonfiction to construct work that’s entirely voice, and not in marriage to another person’s story or voice.\n\n– Hilton Als\n\nJung did not believe that authentic religiosity was expressed in these peak experiences. Rather he advised people to turn towards their fears, much as the mystics welcomed the dark night of the soul. This shadow is experienced as a foe, but it is really a friend because it contains clues as to what the individual lacks, rejects and distrusts.\n\n– Mark Vernon\n\nArtistic originality has only its own self to copy.\n\n– Vladimir Nabokov\n\nFrom the time, some tens or hundreds of thousands of years ago, that language invaded and colonized our cerebrums, we have increasingly lost touch with the reality of things. Reality has been replaced with relation, a mapping of things-as-they-are to things-as-we-believe-them-to-be.\n\n– Mark Pesce\n\nIn a holographic universe there are no boxes to think outside of.\n\n– Nassim Haramein\n\nHe had developed a superstitious fear of the instant, that tiny hole through which all the time available to human beings must pass.\n\n– César Aira\n\nThere are a few things in life so beautiful they hurt: swimming in the ocean while it rains, reading alone in empty libraries, the sea of stars that appear when you’re miles away from the neon lights of the city, bars after 2am, walking in the wilderness, all the phases of the moon, the things we do not know about the universe, and you.\n\n– Beau Taplin\n\nThere are beautiful wild forces within us. Let them turn the mills inside and fill sacks that feed even heaven.\n\n– St. Francis of Assis\n\nThe gods are true in the way poetry is true.\n\n– Joseph Campbell\n\nDr. Jung once told me that any man who comes into your consulting room will either be 21 or 45 years of age no matter his chronological age because his problems will be that he can’t get into life or can’t get out of life. Those are the only two problems a man ever has.\n\n– Robert A. Johnson\n\nIn your career, the most valuable currency is not how much you know. It’s how well you learn.\n\nIn a stable world, success depended on building expertise. In a changing world, it hinges on evolving expertise.\n\nPotential is no longer defined by ability. It’s a function of agility.\n\n– Adam Grant\n\nMaybe we need to change the word Buddhism to Buddhist practice, or Buddhist-inspired practice. Then it has to be engaged, because it’s about our meeting with the world and in the world and our embodiment of the world.\n\n– Stephen Fulder\n\nthis minute perhaps i am above the stars, with a thousand systems round about me, looking forward into a vast abyss, and losing my whole comprehension in the boundless space of creation; the next moment i am below all trifles\n\n– alexander pope, letters\n\na good proverb the devonshire people have: walk fast in snow, in frost walk slow, and still as you go, tread on your toe: when frost and snow are both together, sit by the fire and spare shoe leather.\n\n– jonathan swift, letters\n\nin these deep solitudes and awful cells, where heav’nly-pensive contemplation dwells and ever-musing melancholy reigns; what means this tumult in a vestal’s veins? why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat why feels my heart its long-forgotten heat?\n\nyet, yet i love!\n\n– alexander pope\n\nSometimes it is different\n\nin my head than when\n\nI write it out,\n\nthe old monk admitted.\n\n– The Old Monk\n\nPhotographers, insurance salesmen, and funeral directors are the worst forms of life.\n\n– Elizabeth Bishop\n\npassages which, when I wrote them, were so colorless in comparison with my thought, so complicated and opaque in comparison with my harmonious and transparent vision, so full of gaps which I had not managed to fill\n\n– Marcel Proust\n\nMy contention is this: more people know Dublin is on the Liffey than Belfast is on the Langan.\n\n– Richard Coles\n\nThe ancient philosophers, Chinese, Hindu, Persian, and Greek, were a class than which none has been poorer in outward riches, none so rich inward.\n\n– Henry David Thoreau\n\nSometimes I tremble like a storm-swept flower,\n\nAnd seek to hide my tortured soul from thee,\n\nBowing my head in deep humility\n\nBefore the silent thunder of thy power.\n\n– Claude McKay\n\nLovingkindness or love is not an emotion from the presence of a lovable person, but a heart quality making no distinction among beings.\n\n– Ayya Khema\n\nOld traps disappear and new ones emerge. Safe spots become impassable… That’s the Zone… It is what we made it with our condition.\n\n– Andrei Tarkovsky\n\nwolf moon\n\nI decide to become\n\nvegetarian\n\n– @AdLibby1\n\nI believe that life is hateful when you simply accept the natural order of things: When you submit. We must contribute. We must anticipate. Do you remember how glorious life was on Friday afternoons? How grisly on Sunday nights? You know what I mean. Expectation. The glorious, colorful life comes to those who expect it, dream it. Remember how grand life was when the circus or the fair was imminent? Colors changed. More dramatic than the change of seasons was the change of attitudes. So expect the circus, always. Be the circus.\n\n– Tennessee Williams\n\nThe dwelling is intimate, immediate, a resonant chamber, a mirror of the self, opening up in infinite perspectives, depth, and reflection. Soul, body, and dwelling are but expansions and projections of each other. For the house is not merely walls, doors, and windows, but a doorway to things beyond, a ‘capacity’ of the senses and spirit. Finally, there is no distinction between outward and inward. We dwell in the home; the home dwells in us.\n\n– Anne Troutman\n\nThere was a smell of Time in the air tonight. He smiled and turned the fancy in his mind. There was a thought. What did time smell like? Like dust and clocks and people. And if you wondered what Time sounded like it, it sounded like water running in a dark cave and voices crying and dirt dropping down upon hollow box lids, and rain. And, going further, what did Time look like?\n\nTime look like snow dropping silently into a black room or it looked like a silent film in an ancient theater, 100 billion faces falling like those New Year balloons, down and down into nothing. That was how Time smelled and looked and sounded. And tonight – Tomas shoved a hand into the wind outside the truck – tonight you could almost taste time.\n\n– Ray Bradbury\n\nW Edwards Deming, the man credited with almost single-handedly transforming the economy of post-war Japan, once said that a bad system will beat a good person every time. It wasn’t an attempt to get people to give up trying – it was a attempt to get people to understand the importance of the system and the futility of trying to focus on blaming people for failures.\n\n– Fix The System Problem, Not The People Problem\n\nSource: paulitaylor.com\n\nSt. Cyril of Jerusalem, in instructing catechumens, wrote: “The dragon sits by the side of the road, watching those who pass. Beware lest he devour you. We go to the Father of Souls, but it is necessary to pass by the dragon.” No matter what form the dragon may take, it is of this mysterious passage past him, or into his jaws, that stories of any depth will always be concerned to tell, and this being the case, it requires considerable courage at any time, in any country, not to turn away from the storyteller.\n\n– Flannery O’Connor\n\nEvery record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.\n\n– George Orwell, 1984\n\nTo progress in life you must give up the things you do not like. Give up doing the things that you do not like to do. You must find the things that you do like. The things that are acceptable to your mind.\n\n– Agnes Martin\n\nThere is among them an abundance of the vengeful disguised as judges, who constantly bear the word “justice” in their mouths like poisonous spittle, always with pursed lips, always ready to spit upon all who are not discontented but go their own way in good spirits…The will of the weak to represent some form of superiority, their instinct for devious paths to tyranny over the healthy – where can it not be discovered, this will to power of the weakest!\n\n– Nietzsche\n\nWork hard in silence, let your success be your noise.\n\n– Frank Ocean\n\nIn order to realize our dreams, we must decide to wake up.\n\n– Josephine Baker\n\nStudy your craft and know who you are and what’s special about you.

In reality, my distrust of Plato is fundamental. I find him so very much astray from all the deepest instincts of the Hellenes, so steeped in moral prejudices, so pre-existently Christian…\n\nPlato is a coward in the face of reality—consequently, he takes refuge in the ideal.\n\n– Nietzsche\n\nYour life is not going to be the same while you are writing.\n\n– Chinua Achebe\n\nEverybody is dealing with how much of their own aliveness they can bear and how much they need to anesthetize themselves.\n\n– Adam Phillips\n\nIt really is\n\nall one poem,\n\nthe old monk told\n\nthe poet.\n\nFigure it out.\n\n– The Old Monk\n\nEvery poet\n\nneeds a drum,\n\neven if it’s just\n\na trash can,\n\nthe old monk said.\n\n– The Old Monk\n\nI’m writing to save my own life.

One afternoon the bus was late with the children. My imagination was like a storm. I stood at the road, and I couldn’t get rid of all the terrible pictures. So I started thanking God for this fear, because it meant I love them so much. The sun was shining on the snow and pines, and I stood down there, thinking of what it would be like not to have that fear; not to love anyone so much you couldn’t imagine living on the earth without them […] I looked at all that beauty around me and I was grateful. I was still afraid, but the worst of it went out of me..\n\n– Andre Dubus\n\nAuschwitz is outside of us, but it is all around us, in the air. The plague has died away, but the infection still lingers and it would be foolish to deny it. Rejection of human solidarity, obtuse and cynical indifference to the suffering of others, abdication of the intellect and of moral sense to the principle of authority, and above all, at the root of everything, a sweeping tide of cowardice, a colossal cowardice which masks “Itself as warring virtue, love of country and faith in an idea.\n\n– Primo Levi, If This Is a Man\n\nBohm believes that our almost universal tendency to fragment the world and ignore the dynamic interconnectedness of all things is responsible for many of our problems, not only in science but in our lives and our society as well. For instance, we believe we can extract the valuable parts of the earth without affecting the whole. We believe it is possible to treat parts of our body and not be concerned with the whole. We believe we can deal with various problems in our society, such as crime, poverty, and drug addiction, without addressing the problems in our society as a whole, and so on. In his writings Bohm argues passionately that our current way of fragmenting the world into parts not only doesn’t work, but may even lead to our extinction.\n\n– Michael Talbot\n\nThe type of mind that can understand good fiction is not necessarily the educated mind, but it is at all times the kind of mind that is willing to have its sense of mystery deepened by contact with reality, and its sense of reality deepened by contact with mystery.\n\n– Flannery O’Connor\n\nIn the first place you can be so absolutely honest and so absolutely wrong at the same time that I think it is better to be a combination of cautious and polite\n\n– Flannery O’Connor\n\nAll things share the same breath – the beast, the tree, the man.

The beaten earth appears defeated and dead, but it only appears so…the desert, the dry and sun-lashed desert, is a good school in which to observe the cleverness and the infinite variety of survival under pitiless opposition.

We often use the language of soul phenomena without realizing we are doing so. We speak of ‘being in tune’ with someone, or ‘being on the same wavelength’. Something about a connection with another person just feels right. It clicks.\n\n– Robert Sardello\n\nIn Buddha’s opinion, to train in staying open and curious—to train in dissolving our assumptions and beliefs—is the best use of our human lives.\n\n– Pema Chodron\n\nForgive and forget those who have caused difficulties, viewing them as teachers about your own reactions, and make them your friends.\n\n– Ayya Khema\n\nAttachment and loss, attachment and loss — this is the human story. We lose parts of ourselves as we adapt to the demands of the world.\n\n– James Hollis\n\nEverybody will affirm your “right” to set boundaries– in the abstract. Until you set a boundary that inconveniences them.\n\nThen their opinion often shifts to, “you only have a ‘right’ to boundaries I understand or agree with.”\n\nIt’ll happen. Don’t let it get in your head.\n\n– Dr. Glenn Patrick Doyle\n\nSeems like the only thing accelerating is the decline of the US.\n\n– @antonio_paglino\n\nTrying Too Hard to Write a Poem Sitting on the Beach\n\nby Philip Whalen\n\nPlanted among driftwood\n\nI watch the tide go out\n\nIt pulls the sundown with it\n\n& across this scene & against the wind\n\nMan on a motorbike white crash-helmet\n\nHis young son rides the gas tank before him\n\nSlows down for the creek mouth\n\n& not too fast up the beach north\n\nFlat dull whistle buoy heard again\n\nand though the wind is right the bell buoy is inaudible\n\nFat seagull picks at a new hake skeleton\n\nChoosily—not hungry walks away\n\nReturns a moment later,\n\nRoom for a few more bites inside\n\nHere comes a family of five\n\nMan prodding with a stick whatever the children test\n\nwith their fingers\n\nMama is bundled up naturally cold & yellow plastic bucket\n\nComplaining a little “. . . kind of a long way from the car . . .”\n\nThe children explore ahead the beach goes on forever & they\n\nWill see it all this evening they aren’t tired\n\nMotorbike man coming back slows down for them\n\n& for the creek mouth\n\nFog joined into fat clouds cover the sun\n\nMove south stretching rivers & islands of blue\n\nFine moving sheets & shafts of light on the water horizon\n\nI’m not making it, I’m cold, I go into the house.\n\nwhat will poems become\n\nwhen the breath departs\n\n– Zbigniew Herbert\n\nA daily practice of seiza helps nurture the nembutsu spirit to counter the turbulence of this world and the countless blind passions with which we run amok.\n\n– Reverend Miki Nakura\n\nIn moments when attention is strong, because we deliberately cultivate awareness of inner states as they arise and pass away in the mind with wise or careful attention, we are far more able to notice what is going on.\n\n– Andrew Olendzki\n\nIf your goal is to not,\n\nyou miss a lot of do,\n\nthe old monk told them.\n\n– The Old Monk\n\nI love snow, and all forms / Of the radiant frost; / I love waves, and winds, and storms, / Everything almost / Which is Nature’s, and may be / Untainted by man’s misery.\n\n– Percy Bysshe Shelley\n\nIf we follow the history of a neurosis with attention, we regularly find a critical moment when some problem emerged that was evaded.\n\n– CG Jung\n\nIf they’re here—all females in a winter hive—they’re clustered together inside (an oak tree), queen at the heart of their sisterhood. The fine, transparent wings they beat hard in summer’s heat—a constant buzzing fan to keep the hive from cooking—they hold, now, folded and still. The tiny muscles to which those wings are attached shiver. One honey bee shivering her flight muscles does not make much heat. But twenty thousand, huddled together, shivering, can keep the queen and the colony’s honey supply at their core at a tropical ninety-two degrees Fahrenheit, even as blizzard winds, inches away, flail the trunk.\n\n– Gayle Boss\n\nIt is usual to speak of the Fascist objective as the “beehive state”, which does grave injustice to bees. A world of rabbits ruled by stoats would be nearer the mark.\n\n– George Orwell\n\nMy tunes often deal with a moral crisis. I often feel myself a part of such a crisis and try to relate it in song. There’s a line in a poem I wrote that sums this up perfectly: ‘My betrayals are so fresh they still come with explanations.’\n\n– Leonard Cohen\n\nHuman presence is a creative and turbulent sacrament, a visible sign of invisible grace…Friendship is the sweet grace that liberates us to approach, recognize, and inhabit this adventure.\n\n– John O’Donahue\n\nOne knew of places in ancient Greece where the way led down to the underworld. Our waking existence likewise is like a land which, at certain hidden points, leads down into the underworld—a land full of inconspicuous. places from which dreams arise. All day long, we pass them by, but no sooner has sleep come than we are eagerly groping our way back to lose ourselves in the dark corridors.\n\n– Walter Benjamin\n\nYou do not know how much they mean to me, my friends,\n\nAnd how, how rare and strange it is, to find\n\nIn a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends,\n\n(For indeed I do not love it … you knew? you are not blind! How keen you are!)\n\nTo find a friend who has these qualities,\n\nWho has, and gives\n\nThose qualities upon which friendship lives.\n\nHow much it means that I say this to you-\n\nWithout these friendships-life, what cauchemar!\n\n– T.S. Eliot\n\nI read that beauty has historically demanded replication. We make more of anything we find aesthetically pleasing, whether it’s a vase, a painting, a chalice, a poem. We reproduce it in order to keep it, extend it through space and time. To gaze at what pleases—a fresco, a peach-red mountain range, a boy, the mole on his jaw—is, in itself, replication—the image prolonged in the eye, making more of it, making it last. Staring into the mirror, I replicate myself into a future where I might not exist.\n\n– Ocean Vuong\n\nThings have gone rapidly downhill since the Age of Enlightenment, for, once this petty reasoning mind, which cannot endure any paradoxes, is awakened, no sermon on earth can keep it down. A new task then arises: to lift this still undeveloped mind step by step to a higher level and to increase the number of persons who have at least some inkling of the scope of paradoxical truth…. We simply do not understand any more what is meant by the paradoxes contained in dogma;…\n\n– Carl Jung\n\n…and there, in the background, the brite spring sky’s sediment had sunk to a dark band of blue. Ah, it mesmerized me…like the snow had done. All the woe of the words, “I am” seemed dissolved there, painlessly, peacefully. Hae-Joo announced, “The Ocean.”\n\n– David Mitchell, Cloud Atlas\n\nWhatever your eye falls on – for it will fall on what you love – will lead you to the questions of your life, the questions that are incumbent upon you to answer, because that is how the mind works in concert with the eye. The things of this world draw us where we need to go.\n\n– Mary Rose O’Reilley\n\nDeep peace of the Son of Peace to you, who, swift as the wave and pervasive as the air, quiet as the earth and shining like a star, breathes into us His Peace and His Spirit. Deep peace of the Son of Peace to you.\n\n– Gaelic blessing\n\nDo not let me hear\n\nOf the wisdom of old men, but rather of their folly,\n\nTheir fear of fear and frenzy, their fear of possession,\n\nOf belonging to another, or to others, or to God.\n\nThe only wisdom we can hope to acquire\n\nIs the wisdom of humility: humility is endless.\n\n– T.S. Eliot\n\nSometimes a mortal feels in himself Nature–not his Father but his Mother stirs within him, and he becomes immortal with her immortality. From time to time she claims kinship with us, and some globule from her veins steals up into our own.\n\n– Henry David Thoreau\n\nAlong a parabola life like a rocket flies, Mainly in darkness, now and then on a rainbow…\n\n– Andrei Voznesensky\n\nthe\n\nsame thing may be said for all of us—that we\n\ndo not admire what\n\nwe cannot understand.\n\n– Marianne Moore\n\nWhen a novel is divided into named parts, I almost always miss the first part’s name, because I just flip to the first page of text and start there. It’s not until I hit Part Two that I even realize there was a Part One. Always makes me stop and reconsider what I’ve just read.\n\n– Matt Bell\n\nLove letters, we should be able to draw them, paint them, shout them\n\n– Colette\n\nimagination, then, as manifested in art, is a perceptive act; the perception of analogies and correspondences, whereby things which in ordinary consciousness led a separate existence are fused into unity ..\n\n– William Blake\n\nIn the center of an empire, you can think of your experience as universal.\n\n– Margaret Atwood\n\nevery day I grow more convinced that ‘centre-left’ parties are an elaborate psyop whose main purpose is to trick people into believing that they live in democratic societies.\n\n– Ryan Ruby\n\nSometimes I see something so moving I know I’m not supposed to linger. See it and leave. If you stay too long, you wear out the wordless shock. Love it and trust it and leave.\n\n– Don DeLillo\n\nWe must be tender\n\nwith all budding things.\n\n– W.B. Yeats\n\nStop trying. Stop forcing\n\nreality. Learn the mystery\n\nof surrender and trust,\n\nand then it will be done\n\nunto you, through you,\n\nwith you, in you and very\n\nofter, in spite of you.\n\n– Richard Rohr\n\nPerhaps noticing how often others misread us may remind us how wrong we usually are in our readings of others. The beauty of getting to know others is, surely, getting to see how little we’ll ever know of them–and how much we can count on anyone we care about to surprise us.\n\n– Pico Iyer\n\nMost of wars or military coups or invasions are done in the name of democracy against democracy.\n\n– Eduardo Galeano\n\nA book can teach you, a conversation can assure you, a poem can seduce you, a genius can inspire you but only you can save yourself.\n\n– Anthony Anaxagorou\n\nOF MERE BEING\n\nThe palm at the end of the mind,\n\nBeyond the last thought, rises\n\nIn the bronze decor.\n\nA gold-feathered bird\n\nSings in the palm, without human meaning,\n\nWithout human feeling, a foreign song.\n\nYou know then that it is not the reason\n\nThat makes us happy or unhappy.\n\nThe bird sings. Its feathers shine.\n\nThe palm stands on the edge of space.\n\nThe wind moves slowly in the branches.\n\nThe bird’s fire-fangled feathers dangle down.\n\n– Wallace Stevens\n\nwhen we are old & our hearts have beat within us, let\n\nus go back, & when we have buried our loves, & shed\n\nour bodies piece by piece, & when we have danced\n\n& broken our shoes, & danced, let us go back,\n\nwhen we have gone mad, & when we have shut\n\nthe doors, dismantled our eyes & rifles, let us go back,\n\nwhen we have drunk the wine & licked our lips\n\n& put our tongues to the inside of the green glass bottle\n\n& laid down our bodies old as trees, streets, let us go back,\n\nwhen we have told our stories & forgotten our stories,\n\n& set the tables & made the beds, let us go back,\n\n& received other bodies into our bodies, let us go,\n\nwhen we have entered, & opened,\n\n& opened our mouths, let us go back,\n\n[…] when the poem has been sung,\n\nwhen the strings & tambourines,\n\nwhen all the birds have gathered at the window, let us go,\n\nlet us go back there, let us go back\n\n– Aracelis Girmay\n\nWhat is precious\n\ninside us does not\n\ncare to be known\n\nby the mind\n\nin ways that diminish\n\nits presence.\n\n– David Whyte\n\nThere’s no separation between the experience of the central nervous system and the function of memory in the body. The experience of the past has been fixed and retained by the neurons firing at that precise moment. Every muscle, nerve, and tissue participating in that experience has been affected and will ‘remember’ in its own fashion.\n\n– Stokes and Whiteside\n\nNo art is sunk in the self, but rather, in art the self becomes self-forgetful in order to meet the demands of the thing seen and the thing being made.\n\n– Flannery O’Connor\n\nYou can be a shoemaker or a poet, but when you really think about it, it becomes no longer a task or a job but a vocation that is invested with a spiritual intention.\n\n– Ocean Vuong\n\nI’ve begun to grow fatigued. I’ve learned that writing poems is possible and possibility diminishes exploration.\n\n– Jan-Henry Gray\n\nA newborn baby has a powerful\n\neffect on character. But so does a\n\ntoddler. A child. A preteen. A\n\nteenager. A mother changes with\n\nevery stage. Some stages are\n\nwithin a mother’s skill set. Some\n\nstages are like being told to scale\n\na cliff using a rope attached to\n\nnothing.\n\n– Louise Erdrich\n\nEverything we write is, in a sense, translated from another language, from the chatter we hear inside our head, translated from that interior babble … into (what we hope will be) the clearer, more articulate language on the page.\n\n– Francine Prose\n\nTo learn to read is to light a fire; every syllable that is spelled out is a spark.\n\n– Victor Hugo\n\nmy adult life lover states\n\non what will end:\n\nLibraries\n\nBirds\n\nRetirement\n\n– Eunsong Kim\n\nSome days\n\nthe sky is too bright.\n\n– Kelli Russell Agodon\n\nThe Mona Lisa will survive.\n\nThe question is:\n\nWill we?\n\n– @ClimateDefiance\n\nI’m going back to Kansas City.\n\n– Jericho Brown\n\nTime, friends, is an unruly\n\nboss. Rhubarb and garbage,\n\nrhubarb and garbage. The Dark\n\nAges never really went away,\n\nthey just got sent to their room\n\nto think about what they’d\n\ndone.\n\n– Andrea Cohen\n\nMy holy of holies are the human body, health, intelligence, talent, inspiration, love, and the most absolute freedom, freedom from despotism and lies.\n\n– Anton Chekhov\n\nI am the farthest star\n\nI am the cold of dawn\n\nI am the roaring of the rain\n\nI am the glitter on the crust of the snow\n\nI am the long track of the moon in a lake.\n\n– N. Scott Momaday\n\nLISTEN TO YOUR LIFE\n\nIf I were called upon to state in a few words the essence of everything\n\nI was trying to say, it would be something like this: Listen to your life.\n\nSee it for the fathomless mystery that it is.\n\nIn the boredom and pain of it no less than in the excitement and gladness:\n\nTouch, taste, smell your way to the holy and hidden heart of it,\n\nbecause in the last analysis all moments are key moments, and life itself is grace.\n\n– Frederick Buechner\n\nReal faith means holding ourselves open to the unconditional mystery which we encounter in every sphere of our life which cannot be compressed in any formula.\n\n– Martin Buber\n\nSome religious authorities have tried to recognize the divinity of Christ while ignoring the divinity of humanity. They have tried to make Christ different from what may be called human; but by doing so they have covered the main truth that religion had to give to the world, which was that divinity resides in humanity, that divinity is the outcome of humanity, and that humanity is the flower in the heart of which divinity was born as a seed. It is the development of humanity that culminates in divinity; thus Christ is the example of the culmination of humanity. It would be hiding the greatest human virtue to hide this secret, which is the key to the mystery of the whole universe.\n\n– Hazrat Inayat Khan\n\nIf a little dreaming is dangerous, the cure for it is not to dream less, but to dream more, to dream all the time.\n\n– Marcel Proust\n\nI’m not interested to believe in something, but to understand the people who believe.\n\n– László Krasznahorkai\n\nHealing does not require that you master the unreasonable side of your reason. Nor does healing require inner perfection of any order. A common trait shared by people who have healed is that they cease being unreasonable in ways that no longer matter in the greater scheme of life. Against the scale of life or death, how important is winning an argument? How important is holding a grudge? How important is anything other than how well we love others, how deeply we regard the value of the gift of life, and what we do with our life that makes this world a better place?\n\n– Caroline Myss\n\nWork on reversing your caught-up, self-important attitude and remain relaxed in this process. Instead of always being caught in a prison of self-absorption, look out and express gentleness to all things. Then just relax.\n\n– Pema Chödrön\n\nMy heart has joined the Thousand, for my friend stopped running today.\n\n– Richard Adams\n\nThe children should learn to develop the sounds from the external objects and from the way their own feelings are related to them. Everything should be derived from the feeling for language. In the word “roll” the child should really feel: r,o,l,l. It is the same thing for every word.\n\n– Rudolf Steiner\n\nAt first she thought the writing would be easy. She was extremely confident in her ability to dream, to imagine, and she supposed that expressing her dreams in words, in writing, would be entirely natural, like drawing breath. She had read widely from the time she was a child, and she knew how to recognize something that was well written. She admired certain lines and passages so much that she had taken complete possession of them and committed them to memory. She could recite “The Gettysburg Address” and “The Twenty-Third Psalm.” She could recite “Jabberwocky” and Emily Dickinson’s “Further in summer that the birds” and Wallace Stevens’s “Sunday Morning.” She knew by heart the final paragraph of Joyce’s “The Dead,” and if challenged she could say in whole the parts of both Romeo and Juliet. And she knew many Kiowa stories and many long prayers in Navajo. These were not feats of memory in the ordinary sense; it was simply that she attended to these things so closely that they became a part of her most personal experience. She had assumed them, appropriated them to her being.\n\nBut to write! She discovered that was something else again.\n\n– N. Scott Momaday\n\nWe need a definition of spirit and spirituality that is separate from religion and religious education,” writes Amelia Richardson Dress. ‘Spirit is the thing within us that makes us us. Spirituality is the way we connect our ‘inner us’ to everything else, including other people’s inner ‘usness.’ This understanding helps us think creatively about how to approach spirituality while respecting a child’s home culture. It also enables us to clearly identify our goal, in order to determine if we are achieving it.\n\nWhile it is extremely difficult to measure the ‘spirit’ of a child in the same way we might measure physical or academic growth, there are indicators of spirituality that we can look for in our classrooms and the children. “It is my belief that the thing which we should cultivate in our teachers is more the spirit than the mechanical skill of the scientist.\n\n– Maria Montessori\n\ncontinue practicing until you see yourself in the cruelest person on Earth, in the child starving, in the political prisoner. Practice until you recognize yourself in everyone in the supermarket, on the street corner, in a concentration camp, on a leaf, in a dewdrop. Meditate until you see yourself in a speck of dust in a distant galaxy. See and listen with the whole of your being.\n\nIf you are fully present, the rain of Dharma will water the deepest seeds in your consciousness, and tomorrow, while you are washing the dishes or looking at the blue sky, that seed will spring forth, and love and understanding will appear as a beautiful flower.\n\n– Thich Nhat Hanh\n\nHigh high in the hills , high in a pine tree bed.\n\nShe’s tracing the wind with that old hand, counting the clouds with that old chant,\n\nThree geese in a flock\n\none flew east\n\none flew west\n\none flew over the cuckoo’s nest\n\n– Ken Kesey\n\nMay my heart hold the earth all the days of my life.\n\nAnd when I am gone to the farther camps, may my name sound on the green hills,\n\nand may the cedar smoke that I have breathed drift on the canyon walls and among the branches of living trees.\n\nMay birds of many colors encircle the soil where my steps have been placed,\n\nand may the deer, the lion, and the bear of the mountains be touched by the blessings that have touched me.\n\nMay I chant the praises of the wild and may my spirit range on the wind forever.\n\n– The Earth Keepers, N. Scott Momaday\n\nRobots are not cute. If you see a robot, smash it. It’s us or them.\n\n– D. A. Powell\n\nI could tell of the splintered sun. I could\n\nArticulate the night sky, had I words.\n\n– N. Scott Momaday\n\nThe agonized ego is a ring of defense around nothing.\n\n– Alan Watts\n\nPROBABILITY\n\nMost coincidents are not\n\nmiraculous, but way more\n\ncommon than we think –\n\nit’s the shiver\n\nof noticing being\n\ncentral in a sequence\n\nof events\n\nthat makes so much\n\nseem wild and rare –\n\nbecause what if it wasn’t?\n\nAstonishment’s nothing\n\nwithout your consent.\n\n– Lia Purpura\n\nDAYS\n\nEach one is a gift, no doubt,\n\nmysteriously placed in your waking hand\n\nor set upon your forehead\n\nmoments before you open your eyes.\n\nToday begins cold and bright,\n\nthe ground heavy with snow\n\nand the thick masonry of ice,\n\nthe sun glinting off the turrets of clouds.\n\nThrough the calm eye of the window\n\neverything is in its place\n\nbut so precariously\n\nthis day might be resting somehow\n\non the one before it,\n\nall the days of the past stacked high\n\nlike the impossible tower of dishes\n\nentertainers used to build on stage.\n\nNo wonder you find yourself\n\nperched on the top of a tall ladder\n\nhoping to add one more.\n\nJust another Wednesday\n\nyou whisper,\n\nthen holding your breath,\n\nplace this cup on yesterday’s saucer\n\nwithout the slightest clink.\n\n– Billy Collins\n\nWhat is homeland? To hold on to your memory – that is homeland.\n\n– Mahmoud Darwish\n\nTo An Aged Bear\n\nHold hard this infirmity.\n\nIt defines you. You are old.\n\nNow fix yourself in summer,\n\nIn thickets of ripe berries,\n\nAnd venture toward the ridge\n\nWhere you were born. Await there\n\nThe setting sun. Be alive\n\nTo that old conflagration\n\nOne more time. Mortality\n\nIs your shadow and your shade.\n\nTranslate yourself to spirit;\n\nBe present on your journey.\n\nKeep to the trees and waters.\n\nBe the singing of the soil.\n\n– N. Scott Momaday\n\nThere was a time when “man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent,” this New World, “commensurate to his capacity for wonder.” I would strive with all my strength to give that sense of wonder to those who will come after me.\n\n– N. Scott Momaday\n\nWhat are you thinking about?\n\nI am thinking of an early summer. I am thinking of wet hills in the rain Pouring water.\n\n– Jack Spicer\n\nPart of the maturation is to realize that you don’t just give up the negative perceptions, you give up the positive ones, too. You give up the whole framework that was used to tell you who and what you are.\n\n– Adyashanti\n\nDon’t tell them too much about your soul.\n\nThey’re waiting for just that.\n\n– Jack Kerouac\n\n… to be under another\n\nappearance … that,\n\nI think, is poetry.\n\n– Sean O’Riordan\n\nit is not easy to depart\n\nthis cool green garden\n\nfor a dusty old road\n\n– Basho\n\nOptimists write badly. (Valéry) But pessimists do not write.\n\n– Maurice Blanchot\n\nOne thing Jung is taught [in journey described in Red Book] in a hundred different ways, is the utter madness hiding at every turn behind reasonableness and reason. He is even shown how reason is a poison that has slowly infected and destroyed us all.\n\n– Peter Kingsley\n\nIf you enlarge a detail in a picture, in a painting, you produce another painting,\n\n– Roland Barthes\n\nI always know what is coming next—the question. It is always the same question: “Have you really read all of these books?” My answer is always the same: “No. A library is not a sign of accomplishment. It is a sign of desire.” My guest is relieved.\n\n– Jeffrey Kripal\n\nA good memoir is about how one understands life, not the life itself.\n\n– Ira Sukrungruang\n\nYou will burn and you will burn out;\n\nyou will be healed and come back again.\n\n– Fyodor Dostoyevsky\n\nThe best readers actually quit a lot of books.

But each time\n\nyou looked at me, I could only blink\n\ninto my wrists. When you spoke of love\n\nat the shuffleboard table, I should have\n\nput down my drink and said it.
