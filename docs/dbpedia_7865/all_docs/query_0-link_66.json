        "text": "\"Critical to Molecular Horizon's vision is the systematic integration of cutting-edge visualisation techniques spanning from the molecular to the organismal scale with mechanistic biology and medicinal chemistry. These enabling technologies will allow transformative understanding of the molecular principles of disease and utilisation of that knowledge to identify strategies to develop novel therapeutics and diagnostics.\n\nThe 2019-2020 period brought a number of major milestones for Molecular Horizons. With our new, 6,500-m2 world-class research facility having reached completion in January 2020, our teams were eager to recommence their research and put to use the new equipment – including the brand new cryo-EM facility with its state-of-the-art equipment to determine the atomic-level structures of biological macromolecules.\n\nLittle did we know that we would be opening our Institute at the brink of a global pandemic. There is no doubt that 2020 was a disruptive and challenging year. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our lives started a process that saw the world changed in many ways. With our colleagues and students living in periods of extended lockdowns, teaching staff facilitating the transition of all UOW’s teaching to online platforms, colleagues feeling the financial realities of the university environment during COVID, adapting to new COVID-safe practices, and juggling the consequential mental pressures, adjusting to the new normal impacted us all.\n\nDespite the new challenges we were facing, Molecular Horizons has demonstrated an excellent few years of impactful research and wonderful highlights, all described in this report. In the 2019-2020 period alone, our researchers have been awarded over 90 grants and have published more than 340 publications. Some other notable achievements include the prestigious fellowships, scientific awards and many other accolades that are a testament to the exceptional talent within our Institute.\n\nMolecular Horizons partners with industry, government, universities and community partners to cultivate highly integrated research programs that transcend traditional, individual project-based efforts, to deliver outcomes of increased scale, scope and impact. Underpinned by a strong institutional culture of creativity, innovation and collegiality our mission is to translate basic molecular understanding into real-world applications and, in doing so, recruit and train the next generation of interdisciplinary life scientists.\n\nIn this highly multidisciplinary environment, Molecular Horizons members have provided joint supervision of Honours and HDR students, coordinated exchange programs, co-authored publications and grants, and successfully graduated over 50 postgraduate students in the 2019-2020 period, many with awards, prizes, and first author publications in high-impact journals.\n\nLastly, I would like to acknowledge and thank all staff and student members for their resilience, endurance and exceptional strength that has been shown in abundance during this time. We should be extremely proud of the quality of our research whilst navigating the obstacles the pandemic created in all aspects of our lives. Also, I would like to thank all our partners for helping us grow as an Institute. In particular, I am grateful for our generous donors joining and supporting us on this exciting journey. It is my pleasure to celebrate with you a wonderful first two years of Molecular Horizons.\"\n\nDistinguished Professor Antoine van Oijen\n\nDirector, Molecular Horizons\n\nDeveloping anti-cancer drugs with industry\n\nMolecular Horizons researcher Dr Carolyn Dillon and her research team have entered a joint venture licencing agreement with the Australian Pharmaceutical Company, Phebra. The agreement stems from an ongoing UOW/Phebra relationship that was established in 2016 following Dr Dillon’s conception of a class of arsenic compounds that selectively target specific cancers.\n\nThe concept was patented internationally in 2019 and Phebra has funded further patents across the Americas, Asia, Europe and the Middle East. The collaboration utilises the expertise of Dr Dillon’s research group in the areas of synthesis, characterisation, purification and in vitro biological testing to design and identify candidates for in vivo assessment. The most promising compound, to date, targets and kills leukemia cells over healthy blood cells with one thousand times greater selectivity.\n\nThe collaboration provides invaluable insight into the development and manufacturing of drugs by the pharmaceutical industry for postgraduate and undergraduate medicinal chemistry students at UOW.\n\nMicroprobe XRF imaging showing arsenic uptake and distribution throughout both the cytoplasm and nucleus of a leukemia cell following treatment with the potential arsenic drug.\n\nMichael Tynan Challenge\n\nThe Michael Tynan Challenge (MTC) was created in dedication of Michael Tynan, OAM, who sadly passed away in February 2016 after a two-year fight with cancer. It was Michael’s dedication to community and family that inspired his daughter, Tynan Motors Group Director Madeline Tynan, to establish the MTC in 2016. The MTC’s goal is to raise funds that contribute to medical health research that will save lives and create better health outcomes within the community.\n\nWe are incredibly honoured and grateful to be invited to participate in the various fundraiser activities set out by the MTC throughout the year, including the Race Day Luncheon and the Coastal Walk Challenge. The funds raised from these activities have enabled us to establish scholarships supporting undergraduate students during their fourth-year honours projects. Embedded in the research groups in Molecular Horizons, these students use the final year of their studies to conduct impact-driven research that contributes to solving global health challenges such as motor neurone disease, Alzheimer’s, cancer therapeutics, molecular neuroscience and protein aggregation related diseases. During 2019 and 2020, we have been able to support 11 students with a Tynan Family Molecular Horizons Honours Scholarship.\n\n\"As a family, we are passionate about giving back to the community that supports our family business.\"\n\n\"We are delighted to support the development taking place in the medical research facilities at UOW, which is assisting not only the local but broader community, especially at a time when the importance of medical research is so evident today, during this epidemic, for both physical and mental health.\" - Madeline Tynan\n\nThe Centre for Oncology Education & Research Translation (CONCERT)\n\nCONCERT was established in 2014 as part of the Cancer Institute NSW (CINSW) initiative for Translational Cancer Research Centres (TCRC). CONCERT brought together the knowledge and expertise of cancer health professionals & researchers from 10 institutions and 3 local health districts hospitals across Sydney and the Illawarra/Shoalhaven to facilitate translation of cancer research to achieve better outcomes for those affected by cancer. CONCERT has recently transitioned into a new larger entity called the Sydney Partnership for Health, Education, Research and Enterprise (SPHERE) Cancer Clinical Academic Group (CAG), which was recently awarded a $7million Translational Cancer Research Capacity Building Grant from Cancer Institute NSW. During its 7 years of operation CONCERT became a 370 member strong cancer research network with overarching Targets and Therapeutics (coordinated by Prof Ranson from MH/IHMRI who has also acted as Deputy Director of CONCERT) and Policy and Practice flagship programmes. This includes the ongoing CONCERT Biobank which has collected over 35,000 samples for over 40 research projects to date. There is now a fully developed process for routine patient sample collection and analysis within the Illawarra and across the CONCERT network, with firm research links established to other clinical and academic institutes in NSW. The access to patient samples with linked clinical data is informing biomarker discovery for diagnostic, prognostic and/or predictive (e.g., drug responsiveness) analyses. For example, we established patient-derived cultures from gastric cancer circulating tumour cells as avatars for drug responsiveness studies in this disease.\n\nFluorescence microscopy image of patient-derived gastric cancer circulating tumour cells showing staining for DNA (DAPI, blue) and the cellular structural component Actin (red). These cells are also highly positive for the cell surface growth factor receptor EGFR (green), whose overexpression is often a feature of rapidly growing and invasive cancer cells. Drugs blocking EGFR can be used to limit gastric cancer spread.\n\nDr Kimberley Davis completed her PhD in 2015 in what was then the UOW School of Chemistry, under the supervision of Molecular Horizons researchers Prof Stephen Ralph, Prof Jenny Beck and Dr Chris Richardson. Although a chemist by background, Dr Davis was able to branch out into the biomolecular sphere, investigating how a range of nickel Schiff base complexes she synthesised interacted with Quadruplex DNA, a structure which is implicated in tumour immortality.\n\nSince then, Dr Davis has worked in a diverse range of areas – science communication, academic teaching, lab-based work, and community engagement. Dr Davis: ‘Some of these appear to have no relation to my PhD! However, I can safely say that a PhD isn’t just about domain knowledge; you learn a great many more things, but most of all how to adapt and how to continuously learn.’\n\nDr Davis has now moved into the Clinical Research sphere, as part of the Research Operations team for the Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District, joining in mid-2020. Despite having no clinical background, she has been able to readily transition into this space, working with clinicians in a range of disciplines and assisting with their projects – very much like an all-areas Clinical Post-Doc. She has already published with ISLHD clinicians in both General and Orthopaedic surgery, and is currently working on papers for Aged Care and Emergency Stroke assessment, as well as being involved in projects in areas such as Health Information Management, Pharmacy, Cardiology, Cancer prognostics, and much more.\n\n*Grants received at $100,000 or more\n\nNational Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)\n\nNeurite deficits, obesity and cortical thinning: Prevention and treatment in schizophrenia\n\nXu-Feng Huang (SMAH) -
