        "text": "Tara MacCrone, Manager for the Research Office, is the recipient of the 2023 Sharon A. Ling Award of Excellence for Outstanding Achievement by a Staff Member.\n\nStaff form an integral part of the Western community. Staff members support the academic mission of Western, allowing faculty and students to devote much of their energy towards the search for truth and the application of knowledge. The University of Western Ontario recognizes the crucial role of staff. Western Engineering has been a leader in this regard. For several years now, we have offered staff recognition awards to honour the significant contributions of technical and administrative staff within our Faculty. These awards consist of a plaque and a prize, presented at the annual awards banquet.\n\nIn 2007, this award was renamed “The Sharon A. Ling Award of Excellence for Outstanding Achievement by a Staff Member” to honour and recognize Sharon Ling, a long-time staff member in the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering. Sharon was a staff member who passionately dedicated her time and energy for the betterment of the Faculty.\n\nPast recipients:\n\nSamantha Roach - Director of Engineering Experiential Learning and Student Support, Dean’s Office (2022)\n\nKaren Henry - Mechanical & Materials Engineering (2021)\n\nClare Tattersall - Manager, Undergraduate Services (2020)\n\nKristen Edwards - Civil & Environmental Engineering (2019)\n\nJoanna Blom - Mechanical and Materials Engineering (2018)\n\nStephanie Tigert - Electrical & Computer Engineering (2017)\n\nClaire Naudi - Mechanical & Materials Engineering (2016)\n\nKatherine Manweiler - Engineering Finance and Stores (2015)\n\nSarah Williams - Dean's Office, Human Resources (2014)\n\nKaren Norman - Boundary Layer Wind Tunner Laboratory (2013)\n\nAllison Stevenson - External Services (2012)\n\nClayton Cook - University Machine Services (2011)\n\nJoel Eckert - Information Technology Group (ITG) (2010)\n\nJan Shepherd McKee – Undergraduate Services (2009)\n\nBarry Kay – Information Technology Group (2008)\n\nSandra Vilovski – Electrical & Computer Engineering (2007)\n\nNina Lowes – Undergraduate Services (2006)\n\nWalid Altahan – Mechanical & Materials Engineering (2005)\n\nKathy Lesko – Chemical & Biochemical Engineering (2004)\n\nChris Seres – Mechanical & Materials Engineering (2003)\n\nJacquie Taylor – Electrical & Computer Engineering (2002)\n\nSouheil Afara – Chemical & Biochemical Engineering (2001)\n\nSue Chapman – Dean’s Office (1999)\n\nGary Lusk – Civil & Environmental Engineering (1999)\n\nDoug Phillips – University Machine Services (1998)\n\nElizabeth Milligan - Civil & Environmental Engineering (1998)"
