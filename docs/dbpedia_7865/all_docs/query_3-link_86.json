We demonstrated that transcription persists in brain of virally suppressed PWH, although at a lower level than reservoirs in circulation CD4+ T cells. Furthermore, while HIV transcripts related to initiation of HIV transcription were detected in brain tissue from all virally suppressed PWH assessed, transcripts related to the completion of transcription was only evident in a small subset. Within this subset, we further demonstrated the presence of HIV proteins within resident brain cells. Our study characterises the persistence of ongoing HIV transcription and translation within the brain of PWH despite viral suppression.

        "text": "Results\n\nProximal and distal blocks to HIV RNA transcription are present in brain tissue of non-virally suppressed and virally suppressed PWH\n\nTo characterise the HIV transcriptional landscape in the brain of PWH, RNA transcripts (HIV TAR, Long-LTR, Pol, PolyA and Tat/Rev) were quantified by the nanowell digital PCR-based HIV transcript assays using brain tissue from PWH [16]. Fresh frozen autopsy frontal cortex brain tissue from viremic (non-virally suppressed; n = 13; median plasma viral load: 61,223 [8,557–558,810] HIV RNA copies/mL) and virally suppressed PWH (n = 11; all undetectable plasma viral load <50 HIV RNA copies/mL) was provided by the National NeuroAIDS Tissue Consortium (NNTC; Table 1). Viral suppression was defined as >2 year of sustained ART treatment with undetectable plasma viral loads (1 blip < 250 copies HIV RNA/mL at > 6 months from autopsy allowed). The median time of viral suppression was 3.93 years. One non-virally suppressed PWH (nVS PWH 13) had plasma viral loads <100 HIV RNA copies/mL and several nVS PWH were treated with ART at death. However, these individuals did not have an undetectable viral load for >2 years prior to death and therefore were not included in the virally suppressed PWH group. No participants had systemic infection at the time of death.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1012446.t001\n\nWe performed HIV transcriptional profiling assays on RNA isolated from the frontal cortex brain tissue utilising a digital PCR approach that utilises successive primer/probe sets to identify transcriptional initiation (TAR), proximal elongation (R-U5-pre-Gag; “Long-LTR”), elongation (Pol), transcriptional completion (PolyA), and multiple splicing (Tat/Rev). The level of each transcript was normalised to 106 cell equivalents by RPP30 DNA (Fig 1), μg RNA and DNA mass in matched samples, as previously described [14,16] (S1 Fig).\n\nHIV RNA transcripts for HIV TAR, Long-LTR, Pol, PolyA and Tat/Rev quantified by QIAcuity digital PCR from frontal cortex brain tissue from (A) non-virally suppressed (n = 13) or (B) virally suppressed PWH (n = 10). HIV transcripts standardised to 106 cell equivalents as measured by RRP30 DNA. Comparisons made using non-parametric paired Wilcoxon-tests where colored symbols represent individual PWH. (C) Comparative analysis of TAR, Long-LTR, Pol, PolyA and multiply spliced Tat/Rev HIV transcripts between virally suppressed (blue) and non-virally suppressed PWH (red). (D) Comparative analysis of HIV TAR RNA/Long-LTR RNA ratio in frontal cortex tissue from virally suppressed (VS; n = 6) or non-virally suppressed PWH (nVS; n = 11). Comparisons made using non-parametric unpaired Mann-Whitney tests. Median and interquartile ranges shown. *P<0.05, **P<0.01, ***P<0.001.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1012446.g001\n\nThe majority of non-virally suppressed PWH had detectable TAR, Long-LTR, Pol and Poly A HIV transcripts in the frontal cortex of the brain (Fig 1A). Multiply spliced transcripts (Tat/Rev) were detected in a subset of non-virally suppressed PWH (7/13). Median levels of Long-LTR were 3.5-fold lower relative to TAR (medians: 192 vs 681 copies/106 cell equivalents, P<0.001), suggesting a block to proximal elongation. Median levels of Tat/Rev were lower than PolyA (medians: 0.00 vs 62.7 copies/106, P<0.01), indicating a block to multiple splicing. Levels of HIV Long-LTR, Pol and PolyA were similar in non-virally suppressed PWH.\n\nHIV TAR transcripts were also detected in 10/11 brain tissue of virally suppressed PWH (Fig 1B). The virally suppressed PWH with no detectable TAR was excluded from further analysis as they also had no detectable levels of Long-LTR, but detectable HIV Pol RNA, potentially reflecting sequence polymorphisms in these regions. A proximal block to transcription was observed with levels of HIV Long-LTR transcripts ~8 fold lower than levels of HIV TAR in virally suppressed PWH (median: 34.4 vs 277 copies/106 cells; P<0.05), suggesting inefficient proximal elongation. Levels of HIV Long-LTR were similar to levels of Pol (median: 34.4 vs 46.4 copies/106 cells, P>0.05). Levels of HIV PolyA were significantly lower than Pol in brain tissue from virally suppressed PWH (5.8 vs 46.4 copies/106 cells; P<0.01), demonstrating a block to transcription completion. Notably, HIV Tat/Rev transcripts were detected in brain tissue from 2/10 virally suppressed PWH, indicating that the generation of multiply spliced transcripts occurs in the frontal cortex of a subset of virally suppressed PWH. Interestingly, levels of HIV RNA transcripts in the brain of non-virally suppressed and virally suppressed PWH were similar, except for levels of Long-LTR (median nVS vs VS PWH: 192 vs 34.4 copies/106 cells; P<0.05) and PolyA (median nVS vs VS PWH: 62.7 vs 5.8 copies/106 cells; P = 0.055) which were higher in non-virally suppressed PWH (Fig 1C). The block between HIV TAR and Long-LTR was 5-fold higher in virally suppressed PWH than non-virally suppressed PWH, indicating a larger block to proximal elongation in PWH suppressed with ART (Fig 1D). Together, these data provide evidence that HIV transcription initiation, elongation, and completion, at least in some PWH, occurs in both non-virally suppressed and virally suppressed PWH regardless of long-term viral suppression with ART.\n\nThe total level of each HIV RNA transcript in the brain did not correlate with plasma levels of HIV RNA, CD4+ T cells in the blood or time between last plasma viral load test and death (S1 Table). No clear association between ART regimen or associated CNS penetrance effectiveness (CPE) scores at death and levels of HIV RNA transcripts were also observed (S1 Table) with all virally suppressed PWH with detectable Tat/Rev transcripts being treated with medium (CPE 6–8) or high (CPE >9) CPE ARVs at death.\n\nNotably, the total levels of each HIV RNA transcript was associated with total HIV DNA levels in the brain (P<0.05 for all; Fig 2), demonstrating that the level of HIV transcription is associated with reservoir size within the brain. HIV RNA transcripts were also associated with levels of intact proviral DNA (S2 Fig). Together, these data suggest that transcriptional activity is directly associated with HIV reservoir size in the brain.\n\nLinear regression analysis of HIV RNA transcription (A) initiation (TAR), (B) elongation (Long-LTR), (C) Pol, (D) completion (PolyA) and (E) multiply spliced Tat/Rev transcripts vs total HIV DNA levels in frontal cortex brain tissue as measured by digital PCR for virally suppressed (n = 2–14; blue symbols) and non-virally suppressed PWH (n = 7–13; red symbols). All parameters log transformed; R2, P values and 95% confidence intervals shown.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1012446.g002\n\nHIV viral p24 is present in brain tissue from virally suppressed PWH with completed HIV transcription\n\nTo confirm whether the presence of completed HIV transcription (as defined by the presence of PolyA and/or multiply spliced Tat/Rev HIV transcripts) is associated with translation of viral proteins in brain tissue, the presence of the p24 HIV capsid protein was measured by immunohistochemistry in matched formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) brain tissue. Tissue was also co-labelled with CD68 and CD3 to identify myeloid cells and T cells, respectively. No matched FFPE tissue was available for non-virally suppressed PWH 1 and 13. HIV p24+ cells were detected in all non-virally suppressed and virally suppressed PWH with detectable HIV PolyA and/or Tat/Rev transcripts (representative images shown Fig 3). Subsequent co-localisation analysis demonstrated that parenchymal p24+ cells were CD68 expressing myeloid cells. A rare population of CD3+p24+ T cells were also detected in some individuals; however, these were restricted to vessels, likely reflecting infected peripheral T cells attached to vessel walls. Our results demonstrate that active (and in some cases completed) HIV transcription persists in the brain of PWH which has the potential to lead to viral protein production.\n\nRepresentative images of cell nuclei (blue), CD68+ myeloid cells (green), CD3+ T cells (white) and HIV p24 protein (red) labelled cells by immunofluorescence imaging from human frontal cortex brain tissue from virally suppressed PWH (VS PWH; left panels) and non-virally suppressed (nVS PWH; right panels; n = 2 per group shown).

Virally suppressed PWH with matched PBMCs available were identified (n = 5). PBMCs from the virally suppressed PWH tested had detectable levels of HIV TAR (5/5), Long-LTR (5/5), Pol (4/5) and PolyA transcripts (4/5) with one individual harbouring multiply spliced Tat/Rev transcripts (1/5; Fig 4A). HIV Pol transcripts were not detected in PBMCs for one individual despite >700 ng of material screened (VS PWH 1: blue). As all other transcripts were present at levels ≥40 copies/106 cells, this may reflect sequence polymorphisms for this individual in the Pol region. Similar to previous findings [14,15], PBMCs contained a similar pattern in levels of HIV RNA transcripts demonstrated by higher levels of TAR, followed by Long-LTR, Pol and PolyA with only one individual harbouring Tat/Rev transcripts (Fig 4A).\n\n(A) HIV RNA transcripts for HIV TAR, Long-LTR, Pol, PolyA and Tat/Rev quantified by QIAcuity digital PCR in PBMCs from virally suppressed PWH (n = 5).

Median and interquartile ranges shown. *P<0.05, **P<0.01. P<0.05 considered statistically significant.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1012446.g004\n\nWhen comparing between compartments, PBMCs contained higher levels of TAR (median PBMCs vs frontal cortex: 15,902 vs 265.1 copies/106 cells; P<0.01) and Long-LTR (median PBMCs vs frontal cortex: 152.3 vs 5.3 copies/106 cells; P = 0.06) and PolyA (median PBMCs vs frontal cortex: 80.6 vs 0.0 copies/106 cells; P = 0.06) transcripts than those in matched frontal cortex brain tissue (Fig 4B). The ratio of HIV TAR RNA relative to total HIV DNA was 10-fold higher in PBMCs than those present in the frontal cortex (S3 Fig; P<0.01). Similar to findings in frontal cortex tissue, a block to proximal elongation was also detected in PBMCs. However, the magnitude of the block was ~10-fold higher in PBMCs relative to frontal cortex tissue (Fig 4C). Together, these findings demonstrate that a block to proximal elongation exists in both PBMCs and frontal cortex tissue from virally suppressed PWH. However, the levels of HIV transcripts, and magnitude of the block to proximal elongation is larger in PBMCs relative to frontal cortex of the brain.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe role of the brain as an active reservoir of HIV in virally suppressed PWH is unclear. While intact proviral genomes are potentially capable of producing viral proteins [8,10,11], and the isolation of replication competent HIV have been demonstrated in brain tissue [12], whether these genomes are capable of producing virus in vivo confirming the brain as a tissue reservoir of HIV has not been established. Peripheral blood and non-CNS tissue sites harbour transcriptionally active reservoirs despite long-term viral suppression with ART which likely contributes to immune activation and inflammatory disease. Given that PWH continue to develop HAND, determining whether disease pathogenesis is driven by ongoing transcription in the brain warrants investigation.\n\nIn this study, we characterized the persistent HIV reservoir in the frontal cortex of the brain of both non-virally suppressed and virally suppressed PWH and demonstrate that active HIV transcription occurs. HIV RNA transcripts were detected in frontal cortex tissue of PWH regardless of viral suppression with ART, which mimics our findings in matched PBMCs and those of others in circulating CD4+ T cells and tissue reservoirs including the gut of virally suppressed PWH [14,15,18]. However, levels of HIV TAR transcripts in frontal cortex were largely similar between virally suppressed and non-virally suppressed PWH, demonstrating that long-term viral suppression with ART does not appear to be impacting HIV transcriptional initiation in the brain. Although blocks to HIV transcription were similar between virally suppressed and non-virally suppressed PWH, a block to transcriptional completion (i.e. Pol➔PolyA) was observed in virally suppressed PWH which was not present in non-virally suppressed individuals. Importantly, all HIV transcript species were detected in 2/11 virally suppressed and 7/13 non-virally suppressed PWH, demonstrating the presence of transcriptional completion and splicing in the brain regardless of viral suppression. Levels of transcripts in the brain were generally lower than those in matched PBMCs.\n\nThe presence of completion of transcription, splicing and HIV protein production suggests that the brain reservoir of HIV in virally suppressed PWH is not silent, but active in some individuals. Furthermore, this completion of transcription and protein production was associated with intact proviruses in the brain. We and others have demonstrated the presence of intact, potentially replication competent HIV proviruses in the brain of virally suppressed PWH despite long-term viral suppression with ART [8,10–12]. Recently, microglia isolated and enriched from the brains of PWH who had undergone rapid autopsy, were demonstrated to contain replication competent virus ex vivo in a quantitative viral outgrowth assay (qVOA) [12]. Whether these viruses can truly replicate in the brain in vivo and reseed peripheral cells and tissue is unknown and requires further investigation.\n\nTAR transcripts were detected in the frontal cortex (and PBMCs of those tested) in 23/24 PWH regardless of viral suppression with ART. Immunofluorescence imaging demonstrated the presence of p24 predominantly in CD68+ myeloid cells, supporting our previously published findings that the major HIV reservoir in the frontal cortex of the brain is present in microglia and macrophages and not CD3+ T cells [8]. Microglia play a key role in sensing and responding pathogenic antigens in the brain. Therefore, sensing of HIV RNA by microglia/macrophages in the brain may induce cellular activation and contribute to neuroinflammation and neuropathology in PWH independent of HIV protein production or viral rebound. Double stranded (ds) HIV RNA is capable of inducing innate immune activation via viral sensing pathways including TLR-3, TLR-7, RIG-I and Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) pattern recognition receptors, resulting in induction of antiviral interferon signalling and proinflammatory cytokine production [19–21]. Specifically, HIV RNA has been shown to activate macrophages ex vivo in an IFN-I dependent manner via MAVS signalling, resulting in the production of proinflammatory cytokines [19]. Intron containing HIV RNA also induces immune activation in microglia cell lines independent of the generation of multiply spliced HIV RNA [22]. Cell associated HIV RNA in cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) is also associated with brain injury as measured by 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy in frontal white matter [23], supporting a mechanism by which ongoing HIV transcription contributes to neuropathology and HAND.\n\nThe presence of RNA in the brain of a subset of virally suppressed PWH supports a recent study where levels of cell associated HIV gag RNA, as measured by ddPCR, were similar to those observed in this study (and at a similar ratio relative to integrated HIV DNA) in microglia isolated from the CNS of a PWH, as part of the rapid autopsy ‘last gift cohort’ [12]. While no transcriptional profiling was carried out, the data support our observations of ongoing transcription and the CNS as a transcriptionally active reservoir. The sources of HIV transcripts in brain tissue require further investigation, however, as our study utilised material from virally suppressed PWH that were suppressed for >2 years, viral persistence and transcription observed likely reflects ongoing activation that are not related to historical viruses. Our detection of p24+ cells also supports the potential of a translationally competent reservoir as the half-life of p24 is suggested to be approximately 30 days in the plasma and likely months, not years in tissue [24]. As this study utilised human autopsy material, our findings represent a single timepoint. It is possible (and likely) that the level of viral transcription does change over time. In individuals where HIV transcripts were not detected, they may have been present during earlier time points, or in other regions of the brain than those measured. However, the temporal expression of HIV transcripts cannot be sampled using autopsy samples and studies using well characterized non-human primate models may offer additional insight into changes in levels of viral transcripts in the brain over time.\n\nIt is possible that the transcripts detected in this study may have been generated from replication incompetent defective proviruses. Defective HIV proviruses have been shown to be capable of viral transcription and in some cases produce viral proteins following translation [25,26]. Specifically, HIV RNA transcripts produced in PBMCs have been previously associated with IL-6 and TNF-α production. Therefore, viral transcripts may be a contributor to ongoing immune activation in the brain of PWH, without the requirement for full transcription and/or translation processes. Defining the contribution of defective proviruses in the brain in the generation of HIV transcripts and potential neuropathology requires further investigation in larger dedicated studies.\n\nMajor proximal and distal blocks to transcription in the brain were similar to findings reported in CD4+ T cell reservoirs in blood and gut tissue [14,15,18]. We also identified that HIV transcripts in the brain of individuals were present at lower levels to those in matched PBMCs, although statistical analyses could not be performed due to limited donors with matched stored PBMCs available. These data could suggest that factors that maintain latency in the brain are similar to those in the periphery, including a lack of host elongation factors, splicing factors, aberrant nuclear export and/or impaired Tat activity [27–30]. Indeed, we observed that multiply spliced Tat/Rev transcript levels were lower than polyadenylated transcripts, suggesting a specific block to multiple splicing. This predicted lack of Tat may also explain the block in transcript elongation. It is unlikely that RNA decay will impact the presence/absence of transcripts being detected. The decay of all transcripts we assessed has been previously measured in CD4+ T cells of virally suppressed PWH [15]. The half-life for the majority of transcripts were similar. Tat-Rev is the most stable transcript, however, represents the smallest population of transcripts identified. Similarly, the presence of a polyA tail would increase the stability of polyadenylated transcripts [31], however these transcripts also represent a small fraction of the total transcripts quantified. Thus, differences in RNA stability alone do not account for the trends seen within the transcriptional profiling assay.\n\nOur findings have significant clinical implications regarding both HIV cure and long-term treatment approaches. Levels of HIV transcripts in frontal cortex tissue did not correlate with the length of viral suppression. Moreover, no correlation or discernible pattern with CPE scores and detection of PolyA and Tat/Rev transcripts was observed, indicating that the detection of multiply spliced transcripts in frontal cortex tissue of virally suppressed PWH was not related to treatment with ARVs with low CNS penetrance at death. However, it is possible that transcription may be occurring within tissue niches with low concentrations of ART (as observed in peripheral tissues [32]) including frontal white matter, which is a major pathophysiological site of HAND and a reservoir of intact and defective HIV provirus in the brain [10]. Additional studies using spatial analysis of HIV RNA transcripts within tissue sections may resolve the specific contributions of local viral transcription in the brain on the surrounding cellular environment and potential cognitive dysfunction.\n\nVirally suppressed PWH in this study had a relatively low median CD4 count of 274 cells/mm3. Therefore, it would be of interest to assess the level of viral transcription in individuals with circulating CD4 T+ cell counts >500 cells/mm3. Additionally, future studies understanding the impact of persistent low level viraemia present in individuals with non-suppressible viremia on HIV transcripts in brain tissue may inform on activity and contribution of viral reservoirs in the brain of PWH on neurocognitive disorders.\n\nOur results also provide renewed support for novel treatment approaches to target ongoing HIV transcription which is largely not affected by current HIV treatment approaches. Therefore, selection of neuroART regimens with deeper CNS penetrance coupled with the generation of therapeutic strategies targeting HIV transcription may be required to truly silence ongoing HIV transcription in the brain. These data also have implications for latency reversal approaches in the CNS [33], and new latency reversing agents (LRAs) would have to overcome similar blocks as those seen in peripheral and lymphoid CD4+ T cells and penetrance issues of drugs into the brain [14,34].\n\nTogether, in this study we demonstrate the presence of a transcriptionally active HIV reservoir in the brain of a subset of virally suppressed PWH which may contribute, at least in part, to ongoing immune activation."
