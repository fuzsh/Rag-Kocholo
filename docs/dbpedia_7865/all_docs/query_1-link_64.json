The lab also researches factors that drive liver disease in HIV-hepatitis B virus co-infection. The lab is also actively involved in COVID in relation to pathogenesis, the use of primary tissue models, and developing therapeutics using gene editing strategies.\n\nClinical trials for HIV cure\n\nOur group have had a long-standing interest in early phase 1/2 studies to eliminate HIV latency. Initial studies focused on the role of latency reversing agents, pro-apoptotic drugs and immune modulation. Our current interventional studies include TLR agonists, neutralising antibodies and anti-PD1. In addition to interventional studies, our lab focuses on observational studies to understand the determinants of HIV persistence, including the role of circadian rhythms, clonal proliferation, co-infections and other clinical parameters.\n\nVirological determinants of HIV persistence and elimination\n\nOur major focus is understanding the determinants of HIV latency, strategies to either reverse or permanently silence HIV and strategies to induce selective death of an infected cells. We use innovative techniques to understand how the virus can persist on ART using CD4+ T-cells from people living with HIV on ART. We have a major interest in developing assays to better quantify HIV persistence on antiretroviral therapy. We aim to identify new ways to reverse HIV latency and enhance apoptosis, including using nanoparticles to deliver drugs or gene editing approaches to the nucleus. This work is done in collaboration with Dr Frank Caruso in the Department of Biomedical Engineering.\n\nImmunomodulation to eliminate the HIV reservoir\n\nHIV can persist on antiretroviral therapy due to an impaired capacity for the HIV-specific T-cell response to either kill infected cells or control virus once there is viral rebound. We are exploring the role of drugs and antibodies developed for treatment of malignancy to enhance HIV-specific T-cells to kill latently infected cells. Our current major approaches include the use of immune checkpoint blockers and drugs that activate NK cells including pomalidomide.\n\nHIV and HBV co-infection\n\nCo-infections with other pathogens cause significant morbidity in patients with HIV. In the case of HIV/HBV co-infection, morbidity and mortality secondary to liver disease is greatly increased compared to those infected with HBV or HIV alone. We are interested in the mechanisms of how HIV can accelerate liver disease in patients co-infected with HBV and why there is enhanced HBV clearance following antiviral treatment of HIV-HBV co-infection. These studies include laboratory-based programs and clinical cohort studies based in Thailand, Malaysia and India. These studies could potentially lead to new treatments for liver disease and strategies for an HBV Cure.\n\nCOVID-19 natural history, diagnosis and treatment\n\nOur lab is supporting a range of observational and interventional studies led by members of the Department of Infectious Diseases to establish a biobank for COVID-19 patients. We are also developing novel tests to diagnose SARS-CoV-2, models to understand the pathogenesis of the virus, and assessing the role of CRISPR-Cas 13 therapeutics, in collaboration with Professor Joe Trapani and Dr. Mohamed Fareh at the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre.\n\nStaff\n\nLaboratory Head\n\nProfessor Sharon Lewin, Director, The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity; Head, Department of Infectious Diseases, Melbourne Medical School\n\nSenior Scientists\n\nDr Michael Roche, Senior Research Fellow\n\nAjantha Rhodes, Clinical Operations Manager & Laboratory Manager; Head, Virology Core\n\nDr Judy Chang, Research Systems Administrator – Clinical Research; Head, Immunology Core\n\nDr Jennifer Audsley, Senior Research Fellow\n\nPostdoctoral Fellows\n\nDr Wei Zhao, Research Fellow\n\nDr Chris Chiu, Research Fellow\n\nDr Youry Kim, Research Fellow\n\nDr Stan Kan, Research Fellow\n\nDr Jill Lau, Clinical Research Fellow\n\nMr Abdalla Ali\n\nPhD Students\n\nMs Rachel Pascoe\n\nMs Paula Cevaal\n\nMr Haoming Liu\n\nMs Kiho Tanaka\n\nMr Rory Shepherd\n\nHonours Students\n\nLauren Wallace\n\nBridget Fisher\n\nResearch Assistants\n\nCarolin Tumpach, Research Support Officer; High Containment Laboratory Manager; Chromium 10X Conroller Platform Manager\n\nRosalyn Cao, Research Support Officer\n\nDanielle Fong, Research Support Officer\n\nAbigail Tan, Research Support Officer\n\nResearch Support Staff\n\nDr Catherine Kennedy (Research Coordinator)\n\nClinical Affiliates\n\nAssociate Professor Edwina Wright\n\nDr James McMahon\n\nDr Janine Trevillyan\n\nAssociate Professor Thomas Rasmussen\n\nFunding\n\nAddressing the major challenges in HIV vaccine and cure research\n\nKent S, Lewin SR, Cooper DA, Caruso F, Palmer S, Kelleher A, Davenport M.\n\nCIBNHMRC Program Grant APP1149990\n\n2019\n\n5 years; $16,136,755\n\nThe future of HIV care - long term remission and eliminating co-morbidities\n\nLewin SR\n\nCIANHMRC Practitioner Fellowship APP1135851\n\n2018\n\n5 years; $577,188\n\nDelaney AIDS Research Enterprise (DARE) to find a cure.\n\nDeeks S, Picker L, Lewin SR, McCune M\n\nCo-investigatorNational Institutes for Health UM1AI126611\n\n2016\n\n5 years; $3million USD\n\nAustralian Partnership (for) Preparedness Research on InfectiouS (Disease) Emergencies (APPRISE)\n\nLewin SR, Sorrell T, McVernon J, Webb S, Kaldor J, Andrews R, Cheng A, Gilbert G, Smith D, Alexandersen S\n\nCIANHMRC Centres of Research Excellence\n\n2016\n\n5 years; $4,996,416\n\nTherapeutic targeting of SARS-CoV-2 RNA with CRISPR-Cas13\n\nLewin SR, Chen Z, Trapani J, Fareh M, Vincan E, Zhao W.\n\nCIASino-Australia COVID-19 Partnership Seed Funding\n\n2020\n\n1 year; $50,000\n\nDeveloping and Implementing an Ethical Framework for HIV Phylogenetic Analysis In Australia\n\nLewin SR, Williamson D, Wright E, Fairley C, Hocking J, Ward J, Keogh L, Crouch S, Alpren C\n\nCIANHMRC Partnership Grant (APP1198800)\n\n2020\n\n4 years; $537,855\n\nEvaluating direct and indirect effects of SARS-CoV-2 on multiple organ systems using stem cell-derived human tissues\n\nLittle M (CIA)… Lewin SR\n\nCo-IMedical Research Future Fund (MRFF)\n\n2020\n\n2 years;$80,000\n\nCOVID-19 Strategic Planning and Delivery of Testing\n\nLewin SR, Howden B, Stinear T, Williamson D, Catton M, Monk I, Guerillot R, Lee J, Sherry N, Bond K.\n\nCIAMedical Research Future Fund (MRFF)\n\n2020\n\n1 year; $2,699,278\n\nA hidden reservoir?
