        "text": "For artist and Professor of Fine Arts Sharon Hayes, time is a public resource. Her work, which engages strategies of performance, video, and sonic and public sculpture, explores the impulse to represent one’s self and one’s presence in moments of history. Beginning with her 2003 video installation of repeating audio tapes made by the Symbionese Liberation Army and continuing through her five-part video series Ricerche, Hayes has investigated the ways people speak in groups, and the way groups speak through individual people. Last month, the final installment of Ricerche debuted at the 2024 Whitney Biennial: Even Better Than the Real Thing, where it will be on view through August 11.\n\nHayes’s work has been presented in solo exhibitions at the Andrea Rosen Gallery and Madrid’s Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia, among many other places, and shown in group exhibitions at the Venice Biennale; The Museum of Modern Art, New York, and the Guggenheim Museum.\n\n[Editor's note: In July of 2024, Hayes was appointed chair of the Department of Fine Arts, succeeding Ken Lum, the Marilyn Jordan Taylor Presidential Professor.]\n\nWhen did you first come to Penn, and how to you conceptualize the relationship between your practice and your teaching?\n\nI came to Penn in 2015 after 10 years teaching at The Cooper Union in New York City. I started teaching there right after graduate school, as I was building and deepening my art practice. I guess in some ways, these two practices–teaching and making art­–developed in relation to each other and are bound up with each other. I don’t teach my own work in the classroom but who I am as an artist, the questions I ask in my work, and the conceptual frameworks that animate my art practice, deeply inform the who, what, when, where and how of my teaching. I am constantly making and re-making courses, bringing in fresh content, working with new pedagogic forms. The huge privilege of teaching is that I get to work with and learn from successive generations of younger artists. I care about them and I care about the transformations they want in and from their work and also from the world around them.\n\nIt’s not easy to study art and it’s certainly not easy to teach art. Some of this is because making art is at the same time intensely personal and extremely public. But it is also because in order to make art that is powerful, an artist has to challenge, dissemble and break down prevailing concepts, forms, tastes and, even, attitudes. When you do this, it’s easy to feel lost, without an anchor, like you no longer know what a line does, how color functions, or how time moves. This can be scary but it is also extremely exciting.\n\nMy favorite moment of teaching is when I am in the studio with an artist looking at something they just made or in a class critique with a newly finished work and none of us, at first, can fully comprehend what we are looking at. Slowly, in collective effort, we offer observations, words, phrases, sentences that allow us all to absorb their proposal and, in so doing, we are led to a deeper and wider vocabulary, to new fields of discourse, to sharpened tools, skills and methodologies and to expansive ways of being in the world.\n\nWho are your touchstones, creatively—the artists or elders who inform your practice?\n\nAt UCLA, where I went to grad school, I worked with the artist Mary Kelly. I hadn’t studied art as an undergraduate. I came to art via theatrically-based performance which I did in the mid to late ‘90s in the downtown dance, theater and performance scene in NYC. It was through Mary’s teaching and in my relationship with her and her practice that I learned so much of what has become important to me about the relationship between fields of discourse and fields of art making, about exhibition practice, being an “ethical witness” to an artwork and about art that takes an active relationship to politics or political movements, specifically feminism and queerness. She has been deeply influential to my practice as both an artist and a teacher.\n\nYour work often engages with the creation, or assemblage, of queer histories; to what extent, if any, do you consider yourself to be an activist? Are there inherent tensions, in your mind, between the practices of activism and art-making?"
