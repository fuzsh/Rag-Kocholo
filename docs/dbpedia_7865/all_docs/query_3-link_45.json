        "text": "Office sought: Attorney General\n\nPolitical party: Democrat\n\nEducation: Princeton University, B.S. Engineering, magna cum laude;\n\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Wharton School, M.B.A., Marketing; and\n\nUniversity of Chicago Law School, J.D.\n\nFamily: Two adult children: David and Leslie\n\nWebsite: sharonfairley.com\n\nSocial Media sites: facebook.com/fairleyforag; twitter.com/fairleyforag\n\nWhat makes you the best candidate for this office?\n\nMy personal, educational, and professional experiences distinguish me from the other candidates in this race and demonstrate how uniquely qualified I am to serve as Attorney General.\n\nI hold an undergraduate degree from Princeton University in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering, with high honors, an M.B.A. from The Wharton School, and a law degree from the University of Chicago. These educational achievements reflect important personal characteristics: courage, intellectual curiosity, and problem-solving ability.\n\nMy legal training and expertise is more comprehensive than other candidates, most of whom have not had experience that spans criminal, civil, and administrative proceedings.\n\nThe legal expertise I gained as a federal prosecutor is directly relevant to the attorney general’s litigation and enforcement responsibilities. Unlike the other former federal prosecutors in this race, my prosecutorial experience covers a broad array of criminal matters including narcotics and firearms trafficking, violent crimes, financial crimes, complex fraud, counter-terrorism and counter-espionage cases.\n\nAs First Deputy Inspector General and General Counsel for the Office of the Inspector General, I gained experience rooting out government corruption and waste.\n\nAs the Chief Administrator of the Civilian Office of Police Accountability and its predecessor agency, the Independent Police Review Authority, I gained valuable expertise in police reform and police accountability. In this role, I also demonstrated the independence and courage to hold the powerful accountable. Most importantly, I not only have experience leading an agency responsible for complex legal matters, I actually built one from the ground up.\n\nIf elected what would be your top priority, and how would you champion it?\n\nI believe the top three priorities of the office should be:\n\n1) To use the law and power of the office to protect the civil rights, health and well-being of Illinois residents and its resources from exploitative, corrupt and unconstitutional practices of government and corporate actors;\n\n2) To provide effective and diligent representation for state government and Illinois residents in all matters;\n\n3) To provide advice and counsel on important issues that affect our daily lives and to advocate for effective resolutions that consistently represent the best interests of Illinois residents.\n\nBecause there are certain duties of the office that are statutorily required, such as representation of the state and state agencies, these responsibilities must always be met. Where the attorney general has the discretion to align resources with critical needs, I would focus first on protecting the health and well-being of residents through effective enforcement of state law, the Illinois Constitution and the U.S. Constitution. My goal will be to level the playing field for individuals and businesses so they have equal access to educational and economic opportunities, the justice system, and a healthy, safe environment in which to lead their daily lives.\n\nWhere are you on the legalization of marijuana?\n\nI support the legalization of marijuana so long as we are careful about regulating its use and distribution so as to ensure public safety.\n\nAs attorney general, I would provide guidance to the legislature and law enforcement based on the best practices established by the handful of states that have already fully legalized marijuana.\n\nHow can your office help ensure governments across the state provide the public with information that is supposed to be accessible?\n\nThe people have a right to know what business is being conducted on their behalf. Public officials have a duty and responsibility to be as transparent as possible, such that citizens have confidence their government is being managed with integrity. The office of the Public Access Counselor is responsible for assisting the state in deciding disputes concerning government records requests. The mission of the PAC is \"to help people obtain public documents and access public meetings.\" The PAC is responsible for defending and interpreting requests for review under FOIA and OMA. In recent years, the PAC has received a steadily increasing number of requests for review. Yet, the PAC only has a staff of 14 lawyers and a budget of less than $1 million, and has a backlog of requests.\n\nDefending and interpreting FOIA and OMA are essential functions of the attorney general’s office. FOIA and OMA are the cornerstones for building transparent and accountable governments. As attorney general, I will ensure the PAC is properly funded and staffed, and fight to keep government open, transparent and accessible.\n\nEarlier this year, I released a comprehensive proposal on government integrity, reform and transparency that includes my priority to continue to work toward open and transparent Illinois government and ensure government agencies meet their obligations under the Freedom of Information and Open Meetings Acts.\n\nWhat role can and should the Attorney General’s office play in fighting public corruption?\n\nFederal prosecutors play an important role in the fight against government corruption, but we cannot rely on the federal government alone to deliver the oversight our state needs. All too often, the state’s attorneys lack the resources, expertise, or political will to bring criminal corruption cases against political actors. Moreover, many municipalities lack oversight bodies that have the resources and expertise to investigate political corruption. The attorney general’s grand jury authority most definitely should be expanded to include the investigation and prosecution of corrupt acts committed by local, county, and state government workers.\n\nThe following are some additional ways in which the office can play a more proactive role in rooting out and prosecuting government corruption:\n\n● Work to introduce revisions to the statute governing the Illinois Legislative Ethics Commission and Legislative Inspector General\n\n● Establish and publicize a complaint line for individuals to call to report allegations of misconduct by public officials or government agency employees\n\n● Coordinate with the state’s attorneys to ensure that any public corruption and police misconduct prosecutions in which the state’s attorney has a conflict of interest are referred to the office for prosecution to the extent permissible by law\n\n● Work with law enforcement to establish a statewide public integrity task force to ensure that local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies can coordinate activities and share strategies and tactics for investigating public corruption matters\n\nDo you favor the Trust Act, or would you work to repeal it?\n\nThe AG should continue to support the rights of sanctuary cities and continue to advise Illinois Law Enforcement on their obligations under the Illinois Trust Act. She should also act swiftly when local municipalities violate the TRUST Act.\n\nWhat else would you like to share about yourself with voters?\n\nThe attorney general is a lawyer who must truly represent the people of Illinois. She must advocate for those whose voices have been silenced or drowned out by the profound imbalance of power and resources in our state, which only widens as our political leaders become ever more entrenched and susceptible to the influence of the wealthy and special interest groups.\n\nI was born into the age of Jim Crow. I have seen “For Whites Only” signs over water fountains. I was a young girl during the race riots of the 1960s. During the 1970s, when the Women’s Movement was in full swing, I was a young woman finding my voice in this world. I started my professional life in the 1980s, when women were still rare in many professional arenas. As a woman of color who has spent the last 30+ years in male-dominated work environments, I have experienced sexual harassment, I have been underpaid, and I have been asked to wait my turn for the next promotion opportunity. I have been ignored, patronized, and marginalized. Yet, through hard work and perseverance, I have fought to defend myself and the people I represented as a lawyer. I have learned the power of my voice. And I will always use it in support of justice.\n\nThe people of our state need an attorney general who has the courage and fortitude to stand strong and fight for those who don’t have the power or resources to defend themselves."
