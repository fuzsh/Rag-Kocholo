        "text": "THE NATIONAL ACADEMIES\n\nNational Academy of Sciences\n\nNational Academy of Engineering\n\nInstitute of Medicine\n\nNational Research Council\n\nThe National Academy of Sciences is a private, nonprofit, self-perpetuating society of distinguished scholars engaged in scientific and engineering research, dedicated to the furtherance of science and technology and to their use for the general welfare. Upon the authority of the charter granted to it by the Congress in 1863, the Academy has a mandate that requires it to advise the federal government on scientific and technical matters. Dr. Bruce M. Alberts is president of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe National Academy of Engineering was established in 1964, under the charter of the National Academy of Sciences, as a parallel organization of outstanding engineers. It is autonomous in its administration and in the selection of its members, sharing with the National Academy of Sciences the responsibility for advising the federal government. The National Academy of Engineering also sponsors engineering programs aimed at meeting national needs, encourages education and research, and recognizes the superior achievements of engineers. Dr. Wm. A. Wulf is president of the National Academy of Engineering.\n\nThe Institute of Medicine was established in 1970 by the National Academy of Sciences to secure the services of eminent members of appropriate professions in the examination of policy matters pertaining to the health of the public. The Institute acts under the responsibility given to the National Academy of Sciences by its congressional charter to be an adviser to the federal government and, upon its own initiative, to identify issues of medical care, research, and education. Dr. Kenneth I. Shine is president of the Institute of Medicine.\n\nThe National Research Council was organized by the National Academy of Sciences in 1916 to associate the broad community of science and technology with the Academy’s purposes of furthering knowledge and advising the federal government. Functioning in accordance with general policies determined by the Academy, the Council has become the principal operating agency of both the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering in providing services to the government, the public, and the scientific and engineering communities. The Council is administered jointly by both Academies and the Institute of Medicine. Dr. Bruce M. Alberts and Dr. Wm. A. Wulf are chairman and vice chairman, respectively, of the National Research Council.\n\nPreface\n\nIn assessing the conclusions of any report on a subject as controversial as agricultural biotechnology, I certainly would want to know about the background of the individuals who wrote the report, and the process used to write it. So before you delve into the contents of this report I would like to tell you about our committee and the process that we used in writing this report. “About the Authors” provides background information on each of the 12 committee members who wrote the report. The committee followed the general National Research Council guidelines for report writing, with more specific steps in the process determined by the committee members. This report is a consensus document. Therefore, every member of the committee had an opportunity to question the content of each page, and in the end had to determine that he or she could consent to all of the report findings and recommendations. Had any committee member written the report alone, the conclusions would have been different. Some view this as a weakness of the consensus process—too much compromise. Based on my experience with this specific report, I strongly disagree with that perspective. What I saw in our consensus process was that logic and detailed information prevailed. It was easy for us to come to consensus on some issues but in other cases there were lengthy debates. In the approximately 15 months from the time of our first meeting until we finally signed off on the report, members of the committee had time to present specific arguments on multiple occasions with the opportunity to collect data to back up their arguments in between meetings or conference calls. Evidence to me of the success of our\n\nspecific consensus process is that a report written by a single member of our committee would have been substantially different before and after he or she had gone through the study process. We learned a lot from each other, and the report reflects this enhanced pool of knowledge.\n\nThe report clearly was the product of the committee, but there were a number of other important inputs. A workshop was convened by the committee to obtain input from scientists working on novel plant traits, from individuals with special expertise in regulation of transgenic plants, and from members of public interest groups (Appendix A). We also sent a letter to nearly 400 selected individuals and groups to solicit input (Appendix C). The letter specifically probed for unique perspectives on potential environmental impacts of transgenic plants. We received 35 useful, individual responses to this letter (copies available from NRC). In addition, members of the committee met with APHIS personnel and representatives from industry and public interest groups. All of these meetings were followed up by written communications to ensure that the information gathered from these meetings was accurate. The draft of our report was reviewed in detail by 12 individuals approved by the NRC’s Report Review Committee in order to provide distinct expertise and perspectives on the topics covered. The comments from the reviewers were given thorough consideration by the committee, and the Report Review Committee of the NRC assessed the revised draft before our report was accepted for publication.\n\nYou will read many findings and recommendations in this report. I would like to highlight a few of them that reflect on the nature of the issues addressed, and on the study process. During the initial meetings of our committee it became apparent that there was a need to examine the environmental risks of transgenic plants within the context of environmental risks posed by the entire modern agricultural enterprise. Our assessment confirmed the general findings of others that many agricultural practices have substantial negative environmental impacts. Additionally, we found that the current standards used by the federal government to assure environmental safety of transgenic plants were higher than the standards used in assuring safety of other agricultural practices and technologies. After much discussion of this finding we did not conclude that the standards for transgenics were too high. We found that over the past 70 years there has been growing concern about the impacts of agriculture on the environment and that, in general, agricultural technologies introduced many years ago have not been as carefully scrutinized as newer technologies. Therefore, in the future, it will be important to reconsider the standards that are being used to examine environmental effects of older technologies such as conventional plant breeding.\n\nDeliberations among our committee members—most of whom were biologists—led to a consensus that effective environmental risk analysis and management must consider both biological and social factors. While risk of environmental effects can be defined simply as a multiple of hazard and exposure, the measurement of both hazard and exposure involves a complex blend of ecological and social factors. This is in part because the value of every organism and habitat is based on its ecosystem, economic, and cultural functions. The recent assessment of risks to monarch butterflies from transgenic corn exemplifies these interactions. From a purely ecological perspective, decline in monarch butterfly populations is not, a priori, expected to be more environmentally disruptive than the decline in a randomly selected species of ground beetle. However, appropriate risk analyses for these two species should differ because of the role of the monarch butterfly in American culture. While ecologists must insist on careful examination of environmental risk to all species, decision makers cannot ignore other factors.\n\nOne general finding of the committee was that a rigorous scientific risk analysis has two roles: 1) it offers essential technical information to the agencies charged with making decisions about commercializing a transgenic plant; 2) it also serves as evidence to the public that the decision-making agencies are deserving of their trust. This second role is not fully appreciated in many cases. The more clearly an agency can explain the rigor of its methods, and the more engaged it becomes in responding to the public, the more likely it is to gain the public’s confidence.\n\nThe report of our committee does not paint a simple black and white picture of transgenic plant regulation by USDA-APHIS personnel. As stated in the report, our committee took on the role of searching for problems, and recommended changes “as a means to help improve a functioning system.” I hope that members of the press and other organizations will not yield to the temptation of focusing only on our finding that environmental standards for transgenic plants are higher than those for other agricultural technologies, or only on our findings that suggest the need for improvement in environmental regulation of transgenic plants.\n\nI want to thank the entire committee for their diligence and perseverance in examining mountains of background documents, and for writing and rewriting the pieces of this report. I am proud of the committee members for their willingness to argue forcefully, and for their ability to listen carefully to the perspectives of others. Without this combination of traits it would have been impossible to develop this consensus document. Special thanks go to Drs. Norman Ellstrand, David Andow, Bernd Blossey, and Paul Thompson for their leadership roles with the major organizing and writing responsibilities. External reviewers substantially improved"
