        "text": "Healthcare is most effective when it is personalized.\n\nDr. Bergquist loves working one-on-one with a patient to find the diagnostic and treatment plan that matches an individual’s needs and preferences.\n\nWhen she’s not seeing patients, she’s busy finding new ways to boost wellness and make that information accessible. Dr. Bergquist, a Rollins Senior Distinguished Clinician, is Assistant Director of Research at the Seavey Clinic. She investigates the impact of lifestyle factors on health and how people can make sustainable changes that will benefit their wellbeing. She broadcasts valuable wellness advice across a variety of platforms, including online courses on Coursera, and hosting a podcast called The Whole Health Cure.\n\nPurpose drives motivation, which fuels healthy habits. The goal of caring for yourself and staying healthy is to be able to give more of yourself to the things that matter to you. “To be effective to the people you love,” she says, “you have to embrace whole health—purpose-driven health choices that align your habits with your goals.”\n\nShe follows that advice at the Seavey Clinic, which enables her to thrive by giving her the time, space, and resources to explore her mission and compassion. With this support, she is building on her expertise in diabetes and heart disease prevention and management, nutrition and obesity counseling, women’s health, and the management of mood disorders, including depression. Making new discoveries are her investment in the future wellness of society.\n\n“The timeline with discovering research breakthroughs is longer than improving the direct care of a patient, but it leaves a legacy,” she says. “The next generation can build on what you leave behind.”\n\nDr. Bergquist’s devotion has earned her respect and multiple titles. She is the medical director for Emory’s Executive Health Program; founder and director of Emory Lifestyle Medicine & Wellness; master clinician; and associate professor of medicine in the Division of General Medicine and Geriatrics at Emory University School of Medicine.\n\nShe has been recognized repeatedly for her exceptional clinical service and has received the coveted honor of being named one of Atlanta’s top doctors by Atlanta Magazine multiple years.\n\nMost gratifying to her, however, is changing our culture towards wellness and making a difference in as many lives as possible. “My mission is to get to a tipping point where making a healthy choice is the easy choice,” she says. “Our everyday choices have the potential to help us live healthier and longer lives. And who wouldn’t enjoy that?”"
