        "text": "Sharon Wolf is an expert in child development and how early family and school environments affect learning outcomes. She studies the links between poverty, social policies, education, and child development through experimental and quasi-experimental methods. This work includes assessing the role high-quality education plays in bolstering development for children who face adversity.\n\nResearch Interests and Current Projects\n\nDr. Wolf’s work focuses on three primary areas: developing and evaluating interventions to improve educational quality and child learning outcomes; the measurement of educational settings and children’s learning outcomes; and understanding the links between poverty, education, and child development.\n\nDr. Wolf has worked with Ministry of Education in Ghana to improve the quality of their universal kindergarten education system by helping teachers implement child-centered, play-based learning teaching practices. In partnership with Innovations for Poverty Action and academic collaborators at Penn and NYU, she developed and evaluated a scalable model for in-service teacher training and a parental awareness program delivered through school parent-teacher associations, and evaluated a pre-service training model for kindergarten student teachers."
