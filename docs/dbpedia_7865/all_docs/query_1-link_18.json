        "text": "Sharon-Lise Normand, Ph.D., is S. James Adelstein Professor of Health Care Policy (Biostatistics) in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School and Professor in the Department of Biostatistics at the Harvard School of Public Health. Dr. Normand’s research focuses on the development of statistical methods for health services and outcomes research, primarily using Bayesian approaches, including the evaluation of medical devices in randomized and non-randomized settings for pre- and post-market assessments, causal inference, provider profiling, evidence synthesis, item response theory, and latent variables analyses. Her application areas include cardiovascular disease, severe mental illness, medical device safety and effectiveness, and medical technology diffusion. Dr. Normand is Director of the Medical Device Epidemiology Network’s (MDEpiNet) Methodology Center where statistical methodology for assessing medical device safety and effectiveness is developed and applied. She was Director of Mass-DAC, a data coordinating center that monitored the quality of all adult cardiac surgeries and coronary interventions in all Massachusetts’ acute care hospitals (2002-2017). She was a consultant to the US Food and Drug Administration’s Circulatory System Devices Advisory Panel after serving a four-year term on the panel, and served as a member of the Medicare Evidence Development and Coverage Advisory Committee for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Dr. Normand was the 2010 President of the Eastern North American Region of the International Biometrics Society and the first Vice Chair of the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute’s Methodology Committee (2010-2012). She earned her Ph.D. in Biostatistics from the University of Toronto, holds a Masters of Science as well as a Bachelor of Science degree in Statistics, and completed a post-doctoral fellowship in Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School. She is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, a Fellow of the American College of Cardiology, a Fellow of the American Heart Association, and an Associate of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons. In 2011, Dr. Normand was awarded the American Statistical Association Health Policy Statistics Section’s Long Term Excellence Award; in 2012, the American Heart Association’s Distinguished Scientist Award; in 2013 elected to the Society for Research Synthesis Methodology; in 2015, awarded the L. Adrienne Cupples Award for Excellence in Teaching, Research, and Service in Biostatistics from Boston University; in 2017, awarded the American Heart Association Council on Quality of Care and Outcomes Research Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award; in 2018, awarded Mosteller Statistician of the Year by the American Statistical Association Boston Chapter; and in 2019, elected Fellow to the American Association for the Advancement of Science.\n\n2015\n\nL.
