The critique papers are due each Thursday.\n\nOnline, if required, through the Canvas Website and ZOOM: If Stanford designates spring quarter for online only classes, this course will be given via ZOOM, accessible to Stanford affiliates on Tuesday and registered students on Thursdays. If distance learning is required for an individual(s), the faculty will arrange either ZOOM class sessions or an individual discussion after a student has read the lecture presentation and assigned paper each week. Every effort will be made to make the course content and discussions available to all students.\n\nCourse Status as an Elective: This course can serve as an elective course for Biology Ph.D. candidates in the CMOB track for the following areas: Cell Biology, Genetic and Genomics, or the Biology of Molecules. This course can also serve as an upper division biology elective for undergraduates.\n\nAudience: Graduate students at any level, co-term and upper-level undergraduate students with permission of instructor. Highly recommended for undergraduates doing research in plant biology.\n\nEnrollment Cap: 20\n\nPrerequisites: For graduate students, no prerequisites. For undergraduates, at least one of the following: Bio82 (Genetics), Bio86 (Cell Biology), Bio84 (Physiology), or ongoing research in a Stanford or Carnegie plant biology laboratory.\n\nClass prep help: For all enrolled students, five types of support will be provided beyond the class\n\n1) A pre-class zoom session to provide an overview and resources on how the Thurs journal club sessions will be structured, what a journal club is, and have students sign up for presentations. Recording available here Passcode: d6#HC8^v\n\n2) A pre-journal club session by zoom on Wednesdays for the paper that will be discussed on the following day to go over the week’s paper and answer any questions: zoom link Password: 074620\n\n3) One-on-one meetings by arrangement with students, especially undergraduates, who want help preparing their journal club presentations. Book here\n\n4) We will be using the \"Discussions\" section of the Canvas site for people to pose questions or bring up things that they may not be familiar with. Please feel free to put up Qs as you read the papers or listen to the lectures. This will be mostly peer-based forum.\n\n5) We will use a Google slide deck for people to upload their slides for their presentations\n\nAuditing: Freshmen and Sophomores as well as TGR graduate students can audit lecture classes on Tuesdays. Other Stanford affiliates are invited to attend up to the room capacity seating.\n\nTextbook (optional): The Botany Coloring Book – why not have fun learning the names of plant structures! About $22 at the bookstore or online.\n\nDescription and learning outcomes: This course will serve as a primer for all levels of graduate, co-term, and upper-level undergraduates interested in learning the fundamental principles of plant biology as well as the latest advances in tools, techniques, and theories that link basic science with translational science and applications for solving major societal challenges of today and tomorrow. Topics include plant evolution, genetics, breeding, plant-immune signaling, plant-environment interactions, tissue and organ development, metabolism, and systems and synthetic biology.\n\nOverall learning goals: Students will learn major concepts and methods in plant biology and gain the tools and resources to research the literature more independently and deeply. In addition, students will learn fundamental ways that plants are different from animals and microbes. In each module, students will learn major concepts and skills from lectures and primary literature discussions. Students will also learn how to write a succinct critique of research papers and to analyze/present scientific papers to the class.\n\nClass activities: There will be one lecture and one paper discussion class meeting each week. The discussion class is structured like a journal club, where individual students will lead discussions on specific sections of the paper. All students will write a 1-page critique of the paper and submit it before class (via Canvas online or as a printout at the start of Thursday discussions); faculty will provide feedback on composition and content. The Carnegie Spring Quarter Seminar Series will include speakers highly relevant to this class. Students are encouraged to attend, Fridays 4 – 5 pm at Carnegie Institution for Science (260 Panama St, Stanford) with a special session after each talk for students to interact with the speaker.\n\nTopics:\n\nModule 1 (Weeks 1-3): Plant Genetics, Genomics, and Evolution (Exposito-Alonso, Walbot)\n\nModule 2 (Weeks 4-6): Plant Cell Signaling, Development, and Physiology (Mudgett, Dinneny, Bergmann)\n\nModule 3 (Weeks 7-9): Plant Metabolism, Systems, and Synthetic Biology (Rhee, Brophy)\n\nDate\n\nInstructors (Teaching)\n\nTopic/Papers/Learning Goals\n\n*Stanford or Carnegie contribution\n\nMar 29 9:45-11:15am\n\nExposito-Alonso\n\nPlant evolution: Introduction of plant macro- and micro- evolution from geological times to the Anthropocene.

We will explore protein structural biology and biochemistry studies revealing the molecular mechanisms of host-pathogen recognition, defense signaling and homeostasis, and disease resistance execution. The focus will be on protein structure-based insights to intracellular immune receptor (NLR) activation and downstream signaling leading to a host response called effector-triggered immunity (ETI). The remarkable surprise uncovered in these studies points to a new mechanistic understanding of calcium signaling and homeostasis.\n\nApr 21\n\n9:45-11:15am\n\nMudgett\n\nLiterature: A classic review on plant disease resistance proteins provides content for the discovery of the relevant genes and the ideas of researchers at the time for their putative function. The meeting review provides an overview of the most recent findings in this area. Two primary literature articles provide key functional data. Background information for ZAR1 and NRG1 can be found in the cited references.\n\nClassic review: Staskawicz, B. J., Ausubel, F. M., Baker, B. J., Ellis, J. G., and Jones, J. D. G. 1995.
