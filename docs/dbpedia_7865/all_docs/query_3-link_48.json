        "text": "WAREHOUSE\n\nGeffen Contemporary at MOCA\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nJune 14–23, 2024\n\nConcept and Direction: Yuval Sharon\n\nMusic (The Comet): George Lewis\n\nLibretto: Douglas Kearney\n\nMusic (L'incoronazione di Poppea): Claudio Monteverdi\n\nLibretto: Giovanni Francesco Busenello\n\nMusic Director: Marc Lowenstein\n\nScenic Designer: Mimi Lien\n\nLighting Designer: John Torres\n\nCostume Designer: Oana Botez\n\nSound Designer: Mark Grey\n\nDramaturgy: Robert Gooding-Williams and Wendy Heller\n\nThe Comet / Poppea brings together seemingly disparate worlds connected by stories of cultural transformation. The work juxtaposes Claudio Monteverdi’s L’incoronazione di Poppea (The Coronation of Poppea), an Italian opera from 1643 unfolding among the social divisions of ancient Rome; and the world premiere of The Comet, based on the 1920 science-fiction short story by sociologist and Pan-Africanist civil rights activist W.E.B. Du Bois. Set in 1920s New York City, “The Comet” depicts a Black man and white woman as the only survivors after a comet hits Earth.\n\nPresented on a turntable divided in two halves, these worlds unfold simultaneously, with the stage’s rotation creating a visual and sonic spiral for audiences—inviting associations, dissociations, collisions, and confluences.\n\nPhotography by Austin Richey, Courtesy MOCA and The Industry.\n\nMusic by John Cage\n\nGem Theatre\n\nDetroit Opera\n\nDetroit, Michigan\n\nMarch 8-10, 2024\n\nDirector: Yuval Sharon\n\nProduction Designer: Moníka Essen\n\nLighting Designer: Yuki Nakase Link\n\nAssociate Director: Alexander Gedeon\n\nWhereas John Cage’s first opera, Europeras 1 & 2, attempted to replicate the spectacle of grand opera through the collage-like lens of indeterminacy, Europeras 3 & 4 saw the composer explore the genre on a much smaller scale—though no less idiosyncratically. Europera 3, composed for a relatively restrained ensemble of six singers, two pianos, six gramophones, tape, and lighting, takes on the appearance of a chamber opera. Europera 4 dials the scale back further, with its forces of two singers, one piano, one gramophone, and table lamp evoking a song recital.\n\nIn a reflection of this intimate setting—and in order to advance Detroit Opera’s mission to bring opera out of the opera house and into the Detroit community—Yuval Sharon elected to stage Europeras 3 & 4 in the cabaret-like Gem Theatre, the first live theatrical performances at the historic venue in nearly twelve years. Like the other compositions in the series, Europeras 3 & 4 call for music to be dictated by chance, and sets, props, and costumes to be procured from the presenting company’s archives. The result was an unrepeatable living artwork composed of familiar, interwoven arias and musical cues, juxtaposed against one another in new musical and visual contexts that invited audience members to find as much—or as little—meaning as they desired.\n\nPhotography by Austin Richey courtesy of Detroit Opera.\n\nMusic by Claudio Monteverdi\n\nLibretto by Alessandro Striggio\n\nSanta Fe Opera\n\nSanta Fe, New Mexico\n\nJuly 29-August 24, 2023\n\nOrchestration: Nico Muhly (World Premiere)\n\nConductor: Harry Bicket\n\nDirector: Yuval Sharon\n\nVisual Environment Designer: Matthew Johnson and Alex Schweder\n\nLighting Designer: Yuki Nakase Link\n\nProjection Designer: Hana S. Kim\n\nSound Designer: Mark Grey\n\nCostume Designer: Carlos J. Soto\n\nYuval Sharon made his Santa Fe Opera company debut with a new production of Claudio Monteverdi's 1607 opera Orfeo. Commonly regarded as the oldest surviving opera, Orfeo tells the timeless story of the legendary musician's descent into Hades to win back the life of his deceased bride. Harry Bicket conducted the world premiere of Nico Muhly's orchestration, which updates Monteverdi's Baroque-era instrumentation.\n\nSharon's Orfeo united innovative stagecraft, practical effects, and the physical environment itself to advance the drama of the opera. In an effort to portray the two worlds of Orfeo, while accounting for the theater's lack of a proscenium, Sharon aimed for a staging that would allow both to flourish onstage seamlessly. Finding inspiration in astronomical devices of antiquity such as the astrolabe, Sharon's team devised a solution: one single set piece that can open and close to reveal a hidden underworld, the movements of which are inextricably connected to the world of the living above.\n\nSharon’s production also invokes another major element of the opera: music itself. As both a character and a major driver of the action, music takes center stage in Orfeo; Sharon sought ways to bring it to life in the set that reflected its pervasive presence in the opera. Using projections and mist, Sharon’s Orfeo gives form to music by visualizing the air that carries it. In doing so, he also evokes Orfeo’s travels through a land beyond human comprehension.\n\nPhotography by Richard Barnes.\n\nThe Walkers\n\nComposed by Daniel Bernard Roumain with libretto by Anna Deavere Smith.\n\nFour Portraits\n\nComposed by Caroline Shaw with libretto by Caroline Shaw and Jocelyn Clarke.\n\nNight\n\nComposed by John Luther Adams with libretto by John Haines.\n\nLyric Opera of Chicago\n\nChicago, Illinois\n\nMarch 24-April 8, 2023\n\nDirector: Yuval Sharon\n\nConductor: Kazem Abdullah\n\nProduction Designers: Jason H.

The Walkers, composed by Daniel Bernard Roumain with libretto by Anna Deavere Smith, uses field work and interviews to give voice to families grappling with gun violence in Chicago; Four Portraits, composed by Caroline Shaw with libretto by Jocelyne Clarke, interrogates the impact of technology on society and the human desire for connection; and Night, a setting of a text by the late poet John Haines composed by John Luther Adams, ruminates on the fragility of the natural world.\n\nSharon’s wold premiere production highlights the humanity and connection core to the piece, splicing and shuffling the three operas to create an entirely new work that zooms in and out from the scale of the individual to the community to the cosmic.\n\nEnhancing the three shuffled narratives is a stage design on a scale and complexity never before attempted in opera: a monumental curved quarter-pipe video wall, 40 feet wide by 26 feet high, made of 140 LED panels and 240 black marble LED panels, designed by Jason H. Thompson and Kaitlyn Pietras. Complemented by a robust on-set system of responsive cameras and other interactive features, the set design for Proximity affords audiences a new immersive way to experience opera.\n\nPhotography provided courtesy of Lyric Opera.\n\nDie Walküre (Act III)\n\nMusic by Richard Wagner\n\nHollywood Bowl\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nJuly 17, 2022\n\nAdditional performances at Detroit Opera House\n\nSeptember 17-20, 2022\n\nDirector: Yuval Sharon\n\nAssociate Director: Diana Wyenn\n\nProduction Designers: Jason H.

Beginning with a world built in Unreal Engine, a tool typically designed for the video game industry, Sharon worked with Thompson and Pietras to storyboard the piece, using VR headsets to place virtual cameras throughout the digital landscape as if he were a film director working on location. These virtual cameras—which can be automated, panned, and zoomed with all of the flexibility of a physical camera—work in conjunction with five robotic cameras which capture the performers from a variety of angles onstage in front of a 16-foot green-screen. As the performance unfolds onstage, the feed from the physical cameras and virtual cameras are then synthesized, with real-time video effects used to keep color grading consistent, and to help the performers blend into the virtual environment. The end result is a live film that exists dynamically with the onstage performance, while still being replicable on a shot-for-shot basis; audiences are free to watch the action on-stage and on projection screens simultaneously, considering the uneasy relationship between live performance and new media in opera’s future.\n\nPhotography courtesy of the LA Phil/Detroit Opera.\n\nMusic by Giacomo Puccini\n\nLibretto by Giuseppe Giacosa and Luigi Illica\n\nDetroit Opera House\n\nDetroit, Michigan\n\nApril 6-12, 2022\n\nCo-produced with Boston Lyric Opera and Spoleto Festival USA\n\nDirector: Yuval Sharon\n\nSet Designer: John Conklin\n\nLighting Designer: John Torres\n\nCostume Designer: Jessica Jahn\n\nConductor: Roberto Kalb\n\nPremiered at Detroit Opera in 2022, and with further performances at Spoleto Festival USA, Opera Philadelphia, and Boston Lyric Opera, Sharon’s La bohème casts familiar elements in a new light as he stages the work in reverse order from Act IV to Act I. In this new arrangement, Sharon reappraises the ways in which audiences and artists can interact with repertoire, bringing fresh eyes and ears to a classic while extracting hope from tragedy, life from death, and love from loneliness. The end result is an opera that begins with death and tragedy, but ends with a world of promise and potential amidst a new love—and an audience left not with the heaviness of inevitability, but with the notion that the pain was worth the fleeting moments of joy.\n\nIn order to keep the narrative of the reverse staging cohesive, Sharon introduces a new role: The Wanderer, portrayed in the premiere run by George Shirley. The Wanderer gives a spoken introduction to each act, helping the audience follow the reverse chronology of the story. In addition to his spoken introductions to each act, The Wanderer also appears in three new fourth-wall-breaking scenes; in each appearance, the action is put on hold as he asks the audience to consider which direction the story could have gone.\n\nPhotography by Austin Richey and Vesna Zdravkoski.\n\nDetroit Opera House Parking Center\n\nDetroit, Michigan\n\nOctober 17-20, 2020\n\nAdditional Performances at the Millennium Lakeside Parking Garage\n\nChicago, Illinois\n\nApril 28-May 2, 2021\n\nConcept, Direction, and English translation: Yuval Sharon\n\nWith new narrative poetry: Marsha Music (Detroit) and Avery R.

Equal parts drive-in theater and opera house event, Twilight: Gods gives audience members the opportunity to watch Wagner’s drama unfold scene-by-scene from the safety of their cars, while the live performance (sung in English) is broadcast to car stereos—a full immersion in the world of the Ring.\n\nTwilight: Gods is a collaboration between Michigan Opera Theatre and Lyric Opera of Chicago\n\nPhotography provided courtesy of Detroit Opera House.\n\nLos Angeles State Historic Park\n\nWorld Premiere by The Industry\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nFebruary 29-March 15, 2020\n\nDirectors: Cannupa Hanska Luger and Yuval Sharon\n\nMusic: Du Yun and Raven Chacon\n\nLibretto: Douglas Kearney and Aja Couchois Duncan\n\nhttps://theindustryla.org/sweet-land-opera/\n\nThe latest piece from LA’s The Industry, Sweet Land brings together composers Raven Chacon and Du Yun, librettists Aja Couchois Duncan and Douglas Kearney, and co-directors Cannupa Hanska Luger and Yuval Sharon. Together, they spin separate but interconnected narratives that re-imagine the founding of America and westward expansion in order to make visible the violence and erasure of American history.\n\nSweet Land weaves together several narratives simultaneously, opening with the arrival of a settler-colonial civilization—titled the “Arrivals”—in the home of an indigenous civilization, known as the “Hosts.” From here, the audience diverges into two distinct paths: a feast and a train. The feast imagines the first meeting of the \"Host\" community and \"Arrival\" community. The train imagines the “Arrivals” embarking on an uncompromising westward expansion, and its violent effect on people, land, and animals. As the story unfolds, the audience is guided through the physical space of the park; as it progresses, past scenes are left behind and erased, emulating the erasure of dissent against dominant historical narratives. As the audience revisits past scenes, they find them replaced with narratives that are whitewashed, heavily biased, and bear little resemblance to the truthful events on which they are based.\n\nCentral to the project is the diversity of its voices. Composer Raven Chacon is from the Navajo Nation and advocates for indigenous composers and musicians; he is a recent recipient of the Berlin Prize. Du Yun is a Chinese immigrant whose recent work is rooted in a lack of understanding and empathy around immigration. Her opera Angel’s Bone, which explores human trafficking, won the Pulitzer Prize for music. Librettist Aja Couchois Duncan is a mixed-race Ojibwe writer with a focus on social justice. Douglas Kearney is a poet whose writing, in the words of BOMB magazine, “pulls history apart, recombining it to reveal an alternative less whitewashed by enfranchised power.” Co-director Cannupa Hanksa Luger is a multi-disciplinary installation artist of Mandan, Hidatsa, Arikara, Lakota, Austrian, and Norwegian descent.\n\nPhotography by Casey Kringlen.\n\nMusic by Meredith Monk\n\nLos Angeles Philharmonic\n\nWalt Disney Concert Hall\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nJune 11-14, 2019\n\nLA Phil New Music Group\n\nConductor: Paolo Bortolameolli\n\nMusic Coach: Katie Geissinger\n\nMusic Advisor: Wayne Hankin\n\nDirector: Yuval Sharon\n\nArtistic Advisor: Meredith Monk\n\nDesigner: Es Devlin\n\nProjection Designer: Luke Halls\n\nChoreographer: Danielle Agami\n\nCostume Designer: Emma Kingsbury\n\nLighting Designer: John Torres\n\nSound Designer: Mark Grey\n\nInspired by the life of explorer Alexandra David-Néel, Meredith Monk’s three-act “quest opera” uses Monk’s inimitable and hypnotic style to explore the loss and rediscovery of our inherent wonder. More than 20 years after ATLAS first made its impact, Yuval Sharon conceived and directed this landmark new production at Monk’s request, the first outside director of any of the composer’s works.\n\nRather than depicting a literal globe-trotting quest, Sharon’s ATLAS takes Alexandra on a metaphorical journey through her artistic imagination. This is portrayed through a hand-drawn aesthetic, representing Alexandra’s self-exploration through her own art. Coming full circle with the source material, Sharon’s Alexandra lightly parallels the life of Gautama Buddha; stifled and sheltered by a well-meaning family and comfortable suburban life, Alexandra is drawn into a quest through inner-space, revealing elusive, lasting, and transformative truths about herself and the world.\n\nThe production is visually anchored by a stage sculpture designed by Es Devlin in the form of a large sphere. Serving as a projection screen, the sphere displays the hand-drawn internal world of Alexandra’s imagination, while the piece’s choreography—in which performers manually rotate and interact with it—legitimizes the connection between reality and imagination formed by Alexandra’s art.\n\nPhotography by Craig Matthew Imaging.\n\nMusic by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart\n\nLibretto by Emmanuel Shickaneder\n\nStaatsoper Unter den Linden\n\nBerlin, Germany\n\nPremiere February 17, 2019\n\nDirector: Yuval Sharon\n\nConductor: Alondra de la Parra\n\nSet Designer: Mimi Lien\n\nCostume Designer: Walter Van Beirendonck\n\nLighting Designer: Reinhard Traub\n\nVideo Designer: Hannah Wasileski\n\nSound Designer: Markus Böhm\n\nDramaturgy: Krystian Lada\n\nThis work, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart’s most famous opera by far, is also his most enigmatic. Prince Tamino falls in love with Pamina after only having seen a picture of her. But as her mother, the Queen of the Night, reports, Pamina is being held captive by Sarastro. At the queen’s behest, Tamino and his companion Papageno set off to free Pamina from Sarastro’s temple. But as soon as they arrive there, the question of which characters are good and which are evil arises. The only thing that seems clear is that Pamina returns Tamino’s affections, and in the end the two of them are united after difficult trials.\n\nFor 25 years, August Everding’s production of Die Zauberflöte has enchanted Staatsoper audiences of all ages. But now the time has come for Mozart’s complex masterpiece to be examined anew. And so American director Yuval Sharon carries away audiences to new worlds of images that are no less imaginative, yet aesthetically quite different from the previous production. At the heart of the production is the idea of a collage, analogous to that of Mozart’s music itself, oscillating constantly between the stylistic levels of singspiel and opera seria. Sharon, together with stage designer Mimi Lien and Belgian fashion designer Walter Van Beirendonck, takes this variety as an occasion to approach Mozart’s opera in a creatively playful and colorful way.\n\nPhotography by Monika Rittershaus.\n\nMusic by John Cage\n\nLos Angeles Philharmonic and The Industry\n\nSONY Pictures Studios\n\nCulver City, California\n\nNovember 6-11, 2018\n\nDirector: Yuval Sharon\n\nScenic Designer: John Lacovelli\n\nMusic Advisor: Marc Lowenstein\n\nLighting Designer: Chris Kuhl\n\nSound Designer: Jody Elff\n\nAssociate Director: Alexander Gedeon\n\nLA Phil New Music Group\n\nThe Industry\n\nCheekily titled Europeras—both a pun on “European operas” and “your operas”—John Cage’s first opera explodes the European opera repertoire into a collage of arias and duets, performed alongside a live orchestra and a pre-taped mix of 101 layered opera fragments. In keeping with the composer’s pioneering embrace of indeterminacy, the structure of the opera is entirely dictated by chance as a computer simulation of the I Ching selects which arias will be sung, where, and by whom. Further complicating matters is Cage’s requirement that the producing company pull costumes and props from its archives, creating a material counterpart to the collage of music, drama, and time. The end result is a shocking, humorous, and sometimes moving portrait not only of operatic history, but of the passage of time itself.\n\nWith much of the opera left to chance, Sharon’s 2018 production, a collaboration between his company The Industry and the LA Phil, turned to the location for inspiration, drawing upon Cage’s period as a student of Arnold Schoenberg. Whereas Schoenberg saw cinema as a successor to opera—an interplay of sound, drama, and visual art, recorded perfectly and able to be reproduced reliably time and time again—Cage instead saw the artform as the backbone of a uniquely American take on the genre. Pulling from this history, Sharon staged Europeras 1 & 2 in a Sony Pictures soundstage, using props and sets from films in place of the opera company archives called for in the score.\n\nPhotography provided courtesy of the the LA Phil/The Industry.\n\nMusic by Olga Neuwirth\n\nLibretto by Elfriede Jelinek\n\nAfter the film by David Lynch\n\nFrankfurt Opera\n\nBockenheimer Depot\n\nFrankfurt, Germany\n\nSeptember 2018\n\nDirector: Yuval Sharon\n\nConductor: Karsten Januschke\n\nSet, Video, and Lighting Designer: Jason H. Thompson\n\nLive Electronics: Markus Noisternig and Gilbert Nouno\n\nVideo: Norbert Ommer\n\nCostume Designer: Doey Lüthi\n\nDramaturgy: Stephanie Schulze\n\nThe Austrian composer Olga Neuwirth and German writer Elfriede Jelinek based this opera, first performed in 2003, on David Lynch's film, a fascinating combination of psychothriller, horror, and film noir. Throughout the \"case study of a person who cannot cope with his fate\" (Barry Gifford) runs very ambitious storytelling, which constantly leads to dead ends. Scene changes are feverish, time and space unstable, as are identities and sound worlds. Neuwirth's score is intermedial and full of complex notation: fadeouts are altered sound spaces, lavish live electronics and varied vocal expression are confronted with visual dimensions.\n\nSharon’s production both enhances the piece’s inherent sense of uneasy and layered non-reality and embraces its cinematic roots. Using a split stage, Sharon employs green screens to insert live singers into a projected video setting inspired by Lynch’s film. Joining them are actors dressed entirely in green fabric, whose visible actions within the “real” setting hold a mysterious influence on the “virtual” layer. The result is a piece as multidimensional and inscrutable as its source material, wrapped in a layer of illusion that Musical America called \"not only technically superb but astonishingly effective as theater.\"\n\nPhotography by Monika Rittershaus.\n\nMusic by Richard Wagner\n\nBayreuther Festspiele\n\nBayreuth, Germany\n\nPremiere July 25, 2018\n\nDirector: Yuval Sharon\n\nConductor: Christian Thielemann\n\nChoral Conductor: Eberhard Friedrich\n\nIn 2018, Yuval Sharon made history when he became the first American director to mount a production at the Bayreuth Festival: Wagner’s Lohengrin. This collaborative production saw Sharon join with artists Neo Rauch and Rosa Loy, whose stage and costume design washed the stage and cast in a fantastic, frosted blue into which the title character’s presence imbues a supernaturally bright electric spark.\n\nIn Sharon’s Lohengrin, Elsa is the troubled protagonist whose imprisonment does not end with Lohengrin’s arrival but is rather replaced with forced marriage to a controlling stranger. Likewise, Ortrud is not the face of a secret pagan threat scheming to undermine Christendom, but rather an oppressed freethinker imploring Elsa to exercise what remains of her free will. And Lohengrin, far from the traditional holy warrior fighting selflessly on behalf of an unjustly accused woman, is a master manipulator whose charisma nearly brings him to the seat of power.\n\nSharon establishes this dynamic through a series of subtle dramatic cues, culminating in a climactic scene in which Elsa, rather than falling dead after compromising her faith, walks off into an unknown future.\n\nPhotography provided courtesy of Bayreuther Festspiele.\n\nMusic by Annie Gosfield\n\nProduced by Los Angeles Philharmonic\n\nCo-produced by The Industry and NOW Art\n\nWalt Disney Concert Hall\n\nWorld Premiere\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nNovember 2017\n\nConcept, Direction, Text adaptation: Yuval Sharon\n\nConductor: Christopher Rountree\n\nProduction Designer: Calder Greenwood\n\nInspired by the disruption of consensus reality presented by the proliferation of fake news in the mid-2010s, and Orson Welles’s infamous 1938 radio drama of H.G. Wells’s The War of the Worlds—in which the actor delivered a pseudojournalistic account so convincing that some listeners earnestly believed that the Earth was being attacked— Yuval Sharon created a new opera adaptation of The War of the Worlds in 2017. Produced by The Industry, the LA Phil, and Now Art, and with music by Annie Gosfield, Sharon’s world premiere production eliminated the boundary between the concert hall and the streets of Los Angeles by expanding the action well beyond Walt Disney Concert Hall.\n\nIn a nod to Welles’s character—an on-air radio DJ whose between-song commentary becomes a play-by-play of the apocalypse—The War of the Worlds featured an intro and running commentary by Sigourney Weaver, portraying herself as the celebrity emcee of an LA Phil concert interrupted by an alien invasion. Speaking to audiences from the safety of Walt Disney Concert Hall, Weaver relayed reports from three other locations throughout Los Angeles, where alien destruction—represented by large-scale puppets and live aria performances—took place before audiences on the street. Using three defunct air raid sirens to broadcast the performance from within the hall, and the hall’s sound system to transmit arias from outside, War of the Worlds reimagined opera as a coordinated, city-wide happening.\n\nPhotography provided courtesy of the LA Phil.\n\nMusic by Claude Debussy\n\nLibretto by Maurice Maeterlinck\n\nCleveland Orchestra\n\nSeverance Music Center\n\nCleveland, Ohio\n\nMay 2017\n\nDirector: Yuval Sharon\n\nSet Designer: Mimi Lien\n\nVideo Designer: Jason H. Thompson\n\nChoreographer: Danielle Agami\n\nCostume Designer: Ann Closs-Farley\n\nConductor: Franz Welser-Möst\n\nDebussy’s only opera, Pelléas et Mélisande, is enigmatic in nearly every regard. Completely lacking in arias, with an “iridescent veil” of soft music set to the pace and cadence of the French language, it represented what Debussy conceived as a uniquely French take on opera: one that consciously rejects the Wagnerian form. Debussy’s sparse and puzzling libretto, which he adapted from a then-popular Symbolist play, charts an equally enigmatic drama: characters rarely, if ever, articulate their emotions or experiences, though much of the dramatic action takes place internally.\n\nSharon’s Pelléas embraces these qualities with an atmosphere rich in shadowy liminality, while a split stage forms a concrete division between the physical and emotional drama. In front and below lies the orchestra, from which the singers perform in isolation from one another on spotlit platforms. Above and behind is a large glass box designed by Mimi Lien, which is variously transparent, frosted, or filled with a loose, ephemeral mélange of fog and light. Within the box is a host of dancers, whose costumes at time mirror those of the singers: ethereal doubles whose interactions only highlight the incomprehensible existence of the protagonists themselves. In addition to the box, projections and several other technologies give the impression of a constantly shifting world surrounding the singer-actors.\n\nPhotography provided courtesy of The Cleveland Orchestra.\n\nCreated by The Industry\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nOctober-November 2015\n\nConcept and Direction: Yuval Sharon\n\nProduction Designer: Jason H.

With 24 cars, 126 diverse artists, six composers, six writers, and one unique architectural space where the entire piece was streamed for free, Hopscotch was a once-in-a-lifetime event.\n\nAn expansive recording of Hopscotch, now available on The Industry Records, showcases the diverse range of musical and theatrical ideas at the heart of the original production. The accompanying “Music of Hopscotch” concert, performed as part of USC’s Visions & Voices program in Newman Recital Hall January 2017, was a celebration of the contributions of the six composers while putting them in the context of the larger-scale narrative. This concert was preceded by an informative panel discussion of the creation and implementation of Hopscotch as well as reactions to the groundbreaking endeavor.\n\nPhotography provided courtesy of The Industry.\n\nOpera by Christopher Cerrone\n\nBased on the novel Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino\n\nProduced by The Industry and LA Dance Project\n\nUnion Station\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nOctober-November 2013\n\nDirector: Yuval Sharon\n\nLead Sound Designer: Nick Tipp\n\nSound Designer: E.

The audience experienced the live performance via Sennheiser wireless headphones, surrounded by the uninterrupted life of the station.\n\nBased on Italo Calvino’s beloved novel, Sharon's production of Christopher Cerrone's Invisible Cities immersed audiences in an unpredictable platform of everyday life, creating an “invisible” production that made each audience member the protagonist of the experience. With performers appearing and disappearing into the everyday fabric of the building, Sharon and choreographer Danielle Agami drew the audience into an uncannily intimate proximity to LA Dance Project and the singing ensemble.\n\nPhotography by Dana Ross, Lawrence K Ho, Joshua Lipton, Hank Leukart and Fred Prouser provided courtesy of The Industry and LA Dance Project.\n\nMusic by Anne LeBaron\n\nLibretto by Douglas Kearney\n\nProduced by The Industry\n\nAtwater Crossing\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nPremiere May 2012\n\nDirector: Yuval Sharon\n\nConductor: Marc Lowenstein\n\nProducer: Laura Kay Swanson\n\nCurator: Brianna Gorton\n\nVisual Artists: Mason Cooley, Brianna Gorton, Katie Grinnan, Alice Könitz, Jeff Kopp and Olga Koumoundouros\n\nSet Designer: Sibyl Wickersheimer\n\nLighting Designer: Elizabeth Harper\n\nProjection Designer: Jason H. Thompson\n\nSound Designer: Martin Gimenez\n\nCrescent City was the first production of The Industry and was instantly hailed as “changing the face of music-theater in this town overnight” (Out West Arts).\n\nThe opera tells the story of a mythical town loosely based on New Orleans. In the aftermath of Hurricane Belle, Crescent City is a lawless ghost town: marauding Revelers call the Junk Heap home, while drag queens, drug addicts, and a lone policeman try to survive. A disturbance in the air resurrects the voodoo queen Marie Laveau, who emerges from her tomb to discover that another hurricane threatens to destroy what little is left of Crescent City. She summons the voodoo gods and begs them to save the city. They agree to do so only if one good soul can be found remaining in the town. The opera becomes a travelogue, as the voodoo gods come down to search for the city’s salvation. Anne LeBaron’s electronically-infused music weaves together zydeco, gospel, voodoo drumming, and ancient Korean traditions to create an unforgettably phantasmagoric score. The production was an immersive yet elusive multimedia spectacle, where every vantage point offered a unique perspective.\n\nPhotography by Dana Ross and Joshua White provided courtesy of The Industry."
