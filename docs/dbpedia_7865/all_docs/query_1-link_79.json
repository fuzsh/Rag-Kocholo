He joined the university’s team in January 2022 after five-and-a-half years as the president of Northern New Mexico College and a twenty-four-year career in the United States Air Force. During President Bailey’s tenure at Northern New Mexico College, the institution crafted a Strategic Direction document, completed successful renegotiations of collective bargaining agreements with faculty and staff for the first time in a decade, and more than doubled its student graduation rate. He was instrumental in the revitalization of the college’s El Rito campus and the reintroduction of key career technical education programs. He also brokered a partnership for the construction of a 1.5MW solar array on its El Rito campus, helped to establish the Anna Age Eight Institute for the study and prevention of childhood trauma, and led the creation of the Eagle Corporation, allowing the institution to partner with business entities for the purpose of diversifying the college’s revenue streams.\n\nDr. Bailey’s Air Force career included service as an aircraft commander, instructor pilot, and flight examiner. He retired from the Air Force as a full colonel and command pilot with over 3,500 flying hours. After completing his PhD in 2006, Dr. Bailey served as a military liaison and defense trade analyst at the U.S. State Department. He later served as Chief Air Operations Officer at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Joint Force Command Brunssum in The Netherlands, where he oversaw air operations efforts for the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) mission in Afghanistan. He also served as associate professor of strategy and security studies at the School of Advanced Air and Space Studies at Air University, Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, and served as the school’s first-ever Dean of Students. In 2014, Dr. Bailey was elected the first-ever President of the Air University Faculty Senate, advising senior leaders on all issues pertinent to the university’s 600+ faculty members. He is the only faculty member in the university’s history to receive both the Faculty Excellence Award, given annually to the highest rated faculty member at the university, and the Muir S.
