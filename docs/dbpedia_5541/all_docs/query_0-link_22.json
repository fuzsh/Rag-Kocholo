        "text": "Turning Point founder and CEO Charlie Kirk does not as eagerly spread the fact of his “evangelical” (his label) Christianity compared to his eager preaching of his economic principles. He does not talk in Christian jargon, does not have a ‘conversion’ story, and does not invoke Bible verses for his claims.\n\nAt least not often. He makes a brief biblical citation for “free markets” in Chapter 5 of his manifesto “Time for a Turning Point.” There he quotes the opening of the Gospel of Luke and its taxes to the spread of the Gutenberg Bible to today’s ubiquitous Bible availability. He implies this is an example of “free enterprise.” The Luke reference is also an implicit attack on the “big government” of the Roman empire and Gutenberg is the scrappy entrepreneur who overturns European nation-states. This book also has no reference to Jesus.\n\nKirk has said he is a strong supporter of the “separation of church and state,” mainly because the creation of a religious marketplace has greatly aided the spread of Christianity.\n\nOn the other hand, he has not once criticized President Trump for a policy argument, let alone any of his personal sins while in office or before. That lack of leadership and independence from a person who leads thousands of college students (many who claim Jesus in their Twitter bios alongside TPUSA) is stunning.\n\nBut that is not the point of this post. I want in this post to look at a few of Kirk’s comments on Christianity in light of the statement about his support of the separation of church and state. In so doing I hope to create Kirk’s framework of religion and politics. Because, if it is not obvious, such a framework is not clear or has not been articulated widely by Kirk. I’m going to suggest that is on purpose.\n\nFirst, the separation. In the following video he makes his case.\n\nAs you can see it is a reply to a question about atheism, per se. But Kirk then veers into Christianity and its relationship to politics. He notes that he is for the separation of church and state “as long as our religious liberties are intact, preserved, and protected.” [As an aside the Alliance Defending Freedom, a Judeo-Christian nonprofit civil liberties firm, has represented TPUSA in at least one lawsuit against a college for infringing the speech rights of conservative students.]\n\nKirk says at the end of the video that as a Christian he is “very, very” worried that the US is moving away from “our Judeo-Christian beliefs” that “really created Western civilization.” He is worried because he equates atheism and its rise with a rise in immorality. His key claim for this is the former USSR.\n\nI’ll have to leave the argument about atheism and immorality alone for now. And the “godless” USSR, too. [I don’t think Kirk is giving any credit to the Russian Orthodox religion.]\n\nFor now, I want to look at his claim about the US. While the quote about beliefs may imply Kirk believes that the US was founded as a Christian nation, he specifically denies this in an interview I will link to later.\n\nBut the key point is that Kirk ignores the millions of Americans who don’t share the “Judeo-Christian” part of his values. [I’ll have to leave alone the claim that Kirk shares similarities with Steve Bannon. But as an opening, compare Kirk to Bannon by reading this on Bannon and hear the echoes. Kirk got his start by writing for Breitbart, Bannon’s former home.]\n\nAs evidence of his non-emphasis of religion, the phrase “Judeo-Christian” only appears once in Kirk’s manifesto book “Time for a Turning Point.” Kirk notes there the “attack” on conservatives on college campuses “reflects a deep and abiding hatred of all that we have been and all that we are” (pg. 174). This seems to be both a political reference to the Constitution but also a religious reference to those “Judeo-Christian” values.\n\nAs we shall see Kirk claims to make the latter his personal choice but it often appears alongside and intertwined with the former.\n\nFor example Kirk says he believes in a separation of church and state, but he also directly argues our political rights come from God. See this tweet about the Constitution. It may be a generic or vague deity but it is also clearly not Allah.\n\nOn defining that god, Kirk adds in “Time for a Turning Point,” in agreement with Dennis Prager, that “Bible-based religions affirm a morally judging God” and it is the standards set forth by this God that the followers live by (pg. 174). Notwithstanding the “morally judging” deity in Islam, we see Kirk here beginning to incorporate the formal relationship between politics and religion, between American capitalism and American religion. (He also claims “the Left” has no such standards.)\n\nIn that frame, Kirk has stated evangelical and politically conservative positions. He is anti-abortion, pro-gun, and smaller government. He also has some strong nationalistic opinions. For example, America is the greatest country in the world.\n\nYet he says there is no contradiction between his religious and political positions.\n\nHe says this in an interview with Dave Rubin, an interview where Kirk goes into the most detail I have seen about his Christianity (about 2 min mark).\n\nIn this video, Kirk repeats a line he tweeted in February 2018: “Do whatever you want with your life as long it doesn’t harm someone else. Just don’t make me pay for it.”\n\nKirk calls this a “conservatarian” philosophy that he labels “the non-aggression principle.”\n\nThis is an Ayn Rand concept. But it also can be seen in John Locke and other political philosophers. Here is a short primer on the concept.\n\nIt is not an inherently or primarily a religious or Christian concept and it is telling that Kirk chooses it to describe the way his religion and politics intertwine.\n\nThere is a host of things you could read on the idea but I am interested in what Kirk says in application in this interview.\n\nKirk doesn’t go into great detail on the idea in the video but he does state that Christianity politically went wrong or “crossed a line” in the 60s and 70s and 80s when “we tried to impose our beliefs through government policy where people then inherently have a rejection to it…”\n\nThese decades as reference point seem to indict the Moral Majority that began in 70s, a key faction for Reagan’s rise. Kirk adores Reagan. These decades also imply an indictment of the Civil Rights Movement that of course was led by King, a black preacher. And depending on how one takes the 80s reference, it could be an indictment or statement of support for Jimmy Carter.\n\nClearly one line out of a hour-long interview is hard to parse. But there is an important premise here. Kirk sees imposition of religious-based laws as not only unpersuasive but also ineffective for spreading the religion.\n\nThe error of religious politics in these decades is why Kirk says he tries to advocate for his political positions “through a secular worldview.” He does this for two other reasons, he notes: 1) most Americans are secular and 2) the government as set up by the founders is also secular. Kirk suggests arguing for a law because it is the “Christian thing to do” has turned people off in the last 30 years.\n\nThis is where Kirk starts to draw lines that contradict his other words. In drawing this neat (i.e. distinct) line between his personal religion and his personal politics, he ignores the ways in which not only are they connected generically but also specifically in him. And by drawing this line overtly and yet also doing “Christian politics” without the label, he is deceiving his audience. One is not making a “secular” argument for policies when one says our rights are given by God. More broadly, one cannot merely call one’s religion a personal choice with private practices and leave it at that, especially this religion in this country.\n\nThat said, Kirk is clearly against the type of Christian leaders that support Trump. But he doesn’t denounce them or Trump. He doesn’t talk about Trump in religious terms like they do. Yet he claims the religion of people who do. He wants to remain aloof from the debate over the role of white evangelicalism electing Trump and yet calls himself a evangelical (and he is white).\n\nKirk clearly would be one of those white evangelicals The Washington Post’s Michael Gerson (a former Bush speechwriter) has so forcefully argued lose credibility as Christians because of their sycophantic association with Trump.\n\nDespite his denail, Kirk’s intertwining of politics and religion is best seen in the non-aggression principle. To repeat: “Do whatever you want with your life as long it doesn’t harm someone else. Just don’t make me pay for it.” He opposes this to what he calls in the interview with Rubin “a sanctimonious approach to lifestyle.”\n\nI am not making a judgment on Kirk’s personal salvation, but this is not Christianity. But it is deeply libertarian. It’s not Christianity because there is a space between the forced binary of imposition and the “do whatever you want but do no harm” motto. There is no Christian church that would follow the latter and many that don’t do the former.\n\nAnd let’s be clear: Kirk’s criticism of the Christians from 60s-80s is for doing what amounts to doing what he is doing, just with more overt religion. He is advocating for politicians and laws that would usher in a theocratic government, democratic or not.\n\nYet he notes the founding fathers were wise not to mention anything about Christianity in the Constitution.\n\nBut the question then becomes if rights come from God, isn’t any suppression or limitation of that right (because it interferes with another’s rights) setting up not only a conflict in politics but also God? Why would God give people rights that conflict? And of course, an obvious question is, what God does Kirk think gives us rights? Is he implying all religions worship the same God?\n\nIn his attempt to ignore the Moral Majority and their ilk, Kirk makes clear he isn’t interested in the same issues they were — he has successfully redefined the culture wars as political or ideological not religious. The liberals of the 80s were denounced for their immortality. The liberals of today are denounced by Kirk for their socialism or indoctrination in general.\n\nBut it seems the one key element that unites the GOP for Kirk — freedom—also unites Christians.\n\nYet political freedom is entirely different than theological freedom, a distinction Kirk seems not to make.\n\nWith those two freedoms as one, it is no wonder Kirk wants to make private practice the key to Christianity.\n\nYet he also argues in the Rubin video that theocracy is in the DNA of Islam. This is why he criticizes the 80s Moral Majority movement because it seems theocratic to him — the imposition of morality through religion. Big government is bad, even religious government.\n\nAnd so being for freedom, one might assume Kirk is for gay marriage, to take a complex political issue as an example.\n\nWhat are his comments on the issue? He has stated it is wrong for the government to force a Christian cake baker to make a cake for a gay wedding. But it is not for Kirk a religious argument but a political one.\n\nIn short, his position on gay marriage as a religious concept is unclear on purpose. It is also clearly a legal and political issue, but Kirk is silent on those as well.\n\nWhile Kirk notes in the Rubin interview that the American public has changed its collective mind on gays and gay marriage, he consistently tweets there are only two genders. That’s not an argument for or against gay marriage. But it is close enough to religious arguments against homosexuality and gay marriage to gain followers, especially Christian ones.\n\nOn the other hand, the word “gay” shows up one time in Time for a Turning Point. And Kirk specifically says he’s not interested in talking about the “merits” of the fight over same-sex marriage. His tweets about LGBT issues also only make a political statement. For example, see here. He has also called Trump the “Most pro LGBT Incoming President ever.”\n\nKirk clearly does not want to be placed in a box on one of the most divisive issues in American Christianity today. Either it doesn’t matter or he doesn’t want people to know. But either way he is not being transparent.\n\nFrom all this, it is clear to me that Kirk lays his religion over top of his politics, and does not treat religion as co-equal in a separate, more personal sphere. He talks just enough about God to get many Christian college students to follow him, but shows little interest in parsing out the historically complex relationship between politics and religion, a relationship he admits has veered wrongly into theocracy at times.\n\nIn this frame Kirk can denounce the white nationalists who show up to support him or at least protest against his protesters. But Kirk only denounces them morally not religiously. Other conservative Christians have denounced them in theological terms.\n\nIn short Kirk doesn’t want to impose his religion on others. But his political opinions are part and parcel of his religious ones. Yet this unwillingness to openly think through religion and politics leaves open questions at the policy level and makes him opaque.\n\nThere is an open question of policies or actions that Kirk would see as not harming another. And then, too, if those should be funded by any level of government.\n\nFor example Kirk would most likely see government assistance as harming the individual and so he would not want the government to pay for it. But as a Christian would he want his tithe to go to feeding the homeless or poor? In the video, he says giving money to private, religious charities is better than giving it to the government. But if the church that one might make this donation to is huge, is that bad then?\n\nIn other words, Kirk clearly hates Obamacare but would he support a global mega-church like Hillsong coming out with an medical payment plan like Medishare, the Christian-based organization whose members pay each other’s medical bills (and definitely does not call itself insurance)? And so besides being run by the government, why is healthy people paying for the sick (a basic definition of insurance) bad to Kirk?\n\nBecause Kirk does not promote his religion, but relies on his audiences assuming it and its implications, there are many more questions like this. Also, the teleological question also needs to be asked — what would a true libertarian society look like for Kirk? Would it be the kingdom on earth? A secular utopia? A moral yet secular democracy? Kirk believes people are inherently bad (a Calvinistic idea) and that government can’t change that (a libertarian idea), how does everyone having “freedom” help or even assuage the inherent badness?\n\nI have more questions than answers. But I think I have proven that may be on purpose for Kirk."
