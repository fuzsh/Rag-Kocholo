        "text": "Additional media\n\nAreas of interest\n\nI am a theologian who studies how cultural developments, especially those related to the sciences, affect religious beliefs and behaviors. The courses I teach typically focus on the relationship between the religious dimensions of life, on the one hand, and some prevalent aspect of contemporary culture, such as science, food, or literature, on the other hand. I am currently developing an approach to the study of theology in which religious claims are evaluated from a secular perspective as hypotheses to be investigated alongside those of science. My analysis hinges on the notion that not all hypotheses worth considering are testable.\n\nSelected Publications\n\nThe Entangled God: Divine Relationality and Quantum Physics.
