        "text": "By Michael Boytim\n\nmboytim@altoonamirror.com\n\nThe landscape of area high school golf will be a lot different this season as almost the entire first and second team of the Altoona Mirror 2023 All-Star team has graduated.\n\nHollidaysburg returns the only two first teamers back in senior Isaac Miller, who qualified for the PIAA championships last year after winning a playoff to finish as the runner-up in the District 6 Class 3A championship, and defending District 6 Class 3A girls golf champion Crosby Denis, who is just a sophomore.\n\nMiller will have to finish in the top two again this year if he wants to return to Penn State University for the state championships. Once again, the top seven in District 6 in Class 2A boys will move on.\n\nThe Golden Tigers also welcome Brody Partner-Gore, who was a second-team all-star for Bishop Guilfoyle last season.\n\nDenis will be the favorite to repeat as Class 3A girls individual champion, and she will try to lead her Hollidaysburg team to a District 6 team title after State College won last season.\n\nCentral Cambria’s boys team returns four key players from last year’s team that went 31-4 and won the Laurel Highlands Athletic Conference in the first season of the new-look league by edging fellow section champions Hollidaysburg and Bishop McCort.\n\nThere will be three new coaches, including Chuck Meyers at Altoona. The Mountain Lions went 11-3-1 last season and return Mirror second-teamer Krieghoff Cumming. Dan Solomon of Bellwood-Antis and Mark Mardula of Penn Cambria are the other new coaches in the area.\n\nThe season is scheduled to open today with local teams competing at the Happy Valley Invitational and Park Hills Invitational.\n\nThe following are capsules of the teams competing this season in the Mirror’s core coverage area.\n\nBOYS\n\nAltoona\n\nCoach: Chuck Meyers, first year\n\nCareer record: 0-0\n\nLast year’s record: 11-3-1\n\nConference: Independent\n\nReturning starters: Seniors–Will Sankey, Kai Hillegas, Gavin Albright. Juniors–Krieghoff Cumming, Adam Kanouff\n\nOther returning players: Seniors–Carmine Polito, Cole Civiello. Sophomore–Reese Hite\n\nNewcomers: Seniors–Dylan Stewart, Aaron Smearman, Ryan McConnell. Junior–Luke Schimminger.\n\nStrengths: “Experience and work ethic. We have a number of strong players returning and exciting new players joining the team. They have been competing, hitting the gym and working on their games over the summer.”\n\nConcerns: “Leadership — I am looking forward to see who is going to step up and be a leader and make sure players are conducting themselves the right way and that they are putting the work in.”\n\nOverall outlook: “We have a number of athletes who can really send it. When they round out their games and combine that with the players who have experience in competition, I believe we can go to states. I’m super excited for the challenge.”\n\nAssistant coaches: Doug Meyers, Nate Hockenos\n\nBellwood-Antis\n\nCoach: Dan Solomon, first year\n\nCareer record: 0-0\n\nLast year’s record: 8-16\n\nConference: Laurel Highlands Athletic Conference\n\nReturning starters: Seniors–Ryan Marinak, Sam Bailor\n\nOther returning players: Senior–Leigha Clapper. Juniors–Lucas Fulmer, Alyssa Briggs. Sophomore–Gabriel Gummo\n\nNewcomers: Senior–Zachary Gonzalez. Sophomore–Sean McFarland. Freshmen–Avery Bardell, Dean Hoffer, Killian Worthing, Maddox McCall, Tate Baughman, Nicolee Lovrich\n\nStrengths: “Strong upperclassman leadership and overall numbers due to a large freshman class.”\n\nConcerns: “We lost our No. 1 player and four total starters from last year. Consistency from newcomers.”\n\nOverall outlook: “Cautiously optimistic. A successful season will be measured by the growth and development of all the players, but our competitiveness will be determined by how much our newcomers contribute.”\n\nAssistant coach: Kirk Dodson\n\nBishop Carroll\n\nCoach: Tim Holtz, second year\n\nCareer record: 13-17\n\nLast year’s record: 13-17\n\nConference: Laurel Highlands Athletic Conference\n\nReturning starters: Seniors–Cullen Myers, Kylee Yoder, Allison Carney. Junior–Sean Fisanick. Sophomores–Ethan Holtz, Brody Pablic, Landon Duman\n\nOther returning players: Junior–Reagan Myung. Sophomore–Matt Zernick\n\nNewcomers: Senior–Cory Franceshini. Juniors–Sarah Miller, Jace Casses, Caleb Shutty. Freshmen–Patrick Phillips, Nathan Carney, Winston Hall-Campbell\n\nStrengths: “We have a good number of both returning players and newcomers that joined the team. We have several players very capable of competing at the district and state championship levels. These kids work hard and enjoy spending time on the range and the course preparing for the season.”\n\nConcerns: “Being we have a large group of players and only are allowed to compete with five, we want to try and prepare each player for competition. Depending on their skill level, and where they are developmentally, that will guide us in the direction we want to go with each player individually.”\n\nOverall outlook: “We are looking forward to an enjoyable, competitive and developmental season. Regardless of record and skill set, our goal is to instruct the players on all components of the game so they continue to grow with the sport.”\n\nAssistant coach: Matt Shutty\n\nBishop Guilfoyle\n\nCoach: Mark Scalice, sixth year\n\nCareer record: 58-25\n\nLast year’s record: 23-12\n\nConference: Laurel Highlands Athletic Conference\n\nReturning starters: Sophomores–Grant Okonak, Aiden Sheehan, Max Burgmeier\n\nOther returning players: Juniors–Brock Patel, Parker Knorr. Sophomores–Troy Nachtman, Chase Criste, Chase Imler, Nathan Simanski, Gavin Weyant, Joey Lehman\n\nNewcomers: Seniors–Trevor Rehm, Nick Foor. Junior–Ty Shultz. Sophomores–Carter Boland, Evan Schimminger, Enzo Lascolli. Freshmen–Dominic Ianuzzi, Xavier Rhodes\n\nStrengths: “We return three starters from last year who have a great deal of match experience in addition to some returning and new players who are ready to step into a starting role.”\n\nConcerns: “Replacing our No. 1 and No. 2 players from a year ago presents a challenge, and we’re still a very young team.”\n\nOverall outlook: “I think with some of the new and returning players who have proven themselves over the summer, we are in a good place as the season approaches. I look for Grant Okonak and Aiden Sheehan to have a breakout season as our goals remain the same, compete for a LHAC championship, win District 6 and advance to the state finals, our standard of excellence remains the same.”\n\nAssistant coach: Brad Raven\n\nJunior high coaches: Rick Tangeman, Adam Landolfi, Bret Miller, Mark Moschella Jr.\n\nCentral\n\nCoach: Robbie Keith, 17th year\n\nLast year’s record: 24-7\n\nConference: Laurel Highlands Athletic Conference\n\nReturning starters: Senior–Bryton Barnes. Sophomores–Cody Clapper, Ben Hartman\n\nOther returning players: Seniors–Cortlyn Hetrick, Tyler Gach, Bryson Brooks, Marah Dickson. Sophomores–Brooks Matthews, Cameron Yingling, Kyle Gach\n\nNewcomers: Junior–Hunter Keith. Freshmen–Tristan Ritchey, Ty Matthews\n\nStrengths: “We have a group of players who were at the golf course all summer putting in the work.”\n\nConcerns: “We only have a couple players with much tournament experience, so those players will really need to step up to help the untested players.”\n\nOverall outlook: “If we can use the regular season as good practice for the playoffs, I think we can finish with a solid season in the playoffs. We want to get better throughout the season and hit our peak when it matters most.”\n\nAssistant coach: None\n\nCentral Cambria\n\nCoach: Keith Gilkey, 10th year\n\nCareer record: 91-29\n\nLast year’s record: 31-4\n\nConference: Laurel Highlands Athletic Conference\n\nReturning starters: Senior–Austin Semelsberger. Juniors–Xavier Jorinscay, Angelo Persio, Jake Kirsch\n\nOther players: Senior–Wes Holtz. Juniors–Logan Black, Shane Calpin, Brayden Swope. Sophomore–Lucas Lacorchick. Freshmen–Rocco Barra, Andrew Kasecky, Skyler Kozen, Maison Link\n\nStrengths: “We are returning four players with match experience in Austin Semelsberger, Jake Kirsch, Angelo Persio and Xavier Jorinscay. We hope to advance the team and some individuals in district playoffs.”\n\nConcerns: “We are very young this year with only one returning senior on the team. The expended LHAC is loaded with talent, so every week will be a challenge.”\n\nOverall outlook: “The boys have been working hard this summer to earn their spot in the lineup. It will be fun to see how that work pays off.”\n\nCo-head coach: Jaylee Sikora\n\nHollidaysburg\n\nCoach: Bryan James, 14th year\n\nCareer record: 175-58-5\n\nLast year’s record: 29-8\n\nConference: Laurel Highlands Athletic Conference\n\nReturning starters: Seniors–Troy Allen, Dominic Battisti, Isaac Miller. Sophomore–Tyler Steiner\n\nOther returning players: None\n\nNewcomers: Senior–Brody Partner-Gore. Junior–Cole Malausky. Sophomores–Jackson Breene, Landen Petrunak, Isaac Tryninewski. Freshmen–Mason Bender, Braden Hatch, Liam Jancula, Dominik Johnston, Sam McLanahan\n\nStrengths: “Good returning core that has improved since last season.”\n\nConcerns: “Consistency.”\n\nOverall outlook: “I am excited for this team. I feel that we have the correct pieces to be competitive in a variety of settings this fall.”\n\nAssistant coach: Steve Genter\n\nPenn Cambria\n\nCoach: Mark Mardula, first year\n\nCareer record: 0-0\n\nConference: Laurel Highlands Athletic Conference\n\nReturning starters: Seniors–Brandon Rabish, Andrew Nagle\n\nOther returning players: Sophomores–Kaden Hartline, Vance Plazek, Madden Farabaugh, Colten Karlheim\n\nNewcomers: Senior–Gavin Kick. Sophomores–Nate McCloskey, Bryce Mento, Joe Hanlon, Isaac Luther. Freshmen–Kingston Durbin, Luke Michina\n\nStrengths: “Our team has a small but exceptional group of juniors and seniors who have been with the program since they were freshmen. They are great kids and do a fantastic job of setting a good example for the younger members of the team. I believe their experience and leadership will be key to the success of our program this year.”\n\nConcerns: “We have a very young team, so there will be some growing pains, but these kids are truly dedicated. They are resilient and continuously working on improving their games.”\n\nOverall outlook: “I’m incredibly excited for the upcoming season and can’t wait to see the team compete each week. While there will be some growing pains with our younger players, I’m confident that they’ll keep pushing forward and never give up. They’ve worked hard all summer and have made significant improvements to their game.”\n\nAssistant coaches: Keith Saleme, Kate Little\n\nPortage\n\nCoach: Scott Burda, eighth year\n\nCareer record: 54-35\n\nLast year’s record: 8-8\n\nConference: Heritage Conference\n\nReturning starters: Seniors–Kaleb Castel, Jonah Irvin, Trae Kargo, Kaiden Zock, Bailey Patalune. Junior–Logan Gentile\n\nOther returning players: Senior–Kendra Kunko. Juniors–Britton Myher, Konner Zock. Sophomores–Aiden Pauley, Nathan Phillips\n\nNewcomers: Senior–Nicholas Baker. Sophomore–Aden Gabel\n\nStrengths: “A group of young men and women that enjoy golf and a solid group of returning players.”\n\nConcerns: “Consistency.”\n\nOverall outlook: “This season we will have a large group of upperclassmen that will anchor our team. Many of them have been multi-year starters and have shown improvement over the years. I am looking for them to take the next step and consistently shoot their lowest scores. I am hoping that we can contend with the best teams in our conference and send this big group of seniors off with a winning record.”\n\nAssistant coach: Jeff Vasilko\n\nTyrone\n\nCoach: Mike Funicelli, sixth year\n\nCareer record: 128-32\n\nLast year’s record: 12-18\n\nConference: Laurel Highlands Athletic Conference\n\nReturning starters: Juniors–Kaleb Sweitzer, Colin Burket\n\nOther returning players: Senior–Logan Harpster. Junior–Ty Uplinger\n\nNewcomers: Seniors–Dylan Ewing, Rhyse Hamp, Trace Lingafelt. Junior–Preston Long. Sophomores–William Lower, Ethan Reffner. Freshmen–Brayden Brumbaugh, Aiden Luther, Teagan Harpster\n\nStrengths: “After having a small team last year we were able to get some fresh faces to come out and play this season. Some of them will be immediate contributors. Along with our No. 1, Kaleb, we have a young team with kids who love playing golf, so we hope to be competitive in every match..”\n\nConcerns: “Replacing RJ Royer is our biggest concern. He was a stud golfer, and we could always count on him to post a score in the mid-70s. Our players will have to step up and work together to fill the void.”\n\nOverall outlook: “Our goal is to compete for a Laurel Highlands team title and to have several players advance to the state competition. We will need several players to step up and be mentally tough and ready to grind it out.”\n\nAssistant coach: Doug Sweitzer\n\nGIRLS\n\nAltoona\n\nCoach: Joel Gilbert, fourth year\n\nCareer record: 11-17\n\nLast year’s record: 6-3\n\nConference: Independent\n\nReturning starters: Senior–Clarissa Long. Juniors–Ellie Filer, Sofia Hallinan\n\nOther returning players: None\n\nNewcomers: Junior–Bailey Diehl. Sophomore–Vionna Jackson. Freshman–Averi Wilkinson\n\nStrengths: “Experience with our three returning girls.”\n\nConcerns: “Inexperience and numbers.”\n\nOverall outlook: “We are looking forward to having a great season. Ellie Filer returns with two district medals. Clarissa Long has played in the District 6 tournament all three seasons and is looking to do great things in her senior year. Sofia Hallinan really came on at the end of last season and is looking to build upon that momentum coming into this year. We will need production from our newcomers to help us compete against the top-level competition.”\n\nAssistant coaches: Tom Fox, Mike Wilkinson\n\nBishop Guilfoyle\n\nCoach: Mark Scalice, second year\n\nCareer record: 1-3\n\nLast year’s record: 1-3\n\nConference: Laurel Highlands Athletic Conference\n\nReturning starters: Seniors–Elle Wilson, Ava Iapolucci\n\nOther returning players: None\n\nNewcomers: Senior–Ava Bagley. Junior–Taryn Carruthers\n\nStrengths: “Elle Wilson has the most match experience and has had success at the District 6 level. Playing in a limited basis last season, Ava Iapolucci gained valuable match experience which will help as the season approaches.”\n\nConcerns: “This will be our Inaugural season competing as a team. So we have a lot of unknowns.”\n\nOverall outlook: “The girls have worked hard over the summer and are ready to go, with the leadership of Elle and Ava and newcomers Eva Bagley and Taryn Carruthers, I believe the girls will be competitive and have a successful season.”\n\nAssistant coach: Brad Raven\n\nCentral Cambria\n\nCoach: Keith Gilkey, 10th year\n\nCareer record: 59-10\n\nLast year’s record: 14-2\n\nConference: Laurel Highlands Athletic Conference\n\nReturning starters: Senior–Jazmine Boland. Sophomore–Bella Mesoras\n\nOther players: Sophomores–Mackenzie Sweeny, Samantha Hill. Freshmen–Maddie Dumm, Leah Papcinick\n\nStrengths: “We have two returning starters in Jazmine Boland and Bella Mesoras. They have stepped up as our leaders and do a great job of helping our younger girls improve.”\n\nConcerns: “Girls golf continues to grow in the area, which is great, but the competition gets tougher each year.”\n\nOverall outlook: “We look forward to seeing where we stack up. We are sad to have Coach (Gretchen) Getz step down, but we are excited to welcome Coach Jaylee Sikora. Coach Sikora and I expect the girls to have another great year.”\n\nCo-head coach: Jaylee Sikora\n\nHollidaysburg\n\nCoach: Jill Hileman, fourth year\n\nCareer record: 43-8-1\n\nLast year’s record: 11-0\n\nConference: Laurel Highlands Athletic Conference\n\nReturning starters: Senior–Alexis Peacock. Juniors–Lucy Carles, Laila Panaro. Sophomore–Crosby Denis\n\nOther returning players: Seniors–Olivia Miknis, Sara Waldron, Lauren Hajnosz, Avery Hooper, Olivia Bisacco\n\nNewcomers: Junior–Rylee Harshaw. Freshmen–Reagan Bihary, Aerie Kerstetter, Maliah Malausky, Piper Weidly\n\nStrengths: “We have four returning starters who were important contributors to our team’s overall success last year and who also gained a significant amount of match experience. We also have a group of girls coming back who showed improvement over the course of the season last year. Our freshman class has some experience as well.”\n\nConcerns: “This is our largest team we’ve had in a long time. Once concern will be getting all of the girls some match play experience throughout the season.”\n\nOverall outlook: “Our returning players will be strong contributors in all our matches. Our goal is to build on last year’s success and hopefully have some team success in winning a District 6 championship.”\n\nAssistant coach: Mitch Johns\n\nPenn Cambria\n\nCoach: Mark Mardula, first year\n\nCareer record: 0-0\n\nConference: Laurel Highlands Athletic Conference\n\nReturning starters: Senior–Elle Myers. Juniors–Avery Glass, Kiya Thomas\n\nNewcomers: Sophomore–Celia Barnish. Freshmen–Ava Wirfel, Kendall McConnell, Makayla Durbin\n\nStrengths: “Our team has a small but exceptional group of juniors and seniors who have been with the program since they were freshmen. They are great kids and do a fantastic job of setting a good example for the younger members of the team. I believe their experience and leadership will be key to the success of our program this year.”\n\nConcerns: “We have a very young team, so there will be some growing pains, but these kids are truly dedicated. They are resilient and continuously working on improving their games.”\n\nOverall outlook: “I’m incredibly excited for the upcoming season and can’t wait to see the team compete each week.
