        "text": "On the Field\n\nKirk was drafted in the 4th round of the 2012 NFL draft (#102 overall). At the beginning of the 2015 season, Coach Gruden named Kirk the starting quarterback and the Redskins went on to finish 9-7 that season. They were NFC East Division Champs and made their first trip to the playoffs in four years. On March 15, 2018, Kirk signed with the Minnesota Vikings on a three-year contract.\n\nOff the Field\n\nKirk and Julie were married on June 28, 2014. They welcomed their first child, Cooper, into the world on September 29, 2017. Currently, the family splits their time in the Minneapolis area, Georgia, and Michigan. Both Kirk and Julie are committed to impacting people through numerous volunteer roles, speaking engagements, and Kirk’s annual Football Camp in Holland, Michigan. Together the Cousins family gives thanks to God for increased opportunities to make a difference both on and off the football field."
