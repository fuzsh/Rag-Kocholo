If you are looking to connect with others on a religious level, we offer a wide range of events and activities that encourage discussion of the divine. If you prefer to practice your faith more privately, we have a number of spaces around campus that are perfect for individual reflection and prayer. Whatever role religion or spirituality plays in your life, you have many opportunities to grow in your faith at Elms.\n\nLocal Spiritual Communities\n\nIn addition to weekly Catholic Mass at Elms College, the area is home to many faith communities. We have a list of various faith traditions and their services. May you find a welcome community of faith at any of the following spiritual communities.\n\nWeekend Mass is offered each Saturday at 5:45 P.M. Community Mass at 12:15 P.M. on Wednesday during the academic year.\n\nThe Office of Campus Ministry serves to enrich the spiritual lives of all students. Have a passion for service? Sign up for the First Year Encounter Program! (formerly the Dorothy Day Program)."
