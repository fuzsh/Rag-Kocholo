        "text": "Fashioning Difference: Sartorial Practices and Social Order in Eighteenth-Century Sweden\n\n6 December 2018\n\nA guest lecture delivered by Mikael Alm (University of Uppsala and 2018 Matariki Fellow at Durham University).\n\nIn early modern societies, the interplay between sartorial practices and social order was complex. Clothes did not merely reproduce set social patterns. They were powerful agents of change, actively used by individuals and groups to make claims and to transgress formal boundaries. This was not least the case during the revolutionary decades of the late eighteenth century. Drawing on his upcoming book, historian Mikael Alm will dive into these matters. Departing from the Swedish case, several fields of early modern cultural history are brought together: social culture and early modern preoccupation with order; visual culture and the preoccupation with a legible order; and sartorial culture and the preoccupation with the proper means of making difference.\n\nWorkshop: Anti-Catholicism in Europe and America, 1520-1900\n\n11-13 September 2018\n\nA three-day workshop on anti-Catholicism in Europe and America will be held at Newcastle University between 11-13 September 2018. The aims of the workshop are to compare and contrast the anti-Catholic traditions of a range of countries and regions across Europe and America from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century; to see how definitions of ‘popery’ changed according to the political/religious context in which they were situated; and to assess how, why and to what extent anti-Catholicism might be seen to have contributed to wider historical processes such as the Reformation, Enlightenment, empire, state building and the formation of national identities.\n\nThe workshop will not be run via a series of formal papers, but will encourage discussion, exchange and interdisciplinary debate. We would like to encourage historians, art historians, theologians and literature scholars, and those from other disciplines and at all stages of their careers to participate in this workshop. If you are interested in contributing, please submit a 300-word abstract of your research interests and how they relate to one or more of the following themes to adam.morton@newcastle.ac.uk by April 30th 2018:\n\n- Anti-Catholicism and National Identities\n\n- Anti-Catholicism and the Atlantic World\n\n- Anti-Catholicism in America\n\n- Anti-Catholicism and the Reformation\n\n- Anti-Catholicism and the Enlightenment\n\n- Anti-Catholic readings of the past\n\n- Conspiracy Theories\n\n- Stereotypes\n\n- Representations of ‘papists’\n\n- Anti-Catholicism and politics/political thought\n\n- Anti-Catholic violence, unrest, and riot\n\n- Change and continuity in concepts of anti-Catholicism\n\n- Catholic reactions to anti-Catholicism\n\nIt is expected that proceedings from the workshop will be published at a later date.\n\nThe workshop is being organised by the Arts and Humanities Research Council funded network, Anti-Catholicism in British History: c. 1520-1900. The aim of this network is to outline the history of anti-Catholicism in Britain by focussing on how it contributed to political, cultural and religious movements during moments of crisis, by tracing the roles which stereotypes and conspiracy theories played in maintaining anti-Catholic ideology, and by assessing the ways in which anti-Catholicism changed across the centuries and how vital this change was to ensuring that it remained a significant part of ‘British’ and ‘Protestant’ identities. This workshop on Europe and America is intended to draw comparisons between nations: anti-Catholicism is often cited as being crucial to national identity, but was it, perhaps, a supra-national ideology? Given that so many countries and groups claimed it as a hallmark of their identity, can it be seen as a ‘national’ phenomenon in any meaningful sense?\n\nEarly Modern Political Thought and Twenty-First Century Politics: A Workshop\n\nNewcastle Literary and Philosophical Society, Westgate Road 16 May 2018\n\nEngland in the mid-seventeenth century was politically turbulent. Civil War, regicide & republic all disrupted the normal institutions and practices of politics. While this must have been hard for those living at the time, it nonetheless generated a wealth of new political ideas. These included: the proto-democratic radicalism of the Levellers; the innovative constitutional proposals of James Harrington; the experiment in communal living enacted by the Diggers and the theories of political obligation, representation and church-state relations of Thomas Hobbes. Many of these ideas remain of interest and relevance today. And, while it would be wrong to suggest that seventeenth-century ideas can simply be applied to solve current problems, it is undoubtedly useful to look to the past to understand how we came to be where we are, and the other paths that could have been taken. At this workshop, experts on the seventeenth century will explore what early-modern thinkers had to say on the themes of popular mobilisation, toleration, environmentalism and exile and what their insights might add to contemporary political discussions.\n\nSpeakers: John Rees (author of The Leveller Revolution); Ann Hughes (Keele University); Ariel Hessayon (Goldsmiths); Gaby Mahlberg (author of Henry Neville & English Republican Culture in the Seventeenth Century)\n\nFor more information contact Rachel.Hammersley@ncl.ac.uk\n\nConference: ‘Locating the Ancient World in Early Modern Subversive Thought’\n\nApril 2018\n\nFeaturing Keynote Speakers Peter Harrison (University of Queensland) and Marianne Pade (Danish Academy at Rome)\n\nThe aim of this conference is to expand on the revived appreciation of the classical influence in early modernity by looking specifically at the role played by the ancient world in that sphere from which it has most usually been excluded: subversive literature. The idea that the texts, philosophies, and exempla of the ancient world might have served as significant tools for those who sought to undermine and challenge political, religious and cultural authority stands in direct opposition to the traditional role assigned to the classics in this period. Emphasising an interdisciplinary approach, this conference will draw scholars together to build a coherent picture of how the classical tradition functioned as a tool for subversion, illuminating a previously neglected aspect of the ancient world in the early modern thought.\n\nWorkshop: Trajectories of Anti-Catholicism in Britain 1520-1900\n\nResearch Beehive, Newcastle University 21-22 March 2018\n\nThis two-day workshop will assess the various traditions of anti-Catholicism in British history. It will compare and contrast traditions in Ireland, Scotland, Wales and England, and trace continuities and change in anti-Catholic ideology across the centuries. Speakers will consider the role of stereotypes in the sustaining of anti-Catholicism, and discussion will focus on how prejudice and intolerance can be approached historically. The event will be interdisciplinary and will feature presentations from historians, literary scholars and social psychologists.\n\nProvisional Programme:\n\nDAY 1 (12.45-13.00) Welcome (Adam Morton)\n\n13.00-15.45 Trajectories and National Perspectives\n\nCommentator: Anthony Milton (University of Sheffield)\n\n- Alan Ford (University of Nottingham): Ireland\n\n- Clotilde Prunier (Paris): Scotland\n\n- Paul O’Leary (Aberystwyth University): Wales\n\n- John Wolffe (Open University): England\n\n15.45-16.15 Coffee\n\n16.15-1800 Roundtable: Analysing Anti-Catholicism\n\nChair: Andrew Holmes (Queens University Belfast)\n\n- John Craig (Simon Fraser University), Emma Turnbull (University of Oxford), Donald McRaild (University of Roehampton), Aishlinn Muller (University of Cambridge), Joan Allen (Newcastle).\n\n19.30: Dinner\n\nDAY 2 (9-10.30) Approaching Prejudice and Intolerance\n\nChair: Adam Morton (Newcastle University)\n\n- Cristian Tileaga (Loughborough University)\n\n- Jovan Byford (Open University)\n\n10.30-11: Coffee\n\n11.00-13.00: Roundtable: Anti-Catholic Stereotypes\n\nChair: Rachel Hammersley (Newcastle University)\n\n- Carys Brown (University of Cambridge), Colin Haydon (Winchester University), Thomas Freeman (University of Essex), Adam Morton (Newcastle University), Naiyla Shamgunova (University of Cambridge)\n\n13.00-14.00: Lunch\n\n14.00-15.00: Roundtable – Going Forward: Analysing Anti-Catholicism\n\nChair: Adam Morton (Newcastle University)\n\nTo register, please contact adam.morton@newcastle.ac.uk\n\nWorkshop: Anti-Catholicism in 19th Century Britain\n\nWednesday 31st January 2018\n\nThis half-day workshop will consider the various and contrasting roles which anti-Catholic ideology played in nineteenth century British society. Topics covered will include religion, patriotism, immigration, sexual politics and memory of the Reformation. The event is being chaired by Professor Hugh Macleod, FBA, and speakers include Dr Harry Cocks (Nottingham), Dr Andrew Atherstone (Oxford), Dr Sarah Roddy (Manchester) and Dr Jonathan Bush (Ushaw College, Durham). The event is being organised by the Ideas and Beliefs research strand in conjunction with the Centre for Nineteenth Century Studies at Durham. To register, please contact adam.morton@newcastle.ac.uk\n\nWorkshop: Re-assessing R. I. Moore's Formation of a Persecuting Society (1987)\n\nFriday 15 September 2017\n\nThis event intends to celebrate and assess the contemporary relevance of R. I. Moore’s ‘Formation of a Persecuting Society’, first publishes in 1987, for the current historiography of mediaeval and early-modern Europe. The workshop will be divided into four sessions: firstly on the relevance of the concept of a persecuting society in contemporary mediaeval studies; second its impact on the scholarship of early-modern Europe; third on the use of the concept beyond the chronology and geography of the original work; and finally on the legacy of R. I. Moore’s scholarship on the historiography of exclusion, orthodoxy / heterodoxy and identity politics in general. The event celebrates Newcastle's contribution to these fields of scholarship, and the continued importance of a retired member of the School, his contribution to scholarship worldwide, and the impact of his work through translation and adaptation in other contexts than mediaeval history.\n\nSpeakers include: Professor R. I. Moore (Newcastle, Emeritus), Professor Mark Pegg (Washington, St Louis), Professor Robin Briggs (Oxford, Emeritus), Professor Mark Greengrass (Sheffield, Emeritus), Dr Julien Théry-Astruc (Lyon II), and Dr Simon Yarrow (Birmingham).\n\nFor more information please email Dr Luc Racaut.\n\nWorkshop: Early Modern Civil Religion\n\nThursday 14 September 2017\n\nRecent scholarship has reintegrated the religious perspective into how the intellectual culture of the early modern period, particularly in the political sphere, can be understood. This has opened up new avenues of enquiry for those working on the role of scholarship (biblical, patristic, and classical) in intellectual engagement, scholars of philosophy and theology, as well as historians of culture, books, and political thought, consequently providing a much more varied understanding of how ideas were formed and justified. Yet in the midst of these developments, the reality of how the Church-State relationship was envisaged by those writing on politics and religion in this period remains under-explored. The notion of a ‘civil religion’ was a prominent feature of the discourse, but its ambiguity and the contradictions and difficulties involved in its practical realisation has left it as something of a by-stander in the intellectual history of the period. The arguments that were made for civil religion have been used by scholars as evidence for established interpretations of the period, whether that be for the existence of a ‘Radical Enlightenment’, or for the Christian Reformist tendencies of these so-called radicals, or as proof of continuity with existing traditions in republican, patristic, or classical ideologies.\n\nThis one-day workshop proposes to examine civil religion in early modernity on its own terms, rather than as a subsect of existing scholarly narratives. It seeks to bring together scholars from different disciplinary spheres in order to encourage reflection on this notion of ‘civil religion,’ and to construct an understanding of its specific contribution to its intellectual and cultural context. Possible points of discussion include:\n\nWhat is ‘early modern civil religion’? Can a clear and unified understanding be established?\n\nWhat intellectual arguments were used to justify a ‘civil religion’? How were the counter-arguments constructed?\n\nHow were ancient precedents utilised to create a tangible vision of a ‘civil religion’? How was the historical development of episcopal authority represented in the debate?\n\nHow developed were ideas for how such a religion might work in practice? For example, the selection of priests, their role in the community, and the conduct of religious practice?\n\nWhat relationship did the notion of civil religion have with republican ideology as it developed from antiquity to the early modern world?\n\nDid civil religion have an impact beyond political and religious discourse? How was it represented and used in editorial practices, literature, art, rhetoric, or biographical writing?\n\nFor further details please contact Dr Katie East (Katherine.East@newcastle.ac.uk).\n\nWorkshop: Intellectual Biographies\n\nTuesday 4 July 2017\n\nThe genre of the intellectual biography has recently come back into vogue. It has been reinvigorated by two recent developments. First, the construction of large digitised data sets that allow published pamphlets, newspapers and government documents to be searched by name, date, and theme, making it possible to uncover new information even about the lives of very well known figures. Secondly, the growing receptiveness of intellectual historians and literary critics to utilise methods drawn from political, social and even economic history, which has encouraged and facilitated the combination of archival research on an individual’s life with textual analysis of their works. Substantial volumes have recently appeared on the life and work of Edmund Burke, David Hume and Karl Marx. Richard Bourke’s Empire and Revolution: The Political Life of Edmund Burke (2015), in particular, has revolutionised the way in which that complex political thinker and actor has been viewed. With great skill Bourke integrates Burke’s life with his writings, demonstrating the intimate connection between the two and enriching our understanding of both late eighteenth-century politics and the political thought of the period in the process. The trend for intellectual biography is now moving back into the seventeenth century, with major studies of John Milton, James Harrington, John Lilburne and John Locke currently in preparation. It is, therefore, an ideal moment to consider the benefits of this approach to intellectual history and other related disciplines, as well as the opportunities and challenges that writing an intellectual biography presents.\n\nThis one-day workshop will combine presentations by scholars who are currently producing intellectual biographies on leading early-modern figures with a round table facilitating wider discussion on the genre. The approach will be explicitly interdisciplinary and although the workshop will be grounded in the early modern period, the discussion will also explore the relevance of the genre to both earlier and later periods. The workshop will explore themes such as:\n\nWhat are the best ways of integrating biographical detail with analysis of the subject’s thought and writings?\n\nHow can an author do justice to both the archival and textual aspects of the project?\n\nDoes an intellectual biography have to adopt a chronological structure?\n\nIn what ways can an individual life illuminate a period more generally?\n\nWhat are the particular opportunities and challenges associated with writing intellectual biographies of early-modern figures?\n\nHow does the construction of an intellectual biography fit within the broader field of Life-Writing?\n\nSpeakers will include Professor Mike Braddick (Sheffield); Professor Mark Goldie (Cambridge); Professor Sarah Hutton (York); Professor Nick McDowell (Exeter); Dr Gaby Mahlberg (Journalist and Independent Scholar, Berlin).\n\nFor more information please contact Dr Rachel Hammersley."
