Mark has been serving in pastoral ministry since 1992 and began Calvary Knoxville in 1997. As the founding and lead pastor Mark oversees all areas of ministry. His primary focus, however, are our two corporate meeting times where he teaches our adult congregation systematically through God’s word, equipping us for the work of the ministry. Mark’s desire is that the congregation of Calvary would be the best fed and most loved people in Knoxville and abroad."
