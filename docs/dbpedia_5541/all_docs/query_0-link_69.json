        "text": "Disgraced Pastor Mark Driscoll recently referred to President Joe Biden as Ahab, said a Jezebel spirit “cancelled” Easter during the pandemic. And he claimed “neutered, compromised, beta-male” pastors who don’t call out “demonic,” “woke” agendas are to blame for society’s ills.\n\nThe in-your-face rhetoric was aired in an early August pódcast with conservative activist and unapologetic Christian nationalist, Charlie Kirk.\n\nDriscoll, who seems to be fashioning himself as an activist, as well, claims he’s looking to the prophet Elijah—a “man’s man,” who didn’t just carry a weapon, but “is a weapon”—as his model.\n\nOn Driscoll’s website, called “Real Faith,” he’s selling a hat picturing a skull with fire coming out of it using the acronym WWED for “What Would Elijah Do?”\n\n“Imagine the pastor today that had the stones to pick a fight and then slaughter 400 denominational leaders, slit their throats as a public event,” Driscoll said. “That’s Elijah.”\n\nIn response, Kirk quickly interjected, “Stay peaceful.” But on the podcast, Kirk also called most pastors these days “cowardly eunuchs” and claimed Kamala Harris slept her way to the top. In contrast, Kirk said Driscoll—a pastor known for his alleged unrepentant bullying, cult-like tactics, y teorias de conspiracion—is “one of the best, most important Bible teachers in the country, in the world actually.”\n\nDriscoll did not respond to a request by El Informe Roys (TRR) for comment.\n\nDriscoll was on Kirk’s podcast to promote his book called “New Days, Old Demons.” The book is described on Amazon as a “prophetic message for pathetic times” and likens “woke” politics and progressive Christianity to ancient paganism.\n\nDriscoll’s book, recent sermons, tweets, and interviews reveal an increasingly power-hungry, violent, conspiracy-obsessed, Christian nationalistic message, experts told TRR.\n\n“In the nation of Israel, they were supposed to be like us—a nation founded under God—and they weren’t,” Driscoll said on Kirk’s podcast. “Anytime you have a passive leader and a controlling, domineering, overbearing partner, the point is this: If you tolerate, they will dominate . . . It’s always God versus government.”\n\nDriscoll’s recent teachings are both a scary pivot and an unsurprising progression, said Jessica Johnson, anthropologist and author of “Biblical Porn: Affect, Labor and Pastor Mark Driscoll’s Evangelical Empire.”\n\n“The language of weapon and the graphicness of the language that they’re using is really striking to me,” said Johnson. “It’s a call to arms.”\n\nIs ‘political’ Mark in character or just desperate?\n\nDriscoll has long used provocative imagery. Driscoll famously called women homes for men’s penises under his pseudonym William Wallace II.\n\n“When Driscoll was preaching, he absolutely played off of certain notes about a crisis of masculinity that was happening at that time in the mid to late 90s and into the early 2000s, when the war on terror began,” Johnson said.\n\nThe church Driscoll founded, Mars Hill Church, closed in 2014 following a church investigation into Driscoll’s bullying behavior and Driscoll’s refusal to submit to the elders’ restoration plan.\n\nDriscoll’s popularity, especially among mainstream evangelicals took a major hit, Johson said. But since 2020, he has been popping up with conservative favorites such as Kirk and Steven Crowder.\n\nAnd his following on X, formerly known as Twitter, has grown to 434,000 followers. In comparison, the recently deceased Pastor Tim Keller, well respected by evangelicals, has 511,000 X followers.\n\n“The reason he talks so much about power is because Mark is all about power,” said Lance Ford, author of “UnLeader: Unimagining Leadership—and Why We Must.”\n\nDriscoll’s new book title is ironic and could be true—not of the U.S. government or American church—but of Driscoll’s new ministry, using old tactics, Ford said. Driscoll is pastoring a new church, Arizona-based Trinity Church, where allegations of abusive and cultic leadership have been reported.\n\n“His machismo, his focus on the flesh—he can’t help himself,” Ford said.\n\nIn the historically Republican Arizona, either his far-right views can be less ”cloaked,” or he’s re-platforming to cater to a white alpha-male, anti-government, QAnon-obsessed following, Johnson said. Or perhaps some of both.\n\n“I see this as a little bit of a desperate gambit to gain that kind of follower count, to try to reclaim the popular platform he had when he was at Mars Hill,” Johnson said. “That’s a dangerous combo.”\n\nIn the podcast with Kirk, Driscoll said if he’s going to be “cancelled,” then “make it fun.” He also used the concept of “cancel culture” to connect the days of Elijah with current times.\n\n“In the days of Ahab and Jezebel, they were dealing with drag queens overtaking,” he said. “What you had then was the Jezebel spirit takes over the government, closes the churches—as we saw globally during COVID—took over the Christian schools, took over the economy, cancelled, deplatformed, and killed anyone who disagreed.”\n\nDriscoll shrugged off criticism that he’s becoming too political.\n\n“Everything is political,” he said. “Truth is political. Life is political. Freedom is political. Church being open is political.”\n\nBut Driscoll is using terms that seem to be specifically targeting white males who are engaged in conspiracy theories, such as Pizzagate and Qanon, Johnson said.\n\nHe calls weak men “beta-males” which has been a term trending on Reddit, and referred to open borders as “Ahabianism,” an anti-immigration stance propagated by the Great Replacement Theory. He also brought up “child sacrifice,” a central idea of a conspiracy from 2016 that claimed Democratic Party leaders were involved in a child sex ring. Then as a pastor, Driscoll is legitimizing these ideas with spiritual language, Johnson said.\n\n“This updating and recontextualizing the Bible in terms of whatever is happening now is a very Driscoll move . . . to have an effect on his audience hat is recurrent and very timely,” Johnson said. “Everybody sort of feels on mission. It’s a move to inspire people as well as help them feel like they are actually living in biblical times.”\n\nJohnson has argued that violence-laden Christian nationalist ideas have influenced recent white terrorist acts and mass shootings. And recently, Driscoll isn’t holding back.\n\n“(The podcast) goes into a very violent, off-kilter direction, combined with political and religious or spiritual and this demonic agenda language that comes up over and over and over again,” she said. “It’s scary and needs to be taken seriously.”\n\nMen, you’re either with Driscoll—or you have to castrate yourself\n\nDriscoll hasn’t repented for his past abusive leadership, and therefore, Christians shouldn’t continue to follow and promote him, said Ford.\n\n“What Mark has done to others—the trail of tears that he left behind—you don’t get a platform,” Ford said.\n\nBut the fact that he has one points to ongoing systemic issues in evangelical churches, church growth theory, and Christian leadership, Ford said.\n\nFirst, Americans continue to be enamored with celebrity. Second, modern American Christianity, in general, has become consumeristic, with the churches as vendors of services meant to attract people, and the members buying the flavor they want, Ford said.\n\n“Most consumers are not concerned where the product comes from,” he said.\n\nThird, Christian leadership culture has been largely shaped by secular thinking on the matter.\n\n“It comes from corporate management theories that started in the industrial age, and it’s all about managing others and dominating others, the very thing Jesus said not to do,” Ford said. “Mark really conflates politics and social power with the way that you change things and change the world. You just don’t see Jesus doing it that way.”\n\nDriscoll mentioned castration several times in his interview with Kirk, saying that men who worked for Jezebel had to “cut your junk off.”\n\n“Everywhere there has been a dominant feminine female deity and spirituality in the history of the world—all religions, all cultures, all times and places—the men who are serving her have to castrate themselves and become transgender,” Driscoll said.\n\nThese Jezebel women “sleep their way to the top” and require the men in their kingdom to castrate themselves, Driscoll said. Kirk mentioned Vice President Kamala Harris’s name as an example, and Driscoll said he didn’t disagree. Later, Driscoll called Hillary Clinton a Jezebel.\n\nTransgenderism, and men who “emasculate themselves” is not only one of today’s biggest ills but was something church father Augustine deemed the “greatest threat to the spread of Christianity in the early Roman Empire,” Driscoll claimed in the podcast. This is because of demons, according to Driscoll.\n\n“People come and go, but the spirits remain the same,” he claimed. He added that pastors who aren’t preaching like himself are “cowards.”\n\n“They took the job because it’s indoors and doesn’t require heavy lifting,” Driscoll said. “Some guys were over-mothered and under-fathered . . . Some guys, they have church hurt and they’re bitter and they’re deconstructionist and they need to just get over their hurt and grow up and be a grown man. For some of them, they’re just poorly-read and they spent more money on their wardrobe than they have their library.”\n\nAccording to Driscoll, the only alternative to not being castrated seems to be to become Elijahs, Johnson said.\n\n“He makes it sound like we’re in this culture now where this is what men have to do in order to just survive,” Johnson said. “. . . You have to be a man like Elijah. You have to be willing to be a weapon. It’s very violent. It’s very scary stuff.”"
