The classic example is the \"Protestant ethic,\" where hard work and economic success is viewed as a sign of salvation (Weber 1904). For Jews, the history of Talmudic learning reinforces both the value of learning and critical thinking, making Jews one of the highest educated and financially successful religious groups in the United States (Hood, Hill and Spika 2009).\n\nAdherent: 1) A person who identifies with some religious tradition. It is a broader term than \"member\" because the latter refers to an official status that varies according to congregation or denomination. 2) Note that in ARDA's online Maps & Reports, \"adherent\" has a more specific meaning: \"All members, including full members, their children and the estimated number of other participants who are not considered members; for example, the 'baptized,' 'those not confirmed,' 'those not eligible for communion,' 'those regularly attending services,' and the like,\" according to the Religious Congregations and Membership Study, 2010 (Grammich et al. 2012: xvi).\n\nAdvent: A season of preparation for Christmas, more characteristic of Western Liturgical Churches. In Orthodox Churches, Advent is known as the \"Nativity Fast\" (Reid et al. 1990: 28).\n\nAdventist Family: Churches originating from founder William Miller in the late 19th century. Miller taught that Christ would soon return to earth and that Saturday, rather than Sunday, should be observed as the Christian Sabbath. The Adventist family includes the Seventh-day Adventist Church, which was founded by Ellen White and James Springer White, as well as offshoots such as the Advent Christian Church (Melton 2009: 560-561).\n\nAffiliation Change, Measure of: A survey measure of whether an individual has changed religious affiliation as an adult. Examples of this measure are found in the 2003 National Study of Youth and Religion, available in the ARDA’s Data Archive.\n\nAfrican Methodist Episcopal Church (AME): One of the largest black denominations in the United States. The denomination broke off from the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1787. In 1816, it was officially founded by Richard Allen in Philadelphia (Prothero 2008: 194).\n\nAfterlife: The fate of humans after death (Smith and Green 1995: 31). Descriptions of the afterlife will differ by cultural, historical and geographical context (see Egyptian Book of the Dead and Tibetan Book of the Dead). In Eastern religions, such as Hinduism or Buddhism, reincarnation is an afterlife concept. In the monotheistic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam discussions of the afterlife also entail whether an individual goes to either heaven or hell based on God's judgment (Hinnells 1984: 25-26).\n\nAgnosticism: A philosophical position neither affirming nor denying belief in a deity. Agnostics believe the question of whether God exists must be left open and unanswered. The concept comes from David Hume (1711-1776), who questioned the idea of causality, and by extension the historical accuracy of biblical miracles. The term \"agnostic\" was coined by Thomas Huxley (1825-1895), and was used as a method more than a belief system, claiming that one should seek truth until a certain point where the evidence becomes scarce or non-existent (Reid et al. 1990: 31).\n\nAhimsa: A term in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism that is often translated as \"non-violence,\" referring to not harming or wishing to harm. In Jainism, nonviolence is considered the highest moral duty, as Jain ascetics even attempt to avoid the injury and death of insects. Ahimsa also influenced Gandi and his nonviolent campaign in India (Prothero 2008: 194-195).\n\nAl-Qaeda: An international terrorist organization founded by Osama bin Laden in the 1980s. The organization seeks to establish a transnational Islamic empire that strictly adheres to Islamic law. The group is most famous for the attack on the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001. The leader, Osama bin Laden, was killed on May 2, 2011 by U.S. Navy seals and CIA operatives (Prothero 2008: 196).\n\nAlcohol/Drug Use, Religion and: The relationship between alcohol/drug use and religion is complex. In Jewish and Christian tradition, drinking wine was an ordinary occurrence, and some sacramental observances involved the use of wine. However, drunkenness tends to be denounced among the large world religions (Miller 1998). The use of drugs, like the hallucinogen Peyote, is common among Native American groups for religious purposes, but many religions tend to prohibit the use of mind-altering substances. In general, religiousness tends to be associated with less alcohol and drug use (see Koenig, King and Carson 2012).\n\nAli: One of the most important caliphs in Islam. He was cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, founder of Islam. Ali was brutally murdered in 661 CE by an assassin. Sunnis consider him the fourth caliph, while Shi'ite Muslims consider him the first. In addition, Shiite Muslims trace the lineage of the imams through him (Esposito 2011: 241).\n\nAlienation: A feeling of estrangement from society as a whole, or from its dominant institutions, but not necessarily estrangement from all local religious groups (Dean 1961; Neal and Rettig 1967).\n\nAll Saints Day: A feast celebrated in the Western Church on the first of November to commemorate Christian martyrs and all those who have led conspicuously holy lives. In the Eastern Church it is observed on the first Sunday after Pentecost (Reid et al. 1990: 36).\n\nAllah: A term in Islam, meaning \"God\" in Arabic. In the Koran, Allah is viewed as merciful and compassionate along with being all powerful (Prothero 2008: 195).\n\nAllen, Richard (1760-1831): Richard Allen was an influential black minister who established the African Methodist Episcopal Church in 1816, the first black denomination in the United States. For more information on Richard Allen, click here.\n\nAmillennialism: A Christian theological position that the thousand-year reign of Jesus Christ is symbolic, not literal, and is a period between the ministry of Christ and the Second Coming. It emphasizes the present reality of the Kingdom of God, and that the perfect age will not arrive until the establishment of the new heaven and the new earth. This is an alternative interpretation of Chapter 20 in the New Testament's Book of Revelation, and it differs from a premillennial interpretation (Reid et al. 1990: 57). See Premillennialism for more.\n\nAmish: A group of the Mennonites who broke away in the late seventeenth century, led by the minister Jacob Amman. He supported a strict interpretation of discipline and the practice of avoidance, shunning excommunicated members. They arrived in America in the early 1700s, and have retained a fairly separatist environment from modern culture ever since, preferring to cultivate a community more representative of the late seventeenth century (Melton 2009: 439). Examples of Amish churches include the Beachy Amish Mennonite Churches and Old Order Amish Mennonite Church\n\nAnalogical Imagination: A religious perspective that emphasizes God's presence in the world, expressed through every aspect of creation. Moreover, it stresses the community. The analogical imagination contrasts with the dialectical imagination, which stresses the individual and the belief that God has withdrawn from the sinful world. This concept was developed by Andrew Greeley (1989), who believed that Catholics tend to have analogical imagination, while Protestants tend to have dialectical imagination.\n\nAnanda: Cousin and disciple of the Buddha who lived in the sixth century BCE. He used his exceptional memory to recite the Buddha's sermons, and played a pivotal role in forming the Buddhist community after the Buddha's death. He also is known for his support of female disciples (Smith and Green 1995: 46).\n\nAnathema: 1) A Greek term referring to a curse in the New Testament. 2) In Catholicism, it refers to an open condemnation against immorality, heresy, or blasphemy by church authorities (Smith and Green 1995: 46).\n\nAnatman: A Buddhist doctrine denying the reality of a permanent, immortal soul as the spiritual center of a human. The term means \"no self,\" and it is meant to teach that all things are connected and there is no separate existence (Esposito et al. 2012a: G-6).\n\nAncestor Worship: The worship, feeding and petitioning of the souls of dead ancestors at home altars, temples and graves. This practice is most common among East Asian religions (Esposito et al. 2012b: G-15).\n\nAngel: A superhuman intermediary between the divine and human realm. Angels exist in Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Perhaps the most famous angel is Gabriel, who reveals himself as God's messenger in the Hebrew scriptures, Christianity's New Testament and Islam's Koran. Theological discussions of the nature of angels vary by tradition (Smith and Green 1995: 49-50).\n\nAnglican Family: Churches originating in England that broke with Roman Catholicism during the 16th century Reformation after King Henry VIII rejected papal supremacy. Some view the Anglican Church as a \"middle way\" between Catholicism and Protestantism, since both traditions have influenced Anglican theology and practice (Mead et al. 2005: 102). Churches in the Anglican family include the Church of England and the Episcopal Church in the United States. For more information on the Anglican family, click here.\n\nAnimism: The belief in an inner soul that represents the main identity for all humans, animals, plants and places. It places a large emphasis on ritualistic activities (Esposito et al. 2012b: G-2).\n\nAnomie: Often defined simplistically as “normlessness,” it also is used as a synonym for “demoralized” or “alienated,” and anomic society may be considered “disorganized.” The term has been popular in social science at least since Emile Durkheim’s (1897) book on suicide. Anomie can be interpreted in terms of the values and norms of society, both of which may be established and supported by religion (Stark and Bainbridge 1996: 18-19).\n\nAnti-Cult Movement: As new religious groups grew in popularity, in part due to the counterculture of the 1960s, conservative opposition emerged in the form of the anti-cult movement. Not only did anti-cult advocates fear unorthodox religious beliefs and practices, but parents of converts and ex-members would often accuse new religious groups of \"brainwashing\" converts. The anti-cult movement gained prominence in 1978, after 909 members of the People’s Temple died in Guyana after drinking cyanide-laced fruit juice. By the mid-1980s, however, the anti-cult movement began to dwindle, as American-based movements, like the Latter-day Saints, became more mainstream, and academics/health professionals largely debunked the “brainwashing” techniques suggested by the anti-cult movement.\n\nAnti-literal Religion: A simple rejection of literalist religious statements (Hunt 1972).\n\nAnti-Semitism: Unreasoning hostility toward and discrimination against the Jews. It can range from a formal doctrine and from mild antipathy to active efforts to kill the Jews. German writer Wilhelm Marr coined the term in 1880 to distinguish between secular hatred for the Jews as a people and hatred toward the Jewish religion, although the modern usage of the word denotes hatred for the Jews and Judaism in all forms (Smith and Green 1995: 53).\n\nAntichrist: In Christian literature, the Antichrist is an evil figure that deceives people into thinking that he is holy. In the end-times, according to the Christian tradition, Jesus will come back and defeat the Antichrist (Smith and Green 1995: 53). In Islamic eschatology, there also is an Antichrist figure that is depicted in the Hadith as a one-eyed monster from the East who rules the earth for a period of time before Jesus comes to vanquish him (Hinnells 1984: 44).\n\nAntinomianism: 1) The belief that certain religious allegiances exempt one from following secular law. 2) The belief that secular laws ought to be disobeyed because they are evil (Smith 1995: 53). 3) A theological position in which subjective elements of Christianity are emphasized over objective elements of Christianity, like moral law. The famous \"Antinomian Controversy\" took place in the 1630s, where Anne Hutchinson was brought to trial in Massachusetts for claiming to follow her direct revelation of the Holy Spirit instead of Scripture alone. She was banished from the colony in 1638 (Reid et al. 1990: 69).\n\nApocalypse: Catastrophic end-times battle between good and evil, in which good will triumph over evil. The Greek term refers to \"hidden things.\" The most famous apocalyptic literature is the Book of Revelation at the end of the New Testament. In contemporary usage, the apocalypse has been popularized by Tim LaHaye's Left Behind series of Christian novels (Prothero 2008: 197).\n\nApocrypha: A collection of books or chapters of books not included in the Hebrew Bible, but present in various Christian versions of the Old Testament, mostly in the Catholic and Orthodox traditions. These traditions see the Apocrypha as authoritative, whereas Protestantism does not. Protestant Bibles either exclude the Apocrypha or create a separate section for it found in-between the Old and New Testament. Traditions that include this collection of terms prefer the term \"deuterocanonical\" books, not the Apocrypha. The majority of these books were composed between the third century BCE and the first century CE. This collection of books is not to be confused with the pseudepigrapha or the Christian Apocrypha, which are not regarded as authoritative by any major branch of Christianity (Smith and Green 1995: 55).\n\nApologetics: The argumentation or defense on behalf of a certain religious faith. It is usually directed toward those outside the faith community, but the audience is usually those within the faith community (Reid et al. 1990: 71). Famous apologists include Orestes Brownson and Francis Schaeffer.\n\nApologist: One who engages in apologetics (see Apologetics). Famous apologists include Orestes Brownson and Francis Schaeffer.\n\nApostasy: Departing or falling away from a religious faith. In Christianity, it is the complete renunciation of the faith through either words or actions (Reid et al. 1990: 72).\n\nApostle: It refers to both the mission and representational authority of someone sent on a mission by a superior. In Christianity, \"apostle\" refers to the authoritative mission conferred to Christ on his disciples, with special emphasis on the Twelve Apostles and other specific people, to continue his mission on earth after his resurrection-ascension (Reid et al. 1990: 72).\n\nApostles' Creed: Short statement of Christian beliefs, attributed to Jesus' disciples, but officially written long after their deaths (Prothero 2008: 198).\n\nArchbishop: The bishop of an Archdiocese. The archbishop's power extends over an ecclesiastical province, not just a diocese. Catholic Churches, Eastern Orthodox Churches, and Anglican Churches maintain these hierarchal positions, although the jurisdiction, positional rank and specific role of the archbishop differs by tradition (Reid et al. 1990: 73). Famous archbishops in American Catholic history include James Gibbons and John Hughes.\n\nArchdiocese: A large diocese overseen by the Archbishop. Since the fourth century CE, neighboring dioceses have been grouped into provinces, and the most important province has been designated as the archdiocese, while the others are called \"suffragan dioceses.\" Catholic Churches and Eastern Orthodox Churches recognize archdioceses, although Eastern Orthodox Churches prefer the terminology of \"eparchey\" and \"archeparchy.\" Although Episcopalians organize dioceses into provinces, they do not officially recognize archdioceses (Reid et al. 1990: 74).\n\nArhat: One who has attained the final stage of enlightenment in Theravada Buddhism. Over time, a distinction arose between arhats and bodhisattvas, and some Mahayanists came to malign arhats as a selfish and inferior enterprise, lacking in the compassion of the bodhisattva. There has been some debate as to whether only monks and nuns or laypeople can be arhats, and whether arhats still exist today (Smith and Green 1995: 71).\n\nArmageddon: A term referring to the battle between god and evil in the last days. The term itself only appears once in the Bible in Revelation 16:16. \"Armageddon\" is a transliteration for the Hebrew word for \"Mount Megiddo\" in northern Israel (Prothero 2008: 198).\n\nAsbury, Francis (1745-1816): Francis Asbury was the preeminent leader of American Methodism after the Revolutionary War. When many Methodist missionaries fled back to England during the American Revolution, he stayed behind and continued spreading Methodism. For more information on Francis Asbury, click here.\n\nAsceticism: The complete renunciation of physical pleasures and other bodily desires in order to foster spiritual development. This practice is common in many religious traditions, including Buddhism, Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy and classical Hinduism (Smith and Green 1995: 77-78).\n\nAsh Wednesday: The first day of the Lent in the Western calendar, where individuals spread ashes on their forehead as a sign of penitence or mortality (Smith and Green 1995: 84).\n\nAshkenazi: Jews originating from central and eastern Europe. This group adopted Yiddish, a language based on medieval German. The majority of American Jews are Ashkenazi (Smith and Green 1995: 83).\n\nAssemblies of God: One of the largest Pentecostal denominations in the United States. As the Pentecostal movement began to flourish in the early 20th century, several diverse regional constituencies of the Reformed tradition desired to combine their efforts into one movement. Click here for more information on the founding of the Assemblies of God. Today they have a little under three million adherents (Smith and Green 1995: 84).\n\nAstral Projection: The experience of one's soul traveling outside the physical body into unknown realms of the universe. The belief in astral projection is found in many occult systems (Smith and Green 1995: 84).\n\nAstrology: Belief and practice of determining the influence of stars (Smith and Green 1995: 85).\n\nAtheism: A belief that God does not exist (Prothero 2008: 198).\n\nAtman: The Hindu concept that the soul resides in the heart, and is the source of life energy and spiritual awareness. In Hindu thought, the soul transmigrates after death (Esposito et al. 2012a: G-4).\n\nAtonement: A term in both Judaism and Christianity referring to the forgiveness of sins. For Christians, atonement is found through the death of Jesus Christ on the cross. For Jews, atonement is found on the holiday Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement), where practitioners ask God to forgive them of the sin they committed in the past year (Prothero 2008: 199).\n\nAttachment Theory: Attachment theory, under a religious framework, posits that religion can be explained by understanding the human need for attachment in general and one's relationship to her/his parents specifically.\n\nAttendance at Religious Services, Measure of: This survey item measures how frequently respondents attend places of worship. It is debatable how much measurement error is present in self-reported attendance, as people tend to over-estimate their participation (see Smith 1998). Examples of this survey item are found in the 2008 General Social Survey, 2005 Baylor Religion Survey and the 2003 National Study of Youth and Religion, all of which are available in the ARDA’s Data Archive.\n\nAttribution of Intentionality: Perhaps the most widely influential theory currently in the cognitive science approach to religion, it holds that faith in supernatural beings is a cognitive error that naturally springs from the way the human brain evolved.\n\nAuthoritarian Personality Scale: A battery of questions was developed to assess traits posited as aspects of an “authoritarian personality.” The battery examines a range of dimensions, but in general it attempts to determine levels of submission to authority and adherence to conventional or traditional values, accompanied by the belief that such values should be enforced on others. A separate personality dimension called “social dominance” also has been proposed in order to explain the sources of prejudice.\n\nAuthoritarian Religion: A type of individual religion where the main virtue is obedience and its cardinal sin is disobedience (Fromm 1950: 34).\n\nAuthoritarianism: The tendency to follow a strong leader or rigid social conventions. This is typically assessed through a high value on traditional conventions, a belief in an “objective” morality and the belief that this morality should be publicly enforced and/or imposed on others.\n\nAvalokiteshvara: The most popular and celestial bodhisattva in Buddhism, especially Mahayana Buddhism. He is the bodhissattva of compassion. In China, Avalokiteshvara is known as Guanyin, and is female (Esposito et al. 2012b: 424).\n\nAyatollah: The highest rank of Shi'ite Muslim clerics. The term literally means \"sign of God.\" An ayatollah is respected for his knowledge and his piety (Esposito 2011: 241).\n\nAzusa Street Revival (1906-1915): The Azusa Street Revival, led by William Seymour, took place in Los Angeles, where Seymour's congregants began experiencing miraculous healings, glossalia (i.e., \"speaking in tongues\"), and spontaneous worship. It was a defining event for early Pentecostalism and functioned as the catalyst to the growth of American Pentecostalism. For more on William Seymour and the Azusa Street Revival, click here.\n\nAzzi–Ehrenberg Model of Religious Activity: Based on the work of Azzi and Ehrenberg (1975), this economic model treats church attendance and religious contributions as a special form of household production, involving trade-offs between time and money inputs, secular versus religious outputs, and present versus afterlife utility (Iannaccone and Berman 2018). The Azzi–Ehrenberg model predicts that religious activity increases with age (in anticipation for the afterlife) and that households with high value of time (high wages) will substitute goods (religious contributions) for time in producing religious activity. Some question the assumptions behind the aging effect given how religious activity tends to increase with age even among those who do not believe in the afterlife (Ulbrich and Wallace 1983), but the assumptions underlying religious substitution (between time and money) are more widely accepted (see Religious Substitution Theory)\n\nB ▲\n\nBaha'i: A religion started in 19th century Persia (now Iran) by Mirza Husain Ali. The Baha'i faith is now worldwide and teaches the unity of God, the truth of his prophets, and continuation of revelation in every age. It has no priesthood, believing in spiritual equality between men and women (Parrinder 1973: 39).\n\nBaptism: The rite of applying water to a person, usually marking his or her entrance into the Christian church. It appears to have derived from John the Baptist in the first century CE, although some scholars believe that the act was inspired by the ritual ablution of the Jewish Essenes. Churches and denominations are divided on whether baptism literally or symbolically washes away sin (Smith and Green 1995: 102-103).\n\nBaptist: Protestants that originated from 17th century English Puritanism. The term \"Baptist\" came from their insistence that baptism should be reserved for those old enough to comprehend and confess a personal faith in Jesus. Modern Baptist churches teach that only believers should be voluntarily baptized by immersion (Reid et al. 1990: 110). For more on the Baptist family, click here. To interactively explore the history of Baptists in America, click here.\n\nBar Mitzvah: This Jewish ceremony, usually performed when a boy is 13, marks his passage into adulthood. The ceremony includes a reading from the Torah or the Prophets, and is followed by an elaborate party for friends and family (Smith and Green 1995: 104).\n\nBat Mitzvah: A Jewish ceremony, usually performed when a girl is 12, which marks her transition into adulthood. The ceremony includes a reading from the Torah or the Prophets, and is followed by an elaborate party for friends and family. The Bat Mitzvah is a fairly new rite of passage in modern times, and functions as a way to give the girl more of a role in Jewish public life (Hinnells 1984: 37).\n\nBelief in \"End Times,\" Measures of: Survey items measuring views toward certain religious predictions about the end of the world, such as Armageddon and the Rapture. An example of this item is present in the 2005 Baylor Religion Survey, which is available in the ARDA’s Data Archive.\n\nBelief in Angels/Demons, Measures of: These survey item measures whether a respondent believes in angels or demons. Examples of these items are found in the 2007 U.S. Religious Landscape Survey and the 2005 Baylor Religion Survey, both available in the ARDA’s Data Archive.\n\nBelief in Creationism/Acceptance of Evolution, Measure of: These variables can be used to explore whether or not respondents believe in a literal creation story or if creation should be taught in schools and whether they accept versions of evolutionary theory presented by contemporary science. Examples of these measures are found in the 2008 General Social Survey, 2007 U.S. Religious Landscape Survey and the 2005 Religion and Public Life Survey, all of which are available in the ARDA’s Data Archive.\n\nBelief in God, Measure of: This survey item assesses whether a respondent believes in God. Examples of this measure are found in the 2008 General Social Survey, 2005 Baylor Religion Survey and the 2005 Religion and Public Life Survey, all of which are available in the ARDA’s Data Archive.\n\nBelief in Heaven, Measures of: One’s views on the certainty of a positive afterlife existing, or occasionally, questions about who will be allowed to go there. Examples of these measures are found in the 2008 General Social Survey, 2005 Baylor Religion Survey and the 2005 National Study of Youth and Religion, all of which are available in the ARDA’s Data Archive.\n\nBelief in Hell, Measure of: This survey item assesses whether a respondent believes in hell or purgatory. Examples of this measure are found in the 2008 General Social Survey and the 2005 Baylor Religion Survey, both of which are available in the ARDA’s Data Archive.\n\nBelief in Jesus, Measure of: This survey item assesses what respondents believe about the divinity (or lack thereof) regarding Jesus. Examples of this measure are present in the 2005 National Study of Youth and Religion and the 2005 Baylor Religion Survey, both of which are available in the ARDA’s Data Archive.\n\nBelief in Satan, Measure of: This survey item measures whether a respondent believes in Satan/the devil. Examples of this measure are found in the 2005 Baylor Religion Survey and the 1991 General Social Survey, both of which are available in the ARDA’s Data Archive.\n\nBelief, Religious: On its most basic level, religious belief refers to views toward the supernatural. One of the most common measures for religious belief is whether respondents believe in God. A new strain of research is focusing not just on if individuals believe in God, but specifically what they believe God to be like, often referred to as a person's image of God.\n\nBhagavad Gita: The most popular scripture in contemporary Hinduism. It is part of a Hindu epic called the Mahabharata, written in Sanskrit between 200 BCE and 200 CE, and discusses Hindu ethics (Prothero 2008: 201).\n\nBible, Christian: The sacred text for Christians, comprising the Old and New Testaments. The Old Testament is comprised of thirty-nine books, further divisions of the twenty-four books in the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament contains twenty-seven books: the four Gospels of Jesus' life, the Acts of the Apostles, twenty-one letters, and the Book of Revelation. The canon of the New Testament became official in the Easter Letter of Athanasius in 367 CE. It is important to note that Bibles in the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches contain more books, including the apocrypha (Smith and Green 1995: 113).\n\nBible, Hebrew (Tanakh): The sacred text of Judaism, also known as the Old Testament for Christians. The Hebrew Bible is comprised of twenty-four books that are further divided into the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings (Smith and Green 1995: 113).\n\nBiblical Inerrancy: The belief that the Bible is without error, in terms of theology, ethics, history, geography, and science. This is common in Christian fundamentalism, as opposed to evangelicals who typically have a less strict view that the Bible, and instead simply believe that the Bible is the inspired word of God (Prothero 2008: 235).\n\nBiblical Literalism: The extent to which individuals believe that the Bible (or other sacred scriptures) should be interpreted literally. Social surveys that are interested in religion often ask a question pertaining to biblical literalism, though the question wording and response options can vary.\n\nBishop: A senior member of the clergy who is in charge of a diocese or association of congregations or parishes (Smith and Green 1995: 116).\n\nBlack Muslims: Members of the Nation of Islam. See Nation of Islam for more.\n\nBlack Protestantism: Also known as the Black Church, Black Protestantism is a unique religious tradition that has theological and structural similarities to white evangelical denominations, but also emphasizes social justice and community activism. Black Protestants tend to be liberal on economic issues, but conservative on social issues. Historically, seven major denominations compose this religious tradition, including the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Church of God in Christ, and the Progressive National Baptist Convention. For more information, click here.\n\nBlack Theology: A system of Christian thought that focuses on God as a liberator of the oppressed, specifically those in the black community. It derives from traditional African-American religion and liberation theology. Many attribute its development to the Civil Rights and Black Power movements of the 1950s/1960s (Reid et al. 1990: 161-164).\n\nBlasphemy: An act or verbal offense that mocks beliefs, sacred beings, or objects in a certain religion. In some religions, like Islam, blasphemy and heresy are sometimes used interchangeably (Smith and Green 1995: 118).\n\nBlood Transfusions and Jehovah’s Witnesses: It is a common practice for Jehovah’s Witnesses (JW) to refuse blood transfusions, even in life or death situations, on religious grounds. JW believe that one should not sustain one’s life with the blood or another creature, whether through drinking blood or taking someone else’s blood directly into their blood vessels. In this way, JW believe that Jehovah (God) condemns blood transfusions and will condemn those who receive them. Because of this, JW tend to refuse blood transfusions for themselves and their children. Although refusal among adults is accepted as one’s right to personal freedom, the refusal of blood transfusions for JW children is more controversial (Swan 1997). JW have typically lost legal cases involving the health of children (Koenig, King and Carson 2012: 65).\n\nBodhisattva (Bodhissata): One destined for enlightenment in the Buddhist tradition. In Theravada Buddhism, it is one on the way to becoming a Buddha. In Mahayana Buddhism, there are many Bodhisattvas, and they function as embodiments of ideals like compassion. One of the greatest bodhisattvas in Mahayana Buddhism is Avalokiteshvara, the bodhisattva of compassion (Parrinder 1973: 48).\n\nBook of Mormon: The sacred text of Latter-day Saints (Mormons), along with the Bible. It is said that the angel Moroni led church founder Joseph Smith to golden plates in 1827. According to Smith, the angel gave him gold plates that were engraved in what Smith describes as a reformed Egyptian language. The angel also gave him two divining stones, the Urim and Thummim, which were used to translate the text. The Book of Mormon tells the story of two groups of people: the Jeradites and the Israelites. According to the story, both groups came to America, although at different times, and both groups were eventually destroyed, with Native Americans as the last remnants of the Israelites in America. In the book, Jesus visits the New World after his resurrection and before his ascension. These revelations were officially published in 1830. Smith also received other revelations, including the Book of Moses, the Book of Abraham, and an alternate translation of the Bible (Melton 2009: 635-636).\n\nBook of Revelation: An important book in Christian apocalypticism and millenarianism. It is the last book in the New Testament canon, and it is written by John of Patmos. The book has traditionally been attributed to John the Apostle, but more recently scholars have questioned this assertion. The book deals with the end-times as well as persecution by the Roman government at the time. The writing heavily uses symbolic language and imagery (Smith and Green 1995: 927).\n\nBorn-Again: A term used by Jesus in the New Testament that is now employed to describe the conversion experience for many evangelical and fundamentalist Christians. The conversion experience includes the feeling of knowing Jesus, sensing the Holy Spirit, and putting off the old sinful self (Smith and Green 1995: 126).\n\nBrahman: A Hindu concept referring to the world spirit that arises at creation. Hindus believe that it is either in an impersonal form (Nirguna Brahman) or human form (Saguna Brahman) (Esposito et al. 2012a: G-4).\n\nBrain Drain (Religion): In the context of religion, it refers to the departure of highly productive/skilled members from religious groups. This may occur in communes because the demand for sharing resources equally may have an adverse effect on members who see themselves as more productive than others (Abramitzky 2011). The religious application of “brain drain” derives from secular theories of human capital flight, which focuses on the migration patterns of highly skilled or educated individuals across countries.\n\nBrainwashing: This controversial term refers to the possibility that coercive or deceptive indoctrination techniques can take control over a person’s mind; for example, causing the individual to join a radical new religious movement (i.e. “cult”). The connection between brainwashing and recruitment to religious movements was powerfully made in the aftermath of the culturally turbulent 1960s, both in popular culture and for scholars. However, a considerable body of research indicates that popular versions of the brainwashing theory, such as coercion and not just strong social influence, generally are unsubstantiated (see Snow and Machalek 1984).\n\nBranch Davidians: A breakaway Christian Adventist group that was infamously sieged by the U.S. government in 1993 at Mt. Carmel Center, the Davidians' compund outside Waco, Texas. The Branch Davidians began as an offshoot of the Davidian Seventh-day Adventist Association in 1930. After a divisive fight in the 1950s, Vernon Howell, who later assumed the messianic name of David Koresh, became the prominent leader of the group. Based on Koresh's interpretation of the Book of Revelation, the group stockpiled weapons in preparation for imminent final conflict. This attracted the attention of government officials, who in February 1993 launched a deadly gun battle, during which several federal agents and Branch Davidians died. That set off a siege of nearly two months. On April 19, federal authorities launched another attempt to raid Mt. Carmel. A fire erupted, the complex burned down and many members died, including David Koresh (Smith and Green 1995: 127-128).\n\nBrief RCOPE: A 14-item scale that is widely used by psychologists to measure religious coping (Pargament et al. 1998). Seven items assess positive religious coping strategies (e.g., seeking spiritual support, seeking religious help to forgive others, collaborating with God, etc.), while the other seven items measure negative religious coping strategies (e.g., believing God is punishing them, not loving, or has deserted them). Although positive coping tends to be more prevalent than negative coping, both tend to present themselves to some degree given the situation (see Koenig, Pargament, and Nielsen 1998). Many studies find that negative religious coping is associated with poor mental health, although there have been some cases where positive religious coping also was associated with poor mental health (for a discussion, see Koenig et al. 2012: 94-120). There also is a long version of the Brief RCOPE, known simply as the RCOPE, which consists of 105 items.\n\nBrownson, Orestes (1803-1876): Orestes Brownson (1803-1876) was a 19th century public intellectual in the United States. He defended Catholicism and its compatibility with American society, which was controversial at the time, for Catholics were a small minority that many Protestant Americans viewed with skepticism. For more on Orestes Brownson, click here.\n\nBuddha: It literally means one who has \"awakened,\" reaching enlightenment and escaping rebirth (see samsara). This also is the name given to Siddhartha Gautama, the founder of the Buddhist religion (Esposito et al. 2012a: G-6).\n\nBuddha-nature: The inborn essence of all sentient beings that enable them with the potential for Buddhahood. This is a prominent belief in Chinese Buddhism (Smith and Green 1995: 129).\n\nBuddhism: A world religion founded by Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha in the sixth or fifth century BCE in India. Teaching reincarnation and freedom from worldly attachments, Buddhism has three major branches: Theravada, Mahayana and Vajrayana. According to Buddhism, the origin of suffering comes from ignorance, and that one must follow the Eightfold Path to reach nirvana. Buddhism first came to America through Chinese immigration (Prothero 2008: 205-206).\n\nBuddhist: An adherent of Buddhism.\n\nBureaucracy: As discussed by Max Weber (1946), bureaucratic systems are noted by a system of rules that govern organizational behavior and procedures, as well as the presence of a well-defined hierarchy among positions within the bureaucratic order. Bureaucracy is a particularly useful lens for understanding organizational founding and emergent organizations, as it provides a framework for analyzing the formalization process within organizations. In the religious realm, as new churches are started, new denominations emerge and the parachurch sector continues to grow, bureaucracy is a way to study the trajectory of these organizations as they develop from an idea to a fully functioning organization (Weber 1946).\n\nBurka (Burqa): The garment that covers a Muslim woman's entire body (Esposito 2011: 242).\n\nC ▲\n\nCaliph: A title for the political leader of the Muslim community. Sunni Muslims believe that the most qualified person should be elected as a caliph, whereas Shi'ite Muslims believe that the caliph should come from the bloodline of Ali, Muhammad's cousin and son-in-law (Esposito 2011: 43).\n\nCalvinism: Also known as Reformed theology, Calvinism is a Protestant theological tradition based on the works of John Calvin (1509-1564). Calvin believed in the absolute sovereignty of God and the total depravity of humans. Calvinism also includes the doctrine of double predestination: the belief that God fated every human being, before birth, to either heaven or hell (Prothero 2008: 207).\n\nCane Ridge Camp Meeting: Barton Stone organized the Cane Ridge camp meeting (1801), the largest and most famous religious revival of the Second Great Awakening. It took place in Bourbon County, Kentucky, and he invited Presbyterian, Baptist and Methodist preachers. For more information on Cane Ridge Camp Meeting, click here.\n\nCanon: A general term for an authoritative set of sacred texts (Smith and Green 1995: 179).\n\nCanon Law: Church law or decrees given by an ecclesiastical authority for governing a given church. In Roman Catholicism, there is a history of systematic collections dating back to the 11th century, but the first code of canon law was promulgated in 1917, and was revised several times since its inception. It includes the obligations of the clergy and laity, missionary activities, Catholic education, worship and the sacraments (Reid et al. 1990: 219-220).\n\nCardinal: A papal-appointed position in the Roman Catholic Church responsible for electing new popes. The term originally applied to all clergy with permanent positions. Currently, there are more than 100 cardinals (Reid et al. 1990: 223).\n\nCarroll, John (1735-1815): John Carroll served as the first Catholic bishop in the United States and helped expand the Catholic Church domestically. For more information on John Carroll, click here.\n\nCaste System: A complex network of interdependent, yet separated, hereditary, occupationally specialized, and hierarchal social groups in India. It is a distinctive social institution in India, guided by religious principles in Hinduism, and yet transcending Hinduism in the sense that non-Hindus also are subject to the caste system. The structure of the caste system can be traced back thousands of years. Some scholars have recently questioned the emphasis of the caste system as a definitive representation of Indian society and culture. Some scholars even suggest that the caste system is a recent invention due to the fall of Hindu kings in the medieval period, or due to British colonial rule (Smith and Green 1995: 182-185).\n\nCatechism: A manual of instruction in the basics of the Christian faith. Various denominations have issued catechisms outlining basic teachings and practices of their faiths. Examples of catechisms include Luther's German catechism (1529) and the Roman Catechism (1566). Catechisms were an important tool in educating both Catholic and Protestant youths until recently, where many have viewed them as somewhat outdated (Smith and Green 1995: 186).\n\nCathedral: A building traditionally designated as the principal church of a diocese or archdiocese in the Catholic, Anglican and Orthodox traditions (Reid et al. 1990: 232).\n\nCatholic Church Abuse Scandal: The Catholic Church abuse scandal involves widespread allegations of child sexual abuse at the hands of Catholic clergy and institutional cover-ups by Catholic officials. Although accusations of clerical sexual misconduct had arisen in decades prior to 2002, investigative reporters for the Boston Globe revealed not only how prevalent it was, but how these incidents were dealt with internally within the Catholic Church. For more information on the abuse scandal, click here.\n\nCatholic Worker Movement: A Catholic movement created to serve the poor. It was founded by Dorothy Day and Peter Maurin during the Great Depression, and it still exists today. For more information, click here.\n\nCatholicism, Roman: The largest of Christianity's three main branches, which include the Eastern Orthodox Church and Protestantism. Catholicism maintains a hierarchy of bishops and priests, with the pope as the clerical leader. Notable differences from Protestantism also include the veneration of the Virgin Mary and other saints, the importance of church traditions, and the celibacy of the priesthood (Prothero 2008: 208). For more information on the Roman Catholic Church, including membership data, click here. To interactively explore the history of Catholics in America, click here.\n\nCelibacy: The renunciation of marriage and sexual relations as part of a religious vocation. Roman Catholic priests are celibate while Orthodox priests are not required to be celibate (Smith and Green 1995: 190-191).\n\nCharisma: Often distinguished by two very broad meanings: (1) possessing a divine gift, and (2) having the charm to inspire devotion in the minds of other people. The first definition immediately raises theological questions about what powers or special talents God gives to some people, and thus what particular provides the answers. The second definition raises a host of questions in social psychology about how one human being actually influences others, and has provoked longstanding debates about how the mass media confer celebrity status upon some public figures, including televangelists. Within the social science of religion, there even exists a third definition, which refers not to the charisma of an individual person, but to the distinction between charismatic movements that heavily emphasize personal relationships and more traditional or bureaucratic organizations that minimize this emotional factor (Weber 1922 [1978]).\n\nCharisma of Minister, Measure of: This survey item asks respondents if the reason they attended or joined a religious group was due to the charisma of a minister. An example of this measure is present in the 2000 General Social Survey, available in the ARDA’s Data Archive.\n\nCharismatics: Christians who stress spiritual gifts described in the New Testament, such as speaking in tongues and healing. Prior to 1960, this phenomenon was closely associated with the Pentecostal tradition (see Azusa Street Revival), but since then it has become a more general term that emphasizes the presence of the Holy Spirit, without a specific denominational affiliation (Smith and Green 1995: 194).\n\nChildhood Religiosity, Measures of: An approximation of how often respondents attended religious services and how religious they considered themselves at a given point in their childhood. This variable is used to approximate how respondents’ levels of religious involvement have changed over time and to estimate levels of religious socialization. Examples of this measure are found in the 2008 General Social Survey, 2005 Baylor Religion Survey and the 1998 General Social Survey, all available in the ARDA’s Data Archive.\n\nChildhood Religious Identity, Measure of: A survey measure of an individual’s religious affiliation or salience as a child. Examples of this measure are present in the 2008 General Social Survey, 2008 American National Election Study and the 2003 National Study of Youth and Religion, all of which are available in the ARDA’s Data Archive.\n\nChristian Apocrypha: Also known as the New Testament Apocrypha, it is a collection of non-canonical Christian writings purporting to contain information regarding Jesus and other first-century Christian leaders. Books in the Christian Apocrypha include the Gospel of Thomas and the Gospel of Peter. The major branches of Christianity do not view these books as authoritative, as many of them were written much later than the New Testament canon. The Christian Apocrypha is different from the Old Testament Apocrypha, or deuterocanonical books (Smith and Green 1995: 55).\n\nChristian Coalition: A conservative political pressure group composed of white evangelicals and Catholics that was established in 1989 by Pat Robertson after he failed to receive the Republican nomination in the presidential election. The Christian Coalition is the spiritual successor to Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority of the 1980s. Today, the group is known for promoting \"family values\" and a return to the nation's \"Christian heritage\" (Prothero 2008: 209).\n\nChristian Science Family: Churches following the teachings of founder Mary Baker Eddy (1821-1910), who believed that personal healing was the central message of Christianity. She believed that the correct interpretation of Scripture would alleviate disease, suffering, and even death according to her book Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures (1875). The movement became more of an institution in 1879. Worship services include readings from the Bible as well as Eddy's \"Science and Health.\" The largest group in the Christian Science family is the Church of Christ, Scientist (Smith and Green 1995: 264).\n\nChristianity: The largest of the world religions, comprising a third of the world's population. It views sin as a core human problem that can only be absolved through the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. The three main branches of Christianity are Eastern Orthodoxy, Roman Catholicism, and Protestantism (Prothero 2008: 209-210). See the ARDA's American Denomination: Profiles web page for specific denominations of Christianity.\n\nChristians: Adherents of the Christian religion. See Christianity for more details.\n\nChristmas: A Christian holiday generally celebrated on December 25th that commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ. Some Orthodox Christians celebrate Christmas on January 7th (Prothero 2008: 210).\n\nChristology: The theological study of Jesus Christ, mostly concerned with his person and nature (Reid et al. 1990: 263).\n\nChurch: 1) A building, program or service providing religious goods to a certain constituency and a specific geographical location. 2) Historically and theologically, it represents a Christian community founded on the teachings of Jesus Christ (Reid et al. 1990: 266).\n\nChurch/Sect Cycle: A cycle whereby new religious bodies begin as sects that have high tension with their surrounding environment and gradually transform into churches that have low tension with their surrounding environment. As members become less satisfied with their low-tension church, growing conflict within the group will erupt into a split, and the faction desiring a return to higher tension will found a new sect. This perpetuates an endless cycle of church-sect formation (Finke and Stark 1992:44-45).\n\nChurches as Firms: Churches may operate as “firms,” seeking to market their product to potential clients and “franchise” into new territories. Several sociologists of religion began thinking of churches as firms. For example, Finke and Stark (1992) explain the explosive growth of Methodist and Baptist churches in 19th century America to superior marketing, organization and clergy incentives (Iannaccone and Berman 2018).\n\nCircumcision: In Judaism, the cutting of the penis's foreskin as a sign of the covenant between God and Abraham's offspring. The practice is also common among Christians and Muslims, along with some indigenous groups (Esposito et al. 2012b: G-4).\n\nCivic Engagement: This refers to individuals’ levels of participation in civic society (public sphere). Concerning religion, a central question concerns whether religious participation facilitates only participation within the context of the religious group or tradition or also leads to higher levels of extra-group engagement. The research literature in this area has found some difference depending on the type of religious engagement one participates in. The idea of “social capital” is closely related to the idea of civic engagement.\n\nCivil Religion: A religio-political phenomenon describing the general faith of a nation or state, and its commonly held beliefs about the history and destiny of the nation. The term was coined by Jean-Jacques Rousseau in his book, Social Contract (1762). The concept was further developed by the sociologist Robert Bellah in 1967, referring to the historical belief that America represents \"God's New Israel\" (Reid et al. 1990: 281).\n\nCivilization Theory: Theories in this broad category assert that each major civilization, and perhaps smaller units as well in prehistoric times and remote regions, has a degree of cultural coherence, often marked by a distinctive religion. When two such civilizations come into contact, they compete, sometimes for several centuries, with resultant religious conflict. Also, it seems likely that every civilization eventually will exhaust its central cultural principles and collapse. Thus, these theories tend to concern the rise and fall of civilizations (see Gibbon 2001).\n\nClergy: Ordained leaders who carry out religious duties. Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and Anglican churches tend to emphasize the distinction between the clergy and the laity, although this distinction exists in various other Protestant denominations to a lesser degree (Reid et al. 1990: 293).\n\nClub Models of Religion: Club models of religion emphasize how effective congregations function more like families or social clubs rather than firms. Religious commodities are often enjoyed in groups, and this is leveraged in order to receive not just religious customers, but highly committed members. As a club, churches may demand greater inputs from members and prohibit alternative actions (directly or indirectly through stigma) that either compete for members’ resources or counter the goals of the group (Iannaccone 1992). Club models have made major contributions to our understanding of high-demanding ‘cults’, ‘sects’ and religious extremism, as studies have found substantially higher levels of mutual aid and social cohesion in more sectarian religious communities (Iannacconne and Berman 2018).\n\nCognitive Consistency: As influentially stated by Leon Festinger (1957), humans are theorized to have a natural need to form coherent mental models of the world, and thus they will exert effort to resolve any contradiction between two beliefs, or between a belief and a behavior. Festinger explicitly connects these abstract ideas to religion through the example of the Great Disappointment of 1843-1844, when William Miller’s prediction of the Second Coming was apparently disconfirmed. The theory of cognitive consistency predicts that people will join together to defend their beliefs against disconfirmation, perhaps resulting in religious innovation, like a new religious group or a reconciliation between religious ideas and potentially contradictory secular ideas\n\nCognitive Efficiency: This kind of theory postulates that the human mind naturally seeks simple models of reality, and that humans will tend to avoid extreme cognitive effort. This perspective is similar to, but distinguishable from, cognitive consistency theories.\n\nCognitive Evolution: The biological evolution of the human brain, which offers hypotheses about the nature of religion and variations across history and across subgroups in the population with respect to religious beliefs and practices (Watts and Turner 2014). Most obviously, if evidence shows that religion has on balance been beneficial for humanity, it can be said to have evolved over time through natural selection from the varieties of ideas and activities oriented toward the supernatural that naturally spring up. However, that simple idea leaves open whether the evolution was primarily biological or cultural, and it does not immediately suggest what kinds of research could clarify the mechanisms involved and establish the degree of truth to the theory. Because of this, cognitive evolution theory, as it applies to religion, is widely debated.\n\nCognitive Theories: Cognitive theories of religion seek to integrate the scientific study of the mind, intelligence and cognition into explanations of religious belief. Several cognitive theories of religious phenomena include attribution of intentionality, cognitive consistency, cognitive efficiency, modes of memory and pragmatic epistemology.\n\nCommunal Family: Churches where members often live together or share living activities, such as common meals, as an expression of their faith. The Hutterian Brethren is an example of a communal church (Smith and Green 1995: 275).\n\nCommunes, Religious: Communities that share beliefs and possessions while striving internally for equality. The Shakers were fairly successful in maintaining communes in the 18th and 19th century. Economist Ran Abramitzky has argued that communes come with risks, specifically, the possibility that more productive members may leave (brain drain), the tendency to shirk (moral hazard), and the potential for less productive members to join (adverse selection). In order to counteract these issues, communes must enforce social sanctions; enhance commitment, loyalty, and cooperation; and create lock-in devices (Abramitzky 2011).\n\nCommunion: 1) The Christian commemoration of Christ's last supper by partaking of the elements of bread and wine (or grape juice). The various churches and denominations are divided on whether these elements actually become Christ's body and blood or symbolize them (see Transubstantiation). Communion also is known as the Eucharist in some Christian traditions. 2) The fellowship of all Christians on earth and in heaven. 3) A specific Christian church or family of churches (Hinnells 1984: 94).\n\nComplementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) Scale: Health care approaches developed outside of mainstream Western, or conventional, medicine (National Institutes of Health 2018). When used in conjunction with conventional medicine, it’s considered “complementary,” but when used as a replacement for conventional medicine, it’s considered “alternative.” CAM approaches include natural products, like herbs or probiotics, as well as mind and body practices, like yoga and meditation. Historically and in modern times, spiritual practices may function as CAM treatments, as prayer remains the most common practice used for healing (P.M. Barnes et al. 2004).\n\nConfession: A sacrament in the Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches in which a penitent confesses his or her sins to a priest and is absolved of them. In Roman Catholicism, confession is only one part of the entire sacrament of penance (Smith and Green 1995: 280).\n\nConfirmation: This ceremony marks the reception of young Christians (usually in their early teen years) into full participation in the life of the church. Confirmation is most often celebrated in the Roman Catholic, Episcopal, Lutheran, Methodist and Presbyterian denominations (Smith and Green 1995: 280).\n\nConfucianism: A Chinese religion founded by Confucius (551-479 BCE), whose goal was to foster social harmony through a combination of self-cultivation and social rites. Chinese Immigrants brought Confucianism to the United States in the 19th century (Prothero 2008: 211-212).\n\nConfucius (551-479 BCE): A Chinese philosopher who taught concepts of righteousness and of \"being fully human.\" His disciples helped spread his philosophy, which later became known as Confucianism in the Han dynasty. His name actually was Master K'ung, but Catholic missionaries later referred to him as Confucius, a Latinized version of his name (Esposito et al. 2012: 491-492).\n\nCongregation: Any local gathering of believers for worship. This can be thought of as a more inclusive term for church, since many religious traditions use different names for their place of worship. Usually this refers to a building or physical structure, but it also could refer to a more fluid group of people without a specific building (e.g. a 'congregation' that meets in member's homes).\n\nCongregationalism: A system of church governance in which the members hold most of the power, such as electing the clergy and making other major decisions. 2) Congregationalism can also refer to the church tradition stemming from the English Puritans of the 17th century and now found in the United States in the United Church of Christ and smaller Congregationalist bodies (Smith and Green 1995: 285-286).\n\nConservative Judaism: An offshoot of Reform Judaism in America that officially began in the early 20th century, but traces its early thought pattern to European Jews in the mid-19th century. The founders desired to reaffirm the validity of the Jewish past while still emphasizing the need for Jews to modernize. The movement claims to be an authentic continuation of rabbinical Judaism while still maintaining a sense of relevance in modern times (Smith and Green 1995: 286-287).\n\nConservative Protestantism: A broad social category of Protestantism that advocates a conservative theological position (e.g., the inspiration of the Bible, the physical resurrection of Jesus Christ, etc.). Conservative Protestants are often subdivided into Evangelical Protestants and Fundamentalists, who differ in terms of their engagement with the secular non-Christian world.\n\nControl Theory: Control theory, as originally formulated by Travis Hirschi (1969), posited that group member behavior is regulated by four aspects of social bondedness: attachment, commitment, involvement and belief. In the sociology of religion, Rodney Stark (Hirschi and Stark 1969; Stark et al 1982) extended this theory in subsequent studies of the relationship between religion and delinquency. The \"Stark Effect,\" that the power of religion to deter delinquency depends upon the proportion of the community that is religious, was an outcome of this extension.\n\nConversion: A turning away from one way of life to another. In Christianity, it is a turning away from sin and toward a new life of Christ. Most churches agree on the need for conversion, but its relationship with salvation is debated between religious groups (Reid et al. 1990: 316). Some sociologists of religion define conversion as the shift in religious allegiance from one religious tradition to another, from Judaism to Christianity, for example. These scholars would define the shift from the Baptist to the Catholic tradition as a process of reaffiliation, not conversion (Stark and Finke 2000: 114).\n\nConversion Experience, Measure of: This survey item asks whether a respondent identifies with undergoing a religious conversion experience of some kind. Examples of this measure are found in the 2005 Baylor Religion Survey and the 2001 U.S. Congregational Life Survey, both of which are available in the ARDA’s Data Archive.\n\nConversion Theory: Inspired by Lofland’s field research on recruitment to the Unification Church, Conversion Theory offers a series of steps a person must go through in order to become a member of a new religious group: 1) experience enduring, acutely felt tensions within a religious problem-solving perspective, which leads him to define himself as a religious seeker; 2) encountering the group at a turning point in his/her life, wherein an affective bond is formed (or pre-exists) with one or more converts; 3) where extra-cult attachments are absent or neutralized; 4) and where, if he is to become a deployable agent, he is exposed to intensive interaction (Lofland and Stark 1965).\n\nConversion Therapy: Conversion therapy is the controversial practice of converting homosexuals into heterosexuals (Hood, Hill and Spika 2009). Many conservative religionists believe that conversion therapy is effective (Haldeman 1994). However, research on its effectiveness has been scant apart from anecdotal statements. Shidlo and Schroeder (2002), using a rigorous selection process, interviewed 202 recipients of conversion methods by 308 therapists. Two-thirds of the clients were religious. Eighty-seven percent of respondents viewed the therapy as a failure. Half of the 13 percent “success” stories experienced relapses.\n\nCoping Theory: The way in which individuals use religion to cope with difficult situations and make sense of events in their lives (Pargament 1997). Originating in psychological studies of religion, research and theory indicate that religious coping is more likely to occur in situations perceived as uncontrollable.\n\nCost-Benefit Analysis (Religion): The tendency of humans to weigh the benefits of certain actions against their costs in the contexts of religion. This is a key component of rational choice framework in the economics of religion. For example, individuals may ask themselves, “What are the benefits/costs to me to believe in salvation?” (McCleary 2011). Pascal’s Wager is a famous example of using a cost-benefit analysis to support the belief in God, as the costs of belief are low but the potential rewards (e.g., heaven) are high.\n\nCoughlin, Charles (1891-1979): Charles Coughlin was a Catholic \"radio priest,\" who was controversial for his anti-Semitic, pro-Nazi views leading up to World War II. Although he garnered millions of listeners, the U.S. government and church authorities were disturbed by Coughlin, and they eventually pushed him off the air in 1942. For more information on Charles Coughlin, click here.\n\nCounseling, Religious: A type of counseling that incorporates religious teachings to serve mental health needs. Many clients are already religious, although counselors may reach out to those nominally religious, homeless or poor. Depending on the particular faith group, counseling may incorporate prayer, meditation or scripture reading. Some forms of religious counseling may be completely faith-based, while others may incorporate secular therapeutic practices (Koenig, King and Carson 2012: 56-57).\n\nCreationism: The belief that the creation account of Genesis, the first book of the Bible, is historically and scientifically correct. This has led to some confrontation with proponents of Darwinian evolution, most notable in the infamous Scopes Trial of 1925 in Dayton, Tennessee. More recently, former creationists have advocated Intelligent Design instead of creationism to counter evolutionary claims (Prothero 2008: 213-214).\n\nCreed: A confession or adherence to selected essentials of religious faith. Creeds are especially prominent in liturgical traditions. Some groups, like those in the Restoration Movement, state that there is \"no creed, but Christ.\" Baptist groups also resist creedal statements. The most famous creeds are Christianity's Apostles' Creed and Nicene Creed (Reid et al. 1990: 327).\n\nCrosby, Frances \"Fanny\" (1820-1915): Fanny Crosby was a blind Christian hymn writer who wrote thousands of famous hymns, including \"Blessed Assurance,\" \"Jesus Keep Me Near the Cross,\" and \"To God Be the Glory.\" For more information on Fanny Crosby, click here.\n\nCross: 1) A sign widely used in the history of religion to express the structure of the cosmos. 2) An instrument of execution used by the Romans. 3) A Christian symbol of salvation and God's compassion on humanity by allowing his Son, Jesus Christ, to die for humanity's sins (Smith and Green 1995: 297).\n\nCrucifix: A cross bearing the figure of Christ. It is often used to represent the suffering of Christ. It became an important image for devotional purposes in the Middle Ages, but was viewed as idolatry by many Protestant Reformers, which is why many Protestant churches prefer the symbol of a cross without Jesus on it (Reid et al. 1990: 330).\n\nCrusades: Medieval military campaigns of the eleventh through fifteenth centuries waged by Christians to recapture Jerusalem from Muslims (Prothero 2008: 214).\n\nCult: 1) A new and unconventional religious movement that is often founded on the teachings of a new prophet and/or new sacred text. 2) The ARDA and other scholars tend to use the term \"new religious movements\" rather than cults because the latter term carries negative political and social connotations and prejudices associated with those belonging to such groups. 3) In popular use, people often refer to sects as cults (Smith and Green 1995: 298).\n\nCultural Theories of Religion: Theories of religion that examine how religious institutions, communities and symbols are embodied and connected to other aspects of society. Generally speaking, studies using cultural theories focus on how cultural boundaries and meanings are constructed by interpretive communities, as well as how the institutions and symbols of religion are used in both mediated communication and social interactions (Hall, Neitz, and Battani 2003).\n\nCyclical Theory: Asian religions, and some classical western philosophers, believed that history consisted of an endless series of cycles: the Wheel of Life, eternal return, or eternal recurrence. More recently, sociologist Pitirim A. Sorokin proposed that each great civilization emerges out of a period of chaos with a set of empowering spiritual beliefs which eventually erode, leaving only materialist interests and leading again to chaos and conflict.\n\nD ▲\n\nDaily Spirituality Experiences (DSE) Scale: A popular scale used to assess spirituality in health studies (Underwood and Teresi 2002). The scale is actually a subscale of the widely used Fetzer Institute’s Multidimensional Measure of Religiousness and Spirituality. It consists of either six or 16 items, depending on whether the researcher is using the long or short form. Some of the items include, “I feel deep inner peace of harmony,\" “I am spiritually touched by the beauty of creation” and “I feel thankful in my blessings.” However, Koenig and colleagues (2012) argue that the scale suffers from measurement contamination, as it is unclear whether some of the items are measures of spirituality or outcomes that are the result of spirituality. For example, is feeling peaceful the sign of spirituality or the result that comes from being spiritual? When used to predict other mental health outcomes, findings become difficult to interpret and tautological (i.e., the independent and dependent variables reflect the same phenomenon). Similar concerns have been voiced regarding the CAM, FACIT-SP and WHOQO-SRPB scales (see Koenig et al. 2012: 43-44).\n\nDamnation: Condemnation to punishment in the afterlife for sins committed while alive. This is said to occur on judgment day, and the eternal abode for the damned is hell (Smith and Green 1995: 303).\n\nDay, Dorothy (1897-1980): Dorothy Day was a Catholic activist known for co-founding the Catholic Worker movement, leading anti-war and anti-nuclear proliferation movements, and promoting assistance to the poor. For more information on Dorothy Day, click here.\n\nDeacon: A minister ranking below a priest in the Anglican, Catholic and Orthodox churches. In most Protestant churches, deacons are not ordained and are seen as people who assist the clergy (Reid et al. 1990: 344).\n\nDeath, Religion and: Religion, death and the afterlife are strongly tied to each other for many individuals. The religious scriptures of the main world religions support the belief in life after death and eternal rewards for adherents. Religion also tends to be used to cope with difficult life situations (see Coping Theory), so it’s understandable that individuals use religion to cope with the uncertainty and pain associated with death. It perhaps is little surprise that religiosity often is associated with less fear of personal death and less grief after the death of a loved one (Koenig et al. 2012). A study of Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) members found that church attendance and belief in life after death reduced fear of the unknown beyond this life (Silton et al. 2011). In a study by Brown and colleagues (2004) looking at widowed persons over the age of 65, they found that respondents who increased in religious importance tended to have lower grief scores over time.\n\nDeconversion: The processes involved in leaving religious groups (Hood, Hill and Spilka 2009: 233). Most of the research on deconversion has focused on leaving strict new religious movements, but some have focused on mainstream religious groups (see Streib et al. 2009). In general, only a small percentage of denominational members completely reject their denominational identity and never return again, but this certainly varies by religious group.\n\nDeism: A rationalistic religion based on religion and nature instead of revelation. Deists believe in one God and in an afterlife of rewards and punishments, but they reject both miracles and prayers. This position spread under the Enlightenment period and influenced the founding fathers of the United States (Prothero 2008: 216).\n\nDeity: Typically, a supernatural being considered holy or sacred.\n\nDelinquency/Crime, and Religion: Problem behavior, usually by the young, that is either against the basic principles of society or is harmful to society or is in violation of the law (Koenig et al. 2012: 243). Teenage drinking and drug abuse may be viewed as delinquency. Religion/spirituality often operates as a protective factor against delinquency, especially since many religious groups often prohibit delinquent behaviors (see Alcohol/Drug Use and Religion). Koenig and colleagues (2001) looked at 39 studies on religion/spirituality and delinquent behaviors and found that 79 percent of the studies found lower rates of antisocial, delinquency, or crime among those who were very religious. Among studies of the highest quality, 91 percent found an inverse relationship between religion and delinquency (Koenig et al. 2012).\n\nDemand-Side Model of Religion: Demand-side models of religion emphasize that changes in religious demand impact religious participation or vitality in society (Olson 2011). For example, religion may be in demand during times of greater stress or national trauma and perhaps in less demand over time due to secularization (see Bruce 2002). This perspective is heavily challenged by supply-side theories of religion (see Supply and Demand, Religious).\n\nDemographic Transition Theory: According to this theory, fertility and mortality rates change in a predictable manner, when a society evolves from a traditional to a modern form. Initially, death rates are high, because of the primitive technology and economic poverty of a traditional society, so birth rates were also high to sustain a stable population. At the beginning of modernization, technological and economic progress reduces the death rate, but the birth rate remains high through social inertia, so there is a population explosion. Eventually, the birth rate comes down as well, and the result is a stable population with low fertility and mortality rates. The immediate relevance to religion is two-fold, because low birth rates undercut some of the family related variables that encourage religious participation and because one of the few factors that could sustain fertility at the replacement level is religion. However, only fundamentalist religions may have sufficient fertility, and thus society ironically may become more religious, rather than less, through modernization. This perspective has been used to explain the relative success of more conservative religious movements (e.g., Evangelical Protestants), in spite of the high numbers of disaffiliates in post-industrial world.\n\nDemon: A superhuman being between humans and gods, which can have benevolent or malevolent intentions based on the religious tradition. In Christianity, they are considered evil. In Hinduism, demons belong to many castes and are sometimes hard to distinguish from gods (Smith and Green 1995: 311).\n\nDenomination: A larger religious organization or structure to which a congregation may be a member. Usually, congregations within a denomination are united by some historical and/or theological tradition. Congregations not belonging to a denomination are usually called \"independent\" or \"non-denominational\" (Melton 2009: 3).\n\nDenomination, Measure of: This divides affiliation within Protestantism into differing religious organizations. This is a standard question available in a wide range of data sets, including the 2008 General Social Survey, 2005 Baylor Religion Survey and the 2007 U.S. Religious Landscape Survey, all of which are available in the ARDA’s Data Archive.\n\nDenominational Continuum: A spectrum of denominational characteristics that range from “extremist” religious groups with high demands of sacrifice on one side, and “lenient” groups that demand little of their members on the other side. The “extremist” groups tend to be exclusive, strict, small, and suspicious of others, while the “lenient” groups tend to be inclusive, less costly, larger, and more tolerant of secular values. It is suggested that a denominational continuum exists within each religious tradition (e.g., Christianity, Judaism, Islam, etc.), and that groups on a certain side of the spectrum will share similar social characteristics even if their history and theology differ (Iannaccone and Berman 2006).\n\nDenominationalism: Denominationalism refers to the subdivision of a particular religion. A common example is Protestant Christianity in the United States, which is subdivided into multiple denominations (e.g., Baptist, Methodist, etc.).\n\nDeuterocanonical Books: See Apocrypha.\n\nDevotionalism: The frequency at which an individual performs religious rituals and comparable behaviors, notably prayer and Bible reading, often measured independently of group activities such as church attendance (Roof 1976).\n\nDharma: The proper course of conduct, norms and ultimate realities in the Buddhist religion. Dharma is central to Buddhist practice. The term also exists in Hinduism and Brahmanic thought as a set of ritual actions sanctioned by the priestly class (Smith and Green 1995: 315).\n\nDialectical Imagination: A religious perspective emphasizing the individual and the withdrawal of God from the sinful world. The dialectical imagination contrasts with the analogical imagination, which stresses the community and the expression of God through every aspect of creation. The differing concepts were developed by Andrew Greeley (1989), who believed that Catholics tend to have analogical imagination while Protestants tend to have dialectical imagination.\n\nDiaspora: The dispersion of a religious people outside their geographic homeland, where they must live as a minority among others (Esposito et al. 2012: G-4).\n\nDifferential Association: Edwin Sutherland (1947) postulated that criminal behavior was chiefly learned within intimate personal groups as mental associations between concepts and definitions of situations are learned in complex patterns of communication with others. Applied to the study of religious conversion, this theory suggests that the frequency, duration and intensity of definitions and information favorable to a given religion, if greater than unfavorable ones, may lead someone to convert.\n\nDiocese: The wider regional structure connecting parishes and other local organizations that is overseen by a bishop (Reid et al. 1990: 357).\n\nDisaffiliation: The opposite of conversion, disaffiliation refers to the process of leaving a religious organization or disavowing one's former religious identity.\n\nDisciple: A pupil who is attached to a specific teacher or way of life (Smith and Green 1995: 317). In the Christian tradition, John the Baptist and Jesus had disciples. Peter is a famous disciple of Jesus. The term also has been used in the Buddhist tradition. For example, Ananda was a disciple and cousin of the Buddha.\n\nDispensational Premillennialism: The belief held by some Christians that the current dispensation, or historical period, is near the end, and will conclude with the rapture of the believers into heaven. Jesus will come down from heaven to fight the Antichrist and establish a thousand-year reign of peace. British theologian John Nelson Darby (1800-1882) developed this theology and it spread to the United States after the Civil War. This type of theology was made popular by the Scofield Reference Bible and the fictional Left Behind book series. It is one of the most popular forms of prophecy belief in the United States (Prothero 2008: 217).\n\nDispensationalism: A Christian theological view that divides history into several periods, or dispensations. God's plan for salvation differs according to the dispensation (Smith and Green 1995: 318).\n\nDivination: The determination of the hidden significance of things through a variety of techniques. Divination often is performed by specialists and is historically common in Chinese and Japanese religions (Smith and Green 1995: 318-319).\n\nDivinity: A term frequently used prior to the 20th century to refer to the study of theology or the \"science of divine things.\" The term also could refer to the quality of being divine as well as to God himself (Reid et al. 1990: 359).\n\nDoctrine: An official teaching of a religious group. Religious bodies and officials often establish doctrine through written statements or councils. In a Christian context, the Trinity serves as an important doctrine. In Buddhist, Hindu, and Jainist traditions, ahimsa is an important doctrine (McBrien 1995: 424).\n\nDogma: Dogma is understood as a principle component of a religious ideology that is non-disputable. The Greek word is \"dokeo,\" which means \"appears.\" Dogma is particularly found in Roman Catholicism, explicitly stated in ecumenical councils or by the pope. In a non-liturgical setting, it has a pejorative connotation. In the context of the Catholic Church, the Nicene Creed contains dogmata (Reid et al. 1990: 361; McBrien 1995: 424).\n\nDome of the Rock: A domed shrine in Jerusalem that houses the rock upon which the Prophet Muhammad ascended into the Seven Heavens during his night journey. It was constructed by the Caliph Abd al-Malik and was finished in 691 CE (Smith and Green 1995: 320).\n\nDominionism: The belief that Christians should hold positions of power in society and government based on biblical law. Dominionism has close ties to Christian nationalism, which suggests that it is important to reunite church and state in the United States because the Founding Fathers believed in a Christian nation.\n\nE ▲\n\nEaster: A Christian holiday commemorating the resurrection of Jesus Christ three days after his crucifixion. It is known as \"Pascha\" by Orthodox Christians (Prothero 2008: 218).\n\nEastern Liturgical (Orthodox) Family: One of the three great divisions of Christianity; the others are the Protestant churches and the Roman Catholic Church. The Catholic and Orthodox churches were originally united, but they parted in the eleventh century, when they differed over several points of doctrine, including the supreme authority of the pope, which Orthodox Christians reject (Melton 2009: 169-172). Since the 20th century, the Catholic and Orthodox churches have made greater efforts toward reconciliation.\n\nEcclesiastic: A broad term for anyone who specializes in religion. The person helps to explain, supervise, and/or conduct exchanges with a god or gods (Stark and Finke 2000: 279).\n\nEconomic Theories of Religion: The understanding of religious phenomenon through economic theory and principles. Economic theories of religion trace back to Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations ([1981] 1776), in which he argued that religious competition improves the quality of religious services, whereas government regulation reduces the quality of religion and promotes conflict. (Smith 1776: 788–814). Economic theories of religion are a subfield of economics and religion, which also looks at religion’s economic consequences (see Weber’s Protestant Ethic 1904) as well as religious assessments of economic policy (see Iannaccone and Berman 2018).\n\nEcumenism: A movement supporting closer relations and unity between Christians. Often this means denominational dialogues and even mergers (Reid et al. 1990: 377).\n\nEddy, Mary Baker (1821-1910): Mary Baker Eddy (1821-1910) founded the Christian Science movement, a religious body that believes illness is an illusion. She helped establish a church of 100,000 members and founded the Christian Science Monitor, which still exists today. For more on Mary Baker Eddy, click here.\n\nEdwards, Jonathan (1703-1758): Jonathan Edwards is the most influential theologian in American religious history and helped start the First Great Awakening. He was a Congregational preacher with a calm preaching style, though he is ironically known for his passionate 1741 sermon entitled \"Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God\". For more information on Jonathan Edwards, click here.\n\nEgyptian Book of the Dead: A collection of more than 200 prayers, spells, and illustrations to ensure a peaceful afterlife for the dead. It dates back to the second millennium BCE in Egypt (Smith and Green 1995: 331).\n\nEightfold Path: As a culmination of the Four Noble Truths in Buddhism, it charts the course from suffering to nirvana. It is further divided into three parts: wisdom (right view and right intention), morality (right speech, right conduct, and right livelihood), and concentration (right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration). It also is known as the \"middle way\" (Prothero 2008: 189-190).\n\nElder: In various churches, especially the Presbyterian-Reformed tradition, the elders are laypeople who share authority and leadership with the clergy (Smith and Green 1995: 335-336).\n\nEmerson, Ralph Waldo (1803-1882): Ralph Waldo Emerson was an influential writer/minister who promoted Transcendentalist thought, which emphasized experiencing God through lived experience and intuition. For more information on Ralph Waldo Emerson, click here.\n\nEncyclical: A statement or document on an important issue written by the pope or bishops to fellow Catholics. These statements often pertain to controversial social issues, like poverty (Rerum Novarum, 1891), human rights (Pacem in Terris, 1963), contraception (Humanae Vitae, 1968), as well as abortion, birth control, euthanasia, and capital punishment (Evangelium Vitae, 1995) (Prothero 2008: 219).\n\nEnd-Times: The belief that the world is coming to an end and God's kingdom will be established. See Apocalypse.\n\nEnlightenment: The experience of knowing the cause of suffering in the Buddhist tradition. Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha, is said to have experienced enlightenment under the Bodhi tree (ca 530 BCE) (Smith and Green 1995: 338).\n\nEschatology: A broad theology concerning the End-Times, and processes of salvation. The term was first used in the nineteenth century with the advent of critical biblical studies. Topics in eschatology include Armageddon, millennialism, the Second Coming, and the Messiah (Smith and Green 1995: 342).\n\nEucharist: The Christian ritual that focuses on the life, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The term has existed since the second century CE and comes from a thanksgiving prayer that acts as an important element of the rite. It also is known as the Divine Liturgy, Holy Communion, Lord's Supper, or Mass (Smith and Green 1995: 345).\n\nEuropean Free Church Family: Churches that left established and state churches in Europe over the belief that congregational activity and membership should be voluntary and free of state control. Examples of these churches include the Society of Friends (Quakers) and the Evangelical Covenant Church, which is the result of a schism from the Church of Sweden in the 19th century (Melton 2009: 433).\n\nEvangelical Protestantism: A movement in Protestantism emphasizing one's personal relationship with Christ, the inspiration of the Bible, and the importance of sharing one's faith with non-believers. Evangelical Protestantism is usually seen as more theologically and socially conservative than Mainline Protestantism, although there is obviously variation between denominations, congregations, and individuals within the \"evangelical\" category (Reid et al. 1990: 413).\n\nEvangelism: The Christian practice of sharing the gospel of Christ with non-believers. This term comes from the New Testament Greek word \"euangelizomai,\" which means \"to proclaim the good news\" (Reid et al. 1990: 416).\n\nEvangelist: One who engages in evangelism. See evangelism.\n\nExcommunication: The banishment of an individual from a religious community. This practice exists in some Jewish and Christian communities (Smith and Green 1995: 351).\n\nExorcism: The process of driving out demons/evil spirits from human beings. The practice dates back thousands of years prior to the Common Era and across various societies. Physical and mental illnesses were indistinguishable from one another, as diseases and mental instability represented the presence of unappeased spirits according to pre-modern civilizations. Priests served the role of “physicians” and attempted to drive out evil spirits causing the diseases through incantations and healing rituals (Koenig, King and Carson 2012). Exorcisms began to decrease with the advent of modern medicine and better understanding of the origins of diseases/illnesses.\n\nExtrinsic Religion: Using religious participation and affiliation to achieve practical rewards, such as social status. This is in contrast to intrinsic religion, which pertains to internal motivations for religious activity. The concepts of extrinsic religion and intrinsic religion was developed by Gordon Allport (1960). Differences between intrinsic and extrinsic religion can be understood as differences in religious orientation (Allport 1960).\n\nF ▲\n\nFaith Healing: A term usually limited to the Christian practice of restoring health by means of prayer, divine power or the intervention of the Holy Spirit (Smith and Green 1995: 355).\n\nFamily, Religious: See religious family.\n\nFanatic: A derogatory term for someone overly zealous in their religious faith (Smith and Green 1995: 356).\n\nFasting: The religious practice of abstaining from food for a certain period of time. There are various forms of fasting in the three Abrahamic religions: Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Jewish passover includes a fast, Lent usually includes a chosen fast for Christians, and Ramadan in Islam includes a month-long daytime fast (Smith and Green 1995: 357).\n\nFatalism: The belief that all events are predetermined, and human effort is therefore irrelevant (Smith and Green 1995: 357).\n\nFatwa: The legal opinion of a private religious scholar concerning Islamic law. This opinion often guides certain legal rulings (Esposito 2011: 243).\n\nFeminist Theology: A system of religious thought that interprets practices and scriptures through a feminist perspective. It tends to challenge male-dominance in religious language, authority, and scripture. This perspective spans across Christian, Jewish, Muslim, and other religions (Lippy and Williams 2000).\n\nFinancial Contributions, Measures of: These survey items measure how much a respondent gives to his or her religious congregation or organization. Examples are found in the 2005 Baylor Religion Survey and the 2003 National Study of Youth and Religion, both of which are available in the ARDA’s Data Archive.\n\nFinney, Charles (1792-1875): Charles Finney was a prominent evangelist and revivalist during the Second Great Awakening. Licensed by the Presbyterian Church, Finney began conducting revivals in small New York towns and then spread to large urban centers, including Philadelphia, Boston, and Rochester. Like many revivalists, he was criticized for using emotionalism and abandoning traditional religious teachings.

Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield played pivotal roles in the development of the First Great Awakening. For more information on the First Great Awakening, click here.\n\nFive Pillars of Islam: The five essential practices of Islam. These include shahada (profession of faith), salat (worship), zakat (alms-giving), saum (fasting) and Hajj (pilgrimage). The observance of these pillars differs between Sunni and Shi'ite traditions (Hinnells 1984: 136).\n\nFour Noble Truths: The Core Teachings of Buddha in his first sermon in what is now known as northern India. These four truths include: the Existence of Suffering (which characterizes human life), the Origin of Suffering (which is ignorance), the Cessation of Suffering (through nirvana), and the Path to the Cessation of Suffering (through the Eightfold Path) (Prothero 2008: 187-188).\n\nFowler’s Stages of Faith: Similar to Piaget’s stages of cognitive development, theologian James Fowler (1991) suggested that personal religious faith also develops in stages. Fowler’s seven stages are: 1) primal faith (infancy); 2) intuitive/projective faith (early childhood); 3) mythical/literal faith (elementary school); 4) synthetic/conventional faith (early adolescence); 5) individuative/reflective faith (late adolescence/early adulthood); 6) conjuctive faith (midlife or beyond); and 7) universalizing faith (unspecified age). The first stage of primal faith is a stage where individuals, often at infancy, learn emotional trust based on contact and care that sets up the foundation for faith. The final stage of universalizing faith allows the individual to feel one with God. The complexity of Fowler’s conceptualizations makes it difficult to empirically test his theory.\n\nFree-Rider Problem: In general, a free-rider problem occurs when individuals take advantage of common resource or common goods without paying for or contributing to them. In a religious context, congregations face “free-riding” problems when members use collective religious resources without contributing to them. For example, attending holiday services, but not weekly services, may be seen as a form of “free-riding,” as one is relying on others to maintain the congregation for the remainder of the year. Free-riding is more common in low commitment religious organizations and may explain some of the decline that Mainline Protestant denominations have experienced (Stark and Finke 2000). In contrast, high commitment religious organizations demand such high costs that they may scare away potential “free riders” who would otherwise dilute their religious product (Iannaccone 1992). Because of this, religious identification tends to be stronger within high commitment groups compared to low commitment ones (Stark and Finke 2000).\n\nFrequency of Prayer, Measure of: This survey item measures how often a respondent prays. Examples are found in the 2008 General Social Survey, 2007 Religion and Public Life Survey, 2007-2008 National Study of Youth and Religion and the 2005 Baylor Religion Survey, all of which are available in the ARDA’s Data Archive.\n\nFrequency of Reading Sacred Texts: This survey item measures how often someone reads sacred texts such as the Bible, Koran, sutras etc. These items are present in the 2005 Baylor Religion Survey and the 1998 General Social Survey, both of which are available in the ARDA’s Data Archive.\n\nFreud, Sigmund (1856-1939): Considered the father of psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud is one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century. His ideas on the unconscious, dreams, child sexuality, and the libido are influential academic concepts, but Freud also had a unique conceptualization of religion. As evidenced by the title of his book Future of an Illusion (1989), Freud believed religion was a false belief system passed down by primitive ancestors. Similar to his notion of the Oedipus Complex, God represents a childlike longing for a father. Future of an Illusion has been accused of succumbing to the genetic fallacy, in which the truth or falsity of belief is tied to its origin (Whittaker 1978).\n\nFriar: A member of the mendicant orders of Roman Catholicism (Reid et al. 1990: 454).\n\nFriends at Church, Measures of: These survey questions ask respondents where they met their closest friends or if the majority of their close friends are found in their church. An example of this measure is found in the 2005 Baylor Religion Survey, available in the ARDA’s Data Archive.\n\nFriends Who Are Religious, Measure of: An estimate of how many people in a respondent’s social network are religious. Examples of this measure are found in the 2007-2008 National Study of Youth and Religion and the 2001 U.S. Congregational Life Survey, both of which are available in the ARDA’s Data Archive.\n\nFuller, Charles (1887-1968): Charles Fuller was a prominent evangelist on the popular evangelical radio show \"The Old Fashioned Revival Hour.\" By the mid-1940s, Fuller's sermons were being broadcast on 575 stations, making the \"The Old Fashioned Revival Hour\" one of the most widely heard shows. Fuller also founded Fuller Theological Seminary, which helped graduate influential religious figures, including Bill Bright, Rob Bell, John Piper, and Rick Warren. For more information on Charles Fuller, click here.\n\nFunctional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy -- Spiritual Well-Being (FACIT-SP) Scale: A popular scale composed of 12 statements to assess the relationship between spirituality and health outcomes (see Brady et al. 1999). It is one of the most common ways to measure spirituality in cancer research, as the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT), is a version of the FACIT used to measure quality of life among cancer patients. Some of the items include “I feel peaceful,” “I have a reason for living” and “I have a sense of purpose in my life.” Studies have found the scale to correlate with less of a desire for a hastened death, less hopelessness and less suicidal ideation (see McClain et al. 2003). Some argue that the FACIT-SP is a well-validated instrument for the assessment of a patient’s current spiritual state (Monod et al. 2011). However, other researchers argue that some of the items may not measure spirituality but measure the results of spirituality. With studies using dependent variables measuring meaning and hopefulness, this leads to unclear circular findings, as these studies correlate good mental health with itself (Koenig et al. 2012).\n\nFunctionalism: According to this perspective, religion exists because it serves an integrating function for society as a whole. Durkheim (1915) suggested this when he argued that God represents the society, and in worshiping God, society really reveres itself. The elements of the culture that are essential to the society’s survival are labeled sacred, in this theory. Unlike theories of the rise and fall of civilizations, functionalists do not consider the survival of a religious culture to be problematic. While flavors of this theory are common in older writings on religion, among the best texts to consult are Durkheim (1915) and Parsons (1964).\n\nFundamentalism: 1) A movement of Protestants embracing similar beliefs as evangelicals, although usually in a more conservative direction, stressing separation from the world and from more liberal Christian bodies. The term derives from a series of booklets entitled The Fundamentals, which were published in the early 20th century on what were viewed to be the basic doctrines of Christianity. 2) The term also is used to describe similarly conservative movements in other religions, particularly Islam (Smith and Green 1995: 369-370).\n\nG ▲\n\nGabriel: An archangel in Jewish, Christian and Islamic traditions. In Christianity, he is known for announcing to Mary that she will bear the Jesus, the savior of humanity. In Islam, he is known as \"Jibril,\" and is known for visiting the Prophet Muhammad in a human form. It was Jibril who revealed God's messages through Muhammad, and who also guided Muhammad during his night journey through the heavens (Smith and Green 1995: 373).\n\nGentile: Anyone not Jewish (Esposito et al. 2012b: G-4).\n\nGhost: The appearance of a dead person, usually thought of as a disembodied spirit. In Korea, ghosts operate as malevolent spirits who died prematurely and are therefore unfulfilled, like unmarried women, young children or drowning victims (Smith and Green 1995: 385).\n\nGibbons, James (1834-1921): James Gibbons was an important American cardinal archbishop who guided the Catholic Church through the influx of Irish immigrants in the 19th century. Moreover, he mediated relations between American Catholics and the Vatican. Pope Leo XIII was suspicious of American cultural influence on American cler"
