        "text": "During the holiday of Shmini Atzeret and Shabbat, 50 years after the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Hamas terrorists launched an unprecedented attack on Israel from Gaza, firing thousands of rockets, breaching the country’s borders, killing hundreds of Israelis, wounding thousands, and taking hostages.\n\nVideos show the terror of Israelis running for bomb shelters or being captured and taken hostage. Hamas intended to wreak havoc on Israeli civilians and cause the maximum amount of violence and terror. We cannot even fathom the chaos and fear running through the hearts and minds of Israelis as they fight for their lives and to protect their families.\n\nAn attack on Israel is an attack on all Jews.\n\nCongregation Sons of Israel of Briarcliff Manor unequivocally stands with the people and Land of Israel.\n\nThere are several ways we ask you to support Israel during this tragic time:\n\n1. Israel Emergency Fund: (Supported by UJA – Federation of North America) to support immediate infrastructure needs and give aid to families and individuals who have been impacted by acts of terror and violence.\n\n2. Magen David Adom: to put more ambulances on the road and to replenish supplies for paramedics.\n\n3. Soroka Medical Center: to fund more supplies and equipment for wounded soldiers that have come to Soroka Medical Center for life-saving treatment and need.\n\nGod of Strength, we ask that you protect and defend the State of Israel. Let hatred be banished from this sacred land and let peace prevail. Hear the cries of our Israeli family as they run to bomb shelters or search for their loved ones and help them to find safety. Shelter them in a Sukkah of peace and help them from feeling scared and alone. We will forever stand with the Land of Israel. May peace come speedily in our days."
