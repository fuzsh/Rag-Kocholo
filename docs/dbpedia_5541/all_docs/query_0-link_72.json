        "text": "The Division of Christian Unity was created in 1965 \"in order that there might be, within the National Council of Churches, a major program division whose primary focus is the unity of God's people.\" The Division's purpose was \"to enable Christians in today's world to discover and express their unity in Christ.\"\n\nThe goals of the Division were:\n\nTo help “all in each place” discover and manifest the gift of Christian Unity.\n\nTo strengthen the laity in their life and mission.\n\nTo strengthen ecumenical understanding and responsibility among the member churches of the National Council.\n\nTo continue the development of patterns of ecumenical relationships with nonmember churches.\n\nTo discover and develop a sound relationship with the Jewish people.\n\nTo discern and affirm those communities of hope which point to the fulfillment of the promise that God is gathering the whole of humanity in Christ.\n\nThe Division served as an umbrella which drew together organizations and departments which had previously existed outside the divisional structure of the NCC. The exception was the Department of Youth Ministry which had been part of the Division of Christian Education. These departments and organizations were the Department of Faith and Order, the Department for Councils of Churches, the Department of Youth Ministry, United Church Men, United Church Women (later called the Department of Women's Relations), and the British-American Preachers Exchange.\n\nIn June 1970 the General Board of NCC voted to abolish the Division of Christian Unity. The Department of Faith and Order became the Commission on Faith and Order. The Department for Councils of Churches became the Commission on Local and Regional Ecumenism. The Department of Women's Relations assumed its original name of United Church Women and became an independent related movement of NCC. United Church Men ceased to exist as did the Department of Youth Ministry and its affiliated organization, United Christian Youth Movement.\n\nSeries I: General Administration:\n\nThe duties of the associate general secretary of the Division of Christian Unity are defined in the following manner:\n\nHe directs the staff of the Division and is responsible for the planning, administration, and interpretation of its programs. He serves as staff executive to the Program Board for Christian Unity and its Executive Committee. He is responsible for acting as staff executive to all other standing committees of the Program Board or for delegating this task. These include the Committee on Local Ecumenical Development and the Committee on Laity and the Cooperation of Men and Women. He is responsible for the cultivation and coordination of relations with non-member churches, although direct administration of this area is delegated to the Associate Secretary of the Division.\n\nIn addition the associate general secretary \"advises the General Secretary primarily with respect to matters of Christian unity, inter-church relations, relationships to other councils and ecumenical bodies, but also serves as one of his senior advisors on general matters. He participates as a member both of the General Secretariat and the Program Cabinet. Because of the DCU's close tie to find operations he is called upon for a large amount of Council interpretation through speaking and writing.\"\n\nAssisting the associate general secretary was the associate secretary of the Division of Christian Unity, who also served as director of ecumenical affairs. The associate secretary has \"primary responsibility for developing and administering the program of Ecumenical Affairs. This involves establishing relationships with churches which are not members of the Council, and devising ways in which these relationships may be structured to the benefit of the Council, its member communions and other churches involved. He is responsible for continuous analysis of trends which are of ecumenical significance. Proposals for further ecumenical advance can be expected to result from his work.\" The associate secretary \"serves as the channel through which information about non-member churches --their structure, practices, policies, personnel -- may be made known to the member communions and units of the Council, and information about the Council and its members made available to non -member churches. He is also charged with developing methods --conferences, publications, etc.--through which member and non-member churches may come to know one another and keep informed about developments within the life of the various churches. He also carries responsibility for giving special attention to any member churches of the Council who wish help in participating more fully in the ecumenical movement. He acts as staff executive to the Committee on Ecumenical Affairs, and as assistant staff executive to the Program Board and its Executive Committee.\n\nCynthia C. Wedel served as associate general secretary of the Division of Christian Unity from 1965 to 1969. Robert C. Dodds was associate secretary and director of ecumenical affairs from 1965 to May 1970. David J. Bowman served as director for Ecumenical Services in 1970.\n\nWith the formation of the National Council of Churches in 1950 the Central Department of Field Administration was created. In May 1954 this department became the Office for Councils of Churches. When the NCC was reorganized in 1965 this office became the Department for Councils of Churches within the Division of Christian Unity.\n\nThe purpose of the Department for Councils of Churches was \"to develop communication and to strengthen relations between councils of churches and the National Council.\" In order to achieve this goal the Department worked \"to strengthen and enlarge the conciliar movement by encouraging and assisting in the formation of new councils of churches, and by providing counsel and services to existing councils, especially concerning structure and organization; finance; programming; and personnel policies, recruitment, placement, and training.\"\n\nThe Department coordinated ‘National Council mailings to other councils,” encouraged “state, metropolitan, and local council involvement and participation in NCC programs,” channeled “the needs of state, metropolitan, and local councils to appropriate NCC program units,” prepared “‘guidelines’ for appropriate council structures at various levels,” shared “program plans and directions,” and provided “continuing personnel services to these councils.” In addition the Department provided staff, editorial, and secretarial services to the Association for Council Secretaries.\n\nJ. Quinter Miller was executive director of the Central Department for Field Administration and the Office for Councils of Churches from 1951 to 1955. John B. Ketcham was associate executive secretary of the Central Department and the Office from 1951 to 1955. From 1956 to 1964 Ketcham was executive secretary of the Office for Councils of Churches. Ketcham was then executive director of the Department for Councils of Churches from 1965 to 1970. H. Conrad Hoyer was associate executive director of the Department from 1965 to 1970.\n\nIn 1970 the Department for Councils of Churches became the Commission on Local and Regional Ecumenism.\n\nThe Department of Faith and Order \"devotes attention to the theological bases of unity which God has given to mankind through His Church, and particularly to the problems of faith and of church order which underlie the present disunity of the Church.\" The Department conducted local and regional Faith and Order Conferences, established guidelines for faith and order in councils of churches, prepared resource materials, and sponsored the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity, (January 18-25), and World-Wide Communion Sunday, (the first Sunday in October). Beginning in 1966 the Department held annual National Faith and Order Colloquiums. From 1961 to 1964 the Department was known as the Department of Faith and Order Studies. In 1965 it became a part of the Division of Christian Unity where it remained until the demise of the Division in 1970. At this time the Department became the Commission on Faith and Order.\n\nWilliam A. Norgren was executive director of the Department from 1961 to 1971. Richard N. Johnson was associate executive director from 1966 to 1970.\n\nWhen the Division of Christian Unity was created in 1965, the Department of Youth Ministry, which had been part of the Division of Christian Education, was transferred to the new division. The defined purposes of the reorganized Department of Youth Ministry were:\n\nTo keep before the churches and all units of the NCC the special needs, interests, and problems of the younger generation.\n\nTo maintain a continuing study of the youth culture and make the findings known to those concerned in churches and councils.\n\nTo help young people find a way to participate in the life of the church, community, nation, and world.\n\nTo act as an “advocate” for youth in areas of tension and misunderstanding, such as student protests, the draft, etc.\n\nTo mobilize youth in the United States to share with youth around the world in combating poverty and injustice.\n\nTo work with Roman Catholic youth leaders on joint programs and action.\n\nThe Department gathered resources for its ministry \"through discussion of major issues and questions facing the younger generation and the churches; through consultation with professional youth workers and young people on the subject of youth culture.\" The Department produced periodicals such as FOLIO, Youth Notes, and Youth Week. It also published RISK, Alert, and Invest Your Summer. In addition, the Department prepared study papers and monographs \"to undergird the church's ministry with a substantial framework.\"\n\nJohn S. Wood was executive director of the Department from 1965 to February 1969. During 1970 Russel Claussen served as acting executive director. In 1970 the Department of Youth Ministry ceased to exist.\n\nAnother major activity of the Department was Ecumenical Voluntary Service (EVS), successor to the Commission on Ecumenical Voluntary Service Projects of the Department of Higher Education. EVS provided young people with the opportunity to participate in summer work projects in the United States and overseas.\n\nUnited Church Men was created in December 1950 by the new National Council of Churches. In October 1951 its program was officially inaugurated at a meeting in Cincinnati. The stated purpose of United Church Men was \"to unite the men of the churches in giving practical expression of their allegiance to their Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\"\n\nThe standing rules of United Church Men defined the organization's responsibilities as:\n\nSponsor consultations and engage in studies directed to the strengthening of work among laymen in the constituent Communions of the Council.\n\nAssist in the development and strengthening of programs of cooperative men’s work throughout the United States and in the presentation of this work of an effective united Christian witness.\n\nPromote cooperation and correlation between ecumenical church men’s groups through the United States and councils of churches, church women, and church youth.\n\nStudy ways in which concerned lay men can respond to the call of mission in daily life and participate more effectively in the many aspects of the work of their churches and the ecumenical movement.\n\nWork with other units within the Division and with the other divisions in the development of the laity, and the cooperation of men and women in church and society.\n\nRepresent the Council in its relationships with men’s work in other nations of the world.\n\nFrom its creation in 1950 until 1965 United Church Men existed as a general department of the NCC. In 1965 the organization was placed within the structure of the new Division of Christian Unity. In 1970 for all purposes United Church Men ceased to exist; however, it theoretically continued into 1971 when the Listening to Lay People project was completed.\n\nE. Urner Goodman was general director of United Church Men from 1950 to 1954. He was replaced by Edwin W. Parsons who served in the position from 1954 to 1958. S.J. Patterson was general director from 1958 to 1962. Donald Calame was general director from 1962 to 1966. From 1966 to 1970 there appears to have been no official director.\n\nThe exchange of British and American preachers (Series VI) began after World War I under the auspices of the Federal Council of Churches. In 1950 the program became a cooperative effort of the National Council of Churches and the British Council of Churches. From 1951 to 1958 the Exchange was administered by the Central Department of Ecumenical Relations. In January 1958 the program was assigned to the office of the assistant general secretary for field operations. In 1965 the exchange was placed under the direction of the Division of Christian Unity. The program appears to have ended in 1970. The Exchange operated through the Committee on the British-American Preachers Exchange, whose responsibilities included \"the appointment of ministers within the United States to share in the annual British-American Preachers Exchange program; to certify each appointee to the British Council of Churches; to review and evaluate the program; to arrange a reception and serve as hosts to the British participants at an appropriate time each summer; and to advise the staff of the Program Board of the Division [of Christian Unity] concerning the operation of the program.\"\n\nThe papers of the Division of Christian Unity, 1935-1973, detail the history, organization, and activities of the Division and its various departments and committees. Although the papers extend from the years 1935 to 1973, they date primarily from 1965 to 1970.\n\nThe papers are organized in six series according to the departments which existed within the organizational structure of the Division of Christian Unity. The papers of United Church Women are not found in this record group, as the group retained its files when it became an independent organization in 1970.\n\nIn each series the papers are arranged alphabetically by subject category. Items within the subject files are arranged chronologically by year, month, and day. Partially dated documents are placed at the end of the month or year; undated items are placed after all dated material. Enclosures are placed after their letter of transmittal. Newspaper clippings, unless enclosed with correspondence, are placed at the end of subject files.\n\nThe papers of the Division of Christian Unity, 1935-1973, are arranged in the following series:\n\nSeries I: General Administration: 1935-1971\n\nSeries II: Department for Councils of Churches, 1947-1971\n\nSeries III: Department of Faith and Order, 1954-1973\n\nSeries IV: Department of Youth Ministry, 1955-1971  Series V: United Church Men, 1951-1972\n\nSeries VI: British-American Preachers Exchange, 1952-1970\n\nThe General Administration, 1935-1971, Series I files date primarily from 1965 to 1969. The series represents the combined files of Cynthia C. Wedel and Robert C. Dodds with a small amount of material from David J. Bowman.\n\nThe files are arranged alphabetically by subject, name of individual, or name of organization. Items within the files are arranged chronologically by year, month, and day; undated material is placed after all dated material.\n\nThe files consist of incoming and outgoing correspondence, memoranda, reports, minutes, agenda, financial statements, press releases, questionnaires, newsletters, reprints, directories, programs, pamphlets, leaflets, and newspaper clippings.\n\nThe documents reflect the activities and concerns of the Division. There are materials concerning the Committee on the Laity and Cooperation of Men and Women; the Special Committee on Cooperation of Men and Women in Church, Family, and Society; the Task Force on the Role of Women; the Local Ecumenical Development Committee; and the Ecumenical Affairs Committee, as well as the various departments of the Division.\n\nA major subject of the files is the ecumenical movement. An example of this material is seen in the \"Bilateral Conversations.\" These files contain documents relating to Roman Catholic conversations with American Baptists, Episcopalians, Lutherans, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Jews. There are also materials from Presbyterian conversations with Christian Scientists, Latter Day Saints, and Jews.\n\nA large group of files within this series details \"Roman Catholic/NCC Relations.\" The files contain correspondence, reports, minutes, questionnaires, press releases, and printed matter. These documents relate to subjects such as the Bishops' Committee for Ecumenical and Interreligious Affairs, the Catholic Inter-American Cooperation Program, the Living Room Dialogues, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, the National Workshop on Christian Unity, Vatican Council II, and various cooperative endeavors and discussions of the NCC and the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nThe Department for Councils of Churches, 1947-1971, files date primarily from 1965 to 1970. The files are chiefly those of John B. Ketcham. There is additional material from the files of J. Quinter Miller and H. Conrad Hoyer. The files also include the papers of Don F. Pielstick, who was director of Church Planning and Adjustment from 1952 to 1954. The files pertaining to the Southern Office consist primarily of the papers of its executive director from 1953 to 1965, J. Edward Lantz. There are also the papers of Ernest J. Arnold who was executive director of the Southern Office from February 1951 to April 1953.\n\nThe files are arranged alphabetically by subject, name of individual, name of organization, and geographic location. A general file for each letter of the alphabet precedes subject files for the same letter of the alphabet (i.e., \"A\" precedes \"American Association of Retired Persons\"). Items within the files are arranged chronologically by year, month, and day; undated material is placed after all dated material.\n\nThe files consist of incoming and outgoing correspondence, memoranda, reports, minutes, agenda, constitutions, bylaws, budgets, financial statements, press releases, questionnaires, directories, programs, newsletters, pamphlets, leaflets, and newspaper clippings.\n\nThe files concern various subjects such as the draft, financial counseling, ecumenical cooperation, and Roman Catholic relations with councils of churches. The files also concern the Department's relations with various organizations including LAOS, Inc.; the American Christian Palestine Committee; the Boy Scouts of America; and the Council and Publishers Club as well as several denominations.\n\nThe bulk of the files in this series contain materials relating to councils of churches. These files are arranged by state and then by city or county. They contain correspondence, reports, minutes, constitutions, bylaws, newsletters, and printed matter.\n\nThere are a number of files from the Southern Office dating from 1951 to 1965. The Southern Office was originally a part of general administration under the direction of J. Quinter Miller. In January 1965 it became a unit of the Department for Councils of Churches, but by the end of the year it had been discontinued. The Southern Office assisted state and local councils in the region and interpreted the policies and activities of the NCC to the regional churches and councils of churches. The files of the Southern Office contain correspondence, memoranda, reports, minutes, agenda, press releases, newsletters, constitutions, programs, pamphlets, leaflets, and newspaper clippings.\n\nBecause of the close relationship of the staff of the Department with the Association of Council Secretaries, the researcher is referred to the files of the Association.\n\nThe Department of Faith and Order, 1954-1973, series III files date primarily from 1960 to 1970. The files are chiefly those of William A. Norgren. There is a small amount of material of Richard N.

Leiper, director of Ecumenical Voluntary Service (1966-1967); and Adrian J. DuMont, program assistant of Ecumenical Voluntary Service.\n\nThe files are arranged alphabetically by subject, name of individual, or name of organization.

The project, which began in October 1968 and concluded in 1971, conducted discussion groups around the United States to learn what lay people viewed as the purposes and responsibilities of the churches. The project, directed by Cameron P. Hall, for budgetary reasons was placed under United Church Men which also provided it with staff and office space. The files concerning the project contain correspondence, memoranda, minutes, agenda, and staff and community reports.\n\nThere are also a number of files concerning state and local organizations of United Church Men. The files, arranged alphabetically by state, contain correspondence, reports, and newsletters.\n\nThe files of the British-American Preachers Exchange, 1952-1970, are the combined files of Robert C. Dodds, associate general secretary of the Division of Christian Unity, and J. Quinter Miller, assistant general secretary for field operations. There is also a small amount of material of Robbins W.
