        "text": "Karma is the belief in Hinduism and Buddhism that people’s actions in this life determine what happens in their next life. There are a couple of problems with that belief. Reincarnation is not a biblical teaching. In addition, karma is all about people’s actions and a deity’s response to them; it is thoroughly work righteousness. People are taught that they can improve their situation in the next life by being good in this life.\n\nGalatians 6:7-8 does state: “Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.” That information is from the only true God, the Triune God. Those words explain that if people live according to their sinful nature, they can expect “destruction.” That is because such a life displays unbelief and impenitence, and the Bible clearly explains the end-of-life judgment that awaits the impenitent and unbelieving (1 Corinthians 6:9-10; Mark 16:16). On the other hand, faith in Jesus Christ saves (Mark 16:16), and in grateful response for their salvation Christians will live life “to please the Spirit.” There is nothing in Galatians 6:7-8 or elsewhere in the Bible that teaches work righteousness.\n\nYou may want to be careful in using “karma” so you are not confused with people who believe in reincarnation and work righteousness.\n\nYou may want to be careful in using that word for another reason. In conversations today, people might use “karma” to describe bad things catching up with people or people “getting what they deserved.” Jesus warned against making connections between disastrous events in people’s lives and their relationship with God (Luke 13:1-5). Rather than trying to make such connections, Jesus instructed us to take a look at our own lives: “Unless you repent, you too will all perish” (Luke 13:3, 5). Seeing calamities and tragedies in the lives of others is to move you and me to repentance. Our sins call for God’s swift judgment, but we implore his mercy, and we praise him that “he does not treat us as our sins deserve” (Psalm 103:10).\n\nWhen it comes to karma, I personally want to distance myself from its meaning and usage in every way.\n\nI found this on the LCMS website: “While it is true that there are certain common features among the three Abrahamic religions [Judaism, Christianity and Islam]—the importance of Abraham, sacred scriptures, the worship of one God, and moral teachings—these very commonalities represent significant differences among the three faiths. In addition, of the three religions, only the Christian faith points to the unique revelation of God in the person and saving work of Jesus Christ… Islam makes exclusive claims for Allah, and also rejects the Triune God…The three religions differ significantly in their teachings about Jesus Christ. In Judaism, Jesus is not accepted as the Son of God or as the Messiah foretold by the prophets. The Qur’an of Islam also denies the deity of Christ, stating that only Allah may be worshiped as Lord.”\n\nIt is clear that your church is not teaching that Muslims believe in the same deity as Christians.\n\nThe God of Islam, Allah, does not exist. Muslims need to hear the gospel of Jesus Christ. “Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given to mankind by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12). Jesus alone is Savior.\n\nThe Lausanne Covenant was ratified at the International Congress on World Evangelization, held in Lausanne, Switzerland, in July 1974. 2,300 people, representing 150 nations, attended the Congress and were involved in the ratification of the Covenant. Since that time, the Covenant has become a confession of faith for many evangelical ministries and associations.\n\nFollowing are comments on the Lausanne Covenant that appeared in the Wisconsin Lutheran Quarterly in 1974: “The Lausanne Covenant, as it is called, commits its signatories both to the infallible authority of the Bible and to Christian social responsibility…..There is much in the 14 articles with which we find ourselves in wholehearted agreement…..It warms the heart to read so forthright a statement on the authority of the Bible in an age in which that authority is so often the victim of the proponents of negative higher and historical criticism…..Article 5 on ‘Christian Social Responsibility’ offers a fine positive statement of the individual Christian’s responsibility as a member of society. From our viewpoint the statement is weak because it does not supplement its positive emphasis with a negative statement to the affect that the Lord has not made social action a part of the church’s task as such…..The covenant is also deserving of a bouquet for its unequivocal rejection ‘as degrading to Christ of every kind of syncretism and dialogue which implies that Christ speaks equally through all religions and ideologies’…..As for the Congress itself, it was a thoroughly unionistic enterprise.”\n\nOur church body’s criticism of the covenant is based not so much on what the Covenant said but on what it did not say. Because evangelicals wrote the Covenant, statements on the sacraments and church fellowship are absent.\n\nI am wondering if you are seeking information on the AFLC (the Association of Free Lutheran Congregations). With that in mind, by looking at their website, a couple of differences between the AFLC and WELS stand out.\n\nIn the area of church polity they state, “According to the Word of God, the congregation is the right form of the Kingdom of God on earth….According to the New Testament, the congregation needs an external organization with membership roll, election of officers, stated times and places for its gatherings, and other similar provisions.” While we teach the importance of local congregations, we do not make it “the right form of the Kingdom of God on earth,” nor do we mandate its organizational structure.\n\nWhen it comes to the application of biblical fellowship principles, the AFLC maintains: “We recommend that our congregations cooperate wherever possible with like-minded Lutheran congregations and movements in programs of evangelism and witness….We envision opportunities for our congregations to cooperate with the Protestant churches in the areas of evangelism and witness to their communities. However, care must be taken not to compromise the Lutheran understanding of the Scriptures.” Cooperating with Protestant churches in evangelism blurs biblical fellowship principles.\n\nThe AFLC is not a synod. It is a fellowship of independent congregations.\n\nAgain, I trust this is information you were seeking. To gain a better understanding of Lutheranism in our country, you or your friends might be interested in WELS & Other Lutherans. It is available from Northwestern Publishing House.\n\nIt is helpful to look at the context in which “snake handler” occurs. We find this in the closing verses of Mark’s gospel: “He said to them, ‘Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will accompany those who believe: In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues; they will pick up snakes with their hands; and when they drink deadly poison, it will not hurt them at all; they will place their hands on sick people, and they will get well.’ After the Lord Jesus had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and he sat at the right hand of God. Then the disciples went out and preached everywhere, and the Lord worked with them and confirmed his word by the signs that accompanied it” (Mark 16:15-20).\n\nBefore his ascension into heaven, Jesus commissioned his followers to spread his powerful gospel to the ends of the world. He promised them that there would be powerful, accompanying signs to their preaching. The last verse of that section relates the fulfillment of that promise. The early church’s powerful message about Jesus Christ carried with it the power and authority of God.\n\nWhile God can certainly do anything, we do not look for or expect God to provide those same miraculous signs today (and handling snakes is just one of those signs). Those signs accomplished their purpose in that they demonstrated that the message of the apostles was not of human origin. The Holy Spirit’s work through the powerful gospel—attested by these powerful signs—brought about rapid growth in the church. There is no longer a need for these signs today. Those who expect them or demand them by drinking deadly poison or handling dangerous snakes in the name of the Lord can very well tempt God (Matthew 4:7).\n\nWe do best to keep the emphasis on what is most important—and certain—in that section of Scripture: proclaiming the powerful gospel of Jesus Christ.\n\nI am not entirely sure what you would like to know about that organization. What follows are some brief observations on the organization’s stated theology.\n\nThe organization you referenced does speak of the Trinity, but they promote significant errors in their Statement of Faith. They speak of multiple judgments before God and a literal 1,000-year reign of Christ on earth. I found no mention of the sacraments in their Statement of Faith. Their misunderstanding of Old Testament civil and ceremonial laws is evident in this statement: “All Scripture (Word) is still true and nothing has been abolished.” The ceremonial laws have been abolished. The tearing of the temple curtain on Good Friday illustrated that (Matthew 27:51). As we are not citizens of Old Testament Israel, the civil laws given through Moses do not apply to us.\n\nThe chief purpose of God’s law is to point out our sinfulness and show our need for a Savior. The organization you referenced places a different emphasis on the law and people’s obedience of it. They state: “Our obedience is the evidence and substance of our faith.”\n\nThe substance of our faith is Jesus Christ (Acts 4:12; 1 Corinthians 1:23).\n\nYour boyfriend is accurately representing his church. The Evangelical Free Church of America (EFCA) teaches: “The Lord Jesus mandated two ordinances, baptism and the Lord’s Supper, which visibly and tangibly express the gospel. Though they are not the means of salvation, when celebrated by the church in genuine faith, these ordinances confirm and nourish the believer.” What his church is not doing is accurately representing the Lord. The Bible teaches that God offers and gives forgiveness of sins, life and salvation through Baptism and the Lord’s Supper (Acts 2:38; Acts 22:16; Matthew 26:28).\n\nThe EFCA also teaches “the personal, bodily and premillennial return of our Lord Jesus Christ.” Jesus explained to Pontius Pilate that his kingdom is not of this world (John 18:36).\n\nFrom its Statement of Faith one can also observe that the EFCA embraces ecumenism, and confuses the invisible church and visible churches.\n\n“Doctrinal errors—any errors—are serious and potentially destructive of saving faith (Galatians 5:9)” is how one response to a question similar to yours ended. What that sentence means is that it is always dangerous to deny what the Bible teaches. Jesus said, “Your word is truth” (John 17:17). He did not qualify the truthfulness of God’s word by saying that some of it or most of it is true; he said all of it is true. In addition, God warns people not to change his word (Deuteronomy 4:2; Revelation 22:18-19).\n\nWhen the Bible states that “A little yeast works through the whole batch of dough” (Galatians 5:9), it means that one false doctrine can lead to others. Left unchecked, false doctrine in one area of the Bible can ultimately lead to false doctrine regarding Jesus Christ and salvation. That is why any false doctrine is important.\n\nWhat could be a good Bible study for you and your boyfriend is going through your respective churches’ statements of faith. His is online. Yours is as well. This link will take you to This We Believe, a statement of belief of WELS. You will find many Bible passages in This We Believe that provide biblical support for what we believe. I encourage you both to look up those passages and discuss them. See what God says for himself in his word. God bless your study of his word!\n\nAn answer to a previous, similar question pointed out these differences:\n\n1) The Assemblies of God churches teach that faith is a condition of salvation rather than teaching that faith is the way God has chosen for us to receive salvation. The implication is that an unconverted, sinful human being must “decide” for Christ. WELS teaches that people by nature are dead in their transgressions and sin and therefore have no ability to decide for Christ (Ephesians 2:1, 5). We do not choose Christ, rather he chose us (John 15:16).\n\n2) The Assemblies of God churches teach that Baptism and Holy Communion are ordinances whereby Christians declare to the world that they have died with Christ and share in the divine nature. They do not believe that the sacraments are means of grace through which the Holy Spirit works to create or strengthen faith. They deny the Real Presence in the Lord’s Supper. They insist that the only legitimate way to perform baptism is by immersion. WELS teaches that baptism and the Lord’s Supper are means of grace through which the Holy Spirit works to create or strengthen faith (Titus 3:4-7, John 3:5-6, 1 Peter 3:21, Matthew 26:26-28). We believe that Christ’s true body and blood are truly present in the Lord’s Supper (Matthew 26:26-28, 1 Corinthians 11:23-29). The Bible does not mandate the mode of applying the water of baptism.\n\n3) The Assemblies of God churches teach premillennialism. They believe that Christ will return and reign physically, visibly, and politically for 1,000 years on earth. WELS rejects the teaching that Jesus will return to establish a political reign here on earth (John 19:36, Romans 14:17, Colossians 1:13-14).\n\n4) The Assemblies of God churches are a perfectionist church body. According to the official website of the Assemblies of God, they believe that “by the power of the Holy Ghost we are able to obey the command: ‘Be ye holy, for I am holy.’” Holiness/perfectionist church bodies often seem to make rules where God hasn’t and to call things sinful which God has not forbidden. WELS teaches that, although we will strive for Christian perfection, we will not attain it in this life (Romans 7:14-25, Philippians 3:12). We are careful not to call things sinful which God has not called sinful (1 Corinthians 10:23-33, Romans 14:1-23).\n\n5) The Assemblies of God churches believe that every believer is entitled to “baptism in the Holy Spirit” (an experience separate from water baptism) with the initial evidence of speaking in tongues. They also practice faith healing. They teach that such “divine healing is an integral part of the gospel. Deliverance from sickness is provided for in the atonement, and is the privilege of all believers.” WELS does not teach a “baptism in the Holy Spirit” separate from and subsequent to water baptism. We do not see speaking in tongues and faith healing as normative for Christians today.\n\nFor more detail to your question, you might benefit from A Lutheran Looks at the Assemblies of God. It is available from Northwestern Publishing House.\n\nThe best help I can offer is correcting some of the information in the text of your question.\n\nJesus did not establish the Roman Catholic Church. Jesus’ words in Matthew 16:18 make it very clear that he was building his church on the confession of faith that he is “the Messiah, the Son of the living God,” and not on a person like the apostle Peter.\n\nJesus’ words in Matthew 16:18 do make it very clear that Satan and his forces will not be able to overthrow Christ and his Church. Revelation 20:7-10 describes Satan’s final and eternal defeat.\n\nWas the origin of the Lutheran Church connected to Martin Luther? Certainly. But it was not Luther’s intent to start a new church named after him. When the Roman Catholic Church excommunicated Luther, the reformer had no other church with which to affiliate. The establishment of another church was inevitable.\n\nKeep in mind that, as Lutheran Christians, we do not regard Martin Luther or his writings as foundational to our faith. Scripture alone is the source of our faith and doctrine. The recent 500th anniversary celebration of the Lutheran Reformation highlighted that truth again and again.\n\nLuther’s Protest could be a good read for you. It explains the Reformation very well and keeps Luther in proper perspective. The book is available in print and digital versions.\n\nMost of all, hold on—in faith—to the Bible’s teaching that salvation is God’s free gift to people through Spirit-worked faith (Romans 3:28; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5-6).\n\nA good read for you would be A Lutheran Looks at Catholics. It is available from Northwestern Publishing House. Your church or school library may also have a copy for you to borrow. That book will offer a good comparison of Roman Catholic Church doctrine and practice and confessional Lutheran Church doctrine and practice.\n\nA valuable conversation for you to have with your boyfriend is that which concerns his personal faith. What his church teaches is one thing; what he believes is another matter. The most important subject you can address with him is the way of salvation.\n\nThe official teaching of his church is that people ultimately enjoy salvation through faith in Jesus and human efforts. The Bible makes it very clear that people enjoy salvation through faith in Jesus Christ alone, without any effort or works of their own. “For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law” (Romans 3:28). “We who are Jews by birth and not sinful Gentiles know that a person is not justified by the works of the law, but by faith in Jesus Christ. So we, too, have put our faith in Christ Jesus that we may be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because by the works of the law no one will be justified” (Galatians 2:15-16).\n\nGod bless your conversations as you study the truths of his word.\n\nPrevious responses to questions like yours included the following:\n\n“Reiki attempts to connect its practitioners more strongly to God, in order to ‘turn on’ their innate powers to heal through touch. Christian practitioners of Reiki are encouraged to precede their ‘attunement’ sessions with prayers to the Father, Son, or Holy Spirit. Or, they might find angels such as Michael or Gabriel willing to help if asked.\n\n“Many forms of ‘Christian meditation’ are simply adaptations of Oriental meditation techniques using some Christian words or terms instead of Buddhist or Oriental terms. These may be harmless if they are simply techniques for relaxation, but they are not inherently Christian. To use these as a relaxation technique, a person could recite either Hare Krishna or Hallelujah and it would not make any difference. Simply reciting the name of Jesus repeatedly would not necessarily make this technique Christian meditation. Non-Christians could and do use Jesus’ name as a mantra.\n\n“The Bible warns us against vain repetition, which lacks thoughtful reflection on the meaning. Oriental forms of meditation cannot be easily adopted to Christian use because they flow from a very different view of God and of how we reach him. Many Oriental meditation techniques view God as a force we harness or utilize. We view God as a person who communicated with us in revealed words.\n\n“Real Christian meditation is thinking about the words of Scripture. We understand that we do not raise ourselves up to communicate with God by following a certain technique of meditation. God comes down to us in his Word and we meditate on what it means. Christian meditation focuses on listening to what God says in his Word not just repeating a word to relax. We have the best form of meditation–meditating on God’s Word. Christians can use natural relaxation methods based on physical principles. They should not become involved in techniques that are based on a false view of God or false spirituality.\n\n“Phenomena like Reiki are typical of the New Age movement. Reiki promises supernatural power to its devotees, and it isn’t particular about where the power comes from.”\n\nThe history of the American Association of Lutheran Churches (AALC) began when twelve congregations of the American Lutheran Church (ALC) did not participate in the formation of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA). Those congregations formed the American Association of Lutheran Churches in 1988. In 2007, the AALC entered into altar and pulpit fellowship with the Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod (LCMS).\n\nWELS and the former ALC did not agree in areas like biblical interpretation, church fellowship, and church and ministry—just to name a few. Those same items are barriers to fellowship between WELS and the AALC. In addition, since the AALC is in fellowship with LCMS (and WELS is not), WELS cannot be in fellowship with the AALC.\n\nBecause the celebration of the Lord’s Supper is an expression of oneness in faith (1 Corinthians 10:17), our pastors seek to present a genuine picture of unity in faith through the biblical practice of closed communion. That practice also has the purpose of ensuring, as far as humanly possible, that those receiving the sacrament will do so to their benefit and not their harm (1 Corinthians 11:27-32).\n\nI encourage you to speak to the pastor of the WELS church you are attending. He can explain the means through which church membership can be established, making available the reception of the Lord’s Supper. God bless you.\n\nThat is a conclusion one might make, but that is a conclusion Seventh-day Adventists reject. They state: “Satan makes no atonement for our sins. But Satan will ultimately have to bear the retributive punishment for his responsibility in the sins of all men, both righteous and wicked. Seventh-day Adventists, therefore, repudiate in toto [their emphasis] any idea, suggestion, or implication that Satan is in any sense or degree our sin bearer. That thought is abhorrent to us, and appallingly sacrilegious. Such a concept is a dreadful disparagement of the efficacy of Christ and His salvation, and vitiates the whole glorious provision of salvation solely through our Savior.” (Questions on Doctrine, page 400).\n\nWithout question, Seventh-day Adventist teaching fails to see the scapegoat on the great Day of Atonement (Leviticus 16) typifying the substitutionary work of Jesus Christ.\n\nThe larger problem is that Seventh-day Adventism fails to distinguish clearly between law and gospel. Ellen White, one of that church’s early leaders that you cited, wrote: “In the Law is embodied the same principle as in the Gospel.” The message of the law and the message of the gospel are in fact opposites. The law reveals our sin and our need for a Savior; the gospel shows us our Savior, Jesus. Jesus’ loud cry on the cross, “It is finished” (John 19:30), reveals that the Lord successfully completed his soul-saving mission. His triumphant resurrection from the dead guarantees it (Romans 4:25).\n\nYes, continue to pray for your son; I will do the same. Also, continue to be a Christian influence in his life. Godly examples reinforce Christian witnessing, and your son needs both. See what you and others in your family and circle of friends might do to keep the gospel of Christ in your son’s life. It could be simple things like emails or text messages that contain Bible passages. We never know what God might do with those things.\n\nAs far as approaching your son about this change in his life, you can determine what to say to him by asking him questions. You might think of pursuing questions like these: When did he start having second thoughts about Jesus and the Christian faith? Were there any circumstances or events in his life that led to questioning his faith? Were there influential people in his life who played a role in his embracing Judaism? What finally led him to reject Jesus and the Christian faith?\n\nI wonder also if one of our pastors is in a position to speak to your son. If that is an option, please consider that route.\n\nWe know that God changes hearts through his powerful gospel (Romans 1:16). At some point, it would be good for your son to read through the book of Hebrews. That book clearly and repeatedly shows how Jesus Christ is far superior to anything associated with Judaism. You and I won’t be able to convince your son of that truth, but the Holy Spirit can.\n\nFinally, use your pastor as a resource person. Explain to him what you learn about your son’s change of heart and see how he might be able to assist you in future conversations with your son.\n\nIt certainly sounds like you did what you could as a Christian parent: raising your son in a Christian environment and enabling him to receive a Christian education for many years. Your son is responsible for the life he is now leading. Like the father in the parable of the lost son (Luke 15:11-32), you stand ready and willing to receive your son back into the fold of God’s family. God shares that same attitude. God bless all that you and others do for your son, that he may again confess Jesus as Savior and enjoy every blessing won by his holy life and sacrificial death.\n\nI will address your questions in the order in which you asked them.\n\nJesus gave the Lord’s Supper to his church so that they could receive it (“Take and eat…Drink from it, all of you…” – Matthew 26:26-27) and not adore it. There was no adoration connected with the institution of the Lord’s Supper, and there was no practice of adoration in the early church.\n\nLutheran worshipers are free to make the sign of the cross at the Trinitarian Invocation (“In the name of the Father…”). You might be interested to know that one of the general rubrics for The Lutheran Hymnal, the hymnal that most WELS congregations used for decades, stated: “The sign of the cross may be made at the Trinitarian Invocation and at the words of the Nicene Creed ‘and the life of the world to come.’”\n\nIn his Small Catechism (in the Concordia Triglotta), Martin Luther included this preface to the Morning Prayer: “In the morning, when you rise, you shall bless yourself with the holy cross and say: In the name of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen. Then, kneeling or standing, repeat the Creed and the Lord’s Prayer. If you choose, you may, in addition, say this little prayer” [which we know as Luther’s Morning Prayer].\n\nSimilar wording precedes his Evening Prayer: “In the evening, when you go to bed, you shall bless yourself with the holy cross and say: In the name of God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen. Then, kneeling or standing, repeat the Creed and the Lord’s Prayer. If you choose, you may, in addition, say this little prayer” [which we know as Luther’s Evening Prayer].\n\nMaking the sign of the cross is something that God has neither commanded nor forbidden. The same is true regarding kneeling. Again, you might be interested to know that The Lutheran Hymnal indicated that “All may kneel” for the confession of sins. I am aware of WELS congregations where some worshipers still kneel for the reception of the Lord’s Supper and for personal, post-Communion prayers. At the congregation where I belong, there are individuals who make the sign of the cross when they receive the Lord’s Supper while kneeling. I can see this when I help with the distribution of the Lord’s Supper.\n\nWe do not pray to the saints because the First Commandment forbids us to worship and pray to anyone except God. To pray to any person as we pray to God is idolatry.\n\nLutherans view Mary as the woman God graciously chose to give birth to Jesus Christ. Mary received that honor and privilege only because of God’s grace to her (Luke 1:26-38). Mary recognized her sinfulness and her need for a Savior (Luke 1:47). Lutherans recognize that there is only one Savior and mediator between God and people: Jesus Christ (1 Timothy 2:5-6).\n\nBeyond providing answers to your questions, I trust that you recognize that the biggest difference between the official teachings of the Lutheran Church and the Roman Catholic Church concerns salvation. The Roman Catholic Church’s Council of Trent still condemns anyone who teaches the biblical truth that faith in Jesus alone saves. Lutherans confess and teach what the Bible teaches—that faith in Jesus Christ alone, apart from works, saves (Romans 3:20, 28; Galatians 2:15-26; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:4-7). I pray that is your faith as well.\n\nI can point you to the answer of a very similar question. The answer follows.\n\n“Just as all churches that bear the name ‘Lutheran’ do not teach the same as other ‘Lutherans,’ so not all churches that bear the name ‘Presbyterian’ teach exactly the same. We can, however, speak of what Presbyterians believed historically and compare it with what confessional Lutherans believe.\n\n“Historically, as strict Calvinists, Presbyterians taught that from eternity God elected some to be saved and some to be damned (double predestination). By no means do all Presbyterians believe this today. Confessional Lutherans believe that from eternity God chose those whom he would convert through the gospel and preserve in faith to eternal life. See Ephesians 1:4-6; Romans 8:29,30). Confessional Lutherans reject the notion that unbelievers were predestined to damnation, for ‘God does not will that any should perish’ (see 1 Timothy 2:4 and 2 Peter 3:9).\n\n“Historically, and as a corollary of the Calvinist belief in double predestination, Presbyterians taught that Christ atoned for the sins only of those predestined for life in heaven. Confessional Lutherans believe that Jesus Christ, the God-man, was sent by the Father to atone for the sins of all people, and that he did so. See Romans 5:18,19; Isaiah 53:6; 2 Corinthians 5:19; and John 1:29.\n\n“Historically, Presbyterians believed that it is impossible for a believer to fall from the faith. Confessional Lutherans believe that it is possible for believers to fall from faith. See 1 Corinthians 10:12.\n\n“Historically, Presbyterians have believed that Sunday has replaced Saturday as the Sabbath, to be observed in a way similar to the Old Testament regulations. Confessional Lutherans believe that New Testament believers are free to gather for worship on Sunday (or any other day), without special rules regarding work or recreation. See Colossians 2:16,17: ‘Do not let anyone judge you . . . with regard to a Sabbath day. These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ.’\n\n“The name ‘Presbyterian’ means ‘having elders (teaching and ruling or presiding),’ as the only form of church government that has God’s approval. Confessional Lutherans believe that the Lord has instituted and provides for the gospel ministry, but that there are no commands in the New Testament as to forms of organization.\n\n“Like other Protestant (non-Lutheran) churches, Presbyterians do not believe that Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are means of grace—forms of the gospel through which the Holy Spirit gives and strengthens faith. Confessional Lutherans believe that Baptism gives new life (Titus 3:5) and cleanses from all sin (Acts 2:38). Confessional Lutherans believe that as believers receive Christ’s body and blood under the bread and wine they also receive the forgiveness of sins (Matthew 26:28; 1 Corinthians 10:16). Presbyterians do not believe communicants receive the Lord’s Body and Blood in his Supper.”\n\nIndividual Presbyterians today may have different personal beliefs than what was stated in the previous paragraphs. The key is recognizing that the beliefs stated in the answer are “what Presbyterians believed historically.” You will also want to keep in mind that there is more than one Presbyterian church body in our country.\n\nI can refer you to a column that appeared in the October 2013 Forward in Christ:\n\n“Perhaps uninformed people really think that Lutherans idolize or inappropriately revere Luther. We can assure them we don’t. Rather, we cherish and thankfully embrace key concepts that God restored to their rightful place in the church through Martin Luther. By grace alone, through faith alone, by Scripture alone, and through Christ alone are truths the Reformer championed. Highlight these truths for your friend. This is what true Lutheranism is all about.\n\n“Lutherans have never believed or taught everything Luther said or wrote was correct. Luther said and wrote some things that would have better remained unspoken and unwritten. This should not be surprising when one considers how much he wrote. Let’s be quick to cherish divine truths given renewed prominence through Luther and equally swift to acknowledge the man’s imperfections.\n\n“Accusations of anti-Semitism against Luther usually stem from reading his 1543 tract On the Jews and Their Lies, in which the Reformer used immoderate language and gave questionable counsel on how to deal with Jews at that time. While we have never endorsed what and how he wrote in that treatise, we also believe a fair, historically-sensitive appraisal of the man and his message will show the Reformer was not anti-Semitic. Excellent books have been written on this topic, but here we must limit ourselves to these brief points:\n\n“ Luther also wrote about Jews in sympathetic ways and rebuked European Christians for their treatment of Jews. Here’s one example: ‘The fury of some Christians (if they are to be called Christians) is damnable. They imagine that they are doing God a service when they persecute the Jew most hatefully, think everything evil of them, and insult them. . . . Whereas, according to the example of this psalm (14:7) and that of Paul (Romans 9:1), a man ought to be most heartily sorry for them and continually pray for them. . . . They ought to attract them by all manner of gentleness, patience, pleading and care’ (What Luther Says: An Anthology, Vol. 2, 683).\n\n“ Luther’s attitude is more accurately characterized as anti-Judaism rather than anti-Semitism. His opposition was not racial or ethnic, but theological. He was targeting people who persistently and vigorously rejected the truth of salvation through faith alone in Jesus the Messiah and Savior of the world. Luther wrote harshly against the Roman pope and his theological supporters for the same reason.\n\n“ Like everyone else, Luther was a child of his times. It’s difficult for people today to put themselves into his historical context, yet it’s unfair to judge him according to our standards of civility. Luther’s language sounds cruel, but his opponents often used similar language, and literary style of the era included harsh ridicule, name calling, and deliberate excess.\n\n“Ultimately we must conclude that the treatise in question doesn’t represent Luther at his best. We cannot endorse or excuse what he wrote. From a historical viewpoint, it should not surprise us that he sometimes shared unacceptable attitudes of his day. What is amazing is how often he rose above his times and advocated magnificent and eternal truth, most of all the full and free gospel of forgiveness.”\n\nIn This We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body, we confess this:\n\n“1. We believe that there is one holy Christian church, which is the temple of God (1 Corinthians 3:16) and the body of Christ (Ephesians 1:23; 4:12). The members of this one church are all those who are the ‘sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus’ (Galatians 3:26). The church, then, consists only of believers, or saints, whom God accepts as holy for the sake of Jesus’ righteousness, which has been credited to them (2 Corinthians 5:21). These saints are scattered throughout the world. All people who believe that Jesus is their Savior from sin are members of the holy Christian church, regardless of the nation, race, or church body to which they belong.\n\n“2. We believe that this holy Christian church is a reality, although it is not an external, visible organization. Because ‘man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart’ (1 Samuel 16:7), only the Lord knows ‘those who are his’ (2 Timothy 2:19). The members of the holy Christian church are known only to God; we cannot distinguish between true believers and hypocrites. The holy Christian church is therefore invisible and cannot be identified with any one church body or with the total membership of all church bodies.\n\n“3. We believe that the presence of the holy Christian church nevertheless can be recognized. Wherever the gospel is preached and the sacraments are administered, the holy Christian church is present, for through the means of grace true faith is produced and preserved (Isaiah 55:10,11). The means of grace, therefore, are called the marks of the church.”\n\nThose statements make clear that salvation is not limited to a particular visible church body.\n\nSince the Bible teaches that faith in Jesus Christ alone, apart from works, saves (Romans 3:20, 28; Galatians 2:15-26; Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:4-7), Roman Catholic Church members will need to ignore official teachings of their church and trust only in Christ for salvation. Their church, after all, condemns anyone who teaches the biblical truth that faith in Jesus alone saves. The following quotations from the Council of Trent (Sixth Session) illustrate that.\n\n“CANON IX.-If any one saith, that by faith alone the impious is justified; in such wise as to mean, that nothing else is required to co-operate in order to the obtaining the grace of Justification, and that it is not in any way necessary, that he be prepared and disposed by the movement of his own will; let him be anathema.\n\n“CANON XI.-If any one saith, that men are justified, either by the sole imputation of the justice of Christ, or by the sole remission of sins, to the exclusion of the grace and the charity which is poured forth in their hearts by the Holy Ghost, and is inherent in them; or even that the grace, whereby we are justified, is only the favour of God; let him be anathema.\n\n“CANON XII.-If any one saith, that justifying faith is nothing else but confidence in the divine mercy which remits sins for Christ’s sake; or, that this confidence alone is that whereby we are justified; let him be anathema.”\n\nThe book of Galatians emphasizes the truth that people jeopardize their salvation if they add anything to Jesus’ work as the reason for their salvation. That is an important message—not just for members of the church you referenced but all people.\n\nAll false doctrine is serious and threatening to saving faith. It may not be popular to point out false doctrine today, but Christians will do that if they care about the eternal welfare of others.\n\nI hope this response has answered your questions satisfactorily.\n\nMormons are interested in genealogies and Web sites that contain genealogical data because that supplies them with information to be used for their baptisms of the dead.\n\n“The teachings of Mormonism state that non-Mormons will enter spirit prison after physical death and wait for Judgment Day. Those in spirit prison have the opportunity to convert to Mormonism, but they cannot eternally progress unless they are baptized. Such spirits must receive baptism vicariously through a living person on earth since they do not have a body that can be baptized. The work of baptizing for the dead (or redeeming the dead) happens only in the temple. Faithful Mormons will carry out this important temple work as a means to further their divine potential. This is the primary motivation behind the extensive genealogical research carried out by the LDS Church. Mormons will refer to this activity as doing family history work.” (From Truth in Love Ministry)\n\nUsing an LDS-owned or affiliated Web site will provide information that can be used in a religious ceremony—a ceremony that is entirely void of truth and consequence. If supplying that information bothers you, I would not submit it. If you do not want the Mormons to have more names for their baptism of the dead, I would not utilize the Web sites. If your approach is: “I’m interested in my family history and it doesn’t bother me what a church does with the names of family members because the souls of those family members are beyond the reach of that church,” then go ahead and make use of those Web sites. (You see that conscience is a factor here.)\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about Mormonism, visit the Truth in Love Ministry Web site.\n\nYou are correct in saying that “we do not have the authority to make things sin that God has not called sin.” Seventh-Day Adventists have a history of taking “indifferent matters,” including items of food and drink that God has neither commanded nor forbidden in his word and putting them on a “forbidden list.” Their web site lists such items. The book of Galatians is a wonderful exposition and application of Christian freedom. Do share that book with your friend.\n\nWhile some 23 states have legalized medicinal marijuana usage and four other states have legalized “recreational” marijuana usage, the substance remains illegal elsewhere in our country. Where it is illegal, it is a matter of obeying the government, as you noted. Where it has been legalized, Christians will recognize that government legislation does not necessarily or automatically make something God pleasing. Consider the legalization of abortion, no-fault divorce and same-sex marriage.\n\nThoughts of using that legalized substance need to be balanced by asking: If something is permissible, is it beneficial? (1 Corinthians 10:23) Is an activity beneficial for me—and others? The 1 Corinthians 10:23 passage occurs in the context of exercising our Christian freedom with an eye on how our actions might impact others—especially emboldening them to act against their conscience, and so to sin against their conscience. Would usage lead a person to dull his/her senses and lose self-control? (Proverbs 31:4-5; Luke 21:34; Romans 13:13; Galatians 5:21; Ephesians 5:18) The Bible tells us to “Be alert and of sober mind” (1 Peter 5:8). Would usage lead to addiction? The first time the phrase “everything is permissible for me” occurs in 1 Corinthians is in chapter 6. There (verse 12) Paul explains that we will not want to “be mastered by anything.” Might a person act in doubt and thus sin? (Romans 14:23) Will a person be harming the body that God created and which belongs to him? (This is a 5th commandment issue.) Questions like these urge extreme caution in a specific area of which the Bible is silent.\n\nFinally, you are correct in that you do not want to “get mired in legalism” in your discussions with your friend. To a person who belongs to a church which officially teaches work righteousness, point your friend to Jesus Christ as Savior—complete Savior, perfect Savior. Show your friend from Scripture that salvation is entirely God’s work not ours (Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:5-7). God bless your discussions!\n\nBoth churches do confess what the Bible teaches, that God is triune. That is why, for example, our church will recognize the Christian baptisms that are performed in the Roman Catholic Church and we will not re-baptize such individuals who wish to join our church.\n\nWhile there is a common confession in both churches regarding the Triune God, there is an obvious difference in what the churches teach when it comes to the saving work of the Son of God, Jesus Christ. We believe what the Bible teaches: that we are saved solely by the merits of Jesus Christ, and our works do not contribute in any way to our salvation (Ephesians 2:8-9; Titus 3:4-7). The Roman Catholic Church teaches that salvation is a cooperative effort between God and people. That teaching does not lead to salvation, as the book of Galatians especially explains. One hopes that members of the Roman Catholic Church reject what their church officially teaches about salvation and trust only in Jesus Christ for their salvation.\n\nI would think that you and your sister could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the doctrinal differences between the Lutheran Church—WELS specifically—and the Roman Catholic Church. A Lutheran Looks at Catholics provides such a detailed explanation. It would be a good read for both of you.\n\nWhether or not you read that book, you and your sister will want to search the Scriptures to see how accurately churches present the teachings of the Bible.\n\nhe Jehovah’s Witnesses and Mormons are accurately identified as cults in that their teachings are drastically different from historic, orthodox Christianity. A previous answer on this Web site called attention to these characteristics of cults: “They make a claim of new truth or revelation or new interpretation of Scripture. They have a non-biblical source of authority (e.g., the Book of Mormon). They almost always deny the full deity of Jesus and are therefore almost invariably non-Trinitarian. They often employ double talk–using Christian terms with different meanings. They are invariably work righteous. Their theology is often in flux: it changes to suit the circumstances. They often employ false prophecy and predictions. They are often gathered around a charismatic leader or prophet.” The churches referenced would not be considered Christian.\n\nOne can only hope and pray that individuals in those churches are, through their own Bible reading, understanding and believing the truth about salvation by faith in Jesus Christ. If they believe that truth, then they need to have consistency in their lives by having membership in a church that teaches biblical truth.\n\nBecause the Bible is used and the sacraments are administered in the Roman Catholic Church, the Holy Spirit can bring people to saving faith. That acknowledgment does not in any way diminish the seriousness of that church’s errors in how the Bible is taught and how the sacraments are taught and administered. That acknowledgement simply recognizes the presence of the means through which the Holy Spirit can carry out his sanctifying work.\n\nYour questions underscore how vitally important and urgent it is to share the gospel of Jesus Christ with others (Matthew 28:19-20; 1 Peter 2:9; 3:15).\n\nThe teachings of Christian Science are not Christian or biblical. Consider some of the following false teachings found in Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures (and the pages where the information can be found), written by Christian Science founder Mary Baker Eddy:\n\nThere is a denial of the Trinity. “Life, Truth, and Love constitute the triune Person called God—that is the triply divine Principle, Love. They represent a trinity in unity, three in one,–the same in essence, though multi-form in office: God the Father-Mother; Christ the spiritual idea of sonship; divine Science or the Holy Comforter” (Page 331).\n\nThere is a denial of the divinity of Jesus Christ. “The Jew who believes in the First Commandment is a monotheist; he has one omnipresent God. Thus the Jew unites with the Christian’s doctrine that God is come and is present now and forever. The Christian who believes in the First Commandment is a monotheist. Thus he virtually unites with the Jew’s belief in one God, and recognizes that Jesus Christ is not God, as Jesus himself declared, but is the Son of God. This declaration of Jesus, understood, conflicts not at all with another of his sayings: “I and the Father are one,”—that is, one in quality, not in quantity (Page 361).\n\nThere is a denial of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. “They who earliest saw Jesus after the resurrection and beheld the final proof of all that he had taught, misconstrued that event…Jesus’ students, not sufficiently advanced fully to understand their Master’s triumph, did not perform many wonderful works, until they saw him after his crucifixion and learned that he had not died…Jesus’ unchanged physical condition after what seemed to be death…” (Pages 45-46).\n\nThere is a denial of Jesus’ atoning work. “Wisdom and Love may require many sacrifices of self to save us from sin. One sacrifice, however great, is insufficient to pay the debt of sin. The atonement requires constant self-immolation on the sinner’s part. That God’s wrath should be vented upon His beloved Son, is divinely unnatural. Such a theory is man-made” (Page 23).\n\nThe Bible teaches that God is Triune (Matthew 28:19; John 14:7-18), that Jesus Christ is God (John 1:1; 5:22-23; Colossians 2:9), that Jesus Christ rose from the dead as proof that our salvation is complete (Romans 4:25; 1 Corinthians 15), that Jesus Christ is the atoning sacrifice for the sins of the world (1 John 2:2).\n\nIt has been noted that Christian Science is neither Christian nor scientific. Those in its churches need to hear the truths of the Bible.\n\nThese factors are generally put forth as explanations for the growth of Islam in the United States: a higher birth rate among Muslims and the immigration of Muslims to America. Growth also takes place through intermarriage with Muslims.\n\nEarly in its history Islam appealed to people because of its simplistic faith. While Christians were debating matters of intricate doctrine, Islam promoted a “simple” faith consisting of only five “pillars,” or five duties, that adherents needed to perform. That impression of a simplistic faith, I suppose, still appeals to some people. In addition, because Islam is a work-righteous religion, it naturally appeals to people who think there is something they have to do and can do to find peace with a higher power.\n\nWhen it comes to your question of why God “doesn’t stop them,” I have to bow in humility to God’s wisdom (Romans 11:33-36). God knows what he is doing, and he is doing everything in the best interests of his Church. I have to keep that same section of Scripture in mind when God tells me that shortly before the end of the world, he will grant Satan more freedom to carry out his dastardly work (Revelation 20:7-8). I marvel at the question Jesus posed about his visible return on the last day: “When the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?” (Luke 18:8)\n\nOver time, God’s followers have been a “little flock” (Luke 12:32) compared to the numbers of people caught up in false religions. Because of what the Bible says about “terrible times in the last days” (2 Timothy 3:1), we can expect that description of the Church to hold true.\n\nAll this is not reason for discouragement. No, the Good Shepherd of the little flock promises us his protecting love and informs us of his generous love that seeks to add sheep to his flock (John 10).\n\nChristian Science is not OK. Be aware that its teachings are not Christian or biblical. Consider some of the following false teachings found in Science and Health with Key to the Scriptures (and the pages where the information can be found):\n\nThere is a denial of the Trinity. “Life, Truth, and Love constitute the triune Person called God—that is the triply divine Principle, Love. They represent a trinity in unity, three in one,–the same in essence, though multi-form in office: God the Father-Mother; Christ the spiritual idea of sonship; divine Science or the Holy Comforter.” (Page 331)\n\nThere is a denial of the divinity of Jesus Christ. “The Jew who believes in the First Commandment is a monotheist; he has one omnipresent God. Thus the Jew unites with the Christian’s doctrine that God is come and is present now and forever. The Christian who believes in the First Commandment is a monotheist. Thus he virtually unites with the Jew’s belief in one God, and recognizes that Jesus Christ is not God, as Jesus himself declared, but is the Son of God. This declaration of Jesus, understood, conflicts not at all with another of his sayings: “I and the Father are one,”—that is, one in quality, not in quantity. (Page 361)\n\nThere is a denial of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. “They who earliest saw Jesus after the resurrection and beheld the final proof of all that he had taught, misconstrued that event…Jesus’ students, not sufficiently advanced fully to understand their Master’s triumph, did not perform many wonderful works, until they saw him after his crucifixion and learned that he had not died…Jesus’ unchanged physical condition after what seemed to be death…” (Pages 45-46)\n\nThere is a denial of Jesus’ atoning work. “Wisdom and Love may require many sacrifices of self to save us from sin. One sacrifice, however great, is insufficient to pay the debt of sin. The atonement requires constant self-immolation on the sinner’s part. That God’s wrath should be vented upon His beloved Son, is divinely unnatural. Such a theory is man-made.” (Page 23)\n\nI would urge you to turn to the Bible to see the truth, believe the truth through the power of the Holy Spirit and confess the truth. God is Triune (Matthew 28:19; John 14:7-18). Jesus is God (John 1:1; 5:22-23; Colossians 2:9). Jesus Christ rose from the dead as proof that our salvation is complete. (Romans 4:25; 1 Corinthians 15). Jesus is the atoning sacrifice for sin. (1 John 2:2).\n\nChristian Science operates with illusions; Christianity is all about realities. Do turn to the Bible to find the truth. Speak with a pastor of one of our churches to have a more in-depth conversation about Jesus Christ, the world’s only Savior.\n\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is the official name for Mormonism. Their television commercials are very appealing and family oriented, but Mormonism cannot be considered a Christian denomination.\n\nThe Latter Day Saints deny the scriptural doctrine of the Trinity. They teach that there are many gods and human beings can become gods themselves through a kind of spiritual evolution. Mormons are taught “As man now is, God once was; as God now is, man may become.” Mormonism denies the scriptural teaching of justification by grace alone through faith in Jesus and teaches a system of salvation by works. They teach that people are born inherently good and have the freedom to make the right decisions. They believe that people progress by making wise use of this freedom.\n\nMormons practice “baptism for the dead.” They believe that the spirits of the dead can accept Mormonism in the spirit world, but since they don’t have a body they cannot be baptized. Since Mormon baptism is essential for spiritual progression, Mormons can be baptized in the place of a departed relative. This is the reason why Mormonism places such an emphasis on genealogy.\n\nMormons teach that there are three spirit kingdoms to which the spirits of the dead can go. The Celestial Kingdom is the highest kingdom and is reserved for faithful Mormons and those who die before the age of eight. The Terrestrial Kingdom is for moral non-Mormons and less “valiant” Mormons. The Telestial Kingdom is the place where most people will go after suffering for their sins. This is the kingdom of the least glory.\n\nThe Mormons accept the following as scripture: The Bible, The Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price. They also consider the words of their living prophets to be scripture.\n\nFor more information about Mormonism and witnessing to Mormons visit www.tilm.org.\n\nJust as all churches that bear the name “Lutheran” do not teach the same as other “Lutherans,” so not all churches that bear the name “Presbyterian” teach exactly the same. We can, however, speak of what Presbyterians believed historically and compare it with what confessional Lutherans believe.\n\nHistorically, as strict Calvinists, Presbyterians taught that from eternity God elected some to be saved and some to be damned (double predestination). By no means do all Presbyterians believe this today. Confessional Lutherans believe that from eternity God chose those whom he would convert through the gospel and preserve in faith to eternal life. See Ephesians 1:4-6; Romans 8:29,30). Confessional Lutherans reject the notion that unbelievers were predestined to damnation, for “God does not will that any should perish” (see 1 Timothy 2:4 and 2 Peter 3:9).\n\nHistorically, and as a corollary of the Calvinist belief in double predestination, Presbyterians taught that Christ atoned for the sins only of those predestined for life in heaven. Confessional Lutherans believe that Jesus Christ, the God-man, was sent by the Father to atone for the sins of all people, and that he did so. See Romans 5:18,19; Isaiah 53:6; 2 Corinthians 5:19; and John 1:29.\n\nHistorically, Presbyterians believed that it is impossible for a believer to fall from the faith. Confessional Lutherans believe that it is possible for believers to fall from faith. See 1 Corinthians 10:12.\n\nHistorically, Presbyterians have believed that Sunday has replaced Saturday as the Sabbath, to be observed in a way similar to the Old Testament regulations. Confessional Lutherans believe that New Testament believers are free to gather for worship on Sunday (or any other day), without special rules regarding work or recreation. See Colossians 2:16,17: “Do not let anyone judge you . . . with regard to a Sabbath day. These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ.”\n\nThe name “Presbyterian” means “having elders (teaching and ruling or presiding),” as the only form of church government that has God’s approval. Confessional Lutherans believe that the Lord has instituted and provides for the gospel ministry, but that there are no commands in the New Testament as to forms of organization.\n\nLike other Protestant (non-Lutheran) churches, Presbyterians do not believe that Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are means of grace—forms of the gospel through which the Holy Spirit gives and strengthens faith. Confessional Lutherans believe that Baptism gives new life (Titus 3:5) and cleanses from all sin (Acts 2:38). Confessional Lutherans believe that as believers receive Christ’s body and blood under the bread and wine they also receive the forgiveness of sins (Matthew 26:28; 1 Corinthians 10:16).Presbyterians do not believe communicants receive the Lord’s Body and Blood in his Supper.\n\nThere are many differences between the United Methodists and Lutherans. I will note some of the most basic.\n\nFollowing the father of Methodism, John Wesley, United Methodist theology is basically Arminian. The United Methodists teach that unconverted people have free will in spiritual matters or the ability to accept or reject God’s offer of salvation.\n\nLutherans teach that unconverted human beings are dead in their trespasses and sins (Ephesians 2:1, 5), hostile to God (Romans 8:6-8), and cannot accept the gospel message (1 Corinthians 2:14). Human beings play no part in their own conversion, but are purely passive.\n\nThe United Methodists teach that God’s “prevenient grace” surrounds all humanity and “prompts our first wish to please God” and “our first glimmer of understanding of God’s will.” This grace surrounds everyone whether they have ever heard the gospel or not. Lutherans believe that God’s grace comes to us only through the means of grace, the gospel in God’s Word and the sacraments. There is no salvation apart from the means of grace (Romans 10:13-17).\n\nLutherans put the primary theological emphasis on justification and what God has done for us in sending his Son to live and die for us, forgiving all of our sins and giving us eternal life and salvation. Methodists put their primary theological emphasis on sanctification and what God does in us to lead us to do his will. Lutherans teach that every Christian is both sinner and saint at the same time and will remain so until we reach the perfection of heaven. Methodists teach the possibility of reaching Christian perfection in this life.\n\nThe United Methodists see Scripture as the primary source and criterion for Christian doctrine. They emphasize the importance of tradition, experience, and reason for Christian doctrine. Lutherans teach that the Bible is the sole source for Christian doctrine. The truths of Scripture do not need to be authenticated by tradition, human experience, or reason. Scripture is self authenticating and is true in and of itself.\n\nThe United Methodists believe that the church has a responsibility toward the structures of society and therefore commit themselves “to the rights of men, women, children, youth, young adults, the aging, and people with disabilities; to improvement of the quality of life; and to the rights and dignity of racial, ethnic, and religious minorities . . . collective bargaining, and responsible consumption; and in the elimination of economic and social distress.”\n\nLutherans believe that God has given the church the commission to proclaim the gospel and administer the sacraments so that people can be saved for eternity (Matthew 28:18-20). God has not called the church to reform society or to wield the law as a curb for societal ills. God has instituted the government for that purpose (Romans 13:1-7). As the church carries out its responsibility of proclaiming the gospel and there are more Christians in a country, society will be affected. For individual Christians as citizens will work to address the problems that they see and to improve society. The Christians are then carrying out their responsibility as citizens and are not carrying out the work of the church. We reject the social gospel, the belief that the church’s responsibility is to change the structures of society through mass or group action.\n\nComparing teachings of the Seventh-Day Adventist Church with the Bible reveals errors such as the following.\n\nThat church teaches that: Saturday is the divinely-appointed day of worship, the writings of Ellen G. White have prophetic authority, baptism is only a symbol of the believer’s union with God, the Lord’s Supper is a meal in which Jesus’ body and blood are symbolized, there is soul-sleep after death, there is a mixture of faith and obedience to the commandments for salvation, there is a no hell, there is a millennium, and there are rules for diet and dress. The church’s history includes failed predictions of Jesus’ visible return on the last day.\n\nWhen it comes to a Seventh-Day Adventist and the book of Romans, I imagine the discomfort would be Romans 14:5-6 – a section that speaks of Christian freedom in connection with days of worship. That section is as problematic for such a person as Colossians 2:16-17 – “Therefore do not let anyone judge you by what you eat or drink, or with regard to a religious festival, a New Moon celebration or a Sabbath day. These are a shadow of the things that were to come; the reality, however, is found in Christ.” Members of the church in question can benefit from a clear presentation of the Bible’s teachings of law and gospel.\n\nThe Statement of Faith of the Evangelical Free Church of America (EFCA) departs from biblical teaching in the areas of the sacraments and Jesus’ visible return on the last day. In referencing Baptism and the Lord’s Supper, the Statement of Faith identifies them as “ordinances,” “which visibly and tangibly express the gospel. Though they are not the means of salvation, when celebrated by the church in genuine faith, these ordinances confirm and nourish the believer.”\n\nBy turning sacraments into “ordinances,” the EFCA denies that Baptism and the Lord’s Supper are means of grace through which God offers and gives forgiveness of sins, life and salvation. When sacraments become “ordinances,” then the focus is on doing and not receiving.\n\nThe Bible teaches that God offers and gives forgiveness of sins, life and salvation through Baptism and the Lord’s Supper (Acts 2:38; Acts 22:16; Matthew 26:28).\n\nThe Statement of Faith also expresses belief “in the personal, bodily and premillennial return of our Lord Jesus Christ.” The Bible does not teach that Jesus will return to this world to rule over a literal 1,000-year period of peace on earth. Jesus explained to Pontius Pilate that his kingdom is not of this world (John 18:36).\n\nIn a document titled “Distinctives of the Evangelical Free Church of America,” the statement is made: “We join with other Christians and other denominations of like, precious faith in common goals and ministries to accomplish the Great Commandment and the Great Commission.” That position of ecumenism runs contrary to Romans 16:17, but fits in with the EFCA’s position of “In essentials, unity. In non-essentials, charity.”\n\nI am happy to see that the EFCA’s Statement of Faith points people to Jesus Christ as the only Savior from sin, but doctrinal errors—any errors—are serious and potentially destructive of saving faith (Galatians 5:9).\n\nThis We Believe, a statement of belief of our church body, makes this profession:\n\n“1. We believe that there is one holy Christian church, which is the temple of God (1 Corinthians 3:16) and the body of Christ (Ephesians 1:23; 4:12). The members of this one church are all those who are the ‘sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus’ (Galatians 3:26). The church, then, consists only of believers, or saints, whom God accepts as holy for the sake of Jesus’ righteousness, which has been credited to them (2 Corinthians 5:21). These saints are scattered throughout the world. All people who believe that Jesus is their Savior from sin are members of the holy Christian church, regardless of the nation, race, or church body to which they belong.\n\n“2. We believe that this holy Christian church is a reality, although it is not an external, visible organization. Because ‘man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart’ (1 Samuel 16:7), only the Lord knows ‘those who are his’ (2 Timothy 2:19). The members of the holy Christian church are known only to God; we cannot distinguish between true believers and hypocrites. The holy Christian church is therefore invisible and cannot be identified with any one church body or with the total membership of all church bodies.\n\n“3. We believe that the presence of the holy Christian church nevertheless can be recognized. Wherever the gospel is preached and the sacraments are administered, the holy Christian church is present, for through the means of grace true faith is produced and preserved (Isaiah 55:10,11). The means of grace, therefore, are called the marks of the church.”\n\nThe preceding paragraphs explain that we can have brothers and sisters in the faith “wherever the gospel is preached and the sacraments are administered.” When the Holy Spirit works through the gospel and leads people to confess that Jesus Christ is their Savior from sin, those people are our brothers and sisters in the faith.\n\nBut you recognize from the preceding paragraphs that we’re speaking about the invisible church: the holy Christian church, the communion of saints. God alone knows who belongs to that church; God alone can see what is in a person’s heart.\n\nYou and I operate in the world of visible churches—where we can see who the members are. So, when people join a church, their membership implies their faith is parallel to what their church teaches. In the context of your question, that means that people who belong to the Roman Catholic Church state by their membership that they believe what that church teaches. As the Roman Catholic Church is a heterodox church, one hopes that the people who belong to it disregard their church’s wrong teachings about salvation and trust only in Jesus Christ for their salvation. If that is the case, then they too are part of the holy Christian Church, the communion of saints.\n\nYou want to respond by speaking the truth in love (Ephesians 4:15) to people who need to hear the truths of God’s law and God’s gospel.\n\nYou have the right attitude in that you do not want to argue with them. You don’t want to be rude to them or slam the door shut on them either. Jehovah’s Witnesses are told that they can expect persecution for their beliefs. Any rude behavior they encounter only reinforces their conviction that they have right beliefs.\n\nYou can simply confess your faith: that Jesus Christ is the God-Man who lived perfectly in your place, and suffered and died to endure the punishment your sins deserved. Jesus’ physical resurrection from the dead is proof positive that God the Father accepted Jesus’ life and death as the full payment for your sins (Romans 4:25). Through faith in Jesus, you can be confident that that you are at peace with God (Romans 5:1) and that you will be in God’s presence in heaven forever (Psalm 23:6).\n\nDon’t expect the visitors at your door to automatically agree with you, but you have planted the seed and shared the truth of God’s word with them. If you have time and want to engage Jehovah’s Witnesses in conversation, you will want to get them off their talking points. Ask them what they are doing to enjoy God’s forgiveness. When they point to their deeds, show them the demands of God’s law. “Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect” (Matthew 5:48). “For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it” (James 2:10). “The wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23). Share what God says in his word, that there is no salvation through people’s efforts to keep his law (Romans 3:20).\n\nThen, direct your visitors to Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God (Matthew 26:63-64; John 8:58). Point them to Jesus’ perfect life (Romans 10:4) and sacrificial death (Ephesians 1:7) as the only means by which God has forgiven the sins of people.\n\nIf you find yourself hosting Jehovah’s Witnesses regularly at your home, you might benefit from a resource like this from Northwestern Publishing House. God bless your efforts!\n\nWhy be a Christian? In spite of the false messages that permeate our world (that all religions lead to that same wonderful place, or that a loving God would never punish people eternally in hell), only Christianity provides a Savior from sin. Jesus said: “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6). There is only one Savior and it is Jesus Christ.\n\nIf we need more incentive than the assurance of eternal life to follow Jesus Christ in faith, then we can keep in mind that: only Christians can go through life with God’s assurance that they are at peace with him through the forgiveness of sins (Romans 5:1-2); only Christians have God’s assurance that they enjoy his powerful love now and in eternity (Romans 8:28-39); only Christians have God’s assurance that they are members of his family (1 John 3:1-2); only Christians have God’s assurance that he will hear and answer their prayers (1 Kings 18:16-40; Psalm 34:15-16; Proverbs 15:29). The list of blessings could continue.\n\nPerhaps you would find value in reading a Light for our Path column that addressed a similar question. God bless your study of his word.\n\nWe can only answer your question in a general way. There are between thirty and forty different kinds of Baptists in the United States alone, so they do not all believe and teach precisely the same things. But they have general traits that can be mentioned here.\n\nIn most Baptist doctrinal statements there are portions that are basically identical with ours, such as a high view of the authority and accuracy of the Bible, the importance and reality of Jesus Christ and his work as our substitute, and the confession of mankind’s sin and need for the Savior as well as God’s grace and saving work for us. In short, there is much to be thankful for, since fundamental Christianity is confessed here.\n\nYou asked about differences. First of all they reject the sacraments (both Baptism and the Lord’s Supper) as instruments through which God graciously creates or strengthens faith in human hearts. They treat the sacraments as “ordinances” to be obeyed, and being baptized or receiving communion is an “act of obedience” and something WE do rather than primarily a tool of God to give blessings.\n\nBaptism: Southern Baptists believe that baptism is an act of obedience symbolizing a believer’s faith. They do not baptize infants. We believe that baptism is a means of grace through which the Holy Spirit works faith, offers and conveys the forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation (Titus 3:5-7, Acts 2:38, Acts 22:16, 1 Peter 3:21). We believe that infants are to be baptized because they are included in Christ’s command to baptize all nations (Matthew 28:19). They are sinful and need to be born again (Psalm 51:5, John 3:5-6). Babies also can believe (Luke 18:15-17).\n\nLord’s Supper: The Southern Baptists believe that the Lord’s Supper is a symbolic act of obedience whereby members of the church memorialize the death of Jesus. They deny the real presence in the Lord’s Supper. We believe that Christ’s true body and blood are given with the bread and wine to assure us that our sins are forgiven (Matthew 26:26-28, 1 Corinthians 11:23-29, 1 Corinthians 10:16-17).\n\nMost Baptists believe we can cooperate in our conversion, making a decision for Christ. Lutherans believe we cooperate with the Holy Spirit only after our conversion. He is completely responsible for the change that takes place in our conversion.\n\nWe believe in election to salvation as taught in Ephesians 1. The Bible clearly says there is no predestination to damnation, but God wants all to be saved.\n\nMany Baptists hold to a concept called “once saved, always saved” that they called “eternal security.” We believe a person can fall from faith because the Bible says he can (Hebrews 10:26-31, 1 Corinthians 10:12). We don’t base this conclusion on reason. But in this case the principle is the same as a common principle of daily life: if I give you a gift of money, you have not done anything to earn it, but if you foolishly throw it away you lose the benefit of the gift. Faith and forgiveness is a pure gift, but the person who throws them away loses the blessing that was his.\n\nOne dictionary defines “Akashic record” as “An alleged record of all events, actions and thoughts that have ever occurred or ever will, which is linked to akasha, the so-called astral light.” People with special abilities are said to be able to access information and relay it to others.\n\nA Christian response to Akashic records is to reject the idea as being unbiblical. It is God who knows all things (Job 34:21; Psalm 139:1-4; 147:5; Hebrews 4:13; 1 John 3:20). God forbids people from trying to obtain knowledge from spiritists and mediums (Leviticus 19:31; Deuteronomy 18:10-12; Isaiah 8:19-20). God’s word provides direction for life (Psalm 119:105).\n\nSatan, who “masquerades as an angel of light” (2 Corinthians 11:14), seeks to distract people from God’s word and the truth they need in life. What you are asking about can be another way in which Satan carries out his work. You could help your friend the best by encouraging regular contact with God’s word through worship, Bible class and personal study. Pray also that God will open eyes and hearts to see, believe and confess the truth.\n\nHow can we be sure that God’s word is our sole authority in life? The answer to a similar question may be of help to you. This link will take you to that information. God bless the help you are offering to your friend.\n\nYou have a correct understanding. “Speaking the truth in love” applies to our conversations to fellow Christians and those outside the faith.\n\nWhen fellow Christians stereotype people of a false religion, you can remind them that those people too were the object of God’s love when he sent Jesus into the world on his saving mission (John 3:16). You can remind fellow Christians that the following Scripture passages apply also to Muslims: “The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance” (2 Peter 3:9). “This is good, and pleases God our Savior, who wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth. For there is one God and one mediator between God and mankind, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all people” (1 Timothy 2:3-6).\n\nPeople who presently reject Jesus Christ as their Savior are outside the kingdom of God. If people die without faith in Jesus in their hearts, they will spend eternity apart from God (Mark 16:16). Compassion for the lost (for example, Romans 9:3), will lead us to pray for their conversion and to support the worldwide spread of the gospel, so that the Holy Spirit can change the hearts and lives of more and more people.\n\nFinally, speaking God’s truth can include the identification and rejection of ungodly actions and attitudes. Our Lord did that during his ministry (cf. Matthew 23). However, we will let God be the judge of people’s hearts.\n\nThe quotation in your question reminds me of a good book that was written on this subject: Speaking the Truth in Love to Muslims. Your church library may have a copy. If not, it is available through Northwestern Publishing House. Perhaps you and others might also benefit from a Light for our path column that previously addressed a question like yours. I commend that for your reading. I commend you also for the concern you have for fellow Christians’ attitudes toward the lost.\n\nThe organization you referenced fails to recognize that Old Testament laws fell into different categories: civil, ceremonial and moral. As we are not citizens of Old Testament Israel, the civil laws given through Moses do not apply to us. The Old Testament ceremonial laws were meant for Old Testament Israel and had the purpose of pointing ahead to Jesus. When Jesus came and carried out his work, those laws were abolished. The tearing of the temple curtain on Good Friday illustrated that (Matthew 27:51). God’s moral law remains for New Testament followers of the Lord. The moral law is God’s will for all people of all time. The ten commandments serve as a nice summary of the moral law.\n\nThe chief purpose of God’s law is to point out our sinfulness and show our need for a Savior. The organization you referenced places a different emphasis on the law and people’s obedience of it. They state: “Our obedience is the evidence and substance of our faith.”\n\nThe organization you referenced has false ideas about the end times: multiple judgments before God and a literal millennium, for example.\n\nYour “sounding of the alarm” is a good reminder and encouragement for Christians to “test the spirits” (1 John 4:1) and to remain in Jesus’ words (John 15:7).\n\nThe starting point in my response is that Martin Luther is not the foundation of our faith. Our doctrine or practice has not resulted from any of Martin Luther’s writings. We certainly do not rubber-stamp everything he wrote. What we do is recognize that Luther was a highly gifted individual whom God used at a critical time in history to restore the truths of his word. Scripture alone, which points to Jesus Christ as Savior, is the foundation of our faith (Ephesians 2:20).\n\nWhile Luther expressed some views toward Jews that we cannot condone, his position cannot be described as “virulently anti-Semitic” or even “anti-Semitic” as the term is defined and understood today. Luther did not speak out against Jews simply because they were Jews. Luther wrote some harsh words because of the Jews’ rejection of Jesus Christ as the promised Messiah (just as he wrote harsh words against others who were opposed to the gospel of Jesus Christ). As he did so, he included these words in his Preface to the work you cited: “We must indeed with prayer and the fear of God before our eyes exercise a keen compassion towards them [the Jews] and seek to save some of them from the flames. Avenge ourselves we dare not.”\n\nThe supposed connection between Luther’s writings and the “final solution” is addressed and dismantled by Uwe Siemon-Netto in his book: The Fabricated Luther: Refuting Nazi Connections and Modern Myths. I commend that book for your reading.\n\nIn this 500th anniversary of the Lutheran Reformation, Martin Luther is obviously going to receive attention, but we do well to keep him in perspective. Our gracious God deserves our greatest attention—and praise. To him alone be glory.\n\nYour question links the charitable work of the Salvation Army with the mission of that church, which is driven by their false doctrine. That is important to keep in mind. The work they do is in line with the mission of their church.\n\nAs you indicated, there is false doctrine in that church. The Salvation Army is a self-described “holiness movement,” placing greater emphasis on the Christian’s life than on what God has done for people through Jesus Christ his Son. The Salvation Army rejects the sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s Supper.\n\n2 John 10-11 (“If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not take them into your house or welcome them. Anyone who welcomes them shares in their wicked work.”) instructs us not to support those whose teachings are contrary to Scripture. That applies to the church in your question. That applies to any church that holds to false doctrine. While we can appreciate the tenacity of the bell ringers of that church at Christmas time, we cannot support their mission.\n\nThere is no need to feel like a Scrooge by walking past the bell ringers. We can help meet the material needs of others (Isaiah 58:7; Galatians 6:10) through contributions to charitable agencies that are not tied to churches that hold to and teach false doctrine. We can give to our church body’s Christian Aid and Relief.\n\nIn gratitude for God’s blessings and in compassionate concern for the material and spiritual needs of others, Christians have reason for charitable giving at Christmas time and every season of the year. Yes, “Let us all be cheerful givers To the glory of your name” (Christian Worship 577:3).\n\nOne of the errors of the Jehovah’s Witnesses is their belief that only 144,000 people will go to heaven, while the overflow crowd will have an eternal home on a new earth. Jehovah’s Witnesses understand the numbers of Revelation 7:4-8 literally but the tribes figuratively. In addition, they fail to grasp what the apostle John writes immediately after that: “After this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb” (Revelation 7:9). Heaven’s capacity is not comparable to the population of Mesquite, Texas.\n\n(On a side note, the phrase in the Lord’s Prayer, “on earth as it is in heaven,” belongs with “your will be done” not “your kingdom come.”)\n\nWhat the Bible does teach (Isaiah 65:17; 66:22; 2 Peter 3:13; and, Revelation 21:1) is that on the last day God will destroy this world as we know it and fashion a new world to be the eternal home for his people.\n\nBut more than being wrong on how many people will be in heaven, Jehovah’s Witnesses are wrong on how people get to heaven. They deny the Trinity and Jesus’ deity—being co-equal with the Father (John 10:30). Sadly, theirs is a religion based on work righteousness.\n\nWhat you can do in your next conversation with Jehovah’s Witnesses is ask them what they are doing to enjoy God’s forgiveness. When they point to their deeds, show them the demands of God’s law. “Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect” (Matthew 5:48). “For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all of it” (James 2:10). “The wages of sin is death” (Romans 6:23). Explain that there is no salvation through people’s efforts to keep God’s law (Romans 3:20).\n\nThen, direct them to Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God (Matthew 26:63-64; John 8:58). Point them to Jesus’ perfect life (Romans 10:4) and sacrificial death (Ephesians 1:7) as the only means by which God has forgiven the sins of people.\n\nLike me, you recognize that all we can do is speak the truths of God’s word to people. We cannot control what happens after that. But do pray that God will use your witnessing to change hearts and lives and lead people to trust in Jesus alone for their salvation.\n\nIf you find yourself hosting Jehovah’s Witnesses regularly at your home, you might benefit from these resources from Northwestern Publishing House. God bless your efforts!\n\nChristian faith is a matter of the heart, isn’t it? Christian faith is the result of the Holy Spirit’s work in a person’s heart through the word of God. Because of that, Christian faith is not arguable or debatable. What I mean is that I cannot convince you or anyone else of the truths of Scripture; only God can do that. And God does that.\n\nGod can do that because his word is truly unique. “For the word of God is alive and active. Sharper than any double-edged sword, it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit, joints and marrow; it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart” (Hebrews 4:12). The Emmaus disciples understood what the living word of God was all about when the risen Lord spoke to them: “Were not our hearts burning within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?” (Luke 24:32) When you read Scripture, the Holy Spirit convinces you that it is truthful and that Jesus Christ is the world’s only Savior (John 14:6).\n\nBeyond these matters of faith, I can point out these contrasts between Christianity and all other religions. Only Christianity speaks of a God who freely offers salvation (Romans 6:23; Ephesians 2:8-9). Only Christianity speaks of a God who gave of himself because he cared about people in their lost condition (1 John 4:10). Only Christianity speaks of a living Savior—one who willingly died and rose from the dead (Revelation 1:17-18). Only Christianity speaks of the testimony of many witnesses who saw their eternal Savior (1 Corinthians 15:3-8).\n\nWhen it comes to visible Christian churches, you and I need to “test the spirits” (1 John 4:1). We need to examine the confessions and doctrinal statements of churches and compare them to what the Bible says. Then we will recognize true and false churches. And then we will know whether or not to join together with them (Romans 16:17).\n\n“Now faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see”\n\n(Hebrews 11:1). Christian faith is Spirit-worked confidence and trust in what God says in his word. That same word is what God uses to create and strengthen faith (Romans 10:17). I encourage you, then, to “Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly…” (Colossians 3:16) and to be a frequent guest at the Lord’s Supper (1 Corinthians 11:25), so that the Holy Spirit has opportunities to convince you all the more that “Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name” (John 20:31)."
