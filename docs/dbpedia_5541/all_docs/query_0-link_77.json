        "text": "The odds are good you won‚Äôt read this entire post. The reason? It has to do with confirmation bias. If you think what I am going to say conflicts with your belief system ‚Äì whether you are a scientist or a Christian ‚Äì you won‚Äôt finish it to avoid cognitive dissonance even though you aren‚Äôt entirely sure what I will say.\n\nRuby and I have been discussing Glenn Beck‚Äôs week of ‚ÄúIslam is going to result in the rise of the Anti-Christ‚Äù television shows that have been all over the news lately. (I‚Äôm really not making that up ‚Äì if you live outside of the United States, seriously ‚Ä¶ find the clips online if they are available. This is one of the highest rated television shows in the world.)\n\nThat‚Äôs not really the point. It occurred to me that the entire discussion provides the perfect example to illustrate one manifestation of the psychological concept of cognitive dissonance and how the human brain responds to conflicting input or belief systems, especially when the choices are purely binary (that is, mutually exclusive).\n\nJesus and Captain Kirk Cannot Co-Exist\n\nConsider the following statement:\n\nSomeone who believes in Christian eschatology (that is, the world will come under the influence of the Anti-Christ and the false prophet who will introduce a single global economic system, persecute Christians and declare himself God before Jesus Christ returns at the battle of Armageddon where all mankind has joined to fight before he doles out some WWE-style smack down) cannot, by definition, also believe that humanity will ever achieve space travel and colonization.\n\nChristian eschatology is based upon the absolutely non-negotiable position that all mankind will be judged and humanity as we know it ended upon the Second Coming of Jesus Christ (or ‚ÄúThe Second Coming‚Äù as it is often used in American culture; e.g., ‚ÄúHe thinks he‚Äôs the Second Coming‚Äù).\n\nHowever, if even a small portion of mankind no longer lives on planet Earth or has established a colony on Mars, the Moon, or in some sort of Space Station city that people like Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos would like to see happen, then ‚Äúall of mankind‚Äù cannot be here, on Earth, cannot be under the government of the Anti-Christ, cannot be forced to take the ‚ÄúMark of the Beast‚Äù and cannot unite in a war against the return of Jesus Christ.\n\nThis would indicate that if mankind ever did achieve space travel in any meaningful way, the Book of Revelation, as modern Christians believe it will happen, cannot come to pass and that it was a lie. Hence the mutually exclusive part. Only one can be true or happen but not both.\n\nCognitive Dissonance ‚Äì How Humans Handle Conflicting Belief Systems\n\nCognitive dissonance occurs when the brain holds two conflicting beliefs that cannot both be true. The brain tries to deal with this information in one of several ways:\n\nDenial: I‚Äôd be willing to bet that a decent percentage of people who say they believe in the Biblical account of the end-of-the-world would say they also believe mankind will some day achieve Star Trek-like technology at the rate we are going provided you did not ask the questions together in a relatively short period of time so they didn‚Äôt make the mental link between the two scenarios. By remaining in denial about the mutual exclusivity of the possibilities, the person can go cheerfully through life without confronting any hard decisions or experiencing emotional turmoil related to the quandry.\n\nHostility: The brain experiences hostility and causes the person who suffers the cognitive dissonance to get angry and, in some cases violent, with the person who points out the cognitive dissonance. You see this a lot with fundamental terrorist groups that kill anyone who is an ‚Äúinfidel‚Äù or an ‚Äúenemy of Islam‚Äù. In cults you hear people say, ‚ÄúThey are blind to the truth of the prophet‚Äù. In racists groups hear people say, ‚ÄúThey are a race traitor‚Äù, etc. The list is endless but the underlying emotional response is the same.\n\nModification of Beliefs: In this resolution mechanism, the original belief system is modified. People used to believe that Nero was the Anti-Christ. When Christ didn‚Äôt return, they went through other world leaders, including Napoleon. Each time, they have abandoned their previous beliefs and modified the interpretation of the book of Revelations to fit the world in which they lived.\n\nA Few More Biases You May Encounter\n\nNow here is the really interesting part.\n\nThroughout this entire post, I haven‚Äôt given a single word as to my personal belief or opinion on anything we‚Äôve discussed. You have no idea whether or not I believe in Christian eschatology (well, unless you are a family member or friend).\n\nThe point is that I‚Äôve simply illustrated a concept. I chose Christianity because it is a fairly important part of the American culture that everyone, even atheists, know enough about to follow the illustration.\n\nBut if you suffer from first conclusion bias, confirmation bias, and several of the other mental models, your mental response would have been one of the two following things based upon your own belief system:\n\n‚ÄúOf course he says that! He is a fiscally conservative right-wing Christian who believes in a book of fairy tales‚Äù or\n\n‚ÄúOf course he says that! He is a socially liberal rationalist who believes life should be viewed through the lens of science and calculated analysis of data.‚Äù\n\nIf you found yourself thinking either of those things at any point during this article, your mind was automatically attempting to protect your own first conclusion bias to avoid cognitive dissonance even though I never said a word about my own personal beliefs. You would have inferred them entirely based upon your own world view and projected your own biases and prejudices onto me. This explains the lunacy of the far-right and far-left media if you‚Äôve ever wondered how two people can listen to the same commentator and one scream ‚Äúliberal bias!‚Äù as the other screams, ‚Äúconservative bias!‚Äù. It is the same concept at work.\n\nSeriously ‚Äì go back and re-read this post. You won‚Äôt find my personal opinion on the topics involved anywhere. It‚Äôs all in your head based upon your own beliefs.\n\nPretty cool, huh? Who would have thought Captain Kirk and Jesus would have so much in common.\n\nBut you know the absolute coolest part?\n\nIf you actually read the first sentence of this post, it drastically increased the probability you reached this point due to an ingrained psychological need to prove that ‚Äúyou are different‚Äù and I ‚Äúdon‚Äôt know how you‚Äôll respond‚Äù. And I knew that when I wrote it. But teaching you how that works ‚Äì because it is another mental model that I‚Äôm not going to give you the name of, yet ‚Äì was worth it so forgive the trick üòâ"
