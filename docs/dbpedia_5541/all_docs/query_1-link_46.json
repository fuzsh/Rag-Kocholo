        "text": "Meet Kirk\n\nBorn in Arlington, Texas in a Christian home with two younger brothers. Glory to God and thankful for my parents who raised us in a church that taught us about Jesus. I accepted Jesus as savior of my life at a young age and am continually growing in my faith.\n\nGrowing up we lived in Maryland for a few years then Sherman, Texas before going to college in Shawnee, Oklahoma at Oklahoma Baptist University (Go Bison!). I studied Journalism/Video Production at OBU and more importantly met the love of my life, Hope!\n\nFast forward a few years, we married, and lived in Little Rock, Arkansas for 15 Years, I worked in TV news for a couple years and have served the church doing video production since 2007. The Lord grew our family through the adoption of our son, Tyler, who has now married and given us a beautiful grandson. And in 2021 we started the parenting journey over again with our wonderful little daughter, Lucy.\n\nI was introduced to Watermark by attending the Echo Church Conference in 2009 and after years of watching God’s faithfulness lived out here, joined Watermark in 2021 on the Video Production Team. As the Director of Video Production, I’m passionate about using technology to magnify the name of Jesus and give glory to God. We are blessed to create environments where The Body of Christ can gather for the purpose of corporate worship and teaching. The volunteers I help coach are the unsung heroes of the Production work and it’s a blessing to work alongside them."
