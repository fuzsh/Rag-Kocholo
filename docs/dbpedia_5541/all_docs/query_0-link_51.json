        "text": "Tracks\n\nBarnabas Track | The Pastor in a Secular Age (begins Sunday after dinner), Led by Rev. Dr. Andrew Root\n\nBeing a pastor is no easy task in our time. Institutions are weaker, budgets are in decline, people are uninterested, and commitment is wavering. But these are only symptoms of a bigger issue. In our time together, we will seek to peer beneath the symptoms and explore why many pastors find themselves in an identity crisis. The presentation examines what living in a secular age does to pastoral identity and how pastors can find new footing within it. We will explore topics like: Why are They Leaving? Misdiagnosing Our Challenges in a Secular Age, Ministry Inside the Immanent Frame, The Task of Speaking of God in a Secular Age, and Families, the Good Life, the Need for a Story, Or Why Everything Else is More Important than Church.\n\nBiblical Track | Reclaiming the Book of Revelation for Worship and Faith (Begins Monday at 3 pm), Led by Dr. Christopher Holmes\n\nThere are two broad approaches to Revelation among many Christians: fanatic obsession and intentional neglect. Some read everything—contemporary events, the election of political leaders, and the whole of Scripture—through a lens based in part on Revelation. Others pretend like Revelation is not even in the canon. But Revelation is a book for the Church. It can be a vital resource for worship and faith. This year’s biblical track will explore some of the most important themes in Revelation and wrestle with some of its most perplexing parts in the hopes that pastors will feel more confident preaching and teaching on this important writing.\n\nCreative Worship Track | Exploring Worship that's Welcoming! (begins Monday at 3 pm), Led by Rev. Burns Stanfield\n\nRev. Burns Stanfield will facilitate an exploration of worship as a way to engage hearts, build community, and practice faithful living. Two of our key tools for the workshop: stories and music. Drawing on personal and biblical stories, participants will learn about breathing new life into traditional liturgy and return to their congregations with creative ideas for crafting worship that is welcoming for all. We will explore music, liturgy, and testimony. With his unique gift for creating space for “all God’s people in the choir,\" Burns will help us draw on the God-given talents assembled in our workshop community.\n\nLeadership Track (begins Monday 9 am and a Sunday night arrival is suggested) | Making Room at the Table, Led by Rev. Dr. George B. Thompson Jr. and Rev. Dr. Beverly A. Thompson\n\nThis year’s Wee Kirk focus, “Emmanuel Living,” encourages us to imagine what being “God’s Neighborhood” might look like. How can the natural strengths and gifts of a smaller-membership congregation be utilized to become a welcoming, caring presence in God’s neighborhood? This track will help participants learn to listen deeply, as they identify and practice ways to extend hospitality and generosity to those outside the walls of their congregations.\n\nMission Track | Missional Hospitality, Led by Rev. Herb Codington, Rev. Ray Jones, Lewis and Elsbeth Codington, and Elizabeth Codington, RN\n\nThe importance of the biblical practice of hospitality is being rediscovered in our day. The New Testament word literally means \"loving the stranger\" which gives us its missional component. Noted author and Christian leader Henri Nouwen has said, \"If there is any concept worth restoring to its original depth and evocative potential, it is the concept of hospitality. It is one of the richest biblical terms that can deepen and broaden our insight in our relationships to our fellow human beings.\" We will have several missionaries who have served in other cultures help us unpack this rich biblical concept.\n\nSpiritual Formation Track | Nine Spiritual Styles: Understanding and Caring for God-Given Diversity (begins Monday 9 am and a Sunday night arrival is suggested), Led by Rev. Dr. Martha Friz Langer and the Rev. Dr. Mark Friz\n\nBeing created in the image of God, each of us is longing to connect with God in a way which is natural, balanced and fulfilling. Just as we each have our food, music, and other entertainment preferences, we each have a natural, God-given \"antenna\" by which we most easily tune into God.\n\nSurprisingly, most of us are clueless to our own style of spirituality, much less the style of those around us. We tend to find ourselves \"tuned\" into whatever is being offered by our local church or denomination, and never even consider the possibility of being able to receive and express our faith according to our God-Given style. In addition, most local churches continue traditions and styles which may or may not be understanding or caring for their congregational needs.\n\nIn this track, we will explore the Nine Spiritual Styles identified by Christian Schwarz in his book The 3 Colors of Your Spirituality. We will then experience spiritual practices which minister and care for each style. We hope this track will expand the understanding of congregational leaders in identifying the differing spiritual styles within their congregations, and then provide a more inclusive and balanced expression of ways within worship and programming to connect with God.\n\nRetreat Track\n\nMany people come to Montreat’s Wee Kirk Conference simply to enjoy the fellowship of other believers in the beauty of Montreat. To encourage this, we have created a special “retreat track” that includes all the worship and plenary presentations with abundant time for prayer, recreation, fellowship, and spiritual renewal."
