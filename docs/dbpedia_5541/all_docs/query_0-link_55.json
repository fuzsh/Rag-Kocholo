        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nWhom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: Whereunto I also labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in me mightily. Colossians 1:28-29\n\nThis Book of Worship, Faith, and Practice is a small attempt to help Christians understand the foundations, reasons, and applications of our Worship of the Lord Jesus Christ. The first section entitled Worship has a collection of examples of the liturgies of our various services here at Christ Church. Because we believe that we are only looking through a glass dimly, the reader needs to understand that as our Spiritual lives mature, our worship will also mature. This means that from time to time these liturgies will change and develop as they reflect that reformation.\n\nThe second section, called Confession of Faith, includes information that was previously included in our church constitution. The Christian faith does not change, God is eternal, but our understanding of that faith does change. Consequently, we removed the confessional section from the constitution so that as our faith grows, our statement of that faith can also change and mature. This section includes our current thought on confessional standards, what we believe about the governments God has given us, and a copy of the Westminster Confession of Faith with our various exceptions noted. Also, included in this section is a copy of the Christ Church Constitution.\n\nThe third section includes our Elder Protocols. This is a collection of procedures and practices that we use to govern Christ Church in a consistent and conscientious manner. You will note when you read the Preamble that our focus is on serving, not “ruling over.” This means that these protocols are not set in stone. Rather their purpose is to help us to remember what went before and also to aid us in gaining wisdom for the future. You will find information on calling and removing the various church officers, information on sister church relations, an assortment of membership information, and many other practical church procedure.\n\nPosition Papers is our last section. These papers are intended to help to explain many of the things we have and are doing here at Christ Church. These papers include, for example, why we are called Christ Church, our view and philosophy of worship music, why we use leavened bread in the Lord’s Supper, etc.\n\nWORSHIP\n\nLORD'S DAY SERVICE\n\n– ANNOUNCEMENTS & MEDITATION –\n\n– CALL TO WORSHIP –\n\n+ ADORATION\n\nMinister: Grace, mercy, and peace to you, from God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.\n\nCongregation: And also to you.\n\nSCRIPTURE\n\nHab. 3:18,19\n\nMinister: Lift up your hearts!\n\nCongregation: We lift them up to the Lord!\n\n+ PRAYER\n\n+ HYMN\n\nRejoice, the Lord is King………………………………………………………………………326\n\n– CONFESSION –\n\nEXHORTATION PSALM\n\nChide Me, O Lord, No Longer…………………………………………………………………8\n\nCONFESSION OF SIN\n\nCongregation is invited to kneel if able\n\nHab. 3:12,16\n\n+ ASSURANCE OF PARDON\n\nProv. 12:28\n\nMinister: Your sins are forgiven through Christ.\n\nCongregation: Thanks be to God!\n\n+ CONFESSION OF FAITH: APOSTLES CREED\n\nMinister: Christian, what do you believe?\n\nCongregation: I believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, our Lord.

On the third day He rose again from the dead, ascended into Heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence He will come to judge the living and the dead.

We warmly invite to the Lord’s table all those who are baptized disciples of Jesus Christ, under the authority of Christ and His body, the Church. By eating the bread and drinking the wine with us as a visitor, you are acknowledging that you are a sinner, without hope except in the sovereign mercy of God, and that you are trusting in Jesus Christ alone for salvation. You also acknowledge to the elders of this congregation that you are in covenant with God, being active in a congregation which is covenantally bound to the triune God through Word and sacrament. If you have any doubt about your participation, please speak to the elders before or after the service.\n\nHOLY FRIDAY SERVICE\n\nHOLY FRIDAY SERVICE\n\nPrelude\n\nCall to Worship\n\nInvocation\n\nFirst Lesson: Betrayal—John 13:12–30\n\nHe that eateth my bread lifted up his heel against me.\n\nAh, Holy Jesus, How Hast Thou Offended\n\nSecond Lesson: Rejection—John 15:18–27\n\nThey hated Me without a cause.\n\nStricken, Smitten, and Afflicted\n\nThird Lesson: Trial—John 18:28–19:15\n\nAway with Him, away with Him.

Baptism represents and seals our union with Christ (Rom 6:lff ), the outpouring of the Holy Spirit ( Jn 1:33), and resulting regeneration, adoption, and cleansing from sin (Tit 3:5-6). By baptism we are initiated into the covenant community (Acts 2:41; 1 Cor 12:13), and made members of the body of Christ.\n\nPRAYER FOR BLESSING\n\nLet us pray together, and ask that God would honor his name here today in this covenant baptism, and that He would pour out great kindness upon us by showing us His covenant (Ps. 25:14).\n\nBAPTISMAL HYMN\n\n“O Come, Let Us Sing Unto the Lord” (CC 126)\n\nEXHORTATION FROM THE WORD\n\n“Receiving Children”\n\nCOVENANT VOWS FOR THE PARENTS\n\nThe minister asks the parents the following:\n\n1. Do you acknowledge your child’s need of the cleansing blood of Jesus Christ, and the re-\n\nnewing grace of the Holy Spirit?\n\n2. Do you trust in God’s covenant promises in his/her behalf, and do you look in faith to the\n\nLord Jesus Christ for his/her salvation, as you do for your own?\n\n3. Do you now unreservedly dedicate your child to God, and promise, in humble reliance\n\nupon divine grace, that you will endeavor to set before him/her a godly example, that you will pray with and for him/her, that you will teach him/her the doctrines of our holy faith, and that you will strive, by all the means of God’s appointment, to bring him/her up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord?\n\n4. On the basis of your faith expressed here, do you resolve by the grace of God, not only to bring him/her up as your natural son/daughter, but also, from this day forward, to consider him/ her as your brother/sister in the Lord, as a joint heir of all God’s covenant blessings?\n\nCOVENANT VOWS FOR THE CONGREGATION\n\nThe minister asks the congregation the following:\n\n“Do you as a congregation undertake the responsibility of a covenant community in assisting\n\nthese parents in the Christian nurture of this child?” Please signify your response by saying amen.\n\nBAPTISM\n\nThe minister shall ask the parents the following: What is the Christian name of this child?\n\nOn the basis of this profession of covenant faith, I baptize _________ in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.\n\nBENEDICTION FOR THE CHILD\n\nThe blessing of God Almighty, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, descend upon you, and dwell in your heart forever. Amen.\n\nCHARGE TO THE CONGREGATION\n\nThis child is now received into Christ’s Church. You the people of this congregation, in receiving this child, promise with God’s help to be his/her people to the end that he/she may faithfully walk with Christ all his/her days, and come at last to His eternal kingdom. Jesus said, Whosoever shall receive one such little child in My name receives Me.\n\nCONGREGATIONAL CHARGE\n\nThe congregation stands and speaks together to the child.\n\n“Little child, for you Jesus Christ came to this earth, struggled and suffered; for your sake He crossed Gethsemane and went through the darkness of Calvary; for your sake He cried: ‘It is finished’; for your sake He died and for your sake He overcame death; indeed for your sake, little child, and you—still— know nothing of it. And thus the word of the apostle is confirmed: ‘We love God, for He loved us first’”.\n\nTaken from an old French Reformed Baptism Rite\n\nDOXOLOGY\n\nCOVENANT BAPTISM AND BAPTISM ON PROFESSION OF FAITH\n\nMEDITATION\n\nThe ordinance of baptism is administered by the church in obedience to the command of Christ that the nations should be converted, baptized, and taught all that Christ has commanded (Mt 28:19-20).

The individual or head of household will be asked the following questions:\n\nA. “Have you acknowledged yourself to be a sinner in need of the cleansing blood of Jesus Christ, and have you believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, trusting and resting upon Him alone as He is offered in the gospel?”\n\nB. “Have you been baptized in accordance with His Word?”\n\nC. “Are you resolute, in humble reliance upon the help of God, in endeavoring daily to live as becomes followers of Christ?”\n\nD. “Do you promise to support this church in its worship and work? Do you promise to submit yourself to the government and discipline of this church, pursuing its purity and peace?” When the questions are addressed to the head of a household, he will also be asked if he is speaking on behalf of the household.\n\n2. When an affirmative answer has been given, the members of the congregation will be asked to whether they will commit themselves to the new members in a mutually covenantal. They will signify their agreement with a corporate “Amen.”\n\n3. One of the elders will offer a prayer of thanksgiving to God.\n\nBOOK OF CONFESSIONS\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOur various creeds and confessions express an important part of who we are as a church. We confess and believe together with our fathers in the faith and our brothers throughout the world. We are baptized into their company as members of the same body, the Church of our Lord Jesus Christ, and with them we eat of a common loaf and drink from a common cup. Their creed is our creed, even as their life is our life—one Lord, one faith, and one baptism. The elders of Christ Church therefore subscribe to these creeds and confessions, holding them to be a faithful witness to what the Scriptures teach, and as a means of identifying with the broader Church.\n\nWe hold to the ancient creeds as defining the faith once delivered to the saints, and we hold that no one rejecting the truths proclaimed in these creeds can be right with God.\n\nWe hold to the distinctive truths of our reformational confessions, knowing that many faithful christians have differed with portions of these confessions. We confess\n\nour view that these confessions faithfully represent of Scripture, but we do this, not as a means of dividing with Christians who differ, but rather to make a faithful and charitable testimony of what we believe Scripture to teach. These confessions represent the understanding of our church officers, and are not binding on the members of our church.\n\nIn this spirit, we therefore commend the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion as an faithful and historic testimony of the martyr church, but we reject any use of that confession as a museum piece, where the form of religion is kept but not the power of it.\n\nWe therefore approve the Three Forms of Unity for use in liturgy and catechesis, and heartily commend their pastoral approach. We reject any unfaithful spirit that would take this more organic and pastoral approach to confession as an excuse to make room for an unbelieving spirit that rejects any pointed accountability.\n\nWe therefore approve the Westminster Confession and Shorter Catechism for use in doctrinal accountability for officers of the church.To preserve clear accountability for our officers, our confessions should be construed to harmonize wherever possible, but in areas where they cannot be harmonized we defer to language of the Westminster Confession of Faith. For this reason, we declare our exceptions to that confession only. We reject any approach to Westminster that degrades into litigiousness, fractiousness, sectarianism, or gnat-strangling.\n\nAPOSTLES' CREED\n\nI believe in God the Father Almighty; Maker of heaven and earth, and in Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, our Lord.\n\nHe was conceived by the Holy Ghost, and born of the virgin, Mary. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.\n\nHe descended into Hades.\n\nOn the third day He rose again, from the dead, ascended into Heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence He will come to judge the living and the dead.\n\nI believe in the Holy Ghost, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.\n\nNICENE CREED\n\nI believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.\n\nAnd in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God; begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made.\n\nWho, for us men for our salvation, came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered and was buried; and the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures; and ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again, with glory, to judge the quick and the dead; whose kingdom shall have no end.\n\nAnd I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of Life; who proceeds from the Father and the Son; who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; who spoke by the prophets.\n\nAnd I believe one holy catholic and apostolic Church. I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.\n\nTHE DEFINITION OF CHALCEDON\n\nTherefore, following the holy fathers, we all with one accord teach men to acknowledge one and the same Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, at once complete in Godhead and complete in manhood, truly God and truly man, consisting also of a reasonable soul and body; of one substance with the Father as regards his Godhead, and at the same time of one substance with us as regards his manhood; like us in all respects, apart from sin; as regards his Godhead, begotten of the Father before the ages, but yet as regards his manhood begotten, for us men and for our salvation, of Mary the Virgin, the God-bearer; one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, Only-begotten, recognized in two natures, without confusion, without change, without division, without separation; the distinction of natures being in no way annulled by the union, but rather the characteristics of each nature being preserved and coming together to form one person and subsistence, not as parted or separated into two persons, but one and the same Son and Only-begotten God the Word, Lord Jesus Christ; even as the prophets from earliest times spoke of him, and our Lord Jesus Christ himself taught us, and the creed of the fathers has handed down to us.\n\nTHE ATHANASIAN CREED\n\nWhosoever will be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the Catholic Faith.\n\nWhich Faith except everyone do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly.\n\nAnd the Catholic Faith is this: That we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity,\n\nNeither confounding the Persons, nor dividing the Substance.\n\nFor there is one Person of the Father, another of the Son, and another of the Holy Spirit.\n\nBut the Godhead of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, is all one, the Glory equal, the Majesty co-eternal.\n\nSuch as the Father is, such is the Son, and such is the Holy Spirit.\n\nThe Father uncreated, the Son uncreated, and the Holy Spirit uncreated. The Father unlimited, the Son unlimited, and the Holy Spirit unlimited. The Father eternal, the Son eternal, and the Holy Spirit eternal.\n\nAnd yet they are not three eternals, but one eternal.\n\nAs also there are not three infinites, nor three uncreated, but one uncreated, and one infinites.\n\nSo likewise the Father is Almighty, the Son Almighty, and the Holy Spirit Almighty. And yet they are not three Almighties, but one Almighty.\n\nSo the Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God.\n\nAnd yet they are not three Gods, but one God.\n\nSo likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord, and the Holy Spirit Lord.\n\nAnd yet not three Lords, but one Lord.\n\nFor like as we are compelled by the Christian verity: to acknowledge every Person by himself to be both God and Lord,\n\nSo are we forbidden by the catholic Religion, to say, There are three Gods, or three Lords.\n\nThe Father is made of none, neither created, nor begotten.\n\nThe Son is of the Father alone, not made, nor created, but begotten.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is of the Father and of the Son, neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but proceeding.\n\nSo there is one Father, not three Fathers; one Son, not three Sons; one Holy Spirit, not three Holy Spirits.\n\nAnd in this Trinity none is before, or after; none is greater, or less than another;\n\nBut the whole three Persons are co-eternal together and co-equal.\n\nSo that in all things, as is aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped.\n\nHe therefore that will be saved must thus think of the Trinity.\n\nFurthermore, it is necessary to everlasting salvation that he also believe rightly the Incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ. For the right Faith is, that we believe and confess, that our Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, is God and Man;\n\nGod, of the Substance of the Father, begotten before the worlds; and Man, of the Substance of his Mother, born in the world;\n\nPerfect God and perfect Man, of a reasonable soul and human flesh subsisting;\n\nEqual to the Father, as touching his Godhead; and inferior to the Father, as touching his Manhood.\n\nWho although he is God and Man, yet he is not two, but one Christ;\n\nOne, not by conversion of the Godhead into flesh, but by taking assumption of the Manhood into God;\n\nOne altogether, not by confusion of Substance, but by unity of Person.\n\nFor as the reasonable soul and flesh is one man, so God and Man is one Christ;\n\nWho suffered for our salvation, descended into Hades, rose again the third day from the dead.\n\nHe ascended into heaven, he sitteth on the right hand of the Father, God Almighty, From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead.\n\nAt whose coming all men shall rise again with their bodies\n\nAnd shall give account for their own works.\n\nAnd they that have done good shall go into life everlasting, and they that have done evil into everlasting fire.\n\nThis is the catholic Faith, which except a man believe faithfully, he cannot be saved.\n\n39 ARTICLES OF RELIGION\n\nI. Of faith in the Holy Trinity.\n\nThere is but one living and true God, everlasting, without body, parts, or passions; of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness; the maker and preserver of all things both visible and invisible. And in unity of this Godhead there be three Persons, of one substance, power, and eternity; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.\n\nII. Of the Word, or Son of God, which was made very man.\n\nThe Son, which is the Word of the Father, begotten from everlasting of the Father, the very and eternal God, and of one substance with the Father, took man’s nature in the womb of the blessed Virgin, of her substance: so that two whole and perfect natures, that is to say, the Godhead and manhood, were joined together in one person, never to be divided, whereof is one Christ, very God and very man, who truly suffered, was crucified, dead, and buried, to reconcile His Father to us, and to be a sacrifice, not only for original guilt, but also for all actual sins of men.\n\nIII. Of the going down of Christ into Hell.\n\nChrist died for us, and was buried, so also is it to be believed that He went down into Hell.\n\nIV. Of the Resurrection of Christ.\n\nChrist did truly rise again from death, and took again His body, with flesh, bones, and all things appertaining to the perfection of man’s nature, wherefore He ascended into heaven, and there sitteth until He return to judge all men at the last day.\n\nV. Of the Holy Ghost.\n\nThe Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son, is of one substance, majesty, and glory with the Father and the Son, very and eternal God.\n\nVI. Of the sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for Salvation.\n\nHoly Scriptures containeth all things necessary to salvation: so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that it should be believed as an article of the faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation. In the name of Holy Scripture, we do understand those Canonical books of the Old and New testament, of whose authority was never any doubt in the Church.\n\nOf the Names and Number of the Canonical Books\n\nGenesis\n\nExodus\n\nLeviticus\n\nNumbers\n\nDeuteronomy\n\nJoshua\n\nJudges\n\nRuth\n\nThe First Book of Samuel\n\nThe Second Book of Samuel\n\nThe First Book of Kings\n\nThe Second Book of Kings\n\nThe First Book of Chronicles\n\nThe Second Book of Chronicles\n\nThe First Book of Esdras\n\nThe Second Book of Esdras\n\nThe Book of Esther\n\nThe Book of Job\n\nThe Psalms\n\nThe Proverbs\n\nEcclesiastes or Preacher\n\nCantica, or Songs of Solomon\n\nFour Prophets the greater\n\nTwelve Prophets the less\n\nAnd the other Books (as Hierome saith) the Church doth read for example of life and instruction of manners; but yet doth it not apply them to establish any doctrine; such are these following:\n\nThe Third Book of Esdras\n\nThe Fourth Book of Esdras\n\nThe Book of Tobias\n\nThe Book of Judith\n\nThe rest of the Book of Esther\n\nThe Book of Wisdom\n\nJesus the Son of Sirach\n\nBaruch the Prophet\n\nThe Song of the Three Children\n\nThe Story of Susanna\n\nOf Bel and the Dragon\n\nThe Prayer of Manasses\n\nThe First Book of Maccabees\n\nThe Second Book of Maccabees\n\nAll the Books of the New Testament, as they are commonly received, we do receive, and account them Canonical.\n\nVII. Of the Old Testament.\n\nThe Old Testament is not contrary to the New; for both in the Old and New Testament everlasting life is offered to mankind by Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and man, being both God and man. Wherefore there are not to be heard which feign that the old fathers did look only for transitory promises. Although the law given from God by Moses, as touching ceremonies and rites, do not bind Christian men, nor the civil precepts thereof ought of necessity to be received in any commonwealth; yet, notwithstanding, no Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of the commandments which are called moral.\n\nVIII. Of the Three Creeds.\n\nThe three Creeds, Nicene Creed, Athanasius’ Creed, and that which is commonly called the Apostles’ Creed, ought thoroughly to be received and believed; for they may be proved by most certain warrants of Holy Scripture.\n\nIX. Of Original or Birth Sin.\n\nOriginal sin standeth not in the following of Adam (as the Pelagians do vainly talk), but it is the fault and corruption of the nature of every man that naturally is engendered of the offspring of Adam, whereby man is very far gone from original righteousness, and is of his own nature inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth always contrary to the spirit; and therefore in every person born into this world, it deserveth God’s wrath and damnation. And this infection of nature doth remain, yea, in them that are regenerated, whereby the lust of the flesh, called in Greek phronema sarkos (which some do expound the wisdom, some , some the affection, some the desire of the flesh), is not subject to the law of God. And although there is no condemnation for them that believe and are baptized, yet the Apostle doth confess that concupiscence and lust hath itself the nature of sin.\n\nX. Of Free Will.\n\nThe condition of man after the fall of Adam is such, that he cannot turn and prepare himself, by his own natural strength and good works, to faith and calling upon God. Wherefore we have no power to do good works pleasant and acceptable to God, without the grace of God by Christ preventing us that we may have a good will, and working with us when we have that good will.\n\nXI. Of the Justification of Man.\n\nWe are accounted righteous before God, only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by faith, and not for our own works or deservings. Wherefore that we are justified by faith only is a most wholesome doctrine, and very full of comfort; as more largely is expressed in the Homily of Justification.\n\nXII. Of Good Works.\n\nAlbeit that good works, which are the fruits of faith and follow after justification, cannot put away our sins and endure the severity of God’s judgement, yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ, and do spring out necessarily of a true and lively faith, insomuch that by them a lively faith may be as evidently known as a tree discerned by the fruit.\n\nXIII. Of Works before Justification.\n\nWorks done before the grace of Christ and the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, are not pleasant to God, forasmuch as they spring not of faith in Jesus Christ, neither do they make men meet to receive grace, or (as the School authors say) deserve grace of congruity: yea, rather for that they are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt not but they have the nature of sin.\n\nXIV. Of Works of Supererogation.\n\nVoluntary works besides, over and above, God’s commandments which they call Works of Supererogation, cannot be taught without arrogancy and impiety. For by them men do declare that they do not only render unto God as much as they are bound to do, but that they do more for His sake than of bounden duty is required: Whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye have done all that are commanded to do, say, We be unprofitable servants.\n\nXV. Of Christ alone without Sin.\n\nChrist in the truth of our nature was made like unto us in all things, sin only except, from which He was clearly void, both in His flesh and in His spirit. He came to be the lamb without spot, Who by sacrifice of Himself once made, should take away the sins of the world: and sin, as S. John saith, was not in Him. But all we the rest, although baptized and born again in Christ, yet offend in many things: and if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\n\nXVI. Of Sin after Baptism.\n\nNot every deadly sin willingly committed after Baptism is sin against the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore the grant of repentance is not to be denied to such as fall into sin after Baptism. After we have received the Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given and fall into sin, and by the grace of God we may arise again and amend our lives. And therefore they are to be condemned, which say they can no more sin as long as they live here, or deny the place of forgiveness to such as truly repent.\n\nXVII. Of Predestination and Election.\n\nPredestination to life is the everlasting purpose of God, whereby, before the foundations of the world were laid, He hath constantly decreed by His counsel secret to us, to deliver from curse and damnation those whom He hath chosen in Christ out of mankind, and to bring them by Christ to everlasting salvation as vessels made to honour. Wherefore they which be endued with so excellent a benefit of God be called according to God’s purpose by His Spirit working in due season; they through grace obey the calling; they be justified freely; they be made sons of God by adoption; they be made like the image of His only-begotten Son Jesus Christ; they walk religiously in good works; and at length by God’s mercy they attain to everlasting felicity.\n\nAs the godly consideration of Predestination and our Election in Christ is full of sweet, pleasant, and unspeakable comfort to godly persons and such as feeling in themselves the working of the Spirit of Christ, mortifying the works of the flesh and their earthly members and drawing up their mind to high and heavenly things, as well because it doth greatly establish and confirm their faith of eternal salvation to be enjoyed through Christ, as because it doth fervently kindle their love towards God: so for curious and carnal persons, lacking the Spirit of Christ, to have continually before their eyes the sentence of God’s Predestination is a most dangerous downfall, whereby the devil doth thrust them either into desperation or into wretchlessness of most unclean living no less perilous than desperation.\n\nFurthermore, we must receive God’s promises in such wise as they be generally set forth in Holy Scripture; and in our doings that will of God is to be followed which we have expressly declared unto us in the word of God.\n\nXVIII. Of obtaining eternal salvation only by the name of Christ.\n\nThey also are to be had accursed that presume to say that every man shall be saved by the law or sect which he professeth, so that he be diligent to frame his life according to that law and the light of nature. For Holy Scripture doth set out to us only the name of Jesus Christ, whereby men must be saved.\n\nXIX. Of the Church.\n\nThe visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men, in the which the pure word of God is preached and the sacraments be duly ministered according to Christ’s ordinance in all those things that of necessity are requisite to the same. As the Church of Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch have erred: so also the Church of Rome hath erred, not only in their living and manner of ceremonies, but also in matters of faith.\n\nXX. Of the Authority of the Church.\n\nThe Church hath power to decree rites or ceremonies and authority in controversies of faith; and yet it is not lawful for the Church to ordain anything contrary to God’s word written, neither may it so expound one place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another. Wherefore, although the Church be a witness and a keeper of Holy Writ: yet, as it ought not to decree anything against the same, so besides the same ought it not to enforce anything to be believed for necessity of salvation.\n\nXXI. Of the authority of General Councils.\n\nGeneral Councils may not be gathered together without the commandment and will of princes. And when they be gathered together, forasmuch as they be an assembly of men, whereof all be not governed with the Spirit and word of God, they may err and sometime have erred, even in things pertaining to God. Wherefore things ordained by them as necessary to salvation have neither strength nor authority, unless it may be declared that they be taken out of Holy Scripture.\n\nXXII. Of Purgatory.\n\nThe Romish doctrine concerning Purgatory, Pardons, worshipping and adoration as well of Images as of Relics, and also Invocation of Saint, is a fond thing vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of Scripture; but rather repugnant to the word of God.\n\nXXIII. Of Ministering in the Congregation.\n\nIt is not lawful for any man to take upon him the office of public preaching or ministering the sacraments in the congregation, before he be lawfully called and sent to execute the same. And those we ought to judge lawfully called and sent, which be chosen and called to this work by men who have public authority given unto them in the congregation to call and send ministers into the Lord’s vineyard.\n\nXXIV. Of speaking in the Congregation in such a tongue as the people understandeth.\n\nIt is a thing plainly repugnant to the word of God and the custom of the primitive Church, to have public prayer in the Church, or to minister the sacraments in a tongue not understanded of the people.\n\nXXV. Of the Sacraments.\n\nSacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or tokens of Christian men’s profession, but rather they be certain sure witnesses and effectual signs of grace and God’s good will towards us, by the which He doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also strengthen and confirm, our faith in Him.\n\nThere are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel, that is to say, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord.\n\nThose five commonly called Sacraments, that is to say, Confirmation, Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and Extreme Unction, are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel, being such as have grown partly of the corrupt following of the Apostles, partly are states of life allowed in the Scriptures; but yet have not the like nature of Sacraments with Baptism and the Lord’s Supper, for that they have not any visible sign or ceremony ordained of God.\n\nThe Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon or to be carried about, but that we should duly use them. And in such only as worthily receive the same, have they a wholesome effect or operation: but they that receive them unworthily, purchase to themselves damnation, as Saint Paul saith.\n\nXXVI. Of the unworthiness of the Ministers, which hinders not the effect of the Sacraments.\n\nAlthough in the visible Church the evil be ever mingled with the good, and sometime the evil have chief authority in the ministration of the word and sacraments; yet forasmuch as they do not the same in their own name, but in Christ’s, and do minister by His commission and authority, we may use their ministry both in hearing the word of God and in the receiving of the sacraments. Neither is the effect of Christ’s ordinance taken away by their wickedness, nor the grace of God’s gifts diminished from such as by faith and rightly do receive the sacraments ministered unto them, which be effectual because of Christ’s institution and promise, although they be ministered by evil men.\n\nNevertheless it appertaineth to the discipline of the Church that inquiry be made of evil ministers, and that they be accused by those that have knowledge of their offences; and finally, being found guilty by just judgement, be deposed.\n\nXXVII. Of Baptism.\n\nBaptism is not only a sign of profession and mark of difference whereby Christian men are discerned from other that be not christened, but is also a sign of regeneration or new birth, whereby, as by an instrument, they that receive baptism rightly are grafted into the Church; the promises of the forgiveness of sin, and of our adoption to be the sons of God, by the Holy Ghost are visibly signed and sealed; faith is confirmed, and grace increased by virtue of prayer unto God. The baptism of young children is in any wise to be retained in the Church as most agreeable with the institution of Christ.\n\nXXVIII. Of the Lord’s Supper.\n\nThe Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that Christians ought to have among themselves, one to another, but rather it is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ’s death: insomuch that to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the bread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ, and likewise the cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ.\n\nTransubstantiation (or the change of the substance of bread and wine) in the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by Holy Writ, but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and hath given occasion to many superstitions.\n\nThe body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper, only after an heavenly and spiritual manner. And the mean whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is Faith.\n\nThe Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper was not by Christ’s ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshipped.\n\nXXIX. Of the wicked which do not eat the body of Christ, in the use of the Lord’s Supper.\n\nThe wicked and such as be void of a lively faith, although they do carnally and visibly press with their teeth (as S. Augustine saith) the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, yet in no wise are they partakers of Christ, but rather to their condemnation do eat and drink the sign or sacrament of so great a thing.\n\nXXX. Of Both Kinds.\n\nThe Cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the lay people; for both parts of the Lord’s sacrament, by Christ’s ordinance and commandment, ought to be ministered to all Christian men alike.\n\nXXXI. Of the one oblation of Christ finished upon the Cross.\n\nThe offering of Christ once made is the perfect redemption, propitiation, and satisfaction for all the sins of the whole world, both original and actual, and there is none other satisfaction for sin but that alone. Wherefore the sacrifices of Masses, in the which it was commonly said that the priests did offer Christ for the quick and the dead to have remission of pain or guilt, were blasphemous fables and dangerous deceits.\n\nXXXII. Of the Marriage of Priests.\n\nBishops, Priests, and Deacons are not commanded by God’s laws either to vow the estate of single life or to abstain from marriage. Therefore it is lawful also for them, as for all other Christian men, to marry at their own discretion, as they shall judge the same to serve better to godliness.\n\nXXXIII. Of Excommunicated Persons, how they are to be avoided.\n\nThat persons which by open denunciation of the Church is rightly cut off from the unity of the Church and excommunicated, ought to be taken of the whole multitude of the faithful as an heathen and publican, until he be openly reconciled by penance and received into the Church by a judge that hath authority thereto.\n\nXXXIV. Of the Traditions of the Church.\n\nIt is not necessary that traditions and ceremonies be in all places one or utterly alike; for at all times they have been diverse, and may be changed according to the diversity of countries, times, and men’s manners, so that nothing be ordained against God’s word. Whosoever through his private judgement willingly and purposely doth openly break the traditions and ceremonies of the Church which be not repugnant to the word of God, and be ordained and approved by common authority, ought to be rebuked openly that other may fear to do the like, as he that offendeth against common order of the Church, and hurteth the authority of the magistrate, and woundeth the conscience of the weak brethren.\n\nEvery particular or national Church hath authority to ordain, change, and abolish ceremonies or rites of the Church ordained only by man’s authority, so that all things be done to edifying.\n\nXXXV. Of Homilies.\n\nThe second Book of Homilies, the several titles whereof we have joined under this Article, doth contain a godly and wholesome doctrine and necessary for these times, as doth the former Book of Homilies which were set forth in the time of Edward the Sixth: and therefore we judge them to be read in Churches by the ministers diligently and distinctly, that they may be understanded of the people.\n\nOf the Names of the Homilies.\n\n1. Of the right Use of the Church.\n\n2. Against peril of Idolatry.\n\n3. Of the repairing and keeping clean of Churches.\n\n4. Of good Works: first of Fasting.\n\n5. Against Gluttony and Drunkenness.\n\n6. Against Excess of Apparel.\n\n7. Of Prayer.\n\n8. Of the Place and Time of Prayer.\n\n9. That Common Prayers and Sacraments ought to be ministered in a known tongue.\n\n10. Of the reverend estimation of God’s Word.\n\n11. Of Alms-doing.\n\n12. Of the Nativity of Christ.\n\n13. Of the Passion of Christ.\n\n14. Of the Resurrection of Christ.\n\n15. Of the worthy receiving of the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ.\n\n16. Of the Gifts of the Holy Ghost.\n\n17. For the Rogation-days.\n\n18. Of the state of Matrimony.\n\n19. Of Repentance.\n\n20. Against Idleness.\n\n21. Against Rebellion\n\nXXXVI. Of Consecration of Bishops and Ministers.\n\nThe Book of Consecration of Archbishops and Bishops and ordering of Priests and Deacons, lately set forth in the time of Edward the Sixth and confirmed at the same time by authority of Parliament, doth contain all things necessary to such consecration and ordering; neither hath it anything that of itself is superstitious or ungodly. And therefore whosoever are consecrate or ordered according to the rites of that book, since the second year of King Edward unto this time, or hereafter shall be consecrated or ordered according to the same rites, we decree all such to be rightly, orderly, and lawfully consecrated or ordered.\n\nXXXVII. Of the Civil Magistrates.\n\nThe Queen’s Majesty hath the chief power in this realm of England and other her dominions, unto whom the chief government of all estates of this realm, whether they be ecclesiastical or civil, in all causes doth appertain, and is not nor ought to be subject to any foreign jurisdiction.\n\nWhere we attribute to the Queen’s Majesty the chief government, by which titles we understand the minds of some slanderous folks to be offended, we give not to our princes the ministering either of God’s word or of sacraments, the which thing the Injunctions also lately set forth by Elizabeth our Queen doth most plainly testify: but that only prerogative which we see to have been given always to all godly princes in Holy Scriptures by God himself, that is, that they should rule all estates and degrees committed to their charge by God, whether they be ecclesiastical or temporal, and restrain with the civil sword the stubborn and evil-doers. The Bishop of Rome hath no jurisdiction in this realm of England.\n\nThe Laws of the Realm may punish Christian men with death for heinous and grievous offences.\n\nIt is lawful for Christian men at the commandment of the Magistrate to wear weapons and serve in the wars.\n\nXXXVIII. Of Christian men’s goods which are not common.\n\nThe riches and goods of Christians are not common, as touching the right, title, and possession of the same, as certain Anabaptists do falsely boast; notwithstanding every man ought of such things as he possesseth liberally to give alms to the poor, according to his ability.\n\nXXXIX. Of a Christian man’s Oath.\n\nAs we confess that vain and rash swearing is forbidden Christian men by our Lord Jesus Christ, so we judge that Christian religion doth not prohibit but that a man may swear when the magistrate requireth in a cause of faith and charity, so it be done according to the Prophet’s teaching in justice, judgement, and truth.\n\nThe Ratification.\n\nThis Book of Articles before rehearsed, is again approved, and allowed to be holden and executed within the Realm, by the assent and consent of our Sovereign Lady ELIZABETH, by the grace of God, of England, France, and Ireland, Queen, Defender of the Faith, &c. Which Articles were deliberately read, and confirmed again by the subscription of the hands of the Archbishop and Bishops of the Upper-house, and by the subscription of the whole Clergy of the Nether-house in their Convocation, in the Year of our Lord 1571.\n\nTHE BELGIC CONFESSION\n\nArticle 1: The Only God\n\nWe all believe in our hearts and confess with our mouths that there is a single and simple spiritual being, whom we call God—eternal, incomprehensible, invisible, unchangeable, infinite, almighty; completely wise, just, and good, and the overflowing source of all good.\n\nArticle 2: The Means by Which We Know God\n\nWe know him by two means:\n\nFirst, by the creation, preservation, and government of the universe, since that universe is before our eyes like a beautiful book in which all creatures, great and small, are as letters to make us ponder the invisible things of God: his eternal power and his divinity, as the apostle Paul says in Romans 1:20.\n\nAll these things are enough to convict men and to leave them without excuse.\n\nSecond, he makes himself known to us more openly by his holy and divine Word, as much as we need in this life, for his glory and for the salvation of his own.\n\nArticle 3: The Written Word of God\n\nWe confess that this Word of God was not sent nor delivered by the will of men, but that holy men of God spoke, being moved by the Holy Spirit, as Peter says.\n\nAfterwards our God— because of the special care he has for us and our salvation— commanded his servants, the prophets and apostles, to commit this revealed Word to writing. He himself wrote with his own finger the two tables of the law.\n\nTherefore we call such writings holy and divine Scriptures.\n\nArticle 4: The Canonical Books\n\nWe include in the Holy Scripture the two volumes of the Old and New Testaments. They are canonical books with which there can be no quarrel at all.\n\nIn the church of God the list is as follows: In the Old Testament, the five books of Moses—Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy; the books of Joshua, Judges, and Ruth; the two books of Samuel, and two of Kings; the two books of Chronicles, called Paralipomenon; the first book of Ezra; Nehemiah, Esther, Job; the Psalms of David; the three books of Solomon—Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song; the four major prophets—Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel; and then the other twelve minor prophets—Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi.\n\nIn the New Testament, the four gospels—Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John; the Acts of the Apostles; the fourteen letters of Paul—to the Romans; the two letters to the Corinthians; to the Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians; the two letters to the Thessalonians; the two letters to Timothy; to Titus, Philemon, and to the Hebrews; the seven letters of the other apostles—one of James; two of Peter; three of John; one of Jude; and the Revelation of the apostle John.\n\nArticle 5: The Authority of Scripture\n\nWe receive all these books and these only as holy and canonical, for the regulating, founding, and establishing of our faith.\n\nAnd we believe without a doubt all things contained in them— not so much because the church receives and approves them as such but above all because the Holy Spirit testifies in our hearts that they are from God, and also because they prove themselves to be from God.\n\nFor even the blind themselves are able to see that the things predicted in them do happen.\n\nArticle 6: The Difference Between Canonical and Apocryphal Books\n\nWe distinguish between these holy books and the apocryphal ones, which are the third and fourth books of Esdras; the books of Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Jesus Sirach, Baruch; what was added to the Story of Esther; the Song of the Three Children in the Furnace; the Story of Susannah; the Story of Bell and the Dragon; the Prayer of Manasseh; and the two books of Maccabees.\n\nThe church may certainly read these books and learn from them as far as they agree with the canonical books. But they do not have such power and virtue that one could confirm from their testimony any point of faith or of the Christian religion. Much less can they detract from the authority of the other holy books.\n\nArticle 7: The Sufficiency of Scripture\n\nWe believe that this Holy Scripture contains the will of God completely and that everything one must believe to be saved is sufficiently taught in it. For since the entire manner of service which God requires of us is described in it at great length, no one—even an apostle or an angel from heaven, as Paul says—ought to teach other than what the Holy Scriptures have already taught us. For since it is forbidden to add to or subtract from the Word of God, this plainly demonstrates that the teaching is perfect and complete in all respects.\n\nTherefore we must not consider human writings—no matter how holy their authors may have been—equal to the divine writings; nor may we put custom, nor the majority, nor age, nor the passage of time or persons, nor councils, decrees, or official decisions above the truth of God, for truth is above everything else.\n\nFor all human beings are liars by nature and more vain than vanity itself.\n\nTherefore we reject with all our hearts everything that does not agree with this infallible rule, as we are taught to do by the apostles when they say, “Test the spirits to see if they are of God,” and also, “If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house.”\n\nArticle 8: The Trinity\n\nIn keeping with this truth and Word of God we believe in one God, who is one single essence, in whom there are three persons, really, truly, and eternally distinct according to their incommunicable properties—namely, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Father is the cause, origin, and source of all things, visible as well as invisible.\n\nThe Son is the Word, the Wisdom, and the image of the Father.\n\nThe Holy Spirit is the eternal power and might, proceeding from the Father and the Son.\n\nNevertheless, this distinction does not divide God into three, since Scripture teaches us that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit each has his own subsistence distinguished by characteristics—yet in such a way that these three persons are only one God.\n\nIt is evident then that the Father is not the Son and that the Son is not the Father, and that likewise the Holy Spirit is neither the Father nor the Son.\n\nNevertheless, these persons, thus distinct, are neither divided nor fused or mixed together.\n\nFor the Father did not take on flesh, nor did the Spirit, but only the Son.\n\nThe Father was never without his Son, nor without his Holy Spirit, since all these are equal from eternity, in one and the same essence.\n\nThere is neither a first nor a last, for all three are one in truth and power, in goodness and mercy.\n\nArticle 9: The Scriptural Witness on the Trinity\n\nAll these things we know from the testimonies of Holy Scripture as well as from the effects of the persons, especially from those we feel within ourselves.\n\nThe testimonies of the Holy Scriptures, which teach us to believe in this Holy Trinity, are written in many places of the Old Testament, which need not be enumerated but only chosen with discretion.\n\nIn the book of Genesis God says, “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness.” So “God created man in his own image”—indeed, “male and female he created them.” “Behold, man has become like one of us.”\n\nIt appears from this that there is a plurality of persons within the Deity, when he says, “Let us make man in our image”—and afterwards he indicates the unity when he says, “God created.”\n\nIt is true that he does not say here how many persons there are— but what is somewhat obscure to us in the Old Testament is very clear in the New.\n\nFor when our Lord was baptized in the Jordan, the voice of the Father was heard saying, “This is my dear Son”; the Son was seen in the water; and the Holy Spirit appeared in the form of a dove.\n\nSo, in the baptism of all believers this form was prescribed by Christ: “Baptize all people in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.”\n\nIn the Gospel according to Luke the angel Gabriel says to Mary, the mother of our Lord: “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; and therefore that holy one to be born of you shall be called the Son of God.”\n\nAnd in another place it says: “The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you.”\n\n“There are three who bear witness in heaven—the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit—and these three are one.”\n\nIn all these passages we are fully taught that there are three persons in the one and only divine essence. And although this doctrine surpasses human understanding, we nevertheless believe it now, through the Word, waiting to know and enjoy it fully in heaven.\n\nFurthermore, we must note the particular works and activities of these three persons in relation to us. The Father is called our Creator, by reason of his power. The Son is our Savior and Redeemer, by his blood. The Holy Spirit is our Sanctifier, by his living in our hearts. This doctrine of the holy Trinity has always been maintained in the true church, from the time of the apostles until the present, against Jews, Muslims, and certain false Christians and heretics, such as Marcion, Mani, Praxeas, Sabellius, Paul of Samosata, Arius, and others like them, who were rightly condemned by the holy fathers.\n\nAnd so, in this matter we willingly accept the three ecumenical creeds— the Apostles’, Nicene, and Athanasian—as well as what the ancient fathers decided in agreement with them.\n\nArticle 10: The Deity of Christ\n\nWe believe that Jesus Christ, according to his divine nature, is the only Son of God— eternally begotten, not made nor created, for then he would be a creature.\n\nHe is one in essence with the Father; coeternal; the exact image of the person of the Father and the “reflection of his glory,” being in all things like him.\n\nHe is the Son of God not only from the time he assumed our nature but from all eternity, as the following testimonies teach us when they are taken together.\n\nMoses says that God “created the world”; and John says that “all things were created by the Word,” which he calls God. The apostle says that “God made the world by his Son.” He also says that “God created all things by Jesus Christ.”\n\nAnd so it must follow that he who is called God, the Word, the Son, and Jesus Christ already existed when all things were created by him.\n\nTherefore the prophet Micah says that his origin is “from ancient times, from eternity.” And the apostle says that he has “neither beginning of days nor end of life.”\n\nSo then, he is the true eternal God, the Almighty, whom we invoke, worship, and serve.\n\nArticle 11: The Deity of the Holy Spirit\n\nWe believe and confess also that the Holy Spirit proceeds eternally from the Father and the Son—neither made, nor created, nor begotten, but only proceeding from the two of them. In regard to order, he is the third person of the Trinity—of one and the same essence, and majesty, and glory, with the Father and the Son.\n\nHe is true and eternal God, as the Holy Scriptures teach us.\n\nArticle 12: The Creation of All Things\n\nWe believe that the Father created heaven and earth and all other creatures from nothing, when it seemed good to him, by his Word— that is to say, by his Son.\n\nHe has given all creatures their being, form, and appearance, and their various functions for serving their Creator.\n\nEven now he also sustains and governs them all, according to his eternal providence, and by his infinite power, that they may serve man, in order that man may serve God.\n\nHe has also created the angels good, that they might be his messengers and serve his elect.\n\nSome of them have fallen from the excellence in which God created them into eternal perdition; and the others have persisted and remained in their original state, by the grace of God.\n\nThe devils and evil spirits are so corrupt that they are enemies of God and of everything good. They lie in wait for the church and every member of it like thieves, with all their power, to destroy and spoil everything by their deceptions.\n\nSo then, by their own wickedness they are condemned to everlasting damnation, daily awaiting their torments.\n\nFor that reason we detest the error of the Sadducees, who deny that there are spirits and angels, and also the error of the Manicheans, who say that the devils originated by themselves, being evil by nature, without having been corrupted.\n\nArticle 13: The Doctrine of God’s Providence\n\nWe believe that this good God, after he created all things, did not abandon them to chance or fortune but leads and governs them according to his holy will, in such a way that nothing happens in this world without his orderly arrangement.\n\nYet God is not the author of, nor can he be charged with, the sin that occurs. For his power and goodness are so great and incomprehensible that he arranges and does his work very well and justly even when the devils and wicked men act unjustly.\n\nWe do not wish to inquire with undue curiosity into what he does that surpasses human understanding and is beyond our ability to comprehend. But in all humility and reverence we adore the just judgments of God, which are hidden from us, being content to be Christ’s disciples, so as to learn only what he shows us in his Word, without going beyond those limits.\n\nThis doctrine gives us unspeakable comfort since it teaches us that nothing can happen to us by chance but only by the arrangement of our gracious heavenly Father. He watches over us with fatherly care, keeping all creatures under his control, so that not one of the hairs on our heads (for they are all numbered) nor even a little bird can fall to the ground without the will of our Father.\n\nIn this thought we rest, knowing that he holds in check the devils and all our enemies, who cannot hurt us without his permission and will.\n\nFor that reason we reject the damnable error of the Epicureans, who say that God involves himself in nothing and leaves everything to chance.\n\nArticle 14: The Creation and Fall of Man\n\nWe believe that God created man from the dust of the earth and made and formed him in his image and likeness—good, just, and holy; able by his own will to conform in all things to the will of God.\n\nBut when he was in honor he did not understand it and did not recognize his excellence. But he subjected himself willingly to sin and consequently to death and the curse, lending his ear to the word of the devil.\n\nFor he transgressed the commandment of life, which he had received, and by his sin he separated himself from God, who was his true life, having corrupted his entire nature.\n\nSo he made himself guilty and subject to physical and spiritual death, having become wicked, perverse, and corrupt in all his ways. He lost all his excellent gifts which he had received from God, and he retained none of them except for small traces which are enough to make him inexcusable.\n\nMoreover, all the light in us is turned to darkness, as the Scripture teaches us: “The light shone in the darkness, and the darkness did not receive it.” Here John calls men “darkness.”\n\nTherefore we reject everything taught to the contrary concerning man’s free will, since man is nothing but the slave of sin and cannot do a thing unless it is “given him from heaven.”\n\nFor who can boast of being able to do anything good by himself, since Christ says, “No one can come to me unless my Father who sent me draws him”?\n\nWho can glory in his own will when he understands that “the mind of the flesh is enmity against God”? Who can speak of his own knowledge in view of the fact that “the natural man does not understand the things of the Spirit of God”?\n\nIn short, who can produce a single thought, since he knows that we are “not able to think a thing” about ourselves, by ourselves, but that “our ability is from God”?\n\nAnd therefore, what the apostle says ought rightly to stand fixed and firm: “God works within us both to will and to do according to his good pleasure.”\n\nFor there is no understanding nor will conforming to God’s understanding and will apart from Christ’s involvement, as he teaches us when he says, “Without me you can do nothing.”\n\nArticle 15: The Doctrine of Original Sin\n\nWe believe that by the disobedience of Adam original sin has been spread through the whole human race.\n\nIt is a corruption of all nature—an inherited depravity which even infects small infants in their mother’s womb, and the root which produces in man every sort of sin. It is therefore so vile and enormous in God’s sight that it is enough to condemn the human race, and it is not abolished or wholly uprooted even by baptism, seeing that sin constantly boils forth as though from a contaminated spring.\n\nNevertheless, it is not imputed to God’s children for their condemnation but is forgiven by his grace and mercy— not to put them to sleep but so that the awareness of this corruption might often make believers groan as they long to be set free from the “body of this death.”\n\nTherefore we reject the error of the Pelagians who say that this sin is nothing else than a matter of imitation.\n\nArticle 16: The Doctrine of Election\n\nWe believe that—all Adam’s descendants having thus fallen into perdition and ruin by the sin of the first man—God showed himself to be as he is: merciful and just.\n\nHe is merciful in withdrawing and saving from this perdition those whom he, in his eternal and unchangeable counsel, has elected and chosen in Jesus Christ our Lord by his pure goodness, without any consideration of their works.\n\nHe is just in leaving the others in their ruin and fall into which they plunged themselves.\n\nArticle 17: The Recovery of Fallen Man\n\nWe believe that our good God, by his marvelous wisdom and goodness, seeing that man had plunged himself in this manner into both physical and spiritual death and made himself completely miserable, set out to find him, though man, trembling all over, was fleeing from him.\n\nAnd he comforted him, promising to give him his Son, “born of a woman,” to crush the head of the serpent, and to make him blessed.\n\nArticle 18: The Incarnation\n\nSo then we confess that God fulfilled the promise which he had made to the early fathers by the mouth of his holy prophets when he sent his only and eternal Son into the world at the time set by him.\n\nThe Son took the “form of a servant” and was made in the “likeness of man,” truly assuming a real human nature, with all its weaknesses, except for sin; being conceived in the womb of the blessed virgin Mary by the power of the Holy Spirit, without male participation.\n\nAnd he not only assumed human nature as far as the body is concerned but also a real human soul, in order that he might be a real human being. For since the soul had been lost as well as the body he had to assume them both to save them both together.\n\nTherefore we confess, against the heresy of the Anabaptists who deny that Christ assumed human flesh from his mother, that he “shared the very flesh and blood of children”; that he is “fruit of the loins of David” according to the flesh; “born of the seed of David” according to the flesh; “fruit of the womb of the virgin Mary”; “born of a woman”; “the seed of David”; “a shoot from the root of Jesse”; “the offspring of Judah,” having descended from the Jews according to the flesh; “from the seed of Abraham”—for he “assumed Abraham’s seed” and was “made like his brothers except for sin.”\n\nIn this way he is truly our Immanuel— that is: “God with us.”\n\nArticle 19: The Two Natures of Christ\n\nWe believe that by being thus conceived the person of the Son has been inseparably united and joined together with human nature, in such a way that there are not two Sons of God, nor two persons, but two natures united in a single person, with each nature retaining its own distinct properties.\n\nThus his divine nature has always remained uncreated, without beginning of days or end of life, filling heaven and earth.\n\nHis human nature has not lost its properties but continues to have those of a creature—it has a beginning of days; it is of a finite nature and retains all that belongs to a real body. And even though he, by his resurrection, gave it immortality, that nonetheless did not change the reality of his human nature; for our salvation and resurrection depend also on the reality of his body.\n\nBut these two natures are so united together in one person that they are not even separated by his death.\n\nSo then, what he committed to his Father when he died was a real human spirit which left his body. But meanwhile his divine nature remained united with his human nature even when he was lying in the grave; and his deity never ceased to be in him, just as it was in him when he was a little child, though for a while it did not show itself as such.\n\nThese are the reasons why we confess him to be true God and true man—true God in order to conquer death by his power, and true man that he might die for us in the weakness of his flesh.\n\nArticle 20: The Justice and Mercy of God in Christ\n\nWe believe that God—who is perfectly merciful and also very just—sent his Son to assume the nature in which the disobedience had been committed, in order to bear in it the punishment of sin by his most bitter passion and death.\n\nSo God made known his justice toward his Son, who was charged with our sin, and he poured out his goodness and mercy on us, who are guilty and worthy of damnation, giving to us his Son to die, by a most perfect love, and raising him to life for our justification, in order that by him we might have immortality and eternal life.\n\nArticle 21: The Atonement\n\nWe believe that Jesus Christ is a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek—made such by an oath—and that he presented himself in our name before his Father, to appease his wrath with full satisfaction by offering himself on the tree of the cross and pouring out his precious blood for the cleansing of our sins, as the prophets had predicted.\n\nFor it is written that “the chastisement of our peace” was placed on the Son of God and that “we are healed by his wounds.” He was “led to death as a lamb”; he was “numbered among sinners” and condemned as a criminal by Pontius Pilate, though Pilate had declared that he was innocent.\n\nSo he paid back what he had not stolen, and he suffered—the “just for the unjust,” in both his body and his soul—in such a way that when he senses the horrible punishment required by our sins his sweat became like “big drops of blood falling on the ground.” He cried, “My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?”\n\nAnd he endured all this for the forgiveness of our sins.\n\nTherefore we rightly say with Paul that we “know nothing but Jesus and him crucified”; we consider all things as “dung for the excellence of the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.” We find all comforts in his wounds and have no need to seek or invent any other means to reconcile ourselves with God than this one and only sacrifice, once made, which renders believers perfect forever.\n\nThis is also why the angel of God called him Jesus—that is, “Savior”—because he would save his people from their sins.\n\nArticle 22: The Righteousness of Faith\n\nWe believe that for us to acquire the true knowledge of this great mystery the Holy Spirit kindles in our hearts a true faith that embraces Jesus Christ, with all his merits, and makes him its own, and no longer looks for anything apart from him.\n\nFor it must necessarily follow that either all that is required for our salvation is not in Christ or, if all is in him, then he who has Christ by faith has his salvation entirely.\n\nTherefore, to say that Christ is not enough but that something else is needed as well is a most enormous blasphemy against God—for it then would follow that Jesus Christ is only half a Savior. And therefore we justly say with Paul that we are justified “by faith alone” or by faith “apart from works.”\n\nHowever, we do not mean, properly speaking, that it is faith itself that justifies us—for faith is only the instrument by which we embrace Christ, our righteousness.\n\nBut Jesus Christ is our righteousness in making available to us all his merits and all the holy works he has done for us and in our place. And faith is the instrument that keeps us in communion with him and with all his benefits.\n\nWhen those benefits are made ours they are more than enough to absolve us of our sins.\n\nArticle 23: The Justification of Sinners\n\nWe believe that our blessedness lies in the forgiveness of our sins because of Jesus Christ, and that in it our righteousness before God is contained, as David and Paul teach us when they declare that man blessed to whom God grants righteousness apart from works.\n\nAnd the same apostle says that we are justified “freely” or “by grace” through redemption in Jesus Christ. And therefore we cling to this foundation, which is firm forever, giving all glory to God, humbling ourselves, and recognizing ourselves as we are; not claiming a thing for ourselves or our merits and leaning and resting on the sole obedience of Christ crucified, which is ours when we believe in him.\n\nThat is enough to cover all our sins and to make us confident, freeing the conscience from the fear, dread, and terror of God’s approach, without doing what our first father, Adam, did, who trembled as he tried to cover himself with fig leaves.\n\nIn fact, if we had to appear before God relying—no matter how little—on ourselves or some other creature, then, alas, we would be swallowed up.\n\nTherefore everyone must say with David: “Lord, do not enter into judgment with your servants, for before you no living person shall be justified.”\n\nArticle 24: The Sanctification of Sinners\n\nWe believe that this true faith, produced in man by the hearing of God’s Word and by the work of the Holy Spirit, regenerates him and makes him a “new man,” causing him to live the “new life” and freeing him from the slavery of sin.\n\nTherefore, far from making people cold toward living in a pious and holy way, this justifying faith, quite to the contrary, so works within them that apart from it they will never do a thing out of love for God but only out of love for themselves and fear of being condemned.\n\nSo then, it is impossible for this holy faith to be unfruitful in a human being, seeing that we do not speak of an empty faith but of what Scripture calls “faith working through love,” which leads a man to do by himself the works that God has commanded in his Word.\n\nThese works, proceeding from the good root of faith, are good and acceptable to God, since they are all sanctified by his grace. Yet they do not count toward our justification— for by faith in Christ we are justified, even before we do good works. Otherwise they could not be good, any more than the fruit of a tree could be good if the tree is not good in the first place.\n\nSo then, we do good works, but nor for merit—for what would we merit? Rather, we are indebted to God for the good works we do, and not he to us, since it is he who “works in us both to will and do according to his good pleasure”—thus keeping in mind what\n\nis written: “When you have done all that is commanded you, then you shall say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have done what it was our duty to do.’ “\n\nYet we do not wish to deny that God rewards good works—but it is by his grace that he crowns his gifts.\n\nMoreover, although we do good works we do not base our salvation on them; for we cannot do any work that is not defiled by our flesh and also worthy of punishment. And even if we could point to one, memory of a single sin is enough for God to reject that work.\n\nSo we would always be in doubt, tossed back and forth without any certainty, and our poor consciences would be tormented constantly if they did not rest on the merit of the suffering and death of our Savior.\n\nArticle 25: The Fulfillment of the Law\n\nWe believe that the ceremonies and symbols of the law have ended with the coming of Christ, and that all foreshadowings have come to an end, so that the use of them ought to be abolished among Christians. Yet the truth and substance of these things remain for us in Jesus Christ, in whom they have been fulfilled.\n\nNevertheless, we continue to use the witnesses drawn from the law and prophets to confirm us in the gospel and to regulate our lives with full integrity for the glory of God, according to his will.\n\nArticle 26: The Intercession of Christ\n\nWe believe that we have no access to God except through the one and only Mediator and Intercessor: Jesus Christ the Righteous.\n\nHe therefore was made man, uniting together the divine and human natures, so that we human beings might have access to the divine Majesty. Otherwise we would have no access.\n\nBut this Mediator, whom the Father has appointed between himself and us, ought not terrify us by his greatness, so that we have to look for another one, according to our fancy. For neither in heaven nor among the creatures on earth is there anyone who loves us more than Jesus Christ does. Although he was “in the form of God,” he nevertheless “emptied himself,” taking the form of “a man” and “a servant” for us; and he made himself “completely like his brothers.”\n\nSuppose we had to find another intercessor. Who would love us more than he who gave his life for us, even though “we were his enemies”? And suppose we had to find one who has prestige and power. Who has as much of these as he who is seated “at the right hand of the Father,” and who has all power “in heaven and on earth”? And who will be heard more readily than God’s own dearly beloved Son?\n\nSo then, sheer unbelief has led to the practice of dishonoring the saints, instead of honoring them. That was something the saints never did nor asked for, but which in keeping with their duty, as appears from their writings, they consistently refused.\n\nWe should not plead here that we are unworthy—for it is not a question of offering our prayers on the basis of our own dignity but only on the basis of the excellence and dignity of Jesus Christ, whose righteousness is ours by faith.\n\nSince the apostle for good reason wants us to get rid of this foolish fear—or rather, this unbelief—he says to us that Jesus Christ was “made like his brothers in all things,” that he might be a high priest who is merciful and faithful to purify the sins of the people. For since he suffered, being tempted, he is also able to help those who are tempted.\n\nAnd further, to encourage us more to approach him he says, “Since we have a high priest, Jesus the Son of God, who has entered into heaven, we maintain our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to have compassion for our weaknesses, but one who was tempted in all things, just as we are, except for sin. Let us go then with confidence to the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace, in order to be helped.”\n\nThe same apostle says that we “have liberty to enter into the holy place by the blood of Jesus. Let us go, then, in the assurance of faith….”\n\nLikewise, “Christ’s priesthood is forever. By this he is able to save completely those who draw near to God through him who always lives to intercede for them.”\n\nWhat more do we need? For Christ himself declares: “I am the way, the truth, and the life; no one comes to my Father but by me.” Why should we seek another intercessor?\n\nSince it has pleased God to give us his Son as our Intercessor, let us not leave him for another—or rather seek, without ever finding. For when God gave him to us he knew well that we were sinners.\n\nTherefore, in following the command of Christ we call on the heavenly Father through Christ, our only Mediator, as we are taught by the Lord’s Prayer, being assured that we shall obtain all we ask of the Father in his name.\n\nArticle 27: The Holy Catholic Church\n\nWe believe and confess one single catholic or universal church—a holy congregation and gathering of true Christian believers, awaiting their entire salvation in Jesus Christ being washed by his blood, and sanctified and sealed by the Holy Spirit.\n\nThis church has existed from the beginning of the world and will last until the end, as appears from the fact that Christ is eternal King who cannot be without subjects.\n\nAnd this holy church is preserved by God against the rage of the whole world, even though for a time it may appear very small in the eyes of men—as though it were snuffed out.\n\nFor example, during the very dangerous time of Ahab the Lord preserved for himself seven thousand men who did not bend their knees to Baal.\n\nAnd so this holy church is not confined, bound, or limited to a certain place or certain persons. But it is spread and dispersed throughout the entire world, though still joined and united in heart and will, in one and the same Spirit, by the power of faith.\n\nArticle 28: The Obligations of Church Members\n\nWe believe that since this holy assembly and congregation is the gathering of those who are saved and there is no salvation apart from it, no one ought to withdraw from it, content to be by himself, regardless of his status or condition.\n\nBut all people are obliged to join and unite with it, keeping the unity of the church by submitting to its instruction and discipline, by bending their necks under the yoke of Jesus Christ, and by serving to build up one another, according to the gifts God has given them as members of each other in the same body.\n\nAnd to preserve this unity more effectively, it is the duty of all believers, according to God’s Word, to separate themselves from those who do not belong to the church, in order to join this assembly wherever God has established it, even if civil authorities and royal decrees forbid and death and physical punishment result.\n\nAnd so, all who withdraw from the church or do not join it act contrary to God’s ordinance.\n\nArticle 29: The Marks of the True Church\n\nWe believe that we ought to discern diligently and very carefully, by the Word of God, what is the true church—for all sects in the world today claim for themselves the name of “the church.”\n\nWe are not speaking here of the company of hypocrites who are mixed among the good in the church and who nonetheless are not part of it, even though they are physically there. But we are speaking of distinguishing the body and fellowship of the true church from all sects that call themselves “the church.”\n\nThe true church can be recognized if it has the following marks: The church engages in the pure preaching of the gospel; it makes use of the pure administration of the sacraments as Christ instituted them; it practices church discipline for correcting faults. In short, it governs itself according to the pure Word of God, rejecting all things contrary to it and holding Jesus Christ as the only Head. By these marks one can be assured of recognizing the true church—and no one ought to be separated from it.\n\nAs for those who can belong to the church, we can recognize them by the distinguishing marks of Christians: namely by faith, and by their fleeing from sin and pursuing righteousness, once they have received the one and only Savior, Jesus Christ. They love the true God and their neighbors, without turning to the right or left, and they crucify the flesh and its works.\n\nThough great weakness remains in them, they fight against it by the Spirit all the days of their lives, appealing constantly to the blood, suffering, death, and obedience of the Lord Jesus, in whom they have forgiveness of their sins, through faith in him.\n\nAs for the false church, it assigns more authority to itself and its ordinances than\n\nto the Word of God; it does not want to subject itself to the yoke of Christ; it does not administer the sacraments as Christ commanded in his Word; it rather adds to them or subtracts from them as it pleases; it bases itself on men, more than on Jesus Christ; it persecutes those who live holy lives according to the Word of God and who rebuke it for its faults, greed, and idolatry.\n\nThese two churches are easy to recognize and thus to distinguish from each other.\n\nArticle 30: The Government of the Church\n\nWe believe that this true church ought to be governed according to the spiritual order that our Lord has taught us in his Word. There should be ministers or pastors to preach the Word of God and adminster the sacraments. There should also be elders and deacons, along with the pastors, to make up the council of the church.\n\nBy this means true religion is preserved; true doctrine is able to take its course; and evil men are corrected spiritually and held in check, so that also the poor and all the afflicted may be helped and comforted according to their need.\n\nBy this means everything will be done well and in good order in the church, when such persons are elected who are faithful and are chosen according to the rule that Paul gave to Timothy.\n\nArticle 31: The Officers of the Church\n\nWe believe that ministers of the Word of God, elders, and deacons ought to be chosen to their offices by a legitimate election of the church, with prayer in the name of the Lord, and in good order, as the Word of God teaches.\n\nSo everyone must be careful not to push himself forward improperly, but he must wait for God’s call, so that he may be assured of his calling and be certain that he is chosen by the Lord.\n\nAs for the ministers of the Word, they all have the same power and authority, no matter where they may be, since they are all servants of Jesus Christ, the only universal bishop, and the only head of the church.\n\nMoreover, to keep God’s holy order from being violated or despised, we say that everyone ought, as much as possible, to hold the ministers of the Word and elders of the church in special esteem, because of the work they do, and be at peace with them, without grumbling, quarreling, or fighting.\n\nArticle 32: The Order and Discipline of the Church\n\nWe also believe that although it is useful and good for those who govern the churches to establish and set up a certain order among themselves for maintaining the body of the church, they ought always to guard against deviating from what Christ, our only Master, has ordained for us.\n\nTherefore we reject all human innovations and all laws imposed on us, in our worship of God, which bind and force our consciences in any way.\n\nSo we accept only what is proper to maintain harmony and unity and to keep all in obedience to God.\n\nTo that end excommunication, with all it involves, according to the Word of God, is required.\n\nArticle 33: The Sacraments\n\nWe believe that our good God, mindful of our crudeness and weakness, has ordained sacraments for us to seal his promises in us, to pledge his good will and grace toward us, and also to nourish and sustain our faith.\n\nHe has added these to the Word of the gospel to represent better to our external senses both what he enables us to understand by his Word and what he does inwardly in our hearts, confirming in us the salvation he imparts to us.\n\nFor they are visible signs and seals of something internal and invisible, by means of which God works in us through the power of the Holy Spirit. So they are not empty and hollow signs to fool and deceive us, for their truth is Jesus Christ, without whom they would be nothing.\n\nMoreover, we are satisfied with the number of sacraments that Christ our Master has ordained for us. There are only two: the sacrament of baptism and the Holy Supper of Jesus Christ.\n\nArticle 34: The Sacrament of Baptism\n\nWe believe and confess that Jesus Christ, in whom the law is fulfilled, has by his shed blood put an end to every other shedding of blood, which anyone might do or wish to do in order to atone or satisfy for sins.\n\nHaving abolished circumcision, which was done with blood, he established in its place the sacrament of baptism. By it we are received into God’s church and set apart from all other people and alien religions, that we may be dedicated entirely to him, bearing his mark and sign. It also witnesses to us that he will be our God forever, since he is our gracious Father.\n\nTherefore he has commanded that all those who belong to him be baptized with pure water in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit.\n\nIn this way he signifies to us that just as water washes away the dirt of the body when it is poured on us and also is seen on the body of the baptized when it is sprinkled on him, so too the blood of Christ does the same thing internally, in the soul, by the Holy Spirit. It washes and cleanses it from its sins and transforms us from being the children of wrath into the children of God.\n\nThis does not happen by the physical water but by the sprinkling of the precious blood of the Son of God, who is our Red Sea, through which we must pass to escape the tyranny of Pharoah, who is the devil, and to enter the spiritual land of Canaan.\n\nSo ministers, as far as their work is concerned, give us the sacrament and what is visible, but our Lord gives what the sacrament signifies—namely the invisible gifts and graces; washing, purifying, and cleansing our souls of all filth and unrighteousness; renewing our hearts and filling them with all comfort; giving us true assurance of his fatherly goodness; clothing us with the “new man” and stripping off the “old,” with all its works.\n\nFor this reason we believe that anyone who aspires to reach eternal life ought to be baptized only once without ever repeating it—for we cannot be born twice. Yet this baptism is profitable not only when the water is on us and when we receive it but throughout our entire lives.\n\nFor that reason we detest the error of the Anabaptists who are not content with a single baptism once received and also condemn the baptism of the children of believers. We believe our children ought to be baptized and sealed with the sign of the covenant, as little children were circumcised in Israel on the basis of the same promises made to our children.\n\nAnd truly, Christ has shed his blood no less for washing the little children of believers than he did for adults.\n\nTherefore they ought to receive the sign and sacrament of what Christ has done for them, just as the Lord commanded in the law that by offering a lamb for them the sacrament of the suffering and death of Christ would be granted them shortly after their birth. This was the sacrament of Jesus Christ.\n\nFurthermore, baptism does for our children what circumcision did for the Jewish people. That is why Paul calls baptism the “circumcision of Christ.”\n\nArticle 35: The Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper\n\nWe believe and confess that our Savior Jesus Christ has ordained and instituted the sacrament of the Holy Supper to nourish and sustain those who are already born again and ingrafted into his family: his church.\n\nNow those who are born again have two lives in them. The one is physical and temporal—they have it from the moment of their first birth, and it is common to all. The other is spiritual and heavenly, and is given them in their second birth; it comes through the Word of the gospel in the communion of the body of Christ; and this life is common to God’s elect only.\n\nThus, to support the physical and earthly life God has prescribed for us an appropriate earthly and material bread, which is as common to all as life itself also is. But to maintain the spiritual and heavenly life that belongs to believers he has sent a living bread that came down from heaven: namely Jesus Christ, who nourishes and maintains the spiritual life of believers when eaten—that is, when appropriated and received spiritually by faith.\n\nTo represent to us this spiritual and heavenly bread Christ has instituted an earthly and visible bread as the sacrament of his body and wine as the sacrament of his blood. He did this to testify to us that just as truly as we take and hold the sacraments in our hands and eat and drink it in our mouths, by which our life is then sustained, so truly we receive into our souls, for our spiritual life, the true body and true blood of Christ, our only Savior. We receive these by faith, which is the hand and mouth of our souls.\n\nNow it is certain that Jesus Christ did not prescribe his sacraments for us in vain, since he works in us all he represents by these holy signs, although the manner in which he does it goes beyond our understanding and is uncomprehensible to us, just as the operation of God’s Spirit is hidden and incomprehensible.\n\nYet we do not go wrong when we say that what is eaten is Christ’s own natural body and what is drunk is his own blood—but the manner in which we eat it is not by the mouth but by the Spirit, through faith.\n\nIn that way Jesus Christ remains always seated at the right hand of God the Father in heaven—but he never refrains on that account to communicate himself to us through faith.\n\nThis banquet is a spiritual table at which Christ communicates himself to us with all his benefits. At that table he makes us enjoy himself as much as the merits of his suffering and death, as he nourishes, strengthens, and comforts our poor, desolate souls by the eating of his flesh, and relieves and renews them by the drinking of his blood.\n\nMoreover, though the sacraments and thing signified are joined together, not all receive both of them. The wicked person certainly takes the sacrament, to his condemnation, but does not receive the truth of the sacrament, just as Judas and Simon the Sorcerer both indeed received the sacrament, but not Christ, who was signified by it. He is communicated only to believers.\n\nFinally, with humility and reverence we receive the holy sacrament in the gathering of God’s people, as we engage together, with thanksgiving, in a holy remembrance of the death of Christ our Savior, and as we thus confess our faith and Christian religion. Therefore no one should come to this table without examining himself carefully, lest “by eating this bread and drinking this cup he eat and drink to his own judgment.”\n\nIn short, by the use of this holy sacrament we are moved to a fervent love of God and our neighbors.\n\nTherefore we reject as desecrations of the sacraments all the muddled ideas and damnable inventions that men have added and mixed in with them. And we say that we should be content with the procedure that Christ and the apostles have taught us and speak of these things as they have spoken of them.\n\nArticle 36: The Civil Government\n\nWe believe that because of the depravity of the human race our good God has ordained kings, princes, and civil officers. He wants the world to be governed by laws and policies so that human lawlessness may be restrained and that everything may be conducted in good order among human beings.\n\nFor that purpose he has placed the sword in the hands of the government, to punish evil people and protect the good.\n\nAnd being called in this manner to contribute to the advancement of a society that is pleasing to God, the civil rulers have the task, subject to God’s law, of removing every obstacle to the preaching of the gospel and to every aspect of divine worship.\n\nThey should do this while completely refraining from every tendency toward exercising absolute authority, and while functioning in the sphere entrusted to them, with the means belonging to them.\n\nAnd the governme"
