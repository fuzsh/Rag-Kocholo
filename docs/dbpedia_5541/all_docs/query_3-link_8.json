        "text": "WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Ben Cardin (D-Md.)and Senator Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) announced passage by the Senate of a bipartisan resolution (S. Res. 458 ) recognizing May as Jewish American Heritage Month and honoring Holocaust survivors for their contributions to the United States of America. The resolution, which was cosponsored by Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), and Senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Robert Menendez (D-NJ), Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio), commemorates the many contributions people of the Jewish faith have made to American society in the areas of the humanities, science, government, law, history, medicine, military service, philosophy, social justice, technology, and more.\n\n“Jewish American Heritage month is about celebrating the innumerable contributions people of the Jewish faith have been making in Maryland and across America since before our founding,” said Senator Cardin. “I am thankful for the many Jewish American trailblazers, especially those who have overcome the greatest of obstacles, to strengthen our country through civic engagement and enrich our American culture. My hope is that this resolution will help inspire the next generation of innovators and leaders.”\n\n“This resolution honors the memory of the millions who perished during one of the worst atrocities of the 20th century, the Holocaust. It also celebrates the lives of those who survived this unspeakable horror. These remarkable individuals have contributed greatly to American life and I am proud to recognize their achievements,” said Senator Kirk.\n\n“It is important to recognize the contributions Jewish Americans and Holocaust survivors have made in Illinois and across the country,” Senator Durbin said. “From brave service in the military to the fields of social justice and medicine, the gifts of Jewish culture on American society are everywhere.”\n\n“In Jewish communities across the United States, public service, social action, and charity are rooted in both the religious and cultural components of Judaism. During Jewish Heritage month, we recognize members of Ohio’s Jewish community and the contributions they make to better the lives of their families, friends, and cities,” said Senator Sherrod Brown.\n\n“This month and throughout the year, it’s important that we celebrate the many contributions Jewish Americans have made as well as remember the great struggles endured by Holocaust survivors and honor the memories of the millions of victims,” Senator Booker said. “I am truly grateful for my fellow Americans who bring their many talents and rich culture to New Jersey’s thriving Jewish community and honor their commitment to stand on the frontlines in the fight for liberty and justice for all.”\n\n“Jewish American Heritage Month gives us the opportunity to celebrate and honor a community that has been an integral part of weaving the fabric of America,” said Senator Menendez. “From science and innovation, to music and popular culture, to government and business, Jewish Americans have enriched our society at every turn. Their stories are the quintessential American stories of struggles and successes, faith and family, diversity and tolerance. Along the way, Jewish Americans were, and continue to be, front and center in the fight for civil rights, inclusion, and equality. So now is a time to recognize our vibrant Jewish community and the many ways Jewish Americans lift our country up.”\n\n“I embrace this opportunity to honor and celebrate the contributions of the Jewish community to our nation’s heritage. In particular, we owe a special tribute to those who have enriched our lives after experiencing the incomprehensible and indescribable atrocities of the Holocaust,” Senator Mikulski said. “These individuals have made an indelible impact on our cities and our culture, in Maryland and across the United States. I look forward to the future generations that will continue to build upon their legacy.”\n\n“In addition to ensuring that survivors in my state and around the country have the care they need as they age, it’s important to honor their lifetime of contributions,” said Senator Nelson.\n\n“During Jewish Heritage Month, we pay tribute to the countless Holocaust survivors and their spirit and dedication to humanity,” said Senator Gillibrand. “We honor the Holocaust survivors living in the United States who continue to bear witness to their personal stories and who help enrich our country one generation after the next.”\n\n“Jewish American Heritage month commemorates the many achievements from the Jewish community throughout the United States and in Ohio,” said Senator Portman. “We honor all Holocaust survivors this month, as well as all that the Jewish faith has contributed to our society.”\n\nThe resolution honors the accomplishments of survivors of the Holocaust who went on to make substantial contributions to American society.\n\n###"
