        "text": "CHICAGO – Today, Illinois religious and community advocates held a press call to urge their senator, Mark Kirk, to support the bipartisan Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act.\n\nThe bill, which would implement direly needed reforms to our criminal justice system, could be voted on in the near future. The proposal has support from conservatives, liberals and community advocates from across Illinois, but Senator Kirk has not yet joined his colleagues as a bill co-sponsor or even announced his support.\n\nClick here to listen to an MP3 of the call.\n\nQuotes from the call’s participants are below.\n\nJuan Pablo Herrera of DOOR Chicago, Chicago\n\n“Our justice system is failing to keep us safe and failing to reduce recidivism. The provisions in this bill would begin to address some of the most serious problems in our corrections system, so I am asking Senator Kirk to support this bill to help our communities and to help our families.”\n\nJudith Roberts of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Chicago\n\n“Mass incarceration hurts not just individuals, but communities. We are calling on Senator Kirk to support The Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act so we can help restore our communities.”\n\nRabbi Seth Limmer of the Chicago Sinai Congregation, Chicago\n\n“As Reform Jews, we value mercy, redemption and rehabilitation for those who commit wrongdoings, and we are deeply concerned about the ever-growing racial and class disparities in the criminal justice system. We urge Congress to pass the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act as an important remedy to the problem of mass incarceration, and as a much-needed first step toward truly comprehensive reform of the criminal justice system.”\n\nXavier McElrath-Bey of the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youthand a formerly incarcerated youth, Chicago\n\n“At the age of 40, I stand here with a master’s degree. I came out of incarceration with a remorseful heart and a mission to advocate for poor and disadvantaged youth involved in our justice system. [Formerly incarcerated people] can recreate themselves. They can become productive members of society. They can do something better and give back and return to their communities in a positive way. Because of that, I urge Senator Kirk to support this bill. Please join us in this effort and allow us to make a change in our society.”\n\nScott Simpson of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Washington, DC\n\n“This is one of the issues where both parties agree that reform is needed. Americans want reform. Polls continue to show that Americans want a justice system reform that’s more fair, protects public safety, and uses our resources efficiently. These issues resonate in Illinois and Senator Kirk should step up and support this bill.”\n\n###"
