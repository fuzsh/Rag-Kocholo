        "text": "Donned in fluorescent red “Make America Great Again” hat and light blue “Socialism Sucks” shirt, Charlie Kirk, the twenty-six-year-old founder and leader of Turning Point USA (TPUSA), has easily become one of the most recognizable figures in the youth conservative movement. The tall, lanky man-child out of Prospect Heights, Illinois is widely known for his media presence, his ability to energize young Republicans, his barrage of attacks against the left, and his stringent defense of President Donald Trump.\n\nBefore spearheading TPUSA, a popular “conservative” student organization, Kirk attended Wheeling High School in suburban Chicago and rose to stardom at a young age, initially receiving attention during his late grade school years. As a high school senior in 2012, Kirk wrote a piece about the alleged liberal indoctrination of academic textbooks for Breitbart News, a relatively controversial news source. This piece earned him an appearance on Fox Business—the onset of his lengthy, ongoing string of Fox Network appearances.\n\nHe founded TPUSA that same year at just 18 years old. At the time, he was taking classes at Harper College, a local community college, but subsequently dropped out to pursue a life in conservative activism as a quasi-politician. Thus, Kirk does not have any formal college education. He has, however, mentioned that his dream school was the United States Military Academy at West Point, of which he was denied admission. Kirk claims that this was because his slot went to “a far less-qualified candidate of a different gender and a different persuasion.” Essentially, he blamed affirmative action—possibly why he now opposes it so stridently.\n\nTPUSA has received criticism for the tactics the organization employs to defend its goal of promoting “the principles of fiscal responsibility, free markets, and limited government,” with many arguing that the group strays from true conservative values in order to achieve its end. The means to achieve this end, according to them, is to change the fundamental left-leaning biases of college campuses. As part of this ongoing quest to rid campuses of liberal bias, Kirk is currently travelling the country on TPUSA’s “Culture War” tour, pairing up with prominent political figures like Donald Trump Jr. and Senator Rand Paul.\n\nKirk’s inexperience in actual campus culture and his lack of formal college education exacerbate the organization’s grievances regarding this “Culture War.” While some anti-conservative bias exists, TPUSA serves to fabricate it in areas where those biases are not present, and their methodology does nothing to address the actual issue. Instead of promoting healthy dialogue to bridge the gap between the left and right, TPUSA promotes an inherently inflammatory brand. Wearing “Socialism Sucks” paraphernalia will do nothing to change the hearts and minds of legitimate socialists. Traveling to various schools to debate liberals and “own the libs” will only deepen the political divide. There is also an amusing irony in that Kirk is the one trying to change the culture of college campuses. There are many people in this country you can consult regarding the conservative college experience, but Kirk, a man who has barely ever stepped foot on a college campus in an academic capacity, is not one of them. If you want someone to discuss campus issues accurately, perhaps it is better to start with someone who has experienced them firsthand—a current student or a recent graduate, for example. The Dartmouth bureaucrat who decided it was a good idea to cut off inter-housing system access might even have more reliable input.\n\nThis is not to say that Kirk is unintelligent. From his first TV hit alone, you could tell that he had a propensity for public speaking. He was eloquent, expressive, and crisp in his speech—remarkable for someone his age. He had so much potential to be a positive conservative voice. His quick rise to popularity made him a prominent media figure, and other young conservatives looked to him as a standard. Having a sound education should have been his priority, especially since he chose campus expertise as his selling point. Instead, this early transition into the spotlight, without first forming a firm ideological foundation, left him especially impressionable. While his intentions may have been to promote “fiscal responsibility, free markets, and limited government” at first, his end goal became distorted over time—as he would consistently prioritize alternatives that built his brand and pleased right-leaning media outlets.\n\nAn example of how his views changed due to media pressure is TPUSA’s progression into a “Trump-First” organization. TPUSA was founded on conservative values, yet it has let politics corrupt their ideology. As a 501(c)(3), TPUSA is not technically allowed to endorse candidates, or else they would lose their tax-exempt status. However, through certain loopholes, the group has held events with speakers directly involved in the Trump campaign. President Trump himself was even the keynote speaker at TPUSA’s Teen Student Action Summit, essentially turning the event into an oversized campaign rally for pubescent teens. Kirk even comes to Trump’s defense on nearly every decision the President makes, even when a defense is not warranted and the decision does not align with conservative values. “Trump is the first leader in the history of the world to be attacked for improving the lives of the citizens that voted for him,” Kirk said, clearly forgetting that Abraham Lincoln—a champion of civil rights—was assassinated during his presidency. The reason for his allegiance is because it serves as a transaction of mutual benefit. Kirk draws additional media attention, increases his following, and builds his brand, when he sides with Trump.\n\nKirk ultimately let his fame and opportunities determine his beliefs, rather than building up beliefs that would later shape his fame and opportunities. Conservatism may have started out as his cause, but it soon turned into a vessel to achieve notoriety. He has fallen victim to the praise of the right-leaning media, and instead of defending the core values that TPUSA was founded on, Kirk made a Faustian bargain, trading pure and original conservatism for short-term success.\n\nIt is unclear where he will go from here. As Fox Business host Stuart Varney claims, Kirk “will be President someday.” I would contend that this is highly unlikely, as his lack of education severely harms any prospect of a career in office. As Kirk has become known as “Trump’s Man on Campus,” it becomes even more uncertain what he will do after the Trump presidency. Although I speak harshly of Kirk, he has still made massive contributions, drawing a considerably large following into the conservative movement. However, he may be stuck with TPUSA for quite some time, or at least until he becomes too old to continue talking about campus politics.\n\nTrue conservatives must eventually outgrow TPUSA and devote their efforts elsewhere. We must challenge ourselves by pursuing an environment of rigorous inquiry, instead of being coddled by the intellectually devoid echo chamber of TPUSA, compromising our values for recognition—I challenge Charlie Kirk to do the same. For the time being, thank goodness the Dartmouth TPUSA chapter never got off the ground."
