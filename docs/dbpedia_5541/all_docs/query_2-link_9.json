        "text": "Sen. Mark Kirk (R-IL) is only one of the many people in Washington who are scratching their heads today after the Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testified that the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt was mostly a \"secular\" group.\n\n\"The term ‘Muslim Brotherhood’ is an umbrella term for a variety of movements, in the case of Egypt, a very heterogeneous group, largely secular, which has eschewed violence and has decried Al Qaeda as a perversion of Islam,\" Clapper told the first ever hearing of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence under new chairman Mike Rogers (R-MI).\n\nABC News was quick to point out that he U.S. State Department’s Background Note on Egypt describes the Muslim Brotherhood as a \"potent political and religious force.\"\n\nClapper’s public affairs chief Jamie Smith \"clarified\" the remarks, telling ABC that Clapper really meant to say that \"in Egypt the Muslim Brotherhood makes efforts to work through a political system that has been, under Mubarak’s rule, one that is largely secular in its orientation – he is well aware that the Muslim Brotherhood is not a secular organization.\"\n\nBut the gaffe was enough to invoke the ire of many in Congress, who are warning about the risks of the Muslim Brotherhood coming to power. Kirk, who was a Naval intelligence officer, issued a statement criticizing Clapper Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"I am concerned that the DNI’s assessment does not agree with recent public statements by senior leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood nor does it agree with the organization’s publicly stated goals,\" Kirk’s statement read. \"As the world watches these historic events unfolding in Egypt, the United States should support an orderly transition to democracy that prevents the radical Muslim Brotherhood from grabbing power.\"\n\nThe debate over the real identity and role of the Brotherhood is just starting in Congress, and was at the top of lawmakers’ concerns at Wednesday’s hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee."
