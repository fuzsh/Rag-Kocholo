        "text": "On Wednesday, Dream City Church held its monthly Freedom Night in America event with guest speaker Andrew Sedra.\n\nThe multi-site church based in Phoenix, Arizona, hosts the gathering in partnership with Charlie Kirk and Turning Point USA Faith (TPUSA).\n\nAccording to its website, Dream City Church launched Freedom Night in America “in an effort to continue winning the American Culture War.”\n\nThe goal for Dream City and TPUSA Faith is to “call the faith community to action. With Freedom Night in America, TPUSA Faith is activating millions of faith-filled patriotic Americans by giving them the necessary tools to bridge the gap of Faith and Freedom in an effort to save the country.”\n\nThis month’s guest speaker, Andrew Sedra, is the pastor of Echo Church in Australia. At the Freedom Night event he largely focused on politics in Australia and the United States, LGBTQ+ issues, and what he says are the dangers of Islam.\n\nHe told the audience he believes that, from a cultural standpoint, Australia is about 10 years ahead of the United States.\n\nAustralia is “setting up the environment to systematically criminalize Christianity…Every single person has to worship the pagan gods of the state, and that’s what’s happening in America at the moment,” Sedra said.\n\nKirk agreed. He emphasized the importance of politics by referencing the biblical story of Elijah.\n\nAccess to MinistryWatch content is free.

By the way, [the story of Elijah] is a great example if anyone ever tells you you shouldn’t be political, Elijah was political,” Kirk said. “How is that not political to confront the powers that be of who is actually god in your land? I want to emphasize that. Elijah is one of the most important figures of the Bible.”\n\nHe also told the crowd he thinks “Jezebel is Hillary Clinton. I was doing a deep study, it’s not even an opinion, it’s just a fact.”\n\nSedra told the audience that churches have to decide if they’re “going to preach the truth of the Bible no matter the cost, or if you’re going to be politically correct and eventually what you say will be illegal.”\n\nSedra and Kirk also spent time talking about “woke Christianity.”\n\n“Woke Christianity is a very weird thing, a very western thing,” Sedra said. “What woke Christians do is split religion from politics. They fail to realize that politics is religious and religion is political. There is actually no difference between religion and politics…Woke pastors, they’re not just weak and woke, they’re actually womanized pastors.”\n\nHe asked audience members to think about Daniel, Paul, and Jesus, among others, and told them “every single character in the Bible was political.”\n\nKirk told Sedra: “I’m inspired by you. Pastors in this country are largely a joke. So many pastors are afraid of losing a tax status…I want to commend you. If we had 2,000 pastors with the same spirit that you have, the West would be saved.”\n\n“Pastors have to wake the hell up because we are losing ground,” Sedra said.\n\nSedra also covered topics such as progressivism and Islam during his hour-long talk, even distinguishing an “unholy alliance” between Islam and progressivism.\n\n“They both hate Christianity, they both hate the West and they both hate America.”\n\nSedra continued: “If you think Islam cannot destroy America, the history books would actually disagree with you. Islam is a more powerful reality than progressivism. I believe progressivism is the pathway to Islam.”\n\n“Progressivism is a gateway drug to totalitarianism,” said Kirk.\n\nDream City Church, led by Senior Pastor Luke Barnett, has had ties to Kirk since 2020 when they partnered with the political arm of TPUSA to host a Students for Trump rally. Earlier this month they linked arms to host the Strong Church Dream Conference, a training conference for ministry leaders.\n\nMain photo: Andrew Sedra, left, and Charlie Kirk, right, at Dream City Church’s Freedom Night in America on March 6, 2024 / Photo via social media"
