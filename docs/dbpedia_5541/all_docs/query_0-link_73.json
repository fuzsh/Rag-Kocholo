        "text": "1600’s 1656 The first recorded religious services in town were held in the houses of settlers. 1664 The 7 Proprietors: Jeffre Ferris, Senre; Joshua Knapp, Senre; Joseph Ferris, Jonathan Reynolds, Angell Heusted, John Mead and John Hobbe wanted their own church & town separate from Stamford. Church and government were inseparable. They had Congregational values of free choice. 1665 May 11 Charter: The church was incorporated by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut as the First Church of Christ in Greenwich. 1667 A newly built schoolhouse became the place of worship as well as a central meeting place. 1669 The first pastor was Eliphalet Jones, who was shared by other churches. 1670 William Grimes willed his land, about 32 acres in Shorelands, for town/church improvements. This was our first endowment. We rented the land for grazing. 1678 Jeremiah Peck became the first settled minister. 1694 A second new church was built at Tomac and Lockwood Avenue. It was 32 feet long by 26 feet wide. 1700’s 1705 The General Court in Hartford split the Horseneck Society from the “East Society” (our old name), becoming what is now the Second Congregational Church in Greenwich. The dividing line between the two Ecclesiastical Societies was the Mianus River. Before this, both groups shared pastors, causing many years of disputes. Several pastors left due to this. 1735 A third two-story wooden building for the church, the Gallery Church, was built on the same spot as the first. Episcopalians helped build this church in return for them being able to hold their services there on Sunday afternoons. 1785 Members of the church had to buy a pew space and build their own pew. The Revolutionary War left our town in very bad shape financially. 1800’s 1812 The War of 1812 bypassed Greenwich. 1816 Sunday School began here. 1835 A fourth wooden Meetinghouse for the church was built by Joshua Ferris on Sound Beach Avenue, after buying part of the Ebenezer Peck estate property. Mr. Ferris was paid $1800. Our current cemetery was established there as well. This white pillared building burned down in 1895. 1835-36 Regular church attendance or you were fined. Attendance was more than a duty – it was a social obligation. Sabbath breaking, intoxication and profanity were causes for excommunication. Due to those rules, for these years only women were members of the church. 1843 A new parsonage house was built at 106 Sound Beach Ave. The old parsonage on Arch Street, Riverside, was condemned. 1847 Our church sold some of its land to the New York and New Haven Railroad Company for their new railroad. 1869 Mr. Boulton was hired as Chorister for six months. 1872 Our part of town changed its name to “Sound Beach” as the railroad brought summer residents. 1874 Miss Minnie Brush was hired as our first Director of Music for $50 a year. 1877 Our first organ cost $182.24. It was a small parlor-type reed organ. Someone saved it from the 1895 fire by throwing it out the window. 1890 The church was renamed to “First Congregational Church of Greenwich”. We had 85 members, and 102 children in church school. 1895-96 The stone Meetinghouse, our fifth, was built for $21,453. 1895 The wooden church in the cemetery was destroyed by fire, including church school records and library. Silver, pewter, the organ and piano were saved. People worshiped in the school house until the stone Meetinghouse was finished. 1900’s 1900 The church bought the McAfee property for enlarging the cemetery. 1906 The church sold the 32 acre Grimes property for $31,363 to George A. McIntosh. 1919 We accepted Hubert Dalton’s offer of the house at the corner of Tomac and Forest Ave, as long as we paid to have it moved. The basement was dug and in 1920 the house was moved to “the northeast corner of our property”. It is our parsonage at 11 Forest Ave. Dalton wanted to make room for his new Dalton Tool factory, which later became the Electrolux factory. 1927 Allan Lorimer became pastor. He helped organize the Lions Club, was Grand Chaplain of Masonic Lodge, CT, and a founding member of the Greenwich Historical Society. 1928 Edwin Binney, Sr., gave Binney Park to the town. It was a swampy mire before.\n\nClick the photo to enlarge. Thank you to Coline Jenkins for the photo. 1930-1931 The June Binney Memorial Parish House (church offices and auditorium) was built. 1930 Mr. and Mrs. Robert Stewart gave the 12-bell chimes in the bell tower where there had been only one bell. 1930 The Women’s Guild was founded. It’s now called the Women’s Fellowship. They have raised a great deal of money for the church and charities. 1931 Our part of town changed its name from “Sound Beach” to “Old Greenwich”. 1935 Rev. Alden Mosshammer followed Rev. Lorimer. He worked with the youth group, Boy Scouts, YMCA, Community Chest, Lions Club, Men’s Club and put the church on a sound financial basis. 1938 The restoration of Tomac Cemetery was guided by Helen Binney Kitchel and the Old Greenwich Garden Club. 1940 The town tercentenary was celebrated at our church having a colonial-costumed-procession into the church on June 23rd. 1941 Rev. Vincent Daniels became pastor, making the church even more community minded. The church membership grew very large. 1943 The traditional Easter sunrise service at Greenwich Point beach began, with the youth group leading it almost continuously to today. 1943 Some people in Old Greenwich and Riverside and members of the First Congregational Church launched a small recreational program for teens in town. They had dances, Saturday morning movies, and athletic programs in our Binney Memorial Parish Hall. Thus began the Old Greenwich – Riverside Community Center (OGRCC). 1947 The first proclamation of Founders Day on July 18th was declared by Alice Stead Binney, President of the Greenwich Historical Society. 1950-62 Pastor Herman Reissig added new dimensions to the church’s social consciousness and outreach. 1951-52 The Education wing was added and dedicated. (The current lounge/kitchen/3rd floor/offices) The Meetinghouse was also enlarged to hold 250 people. 1953 We bought 15 Forest Ave, from Evelyn Billie Staby, as an extra parsonage, on 4/17/1953. 1955 Peg Roberts began the Nursery School for 3 and 4 year olds on weekdays. (Later it was renamed the Preschool.) 1956 Viola Worrell retired after 41 years as Director of Music. 1957 Percy Letts bought the stones from the demolished First Presbyterian Church at 90 Broad St, Stamford for our Meetinghouse expansion. 1959 We bought 20 Forest Ave, across the street, as an extra parsonage. 1961 Our church became affiliated with the United Church of Christ (UCC). 1960-62 The Meetinghouse was doubled in size and the pews were rotated 180 degrees. The big chancel window was added, as well as the windows along the chapel and narthex. The undercroft and educational facilities were expanded. 1960s Outreach projects were underway to help many others outside our church. 1963 Dr. Vincent Daniels died suddenly. 1964 The Rummage Room opened on Oct. 1, replacing the annual church rummage sale.
