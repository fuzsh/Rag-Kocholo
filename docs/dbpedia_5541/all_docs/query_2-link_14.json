        "text": "A Catholic University Rooted in Benedictine Values\n\nAs a Catholic liberal arts university rooted in centuries-old Benedictine values, our community is open and warm-hearted. We nurture relationship-building, respect and joy—regardless of your spiritual background.\n\nWe thrive in bringing together students, faculty and staff from all paths of life. We connect Saint Leo students to churches of various denominations in surrounding communities, and even help arrange transportation for Sunday worship. We host a Passover Seder, where Jewish students share the blessings of freedom. We invite all to enjoy our Christmas pageant, complete with caroling and a manger. We provide space for our Muslim students to practice the five daily prayers, and keep the doors to our intimate St. Jude's Chapel open for quiet contemplation whenever you need.\n\nLearn more about our history and Catholic roots.\n\nA Living-Learning-Serving Community\n\nOur humility and integrity extend beyond our chapel and classroom walls, and into our daily life. Service is the core of Saint Leo—kickball with the Boys & Girls Club, Make-A-Wish fundraisers, an educational partnership with migrant workers in area farms, alternative spring breaks to Haiti, Costa Rica, Alaska and a horse farm in upstate New York.\n\nAnd no matter what major you choose, all Saint Leo students take three electives in religion and philosophy. We've got tons of options. Spend one semester exploring the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. Next, open yourself to Eastern religions like Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism, or get hands-on in a youth ministry class. You may even find yourself investigating \"the mystery of existence\" via The Matrix and Bladerunner in Philosophy 101. Popcorn optional.\n\nUniversity Ministry\n\nHere at University Ministry, we strive to give Saint Leo students opportunities to become the best versions of themselves. We desire to embrace lives of authentic Catholic Christian community while walking with each other through every aspect and season of college life.\n\nWays to get involved:\n\nDaily Mass: Located in the Abbey Church. View our current Mass schedule here.\n\nService Trips and Alternative Spring Break: Organized through the year. Reach out to ministry@saintleo.edu with ideas!\n\nEucharistic Adoration with Praise and Worship Music: Located weekly in the Abbey Church. See our current schedule.\n\nConfession: Located in the Abbey Church. See our confession schedule during the academic year.\n\nMen’s and Women’s Group: Currently Monday at 7pm (Women’s located in TECO Hall, Men’s Located in Kirk 122), contact ministry@saintleo.edu to join.\n\nMusic Ministry: Work with our Music Minister Lucas Nocera on preparation and performance of music at Mass and other events!\n\nImago Dei: Pro-life Club\n\nTheology on Tap: Relaxed discussions of the big questions over pizza and drinks\n\nRite of Christian Initiation for Adults (RCIA): The process of becoming Catholic! (Or if you simply want to know more about the faith)\n\nSaint Leo Abbey\n\nSaint Leo University was founded by Benedictine monks in 1889, and Saint Leo Abbey is still active today. Yes, that's the church next to the library (it's magnificent, isn't it?!). Come join the monks for daily prayer and Mass. You can find their schedule located on the link above.\n\nThe Abbey offers a sacred space for you to come and enjoy quiet reflection and conversation with our Lord. Catholicism is a gift we share with you regardless of your background! We hope you experience the gift that Saint Leo Abbey is. Whether in the community of friends, walking the shores of Lake Jovita, or enjoying any number of spots on campus that invite reflection."
