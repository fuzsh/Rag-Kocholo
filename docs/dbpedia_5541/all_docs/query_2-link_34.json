        "text": "The Pepperdine community was saddened by the passing of Mark Kirk, a member of the Pepperdine University Board of Regents, on June 13 at age 55.\n\n“The passing of Mark Kirk has hit all who knew him very hard,” said Pepperdine president Andrew K. Benton. “He was a delightful friend, wise counselor, and peerless example. His service on our governing board was impactful and indelible; however, it is the way he related to everyone on such a personal and profound level that will never be forgotten. We love his family and hold each of them in prayer.”\n\nKirk, a CPA, began his career in public accounting with KPMG and served as an audit manager with Deloitte & Touche. He served as president, chief operating officer, and a director of HMI Industries, Inc., and was senior officer, chief financial officer, and director of Anchor Glass, Grimes Aerospace, and Facet Enterprises, Inc. A member of the Board of Regents since 2010, Kirk retired in 2009 as a partner with Linsalata Capital Partners, a private equity investment firm based in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nHe received his bachelor of business administration degree in accounting from Harding University and completed the Advanced Executive Program of the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.\n\nKirk is survived by his wife, Robin, and three children; Allison, a 2013 Pepperdine graduate; Alan, a 2010 Pepperdine graduate; and Ashley, a graduate of Wheaton College."
