        "text": "Contemporary Christian music group\n\n4Him was an American contemporary Christian group founded in 1990 in Mobile, Alabama. The group has ten Dove awards, a Grammy nomination and three certified gold albums to their credit. The group was inducted into Alabama's Music Hall of Fame, following the awarding of The Governor's Achievement Award. The group has also been featured performers for popular Christian Evangelist crusaders, Billy Graham and Luis Palau.\n\n4Him disbanded in 2006 to pursue individual careers of ministry and music. They have released 12 studio albums which have produced 27 number one singles.\n\nThe group has made sporadic reunion appearances since 2009.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nAndy Chrisman, Mark Harris, Marty Magehee, and Kirk Sullivan originally met when they sang together in Truth, a Contemporary Christian vocal group founded in the late 1960s and directed by Roger Breland. Truth had a rotating roster of four male and four female vocalists. After three representatives from Benson Records attended several Truth concerts in the late 1980s during which Andy, Mark, Marty, and Kirk performed, Benson approached the quartet saying that they wanted to use the guys to create a new male four-member vocal group under the Benson label. \"Where There Is Faith\", their first single, stayed at No. 1 on the charts for eight weeks, two months before 4Him left Truth. Releasing their self-titled debut in 1990, they blended the traditions of Christian music's past, with modern pop production and practical lyrics.\n\nIn 1996, with the release of The Message, 4Him changed their overall sound in an effort to keep pushing the creative limits of the group. The guys replaced the over-the-top orchestrations and choral vocal arrangements with a stripped down, acoustic band approach where one of the guys would sing lead and the other three would sing backing vocals. On 1998's Obvious, each member took more ownership of their music – becoming more involved in the production and songwriting aspects.\n\nBy 2004, all four of the guys reevaluated the future of the ministry. After close to seventeen years together, the members of 4Him decided to embark on solo careers.[1] On September 23, 2006, they performed their final concert at Cottage Hill Baptist Church in Mobile, AL, the city where 4Him's 17-year journey first started. At that concert, various individuals (including family members, record producers, management, and Truth founder Roger Breland) were recognized for their contributions to 4Him's ministry.\n\nAfter disbandment\n\n[edit]\n\nAndy Chrisman\n\n[edit]\n\nAndy Chrisman released his freshman solo effort One in 2004, and is worship pastor at Church on the Move in Tulsa, Oklahoma.[2] In 2008, he, along with the Church on the Move Praise Band, released Beautiful Name, a live worship CD.\n\nMark Harris\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2005, Mark Harris released The Line Between the Two. In 2007, Harris won a GMA Dove Award in the category of Inspirational Song of the Year for \"Find Your Wings\". On September 25, 2007, he released his second album Windows and Walls on INO Records. On October 13, 2011, Harris released his third album Stronger In The Broken Places on Stylos Records. In 2012, Harris' song, \"When We're Together\" was featured in the film, Courageous. Until mid-2013, he served as artist-in-residence and worship pastor at Bay Community Church outside Mobile, Alabama. He currently serves as executive worship pastor at Gateway Church in Southlake, Texas.[3][failed verification]\n\nKirk Sullivan\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2010, Kirk Sullivan released his independent solo release Timeless on his website. Timeless contains \"Get Down Mountain\" (previously featured on the Encore album), a new reworked arrangement of his trademark song \"The Basics of Life\", and a bonus track of a song recorded when he was twelve years old.\n\nMarty Magehee\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2008, Marty Magehee released his independent solo release, Open, on his website. The first single, \"Eyes Wide Open\", was released to Christian radio in May 2008. The album also included the song \"Runaway Train\", which appeared on 4Him's final CD, Encore. He is also producing albums for other artists. In 2011, Magehee is on the faculty of Valor Christian High School in Highlands Ranch, Colorado, teaching courses in Worship Band, Studio Recording, Beats and Loops, and Songwriting.[4]\n\nReunions\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter nearly five years apart, the quartet made their first reunion on the K-Love Friends and Family Cruise in January 2009.[5] A one-off concert in West Monroe, Louisiana took place in March, and another reunion happened on Kathy Troccoli's \"KT and Friends Cruise\" to Alaska in June 2010.[6] In early 2013, they performed several concerts on a tour dubbed \"With One Voice\" together with the group Avalon and solo Christian singer songwriter Cindy Morgan. In September 2015, they performed an 11-city 25th anniversary tour.[7][non-primary source needed]\n\nDiscography\n\n[edit]\n\n1990: 4Him\n\n1991: Face the Nation\n\n1992: The Basics of Life\n\n1993: The Season of Love (Christmas)\n\n1994: The Ride\n\n1996: The Message\n\n1998: Obvious\n\n2000: Hymns: A Place of Worship\n\n2001: Walk On\n\n2003: Visible\n\n2006: Encore...
