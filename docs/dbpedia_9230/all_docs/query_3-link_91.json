Summitville catalyzed national debates about the environmental effects of modern mining activities, and became the focus of arguments for proposed revisions to the 1872 Mining Law governing mining activities on public lands.\n\nAerial view of the Summitville Mine\n\nSummitville stats\n\nLocation: Rio Grande Headwaters\n\nElevation: 3,800 m\n\nSnowfall: 7-11 meters per year\n\nGold was first discovered at Summitville in 1870. Significant gold production from underground workings occurred prior to 1900. In 1903, the Reynolds adit was driven to drain the underground workings and serve as an ore haulage tunnel. Production occurred sporadically through the 1950's. The district received some exploration attention in the 1970's as a copper prospect, but no mining for copper was pursued.\n\nGold, discovered in 1870\n\npopulation grew to 700\n\n112 stamping/crushing machines\n\nabandoned in early 1900's\n\nmost of the gold harvested\n\ndecrease in price of gold\n\ntoo much snow:\n\navalanches\n\nlandslides\n\nice\n\ncave-ins\n\nSimilar to many historic gold mining districts in the western United States, Summitville received renewed interest in the early 1980's due to technological advances that allow extraction of low-grade ores with cyanide heap leach techniques. In 1984, Summitville Consolidated Mining Company, Inc. (SCMCI), initiated open pit mining of gold ore from rocks surrounding the historic underground workings, where gold concentrations had been too low to be economic for the underground mining operations. Ore from the pit was crushed and placed on a heap leach pad overlying a protective liner. Cyanide solutions were sprinkled onto the heap and trickled down through the crushed ore, dissolving the gold. The processing solutions were then collected from the base of the heap leach pile, and the gold was chemically extracted from the solutions.\n\nCyanide Leach Process Notes\n\n1984\n\nFriedland of SCMCI applies for mining permit at Summitville for cyanide-leach mining.\n\nPermit rejected by CO State Mining Regulatory Agency.\n\nFriedland complains to state legislature\n\nState legislature sides with SCMCI.\n\nDecides all permits must be evaluated within 6 months or or automatically approved\n\nMining regulatory personnel reduced to 7 people.\n\nResults in almost automatic approval of any mining permit\n\n1985\n\nSCMCI issued permit to mine at Summitville\n\nStarted construction of large-scale open-pit gold mine\n\nSCMCI posts $3,000,000 bond.\n\n1986\n\nHDPE liner for leach pad laid down by subcontractor\n\nThe purpose of the liner was to prevent leakage of the cyanide solution out of the heap.\n\nliner damaged during construction by avalanches: torn and shifted\n\nSubcontractor tried to fix liner\n\nSCMCI would not allow the subcontractor to fix the liner\n\nsubcontractor sued SCMCI so they could install liner correctly and lost\n\ndamages liner remained and leached cyanide\n\n1987-1990\n\nLeach pads were 73 acres in extent\n\none pile > 190'\n\nDrainage for leach pad: none\n\nIdeas was to have ET = input once full\n\nET overstimated\n\nSnowfall underestimated\n\nnon-permitted discharge of excess water occurred\n\nPermission granted by state to discharge excess water.

Farmers have reported water quality problems on land irrigated by the Alamosa River. Cleanup costs are over $85 million to date (already $25 million over the 1995 estimate) and are projected to reach $165 million by 1999.\n\nWho pays for this continual financial hemorrhage? Until now, the polluter pays -- the company responsible for dumping the toxic chemicals. That's the law under the existing federal Superfund law. But if the chemical and insurance industries and their allies in Congress, such as the mining industry, have their way, the law will change and states and communities around the country will get struck with these environmental and financial messes.\n\nCompanies responsible for dumping their chemical waste all over America have resisted owning up to their financial liability, or the damage to the health and safety of citizens their dumping has caused. Rather than taking responsibility for the mess they created in the first place, big polluters and their insurers are lobbying Congress to let them off the hook. By having Congress weaken health protections and limit their liability, these wealthy corporations will successfully shift the costs, uncertainties and risks of cleaning up toxic-waste sites onto the backs of the American public.\n\nBills to \"reform\" Superfund have been introduced by Congressman Michael Oxley(R-OH) and Senator Robert Smith(R-NH).\n\nBoth proposals would achieve polluters' two major goals: gut the polluter pays principle of Superfund, and weaken the cleanup requirements at contaminated sites. Both bills would eliminate liability for entire classes of polluters, including many of the wealthiest corporations in America. While the federal budget is being slashed, at the expense of public health and environmental protections, the Oxley and Smith bills provide polluters with relief at the public's expense.\n\nIt is no coincidence that a recent Citizen Action analysis of PAC contributions found that corporations which would benefit from gutting Superfund, including GE, Exxon and ASARCO, gave nearly $6.5 million to members of the House of Representatives during 1995. Now they expect to recoup their investment.\n\nRepresentatives Wayne Allard and Scott McInnis from Colorado accepted $47,216 collectively from these PACs. This is especially troubling since Colorado has some 225 sites contaminated by hazardous substance, including 17 that are considered among the worst in the nation, including the Summitville mine poison pit.\n\nThe House and Senate bills call for the use of the \"most cost-effective\" (cheapest) methods of cleaning up dumpsites. But in many instances what counts as a \"cleanup\" is simply preventing the public from using the land or drinking the water. Although that may be cost-effective for the polluters, it's a bad deal for the community. In many instances, a \"cleanup\" will mean simply fencing off a contaminated site and handing out bottled water to the nearby residents.\n\nIn addition, the bills in Congress will make it difficult, if not impossible, for the public to recover for damages to natural resources like groundwater, wilderness, fish and wildlife, endangered species and oceans. This is a huge giveaway to a handful of chemical, oil, and mining companies who will save hundreds of millions of dollars avoiding environmental restoration.\n\n\"Reforming\" Superfund in these ways would send a clear message to the American public: What matters most to Congress is the wealth of the chemical, mining, and oil industries and their insurers, not the health of communities. It seems that the top legislative priority is to protect corporate profits rather than the property or drinking-water supplies of the millions of people unlucky enough to live near a Superfund site.\n\nThe polluter lobby claims that the Superfund program has been too \"costly,\" particularly because of lawyers' fees. This is little more than a carefully contrived smokescreen. In fact, the majority of legal costs incurred by complaining corporations have been from legal battles with their own insurance companies or other polluters over who should have to pay the cleanup bills.\n\nSure, the Superfund program has its problems -- too much delay, not enough public participation -- but the solution is to streamline Superfund, not gut it. It should be easier for the polluters to pay for safe and effective cleanups, not harder.\n\nRepresentatives Allard and McInnis will help decide if these bailout bills for polluters and insurers will pass the House or Senate. Polls consistently show that most Americans oppose weakening our environmental and public health laws. Will our representatives listen to the people, or the special interests?\n\nWill the polluters pay for timely, thorough Superfund cleanups, or will the public \"pay\" for slower and less effective cleanups?\n\nWe'll soon find out.\n\nCarmi McLean and Scott Ingvoldstad are policy analysts for the Clean Water Action organization, headquartered in Washington, D.C., and with an office in Boulder.\n\nPlease help us to improve the Aspen Times Online.\n\nClick on the appropriate button below to provide any comments or feedback. - Times Highlights -"
