        "text": "Our History\n\nIn 2001, the Town of Mamakating, at the direction of Supervisor Mary Barbuti, purchased the former Summitville schoolhouse (ca. 1854) from the Ellenville School District in order to create a Mamakating Historical Society and Museum.\n\nJohn Masten was appointed President by the new Board of Directors, and Bernice Masten was appointed curator and archivist for the new museum.\n\nLater, Charles and Helene Goetschius assumed these responsibilities. The Masten and Goetschius officers with contacts throughout the Town of Mamakating and Sullivan County enabled the museum to acquire important historical artifacts and information on the D&H Canal, the O&W Railroad, various historic commercial enterprises, and early settlers and pioneers of the town. When Charles and Helene retired, Karen Tolcz was appointed President of the Historical Society and Museum. She works with a dedicated staff of volunteers including Danielle Berg and Donna Durland.\n\nThrough the years, the Boards of Directors and many members have worked very hard to enable the museum to research, collect and document the Town's history, and to educate members of the community. A major bequest from historian Radford Curdy enriched our archives with books, photographs and historic postcards.\n\nThe Museum is located at 136 Summitville Road in Summitville NY 12781. Phone 845-888-2851 (summer only) and 845-423-0153 (year round). We are open from May through November on Tuesdays from 10 to 3 pm. We will open on Saturday July 31, Aug 28 and Sep 25. There are no salaried employees and the offices are staff entirely by volunteers. Membership dues (and donations) help fund overhead costs and enable us to purchase needed supplies. Dues are $10 for individuals and $15 for families. They may be sent to the MHS at PO Box 163, Summitville, NY 12781.\n\nWe hold two all-member meetings each year, as well as a potluck gathering, a bakeless bake sale, and events with speakers featuring local history. We'd be pleased to have you join us."
