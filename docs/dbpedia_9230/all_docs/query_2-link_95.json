        "text": "Story Index\n\nMy attention in this piece will mainly focus on my experience this past summer at a place called Camp Summit. Camp Summit is a sleep-away camp located in up-state Wurtsburo, New York. I spent two months at Camp Summit as an \"Inter-Girls\" counselor, or counselor for twelve year old girls. Camp Summit is a coed camp catering to children from Long Island, New York. To share with you what this experience has provoked in me I find it appropriate to site various journal entries written at different points of my summer exprience at Camp Summit. This journal may skip from very happy times to very confused and angyr times. I will begin my unraveling with my arrival at Camp Summit....\n\n24 June 1996- I'm here at Camp Summit in Wurtsburo, New York. It's very difdifferent here from Chicago. Where about 2,000 feet above sea level. My ears pop every time I go up and down the hills. I enjoy S meeting the different types of people here( London, England, Ireland, and New Yorkers).They all have very different accents. The London men like to sing and they think U.S. version of highschool prom is unique. They get their stereotypes of Americans from T.V. sitcoms like \" Saved by The Bell\". Some of the men are very obnoxious in their silly ways. I find much humor S in their imiaturity. We have been here a day less of a week. Many of the girls here are home sick. I could imagine I would be too if I only focused on the people I missed at home. The children will arrive tomorrow. I look forward S to their youth and laughter. Story Index\n\n26 June 1996- The children just arrived yesterday(bus loads). Most of the children are from Long Island, NY. They are very priviledged children who really have no concept of the value of money. They have no idea that every child is not like them. Some children do not know how to make their beds, seams very strange to me. For the most part they just want attention. I have girld going into 7th grade. Most of them are nice young girls. This summer is going to be a great S learning experience.\n\n02 July 1996- The girls are go-carting as we speak. Some counselors here and myself had a group complain session the other day. We all complain that we have no rights and no free time. A bunch of counselors have already quit. This is not an easy job and sometimes not fun. It's not easy to be treated like a child. S I am not one and expect to be treated as an adult. They have a real problem treating their employees with respect here. They expect us to be super human, and I refuse to kiss butt. PS- It's still the first week, hopefully it will get better!!! Story Index\n\n11 July 1996- I just wrote Desiree a Birthday card. I can't believe I forgot S her birthday. This place has turned me into a scatter brain. We went White Water Rafting on Tuesday. We went to Pennsylavnia which was three hours away from Camp. I believe we passed through the Pocono Mountains, \"The Home Of The Honeymoon\". The rapids S were not all that exiting. I had expected a little more danger. It was agreat lesson in team cooperation though most of these girls don't know the meaning. By the way, I still cannot wait to go home. S Iv'e met some wonderful friends here, but this place is a horrible excuse for employment. The way they treat their employees is absolutely unacceptable. I will write a letter of complaint when I return home. Moreover I will sue them if I find a reason.\n\n16 July 1996- Oliver quit camp today. He said he could not stand by and watch children be abused. He reported counselors for abuse, and the counselors threatened him. Neil also threatened to fire him if he didn't keep his mouth shut. S This place is pretty sick like that. Most people are afraid to acknowledge anything wrong here. S I was very upset yesterday and will probably be for the rest of the summer. S Oliver was a great guy and I hated to see him go. He said he was going to try to find a youth hostile in the city. All the good employees and the real people have left. I can hardly blame them. S The only great thing is that I made alot of new friends. One's I have grown close to and hopefully will stay close to. S I hope Oliver takes the time to write me. I would like to know he is OK. It will be hard, but I hope to keep in touch with him. I really can't wait till this summer is over. Story Index\n\n29 July 1996- I received a letter from Oliver yesterday. S I was quite exited, it put me in a good mood. He is at a camp in New York City for inner city kids. Quite different from this place. He said he stayed at a youth hostile for a few days before \"Camp America\" placed him. Me, Michelle, Ronny, and Catherine may go to Boston for a few days after camp. I don'y really have the money, but what the hell, you only live once. This place really doesn't bother me anymore. I don't like it, but it doesn't bother me. The counselors her are very different, namely Jaimee and Stacey. Some of them have physical beauty but are ugly people inside. Very cold hearted which would explain why I can't relate to them! They are also extremely opinionated at anybody's emotional expense. I believe there is a time and a place for everything. They do not!!\n\n09 August 1996- O.K. we went on our overnight trip. What an experience....Me, Michelle, Ronny, Catherine, Anthony, Yon, Craig, and Mike. It took us five hours to travel an hour and a half away. We were drinking so it didn't quite seam that long. S Craig is a complete idiot, locked himself ixn the van, and locked us out. We went to \"Action Park\" after we slept for all of three hours. I took it upon myself to sleep in the van during the day for two hours sweating buckets. We then left to drive to Middletown for Pizza Hut. Well we stopped in every town on the way and never made it to Pizza Hut. What a shock. S I was quite disturbed so I decided not to talk in fear of what would come out of my mouth if I had. We ate at what was equivalent to a Denny's, OOOh thrill. Anyway, did I tell you I'm not going to Boston. S I just really need to go home.. Story Index\n\n21 August 1996- Ok. so I'm back home. S A better transition than I thought it would be. I'm finding it hard to get back into the swing of things as I feel my absence has somehow impacted my relationships with people. Sigle tells me he noticed I'm more quiet than before. I can't decide if this is a good or a bad thing. Do I really give a shit? I really don't feel like talking, and when I do, I will. PS. Remember to keep in touch with Michelle, Oliver, Jaimee, and Mike. In that order!!!\n\nA note on the journal entries.... I haven't really given camp much thought until now. I still can't decide what it is about camp that made me so incredibly unhappy. I do know however that I have no desire to repeat the experience, nor to really talk about the experience to those who were not there. Camp Summit provoked some of the most powerful emotions in me. At times I was more happy than I had ever been, and at times I felt more sad than I had ever imagined. Some people don't ever get the chance to experience such extreme emotions, I'm glad I had the chance. On a happy note, I did manage to keep in touch with Michelle, Jaimee, and Mike. Oliver on the other hand, I have yet to hear from!!
