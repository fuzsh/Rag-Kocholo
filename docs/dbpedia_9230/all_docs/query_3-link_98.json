        "text": "Landmark Colors\n\nFive new colors have been added to our Thin Brick line, offering a rustic, handcrafted look in brick surfaces.\n\nPatterned after the hand-made brick of 18th Century Williamsburg, of Jefferson’s Monticello and of Federal Period buildings in the early canal towns of Ohio, the Landmark Series was created from brick molds taken from many of the structures located in and around Ohio’s historic village of Hanoverton. The color names within this series reflect the early American background of five towns, steeped in the lore of Ohio’s Sandy & BeaverCanal.\n\nEach of the five colors in this series has a wide range of shades, blended at the factory, to create a unique and distinct color effect. For a one of a kind, custom look, a factory blend of any combina­tion of these five standard production colors is available.\n\nThin Brick is made from select clays and shale chosen for their relative purity, fired strength and proven service characteristics. Summitville has been a leading manufacturer of brick products for over 90 years and these products have passed the test of time, in quality and durability.\n\nSize:Standard production is 2-1/4\" x 7 5/8\" x 11/16\". Corners are available, 11/16\" thick."
