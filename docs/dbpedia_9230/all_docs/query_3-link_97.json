        "text": "Money woes,\n\ncleanup costs\n\nerode worth\n\nFile photo by Erin Smith\n\nThe Summitville Mine, located in the San Juan Mountains 25 miles south of Del Norte, will cost more to clean up than was extracted in gold over the past 120 years.\n\nFORT COLLINS — It would take all the gold extracted from the Summitville Gold Mine in the San Juan Mountains over its 120-year life to cover the cost of cleaning up the mine.\n\nBut the cost of not cleaning it up could threaten the San Luis Valley's water quality, wildlife and agriculture.\n\nThose are some of the revelations from a recent workshop at Colorado State University on the Environmental Protection Agency's cleanup at Summitville, located 25 miles south of Del Norte.\n\nTo date, about $60 million has been spent to clean up the site, but more than $100 million will be spent before the effort is completed.\n\nBetween 1873 and 1949, Summitville yielded about 240,000 troy ounces of gold, worth an estimated $7 million at the time of production, according to a study presented at the workshop.\n\nFrom 1984 to 1992, Summitville Consolidated Mining extracted another 249,000 troy ounces of gold, using a cyanide heap leaching process. By that time, gold averaged $325 per ounce, making the modern production value about $81 million.\n\nThe mine became an EPA Superfund site after the Summitville Consolidated Mining Co., a subsidiary of Galactic Resources Ltd. of Canada, ceased cleanup efforts at the location, just two miles east of the Continental Divide, on Dec. 15, 1992.\n\nSummitville had been under scrutiny for almost 18 months prior to the company's bankruptcy announcement.\n\nThe gold-mining company's work stoppage came in the wake of Galactic's notification to the state of Colorado on Dec. 1, 1992, that it was declaring bankruptcy and would abandon the mine operation as of Dec. 16, 1992.\n\nAt Colorado's request, the EPA sent an emergency response team to the site to determine what should be done.\n\nA paper submitted to the 1995 Summitville Forum by Colorado Division of Minerals and Geology officials James A. Pendleton, Harry Posey and Michael B. Long, explained that the water level in the cyanide heap leach pad stood just five feet below an emergency spillway.\n\nNormal winter precipitation would have caused it to overtop the spillway, they noted.\n\nThe result would have sent contaminated water into Cropsy Creek, then into Wightman Fork, a tributary of the Alamosa River.\n\nWhen the EPA began its efforts, it was during a severe winter. Summitville, at 11,500 feet, is known for its long, cold winters (with snowfall often as great as 400 inches) and short cool summers.\n\nResearch showed that during June 1986, the first month of Summitville Consolidated's processing, cyanide-bearing fluids were detected seeping through liners.\n\n\"Records from mid-1987 through the late fall of 1992 show that Summitville mine operations suffered a series of broken pump-back pipelines and springs erupting from beneath the heap leach, resulting in releases of cyanide-contaminated fluids,\" the paper said.\n\nGeochemist James Erdman of the U.S. Geological Survey said the $90 million in gold taken from Summitville took $200 million to produce.\n\nCoincidentally, the three major crops in the San Luis Valley — potatoes, hay and barley — bring in $200 million each year."
