        "text": "Overview\n\nSummitville is a tiny town located in the state of Indiana. With a population of 989 people and just one neighborhood, Summitville is the 323rd largest community in Indiana. Summitville has a large stock of pre-World War II architecture, making it one of the older and more historic towns in the country.\n\nOccupations and Workforce\n\nBecause occupations involving physical labor dominate the local economy, Summitville is generally considered to be a blue-collar town. 44.68% of the Summitville workforce is employed in blue-collar occupations, compared to the national average of 27.7%. Overall, Summitville is a town of professionals, service providers, and construction workers and builders. There are especially a lot of people living in Summitville who work in food service (11.90%), sales jobs (9.19%), and healthcare (7.72%).\n\nAlso of interest is that Summitville has more people living here who work in computers and math than 95% of the places in the US.\n\nSetting & Lifestyle\n\nThe overall crime rate in Summitville is one of the lowest in the US. This makes it one of the safer places to live in the country in terms of crime.\n\nSummitville is a small town, and as such doesn't have a public transit system that people use to get to and from their jobs every day.\n\nDemographics\n\nThe percentage of people in Summitville with college degrees is quite a bit lower than the national average for cities and towns of 21.84%: just 11.50% of people over 25 have a bachelor's degree or advanced degree.\n\nThe per capita income in Summitville in 2022 was $21,860, which is low income relative to Indiana and the nation. This equates to an annual income of $87,440 for a family of four. However, Summitville contains both very wealthy and poor people as well.\n\nThe people who call Summitville home describe themselves as belonging to a variety of racial and ethnic groups. The greatest number of Summitville residents report their race to be White, followed by Black or African-American. Important ancestries of people in Summitville include German, English, Irish, Dutch, and French.\n\nThe most common language spoken in Summitville is English. Other important languages spoken here include Italian and Spanish.\n\nThe Neighbors\n\nHow wealthy a neighborhood is, from very wealthy, to middle income, to low income is very formative with regard to the personality and character of a neighborhood. Equally important is the rate of people, particularly children, who live below the federal poverty line. In some wealthy gated communities, the areas immediately surrounding can have high rates of childhood poverty, which indicates other social issues. NeighborhoodScout's analysis reveals both aspects of income and poverty for this neighborhood.\n\nThe neighbors in the neighborhood in Summitville are middle-income, making it a moderate income neighborhood. NeighborhoodScout's exclusive analysis reveals that this neighborhood has a higher income than 46.2% of the neighborhoods in America. With 19.2% of the children here below the federal poverty line, this neighborhood has a higher rate of childhood poverty than 67.6% of U.S. neighborhoods.\n\nThe old saying \"you are what you eat\" is true. But it is also true that you are what you do for a living. The types of occupations your neighbors have shape their character, and together as a group, their collective occupations shape the culture of a place.\n\nIn the neighborhood, 38.1% of the working population is employed in manufacturing and laborer occupations. The second most important occupational group in this neighborhood is executive, management, and professional occupations, with 31.4% of the residents employed. Other residents here are employed in sales and service jobs, from major sales accounts, to working in fast food restaurants (18.7%), and 10.9% in clerical, assistant, and tech support occupations.\n\nEthnicity / Ancestry\n\nCulture is the shared learned behavior of peoples. Undeniably, different ethnicities and ancestries have different cultural traditions, and as a result, neighborhoods with concentrations of residents of one or another ethnicities or ancestries will express those cultures. It is what makes the North End in Boston so fun to visit for the Italian restaurants, bakeries, culture, and charm, and similarly, why people enjoy visiting Chinatown in San Francisco.\n\nIn the neighborhood in Summitville, IN, residents most commonly identify their ethnicity or ancestry as German (23.2%). There are also a number of people of English ancestry (18.2%), and residents who report Irish roots (10.2%), and some of the residents are also of Mexican ancestry (2.7%), along with some Scottish ancestry residents (2.6%), among others.\n\nGetting to Work\n\nHow you get to work – car, bus, train or other means – and how much of your day it takes to do so is a large quality of life and financial issue. Especially with gasoline prices rising and expected to continue doing so, the length and means of one's commute can be a financial burden. Some neighborhoods are physically located so that many residents have to drive in their own car, others are set up so many walk to work, or can take a train, bus, or bike. The greatest number of commuters in neighborhood spend between 30 and 45 minutes commuting one-way to work (32.2% of working residents), which is at or a bit above the average length of a commute across all U.S. neighborhoods.\n\nHere most residents (88.1%) drive alone in a private automobile to get to work. In a neighborhood like this, as in most of the nation, many residents find owning a car useful for getting to work."
