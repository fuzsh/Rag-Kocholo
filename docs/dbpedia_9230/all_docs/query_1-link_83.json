        "text": "SUMMITVILLE – The mayor and council still remain at odds over his contention that this Columbiana County village is heading toward financial insolvency and should be dissolved.\n\nMayor Robert Marra first raised the issue at council’s July meeting when he invited a representative from the state auditor’s office to explain the dissolution process. He was criticized for not telling council members of this in advance, with council indicating it favored keeping the village of 135 intact.\n\nCouncilman Fred May, speaking after last week’s meeting, said they still feel that way and believe the village is heading in the right financial direction, thanks in large part to new Fiscal Officer Bonnie Moore, who has been able to straighten out the village’s books.\n\n“Everyone on council is strongly opposed to what the mayor wants to do,” he said.\n\nMoore took over in November and the village has begun running in the black for the first time in a while, May said, adding they are also exploring ways to cut spending.\n\n“No, I do not believe we will run out of money,” he said."
