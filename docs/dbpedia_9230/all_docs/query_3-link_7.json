It is equidistance to all the big surrounding towns, and an easy drive to get to and from town. there's not a lot to do in Summitville, but there is a gas station, a park, an elementary school, a fire and police department, a library, and a new restaurant. I think Summitville is pretty safe too, and a good atmosphere to live in."
