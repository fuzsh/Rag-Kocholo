Pursuant to the Court’s Order of 25 April 2023, the Republic of Armenia (“Armenia”) submits this Written Statement of Observations and Submissions on the Preliminary Objections of the Republic of Azerbaijan (“Written Statement” and “Azerbaijan”, respectively). The Written Statement supplements the submissions of law and evidence set out in Armenia’s Memorial of 23 January 2023 (“Memorial”) and Application of 16 September 2021 (“Application”).\n\n2. Azerbaijan requests that the Court issue a judgment “[d]ismissing Armenia’s Application in its entirety” on the alleged ground that “none of Armenia’s claims is properly before the Court” because Armenia has purportedly “failed to comply with the negotiation precondition required by Article 22” of the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination (the “CERD”).1 In addition, or in the alternative, Azerbaijan requests that the Court dismiss Armenia’s claims concerning Azerbaijan’s acts of murder, torture, inhumane treatment, detention, and enforced disappearances of ethnic Armenians on the ground that the Court allegedly “lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae” because those claims purportedly “fall outside the scope of CERD”.2 Azerbaijan’s preliminary objections are meritless and must be rejected.\n\n3. Azerbaijan’s first preliminary objection—that Armenia allegedly did not comply with the negotiation precondition required by Article 22—fails for a single reason: after exchanging more than 40 pieces of correspondence and engaging in no fewer than seven rounds of bilateral meetings, the Parties’ basic positions had not evolved at all. In its very first response to Armenia’s notice of dispute,\n\n1 Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Armenia v. Azerbaijan), Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan (21 April 2023) (hereinafter “Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan”), para. 71.\n\n2 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 71.\n\n2\n\nAzerbaijan flatly stated that it “rejects Armenia’s allegations”.3 And in the Parties’ last meeting nearly one year later, Azerbaijan yet again expressed its “categorical rejection of Armenia’s claims”.4 In its Order of 7 December 2021 on Armenia’s first request for provisional measures (“7 December 2021 Order”), the Court itself observed that “it seems that [the Parties’] positions on the alleged non-compliance by Azerbaijan with its obligations under CERD remained unchanged and that their negotiations had reached an impasse”.5 Azerbaijan’s preliminary objections not only ignore that fact, but provide no reason for the Court to reach a different conclusion now.\n\n4. Azerbaijan nonetheless suggests that Armenia’s efforts to negotiate a resolution to the dispute were not genuine and that it should have continued to negotiate notwithstanding Azerbaijan’s persistent categorical rejection of Armenia’s claims. But the seriousness with which Armenia took the negotiations is apparent from the dozens of exchanges on the record before the Court. Armenia could not be expected to negotiate with Azerbaijan ad infinitum when the latter not only continued to deny any and all wrongdoing but also continued to take additional measures—such as opening its patently Armenophobic “Military Trophies Park”—that further violated the CERD and aggravated the Parties’ dispute. Much less could Armenia be expected to continue negotiating when, as the Court found in its 7 December 2021 Order, there was “urgency, in the sense that\n\n3 Letter from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Armenia (8 December 2020) (Application of Armenia, Annex 14).\n\n4 Note Verbale from the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Armenia to the United Nations Office and other International Organizations in Geneva to the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Azerbaijan to the United Nations Office and other International Organizations in Geneva, No. 2203/1415/2021 (10 September 2021), p. 1 (Application of Armenia, Annex 61).\n\n5 Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Armenia v.

Reports 2021, p. 361, paras. 40-41.\n\n3\n\nthere [was] a real and imminent risk” of prejudice to plausible CERD rights.\n\n6 In such circumstances, Azerbaijan’s claims that Armenia “prematurely” broke off negotiations or sought to use the Court to “wage a public media campaign against Azerbaijan”7 fail.\n\n5. Azerbaijan’s second preliminary objection—that the Court lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae over Armenia’s claims concerning Azerbaijan’s acts of murder, torture, inhumane treatment, detention, and enforced disappearances of ethnic Armenians—is as baseless as its first. On any view, the acts complained of are “capable of” constituting “racial discrimination”8 and “fall within the provisions” of the CERD.9\n\n6. Azerbaijan itself acknowledges that acts that violate international humanitarian law (“IHL”) may also violate the CERD but nevertheless asserts that “the mere fact that the peoples of two States at war often are primarily of different ethnic origins does not, without more, transform every act of war into a distinction ‘based on’ ethnic origin”.10 Armenia agrees. Armenia does not agree, however, with Azerbaijan’s assertion that the allegations in question “potentially raise\n\n6 Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Armenia v.

To begin with, many of the acts complained of were accompanied by explicit expressions of racial hatred (as opposed to hostility toward persons of a particular nationality), such as “f⁎⁎⁎ your people”,12 “they are not human beings”13 and “we will eliminate their race”.14 Perpetrators also repeatedly referred to their victims as “dogs”—a derogatory slur for ethnic Armenians popularized by President Aliyev and which Azerbaijan itself acknowledges has a “possible ethnic dimension”.15 One Azerbaijani serviceman openly boasted that he committed atrocities against ethnic Armenians, proclaiming: “Armenians of the entire world, today I f⁎⁎⁎⁎⁎ your mother. F⁎ggots”.16 It is impossible to interpret a reference to Armenians “of the entire world” as anything other than a reference to Armenians as an ethnic group. Such statements should not be surprising—the Memorial shows how Azerbaijan has systematically propagated hatred towards ethnic Armenians, who are portrayed in Azerbaijani school textbooks as “genetic enemies”17 and\n\n11 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 8.\n\n12 Video showing the execution of an hors de combat Armenian serviceman (certified translation from Azerbaijani) [WARNING: GRAPHIC] (Memorial of Armenia, Annex 131).\n\n13 Video showing an Azerbaijani soldier shooting at a dead Armenian soldier’s body (contains annotations, such as certified subtitles in English) [WARNING: GRAPHIC] (confidential) (Memorial of Armenia, Annex 169).\n\n14 Video 1 showing mutilation of Armenian corpses by Azerbaijani soldiers (certified translation from Azerbaijani) [WARNING: GRAPHIC] (confidential) (Memorial of Armenia, Annex 134).\n\n15 Cf. Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 45 (“Even in the limited instances where alleged Azerbaijani servicemembers used derogatory language with a possible ethnic dimension—for example, a reference to ‘Armenian dogs’ alongside other insulting language, this evidences hostility between opposing soldiers at war, not discrimination on the basis of ethnic origin”).\n\n16 Propaganda video compiling images of Azerbaijani atrocities (September 2022), 00:55-01:01 (certified translation from Russian) (confidential) (Memorial of Armenia, Annex 148).\n\n17 “Armenophobia in the Textbooks Used in Azerbaijan: History, Grade 11”, Azerichild.info, available at https://azerichild.education/en/class-11-tarix.html (last accessed 1 December 2022), PDF p. 2 (Memorial of Armenia, Annex 104).\n\n5\n\n“scoundrels” with “the blood of the devil in their veins”.\n\n18 There is simply no basis for regarding such statements as directed solely at Armenian nationals, nor has Azerbaijan made any convincing effort to demonstrate as much.\n\n8. Of the more than 100 acts of racial discrimination that were captured on film, some of the victims were depicted being murdered, while others simply disappeared.19 To this day, Azerbaijan denies ever having detained or killed numerous such victims despite evidence, including in the form of videos and photographs and testimonies of former detainees, that most if not all were once in its custody and that many were then killed on ethnic grounds.20\n\n9. Those ethnic Armenians fortunate enough to survive Azerbaijan’s captivity have testified, inter alia, to having been tortured in detention centers, subjected to racist rhetoric, coerced to incriminate themselves, and forced to sign statements they did not understand.21 Numerous Armenian detainees were convicted “in trials that lacked due process” by a system in which judicial proceedings opened by ethnic Armenians trying to secure their rights are said to “systematically fail due to the general negative climate against Armenians”.22 In such circumstances, it is unsurprising that the CERD Committee itself has called upon Azerbaijan to “conduct[] effective, thorough and impartial investigations into allegations of violations of human rights against [protected persons] of Armenian ethnic or\n\n18 A.

Azerbaijan nonetheless insists that Armenia has “[s]imply assum[ed] that every alleged wrong against any national of Armenia” is based on ethnic origin,24 and argues that its misconduct has been carried out, for example, “against members of the opposing army or even civilians of the enemy State”.25 But many of Azerbaijan’s atrocities were not committed against Armenian servicemen, but against ethnic Armenian civilian residents of Nagorno-Karabakh. That is precisely why the Russian Federation peacekeepers were deployed to “prevent the mass death of the civilian population” in Nagorno-Karabakh26 and why Nagorno-Karabakh was depicted on a postage stamp being “disinfect[ed]” by Azerbaijan itself.27 In circumstances in which Azerbaijan considers the ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh to be its own citizens,28 the acts complained of are all plainly\n\n23 Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, Concluding observations on the combined tenth to twelfth reports of Azerbaijan, UN Doc.

There is simply no basis for arguing that Azerbaijan’s abuses involved “only hostility between two States involved in an armed conflict and raise no issues of interpretation or application of CERD”.\n\n29\n\n11. Yet even if Azerbaijan’s second preliminary objection could not be rejected now (quod non), it would still not possess an exclusively preliminary character and would therefore be unsuitable for determination at this preliminary stage. Despite asserting that the Court “need not weigh evidence or otherwise consider the merits to dismiss this set of Armenia’s claims”,30 Azerbaijan in fact challenges the sufficiency of the evidence31 and produces an Annex (Annex 46) that purportedly lists “Armenia’s Evidence in Support of its Claim”.32 Setting aside the fact that Annex 46 selectively omits dozens of relevant exhibits and pages of argumentation Armenia submitted33—and therefore cannot be relied on to summarize the\n\nnews/armenians-living-in-karabakh-will-haveno-status-no-independence-and-no-special-privilege-president-ilham-aliyev-382715, PDF p. 2 (President Aliyev: “Because the Armenians living in Karabakh will have no status, no independence and no special privilege.

See also infra para. 105.\n\n8\n\nevidence and arguments supporting Armenia’s claims—Azerbaijan’s very use of Annex 46 to nit-pick the record disproves its assertion that granting its second preliminary objection would not require the Court to “weigh evidence or otherwise consider the merits” of the case.\n\n34 Azerbaijan’s preliminary objections must accordingly be dismissed for that reason too.\n\n12. The remainder of this Written Statement proceeds as follows:\n\n13. Part II addresses Azerbaijan’s first preliminary objection and explains why Armenia has fulfilled the negotiation precondition in Article 22 of the CERD.\n\n14. Part III addresses Azerbaijan’s second preliminary objection and explains why the Court has jurisdiction ratione materiae over all of Armenia’s claims. In particular, Part III.A explains why Armenia’s claims fall under the CERD even if they also implicate IHL; Part III.B explains why Armenia’s claims concerning Azerbaijan’s discriminatory murder, torture, inhumane treatment, detention, and enforced disappearances all fall under the CERD; and Part III.C. explains why, even if Azerbaijan’s second preliminary objection could not be rejected now (which it can), it would not possess an exclusively preliminary character and would therefore not be suitable for determination at the preliminary stage.\n\n15. Finally, Part IV sets out Armenia’s submissions.\n\nII. Armenia Fulfilled the Negotiation Precondition in Article 22 of the CERD\n\n16. Azerbaijan’s first preliminary objection is that Armenia allegedly “failed to comply with the negotiation precondition required by Article 22 of CERD”. Azerbaijan is mistaken.\n\n34 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 41.\n\n9\n\n17. As the Court observed in its 7 December 2021 Order:\n\n“[T]he Parties corresponded through a series of diplomatic Notes over a period running from November 2020 to September 2021 and held several rounds of bilateral meetings covering the procedural modalities, scope and topics of their negotiations concerning alleged violations of obligations arising under CERD”.35\n\n18. Indeed, before Armenia filed its Application, the Parties exchanged more than 40 pieces of correspondence36 and participated in no fewer than seven rounds of bilateral meetings,37 all with a view to amicably settling the present dispute.\n\n19. All of these efforts were in vain, however. The Court itself observed in its 7 December 2021 Order:\n\n“[B]etween the first exchange ... and the last bilateral meeting ..., the positions of the Parties do not appear to have evolved. Although the Parties were able to agree on certain procedural modalities ..., no similar progress was made in terms of substantive matters relating to Armenia’s allegations of Azerbaijan’s non-compliance with its obligations under CERD. The information available to the Court regarding the bilateral sessions held on 15-16 July 2021, 30-31 August 2021 and 14-15 September 2021 shows a lack of progress in reaching common ground on substantive issues. ... Despite the fact that Armenia alleged in bilateral exchanges that Azerbaijan had violated a number of obligations under CERD and that the\n\n35 Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Armenia v. Azerbaijan), Provisional Measures, Order of 7 December 2021, I.C.J. Reports 2021, p. 361, para. 39.\n\n36 See Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Armenia v. Azerbaijan), Memorial of Armenia (23 January 2023) (hereinafter “Memorial of Armenia”), fn. 1791 (citing Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Armenia v. Azerbaijan), Application and Request for Provisional Measures of Armenia (16 September 2021) (hereinafter “Application of Armenia”), Annexes 10, 14-15, 18-34, 36-46, 48-50, 52-55, 57-61).\n\n37 These meeting rounds were held on 2-3 March 2021, 6-7 April 2021, 19-20 April 2021, 31 May-1 June 2021, 15-16 July 2021, 30-31 August 2021, and 14-15 September 2021.\n\n10\n\nParties engaged in a significant number of written exchanges and meetings over a period of several months, it seems that their positions on the alleged non-compliance by Azerbaijan with its obligations under CERD remained unchanged and that their negotiations had reached an impasse”.\n\n38\n\n20. On that basis, the Court concluded: “It therefore appears ... that the dispute between the Parties regarding the interpretation and application of CERD had not been settled by negotiation as of the date of the filing of the Application”.39\n\n21. Azerbaijan ignores all this in its preliminary objections. Instead, it argues that Armenia did not satisfy the requirement to make “a genuine attempt ... to engage in discussions with the other disputing party, with a view to resolving the dispute” because, it says, Armenia’s attempts were not genuine.40 The record shows the exact opposite. Armenia entered the negotiations with the genuine intention of attempting to amicably settle the dispute. It engaged in exchange after exchange with Azerbaijan even as Azerbaijan persisted in its blatant violations of the Convention. While the negotiations were ongoing, for example, Azerbaijan opened its infamous “Military Trophies Park”, thereby sponsoring, defending and supporting acts of racial discrimination in breach of Articles 2(1)(b), 4(c) and 5(b) of the CERD.41\n\n38 Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Armenia v.

From the very outset, Azerbaijan categorically rejected Armenia’s claims while pretending to be ready to negotiate. Its position remained unchanged throughout the negotiations. Before Armenia filed its Application, the basic positions of the Parties had plainly not evolved despite many exchanges and meetings—just as the Court recognised in its 7 December 2021 Order.42 Armenia stated this position in its Application43 and Memorial,44 yet Azerbaijan makes no attempt to grapple with the Court’s longstanding position that a negotiation precondition is satisfied “when the parties’ ‘basic positions ha[ve] not subsequently evolved’ after several exchanges of diplomatic correspondence and/or meetings”.45\n\n23. The record makes it crystal clear that the Parties’ positions did not evolve over the course of the negotiations. After Armenia presented its CERD claims in its letter of 11 November 2020,46 Azerbaijan flatly replied in its letter of 8 December 2020 that it “rejects Armenia’s allegations as set forth in its 11 November letter”.47 Hence, the Parties held “‘clearly opposite views concerning the question of the performance or non-performance of certain’ international\n\n42 Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Armenia v.

The Parties’ positions did not change at all over the following months. For example, in its letter of 5 April 2021, Azerbaijan maintained that it “denies Armenia’s ... allegations of breach of the Convention”.51 And at the meetings between the Parties on 30-31 August 2021, Azerbaijan again expressed its “categorical rejections of Armenia’s claims”.52\n\n25. Azerbaijan argues that some of the Parties’ exchanges concerned negotiation modalities, rather than the substance of the dispute.53 Naturally, the Parties communicated on procedural issues to try to move the negotiations forward. But, as the record makes abundantly clear, there was no evolution in the Parties’ basic positions from November 2020 to September 2021.\n\n26.

Armenia’s requests for relief on the merits, as presented at the end of its Memorial, make clear that Armenia seeks declarations that Azerbaijan has breached the CERD, and an order that Azerbaijan shall cease these breaches, offer assurances and guarantees of non-repetition, and make reparation by way of restitution and compensation.55 Azerbaijan’s “proposals”, by contrast, denied breaches of the CERD and offered no assurances or guarantees, let alone any kind of reparation.56 Indeed, as Azerbaijan itself admits,57 all of its “proposals” merely concerned steps that Armenia and Azerbaijan would “jointly take” in the future.58 Not a single one of them acknowledged any wrongdoing on Azerbaijan’s part, nor did any of them provide for remedies for Azerbaijan’s many violations of the CERD,59 as Azerbaijan itself recognised in its subsequent Note Verbale.60\n\n27. Moreover, Azerbaijan’s “proposals” simply did not address some of Armenia’s most important requests for relief. For example, Armenia repeatedly\n\n54 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 18.\n\n55 Memorial of Armenia, Part IX.\n\n56 Letter from Vaqif Sadiqov, Head of Delegation of the Republic of Azerbaijan for negotiations under CERD, to Elnur Mammadov, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs (9 October 2021) (Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, Annex 45).\n\n57 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 17.\n\n58 Letter from Vaqif Sadiqov, Head of Delegation of the Republic of Azerbaijan for negotiations under CERD, to Elnur Mammadov, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs (9 October 2021) (Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, Annex 45).\n\n59 Letter from Vaqif Sadiqov, Head of Delegation of the Republic of Azerbaijan for negotiations under CERD, to Elnur Mammadov, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs (9 October 2021) (Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, Annex 45).\n\n60 Note Verbale from the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Azerbaijan to the United Nations Office and other International Organizations in Geneva to the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Armenia to the United Nations Office and other International Organizations in Geneva, No. 0432/27/21/25 (2 September 2021), p. 1 (Application of Armenia, Annex 60) (“Azerbaijan reiterates its statements during the 30-31 August 2021 session that these Counter-proposals are made on a no-prejudice basis as a means of resolving this dispute and are not an admission or concession that any past statement or action constitutes a violation of the CERD”).\n\n14\n\nrequested—throughout the negotiations, in its first request for provisional measures, and in its Memorial—that Azerbaijan release all ethnic Armenian prisoners of war and civilian detainees.\n\n61 Azerbaijan rejected this request; its “proposals” make no mention of this issue. And even where the “proposals” did address matters in dispute between the Parties, Azerbaijan attempted to justify its own unlawful conduct. As an example, one of its “proposals” asserted that “the Military Trophies Park ... commemorates the liberation of Azerbaijan’s territory ... and was never intended to incite anti-Armenian hatred”.62 It is thus false for Azerbaijan to suggest that “[a] comparison of Azerbaijan’s proposals to Armenia’s demands shows that agreement remained possible”.63\n\n28. It should also be recalled that, at the 30-31 August 2021 meetings, Azerbaijan reaffirmed its “categorical rejections” of Armenia’s claims.64 Accordingly, the Parties’ basic positions remained unchanged during the course of the negotiations.\n\n29. Notably, the Court has found negotiation preconditions satisfied in circumstances where the parties’ exchanges were far less extensive than in this case. In Obligation to Prosecute or Extradite, for example, Belgium and Senegal exchanged only a handful of Notes Verbales, and yet the Court found that the negotiation precondition had been satisfied because “[t]here [had been] no change\n\n61 Memorial of Armenia, submission 14(c); Application of Armenia, para. 131.\n\n62 Letter from Vaqif Sadiqov, Head of Delegation of the Republic of Azerbaijan for negotiations under CERD, to Elnur Mammadov, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs (9 October 2021) (Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, Annex 45).\n\n63 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 18.\n\n64 Note Verbale from the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Armenia to the United Nations Office and other International Organizations in Geneva to the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Azerbaijan to the United Nations Office and other International Organizations in Geneva, No. 2203/1415/2021 (10 September 2021), p. 1 (Application of Armenia, Annex 61).\n\n15\n\nin the respective positions of the Parties”.\n\n65 Similarly, in the South West Africa cases, the Court found that the negotiation precondition had been satisfied even though the parties had not engaged in any direct bilateral negotiations, again because “no modification of the [Parties’] respective contentions ha[d] taken place”.66 And in the ICAO Council Appeal cases, the Court found that Qatar had fulfilled the negotiation precondition despite the minimal direct communication between the Parties because “[t]here [was] no indication that the positions of the Parties ... [had] changed”.67 If the negotiation precondition in those cases was satisfied, a fortiori, it is satisfied in this case as well.\n\n30. There is thus no question that when Armenia filed its Application in September 2021, “no reasonable probability exist[ed] that further negotiations would lead to a settlement”.68 Not only had Azerbaijan refused to change its basic position on Armenia’s claims, but there was also serious urgency in the matter, considering Azerbaijan’s ongoing violations of the CERD.

Azerbaijan is plainly wrong that Armenia “sought to use the Court as a platform for advertising its claims”.69 Armenia filed its Application and Request for Provisional Measures for one reason only: to seek relief from Azerbaijan’s unlawful conduct, which negotiations had failed to remedy. That relief has already been granted in part by the Court. It is particularly ironic that Azerbaijan alleges that it “remains ready to engage in a meaningful dialogue with Armenia on any issue”70 even as it steadfastly refuses to discuss the rights and security of the ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh.71\n\n69 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 20.\n\n70 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 20.\n\n71 “Opening Ceremony of Global Media Forum was held in Shusha”, The President of the Republic of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev (21 July 2023), available at https://president.az/en/articles/view/60544, p. 28 (Annex 23) (“[T]hey say that this Armenian minority in Karabakh should be incorporated [into the agenda of issues on the negotiating table], which is not possible at all”); A.

There were such attempts, but I never agreed to that”).\n\n17\n\n32. At the end of the day, there was no “reasonable probability ... that further negotiations would lead to a settlement”72 between the Parties. The situation between Armenia and Azerbaijan remains extremely tenuous73 due, inter alia, to Azerbaijan’s eight-month blockade of the 120,000 ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh in defiance of the Court’s 22 February 2023 Order on Armenia’s second request for provisional measures, as well as of the Court’s 6 July 2023 Order on Armenia’s request for the modification of that 22 February Order. Under the circumstances, it is just not credible to claim that the Parties would have been able to resolve their disputes under the CERD through further negotiations before Armenia filed its Application. Armenia recognises this same stark reality with regards to Azerbaijan’s claims under the CERD, filed a mere week after Armenia’s, and has therefore made no argument that negotiations were not futile in those proceedings.\n\nIII. The Court Has Jurisdiction Ratione Materiae over All of Armenia’s Claims\n\n33. Azerbaijan’s second preliminary objection is as unfounded as its first.\n\n34.

In its Memorial, Armenia demonstrated that the acts giving rise to this dispute, for which Azerbaijan bears responsibility, fall within the definition laid out in Article 1(1). In particular, all the acts complained of constitute “distinction[s], exclusion[s], restriction[s], or preference[s] based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin which ha[ve] the purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing the recognition, enjoyment or exercise, on an equal footing, of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life”.77 The Court therefore has jurisdiction ratione materiae over all of Armenia’s claims.\n\n36. Azerbaijan’s second preliminary objection notably does not object to the Court’s jurisdiction over the majority of Armenia’s claims. These include Armenia’s claims relating to (1) Azerbaijan’s practices of ethnic cleansing and\n\n74 See Certain Iranian Assets (Islamic Republic of Iran v.

Azerbaijan does argue, however, that Armenia’s claims of wartime misconduct and of mistreatment of individuals who allegedly illegally entered Azerbaijan’s territory “are governed by international humanitarian law” and “have nothing to do with CERD”.79 The fact that certain claims implicate IHL, however, does not mean that they cannot also fall within the provisions of the CERD (Section A).\n\n38. Indeed, the overwhelming evidence—including evidence cited in Armenia’s Memorial and simply ignored by Azerbaijan80—makes clear that the\n\n78 See Memorial of Armenia, Section VI.5.\n\n79 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 2, 24, 30, 63. See also ibid., 10, 37, 53, 55, 56.\n\n80 Armenia notes in this regard that Azerbaijan’s Preliminary Objections entirely ignore certain arguments (see infra para. 64). Moreover, Azerbaijan’s Annex 46—which purportedly lays out “Armenia’s Evidence in Support of its Claim[s]”—is incomplete. For example, both Azerbaijan’s preliminary objections and Annex 46 completely fail to take into account the Declaration by Dr. Rafayel Vardanyan from the Investigative Committee of the Republic of Armenia submitted with Armenia’s Memorial. See Declaration by Dr. Rafayel Vardanyan, Investigative Committee of the Republic of Armenia (13 January 2023) (Memorial of Armenia, Annex 294). Azerbaijan also omits, from both Annex 46 and its preliminary objections, reports by the Human Rights Ombudsman of the Republic of Artsakh and the Human Rights Defender of the Republic of Armenia. See, e.g., Memorial of Armenia, Annexes 44, 48, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 61, 62, 63, 67, 68, 69, 70. Azerbaijan further fails to account for dozens of other Annexes cited in Armenia’s Memorial. See, e.g., European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, Second Report on Azerbaijan (second monitoring cycle) (15 December 2006), available at https://ec.europa.eu/migrant-integration/library-document/ecri-second-report-azerbaijan_en, para.\n\n20\n\nacts about which Armenia\n\ncomplains are all capable of constituting racial discrimination under the CERD, and that they therefore fall within the Court’s jurisdiction ratione materiae (Section B). In the alternative, Azerbaijan’s second objection effectively asks the Court to weigh the evidence and thus prejudge the merits, which renders it unsuitable for determination at this preliminary stage (Section C).\n\nA. Armenia’s Claims Fall under the CERD Even If They Also Implicate IHL\n\n39. Azerbaijan argues that “Armenia provides no basis to conclude that its claims of wartime misconduct or of mistreatment of individuals who illegally entered Azerbaijan’s territory during the occupation period” have anything to do with racial discrimination under the CERD.81 According to Azerbaijan, those claims instead exclusively “allege conduct potentially implicating questions of IHL”.82 Azerbaijan makes the same assertion on no fewer than 17 other occasions,83 as if repeating it ad nauseam somehow makes it true. It does not.\n\n40. It is of course true that not every violation of IHL is an act of racial discrimination. At the same time, it is equally true that the same acts may implicate both the CERD and IHL. As the Court has repeatedly made clear, “certain acts or omissions may give rise to a dispute that falls within the ambit of more than one\n\n109 (Memorial of Armenia, Annex 22) (cited in paragraphs 3.108, 6.122 of Armenia’s Memorial); T. Lokshina, “Survivors of unlawful detention in Nagorno-Karabakh speak out about war crimes”, Human Rights Watch (12 March 2021) (Memorial of Armenia, Annex 86) (cited in paragraphs 3.244, 3.261, 3.305, 3.318-3.320, 3.329, 3.337, 6.131 of Armenia’s Memorial). As such, neither Annex 46 nor Azerbaijan’s preliminary objections can be relied on to summarize the evidence and arguments supporting Armenia’s claims.\n\n81 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 28.\n\n82 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 28.\n\n83 See Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, paras. 2, 6, 8, 10, 24, 28, 30, 37, 44, 47, 48, 52, 53, 55, 56, 60, 67.\n\n21\n\ntreaty”.\n\n84 Azerbaijan itself cannot help but acknowledge that the “CERD applies in armed conflict as well as in peacetime” and that “acts of war may implicate CERD”.85 In fact, in the parallel proceedings in Azerbaijan v. Armenia, Azerbaijan itself has brought claims that, if proven, might constitute violations of both the CERD and IHL.86\n\n41. Azerbaijan alleges that “nothing” other than “bare assertion” connects Armenia’s allegations to racial discrimination.87 This is a puzzling submission considering the overwhelming evidence submitted with Armenia’s Memorial and discussed in the following sections. It bears underscoring that Armenia does not argue that, in general, Azerbaijan’s violations of the jus ad bellum or of IHL constitute violations of the CERD. Rather, Armenia complains about specific misconduct by Azerbaijan’s armed forces and other organs that had a distinct racially discriminatory character. In fact, much of Azerbaijan’s wartime and war-related conduct was accompanied by explicit expressions of racism,88 and all of Azerbaijan’s impugned conduct must be understood both against that backdrop and in the context of Azerbaijan’s decades-long propagation of Armenophobic hate that permeates every aspect of social life in the country.89\n\n42. Azerbaijan also argues that just because “most if not all members of Armenia’s armed forces will be ethnic Armenians … this does not transform every\n\n84 Allegations of Genocide under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Ukraine v.

United Arab Emirates upon which Azerbaijan relies91—that “collateral or secondary effects” on persons of a particular ethnic origin, arising in the context of measures based on current nationality, do “not constitute racial discrimination within the meaning of the Convention”92—is inapposite here. The effects of Azerbaijan’s actions on persons of Armenian ethnic origin described in the Memorial are neither “collateral” nor “secondary” effects of measures based on current nationality. As Armenia demonstrated in its Memorial, the actions taken were not taken on the basis of nationality—indeed, Azerbaijan has persecuted the ethnic Armenian residents of Nagorno-Karabakh which it considers its own citizens.93 To the contrary, Azerbaijan’s actions were deliberate measures that had the purpose of suppressing, displacing, and in some cases entirely eliminating, ethnic Armenians and their identity, regardless of nationality.\n\n90 See Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 39.\n\n91 See Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 39.\n\n92 Application of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (Qatar v.

Azerbaijan finally argues that “the mere fact that the peoples of two States at war often are primarily of different ethnic origins does not, without more, transform every act of war” into a violation of the CERD.94 Armenia agrees. But as made clear throughout Armenia’s Memorial and in these Observations, that plainly does not describe the situation in this case. Azerbaijan’s purported concern that allowing Armenia’s claims to proceed would open a Pandora’s box is therefore misplaced.95\n\nB. Armenia’s Claims Concerning Azerbaijan’s Discriminatory Murder, Torture and Inhumane Treatment, Discriminatory Arbitrary Detention, and Discriminatory Enforced Disappearances All Fall under the CERD\n\n44. Azerbaijan asserts that “nothing in Armenia’s Application or Memorial, other than bare assertion, connects [its] allegations [relating to unlawful violence, arbitrary detention, and enforced disappearances] to racial discrimination”.96 According to Azerbaijan, the acts complained of thus have nothing to do with the CERD, but instead merely concern misconduct in an armed conflict. In order to uphold Azerbaijan’s objections at this preliminary stage, the Court would therefore have to conclude, without “weigh[ing] evidence or otherwise consider[ing] the merits”,97 that Azerbaijan’s acts of murder, torture, inhumane treatment, detention, and enforced disappearances of ethnic Armenians were based solely on (i) ordinary animosity in the midst of an armed conflict, and were thus not even capable of\n\n94 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 8.\n\n95 See, e.g., Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 8. See also ibid., para. 37.\n\n96 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 40.\n\n97 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 41.\n\n24\n\nhaving been based on (ii) ethnicity or (iii) a combination of ethnicity and other considerations.\n\n98\n\n45. Azerbaijan itself admits that misconduct in armed conflict and racial discrimination are not mutually exclusive,99 but claims that in the circumstances of the case, there was no racial discrimination. Azerbaijan’s submission is not just wrong—it is frivolous. As discussed below, Armenia’s claims concerning discriminatory murder, torture and inhumane treatment (Section 1), discriminatory arbitrary detention (Section 2) and discriminatory enforced disappearances (Section 3) all plainly fall within the provisions of the CERD. While the direct evidence is sufficient to prove Armenia’s claims, the general Armenophobia espoused and cultivated by Azerbaijan is, contrary to what Azerbaijan argues, also relevant context in evaluating the particular acts about which Armenia complains (Section 4).\n\n1. Armenia’s Claims Concerning Azerbaijan’s Discriminatory Murder, Torture and Inhumane Treatment of Ethnic Armenians Fall within the Scope of the CERD\n\n46. Azerbaijan objects to Armenia’s claims concerning Azerbaijan’s discriminatory violence against ethnic Armenians.100 In so doing, it artificially divides those claims into three “categories”101—concerning mistreatment of ethnic\n\n98 Armenia notes in this regard that “[t]he ‘grounds’ of discrimination are extended in practice by the notion of “intersectionality” whereby the Committee addresses situations of double or multiple discrimination - such as discrimination on grounds of gender or religion – when discrimination on such a ground appears to exist in combination with a ground or grounds listed in article 1 of the Convention”. See Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, General Recommendation No. 32: The meaning and scope of special measures in the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms Racial Discrimination, UN Doc. CERD/C/GC/32 (24 September 2009), available at https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/667786, para. 7 (Annex 2).\n\n99 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, paras. 8, 49.\n\n100 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, paras. 42-58.\n\n101 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 42.\n\n25\n\nArmenian servicemen (both members of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Armenia and of the armed forces of the local authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh\n\n102), mistreatment of ethnic Armenian civilians, and mistreatment of ethnic Armenians who allegedly illegally crossed the border or line of contact between the First and Second Nagorno-Karabakh Wars.103 Azerbaijan thus appears to be trying to isolate and thereby minimise the evidence of racial discrimination with respect to each “category” of claim. Yet no matter how much Azerbaijan seeks to dissect Armenia’s claims, the evidence of racial discrimination is overwhelming with respect to all of the “categories” about which it complains.\n\n47. The direct evidence of Azerbaijan’s racially motivated violence and other abuse is too copious to recount in full. Armenia therefore directs the Court to the following sections of its Memorial: III.1.II, III.2.II, III.3.I, IV.1, IV.2.I, and IV.2.IV.A & B. It is important to note, however, that as explained in Section 4 below, the entirety of Armenia’s Application, Memorial and accompanying evidence is relevant context in evaluating Armenia’s claims.104 This context underscores the extent to which hatred of ethnic Armenians permeates Azerbaijani society and corroborates why Azerbaijan’s objection must be rejected.\n\n48. For present purposes, Armenia limits itself to restating a small fraction of the evidence before the Court. That evidence includes more than one hundred videos depicting the murder and mistreatment of persons not because they\n\n102 Armenia notes that Azerbaijan appears to incorrectly conflate servicemen of the local authorities in Nagorno-Karabakh with servicemen of the Republic of Armenia.\n\n103 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 42.\n\n104 See infra Section III.B(4).\n\n26\n\npossessed Armenian nationality, but because they were ethnic Armenians.\n\n105 Among many other examples, Armenia presented:\n\n• A video capturing Azerbaijani soldiers cutting off the ears of two dead Armenians while claiming that they “will eliminate their race”.106\n\n• A video showing a group of Azerbaijani servicemen abusing a group of ethnic Armenian prisoners of war (“POWs”).

All these videos were, moreover, widely circulated by Azerbaijani social media users and openly glorified with impunity.123 The perpetrators have not been punished to this day.124\n\n51.

The same may be said for the patches worn by Azerbaijani soldiers showing a notorious Ottoman genocidaire with the caption: “Armenian, don’t run! You’ll die anyway, just exhausted”.\n\n126 Both plainly link violence to ethnic hatred, the latter being the very reason for the extreme and cruel character of the former.\n\n52. The video and photographic evidence Armenia submitted with its Application and Memorial are merely the tip of the iceberg of Azerbaijan’s racially motivated abuse. Azerbaijani servicemen’s willingness to openly commit acts of racial hatred on film does not just show that they were unafraid of being caught and prosecuted for their crimes. It also can only mean that they committed even more such atrocities when no cameras were around.\n\n53. Among many other pieces of evidence submitted with Armenia’s Memorial that prove this point, Annex 291 contains a compilation of testimonies of than sixty former Armenian POWs and civilian detainees. Each and every one was abused on racial grounds. For example:\n\n• One recounted being beaten, forced to stand all night, and forced to read a book stating that “Azerbaijan is an ancient nation, and that the Armenians have been nomads and did not have a state, and that they seized [the Azerbaijanis’] historic lands”.127\n\n126 See Memorial of Armenia, Section IV.2.IV.A.2 (citing Artyom Tonoyan, @ArtyomTonoyan, “As Azerbaijan reverts to type and attacks Armenian positions in Nagorno-Karabakh, here is a an [sic] army uniform patch making rounds on Azeri socials.

Other evidence includes the heinous murder and torture of numerous ethnic Armenian civilians living in Nagorno-Karabakh132—including women and the elderly133—in circumstances in which there can be no explanation other than ethnic hatred. Tellingly, and as noted above, Azerbaijan itself claims that it considers the\n\n128 Excerpts from Sworn Testimonies of Repatriated Armenians Azerbaijan Captured and Detained in Various Periods from December 2014 until October 2022 (January 2023), Appendix 2 (certified translation from Armenian) (confidential) (Memorial of Armenia, Annex 291).\n\n129 Excerpts from Sworn Testimonies of Repatriated Armenians Azerbaijan Captured and Detained in Various Periods from December 2014 until October 2022 (January 2023), p. 1 (certified translation from Armenian) (confidential) (Memorial of Armenia, Annex 291)\n\n130 Excerpts from Sworn Testimonies of Repatriated Armenians Azerbaijan Captured and Detained in Various Periods from December 2014 until October 2022 (January 2023), p. 12 (certified translation from Armenian) (confidential) (Memorial of Armenia, Annex 291)\n\n131 Excerpts from Sworn Testimonies of Repatriated Armenians Azerbaijan Captured and Detained in Various Periods from December 2014 until October 2022 (January 2023), p. 5 (certified translation from Armenian) (confidential) (Memorial of Armenia, Annex 291)\n\n132 See Memorial of Armenia, paras., 3.62-3.67, 3.244-3.275, 3.305, 4.7.\n\n133 See Memorial of Armenia, paras. 3.265-3.268.\n\n32\n\nresidents of Nagorno-Karabakh to be its own citizens.\n\n134 Moreover, in none of these cases does Azerbaijan rely on the pretext it uses in relation to ethnic Armenian servicemen; namely, that the acts complained of evidence nothing more than “hostility between opposing soldiers at war”.135\n\n55. As just one example of ethnically motivated murder of ethnic Armenian civilians among many others: upon entering and taking control of the Talish village in Nagorno-Karabakh in 2016, Azerbaijani soldiers “killed at least three elderly civilian residents and then mutilated their bodies by cutting off their ears”.136 As another example: in 2020, the mutilated body of Ernest Harutunyan, an 84-year-old ethnic Armenian civilian who suffered from dementia, was found in his home in Nagorno-Karabakh.137 The circumstances of his death suggested he had been “deliberate[ly] kill[ed]”.138 In addition, Azerbaijan’s Armed Forces beheaded at least two other ethnic Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh, aged 69 and 82, alive on film.139 Once again, there is no plausible explanation for such acts other than racial hate.\n\n134 See supra para. 42, n. 93.\n\n135 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 45.\n\n136 Memorial of Armenia, para. 3.62.

Azerbaijan argues that attacks on civilians that are considered indiscriminate for IHL purposes by definition cannot “discriminate on the basis of ethnic origin or anything else”.140 At the risk of stating the obvious, an attack is “indiscriminate” under IHL because it fails to distinguish between civilian objects and military targets.141 An attack on persons, civilians or otherwise solely because they are ethnically Armenian is absolutely capable of constituting discrimination under the CERD. As such, an attack that is “indiscriminate” under IHL can be discriminatory under the CERD. That is exactly the case here: Azerbaijan killed ethnic Armenians and targeted civilian infrastructure that had no military advantage, including schools and homes,142 simply because ethnic Armenians would be harmed.143\n\n57. The fact that atrocities against civilians have regularly occurred even in periods of de facto peace merely serves to underscore that they are not ordinary incidents of war.\n\n58. For example, Mamikon Khojoyan, an elderly Armenian civilian captured in 2014 between the First and Second Nagorno-Karabakh Wars, was “severely beaten in the head, ribs, arms and other parts of the body, burned, and subjected to\n\n140 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 55.\n\n141 See Additional Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions, Article 51(4)(c) (“Indiscriminate attacks are … those which employ a method or means of combat the effects of which cannot be limited as required by this Protocol; and consequently, in each such case, are of a nature to strike military objectives and civilians or civilian objects without distinction”).\n\n142 Memorial of Armenia, para. 3.243\n\n143 Memorial of Armenia, para. 3.243 (citing B. Cox, Continuing Impunity: Azerbaijani-Turkish Offensives Against Armenians In Nagorno Karabakh (24 April 2021), available at https://www.hart-uk.org/baroness-cox-publishes-report-continuing-impunity-azerbaijani-turkish-offensives-against-armenians-in-nagorno-karabakh/, p. 4 (Annex 34) (noting that Azerbaijan destroyed an estimated 14,000 civilian structures, including “homes, markets and infrastructure vital to the survival of the local population, such as bridges, electricity, telecoms, [and] gas and water supply systems”)).\n\n34\n\ndrug injections that posed a danger to his life”.\n\n144 He later died from his injuries. Azerbaijan presents no evidence for its assertion that Khojoyan, who was 77-years old at the time, was a “member[] of the Armenian Armed Forces” who was “suspected of entering Azerbaijan to engage in espionage or other unlawful activities”.145 Much less does it address the fact that the European Court of Human Rights (“ECtHR”) noted that the circumstances surrounding Khojoyan’s death called for an investigation as to “whether ethnic hatred had played a role”.146\n\n59. The ECtHR reached the same conclusion in multiple other cases of murder or mistreatment involving ethnic Armenians who had allegedly illegally crossed the border or line of contact between the First and Second Nagorno-Karabakh Wars.147 For example,\n\n• Case of Manvel Saribekyan—an ethnic Armenian civilian who was captured by Azerbaijan while searching for stray cattle and firewood in the forest and who was later found dead in his jail cell: the ECtHR held that his ill treatment “involved very serious and cruel suffering” that was “carried\n\n144 Khojoyan and Vardazaryan v.

Azerbaijan, ECtHR, Application No. 62161/14, Judgment (4 November 2021), para. 53, p. 15 (Annex 26).\n\n147 Azerbaijan’s assertion that “[t]he judgments of the European Court of Human Rights on which Armenia relies with respect to four of the detained Armenian individuals did not find a violation of ECHR Article 14, which prohibits discrimination” is misleading. Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 50 and note 91. As Azerbaijan must know, the Court found instead that it did not need to adjudicate claims under Article 14 because “the Court has already taken into account the general context of hostility and tension between Azerbaijan and Armenia, and concluded that such context also indicated that an investigation [into whether ethnic hatred had been a contributing factor in violations of Articles 2 and 3 of the Convention] should have been carried out”. See Saribekyan and Balayan v. Azerbaijan, ECtHR, Application No. 35746/11, Judgment (30 January 2020), paras. 102-103 (Annex 24). See also Khojoyan and Vardazaryan v. Azerbaijan, ECtHR, Application No. 62161/14, Judgment (4 November 2021), para. 85 (Annex 26); Petrosyan v.

These examples again represent a small fraction of the evidence relevant to Armenia’s claims. In such circumstances, it is difficult for Armenia to understand how Azerbaijan can possibly contend that there is “an absence of any facts pled showing that individuals were singled out for different treatment on the basis of ethnic origin”.151 Still less does Armenia understand how Azerbaijan could believe that the acts complained of are not even capable of constituting discrimination on the basis of race.152 Even if Azerbaijan’s selective attacks on individual pieces of evidence presented by Armenia were accurate—and they are not153—atrocities\n\n148 See Memorial of Armenia, paras. 3.39-3.43 (citing Saribekyan and Balayan v.

See also Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 28 (“To establish the Court’s jurisdiction over its claims, Armenia must show that the acts it alleges are capable of constituting racial discrimination within the meaning of CERD”).\n\n153 Azerbaijan’s misrepresentations of the evidence are too numerous to address in full at this stage. By way of just one example, Azerbaijan implausibly argues, without any explanation, that the above-mentioned video capturing a soldier shooting a dead ethnic Armenian from behind and\n\n36\n\naccompanied by statements like\n\n“we will eliminate their race” are, by their very terms, unequivocally predicated on race.\n\n61. Indeed, Azerbaijan’s own Deputy Military Prosecutor and Office of the Prosecutor General have both implicitly recognised that Azerbaijan’s armed forces committed atrocities on the basis of race.154 In fact, at paragraph 43 of its preliminary objections, Azerbaijan explicitly accepts that Armenia has provided examples in which “alleged Azerbaijani servicemembers used derogatory language with a possible ethnic dimension”, including “a reference to ‘Armenian dogs’”.155 Azerbaijan provides no explanation, however, for its claim that this reference evidences mere “hostility between opposing soldiers at war, not discrimination on the basis of ethnic origin”.156 Nor does it explain how acts accompanied by derogatory language with a “possible ethnic dimension” are not even capable of constituting discrimination on the basis of race.\n\n62. In sum, the acts Armenia complains of concerning Azerbaijan’s discriminatory murder, torture and inhumane treatment of ethnic Armenians in\n\nstating “these are not human beings” referred only to “members of Armenia’s armed forces”. See Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, fn. 71. In Armenia’s view, such language speaks for itself.\n\n154 See, e.g., Letter from Fuad Mammadov, Deputy Military Prosecutor of the Republic of Azerbaijan, to Chingiz Asgarov, Agent of the Republic of Azerbaijan before the European Court of Human Rights, Regarding Criminal Cases Allegedly Investigated by the Military Prosecutor’s Office (27 January 2022), pp. 20 23 (emphasis added) (confidential) (Memorial of Armenia, Annex 65) (acknowledging that video footage of atrocities against ethnic Armenian servicemen captured “cruel and inhuman treatment of civilians and servicemen of Armenian descent captured during the Patriotic War and mutilation of corpses by the servicemen of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan”, including their “fully beheading one with knife, slitting [the] throat of one person, and shooting three persons dead by automatic guns and pistols”); Office of the Prosecutor General of the Republic of Azerbaijan, Detained Four Servicemen Accused of Insulting Bodies of Armenian Servicemen and Tombstones Belonging to Armenians (14 December 2020), available at https://genprosecutor.gov.az/az/post/3272, pp. 2-3 (Annex 11) (stating that the criminal acts committed by Azerbaijani servicemen “contradict the mentality of the Azerbaijani people, which is tolerant, highly appreciates multicultural values and is historically distinguished by its humanism”).\n\n155 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 45.\n\n156 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 45.\n\n37\n\nviolation of Articles 2(1), 4(a) and 5(b) of the CERD are all plainly capable of constituting racial discrimination. They therefore all fall within the scope of the CERD and the Court’s jurisdiction ratione materiae. As such, the Court should dismiss Azerbaijan’s objection in this regard.\n\n2. Armenia’s Claims Concerning Azerbaijan’s Discriminatory Detention of Ethnic Armenians Fall within the Scope of the CERD\n\n63. According to Azerbaijan, Armenia “puts forward no evidence that any Armenian was detained on the basis of ethnic origin”.157 Also according to Azerbaijan, it detained, and in some cases continues to detain, individuals not because of their ethnic Armenian origin, but rather because they were allegedly “either captured during active hostilities or were detained as a result of their suspected illegal activity”.158\n\n64. Armenia notes at the outset that, notwithstanding Azerbaijan’s suggestion to the contrary, its claims of discriminatory detention extend beyond the so-called “two categories” of ethnic Armenians who allegedly “illegally crossed the border into Azerbaijan” or were “prisoners of war captured during the Second Garabagh [Nagorno-Karabakh] War”.159 As Armenia explained in its Memorial, its claims of discriminatory detention also include the numerous ethnic Armenians who were not Armenian citizens and were detained at Azerbaijan’s ports of entry merely because they had Armenian surnames (i.e., on unequivocally ethnic grounds).160 It\n\n157 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 59.\n\n158 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 64.\n\n159 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 60.\n\n160 See Memorial of Armenia, paras. 3.118, 6.124. In 2017, the Russian Foreign Ministry demanded an end to discrimination against its citizens with Armenian last names arriving in Azerbaijan. It was reported that many such people were detained for several hours, in a number of cases without food, water and medical attention, and then sent back at their own expenses. In some instances, persons with Russian last names were interrogated to uncover “Armenian ancestors”. See Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, Comment of the Information and Press Department on\n\n38\n\ncannot be said with respect to any such person that they “were, or were perceived to be, fighting for Armenia or engaged in violations of law”.\n\n161 Azerbaijan entirely ignored these claims and the evidence in connection therewith, both in its preliminary objections and in its Annex 46. That does not stop it, however, from requesting the dismissal of Armenia’s claims of discriminatory detention in full.162\n\n65. With regard to the categories of Armenian detainees that Azerbaijan has singled out, Armenia respectfully submits that it has put forward ample evidence establishing that these claims implicate rights under the CERD.\n\n66. This evidence makes two things clear: (1) that Azerbaijan has arbitrarily detained the individuals in question and (2) that they have been so detained on account of their ethnic origin.\n\n67. With respect to the first point—the arbitrary nature of the detentions—Azerbaijan is mistaken to claim that “on the face of Armenia’s Memorial, the detentions have … every connection to the fact that the detainees were, or were perceived to be, fighting for Armenia or engaged in violations of law”.163 In fact, the opposite is true.\n\n68. Starting with the individuals who allegedly “illegally crossed the border into Azerbaijan”, Azerbaijan does not meaningfully engage with the judgments of the ECtHR in the cases discussed in paragraphs 3.36-3.53 of Armenia’s Memorial, finding Azerbaijan in violation of Article 5 of the European Convention on Human\n\nthe ban on Russian citizens entering Azerbaijan (6 July 2017) (certified translation from Russian) (Memorial of Armenia, Annex 47).\n\n161 Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 65.\n\n162 See Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 66.\n\n163 See Preliminary Objections of Azerbaijan, para. 65.\n\n39\n\nRights protecting against arbitrary detention.\n\n164 In fact, in some of these cases, Azerbaijan did not even argue that the detention of the individuals in question was in conformity with Article 5165—contrary to what it is now representing before the Court with respect to these individuals; namely, that “Armenia’s references to ‘false accusations’ and ‘spurious charges’ are completely unsubstantiated … no matter how many times those words are repeated”.166\n\n69. With regard to individuals detained during and in the aftermath of the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War, suffice to say that no independent third party believes Azerbaijan’s excuse that these individuals “were detained as a result of their suspected illegal activity”.167 The CERD Committee itself has stated that it is “deeply concerned” about allegations that “prisoners of war and protected persons\n\n164 See Badalyan v.

The European Parliament, for example, has expressed its grave concern “about credible reports, according to which Armenian prisoners of war and other captive persons have been and are being held in degrading conditions, and that they have been subjected to inhuman treatment and torture when captured or during their detention” and “demand[ed] the immediate and unconditional release of all Armenian prisoners … and that Azerbaijan refrain from making arbitrary detentions in the future”. European Parliament, Resolution of 20 May 2021 on prisoners of war in the aftermath of the most recent conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan (2021/2693(RSP)) (20 May 2021), available at https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2021-0251_EN.pdf (Memorial of Armenia, Annex 35). Similarly, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe expressed “concern[] about … Armenians captured after the Trilateral statement, who are still in captivity, most of whom have faced or are facing speedy criminal trials, which may raise fair trial issues under the European Convention on Human Rights”. See Council of Europe, Parliamentary Assembly, Resolution 2391(2021): Humanitarian consequences of the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan/Nagorno-Karabakh conflict (27 September 2021), para. 6.6 (Memorial of Armenia, Annex 37).

Nowhere in its second preliminary objection does Azerbaijan address these conclusions by independent third parties, including the CERD Committee itself.\n\n71. With respect to the second thing the evidence makes clear—that these arbitrary detentions are based on ethnic origin—Azerbaijan has made a mockery of its obligation to provide detained persons belonging to a racial or ethnic group with “independent, impartial and informed judicial bodies”,171 which ensures that cases against such persons are “assessed consistently with international standards of human rights”172 and thus acts as a safeguard against abuse and deliberate\n\n168 Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, Concluding observations on the combined tenth to twelfth reports of Azerbaijan, UN Doc.

The fact that ethnic Armenians are targeted by Azerbaijan’s judicial system has been confirmed by numerous independent observers.\n\n173 The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (“ECRI”), for example, has observed that “[j]udicial proceedings opened by Armenians trying to secure their rights are said to systematically fail due to the general negative climate against Armenians”,174 that minorities’ “experience of dealing with the judicial system is globally negative”,175 and that “[a]ccording to many sources, false accusations are made, in particular against persons belonging to minority ethnic or religious groups”.176 In the context of its reporting on “discrimination towards persons of Armenian origin living in Azerbaijan”, the ECRI has likewise noted that “[m]any sources” “stress the widespread lack of confidence in the justice system”, and that “individuals often perceive the justice system as lacking sufficient safeguards of impartiality and independence”.177 In its preliminary objections, Azerbaijan did not address these facts at all, let alone why they do not form essential context to understand the detention of the two categories of individuals it has singled out.\n\n173 See, e.g., Memorial of Armenia, paras. 6.116-6.117.\n\n174 European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, Second Report on Azerbaijan (second monitoring cycle) (24 May 2007), para. 109 (Memorial of Armenia, Annex 22).\n\n175 European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, ECRI Report on Azerbaijan (fourth monitoring cycle) (23 March 2011), available at https://rm.coe.int/third-report-onazerbaijan/16808b557e, para. 127 (Memorial of Armenia, Annex 24)\n\n176 European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, ECRI Report on Azerbaijan (fourth monitoring cycle) (23 March 2011), available at https://rm.coe.int/third-report-onazerbaijan/16808b557e, para. 130 (Memorial of Armenia, Annex 24).\n\n177 European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, ECRI Report on Azerbaijan (fourth monitoring cycle) (23 March 2011), available at https://rm.coe.int/third-report-on-azerbaijan/16808b557e, paras. 27-28 (Memorial of Armenia, Annex 24).

Moreover, the treatment that these individuals have received, and in many cases continue to receive, confirms the existence of racial animus in the administration and functioning of the Azerbaijani criminal justice system.178 Each and every ethnic Armenian detained by Azerbaijan —whether residents of Nagorno-Karabakh whom Azerbaijan considers its own citizens or not, and irrespective of their status as civilians or servicemembers179—has been subjected to torture or other abuse while detained, whether during armed hostilities or peacetime, including after the Trilateral Statement was signed.180 Annex 291 to\n\n178 In its General Recommendation No. 31, the CERD Committee has pointed to “factual indicators” of the existence of racial motivation in the administration and functioning of the Azerbaijani criminal justice system, which include “[t]he number and percentage of persons belonging to [an ethnic] group … who are victims of aggression or other offences, especially when they are committed by police officers or other State officials” and “the handing down by the courts of harsher or inappropriate sentences against persons belonging to those groups”.
