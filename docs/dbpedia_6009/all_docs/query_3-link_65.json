        "text": "State of the Global Workplace\n\nThis annual report represents the collective voice of global employees. In this year's report, we examine the role of work in employee mental health and wellbeing.\n\n2024 Report\n\nFrom Suffering to Thriving\n\nIn 2023, global employee engagement stagnated, and overall employee wellbeing declined. While both measures are at or near record highs, their lack of improvement is notable, as they follow multiple years of steady gains. The result is that the majority of the world’s employees continue to struggle at work and in life, with direct consequences for organizational productivity.\n\nWhen you receive access to the report, you will be able to choose from two download options:\n\nKey Insights: Our \"must know\" findings from this year's analysis on mental health, wellbeing and managers\n\nFull Report: Key Insights plus global, regional and country-level data on engagement, wellbeing and more\n\nInteractive Data\n\nExplore Key Findings\n\nHere's what we know about how the world's employees experience work and life.\n\nEmployee Engagement\n\nEmployee Engagement\n\n$8.9 trillion lost in global GDP due to low engagement\n\nEmployee engagement reflects the involvement and enthusiasm of employees in their work and workplace. Gallup has found that engaged business teams drive positive outcomes within organizations. Gallup estimates that low engagement costs the global economy US$8.9 trillion, or 9% of global GDP.\n\n23% Engaged\n\n62% Not Engaged\n\n15% Actively Disengaged\n\nplaceholder\n\n\"I could push it, but I'm so frustrated with the way things are going that day that I'm like, 'You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna do nothing.'\"--Steven, Line Operator\n\nCanada\n\nEmployee Wellbeing\n\nEmployee Wellbeing\n\n34% of employees are thriving in their overall wellbeing\n\nThirty-four percent of employees were thriving in their lives in 2023. This marked a one-point decline from 2022, following five consecutive years of improvement on this measure. Also noteworthy: This decline was felt most by younger workers. Wellbeing among workers under 35 fell from 35% to 31%, while wellbeing increased for those over 35, from 35% to 36%.\n\nplaceholder\n\n\"If I'm not doing well at work, I'm not doing well in life. It's just the way it is.\"--Emilia, Educator\n\nGermany\n\nDaily Stress\n\nDaily Stress\n\n41% of employees experienced a lot of stress the previous day\n\nGlobal employee stress declined in 2023 from 44% to 41%. This is the first time reported daily stress dropped since the pandemic in 2020, although it remains higher than the pre-pandemic average. This item does not directly ask if the stress employees experienced happened at work, although work experiences are a significant factor in daily experienced emotions generally.\n\nplaceholder\n\n\"There are times when you come home, and you're very, very stressed. Very, very wound up, and I think, just the longer you stay in it, the more used to it you get.\"--Stewart, Mortgage Advisor\n\nU.K.\n\nDaily Loneliness\n\nDaily Loneliness\n\n20% of employees experienced a lot of loneliness the previous day\n\nTwenty percent of employees experienced a lot of loneliness the previous day in 2023. Loneliness was higher among fully remote employees (25%) and lowest among those working fully on-site (16%). Hybrid workers fell in between (21%).\n\n25% Fully Remote\n\n16% Fully On-site\n\n21% Hybrid\n\nplaceholder\n\n\"I have not been able to go to any of my children's events due to work. We are here all day.\"--Nestor, Deputy Manager\n\nMexico\n\nIntent to Leave\n\nIntent to Leave\n\n52% of employees say they are watching for or actively seeking a new job\n\nMore than half the world's employees were watching for or actively seeking a new job in 2023. This is particularly relevant for employers who want to attract and retain good workers, since 54% of employees also think it's a good time to find a job where they live.\n\nHowever, job seekers are not evenly distributed. Workers in Europe and Post-Soviet Eurasia are the least likely to be looking for a new job; Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asian workers are the most likely. Seventy-five percent of Sub-Saharan employees say they are open to or searching for new work.\n\nplaceholder\n\n\"My work can contribute to stress, and it can also contribute to a sense of satisfaction. And they balance each other out to the point that I don't feel like I need to make a change.\"--Jack, Art and VFX Director\n\nCanada\n\nThank you for your interest in the State of the Global Workplace: 2024 Report.\n\nChoose the version of the report you would like to download:\n\nKey Insights:\n\nOur \"must know\" findings from this year's analysis on mental health, wellbeing and managers\n\nDownload the Key Insights PDF\n\nFull Report:\n\nKey Insights plus global, regional and country-level data on engagement, wellbeing and more\n\nDownload the Full Report PDF\n\nWebinar\n\nLearn More About What We Know\n\nJoin Gallup's workplace scientists as they uncover the key themes and discoveries from this year's report, including guidance for leaders on what these findings mean for their organization.\n\nAdditional Work Insights\n\nGlobal Indicators\n\nThe World's Workplace and Society Trendlines\n\nGallup is continually tracking the most important benchmarks of global progress for the workplace and society at large.
