        "text": "Introduction\n\nBackground\n\nArmenia prides itself on being the first nation to formally adopt Christianity (early 4th century). Despite periods of autonomy, over the centuries Armenia came under the sway of various empires including the Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Persian, and Ottoman. During World War I in the western portion of Armenia, the Ottoman Empire instituted a policy of forced resettlement coupled with other harsh practices that resulted in at least 1 million Armenian deaths - actions widely recognized as constituting genocide. The eastern area of Armenia was ceded by the Ottomans to Russia in 1828; this portion declared its independence in 1918, but was conquered by the Soviet Red Army in 1920.\n\nArmenia remains involved in the protracted struggle with Azerbaijan over control of Nagorno-Karabakh, a primarily ethnic Armenian region that Moscow recognized in 1923 as an autonomous oblast within Soviet Azerbaijan. In the late Soviet period, a separatist movement developed that sought to end Azerbaijani control over the region. Fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh began in 1988 and escalated after Armenia and Azerbaijan attained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. By the time a cease-fire took effect in May 1994, separatists, with Armenian support, controlled NagornoâKarabakh and seven surrounding Azerbaijani territories. Following the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War in September-November 2020, Armenia lost control over much of the territory it had captured a quarter century earlier. Under the terms of a cease-fire agreement signed in November 2020, Armenia returned to Azerbaijan the remaining territories it occupied and some parts of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, including the key city that Armenians call Shushi and Azerbaijanis call Shusha.\n\nTurkey closed the common border with Armenia in 1993 in support of Azerbaijan in its conflict with Armenia over control of Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas, further hampering Armenian economic growth. In 2009, Armenia and Turkey signed Protocols normalizing relations between the two countries, but neither country ratified the Protocols, and Armenia officially withdrew from the Protocols in March 2018. In 2015, Armenia joined the Eurasian Economic Union alongside Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. In November 2017, Armenia signed a Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with the EU.\n\nIn spring 2018, former President of Armenia (2008-18) Serzh SARGSIAN of the Republican Party of Armenia (RPA) tried to extend his time in power by becoming prime minister, prompting popular protests that became known as the âVelvet Revolutionâ after SARGSIAN was forced to resign. The leader of the protests, Civil Contract party chief Nikol PASHINYAN, was elected by the National Assembly as the new prime minister on 8 May 2018. PASHINYANâs party prevailed in an early legislative election in December 2018, and he was reelected as prime minister.Â\n\nTip\n\nVisit the Definitions and Notes page to view a description of each topic.\n\nDefinitions and Notes\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nSouthwestern Asia, between Turkey (to the west) and Azerbaijan; note - Armenia views itself as part of Europe; geopolitically, it can be classified as falling within Europe, the Middle East, or both\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n40 00 N, 45 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAsia\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 29,743 sq km\n\nland: 28,203 sq km\n\nwater: 1,540 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 142\n\nArea - comparative\n\nslightly smaller than Maryland\n\nArea comparison map\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 1,570 km\n\nborder countries (4): Azerbaijan 996 km; Georgia 219 km; Iran 44 km; Turkey 311 km\n\nCoastline\n\n0 km (landlocked)\n\nMaritime claims\n\nnone (landlocked)\n\nClimate\n\nhighland continental, hot summers, cold winters\n\nTerrain\n\nArmenian Highland with mountains; little forest land; fast flowing rivers; good soil in Aras River valley\n\nElevation\n\nhighest point: Aragats Lerrnagagat' 4,090 m\n\nlowest point: Debed River 400 m\n\nmean elevation: 1,792 m\n\nNatural resources\n\nsmall deposits of gold, copper, molybdenum, zinc, bauxite\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 59.7% (2018 est.)\n\narable land: 15.8% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent crops: 1.9% (2018 est.)\n\npermanent pasture: 42% (2018 est.)\n\nforest: 9.1% (2018 est.)\n\nother: 31.2% (2018 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n1,554 sq km (2020)\n\nMajor lakes (area sq km)\n\nfresh water lake(s): Lake Sevan - 1,360 sq km\n\nPopulation distribution\n\nmost of the population is located in the northern half of the country; the capital of Yerevan is home to more than five times as many people as Gyumri, the second largest city in the country\n\nNatural hazards\n\noccasionally severe earthquakes; droughts\n\nGeography - note\n\nlandlocked in the Lesser Caucasus Mountains; Sevana Lich (Lake Sevan) is the largest lake in this mountain range\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n3,000,756 (2022 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 138\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Armenian(s)\n\nadjective: Armenian\n\nEthnic groups\n\nArmenian 98.1%, Yezidi (Kurd) 1.2%, other 0.7% (2011 est.)\n\nLanguages\n\nArmenian (official) 97.9%, Kurmanji (spoken by Yezidi minority) 1%, other 1.1%; note - Russian is widely spoken (2011 est.)\n\nmajor-language sample(s):\n\nÔ±Õ·Õ­Õ¡ÖÕ°Õ« ÕÕ¡Õ½Õ¿Õ¡Õ£Õ«ÖÖ, Ô±Õ¶ÖÕ¸Õ­Õ¡ÖÕ«Õ¶Õ¥Õ¬Õ« Ô±Õ²Õ¢ÕµÖÖ ÕÕ«Õ´Õ¶Õ¡Õ¯Õ¡Õ¶ ÕÕ¥Õ²Õ¥Õ¯Õ¡Õ¿Õ¾ÖÕ©ÕµÕ¡Õ¶.

Armenia has since switched to small-scale agriculture and away from the large agro industrial complexes of the Soviet era. Armenia has only two open trade borders - Iran and Georgia - because its borders with Azerbaijan and Turkey have been closed since 1991 and 1993, respectively, as a result of Armenia's ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan over the separatist Nagorno-Karabakh region.\n\nÂ\n\nArmenia joined the World Trade Organization in January 2003. The government has made some improvements in tax and customs administration in recent years, but anti-corruption measures have been largely ineffective. Armenia will need to pursue additional economic reforms and strengthen the rule of law in order to raise its economic growth and improve economic competitiveness and employment opportunities, especially given its economic isolation from Turkey and Azerbaijan.\n\nÂ\n\nArmenia's geographic isolation, a narrow export base, and pervasive monopolies in important business sectors have made it particularly vulnerable to volatility in the global commodity markets and the economic challenges in Russia. Armenia is particularly dependent on Russian commercial and governmental support, as most key Armenian infrastructure is Russian-owned and/or managed, especially in the energy sector. Remittances from expatriates working in Russia are equivalent to about 12-14% of GDP. Armenia joined the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union in January 2015, but has remained interested in pursuing closer ties with the EU as well, signing a Comprehensive and Enhanced Partnership Agreement with the EU in November 2017. Armeniaâs rising government debt is leading Yerevan to tighten its fiscal policies â the amount is approaching the debt to GDP ratio threshold set by national legislation.\n\nReal GDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$37.31 billion (2020 est.)\n\n$40.38 billion (2019 est.)\n\n$37.53 billion (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 124\n\nReal GDP growth rate\n\n7.5% (2017 est.)\n\n0.3% (2016 est.)\n\n3.3% (2015 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 11\n\nReal GDP per capita\n\n$12,600 (2020 est.)\n\n$13,700 (2019 est.)\n\n$12,700 (2018 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 118\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$13.694 billion (2019 est.)\n\nInflation rate (consumer prices)\n\n1.4% (2019 est.)\n\n2.5% (2018 est.)\n\n0.9% (2017 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 79\n\nCredit ratings\n\nFitch rating: B+ (2020)\n\nMoody's rating: Ba3 (2019)\n\nnote: The year refers to the year in which the current credit rating was first obtained.\n\nGDP -
