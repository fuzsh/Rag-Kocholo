        "text": "Defence Cooperation Agreement with the United States\n\n15 August 2024\n\nOn 15 August 2024, the Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA) between Sweden and the United States entered into force. This paves the way for even closer cooperation, both bilaterally and within the framework of NATO.\n\nDefence Cooperation Agreement with the United States\n\nSweden has more emigrants than immigrants for the first time in half a century\n\n13 August 2024\n\nLast year’s trend of fewer asylum seekers in Sweden and fewer residence permits granted continues. According to the Swedish Migration Agency’s prognosis, Sweden is on track to have the lowest number of asylum seekers since 1997 and, for the first time in over 50 years, Sweden has net emigration.\n\nPress release: Sweden has more emigrants than immigrants for the first time in half a century\n\nMinistry for Foreign Affairs expands advice against travel\n\n02 August 2024\n\nOn 1 August, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs expanded its advice regarding travel to Israel and Palestine to advise against all travel to both of these countries. Advice against all travel to Lebanon has been in place since October 2023, and the Ministry also urges all Swedes in Lebanon to leave the country. The security situation in the Middle East is serious and may deteriorate rapidly. The Ministry is monitoring developments very closely.\n\nOpinion piece by Minister for Foreign Affairs Tobias Billström: Swedes in Lebanon must heed MFA’s advice against travel\n\nStatement on advisory against travel to Lebanon"
