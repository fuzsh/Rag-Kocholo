        "text": "Azerbaijan and Armenia: The Nagorno-\n\nJanuary 7, 2021\n\nKarabakh Conflict\n\nCory Welt\n\nIn autumn 2020, a six-week war in the South Caucasus reshaped the dynamics of a decades-old\n\nSpecialist in Russian and\n\nconflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia. The dispute centers on the predominantly Armenian-\n\nEuropean Affairs\n\npopulated region of Nagorno-Karabakh (or Mountainous Karabakh, also known in Armenian as\n\nArtsakh) and surrounding territories internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan. The war has\n\nAndrew S. Bowen\n\nresulted in Azerbaijani control over much of the territory it lost to Armenian and Nagorno-\n\nAnalyst in Russian and\n\nKarabakh forces during previous fighting in the 1990s, including a portion of Nagorno-Karabakh\n\nEuropean Affairs\n\nand almost all of the surrounding territories. Armenians have retained control over the remaining\n\nterritory of Nagorno-Karabakh, including the urban center of Stepanakert. A cease-fire agreement\n\nmediated by the Russian Federation introduced about 2,000 Russian troops into the conflict zone\n\nto serve as peacekeeping forces and to guarantee the security of a land corridor between Armenia\n\nand Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nThe local and regional consequences of the autumn 2020 war continue to unfold. The war led to more than 6,000 combat\n\ndeaths and more than 150 civilian deaths. It also displaced tens of thousands of people, although many have returned. In\n\naddition, the Azerbaijani government now is considering how to resettle hundreds of thousands of people who were displaced\n\nfrom the conflict zone in the 1990s , which will require major demining and construction efforts. The 2020 war did not\n\nresolve the disputed political status of Nagorno-Karabakh, and it upended a long-standing international conflict resolution\n\nframework that emerged after the 1990s conflict. It also led to political turmoil in Armenia and strengthened the government\n\nof Azerbaijan. The 2020 war also may increase the influence of regional powers Russia and Turkey, and potentially Iran.\n\nLong-standing U.S. policy over several Administrations has been to facilitate a resolution to the Azerbaijan-Armenia conflict\n\nthat would achieve a negotiated settlement of Nagorno-Karabakhâs political status, peaceably restore Azerbaijani control over\n\nterritories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh, and provide security for residents of and returnees to the conflict zone. In\n\nresponse to the cease-fire agreement, the U.S. Department of State noted that âending the recent fighting is only the first step\n\ntoward achieving a peaceful, negotiated settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.â\n\nMany Members of Congress issued statements in response to the outbreak of armed conflict. In October 2020, three related\n\nresolutions were introduced in the House (H.Res. 1165, H.Res. 1196, and H.Res. 1203) and one related resolution was\n\nintroduced in the Senate (S.Res. 754). The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (P.L. 116-260, Division W, Title VI,\n\nÂ§615), requires the Director of National Intelligence to submit to the congressional intelligence committees an assessment\n\nregarding tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan, âincluding with respect to the status of the Nagorno-Karabakh region.â\n\nU.S. assistance has sought to mitigate the effects of the Azerbaijan-Armenia conflict, including through demining assistance.\n\nThe United States has adhered to a principle of parity with regard to Foreign Military Financing (FMF) assistance for\n\nAzerbaijan and Armenia. The Department of Defense has provided separate capacity-building assistance to Azerbaijan for\n\nborder and maritime security. Since 2001, an annually renewable presidential waiver to Section 907 of the FREEDOM\n\nSupport Act (P.L. 102-511; 22 U.S.C. 5812 note) has enabled the provision of U.S. military aid and other foreign assistance\n\nto Azerbaijan; without the waiver, Section 907 would prohibit most bilateral assistance to Azerbaijan unless the President\n\ndetermined Azerbaijan had made âdemonstrable steps to cease all blockades and other offensive uses of force against\n\nArmenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.â\n\nThe autumn 2020 war heightened awareness of the danger of mines and new unexploded ordnance in the Nagorno-Karabakh\n\nconflict zone and of other humanitarian challenges. In November 2020, the State Department indicated it would provide $5\n\nmillion in humanitarian assistance âto assist people affected by the recent fighting.â Prior to the conflict, several Members of\n\nCongress had supported a continuation of demining assistance. Some Members have called for the provision of new\n\nassistance related to the conflict and for a review of U.S. military aid to Azerbaijan and the Section 907 waiver. In the 117th\n\nCongress, Members of Congress may address immediate and longer-term consequences of the 2020 war, including assistance\n\nneeds, the future of international mediation efforts, and changes in regional power dynamics.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\nlink to page 4 link to page 4 link to page 6 link to page 7 link to page 8 link to page 8 link to page 10 link to page 10 link to page 15 link to page 16 link to page 16 link to page 19 link to page 20 link to page 21 link to page 22 link to page 23 link to page 24 link to page 24 link to page 5 link to page 13 link to page 17 link to page 25 Azerbaijan and Armenia: The Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict\n\nContents\n\nIntroduction ................................................................................................................... 1\n\nBackground.................................................................................................................... 1\n\nConflict Resolution Process ........................................................................................ 3\n\nConflict Resolution Efforts in 2018 and 2019................................................................. 4\n\nRelations with Russia and Turkey ................................................................................ 5\n\nRussia ................................................................................................................ 5\n\nTurkey ................................................................................................................ 7\n\nAutumn 2020 War ........................................................................................................... 7\n\nRole of Turkey ........................................................................................................ 12\n\nRole of Russia......................................................................................................... 13\n\nNovember 2020 Agreement ............................................................................................ 13\n\nImpact of the War in Armenia and Azerbaijan .................................................................... 16\n\nU.S. Responses ............................................................................................................. 17\n\nCongressional Response ........................................................................................... 18\n\nRelated U.S. Assistance.................................................................................................. 19\n\nDemining ............................................................................................................... 20\n\nCongressional Action on Assistance............................................................................ 21\n\nOutlook ....................................................................................................................... 21\n\nFigures\n\nFigure 1.

For the United States, the\n\nwar and its aftermath raise policy issues regarding relations with Armenia and Azerbaijan, post-\n\nconflict assistance and settlement efforts, and regional power shifts and dynamics between NATO\n\nal y Turkey and Russia (as wel as, potential y, neighboring Iran).\n\nDuring fighting from September to November 2020, Azerbaijani forces captured territoryâ\n\neventual y including the strategical y located town of Shusha (in Armenian, Shushi)âthrough\n\nseveral advances. Poised to attack Nagorno-Karabakhâs urban center of Stepanakert (in\n\nAzerbaijani, Khankendi), Azerbaijan ceased offensive operations after Armenia agreed to a cease-\n\nfire agreement mediated by the Russian Federation. The agreement obliged Armenian/Nagorno-\n\nKarabakh forces to withdraw from additional territories they had controlled since the 1990s and\n\nintroduced about 2,000 Russian troops into the conflict zone as peacekeeping forces.\n\nThe autumn 2020 war was a short but brutal conflict that ultimately did not resolve the disputed\n\npolitical status of Nagorno-Karabakh. However, the warâs local and regional consequences\n\ncontinue to unfold. The conflict led to the deaths of at least a few thousand armed personnel on\n\neach side and dozens of civilians. Azerbaijan recovered territories that had been lost to it for more\n\nthan a quarter of a century, and the Azerbaijani government has promised to make the investments\n\nnecessary to enable hundreds of thousands of Azerbaijanis displaced in the 1990s to return to the\n\nregion. Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh have gained a new sense of insecurity, tempered by the\n\npresence of Russian forces, and many remain displaced. A new balance of power exists between\n\nAzerbaijan and Armenia, and regional powers Russia and Turkey have increased their influence.\n\nThis report focuses on the Azerbaijan-Armenia conflict, the autumn 2020 war, and related U.S.\n\npolicy. It first provides brief historical background and then discusses the post-1994 conflict\n\nresolution process and the relationships of Azerbaijan and Armenia with regional powers Russia\n\nand Turkey. In addition, the report provides analysis of the autumn 2020 war, the November 2020\n\ncease-fire agreement, and the warâs domestic impact in Armenia and Azerbaijan. The report then\n\ndiscusses U.S. responses to the war, longer-term U.S. policy toward the conflict, and the role of\n\nCongress.\n\nFor a map of Armenia and Azerbaijan, including the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict zone prior to the\n\n2020 war, see Figure 1. For a more detailed map of the conflict zone prior to the 2020 war, see\n\nFigure 2. For a map of the November 2020 cease-fire boundaries, see Figure 3.\n\nBackground\n\nAzerbaijan and Armenia are located in the South Caucasus region, together with neighboring\n\nGeorgia. The South Caucasus is a region between the Black and Caspian Seas that is separated\n\nfrom Russia by the Greater Caucasus mountain range and also borders Iran and Turkey (see\n\nFigure 1). Azerbaijanis and Armenians historical y have intermixed but have distinct ethnic and\n\n1 T his report uses the term Nagorno-Karabakh, except where other terms are included in direct quotations.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n1\n\nAzerbaijan and Armenia: The Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict\n\nreligious identities (Azerbaijanis are mostly Muslim, Armenians mostly Christian), and they have\n\nfought bitter conflicts in the past.\n\nThe political and demographic history of Nagorno-Karabakh is fiercely contested. The regionâs\n\nmajority ethnic Armenian population claims a dominant historical presence in Nagorno-\n\nKarabakh. In the latter half of the 18th century, the region became the center of the larger\n\nKarabakh khanate, a semi-independent Turkic (early Azerbaijani) principality formal y\n\nsubordinated to Iran before it was conquered by the Russian Empire in the early 19th century. By\n\n1832, according to one scholar of the region, Armenians âconstituted an overwhelming majority\n\nof the populationâ in the highland territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and made up about one-third of\n\nthe population in the larger territory that was previously part of the former Karabakh khanate.2\n\nFigure 1. Armenia and Azerbaijan\n\n(line of control prior to the 2020 war)\n\nSource: Congressional Research Service (CRS), using data from\n\nthe U.S. Department of State, ESRI, Garmin, and ArcWorld.\n\nBoundaries are not necessarily authoritative.\n\nAzerbaijanis and Armenians fought for control over Nagorno-Karabakh and other territories\n\nduring a brief period of independence after Russiaâs 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Azerbaijan and\n\nArmenia were incorporated into the USSR in 1920-1922 as constituent republics. Over the\n\nobjection of Armenian Bolsheviks, Nagorno-Karabakh was assigned to Soviet Azerbaijan in 1921\n\nand was formal y established and demarcated in 1923. As part of the USSR through 1991,\n\nNagorno-Karabakh was official y an autonomous region (oblast) within Soviet Azerbaijan.\n\nAccording to a 1989 census, the region had a population of 189,000 (77% Armenian, 22%\n\nAzerbaijani).\n\nConflict arose in 1988, after the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh sought to transfer\n\njurisdiction of the region to Soviet Armenia. Soviet authorities declined to redraw the borders, but\n\nthe effort and ensuing mass mobilization and violent clashes sparked conflict between the\n\nArmenians in Nagorno-Karabakh, supported by Armenia, and Azerbaijan. The struggle led to\n\nviolence and the displacement of Armenians and Azerbaijanis outside Nagorno-Karabakh. The\n\nconflict further escalated in 1991, as the Soviet government sought to counter moves toward\n\n2 George A. Bournoutian, trans., Two Chronicles on the History of Karabagh (Costa Mesa, CA: Mazda Publishers,\n\n2004), p. 24 (n. 1).\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n2\n\nAzerbaijan and Armenia: The Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict\n\nindependence by Armenia and Azerbaijan, Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh declared\n\nindependence from Azerbaijan, and Azerbaijan abolished Nagorno-Karabakhâs autonomous\n\nstatus.\n\nAfter the December 1991 dissolution of the USSR, Armenian and Azerbaijani armed forces\n\nfought directly, with Azerbaijani forces suffering several major defeats. Armenia and Azerbaijan\n\nsigned a cease-fire in May 1994, leaving Armenian/Nagorno-Karabakh forces in control of most\n\nof Nagorno-Karabakh and several surrounding territories, in total representing about 14% of\n\nAzerbaijanâs land area. Observers estimate the conflict resulted in around 20,000 deaths and more\n\nthan 1 mil ion displaced persons. The displaced included about 500,000 Azerbaijanis from areas\n\nsurrounding Nagorno-Karabakh and the region itself, about 185,000 Azerbaijanis from Armenia,\n\nand more than 350,000 Armenians from Azerbaijan.3\n\nIn 1993, the United Nations Security Council passed four resolutions concerning the Azerbaijan-\n\nArmenia conflict. In addition to cal ing for a cessation of hostilities, the resolutions âreaffirm[ed]\n\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Azerbaijani Republic and of al other States in the\n\nregion,â as wel as the âinadmissibility of the use of force for the acquisition of territory.â The\n\nresolutions cal ed for âthe withdrawal of occupying forcesâ from ârecently occupied areasâ of\n\nAzerbaijan.4\n\nConflict Resolution Process\n\nTo facilitate peace talks between Azerbaijan and Armenia, several countries under the auspices of\n\nthe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) established the Minsk Group in\n\n1994, with the United States, France, and Russia serving as co-chair countries.5 Since 2007, the\n\nMinsk Group co-chairs have framed their settlement efforts on the basis of six âBasic Principles\n\nfor the Peaceful Settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh Conflictâ (also known as the Madrid\n\nPrinciples).6 The principles are as follows:\n\n1. Return of the territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijani control\n\n2. An interim status for Nagorno-Karabakh providing guarantees for security and\n\nself-governance\n\n3. A corridor linking Armenia to Nagorno-Karabakh\n\n4. Future determination of the final legal status of Nagorno-Karabakh through a\n\nlegal y binding expression of popular wil\n\n5. The right of al internal y displaced persons and refugees to return to their former\n\nplaces of residence\n\n3 Ethnic Kurds and Russians in Armenia and Azerbaijan also were displaced.

According\n\nto the OSCE, permanent members of the Minsk Group include, together with the co -chairs, Armenia, Azerbaijan,\n\nBelarus, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Finland, and T urkey, as well as the OSCEâs current chairing state, together with the\n\nprevious and succeeding chairs.

International security guarantees that would include a peacekeeping operation\n\nArmenia and Azerbaijan conducted negotiations on the basis of these principles, but they\n\nachieved little progress toward settlement. Armenian and Nagorno-Karabakh leaders sought to\n\nachieve a negotiated resolution that would ensure Nagorno-Karabakhâs separation from\n\nAzerbaijan, whether as an independent state or united with Armenia. They viewed territories\n\naround Nagorno-Karabakh occupied by Armenian/Nagorno-Karabakh forces as a buffer zone and\n\na bargaining chip for negotiations concerning Nagorno-Karabakhâs final status. In recent years,\n\nmany Armenians expressed support for the permanent retention of these territories, in which an\n\nestimated 17,000 of Nagorno-Karabakhâs 147,000 residents had settled.7\n\nAzerbaijani leaders insisted on Azerbaijanâs sovereignty and territorial integrity and on\n\nAzerbaijanisâ right to return to their homes. They also said Azerbaijan was prepared to use force\n\nto retake territories, if this could not be achieved through negotiations. Although Azerbaijani\n\nauthorities claimed sovereignty over both Nagorno-Karabakh and the surrounding regions, they\n\nemphasized the importance of first returning the surrounding territories to Azerbaijan and\n\noccasional y suggested a resolution to the political status of Nagorno-Karabakh could be\n\ndeferred.8\n\nSince the 1994 cease-fire until 2016, observers estimate that dozens of troops and civilians on\n\nboth sides were kil ed each year along the dividing âline of contact,â which was more than 150\n\nmiles long, as wel as along the Armenia-Azerbaijan border.9 In April 2016, a serious round of\n\nhostilities occurred over a three-day period; the fighting resulted in at least 200 reported\n\ncasualties and in Azerbaijan gaining control of two strategic heights in previously Armenian-held\n\nterritory.10 Russian mediation helped to establish a new cease-fire agreement.\n\nConflict Resolution Efforts in 2018 and 2019\n\nIn 2018, a change of government in Armenia gave rise to new efforts to address the long-\n\nsimmering conflict. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan became Armeniaâs first leader in\n\n20 years who is not original y from Nagorno-Karabakh.11 After Pashinyan came to power as the\n\nhead of a popular democratic movement, some observers were hopeful that Armenia and\n\nAzerbaijan could be encouraged to initiate new efforts to resolve the conflict or, at least, to reduce\n\ntensions. The United States, Russia, and France, as co-chairs of the Minsk Group, expressed\n\nrenewed interest in engagement and welcomed both governmentsâ wil ingness to take âconcrete\n\nmeasures to prepare the populations for peace.â12 Observers noted a decline of cease-fire\n\nviolations and casualties, and Armenia and Azerbaijan reportedly replaced military forces with\n\n7 For details, see International Crisis Group (ICG), Digging Out of Deadlock in Nagorno-Karabakh, December 20,\n\n2019.

Former Presidents Robert K ocharyan\n\n(1998-2008) and Serzh Sargsyan (2008-2018), both originally from Nagorno-Karabakh, played leading roles in\n\nNagorno-Karabakhâs independence movement .\n\n12 OSCE, â Press Statement by the Co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group,â January 6, 2019.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n4\n\nAzerbaijan and Armenia: The Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict\n\ncivilian security forces along parts of their international border.13 Many observers, however, were\n\nskeptical that a new conflict resolution effort could succeed.\n\nLike most Armenian politicians, Pashinyan has expressed firm support for Nagorno-Karabakhâs\n\nseparation from Azerbaijan. The day after he became prime minister, Pashinyan visited Nagorno-\n\nKarabakh and cal ed for the inclusion of local authorities in peace talks.14 In August 2019,\n\nPashinyan visited Nagorno-Karabakh, where he declared that the region âis Armeniaâperiod.â15\n\nThe Azerbaijani government said it would defend its claims to the region and rejected Armeniaâs\n\nproposal to include Nagorno-Karabakh authorities in talks.\n\nIn March 2019, Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev held an official meeting\n\nfacilitated by the Minsk Group co-chairs.16 A joint statement issued by the Armenian and\n\nAzerbaijani foreign ministers and the heads of delegation of the Minsk Group co-chairs\n\n(hereinafter, Minsk co-chairs) stated that the presidents âexchanged views about several key\n\nissues of the settlement process and ideas of substance [and] recommitted to strengthening the\n\ncease-fire and improving the mechanism for direct communication.â17\n\nIn a September 2019 meeting with the Armenian and Azerbaijani foreign ministers, the Minsk co-\n\nchairs ânoted the positive effects of the sidesâ efforts to minimize violence during the summer\n\nperiod, including the use of the existing direct communication links.â The Minsk co-chairs\n\nâencouraged the sides to minimize the use of rhetoric that is inflammatory or prejudges the\n\noutcome of negotiations.â18\n\nIn December 2019, the Minsk co-chairs took âpositive note of the relatively low level of violence\n\nalong the Line of Contact and international border and credit[ed] the sides for utilizing fully the\n\ndirect communication links between them to reduce the risk of escalation.â19 Despite\n\nexpectations, however, tensions between Azerbaijan and Armenia worsened in 2020, leading to a\n\nbrief border skirmish in July and to the autumn war, which caught many observers by surprise.\n\nRelations with Russia and Turkey\n\nRegional powers Russia and Turkey have played complex roles in the Azerbaijan-Armenia\n\nconflict. The historical and current ties of Armenia and Azerbaijan with both countries are\n\ndetailed in the following sections.\n\nRussia\n\nRussia has strong security and economic ties to Armenia. Many observers contend that Armenia\n\nhas retained such ties to Russia due to a widespread belief in Armenia that only Russia can\n\nprovide security guarantees against Azerbaijan and Turkey, with which Armenians have a\n\n13 Ilgar Gurbanov, â Karabakh Peace T alks Break Down as Azerbaijan and Armenia Operate at Cross-Purposes,â\n\nEurasia Daily Monitor, March 4, 2019.\n\n14 Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), âArmeniaâs Pashinian Calls for Karabakh Leadersâ Involvement in\n\nPeace T alks,â May 9, 2018.\n\n15 Joshua Kucera, âPashinyan Calls for Unification Between Armenia and Karabakh,â Eurasianet, August 6, 2019.\n\n16 Before this meeting, the two presidents had met informally three times on the sidelines of international meetings.\n\n17 OSCE, â Joint Statement by the Foreign Ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan and the Co -chairs of the OSCE Minsk\n\nGroup,â March 29, 2019.\n\n18 OSCE, âPress Statement by the Co-chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group,â September 25, 2019.\n\n19 OSCE, âJoint Statement by the Heads of Delegation of the OSCE Minsk Group Co-chair Countries,â December 5,\n\n2019.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n5\n\nlink to page 10 Azerbaijan and Armenia: The Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict\n\ntraumatic and difficult history (see âTurkey,â below). At the same time, many Armenians have\n\nquestioned Russiaâs reliability as a security guarantor and economic partner. After Armeniaâs\n\n2018 change in government, the countryâs political leadership pursued democracy and\n\ngovernance reforms that put a new strain on its relationship with Russia.\n\nRussia guarantees Armeniaâs security through collective and bilateral treaties. Both countries are\n\nmembers of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO). Member states of the CSTO\n\ncommit to defend the territorial integrity of other CSTO members in the event of aggression.\n\nRussia and Armenia also have a bilateral agreement that commits Russian troops stationed in\n\nArmenia to provide for Armeniaâs security.20 These commitments do not official y extend to\n\nNagorno-Karabakh, however. Prior to the autumn 2020 conflict, observers debated whether and\n\nunder what circumstances Russia would intervene overtly if hostilities were to resume.21\n\nRussia maintains a military presence in Armenia at the 102nd military base, located in Gyumri.\n\nThe base is estimated to house around 3,000-4,000 soldiers in one motor rifle brigade (consisting\n\nof three motor rifle battalions and one tank battalion), one squadron of Mig-29 multi-role fighters,\n\nair defense systems, and various attack and transport helicopters.22 Although the base is not\n\nequipped with Russiaâs latest frontline equipment, it represents a significant force for Armeniaâs\n\nterritorial defense. In 2016, Russia and Armenia concluded an agreement to host a joint air\n\ndefense network that integrates Russiaâs capabilities in the region.23\n\nAzerbaijan and Russia also have maintained good relations. Since the 1990s, Azerbaijan has been\n\nled by authoritarian governments that have sought to maintain independence from Russia. At the\n\nsame time, these governments have sought Moscowâs support to balance domestic and\n\ninternational pressures.\n\nRussia is a major military supplier to both Armenia and Azerbaijan. Both countries primarily\n\noperate Russian and upgraded Soviet-era equipment, including tanks and artil ery. Prior to the\n\nautumn 2020 war, Russia al egedly pursued a policy of parity so neither side would gain a\n\nsignificant advantage over the other. In doing so, Russia balanced Azerbaijanâs purchases of\n\nadvanced weaponry by providing Armenia with weapons and military equipment at subsidized\n\nprices and through loans. Russia has provided Armenia with advanced capabilities, such as the\n\n9K720 Iskander-M short-range bal istic missile and SU-30SM fighters.24 In recent years, Russia\n\napparently has been unwil ing to provide Azerbaijan with its most advanced weaponry, causing\n\nAzerbaijan to diversify its arms purchases away from Russia and toward other international\n\nsuppliers.25\n\n20 RFE/RL, âRussia, Armenia Sign Extended Defense Pact,â August 19, 2010; Azad Garibov, âPashinyan T ries to\n\nLeverage Armeniaâs CST O Membership Against Azerbaijan,â Eurasia Daily Monitor, December 13, 2019.\n\n21 See, for example, RFE/RL, âRussian-Armenian Defense Pact âWill Prevent New War in Karabakh,ââ August 18,\n\n2010; Joshua Kucera, âAzerbaijan: Russia Stopped U.S. from âBreaking Armeniaâs Resistanceâ in 2016,â Eurasianet,\n\nJuly 14, 2017.\n\n22 International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), The Military Balance 2020, February 13, 2020, p. 208.\n\nHereinafter, IISS, Military Balance.\n\n23 Reuters, âArmenia Ratifies Agreement on Joint Air-Defense System with Russia,â June 30, 2016.\n\n24 T hese advanced systems played little role in the 2020 war.

In support of Azerbaijan, Turkey shut its land border with Armenia in 1993,\n\nleaving Armenia with land access to Georgia in the north and Iran in the south.\n\nTurkey-Armenia relations are further strained by a dispute over the World War I-era internal\n\ndeportation and mass kil ings of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, which Armenia recognizes as\n\ngenocide but the Turkish government does not. In 2019, the U.S. House of Representatives and\n\nthe U.S. Senate agreed to separate resolutions expressing their sense that it is the policy of the\n\nUnited States âto commemorate the Armenian Genocide through official recognition and\n\nremembranceâ (H.Res. 296, S.Res. 150).26\n\nTurkish authorities frequently have stated that Armenian withdrawal from Azerbaijani territories\n\nis a condition for normalization of relations. In 2009, Armenia and Turkey launched a process of\n\nrapprochement to reopen their land border and restore diplomatic relations. Partly due to\n\nAzerbaijanâs influence on the Nagorno-Karabakh issue, however, Turkeyâs parliament did not\n\nratify the agreed protocols. The Armenian government also faced domestic opposition to the\n\nprotocols and, in the absence of Turkish ratification, eventual y suspended its efforts in the\n\nrapprochement process.27 Armenia official y canceled the protocols in 2018.28 Now that Armenian\n\nforces have withdrawn from Azerbaijani territories, some observers have speculated about the\n\nimpact of the 2020 war on Turkish-Armenian relations.29\n\nAutumn 2020 War\n\nOn September 27, 2020, major new fighting erupted between Azerbaijan and Armenian/Nagorno-\n\nKarabakh forces defending Nagorno-Karabakh.30 In previous months, political tensions between\n\nArmenia and Azerbaijan had increased.31 Between July 12 and July 16, 2020, Armenia and\n\nAzerbaijan exchanged artil ery fire along their border, some 185 miles north of Nagorno-\n\nKarabakh. Although it is unclear what precisely sparked the July conflict, some analysts believe\n\nthe events reflected an unintended escalation rather than a premeditated action.32 The conflict\n\nBlog, September 18, 2017; Ilgar Gurbanov, â Azerbaijanâs Acquisitions of New Missile Systems from Belarus and\n\nIsrael: T he Domestic and Regional Context,â Eurasia Daily Monitor, June 19, 2018; Ilgar Gurbanov, âMilitary\n\nProcurements on Armeniaâs and Azerbaijanâs Defense Agendas,â CACI Analyst, March 27, 2019.\n\n26 For more on U.S. policy and congressional action on this issue, see CRS Report R41368, Turkey: Background and\n\nU.S. Relations, by Jim Zanotti and Clayton T homas.\n\n27 For more, see David L.

While nominally independent, Nagorno-Karabakh forces reportedly have operated as a branch of the\n\nArmenian military under a combined command-and-control system.

In Azerbaijan, tens of thousands of protestors cal ed on the government to react with\n\ngreater force; after some protestors temporarily occupied Azerbaijanâs parliament, protests were\n\nforcibly dispersed.34 On July 16, Azerbaijani President Aliyev criticized Foreign Minister Elmar\n\nMammadyarov, a long-standing participant in conflict negotiations, for al eged passivity and\n\nreplaced him with then-Minister of Education Jeyhun Bayramov, a novice diplomat.35 In\n\nArmenia, Prime Minister Pashinyan cal ed to further strengthen âthe common security systemâ of\n\nArmenia and Nagorno-Karabakh and said âthe Azerbaijani myth that its army can defeat the\n\nArmenian army, and thus Armenia and Artsakh should make concessions, has vanished.â36\n\nAfter the July 2020 clashes, tensions between Armenia and Azerbaijan persisted. In July,\n\nAzerbaijani officials began to criticize Russian military transport flights to Armenia they al eged\n\nwere arms deliveries.

Purchases of advanced weapons systems improved Azerbaijanâs reconnaissance and\n\nprecision-strike capabilities, which may have contributed to a growth in Azerbaijani military\n\nconfidence. During the war, Azerbaijan relied heavily on the use of drones, including equipment\n\npurchased from Turkey and Israel, to identify, target, and attack Armenian defensive positions and\n\narmored units.44 Air defenses in Nagorno-Karabakh mainly consisted of older Soviet or Russian\n\nsystems, which were largely ineffective against newer Azerbaijani drones. Armenian/Nagorno-\n\nKarabakh forces suffered heavy armored equipment losses and were unable to coordinate reserves\n\nfor launching counterattacks against Azerbaijani forces.45 Nevertheless, they were able to repulse\n\ninitial Azerbaijani advances in mountainous terrain in the northern part of Nagorno-Karabakh.46\n\nThroughout October 2020, Azerbaijani mechanized units made significant headway in the\n\nsouthern lowlands between Nagorno-Karabakh (a largely mountainous territory) and Iran.\n\nAzerbaijani forces took territory in the regions of Fuzuli, Jabrayil, and Zangilan and eventual y\n\nsecured Azerbaijanâs entire border with Iran (for maps, see Figure 2 and Figure 3). Fighting also\n\nwas reported in the southern part of Nagorno-Karabakh, around the town of Hadrut.47 Azerbaijani\n\nforces then attempted to capture Lachin, a town strategical y situated along the road connecting\n\nArmenia with Stepanakert, Nagorno-Karabakhâs urban center. After heavy fighting, Armenian\n\ncounterattacks and artil ery repulsed Azerbaijani units.48\n\n42 Vasif Huseynov, âArmenia-Azerbaijan Conflict Ignites Again in Karabakh,â Eurasia Daily Monitor, September 28,\n\n2020.\n\n43 Ann M.

On October 7, 2020, Russian presidential spokesperson Dmitry\n\nPeskov said Russiaâs security commitments to Armenia via its membership in the CSTO âdo not\n\nextend to Karabakh.â67 Russian officials cal ed for cease-fire and stabilization talks, including\n\nthrough discussions with Turkish counterparts.68 On October 29, 2020, Russian President\n\nVladimir Putin said a âlong-term settlement [lies] in finding a balance of interests that would suit\n\nboth sides.... Everyone has their own truth. There are no simple solutions, since the knot is tied in\n\na very complicated way.â69\n\nOn November 9, 2020, Azerbaijani forces shot down a Russian Mi-24 helicopter inside Armenia,\n\nnear Azerbaijanâs Nakhichevan exclave located west of Armenia, kil ing two and wounding one.\n\nThe helicopter reportedly was escorting a Russian military convoy from Russiaâs 102nd military\n\nbase in Gyumri, Armenia.

One major immediate consequence of the agreement\n\nwas the deployment to the conflict zone of Russian forces to serve as a peacekeeping contingent.\n\n66 CRS Report R41368, Turkey: Background and U.S. Relations, by Jim Zanotti and Clayton T homas; CRS Insight\n\nIN11557, Turkey: U.S. Sanctions Under the Countering Am ericaâs Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) , by\n\nJim Zanotti and Clayton T homas.\n\n67 Moscow Times, âRussiaâs Security Guarantees for Armenia Donât Extend to Karabakh, Putin Says,â October 7, 2020.\n\n68 Al Jazeera, âArmenia-Azerbaijan Clashes: How the World Reacted,â September 27, 2020.\n\n69 T ASS Russian News Agency (T ASS), ââBalance of Interestsâ: Putinâs Formula for Settling Nagorno -Karabakh\n\nConflict,â October 29, 2020.\n\n70 Andrew E.

Cease-Fire Agreement of November 9, 2020\n\nSource: Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.\n\nNote: Map is unofficial. CRS is unable to verify the accuracy of indicated boundaries and areas of territorial\n\ncontrol.\n\nThe November 9, 2020, agreement consists of nine points. In addition to a cease-fire and\n\nexchange of prisoners and the dead, the points include the following:\n\nï· Return of territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijanâs control\n\nï· Deployment of almost 2,000 Russian peacekeepers to the conflict zone\n\nï· Establishment of a peacekeeping center to monitor the cease-fire\n\nï· Withdrawal of Armenian forces from the region\n\nï· Maintenance of a land corridor between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh\n\nï· Return of internal y displaced persons and refugees\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n14\n\nAzerbaijan and Armenia: The Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict\n\nï· Establishment of a land transport corridor across Armenia between the\n\nAzerbaijani mainland and the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhichevan (located west\n\nof Armenia)\n\nRegarding territorial control, the agreement states the opposing military forces are to remain at\n\ntheir current positions and Russian peacekeepers are to be deployed along the line of contact. In\n\npractice, this provision has al owed Azerbaijan to retain its wartime gains both around and within\n\nNagorno-Karabakh. In addition, the agreement required Armenian/Nagorno-Karabakh forces to\n\nwithdraw from additional territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh (specifical y, the Kalbajar,\n\nLachin, and Agdam regions).72 The withdrawal of Armenian forces from these regions has been\n\naccompanied by the departure of tens of thousands of ethnic Armenian residents from longtime\n\nsettlements in the southern part of Nagorno-Karabakh, as wel as from territories outside the\n\nregion that Armenians have settled in since the end of the war in the 1990s.73 Armenian civilians\n\nreportedly destroyed homes and other structures to prevent them from fal ing under Azerbaijani\n\ncontrol.74\n\nThe declaration does not explicitly address the political status of Nagorno-Karabakh or its official\n\nboundaries. Some observers contend the declaration replicates at least some of the long-standing\n\nbasic principles that for years have formed the basis of negotiations between Azerbaijan and\n\nArmenia via the facilitation of the Minsk Group.75 Other elements of these principles were not\n\nreplicated. A fundamental aspect of the basic principles is that they are considered as a single\n\npackage, to include agreement on âthe future determination of the final legal statusâ of Nagorno-\n\nKarabakh and guarantees for the regionâs security and self-governance; these latter points are not\n\nelements of the November 9, 2020, agreement. In addition, the basic principles assumed an\n\ninternational peacekeeping mission, not an exclusively Russian one.\n\nPer the November 9, 2020, agreement, Russia reportedly has deployed at least 1,960 soldiers, 90\n\narmored personnel carriers, and 380 vehicles and special equipment in a peacekeeping contingent\n\nto the conflict zone.76 These forces are said to be from Russiaâs 15th Separate Motor Rifle\n\nBrigade, which is Russiaâs designated peacekeeping unit. Russia is deploying observation posts\n\nalong the cease-fire line and in the Lachin corridor to monitor the truce, ensure residentsâ safety,\n\nand provide security for transit between Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh. Russian peacekeepers\n\nalso have secured some historic Armenian churches and other cultural centers.77 The agreement\n\nprovides for a peacekeeping center in Azerbaijan (outside the conflict zone) to monitor\n\n72 Armenia was to hand over Kelbajar by November 15, 2020; Agdam by November 20; and Lachin by December 1.\n\nAzerbaijan agreed to extend the deadline for Armenia to withdraw from Kelbajar until November 25 in respon se to\n\nrequests from Armenia.

These clashes have resulted in some casualties and the detention of\n\nmilitary personnel. The sides also have carried out prisoner exchanges.80\n\nImpact of the War in Armenia and Azerbaijan\n\nThe cease-fire agreement led to political turmoil in Armenia. In announcing the agreement,\n\nArmenian Prime Minister Pashinyan said it was âunspeakably painful for me personal y and for\n\nour peopleâ but the decision was based on âan in-depth analysis of the military situation and the\n\nassessment of the people who know the situation best.â Pashinyan said that although âthis is not a\n\nvictory,... this should become the start of the era of our national unification and rebirth.â81 The\n\nleader of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, Arayik Harutyunyan, confirmed his consent to the\n\nagreement.82\n\nAfter the November 9, 2020, agreement was announced, protestors in Armenia attacked\n\ngovernment buildings and temporarily occupied the Armenian parliament. Parliamentary\n\nChairman Ararat Mirzoyan reportedly was pulled from his car and beaten, leading to his\n\nhospitalization (two people were arrested and charged with assault).83 Protestors and opposition\n\npoliticians cal ed for Pashinyanâs resignation.\n\nOn November 14, 2020, the former head of Armeniaâs National Security Service (currently an\n\nopposition politician) was arrested âon suspicion of usurping power and preparing the\n\nassassinationâ of Pashinyan.84 Armeniaâs ministers of foreign affairs, defense, and economy\n\nresigned. Armenian President Armen Sarkissian urged the government to cal snap elections\n\n(Armeniaâs presidency is mainly a ceremonial position).85 Protests cal ing for Pashinyanâs\n\nresignation and new elections continued through December 2020.\n\nIn Azerbaijan, support for the military operation and the Azerbaijani government has been high,\n\nwith the outcome sparking mass celebrations. Upon signing the November 9, 2020, agreement,\n\nAzerbaijani President Aliyev cal ed it âour glorious victoryâ and said, âour peopleâs 30-year\n\n78 Suzan Fraser, âT urkish Parliament Approves Peacekeepers for Azerbaijan,â Associated Press, November 17, 2020.\n\n79 Pavel Felgenhauer, âT he Karabakh War Ends as Russian T roops Move In,â Eurasia Daily Monitor, November 12,\n\n2020; bne IntelliNews, âAzerbaijanâs Aliyev Calls on Armenia, Russia, T urkey and Iran to Assist in Creating\n\nNakhchivan Land Corridor,â December 2, 2020.\n\n80 RFE/RL, âAzerbaijan, Armenia Swap Prisoners as Part of Nagorno-Karabakh T ruce Deal,â December 14, 2020;\n\nRFE/RL, â Dozens of Armenian Soldiers âCapturedâ in Nagorno-Karabakh Raid,â December 16, 2020.\n\n81 Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Armenia, âMilitary Aggression of Azerbaijan: Chronicle of\n\nDevelopments 10.11.2020,â November 10, 2020, at https://www.mfa.am/en/awaa_chr/2020/11/10/w_nk_2020/10641.\n\n82 Gohar Hakobyan, âArayik Harutyunyan: âIf Military Operations Continued, We Would Have Lost All of Artsakh,ââ\n\nAravot, November 10, 2020.\n\n83 Ani Meljumyan and Joshua Kucera, âArmenian Government Under Attack Following War Defeat,â Eurasianet,\n\nNovember 10, 2020.\n\n84 RFE/RL, âArmenian Opposition Leader Detained, Accused of Plotting to Kill PM Pashinian,â November 14, 2020. 85 RFE/RL, âArmenian President Calls for Snap Elections as Government Faces Mounting Pressure over Karabakh\n\nDeal,â November 17, 2020.\n\nCongressional Research Service\n\n16\n\nAzerbaijan and Armenia: The Nagorno-Karabakh Conflict\n\nlonging wil come to an end.â86 After the war, some debate in Azerbaijan focused on the question\n\nof whether Azerbaijanâs armed forces prematurely ceased their offensive.87\n\nFamilies displaced from territories in and around Nagorno-Karabakh in the 1990s might have the\n\npossibility to return home. A mass return of Azerbaijanis likely would require major investments.\n\nTowns and settlements in the conflict zone are in various states of destruction or disrepair, and\n\nmines and unexploded ordnance pose risks to return.88\n\nU.S. Responses\n\nThe United States, as a Minsk Group co-chair, has sought to facilitate a resolution to the\n\nAzerbaijan-Armenia conflict that achieves a negotiated settlement of Nagorno-Karabakhâs\n\npolitical status, peaceably restores Azerbaijani control over territories surrounding Nagorno-\n\nKarabakh, and provides security for residents of and returnees to the conflict zone.\n\nThe Trump Administration made several efforts to halt the fighting in autumn 2020 and to restart\n\nnegotiations. On September 27, 2020, the U.S. Department of State expressed âalarmâ at âreports\n\nof large scale military action along the Line of Contactâ and âcondemn[ed] in the strongest terms\n\nthis escalation of violence.â89 The statement noted that Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun\n\nheld discussions with the foreign ministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan and urged an immediate\n\ncessation of hostilities. The statement also noted that âparticipation in the escalating violence by\n\nexternal parties would be deeply unhelpful and only exacerbate regional tensions.â In a\n\nSeptember 27 press briefing, President Trump responded to a question on the conflict. He noted\n\nthat âwe have a lot of good relationships in that area. Weâl see if we can stop it.â90\n\nOn October 1, President Trump joined the presidents of Russia and France to issue a trilateral\n\nstatement âcondemn[ing] in the strongest terms the recent escalation of violence along the Line of\n\nContact in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict zone.â91 The statement cal ed for âan immediate\n\ncessation of hostilities between the relevant military forcesâ and âon the leaders of Armenia and\n\nAzerbaijan to commit without delay to resuming substantive negotiations, in good faith and\n\nwithout preconditions.â\n\nOn October 23, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo met in Washington, DC, with the foreign\n\nministers of Armenia and Azerbaijan in separate meetings.

Both sides\n\nagreed, for example, not to deliberately target civilian populations, to facilitate the recovery and\n\nexchange of remains, and to prepare for an exchange of prisoners of war.95\n\nIn response to the November 9, 2020, agreement, Secretary Pompeo issued a statement that âthe\n\nUnited States welcomes the cessation of active hostilitiesâ and that âending the recent fighting is\n\nonly the first step toward achieving a peaceful, negotiated settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh\n\nconflict.â The statement indicated the United States would provide $5 mil ion in humanitarian\n\nassistance âto assist people affected by the recent fighting.â96 U.S. Ambassador to the OSCE\n\nJames Gilmore said, âwe are deeply concerned about the humanitarian situation on the ground ...\n\n[and] urge the sides to avoid actions that could result in the resumption of violence ... [and to]\n\ntake advantage of the cessation of violence to build a lasting peace.â97\n\nCongressional Response\n\nSeveral Members of the 116th Congress issued statements in response to the autumn 2020\n\noutbreak of armed conflict. On September 29, 2020, for example, the then-chairman of the House\n\nCommittee on Foreign Affairs issued a statement cal ing âon leaders in Azerbaijan and Armenia\n\nto take concrete steps to de-escalate the situation, end hostilities, and refrain from seizing territory\n\nacross the line of contact.â He also stated that âthe influence of external actors such as Turkey\n\nrecklessly meddling in the conflict is troubling.

In FY2018 and FY2019,\n\nthe United States provided at least $26.9 mil ion in obligated assistance to Azerbaijan under the\n\nDepartment of Defenseâs âSection 333â (global train-and-equip) authority to help build\n\nAzerbaijanâs capacity for southern border (i.e., Iran) and Caspian Sea maritime security\n\noperations.104\n\nFrom FY1998 to FY2019, the United States provided about $50 mil ion in humanitarian\n\nassistance for the Nagorno-Karabakh region through implementing partners âin support of\n\ndemining, shelter, water, microfinance, and health interventions.â105 The United States also has\n\nsupported conflict-related confidence-building activities in Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n\nDemining\n\nIn 2017, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) reported that in recent years,\n\nhumanitarian assistance for Nagorno-Karabakh had focused âon the life-saving clearance of\n\nminefields and contaminated battle areas, which continue to pose humanitarian risks and impede\n\nthe safe and effective use of this land.â106 In total, the United States has provided more than $17\n\nmil ion in assistance for demining in Nagorno-Karabakh.107 The United States has not provided\n\nassistance for demining in regions of Azerbaijan located outside of Nagorno-Karabakh.\n\nIn 2019, HALO Trust, a nongovernmental organization, began a new survey that uncovered\n\nadditional minefields within Nagorno-Karabakh.108 In an April 2019 budget hearing, then-USAID\n\nAdministrator Mark Green responded affirmatively to the question of whether USAID was\n\nâcommitted to completing the clearance of landmines and unexploded ordnances within the\n\ntraditional boundariesâ of Nagorno-Karabakh.109 Subsequently, some Members of Congress and\n\nmedia reports indicated the State Department and USAID did not intend to request new funding\n\nfor demining of newly surveyed minefields.110 It remains to be seen how the autumn 2020\n\n103 In 2011, Congress recommended that parity also apply to International Military Education and T raining programs.\n\nU.S. Congress, Conference Committee, Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies\n\nAppropriations Act, 2012, conference report to accompany H.R. 2055, 112th Cong., 1st sess., H.Rept. 112-331\n\n(Washington, DC: GPO, 2011), p. 1346.\n\n104 In past years, the Department of Defense also has used cooperative threat reduction and train -and-equip funds to\n\nsupport Azerbaijanâs capacity to conduct maritime nonproliferation and counterterrorism operations.

This amendment was reported by the Rules Committee as intended âto fund\n\nUSAIDâs demining program in Nagorno-Karabakh.â114 The amendment was not incorporated in\n\nthe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (P.L. 116-260).\n\nThe autumn 2020 war has raised awareness of the danger of mines and unexploded ordnance in\n\nthe Nagorno-Karabakh conflict zone and of other humanitarian chal enges. Some Members have\n\ncal ed for the provision of new assistance related to the conflict and for a review of U.S. military\n\naid to Azerbaijan and the Section 907 waiver.\n\nOutlook\n\nLocal and regional consequences of the autumn 2020 war continue to unfold. Many Armenians\n\nare newly displaced, including many who are permitted to return but unsure if they can safely do\n\nso. In Azerbaijan, the government is contemplating the return of hundreds of thousands of\n\nAzerbaijanis displaced from the conflict zone in the 1990s. The war did not resolve the political\n\nstatus of Nagorno-Karabakh, however, and it upended the long-standing OSCE Minsk Group\n\nconflict resolution framework.

What role should the United States play in these efforts?\n\nï· Should the United States provide new targeted aid to assist victims of the autumn\n\n2020 war and efforts to remove mines and unexploded ordnance? Should\n\nCongress reconsider the types and amounts of assistance the U.S. government\n\nprovides to Armenia and Azerbaijan? Should Congress consider how the war\n\nmight affect the Section 907 prohibition on aid to Azerbaijan and the waiver that\n\nenables assistance?\n\nï· How wil Russiaâs new military presence in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict zone\n\naffect Russiaâs regional power and influence?\n\nï· How wil the war and its aftermath impact Turkeyâs regional power and\n\ninfluence, including with regard to its relationship with Azerbaijan as a key\n\nweapons supplier (alongside Israel) and its interactions with Russia? Under what\n\ncircumstances might Turkey renew efforts to normalize relations with Armenia,\n\ngiven that Armenian/Nagorno-Karabakh forces have withdrawn from much of\n\nthe conflict zone? How would Armenia respond to such efforts?\n\nï· With Azerbaijan now in control of its full border with Iran, how wil Azerbaijanâs\n\nrelations with Iran and Iranâs minority Azerbaijani population develop?\n\nAuthor Information\n\nCory Welt\n\nAndrew S.
