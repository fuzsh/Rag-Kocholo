        "text": "By Anonymous\n\nThe year 2020 was a period of both notable progress and profound challenges for Armenia. The My Step–led government, which was elected after the Velvet Revolution swept the long-ruling Republican Party (HHK) aside in 2018, began the year with a continuation of its ambitious reform agenda, including in the judiciary, anticorruption mechanisms, and education. Beginning in March, the COVID-19 pandemic strained governance, safety, and public health, and led the government to declare a state of emergency in order to limit the virus’s spread. From late September, while the pandemic was ongoing, Armenia found itself drawn into a crisis of historic proportions as neighboring Azerbaijan launched a large-scale attack on the unrecognized but de facto independent Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh (often called Nagorno-Karabakh internationally, or Artsakh in Armenia), which is inhabited and governed by ethnic Armenians. Armenia has long aided the territory’s defense.\n\nAlthough the fighting almost fully took place outside the borders of Armenia, and while this report does not consider conditions in Nagorno-Karabakh, the impact of the war within the country was far-reaching and severe. On September 27, the authorities declared martial law, and although the country did not technically reach a state of full mobilization, the war dominated virtually every aspect of governance and civic life in the last months of the year. The war in Nagorno-Karabakh occurred after a series of deadly clashes in July along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border that, following a period of relative stability between the countries, emphasized how quickly violence can ignite. After 44 days of heavy fighting in the territory of the Republic of Nagorno-Karabakh, on November 9, Armenian prime minister Nikol Pashinyan announced a Russia-brokered armistice between Armenia and Azerbaijan. In a joint statement signed by Pashinyan, President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan, and Russian president Vladimir Putin, the parties agreed to a cessation of hostilities; the handover of much of the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh to Azerbaijan, save for a “rump republic,” the status of which remains unresolved; the deployment of 1,960 Russian peacekeepers for a minimum of five years, in conjunction with the withdrawal of Armenian troops; and the easing of transport and commercial routes in the region, which is to include a corridor through Armenia to link Azerbaijan to the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, an exclave. The statement also called for all prisoners of war and hostages to be returned, and for the resettlement of displaced persons and refugees in Nagorno-Karabakh and surrounding areas.\n\nThe ceasefire agreement, which entailed major concessions on the parts of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh, took most officials and the public by surprise and, amid the high tensions of the war, led to significant public anger and unrest in the days that followed. Moreover, Armenia’s military defeat and the terms of the statement sparked a political crisis, challenging trust in the government as well as the country’s security and sovereignty. A number of high-ranking officials resigned or were dismissed, and President Armen Sarkissian called for the resignation of the government and early elections. Taking advantage of a downtick in public confidence in the My Step government, extra-parliamentary opposition parties, fringe conservative groups, and members of the former HHK regime called for PM Pashinyan’s resignation and, by some indications, fomented public unrest. Although Pashinyan deflected calls to resign, he did concede in December to holding consultations with the opposition regarding snap elections. At year’s end, two of the most pressing postwar issues were prisoners of war (POWs) and the country’s border demarcation. Although the ceasefire agreement had called for the return of POWs and other captives, an unknown number of Armenian soldiers and civilians remained in Azerbaijani custody at year’s end, and reports of gross mistreatment and torture exacerbated public anger at the government’s failure to secure their return. The question of border demarcation along Syunik region in Armenia’s south—made necessary by cession of adjacent territory to Azerbaijan—also created new risks for national security and territorial integrity. The territorial transfer left some Armenian villages exposed to new Azerbaijani military positions and risked the future of a major highway that weaves across the de jure border.\n\nEven before the outbreak of war, national governance and policymaking were polarized in 2020. The My Step Alliance relied on its majority in the National Assembly to pass legislation, but a number of votes were harshly contested or boycotted by the two opposition parties in parliament, Prosperous Armenia and Bright Armenia. In May, a brawl broke out in the National Assembly after My Step deputy Sasun Mikayelyan punched Edmon Marukyan, chair of Bright Armenia, amid the latter’s speech disparaging another My Step deputy’s remarks about COVID-19 relief. Parliamentary tensions were also high in June, after the National Security Service raided the home of Gagik Tsarukyan, head of Prosperous Armenia and one of the country’s wealthiest individuals, announcing a large-scale investigation into allegations of illegal commercial activities, vote buying, and tax evasion. The National Assembly voted to strip Tsarukyan of his parliamentary immunity in a session boycotted by the Prosperous Armenia and Bright Armenia parties. The government also faced opposition outside the National Assembly from both the ousted HHK and its allies as well as fringe conservative groups, which sensationalized and often spread disinformation about policy proposals.\n\nAmid the rapid political changes of the past few years, the challenges posed by the pandemic, and the impact of the Armenia-Azerbaijan war, civil society organizations (CSOs) and independent media continued to be vital pillars of Armenia’s burgeoning democracy. During and after the war, civil society mobilization was remarkable. CSOs rushed to engage the international community, document human rights conditions, and meet unique societal needs created by the war, including for the tens of thousands of people who were displaced from Nagorno-Karabakh and sought shelter within Armenia or, following the armistice, needed resettlement. Operational conditions and the enabling environment for civil society have significantly improved in recent years, and CSOs have become an important check on the government. However, in 2020, progressive CSOs sustained attacks from fringe conservative groups that disseminated hate speech and disinformation about the organizations’ missions, painting the CSOs as “anti-Armenian” and jeopardizing their ability to operate and engage with the public. In November, following the announcement of the final ceasefire, rioters ransacked offices of the Open Society Foundation and the local RFE/RL service, Azatutyun. Although policymakers were open to and engaged with civil society input through most of 2020, the situation was more tenuous in November and December, in the aftermath of the war.\n\nIn March, as part of the state of emergency instituted to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus, authorities briefly restricted media from publishing any public health information that did not originate from official sources. In the face of domestic and international pressure, the government lifted the restriction shortly after its enactment. Domestic media were instrumental in covering the fighting in Nagorno-Karabakh and its impact in Armenia, often taking tremendous risks to report. There was also an influx of foreign media following the outbreak of the war, which were generally allowed to work without undue interference, although movement in border areas was at times restricted during periods of heavy fighting. The work of independent journalists was especially important as disinformation—from both internal and external sources—clouded the country’s information landscape, affecting public knowledge of issues ranging from the war, to COVID-19, to the work of CSOs.\n\nAgainst serious headwinds, the government made some progress on reform efforts in 2020, largely before the war. Judicial reform has been a top priority, and in 2020, the legislature resolved a crisis of legitimacy that had beleaguered the country’s Constitutional Court, which was widely seen as captured by the HHK. In June, the National Assembly approved a package of amendments that instituted a universal 12-year limit for all Constitutional Court judges, leading to the retirement and replacement of three of the court’s nine sitting members. The amendments were a step back from more extreme reform proposals. In 2019, the government had come under domestic and international criticism for attempting to pressure the court’s chair and HHK affiliate, Hrayr Tovmasyan, to resign. In 2020, Tovmasyan retained a seat on the court but not his chairmanship and was facing criminal charges for abuse of office. The courts remain among the weakest and least trusted of Armenia’s institutions, and serious judicial reform at all levels is critical to future democratic progress.\n\nThe National Assembly took a number of steps to institutionalize corruption prevention. The Corruption Prevention Commission, created in late 2019 to oversee financial disclosures and conflicts of interest of high-ranking public officials, completed its first year of operations in 2020, enforcing disclosure rules and making disclosure information easily accessible to enforcement bodies, journalists, and the public. Lawmakers approved legislation to create a new Anticorruption Committee, which will have prosecutorial powers and is scheduled to begin operations in 2021. Separately, a specialized Anticorruption Court is also scheduled to form in 2021. Civil society and professional organizations were in consultations with the government about this and other measures throughout the year.\n\nDomestic violence against women remained a serious issue, and stay-at-home orders amid the pandemic created obstacles for women seeking help. A 2017 domestic violence law, which emphasizes the preservation of families, offers an imperfect patchwork of protections for survivors. Women are also underrepresented in national, regional, and local governance. In November, the only woman in PM Pashinyan’s cabinet, Zaruhi Batoyan, resigned from her position as minister of labor and social affairs. Violence, harassment, and discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and related communities in Armenian society also remained significant. In a rare judicial victory in August, the Criminal Court of Appeal found that authorities had failed to properly investigate a violent attack against LGBT+ activists in Shurnukh. Investigations and prosecutions of such cases are generally incomplete, and there are no effective legal protections against crimes based on sexual orientation or identity.\n\nEven before the devastation of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war, the economic challenges for landlocked Armenia were significant. The country’s borders with Azerbaijan and Turkey (Azerbaijan’s ally) have long been closed, and the war further strained the country’s economy. Both the war and the armistice, highlighting the reach of regional powers Turkey and Russia, have exposed weaknesses in Armenia’s foreign relationships—particularly with the United States and the European Union—as well as the country’s own sovereignty.\n\nThe political crisis that followed the Second Karabakh War poses extraordinary challenges for democratic progress in 2021, including security risks along the Armenia-Azerbaijan border, low public trust in the current government, economic strain, and the toll of the COVID-19 pandemic. As snap elections may take place in 2021, the prospect and direction of further reforms are uncertain, since they are dependent on the makeup of the future government and the reestablishment of public trust."
