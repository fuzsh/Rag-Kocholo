        "text": "Key Findings\n\nIn 2022, 16 countries made changes to their statutory corporate income taxA corporate income tax (CIT) is levied by federal and state governments on business profits. Many companies are not subject to the CIT because they are taxed as pass-through businesses, with income reportable under the individual income tax. rates. Six countries—Colombia, South Sudan, Netherlands, Turkey, Chile, and Montenegro—increased their top corporate taxA tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local, state, and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services, goods, and activities. rates, while 10 countries—including France, Greece, and Monaco—reduced their corporate tax rates.\n\nComoros (50 percent), Puerto Rico (37.5 percent), and Suriname (36 percent) are the jurisdictions with the highest corporate tax rates in the world, while Barbados (5.5 percent), Turkmenistan (8 percent), and Hungary (9 percent) levy the lowest corporate rates. Sixteen jurisdictions do not impose a corporate tax.\n\nThe worldwide average statutory corporate income tax rate, measured across 180 jurisdictions, is 23.37 percent. When weighted by GDP, the average statutory rate is 25.43 percent.\n\nAsia has the lowest regional average rate at 19.52 percent, while South America has the highest regional average statutory rate at 28.38 percent. However, when weighted by GDP, Europe has the lowest regional average rate at 23.59 percent and South America has the highest at 32.64 percent.\n\nThe average top corporate rate among EU27 countries is 21.16 percent, 23.57 percent in OECD countries, and 32 percent in the G7.\n\nThe worldwide average statutory corporate tax rate has consistently decreased since 1980 but has leveled off in recent years.\n\nThe average statutory corporate tax rate has declined in every region since 1980.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn 1980, corporate tax rates around the world averaged 40.11 percent, and 46.52 percent when weighted by GDP.[1] Since then, countries have recognized the impact that high corporate tax rates have on business investment decisions; in 2022, the average is now 23.37 percent, and 25.43 when weighted by GDP, for 180 separate tax jurisdictions.[2]\n\nDeclines have been seen in every major region of the world, including in the largest economies. In the United States, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act brought the country’s statutory corporate income tax rate from the fourth highest in the world closer to the middle of the distribution.[3]\n\nAsian and European countries tend to have lower corporate income tax rates than countries in other regions, and many developing countries have corporate income tax rates that are above the worldwide average.\n\nToday, most countries have corporate tax rates below 30 percent.\n\nNotable Corporate Tax Rate Changes in 2022\n\nSixteen countries changed their statutory corporate income tax rates in 2022. Six countries increased their top corporate rates: Colombia (31 percent to 35 percent), South Sudan (25 percent to 30 percent), Netherlands[4] (25 percent to 25.8 percent), Turkey (20 percent to 23 percent), Chile (10 percent to 27 percent), and Montenegro (9 percent to 15 percent).\n\nTen countries across four continents—Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Zambia, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Tajikistan, France, Greece, Monaco, and French Polynesia—reduced their corporate tax rates in 2022. The tax rate reductions ranged from just 1.5 percentage points in Monaco to a 5 percentage point reduction in Seychelles, Sierra Leone, Zambia, and Tajikistan.\n\nTable 1.

Additionally, the United Arab Emirates and South Africa also plan to amend their corporate income tax rates in 2023.\n\nIn Austria, the corporate income tax will be cut from 25 percent to 24 percent in 2023 and further to 23 percent in 2024.[5]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the standard statutory corporate income tax rate is due to increase from 19 percent to 25 percent on April 1, 2023.[6]\n\nIn Turkey, the corporate income tax was temporarily increased from 20 percent to 25 in 2021 and 23 percent in 2022. However, in 2023 the corporate income tax will return to 20 percent.[7]\n\nThe United Arab Emirates announced the introduction of a federal corporate tax in mid-2023. The proposed corporate income tax rate of 9 percent on taxable incomeTaxable income is the amount of income subject to tax, after deductions and exemptions. For both individuals and corporations, taxable income differs from—and is less than—gross income. above AED 375,000 (USD 100,000) would apply to all business activities, while a different rate might apply to large multinationals. However, the new corporate income tax will not apply to the extraction of natural resources as these activities are already subject to taxation in the Emirates.[8]\n\nIn South Africa, the corporate income tax will be cut from the current 28 percent to 27 percent for fiscal assessment periods that end on March 31, 2023, or after.[9]\n\nThe Highest and Lowest Corporate Tax Rates in the World\n\nOne hundred and forty-two of the 225 separate jurisdictions surveyed for the year 2022 have corporate tax rates at or below 25 percent.[10] One hundred and eighteen have tax rates above 20 percent but below or at 30 percent. The average tax rateThe average tax rate is the total tax paid divided by taxable income. While marginal tax rates show the amount of tax paid on the next dollar earned, average tax rates show the overall share of income paid in taxes. among the 225 jurisdictions is 22.22 percent.[11] The United States has the 81st highest corporate tax rate with a combined federal and state statutory rate of 25.81 percent.[12]\n\nThe 20 countries with the highest statutory corporate income tax rates span almost every region, albeit unequally. While eight of the top 20 countries are in Africa, Oceania appears only once and Europe twice. Of the remaining jurisdictions, four are in North America, and five are in South America.\n\nTable 2. 20 Highest Statutory Corporate Income Tax Rates in the World, 2022 Country Continent Tax Rate Comoros* Africa 50% Puerto Rico North America 37.5% Suriname South America 36% Argentina South America 35% Chad Africa 35% Colombia South America 35% Cuba North America 35% Equatorial Guinea Africa 35% Guinea Africa 35% Malta Europe 35% Sudan Africa 35% Sint Maarten (Dutch part) North America 34.5% American Samoa Oceania 34% Brazil South America 34% Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) South America 34% Cameroon Africa 33% Saint Kitts and Nevis North America 33% Mozambique Africa 32% Namibia Africa 32% Portugal Europe 31.5%\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, the 20 countries with the lowest non-zero statutory corporate tax rates all charge rates at or below 15 percent. Nine countries have statutory rates of 10 percent, five being small European nations (Andorra, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Kosovo, and Macedonia). The only two OECD members represented among the bottom 20 countries are Hungary and Ireland. Hungary reduced its corporate income tax rate from 19 to 9 percent in 2017. Ireland is known for its low 12.5 percent rate, in place since 2003.\n\nTable 3. 20 Lowest Statutory Corporate Income Tax Rates in the World, 2022 (Excluding Jurisdictions with a Corporate Income Tax Rate of Zero Percent) Country Continent Tax Rate Barbados North America 5.5% Turkmenistan Asia 8% Hungary Europe 9% Andorra Europe 10% Bosnia and Herzegovina Europe 10% Bulgaria Europe 10% Kosovo, Republic of Europe 10% Kyrgyzstan Asia 10% Paraguay South America 10% Qatar Asia 10% The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Europe 10% Timor-Leste Oceania 10% China, Macao Special Administrative Region Asia 12% Republic of Moldova Europe 12% Cyprus Europe 12.5% Gibraltar Europe 12.5% Ireland Europe 12.5% Liechtenstein Europe 12.5% Albania Europe 15% Georgia Asia 15%\n\nSources: OECD, “Table II.1. Statutory corporate income tax rate”; PwC, “Worldwide Tax Summaries – Corporate Taxes”; Bloomberg Tax, “Country Guides – Corporate Tax Rates”; and researched individually, see Tax Foundation, “worldwide-corporate-tax-rates.”\n\nOf the 225 jurisdictions surveyed, 16 currently do not impose a general corporate income tax. Except for the United Arab Emirates, all these jurisdictions are small, island nations. A handful, such as the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, are well known for their lack of corporate taxes.\n\nTable 4.

South America has the highest average statutory corporate tax rate among all regions at 28.38 percent. Asia has the lowest average statutory corporate tax rate among all regions at 19.52 percent.\n\nWhen weighted by GDP, South America has the highest average statutory corporate tax rate at 32.64 percent, while Europe has the lowest at 23.59 percent.\n\nIn general, larger and more industrialized nations tend to have higher corporate income tax rates than smaller nations. The G7, which is comprised of the seven wealthiest nations in the world, has an average statutory corporate income tax rate of 26.77 percent and a weighted average rate of 26.24 percent. OECD member states have an average statutory corporate tax rate of 23.57 percent and a rate of 25.83 percent when weighted by GDP. The BRICS[13] have an average statutory rate of 27.40 percent and a weighted average statutory corporate income tax rate of 26.06 percent.\n\nTable 5. Average Corporate Tax Rate by Region or Group, 2022 Region Average Rate Average Rate Weighted by GDP Number of Countries Covered Africa 27.60% 27.50% 50 Asia 19.52% 24.93% 47 Europe 19.74% 23.59% 39 North America 25.33% 26.13% 24 Oceania 23.75% 29.72% 8 South America 28.38% 32.64% 12 G7 26.32% 26.22% 7 OECD 23.57% 25.83% 38 BRICS 27.40% 26.06% 5 EU27 21.16% 25.28% 27 G20 26.77% 26.24% 19 World 23.37% 25.43% 180\n\nSources: Statutory corporate income tax rates are from OECD, “Table II.1. Statutory corporate income tax rate”; PwC, “Worldwide Tax Summaries – Corporate Taxes;” Bloomberg Tax, “Country Guides – Corporate Tax Rates,” and some jurisdictions researched individually, see Tax Foundation, “worldwide-corporate-tax-rates.” GDP calculations are from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, “International Macroeconomics Data Set.”\n\nThe following map illustrates the current state of corporate tax rates around the world. Countries in Africa and South America tend to have higher corporate tax rates than Asian and European jurisdictions. Oceania and North America’s corporate tax rates tend to be close to the world average.\n\nDistribution of Corporate Tax Rates\n\nOnly three tax jurisdictions impose a corporate income tax at statutory rates greater than 35 percent. [14] The following chart shows a distribution of corporate income tax rates among 225 jurisdictions in 2022. A plurality of countries (118 total) impose a rate above 20 percent and below or at 30 percent. Eighteen jurisdictions have a statutory corporate tax rate above 30 percent and below or at 35 percent. Eighty-six jurisdictions have a statutory corporate tax rate below or at 20 percent, and 204 jurisdictions have a corporate tax rate below or at 30 percent.\n\nThe Decline of Corporate Tax Rates since 1980 Leveled off in Recent Years\n\nOver the past 42 years, corporate tax rates have consistently declined on a global basis. In 1980, the unweighted average worldwide statutory tax rate was 40.11 percent. Today, the average statutory rate stands at 23.37 percent—a 42 percent reduction.[15]\n\nDespite a general decline in corporate tax rates around the world, OECD and non-OECD countries have also become more reliant on revenue from corporate income taxes. One cause for this change has been a shift in the jurisdictions included.[16] Secondly, the negative revenue impact of the decline in corporate tax rates was generally offset by reducing or abolishing tax relief policies. [17]\n\nThe weighted average statutory rate has remained higher than the simple average over this period. Prior to U.S. tax reform in 2017, the United States was largely responsible for keeping the weighted average higher, given its relatively high tax rate, as well as its significant contribution to global GDP. Figure 3 shows the significant impact the change in the U.S. corporate rate had on the worldwide weighted average. The weighted average statutory corporate income tax rate has declined from 46.52 percent in 1980 to 25.43 percent in 2022, representing a 45 percent reduction over the 42 years surveyed.\n\nOver time, more countries have shifted to taxing corporations at rates of 30 percent or lower, with the United States following this trend with its tax changes at the end of 2017. The largest shift occurred between 1990 and 2000, with 48 percent of countries imposing a statutory rate below 30 percent in 2000 and only 27 percent of countries in the dataset imposing a statutory rate below 30 percent in 1990. This trend continued between 2000 and 2010, with 78 percent of countries imposing a statutory rate below 30 percent in 2010.[18]\n\nAll regions saw a net decline in average statutory rates between 1980 and 2022. The average declined the most in Europe, with the 1980 average of 44.6 percent dropping to 19.74 percent—a 56 percent decline. South America has seen the smallest decline, with the average only decreasing by 23 percent, from 36.66 percent in 1980 to 28.38 percent in 2022.\n\nSouth America saw two periods, 1990-2000 and 2010-2022, during which the average statutory rate increased slightly by less than one percentage point, although the average rate decreased over the full 42-year period.\n\nConclusion\n\nWorldwide and regional average top statutory corporate tax rates have declined over the past four decades but have leveled off in recent years. Of 225 jurisdictions around the world, only six have increased their top corporate income tax rate in 2022, a trend expected to hold steady as countries have more efficient tax types to turn towards.[19]\n\nStay informed on the tax policies impacting you.\n\nSubscribe to get insights from our trusted experts delivered straight to your inbox.\n\nSubscribe\n\nAppendix\n\nNote: All data and methodological notes are accessible in our GitHub repository.\n\nThe Dataset\n\nScope\n\nThe dataset compiled for this publication includes the 2022 statutory corporate income tax rates of 225 sovereign states and dependent territories around the world. Tax rates were researched only for jurisdictions that are among the around 250 sovereign states and dependent territories that have been assigned a country code by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). As a result, zones or territories that are independent taxing jurisdictions but do not have their own country code are generally not included in the dataset.\n\nIn addition, the dataset includes historic statutory corporate income tax rates from 1980 to 2021. However, these years cover tax rates of fewer than 225 jurisdictions due to missing data points. Please let Tax Foundation know if you are aware of any sources for historic corporate tax rates that are not mentioned in this report, as we constantly strive to improve our datasets.\n\nTo be able to calculate average statutory corporate income tax rates weighted by GDP, the dataset includes GDP data for 180 jurisdictions. When used to calculate average statutory corporate income tax rates, either weighted by GDP or unweighted, only these 180 jurisdictions are included (to ensure the comparability of the unweighted and weighted averages).\n\nDefinition of Selected Corporate Income Tax Rate\n\nThe dataset captures standard top statutory corporate income tax rates levied on domestic businesses. This means:\n\nThe dataset does not reflect special tax regimes, including but not limited to patent boxes, offshore regimes, or special rates for specific industries.\n\nA number of countries levy lower rates for businesses below a certain revenue threshold. The dataset does not capture these lower rates.\n\nA few countries levy gross revenue taxes on businesses instead of corporate income taxes. Since the tax rates of a corporate income tax and a gross revenue tax are not comparable, these countries are excluded from the dataset.\n\nSome countries have a separate tax rate for nonresident companies. This dataset does not consider nonresident tax rates that differ from the general corporate rate.\n\nSources\n\nTax Rates for the Year 2022\n\nFor OECD countries, the statutory corporate income tax rates used are the combined corporate income tax rates provided by the OECD; see OECD, “Table II.1. Statutory corporate income tax rate,” updated May 2022, https://stats.oecd.org/index.aspx?DataSetCode=Table_II1. The main source for non-OECD jurisdictions is the statutory rates provided by PwC, “Worldwide Tax Summaries – Corporate Taxes,” 2022, https://taxsummaries.pwc.com/. The study also relies on Bloomberg Tax, “Country Guides – Corporate Tax Rates,” accessed in November 2022, https://www.bloomberglaw.com/product/tax/toc_view_menu/3380. Jurisdictions that are not part of these sources were researched individually. The source for each of these jurisdictions is listed in a GitHub repository; see Tax Foundation, “worldwide-corporate-tax-rates,” GitHub, https://github.com/TaxFoundation/worldwide-corporate-tax-rates.\n\nTax Rates for the Years 1980-2021\n\nTax rates for the time frame between 1980 and 2021 are taken from a dataset compiled by the Tax Foundation over the last few years. These historic rates come from multiple sources: PwC, “Worldwide Tax Summaries – Corporate Taxes,” 2010-2019; KPMG, “Corporate Tax Rate Survey,” 1998- 2003; KPMG, “Corporate tax rates table,” 2003-2019; EY, “Worldwide Corporate Tax Guide,” 2004-2019; OECD, “Historical Table II.1 – Statutory corporate income tax rate,” 1999, http://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/tax-database.htm#C_CorporateCaptial; the University of Michigan – Ross School of Business, “World Tax Database,” https://www.bus.umich.edu/otpr/otpr/default.asp; and numerous government websites.\n\nGross Domestic Product (GDP) for the years 1980-2022\n\nGDP calculations are from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, “International Macroeconomics Data Set.” For years prior to 1999, U.S. Department of Agriculture, “International Macroeconomics Data Set – Historical Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Growth Rates of GDP for Baseline Countries/Regions (in billions of 2010 dollars) 1980-2018,” Jan. 3, 2020, https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/international-macroeconomic-data-set/.\n\nFor years following 1999, U.S. Department of Agriculture, “International Macroeconomics Data Set – Projected Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Growth Rates of GDP for Baseline Countries/Regions (in billions of 2015 dollars) 2012-2033,” Jan. 10, 2022, https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/international-macroeconomic-data-set/; and U.S. Department of Agriculture, “International Macroeconomics Data Set – Historical Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Growth Rates of GDP for Baseline Countries/Regions (in billions of 2015 dollars) 2000-2020,” Jan. 10, 2022, https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/international-macroeconomic-data-set/.\n\nList of all Corporate Tax Rates in 2022\n\nTable 6.

Unless otherwise noted, calculated averages of statutory corporate income tax rates only include jurisdictions for which GDP data is available for all years between 1980 and 2022. For 2022, the dataset includes statutory corporate income tax rates of 225 jurisdictions, but GDP data is available for only 180 of these jurisdictions, reducing the number of jurisdictions included in calculated averages to 180. For years prior to 2022, the number of countries included in calculated averages varies by year due to missing corporate tax rates; that is, the 1980 average includes statutory corporate income tax rates of 73 jurisdictions, compared to 180 jurisdictions in 2022.\n\n[2] Statutory corporate income tax rates are from OECD, “Table II.1.

For example, the combined German corporate tax rate is 29.83 percent which includes both the federal rate of 15 percent and accounts for municipal trade taxes which range from 14 to 17 percent.\n\n[13] BRICS is a group of countries with major emerging economies.
