        "text": "While Armenia’s democratization was impeded by the ongoing conflict with Azerbaijan—the dominant subject of public discourse in 2022 —and domestic factors, the country maintained a somewhat positive trajectory as the year progressed. Anticorruption efforts gained momentum with the November opening of a specialized court, independent outlets made a meaningful impact in an otherwise polarized media environment, and local elections proved largely competitive. In December, the International Monetary Fund offered a guarded but positive economic outlook when it finalized a financial support package for the country. Armenian civil society was also active and influential. However, governing institutions displayed continued shortcomings, the judiciary was not fully independent, and the national electoral environment lacked pluralism.\n\nArmenia’s security situation remained precarious, with Azerbaijani forces making an incursion into Armenia proper in September. The Armenian government’s understanding of Russia as a security ally shifted, primarily due to Moscow’s war against Ukraine; as the Russian-led regional security architecture collapsed, Yerevan moved to break out of Moscow’s orbit and pivot towards the United States. Then US House of Representatives speaker Nancy Pelosi visited in September and a US congressional delegation visited in October, with the delegation’s leader making generally supportive statements regarding Yerevan’s position on the conflict. The Armenian government, lacking its own military deterrence capabilities, has relied more on its diplomatic coordination with the United States, European Union (EU), and France. The government has additionally sought military cooperation and support from France, the United States, and India.\n\nAs Armenia faced continued security challenges, the political opposition sought to advance a security-versus-stability narrative, contending that the country’s relatively new political arrangement has undermined its security. In May, the opposition—composed of the Armenia Alliance of former president Robert Kocharyan and the I Have Honor faction of former president Serzh Sargsyan (not related to Armen)—staged demonstrations that lasted five weeks. They aimed to push the government of Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan to resign and make way for an opposition coalition. Their efforts to portray bilateral negotiations with the Azerbaijani government as an act of disloyalty ultimately did not gain public acceptance, with organizers clearing out of a major Yerevan intersection in mid-June.\n\nThe Pashinyan government continued to enact reforms in 2022, primarily concentrating on the military, judiciary, anticorruption efforts, and the economy. The government dismissed several key officers and their deputies during the year as it sought to replace the armed forces’ Soviet-era bureaucratic structure with a model meant to be more meritocratic. With that goal in mind, Yerevan sought closer ties with military officials and institutions in the United States and France. In September, local media reported that a draft of the 2023 budget included a 47 percent increase in military spending.\n\nThe government continued to pursue its judicial reforms in 2022, with an eye to bolstering anticorruption efforts. The judiciary has historically suffered from the influence of the pre-2018 regime and its constitutional, structural, and legislative decisions. Despite the country’s recent democratization, complex obstacles, legal barriers, and pockets of resistance make reform exceedingly difficult. The struggle at the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC), which disciplines and sanctions judges, is a case in point. SJC chairman Ruben Vartazaryan, who is affiliated with the pre-2018 regime, was formally and controversially dismissed in June 2022. His replacement with Gagik Jhangiryan led to a major scandal with the revelation that Jhangiryan had intimated criminal risks for Vartazaryan should he remain chairman. That scandal ended with Jhangiryan’s own resignation in July. The greater issue was resolved with the October election of Justice Minister Karen Andreasyan, who is considered a reformist, to the chair. A similar process played out in 2020 with the restructuring of the Constitutional Court.\n\nIn April 2021, the National Assembly adopted legislation on the creation of the Anti-Corruption Court, which is meant to root out systemic corruption and hold current and former public officials to account. Judges were vetted and appointed between July and August 2022.\n\nArmenia’s local politics and media sector both showed improvement in 2022. While the media market still bears the consequences of polarization, independent outlets and investigative journalists exerted more influence and Armenian media consumers benefited from a relatively open online environment. Investigative journalists played a role in the January resignation of President Armen Sargsyan, demonstrating the growing influence of Armenia’s burgeoning independent media. The number of lawsuits against media outlets and journalists fell by half from 2021 to 2022, while the removal of the “grave insults” criminal-code provision enhanced media freedom.\n\nLocal elections held in 2022 were pluralistic and competitive, with a large number of political parties participating and winning representation. Civil Contract, the ruling party, won 8 of the 18 municipal elections held in September, and its conduct during the polls was largely constructive and in line with democratic norms. Notably, four municipal elections did not produce majorities for a single group, leading to coalition-building efforts —a positive indicator for democratic governance. That said, the arrest of several opposition candidates on corruption charges continued to reverberate in 2022, impeding democratic progress.\n\nArmenia’s security situation, which weighed heavily on the country in 2022, has been affected by several powerful factors: Azerbaijan’s aggression; the weakening of Moscow’s regional pull; the influx of Ukrainian refugees and Russian citizens; and the more active involvement of the United States, France, and the EU. While the security dilemma has impeded institutional reform and democratization, Moscow’s relative marginalization and the growing role of American and European partners have in turn supported Armenia’s democratic trajectory. As military, judicial, and structural reforms continue, the country can still traverse a successful path towards democratic consolidation, though its acute security dilemma and the dangers of democratic backsliding lurk in the woods."
