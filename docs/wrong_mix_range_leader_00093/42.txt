THE EUROPEAN UNION is at heart an economic and trade project built on its foundation as a customs union. The 1980s saw the addition of the single market, the world’s most deeply integrated economic union, followed a decade later by the launch of the single currency. But beyond finance and economics, the EU has traditionally had few pretensions. In 1991 Mark Eyskens, then Belgium’s foreign minister, summed it up as an economic giant, a political dwarf and a military worm.
