Although I dedicate more than half of my working hours to the organization, my source of revenue is, since 2013, from my for-profit consulting company, Tyche-Fortuna Enterprises, LLC.\n\nOn the contrary, especially during the first years of the Royal House of Ghassan, I lent a considerable amount of money to the non-profit due to the immense amount of expenses for the extensive traveling (Middle East, Africa, and Europe) and permanent housing abroad (UAE -2014, Jordan – 2015-16 and Lebanon – 2018) while performing my duties as head of the House.\n\nAccording to the US Federal Code, it’s perfectly legal for an officer of a non-profit organization to receive a salary. Therefore, even if I was, I wouldn’t be doing anything illegal. The only condition imposed by the IRS is that the salary is “reasonable” according to the average paid to non-profit officers.\n\nAccording to the website salary.com, the median salary paid to a CEO of a non-profit organization in Los Angeles is $209,278 a year. Based on that data, it would be perfectly legal and reasonable for me to receive around this amount. Unfortunately, up to this date, the Royal House raises an average of $50,000 a year which is usually not even enough to cover its own overhead. Hence, no salaries are paid to anyone. We are able to realize projects a lot greater than our income due to several factors: our international corps of volunteers, partnerships, and joint ventures. Our sister organizations the Prinz Gharios Stiftung (Prince Gharios Foundation) in Germany, and the One Voice Foundation in Lebanon have independent boards of directors and fundraising. I am part of the board of both foundations but I also do not receive any salary or compensation. Not even expenses. On the contrary, the Royal House of Ghassan pays for the websites of both sister organizations, amongst other expenses.\n\nI am always open to clarifying anything related to the Royal House of Ghassan since our principle is transparency about everything we do.\n\nHIRH Prince Gharios El Chemor of Ghassan Al-Nu’Man VIII\n\nOfficial statement by the Sovereign Prince of Ghassan about Mr. Steven Seagal\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to offer clarifications about my past professional relationship with Mr. Steven Seagal. I was his personal student, representative in South America, and business associate from 1997 until 2002.\n\nIn 2002, due to professional disagreements regarding a plethora of services rendered that were never paid, I decided to join Mr. Julius R. Nasso’s ongoing lawsuit against Mr. Seagal in an attempt to receive the money owed to me. As a result of that decision, I obviously never spoke to Mr. Seagal ever again.\n\nMr. Seagal ended up settling the lawsuit by paying Mr. Nasso an undisclosed amount. Although I never got paid, my claims and documents were never contested.\n\nFirst, I would like to publicly state that, although I stand behind all of my claims and actions, in hindsight, I deeply regret the lawsuit, and everything associated with it. Although I continue to support every single word I have said, I also repent of having given interviews in relation to the alluded lawsuit.\n\nIn March this year, through a common friend, I believed that Mr. Seagal would accept to make amends and I wrote him an apology letter. I never changed my mind about my disrespected professional rights, but to this day, I still treasure the teachings I’ve learned from him and that’s why I wanted to put everything behind us. I got no response. Even respecting and cherishing his teachings, like many people before and after me, I still wish I had never gotten involved with him professionally.\n\nIn the past few days, certain individuals have questioned the fact that I was Mr. Seagal’s personal direct student, claiming having spoken directly with him that would have denied that relationship with me.\n\nTherefore, I would like to present the following documents, letters, and powers of attorney signed by Mr. Seagal during the time we were working together. Please note that in the documents he refers to me as “his student”. These never contested documents are available for public scrutiny being filed at the United States District Court, E.D. New York (“Julius R. Nasso, etc., Plaintiff, v. Steven Seagal et ano., Defendants” Date published: Apr 11, 2003)\n\nSeptember 11th 2023\n\nHIRH Prince Gharios El Chemor of Ghassan Al-Numan VIII (nee. Ahnume Guerios)\n\nUnderstanding the irrefutable official recognition by the Lebanese Government\n\nIn 2019, after three long years of a very bureaucratic process, The Sovereign Imperial and Royal House of Ghassan was officially recognized by the Lebanese Government. Two documents, one the decree signed by the judge from the Ministry of Interior, and one by the Lebanese President and Head of State, the Imperial and Royal House of Ghassan fully recognized with the consent of the Council of Ministers and the permission for an official branch in Lebanon is granted.\n\nThe recognition was not a monocratic decision by the president. To be appraised by the Heads of State, Government, and the Cabinet of Ministers, official reports by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and by the “General Directorate of Security” (intelligence services) were issued.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants (letter number 865/5 of March 6th, 2018)\n\nThe Directorate General of the General Security (letter number 3839 of May 12th, 2017)\n\nThe Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (conclusion)\n\nThe Directorate General of the General Security (Arabic: الامن العام, romanized: al-Amn al-‘Aam; French: La Sûreté Générale) is a Lebanese intelligence agency founded on July 21, 1921 and originally known as the “first bureau”.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Directorate_of_General_Security#:~:text=The%20General%20Security%20Directorate%20(Arabic,as%20the%20%22first%20bureau%22.\n\nMeaning, the equivalent of the CIA, NSA, MI-5, MI-6, Mossad, FSB, etc.\n\nEven if the history of the El Chemor/Gharios family wasn’t very well documented in books and encyclopedias what the Royal House of Ghassan is and stands for is public and notorious! It’s not necessary the use the resources of the Secret Service to find out. Again, it’s seconds away from a Google search. Obviously, before submitting the recognition decree to the Cabinet of Ministers, the Prime Minister, and the President, the Government of the Lebanese Republic was very aware of what the Royal House of Ghassan is and represents. The capital proof is the fact that President Aoun has received and recognized the Equestrian Order of Michael Archangel.\n\nJust analyzing the overwhelming evidence: official documents, governmental official invitations, TV interviews, and newspapers’s articles, etc. it’s elementary to conclude the obvious status of the Royal Family of Ghassan with the Lebanese Government.\n\nA recent Lebanese passport for the late Sheikh Nassif El Chemor (1945-2017) showing his title\n\nGoogle translation of the leading Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar (founded in 1933) article commenting on the Presidential agenda citing the Royal House of Ghassan delegation and addressing Prince Gharios by the title (May 8th, 2017)\n\nThe original article can be accessed here https://www.annahar.com/arabic/article/580869-%D8%B9%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%87%D9%86%D8%A3-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84-%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%88%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A7-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B5%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A\n\nThe Royal Family works in communion with the Lebanese Government having realized several events through the One Voice Foundation. The Foundation is an “arm” of the Royal House of Ghassan, having TIRH Prince Gharios and Prince Sheikh Selim as part of the board. It’s presided by HE Antoine Kalaydjian\n\nAlso in Lebanon and through the One Voice Foundation, the Royal Family works with Caritas, the official charity confederation of the Catholic Church:\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nUnless one is living in a nihilist state of denial, if analyzed with a holistic scope, the degree of recognition of the Royal House of Ghassan is irrefutable and incontestable.\n\nAs always, misinformed and/or ill-intended people want to lessen and despise the unprecedented recognition mentioned in this article criticizing the recognition of the Lebanese Government as “just a recognition as an association”.\n\nEven proving the legitimacy and recognition of the Royal House of Ghassan to exhaustion and being shamelessly discriminated against and attacked in the West for being Arab, the Ghassanid Royal Family is always open to clarifying any possible misunderstandings.\n\nRead also:\n\nClarifications on the Equestrian Order of Saint Sergius\n\nFor dishonest people, the strategy is always to control the narrative and to create “illations”, or malicious inquiries and sophisms. That strategy has the precise scope of avoiding the frontal debate and the confrontation of facts and empirical evidence.\n\nRecently, the Equestrian Order of Saint Sergius was falsely accused of “theft” and impersonating the “Noble Order of Saint Sergius”, headquartered in the Kingdom of Spain and protected by the Habsburg family of Austria-Hungary. (the false accusation was made by a fake profile on social media, NOT by the Noble Order)\n\nBy this allegation alone we can conclude that the intent of the attack was purely to harm the Royal House of Ghassan. And the capital proofs are here. The order’s insignia is completely different and most importantly, it’s not even the same Saint!\n\nThe “Noble Order of Saint Sergius” is named after Pope Saint Sergius I (650-701 CE)\n\nThe “Equestrian Order of Saint Sergius” is named after the martyr Saint Sergius (Serkis) who lived in the IV century and was a high-ranking Roman officer of the army of emperor Galerius (258-311 CE) and the Saint Patron of the Arab Christians and the Ghassanids\n\nYes, for that attack alone we all can see the “intellectual caliber” of the perpetrators, not even checking the basic information.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n\nThe Orders of Chivalry/Merit from the Royal House of Ghassan don’t claim to be the “legatary continuation” of any historical order. However, the Royal House has the historical mandate of being one of the oldest (if not the oldest) Christian chivalric tradition in history. Although not organized in orders “per se” the Ghassanids had a chivalric tradition almost five centuries before the Crusades and the creation of the first known orders of Chivalry: “Thus Ghassanid chivalry developed in the sixth century [AD] and was spiritualized by Christianity, a process that brought it close to the Christian version of chivalry in medieval Europe. (…) The Ghassanids’ commitment to Christian chivalry as one of the ideals that they developed and tried to live up to, especially in their wars, has hitherto been an unknown chapter in the history of this concept.” Prof. Dr. Irfan Shahid, PhD (Princeton University) Professor Emeritus of Georgetown University, Book “Byzantium and the Arabs in the Sixth Century”, pages 304-305 Dumbarton Oaks Research Library (Harvard University)\n\nEven if it was the same saint, no Sovereign House has exclusivity over Saints. They cannot be patented,\n\nOn the other hand, stealing the name, the insignia, and the history of a particular order, claiming to be the legatary continuation of a historical order without having the right, that’s pure theft!\n\nA clear example of theft can be seen here:\n\nAre Orthodox Churches all the same?\n\nFirst and foremost, we have to establish that today, by observing the laws of each country, pretty much anyone can start any religion or church and name it anything that their wild mind can create.\n\nThat would make that religion/church valid as a “religious institution” duly registered with the State.\n\nHowever, the fact that a church is registered as “Catholic” or “Orthodox” does not mean that the particular church is “part of” or “is recognized by” the historical Catholic or Orthodox churches unless they receive what is known as canonical recognition. In the case of the Roman Catholic Church, it has to come from the Supreme Pontiff, the Pope.\n\nAutocephaly\n\nMany dishonest people, automatically chasing megalomaniac titles like “patriarch” or “prince” (without the proper valid accepted steps), name their church “Orthodox” trying to deceive the public by justifying the authenticity of “their” church by the fact that Orthodox churches are “autocephalous” and therefore they don’t need to have any recognition from anyone but the mere registration with the State. That’s pure deception and misrepresentation!\n\n“Autocephaly (/ɔːtəˈsɛfəli/; from Greek: αὐτοκεφαλία, meaning “property of being self-headed”) is the status of a hierarchical Christian church whose head bishop does not report to any higher-ranking bishop. The term is primarily used in Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox churches.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocephaly#cite_note-FOOTNOTEErickson1991-4\n\nUnfortunately, “autocephaly” is not “a license to open an Orthodox church”! The “autocephalous” status has to be officially and formally granted, usually, by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, considered to be “primus inter pares” or “first amongst equals”. Regularly, the grant has to be agreed upon by the other Patriarchs of the historical Orthodox churches.\n\nExcerpt of the 1970 Letter from Ecumenical Patriarch Athenagoras on Autocephaly:\n\n“These include the Churches to which the Holy Apostolic and Patriarchal Ecumenical Throne [the Patriarchate of Constantinople] gave the stamp of autocephaly with the approval of the other Orthodox Churches.\n\nThe Ecumenical Patriarchate could do this because of its attribute as the Mother Church and its status as the “First Among Equals” in reference to the other autocephalous Orthodox Churches, and because it is at the center of the internal unity of the entire Orthodox Church, helping the other Churches in their needs — a duty that derives from its presiding and excelling position within the family of the Orthodox Churches.\n\nAccording to the above, therefore, the final and definitive decision concerning autocephaly belong to a Synod representing more generally the entirety of the local Autocephalous Orthodox Churches, and especially to an Ecumenical Synod. Such decisions cannot be made by each local Autocephalous Church or by a local Synod of a Church from which a Diocese is requesting autocephaly. Such a local Synod has the right only to receive the first petitions for autocephaly and to form an opinion as to whether or not the reasons proffered for autocephaly are justified in accordance with the spirit of the 34th Apostolic Canon.”\n\nhttps://orthodoxhistory.org/2018/09/21/1970-letter-from-ecumenical-patriarch-athenagoras-on-autocephaly/\n\nEach granting of “autocephalous status” is an event of considerable importance and great seriousness. Therefore, it’s considerably easy to find out if a particular church denomination has official status or not. Corroborating the above, recently there was the case of the church of Ukraine.\n\nFive players and one coach from ISAT chosen for the Syrian National Team\n\nWe are very proud of the ISAT girls who made the national Syrian team!

Nobility laws vary from country to country. For example, both husbands of HRH Princess Anne, Princess Royal and the only sister of HM King Charles III, didn’t get any title because the woman cannot pass a title to a husband in the British system,\n\nAs a rule, only in a ruling monarchy, a prince is legally recognized as such by birth. In the case of a deposed dynasty, it all depends on the country he is born. Some countries are friendly to the subject of foreign titles and others, usually republics, are not,\n\nAccording to international jurisprudence, if the particular laws of succession of that dynasty are respected and followed, all princes are legally born princes “de jure, in esse, in pectore et in potentia” (by law/right, in essence, not publicly but in potential) even if the domestic laws of the country of birth are indifferent or absolutely don’t recognize that title. (see legal citations below) If the prince is going to publicly exercise his legal right, it is up to him. It is not an obligation, and many princes choose to never use the titles. But it is their birthright to claim it at any point in their lives. That does not mean they “became princes”, they’re just exercising their rights from that moment on! It is the exact same legal principle of “Jus Sanguinis” (right of blood) applied to citizenship in some countries. For example, Italian citizenship by descent is based on this principle. However, although the children of Italian citizens born abroad are legally considered Italian unless they register their birth certificate with the Italian authorities and apply for an Italian passport, that right was not exercised. It’s not an obligation in any way, the child can keep only the citizenship from the place he or she was born, but action is needed in order for that legal right to be publicly recognized, in this case, the registration of the birth certificate with the Italian authorities. Many examples of princes not recognized by birth can be cited but maybe the most notorious is the current head of the House of Habsburg (Austria-Hungary), HIRH Archduke Karl. His legal name is Karl Habsburg-Lothringen, No title! By Austrian law, he cannot even use the “Von” (of) Habsburg in his name and on his website! But regardless of the lack of domestic recognition, none disputes his title.\n\nTo be a prince, one doesn’t have to be a king’s son?\n\nNo, that only applies to some European ruling monarchies. And even in Europe, that’s not a rule. For example, the Prince of Monaco is the son of another prince, not a king. Even for European deposed monarchies, that doesn’t apply. The heads of the Houses of Austria, Germany, France, Portugal, Yugoslavia, Albania, etc., are all sons of princes, not kings! Even when the country’s tradition is to have a king, while in exile, the custom is not to use the title “king”.\n\nThe Royal Ghassanid titles\n\nBeing respected the traditional laws of succession, according to international jurisprudence, the members of the El Chemor/Gharios family were born Royal Sheikhs and Princes regardless of the domestic recognition of any country. The family members that were born in modern-day Lebanon were able to register their titles because the laws of the Lebanese Republic are friendly to the use of historical titles. However, the family members born in countries like Brazil, where anything related to monarchy was forbidden due to the constitution (1891) that followed the coup-de-etat that overthrew the Brazilian Emperor in 1889, making it impossible to Gharios/El Chemor family members in Brazil to even register their titles legally.\n\n“CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE UNITED STATES OF BRAZIL (February 24, 1891)\n\nSECTION II – bill of rights\n\nArticle 72\n\n§ 2 – All are equal before the law.\n\nThe Republic does not admit birth privileges, ignores nobility forums, and extinguishes existing honorary orders and all their prerogatives and benefits, as well as noble and council titles.” https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/constituicao/constituicao91.htm\n\nCapital evidence of that fact is the sons of the late HRH Prince Sheikh Magid El Chemor born in Lebanon, HIRH Prince Gharios’ cousin. Sheikh Magid had three sons, the late Sheikh Nassif and Sheikh Antoine born in Lebanon, and the late Sheikh Youssef, born in Brazil. Sheikh Magid’s title was on his documents. Same with the two sons born in Lebanon (see passport photo). Nevertheless, Sheikh Youssef’s title could not be registered since he was born before 1988. The same with his sons.\n\nPrince Gharios was born in 1973. His father in 1947. As previously mentioned, article 72 § 2 of the 1891 constitution was only abrogated with the advent of the 1988’s constitution. Since the international succession of titles by “jus sanguinis” operates separately and independently of the domestic constitution of the countries of birth. Therefore, the late Sheikh Youssef, his sons and Prince Gharios were born princes by the international jurisprudence regardless of when they decided to publicly use the titles. See the legal corroboration below\n\nProfessor Emilio Furno, an advocate in the Italian Supreme Court of Appeal, writes as follows “The Legitimacy of Non-National Orders”, Rivista Penale, No.1, January 1961, pp. 46-70:\n\n“The qualities which render a deposed sovereign subject of international law are undeniable and in fact constitute an absolute personal right of which the subject may never divest himself and which needs no ratification or recognition on the part of any other authority whatsoever. A reigning sovereign or head of State may use the term recognition in order to demonstrate the existence of such a right, but the term would be a mere declaration and not a constitutive act.” (Furno, op.cit.) “A notable example of this principle is that of the People’s Republic of China which for a considerable time was not recognized and therefore not admitted to the United Nations, but which nonetheless continued to exercise its functions as a sovereign state through both its internal and external organs.” (Furno, op.cit.)\n\n“. . . Sovereignty is neither created by Recognition nor destroyed by non Recognition.” (The New Encyclopedia Britannica, edition 15, part 3, vol 17, 1981, p. 312)\n\n“These rights are all absolute, and quite independent of any recognition of the external sovereignty by other states….” (Charles St. Julian, The International Status of Fiji, 1872, p. 3)\n\n“. . .Courts agree that sovereignty can exist in the absence of Recognition by any state….” (Werner Levi, Contemporary International Law: a Concise Introduction, 1979, p. 120)\n\n“. . .Sovereignty is not something that is decided by other countries. They can only recognize it or not.” (Frank Muyard, Director, Taipei Office, French Centre for Research on Contemporary China (CEFC), April 1-2, 2005)\n\nHere is an extract from the book “Studies on Nobility Law” (Estudos sobre Direito Nobiliário), by Dr. Mario Silvestre de Meroe, pg. 65:\n\n“It is worth mentioning also that the princely families, with the sovereign attributes, require no recognition by the government of their country of origin, or submit any record in countries where its members settle in residence.
