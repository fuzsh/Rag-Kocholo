        "text": "To: President of the Council, Charles Michel\n\nPresident of the Commission, Ursula Von der Leyen\n\nPresident of the European Parliament, David Sassoli\n\nBrussels, 23 November 2020\n\nDear Excellencies Michel, Von der Leyen and Sassoli,\n\nRe: Call to the EU to urgently engage in peace efforts for the Horn of Africa\n\nThe European Union must immediately appoint senior High-level Envoys for the Horn to engage in and provide support to international, in particular African, efforts to curb the crisis in the Horn of Africa.\n\nThe UN has called for an immediate ceasefire of all hostilities. According to the UN, 4.000 people a day are fleeing to Sudan from Ethiopia. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr Filippo Grandi, has called for a humanitarian corridor to reach the 96.000 refugees and internally displaced persons in refugee camps in Sudan and in Northern Ethiopia. The UN is already preparing to receive 200.000 refugees in Sudan. An old refugee camp, that served during the 1984 famine, is sadly brought in use again. The UN Secretary General, Mr António Guterres, has stated the hope that “Ethiopia will be able to find the peace it needs for its development and the well‑being of its people.”\n\nThis crisis rightly has the full attention of the African continent. The Chairperson of the African Union, Mr Cyril Ramaphosa, has appointed three elder statespersons as envoys: Mr Joaquim Chissano, former President of the Republic of Mozambique; Madame Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, former President of the Republic of Liberia, and Mr Kgalema Motlanthe, former President of the Republic of South Africa – as Special Envoys of the African Union. Their efforts should be supported.\n\nUnfortunately, military interventions are not the only problem in the region. After the lost harvest due to the destruction by locust swarms, food reserves are in severe jeopardy. The conflict is now contributing to an already dire situation. A new famine of most severe proportions is looming. The current crisis comes on top of the Covid-19 pandemic, leaving children out of school for six months already. It affects tens of thousands of children in precarious situations, often separated from parents and guardians.\n\nEthiopia is globally renowned for its world cultural heritage representing one of the oldest human civilisations of which Ethiopians and Africans are rightly proud. The UNESCO world heritage site in Aksum, other heritage sites and religious centres are now under threat. This tragedy is compounded by a terrible loss of civilians, including women and children, sexual violence, mass forced displacement and a refugee crisis.\n\nThis regional crisis in the Horn requires the immediate attention of the EU at the highest level. The EU should call on the experience of statespersons to contribute as High-level Envoys to the efforts of the African Union and the UN.\n\nSignatories\n\nProf. Dr Mirjam van Reisen, Professor International Relations, Innovation and care, Tilburg University, The Netherlands\n\nGreet Vanaerschot, Secretary General, Pax Christi International\n\nAgnes van Ardenne, former Dutch Minister for Development Cooperation and former Dutch Ambassador to the Food and Agri Organisations of the United Nations in Rome\n\nGenoveva Tisheva, Director of the Bulgarian Gender Research Foundation, Bulgaria\n\nMalgorzata Tarasiewicz, Director Network of East-West Women, Poland\n\nJuan Santos Vara, Professor of Public International Law and Jean Monnet, University of Salamanca, Spain\n\nProf. Dr Conny Rijken, Professor of Human Trafficking and Globalization, Tilburg University, The Netherlands\n\nKoos Richelle, former EU Director General European Commission, EU\n\nProf. Dr Rik Van de Walle, Rector of Ghent University, Belgium\n\nProf. Dr Luc Sels, Rector of Katholieke Universiteit (KU) Leuven, Belgium\n\nLilianne Ploumen, MP, former Minister of International Trade and Development Cooperation, The Netherlands\n\nDr Gunnar Köhlin, Associate Professor and Director, Environment for Development Initiative, University of Gothenburg, Sweden\n\nRon Rijnbende, Edukans, The Netherlands\n\nSimon Stocker, LDC-Watch\n\nKlara Smits, Europe External Policy Advisors, Belgium\n\nMaría Luisa Gil Payno, Economistas sin Fronteras, Spain\n\nIonut Sibian, Fundația pentru Dezvoltarea Societății Civile, Romania\n\nAntonella Napoli, journalist, Italy\n\nProf. Dr Jan Nyssen, Department of Geography, UGent, Belgie\n\nDr Jan Nouwen, Coordinator Global Health Education, Erasmus University, The Netherlands\n\nProf. Dr Augusto Montixi, University of Cagliari, Italy\n\nDr Violeta Moreno-Lax, Queen Mary University of London, UK\n\nDr Réginald Moreels, Humanitarian surgeon and former minister for development cooperation Belgium\n\nPaddy Maguinness, Europe External Programme with Africa, Ireland\n\nJens Martens, Global Policy Forum Europe, Germany\n\nStig Lundberg, Consultant Religious Affairs, Sweden\n\nBenoit Lannoo, Consultant International & Interreligious Cooperation, Belgium\n\nJasper Kuipers, Director Dokters van de Wereld, The Netherlands\n\nFlorence Keller, Referente for platforme Citoyenne, Namur and Luxembourg regions, Belgium\n\nMehdi Kassou, Président de la Plate-forme citoyenne de soutien aux Réfugiés, Belgium\n\nSusanna Henriksén, Act Church of Sweden, Sweden\n\nRudi Friedrich, Director of Connection e.V., Germany\n\nWilliam Grech, KOPIN Supporting Refugees in Malta, Malta\n\nValerio Giaccoia, journalist, Italy\n\nPierre Galand, Former Senator, Human Rights activist, Belgium\n\nMark Eyskens, Minister of State, Former Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of International Cooperation, Belgium\n\nAnne Catherine de Neve, Referee Antenne Plate-forme Citoyenne de soutien aux Réfugiés for Brabant Wallon, Belgium\n\nProf. Ronald de Jong, Professor of Practice, Tilburg University, The Netherlands\n\nHalle Jorn Hanssen, Writer and former secretary General Norwegian Peoples Aid, Norway\n\nDr Daria Davitti, Associate Professor, Faculty of Law, Lund University, Sweden\n\nAllan Bussard, Director, Integra Foundation, Slovakia\n\nProf. Dr Frans Bongers, Professor Tropical Forest Ecology, Environmental Sciences Group, Wageningen University & Research, The Netherlands\n\nRoberto Bissio, Social Watch\n\nDr Andrés Bautista-Hernáez, Professor of Public International Law, University of Málaga, Spain\n\nDr Martin Barber, Chair, United Against Inhumanity (UAI), UK\n\nIliana Balabanova, President, Bulgarian Platform European Women’s Lobby, Bulgaria\n\nAfrica ExPress.info, Italy\n\nLaura Albu, President, Romanian Women’s Lobby, Vice-President of the European Women’s Lobby, Romania\n\nProf. Dr Bas Arts, Universiteit van Wageningen, The Netherlands\n\nSara Arapiles, Nottingham University, UK\n\nMatyas Benyik, Attac, Hungary\n\nKees Zevenbergen, Director CORDAID, The Netherlands\n\nIan White, Changing Perspectives, Ireland\n\nProf. Dr Lindsay Whitfield, Chair in Global Studies, Project Coordinator Decent Work and GVC-based Industrialization in Ethiopia, Roskilde University, Denmark\n\nProf. Dr Fulvio Vassallo, Avvocato e Vicepresidente A-DIF, Emeritus University of Palermo, Italy"
