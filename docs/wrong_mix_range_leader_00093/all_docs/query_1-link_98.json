        "text": "It is increasingly likely that, due to the impacts of climate change, entire populations of low-lying States – Tuvalu, Kiribati, the Marshall Islands and the Maldives – will need to relocate to other States&#39; territories. Such en masse relocations would jeopardise these peoples&#39; national identities and manifestations of their ways of life: cultures, languages, customs, and social, political and economic systems. Legal writers analysing this topic focus mainly on maritime boundaries and statehood questions. This thesis examines the right to self-determination. The principal finding is that the peoples of low-lying States are entitled to enjoy self-determination in climate change-related relocation and that there are practical ways this can occur. After explaining the factual scenario and the approach to this research, the analysis has four key components. First, it defines the right to self-determination in context of the low-lying States, including entitlements flowing from......Read more\n\nRelated Papers\n\nThis book focuses on the threat that climate change poses to the long-term survival of Atoll Island States, which we will define as States composed solely or almost exclusively of atolls. Prominent in this group of countries are Kiribati, Tuvalu, Nauru, the Marshall Islands, and the Maldives . All ofthese could become submerged in the future by a combination of increased coral mortality, sealevel rise and coastal erosion resulting from higher levels of tropical cyclone activity. This would represent a significant event in the history of mankind, as although many countries have come and gone, in modern times no State has ever ceased to exist due to submergence by the sea.\n\nDownload\n\nSRPN: Legal & Enforcement Issues (Topic), 2014\n\nThis Article discusses two inter-related issues: the legal implications of climate-induced migration and the phenomenon of ‘disappearing states’ through the lens of four case studies, Kivalina, Inuit, the Maldives, and Tuvalu. As early as 1990, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recognized that the greatest single impact of climate change may be on human migration. With sea level rise, Small Island States face the prospect of losing their territory. The Article discusses the challenges that these two issues pose for international law.\n\nDownload\n\nEuropean Journal of Political Theory, 2017\n\nAnthropogenic climate change is an existential threat to the people of sinking island states. When their territories inevitably disappear, what, if anything, do the world’s remaining territorial states owe them? According to a prominent ‘nationalist’ approach to territorial rights – which distributes such rights according to the patterns of attachment resulting from people’s incorporation of particular territories into their ways of life – the islanders are merely entitled to immigrate, not to reestablish territorial sovereignty. Even GHG-emitting collectives have no reparative duty to cede territory, as the costs of upsetting their territorial attachments are unreasonable to impose, even on wrongdoers. As long as they allow climate refugees to immigrate, receiving countries have done their duty, or so the nationalist argues. In this article, I demonstrate that the nationalist’s alleged distributive equilibrium is unstable. When the islanders lay claim to new territory, responsible collectives have a duty to modify their way of life – gradually downsizing their territorial attachments – such that the islanders, in time, may receive a new suitable territory. Importantly, by deriving this duty from the nationalist’s own moral commitments, I discard the traditional assumption that nationalist premises imply a restrictive view on what we owe climate refugees.\n\nDownload\n\nKMI International Journal of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries\n\nDownload\n\nEthics, Policy and Environment, 2014\n\nGlobal climate change is likely to become a major cause of future migration. Small Island States are particularly vulnerable since territorial destruction caused by sea level rise poses a threat to their entire existence. This raises important issues concerning state sovereignty and self-determination. Is it possible for a state to remain self-determining even if it lacks a stable population residing on a specific territory? It has been suggested that migrants from disappearing Small Island States could continue to exercise sovereign control over their abandoned territory. Such an arrangement would allow them to retain a measure of self-determination. The question posed in this paper is whether this ‘deterritorialized state proposal’ is conceptually plausible and normatively acceptable. It is argued that the proposal is conceptually plausible if we adopt a gradual understanding of ‘self-determination’, but that its normative acceptability is weak even if it is supplemented with compensatory measures.\n\nDownload\n\nEuropean Journal of Political Theory, 2017\n\nAnthropogenic climate change is an existential threat to the people of sinking island states.
