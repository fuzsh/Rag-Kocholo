        "text": "ENGLISH HERE TO STAY, AY: Lots of rumors (or rumours, if you insist) have been circulating about the status of the English language in the EU, mostly initiated by French wishful thinkers. On Monday Danuta Hübner, a Polish MEP who chairs the European Parliament’s constitutional affairs committee, said English would cease to be an official language because each member country gets to choose one and Ireland had specified Gaelic. But the European Commission representation in Ireland quickly shot that down, saying a change to official EU languages requires unanimity from all members. That means the only way to have English dropped from the list would be for the remaining 27 countries to agree. Given that English is one of the official languages in both Ireland and Malta, and much beloved by countries and peoples to the north, east and south of France, we don’t see this happening any time soon. The United Kingdom may be about to crumble, but the sun never sets on the English language empire!\n\nEURO-POLS HEADING TO CLINTON AND TRUMP CONVENTIONS: Thirty members of the European Parliament are heading to the U.S. to take part in the Republican and Democratic National Conventions next month, according an internal Parliament memo. Fourteen MEPs from the European Conservatives and Reformists Group — including leader Syed Kamall and outspoken Brexiteer Daniel Hannan — are heading to Cleveland to be part of the Donald Trump bonanza. The only other EU political faction making the trip to the GOP convention will be the center-right European People’s Party, represented by Secretary-General Antonio López-Istúriz White. Five MEPs from the EPP group, including possible Parliament presidential candidate Mairead McGuinness and veteran MEP Elmar Brok, will go to the Hillary Clinton confab in Philadelphia. Also planning a trip to Philly are four Socialist members, including group leader Gianni Pittella, two MEPs from the Liberals, one Green and two members of the European Parliament secretariat.\n\nJUNCKER’S KANYE MOMENT: Jean-Claude Juncker had a lot to say Tuesday, at Parliament, mingling with journalists, around the summit table, at the podium. Some of it sounded like this Kanye West rant: “I have ideas that can make the human race existence within our 100 years better. Period.” Here are some gems from the Commission president, defending his job:\n\n“Contrary to others, I’m not a slave to financial markets.”\n\n“I’ve never understood Nigel Farage.”\n\n“If the next prime minister is from the Leave camp, it will take seconds to leave.”\n\nWE WANT WHAT HE’S ON: U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman may be the only person left on the planet who still believes TTIP talks can be finished in 2016. He was back at it again Monday, insisting that, yes, it was possible post-Brexit.\n\nOVERHEARD: One group of Americans quipping to another, “We’re here to shut down businesses,” in the Eurostar frequent traveler’s lounge in London.\n\nWHICH MEP? Hosted a “stakeholder session” in the Parliament last week that ran for three hours from 12:30 pm and didn’t include a snack, let alone lunch, for guests. The ones Playbook spoke to were not impressed.\n\nBREXIT PRESS RELEASE OF THE WEEK: “The Plan-Eyskens for a European Saturn Model.” Former prime minister of Belgium, and a professor no less, Mark Eyskens “calls for a new European architecture on the basis of a ‘Saturn model.’” We think he means the U.K. would be like one of Saturn’s rings, and Belgium part of the planet’s core.\n\nSEPARATED AT BIRTH: POLITICO web producer Lawrence Wakefield and Iceand captain Aron Gunnarsson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFREE THE RABBITS: While the rest of Europe was stressing out about Brexit last week, one group kept things in perspective. MEPs Maria Noichl (S&D), Sirpa Pietikäinen (EPP), Eleonora Evi (EFDD) and Bart Staes (Greens/EFA) hosted an exhibition two days before the referendum on rabbit welfare, called “The secret of the cage age: Rabbit farming in the EU.” It was followed by a vegan cocktail reception.\n\nWHO’S UP\n\nNigel Farage: Won the British referendum and succeeded in letting everyone know about it with endless soundbites.\n\nDenis MacShane: The former minister’s book, “Brexit: How Britain Will Leave Europe,” predicted the referendum result.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDonald Tusk: The European Council president was invited to Angela Merkel’s EU confab on Monday as a reward for his new euro-realist approach to the bloc’s future.\n\nWHO’S DOWN\n\nDavid Cameron: Author of his own prime ministerial demise.\n\nJeremy Corbyn: The Labour leader has managed to become even less popular than the EU in Britain.\n\nJean-Claude Juncker: Sidelined and facing questions from some countries about whether he should be replaced.\n\nThis article was updated to clarify the attribution of a quote to Kanye West.\n\nAdvertisement"
