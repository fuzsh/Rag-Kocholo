He established a residence in Jordan to help people from all over the region. His father’s mother’s family was Greek Orthodox and his father’s father, Maronite. When they arrived in southern Brazil, there was no Maronite church in their city, so they started going to a Roman Catholic Church. Raised primarily in an Italian household, Prince Gharios is a proud Roman Catholic.\n\nPrince Gharios has received many formal and informal recognitions from governments and authorities all over the world. In 2014, he received United States Special Congressional Recognition. He also was invested into the Order of the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre, one of the very few papal orders of knighthood, and has been recognized by His Holiness Pope Tawadros II of the Coptic Orthodox Church, several Middle Eastern Christian and Muslim religious leaders, as well as political leaders.\n\nThe House of Ghassan is the oldest Arab dynasty in Christendom and the one that ruled more territory and during the longest period of time. Current well-known Ghassanids in the Church include the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Patriarch Fouad Twal, and the Patriarchal Vicar for Jordan of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, Archbishop Maroun Lahham.\n\n***\n\nZENIT: In Jordan, you discovered your role to essentially become a spokesman of the persecuted Christians. What inspired you and what entitles you to fulfill this mission?\n\nPrince Gharios: First, the urgency of the matter. With the current rate of persecution and migration we don’t have much time, may be 20 years before there will be no Christians anymore in the Middle East. Please remember that these lands are the cradle of Christianity, these are the oldest Churches, and they are dying in front of our eyes. I fully agree with Pope Francis when he criticizes the «globalization of indifference» and teaches an «ecumenism of the blood». Actually, I see in his words a personal appeal. I can’t ignore them, not only because my roots are there, but because my position, currently the only secular office with historical legitimacy and the duty of protecting not only my people but all the Christians.\n\nZENIT: Could you tell us more about the situation of the persecuted Christians and the threats they face?\n\nPrince Gharios: There’s not only the notorious actual persecution, but also economic reasons that make Christians migrate to other countries. Being able to help the Syrian, Palestinian and Iraqi refugees, also with the Lebanese and Egyptian people, to listen to their tragedies and witness their tears gave me a unique first hand understanding of the situation and its urgency. We have to act now. I compare Middle Eastern Christianity with a patient with cardiac arrest, we need to defibrillate with a powerful shock in order to save the patient.\n\nZENIT: What are your plans to help them? Is there some concrete action that can be done? Have you received support from other Christian denominations, any Bishops or Patriarchs of the East?\n\nPrince Gharios: It’s urgent to create one voice for the Middle Eastern Christians. My plan is the creation of a Council based on UN standards and with UN representation, congregating all of the Christian denominations present in the Middle East as an assembly, which would take care of Christian interests in the region, especially providing immediate relief to the Christian refugees, and pleading as an observer organization to the UN. Unifying the Middle Eastern Christian voices and needs without interfering with the sovereignty of each denomination. This organization will also lead and optimize the interfaith dialogue in the region with Muslims and Jews since will represent the ensemble of Oriental Christians. I also believe that this council will improve a lot the ecumenical dialogue since all the denominations will be working a lot closer. It is important that we, the Christians of the Middle East, speak with one voice to be heard. Every Bishop, every Patriarch can only speak for his own flock, for the Christians of his denomination. And there are dozens of Christian Churches and denominations and a dozen Patriarchs; so now politicians know to whom they should speak first without getting involved in an inter-confessional contest. This is something that has to be changed if we want to be efficient, since we can only solve our problems on a large political scale.\n\nAs far as support, I have a great relationship and support from many leaders, especially from the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, The Maronite Church, and the Coptic Orthodox Church. I have great respect and admiration for His Majesty King Abdullah II and for his late father, King Hussein, and a very good relationship with some princes and princesses of the House. They have a real commitment to service to their people. Actually, Jordan is an example not only for the Middle East but for the whole world. There you find real tolerance, respect, and coexistence.\n\nZENIT: You were in Rome twice this May and June to meet with several Cardinals and even Pope Francis. With whom exactly did you meet and what was their reaction to your proposal?\n\nPrince Gharios: My two encounters with the Holy Father were brief. But I’m looking forward to discussing the situation and my proposals in depth with him. I met with Cardinal [Kurt] Koch [President of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity] and Cardinal [Leonardo] Sandri [Prefect of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches.] Both are holy men. Cardinal Koch was very interested in our ideas.\n\nZENIT: What is the next step? What are your plans? What are you asking from people who want to support you?\n\nPrince Gharios: We’re now gathering more support for the Oriental Christian Council. Until my last breath, I’ll keep working worldwide to protect the Christians in the Middle East and also to promote the legacy of the Ghassanids. We need all the possible help and prayers since the task is colossal.

Nonetheless you were born in Brazil in a different era and far from your family’s former homeland. How do you describe your feelings and relationship about the current Lebanon and its people?\n\nIt’s a very interesting situation. Many people confuse me as “prince of Lebanon” which is not accurate. The closest to the “princes of Lebanon” would be my cousins from the Chehab family who ruled Mount Lebanon on behalf of the Ottoman Empire. The first Ghassanid State was in modern-day Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, parts of Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. Lebanon was a country “per se” only in 1946. My direct family left the region in 1914, when the area was still part of the Ottoman Empire. That’s why today in Brazil the Syrian and Lebanese descendants are vulgarly (and inaccurately) known as “Turks”, since they brought a Turk Ottoman passport with them. My family, since the Ottoman’s inception in the area, was always sovereign and independent like, for example, modern-day Monaco and Luxembourg. That being the reason why we were outcasts and persecuted. Back to 1914, due to the persecution, my direct family had to change our surname a century earlier from “El Chemor” to “Gharios” (“Gregory” in Aramaic) which was the first name of the son of the last Christian Ghassanid ruler HRH Sheikh Youssef El Chemor. He swore to “hunt” all of the Ottoman corrupted officials. Well, it was a David and Goliath’s situation which has ended with my ancestor’s deposition and assassination. But even “the great Goliath” fell hard a couple hundred years later when the Ottomans lost the war and their empire. But the Lebanese paid a very painful price since the Ottomans starved to death half of the Lebanese population in addition to the Armenian Genocide. That situation was unbearable for many inhabitants of Mount Lebanon which created a colossal diaspora, especially in Brazil, where today we have almost three times more Lebanese than in Lebanon.\n\nA few weeks ago there was a big explosion in Beirut. What do you think, after this catastrophe how the city and the country can recover? Once Lebanon was called the ‘Switzerland of the East” as a major financial and commercial center. What do you think about the future of the nation? Which would be the best direction for the country?\n\nRegarding my feelings for Lebanon, in addition to my blood, I’ve visited the country several times officially invited by the government and I had the pleasure of living there for eight months. Even with all the problems, there’s no way of not falling in love with the country and the warm and beautiful people. Sadly, the problems in the country have been evolving for decades. Hopefully, after this tragedy, it’ll be time for a new birth in Lebanon. I believe that a complete reform of the whole political and economical establishment is needed. God willing, with the protection and supervision of a well-intentioned foreign country like France.\n\nIf somebody reads your biography easily can think you are a modern polyhistor. You have tried yourself in the film and music industry, studied art, and had a PhD. You have written several books, one of them is a real rarity about dynastic and nobility law. What comes next?\n\nI believe that one of the most important qualities of humanity is our ability to learn. My most precious asset is my mind. Especially since, regarding my body, except for the martial arts, I was never a great sportsman. Right the opposite, I was always the chubby kid bullied in school. I’ve always been terrible in all sports. Even today.\n\nAs you mentioned you are an expert in Eastern martial arts. Even though you are the head of the world’s oldest Christian royal house, Buddhism is really important to you. How do you reconcile them?\n\nI’ve been fascinated by the Asian culture since I was five years old. I’ve started with the Japanese martial arts. My father forced me to start Judo since he was a practitioner. I didn’t like the competition factor and I left after a couple of years. But I got “the bug”. After that, I studied many different martial arts like several styles of karate, Kung fu, Kobudo, kali Silat, Brazilian jiu-jitsu, European fencing, etc. In my early teenage years, I started Aikido, which has opened the doors for all aspects of Japanese culture. I’ve studied religion, language, calligraphy, music, etc. I ended up becoming one of the most influential Aikido masters in Brazil holding high teaching credentials and forming many of the actual masters active today there. I’ve also got karate and Kobudo black belts. With Aikido I’ve discovered the Shinto religion and Zen Buddhism. With that, a couple of years later, I discovered Tibetan Buddhism becoming a student and even a lecturer about it. Buddhism is not a religion “per se” since it doesn’t have dogmas. It doesn’t even have a clear concept of divinity. Buddhism is ultimately how you can train your mind to diminish suffering for yourself and others. Also, how to cultivate compassion. Learning Buddhism has helped me to be a better Christian. Somehow, the philosophical concept of compassion in Christianity is more related to pity and mercy. You should forgive your aggressor, but that implies your superiority. Buddhism teaches you how to understand what has motivated your aggressor to do what he or she has done. Compassion is understanding the other’s sufferings and motivations. It’s easier to forgive when you feel the other person’s pain instead of just accepting the aggression and moving on. Cherenzing, the manifestation of compassion in Tibetan Buddhism has one of many manifestations as a woman with a thousand arms, meaning it should be available to everyone. In each palm of the hand there’s an eye, meaning it’s not just present but aware of the other person’s suffering, being in the person’s shoes, not just having pity. That made it easier to understand and respect other people’s perspectives.\n\nYou are extremely active on the online platforms too. You run a YouTube and Instagram channel, and you have started an online course about monarchy and geopolitics. On the other hand, you are also a member of the Equestrian Order of Michael Archangel which is one of the oldest knighthoods in the world. What’s your opinion about the symbiosis of the modernism and the tradition?\n\nI honestly don’t like social media. I think in the middle of the rare good resources there’s a sea of garbage and misinformation. But social media is a necessary evil today in order to promote one’s work. Regarding the Equestrian Order of Michael Archangel, it doesn’t claim “a legatee Succession” with any historical order of chivalry but with the legacy of some of the oldest Christian knights in history, the Ghassanids. Mainstream historians consider the genesis of Christian chivalry, the first Crusade, and the defense of the holy land. However, it’s documented that my people used to defend the holy land around four centuries before the first Crusade adopting the known ideals of Christian chivalry before any European knights.\n\nIf the previous examples wouldn’t be enough you run several organisations and companies as well. Which are the most important in your life?\n\nWell, the Royal House of Ghassan headquartered in the US is the parent organization to our main branch in Lebanon, to the Prince Gharios Foundation in Düsseldorf, Germany, to the Royal Academy in Bonn, Germany, and to the One Voice Foundation. The royal house is not only my passion but also my duty. As a profession, I’m a corporate consultant with expertise in marketing and PR and an artist. I had classical theater training in Brazil and I started as a theater director in 1993. From that time on I’ve directed, written, and produced a lot of projects. I’ve been a SAG actor since 2010 and recently I’ve released the documentary “The Christian Kings of the Middle East” available on YouTube. I’ve hosted, directed, and produced it. I love the arts so much, I also paint and sing. I think I’ve got that from my mother’s side since my great-grandfather was a maestro in Brazil.\n\nYou have got a lot of awards, for example you are the Goodwill Ambassador of Arkansas, you were elected the Noble Man of the Year in 2014 and awarded by President Trump as well. What do you think how people are thinking about the royals nowadays and particulary in Lebanon?\n\nRegarding the awards, I’m very humbled by the accolades I’ve received in four continents, but my greatest award is to be able to help and inspire, to be relevant. As I always say, a title as a personal honor is absolutely useless in the twenty-first century. It has its historical significance but it dies in itself. The only reason my family and I keep this tradition is because we’re doing our best to be relevant today. Unfortunately, regarding Lebanon, the country is in a terrible situation. And it has been for the last decades. Lebanon is a small country in a very strategic position that has to keep eighteen religious groups in perfect harmony. A country with over a million refugees having four million inhabitants! I sincerely hope that the last tragedy may help to ultimately fix the situation there. There’s no active monarchical movement there but they are used to titles. Many families, like mine, kept them alive.\n\nI saw pictures of you with the crown princes of Albania and Italy. Do you have a close relationship with other royals as well?\n\nI’ve good relationships with ruling and non-ruling royal houses. However, even though we are the oldest Royal house of Christendom and also the oldest Arab dynasty still active, we’re relatively new in foreign relations. Even in Lebanon, although the family’s titles never stop being recognized, we were only recognized as an Imperial and Royal House in 2019, by presidential decree. We’re translating documents and books to English since all the information was in Arabic and classic Arabic until recently. The royal house stayed dormant as a public organization for over three decades, even though some family members actively used the titles, no official activities took place. After the passing of the last sovereign prince in 1971, his son and my cousin HRH Prince Sheikh Selim El Chemor was officially invited by Her Majesty the Queen for the 1996 Royal Ascot and that was it. No further official events or anything. We’re reigniting those contacts now.\n\nAs the legitimate heir of a former country, what are your most important duties as the head of the royal family?\n\nWell, our original territory comprehends today’s Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, part of Iraq, and northern Saudi Arabia. We don’t actively militate any territory because we believe it would just create more confusion to an already troubled region. Also, regarding Jordan, we believe that the Hashemites are doing great work. I’m very fond of His Majesty King Abdullah II and his late father King Hussein. Even Saudi Arabia with its many problems is better than the neighboring republics. I’m really confident in the internal reforms that HRH Prince Mohammad Bin Salman is trying to make modernizing the country. However, we have a duty to the people living in the whole region. So we try to assist them in the best way possible, raising awareness, preserving the culture, bringing relief and education. Royalty is about serving.\n\nAt last, I would like to ask you to tell me what a normal day looks like for you. And how do you as a royal descendent spend an average weekend?\n\nAs I always say even being a prince I still have to pay for Netflix like everybody else. My days are regular. Even with the pandemic, I work a lot from home. The only “princely” activities I’ve are the official events we have and the ones we’re invited to. During my weekends, I really like to hike, play golf, shoot, practice martial arts, paint, and write. I also love to watch films and listen to music. Every day I do meditation and contemplation trying to fix my numerous flaws and to grasp what I can do to better serve my people and make the world a better place.\n\nPhotos: www.princegharios.org\n\nLearn more about the Royal House of Ghassan by watching the video below\n\nInterview: “Gharios the Ghassanid King in the XXI century” by Al-Arab newspaper\n\nThe Al Arab (Arabic: العرب, romanized: The Arabs) newspaper was the first Arabic daily following the independence of Qatar. It was founded in 1972. The following interview was given by HIRH Prince Gharios El Chemor during his visit to the Middle East. The following is an automatic translation. For the original in Arabic, click HERE\n\nThe appearance of the ISIS caliph al-Baghdadi awakens the king of the Ghassanids\n\nThe name of the Ghassanids comes from the Ghassan water spring in Tihama, they migrated from it and settled in the south of the Levant, the Hauran plain, and the south of Lebanon, and with the Byzantine occupation they entered the Byzantine kingdom and with the advent of the Islamic conquest they joined under the banner of the Islamic state after the Battle of Yarmouk.\n\nA long history of the Kingdom, but today Prince Gharios Al-Numan is at the head of the Ghassani royal house as the legitimate heir to the royal family, where he won the recognition of Brazilian and American courts of his right to the throne, and it is known that the Kingdom of Ghassanids traces its roots to the Arabic region, and yet we see that the activity of the heir to the throne is concentrated towards the outside when you ask him what is the reason for this and are there any activities related to the Kingdom within the region Arabic? Is there a future project to return to the roots? “My family had to flee because of the Ottoman persecution in Mount Lebanon and had to settle in South America. As a result, I was born and raised in Brazil. Being born in the diaspora, this gave me an exceptional perspective on historical developments and conflicts in the Middle East. I was free from any non-neutral ideological interferences. When I became president of the Ghassani Royal House, the last thing I could think of was creating another political movement to add to the exhaustion of the scenario in the Middle East at the present time.”\n\nGhassanids in the Americas\n\n80 percent of Ghassanids live in the Americas, and 90 percent do not even speak the Arabic language. But this does not mean that their relationship with the Middle East is over, according to Gharios, “One of the biggest causes of problems in the Middle East is the result of Western interventions. Therefore, almost all of the strategies used so far have been disastrous, even if some are essentially well-intentioned.”\n\nThe heir to the Ghassani throne adds: “Since the beginning of the Ghassanid rule, we have always acted as a bridge between East and West. Therefore, my main goal is to raise Western awareness about the Middle East. I think this is the best way I can help my Arab sisters and brothers, not only those who live in the Arab world but also those who live in the West. The other major problem is sectarianism, so we seek to create a peaceful dialogue to support civilized civil coexistence. As for our activities in the Middle East, we recently opened an office in Dubai and will intensify our activities in the Arab world. “If we aim to build bridges between West and East, we need to work in both regions.”\n\n“Rulers and politicians in the Middle East must recognize that the “old model” discourse that ignorant people are easy to rule is completely dead. In today’s world, if children and young people do not receive their education from a reliable source, they will receive it elsewhere.”\n\nMiddle East and Kingdoms\n\nThere are several kingdoms and sultanates in the Arabic region, and the question is are there channels of communication for the Ghassanids with those kingdoms, and is there some kind of recognition of them, whether officially or informally? “We have legal recognition, and it’s official, of course. The legal decisions it obtained in Brazil, the largest Arab colony outside the Middle East with a population of 15 million people and home to at least 70 percent of the world’s Ghassanids, and another recognition in the United States, which is legal and binding under international conventions such as the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, which have been ratified by 148 countries in the world, including 90 percent of Arabic countries.“\n\nGharios asserts that Ghassanids living in Brazil and the United States, many of them in the Middle East, have ratified this official and legal recognition as well. “This year, we began to engage with governments in the region to offer our cooperation, and what we seek is not only recognition but also being a helpful and relevant agent. There is no point in the Ghassani house if it is not linked to our modern world.”\n\nA Christian Kingdom in the Middle East\n\nIt is known that the Islamic religion is the most widespread in the region and is condemned by the kingdoms and emirates Arabic, and here the fear of a Christian kingdom project among those Islamic countries appears, Gharios is quick to deny this and says: “We do not seek to establish a Christian kingdom in Islamic countries. We don’t even try to be part of political activities but we defend peaceful dialogue and human rights. The Royal House of Ghassan operates as a non-governmental and not-for-profit cultural organization. We preserve the heritage of the Ghassanids, but in a way that is neither political nor religious. We are working to stop the ongoing persecution of Christians in the Middle East, however, I have great respect for Islam and that is why one of my most important activities is to protect Muslims in Christian countries. There are many Ghassanids who have converted to Islam. I am absolutely positive that we will all live together in peace if the West understands the principles and message of peace in Islam.”\n\nThe heir to the throne of the Ghassanid kingdom believes that the constitutional monarchy is the most successful in Arabic countries, but the voice of the people must be heard\n\nGhassanids and the Arab Spring\n\nThe heir to the Ghassanid throne believes that the voice of the people should be heard, but believes that “Western democracy does not suit the East and that there is another form of government that suits the people of the East. This is due to two reasons: first, because Arabic peoples are accustomed to this system, and second because recent history has shown us that monarchies have served their people better than republics. I have great respect for His Majesty King Abdullah II of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. In my opinion, he is one of the greatest leaders of our time and understands his people and the requirements of system development. It invests in education, women’s empowerment, and religious dialogue. These may be the most important needs of the Middle East. King Mohamed VI of Morocco is implementing similar effective measures. I also have great respect for Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan and Sheikh Mohamed bin Rashid Al Maktoum from U.A.E. their vision for the UAE Arabic is exceptional.”\n\nAgainst the Republics\n\nAfter that, Gharios does not insist on the need to change republics into monarchies but believes that democracy is a process that can only be implemented “if the voter is politicized (educated) and this will require a lot of time, a lot of trials and mistakes. This process constitutes almost an act of violence. I believe the solution is education. Rulers and politicians around the world, not just in the Middle East, must realize that the “old paradigm” discourse that ignorant people are easy to rule is completely dead. In today’s world, if children and young people don’t receive their education from a reliable source, they will receive it elsewhere.”\n\nSectarianism\n\nSectarianism is a widespread disease that permeates Arabic societies, especially in Syria and Lebanon, so how does the heir to the Ghassani throne see the sectarian wars taking place in the Arabic region? “Usually, such conflicts do not end in victors, and both sides lose dramatically. I coined a concept called “Newton’s pendulum behavior.” Newton’s pendulum, also known as the “ball pendulum,” is a tool that demonstrates the conservation of momentum and energy through a series of swinging balls. When a ball rises, it creates a continuous counterattack forward and backward. In this way, our mind acts in response to aggressive behaviors. We attack against each other as soon as we are attacked, and so does the other side, and this is an endless process unless someone stops the movement. In the Middle East, this is turning into a deadly circle that spreads throughout the region. This prevents the whole region from prospering.”\n\n“In Brazil, Christians and Muslims, Sunnis, Shiites, Druze, and Jews live side by side in remarkable harmony. A good example of this is 25 March Street in São Paulo, the largest city in Brazil. There, Arabs of all faiths and Jews live and their shops are located side by side. They have certain differences, but whenever something happens in the Middle East, they all take to the streets and march together while holding hands. So, my philosophy is that if it’s possible there, it’s possible everywhere else. The problems in the Middle East are man-made and therefore can be solved by man.”\n\nThe Struggle for Syria\n\nGarrios believes there is a lot of misinformation about what is going on in Syria now, adding: “I was clear in my rhetoric against Western intervention in the battle, and thank God the United States reconsidered the idea of bombing Syria. I prefer the government to be secular and democratic so that all minorities are equally protected. It is my intention to spend time with Syrian refugees in Jordan in the near future to assess their needs and how to provide assistance. With that information, I will get support in the West from governments and private foundations.”\n\nSecret history and possible solutions\n\nThe heir to the Ghassanid throne is preparing to release his new book “The Middle East: Secret History and Possible Solutions” in an attempt to reveal documents and information about the history of the region, with a package of ideas and solutions to the crises the region is going through. “For example, everyone asks me why I’m the head of a royal dynasty that is more than 1,400 years old. People do not know that the Ghassanids actually ruled until the eighteenth century AD. We have had an important role in the history of the Middle East and people usually don’t know anything about us. Therefore, all the information came from prestigious researchers based on conclusive historical and archaeological evidence, not from unknown theories or sources. Based on a study by Professor Eric Cheney of Harvard University, we explore in the book the relationship between the first Ghassanid era and the current absence of democracy in the region. In the book, we also addressed some of the main problems in the Middle East and presented possible strategies to solve these problems.”\n\nWith the climate of the caliphate and waiting for the Mahdi, old concepts that lived in bygone eras reappeared again, and those who claim the throne of Persia, the throne of Petra, Palmyra, and others may appear.\n\nAmmar Al-Mamoun – Syrian writer\n\nLearn more about the Royal House of Ghassan by watching the video below\n\nThe Prince of Ghassan receives honorary citizenship of the imperial city in Brazil\n\nPetrópolis (Portuguese: [peˈtɾɔpolis, -pu-]), also known as The Imperial City, is a municipality in the Southeast Region of Brazil. It is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro, 68 kilometers (42 mi) northeast of Rio de Janeiro. According to the 2010 National Brazilian Census, Petrópolis municipality had 295,917 inhabitants that year, an increase from the 286,537 inhabitants at the previous census. Besides being the largest and most populous city in the Fluminense Mountain Region, the city also has the largest GDP and HDI in the region.\n\nThe town’s name (“City of Peter”) honors Pedro II, the last Emperor of Brazil, who is entombed at the Cathedral of Saint Peter of Alcantara.[3] The city was the summer residence of the Brazilian Emperors and aristocrats in the 19th century, and was the official capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro during the First Brazilian Republic, between 1894 and 1902.[3]\n\nEmperor Pedro II, on March 16, 1843, signed an imperial decree ordering the construction of a settlement (to be formed with the arrival of German immigrants) and the construction of the dreamy summer palace on his outlying lands, the cornerstone of which was settled by the Emperor in May 1845, and that was ready in 1847.[3] Conceived by Major Julius Friedrich Koehler, it is considered to be the second planned city in Brazil (after Recife, designed during the Dutch period), being composed of an urban nucleus – the city (now the center), where the Imperial Palace, Public buildings, commerce, and services.\n\nFrom then on, the city became the de facto capital of the Empire of Brazil during the summer, with the whole court moving. Large numbers of well-to-do inhabitants of the city of Rio de Janeiro also spent the summer in Petrópolis to escape the outbreaks of yellow fever. Emperor Pedro II ruled for 49 years, and remained in Petrópolis for at least forty summers, for up to five months. On 29 September 1857, the town was elevated to the status of a city. Regardless of the time of year, foreign diplomatic representatives lived in Petrópolis for most of the imperial period.\n\nThe cathedral houses the Imperial Mausoleum [pt], which is a small chapel situated to the right of the churchyard of the cathedral. Among the members of the Brazilian Imperial Family buried in the Imperial Mausoleum since its inauguration in 1939 are:\n\nEmperor Pedro II (1825–1891) the last Emperor of Brazil\n\nEmpress Teresa Cristina (1822–1889) wife of the above\n\nIsabel, Princess Imperial of Brazil (1846–1921) Pedro II’s heiress\n\nPrince Gaston, Count of Eu (1842–1922) husband of the above\n\nPedro de Alcântara, Prince of Grão-Pará (1875–1940) Isabel’s oldest son\n\nCountess Elisabeth Dobržensky de Dobrženicz (1875–1951) wife of the above\n\nEven today, several princes from the Imperial family live in Petropolis after coming back from exile.\n\nIn 2016, the Prince of Ghassan was bestowed with the title of “Honorary Citizen of Petropolis” by the initiative of the councilwoman Gilda Beatriz (resolution number 098 of December 12th, 2016). The event was in celebration of the 174th anniversary of the city. Here’s the event’s article (in Portuguese) in one of the oldest newspapers in the whole Rio de Janeiro State, the “Tribuna de Petropolis” founded in 1902.\n\nUnfortunately, the prince was not able to attend the event receiving the document only now. However, he should visit the city on his next trip to Brazil in order to personally thank the councilwoman for such high honor.\n\n“Bay’a” – The oath of allegiance in Royal Arab Succession\n\nBayʿah or Bay’a (Arabic: بَيْعَة, “Pledge of Allegiance“), is an oath of allegiance to a leader. It is known to have been practiced by the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Bayʿah is sometimes taken under a written pact given on behalf of the subjects by leading members of the tribe with the understanding that as long as the leader abides by certain requirements towards his people, they are to maintain their allegiance to him. Bayʿah is one of the foundations of the Middle Eastern monarchy.\n\n“…in relation to the concept of political succession and accession, bayʿa refers to an agreement of a reciprocal nature between a nominated or appointed leader and the community.” Mehran Tamadonfar, The Islamic Polity and Political Leadership: Fundamentalism, Sectarianism, and Pragmatism (Boulder: Westview Press, Inc.,1989), 91\n\nPRE-ISLAMIC ERA\n\nThe concept comes from before the advent of Islam.\n\n“In pre-Islamic Arabia, which lacked the presence of a dominant state, this “pledged covenant under oath” was the principal political institution and ensured a method of protection and collaboration between various tribes.” Professor Andrew Marsham, Professor of Classical Arabic Studies and Middle Eastern Studies, University of Cambridge\n\n“…the bayʿa ritual and pledge can be viewed simultaneously as both a religious and political rite of submission and loyalty. The ritual grew out of a pre-Islamic environment which relied heavily on verbal communication in the forms of oral alliances, ritual, poetry, and oaths. The inevitable contributions of Near Eastern and Roman customs to Arabian practices also augmented pre-Islamic political reality.” Professor Andrew Marsham, Professor of Classical Arabic Studies and Middle Eastern Studies, University of Cambridge\n\nISLAMIC GENESIS AND DYNASTIC SUCCESSION\n\nThe concept of Bay’a was adopted by Prophet Mohammad as a central ritual in Islam. Important to mention that even though Islam is a spiritual practice, there’s no separation between religion and State. Eventually, it became standard political praxis to all the Arab world since then regardless of religion since some Arab peoples became Christian.\n\n“A companion reports that he came to the Prophet and exchanged Bayʿah to become a Muslim; he then enumerated the pre-Islamic customs which he forsook by his conversion. The Prophet responded, “How successful is the transaction you made!” (mā ghabinat ṣafaqatuka). The word used in this tradition is ṣafaqa, which is a purely commercial term for a transaction and, significantly, also means “handclasp.” Professor Ella Landau-Tasseron, Department of Islam and Middle Eastern Studies, Hebrew University of Jerusalem\n\n“In addition to the accounts in the ḥadīth of the use of the bayʿa pledge in establishing and agreeing to the newly dictated tenets of the religion, the Qurʼān itself contains a revelation that also addresses these concerns. Although the word bayaʿa “occurs six times, in four places, in three sura (sūrat Bara’a, or al-Tawba, sūrat al-fath, and sūrat al-Mumtahana, respectively: Q 9:111; Q 48:10, 18; Q 6:12), the Sūrat al-Mumtahaha, or women’s bayʿa, is most closely associated with the pledge of allegiance in secondary sources.” Professor Andrew Marsham, Professor of Classical Arabic Studies and Middle Eastern Studies, University of Cambridge\n\nAs Professor Andrew Marsham writes in Rituals of Islamic Monarchy:\n\n“Whereas the Qur’ān attests to the use of the verb bāyaʽa in the sense of an oath of allegiance to the leader of the umma taken from those seeking to join it and an oath of loyalty in war taken from existing members of the polity, it makes no mention of the third sense in which it is used in the sources for the first decades of Islam: a pledge taken to recognize a new leader of the umma. However, once the idea of leadership of the polity by one man had been accepted, this third use of the term bāyaʽa was a logical consequence of the first: because a pledge of allegiance expressed obligations owed to an individual, that individual’s death ended the covenant, and his successor required a new pledge.”\n\nThe bayʿa should not be viewed as a general election but as the acceptance by the community, or particular people of importance, of a ruler who gained authority through inheritance, usurpation, or nomination. (see S.D. Goitein, Studies in Islamic History and Institutions (Leiden: Brill 1966), 203)\n\nAccording to Professor Shelomo Dov Goitein (University of Pennsylvania and Princeton University), the bestowal of the Bay’a could even legitimize usurpers, therefore, superseding genealogy and eventual rules of succession.\n\n“The use of ritual symbolism as a means of communication in the transfer of power from one leader to the next cannot be overstated; as David Kertzer writes in Ritual, Politics, and Power, “rituals express the continuity of positions of authority in the fact of the comings and goings of their occupants.” In a sense, bayʿa and other rituals of accession can be viewed as methods of communicating power and authority not just to the individual in question, but to the position, in effect imbuing the “office” itself with a sacrosanct nature.” Bayʿa: Succession, Allegiance, And Rituals of Legitimization in the Islamic World”, Lauren A. Caruso, University of Georgia, 2013, p.32\n\nDynastic succession became the standard mode of power transfer in 660 C.E. after the end of the first civil war, with the reign of the Sufyanid Umayyads. The then-governor of Syria, Muʿāwiya b. Abī Sufyān (r.661-80), appointed himself caliph and moved the geographical capital of the Islamic empire to Damascus, beginning the Umayyad dynasty (661-750). (see Patricia Crone, God’s Rule: Government and Islam (New York: Columbia University Press, 2004), 33)\n\nThe English translation of the Maronite Chronicle relates,\n\n“Many Arabs gathered at Jerusalem and made Muʽāwiya king, and he went up and sat on Golgotha; he prayed there, and went to Gethsemane and went down to the tomb of the blessed Mary to pray in it … In July of the same year (660) the emirs and many Arabs gathered and proffered their right hand to Muʽāwiya. Then an order went out that he should be proclaimed king in all the villages and cities of his dominion, and they should make acclamations and invocations to him.” (see James Douglas Howard-Johnston, emeritus fellow of Corpus Christi College, University of Oxford)\n\nOTTOMAN EMPIRE\n\nThe use of the bay’a was also adopted by the Ottoman Empire.\n\nMurphey explains in Exploring Ottoman Sovereignty:\n\n“For a sultan’s role to be fully confirmed, not just swearing of oaths by officials in the divan was required, but also his presence and a visual manifestation among the widest possible group of subjects of all grades and classes. Only some, the viziers and other high-placed court officials, were granted the favour of offering their personal congratulations and subservience in the form of the hand kiss (dest-bus) which required not just visualization, but close approach.” Rhoads Murphy, Exploring Ottoman Sovereignty: Tradition, Image, and Practice in the Ottoman Imperial Household, 1400-1800 (New York: Continuum, 2008), 101-102\n\nMODERN AND CONTEMPORARY MIDDLE EAST\n\nAs a fundamental religious and political practice in the Middle East, the concept has remained current throughout the ages until now.\n\n“The bayʿa has managed to maintain a position of absolute necessity for many governments, and indeed for numerous organizations that exist outside the boundaries of accepted and normative political thought. The use of the bayʿa pledge and ritual are still routinely employed by Middle Eastern governments in the pursuit of legitimacy and public support.” .” Bayʿa: Succession, Allegiance, And Rituals of Legitimization in the Islamic World”, Lauren A. Caruso, University of Georgia, 2013, p.44\n\n“The bayʿa became representative of what Rousseau coined as “civil religion” and for all the varied political groups using the bayʿa ritual the intent is clear; by marrying a ritual grounded in Islamic sacred history with contemporary political ceremonies, political groups, and leaders can fashion a historical narrative which embraces the myth of origin while tending to current needs for legitimacy and stability. The search for legitimacy is constant, and a ritual such as the bayʿa has the backing of established religious and political history, as well as the endorsement of the Prophet Muḥammad himself.” .” Bayʿa: Succession, Allegiance, And Rituals of Legitimization in the Islamic World”, Lauren A. Caruso, University of Georgia, 2013, p.47\n\nWith small adaptations, the concept evolved and was a fundamental principle to the legitimization of power in the contemporary countries of the Middle East, both monarchies and republics.\n\n“The particular political and governmental institution embraced by the newly independent countries was diverse, and often, highly contingent on whatever residual colonial presence remained. However, the newly formed governments collectively faced the problem of how to legitimize rule and ensure not only a stable rise to power but also consistently uncontested transfers of sovereignty. The bayʿa was a pivotal step in this process of legitimization and was adapted to fit modern constraints and technologies. As it was used in the past to secure positions of power in the Umayyad and Ottoman Dynasties, the bayʿa was once more employed to assist in the dynastic succession of newly independent countries, such as Syria, Jordan, and Morocco. “ .” Bayʿa: Succession, Allegiance, And Rituals of Legitimization in the Islamic World”, Lauren A. Caruso, University of Georgia, 2013, p.47-48\n\nMaybe the more evident use of the concept happens in Saudi Arabia due to the vast number of princes competing for succession.\n\n“In order to combat the high number of challenges coming from various branches of feuding families, ‘Abdul Aziz (Al Saud) embraced the already established mechanism of the bay’a to guarantee backing for his own chosen heir apparent.” J.E. Peterson, “The Nature of Succession in the Gulf,” Middle East Journal 55, no. 4 (2001)\n\n“This was the first in a long line of successive hereditary bayʿāt within the al-Saud family, although the chosen heir was not always the first-born son of the previous ruler. This ambiguous mode of succession was actually written into “the Kingdom’s rough equivalent of a constitution,” with the enactment of the Basic Law in 1992, dictating that future kings of the country must not only be the eldest, but also the most fit to rule.111 Article 5 section b of the Saudi Basic law states:\n\n‘Governance shall be limited to the sons of the Founder King ‘Abd al-‘Aziz ibn ‘Abd ar-Rahman al-Faysal Al Sa’ud, and the sons of his sons. Allegiance shall be pledged to the most suitable amongst them to reign on the basis of the Book of God Most High and the Sunnah of His Messenger (PBUH).’ Basic Law of Governance,” Umm al-Qura Royal Order No. 3397 (1992).” Bayʿa: Succession, Allegiance, And Rituals of Legitimization in the Islamic World”, Lauren A. Caruso, University of Georgia, 2013, p.50\n\nThe bayʿa process has been streamlined in Saudi Arabia by the establishment of the Allegiance Committee (al-hayat al-baya), which consists of the sons and grandsons of Abd al-Aziz al-Saud. (see Michael Herb, All in the Family: Absolutism, Revolution, and Democracy in the Middle Eastern Monarchies (Albany: State University of New York, 1999), 36)\n\nMoroccan political culture has also greatly relied on the clout of the bayʿa ritual to justify the rule of the monarchy, and while the bayʿa has played a role in Moroccan dynastic succession rituals since the end of colonial rule, it was more heavily employed during the latter half of Hassan II’s rule (1961-1999) “since the Bayʿa of Layoune in 1979 in Western Sahara, when Sahrawi tribal notables performed this act as a sign of Sahrawi’s attachment to the Moroccan throne.” Although not included in the Moroccan constitution, the bayʿa ritual was mentioned in the Bulletin Officiel in 1979, and “confers divine powers on the King; ‘the holder of the legitimate authority of God’s shadow on earth and his secular arm in the world.’” (see James N. Sater, Morocco: Challenges to Tradition and Modernity (New York: Routledge, 2010), 6-8)\n\nIn the Moroccan government, the bayʿa is associated with a dual function; political succession and accession, and also this yearly renewal of allegiance to the king by the political elite and religious scholars or tajdid al wala. (See Abdeslam Maghraoui, “Political Authority in Crisis: Mohammand’s VI’s Morocco,” The Middle East Report 31 (2001)\n\nGHASSANID DYNASTY\n\nThe Ghassanid Dynasty was (and is) officially Christian, although some Ghassanid princes ruled territories after converting to Islam, like the Rasulid Sultanate (1229-1454 CE) and the Principality of Jabal Shammar (Chemor) (1836-1921 CE). The current internationally recognized heir of the dynasty, HIRH Prince Gharios El Chemor, had his leadership of the Royal House of Ghassan legitimized by the Bay’a from the heads of the El Chemor family in Lebanon.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nAhram, Ariel I. “Iraq and Syria: The Dilemma of Dynasty.” The Middle East Quarterly (2002): 33-42.\n\n“Basic Law of Governance.” Umm al- Qura no. 3397 (1992): 1-13.\n\nBell, Catherine.

Who is right?\n\nWithout a single doubt, from the Arab perspective, the state of Israel is an obstacle to peace in the Middle East And one of the reasons can be understood by one of King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud’s statements, on February 14, 1945, on board the USS Quincy at Great Bitter Lake in the Suez Canal when he was talking to U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The American president, anticipating the creation of the state of Israel, asked for the king’s support and got this direct answer:\n\n“What was done to the Jews is a sin, a calamity. But why create a state for\n\nthem in Palestine? Why not in Germany since the Germans were the\n\nones who perpetrated such crime against the Jews?”\n\nThat reflects the Islamic mindset regarding the creation of the state of Israel.\n\nIn other words, they see it as outsiders stealing land from the Palestinians.\n\nIn Islam, it’s absolutely unacceptable for unbelievers and infidels (all non-Muslims) to take land from the real followers of God. Israel apparently is willing to negotiate if the problem is land. Many politicians have already stated that. Many countries, including the United States, have also recognized the rights of the Palestinian state. So the Palestinians must form their state immediately and fight for their claims as a nation, not merely as a marginalized group of people, as they are now. Regardless of any discussion, they are Arabs who lived in the region for centuries with a great culture to be proud of. They deserve their nation, just as Israel also does.\n\nGolda Meir, a very important Israeli prime minister, said:\n\n“We Jews have a secret weapon in our struggle with the Arabs; we have no\n\nplace to go.”\n\nApparently, people didn’t realize that. She went on to say:\n\n“We can forgive the Arabs for killing our children. We cannot forgive them\n\nfor forcing us to kill their children. We will only have peace with the Arabs\n\nwhen they love their children more than they hate us.”\n\nThe whole Arab world must understand, once and for all, that Israel (right or wrong) won’t simply give up and say, “You know what, you’re right! We shouldn’t be here. Let’s move someplace else!” They are not going anywhere, and they have nuclear weapons. I disagree with some of Israel’s actions against the Palestinian people. I also disagree with some actions by some Palestinian extremists against Israel. They’re both right and wrong at the same time. They’re right because both are entitled to exist and have their own land, regardless of the minutiae of the territorial dispute. They’re wrong when they resort to violence and violations of international law to keep their claims alive.\n\nAgain, the Palestinian people have all of my support to be proud and to live with their heads held high in a nation of their own. However, I believe that Yasser Arafat made a colossal mistake when he decided to buy guns and bombs instead of educating his people. I believe that both Arafat and other leaders made another huge mistake in not accepting a peace treaty with Israel and finally having their nation. They’ve been walking on this road of blood for over fifty years, and what did that accomplish for the Palestinian people? Absolutely nothing.\n\nViolence always favors the stronger. Hence, the belligerent path favors Israel. If you have a problem with someone stronger than you, would it be wise to resolve it in a physical fight? Of course not. So the continuation of this road of blood is harming the Palestinians more than the Israelis.\n\nThe reason is simple. The world sees and treats the Palestinians as nationless, marginal people. If they’d had a nation by now, even if the territory was “less than deserved,” they could have more international weight and legitimacy. They could negotiate their interests from a stronger position.\n\nWhen someone owes you money, what’s better: to take what you can now and try to get the rest on a future date or to go back home with empty pockets? But the bottom line about Israel (and, of course, Palestine) is that if they keep arguing “who’s right” and “who’s wrong,” nothing will change and more people will die and suffer. Both sides have to realize that this is not a rhetorical contest; there are real lives at stake. And it will always hurt the weaker side, the Palestinians, more. They have to be practical.\n\nAs hard as it may sound, both sides must postpone the debate about the past and negotiate a compromise right now: the Palestinians must accept Israel’s existence and negotiate a peaceful future, and the Israelis must recognize the Palestinians’ rights over their territory and find a way to coexist.\n\nThe Palestinian people deserve to live with dignity now, not in one hundred years, and today only peace can make that possible. There’ll be no ideal agreement for either side. The immediate need is to have no more Palestinian mothers crying for their sons and no more Israeli families living in fear. They have to accept that they cannot change the past but certainly they can change the future.\n\nHIRH Prince Gharios El Chemor of Ghassan Al-Numan VIII (part of the book “Middle East – The Secret History“, 2014)\n\nThe personal legal recognition of HIRH Prince Gharios El Chemor\n\nThe Royal House of Ghassan enjoys the exact same legal recognition as The British Order of Saint John (under HM King Charles III) and the Spanish Orders given by HM King Felipe VI, being registered as a non-profit organization domestically with accreditation by the head of State and also the United Nations.\n\nThe history of the El Chemor/Gharios/Guerios family is part of the official Lebanese and Maronite history, and it’s present in books and encyclopedias confirming that the family has ruled two small principalities in today’s Lebanon for around 500 years being the direct descendant of the Ghassanid Kings.\n\nBut what was the recognition of the head of the Royal House HIRH Prince Gharios El Chemor of Ghassan Al-Numan VIII (nee. Ahnume Guerios)?\n\nThis is the scope of this article. The prince had numerous recognitions both formal and informal.\n\nINTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION AWARD No. 0413/2011\n\nIn Brazil, after the advent of Federal Law number 9307 of 1996, all of the Arbitral Awards (decisions) had the same value of a Legal Sentence (Court Verdict), regardless of the approval of any kind of the Legal system:\n\n“Article 18. The arbitrator is a judge in fact and Law, and his decision is not subject to appeal or approval by the judiciary.” http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/L9307.htm\n\n“Article 31. The arbitral award shall produce between the parties and their successors; the same effects of the judgment by the organs of the judiciary and, if condemnatory, shall be enforceable.” http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/L9307.htm\n\nAlso, according to Federal Law, the Award will receive the status of “res judicata” (matter already judged and is not susceptible to any appeal) if no question of the annulment is filed within ninety days after notification of the decree:\n\n“Article 33. The interested party may request the competent organ of the judiciary the decree of nullity of the award, as provided in this Law.\n\n§ 1 The demand for the annulment of the arbitration award will follow the common procedure provided for in the Code of Civil Judicial Procedure, and shall be filed within ninety days after receipt of notification of award or its addendum.” http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/L9307.htm\n\nAlso in 2002, Brazil signed the NY Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 1958. As of January 2023, the convention has 172 state parties, which include 169 of the 193 United Nations member states plus the Cook Islands, the Holy See, and the State of Palestine.\n\n“The Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, also known as the “New York Arbitration Convention” or the “New York Convention,” is one of the key instruments in international arbitration. The New York Convention applies to the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards and the referral by a court to arbitration.” http://www.newyorkconvention.org/\n\nText of the INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION AWARD No. 0413/2011\n\n“This sentence has internationally legal standing based on the New York Convention of 1958, of which Brazil is a signatory, in addition to 141 (one hundred and forty one) other nations.\n\nAfter meticulously analyzing the Legal, Historical, Genealogical and Heraldic documents and evidence presented, it is decided and sentenced that for the purposes of all international laws on the rights of common law and of heraldic laws, that:\n\n1. Even though Brazilian law does not recognize royal and noble titles in its territory, that right of recognition is merely in what concerns the “privilege of birth”, however, International Jurisprudence recognizes such titles, even if only in the honorific context. Consequently, Brazilian legislation considers them as “immaterial foreign inheritance”, which has its protection safeguarded in the law,\n\n2. There is absolutely no Brazilian Law and/or international law which may indicate an “expiration” of rights on honorific titles or even sovereignty “de jure” or pretension to a vacant throne, on the contrary, the denominated “juris sanguinis” successions occur “while there is blood”, except where there is specific legislation to restrict them,\n\n3. Succession in Arab monarchies, in general, do not occur through the primogeniture, but through agnatic rotation, since all the heirs of the last monarchy compete for the succession, unless there was a law restricting it, which was not the case,\n\n4. The Dynasty of Ghassan, despite being Arab, is Christian (not Muslim) and is therefore not subject to Islamic Law, or “Sharia”\n\n5. The claimant, Mr. AHNUME GUERIOS descends, through the direct and continuous masculine line, from the Kings of Ghassan, Byzantine Emperors of the Nikephoros (Phocid) and Macedonia Dynasties and of the Sheiks of Chemor of Mount Lebanon,\n\n6. The claimant has the right to be known as “His Imperial and Royal Highness”, as:\n\n– Official and legal Head of the Imperial and Royal House of Ghassan\n\n– Sovereign Prince of Ghassan\n\n– King of Ghassan “de jure”\n\n– Sheik Chemor of Akoura and Zgharta-Zawiva\n\n– Sovereign Prince in the Roman Sacred Empire of the East(Byzantine)\n\n7. In accordance with international jurisprudence, such rights, “juris sanquinis” were restored “inso iure” with the acts of restoration registered in Brazil and the USA in 2009 and are imprescriptible and inviolable to Mr. AHNUME GUERIOS and his descendants.”\n\nThe United States signed the Convention in 1970 and under American Law; the recognition of foreign arbitral awards is governed by Chapter 2 of the Federal Arbitration Act.\n\nIn Foster v. Neilson, this Court held “Our constitution declares a treaty to be the law of the land. It is, consequently, to be regarded in courts of justice as equivalent to an act of the Legislature, whenever it operates of itself without the aid of any legislative provision.” Foster v. Neilson, 27 U.S. 253, 314 (1829). See also Valentine v. U.S. ex rel. Neidecker, 57 S.Ct. 100, 103 (1936); Medellin v. Dretke, 125 S.Ct. 2088, 2103 (2005); Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon, 126 S.Ct. 2669, 2695 (2006).\n\nThus, over the course of 181 years, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly held that a self-executing treaty is an act of the Legislature (i.e. an act of Congress).\n\nEven with the aforementioned Brazilian Federal Law number 9307 of 1996 clearly stating that there is absolutely no need to subject the Arbitral decision to be sanctioned by the judiciary, the Arbitral Award number 0413/2011 was presented to one Brazilian Chief Judge (Desembargador) and two regular judges in 2013. All the magistrates signed sworn notarized affidavits validating the Arbitral Award and recognizing as lawful all the stated on the sentence as being in harmony with the Brazilian, International, and customary laws.\n\nTEXT OF SWORN LEGAL AFFIDAVIT BY THE CHIEF JUDGE(desembargador) HON. ALEMER FERRAZ MOULIN\n\n“I, ALEMER FERRAZ MOULIN, hereby, Brazilian Citizen, married, judge, social security *** number **with address at ***, Vitória/ES, declare for all the necessary purposes, that I recognize as legally perfect and according to Brazilian laws in force, international law and customary law, the arbitral sentence no.413/2011 issued in Rio de Janeiro on 18 July 2011, by the Court of Arbitral Justice,CNPJ 07.450.175/0001-40 in harmony with the Law 9307/96 of the Federative Republic of Brazil and the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards a.k.a. 1958 NY Convention (June 21, 1958); subsequently recognized and enforced by the Superior Court of Los Angeles on February 24, 2012 by Judge Matthew Saint-George, case number BS135337 in favor of His Imperial and Royal Highness Prince Gharios of Ghassan Al-Nu’man VIII (nee. Ahnume Guérios ) recognizing him as direct descendant and heir in the male and continuous line from the Christian Arab Kings of Ghassan, the Byzantine Emperors of Nikephorus (Phocid) and Macedonian Dynasties and Sheikhs Chemor Sovereigns Akoura and Zghartha-Zawiya legally bearing the following titles: Official and Legal Head of the Imperial and Royal House of Ghassan with the address of “His Imperial and Royal Highness”, Sovereign Prince of Ghassan, “De Jure” King of Ghassan, Sheik Chemor of Akoura and Zghartha-Zawiya and Sovereign Prince of the Roman Empire of the East (Byzantium).”\n\nWHY BRAZIL?\n\nBrazil has the largest Arab colony outside the Middle East with fifteen million people between immigrants and descendants. Definitely, the largest Christian Arab and Ghassanid colony in the world. Just as an example, Brazil has over twice the number of Lebanese than in Lebanon. Also, the vast majority of Islamic countries in the Middle East would be expected clear resistance to a Christian Dynastic claim.\n\nLOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT’S DECREES (CASES) NUMBER BS-135337 & BS-159726\n\nBy the Brazilian Federal Law number 9307 of 1996 (articles 18, 31, and 33) the Arbitration Award number 0413/2011 is considered “res judicata” and no further legal action is necessary as any ratification by other powers of the Judiciary. Also, the Brazilian participation in the 1958 NY Convention made the decision legally enforceable and binding in all of the 172 signatory nations. Even with perfect legal recognition, Prince Gharios submitted the International Verdict, issued in Brazil, to the Los Angeles Superior Court, not once but twice. Recognition and enforcement were sought in a name change petition based on the Brazilian decision invoking the NY Convention. The petitions were granted without reservations by the Hon. Judge Matthew C. St. George on February 24, 2012, and by Hon. Judge Mark Borenstein on the 15th of March 2016.\n\nOne may argue that the law regulating name change is very open in the U.S. However, it all depends on the grounds upon which the request was made. In other words, it is possible to request any name by usage, but once another Court decision is cited as a base for the petition, the granting is considered to be a recognition and enforcement. Hence, there’s a capital difference between a petition granted under common law or the mere adoption of an alias and a petition granted under another legal decision.\n\n“The idea that the common law right extends only to the assumption of a name in addition to one’s legally recognized name enjoys some support in scholarship and in courts. However, the far greater weight of case law and scholarship support a right to change one’s officially recognized name, not merely to assume an alias.” (57 UCLA Law Review 313 (2009) pg. 326)\n\nAlso, according to the Law of name change:\n\n“Courts will deny petitions in which evidence exists that the petitioner desires the name for fraudulent purposes or to interfere with the rights of others.” (57 UCLA Law Review 313 (2009) pg. 313)\n\nBy logic, we can conclude that if the right to be the “Prince of Ghassan” was fraudulent or belonged to someone else, the petition should not be granted.\n\nThere is also a great aversion to any form of name change that holds a title to be awarded:\n\n“Courts similarly exhibit concern for members of the public in cases in which the names requested have the potential to confuse or mislead, even in the absence of nefarious intent. For example, in In re Thompson, the New York Superior Court denied a man’s petition to change his name to Chief Piankhi Akinbaloye.” (57 UCLA Law Review 313 (2009) pg. 313)\n\nAnother known case of a petition denied on the basis of nobility:\n\n“In re Jama, 272 N.Y.S.2d 677 (Civ. Ct. 1966). The petitioner wanted to add “von” before Jama, because his father had told him that von Jama was their family name. Id. at 677. The court also noted that it chose to deny the petition because many Germans with “von” in their name were nobles (though the decision does not say that “von” was, in fact, a title).” (57 UCLA Law Review 313 (2009) pg. 317)\n\nTherefore, the Arbitral Award number 0413/2011 granted to H.I.R.H. Prince Gharios El Chemor of Ghassan recognizing his titles was confirmed by 5 (five) judges and has the weight of an International Court Verdict being valid in all 172 nations that are part of the NY Convention. Of course, the decision relates only to the ownership of the honorific rights to the titles (immaterial inheritance), since as far as the sovereign rights, there’s no court with such jurisdiction today. Also, no court in the world grants any “birthright privileges” since they’re against the majority of the constitutions today.\n\nTo all the above, we can add sworn legal affidavits of major scholars like the world’s leading expert on Arab ruling families, the world’s leading Maronite historian culminating with the world’s largest body of Muslim Leaders, The Global Imams Council, all of them, corroborating the historical and legal aspects of the Royal Ghassanid claim by the El Chemor family and personally by HIRH Prince Gharios El Chemor.\n\nExcerpt of the sworn legal affidavit by Professor Joseph A. Kéchichian, Ph.D, Senior Fellow of the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\n\n“…The direct descendants of the Ghassanid Kings in Lebanon were known as the El Chemor/El Shoummar Shaykhs and they ruled the autonomous/sovereign principality of Al Akoura from 1211 CE until 1633 CE. Critically, the El Chemor/El Shoummar ruled the autonomous/semi-sovereign Shaykhdom of Zgharta-Zawyih from 1641 CE until 1747 CE under treaty with the Ottoman Empire. As the Ghassanids cooperated with the Maronites ever since both communities assisted Heraclius, the chronicles of the family were documented by Maronite historians. facts that were never refuted. Today, those records are considered official Maronite history and, to some extent adopted by leading Lebanese historians.\n\nInterestingly, Chemor/Shoummar family members continued to use their titles even after deposition, a tradition that is still in practice. Moreover, it was also critical to note that the Gharios family hailed from the Chemor/Shoummar, after the latter’s deposition in Zgharta when all the sons of the last ruler were persecuted. Shaykh Gharios El Chemor named his son Shaykh Anton with the surname Gharios instead of El Chemor to protect his sibling from numerous foes.\n\nBy the beginning of the 20th century, some of the Gharios family decided to use the titles and surname El Chemor once again. As there are two categories of Shaykhs in Lebanon–the noble (non-sovereign) Shaykh, who may be the counterpart of baron, count, or duke–and the sovereign/Royal Shaykh-the differences were worthy of attention. The first is mostly honorary but the second is a title bestowed by a semi-sovereign authority under the Ottoman Empire. A sovereign/Royal Shaykh, like the El Chemor/Shoummar/Gharios family, have roots in the tribal system, and are similar to their counterparts in the Arabian Gulf, like the ruling families in Bahrain, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Kuwait, among others. It is this title that is the equivalent of prince and it’s given to the ruler and his sons. Consequently, HRH Prince Gharios El Chemor of Ghassan Al-Nu’man VIII (born Ahnume Guerios) is a direct descendant of the Ghassanid Kings and the Shaykhs El Chemor/Shoummar. He is the sole claimant to the headship of the Royal House of Ghassan with germane claims that are in absolute harmony with Middle Eastern laws of succession and tribal customs. Critically, he has the bay’ah [loyalty oath] from the heads of the El Chemor/Shoummar family members and, as such, a legitimate claim to his crown.”\n\nHIRH Prince Gharios El Chemor interviewed in English by OTV – a well-known Lebanese TV station (2017)\n\nHIRH Prince Gharios El Chemor in 2016 being interviewed in English by LBC (Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation) by the well-known journalist Karen Boustany\n\nGoogle translation of the leading Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar (founded in 1933) article commenting on the Presidential agenda citing the Royal House of Ghassan delegation and addressing Prince Gharios by the title (May 8th, 2017)\n\nThe original article can be accessed here https://www.annahar.com/arabic/article/580869-%D8%B9%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%87%D9%86%D8%A3-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84-%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%88%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A7-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B5%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A\n\nAbove: Official letter from the Albanian head of State recognizing HIRH Prince Gharios El Chemor\n\nAll of the above documentation was corroborated by DNA evidence from three different laboratories.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nUnless one is living in a nihilist state of denial, if analyzed with a holistic scope, the degree of recognition of HIRH Prince Gharios El Chemor is irrefutable and incontestable.\n\nEven proving the legitimacy and recognition of the Royal House of Ghassan to exhaustion and being shamelessly discriminated against and attacked in the West for being Arab, the Ghassanid Royal Family is always open to clarifying any possible misunderstandings.\n\nRead also:\n\nScholarly academic and legal corroborating references to the Royal Ghassanid claims\n\nHere we offer some corroborating references to the Ghassanid family tree and Royal Claims:\n\nThe blood link between the El Chemor/Gharios/Guerios family with the Kings of Ghassan, the Nikephorian Dynasty of the Byzantine Empire, the Sultans of Rasul, the Princely Houses of Al-Akoura, Zgharta-Zeiywe and Jabal Shammar\n\n– Reverend F.

Two documents, one the decree signed by the judge from the Ministry of Interior, and one by the Lebanese President and Head of State, the Imperial and Royal House of Ghassan fully recognized with the consent of the Council of Ministers and the permission for an official branch in Lebanon is granted.\n\nThe recognition was not a monocratic decision by the president. To be appraised by the Heads of State, Government, and the Cabinet of Ministers, official reports by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and by the “General Directorate of Security” (intelligence services) were issued.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Emigrants (letter number 865/5 of March 6th, 2018)\n\nThe Directorate General of the General Security (letter number 3839 of May 12th, 2017)\n\nThe Ministry of Interior and Municipalities (conclusion)\n\nThe Directorate General of the General Security (Arabic: الامن العام, romanized: al-Amn al-‘Aam; French: La Sûreté Générale) is a Lebanese intelligence agency founded on July 21, 1921 and originally known as the “first bureau”.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Directorate_of_General_Security#:~:text=The%20General%20Security%20Directorate%20(Arabic,as%20the%20%22first%20bureau%22.\n\nMeaning, the equivalent of the CIA, NSA, MI-5, MI-6, Mossad, FSB, etc.\n\nEven if the history of the El Chemor/Gharios family wasn’t very well documented in books and encyclopedias what the Royal House of Ghassan is and stands for is public and notorious! It’s not necessary the use the resources of the Secret Service to find out. Again, it’s seconds away from a Google search. Obviously, before submitting the recognition decree to the Cabinet of Ministers, the Prime Minister, and the President, the Government of the Lebanese Republic was very aware of what the Royal House of Ghassan is and represents. The capital proof is the fact that President Aoun has received and recognized the Equestrian Order of Michael Archangel.\n\nJust analyzing the overwhelming evidence: official documents, governmental official invitations, TV interviews, and newspapers’s articles, etc. it’s elementary to conclude the obvious status of the Royal Family of Ghassan with the Lebanese Government.\n\nA recent Lebanese passport for the late Sheikh Nassif El Chemor (1945-2017) showing his title\n\nGoogle translation of the leading Lebanese newspaper An-Nahar (founded in 1933) article commenting on the Presidential agenda citing the Royal House of Ghassan delegation and addressing Prince Gharios by the title (May 8th, 2017)\n\nThe original article can be accessed here https://www.annahar.com/arabic/article/580869-%D8%B9%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%87%D9%86%D8%A3-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%83%D8%B1%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84-%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%88%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A7-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%B5%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%84-%D9%85%D8%B9%D8%A7-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A\n\nThe Royal Family works in communion with the Lebanese Government having realized several events through the One Voice Foundation.
