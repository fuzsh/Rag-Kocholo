        "text": "UNDERGRADUATE PROJECT, FACULTY OF LAW, UNIVERSITY OF NIGERIA, 2016\n\nABSTRACT There is enshrined in various international instruments the right to self-determination of all peoples by which they can freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social, and cultural development. This right as envisaged under the said instruments applied primarily in the context of decolonization - the right of all colonial territories to become independent or to adopt any other status they freely chose, and did not portend the disruption of the unity and territorial integrity of sovereign states. However, with colonialism at its twilight, the right to self-determination faces the acid test of reinventing itself and proving its worth afresh. Foremost amongst the challenges facing self-determination is the question of whether it is capable of regulation by law because unchecked, the concept is one that can justify any claim from separatism to ethnic cleansing. As a matter of fact, self-determination is increasingly being invoked by separatist groups and ethnic minorities in their bid to break away and guarantee certain collective rights respectively. With the advent of this unforeseen dimension arise issues hitherto uncontemplated. These issues will form the pith and substance of this paper. The paper will define the objects of self-determination and analyze its affiliation with similar concepts. The scope and normative content of self-determination will also be considered to show whether it exists as a binding legal right or just as a principle of international law. If it exists as a right it will be shown whether the right is alienable under certain situations or whether it has acquired a peremptory status to which all states can be held to have an interest in. It is also intended in this paper to discuss if self-determination grants a group the right to unilaterally secede and the effect, if so, on state sovereignty. Lastly, the paper will look at past and present issues bordering on self-determination in various regions of the world to show that in self-determination issues law and politics are helplessly and tightly interlaced and as such, the concept is undeserving of a rigid designation as a rule of law.\n\nDownload\n\nThe principle of self-determination remains the most controversial and ambiguous concept in contemporary international law. Self-determination remains a volatile norm under international law that invokes and agitates a desire for self-identity where the ‘self’ seeks to exclude itself from the others. In post Second World War, self-determination played an integral role in the decolonisation process and remains a driving force in the restructuring and redefinition of international community. The right of self-determination of the people received wide acceptance in the international community as a right of the ‘people’ as evidenced by its usage in the UN Charter , General Assembly Resolutions , international and regional instruments and was reaffirmed by the International Court of Justice as an essential principle in contemporary international law. However, despite a range of writings on self-determination, no comprehensive meaning has been accorded to it. The meaning and scope of the concept of self-determination remains uncertain thus necessitating one scholar to aptly put it that ‘self-determination has become all things for all men.” The right of self-determination operates in two aspects; internal and external. Internal self-determination is where the people concerned have a right to freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development within the framework of an existing state without any external interference while in external self-determination; the people concerned freely choose the territory they want to live in. In the 1960s, self-determination played a crucial role in the decolonisation process. Despite self-determination being referred to during the decolonization period the concept was not employed for people to determine their political destiny rather it was more for the attainment of independence of colonial territories. Furthermore, during this period the realisation of the right of self-determination was limited as this right could only operate within the confines of already existing artificial colonial frontiers under the principle of uti possidetis juris. These artificial frontiers, had been arbitrarily drawn for colonial administrative purpose, fitted incompatible people together in ‘alien’ states. In the recent past, the international community has witnessed the rise of claims of the right to self-determination by groups which are a minority in the present state seeking to join a group in the neighbouring state which they believe they share a historical connection. The international community has accorded recognition to some of the group claims for self-determination while not to others. In view of the above, this essay argues that self-determination has always been about title to territories and not about the people. The desire for a ‘self’s territorial integrity seems to prevail over that of democratic participation in the independent state. The essay is in three parts. Part one will briefly discuss the concept of the self-determination of peoples in international law. The part will also discuss who constitutes the ‘people’. Part two will discuss the concept of self-determination and the principle of uti possidetis juris. The essay will argue on this part that the exercise of the right to self-determination of the colonial peoples was territorially limited by the principle of uti possidetis juris which had predetermined the territorial limit of exercising the right. Part three will discuss the practise of the right of self-determination in the Post-Colonial Era before concluding the essay\n\nDownload"
