        "text": "The Blind River Dam controls the water levels for the lower Blind River and Lake Duborne. Located about 300 m upstream of the Blind River outlet into the north channel of Lake Huron, the dam is owned by the Ministry of Northern Development, Mines, Natural Resources and Forestry and operated, along with its adjacent 100 kW hydroelectric generating station, by the Town. Located within the Town of Blind River, the dam is integral to power production, spring flood control, fisheries protection, and recreation in the area.\n\nHistory\n\nThe original Blind River Dam was built more than 100 years ago on private land to operate a sawmill. The first concrete structure was built in 1939 and operated by the Town until 1966 when the Government of Ontario agreed to take ownership.\n\nThe dam was rebuilt in 1974 as a concrete structure with moveable winches on rails. During the construction, a fish slide was replaced with a fifth control gate. Since construction, the dam has seen major renovations with the addition of a generating facility and an overflow gate in the west bay in 1998 and concrete rehabilitation in 1999.\n\nCurrently, the dam consists of three stop-log sluices, one mechanical gate and the two-unit hydro generating facility. The station sends power to municipal buildings located on Martin and Hudson Streets. Water levels are maintained by placement or removal of stop logs, or by adjusting the mechanical gate.\n\nLearn more about the Blind River Dam by viewing our Blind River Water Management Plan.\n\n2015 Blind River Dam leakage\n\nIn 2015 the Ministry sought to address excessive leakage occurring in gates 3, 4 and 5 of the dam. Work was completed from August to September 2015 to seal the leaks and rehabilitate the dam's gates.\n\nView the Ministry's documents presented to Town Council during a presentation on Sept. 8, 2015:\n\nChronology of Blind River Dam Leakage\n\nBlind River Dam Leakage Pictures\n\nBlind River Water Management Plan Study Area\n\nBlind River Average Monthly Flow - August 1-14, 2015\n\nBlind River Average Monthly Flow - August 1-31, 2015\n\nWater level reports\n\nView our recent Blind River Dam water level reports.
