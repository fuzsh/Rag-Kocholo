        "text": "A landlocked mermaid…\n\nLezli Robyn is a mostly-blind Australian author, as well as executive editor and associate publisher of Arc Manor and its three imprints, who lives in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, with her blue-eyed chiweenie, Bindi (which means “little girl” in several indigenous Australian dialects). She’s known for writing bittersweet fiction, being a lover of chocolate and gardening, and is forever drawn by the call of the ocean.\n\nAn award-winning author…\n\nLezli Robyn has been an Aurealis Award finalist for Best Science Fiction Story, a finalist for the Spanish Premio Ignotus Award for Best Foreign Short Story, as well as a finalist for the prestigious Astounding Award for Best New Writer. Lezli has also won the Catalan Premi Ictineu Award twice, after having the pleasure of being published in many countries around the world.\n\nAn accomplished editor and speaker…\n\nLezli Robyn has edited bestselling romance authors Brenda Novak, Anna J. Stewart, Melinda Curtis, and Kayla Perrin—just to name a few!—and legendary science fiction and fantasy authors Katharine Kerr, Harry Turtledove, David Gerrold, Alan Smale, and many more. For five years she was the editor-in-chief of two magazines, and is the executive editor and associate publisher for Arc Manor Publishers and its various imprints. She can often be found attending conventions as a guest speaker or panelist, and she has just begun a writing group on Patreon, The Write Topic, where authors can ask her advice on their works as editor."
