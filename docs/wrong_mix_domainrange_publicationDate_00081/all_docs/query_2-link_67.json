        "text": "BURGETTSTOWN â€• Hip, hip hooray for those sleeper shows. You know: The kind of concert you assume will be pretty good but ends up surpassing expectations.\n\nThird Eye Blind delivered perhaps the sleeper show of the summer Tuesday night at The Pavilion at Star Lake.\n\nLed by Stephan Jenkins, who spoke enthusiastically about fresh motivations and sang as strongly as ever, Third Eye Blind shined brightly on its '90s hits and deeper material.\n\nThe California rockers started wisely with fan fave-but-never-a-radio-single \"Motorcycle Drive By,\" steered by gear-switching dynamics and Jenkins' voice-rising declarative \"I've never been so alive.\"\n\nKryz Reid established early he's an excellent guitarist, conjuring explosiveness on \"Dust Storm.\"\n\nAn icy cool keyboard riff from Colin Creev launched the set's delectable third pick, a spot-on cover of The Cure's \"Just Like Heaven.\"\n\nA crowd of fewer than 7,000, about one-third the Burgettstown venue's capacity, sang without prompting parts of \"Graduate,\" a song that never reached enduring hit status despite being featured in a Seth Green and Jennifer Love Hewitt rom-com.\n\nWith a 40-something median age, though a refreshing number of school-age spectators, too, the audience was first-rate in terms of being knowledgeable, attentive and respectful. Without irony, they heeded Jenkins' request several songs in to exchange pleasantries with a random stranger sitting in front, behind or next to them.\n\nDitching his jacket a half-dozen songs in on a sweltering night, Jenkins, 59, spoke about a strange but wonderful feeling that hit him a night earlier, causing him to reassess what he's doing and thus making the familiar songs he was singing at Star Lake feel like an utterly fresh experience. Yeah, he goes off on tangents like that, but there was a beauty and profoundness to his late-show statement about the fundamental purpose of concerts being \"sharing joy in times of great polarity.\"\n\nFans were unified in their appreciation of Jenkins' powerful singing on \"Wounded\" and \"Shipboard Cook,\" which ended with him alone on stage acoustically strumming, and convincing the crowd to sing along like they were at a pub with a pint glass held high.\n\nJenkins' bandmates returned to the stage and sat shoulder-to-shoulder on furry throw rugs for an acoustic segment that began with \"The Background\" and ended with \"Blinded\" led by the percussion tandem of Jenkins on a hand-held conga and drummer Brad Hargreaves standing at a stripped-down kit bashing away at a swift pace.\n\nJenkins pledged new Third Eye Blind songs soon will be finished, and that the band's next Pittsburgh area show will be in the city, as the Star Lake show hit the homestretch with 1997 hits \"Jumper\" and \"Semi-Charmed Life\" (the decisively non-radio edited version), both ratcheting up the audience's glee.\n\nAn overall fun night, also powered by a solid and entertaining warmup set from pop-punk band Yellowcard.\n\nAs singer Ryan Key mentioned in an interview with The Times, Yellowcard drifted from its normal headlining setlist to focus more on its most alt-rock 1990s-leaning songs that Third Eye Blind fans could appreciate.\n\nKey sang well, and Yellowcard's energy was infectious, especially violinist Sean Mackin's facial gestures interacting joyfully with the crowd (though his instrument should have been turned up more in the mix).\n\nYellowcard saved for last its 2003 era-defining anthem \"Ocean Avenue,\" a pop-punk adrenaline rush and nostalgic blast that had just about everyone in the crowd bopping and smiling.\n\nScott Tady is entertainment editor at The Times and easy to reach at stady@gannett.com."
