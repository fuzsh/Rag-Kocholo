        "text": "The Albion Foundation director Rob Lake says the charity’s Blind Walk from Wembley Stadium to The Hawthorns last week was an “unbelievable experience.”\n\nThe mammoth task saw a group of daring participants raise funds for The Foundation’s disability sports programme whilst raising awareness for the visually impaired.\n\nLake went above and beyond with his efforts, wearing a blindfold for the 120-mile trek in honour of 2024 EFL supporter of the year, “Blind Dave” Heeley - a challenge he’ll cherish for life.\n\n“I’m extremely pleased to have finished it,” said Lake. “It was once of those things where I wanted it to end because it was hard, but I didn’t want it to end because it was an unbelievable experience.\n\n“To complete the challenge was a great feeling. Physically and mentally it was a proper challenge, we underestimated how much we travelled every day.\n\n“The terrain was something we hadn’t really expected. To be walking with your head down, walking through different conditions was a challenge.\n\n“Every so often I was able to take my blindfold off, the other guys didn’t. People really suffered with their feet, and if your feet aren’t right on a 120-mile hike you might struggle.\n\n“The majority of us were struggling. The best thing was the group and how it came together.\n\n“The camaraderie, as challenging as it was, that brought everyone closer together. We’re a varied group and everybody who was on I, from support staff to walkers to volunteers - everyone was equal.\n\n“It was a wonderful thing to be a part of. It was pivotal because of that tribute to Blind Dave, who has done so much throughout the 15 years I’ve been here. I wanted to personally thank him in a way that would challenge myself.\n\n“This will hopefully raise more awareness for what an incredible guy he is. To walk in his footsteps for a short period was something I wanted as many people to do as possible.\n\nThe group, which included Healey, Lake, two-time Albion promotion winner Andy Johnson, some of the Baggies' blind footballers, disability coaches and Foundation staff - arrived at The Hawthorns in time for a rousing reception at half-time of their final SkyBet Championship fixture against Preston North End.\n\n“It was a great reception, the crowd understood that they had to make noise for those who were blind,” Lake recounted. “It was a great feeling to see them get the recognition they deserved.\n\n“They’d been through a lot so to get the plaudits they deserved was amazing. It was important because we wanted to raise funds for the blind team.\n\n“This is so that we can compete at the highest level and provide them with the best coaching and facilities. I wanted to say a massive thank you to everyone.\n\n“Those who contributed financially, who donated, who had a go at the challenges and spreading the word, that’s what it was all about. My final thank you is to the group, to the team, to the backroom team and I’ll never forget the group and that week.”\n\nYou can still donate to the group’s cause HERE."
