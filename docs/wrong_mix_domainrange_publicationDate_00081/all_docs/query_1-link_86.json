        "text": "ON BECOMING JESSICA FLETCHER\n\nI got the call from my agent on a Sunday afternoon last May.\n\n“Don Bain isn’t well,” he said, referring to another client who’d penned all 46 titles in the Murder, She Wrote series. “He’s not going to be able to write the MURDER SHE WROTE books anymore. Would you be interested in taking the series over?”\n\nIt took me all of two seconds to respond. “Absolutely,” I said.\n\nOf course, at that point I had no idea what I was in for because I’d never read a single book in the series, although I was a huge fan of the spectacularly successful television show on which they were based. I’d also never written in first person, much less from the viewpoint of a woman in her 60s. As a thriller author, I’d also never written a mystery, never mind a cozy.\n\nGo figure, right?\n\nBut this isn’t a market to look a gift horse in the mouth. The opportunity was too great to pass up and I proceeded to craft a compelling argument to Don Bain, who I knew and greatly respected as a writer, that I was the right author to replace him, even though I couldn’t be sure at that point I was.\n\nFast forward almost a year . . . My first effort, A Date with Murder, will be published May 1 and response so far has been astoundingly positive. And I just turned in my second book writing as Jessica Fletcher, Manuscript for Murder, which is slated for publication in November. What’s happened in between has been among the best, and most fortuitous, experiences of my entire career.\n\nHow exactly, though, does a long-time, hardcore thriller author transition to softer mysteries with a far lower body count and when the country or even the world are not at stake?\n\nGlad you asked! Fortunately, Don had worked with his grandson Zach, who’d become a crucial collaborator for me, on the first 60 or so pages of A Date with Murder. Enough to give me a notion as to the story and, more importantly, a direct link to Jessica’s voice. Finding that voice myself, in my own head, became the first challenge. But it was one that came to me with surprising ease and in true organic fashion. Getting into Jessica’s head became as simple as channeling Angela Lansbury from the classic TV show. I pictured her behind every page, speaking every line.\n\nMy mother was also a fan of the show and she plays a big part in all this too, thanks to her subscribing to the Mystery Guild, a book club that provided front list titles in special editions. So our bookshelves were full of classic titles by Agatha Christie, Rex Stout, Earl Stanley Gardner, Ed McBain and many more, and in my early teens I devoured more of them than I can count. I can still remember some of those tales and I decided in writing the MURDER, SHE WROTE series that I’d try to recapture the same feeling I got in reading them.\n\nNo easy task, given the fact that Jessica Fletcher is almost without question America’s most famous (amateur) detective. More well-known than Hercule Poirot, Perry Mason and maybe even Sherlock Holmes, never mind the slew of wonderful modern-day sorts from Robert Parker’s Spenser to Sue Grafton’s Kinsey Milhone to Patricia Cornwall’s Kay Scarpetta. That’s a huge challenge for any writer, much less one used to penning only thrillers.\n\nMeanwhile, finding Jessica’s voice might’ve been my first challenge, but the next one was blending it with my own. My style makes great use of hooks, cliff-hangars, and plot twists—often so many of them you have to stop to catch your breath. Almost overnight, A Date with Murder transformed into a hybrid mystery-thriller. A mystery because Jessica is trying to solve the murder of a trusted friend; thriller because she ends up risking her own life to expose a nefarious plot connected to a sinister Internet dating service. I wasn’t going too far out on a limb because Don Bain’s books had often cast her in the role of crusader, solving a murder that hits close to home.\n\nI went into the series knowing that first and foremost I needed to capture the series’ core audience that loves the bucolic setting of Cabot Cove and the regular, established cast of characters Jessica interacts with and plays off of. For the dialogue, I relied on the quick, tart and witty exchanges between Angela Lansbury and the late, great Jerry Orbach as Harry McGraw or Ron Masak as Sheriff Mort Metzger. I wasn’t out to reinvent the wheel, you see, just make it churn a little faster. I’m not sure what was more amazing: How swiftly I took to the process or how naturally Jessica’s words and thoughts started to flow for me.\n\nI wanted to make the series mine, put my stamp on it. But MURDER, SHE WROTE doesn’t belong to me and never will. It belongs to the tens of millions of readers and viewers who’ve come to cherish the stories, watching or reading them over and over again while trying to keep up with Jessica Fletcher. Like all great fictional heroes, she’s timeless, ageless, eternal. After me, someone else no doubt will take the reins of this series. While they’re in my hands, though, I’m grateful for the opportunity enjoy the ride at the same time I give you and all readers the best one I can.\n\nSo is A Date with Murder a cozy, a mystery, a thriller? You know, I’m not sure. I do know that I had a blast writing it and here’s hoping you have a blast reading it.\n\nSince his first book was published in 1983, Jon Land has written twenty-eight novels, seventeen of which have appeared on national bestseller lists. He began writing technothrillers before Tom Clancy put them in vogue, and his strong prose, easy characterization, and commitment to technical accuracy have made him a pillar of the genre.\n\nLand spent his college years at Brown University, where he convinced the faculty to let him attempt writing a thriller as his senior honors thesis. Four years later, his first novel, The Doomsday Spiral, appeared in print. In the last years of the Cold War, he found a place writing chilling portrayals of threats to the United States, and of the men and women who operated undercover and outside the law to maintain U.S. security. His most successful of those novels were the nine starring Blaine McCracken, a rogue CIA agent and former Green Beret with the skills of James Bond but none of the Englishman’s tact.\n\nIn 1998 Land published the first novel in his Ben and Danielle series, comprised of fast-paced thrillers whose heroes, a Detroit cop and an Israeli detective, work together to protect the Holy Land, falling in love in the process. He has written seven of these so far. The most recent, The Last Prophecy, was released in 2004.\n\nRecently, RT Book Reviews gave Jon a special prize for pioneering genre fiction, and his short story “Killing Time” was shortlisted for the 2010 Dagger Award for best short fiction and included in 2010’s The Best American Mystery Stories. Land is currently writing Blood Strong, his fourth novel to feature Texas Ranger Caitlin Strong—a female hero in a genre which, Land has said, has too few of them. The second book in the series, Strong Justice (2010), was named a Top Thriller of the Year by Library Journal and runner-up for Best Novel of the Year by the New England Book Festival. The third, Strong at the Break, will be released this year, and the fourth, Blood Strong, will follow in 2012. His first nonfiction book, Betrayal, written with Robert Fitzpatrick, tells the behind-the-scenes story of a deputy FBI chief attempting to bring down Boston crime lord Whitey Bulger, and will also be released in 2011.\n\nAmazon | Goodreads | Website | Facebook | Twitter\n\nToday we some great book recommendations from Author Ritter Ames.\n\nRitter Ames is the USA Today bestselling author who writes the fast-paced suspense Bodies of Art mystery series and the cozy Organized Mysteries series. She focuses most of her time and writing energies on globe-trotting the world via her keyboard to create memorable characters and fascinating fiction novels for readers.\n\n“You enter a new world every time you open a book.” – Kiersten Fay\n\nOne of the biggest drawbacks of getting a writing contract—and I’m not the only author who’ll tell you this—is that it really cuts back on your reading time. I mean, I started writing to help justify and pay for the cost of my reading habit, and while I love writing, I really miss all the extra reading time I used to have, sitting in my comfy reading chair. Each evening, however, I make sure I allocate time to read, no matter how busy I am or how many deadlines I’m working under—because, truly, no one wants to be around me if I have to go too long without reading a good book. There are some books and authors I simply have no willpower when there’s a new book in the offing. Here are a few I can never wait to read…\n\nI’m an eclectic reader, but since I write mysteries, I tend to read more of that genre than anything else. Right now, I have the ARC of the newest Larissa Reinhart series calling out to me, THE CUPID CAPER, and I’ve already read the first scene and cannot wait to read more. I also have to read the latest Bryant and May title by Christopher Fowler as soon as it’s released—while the next isn’t due out until December, I may have to reread a few of the older titles while I’m waiting. And speaking of new titles waiting, I reread a favorite series each summer and this year was already scheduled for the Amelia Peabody series by Elizabeth Peters (I have all but the first three in hardcover), but when THE PAINTED QUEEN by Joan Hess was release last year I almost caved and reread the series early to prepare for it. However, I was already committed to rereading the Jackson Brodie series by Kate Atkinson—the series starts with the book CASE HISTORIES—and my best-laid plans won out, so now I have my summer plans set and THE PAINTED QUEEN waiting to finally be read about a year after purchase. But before I start my summer reading binge, I’ll be cracking open CHARMED BONES, the spring release by Carolyn Haines in her Sarah Booth Delaney series—one of my absolute favorites.\n\nAvailable April 24, 2018 Pre-order now\n\nSassy, Sexy, Southern Suspense\n\nShe uses her criminal past to catch crooks.

But one amongst them is harbouring thoughts of murder. . .\n\nThe guests also include the young detectives Arthur Bryant and John May – undercover, in disguise and tasked with protecting Monty Hatton-Jones, a whistle-blower turning Queen’s evidence in a massive bribery trial. Luckily, they’ve got a decent chap on the inside who can help them – the one-armed Brigadier, Nigel ‘Fruity’ Metcalf.\n\nThe scene is set for what could be the perfect country house murder mystery, except that this particular get-together is nothing like a Golden Age classic. For the good times are, it seems, coming to an end. The house’s owner – a penniless, dope-smoking aristocrat – is intent on selling the estate (complete with its own hippy encampment) to a secretive millionaire but the weekend has only just started when the millionaire goes missing and murder is on the cards. But army manoeuvres have closed the only access road and without a forensic examiner, Bryant and May can’t solve the case. It’s when a falling gargoyle fells another guest that the two incognito detectives decide to place their future reputations on the line. And in the process discover that in Swinging Britain nothing is quite what it seems…\n\nSo gentle reader, you are cordially invited to a weekend in the country. Expect murder, madness and mayhem in the mansion!\n\nAmazon\n\nAmelia Peabody #20\n\nEgypt, 1912—Amelia Peabody and her dashing archeologist husband, Radcliffe Emerson, are once again in danger as they search for a priceless, stolen bust of legendary Queen Nefertiti and Amelia finds herself the target of assassins in this long-awaited, eagerly anticipated final installment of Elizabeth Peters’ bestselling, beloved mystery series.\n\nArriving in Cairo for another thrilling excavation season, Amelia is relaxing in a well-earned bubble bath in her elegant hotel suite in Cairo, when a man with knife protruding from his back staggers into the bath chamber and utters a single word—”Murder”—before collapsing on the tiled floor, dead. Among the few possessions he carried was a sheet of paper with Amelia’s name and room number, and a curious piece of pasteboard the size of a calling card bearing one word: “Judas.” Most peculiarly, the stranger was wearing a gold-rimmed monocle in his left eye.\n\nIt quickly becomes apparent that someone saved Amelia from a would-be assassin—someone who is keeping a careful eye on the intrepid Englishwoman. Discovering a terse note clearly meant for Emerson—Where were you?”—pushed under their door, there can be only one answer: the brilliant master of disguise, Sethos.\n\nBut neither assassins nor the Genius of Crime will deter Amelia as she and Emerson head to the excavation site at Amarna, where they will witness the discovery of one of the most precious Egyptian artifacts: the iconic Nefertiti bust.

A colleague, a Brit, had been recording occasional classics (perhaps that should be “occasionally recording classics”. As is it seems a bit unclear, like visiting a furniture store or brothel in search of an occasional piece.) The audio publisher, Brilliance, was just moving from public domain work to newly published books. They were looking for an American voice to record some sort of WWII combat novel, and he suggested I grab something in that genre and send them a demo. I did that, on a crappy cassette recorder, recording in a closet. I got the gig, and never looked back. Much as I enjoyed conventional acting, I found this work much more appealing. One of the chief attributes in my reckoning was that I got to play all the parts. I always felt, completely unjustifiably, that’s what I should have been doing anyway. (I am ruefully and somewhat embarrassingly chuckling as I write this) Another great advantage was that the pay was better.\n\n*How long have you been narrating?\n\nThirty some years? Not really sure.\n\n*Was it hard to retire after being so successful?\n\nNot in the least. I’d had a long career, been lucky enough to garner some awards, and made a decent living. We live a fairly modest lifestyle, so I think we’ll be okay without the income. Although there was great fun and reward in meeting the various challenges, doing the best job possible serving some great, even brilliant works, or facing the task of elevating some not so great, I was ready to move on to the different challenges of becoming an artist. In that pursuit I know I will never rise to the level of competence, or garner the awards and recognition I achieved behind the mike, that’s okay. The exhilaration I find painting, the freedom to tackle anything I want in any style I want, is fulfilling. No chance I’ll ever become complacent, little chance I’ll ever rise above the level of enthusiastic amateur, but that’s okay. And luckily I don’t need to make money at it, though there’s a special rush the few times someone wants to buy a piece. I am quite excited at the prospect of dismantling my recording booth and claiming the extra space to make my studio/office a bit larger.\n\n*What are some things you’ll miss the most?\n\nThe people. Authors, directors and other narrators I’ve come to know, many wonderful folks at the various publishers I’ve worked for. Most of those relationships are online for the past dozen or more years because I built my own home studio where I work with my wife Susie Breck (an award winning narrator and director in her own right) and simply upload the work to the east or west coast and points in between. I’ll maintain those.\n\n*Name some things you’ll miss the least.\n\nThe occasional clunkers. Although I jealously guarded right of refusal on works I found objectionable (the biography of Sheriff Joe Arpaio? Not a feckin’ chance boy-o) or revealed themselves as being inferior or not to my taste, some so-so or worse stuff gets through. Having worked with so many truly gifted authors and accomplished pros we are acutely aware of those who fall too short of that level. And poorly edited work. Even the best writers may sometimes have some little problematic thing, typos, a misstated fact etc. The top notch pros were happy to hear from us if we came across something, and quite willing to fix it if the determined we had something that needed fixing, and weren’t just full of shit. Proud to say that didn’t happen often. However a surprising number of works come through with not just typos, spelling errors, but terribly clumsy downright crappy groaners and plotting and pacing sins that jumped off the page. We’d sometimes wonder who the hell, if anybody, edited the work.\n\n*Did you have any favorite characters?\n\nIndeed. Jack Reacher certainly is a favorite, by dint of long association the great skill Lee Child has in creating this dependably interesting and satisfying anti-hero. Lee’s rhythms lend themselves to audio. Stephen White’s Dr. Alan Gregory series featured a supporting character that may have been an all time favorite in Detective Sam Purdy. I’ve done over a thousand books and found great characters to voice in many of them. I did Ed McBain’s 87th Precinct books, thirty or so, the first ensemble police procedurals, that featured a score of characters who showed up regularly, and who we really got to know and cultivate. Voicing some of the classics, Dickens, some of the Russians, gave me the opportunity to do some of the all time greats of literature. And Twain, particularly Huck and Jim. I recorded that, my favorite work in the world, three times for different publishers. I think some are still available. That work was not only great, it was and is important. Never told the publishers, but I’d have done that one for free.\n\nThe Midnight Line\n\nA Jack Reacher Novel\n\nBy: Lee Child\n\nNarrated by: Dick Hill\n\nSeries: Jack Reacher, Book 22\n\nLength: 13 hrs and 6 mins\n\nUnabridged Audiobook\n\nLanguage: English\n\nPublisher: Random House Audio\n\nAudio sample\n\nReacher takes a stroll through a small Wisconsin town and sees a class ring in a pawn shop window: West Point 2005. A tough year to graduate: Iraq, then Afghanistan. The ring is tiny, for a woman, and it has her initials engraved on the inside. Reacher wonders what unlucky circumstance made her give up something she earned over four hard years. He decides to find out. And find the woman. And return her ring. Why not?\n\nSo begins a harrowing journey that takes Reacher through the upper Midwest, from a lowlife bar on the sad side of small town to a dirt-blown crossroads in the middle of nowhere, encountering bikers, cops, crooks, muscle, and a missing persons PI who wears a suit and a tie in the Wyoming wilderness.\n\nThe deeper Reacher digs, and the more he learns, the more dangerous the terrain becomes. Turns out the ring was just a small link in a far darker chain. Powerful forces are guarding a vast criminal enterprise. Some lines should never be crossed. But then, neither should Reacher.\n\n*What was it like working with so many great authors?\n\nGreat. Great authors tend to be great professionals and generous open minded people eager to collaborate when needed, willing to recognize that a narrator can bring something of value to the table, and to trust us at what we do. Some authors try to direct with precise suggestions about how the work should be handled. Those are usually hacks.\n\n*What’s next for you?\n\nPainting. Every day painting. I fall asleep thinking about it, wake up, brew coffee, and get into it. Not always putting paint on the canvas, but staring at the pieces I have going, noting fuckups, determining what to do next, lamenting the limitations of skill and understanding, marveling at the work of others so available online, speaking with artist friends and learning from them, cursing the tremor I’ve had for decades. Sometimes doing something I’m actually pleased with. It’s an all engrossing, exhilarating, marvelous pursuit. I also greatly enjoy working in the kitchen, not a gourmet cook, but a pretty decent one who delights in having good knives and cookware, a decent stove, and ready access to an incredible variety of wonderful mostly organic foods.\n\nA Golden Voice honored by AudioFile Magazine\n\nWinner of 3 Audies and dozens of Earphone Awards\n\nPositive Reviews\n\nNamed Voice of the Century by AudioFile Magazine\n\nDick Hill has had the pleasure of working with authors such as Michael Connelly, Lee Child, Arthur C.

Her debut novel, Beneath the Skin, was published by Avon HarperCollins on 5 October 2017. My Husband’s Lies will be published by Avon HarperCollins on 3 May 2018\n\nHow are things in the UK? Greetings from Ohio!\n\nGreetings from Manchester! Things are great, thank you, though you know that us Brits have to talk about the weather! We’ve had late snow and a lot of rain so far this year. Spring is trying to push through, but it’s still pretty soggy. Still, I can hear the evening birds singing as I type.\n\n*What attributes best characterize your writing style?\n\nThe more I write, the more my conversational style of writing kicks in. I think this comes from writing in a close third person point of view. I hope this helps readers to become intimate with my characters and be able to get under their skin.\n\n*Describe how you came to name your book Beneath the Skin and how it relates to the story.\n\nThis follows on nicely from your previous question! I felt Beneath the Skin was a perfect title on various levels and I was so pleased that the publishers didn’t want to change it. Firstly – for the reason I just mentioned – I wanted to explore what was going on inside the character’s heads – their motivations, their weaknesses, their fears and desires. The veneer of each character was different to how they actually were. For example (without giving spoilers!) Antonia was apparently ‘perfect’ but she felt damaged inside; David’s bonhomie hid a childhood tragedy; Sophie’s nonchalance concealed her real fear of losing her man; Sami’s arrogance and conceit masked the fat spoilt child he once was; Mike’s Irish blarney hid the black dog of depression; Alice’s impatience disguised her loss of identity as a individual rather than just a mum. Other title-related themes were self harming by cutting skin, beauty only being skin deep and the colour of skin/racial identity.\n\n*What’s your process like for writing books?\n\nI mull for a while and have some vague ideas of characters and where I’d like the story to ultimately go. Then I start to write, get beneath the skin (there we go again!) of the characters and let them take me on a journey to the end of the story!\n\n*Do you have a fascination with secrets?\n\nClearly I must have. All my novels have them! However…Everybody has a secret. Yes, you do! A study revealed that the average person keeps thirteen secrets, five of which he or she has never shared with anyone. Go on, count them! They can range from those little things many people do that don’t really feel illegal, such as nicking a five pence plastic bag without paying, or exaggerating expenses at work, to major crimes such as hit and run incidents or even murder. Then there are affairs, betrayals and hidden relationships, with devastating consequences, to easy small lies to cover up mundane events such as covertly looking for another job or concealing the early weeks of a pregnancy. Or perhaps a person’s secret is simple unhappiness. Don’t we all do it sometimes? Put on our bright facade for the Facebook posts and photos to hide the occasional dissatisfaction with our lives?\n\nThen there’s those family secrets which only come out when great Auntie Ethel has too much sherry at Christmas. You know, when you spurt out your bucks fizz in surprise – your Grandad was a bigamist; your dad and mum married when she was five months pregnant with your older sister, your cousin’s on the game…\n\n*In your new book, My Husband’s Lies, who are Nick & Lisa?\n\nKnown as the A Team at school, Nick, Dan, Will and Jen have been close friends for years. Although Nick has an older brother, he found it difficult to break free from his parents until he met Lisa, a no-nonsense nurse. The story opens at Nick and Lisa’s wedding, a happy day which is thrown into chaos when a guest is spotted on the reception hotel window ledge, ready to jump.\n\n*How do you create characters? Are they based off of real people?\n\nI’m a bit like Frankenstein, I build my characters from scraps of people I know, people I read about and listen to, things I watch on the TV or read in newspapers, mixed with a huge dollop of imagination. They’re certainly not based on one real person, so if anyone out there thinks a character is them – no they are not!\n\n*What’s the core dilemma in this book?\n\nMaking choices! Seminal events occur at Nick and Lisa’s wedding which causes their lives to dramatically change and secrets unravel. By the end of the story Jen, Nick, Will and Dan have to make touch choices. Though they are now in their early thirties, I see this as a coming of age drama in many ways – finally growing up.\n\n*The title My Husband’s Lies says a lot. Can you say a bit more about this?\n\nThe title is generic – it doesn’t apply to one character! It’s a ‘domestic noir’ story, a compelling tale of friendship and love, secrets, betrayal and lies with an LGBT element. When the A Team gather for Nick’s and Lisa’s wedding, their ordinary lives are thrown into chaos. As the unstoppable chain of events ensues, untruths, family secrets, illicit love and perfidy are unravelled, pushing their relationships with their partners to the limit.\n\n*Do you think you’ll ever write a legal thriller?\n\nI have! I have written two books called Time is of the Essence and Truth is a Complete Defence which I would love to see published! The sardonic protagonist is lawyer called Natalie Bach who returns to her old law firm after a five year absence and a broken heart. Practising her self-styled feminism, she faces personal and legal conundrums. With the help of her old law college pal Gavin Savage, she eventually unravels complex cases and crimes!\n\nFacebook | Twitter | Amazon | Goodreads\n\nAmazon | Goodreads\n\nRelease date May 17, 2018 Pre-order now\n\nA Search Engine for Writers\n\nBy Elizabeth S. Craig\n\nWhen you’re just starting out as a writer, it can be hard to figure out how to improve at your craft. There are an overwhelming number of writing reference books out there. There are courses to take. I tried both of those things, but never really felt as if I was getting the information I needed. That’s when I started combing through writing blogs for craft tips.\n\nBefore subscribing to writing blogs, I’d discovered that Google wasn’t helpful for delivering writing-related links. For example, a search on POV would return results for a show on American public broadcasting.\n\nIn frustration, I decided to build my own set of reliable resources to help me improve my craft. In a way, I started collecting writing blogs. I’d find a good one and then frequently found that those blogs linked to other blogs in their sidebars…so I’d hop over to see if those blogs were helpful. Finding these blogs and subscribing to them became a fun rabbit-hole of information.\n\nI read a lot of blog posts and found tons of useful information on the writing craft, on promotion, and on the industry itself. That’s when I decided it might be helpful if I shared the posts as I found them. I figured that not only would it create some good karma for me, but it might also help to build my social media presence on Twitter at the same time.\n\nSince 2009, I’ve been finding writing and publishing-related articles that serve as resources for writers. I use an RSS feed reader and subscribe to over 1,000 writing blogs. Every day, I scroll through the reader, looking for the best posts to share on Twitter.\n\nThe only problem was that everything on Twitter seemed really ephemeral. The tweets were useful, and they were being shared. But the tweets weren’t the static resource that I wanted to create. I decided to share each week’s links as a roundup on Sundays on my blog. That helped (especially since not everyone is on Twitter). But there wasn’t really an effective way of searching for specific content.\n\nIn 2010, software engineer Mike Fleming was reading my blog and read on one of my posts: “I’m sure there’s got to be a better way to do this, but I can’t think of it.” He emailed me his idea: a search engine for the writing links. It could be searchable by topic and writers could find a list of resources for any writing-related questions they might have.\n\nIn January 2011, a special search engine for writers debuted, developed by Mike. Called the Writer’s Knowledge Base, or WKB, it’s a free resource for writers in conjunction with novel organizer Hiveword. You can search by topic or by category (e.g., business, creativity, promo). You can also sign up to have these posts delivered to you via email (customizable by frequency and category). More information about email delivery in Mike Fleming’s post here.\n\nI love that I have a hand in sharing all of the amazing information for writers out there. There are now nearly 45,000 articles in the WKB. If you ever find you need help with the writing craft, figuring out how to start your own writer website, or even researching a blog post, I hope you’ll check into this free resource.\n\nElizabeth is the bestselling cozy mystery author of the Southern Quilting mysteries, Memphis Barbeque mysteries, and Myrtle Clover Cozy Mysteries for Penguin Random House, Midnight Ink, and independently.\n\nWebsite | Twitter | Facebook | Amazon | Goodreads\n\nSeries by Elizabeth S.
