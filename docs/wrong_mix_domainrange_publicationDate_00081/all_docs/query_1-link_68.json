        "text": "Tag: Fiction\n\n11 Questions with Russell Brooks, author of Jam Run!\n\nSynopsis:\n\nWhat if crying out for help made you a target?\n\nWithin hours of arriving in Montego Bay, Eddie Barrow and his friend Corey Stephenson witness a gruesome murder outside a bar. When the victim’s sister reaches out for help, they learn of machinations to conceal foreign corporate corruption and a series of horrific sex crimes. However, Barrow and Stephenson’s commitment to solving the case is put to the test once they find themselves in the crosshairs of a ruthless criminal network—one that extends beyond the shores of Jamaica.\n\n11 Questions with Russell Brooks.\n\nHow did you do research for your book?\n\nI read several news articles to research the subject matter of Jam Run—especially the character and situation that were inspired by the murder of Dwayne Jones. He was a trans teenager who attended a dance party outside Montego Bay dressed as a woman. I read about other events that also inspired the story’s plot.\n\nFurther research involved consulting with experts, including locals in Jamaica, gun and martial arts experts, a Jamaican lawyer, a psychologist, and even an inventor who appeared on the TV show Shark Tank.\n\nYour book is set in Montego Bay and its surrounding areas. Have you ever been there?\n\nYes. I visited Montego Bay in January 2023 and spent two weeks visiting the locations in Jam Run.\n\nWhich was the hardest character to write? The easiest?\n\nChevelle was the most challenging character to write. She’s a high-functioning autistic person who was raped when she was twelve and had a son. My knowledge of autism was limited before I created the character, so it was essential to consult with Nordia Sweeney—a Jamaican specializing in teaching intellectually disabled students—to make Chevelle realistic. Since Chevelle was also a rape victim, I had to approach that content very carefully to avoid offending readers who are either rape survivors or who know or work with them.\n\nThe protagonists, Eddie Barrow and Corey Stephenson were the easiest characters to write because I already wrote about them in Chill Run, the first book in the series. As an author, I learn more about the characters I write about as I progress with a manuscript.\n\nHow are you similar to or different from your lead character?\n\nThe only similarities between Eddie Barrow and myself are that we’re both authors born and raised in Montreal and whose parents are from Barbados.\n\nIn your book you make a reference to the murder of Dwayne Jones…how did you come up with this idea? What made you write a book about…Dwayne?\n\nI read about Dwayne Jones’s murder while working on The Demeter Code. I was disturbed to read he was killed for dressing up as a woman while attending a straight party. What was worst was the way he was killed. The poor guy was stabbed, shot, and run over by a vehicle. That’s beyond hatred. It’s pure evil. And it says a lot about the killer(s). What also bothered me was the fact there were over 300 people at the party, yet nobody claimed to have seen anything—even though the incident began in the parking lot. The details of the murder were so disturbing I couldn’t ignore or forget. Full disclosure, Chill Run was initially written as a standalone. However, Dwayne Jones’s murder inspired me to write a sequel that deals with hatred, crimes, and injustices against the LGBTQ+ community because, in my opinion, these issues aren’t addressed in the Caribbean community often enough. Fortunately, some countries in the Caribbean have abolished laws that discriminate against the LGBTQ+ community. Others still keep these laws active, which I believe is unfortunate.\n\nThere are many crime thriller books out there about rape and hate crimes. What makes yours different?\n\nWhat makes Jam Run different from other novels in the genre is that 98% of the characters are Afro-Caribbean and inspired by events that mostly took place in Jamaica. What’s also unique is that Eddie Barrow is a young Black man of Barbadian descent born in Montreal, Quebec. We usually see crime-solving characters who are white and who are either detectives or former military. Sometimes we see Black characters who are tough and intimidating. Luther—played by Idris Elba—comes to mind.\n\nEddie is the opposite. He’s not a detective. He’s an author with no fighting skills, nor does he fit the tough guy image we’re used to. He’s the guy next door and one of the least intimidating people you can imagine.\n\nBut most importantly, we often read about stories of the genre with Caribbean settings. Still, the Caribbean culture is absent because they aren’t written by authors who are either West Indian or of West Indian descent. I wrote and researched Jam Run in a way that would not stereotype Jamaica or the Caribbean. This is why having the Jamaican characters speak as the average Jamaican living in Jamaica would speak—whether in Patois, broken English or English with local expressions was important. For instance, there’s a scene where Eddie, Corey, and a secondary character are trying to escape a burning house. Their acquaintance tells them they can exit through the washroom. Eddie’s puzzled until Corey yells that their acquaintance was referring to the laundry room.\n\nWhat is your next project?\n\nMy next project will be the fourth Ridley Fox/Nita Parris thriller.\n\nWhat is the last great book you’ve read?\n\nDie Trying by Lee Child.\n\nWhat were the biggest rewards and challenges with writing your book?\n\nOne of the challenges for me was raising funds to publish and market Jam Run. The story and subject required weeks of research due to the sensitivity of the content. While working on my first book, I read that the average person won’t be my only audience. There will be industry professionals such as police officers, martial artists, lawyers, and doctors who’ll read my books. But in this instance, I knew that I had to be extra careful so as not to offend rape survivors or those who know or have worked with these victims to be sure that the wrong message is not interpreted by either a sentence of dialogue or the way I describe a scene. The biggest reward as of today was that for the first time, I visited Jamaica and went to the locations that took place in the story. I also had a chance to experience Jamaica, meet the locals, and have one of the best times of my life.\n\nWhich authors inspired you to write?\n\nJohn Grisham, Vince Flynn, and Joseph Finder.\n\nIf there is one thing you want readers to remember about you, what would it be?\n\nI want them to remember me as the author that kept them up late at night that they woke up late for work.\n\nYou can purchase Jam Run at Amazon.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRussell Brooks is an Amazon bestselling author of several thrillers—Pandora’s Succession, Unsavory Delicacies, Chill Run, and The Demeter Code.

She sees through Mike’s star\n\npersona to who he really is—a kind guy from the Southeast Side of Chicago who has never\n\nforgotten his humble blue-collar roots. The lives of the star-crossed, seemingly mismatched\n\ncouple collide during a whirlwind romance that culminates in a tragic series of events.\n\nThe Walk-On is a timeless tale of love and loss that explores the consequences of personal\n\ndecisions and the rewards of faith, redemption, and hope.\n\n7 Questions with Richard Podkowski\n\nWhat advice would you give budding writers?\n\nI learned from experience that just because you have a story swirling in your head, you shouldn’t jump in and start writing. First and foremost, plan out your story and research your genre. In my case, writing a fiction novel was way more complicated than I expected. The process may have been less stressful if I’d had a basic understanding of elements like protagonist, plot, foreshadowing, conflict, and which, if any, fiction sub-genre the story in my head would ultimately be — before I started typing. Writing until I was “done” wasn’t a sound strategy either. Secondly, since word count is critical…refer to number one….plan out your story. An outline would have been helpful, especially to plot out important reveals from my protagonist’s past. I would have avoided problematic repetition by doing so. Especially since I wrote the first draft in fits and starts over eleven years!\n\nDo you have another profession besides writing?\n\nI am a retired career US Secret Service special agent. My assignments, both criminal investigations and protection, and duty stations took me not only around the country, but around the world. My experiences, the people I met and places I visited have inspired my writing. After retiring, I continued to do strategic security and risk management consulting for clients in the private sector. However, after forty years of protecting people and property, I’m eager to pursue my creative interests more. In addition to writing, I began taking acting lessons about ten years ago and have been lucky to book minor roles in TV, film, commercials, along with print work. I keep auditioning because I never know when I might get a big break, as evidenced by finally getting published after many years of querying literary agents resulted in dead ends and disappointment.\n\nWhere do you write?\n\nI have a home office with a desk and computer. I rarely use a legal pad and pen to make notes anymore, instead organizing my thoughts with computer note-taking options. I try to eliminate potential distractions and have made it a point to not keep my cell phone nearby. Although I am inspired by everyday life and social interaction, I need solitude to sort and synthesize my ideas. Sometimes to stay focused, I work in a library where the atmosphere of concentration and quiet enhances my productivity.\n\nDo you snack while writing?\n\nNot usually. I do keep a beverage nearby. Usually hot tea which I drink pretty much year-round. If I need a snack or break for a meal, I get up and walk away to the kitchen or another room to eat and recharge. Plus, I hate getting crumbs or something sloppy on the keyboard or desk.\n\nIf you could go back in time, where would you go?\n\nI’m a baby boomer, born in the late 50s. I have this vision of a post-WWII idyllic life when America was getting back to living again after the atrocities of war. Large-scale projects such as the building of the US interstate system allowed for easier travel between states and the connection of big cities and the new suburban communities springing up as weary soldiers returned and started families. Cultural changes were afoot in music with the advent of rock n’ roll, automobile and clothing styles, movies, TV, and architecture. Good things were happening and I think it would be exciting to experience them as a young adult!\n\nWhat is the most courageous thing you’ve ever done?\n\nAs a Secret Service agent protecting US Presidents around the world, often under challenging circumstances, I carried a lot of responsibility. It’s a unique law enforcement mission. You never want anything to happen on your watch!\n\nWhat is your theme song?\n\nI’ve often been told I don’t take instruction well. It’s cliché, but I identify with Frank Sinatra’s popular song, “My Way!” I usually follow my instincts and my heart even though the path may be unconventional. At least until my wife changes my mind.\n\nYou may purchase The Walk-On at Amazon.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRichard Podkowski, a native of Chicago’s South Side, began writing fiction while studying criminal justice at Loyola University Chicago.\n\nAs a United States Secret Service special agent, Richard protected U.S. presidents and foreign dignitaries and investigated major domestic and international financial crimes until he retired in 2003.\n\nRichard’s projects include a Christmas romantic comedy screenplay and a crime story, both\n\ncurrently in the works.

The author asserts his moral and legal rights over this work.\n\nThe Walk-On a true Chicago story.\n\nThe Walk-On a true Chicago Story\n\nGuest Post\n\nby Author\n\nRichard Podkowski\n\nIn The Walk-On, Mike “the Steelman” Stalowski is a blue-collar kid who grew up in the shadows of the Chicago steel mills, where hard-working immigrants poured molten steel 24/7 while smokestacks belched black smoke until they were shuttered in the mid-70s. The word steel in Polish is “stal” which is the root of the Steelman’s surname. Technically, my interpretation means he’s made of steel.\n\nChicago, one of the most diverse cities in the world, has many nicknames including Chi-town, City of Big Shoulders, Windy City, Second City, and oddly for most, the Third Coast. Although if you’ve ever been on the lakefront, you understand.\n\nMany people have heard of the South, North and West Sides. No East Side as you’d be in Lake Michigan. The city has over 200 distinct neighborhoods. You’ll find the Steelman in Hegewisch, Lincoln Park, Little Italy, Wrigleyville and the Gold Coast. The long-standing North Side / South Side rivalry is real. One of my characters from the South Side mocks a friend from the North Side for not venturing farther south than Roosevelt Road. Technically, the dividing line is Madison Street. Ironically, both live in the western suburbs, which is another rivalry.\n\nThe South Side is known for being more blue-collar, and it definitely has some of the city’s most poverty-stricken neighborhoods. Conversely, the white-collar North Side includes the bustling downtown area, with its well-known skyscrapers, lakefront recreation and residential high-rises, mansions, upscale eateries and shopping options, and numerous cultural destinations.\n\nI am proud to have grown up on the South Side. We were certainly blue-collar, poor actually, and I lived in a tiny cottage bungalow. Like Stalowski, my parents were Polish immigrants who came to Chicago seeking a better life. My dad toiled in the South Side stockyards until he became a printer. My mother worked on a Westinghouse Corporation factory assembly line, alongside other Polish and Hispanic women. She didn’t speak good English, and she didn’t speak bad Spanish. They got along just fine.\n\nI didn’t visit downtown until I was in 1st or 2nd grade and never dreamed I would one day attend Loyola University on the North Side lakefront. In all fairness, I confess that after becoming empty-nesters, my wife and I lived in East Lakeview and loved it. We walked everywhere: grocery store, gym, church, Wrigley Field, live theater, restaurants, Lincoln Park and even to the glitzy Magnificent Mile on North Michigan Avenue. Can’t do that in the towns of area codes 708, 630, or 847.\n\nThe baseball rivalry is real too. The Cubs are the North Side heroes. The White Sox are their South Side rivals. Fortunately, the whole city roots for the Bulls, Blackhawks and Chicago Bears. In The Walk-On, the city cheers for the fictional NFL Chicago Storm. As the book begins, Mike “the Steelman” Stalowski, notorious hometown hero hailing from the South Side, has been a fan favorite for years.\n\nI hope you’ll enjoy Mike’s escapades around Chicago — my beloved hometown.\n\nYou may purchase The Walk-On at Amazon.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nRichard Podkowski, a native of Chicago’s South Side, began writing fiction while studying criminal justice at Loyola University Chicago.\n\nAs a United States Secret Service special agent, Richard protected U.S. presidents and foreign dignitaries and investigated major domestic and international financial crimes until he retired in 2003.\n\nRichard’s projects include a Christmas romantic comedy screenplay and a crime story, both\n\ncurrently in the works.

As Esperanza must continue through the forest she’s become lost in she meets 12 fairies who teach her lessons each of us could take to heart fora better us and a better world.\n\nFirst, the art in the book is beautiful. Not in an overly artistic manner but one that should appeal to a younger reader but also give a bit of nostalgia to an adult that might be reading the story to a child. I got the feel of watching certain shows with my own son, when he was little. (Not so little any longer.)\n\nThe chosen fairies, each with a certain quality for a better person are appropriate and the fairies are inclusive of all types and parts of society we don’t normally see in the vast majority of children’s books.\n\nThe rhyming scheme of the text is fun but also educational. Larger words are used at times but once one gets the first word, then they can easily figure out the second rhyme.\n\nI give Hope and Fortune a 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nYou may find Hope and Fortune by Marissa Bañez at just about every online outlet including:\n\nAbout the Author\n\nA first-generation immigrant to the U.S. from the Philippines, Marissa Bañez is a graduate of Princeton University and a lawyer licensed to practice in New York, California and New Jersey. She has published legal articles for the prestigious New York Law Journal and the American Bar Association, but her true passion for writing lies in her children’s stories. She currently lives in New York City with her husband and daughter. Her childhood was filled with many original stories and puppet shows made up entirely by her mom. In her free time, Marissa likes to travel, design and make clothes, cook, binge-watch Star Trek shows and Korean dramas, and occasionally strum a guitar.\n\nShe is currently working on her second book, Hues and Harmony (How the Singing Rainbow Butterfly Got Her\n\nColors), a story about mixed or multiracial children, self-discovery, and respect for others as told through the\n\nlife and adventures of a caterpillar.

The police focus on her as their primary suspect, so she decides to launch her own investigation into the dead man and his accomplices. But when the killer sends her clear messages that she and her loved ones are on his radar, she knows it’s just a\n\nmatter of time before someone ends up dead.\n\n11 Questions with Wendy Koenig\n\nWhere do you get inspiration for your stories?\n\nMost people have great stories in their pasts. I borrow ideas from those and mix them up a bit. Also, the news fills in the blanks pretty well.\n\nThere are many mystery books out there. What makes yours different?\n\nMy main character is a kick-ass woman with no special education or training. She just doesn’t stop.\n\nHow did you do research for your book?\n\nI grew up about an hour from St. Louis, so I just took a trip home. Kicked around the city a bit to let the feel of it flow through me.\n\nIf your book were made into a movie, who would star in the leading roles?\n\nI think Karen Gillan would make a great Sylvia. She’s funny, uber smart, and tough as nails.\n\nWhat were the biggest rewards and challenges with writing your book?\n\nThis book was completely different when I first wrote it. When I finished, I just didn’t like it, so I started cutting, rearranging and adding. Love the final edition. It took about a year longer than I like, though.\n\nWhat advice would you give budding writers?\n\nDon’t stop. Don’t even take a long break. Momentum is hard to pick up again. Write what your heart tells you, but make sure you finish what you start.\n\nWhat genre do you write and why?\n\nMystery and some science fiction. I love mysteries, but I grew up on SF.\n\nWhich authors inspired you to write?\n\nLee Child, Robert A Heinlein, Anne McCaffrey, Michael Connelly, Vonda McIntyre, Brandon Sanderson, Kathy Reichs.\n\nWhat’s the most courageous thing you’ve ever done?\n\nI joined the US Air Force right out of high school.\n\nWho was your childhood celebrity crush?\n\nNeil Diamond. What a voice!!!\n\nWhat is your next project?\n\nI’m rewriting the next book in the series and scribbling occasional paragraphs for the third. I also have a science fiction book on the go.\n\nYou may purchase On The Sly: A Sylvia Wilson Mystery at Amazon.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nWendy Koenig is a published author living in New Brunswick, Canada. Her first piece to be printed was a short children’s fiction, Jet’s Stormy Adventure, serialized in The Illinois Horse Network. She attended University of Iowa, honing her craft in their famed summer workshops and writing programs.

The author asserts his moral and legal rights over this work.\n\n17 Questions with Cousin Vinny Agnello author of Satan’s Glove.\n\nIn 1991 Eddie Romano, an undersized, unconfident kid, finds an antique baseball glove while on a treasure hunt of the ruins of the old Comiskey Park in Chicago.\n\nInstantly that glove becomes his obsession. While sleeping at night he’s transported to a dreary, decrepit ballpark where he learns the game of baseball from Billy, a skillful young ballplayer, who seems to be under the control of a dark, sinister figure who calls himself, “The Manager.”\n\nMiraculously, Eddie becomes a better ballplayer and is rewarded for anti-social behavior by having his skills improve. As his bad attitude causes him to lose more and more friends on his team, he starts receiving phone calls from legendary baseball players Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig who attempt to steer his behavior in the complete opposite direction.\n\nUnbeknownst to Eddie, two factions of “angels” are waging a war for his soul. What is the price of glory? Eddie will soon find out.\n\nWhat makes your book different from others in this genre?\n\nIf receiving a message from a godly being from another dimension doesn’t interest you (when you’re not insane and have no drug or alcohol problems) then you’re probably dead or might as well be.\n\nHow did you come up with this idea for your book?\n\nThe most incredible night of my life was spent watching a “mental movie” of this great tale. Although I did not drink, smoke, use drugs, or have any kind of mental illness, I received a telepathic message from a visitor in my room. This visitor shouldn’t have existed according to the laws of physics but I can attest that he was there and he informed me that I had a job to do and I better pay attention to all the details since it was a message for the world. The “mental movie” he presented to me was the most fascinating, heartwarming adventure that I would ever be part of. When this movie ended my heart was pounding and my forehead was sweating and I screamed out, “It’s beautiful! It’s perfect!” I knew if I went to sleep (what I planned to do), I would blow the greatest opportunity of my life because I would certainly forget the details. So, instead I stayed up and jotted down every detail that I could remember of this wondrous story and I am so glad I did, and so will you be, when you read it.\n\nHow did you do research for your book?\n\nSince it is a period piece I had to look up the style of uniform worn by the dream coach “BILLY GREEN”. In order to do this, I had to find a famous ballplayer from that era for the Chicago White Sox and observe the uniform he wore to incorporate it into the novel. Also, I had to research the Chicago White Sox minor league system before 1952 and to my amazement their triple A team played in Hollywood, California. They were called the Stars and were owned by William Frawley from the “I LOVE LUCY SHOW”. For BILLY GREEN to play on that team really made my work easy.\n\nWhich was the hardest character to write? The easiest?\n\nObviously, the BILLY GREEN character was the most difficult character to write for because he was so dated. The EDDIE ROMANO character (the kid who finds Billy’s cursed glove) was the easiest because I knew very well that time period.\n\nIf you could put yourself as a character in your book, who would you be?\n\nI’ve been BILLY GREEN (the dream coach in the novel) who’s been 90 feet from reaching his goal. I’ve been on third base most of my life but I just can’t seem to score that winning run. It’s the most frustrating thing ever, to be so close to reaching your goal but so far away. I’m BILLY GREEN as a writer and just like him, at this juncture I’d probably make a deal with the devil to get to the Major leagues of book writing as he made a deal with the devil to play in the Major leagues of baseball.\n\nIn your book you state ____. Why is that?\n\nThat there’s hope. There’s always hope! I believe as long as you have breath in your lungs, you can change the road you’re on. I have. SATAN’S GLOVE is one of the great “anti-suicide” books you’ll ever read. If you want to end it all after reading SATAN’S GLOVE then you must’ve missed the message.\n\nWhat advice would you give budding writers?\n\nDon’t pursue it unless you totally believe in what you’re selling. If I was selling a murder mystery, detective novel, or something run of the mill, you wouldn’t be seeing my work being promoted. This book is my “Mona Lisa”, I will never write a more original or fascinating novel and I’ve lived a fascinating life. The late great BEN BOVA (science fiction writer with over 130 published novels and 6 HUGO AWARDS for best editor in the world) told me after signing a literary agreement with me, that SATAN’S GLOVE was the most fascinating novel he’d read in years. Maybe that’s why I believe in this novel.\n\nHow long have you been writing?\n\nSince 1987. I used to write screenplays but was pushed to write a novel by people in the industry because many books become movies. You’ll notice that my work reads like a movie and that’s because I went to the best acting school in the country, “THE LEE STRASBERG THEATER INSTITUTE, NYC”. Everything is visual to me. And yes, I’ve appeared in some movies and soap operas (Nothing to write home over). I really began writing my novel seriously in 1991 until 1993 and then I decided to finally finish something as I’ve dedicated my spare time to writing from 2011 to the present.\n\nWhat is a favorite compliment you have received on your writing?\n\nWhen the late great BEN BOVA at 84 years old, decided to sign me to a literary agreement and promote my book. I was the last writer Mr. BOVA signed (It had been 10 years since BEN BOVA had signed a writer). I was honored to say the least and for him to tell me that “SATAN’S GLOVE” was the most fascinating novel he’d read in years really put me on cloud 9!\n\nHow are you similar to or different from your lead character?\n\nSince EDDIE ROMANO is the lead character and is a victim of evil beings, I’m really not much like him except for his humanity and his realization that following the “golden rule” was his best bet. I try to walk the high ground in life. I’ve been blessed and even if SATAN’S GLOVE does not become a New York Times Bestseller as BEN BOVA predicted, I’ll live with it. The general public is finicky and if somehow they miss this exceptional book, then I’ll accept it. As the old adage goes, “You can lead the horse to water but you can’t make him drink.”\n\nWhat is one piece of advice you would give to an aspiring author?\n\nFind something interesting to write about and make sure you know what you’re writing about.\n\nWhich authors inspired you to write?\n\nMy father, Louis A Agnello Sr. had his own column in the Chemical Engineering News. He wanted to write the great American novel but he ran out of time here and I wrote SATAN’S GLOVE for him.\n\nDo you write every day?\n\nBEN BOVA said I should but life tries its best to steal you away from what you should be doing.\n\nWhat is your writing schedule?\n\nWhenever my editor Carolyn Rae emails me her take on my chapters.\n\nIn today’s tech savvy world, most writers use a computer or laptop. Have you ever written parts of your book on paper?\n\nSure. Back in 1991-1993. It was a major problem scanning those pages into the present computer format.\n\nWhat is something that made you laugh recently?\n\nMy wife does impersonations and speaks for the pets we own. She’s really good at creating voices and has unfortunately missed her calling.\n\nWhat is your next project?\n\nThe rewrite of the sequel. I need it to read like SATAN’S GLOVE.\n\nAmazon link: https://amzn.to/3Xa19FS\n\nAbout the Author\n\nLOUIS ANTHONY AGNELLO Wherever controversy is found it’s likely you’ll find “Cousin Vinny” in the thick of it.\n\nOn the evening of August 22, 2008, Mr. Agnello was accosted by two gunmen and shot twice in the leg in Sleepy Hollow, New York. The motive for that shooting was never determined. As of this date, no one has been arrested.\n\nAgnello recovered from the shooting and currently resides in Monticello, Georgia. This is the final evolution of a story that he received in a dream-like state back in 1991. “Cousin Vinny” believes that his colorful past gives him greater insight into the plights of the people we meet in our daily lives.

Then, she meets 12 Fortune Fairies. Among them is the Fortune Fairy of Beauty, who talks about the beautiful butterfly that flew away and comforts Esperanza by saying: “Beauty is not what you see with your eyes but with your heart.” The other Fortune Fairies likewise give Esperanza words to live by to discover her true path.\n\nHope and Fortune is a children’s book with positive and frank messages about empowerment and self-discovery, designed to stay with a child well beyond childhood.\n\nThe 10 Questions\n\n1. What would be your one sentence elevator pitch of what your book is about?\n\nHope and Fortune is a beautifully illustrated children’s book featuring\n\nmulticultural, multiracial, multigender and multigenerational fairies of various shapes\n\nand sizes who give practical life advice to a lost little girl and get her on the right path.\n\n2. What book/author/movie/tv show/song might a potential reader compare your\n\nbook to in order to get an idea of its feel and why ?\n\nThe honest answer is I don’t know. I didn’t take inspiration for my book from any\n\nother book, author, movie or song . . . at least not consciously.\n\nPlus, my book is a relatively short children’s book that most likely would be read\n\nat bedtime, which should be a quiet time without the need for music or other distraction\n\nin the background. I’d want the child to focus on the story and appreciate the beautiful\n\nillustrations without thinking about how it compares to other books, movies or shows.\n\nThat all said, in coming up with the Fortune Fairy of Beauty, I was inspired by a\n\nStar Trek, The Next Generation episode in which certain aliens evolved from their\n\ncorporeal states into beings of pure energy. I didn’t feel comfortable depicting the\n\nconcept of beauty through physical attributes of a human because beauty is a\n\nsubjective ideal. So, I illustrated beauty as a life force radiating light and positive energy\n\nfrom a heart to correlate with what the fairy says: “Beauty is not what you see with eyes\n\nbut with your heart.”\n\n3. Why did you choose this topic for your book?\n\nWhen my daughter was little, I wrote original children’s stories and created\n\npuppet shows from the stories.\n\nOne of the stories from those days is the precursor to Hope and Fortune called\n\nThe Lost Foal. For my daughter’s 7 th birthday, I wanted to put on a show for her and her\n\nfriends at her party. She wanted a story about cowgirls, fairies, and her little stuffed\n\nhorse. I came up with a story entitled, The Lost Foal. In The Lost Foal, the stuffed\n\nhorse was the one that got lost in the forest and encountered “cowgirl fairies” played by\n\nmy daughter and her guests, each of whom wore fairy wings and pink cowboy hats and\n\ngave the horse life advice to get it back on the right track.\n\nFast forward 16 years later to the pandemic and lockdown in 2020. I felt bad for\n\nmy daughter, her peers and those younger, all of whom faced unprecedented\n\nuncertainties in life. Many of them were really lost. I then took The Lost Foal,\n\nmodernized it with a diverse cast of characters, and created a message that I hope will\n\nresonate not only with the very young but also with those less so who may feel\n\nrudderless and lost – in however way you want to define and contextualize those terms\n\n– at some point in their lives.\n\n4. What led to your choosing the setting for your book?\n\nI always imagined – rightly or wrongly – that fairies lived in wooded areas, so I\n\ncreated the world called the Fabled Fairy Forest.\n\nI think more important than the overall setting for the book is how I depicted each\n\ncharacter’s setting within the forest. In writing and illustrating Hope and Fortune, I\n\nlearned that numbers, colors, and animals represent or symbolize certain ideals and\n\nprinciples that dovetail nicely with what I wanted to say in the book. I then incorporated\n\na lot of that symbolism to make the story as multifaceted as possible. I explain all this in\n\ngreater detail in a document I created called the “Backstory of and Guide to Hope and\n\nFortune,” a copy of which I’m attaching for your background information. Another\n\nblogger in this tour will be writing more about the symbolism that I used in the book.\n\n5. How did you come up with the title of your book and what is its significance?\n\nI finalized this book during the pandemic when everything was so bleak and\n\ndreary. I wanted to put something out in the universe that was uplifting and conveyed\n\npositivity.\n\nEsperanza is my daughter’s middle name, and she is my muse for all my stories.\n\nThe protagonist in the book is named after her. Esperanza is also the Spanish word for\n\n“hope.”\n\nI also wanted to pay homage to my late mom, who along with my dad brought my 9 siblings and me to this country from the mountain province of the Philippines with\n\nliterally nothing more than the hope that we would all have a better life here. She is\n\ndepicted as the Fortune Fairy of Hope.\n\nAs for the “Fortune” part of the title, when I wrote the book, I wanted a nice\n\nalliteration with the word “fairy” that has an optimistic feeling. My fairies were\n\ndispensing life advice intended to bring good fortune to Esperanza in her path in life.\n\nHence, the Fortune Fairies came to life.\n\n6. How has your own experience influenced your writing?\n\nIf you’re asking how my life experience/career influenced how I write, writing is\n\nmy favorite part of the job as a lawyer. Being a lawyer has made me confident in my\n\ngeneral writing and editing skills.\n\nChildren’s illustrated books usually have a limit of 1000-1500 words. It’s often a\n\nchallenge to get complex messages and concepts across with that limitation. But, as a\n\nlitigator, it’s my job to tell a client’s story in a concise and relatable way. From that\n\nperspective, my experience as a lawyer positively influenced the way that I wrote about\n\nthe various principles or ideals discussed by the Fortune Fairies.\n\nIf, on the other hand, you’re asking how my general life experience influenced\n\nwhat I write, I’ve found that as a mom, talking to one’s own kids about certain things can\n\nbe very difficult to start, much less sustain. As one reviewer has pointed out, this book\n\nis “a great discussion aid” on topics that deal with self-esteem, self-discovery and self-\n\nacceptance.\n\nI’m also a very “visual” person, with some artistic leanings. I believe that artistic\n\nexpressions are simply different forms of storytelling. So, as more fully describe in the\n\nattached backstory and guide, I intentionally curated the illustrations in Hope and\n\nFortune to supplement the fewer-than-1000 words I used to create a multi-faceted story.\n\n7. What will connect the reader to the story?\n\nThe story had universal appeal. For example, in December, I did a reading of\n\nHope and Fortune at a local library in New York City. After I read the book, a 7-year-old\n\nboy took a copy of the book to read to himself. He then followed me around until he had\n\nmy full attention to tell me how much he loved the book and that now he wants to write a\n\nbook someday too. Even though the book is about a little girl with a Spanish name and\n\nfairies, the story still resonated with a little Asian boy – which is more than I could’ve\n\nhoped for. How wonderful to be able to touch the hearts and minds of young children\n\nwith just a few words and illustrations.\n\nAnd not only the young. Many grown-ups have told me they wish they had this\n\nbook when they were growing up. Also, several early readers have stated in their\n\nreviews that this book should be read by adults as well as kids.\n\nIn addition to the story itself, the illustrations add another path through which the\n\nreader could connect to the book. Many people have expressed their gratitude to me\n\npersonally for creating such a diverse cast of characters because they could see\n\nthemselves and their children represented in the book. When I say “representation,” I’m\n\nnot just talking about non-White people. Two incidents brought this home to me\n\nrecently.\n\nThe first incident involved an early reader of the book who has a little boy to\n\nwhom she read the book. She then wrote that the little boy “loves” the book, partly\n\nbecause the Fortune Fairy of Innocence and Wonder looks like him – a beautiful blond,\n\nblue-eyed boy. That’s precisely the type of reaction and narrative I wanted to create\n\nwith the Fortune Fairy of Innocence and Wonder.\n\nUnfortunately, the second incident is far from uplifting but nonetheless\n\ndemonstrates the obvious need for diverse representation in children’s books. This is\n\nwhat happened when I advertised my reading of Hope and Fortune at a local library on\n\na public page on Facebook:\n\nShe deliberately chose to ignore my conciliatory tone and further challenged:\n\n“that doesn’t look like a white fairy.” What is a white fairy supposed to look like?!? Her\n\ncombativeness and willful refusal to acknowledge that non-White characters can – and\n\nshould – exist in children’s books is exactly why representation matters. In Hope and\n\nFortune, both Whites and non-Whites are represented. Everyone is exposed to the idea\n\nthat people that may look different from us may have something valid to say and\n\ncontribute for the betterment of humanity.\n\n8. Did you have difficulty deciding your book was ready to publish?\n\nNot really. I lived with the concept since my daughter was young and it just took\n\na little tweaking before I submitted it for publication.\n\n9. What genre(s) and reader ages would your work fit best?\n\nChildren’s illustrated books, ages 5-10, although as I’ve said, I’ve often been told\n\nthat adults should read the book and learn from it as well. Sub-genres include diversity,\n\nmulticulturalism, self-esteem and self-reliance, social themes of values and virtues, fairy\n\ntales.\n\n10. What’s your next project idea?\n\nI’m currently putting the finishing touches to my second book, Hues and Harmony\n\n– How the Rainbow Butterfly Got Her Colors. It’s about multiraciality, empowerment,\n\nself-acceptance and belonging as told through the life and adventures of a singing\n\ncaterpillar. I use common shapes, primary colors, and basic chemistry concepts to\n\nconvey my message.\n\nLike Hope and Fortune, Hues and Harmony is a re-write of story and puppet\n\nshow from my daughter’s childhood entitled The Singing Rainbow Butterfly. At that\n\ntime, I created the puppet caterpillar in the story out of round silver pot scrubbers held\n\ntogether by a wire, string, and popsicle sticks, not to mention a prayer. I think I still have\n\nthat caterpillar somewhere and intend to use it when I do public readings for Hues and\n\nHarmony.\n\nEsperanza and the Fortune Fairies from Hope and Fortune make a cameo – yet\n\nimportant – appearance in Hues and Harmony, but it’s not a sequel.\n\nI am using the same illustrator, and the dialogue/songs are also in rhyme so it will\n\nhave the same look, feel, and sound as Hope and Fortune. I’m happy with how Hope\n\nand Fortune turned out and I want Hues and Harmony, as well as any other subsequent\n\nbooks, to have the same quality.\n\nHues and Harmony is scheduled for official release on July 20, 2023.\n\nYou may find Hope and Fortune by Marissa Bañez at just about every online outlet including:\n\nAbout the Author\n\nA first-generation immigrant to the U.S. from the Philippines, Marissa Bañez is a graduate of Princeton University and a lawyer licensed to practice in New York, California and New Jersey. She has published legal articles for the prestigious New York Law Journal and the American Bar Association, but her true passion for writing lies in her children’s stories. She currently lives in New York City with her husband and daughter. Her childhood was filled with many original stories and puppet shows made up entirely by her mom. In her free time, Marissa likes to travel, design and make clothes, cook, binge-watch Star Trek shows and Korean dramas, and occasionally strum a guitar.\n\nShe is currently working on her second book, Hues and Harmony (How the Singing Rainbow Butterfly Got Her\n\nColors), a story about mixed or multiracial children, self-discovery, and respect for others as told through the\n\nlife and adventures of a caterpillar.

The author asserts his moral and legal rights over this work.\n\n12 Questions with MHR Geer, author of ASSUMED.\n\nWhen her friend Sandy asks for help, Anne Wilson leaves her small, lonely life in Miami for the picturesque island of Saint Martin. But as soon as she arrives, Sandy is murdered, and her death exposes lies: an alias, a secret past, stolen money. Suspected of murder and trapped on the island, Anne is shocked when a cryptic message arrives:\n\nFind the money. Take it and run.\n\nShe follows Sandy’s trail of obscure clues, desperate for proof of her innocence and must decide if she can trust the two men who offer help-the dark, mysterious Brit or the American with a wide grin and a pickup truck. When memories resurface-dark truths she’d rather leave buried and forgotten, her past becomes intertwined with her present.\n\nHer only way forward is to face her own secrets.\n\nWhich was the hardest character to write?\n\nAnne. Have you ever disliked someone the first time you met them, but then as you got to know them you realized they were just shy and perhaps quite sad? That’s how it felt to write Anne. I\n\ndidn’t approve of her choices, but chapter after chapter she showed such strength, and I\n\nwarmed to her.\n\nYour book is set in Saint Martin, an island in the Caribbean. Have you ever been there?\n\nYes. (sigh) Such a beautiful place. I want to go back.\n\nDo you have another profession besides writing?\n\nI’m a bookkeeper by day. It’s the opposite of creative writing.\n\nHow long have you been writing?\n\nI’ve always journaled, but I began writing novels about nine years ago – which is about the time\n\nmy first marriage fell apart. Huh, I never made that connection before. Whew. That’s a\n\nbreakthrough of sorts, isn’t it?\n\nWhat is your next project?\n\nBook 2: Accused. Anne’s story continues! It will be released in 2023.\n\nWhat is a favorite compliment you have received on your writing?\n\nThe feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. But the one comment that stands out is when\n\nan Amazon reviewer said that Anne (my main character) was so REAL. That was amazing to\n\nhear.\n\nHow are you similar to or different from your lead character?\n\nWe are very different, but we do have a couple things in common. She works in accounting like I\n\ndo, and we’ve both suffered significant loss – the kind of loss that you never really recover from.\n\nWriting her character was so interesting because she dealt with her loss so differently than I did.\n\nFavorite travel spot?\n\nKansas City. Such a friendly place. It always inspires creativity. I love the Nelson-Atkins\n\nmuseum and City Market on the weekends. Also, there’s a place in Westport Plaza that makes\n\nthe best Matcha ever. Don’t get me started on the barbeque…yum.\n\nAny hobbies?\n\nSo many hobbies. Knitting mostly, but I enjoy loads of crafts, jewelry and macrame. I want to try\n\npottery, but my yarn takes up too much space. I simply don’t have room in my life for clay. Yet.\n\nWhat TV series are you currently binge watching?\n\nA while ago, season 1 of Silent Witness popped up as a recommendation on my BritBox. It\n\nshould have come with a disclaimer like “Don’t watch this unless you’re prepared to commit\n\nseveral months to it.” Sheeshers. I just finished Season 25. I don’t regret a thing. Well. Maybe I\n\nregret some of the popcorn.\n\nTell us about your longest friendship.\n\nMarie. We met in college because our boyfriends were roommates, and we both instantly had a\n\n“you’re my person” moment. I live in California, and she lives on the East Coast, so we meet\n\nannually in random cities in the middle of the country to hang out. She’s still my person after all\n\nthis time.\n\nWhat is the strangest way you've become friends with someone?\n\nOne of my friendships started during the darkest period in my life. We were at a youth football\n\npractice that my ex-husband was coaching. I can’t even remember why, but I had to move my\n\nchair, and someone I barely knew carried it for me. That’s it. She carried my chair. It was a tiny\n\nthing, but the gesture meant the world to me. And we’ve been close friends ever since.\n\nAuthor Bio:\n\nMHR Geer was born in California but grew up in the Midwest. She attended the University of California, Santa Barbara to study Physics. After school, she moved to Ventura, CA and started a small bookkeeping business.

The author asserts his moral and legal rights over this work.\n\n16 Questions with Tammy Euliano, author of Misfire.\n\nKadence, a new type of implanted defibrillator, misfires in a patient visiting University Hospital\n\nfor a routine medical procedure—causing the heart rhythm problem it’s meant to correct. Dr.\n\nKate Downey, an experienced anesthesiologist, resuscitates the patient, but she grows\n\nconcerned for a loved one who recently received the same device—her beloved Great-Aunt Irm.\n\nWhen a second device misfires, Kate turns to Nikki Yarborough, her friend and Aunt Irm’s\n\ncardiologist. Though Nikki helps protect Kate’s aunt, she is prevented from alerting other\n\npatients by the corporate greed of her department chairman. As the inventor of the device and\n\npart owner of MDI, the company he formed to commercialize it, he claims that the device\n\nmisfires are due to a soon-to-be-corrected software bug. Kate learns his claim is false.\n\nThe misfires continue as Christian O’Donnell, a friend and lawyer, comes to town to facilitate the\n\nsale of MDI. Kate and Nikki are drawn into a race to find the source of the malfunctions, but\n\nthreats to Nikki and a mysterious murder complicate their progress. Are the seemingly random\n\nshocks misfires, or are they attacks?\n\nA jaw-dropping twist causes her to rethink everything she once thought she knew, but Kate will\n\nstop at nothing to protect her aunt and the other patients whose life-saving devices could turn\n\non them at any moment..\n\nHow did you do research for your book?\n\nI’m fortunate to be a professor at an academic medical center and therefore have access to the\n\nmedical professionals to ask questions and gain ideas. Also, I co-developed some medical\n\ndevices over the years and have been through the patenting and licensure process so it was fun\n\nto include some first-hand knowledge, and to pick the brains of other scientists with whom we’ve\n\ncrossed paths.\n\nWhere do you get inspiration for your stories?\n\nMy inspiration comes from life experiences—working in academic medicine, talking with people\n\nin technology and healthcare industries, and reading both fiction and non-fiction, and of course\n\nthe news (preferably science news, not all the other stuff).\n\nWhat advice would you give budding writers?\n\nFind a supportive group of other early career writers, read, take classes that provide\n\nprofessional feedback, attend a writers’ conference if at all possible, develop thick skin, write\n\nwhat you love, consider writing some short fiction for an earlier win.\n\nYour book is set in north central Florida. Have you ever been there?\n\nIt’s where I’ve lived since undergrad. Though not Gainesville by name, and certainly not the\n\nUniversity of Florida, the book is set in the area, including Paynes Prairie where we’ve gone on\n\nlong walks, and Jacksonville, which we visit on occasion. It’s a great place to live and raise a\n\nfamily, with springs and beaches nearby and (often) excellent collegiate sports to cheer for.\n\nDo you have another profession besides writing?\n\nI’m a physician, an academic anesthesiologist specializing in obstetrics. For 20+ years I’ve\n\ntaught, performed research, and cared for patients at the University of Florida’s hospital system.\n\nI’ve now backed down to 60% so I can focus on writing…it’s never enough!\n\nWhat is your next project?\n\nBesides finishing up the third in the Kate Downey series, I’m working on a stand-alone that links\n\nthe Salem Witch Trials to a modern medical mystery. It’s based on a short story I published a\n\nfew years ago and I’m having fun plotting it out.\n\nWhat is the last great book you’ve read?\n\nIn non-fiction, 4000 Weeks: Time Management for Mortals by Oliver Burkeman. In fiction,\n\nDesert Star by Michael Connelly. I’m currently reading A World of Curiosities by Louise Penny,\n\nmy favorite series!\n\nHow are you similar to or different from your lead character?\n\nWe started out quite alike as far as careers go, but she lacks my idyllic backstory with a\n\ncharmed childhood and parents and husband very much alive. She’s also way cooler than I am!\n\nIn one sentence, what was the road to publishing like?\n\nFor the first in the series it was long, full of rejections, self-doubt, learning, and more rejections,\n\nand finally extremely rewarding! Misfire was the second in a two-book deal, so far more straight-\n\nforward.\n\nWhich authors inspired you to write?\n\nHarlan Coben, Louise Penny\n\nFavorite travel spot?\n\nI love the mountains (said the Florida girl), especially hiking and downhill skiing. We’ve been so\n\nblessed with incredible travel opportunities to all the major national parks in the US, Costa Rica,\n\nthe Galapagos, Europe, even New Zealand. Probably my favorite would be hiking in Wengen,\n\nSwitzerland.\n\nFavorite dessert?\n\nHmmm, my husband’s home-made fruit crumbles with ice cream. Cookies and cream ice cream\n\nwith my dad. Who am I kidding – most ice cream with most anyone.\n\nIf you were stuck on a deserted island, which 3 books would you want with you?\n\n(1) the entire Louise Penny Gamache series squished into one book cover, (2) an encyclopedia,\n\n(3) The famous double book: “How to Make a Boat out of Sand, Salt Water and Coconuts” and\n\n“The Joy of Cooking Without Actually Cooking”\n\nAny hobbies? or Name a quirky thing you like to do.\n\nMy husband and I met playing flag football in college, taking turns at quarterback due to the\n\nrules for co-ed sports. Now we still enjoy sports, but also seeking active experiences while\n\ntraveling – via ferrata, canyoning, rappelling down waterfalls, etc. We also follow the Gator\n\nfootball team, though they’re trying our patience lately.\n\nIf there is one thing you want readers to remember about you, what would it be?\n\nThat I’m a physician-turned-author who highly recommends reassessing your path and\n\ngoalposts at regular intervals. It’s not quitting, it’s pivoting to something better/different/more\n\nsuited to you today.\n\nWhat is the oldest item of clothing you own?\n\nIntramural sports championship t-shirts from undergrad. We were the geeky honors dorm kids\n\nwho crushed everyone else by planning ahead with football plays printed out using the earliest\n\nversion of drafting software…oh, and not being drunk at game time.\n\nAuthor Bio:\n\nTammy Euliano writes medical thrillers. She’s inspired by her day job as a physician, researcher and medical educator. She is a tenured professor at the University of Florida, where she’s been honored with numerous teaching awards, nearly 100,000 views of her YouTube teaching videos, and was featured in a calendar of women inventors (copies available wherever you buy your out-of-date calendars).\n\nWhen she’s not writing or at the hospital, she enjoys traveling with her family, playing sports,\n\ncheering on the Gators, and entertaining her two wonderful dogs.\n\nWebsite: http://www.teuliano.com\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/teuliano\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/teuliano\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/teuliano/\n\n© 2014-2023- Ronovan Hester Copyright reserved.

The climate crisis is hitting harder than ever: a mega-hurricane has devastated the eco-system and waves of refugees pour into Washington, D.C.\n\nEnvironmental lawyer and media darling Patty Garcia dies in a bizarre accident on a golf course. Of the seven billion people on the planet, only Jen thinks she was murdered. After all, Garcia just won a court case for massive climate change reparations to be paid out by oil, gas, and coal companies. Jen is warned off, but she and Chandler start digging. Signs point to Garcia’s abusive ex, a former oil giant, but soon Jen turns up more suspects who have an even greater motive for committing murder\n\nSoon Jen is in the crosshairs of those who will ensure the truth never comes to light, no matter the cost. She has to move quickly before she becomes next on the killer’s list.\n\n“[An] outstanding series launch…Exceptional worldbuilding is complemented by sympathetic characters and suspenseful plot twists. Kaufman is a writer to watch.” — Publishers Weekly, starred review\n\nThis is the second book in your Jen Lu series. How soon after finishing the first book did you know you wanted to continue Jen’s story?\n\nThe minute I read the first reviews. I knew I’d taken a risk writing a mystery that bent genres and that delved into political themes, but only when I started hearing from readers did I realize how much my approach — page-turning, serious themes yet fun to read — was something I wanted to continue doing.\n\nYou have decades of experience working with the United Nations, NGOs and various government officials and educators. How have you used this expertise to write about some complex topics like climate change and the intricacies of the oil and gas industry?\n\nI’ve worked directly with presidents and prime ministers. I could answer that this has given me insights into the workings of political power. But here’s my real answer: We all need stories. Not only to entertain but to make sense of our lives. Right now, there is no more important issue than the quickly emerging climate crisis and the utter culpability of the oil, gas and coal industries in destroying our future.\n\n“The Last Resort” has a secondary theme of men’s violence against women. How does this fit into the story?\n\nIt’s a critical theme in itself. Across the country and around the world, there is a rash of violence against women: in our homes, at work, at places of learning and on the streets. Engaging men as allies with women to end this violence has been my life’s work.\n\n“An engrossing thriller set in a fascinatingly plausible near future, ‘The Last Exit’ centres on a human-AI partnership that’s as believable as it’s moving.” — Emma Donoghue, New York Times bestselling author of “Room”\n\nThere are a variety of politically charged themes throughout the book. What would you say to people who are looking for a fiction book that “isn’t political”?\n\nFirst of all, “The Last Resort,” is entertainment. It’s fun; it’s exciting. My goal isn’t to educate — I leave that to my nonfiction books. At the same time, every moment of our lives is shaped by political realities, and that is nowhere more true than with the climate crisis. I believe that some of the most powerful stories ever written weave in the political and social realities of the day. Imagine if Tolstoy had left out the war part; his great novel would have read like a Netflix costume drama.\n\nSpeaking of politics, there are a lot of tough themes the book touches on, but the series’s tone overall is ultimately one of hope (surrounded with humor). Why did you choose to go this route?\n\nThe last thing readers need is another grim dystopia. I believe strongly in the human capacity to change, not simply at the individual level but our ability to imagine and then to create a better world. Faced with the existential realities of the climate crisis, we need that vision of hope and change more than ever. Shouldn’t fiction that digs into the tough issues we face today and in years ahead bring us up rather than bring us down?\n\nWhat do you hope readers gain from the book?\n\nGain? I hope they gain some absolutely entertaining moments. I hope they can’t put it down. But I also hope it allows them to imagine a future that is certainly full of challenges but also possibilities for positive change.\n\nIs there another Jen Lu book in the works? Are you working on any other projects?\n\nYes, there will be a sequel. I’m also at work on a traditional thriller as well as a literary novel and a screenplay. Plus, of course, I continue my advisory role with various U.N. agencies, governments, NGOs and companies. That said, I can’t wait to hang out again with Jen Lu and Chandler, her computer implant and wannabe tough guy.\n\n“ ‘The Last Exit’ hits hard. Fast action — a melding of the mental and physical — keeps this smart futuristic thriller racing, and its contemporary implications keep the reader thinking.” —Thomas Perry, bestselling author of “A Small Town”\n\nAuthor Bio:\n\nMICHAEL KAUFMAN has worked for decades engaging men to support women’s rights and positively transform the lives of men.

I feel the presence of both good and evil, which seem to loosely pull at me. Which direction to take? A light can only slightly penetrate the thickness of the darkness. Faces begin to appear as ghost-like images; it’s a warning, which I do not heed.\n\nThe images become clearer. They are the faces of beautiful women, goddesses perhaps; they draw my very being deeper into the darkness, serenaded by their gentle voices lifting away my fear of the unknown. I am floating now, effortlessly on a bed of soft blowing air. I am totally consumed. Have I fallen under a spell? I call out for help.\n\nSuddenly there is a flash of brilliant light and the real faces of the women are revealed to me. They are the true evil ones, the guardians of the darkness, the Temptress Sirens of the Dark Lords. They have surrounded me. I see a faint light in the distance. I begin to run towards the light, I feel Temptress Sirens clawing at me as I try to go towards the light in hopes of a safe passage. I hear a voice ever so softly… “Don’t go to the light……. Don’t go to the light……. It will deceive you. Use your faith and follow your heart.”\n\nI stop but I can feel the Temptress Sirens stalking me. I move through the\n\ncomplete darkness with my eyes closed now. There then appears a golden mist that forms a stairway leading upward through the darkness. Without hesitation, I follow the stairway climbing slowly out of the darkness. I can still feel the draw of the Temptress Sirens at my back growing stronger. I become weary as I continue to climb. The strength of the Temptress Sirens is beginning to hold me back. I fear I cannot make it to the top. A silhouetted hand appears from out of the darkness above me. I do not know whether to take it. I have no choice. I grab the hand and a gentle pull brings me away from the grasp of the Temptress Sirens. I hear their shrieks of madness slowly fade away as I am pulled forward.\n\nA gentle light appears and an Angel appears before me. She has the youthful\n\nbeauty of a thousand ages. I hear her gentle voice speaking to me yet her lips do not move. Her name is Afriel. She is a being of light charged with safeguarding young life. She is to protect that which is youthful and tenderly growing within each of us, no matter how old we actually are. Afriel grants youth, vigor, and vitality. She places her hand on my forehead and closes her eyes as she nods her head and says, “go forward and save your brother, Nicholas.”\n\nAndrew and his older brother Nicholas were separated as children.\n\nNicholas had been snatched away by the Prince of Darkness, and Andrew had all but given up hope, but now their mother is ill, and he’s determined to reunite them before she passes – despite her objections.\n\nWith his dog Jenny by his side, Andrew sets out on an epic and perilous crusade well beyond his wildest imagination, facing evil protectors, giant wolves, dark magic, Sorcerers, Goblins, and even the Prince of Darkness himself.\n\nThen there’s The Great Tree.\n\nIt’s enormous, with a presence that’s nearly impossible to describe…\n\nAnd it’s clearly the heart of the kingdom of the wicked Sorcerer.\n\nThis is the setting for the adventure story that changed Christmas forever!\n\nAll proceeds from the sale of The Great Tree go to The Last Road Dog Animal Sanctuary to rescue unadoptable dogs, cats, and horses, an approved 501 (c)(3) Animal Public Welfare Charity that greatly appreciates the ongoing support of readers like you!\n\nJenny the dog is based on a very real Jenny, the author’s vision of a true warrior – who has her own inspiring story that he’s happy to share with anyone who asks.\n\nAmazon: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BGK2ZNJF\n\nGoodreads: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60553311-the-great-tree\n\nAuthor Links:\n\nWebsite: www.thelastroaddog.com\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TLRDSANCTUARY\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/blkdogr4/\n\nAuthor Bio:\n\nAble Barrett is a former Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney and U.S. Department of Justice Organized Crime Strike Force Prosecutor who shamelessly admits he loves animals more than most people, and he’s the manager of The Last Road Dog Animal Sanctuary.\n\n© 2014-2022- Ronovan Hester Copyright reserved.

Laszlo\n\nWhat would be your one sentence elevator pitch of what your book is about?\n\nIn this trio of novellas, three game young ladies enter into dangerous liaisons that test each one’s limits and force them to confront the most heartrending issues facing society in the early twentieth century. The Phantom Glare of Day is a compelling interrogation of who gets to decide what is right and what is wrong.\n\n[The novellas are set during the height of WWI and post-WWI Europe.]\n\nWhat book/author/movie/TV show/song might a potential reader compare your book to in order to get an idea of its feel and why?\n\nThe Phantom Glare of Day might best be described as traditional, twentieth-century melodrama suffused with the following: Goth youth culture, the film Nosferatu, lots of Germanic brooding, the poetry and symbolism of Nietzsche, and a ravishingly beautiful figure-skating ballet just for good measure.\n\nWhy did you choose this topic for your book?\n\nThis topic chose me. These novellas arise from a deeply held obsession with grasping the essential ethical issues that face society. By writing the book, it is my hope that the novellas may challenge readers to think about and to come to terms with those same heartrending questions.\n\nWhat led to your choosing the setting for your book? In part your mention of steampunk as used in your book.\n\nHaving traveled to London, Paris, and Prague, and having kept travel diaries for those beautiful cities, there was no way to avoid my setting stories in those remarkable places. Interestingly, though, my impressions of Prague were always informed by the genre of steampunk. What I mean by that is that Prague is the city with which I’ve always associated the science-fiction play Rossum’s Universal Robots. Because of this, Prague inspired me to write about steampunk/primitive robotic technologies—as such, these peculiar technologies and themes and obsessions appear in that tale. With regard to Weimar, that’s the most peculiar question for me because I’ve never been there. Still, the history of das Bauhaus has always fascinated me—and because of this, there was no way to avoid the temptation to set a tale there.\n\nHow did you come up with the title of your book?\n\nThe Phantom Glare of Day comes from a line in “Butterflies”—a WW-era Siegfried Sassoon poem. The title seemed perfect to me because various world religions have always associated butterflies with the immortality of the soul. For me, that metaphysical idea resonates because these three novellas amount to a new kind of metaphysical storytelling.\n\nHow has your world traveling impressed itself on your writing?\n\nNothing has impressed my writing more than my travels to London, where I became fascinated by British colloquialism and phraseology. Nothing else makes British characters come to life more than giving them authentic voices as they engage one another in dialogue. In short, dialogue has to be real. Characters must talk the way people really talk. This comes down to the fact it is the vernacular that makes characters and their stories seem genuine. My travel diaries provided me with all kinds of descriptions of various places, of course; nevertheless, my travel diaries were most important to me in that they included many, many lists of those remarkable terms that only the Brits use.\n\nWhat will connect the reader to the story?\n\nThese novellas tell of how people struggle with issues that anyone can find relatable: school bullying, abortion, euthanasia, political extremism, and homophobia. As such, any reader should be able to connect with the characters. At the same time, the narrator’s voice remains solemn and philosophical; moreover, the writing is suffused in objective correlative—symbols intended to resonate with the reader’s unconscious mind. If the reader really gives my work a chance, the reader can and will connect.\n\nRemember, though, when you read The Phantom Glare of Day, you’ll quickly see that it’s like nothing you’ve ever read before. Perhaps that’s why the work is fated to get so many mixed reviews. This work is weird and revolutionary in its style.\n\nDid you have difficulty deciding your book was ready to publish?\n\nYes and no. Leonardo Da Vinci said it best: “Art is never finished, only abandoned.”\n\nWhat genre(s) and reader ages would your work fit best?\n\nAs for genre, there are different possibilities: coming of age, urban fantasy, historical fiction, metaphysical fiction, melodrama, and perhaps even magical realism. In truth, the work is trans-genre. Also, who cares what the genre is? It’s literature. And it’s meant for anyone mature enough to embrace the idea of freethinking and/or open-mindedness and/or freedom for the sake of freedom.\n\nWhat’s your next project idea?\n\nMy next project promises to be a complete mind-scramble. In the coming book, it is my intention to take the reader on a journey alongside a figure who resolves the riddle of the universe—and in the final movement of the tale, the character will in fact explain the riddle of the universe. For that matter, too, the answer provided will be accurate. And that is my pledge.\n\nBiography of M. Laszlo\n\nM. Laszlo is the pseudonym of a reclusive author living in Bath, Ohio. According to rumor, he based the pen name on the name of the Paul Henreid character in Casablanca, Victor Laszlo.\n\nHe has lived and worked in New York City, East Jerusalem, and several other cities around the world. While living in the Middle East, he worked for Harvard University’s Semitic Museum. He holds a bachelor’s degree in English from Hiram College in Hiram, Ohio and an M.F.A. in poetry from Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, New York.\n\nHis next work is forthcoming from SparkPress in 2024. There are whispers that the work purports to be a genuine attempt at positing an explanation for the riddle of the universe and is based on journals and idea books made while completing his M.F.A at Sarah Lawrence College.\n\nThe Phantom Glare of Day is available at Amazon.\n\n© 2014-2022- Ronovan Hester Copyright reserved. The author asserts his moral and legal rights over this work.\n\n16 Questions with Kurt Hansen, author of Daughters of Teutobod.\n\nDaughters of Teutobod is a story of love triumphing over hate, of persistence in the face of domination, and of the strength of women in the face of adversity.\n\nGudrun is the stolen wife of Teutobod, the leader of the Teutons in Gaul in 102 BCE. Her story culminates in a historic battle with the Roman army.\n\nSusanna is a German American farm wife in Pennsylvania whose husband, Karl, has strong affinity for the Nazi party in Germany. Susanna’s story revolves around raising her three daughters and one son as World War II unfolds.\n\nFinally, Gretel is the infant child of Susanna, now seventy-nine years old and a professor of women’s studies, a US senator and Nobel laureate for her World Women’s Initiative. She is heading to France to represent the United States at the seventy-fifth anniversary of the liberation of southern France, at the commemoration site where her older brother, who was killed in action nearby, is buried. The site is very near the location where the Romans defeated the Teutons.\n\nHow did you do research for your book?\n\nOnline searches for everything about the Teutons to pre-war Pennsylvania and the earliest training of American Rangers, Northern Ireland, Scotland, and modern-day sites in Paris and Southern France.\n\nWhich was the hardest character to write? The easiest?\n\nHardest? Ada.\n\nEasiest? Gretel.\n\nHow long have you been writing?\n\nAfter heart disease forced early retirement, I began attending the Iowa Summer Writer’s Festival in 2014.

Greatest challenge is slogging through the research and persisting through the dialogues.\n\nIn one sentence, what was the road to publishing like?\n\nIt was painful and frustrating.\n\nWhich authors inspired you to write?\n\nPhilip Roth, Harper Lee, Richard Russo, Flannery O’Connor, Charles Dickens, Michael Crighton, Dan Brown, Kurt Vonnegut, Amy Hassinger\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFun stuff:\n\nFavorite travel spot?\n\nToledo, Spain.\n\nFavorite dessert?\n\nSour cream raisin pie.\n\nIf you were stuck on a deserted island, which 3 books would you want with you?\n\nTo Kill a Mockingbird, A Tale of Two Cities, and the Bible.\n\nAny hobbies? or Name a quirky thing you like to do.\n\nI collect rock-n-roll memorabilia.

The author asserts his moral and legal rights over this work.\n\n14 Questions with Reenita M Hora, author of Operation Mom.\n\nIla, a Mumbai-based teenager, is going nuts with Veena, her controlling, single mother who prevents her from stalking her pop idol, Ali Zafar. Veena wants her daughter to date real guys in the lead-up to finding a husband. But Ila decides that the only way to get her mom off her back is by finding her a boyfriend instead. With the help of her best friend Deepali, her crush Dev and her mother’s best friend Maleeka, they will come up with a plan to make it happen by setting up a profile in dating apps.\n\nThis interview has to start off with this question. In your book you make a reference to George Michael, how did you come up with this idea?\n\nIn my book, I make reference to George Michael of Wham, the famous English pop singer who I was desperately in love with in my teen years. And I know that I speak for just about every woman who grew up in the 80s! The George Michael anecdote is taken directly from my life – I stalked him in my teen years, and in mind you in those days there was no such thing as social media, cell phone – smart or dumb or the internet. So the fact that I traveled from Mumbai to London one summer and tracked him down is a real life example of investigative research that I take great pride in!\n\nI guess here is the story – a year or two before I wrote the book, I was chatting with my brother’s friend at a party and somehow, we got talking about the whole George Michael episode. The guy listened with rapt amazement as I gave him the details of how I stalked the pop star through his cat. He said to me ‘That would make a great chick flick, you know!’\n\nI was intrigued but know nothing about film so decided to turn it into YA chick-lit instead!\n\nThere are many books out there about the life of women in India, Mumbai in this case….What makes yours different?\n\nOh my goodness, do you like to laugh? If so then Operation Mom will hit your funny bone. I think that many of us Indians take ourselves too seriously and cliched as it sounds, laughter really is medicine for your mind-body. The BBC has done huge amounts of research on how it helps the aging process, supports fitness and keeps couples together. But this book is not simply about LOL moments, it’s about LOL moments in the Bombay context — it offers a real window into the trials and tribulations of the feisty Punjai woman in Bombay.\n\nAnd then there is that whole element of predictability and safety in India. You don’t find stories where the daughter is setting the mother up – usually it happens the other way around. You don’t find stories which expose you to a variety of ethnic situations strewn around Mumbai – all ripe for comedic interpretation. That’s what I wanted to do. As a Mumbaikar…or a Bombay-ite, I feel like I have many affinities – to the Punjabi way of life, to the Parsi community, to places like Swati Snacks and Worli Seaface…these all found their way into my book.\n\nHow did you do research for your book?\n\nHaving grown up in Mumbai, the research was easy. I knew the places I wanted to set the story in. I knew what they were about and the kind of crazy character chaos that I would find in those locations. Of course, this being a YA book, me now being a full-fledged adult (at least in size if not maturity levels), I knew I had to be up with the ‘method of madness’ of the current Mumbai young adult. So I had huge amounts of fun talking to my school going nephew and his friends to learning the lingo, compare the mindset from my time to theirs and quickly adapt to the change. Then of course I had fun taking long bus rides through town and hanging out at places like Swati Snacks and Kalaghoda Cafe (locations referred to in the story) to people watch and eavesdrop on conversations. Research is really one of the most fun parts of creating a story.\n\nIn your book you seem to look at relationships between flawed characters….why is that?\n\nIn my book I talk about relationships among flawed characters because isn’t this who we are and what makes us tick? I capture the sometimes-difficult relationship between mother and daughter, friend and friend, husband and wife, and boy and girl. My exploration is that of coming of age in a world filled with imperfect people. I aim to be both humorous and heartfelt, and from beginning to end, I resist any attempt to apply makeup to innocence, or hide the stubbornness or intelligence of my characters.\n\nIf you could put yourself as a character in your book, who would you be?\n\nAnother hard one. While in many ways I myself identify with the plight of Ila and her mom, Veena, it’s hard not to fall in love with the wild and wacky Aunty Maleeka or Deepali. They are the very antithesis of the classic Punjabi woman and in many ways they are who Veena and Ila live vicariously through. Truth is, I think we all need a bit of Aunty Maleeka or Deepali in our lives!\n\nWhich was the hardest character to write? The easiest?\n\nOof, this is hard to say. Ila and Veena (mother and daughter) are essentially the same woman in two different generational bodies. So when I look at the zany women in my own household, Yours Truly in particular, it isn’t hard to come up with traits and quirks that easily define these main characters. As to the hardest character again…there has been.\n\nHow are you similar to or different from your lead character?\n\nLike I alluded to earlier, in many ways I identify with the plight of Ila and her mom, Veena. Both of these characters are essentially the same woman in two different bodies. When I look at them, I see aspects of my teenage self and my adult self. My traits ring through in both — obsessiveness, zest for life, indomitable free spirit, my insecurities….oh yes!\n\nWhat is something you had to cut from your book that you wish you could have kept?\n\nI am not sure about the book but there is plenty I have to cut from the screenplay…like the whole flamenco dance class scene.\n\nWhat is a favorite compliment you have received on your writing?\n\nReaders tell me that they can totally identify with my characters even if they are from a different culture. This makes me happy 😊\n\nAlso Chanticleer Reviews said: “This book will have you laughing out loud. It will keep you reading into the night to see what life has in store for these lovable characters who leap off the page and capture your heart and your imagination. Reenita Malhotra Hora’s novel, Operation Mom: My Plan to Get My Mom a Life and a Man, is a highly recommended and delightful five-star read.”\n\nThis made me happy too 😊\n\nWhich authors inspired you to write?\n\nOh goodness! So many!\n\nAs a child – Enid Blyton. Not the choice of children’s author for anyone who has been a child since I became an adult!\n\nAs a child and an adult – Lewis Carrol, Gerald Durrell, Eric Segal\n\nAs an adult – David Sedaris, Nora Ephron, Andrew Ross Sorkin.Walter Isaacson, and of course the inimitable JK Rowling.\n\nIf you could go back in time, where would you go?\n\n1980s. Bombay to relive my teens and London to see George Michael 😊\n\nWhat song is currently playing on a loop in your head?\n\nDuran Duran’s – Wild Boys. I just saw them in concert, that’s why.\n\nWho was your childhood celebrity crush?\n\nGeorge Michael of course!!!!\n\nWhat is your next project?\n\nOof, which one?! As far as books and stories go, I would say Shadow Realm – Part 1 & 2 of the Arya Chronicles series. This is a YA fantasy fiction story. Part 1 is already out as an audio series which you can check out here: www.thearyachronicles.com/podcast. We are currently in production for Season 2 which will launch in Spring 2023. The print book version of Shadow Realm will be next as far as books go, followed hopefully soon thereafter by a graphic novel.\n\nI also have a historical fiction novel in the works – Playtime at the Bagh and Ace of Blades, the “Succession-like” memoirs of my later father, RK.Malhotra, the dynamic creator of India’s home-grown shaving products industry.\n\nOperation Mom: My Plan to Get My Mom a Life… and a Man is available at\n\nAuthor Bio:\n\nReenita Malhotra Hora is a founder, executive-level content, operations & marketing leader, and prolific writer.

Get your e-copy here before 28 Feb 2021, and enjoy!\n\n~ FlorenceT Title: Sugar and Snails\n\nAuthor: Anne Goodwin\n\nPublishers: Inspired Quill (23 July 2015)\n\nFormat: Paperback\n\nISBN-10: 1908600470\n\nISBN-13: 978-1908600479\n\nWebsite: http://annegoodwin.weebly.com/\n\nTwitter: @annecdotist\n\nPages: 342\n\nGenre: Contemporary Fiction, LGBT\n\nWhat’s it about?\n\nThis is a story of a woman’s journey of self-discovery.\n\nI am introduced to Diana through the narrative of the life she’s lived, so far filled with insecurities and fears. The story begins in the present day with a confronting scene of Diana self-harming as a result of, so it seems, her partner leaving. The vivid description of her bringing a knife to her arm, after many years of abstinence, caused me to put the book down and almost not returning to it. But I did, because I wanted to know more.\n\nWhat happened in Cairo? Why is it significant? What is she hiding? Why? What? How? So many more questions asked as I followed Diana Dodsworth’s life journey…from a young kid to a professor of psychology at university. Diana’s story weaves in and out of different pasts as she held the attention of the reader, slowly and steadily divulging the story of her life. Goodwin has written real characters, not just in Diana but with each of the significant figures in Diana’s life – flawed, conflicted. As the reader, I can empathise with each of them. What are the motivations for parental love? How is one changed by childhood events? Is an adolescent capable of deciding her future? What is the value of friendship and love in shaping a life?\n\nAs a therapist, I would have loved to get greater insights and explore Diana’s psyche as she slowly comes to the realisation that she has held herself back and living in a time bubble, and that she is indeed alright. Not that it is indeed the case, or is it? I appreciate a psychological study however may not be everyone’s cup of tea. This said, my reading experience was not compromised in any way. There is enough to maintain my attention and interest. After a somewhat slow and for me, perplexing take by Goodwin in ‘jumping’ across time and events, the second half of the book provides resolutions which showed Goodwin’s skill in weaving all the threads into a coherent tapestry.\n\nGoodwin has created an intriguing story of a person’s life, complex and filled with the confusions of a child, the pain of existence, of irrevocable decisions and the effects on the subsequent decades of her life.\n\nWould I recommend it?\n\nAbsolutely. Mesmerising, especially the second half of the book, thought-provoking and sensitively written. If you enjoy reading real and flawed characters set in a contemporary background with controversial issues (still!) to boot, this is the book for you (and your book club, if you belong to one).\n\nRatings:\n\nRealistic Characterization: 3.5/5\n\nMade Me Think: 4/5\n\nOverall enjoyment: 4/5\n\nReadability: 4/5\n\nRecommended: 4/5\n\nOverall Rating: 4/5\n\nBuy it at:\n\nAmazon Kindle USD 4.31 Paperback USD 12.99 Booktopia Paperback AUD 38.95 Bookdepository Paperback €15.47\n\n– FlorenceT @FTThum MeaningsAndMusings © 2015 LitWorldInterviews\n\nThe Wager: A Romantic Comedy as Christian Allegory #bookreview\n\nTitle: The Wager: A Romantic Comedy By Christian Allegor y\n\nAuthor: Mike Brister\n\nPrint Length: 284\n\nPublisher: Michael E. Brister\n\nPublication Date: August 9, 2016\n\nSold by Amazon Digital Services LLC\n\nLanguage: English\n\nFormats: Kindle, Paperback\n\nGoodreads\n\nGenres: Christian Fiction, Romance, Comedy\n\nThe Wager is written as a cross between a romance novel and a play. We meet two very distinct characters and we quickly fall in love with them. Sarah Dumont is a famous actress, rich, grew up in a prominent family as the oldest child. Because of her status, she is driven, focused, and pretty much snotty. Matt Shepard is not rich, who was the youngest child growing up on a farm. Matt is working hard at putting pieces of his life back together, friendly and sly.\n\nThe two meet based on a wager: Sarah is challenged that she wouldn’t be able to earn Matt’s attention. Sarah’s first intention was to have him make furniture for her in LA. Then when the wager is made, I felt like something was missing within the story line. Sarah wants furniture, then the woman tells her Matt wouldn’t meet with her no matter. From there, it seems Sarah’s immediately offended being told she wouldn’t be able to get Matt out on a date. I felt I needed something more to explain.\n\nWhen they finally do meet, from there on, the two personalities clash and are full of hilarious banter. You can’t help but love them. I also love the use of Doodle, Matt’s dog, in the story. It only made me love Matt all the more. I found him to be very charismatic and charming.\n\nThe writing style flowed nicely. The only thing I wasn’t too fond of was that the narrative repeated pieces of the dialogue and vice versa. Having to read too much repetition made me skim more than I’d like. However, it was easy to get the feel of the southern accent. Whether you’re Midwestern, southern, northern or from Mars, readers will find themselves slipping into a southern accent.\n\nSometimes it was difficult for me to gather the feelings of the characters but I think it’s really up to the reader. After reading parts of the scene, I would go back and reread in order for me to get the sense of how they felt during the incident. I feel this is primarily due to the fact that it’s more of a play (or movie/TV script).\n\nRegardless of the few “negatives,” I thoroughly enjoyed the read. It had humor, it had tears, it had love, and of course, a hidden moral to the story.\n\nOverall Rating: 4 out of 5 stars\n\nFor more reviews, visit: Angela Kay’s Book Reviews\n\nBiography\n\nMike Brister was born in Jackson, Mississippi, in 1952. His father worked for the Illinois Central Railroad and in 1955 was transferred to New Orleans, Louisiana. This began a lifelong relationship with one of the most unique cities in the world. Eventually, the family would return to Jackson.\n\nMike received degrees in mathematics and spent his working career as a consulting actuary. Now retired, he has written his first novel. He has made numerous trips to Haiti and plans more.

The storyline was engrossing, the characters extremely well-developed, the dialogue superb…well, Poet of the Wrong Generation is a book you have to read when you have no pressing matters to attend to because it’s that hard to put down.\n\nWe open with a prologue to the present. Johnny Elias is staring into a photograph taking himself back into a time when life was good and carefree. He was in love, had friends, he had happiness. And now, because of the things happened since then, he’s feeling regret. Don’t we all when we start feeling that nostalgia?\n\nAfter we’re through we the prologue, the next time we see Johnny is back in time in 1991. He joins Megan Price, the girl he loves, and their friends at a concert in Central Park. However, soon after, everything changes. Feeling heartbroken and betrayed, he begins doing what a lot of real people do in these kinds of situations: a writes down his feelings. But these aren’t just words. They’re magical poetry from the heart. Johnny ends up turning his writing to music and falls into success and fame.\n\nThis was a truly amazing novel. I can see it becoming a summer series or even a mini-series on the Hallmark channel. But at the same time, perhaps they better not touch this story. After all, bringing stories to live, especially on network television, it just may ruin this beautiful creation of Lonnie Ostrow’s.\n\nIf you want a book complete with twists and turns, pick up Poet of the Wrong Generation. If you want a book with star-crossed lovers, pick up Poet of the Wrong Generation. If you want a book that tugs at your heartstrings in every way, pick up Poet of the Wrong Generation. It’s well worth the time it takes to read. I highly recommend this pleasure of a book.\n\nOverall Rate: 5 out of 5 stars\n\nBiography\n\nLonnie Ostrow has been an innovator, storyteller, promoter and celebrity-insider for more than two decades.
