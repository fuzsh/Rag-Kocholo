Contributor to periodicals, including Transit, Washington Post Book World, and Writer's Digest.\n\nSIDELIGHTS: John Betancourt is a prolific writer and editor of horror, fantasy, and science-fiction volumes. He has collaborated with Byron Preiss on a number of projects, including anthologies about zombies, aliens, and dragons, and The Ultimate Witch, an anthology of stories about witchcraft in different styles. A Publishers Weekly reviewer commented that the collection's \"best stories deal with contemporary witchcraft and mystical experiences.\"\n\nBetancourt worked with Roger Fulton to create The Sci-Fi Channel Encyclopedia of TV Science Fiction. This book is hailed as \"one of the most comprehensive sources\" of information on genre television programs by John Doherty, a reviewer for Booklist. Beginning with the early days of television, the book moves through the years to the mid-1990s, giving general information about science-fiction programs as well as episode titles and details. Fantasies and time-travel series, as well as comedies with science fiction or fantasy elements, are also included in the listings. A Booklist reviewer found it somewhat lacking in detail but noted: \"Its strength is its broad coverage.\"\n\nThe author also wrote prequel material to the \"Amber\" series, written by the late Roger Zelazny. Zelazny's series featured rugged warriors, Corwin and Merlin, who live in a world filled with magic. Betancourt's Roger Zelazny's The Dawn of Amber told the story of their father, a warrior who discovers his magical origins. A Publishers Weekly reviewer recommended the book, saying, \"The narrative may lack the sparkling wit of its predecessors, but the cliffhanger ending should leave the faithful hungry for the next installment.\"\n\nBetancourt told CA: \"I spent my childhood summers in remote parts of Greece. Reading to escape the boredom became an integral part of my life. When I ran out of stories, I made up my own to keep myself entertained. I can trace the impulse to become a writer to age fourteen, when I spent most of a summer writing sequels to classics like Treasure Island.\n\n\"In high school I discovered editing. While in college I found a part-time job as an assistant editor with the science fiction magazine Amazing Stories. After graduation I revived the famous pulp horror magazine Weird Tales with Darrell Schweitzer and George Scithers. I was then hired away by Byron Preiss Visual Publications to edit a growing list of science fiction books. Today I also develop science fiction, fantasy, and horror books and interactive games for CD-ROM.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nperiodicals\n\nAnalog Science Fiction & Fact, March, 2003, Tom Easton, review of Roger Zelazny's The Dawn of Amber, p. 136.\n\nBooklist, March 15, 1999, review of The Sci-Fi Channel Encyclopedia of TV Science Fiction, p. 1358; April 15, 2000, John Doherty, review of The Sci-Fi Channel Encyclopedia of TV Science Fiction, p. 1574.\n\nLibrary Journal, September 15, 2002, Jackie Cassada, review of Roger Zelazny's The Dawn of Amber, p. 96.\n\nPublishers Weekly, September 13, 1993, p. 123; April 1, 2002, Michael Levy, interview with John Betancourt, p. 58; September 9, 2002, review of Roger Zelzany's The Dawn of Amber, p. 47."
