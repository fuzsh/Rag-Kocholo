Now her millionaire boyfriend has whisked her to a New Zealand island to recover. There she plans a performance of an aria written just for her-- by her secret young lover, who, along with a bevy of envious celebrities, is also on the island. It's the perfect set-up for grand opera-- wild passions...and bloody murder. And when the great singer is found dead, a photo on her bosom, Superintendent Roderick Alleyn must find out who did the diva in...\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nRead in the hardcover omnibus \"Ngaio Marsh: 5 Complete Novels\"\n\nOnce again Marsh takes us to New Zealand, this time with Alleyn accompanying Troy on a commission to paint a famous soprano (with of course some commission of his own from the Chief Commissioner!). I liked the setting and I am always glad when Troy is involved but for some reason this late entry in the series seemed to lack some of the spark that her earlier books had.

G. Wodehouse's comic genius are legion, and their devotion to his masterful command of the hilarity borders on an obsession.\n\nIn Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit, Bertie is in it up to his neck when a perfectly harmless visit to Aunt Dahlia at Brinkley Court finds him engaged and beleaguered on all sides, and only Jeeves can save the day. It was Bertie Wooster's opinion that the moustache he had recently allowed to sprout from his upper lip did something for him. Nor was he alone in this view; the moustache had other supporters among his circle of friends and no less an authority than Florence Craye had signified her approval of it. But there were some equally outspoken warriors in the opposing camp. Jeeves did not approve of the new growth and expressed himself in such terms that some feeling of coolness between him and Bertram could not fail to result. Then the thunder-clouds began to gather from another direction and Wooster thought to face the impending crisis alone. But not so, Jeeves; he was not the man to allow a domestic tiff to come between him and the common enemy. The feudal spirit burned bright within him and he rallied to his master's cause as resourcefully and imperturbably as ever before. Jeeves and the Feudal Spirit is a novel in which Jeeves and Bertie Wooster return to the Wodehouse scene at the very top of their form.\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nJuly 2020 reread:\n\nClassic Wodehouse zaniness. As I mentioned in my 2017 review (of the audiobook edition), it was fun having Spode reappear (especially having recently having revisited \"The Code of the Woosters\" in which he had previously appeared).\n\n14leslie.98\n\nModifié : Juil 23, 2020, 9:40 pm\n\n229.

His wife, Jenny, is in intensive care. At first, Scorcher thinks itʼs going to be an easy solve, but too many small things canʼt be explained: the half-dozen baby monitors pointed at holes smashed in the Spainsʼ walls, the files erased from the familyʼs computer, the story Jenny told her sister about a shadowy intruder slipping past the houseʼs locks. And this neighborhood—once called Broken Harbor—holds memories for Scorcher and his troubled sister, Dina: childhood memories that Scorcher thought he had tightly under control.\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nA bit darker story than I prefer but well written and compelling.\n\nI have been finding that my tolerance of noir has been decreasing. I guess that I have decided that there isn't a lot of point to experiencing that pain and gruesomeness if I don't have to & what I really like about mysteries is the puzzle & the feeling that good triumphs over evil.

MDI in general & Seal Harbor in particular was the place where many wealthy families spent the summer (the Rockerfeller family had a couple of places owned by different branches of the family; the Fords also had a \"cottage\" nearby - in later years it was purchased by Martha Stewart).

A Grub Street printer, his family, and two apprentices brutally murdered in their sleep. A locked building. And at the scene, a raving mad poet brandishing a bloody axe. Surely the culprit had been found, and justice would be swift and severe.\n\nBut to Sir John Fielding, justice was more than finding a culprit-it was finding the truth. Aided by thirteen-year-old Jeremy Proctor, Fielding decided to investigate further. And the truth behind the Grub Street massacre was more evil-and more deadly-than the dastardly crime itself.\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\n2020 reread:\n\nThis second book in the Sir John Fielding series has more thrills than the first book but it is still a mystery (rather than a thriller or suspense story). Even having read this before, I enjoyed watching events unfold and the historical fiction is excellent.\n\nDespite the gruesome nature of the killings, this book doesn't strike me as dark. The emphasis is on the investigation of the case and on the daily life of Jeremy Proctor in Sir John's household.\n\n23leslie.98\n\nJuil 23, 2020, 9:53 pm\n\n231. Death of a Cad by M.C.

Yet his affairs of the heart will have to wait. Vile, boorish Captain Bartlett, one of the guests at Priscilla's engagement party, has just been found murdered-shot while on a grouse hunt. Now with many titled party guests as the prime suspects, each with a reason for snuffing out the despicable captain, Hamish must smooth ruffled feathers as he investigates the case. When the hidden culprit strikes again, Hamish will find himself trying to save Priscilla from a miserable marriage-and catch a killer before he flies the coop.\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nI thought that this 2nd book in the Hamish Macbeth series was an improvement over the first book. However, the culprit was obvious to me long before Hamish figured it out & the trope of the incompetent superior officer was beginning to wear thin.\n\nI might have enjoyed this a bit more if there had been a bigger gap between reading the first book & this one, but unfortunately, my library audiobook was an omnibus edition with both of them. I just couldn't return it without listening to both books! I will probably return to this series again but not for a while.\n\n24leslie.98\n\nJuil 24, 2020, 7:20 pm\n\n232.

Cadfael hurries to the man’s bedside, only to be confronted with two surprises: In Master Bonel’s wife, the good monk recognizes Richildis, whom he loved before he took his vows—and Master Bonel has been fatally poisoned by monk’s-hood oil from Cadfael’s stores.\n\nThe sheriff is convinced that the murderer is Richildis’s son, Edwin, who hated his stepfather. But Cadfael, guided in part by his concern for a woman to whom he was once betrothed, is certain of her son’s innocence. Using his knowledge of both herbs and the human heart, Cadfael deciphers a deadly recipe for murder.\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nHonestly, I cannot say whether this is a reread or not. I recalled the basics of the plot from seeing the TV adaptation (with Derek Jacobi) but even knowing the solution to the mystery, this book was enjoyable to read. Peters did a masterful job of conveying life in 1100s England & Wales and Cadfael is a wonderful protagonist.\n\n25leslie.98\n\nModifié : Juil 25, 2020, 8:55 pm\n\n233.

But what of her old life? Will she ever see her home or her parents again? And if she does, will she still be the same girl?\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nGreat book!

His novels are both heartbreaking and comic; his limning of a colonial Brazil in flux is both perceptive and remarkably modern. The Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas is written as an autobiography, a chronicle of the erotic misadventures of its narrator, Brás Cubas--who happens to be dead. In pursuit of love and progeny, Cubas rejects the women who want him and aspires to the ones who reject him. In the end, he dies unloved and without heirs, yet he somehow manages to turn this bitter pill into a victory of sorts. What makes Memoirs stand up 100 years after the book was written is Machado's biting humor, brilliant prose, and profound understanding of all the vagaries of human behavior.\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nI wish I had read that Oxford University Press edition! You'll see why below.\n\nI should just face up to the fact that I just don't get South American literature. Each time I try, I end up feeling like there is some hidden meaning that I am not understanding :(\n\nOf course, my difficulty in understanding the point was increased in this instance by the poor translation I had (book downloaded from http://ebook.visitbrasil.com/detalhe.html?idbook=7); my complaint is ungracious as the book was free but I would advise anyone thinking of reading this book in English to seek out a better translator. For example, there were several instances when a woman was referred to as \"he\" rather than \"she\" - could be a typo, I suppose, but there were also some strange word choices.\n\nHaving voiced my complaints, I will say that I didn't find the book dull though I did have to read it in small doses.

The play differs from other farces at the time by employing dynamic characters like Alceste and Célimène as opposed to the traditionally flat characters used by most satirists to criticize problems in society. It also differs from most of Molière's other works by focusing more on character development and nuances than on plot progression. The play, though not a commercial success in its time, survives as Molière's best-known work today. Much of its universal appeal is due to common undercurrents of misanthropy across cultural borders.\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nThis play is full of humorous word-play so make sure that you have a good translation; in my opinion the Richard Wilbur translation is the best one. The L.A. Theatre Works full cast production was excellent.

As Gamadge discovers, the household includes an aging actress with ties to a spiritualist sect and a shy beauty with a shady fiancé.\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nThis 3rd book in the Henry Gamadge series is the first to take place in Henry's home city of New York. Though his logic in the final summing up was obvious (once I read it), I had not managed to figure it out for myself despite there being no \"hidden\" clues or specialist knowledge that gave Henry any advantage. And there were some interesting possible developments in his personal life...\n\nI am adding this series to the ones I am 'working' on.\n\n39leslie.98\n\nModifié : Août 6, 2020, 4:26 pm\n\nJuly summary: 43 books read, 20 of which were ROOTs, and 8 new books acquired.\n\nBest books of the month:\n\n*Of Mice and Men & *The Code of the Woosters {rereads} - both 5*\n\nThe Butler Did It (aka \"Something Fishy\") & The Constant Wife {new-to-me} - both 4.5*\n\n4 new-to-me books read from the Guardian's list, 1 of them from Balzac's Human Comedy.\n\nAnd I also read the worst book of the year (at least so far!) in July - Just Add Salt by Jinx Schwartz (1.5*).

And so I come to the end of all the Nero Wolfe books written by Stout. Should I proceed to sample those Nero Wolfe books written by Robert Goldsborough?? Goldsborough's first Nero Wolfe book came out in 1986, just a year after this one, and he is still writing them (the most recent was published earlier this year) so they can't be terrible but I have a prejudice against authors taking over another (deceased) author's characters.\n\n44leslie.98\n\nAoût 6, 2020, 4:00 pm\n\n248.

This charming early novel by P. G. Wodehouse plays a series of witty variations on the standard school story of the period, balancing the minor heroics of the action against a humorously ironic commentary. The simple tale is given sparkle by vivid character drawing and the author's sharp ear for schoolboy dialogue.\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nDespite my ignorance involving sports (what is the English sport \"Fives\"? is it handball?), once I got into this 'School Story' I really enjoyed it. It wasn't as humorous as many of his novels but instead was a good coming of age story from the early years of the 20th century.\n\n45leslie.98\n\nModifié : Août 6, 2020, 4:12 pm\n\n249.

Two crimes are solved and two romances emerge.\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nWhile I enjoyed (both) the stories, it felt a little bit like the author didn't have enough material for a full novel so padded it out by including the book within a book.

The resulting public outcry led directly to the US government enacting changes in food and workplace safety practices still in place today.\n\nWith food production, business ethics, and immigration back in the news, Academy Award nominee Casey Affleck (Gone Baby Gone) taps into the emotion behind these issues to breathe life back into the struggling inhabitants of Packingtown. Affleck, a committed vegan and animal rights spokesman, delivers a moving performance that connects with the book’s enduring legacy.\n\nThe Jungle revolves around the life and family of Jurgis Rudkus, a Lithuanian immigrant whose dreams of a better life are crushed by punishing work in gruesome stockyards and an unforgiving city. Brilliantly written and vividly described, it provides a poignant and incredibly detailed snapshot of a striking point in American history.\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nI read this book in high school and recalled it as powerful and upsetting. This reread confirmed that recollection! The horrors of work in Chicago stockyards/meat packing industry in the early years of the 20th century were enough to turn my stomach as well as wrench my heart. Books like this one & Dos Passos's U.S.A. trilogy make it clear why socialism and anarchy were growing movements at that time along with labor unionism.

But he left behind the organization and his partners-in-crime, and Inspector Chen is charged to uncover those responsible and act as necessary to end the corruption ring. In a twisting case that takes him from Shanghai, all the way to the U.S., reuniting him with his previous cohort from the U.S. Marshall's service—Inspector Catherine Rhon.\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nI really like Chen Cao. In this 4th entry in the series, Chen is asked to work on a case of corruption with connections very high up in the government. The realities of both the difficulties in investigating and the likelihood that most of the high ranking officials involved will end up getting away with it, though well portrayed, were depressing.\n\nI did like the fact that Chen met up with U.S. Marshal Catherine Rhon once again during his visit to the U.S..

The contest and a classic-car parade are new to the festivities and draw a spate of outsiders with deep pockets, big-city egos and, in the case of a young Englishman, an intriguing story. It’s the tale of a Bugatti Type 57C, lost somewhere in France during World War II. Among the most beautiful cars ever made, one of only four of its kind—Ralph Lauren owns one—it is worth millions and drives its pursuers mad with greed. In the midst of the festivities, a local scholar turns up dead and Bruno suspects unnatural causes. After a second death, there is mounting evidence that the events in St. Denis are linked to international crime.\n\nTo make matters even more complicated, a family squabble over land brings to St. Denis a comely Parisienne who turns Bruno’s head. As usual, Bruno’s life offers its challenges—but there is always time for a good bottle and a home-cooked meal.\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nI liked this 9th book in the Bruno Courrèges series but it would be nice if the Brigadier and/or Isabelle were not involved in one of these books.

To his pursuers, Kelly is nothing but a monstrous criminal, a thief and a murderer. To his own people, the lowly class of ordinary Australians, the bushranger is a hero, defying the authority of the English to direct their lives. Indentured by his bootlegger mother to a famous horse thief (who was also her lover), Ned saw his first prison cell at 15 and by the age of 26 had become the most wanted man in the wild colony of Victoria, taking over whole towns and defying the law until he was finally captured and hanged. Here is a classic outlaw tale, made alive by the skill of a great novelist.\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nI liked this novel much more than the only other Carey book I have read - Oscar and Lucinda.

I can see it as a snapshot of a section of American life in the post-WW2 years but I couldn't really admire Sal or Dean in their irresponsible behavior...\n\n67leslie.98\n\nModifié : Août 23, 2020, 2:12 pm\n\n262. One Fine Day the Rabbi Bought a Cross by Harry Kemelman (1987)\n\nKindle book (Amazon Prime lending library); 234 pgs; finished 8/23; 3.5*\n\nMystery\n\nMysteryKIT August: International (Israel)\n\nAlphaKIT August: O & H\n\nFrom the book blurb:\n\n\"Retired millionaire Barney Berkowitz, from the small Massachusetts town of Barnard’s Crossing, invites Rabbi David Small to come to Israel and bar mitzvah him, as Berkowitz never went through the ceremony in his youth. On what should be a joyous occasion—and an all-expenses-paid trip to the Holy Land—the rabbi discovers danger lurking in every corner and a conspiracy that threatens to destroy the state of Israel.\n\nAn innocent American has been murdered and when the sleuthing rabbi begins his investigation, he finds the death may have been part of an international conspiracy fueled by religious radicals and an arms-smuggling scheme. Anyone, from a liberal Jewish-American professor to a young religious fundamentalist, could be a suspect—and the rabbi must rely on his Talmudic logic and daring chutzpah to untangle the mystery and prevent an even more deadly attack.\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nWell, that is a terrible blurb! It contains errors & presents other facts in a way that is misleading...\n\nI enjoyed this 10th book in the Rabbi Small series, which was no surprise as I have liked all the other ones I have read. However, I felt that in this case the reader learns far more about what is going on than Rabbi Small ever does which made the elucidation of the mystery & Small's part in it less prominent than in the earlier (and to my mind, better) books.\n\n68leslie.98\n\nModifié : Août 24, 2020, 6:16 pm\n\n263. *Melmoth Reconciled by Honoré de Balzac (1835) , translated by Ellen Marriage\n\nKindle book (Project Gutenberg); 53 pgs; finished 8/23; 4*\n\nGuardian's list\n\nBook #4 of Philosophical Studies from The Human Comedy (based upon Project Gutenberg's arrangement)\n\nFrom the book blurb:\n\n\"Honoré de Balzac is considered the founder of social realism. Balzac was the first writer to write about all social levels of the social scene in France. His vast collection of works encompasses the Restoration period and the July Monarchy. La Comedie Humaine was written between 1799 and 1850. This collection contains 95 novels, stories, and essays. Melmoth Reconciled, written in 1835, is part of the Philosophical Studies (Études philosophiques) section of La Comedie Humaine.\n\nWherefore, that race of corsairs whom we dignify with the title of bankers, the gentry who take out a license for which they pay a thousand crowns, as the privateer takes out his letters of marque, hold these rare products of the incubations of virtue in such esteem that they confine them in cages in their counting-houses, much as governments procure and maintain specimens of strange beasts.\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nThis novella from the Human Comedy is best read by those who have already read Maturin's Melmoth the Wanderer (as might be expected from the title). I enjoyed Balzac's ironical discourse about cashiers which prefaces the plot involving the cashier Castanier much more than the philosophical resolution to Castanier's situation (a bit too pat for me but that section is quite short & not without interest).\n\nI read this in Project Gutenberg's omnibus \"The Works of Balzac\"; this novella was translated by Ellen Marriage.\n\n69leslie.98\n\nAoût 25, 2020, 11:03 am\n\n264.

Not to be missed are \"The Incredible Elopement of Peter Wimsey\" (with a lovely American woman-turned-zombie) and eight more puzzlers penned in inimitable style by the mistress of murder.\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nThis collection of short stories contains:\n\nLord Peter Wimsey stories:\n\n\"The Image in the Mirror\"\n\n\"The Incredible Elopement of Lord Peter Wimsey\"\n\n\"The Queen's Square\"\n\n\"The Necklace of Pearls\"\n\nMontague Egg stories:\n\n\"The Poisoned Dow '08\"\n\n\"Sleuths on the Scent\"\n\n\"Murder in the Morning\"\n\n\"One Too Many\"\n\n\"Murder at Pentecost\"\n\n\"Maher-Shalal-Hashbaz\"\n\nOther stories:\n\n\"The Man Who Knew How\"\n\n\"The Fountain Plays\"\n\nAs much as I enjoyed the Lord Peter stories, in this reread I found that the Montague Egg stories appealed to me most.

They all dream of finding Captain Flint's buried treasure, but it is young Jim Hawkins who finds Flint's map of Treasure Island.

I also read along in some sections in my print copy... Despite my initial hesitation about having a female narrator to a book which is predominantly male in its characters (and being told from the point of view of Jim), Shallenberg did a very good job narrating this book.\n\nI don't remember how old I was when I first read \"Treasure Island\" but it was an instant hit with me & I have reread it several times over the years. So much fun!\n\n-----\n\n2013 review of my audiobook edition narrated by Frederick Davidson:\n\nExcellent adventure story with pirates singing about bottles of rum & a dead man's chest, a one-legged rogue, and a talking parrot - I suspect that this book is responsible for all the pirate stereotypes I grew up with!\n\nFrederick Davidson did a good job narrating, but I found his voices for a few of the characters didn't feel quite right to me.

He has devised a plan to cripple the American greatness, humble the US military, and elevate Japan to a position of dominance on the world stage.\n\nYamata's motivation lies in his desire to pay off a 'Debt of Honor' to his parents and to the country he feels is responsible for their deaths—America. All he needs is a catalyst to set his plan in motion.\n\nWhen the faulty gas tank on one Tennessee family's car leads to their fiery death, an opportunistic U. S. congressman uses the occasion to rush a new trade law through the system. The law is designed to squeeze Japan economically. Instead, it provides Yamata with the leverage he needs to put his plan into action.\n\nAs Yamata's plan begins to unfold, it becomes clear to the world that someone is launching a fully-integrated operation against the United States. There's only one man to find out who the culprit is—Jack Ryan, the new President's National Security Advisor.\"\n\n276.

Now he (Jack Ryan) must rebuild a government, comfort a grieving nation, and become a true leader. Meanwhile, he is surrounded by enemies --- both inside the White House and around the world --- all of them plotting to destroy an untested President. And bring an already wounded country to its knees ...\"\n\n277. The Bear and the Dragon by Tom Clancy (2001) {reread}\n\nPaperback (MOB); 1137 pgs; finished 9/19; 5*\n\nBased on the book blurb: (spoilers in original blurb hidden at my discretion)\n\n\"In The Bear and the Dragon, the future is very near at hand indeed.\n\nNewly elected in his own right, Jack Ryan has found that being President has gotten no easier: domestic pitfalls await him (Jack Ryan) at every turn; there's a revolution in Liberia; the Asian economy is going down the tubes; and now, in Moscow, someone may have tried to take out the chairman of the SVR--the former KGB--with a rocket-propelled grenade. Things are unstable enough in Russia without high-level assassination, but even more disturbing may be the identities of the potential assassins. Were they political enemies, the Russian Mafia, or disaffected former KGB? Or, Ryan wonders, is something far more dangerous at work here?\n\nRyan is right. For even while he dispatches his most trusted eyes and ears, including black ops specialist John Clark, to find out the truth of the matter, forces in China are moving ahead with a plan of truly audacious proportions. If they succeed, the world as we know it will never look the same. If they fail...the consequences will be unspeakable.\n\nBlending the exceptional realism and authenticity that are his hallmarks with intricate plotting, razor-sharp suspense, and a remarkable cast of characters, this is Clancy at his best--and there is none better.\"\n\nWhile I don't actually agree with Clancy's political views, I find his books compelling reading & find the ultimate triumph of American military & intelligence in the books satisfying - perhaps I have a hidden conservative \"hawk\" in my psyche that I only let out when I read these books?

Bertie the immensely talented six year old is now enrolled in kindergarten, and much to his dismay, has been clad in pink overalls for his first day of class.

Pat is embarking on a new life at Edinburgh University and perhaps on a new relationship, courtesy of Domenica, her witty and worldly-wise neighbor. McCall Smith has much in store for them as the brief spell of glorious summer sunshine gives way to fall a season cursed with more traditionally Scottish weather.\n\nFull of McCall Smith’s gentle humor and sympathy for his characters, Espresso Tales is also an affectionate portrait of a city and its people who, in the author’s own words, “make it one of the most vibrant and interesting places in the world.” \"\n\n93leslie.98\n\nSep 27, 2020, 10:42 pm\n\n279.

It’s all nothing more than a spooky game, until the woman’s sister is strangled while Clara sits in a chair by her bed. The only clue: Clara’s panicked memory of a woman in a sunbonnet standing at the door. Happily, Henry Gamadge arrives in time to calm his wife and solve the mystery (though not without some stellar help from Clara!).\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nThis entry in the Henry Gamadge series was interesting in that his wife Clara was the main character for the first section while Henry is away doing some secret war work.

Normal People by Sally Rooney (2018)\n\nKindle book (C/W Mars); 268 pgs; finished 9/29; 2*\n\nGroup read over at Goodreads\n\nFrom the book blurb:\n\n\"Connell Waldron is one of the most popular boys in his small-town high school--he is a star of the football team and an excellent student, and he is never wanting for attention from girls. The one thing he doesn't have is money. Marianne Sheridan, a classmate of Connell's, has the opposite problem. Marianne is plain-looking, odd, and stubborn, and while her family is quite well off, she has no friends to speak of. There is, however, a deep and undeniable connection between the two teenagers, one that develops into a secret relationship.\n\nEverything changes when both Connell and Marianne are accepted to Trinity College. Suddenly Marianne is well liked and elegant, holding court with her intellectual friends, while Connell hangs at the sidelines, not quite as fluent in the language of the elite. Throughout their years at university, Marianne and Connell circle each other, falling in and out of romance but never straying far from where they started. And as Marianne experiments with an increasingly dangerous string of boyfriends, Connell must decide how far he is willing to go to save his oldest friend.\n\nSally Rooney brings her brilliant psychological acuity and perfectly spare prose to a novel that explores the subtleties of class, the electricity of first love, and the inescapable challenges of family and friendships. Normal People is a book that you will read in one sitting, and then immediately jump up to share with your friends.\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nThe publishers' prediction that I would read this book in one sitting was woefully off base in my case. I really didn't care for the writing style of this book. Unfortunately, the plot didn't wow me either. Neither Connell or Marianne appealed to me, though I did feel that their emotional reactions to their situations came across as believable.

Earth scientist Rocannon is on that world, and he sees his friends murdered and his spaceship destroyed. Marooned among alien peoples, he leads the battle to free this new world - and finds that legends grow around him even as he fights.\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nWhile I enjoyed the story, I found the sociological or ethnographic sections both hard to follow in audiobook format and dull. Sadly for me, the book opens with one of these sections so I started off with a bad impression...\n\n101leslie.98\n\nOct 9, 2020, 2:11 pm\n\n285.

All of the key people in Boychuk’s life – family, friends, enemies – are there. Boychuk steps up to the podium to make a speech, takes a sip of water, and drops dead. Joanne Kilbourn, in her début as Canada’s leading amateur sleuth, is soon on the case, delving into Boychuk’s history. What she finds are a Bible college that’s too good to be true, a woman with a horrifying and secret past, and a murderer who’s about to strike again.\"\n\nMy thoughts:\n\nWell done but because it is set in the world of politics, of which I have enough in real life at the moment, I only gave it 3.5*...
