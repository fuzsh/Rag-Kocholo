        "text": "You can’t truly call yourself a nerd unless you’re into sci-fi, and I certainly am, and was from a very early age. I can’t quite recall what first piqued my interest, though I would probably have to point to the re-runs of shows like Star Trek and Doctor Who on telly, as well as the far-ahead-of-its-time comic 2000 AD as influences. The whole idea of faraway worlds, alien beings, adventurers boldly going where not very many had gone before always appealed to me. Planets with strange names, sleek and deadly spaceships, futuristic settings and sexy alien girls (the latter of which I would have become more interested in as I grew a little older), to say nothing of a small interest in actual science and astronomy, all helped to push me towards that particular genre.\n\nAnd then, perhaps inevitably, I got into fantasy fiction. I’m fairly sure my first experience of this was the grand-daddy of them all, that classic The Lord of the Rings, but it may have been slightly pre-empted by one of Michael Moorcock’s books, Stormbringer. If not, I read the two of them very close to one another. It was probably a good time to be getting into science-fiction, as the seventies (which was when I grew up) was a time when sci-fi was finally beginning to break out of the restricted audience it had been forced into by adults (\"strictly for kids\") with the likes of Flash Gordon and later Lost in Space, as shows like Star Trek, The Tomorrow People, Planet of the Apes, Logan’s Run and of course Dr. Who all showed that science-fiction could be enjoyed by adults.\n\nYeah, that’s nowhere near true. Most of them were still considered kid’s shows, and few if any were watched by adults. Star Trek was the one to break the mould, attracting not only adult viewers but educated ones - scientists, philosophers, lecturers and engineers among them - who watched the show and then praised it for its realism, its attention to detail, its tackling of real-world issues. Certainly, Star Trek was, if not the first sci-fi show aimed at an adult audience, the first really successful one. Anthology shows like The Twilight Zone and The Outer Limits had of course interested people of all ages, some of the stories better than others, and whole families might sit down to watch either show, but while these shows did tend to present moral arguments through their stories (one off-the-cuff example being the superb “The Monsters are Due on Maple Street” episode of The Twilight Zone, which not only highlighted the paranoia about communism in America at the time, but also showed how we are all just one step away from reverting to barbarians and turning on each other) they didn’t quite build up the sort of fanatic following that Star Trek did, leading to campaigns for it to be reinstated when it was cancelled after three seasons.\n\nBut sci-fi is not just on the screen, large or small. Now a multi-billion dollar industry, it began of course with the written word and then progressed with the invention of the wireless to the radio waves, in time making its way onto the silver screen and thence to televisions and into the homes of millions of people, accepted by the masses to the point now where science-fiction films can be blockbusters just the same as any action, drama or comedy. Sci-fi did not come of age in the twenty-first century, but it’s certainly well established now, and few would regard it any longer as being “just for kids.”\n\nMuch of this change in attitude is owed to huge movies such as the original Star Wars (now called A New Hope, but I’ll always know it as Star Wars, and god help anyone who calls it Star Wars I!) and, close on its heels, the more “mature” and earth-bound Close Encounters of the Third Kind. As movies like these broke all box-office records it was clear that science-fiction as a genre was something people wanted, and not just the kids. Though completely different, the two films mentioned above do hold one common characteristic, prevalent in just about any sci-fi movie or series: they take us away, out of ourselves, away from the everyday and the mundane, to worlds that we can only dream of, that may exist, now or in the future, and where the problems we face in our humdrum lives either don’t matter, are tackled with new insights, or have been eliminated in a perfect society.\n\nIt’s escapism, and one thing people share is a love of being able to escape the cares and worries of their lives, whether it’s losing themselves in a book, filing into a cinema to watch the latest movie or just vegging out in front of the TV. And nothing helps one escape more than science-fiction.\n\nThough sci-fi does demand a small amount of thought or logic on the part of the reader, viewer or listener, fantasy, on the other hand, really doesn’t. The clue is in the name: in science-fiction everything has to be rooted, at least in part, in workable science. So writers have to work to assure and show us that what they propose could work - doesn’t have to work, but it could. Ships can’t generally just fly through space powered by love, for example, and if a planet’s atmosphere is not breathable by humans, then taking off one’s helmet is going to result in a nasty experience. Weapons need to follow the laws of physics, as do most things, unless you’re going through a black hole, in which case all bets are off. Even so, black holes are said to obey certain characteristics of gravity, and must be seen to do so in any story involving them.\n\nFantasy doesn’t suffer from this restriction. In fantasy, literally anything can happen, and there’s no need for explanations. Logic does not have to apply. Science is usually either completely absent or replaced by one, ahem, magic word, which makes everything in fantasy work: magic. Magic can do everything. It can lift whole cities into the sky without any need to explain how it’s done. It can allow people to live to hundreds of years, ignoring logic and the physiology of man. It can let someone read your thoughts, grow to giant proportions or become a midget, turn objects into people and people into objects, or have the sky be purple or green, just because it is. Fantasy fiction demands the most strenuous suspension of disbelief; anything you can imagine can happen, and you can’t question it. As Lucy Lawless once said on The Simpsons, whenever that happens, a wizard did it. It’s the oldest and most overused get-out-of-jail-free card in the business, and it always works.\n\nSo it stands to reason that fantasy as a genre came first, before such a thing as science, never mind science-fiction, was even thought of. It’s so much easier to write a story when you can just say what you want and your audience or readership will accept that on blind faith, believing you know more about it than they do. Pegasus flies? How? What is the science behind - oh yeah. Right. It’s fantasy. Odysseus meets a Cyclops? How can - oh yeah. Right. Well then, where do these orcs come fr - right.\n\nSome fantasy writers, to be fair, do go and have gone to quite some lengths to explain how things occur in their worlds; some refuse to just go for the “a wizard did it” idea, though many do. Some have even merged science with their fantasy worlds - this is usually, though not always, known as science fantasy - and in the likes of steampunk and other speculative fiction, it’s the past, not the future, that’s the setting for the stories. But more of that as we go on. Right now I guess all we can say is that both science-fiction and fantasy are branches of speculative fiction, though always referred to as one or the other. There are, of course, many sub-genres of each, and we’ll be looking at these in due course.\n\nWhat else will be looking at? Well, there'll be a timeline, as that's how I like to do things, and how it's usually best to approach any sort of history project, but I’ll be veering away from it regularly to check out authors, works, worlds, concepts, movies and TV shows, comic books, anything that takes my fancy and that fits in with either of the two genres. On the timeline, I’ll be looking at the origins of both genres and their development across the centuries - in some cases even longer back - and how each has changed, adapted and managed to keep itself relevant in a world where more and more bright things are sparkling and attracting the short-term attention of this motley collection of atoms we call the human race. We’ll see how sci-fi movies have, in the main, moved away from the deeper, often darker themes favoured by fifties, sixties and seventies examples, where such movies were called cerebral and were pretty much only for the hardcore fan, into a more acceptable, widespread and mainstream area where action, romance and drama - and sometimes even horror - often take precedence over the science, if not the fiction.\n\nHumour, too, seldom in any of the earlier movies or books, has made inroads into sci-fi and fantasy, creating in the case of the latter a new sub-genre - comic fantasy or humorous fantasy - and allowing both genres to stop always taking themselves too seriously, thus opening themselves up to a wider audience. Increased amounts of sex and violence is what the public seem to want, and sci-fi movies and TV shows oblige, constrained as any other media is to provide what is demanded by its audience. Fantasy, to a slightly less degree, though the paintings of Boris Vallejo would suggest otherwise! Fantasy has more embraced the humour aspect than the sexual one, which is not to say both are not in evidence, but as much fantasy is aimed still predominantly at a younger audience - Buffy, Supernatural, Charmed etc - the sex aspect is not only played down, but usually not really welcome. An exception of course is the obvious, and Game of Thrones made its name on the visceral, brutal violence it brought to the small screen, as well as the - mostly gratuitous and in most cases unnecessary - sex. But both sell, and Game of Thrones pushed both hard no pun intended!), making it one of HBO’s biggest ever moneymakers.\n\nQuestion: will I be covering horror in this history? Answer: some. By its very nature, horror can be fantasy. It isn’t always, of course: the stories of Stephen King, Dean Koontz or Peter Straub aren’t always set in a futuristic or fantasy world, and more often than not are rooted in the real world, our world. This isn’t surprising: horror works best when it seems almost normal, everyday, when the guy standing behind us in the supermarket queue could be planning a grisly murder, or be able to see what we’re thinking, or the woman driving the bus is being told by voices in her head to crash it and kill everyone. Fantasy is fantasy, and while we might enjoy it, we don’t believe it can happen. No elves or goblins are going to accost us on the way to Waitrose, no dragon is going to swoop down from the sky over Manchester, and no mysterious bearded old man with a hint of danger about him is going to knock on our door in the dead of the night. These things don’t, generally, happen.\n\nBut much of what is written in horror can, or could. We can believe these stories because they seem real, they seem possible. That sort of horror I will be avoiding, as it has nothing really to do with science-fiction or fantasy, and while it is indeed a third branch of that parent, speculative fiction, it doesn’t really concern us here. But horror crosses over into fantasy a lot - stories about vampires, werewolves, fairies, supernatural beings, or stories set in fantasy lands or times - and also occasionally, though not quite as much, into science-fiction. The movie Event Horizon is a good example of this: is it a horror science-fiction film or a science-fiction horror film? It’s probably both, and the likes of that will certainly be covered, as will The Raven, which takes as its subject matter the idea of Edgar Allen Poe being accused of murder.\n\nSo anywhere that the lines between horror and fantasy - or, less frequently as I said, sci-fi - blur, those examples will be covered. But in the main we’re exploring fantasy and science-fiction here, and this will be the focus of my efforts.\n\nINDEX\n\nSub-Genres of Science Fiction and Fantasy\n\nTimeline of Fantasy: 1800 BC - 1000 AD\n\nTimeline of Fantasy: 1200 - 1900\n\nTimeline of Science Fiction: 1100 BC - 1200 AD\n\nWorlds Apart: New Planets to Explore - Mars\n\nThe Storytellers: John Wyndham\n\nFar Beyond These Castle Walls: The Role of the Castle in Fantasy\n\nIn the Name of the Race - Peopling Fantasy Worlds\n\nNo Time Like the Present. Or Past. Or Future - Time Travel in Science Fiction\n\nIs There Anybody Out There? The Evolution of the Extraterrestrial: From Little Green Men to Big Scary Monsters\n\nStop Dragon My Heart Around: Big Flying Lizards in Fantasy\n\nBefore I get this thing going, it's perhaps incumbent upon me to set out the various sub-genres that exist in both science fiction and fantasy.\n\nAnd here they are.\n\nSUB-GENRES (SCIENCE-FICTION)\n\nI’m not certain if this is an officially approved or accepted list, but this seems to cover most if not all of the sub-genres in science-fiction. This is of course just a very basic introduction to each. Later on, as the thread develops, I’ll be looking more deeply into some of them.\n\nAlien Invasion\n\nSpeaks for itself. Story focuses on an invasion from another world/galaxy, and the struggle to repel the invaders. Classics of this sub-genre would of course be the likes of H.G. Wells’s The War of the Worlds, movies like Independence Day and TV series such as Colony, V and Falling Skies.\n\nAlternate History\n\nAgain, kind of self-explanatory. Concerned with a future (or present, or even in some cases past) where history has developed and unfolded differently to the one we live in. Seismic evens such as, for instance, the Nazis winning World War II or aliens invading the day before 9/11, or maybe Christ being taken away by aliens and not therefore able to rise, leading to the death of the small sect he had started, change the world and make a whole new timeline in which anything can happen. Dinosaurs not dying out 65 million years ago. Atlantis not sinking into the sea. The Cuban Missile crisis leading to nuclear war. Kim Newman’s Anno Dracula novels are a good example here. While strictly more horror and fantasy, they embrace the “alternate history” idea in this sub-genre. Others would be Len Deighton’s reimagining of WW II in SS GB and Philip K. Dick’s The Man in the High Castle.\n\nAlternate Universe\n\nPerhaps similar to Alternate History, this sub-genre is not confined to changes in Earth’s history, and can involve completely different and wildly changed landscapes. In an alternate universe, for instance, oxygen could be poison to the human race, or humans could be born with wings, or the entire planet could be sealed off from the rest of space for some reason. I guess to some extent, if Alternate History poses the question “what if?” then Alternate Universe says “why not?”\n\nApocalyptic/Post-Apocalyptic\n\nStill not too much explanation needed. Apocalyptic fiction concerns a coming disaster - asteroid approaching Earth, massive earthquake, volcano, moon leaving orbit etc - while Post-Apocalyptic, obviously, deals with the events after such an occurrence. There is a degree of crossover between this sub-genre and Dying or Ruined Earth, as well as Dystopian.\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nAny work of science-fiction in which the world is either threatened by, invaded by or run by robots or computers, where humans are seen and dealt with as second-class, and where they have to fight for their survival, either in a war or as a resistance after having been defeated. The most famous example of this is of course the Terminator series of movies.\n\nColonisation\n\nWhere humans move out into the stars, searching for a new home. Such fiction can take place during the voyage to the new planet, or after arrival there. Perhaps to some degree this could be seen as being interchangeable with Alien Invasion fiction, if the “invasion” is written from the point of view of the aliens.\n\nCyberpunk\n\nCoined, I believe, by the man accepted as the father of the sub-genre, cyberpunk concerns a world where the social order has broken down and people tend to seek refuge in computer games, AI environments or technological bodily enhancements. Neuromancer is the touchstone here, and for movies we’re talking both The Matrix and Blade Runner.\n\nDying Earth\n\nSet in the far, far future, at a time when the Earth is literally dying as the sun burns itself out, the laws of time and space have begun to break down and entropy is working its will on the universe. In this sub-genre science and magic mesh, cross over, become indistinguishable from each other, so perhaps in some ways you could say Dying Earth fiction is where science-fiction and fantasy often meet.\n\nDystopian\n\nOne of the most overused and perhaps also misunderstood sub-genres, dystopian fiction concerns dark futures, usually the triumph of evil over good, the beating down of the human spirit and the erosion of human rights. Often set in police states, or even worlds, classic dystopian fiction include George Orwell’s genre-defining Nineteen Eighty-four, Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, Ray Badbury’s Fahrenheit 451 and Anthony Burgess’s A Clockwork Orange as well as Alan Moore’s graphic novel Watchmen.\n\nFirst Contact\n\nAny story that takes as its subject the first meeting of Man with aliens, or any other alien species with any alien species they encounter for the first time.\n\nGalactic Empire\n\nA story which has at its core a ruling empire that controls star systems, even galaxies. It may also be the story of the internal machinations within such an organisation, its birth, rise and decline, or all three. Isaac Asimov’s Foundation trilogy and Simon R. Green’s Deathstalker novels would be examples here, while the most obvious candidate movie-wise would be the Star Wars franchise.\n\nGeneration Ship\n\nSomewhat similar to a Colonisation story, these would be set on a multi-generation ship which would travel through space to its final destination, generations being born, living and dying aboard the ship before it finally arrived.\n\nHard SF\n\nThere are no compromises in this sub-genre, and you had better know your s**t if you’re going to write it. You also had better be seriously interested in science, as these types of stories go deep, deep into the science, the mechanics and the mathematics of what makes everything work in the story. Sounds a bit boring to me, personally.\n\nHuman Development\n\nFocuses on the evolution of humanity, whether it be via computer implants or enhanced mental abilities.\n\nImmortality\n\nSurely I hardly need explain this one, need I?\n\nLight/Humorous\n\nThe kind of stories that refuse to take science-fiction too seriously. The obvious example here is Douglas Adams’s Hitch-hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy series, while movies would be the likes of Mars Attacks!, My Stepmother is an Alien and Men in Black, with Red Dwarf more or less carrying the flag for humorous SF on telly.\n\nMilitary\n\nConcerned with wars, campaigns, invasions, rebellions and all that sort of stuff. Most likely to focus heavily on things like strategy and weaponry, and possibly too the ultimate futility and insanity of war. The one that jumps immediately to my mind here is Robert A. Heinlein’s Starship Troopers, while on the box I can think of Space: Above and Beyond.\n\nMind Uploading\n\nMaybe a slight crossover here with AI and Cyberpunk, these stories are centred on the attempts by humans to digitise themselves and upload themselves to computer systems. I guess Tron might be a good example of a movie in this sub-genre, as would The Matrix.\n\nMundane SF\n\nNow this confuses me. The description says that it takes place in the present, and uses only the science and tech we currently have. How does that make it science-fiction? Don’t ask me: I didn’t write the list.\n\nMutants\n\nSci-fi about, oh, how can I put this? Oh yeah. Mutants. Your obvious example here is the X-Men and to some smaller degree perhaps Mutant X and Heroes.\n\nMythic Fiction (SF)\n\nTakes the tropes and figures from fantasy and mythology and weaves a science-fiction story around those. I guess you could imagine something like the Star Trek episode “Who Mourns for Adonais” where the crew come across an alien being who turns out to be the Greek god Apollo. Or says he is anyway. Never trust a god who lives alone on a planet and steals your woman, is a good rule to live by.\n\nNanotechnology\n\nYou all know what nanotech is, yes? Tiny, atom-sized robots that can make things by sticking together, or go inside a human body or brain (theoretically anyway).\n\nNear-Future\n\nSomething like Mundane SF, perhaps, but a step slightly closer to the future, though still set close to our own time, maybe a few decades later, but not much more than that.\n\nPulp\n\nNo, I won’t add “fiction”! Pulp magazines were the inexpensive, sensationalist comics and magazines popular in the 1950s, often with sci-fi or horror stories, as well as crime and romance ones. Most of these would probably be your Flash Gordonesque man-in-a-spacesuit-flies-pointy-rocket-to-Mars kind of thing. Very basic.\n\nRobots/Androids\n\nSlightly distinct from AI, these stories have as their protagonist or antagonist automatons, as in Asimov’s I, Robot and many of his other robot stories and novels, or maybe the Transformers movies? You get the general idea though.\n\nScience-Fantasy\n\nAlready touched on, and again a giveaway in the title, this is where science-fiction and fantasy meet, with the stories taking elements from both genres. Anne McCaffrey’s Pern cycle and, to a lesser degree perhaps, Terry Brooks’s Shanarra series are examples of this sub-genre.\n\nSingularity\n\nThis seems to focus on a single event which, by its occurrence, advances the course of human technological or biological advance by a massive amount. Uh, yeah. We’ll no doubt come back to this one, as it’s another that I don’t quite get. On we go.\n\nSlipstream\n\nApparently, where real-world and science-fiction (or speculative fiction) collide. Usually set in the present or a version of it. Think Margaret Attwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale. It says here.\n\nSoft SF\n\nInvolves the less exact sciences such as sociology, psychology and anthropology. Right. Okay. It's probably also squishy in your hands. Maybe.\n\nSpace Exploration\n\nNow this is going to take some explaining. See, this sub-genre concerns, how can I put this, exploration of, well, space. I know it’s hard to understand, but try… Naturally, Star Trek in all its various forms is the purest example of this sub-genre.\n\nSpace Opera\n\nA sub-genre in which very fat alien ladies sing arias while people…. No. You know what a soap opera is? Well, they just call them soaps now. Yes? Well, space opera is basically that: an unfolding, developing, evolving story featuring many characters and situations, interlinked themes and ideas and concepts, but set in space. They’re not always too concerned about the science, and place the emphasis on fun and adventure rather than realism. Best example of a space opera? Well, see, a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away….\n\nSteampunk\n\nThink science-fiction set in the Victorian era, with the kind of advancements proposed by the likes of H.G. Wells and Jules Verne actually happening within that century, and you have a good idea about this. Weird machines flying powered by steam, steam-driven robots etc.\n\nTerraforming\n\nSomething similar to Colonisation SF, these stories involve the attempts to mould an inhospitable planet or planets to support human life.\n\nTheological\n\nPromotes the idea of gods as space travellers, prophets as travellers in time and so on. I Imagine Stargate might fit the bill here.\n\nTime Travel\n\nYou may have to think about this one…\n\nUplift\n\nWhere a more technologically advanced race helps a less capable one, basically uplifting them to a new level of technological or biological superiority. The Vorlons in Babylon 5 would be an example of such a civilisation, as would Karellen and the Overlords in Arthur C. Clarke’s Childhood’s End and of course the aliens in 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n\nUtopia\n\nI think everyone knows what Utopia entails. The diametric opposite of dystopia, these stories are set in a perfect world.\n\nVirtual Reality\n\nI think this is pretty self-explanatory, no?\n\nWeird SF\n\nThis, however, isn’t. Here’s how one of the writers of this sub-genre describes it: \"The fact of the weird is the fact that the worldweave is ripped and unfinished. Moth-eaten, ill-made. And through the little tears, from behind the ragged edges, things are looking at us.\"\n\nOkay. Right. Generally, it seems “weird SF” takes elements of science-fiction, fantasy and even horror and mixes them all up.\n\nSUB-GENRES (FANTASY)\n\nNot quite as much scope for branching out in fantasy fiction, but there are still a lot of sub-genres.\n\nAlternate History\n\nMore or less the same as in Science-Fiction; here, you might have things like the Roman Empire being run on magic, or, I don’t know, Nazi elves or something? Probably can be tenuously linked to Steampunk?\n\nComic Fantasy (also known as Humorous Fantasy)\n\nAgain, easy to understand. Fantasy with an element of humour mixed in, fantasy that doesn’t take itself too seriously, that may lampoon well known fantasy or other works (Bored of the Rings, for example) or just create new worlds in which anything can happen, and usually does, in a funny way. Comic fantasy often contains satirical stabs at the real world and some authors, notably Piers Anthony, use a lot of puns and wordplay in their work. Craig Shaw Gardner’s Dwarfs books, Robert Aspirin’s Myth cycle and the work of Tom Holt fit into this sub-genre, though the undisputed master of the form is the late Sir Terry Pratchett, with his Discworld series.\n\nContemporary Fantasy\n\nA little like the horror material I spoke of earlier, which I don’t intend to cover, fantasy in this sub-genre takes place in our world, our time; a sort of secret society that lives just beyond our sight or without our knowledge. The likes of Neil Gaiman’s Neverwhere fit into this category, as do series like Buffy and Supernatural, the idea being that while normal folk go on doing normal things, fantastical battles are fought and magic is used without the knowledge of anyone outside of the circle, as it were.\n\nDark Fantasy\n\nBrings in elements of horror to fantasy, while still remaining firmly fantasy-based stories.\n\nErotic Fantasy\n\nYeah…\n\nFairytale Fantasy\n\nFantasy stories set in, using or creating folklore-based worlds.\n\nFantasy of Manners\n\nTakes the old literature genre of Comedy of Manners and applies a fantasy setting.\n\nHeroic Fantasy\n\nYou know what to expect here, I’m sure.\n\nHigh Fantasy\n\nNo, not the kind of trip where you see dragons and princesses after taking too much LSD! High Fantasy has no time for humour, being totally serious, sometimes so up itself it’s hard not to laugh, but creating the most detailed and intricate plots, characters and worlds. High Fantasy often tends to spawn multi-book epics or films with sequels. The absolute pinnacle of High Fantasy of course is The Lord of the Rings, though series like Stephen Donaldson’s Thomas Covenant Chronicles and Robert Jordan’s Wheel of Time sagas are also high (sorry) on the list.\n\nHistorical Fantasy\n\nBased in a real-world period of history (maybe Medieval England or Renaissance Italy) where magic is used in the story.\n\nJuvenile Fantasy\n\nI feel this may now be called YA, or Young Adult Fantasy, and it does exactly what it says on the tin: young fantasy for young people featuring young characters and dealing with the issues they come up against in their young lives. Bah, say I. Look to C.S. Lewis’s Chronicles of Narnia for the best known example of this sub-genre.\n\nLow Fantasy\n\nPossibly best described as “Fantasy Noir”, this sub-genre emphasises the darker, grittier aspect of the fantasy world, with things like crime, rape, prostitution and drug addiction used in its themes.\n\nMagic Realism\n\nUh, it says “Magic Realism presents fantastic and mundane elements side-by-side as if there is no conflict between the two”. Right. Again, sounds boring to me.\n\nMythic Fantasy\n\nBased loosely or entirely on figures from various mythologies, folklore or legends.\n\nRomantic Fantasy\n\nYup.\n\nSuperhero Fantasy\n\nFantasy stories with superheroes. Yeah.\n\nSword and Sorcery\n\nApart from High Fantasy - and, increasingly, Comic Fantasy - surely the most popular and prevalent sub-genre in fantasy fiction. Warriors and barbarians wielding swords and rippling with muscles take on crafty, centuries-old wizards and go on quests because, well, that’s what you do in when you're a sword-wielding barbarian rippling with muscles. Conan the Barbarian is of course the first example that leaps to mind (Crom!) but Fritz Leiber and Karl Edward Wagner are also well known as experts in this sub-genre.\n\nUrban Fantasy\n\nUsually, though not always, set in modern times, these stories are always however confined to a city.\n\nWeird Fantasy\n\nPretty much the same as Weird SF really.\n\nIf anyone thinks my explanations and descriptions here are inadequate (they are) or don’t explain what the sub-genre is about (they don’t) please check out the article I took them from, which does a much better job and goes into each in far more detail. I just didn’t want to copy it verbatim. Also, I’m lazy.\n\nhttp://www.worldswithoutend.com/resources_sub-genres.asp\n\nNote: to make it easier for those who prefer science fiction to fantasy or vice versa to see the posts they want to, I'll of course be making an index but I will also ensure each post, or series of posts, only covers one of the two (or three, if I go into horror) and will head it with the relevant icon. This will be the one for fantasy, which I am of course going to begin with, given that it came first historically.\n\nAnd now, back to the program!\n\nSo those are the many sub-genres of both science-fiction and fantasy, but how did they get started? Well, it’s easy to see that fantasy was first, and had its origins in the myths and tales of the poets and scribes of ancient Greece, Rome and the sagas of Norway, among others. It’s true that mostly, at the time these were written they were not written as stories, but as accounts, fables or parables in which the writer himself believed. Homer’s Odyssey and Illiad are supposedly true accounts of events that happened, even if they may be very much embellished from the somewhat mundane truth. But man has always been fascinated by the different, the weird, the bizarre, the unexplainable. Flying horses, all-powerful gods, dwarfs dwelling in caverns beneath the earth, fantastical monsters and epic voyages and battles, magic and amazing feats caught the imagination back then, even as they do now, though in these enlightened ages we recognise that such things could not exist. We still enjoy them though; something does not have to be feasible or plausible to interest us. If it did, a huge swathe of fiction would disappear overnight.\n\nThe first rule, they say, in storytelling is to hook the reader, or back then, the listener, in the first sentence or two. So openings like “A giant dwelled on a mountain” or “The son of the sultan took to the air on his magic flying carpet” were always going to grab the attention, and so figure strongly in the story. People wanted, and still want, to be entertained, and as ever, our overall attention span is low, hence the preponderance of never-pause-for-breath action movies gracing our cinemas these days, and possibly why some people - too many people, it seems to me - refuse to read a book. Instant gratification is the goal in this hurly-burly, can’t stop world, and the majority of people, it would appear, simply have not or cannot spare the time to work through a developing story.\n\nEven more restless, those who could not read (which covered the vast majority) back in the days of Homer and Virgin and Cicero, were eager for action, action, action! They did not want a long, rambling introduction or scene setting up the story. Bam! Man on a flying dragon! Page one! Into the battle! People wouldn’t sit around waiting for things to happen, and so the storyteller had to make them happen, quickly and on cue and with increasing wonder and awe, one of the things that makes the likes of the Illiad so full of action, comparatively.\n\nTimeline of Fantasy Literature\n\nTimeline: 1800 BC - 1000 AD (approx)\n\nSumerian\n\nMost scholars seem to agree that the Epic of Gilgamesh, written approximately 1800 BC, almost four hundred years after the death of the King of the ancient Sumerian city of Uruk, is the first real example of fantasy literature. Whether it was based on a real figure or not, it incorporates all the great tropes that would go on to define fantasy: monsters, seemingly invincible enemies, gods, demons, quests, heroes and companions.\n\nNote: as this list is bound to be long and feature numerous writings, I’ll only be giving a quick idea, the bare bones of the story here. Of course I will likely go into each, or some at any rate, in more detail when the time arrives. Should you wish to research, read or watch the item in question further, links will be provided.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_of_Gilgamesh\n\nIndian\n\nIndia, too, has its ancient epics, one in fact being reckoned the longest epic poem ever. With over 200,000 verses totalling in excess of almost two million words, the Mahābhārata is twice the length of both the Odyssey and the Illiad combined - and they ain’t small paperbacks, people! It was written by the great Indian sage Vyasa around 800-900 BC (though the surviving fragments only date from around 400 BC) and together with the Ramayana is considered the Hindu Itihasa, or history of their people.\n\nIn addition to relating the tale of warring princes and kingdoms, the Mahābhārata offers advice on spiritual, philosophical and devotional issues, and is treated by Hindus with the same reverence as Christians ascribe the Bible, or Muslims the Qu’oran.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahabharata\n\nThere is also the Baital Pachisi, which translates roughly to “Vikram and the Vampire”, something you’ll come across later in my Vampire thread. It’s a loose collection of stories which is said to have perhaps inspired one of the very greatest epics, not only of Islamic culture, but in the world, the 1001 Nights, better known as The Arabian Nights.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baital_Pachisi\n\nGreek/Roman\n\nBut of course the best examples of early fantasy, at least that we’re more familiar with, come from the ancient Greeks, also adapted later by the Romans, usually with just a few name-changes to appease their gods. Great writers and poets of the time such as Homer, Virgil and Plato have given us stories that, while of course we now recognise them as fiction, some perhaps even allegorical, still enthrall and entertain us today. Timeless heroes like Odysseus and Achilles, Hercules, Theseus, Jason and Perseus still find their place in our twenty-first century world of computers and technology, sometimes updated but often with little change from how they were written back in ancient times. The whole structure of fantasy, particularly heroic fantasy and sword and sorcery, begins with the Greek and Roman playwrights and scribes. Things like quests, magical items, rebirth through struggle, rescue of princesses, encounters with gods and battles against evil all stem from these times and the writings of these men. It would not be at all overstating the case to call them the fathers of fantasy literature.\n\nHomer: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer\n\nVirgil: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil\n\nPlato: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato\n\nIslamic\n\nDespite however being written, at best estimates, approximately a thousand years after Homer put quill to parchment, the story cycle that has had the greatest impression upon the world and has lasted the longest comes from the Middle East, from Persia and Syria, where the tale of the One Thousand and One Nights, often called The Arabian Nights, introduces characters we are all familiar with, such as Ali Baba, Sinbad the Sailor and Aladdin. Written as a series of nested stories, as it were, the epic concerns the efforts of the princess Scheherezade to put off her execution by her husband the king, who mistrusts women after having been betrayed by his previous wife (and had her executed) and who intends to, and does, have every future wife murdered on her wedding night. Scheherezade uses the medium of storytelling to stay his hand, ensuring that each story ends on a cliffhanger, so that the king will wish to hear how the story turns out, and will have to keep her alive until the following night, when she promises to resume/finish the story.\n\nEach story of course ends up leading into another one, ensuring her survival for one thousand and one nights, by which time the king, having learned and taken to heart the many philosophical lessons in Scheherezade’s stories, and also having learned that she is not like other women, can be trusted and that, in the end, he loves her, eventually spares her.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Thousand_and_One_Nights\n\nEUROPEAN\n\nEnglish\n\nThe first proper tale of fantasy coming out of the shores of England is the epic of Beowulf, which tells of the efforts of the eponymous king to protect his realm from the marauding creature Grendel. Its author’s name is lost to the mists of time, and even the date of its composition can only be guessed at, though it seems to have been written somewhere around the same time as the tales that eventually comprised the One Thousand and One Nights were being collated into one epic. Although written in Old English and believed to be by an English (or at least, Anglo-Saxon) author, it is in fact set in Scandinavia, in Sweden.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beowulf\n\nScandinavian\n\nDrawing deeply on the mythology of the Norse Vikings, the Prose Edda, written by Snorri Sturluson around the 13th century, is responsible for introducing the world of Thor, Odin and the Aesir to a broader audience outside of Scandinavia, and so paving the way for fantasy literature to take such characters to its bosom.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose_Edda\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology\n\nOther important Nordic sagas include the Volsung Saga and the Nibelungenlied, both of which would be transformed into Wagner’s famous operatic Ring Cycle, and Frithjof’s Saga, which influenced fantasy writing in Europe, including one J.R.R. Tolkien.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Völsunga_saga\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nibelungenlied\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frithiof's_Saga\n\nCeltic\n\nIrish and Welsh mythology is rich with figures who have been taken and used in fantasy literature, and has had a bearing too on one of the most important semi-historical/fantasy figures, King Arthur.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mabinogion\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_Cycle\n\nTimeline: 1200 - 1500\n\nDuring the age of chivalry, wherein knights served kings and the idea of fair play, rules and respect for one’s opponent in battle, as well as a sense of (among the knights at least) a duty of care for the common folk, romance and chivalric literature became very popular. Tales of knights-errant - probably sparked by the tales of the search for the Holy Grail - abounded, and also gave birth to the idea of a quest, which would and has become such a central theme in the larger part of fantasy literature. Quests would often be set to test a knight or other adventurer’s mettle, to allow him to prove something, to himself or others, or to help a patron recover or regain something that was important to them, perhaps to the kingdom. Quests were of course never easy, fraught with danger, sometimes confusing directions given, and always enemies waiting to thwart the efforts of he who quested.\n\nDrawing on both mythology and fairy tales as well as real history, and since many, indeed most of the earliest ones were written in verse, this provided minstrels and balladeers with material for their songs, and also allowed the stories to be disseminated (through the minstrel’s art and via his wandering nature) to more than would have been able to read them, given that there was a large percentage of the common folk who could not read at all. These stories inevitably contained a moral, often to do with religion or love, or both, and reinforced the ideas of loyalty, bravery, steadfastness and dedication to one’s duty, particularly his quest. Invariably, the hero’s quest was successful, or if not, its failure served as a sort of epiphany to show him that what was more important than the object he sought was his own development and personal improvement. The quest might reveal some answer about life, or the quester, or his world, or God.\n\nRomance tales were generally at this time broken up into three distinct forms or cycles, these being the Matter of Rome (Italian stories centring on Alexander the Great and Julius Caesar), the Matter of France (regarding Charlemagne) and the Matter of Britain (which mostly featured, as already mentioned, King Arthur and his knights). There were of course stories which fell outside of this format, as there are in almost every form of literature, but most of these chivalric romances seem to have served mostly as a sort of ongoing propaganda tool for the various kings about whom they were written, or in whose reign at any rate they were set. They would reinforce the king’s bravery, wisdom and cunning through the quests handed out, who they were given to and how they were rewarded when accomplished.\n\nThey also, of course, encouraged young boys reading them (or to whom they were read) to emulate the great knights and squires in the tales, thereby providing a free advertisement for the notions and practice of chivalry, and giving young boys a grounding in how they were expected to behave when grown. Almost a kind of fantasy training manual, in one way, I suppose you could say. At the same time, they showed the girls how to behave, what was expected of them and what they could look forward to when they grew up. Even if hardly any of them ever got carried away by a prince on a white charger, or rescued from a deep sleep by a handsome knight, the tales carried codes of conduct and instructions as to how the young were supposed to perceive the world, and how they should behave in it once they had attained what was accepted as adulthood. Naturally, none of this included any explicit knowledge of sex or even explored romance any deeper than the surface, but then, these were stories, after all, and their principle aim was to entertain.\n\nNevertheless, lessons were taught, and many of a moral nature, through these romances. One of the most important was the idea of monogamy, chastity until marrying age and respect for one’s elders, all pretty much enshrined in the ideas of chivalry anyway. Every knight, every princess, human or otherwise (as fairies and elves and goblins and other creatures began to slowly creep into the romances, blending in folklore to the story to make it more attractive and fantastical), every king and queen was expected to conduct themselves according to these tenets, which is probably why Lancelot’s pursuit of Guinevere is so shocking, or was, at the time. Not only did the bravest knight in Arthur’s court go after the King’s wife, but he, Lancelot, was also Arthur’s friend. So there’s a quadruple betrayal here: knight to king (no I’m not describing a chess move!) and friend to friend, and then from Guinevere’s side queen to king and wife to husband. Betrayed every way, that kind of treachery can bring down a kingdom.\n\nAnd so it did, almost. Arthur’s being mystically and inextricably linked with the land meant that when things went badly for him, his realm reflected this, suffering as he did; crops would not grow, weather turned bad, the entire mood of Britain soured. Only through the recovery of Christ’s cup from the Last Supper could the king, and the land, be healed. And thus began the Quest for the Holy Grail, which kickstarted the imagination of many a fantasy writer, and while it wasn’t the very first quest, it did form the template for almost all of what came afterwards. In the chivalric romances, love was pure, unsullied and from God. It was not seen as a base, bestial thing but as an idealised, well, romantic sort of power that attracted men and women together, but nothing was mentioned of what happened after the knight won the lady, save perhaps a footnote about their offspring, the younger reader or listener left to work out for themselves how that came about!\n\nTimeline: 1500 - 1600\n\nAs a time of rebirth and enlightenment across Europe, the Renaissance was an era in which fantasy literature began to flower. The first proper recorded work of fantasy to collect and transcribe fairy and folk tales was created, perhaps not surprisingly since the revolution in learning, art and literature began there, by an Italian, one Giambattista Basile, in his Pentamorone, whose Italian title translates to Tale of Tales and is rendered as, wait for it, lo cunto de li cunti! Titter, titter, chortle, chortle, dirty laughter. All right, got that out of our systems now, have we? Let’s move on.\n\nThis work would in fact form the basis of later translations and retellings of fairy tales, notably by two brothers who were both called Grimm, who heaped praise upon Basile for his work. The Pentamorone sort of reflects in style the far earlier 1001 Nights (or Arabian Nights, as it has become more popularly known) in that the basis is that someone has to tell stories to someone else in the narrative, and these become the fairy tales, of which many are known today.\n\nAlthough a lot of his material were historical epics such as Richard III and Henry V, Julius Caesar etc., Shakespeare brought a lot of fantasy into his own writings, especially the comic ones such as A Midsummer Night’s Dream but also more serious fare such as Hamlet and MacBeth, with ghosts in the former and witches in the latter, and audiences loved to see - and some more literate ones read about - such fantastic creatures and beings, leading to an interest in things that were not rooted in the real world, and a resurgence in the popularity of fairy tales and legends.\n\nTimeline: 1600 - 1800\n\nWith the dawn of the Age of Reason, the Enlightenment, when logic and hard-nosed reality ruled, such ideas were frowned upon as suitable only for children, and the Romantic Era blossomed as a direct reaction to the cold, scientific ideas of the seventeenth century. Having its beginnings in the final decades of the eighteenth century and carrying on, and gaining support in the nineteenth, the Romantic Era produced such writers as Edgar Allan Poe, James McPherson, Goethe and Walter Scott, and while the Brothers Grimm, as already mentioned, began collating and writing their fairy stories around this time, others such as Elias Lönnrot set about compiling the folk tales of their own country, in his case Finland and Karelia, an epic cycle entitled Kalevala, much of the incentive for such being his desire to preserve the mythology of his homeland. These, then, provided much fodder for later fantasy works.\n\nTwo important authors in this time were Charles Pennault (1628-1703) and Madame D’Aulnoy (1650-1705), the latter of whom actually coined the term “fairy tales” for her work. Perhaps there’s a case for considering these two, along with the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen, as the progenitors or grandparents of the fairy tale in fantasy literature. Pennault rewrote and published such standards we know today as Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty and Puss-in-Boots, and in the process created a whole new fantasy literature genre, fairy tales. Madame D’Aulnoy, who among other things wrote court memoirs and histories, seems to have concentrated on the more anthropomorphic aspect of fairy tales, perhaps inadvertently presaging the advent of cartoon animals over three hundred years later. Her tales were a lot more adult in nature, and definitely not for children. I’m not one hundred percent sure whether these were tales she transcribed, like Basile and later the Brothers Grimm, or if she made them up herself (I think it might be the latter) but at any rate, she worked on her material almost a century and a half before the Grimms were born.\n\nAlthough many “serious” writers frowned on the whole idea of fairy tales and fantasy works, considering them only for children, and even then vulgar and common, figures like Voltaire himself embarked on writing fantasy stories, such as The Princess of Babylon and The White Bull. Nevertheless, in general as you would probably expect, the Age of Enlightenment was not good for the fantasy/fairy story genre, to say nothing of various Catholic Inquisitions who would have frowned on such material, calling it pagan, ungodly, blasphemous and heretical. So it wasn’t until the late eighteenth century that fantasy began to fight back, in what has become known to history as the Age of Romance, or Romanticism. This in turn gave rise to a format of literature not only important to fantasy, but to horror too: the gothic novel or story.\n\nGothic literature can really be described in one word: dark. Everything about Gothic writing hinges on the more macabre, scary and supernatural elements of storytelling, with mores that we are now very familiar with and can identify as belonging to this genre, such as haunted castles, ghosts, mysterious recluses, people living in attics and garrets, curses, bequests, funerals, wild weather, family secrets and romance, often doomed or cursed. The first novel accepted as being written in the Gothic style, the one that kicked the whole thing off, is Horatio Walpole’s The Castle of Otranto, in 1764. Some of the more well-known ones of course are Bram Stoker’s Dracula, Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, along with the works of Edgar Allan Poe and Emily Bronte’s Wuthering Heights. Gothic literature really took hold in the Victorian era, giving rise to the “penny dreadful” stories that thrilled the lower classes, who could identify with much of what was written in them, and shocked the upper classes (though in truth, many a rich, well-bred lady probably hid a penny dreadful under her satin coverlet) who despised their vulgarity.\n\nTimeline: 1800 - 1900\n\nAnd with the dawn of Victoria’s long reign fantasy was back in vogue again, chiefly through the move away from the too-rigid reasoning of the last century and on the back of the rise of the penny dreadful and Gothic literature in general. This period would see the publication of some of what are now accepted as the world’s greatest authors, such as Shelley, Lewis Carroll, Dickens and William Morris. Perhaps it had to do with the “common” people becoming more literate and aware of their world than they might have been in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but more people were reading, and most of them didn’t want stuffy tracts about politics or history or battles or philosophy: they wanted to be entertained.\n\nAnd fantasy was the great entertainer. You really didn’t have to “know” anything - that is, be educated about the subject, unlike in other types of literature, where you might be lost if you didn’t have at least a working knowledge and grasp of the subject - because everything was either explained or didn’t need to be. If a fairy flew, a fairy flew and there was no cause for explanation. If a castle floated in the clouds or resided at the bottom of the ocean, that was all accepted. Fantasy - and, to another extent, horror - all required and require a willing suspension of disbelief. We know these things can’t happen, but we don’t care. It’s a story, so it doesn’t have to be true.\n\nFantasy really gathered steam in the nineteenth century, classic works such as Alice in Wonderland, The Fall of the House of Usher and Frankenstein ensuring that it would never again have to retreat to the shadows (some of what was written was, technically, at home in the shadows, but you know what I mean) and was here to stay. People like H. Rider Haggard, George MacDonald and even Oscar Wilde did a lot to advance the art, while later writers such as H.P Lovecraft and Hans Christian Anderson would pull the genre in two diametrically opposed directions. Some authors, such as CS Lewis and Lewis Carroll, would concentrate on writing for, and about, children, while Poe, Edgar Rice Burroughs and Shelley definitely had a more adult audience in mind.\n\nThat's where we'll leave the Fantasy timeline for now: ad astra, as they say! The final frontier beckons!\n\nWorlds Apart: New Planets to Explore\n\nWhile there’s plenty of SF I haven’t read or seen, one thing that recurs as a major theme in the genre is other worlds. Even the earliest versions of SF feature men travelling to other planets, and when the genre really gets going in the nineteenth century or so, there’s really only one planet that’s in the frame. It’s our nearest neighbour (no, the Moon is not a planet, dummy!) and has probably seen the most settings of stories upon its surface than just about any other planet, real or imaginary.\n\nIt’s hardly surprising that, back in the late 1800s, when emerging science-fiction writers wanted a different planet than Earth for their work they looked to Mars. Not only has it a cool name, it’s also known as the red planet - due to its surface being, well, red dust - and is, in the main, quite similar to Earth, at least for narrative purposes. It’s around the same size, is nearest and really, men from Mars rolls off the tongue so much better than men from Venus. Saturn looks great, of course, with all its rings, but since this was, at that time, pretty much out of the range of the telescopes available - nothing much would be known about the largest planet in our solar system until we developed the technology to send probes there - any SF writer worth his or her salt would shy from setting a story there, since this is Science-Fiction, after all, not Fantasy, and there needed to be some at least partway believable science involved.\n\nEven the dumbest of readers would understand that, say, Mercury was too close to the sun and therefore too hot to be able to sustain any kind of life, while Pluto (at the time the furthest planet discovered, before it was heartlessly demoted in the twentieth century) was of course way too cold. Venus we didn’t know a lot about, but Mars! Lowell had already observed what he took to be canals on the red planet (which turned out of course to be nothing of the sort) and so the germ of the idea was planted in the fertile minds of SF writers: if there were, or had been, canals on Mars then surely there was, now or at some time, water? And if there was water there could be life.\n\nSo Mars became the popular destination for the science-fiction writer’s imagination to travel to, and the harbinger of all that was scary and threatening from space. Although his story post-dates Jules Verne’s From the Earth to the Moon by thirty-odd years, and although there are a handful of stories set on or about Mars, it’s Herbert George Wells’s famous The War of the Worlds which we remember and which is regarded as the first true alien invasion story, and the first to be set on Mars. Technically, of course, it’s not. Set on Mars, that is. The aliens come from Mars, and apart from seeing through a powerful telescope the cylinders which carry the Martians to Earth, we don’t see the red planet, and have only Wells’s - through his narrator - thoughts and theories as to what it is like there.\n\nBut with the arrival of the Martians, the idea that Mars is or could be a staging post for invasion is set up, and others would later set their books and stories there. Notably the creator of Tarzan, Edgar Rice Burroughs, set an entire series of novels there, as intrepid Civil war captain John Carter is inexplicably - and with the most stupid transition I have ever read in my life, and I’ve watched Family Guy! - transported to Mars, which he learns is called Barsoom by the inhabitants. He finds a whole civilisation there, and inevitably a war going on for control of the planet. Burroughs also set some of his stories on Venus, but more of that later. One of the very earliest SF books I read was his A Princess of Mars, and from the first I was hooked, reading all the others I could. I saw the movie John Carter of Mars recently, and have to admit I was not that impressed, nor do I remember much from the novels that was in the movie. That could of course be my poor memory, the fact that I was probably 12 or 13 when I read them, or the makers of the movie changing the story to fit their narrative. Nevertheless, I was disappointed.\n\nRay Bradbury used the planet for his own sagas The Martian Chronicles, while Kim Stanley Robinson took a more strictly scientific approach in his trilogy, Red Mars, Green Mars and Blue Mars, which follows the terraforming of the planet for human colonisation. Mars features in many movies, including of course fifties B-movies where it may just be mentioned as, or theorised as the origin of the alien attack that is plaguing mankind, but also in recent fare such as Red Planet, Total recall, Mission to Mars and John Carpenter’s Ghosts of Mars. It’s the opening, dramatic and somewhat threatening theme that heralds Gustav Holst’s seminal suite The Planets, and “Mars, the Bringer of War” has gone on to be used in everything from war movies to ads for suppositories. Possibly. Suffice to say, it’s extremely unlikely, no matter your age or interest in classical music, that you’ve failed to hear that piece of music, even if you don’t know what it’s called.\n\nSpoof films used Mars too. Mars Attacks! is a perhaps-not-that-funny take on pulp style movies of the fifties, Lobster Man from Mars is just, well, silly, while Santa Claus Conquers the Martians is touted, rightly, as “one of the worst films ever made.” As a colony of Earth fighting for its independence, Mars is used as the base for the feared and dreaded Psi Corps in the series Babylon 5. It’s referenced in music hits from Bowie to The Misfits . By the 1940s Mars was the go-to place to set your alien invasion story, and among others, Robert A. Heinlein used it repeatedly, notably in The Green Hills of Earth (1947), Red Planet (1949) and Stranger in a Strange Land (1961), while Arthur C. Clarke set his 1951 novel The Sands of Mars there, as did Isaac Asimov a year later with The Martian Way (1952). Much of Philip K. Dick’s output centres on Mars, especially Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? (1968) which was of course made into the classic cult SF movie Blade Runner.\n\nIn fact, just about any SF author you can name has dipped his or her toe into the Martian landscape, or referenced it. Everyone from Larry Niven to Frederik Pohl and from Harry Turtledove to Micheal Moorcock and Lin Carter have paid homage to the red planet. Interest, which has never really flagged, was heightened in 2016 when underground ice was discovered on Mars, its volume capable of filling Lake Superior, and restarting the debate as to whether life could have existed on the planet. As preparations near completion for the Mission to Mars this coming year, it’s clear that, no matter what is discovered there, no matter what revelations Mars may have or not have to show us, the human fascination with our nearest planetary neighbour is unlikely to ever cease, nor is it expected that the imaginations of writers will ever tire of turning to its bleak, forbidding yet somehow irresistible presence for inspiration.\n\nFar Beyond These Castle Walls: The Role of the Castle in Fantasy\n\nLook at any fantasy-inspired poster or drawing, or the cover of any fantasy book - especially those in the sword-and-sorcery sub-genre - and the chances are you’ll see a castle, either in the background or right up front. It might be a knight rushing across a bridge on his horse to rescue a princess, or a unicorn prancing on the battlements, or something darker perhaps: a dark, dismal edifice high on a mountain, wreathed in black thunderclouds with eldritch fingers of lightning dancing around its turrets, while a shadowy figure with sharp, bright eyes peers out of the topmost window, watching the world below with malevolent intent.\n\nNo wait: that's the Google Streetview of my home. Ignore that. And what do you mean, malevolent intent, eh?\n\nFrom the earliest days of fantasy, from fairy tales on, castles, strongholds, fortresses and palaces have been the setting for drama, intrigue, power and magic. This isn’t at all surprising when you consider that many of the heroes of fantasy were, and still are to some degree, noblemen and women, knights or others of high breeding, and that kings, queens, princes and princesses figure highly in fairy tales and stories of fantastic adventure. Castles were always the symbol of a king’s power, or a knight’s status, and usually dominated the landscape, towering over the town or village or even city in or near which they were built, whether protectively or menacingly. A castle - especially a royal one - would be the focus of any settlement, and a concrete statement of where the power lay.\n\nThe great and the good lived in castles - or in some cases, the evil, but always the powerful. Ordinary folk were generally not invited, unless summoned there or allowed deliver goods or if they worked perhaps as pages or handmaidens. The castle was its own self-supporting ecosystem, drawing from the village or town only when supplies ran low, and rarely if ever interacting with the inhabitants of that town or village. It was where the balls were, where the jousts were held, where the celebrations and weddings and funerals and parties took place, and where, in times of war, strategy was plotted and troops billeted. It was, in short, the centre of the region.\n\nCastles could be marvellous places. In fairy tales like Cinderella they were the height of society and the ambition to which everyone aspired, from the local lads working as pages or kitchen boys hoping to be chosen as some knight’s squire to the kitchen girls and scullery maids waiting to catch the eye of the handsome prince, and so change their lives forever. When foreign dignitaries visited the area, it was at the castle or palace that they were hosted, and in times of plague and famine it was often the safest place to be. But castles could also be nasty, dark, evil places; crumbling ruins, haunted by spectres or home to a solitary wizard who was known to be very unwelcoming to visitors! They could be the last place you wanted to go, or be taken, from where often nobody ever returned, and they could also be the stronghold of a tyrant who held sway over his people by fear and brutality.\n\nWhichever way you look at it, whichever role the castle fulfilled in the story, they were almost always important, often the centrepiece of a story; the starting or ending point for a quest, the site of fabulous riches or powerful spells to be plundered, or the staging post for a war with the realm’s neighbours. They could be the sites of great joy, such as in The Princess and the Pea, where a woman’s royal heritage is established - and great despair, as in Sleeping Beauty, when the wicked queen, snubbed at the birth feast of the princess, curses her to sleep for a hundred years. Feckin’ women, huh?\n\nIf not the centrepiece they would certainly figure somewhere in the background, like the posters spoken of in the intro, if only as a mention of “the king’s great palace” or “the castle where we will find the wizard.” Often, the dark, unplumbed depths of the castle - its cells, dungeons and cellars - would be the setting for adventure, and this in its turn would give way to a huge interest in these things through classic role-playing games such as Dungeons and Dragons, where players take on the persona of fantasy or medieval people and creatures, and travel through a castle, haunted wood, blasted plain or other dangerous location in search of treasures, battling monsters along the way. These pencil-and-paper games of course developed into computer games, the genesis of the MMORPG, Massively Multiple Online Role Playing Game, which became so popular with titles like Warcraft, Everquest and of course the networked version of Dungeons and Dragons itself.\n\nCastles could be whole worlds unto themselves, so large and cavernous that one could enter one at the beginning of a story, or novel even, and not find a way out, if at all, till the end. Mervyn Peake’s Gormenghast trilogy is set entirely within the walls of the eponymous castle, a sprawling, decrepit edifice that has seen better days, while for Jonathan Harker at least, most of the first part of Dracula takes place within the walls of the count’s lair. Other authors set their stories in or around castles - John Morressey’s Castle Perilous series revolves around, again, the title building, much fighting takes place in and around various castles in The Lord of the Rings, particularly The Two Towers, and of course there are castles aplenty in A Song of Ice and Fire, or Game of Thrones to you.\n\nWhy are castles so important to fantasy? I think because they are, or can be, as I noted earlier, all but self-contained worlds, often even cut off from the outside land, functioning as a separate entity and needing no reference to the realm beyond. They can host whole adventures, novels, films or even series, and the scope for what can happen in a castle is virtually limitless. Castles play a large part in Gothic fiction too, and on into horror; mostly ruined, crumbling or ill-maintained ones, which give off an air of despair and slow death, often reflecting the mind and soul of the one or ones who live there. A castle can be, and has been, a shining beacon in the distance or the epitome of fear and horror, a crouching spider waiting at the end of the road to take your life, and maybe more.\n\nThey’re a symbol of power, prestige and status. A region with a castle - at least, a well-maintained and occupied one - lets you know that there is law in this land, that there is someone who is watching, protecting (or in some cases, oppressing) the subjects of the realm, and from where assistance can be called if needed. They can be a place to find a wife or a husband, fame and glory and power, riches or magic or just a steady job peeling spuds in the royal kitchens. Castles can be a shelter from the storm when war breaks out over the land, or the leeching, filching, grasping hand that demands more and more for the war effort, raising taxes and punishing those who protest. Castles can also be, though perhaps at heart good places, places of fear when gates or battlements are decorated with the heads of traitors or criminals or enemies - a fate we saw befall Ned Stark in Game of Thrones, and a situation demonstrated with gleeful malevolence by Prince, then King Joffrey to Sansa Stark.\n\nCastles have been known to fly, to go to or provide access to other worlds, other dimensions, to house horrors and dreaded fears as well as riches untold and beauty unthought of. They are frequently the last stand of the hero and his companions, the flag raised in defiance over the battlements as the dragons swoop down, and the site of the chance meeting of star-crossed lovers or long-estranged siblings. They have a power all of their own, their personal magic, and the attraction to castles in fantasy will go on for as long as people dream of all the things they could have, or all the things they fear, symbolised by that shining, or shadowy building perched just on the horizon."
