        "text": "Seasons Greetings from San Diego\n\nDate: 12/24/2007 From: Mike Glosson\n\nLocation: San Diego\n\nHappy Holidays Greg!\n\nI finally caught Bill at Burgette Books, here in Normal Heights. Since your last exchange when you asked me to say \"Hi Bill\" every time I've gone down there he's been out, either across the street at the Post Office shipping stuff off for Christmas Shopping, or mining some one's estate.\n\nHaving not done thing one to celebrate Sir Arthur's 90th Birthday this month, other than watch his 10 minute message, I went down looking for a copy of Profiles of the Future, an out of print, but some one beat me to it. Still found many out of Print Clarke essay collections, and Bill had just gotten in used THE BUTLERIAN JIHAD, hard back, which he \"gave\" me for $6.\n\nAs we were finishing up our transaction I said \"An old costumer of yours, who moved away, and used to shop with you when your store was over in Lemon Grove, asked me to send his Regards. You might remember him, he writes a bit of fiction from time to time...Greg Bear\"\n\nBill had been nodding along, slightly interested, and his eyes LIT UP when I got to your name.\n\n\"I remember Greg! He used to come in all the time and buy history books from me. And lived over in Spring Valley. I know he's been writing and winning awards, but what happened to him?\"\n\nSo I quickly brought him up to date that you were living up on the Seatle Area, writing away, and that many of your more recent works were bordering on the main stream, with your latest novel, Quantico, being pretty much a cross over, and that I actually had to find it in the Mystery section of Borders when I bought it new last summer.\n\nHe fondly remembered your earlier works, but said he hadn't had the time follow your writing for much of the last ten to fifteen years. I then mentioned that your next novel, due out summer of 2008, seem to be a return to your roots and Stapledonian influences, and that I was eagerly awaiting it.\n\nSo Bill says : Hi back!\n\nOn a similar note, earlier this month, I was charged with placing some of my Dad's antique furniture with various Antique Dealers along Antique Row near the west end of Adams Avenue. Once I completed my task for the Estate two doors down from the last furniture dealer was Papyrus Antiquities, a Store that dealt in out of print magazines from all decades of the 20th Century...and a great place to score copies of Galaxy Magazine missing from my collection. Popped in, grabbed three of my favorite issues from the late 1970s, and then started chatting up the owners of the store that I was in a hurry, but needed to come back once I figured out which issue's Greg Bear's stories where in...\n\nIn Stereo they said \"Greg Bear! We haven't seen or heard of him in years, what's he up to?\"\n\nSo I gave them a brief overview of your writing career since the early 1980s and that you'd moved the Seatle and started a family.\n\nEventually I need to go back and dig thru their shelves and look for those issues where your stories appeared.\n\nHoping all is Well with you and your family this Holiday Season, and Best Wishes for the New Year ahead (and the release of THE CITY AT THE END OF TIME!\n\nRe: Seasons Greetings from San Diego\n\nDate: 12/24/2007\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nHm... makes me wonder how many of my books end up in used book stores in San Diego! I usually manage to check in to Wahrenbrock's when we're down there for Comic-Con, but need to get to the Outlying Regions soon.\n\nRe: Seasons Greetings from San Diego\n\nDate: 12/24/2007\n\nFrom: Mike Glosson\n\nLocation: San Diego\n\nRegarding your books in used bookstores: More than a few, but it seems most of your readers consider them keepers.\n\nThere was a point when we had something like seven or ten book stores (some where gift stores as well) on the avenue that any store that had an SF section not only had some of your books, there would at least be one signed copy of The Infinity Concerto, and last time I was at Adams Avenue Books there was one such copy.\n\nIn Bill's collectible Paper Back area there is a copy of THE SERPENT MAGE which appears to be signed.\n\nAll that's on the shelves of the SF section in Paperback Row at Bill's store is one lone copy of ETERNITY.\n\nYour work can be as hard to find used around hear as almost Anything by Tim Powers, and I should know, since I track both of your works in used book stores.\n\nThe only author I find more rare on the shelves is Philip K. Dick, which even after his '82 early passing I could still find rare and unusual paperbacks everywhere. Now, zilch...and that may be my own fault as I was talking up Phil's work to every book seller I could corner for more than five minutes all thru the 1990s, if they have anything, it's now in the special sections.\n\nBook Row on Adams Avenue is pretty much gone, reduced to just two used book stores and one new/used (metaphysical) with the closing of Betty's Bookstore last summer.\n\nMeanwhile, Bill's shelves groan with Gordan Dickson books that are sinking under layers of dust!\n\nSo look at it this way: Your writing has hit the point where it's in KEEPER STATUS, with very little of it getting cycled into the used shoppes. And your readership is still mostly your age and then younger. Eventually, though, your work will get back into the used market via Estate Sales, where Bill seems to be getting most of his rare sf paperbacks now. Almost all of my replaced Michael Moorcock New Wave SF came from the Library of a James R. Holly, via Bill's store, and he spookily had a lot of the same tastes in Science Fiction as I do.\n\nSomething to ponder as you work on the revisions of your current book: the personal library life cycle of all your books in and out of print out there in people's homes. A thougt to ponder on New Years Eve? An almost Borges meditation, a story that isn't quite a story...\n\nCheers!\n\nMG\n\nps: Geez...I haven't been in Wahrenbrock's in 17 years, and I used to hit it at least once a month during the '80s. But living right on Book Row in the '90s spoiled me rotten for browsing, as I could go from store to store from 10 am to 6 PM on a Saturday, stop for lunch, and be within walking distance of home the entire time. Even Aardvark Books moved up here, right on the corner of my Block; but Forrest and Anne sold the business off to their friend Anne when she came into her Fortune, and last they told me they were running the Theosophical Library over on El Cajon Blvd...Aardvark was the third store to go when Book Row started to fade\n\nRe: Seasons Greetings from San Diego\n\nDate: 12/27/2007\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nAh, well there's quite a few used copies of my books available here in Seattle! I think web sales are accounting for an awful lot of transactions these days, and a number of stores are relinquishing bricks and mortar as a result.\n\nRe: Seasons Greetings from San Diego\n\nDate: 12/27/2007\n\nFrom: Mike Glosson\n\nLocation: San Diego\n\nThe Dearth of used Greg Bear books in San Diego the last five to ten years may also be a \"Favorite Son\" thing going on.\n\nI remember, way back in the day, actually finding in Book Stop III on El Cajon Blvd selling the first paper back run of HEGIRA nested in it's own special display on the front counter...and I think that was the first and perhaps only time they sold a new book. That WAS my primary used book store for classic paperback SF when I was at Mann and Crawford. And I remember that summer night when I walked into the store, saw the display and told the clerk: Hey! I've met that guy! I'll take a copy! completely forgetting what I had come into the store to browse for...\n\nRe: Seasons Greetings from San Diego\n\nDate: 01/06/2008\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nOf course, I worked at Book Stop for a while a few years before that... Might make a difference!\n\nRe: Seasons Greetings from San Diego\n\nDate: 01/06/2008\n\nFrom: Mike Glosson\n\nLocation: San Diego\n\nI didn't know that! But it makes perfect sense. But probably long before I shopped there...but then again, we used to hit the Basken-Robbins 31 next door to it from the late-mid 1960s onward...which is how I found Bookstop #3...as I forwent a cone once for books.\n\nAlive and unburned in San Diego\n\nDate: 10/23/2007 From: Mike Glosson\n\nLocation: Normal Heights, San Diego, CA\n\nGreg:\n\nGreetings from your olde home town. We are still safe in my Neighborhood of San Diego, quite a way from both fires and their fronts.\n\nWhen I read Quantico recently the SoCal fires sequence made me a little uneasy, having been thru the Fires of 2003.\n\nThe Harris and Witch Creek Fires make the Cedar fire look like a BBQ at Cholina Park. And I thought that one felt like the End of the World.\n\nI had just been out in the back country days before, and saw and experienced the Santa Ana winds and refrained from taking off too deep into the brush on foot.\n\nDown Town Potrero may be completely gone, according to our friends who live(d) there and have survived two prior major fires. That's the Harris Fire.\n\nThe Witch Creek Fire, in it's first hours, took out most of the land around the SR-78 between Ramona and Santa Ysabel. The Ranches and Farms just east of SY are probably gone. The Egg Ranch right on the freeway is gone. Shangrala Ranch, just outside of Romona, is probably gone.\n\nThe Cleveland National Forest in the mountain part of the County is CLOSED DOWN, with only one fire burning there.\n\nWe've opened up our house to members of pub rescue and FNO is they need a place to hold up.\n\nMy younger brother, who works for the law enforcement arm of the California Insurance Commission got drafted last night to do anti-looting patrol in the evac zones. I don't expect to see him until next week, from the stores he told me about being stationed at lake Cuyamaca during the 2003 fires.\n\nThere was a bit of a panic around 3 AM as the fires came up and over Mt. Miguel...until I the media clarified where it was I thought it was coming over Cowles Mountain from Santee, if that had been the case we would have bugged out then and there.\n\nDon't know if you still have family down here after all this time. Let me know if you need any follow ups on anyone or any neighborhoods.\n\nMike Glosson\n\nRe: Alive and unburned in San Diego\n\nDate: 10/24/2007\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nGlad to hear you're well, Mike--we're keeping track of a lot of friends and relatives around my old stomping grounds. I'd be foolish to claim any prescience for describing fires in Malibu (in DEAD LINES) and across five counties in QUANTICO; this sort of thing has been common in Southern California for a long time now. The apocalyptic fire seasons--with orange or dark brown skies and spectacular sunsets and thousands of acres of grey or even white char--still haunt my memories. Stay well!\n\nRe: Alive and unburned in San Diego\n\nDate: 10/24/2007\n\nFrom: Mike Glosson\n\nLocation: \"Smokey\" San Diego, California\n\nGreg:\n\nYes, the fires are prepetual. I missed the Pine Valley Fire in, what was it, 1970, riding thru similar fires up in Central California that year. The fires in the mid 1990s down here just darkened the skies.\n\nI was in Witch Creek, Mesa Grande, Palomar Mountain, Potrero, Jamul in the last weeks...and last Thursday it definitely looked like everything was ready to go up at any minute.\n\nThe News is spotty for Palomar and Julian.\n\nAir Conditions in the city...wow, it's like a smoggy day in LA several decades ago. I have the mother of all sinus headaches and we are tens of miles from any front lines.\n\nAsh is falling on the city.\n\nSpeaking of Cities: I got a chance to scan some of the posts on the blog here during my last visit, and saw some Traffic regading a \"City at the End of Time\". ???? Axis City from The Way novels (I'm finally getting around to reading Legacy!)? Your spin on the Diaspar theme? Your spin on the Dancers at the End of Time (I remember that you recommend those books to me back in '78).\n\nWhen not avoiding wild fire The Stapledonian Mythos of Deep Time is one of my main \"literary\" interests, getting that itch scratched during the 1990s with Benford's novels set at Galactic Centre.\n\nMike Glosson, hunker'd down in Normal Heights.\n\nRe: Alive and unburned in San Diego\n\nDate: 10/24/2007\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nFalling ash--I distinctly remember that from the 1970 fire, crossing 8 on my way to San Diego State College.\n\nCITY is less like Moorcock, more a touch of Stapledon and Hodgson. No direct connection with EON--except that those events might be fit into one small corner of CITY!\n\nRe: Alive and unburned in San Diego\n\nDate: 10/24/2007\n\nFrom: Mike Glosson\n\nLocation: San Diego\n\nAshfall, so far, is not nearly as bad as the 2003 fires. The smoke was so thick that the sun was direct eye observable, and there were some LARGE sunspots during that week. Only the second time in my life I have seen sunspots directly.\n\nI see that CITY has an August 2008 Release date. Something to look forward to and speculate about until next summer.\n\nMike\n\nRe: Alive and unburned in San Diego\n\nDate: 10/24/2007\n\nFrom: patrick\n\nLocation:\n\nHaving been stationed in that area, I know a little of the landscape an all. I didn't think there was much to go up round Ramona. As for Palomar, that would be bad. Nice pine area I spent a night in near the top.\n\nI know that sunspot situation, alternatively, from the oil fires in Kuwait. As well, when the humid season hit, the filth seemed to disappear from the air, then you'd find it under your nails after scratching an itch. And I was a bit south. I heard that in the north you needed vehicle lights on during the day.\n\nRe: Alive and unburned in San Diego\n\nDate: 10/25/2007\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nBrush and forest country is all over in that area. This kind of burn depletes fuel for a couple of years--but if there's a big wet this winter and next, it will soon be back in enough strength to be a problem. Looking over the burn spots on TV, flooding and erosion could also be expected. Right now, the major health problem as the fires subside will be air pollution.\n\nRe: Alive and unburned in San Diego\n\nDate: 10/25/2007\n\nFrom: Mike Glosson\n\nLocation: \"Smokey\" San Diego, California\n\nI'm expecting the something like the Winter of 2004 all over again, but perhaps muted if we are in an El Ninia event instead of El Ninio (pardom my transliterations). We had some major mud slides the last time. Palomar, right now, appears to be the worst mud slide/flood zone, if we get any rain this winter.\n\nRight after the 2003 fires we had a rain storm come thru and clean out the air. No rain in the forcast for weeks, if at all. So the smokey air will be with us.\n\nThere is a possibility of Fog Friday...but Smoke + Fog = the original version of Smog. That could be very nasty.\n\nOne thing no one expected the last time, and we had it with us for nearly two years afterwards: Every time the Santa Ana winds kicked up after the fires we first would have ash falls, then once all the ash was blown away, a stead rain of mica particles from the mountain tops.\n\nWe haven't had much rain since the 2003 fires, and those burn areas are still low on fuel, some of that fuel was nearly 100 years old!\n\nThere's been talk since 2003, with a few test studies, of letting goats out in the thicker brush.\n\nPalomar has been my biggest worry since the summer of 2003, right before the last round of fires: over half the forest was dead due to the draught and bark bettle infestations. They've been steadily logging the forest since then; but when I was up there last Thursday I was still counting two dead trees for every seven. Helicopter footage this morning showed that the fire on Palomar had gone up over the ride on the south face,and it looked like it was burning into parts of the plateau/valley on top. No word on the fate of the Hale Observatory...\n\nHow is \"City at the end of Time\" going?\n\nDate: 10/17/2007 From: Adam Crowl\n\nLocation: Brisbane, Australia\n\nHi Greg\n\nThat perennial British SF serial, \"Doctor Who\" seems to have scooped your timeframe for the new book - the season 3 episode \"Utopia\" sends the Doctor to \"the end of time\" in the year 100 trillion (more or less.) Wasn't badly handled either - space-time seems to be collapsing into black-holes all over the place, and all the regular stars are dead.\n\nI've been reading the reports of memory molecules in recent science news with interest because that might indicate a molecular interface for the brain to interact with our DNA - including HERVs - and invasive DNA from exogenous viruses and bacterial plasmids hitching a ride.\n\nAlso there was a speculative journal article on life based on plasma crystals - charged dust can form stable helical structures it seems akin to DNA and proteins. What do you think of the chances of plasma based life? I think Olaf Stapledon would have smiled to learn of \"dust life\" and all the intensely electrical \"dust-devils\" that inhabit Mars - his Martians, from \"Last, And First Men\" were cloud-like distributed organisms.\n\nLife has some strange possibilities indeed.\n\nRe: How is\n\nDate: 10/17/2007\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nCITY has been delivered to my U.S. and UK editors. I've caught a fair number of the recent DR WHO episodes, and many have been excellent. I wonder if that year-number is entirely coincidental...? (I also sometimes wonder if EON's success in the UK was due in part to its resemblances to DOCTOR WHO. A time traveling object bigger on the inside than on the outside, leading to any number of times and alternate universes... an ambiguously human male who kidnaps a human female and makes her his partner... You decide!)\n\nInteresting parallels\n\nDate: 10/17/2007\n\nFrom: Adam Crowl\n\nLocation: Brisbane, Australia\n\nHi Greg\n\nHey I hadn't thought of \"Eon\" and \"Doctor Who\" but it makes sense - and the \"Lords\" of the Infinite Hexamon manipulate time don't they? The Jarts are rather Dalek-like in their single-minded crusade too. LOL\n\nGlad to hear the book is on its way. I'll be looking out for it here in Oz. Any teasers you can leak to us?\n\nInteresting parallels\n\nDate: 10/17/2007\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nNo teasers. Wouldn't want the Time Lords to hear!\n\nRe: How is\n\nDate: 10/17/2007\n\nFrom: Roald Laurenson\n\nLocation: Switzerland\n\nGreg, many congratulations on getting that draft out!\n\nand kind regards...\n\nRe: How is\n\nDate: 10/17/2007\n\nFrom: patrick\n\nLocation:\n\nI don't know about the Dr. Who/Eon thing. The Tom Baker episodes were my favorites, but honestly the whole thing was, and continues to be, a bit wonky. I'm still waiting for a serious, in many respects, film.\n\nMore on topic: for insight into speculated plasma life forms, check out Gregory Benford's Galactic Centre series.\n\nRe: How is\n\nDate: 10/20/2007\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nNow for a bit of a breather, before the revisions come due...\n\nRe: How is\n\nDate: 10/20/2007\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nThe old WHO series are great fun. The new ones have equal manic energy, a very wonky imagination, and sometimes great heart as well.\n\nHalf the appeal was wonky sets\n\nDate: 10/20/2007\n\nFrom: Adam Crowl\n\nLocation: Brisbane, Australia\n\nHi again\n\nBefore the revived \"Doctor Who\" was aired here in Oz our ABC began playing all the old \"Who\" it could blow dust off over a couple of years, so we had the pleasure of seeing all the surviving wonky old episodes from 1963-1969, as well as the more complete 1970-1989 canon. There were many lacuna - a lot of BBC archival videotape had been \"recycled\" in the late 1960s. The dodgey model work and silly SFX were rather charming, making the old series more like stage-plays than SF TV.\n\nBy Jon Pertwee's era (1970-1974) things had improved immensely, though the monsters were pretty rubbery, yet clever TV work gave it real suspense value. Tom Baker's early episodes seemed a bit slip-shod compared to Pertwee's better episodes, but in time that improved. I always remember being genuinely terrified as a child by some of Baker's adventures. The Antimatter Monster of Zeta Minor remains my favourite, perhaps because it reminds me so much of \"Forbidden Planet\", another old fave. The fact even the Doctor couldn't over-power it and could only placate it always impressed me.\n\nPeter Davison and Colin Baker's era (1981-1986) passed quite quickly when played back-to-back. Davison I actually liked as the Doctor, contra most other Who-nuts. Not much stood out the second time around for Colin Baker's episodes for me - his first runs were never repeated until this point.\n\nSlyvester McCoy's revival (1988-89) was a kind of weird transition between old and new in my mind - first season of the New Who was showing by this time. In the 16 years between them a lot of back-story happened - the Time War/s and so on - but something stylistic survived.\n\nI've never heard the radio-plays, so there's a fair bit of 'canon' I've missed. Some of the old \"Who\" future history has changed too - is the New Who in a parallel time-stream established post Time-War/s?\n\nRe: How is \"City at The End of Time going\"?\n\nDate: 10/22/2007\n\nFrom: Richard Blaber\n\nLocation: Northamptonshire, England\n\nThe old WHOs _were_ great fun - particularly from the mid-1970s, during the Robert Holmes/Philip Hinchcliffe era, with Tom Baker as The Doctor. My favourite episodes are 'Pyramids of Mars' and 'The Talons of Weng-Chiang' (Seasons 13 & 14, available on DVD), both written by Holmes, the former under a nom-de-plume.\n\nDo you have a favourite episode/episodes?\n\nRe: How is\n\nDate: 10/23/2007\n\nFrom: Michael Pine\n\nLocation: Melbourne, Australia\n\nGreg,\n\nthis certainly is great NEWS about City, can't wait for this book to come out.\n\nDo you believe in eBooks ? Or will this only be delivered via good old Paperback/Hardcover.\n\nGood luck with City as well.\n\nRe: How is\n\nDate: 10/24/2007\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nCITY will no doubt be brought out in ebook form by Random House/Del Rey. (They helped put DARWIN'S RADIO and DARWIN'S CHILDREN on the top ten list of ebook bestsellers for a long time.) A lot of my books are also available from eReads, as well as other sources.\n\nRe: How is/ No Teasers\n\nDate: 10/26/2007\n\nFrom: Mike Glosson\n\nLocation: Less Smoky San Diego, California\n\nYou had replied above in the thread:\n\n\"From: Greg Bear\n\nDate: 10/17/2007\n\nNo teasers. Wouldn't want the Time Lords to hear!\"\n\nSo, from what little I've been able to glean from one of your replies and the net, it's definitely gotten me intrigued, and the following just kinda popp'd into my head a few minutes ago:\n\nAll I know is that it is set on earth 100 Trillian years from now, and there's a metaphysical plague that threatens to corrupt all of history.\n\nI visualize a teaser campaign, like maybe along the temporal freeway in Zelazny's ROADMARKS, along the lines of the Billboards along the I-8 in Arizona and then on the I-10, teasing motorists and families driving cross country on vacation, about THE THING. \"What is it?\" We passed it four times, twice in the 1960s, and Twice in the 1970s, and my Dad, whose driving mottos were \"We're burning daylight\" and \"We're making good time\", would Never never never ever stop there, how much we pleaded.\n\nSo I see this Billboard Campaign set up along the upwhen side of THE ROAD, starting just a little past the last exit to Babylon and ending just past the sign that says \"Diaspar before Alvin of Loronei: 600 Million Years\"\n\nWith cryptic hints every 30 million years. I will have to jump back into my study of BEING AND TIME to distract myself.\n\nOn a different note: While the fires are still burning on the mountains, the air cleared out in the city at 1:30 PM today, and temps have dropped back down into the 60s. Breathing isn't as much of a challenge. But's not over yet...\n\nMike\n\nRe: How is\n\nDate: 10/31/2007\n\nFrom: Chris C\n\nLocation: Durban, South Africa\n\nNoooooo not eBooks. I like to go to bed with a good paperback.\n\n:-)\n\nRe: How is/ No Teasers\n\nDate: 11/02/2007\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nSounds like a great campaign--now, can you suggest an advertising firm that will last that long? Good to hear the pollution is subsiding. Lots of friends and family in the area.\n\nRe: How is\n\nDate: 11/02/2007\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nI'm sure there will be a paperback as well, Chris! A nice thick one... Though Sony's new reader looks intriguing. Might have to get one, finally.\n\nRe: How is\n\nDate: 11/06/2007\n\nFrom: Jimmy Kinchloe\n\nLocation: Houston\n\nGreg,\n\nWill you be signing copies of CITY at the University Book Store (like you did with the UK edition of QUANTICO)?\n\nBTW - just purchased a signed 1st of HEGIRA and SLANT, and they are on their way. (Apparently you reissued HEGIRA in hardback in 1988.)\n\nNow, if I could just find PSYCHLONE...\n\nJimmy\n\nRe: How is\n\nDate: 11/06/2007\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nI'll probably be doing a signing at University Bookstore. They've never failed to invite me--even had two signings for QUANTICO!\n\nBig Rip, the Ripper....\n\nDate: 12/03/2007\n\nFrom: Steve Guy\n\nLocation: Adelaide, South Australia\n\nI am not certain about this, but in only a few billion years, won't all the matter in the universe have been torn apart by the Big Rip? If not that, we will have to contend with proton decay in the future as well.\n\nThe story of a civilisation facing the Big Rip might be very interesting!\n\nBig Rip, the Ripper....\n\nDate: 12/05/2007\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nNot quite sure what the Big Rip is--but yes, there are likely lots of strange phenomenon down the road a ways--and lots of opportunities for clever people to do New and Interesting Things.

I'm not into fantasy generally, but I'm really abhor pointless fantasy. How was I enriched or educated in any way by the time I wasted on this book?\n\nHaving said that and having invested the time in the book, I have some suggestions since celebrity and reputation will lure others:\n\n1. Put in a glossary: What the hell is a \"Gape\"? After reading the book, still don't have a clue.\n\n2. Tidy up the conclusion. We invested a lot effort in getting to know your characters and locales and at the end we know what happened to just 4 of them. What of the rest? Did they just cease to exist? End up in the garbage heap? Create their own fantasy universe? Seriously unsatisfying.\n\n3 Explain specific fantasy references: e.g. on page 137 of the 1st Edition there is a reference to \"that dark day of August 9, 1924 in Rheims\". Nothing happened of relevance in our reality on that date/location and nothing is ever revisited in the book to explain what happened in the \"reality\" experienced by Glaucous.\n\nRe: How is\n\nDate: 01/23/2009\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nI suspect a lot of readers found EON confusing as well. No glossary there, either! Some books request a little extra effort as they attempt to plow new land. Sorry this one did not connect for you. But compare the very enthusiastic reaction of other readers... what's a poor author to think?\n\nDarwin's Radio and The Prometheus Myth.\n\nDate: 10/14/2007 From: Richard Blaber\n\nLocation: Northamptonshire, England\n\nYou may remember that I posted an item to this 'blog on 01/31/2004 apropos 'Darwin's Children' which mentioned research showing large numbers of Gulf War Syndrome sufferers in Oregon and their families (85%) and a smaller number of recent-onset schizophrenia sufferers (29%) had evidence of activated HERV, either in the form of antibodies to proteins, or RNA in non-cellular cerebro-spinal fluid.\n\nMy subsequent research has taken me into a number of different fields, but I want to focus on the following: there is a HERV that was once (and still is) a SERV - a Simian Endogenous Retrovirus - rhesus monkeys have it, so do all the primates - and the common ancestor of rhesus monkeys and humans lived a long time ago. Jun-Seop Kim and colleagues at the National Institute of Health, Seoul, South Korea, found it at 20 different locations on 11 different human chromosomes, including the X.\n\nThe name we have given this HERV is SZRV-1: Schizophrenia Related Retrovirus 1. Its GenBank Accession Number, for anyone interested, is AF135487, and it is 2,309 base pairs long. There are 3 other versions, but they are as rare as hen's teeth.\n\nWe all have this virus. But rhesus monkeys, orang-utans, gorillas, chimps and bonobos don't get schizophrenia, and only 45 million of us worldwide suffer from it - which is 45 million too many.\n\nWhich brings me to Julian Jaynes's theory of the origin of consciousness and his concept of the 'bicameral mind', the idea that schizophrenia and creativity may be linked - and that the former may in some way be of net evolutionary benefit, even though it's difficult for us to see how.\n\nIt also brings me to the idea of the 'Palaeolithic Revolution', an idea promulgated by the Stanford University palaeoanthropologist Richard G. Klein, namely that about 40-50,000 years ago, a cognitive revolution took place, which enabled H. sapiens to make the transition to H. sapiens sapiens, paint the Lascaux and Altamira Caves, and ultimately the Sistine Chapel; invent the wheel, make more inventive stone and wooden tools, develop pottery, and eventually develop the science and technology we have today.\n\nIn my view, the Klein and Jaynes theories dovetail perfectly. It seems to me that Klein's 'Palaeolithic Revolution' coincides with the birth of Jaynes' 'bicameral mind', the 'voices' of the brain's right hemisphere whispering or shouting to the left hemisphere and telling it what to do - this made possible because language is possible, social communication and cooperation is possible, and cohesion and control are necessary. (But I refer you to Jaynes' book for a fuller argument.)\n\nWhat sparks the birth, and the Revolution? The activation of SZRV-1, the ancient Teacher of Mankind, whether he is called Prometheus, as in Greek myth, or Raven, as in the stories of the Native Americans of the Pacific NW of the USA, or spoken of in the plural as the 'Fallen Ones' of Genesis 6:4 (see also the pseudepigraphical 1 Enoch 6-8). Why do I call it that? Because I suspect that the activation was caused by early experimentation with hallucinogenic fungus and/or plant materials, such as the ubiquitous (in Eurasia) Psilocybe semilanceata or Amanita muscaria.\n\nIf you smoke dope, take ecstasy and drop acid, you are certainly increasing your risks of developing schizophrenia, especially during adolescence, a period of rapid neural re-organisation. Some of our early ancestors may have found 'magic mushrooms' to their liking, and, like many who have experienced visions in such circumstances, seen their gods (or their demons) for the first time.\n\nAt some point, some individuals in the tribe would have started 'seeing things', as well as 'hearing voices' without the need for the mushrooms, the virus having taken hold. They would have been very valuable - not shunned as mad - but a conduit to the gods, a way of communicating with them, and more importantly, of receiving communications from them - vital, when everything in your world depends on the will of the gods.\n\nI hope you'll forgive this ultra-long posting - but, a plausible hypothesis, do you think? Is SZRV-1 the Prometheus Virus, its 2,309 base pair DNA sequence The Prometheus Code (sounds like the title of a Robert Ludlum novel!)? Prometheus created and taught mankind, and gave him fire, and rescued Deucalion from the Flood, but there was also that nasty business with Pandora's Box! What gave us the edge over the Neanderthals (if Klein is right) may have left us a horrendous legacy of mental illness.\n\nRe: Darwin's Radio and The Prometheus Myth.\n\nDate: 10/15/2007\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nFascinating material and speculations, Richard. I tend to think culture, language, biology and DNA go hand in hand. A part that gets used more often may activate a set of genes--and over time, that set of genes may be multiplied for more efficient production of the necessary substances--proteins and what-have-you (with a more modern emphasis on \"what-have-you\"!). Transposons and retroviruses may contribute to that migration and duplication. But I'm relucant at this point to ascribe the \"opening of the eyes\" to one gene, and I suspect we know very little about mental illness in simians--certainly in the wild. Monkeys with visions are likely to be taken down by predators rather quickly, or perhaps kicked out of the group to die somewhere else. In society, predation of extreme visionaries is still a danger (from fellow humans, more often than not) but not as much of a danger. But it's still a good question: how often do simians in the wild suffer from mental illness?\n\nRe: Darwin's Radio and The Prometheus Myth.\n\nDate: 10/15/2007\n\nFrom: Richard Blaber\n\nLocation: Northamptonshire, England\n\nI am extremely doubtful that any non-human primates suffer, or have ever suffered from, any form of mental illness. I refer you to a report in ABC News' 'News in Science' by Jennifer Viegas of Discovery News, 'Neanderthal brain spared schizophrenia' (Wednesday, 06/13/07), describing findings by Dr Lee Seldon of Monash University, Australia, and Professor Timothy Crow of Oxford University.\n\nI quote from the report:\n\n'[n]eanderthals probably did not possess the cognitive complexities of modern humans so did not suffer from schizophrenia and certain other mental disorders, according to a new theory.\n\nThe theory proposes that language, creativity and many mental diseases are linked, due to the fact that they may originate in the neocortex, as well as the densely cell-packed cortex, located towards the top of the brain.\n\nThese brain regions appear to mature and develop more slowly than other areas.\n\nAlthough there are conflicting claims about possible Neanderthal creative abilities, no direct evidence supports that this extinct human species or subspecies possessed fully fledged grammatical language'.\n\nI believe, although I am not yet in a position to prove, that you cannot be mentally ill without a 'fully fledged grammatical language', and without the possibilities of creativity that are opened up by having the ability to think and communicate using one.\n\nThis, for me, is the very essence of Richard G. Klein's 'Paleolithic Revolution', and what Julian Jaynes was getting at talking about the birth of the 'bicameral mind'. You need grammatico-syntactical language for that, whether we're talking about Nostratic or Proto-Indo-European or whatever. And it didn't happen until 40-50,000 years ago, with the arrival of William Golding's 'Inheritors' in late Pleistocene Europe - the Cro Magnons, after which we have Lascaux, Altamira, the Venus of Willendorf... and so on to the Pyramids, the Parthenon, and everything that followed.\n\nSZRV-1 is not, of course, a gene, but a HERV - a piece of so-called 'junk DNA'. Only today I suddenly thought of an analogy for it - it's a bit like the Black Monolith in '2001: A Space Odyssey', with the magic mushroom-eating Cro Magnons of the Upper Paleolithic substituting for Arthur C. Clarke's chimp-like hominids.\n\nAs for the aliens - they don't come from _outer_ space, but from _inner_ space, and anyone can see them and indeed converse with them (so I'm told, I haven't tried it yet) if they are prepared to partake of certain substances, some of which are legal in the USA. I think that includes Salvia divinorum, but I'm not sure (the active ingredient is Salvinorin A, the most potent naturally occurring hallucinogen). Do take care if and when doing so!\n\nRe: Darwin's Radio and The Prometheus Myth.\n\nDate: 10/16/2007\n\nFrom: Terran\n\nLocation: Winter Park, FL\n\nThose are fascinating ideas, Richard!\n\nRe: Darwin's Radio and The Prometheus Myth.\n\nDate: 10/16/2007\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nClearly, Jane Goodall's murdering mother chimp--she enlisted her daughter to kill and eat the group's babies--was what most people would call psychopathic. A theory that is a string of unproven suppositions--Neanderthals did not have language, language is linked to mental illness, therefore Neaderthals could not have been mentally ill--is dubious at best. Never having met a Neanderthal, I leave that question open. I remind us Cro Magnon types that Neanderthals apparently had brains at least as large as our own, and sometimes larger. (Though brain/body size ratio would make Marmosets the smartest!)\n\nRe: Darwin's Radio and The Prometheus Myth.\n\nDate: 10/17/2007\n\nFrom: Richard Blaber\n\nLocation: Northamptonshire, England\n\nOK, let me simplify the argument down to a couple of presuppositions, rather than a whole set of them. To be mentally ill, you need to have a mind, and specifically, what Julian Jaynes would call a unicameral, or conscious, mind. Non-members of the sub-species homo sapiens sapiens do not (and did not), if I am right, have minds. Therefore non-humans cannot be mentally ill. (Or only humans can be mentally ill, if you want to put it that way.)\n\nGorillas, chimps and bonobos, for example, all have brains, and as you point out, H. neanderthalensis had a larger average brain c.c. than we do. But corvids are remarkably clever in spite of their tiny brain size (they weigh about 10g). But having a brain is not the same thing as having a mind, and brain dysfunction is not the same thing as mental illness. Nor, I would contend, is cognitive or behavioural dysfunction, per se - which would rule out Jane Goodall's 'psychopathic' mother chimpanzee. Human psychopaths aren't mentally ill either, btw, in the judgement of many psychiatrists, which is why when they kill we put them in prison (or execute them, if they're in the US) rather than in psychiatric hospitals.\n\nNo, the cognitive-behavioural dysfunction has to be coupled with a third ingredient if it is to count as mental illness, and that is consciousness. As Julian Jaynes argues, most of what the brain does is unconscious - it is no more conscious than a computer is. It is the small amount that is that's important here, that constitutes the experience of the ego, the conscious self. It's when cognitive-behavioural dysfunction implicates him or her that you have mental illness, be it schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, or whatever.\n\nBut I suspect we will just have to agree to disagree on this issue, because we have a fundamental philosophical disagreement about physical reality. I think there is more to reality than matter, energy, space and time - the things described by the laws of physics and the language of mathematics. After all, where did the laws of physics come from?\n\nAt any rate, you have my very best wishes, and I look forward to reading 'Quantico'. I'm sure it will be an exciting and enjoyable experience.\n\nEon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 07/22/2007 From: Roger Pedersen\n\nLocation: Sandnessjï¿¸en\n\nI watched the winning contribution of the CG-Contest and I must say that I was impressed. An eventual \"Eon\"-adaption would do best as an CG-animated affair like \"Final Fantasy\" (or a hybrid-affair like \"Sky Captain\").\n\nWhat do you think,Greg?\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 07/22/2007\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nCould be very good. With some exceptions, however, these CG animated theatrical features aren't much cheaper than their real-life counterparts!\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 07/22/2007\n\nFrom: Roger Pedersen\n\nLocation: Sandnessjï¿¸en\n\nTrue.. but CG does tend to get cheaper for each day that goes by, since the technology (computers and such) also gets cheaper to buy and utilitize.\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 07/22/2007\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nAs shown by these wonderful short films. But there's still quite a distance between a theatrical effort and a lower-rez picture. A few more years, though--and who knows?\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 07/23/2007\n\nFrom: Roger Pedersen\n\nLocation: Sandnessjï¿¸en\n\nExactly.. Who knows?\n\nAnd it doesn't even have to be years.. Maybe just one or two years..\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 10/05/2007\n\nFrom: jofa\n\nLocation: uk\n\nToo much cgi would cheapen eon - in much the same way later (or is that earlier?) star wars films were spoiled with too many effects. To me it's more a story about the human condition. Thistledown can be created using locations and organic materials as can the way and the axis colonies. The difference in cost would be small price to pay.\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 10/06/2007\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nBut CGI is about the only way a film like this can be made now. Not that it's cheaper--\n\nStill, it would be interesting to do an old-fashioned big-budget production, with stop-motion animation and Albert Whitlock matte paintings and model work... Might even be a selling point! (But I'm not so sure an old-fashioned production would ever be considered \"green...\")\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 10/06/2007\n\nFrom: Roger Pedersen\n\nLocation: Sandnessjï¿¸en\n\nI do agree with Jofa that too much CG would cheapen the production, the CG should not be made just for the sake of CG but to help create and tell the story. Just like all other special effects..\n\nBut I also do agree with you that CG might be the only way that EON can be realized.. Maybe you should contact JMS and his team for help (Just look at Lost Tales.. Great graphics which looks incredibly lifelike)\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 10/09/2007\n\nFrom: jofa\n\nLocation: uk\n\nSorry Mr B. You are the creator of this environment. It's true - many of the scapes would need elements of cgi but I can't see that that realism would ever be recreated faithfully using computer modelling alone in the next 10-20 years. As far as green issues are concerned would it really be better to burn up tonnes of energy using processor power?\n\nThere is of course a heavy sci-fi nature in the series but your writing is very strong on dialogue and emotion. What I love about eon it that it could be framed in any eon. The Naderite environments could be faithfully recreated in modern day London. The frant world could be rurual New Zealand/Australia? Flawships can be made of metal. Axis city would need cgi but many of the key visuals almost need an old fashioned approach. Not Terry Gilliam but something similar.\n\nAnyway I'll bog off now. Sorry.\n\nNominate me an section and give me a fortnight and I'll write you some incidental music??\n\nJJ\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 10/15/2007\n\nFrom: James Foley Jr\n\nLocation: Grand Rapids, MI\n\nI stumbled upon the video while searching for other things and got really excited after seeing the what has been done... now I am dissapointed to find that this is all there is.\n\nI am a sci-fi/sci-fantasy junky. I read all the books I can lay hands on. I eagerly await the release of the full length video of EON.\n\nPeople tend to nit-pick projects like Star Wars... too much happening, etc. Look at the videos and see a graphic representation of an imagined \"real\" world with a population going about its daily life as recorded by the fantasy camera. What is to nit-pick? CGI has only made movies better. Some people should try suspending disbelief and just enjoy it for entertainment value. After the 14th viewing, I might pick a nit about something but still find it enjoyable to watch.\n\nGreg, here is a vote that you go with the movie/video project!\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 10/16/2007\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nThe only problem I have with CGI is we no longer need vast sets and huge armies of extras and real airplanes and that sort of thing. I like spectacle!\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 11/14/2007\n\nFrom: Richard Stephens\n\nLocation: Manchester, UK\n\nI got to the CG Challenge site through Wikipedia, of all places. I read Eon years ago and still cherish my trade paperback of it, a wonderful book.\n\nI too was initially so excited (and a bit surprised) at the prospect of an EON movie, only to have those hopes somewhat dashed. Nevertheless, the trailers etc were top notch in most respects (although the shape of Thistledown was all wrong in the winning trailer) and very beautiful shorts in their own right.\n\nMaybe some studio or other will find the courage to realsie this as a theatrical movie some day...\n\nBTW, I agree with both sides of the CG debate here. Too much CG can make a movie look cheap if it's over-done just for the sake of it, witness SW Eps I-III, but used appropriately, and provided it's of sufficiently high quality, it would be the only way to do a lot of the Eon story properly. Well, short of actually getting Juno into Earth orbit and starting to dig...\n\nAnyhow, fingers crossed..\n\nRich\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 11/14/2007\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nSaw TRANSFORMERS recently--enjoyable film, with astonishing CGI, particularly with regard to clarity, complexity, and the textures and optics of surfaces.

I think anything less would probably reduce the feeling of space and power of the previous occupants.\n\nI think the problem with CGI in a lot of other SciFi movies is not a matter of the usage of CGI, it's the content - I'm very much over SF movies (and books, for that matter) that constantly portray aliens as 'baddies' and use the CGI to over emphasise the blood and gore. For this reason (or lack thereof, as the case actually is) Contact is one of my favourite all time SF movies: I'd be extremely happy for 'Eon' to take over that place!\n\nKeep up the great work, Greg - I love all your books, particularly what you did with the Foundation series - Dr Asimov would have been more than happy!\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 10/24/2008\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nThere's been sporadic interest in LA, and the book is circulating--but the focus is still on THE FORGE OF GOD and ANVIL OF STARS.

The more you write, the better you get.\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 08/07/2011\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nStill talking with interested parties, Mike. Wish us luck!\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 08/30/2011\n\nFrom: Sean\n\nLocation: South Africa\n\nI am an avid fan of scifi, in fact I have an entire bookshelf reserved only for this genre and am busy filling my second one, and as mentioned above there are only a very few movies that even begin to come anywhere close to \"good\". I have been holding my breath for the last couple of years since I first read the book for a movie and will continue to do so. It is one of my all time favorite books and I tend to reread it about once a year. I kept an eye out when the CG challenge did the compo for Eon, and there I loved some of the interpretations. I wish I'd had the ability to take part, but unfortunately I am CG challenged. Please keep up the talks.\n\nAlways inspired\n\nSean\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 09/13/2011\n\nFrom: Andy Houghton\n\nLocation: Romford, London\n\nLike the last few posts I stumbled across this whilst looking for news about an Eon movie. I have just finished reading Eternity, which is also excellent, and easier to read than Eon i found, some of Eon goes straight over my head. But they are both excellent stories.\n\nI just wish someone would bring them to the screen. Big preferably, but a small screen miniseries would also be amazing.\n\nGood luck Mr Bear, and any news??\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 09/25/2011\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nWill do, Sean! Thanks.\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 09/25/2011\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nStill working on it! No firm news yet. Thanks, Andy.\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 10/30/2011\n\nFrom: SkeedR\n\nLocation: UK\n\nI've just come across this and as it's been a while, how're the talks going Mr Bear? I'd love to see a well done film adaptation of EON. I'm certain it'd even blow away Transformers (The first, the second and third... :meh:). Also, great books (EON, Forge of God and their sequels).\n\nSkeedR\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 12/07/2011\n\nFrom: Herve\n\nLocation: Lorraine, France\n\nI am reading Eon for the second time (first time i was 16 yo, now 33), and still enjoying it as a true \"chef d'oeuvre\".\n\nWhereas billions of $ and huge amount of CGI are spent in some poor movies or remakes, The Way is still waiting for a producer, and we, readers, are still waiting for the movie...what a mess...did James Cameron ever pay attention to Olmy and Patricia's adventures ?\n\nNevertheless, please Greg receive my sincere thanks for the good times they give.\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 01/16/2012\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nNothing new or exciting at the moment. Occasional perks of interest! Thanks, SkeedR.\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 01/17/2012\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nThanks, Herve! I think we're actually in a golden age of sf and fantasy films. That doesn't mean some more good ones can't be made!\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 03/17/2012\n\nFrom: Justas R.\n\nLocation: Lithuania\n\nI'm a young filmmaker, working on my first feature now. I'm reading EON now and if nobody will adapt it in next decades I will definitely do this because it became my new dream to put this story into the screen. Thank you, Greg, for sharing it with the world.\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 04/07/2012\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nGood to hear from you, Justas! We have a good many friends in the Lithuanian community here in Seattle. Let me know when your first feature is ready--I'll keep my eye out for it, and pass along the word to our friends here.\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 10/22/2013\n\nFrom: darach b\n\nLocation: Bay Area\n\nAny new news on film adaption of EON/Eternity?\n\nI first read EON back in 1992 and re-read it every 5 years or so (as well Eternity).\n\nSince Hollywood is so lacking in original material at the moment (remakes of almost everything, apart from LOTR etc), isn't it time for EON/Eternity to be made into a film series. I would love to see the Stone/Way in IMAX...\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 10/24/2013\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nAs would I, darach!\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 05/17/2014\n\nFrom: Ewan Morrell\n\nLocation: South Island, New Zealand\n\nI've just finished reading Eon for the second time, (first time was 20 years ago), what a stunning achievement the book is. I would love to see it made into a movie or series. Still trying to get my head around the space-time twisting concept of all of it. Thank you for writing a great book.\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 05/17/2014\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nThank you, Ewan! I haven't quite managed the geometry myself. Twists me in pretzels!\n\nEon movie (did some one say it was a series of books?)\n\nDate: 06/21/2014\n\nFrom: Graham Lee\n\nLocation: Nevermore\n\nHi there Greg, you are one of the most amazing authors (sorry, Robert Jordan gets the top spot)\n\nI borrowed this book from a friend of mine about 10 years ago (never returned it)\n\nand i only just started reading it last night... im on chapter 2 SPOILERS AHEAD!!!\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nThe part where Gary is in his office after doing gymnastics in the *Stone*...\n\nok... this has been going on for some 7 years now... PLEASE can you turn this into a film? this is soooo amazing!!!\n\nand it CAN be done with live action (just look at *Red Planet* or w/e it was called with Gary Sinise or what ever his name was)\n\nALSO near the top of the page i saw someone mention that Eon was a *series* of books??? or was that my misunderstanding?\n\nAlso Gary, do you have any similar books in circulation???\n\nThanks\n\nEon movie (did some one say it was a series of books?)\n\nDate: 07/18/2014\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nHello, Graham!\n\nThanks for the kind words. After the novellas, \"The Wind from a Burning Woman,\" and \"The Way of All Ghosts\" (both available in my collected stories) comes LEGACY, EON, and ETERNITY. That completes the series--so far!\n\nGreg\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 10/15/2014\n\nFrom: John Seldon\n\nLocation: Bristol, United Kingdom\n\nI started reading through the sci-fi masterworks recently and was pleased to see Eon included in the list. I first read Eon in my late teens (I'm 41 now) and it totally blew me away, as did Eternity. Reading them again now and they are just as good.\n\nI was kind of hoping this would have been optioned by now, but sadly not. I think it would probably be better as a TV series rather than a film, as films often tend to lack the detail of a book.\n\nWhen I read Eon originally, Legacy hadn't been written, so I'm going to read that next.\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption... or while we are waiting......\n\nDate: 11/04/2014\n\nFrom: Martin Dean\n\nLocation: Mauritius (temporarily) UK (ordinarily)\n\nI too would love to see EON as a movie and cannot believe this thread has been active for 7 years!\n\nWhen you look at the rubbish that actually does get made, it is a great shame that this series has not been snapped up.\n\nMEANWHILE... I was wondering if you have considered another novel... beyond Eternity.\n\nOlmy is on the Frant world; Tapi has only just been born, Suli is on Earth and I am certain that Gary, Ry Oyu and Mirsky would love to take on some new pan-universe struggle, even with some Jarts providing support...?\n\nThis Sparks another thought... what about crowd-sourcing a story plot? Allow the great unwashed to propose storylines and to carry out voting, then build a book on the result. No money should change hands, perhaps a credit in the afterword for the storymongers....\n\nToo wacky?\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption... or while we are waiting......\n\nDate: 11/11/2014\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nVery interesting ideas, Martin! Who knows where all this will go? Thanks!\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 11/11/2014\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nWe've got good people working hard on these projects, and EON is one of the major projects being worked on! Wish us luck, John. And check out the MOSF Thistledown model video, listed at the top of the home page.\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 11/25/2014\n\nFrom: Ward Whittaker\n\nLocation: An Aussie in Brazil\n\nI must weigh in here. I can not believe that a book as rich as EON has not yet been made into a movie. I has to be done, and with a decent budget and big name stars. Can anybody tell me why this has not yet happened ?\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 11/25/2014\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nMAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE and FOUNDATION have just been announced, one at Amazon, the other at HBO. Sometimes good books take time to get adapted! Let's hope EON gets done sooner than Isaac's classic.\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 03/04/2015\n\nFrom: Olivier Lahaye\n\nLocation: France\n\nStill waiting for an EON Movie. No way?\n\nThat would be a real blockbuster especially if it's filmed by BSG Movie maker for example.\n\nI want that film in 3D UHD if possible :-) The book is one of the best SciFi book I've ever read.\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 03/05/2015\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nThanks, Oliver. The Way in 3D would be pretty cool.\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 05/08/2015\n\nFrom: Ron Theunissen\n\nLocation: Whitby, Ontario, Canada\n\nEon still remains one of my all-time favourite books. I would LOVE to see it on the screen one day. But it's such a rich story that a TV miniseries might be the best option to ensure that the story remains intact.\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 06/10/2015\n\nFrom: Derek Roen\n\nLocation: Phoenix Az\n\nEon as a movie would be GREAT! I've been wishing that for a long time. Just started Hull Zero Three. I love how I have no idea what could happen next while reading your stories.\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 06/10/2015\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nSeems to be happening to books I've loved more and more often--like THE MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE. Fingers crossed!\n\nRe: Eon - eventual movie-adaption\n\nDate: 06/15/2015\n\nFrom: Greg Bear\n\nThanks, Derek!"
