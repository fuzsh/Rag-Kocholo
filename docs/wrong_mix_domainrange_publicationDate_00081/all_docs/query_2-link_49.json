Lotta wrote the songs, played the guitar and sang. Uffe Larsen played the bass. The bandÂ´s first drummer was Anders Persson, later on it was Jesper MÃ¥rtensson (Apa state mental). How ever, on this specific recording two danish guest drummers did the job. The album was intitially produced by Billy Cross (Dylans former guitarist), but in the end the american producer Mohawk had his final word in the matter. This album is no longer for sale and thereÂ´s just a few private copies left of it. So this is the only place you can hear it!\n\nGenre\n\nrock\n\nContains tracks\n\nX Marks The Spot/ba-ba-loo by Margit Music\n\npublished on 2011-04-27T09:03:23Z\n\nBusy Bee by Margit Music\n\npublished on 2011-04-27T09:03:24Z\n\n16 Tones Of Anger by Margit Music\n\npublished on 2011-04-27T09:03:24Z\n\nSandy Long by Margit Music\n\npublished on 2012-08-28T12:51:48Z"
