        "text": "Mary Amelia is born to Caroline and Charles Ingalls on her father’s birthday, January 10, in Pepin, Wisconsin. Her birthplace is The Little House in the Big Woods.\n\nThe Ingalls family settles on land not yet open for homesteading (near present-day Independence, Kansas). Laura records the experience in The Little House on the Prairie.\n\nThe family is forced by the government to leave their homestead in the Indian Territory. They return to Wisconsin to stay with family.\n\nThe family travels west to create a new home On the Banks of Plum Creek, near Walnut Grove, Minnesota. They live first in a sod house and then in a house of “sawed lumber.”\n\nDevastated by repeated crop failure, the Ingalls sell the farm and move to Burr Oak, Iowa, where Pa and Ma help manage a hotel. Freddie dies on August 27. Laura never writes about this period.\n\nIn the spring, Mary is seriously ill. Laura called it scarlet fever in her books, but modern research suggests it was meningoencephalitis, possibly caused by a bite from a tick or mosquito. “It settled in her eyes,” Laura wrote, “and Mary was blind.”\n\nPa accepts a job with the railway and the Ingalls family moves to South Dakota. Ma and the girls make the trip by train. The family stays through the winter in the surveyor’s house By the Shores of Silver Lake. In the spring, the family moves to its homestead land, a mile north of De Smet, South Dakota. This is the final move for Charles and Caroline.\n\nThe Dakota Territory pays for sixteen-year-old Mary Ingalls to attend the Iowa College for the Blind in Vinton, Iowa. She enrolls on November 23.\n\nCharles Ingalls gives up the farming life. He builds his family a spacious new house on Third Street, in De Smet, and works as a carpenter.\n\nMary goes to a Chicago hospital for an operation to relieve pain from neuralgia. Laura and Almanzo Wilder leave South Dakota, first for Florida and then for Missouri. They remain in Missouri the rest of their lives.\n\nAfter attending college and teaching for a few years, Grace marries Nathan Dow, a farmer from the neighboring town of Manchester. They have no children.\n\nCharles Ingalls dies of heart failure on June 8 in De Smet. His wife and his daughters are with him.\n\nAfter a flourishing career as a printer and publisher in South Dakota, Carrie Ingalls marries a prosperous, middle-aged widower named David Swanzey. She raises his two children but has none of her own. The family lives in the Black Hills, at the base of Mount Rushmore. Caroline sells the Third Street home to Mary for “$1 and all the affection in the world.”"
