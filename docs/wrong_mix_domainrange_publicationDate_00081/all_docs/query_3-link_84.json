        "text": "SKARDU, Pakistan: A hidden pearl that attracts adventure-lovers worldwide is nestled amidst the majestic mountains of Skardu and Shigar.\n\nBlind Lake, also known as Jarba Zhou Lake, is a captivating destination that offers a unique blend of natural beauty and thrill for those seeking an extraordinary experience.\n\nLocated in District Shigar, Blind Lake is conveniently accessible, just a 30-minute drive from Skardu city. Situated en route to the Shigar district, this pristine lake is a well-kept secret, awaiting discovery by intrepid travelers. One of the most remarkable aspects of Blind Lake is its diverse terrain. Curiously, Blind Lake derives its name from its unique characteristics.\n\nUnlike many lakes with flowing water, Blind Lake remains tranquil and doesn’t exhibit a clear water supply or discharge source. This sense of stillness and isolation has led to the endearing moniker “Blind Lake,” making it a distinctive destination that invites exploration and reverence.\n\nWhen you visit this place, local people share exciting stories with the visitors about why this lake is called ‘Blind,’ which adds to the mystery of the lake. For example, while swimming in the lake, one person shared with WE News that there is a blind well in one place in the lake, which is why it is called the blind lake.\n\nMushtaq Hassan, a Shigar resident who offers a paid boat trip to the lake to the visitor, told this WE news, “There are many exciting stories behind the name of this lake. The fish in this lake are blind in one eye, so it is called a blind Lake.”\n\nVisitors can take captivating walks along sandy shores, traverse rocky landscapes, and revel in the lush green grass. The lake’s picturesque setting is a harmonious blend of mountains and the famous Sarfaranga Skardu cold desert, making it a visual spectacle for all who venture here.\n\nHowever, what truly sets Blind Lake apart is its location along the legendary route of K-2, the world’s second-highest mountain. This connection to the iconic peak adds an extra layer of allure to the lake, attracting adventurers and mountaineers alike.\n\nDespite the absence of a direct water source, the great Indus River is believed to be the primary contributor to Blind Lake’s water supply. The lake is nestled between the Indus River on one side and the Shigar River on the other, making it a vital part of this region’s natural landscape.\n\nDistrict Shigar, home to numerous eight-thousands, including the renowned K-2, is a haven for outdoor enthusiasts. The area offers many opportunities for mountaineering, hiking, trekking, camping, and various other adventure sports.\n\nMushtaq Hussain, a visitor from Islamabad, shared that “Blind Lake in Shigar Valley Skardu is an alluring getaway that promises life-changing experiences and a close connection with the pristine beauties of Pakistan’s northern region for adventurers, nature lovers, and those longing for a glimpse of unadulterated grandeur.”\n\nHe added that the journey to Blind Lake may pose a slight challenge, but the breathtaking surroundings and captivating vistas make every step worthwhile. Diverse landscapes and awe-inspiring views constantly captivate and rejuvenate weary travelers.\n\nThe lake’s charm is enhanced by lush green trees, which also help to calm the soul. The lake truly lives up to its reputation as a hidden gem due to the tranquilly surroundings and the stunning scenery."
