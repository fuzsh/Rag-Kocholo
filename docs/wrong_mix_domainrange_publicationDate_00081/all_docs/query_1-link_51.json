        "text": "How many years have you been in publishing?\n\nThree years and counting.\n\nHow did you first get published?\n\nI feel happy that I got an offer from the client which is a sweet start for me.\n\nDo you illustrate full-time?\n\nYep, I am a full-time illustrator. I worked as a concept artist at an animation studio before becoming a freelance illustrator. I spent many years exploring different paths, including teaching, working in the wild, picking fruit, and growing avocados. These are the things that inspire me to keep creating. After my last job at the capsicum greenhouse, I started drawing again, and a few months later, I got a chance to draw my first picture book.\n\nWhat inspires you to create picture books?\n\nI love books! Children's picture books have always been one of my favorite books to collect. Maybe it counts as one of the reasons? :D\n\nWhat surprised you the most working as an illustrator?\n\nI think illustrating a book is something I never dreamed of! I love how my art came out on the spreads and tells a story with the colors. Currently, I want to create more lovely picture books and it is one of my big goals!\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about being an illustrator?\n\nCreating things and enjoying what I’m doing.\n\nWhat do you find difficult working as an illustrator?\n\nCreating things and enjoying what I’m doing. Yep, the same answer as the previous question. I have to admit nothing I enjoy is easy, which is why I feel more fulfilled every time I complete a challenging task.\n\nWhat do you do to shake the rust off or get new ideas?\n\nI do other things. Writing, baking, traveling, and hopping into a nice cafe for food and good vibes. And, I play games and badminton sports!\n\nAnything you are habitual about when it comes to creativity?\n\nMost of the time, I will set a goal first before the creativity comes to life, like planning what value I want to bring out, or how the arts would affect others. Then, I sketch the idea and also research it.\n\nWhere do you live?\n\nI currently live North of Boston. I love that our home is a short drive to the ocean, a short drive to the mountains, a short drive to the city, and a lovely place to be snowed in and not drive at all.\n\nWhen did you know you wanted to write picture books?\n\nI’ve always loved art and books and storytelling and working with children, but it took me some time to realize that I could be the storyteller.\n\nAfter my youngest daughter was born, I had some health things that needed sorting. It was unfun to say the least, but because of that, I was reminded that I needed to care for me. Self-care can look like many different things for many different people but most importantly it includes feeding the soul. So, when I saw a posting for an event at my local bookstore, Whitelam Books, titled “So You Want to Write a Children’s Book?” and my brain answered back I think I do, I made sure to listen. I attended the panel discussion, and that was it. It was as though a piece of me fell into place that I didn’t know was missing. I’ve been writing for children ever since.\n\nTell us about your road to publication, what did that involve for you?\n\nBRAVE LIKE MOM was not written with the intention of publication. I wrote it when I heard my sister-in-law was not well enough to go for a chemo treatment. I just opened up the notes app on my phone and started writing. She improved and I didn’t look at it again for over a year. Then the story became something to tool around with while I grieved a really strong woman. Eventually the purpose of working on the story became something bigger than working through my emotions. I started to believe that maybe it could help others as well.\n\nLuckily, Kaitlyn, my now agent felt the same way when she read it. It is the story that got her attention and the first story we sold together. There were some changes along the way. At first the story was specifically about cancer and it was reworked to be broader. The other big change was the title, with 100% credit going to Andrea, the brilliant editor.\n\nCan you share a bit about your process?\n\nI like to juggle a few projects so I can move onto to something else when I get stuck. I dedicate my one day a week when I do not work but the kids are in school to writing and writing related activities. This is not enough time, lol, so I also work in what I call writing in the nooks and crannies of life. I might outline a new idea in the waiting room at gymnastics or run to the library to read mentor texts in between soccer drop off and pick-up.\n\nWhen I write, I like to do quite a bit of pre-writing time where I let the idea grow into a story in my mind before I set pen to paper. And once I have something that resembles a story, I have a wonderful support group of critique partners that help me as I mold it into what it can be.\n\nWhat do you do to shake the rust off or get new ideas?\n\nI am a huge fan of Tara Lazar’s Storystorm which gets me to start off the year with at least 30 possible ideas. Some are winners, some, like “an ode to cheese,” are not. But anytime the well is dry, I can visit that page in my notes app and pull on an idea. I also add to the list throughout the year. It is quite helpful that I am raising children and work with young children as well. They keep me fresh.\n\nAnything you can’t live without while you write?\n\nTea. Currently I’m obsessed with vanilla chai tea.\n\nAny authors and/or illustrators who inspire you?\n\nSo many. Rajani LaRocca is such a power house. Tara Lazar is a gem in the picture book world. Pat Zietlow Miller has taught me so much in her books and through her webinars. Ame Dykeman cracks me up and makes storytelling seem effortless. Jane Yolen for her tenacity. Just to name a few.\n\nDream project to work on?\n\nI’m living the dream. I think my dream project will always be the next one.\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about being an author?\n\nTo see how the illustrator interprets the story in her perspective. The text and the illustrations are equally important to making a picture book. For this book, Julie and I mainly collaborated through our editor Naomi Krueger. During the phase of character design, Naomi asked me to share some photos of my grandma with Julie for inspiration. My parents in China helped me. They went through stacks of family albums and dug out some old photos of me at about 5 years old, which drew me back to sweet memories with my grandma and grandpa. I almost cried tears of joy to see the little girl that Julie drew, with my name on a children’s book representing Chinese culture! I am so incredibly grateful that I got to work with Julie on this book.\n\nWhat do you find difficult working as an author?\n\nThe most challenging part of writing is definitely revising. In considering so many different ways to revise my work, I always want to ensure revisions set out to strengthen the story and make it more appealing to a broad audience while staying true to my heart. Sometimes it’s best to shelve the manuscript for a little while to gain a fresh perspective and new ideas before reworking the story.\n\nWhat do you do to shake the rust off or get new ideas?\n\nRead books, watch movies, go to museums, and keep eyes open for daily delights. I believe creativity is the ability of one’s brain to connect common things in an uncommon way.\n\nCan you share a positive experience you’ve had in the Kid Lit community?\n\nI’ve had so many positive experiences in the Kid Lit community. It’s a safe place to share your good or or not so good news, ask for advice or help, seek critique and feedback. Kid Lit authors and friends are always there to offer their knowledge and help and lift each other up.\n\nRecommended reading?\n\nHere are some of my favorite new books, So Not Ghoul by Karen Yin, illustrated by Bonnie Lui, The School of Failure by Rosie J. Pova, illustrated by Monika Filipina, Anzu the Great Kaiju by Benson Shum, Hana Hsu and the Ghost Crab Nation by Sylvia Liu, and Abuelita and I Make Flan by Adriana Hernández Bergstrom.\n\nWhat has been the highlight of your career thus far?\n\nI have achieved some milestones along the way. I got nominated by Publishers Weekly as one of the honorees of Publishers Weekly Star Watch as the associate publisher of Yeehoo Press. Recently TOFU TAKES TIME got a starred review from School Library Journal. I’ll keep it up!\n\nWhat is something you wish someone had told you when you first started writing?\n\nIt takes years of hard work to make your book to be seen, and make yourself to be seen.\n\nWhat’s up next for you?\n\nMy next picture book, LONG GOES TO DRAGON SCHOOL, illustrated by Mae Besom, will be published by Yeehoo Press in February 2023. Inspired by my experience as a minority immigrant student, this picture book follows a Chinese dragon who struggles to breathe fire in his new Western dragon school, only to discover he must carve his own path to finding a sense of belonging. Wrapped in Eastern and Western dragon lore, this fantasy tale celebrates perseverance, self-acceptance, and cultural differences.\n\nAnything else you’d like to share with aspiring authors and illustrators?\n\nRead other picture books and learn about what’s out in the market. Take picture book writing classes. Find a critique group and get feedback on your stories. Revise, revise, revise. Most importantly, keep writing and keep going.\n\nAnd last, but not least, favorite 80s movie?\n\nMy Neighbor Totoro. I’m a huge fan of Studio Ghibli.\n\nDo you write full-time?\n\nI consider writing to be my full-time job, but my two young kiddos would disagree with me.\n\nWhat inspires you to create picture books?\n\nI adore reading and the joy it brings me and I want to write books that will spark these feelings in children. My inspiration comes from my kids, things I read, conversations with friends and family, and the inspiration fairy who visits me on sleepless nights (OK, there’s no fairy, but I really do have ideas just pop into my head out of nowhere in the middle of the night).\n\nWhat surprised you the most working as an author?\n\nTwo things surprised me: how long it sometimes takes between acquisition and release, and how difficult it can be to deal with constant rejection.\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about being an author?\n\nFor me, one of the best things is when I’m writing in rhyme and struggling to get my idea across and I finally find the perfect sequence of words that fit the meter and rhyme perfectly.\n\nWhat do you find difficult working as an author?\n\nThe biggest struggle is writing something that I believe in and think is great and then having other people not get it.\n\nWhat do you do to shake the rust off or get new ideas?\n\nIf I’m really out of ideas, I’ll turn to my favorite picture books and try to get an idea from them (I’ll look at things like the structure and topic and try to come up with my own story to go with that).\n\nAnything you are habitual about when it comes to creativity?\n\nI have an idea notebook and any time I have a new idea (even if it’s just a title or a character name) I’ll jot it down to come back to later. Each idea gets its own page so I have some space for brainstorming or to record everything I’ve thought of so far. If I think of an idea in the middle of the night, I’ll write it in the notes app on my phone. Then I transfer it to my notebook in the morning (or the next time I open the app).\n\nCan you share a positive experience you’ve had in the Kid Lit community?\n\nI wound up starting a low-key book promo group with a few other debut authors and what I love is that even though most of us didn’t really know each other to begin with, we immediately became really supportive of each other. It’s nice to not be alone!\n\nRecommended reading?\n\nMy favorite picture book right now is Bodies Are Cool by Tyler Feder. It’s hopeful, uplifting, and makes me smile every time I read it.\n\nWhat has been the highlight of your career thus far?\n\nSo far it’s tied between opening the first email from my editor where she asked if Moonlight Prance was still available and opening the second email from my editor where she wrote with the news that Chronicle wanted to acquire Moonlight Prance and a companion title (I printed this email out, framed it, and put it on my desk).\n\nWhat is something you wish someone had told you when you first started writing?\n\nI wish someone had told me how hard it is to let a story go when there’s no interest in it.\n\nWhere do you live?\n\nI live in Geneva, Illinois, which is 30 miles west of Chicago, where suburbia ends and pumpkin patches begin.\n\nWhen did you know you wanted to write picture books?\n\nWhen I was in kindergarten, I joined my first writer’s group at my local elementary school. At the Young Authors Club, I worked on developing ideas and turning them into picture books. I was hooked! There were lots of clues along the way, leading me back to this first love, but I really started working on my craft seriously about five years ago, in 2016.\n\nTell us about your road to publication, what did that involve for you?\n\nMy road to publication was a little windy at first. As I was learning the craft, I played around and experimented a lot. But the stories that always seemed to connect most with others were those inspired by emotions and experiences that I lived through first-hand. I met my agent, Stephanie Hansen, at a live pitch session in 2017. The story that I pitched her that day never sold, but it jumpstarted a wonderful relationship. After a kidlit author friend suggested that I lean into telling my family’s story, I gave that a go and found it to be so natural and powerful! My debut, DANCING WITH DADDY, illustrated by Ziyue Chen, is very much based on my family life. That story went on submission in 2018 and sold within a couple of months. I cannot say enough good things about my editor, Kelsey Skea, and the Two Lions team! The entire experience has been a total dream come true.\n\nCan you share a bit about your process?\n\nFor me, a new idea usually arrives unexpectedly, like a colorful string just outside my door. I pick it up and twirl it around a bit, to see what it wants to be. Then, with an idea in my mind, I start pulling that string. I pull and pull and loop and weave until something starts to take shape. I will not stop until I run out of string or hit a nasty snag. Most of the time, I’m writing at my kitchen table. But if the string is still coming while I’m out driving my daughters to therapy or soccer or piano, I will not hesitate to write in parking garages, parking lots or someone’s driveway. My laptop never leaves my side!\n\nWhat do you do to shake the rust off or get new ideas?\n\nI am in three critique groups, and one of the things that keeps me from getting stuck is sharing stories with these three groups in separate waves. I send my first polished draft to one group. When the story is a little further along, I’ll send it to the second group. When it’s close to polished and final, I’ll send it to the third group. That way, I’m always inching a story forward, toward becoming the best story it can be, but also getting fresh eyes at every step along the way.\n\nI get a lot of new ideas from my three daughters and from tuning into the things that I love and make me tick. I also received great advice at a writing conference once: To think of something that you really want to impart or share with someone in your life. I’ve found that concepts conceived in this way have a built-in audience and point of view and an emotional clarity that never wavers – a true north.\n\nAnything you can’t live without while you write?\n\nBlack coffee or green tea and peanut butter spoons topped with mini M&Ms. If you’ve never tried this, I warn you: It’s life changing and dangerously good.\n\nAny authors and/or illustrators who inspire you?\n\nSo many! I love picture books by Margarita Engle, Kelly DiPucchio, Pat Zietlow Miller, and Kelly Starling Lyons. They always choose the perfect and most-poignant words and grab hold of your heart. I also love everything that illustrators Marla Frazee, Cindy Derby, Corinna Luyken, and Sophie Blackall create.\n\nDream project to work on?\n\nThere is a middle grade story inside me, about small-town life, sister bonds, and magical circumstances that I keep noodling. I’d love to figure that story out. There is so much I want to say about what it’s like growing up with big dreams, hungry for an artistic outlet, all the while wrestling with a love + disdain for the isolating endless rows of corn and soybeans. It keeps swirling in the grain bins of my mind. Someday…\n\nWhere do you live?\n\nI live in Northern Utah in a place called Cache Valley that offers mountain views in all directions.\n\nWhen did you know you wanted to write picture books?\n\nIn elementary school one of my teachers introduced our class to book-making. She brought us through the creation of our own books. We developed our story ideas, created first and final drafts with illustrations, and then bound the whole book together with stitching between cardboard covers that were decorated with wallpaper. Before that experience I had never thought about how books (which I loved!) were written and created. I became hooked and started making my own books at home. I still have a couple of them.\n\nTell us about your road to publication, what did that involve for you?\n\nIt began about 25 years ago when an author Jim Fergus reached out while I was finishing my MS at Colorado State University. He wanted someone to collaborate with him on a natural history guide of Rocky Mountain National Park, and I had spent 2 years doing research there. Although Jim eventually stepped away from that project to focus on One Thousand White Women, the spark for publication had been reignited by writing for him and receiving his praise and encouragement. I went on to find Utah writing events led by the late Rick Walton and Carol Lynch Williams, as well as SCBWI. Over the years I took classes, attended conferences, and developed an appreciation for the friendships I made along the way. Currently I’m associated with four major groups: SCBWI, Julie Hedlund’s PB 12x12, Bethany Hegedus’s The Writing Barn, and WIFYR, which continue to offer education and support. I’ve had articles, poems, and stories published in the educational market, and even ventured into self-publishing when ebooks became popular. In 2019 a submission opportunity through a writing event with my Utah/Idaho chapter of SCBWI captured the interest of an editor at Albert Whitman, and the rest fell into place.\n\nCan you share a bit about your process?\n\nEach day I schedule my writing time based on the list of chores or work that needs to get done. Based on the length of that list, I decide how much time I’ll put toward writing in the morning. Depending on how well the muse is cooperating, the to-do list might get truncated. Aside from my hours dedicated to teaching, my writing time has become the priority. Chores and to-do’s come second. Getting dinner on the table (now that I’m an empty nester), third. As for writing, I often start with a mental image. Chicken Frank, Dinosaur! started with a funny image from Jack Horner’s Ted Talk video about the connection between birds and dinosaurs. Once I have an idea, I decide on setting and the type of feeling it evokes. Then I focus on character—what the character wants and what obstacles stand in the way of getting it. Lastly, free-writing allows voice to emerge. Once I have the initial scenes down, I let the story sit for a few days before coming back to finish it. Feedback from critique partners over a several month period refines the story even more until I feel it’s ready to submit.\n\nWhat do you do to shake the rust off or get new ideas?\n\nAny sort of outdoor activity helps: walking, gardening, hiking, floating on a lake in summer…. Because I love the outdoors, getting myself moving outside clears my mind, rejuvenates my spirit, and opens the way for creative ideas to flow.\n\nAnything you can’t live without while you write?\n\nA notebook and pen. Although I type my manuscripts and their revisions in the computer, nearly all of my drafts begin with initial lines and thoughts written down on paper.\n\nAny authors and/or illustrators who inspire you?\n\nThere are many authors and illustrators whom I admire, but those that come to mind today include: Beth Ferry, Bethany Hegedus, Jackie Azua Kramer, Juana Martinez-Neal, Kathi Appelt, Katherine Applegate, Carol Lynch Williams, Dianne White, Adam Rex, Jon Klassen, Kevin Hawkes, and the late Rick Walton.\n\nDream project to work on?\n\nI’m not sure! Perhaps one that seamlessly flows from inspirational spark to finding itself in book-form in the hands of readers—and in record time!\n\nWhere do you live?\n\nMaryland.\n\nWhen did you know you wanted to write picture books?\n\nI decided in fourth grade that one day I would write a book. Then in law school I took “Literacy and the Law.” We delved into book banning history, civil rights issues, international law issues, et al—but we also had to tutor a child and create our own picture book. It was a gift to my artistic soul! The book I wrote and illustrated (inspired by Rawls’ Theory of Justice and John and Evelyn Dewey) actually won two brand strategy industry international awards and was spoken about by the Majority Leader of Congress to a room full of women leaders a few years ago.\n\nTell us about your road to publication, what did that involve for you?\n\nI began seriously studying the art of children’s literature around five-ish years ago. One of the things that surprised me the most was how vast the difference is between the average person’s opinion/knowledge of picture book publishing versus the reality.\n\nWhen I happened on a reference to Susanna Salter, I was hooked immediately. I knew I had to tell her story—especially since Salter’s history has been left to a 1954 article (and the blogs/articles, etc that use the same information). My journey from beginning to sale took about two a half years. After spending several hours over the phone with amazing librarians and genealogists at Kansas State University, I was deeply saddened to hear the next weekend that the library had burned to the ground. Thankfully, nobody was hurt. I did wonder, however, if it was a “sign”…like, don’t do this one!\n\nFor over a year and a half, in spite of various hurdles, I kept researching, trying to access anything that would give me that special something the story needed. But little could be found that fit picture book story requirements. As we know, an interesting moment or tale doesn’t necessarily fit this genre.\n\nThen I met (virtually) Susanna Salter’s great granddaughter. She and her brother shared with me beautiful letters, pictures, and the like. When I wrote the final draft two years in, I kept one of her letters open on my laptop desktop. I think I actually teared up when I typed the final words. (Ssh! Don’t tell anyone!)\n\nCan you share a bit about your process?\n\nI never knew this prior, but apparently I am a major researcher—I will not stop until I get that everything I need to make the story my own. I enjoy and am inspired by building relationships with a circle of people surrounding the topic I’m working on. This makes the experience meaningful for me. I write out the idea (I do this for art, too) in my head, moving parts around like magnetic poetry pieces. Once I feel like I have the concept, then I get typing.\n\nWhat do you do to shake the rust off or get new ideas?\n\nGood question! I’ll let you know when I figure that one out!\n\nAnything you can’t live without while you write?\n\nA lack of distraction, my favorite thesaurus, and my dog napping (if you’ve ever been on the phone with me, you know why! Lol!)\n\nAny authors and/or illustrators who inspire you?\n\nWho doesn’t inspire me?! I cannot go in a book store for this very reason. I have to pull out every book I go near.\n\nDream project to work on?\n\nI feel like I’m living my dream right now with my debut. What could be better than shining a light on an incredible woman who changed American politics and world history? To be the first and only person to write her story is an honor.\n\nTell us about your debut book.\n\nWhere do you live?\n\nManchester UK!\n\nHow many years have you been in publishing?\n\nI signed with my agent Thao Le in August 2018, and my first illustrated book came out in June 2020. My author-illustrator debut ‘Amara and the Bats’ is out now in July 2021! So about 3 years in total.\n\nHow did you first get published?\n\nI got my first book deal as an illustrator shortly after signing with my agent, as Justin Chanda at Simon & Schuster had seen the announcement and my illustrations suited a book project.\n\n‘Amara and the Bats’ began as a dummy book that I made when I was applying to agents, and was actually why my agent signed me. We then worked on the book some more, and pitched to publishers, and we announced the book deal with editor Julia McCarthy at Atheneum Simon & Schuster in May 2019!\n\nDo you write/illustrate full-time?\n\nYes, and I currently also teach illustration one day a week at a university.\n\nWhat inspires you to create picture books?\n\nI absolutely love the format! For me they are the perfect balance of words and images, and I love how powerful picture books are, as humans first experiences of stories. They can change lives.\n\nWhat surprised you the most working as an author/illustrator?\n\nI used to work as a character designer for kid’s TV, and it was a very fast paced job. With publishing, I found the phrase ‘hurry up and wait’ to be true! It was a huge shock to me that a three week plus wait for the next round of feedback was normal, when I had been used to much quicker turnarounds. And then when final art is signed off it’s go go go! I am (almost haha) used to it now, but that was the hardest adjustment for me.\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about being an author/illustrator?\n\nI love love love telling my own stories! I am so excited that I get to craft a whole world, it is an amazing experience and job to have and I am so happy I get to do this.\n\nWhat do you do to shake the rust off or get new ideas?\n\nLive life! After a big project and a busy period, it’s good to take a break and live life, see friends, absorb some new experiences and remain curious. This is when I naturally find that I’m in a place for new ideas. It’s important to remember to take time off as a freelancer, or you’ll find yourself just working constantly, and that isn’t healthy or conducive to inspiration long term.\n\nAnything you are habitual about when it comes to creativity?\n\nI listen to the same music a lot. There are particular mixes I listen to a lot on YouTube, and I have listened to them so much there are no surprises that make me jump, so I can hyper focus and stay in the zone with them on.\n\nCan you share a positive experience you’ve had in the Kid Lit community?\n\nYeah for sure – I met some absolutely lovely author-illustrators who are also repped by my agent, and we have become close friends. Having people in the industry to talk to, bounce ideas off and ask questions is so important, and I’m so grateful for this – they are my rocks!\n\nRecommended reading?\n\nOoo so many! I recently really loved picture book ‘What Will You Be?’ written by Yamile Saied Méndez and illustrated by Kate Alizadeh. And for 16+ readers I love graphic novel ‘Woman World’ by Aminder Dhaliwal.\n\nWhat has been the highlight of your career thus far?\n\nHonestly, being able to make my dream book – ‘Amara and the Bats’, I have dreamed of making my own books since I was 5 years old, so 28 years later it is a reality and I am just so grateful and happy! Amara is my whole heart, and it was selected as a Junior Library Guild gold standard selection which is a huge honour and I am so proud of this.\n\nWhat is something you wish someone had told you when you first started writing/illustrating?\n\nOoo definitely related to what I’ve said above – that long waits for feedback are normal, and to make sure to take down time, because you’ll need it! And, protect your weekends.\n\nWhere do you live?\n\nI live in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.\n\nWhen did you know you wanted to write/illustrate picture books?\n\nI think I always knew in the back of my mind I wanted to write, and I've always loved picture books. A well-executed picture book is such an incredible thing, they seem so deceptively simple to write but are actually anything but. They have to be entertaining, and be something kids and adults want to go back to. They have to communicate complex subject matter in simple, elegant ways. Some of my favourite books ever are picture books so I guess it makes sense I began my career as a writer trying to capture that magic.\n\nTell us about your road to publication, what did that involve for you?\n\nIt's one of those fairytale stories that's actually hard to believe. I participated in a Twitter pitch contest, #PBPitch, in June 2019, with a pitch I'd used before with no success. But during that event it got one like. Just one. That like happened to come from Frances Gilbert, an editor at Doubleday. I sent the manuscript off to her and prepared for a long wait. Then an email came back from her an hour later offering to acquire T. REXES CAN'T TIE THEIR SHOES. For me it was a combination of luck, timing, and having a strong enough concept to catch her attention as she scrolled through the feed.\n\nCan you share a bit about your process?\n\nMy process is pretty simple, I get an idea - often for a title or concept and things unfold from there. If I'm writing NF, I lean on my background in journalism and do a pile of research before diving into the first draft. If I'm writing fiction I just sit down and start. Sometimes an entire arc will pop into my head and I just have to try to get it down without wrecking it!\n\nWhat do you do to shake the rust off or get new ideas?\n\nI have folders full of ideas, that's not the problem. For me there's sometimes a bit of paralysis when the manuscript is almost done but I have to do one final revision before I can consider it complete. Sometimes those drafts wait awhile for me to be inspired to come back and wrap them up. It feels like I have to wait for the right moment or I'll just be sitting there staring at the screen.\n\nAnything you can’t live without while you write/draw?\n\nI'm so used to snatching bits of time here and there I can write pretty much anywhere at any time. It's a useful skill.\n\nAny authors and/or illustrators who inspire you?\n\nSo many!! I love the work The Fan Brothers do, and I love how Dev Petty's writing seems so effortless (which it obviously isn't). I have a background in fine arts and have been enjoying reading through a bunch of Amy Guglielmo's work and love what Elly MacKay does with her illustration. I also love reading unpublished work by up and coming writers when I do critique giveaways because I get to read something only a handful of people have seen.\n\nDream project to work on?\n\nThat's an interesting question, I think the initial dream was just getting published. But I've always loved books that walk the line between light and darkness, so I'd like to find a way to explore those themes a bit in a way that works. I have a deep fondness for weird kids and strange situations so I'd love to delve into that a bit more.\n\nWhere do you live?\n\nPortland, Oregon\n\nHow many years have you been in publishing?\n\nAs a published author, just about a year! Lloyd Finds His Whalesong is my debut and it came out in 2020. But I’ve been writing and illustrating (and revising!) for several years before that.\n\nHow did you first get published?\n\nA few years ago, I sent a promotional illustration postcard to Page Street Kids, and Kristen Nobles responded with a very nice email about my work. Although we’re on opposite coasts, we connected over one of my ocean/boat scenes, which was really cool because the ocean is really important to me. Soon after that, I submitted a draft of Lloyd to her. I went through many (many, many, haha) drafts with Kristen and Courtney Burke (who became the acquiring editor). We eventually landed in a place where the story was solid, and I finally got that “yes.” I ran around my house screaming when I got the news!\n\nDo you write/illustrate full-time?\n\nNo, while I would love to reach that goal at some point, right now I do a mish-mash of work. My writing and illustrating work takes up a lot of my time, but I also work as a freelance corporate copy editor.\n\nWhat inspires you to create picture books?\n\nI remember being inspired by picture books as a little kid. I wanted to write and draw them back then when I was first reading them. I was enraptured by the illustrations, which I would stare at for a long time, or I’d look at them repeatedly and always see new details.\n\nAs an adult, I’m inspired by a lot of current creators, especially illustrators, who make such magical and beautiful worlds, and images you can fall into. As a writer, I’m inspired by the misfit kids (myself included) who have feelings, stories, and adventures that I want to share. Things that don’t always fit the mold. Right now, I’m working on finding more authenticity in my writing voice, leaning into that weirdness and not worrying so much about what others will think of it or if it’s marketable (that’s future Skylaar’s problem).\n\nSome of my stories are inspired by my real life and some are aspirational -- things I wish I had experienced as a kid. Creating some of that childhood joy is inspiring to me.\n\nI’m also always and forever inspired by nature — especially the ocean. I grew up on the Oregon Coast and that wild and rocky Pacific shoreline was a darn-near religious experience for me. If I can put even a sprinkle of that sublime wonder in my stories, I’ll have succeeded.\n\nWhat surprised you the most working as an author/illustrator?\n\nThe waiting! The timelines are slower than what I’m used to coming from a background in tech and marketing where projects often have to turn around the same day, or even the same hour. Now that I know the lay of the land, it’s a little easier to understand the timelines, although I can get anxious wondering what’s happening on the other side sometimes -- even just waiting to hear back from a critique partner! It’s not a lack of patience, it’s more the anxiety that builds up internally that makes waiting hard. Learning to chill and do other things (not be totally consumed by writing) has been helpful but I’m still learning to do that!\n\nWhat is your favorite thing about being an author/illustrator?\n\nProbably getting to take the worlds and stories that bounce around my head and put them to use, get them on paper. I spend a lot of time dreaming up worlds and ideas without realizing I’m doing it. Plenty are just random thoughts that aren’t stories, just daydreams or wonderings and so on. But when I’m lucky enough that one of those worlds connects with other people, and I get to then turn it into a book -- there’s nothing better!\n\nWhat do you find difficult working as an author/illustrator?\n\nEven before the pandemic, I was working alone most of the time. I actually like a lot of things about working alone, but sometimes it gets old. Connecting virtually with other writers has helped with that.\n\nThe work itself is also hard! Writing, rewriting, sketching, coloring -- it all takes work, continued learning, and practice. I tend to worry people won’t like anything I’m making, so I have to work on quelling that voice. But working on improving my skills also helps with growing my confidence. I feel like an imposter sometimes! I really put myself into my stories and want to create the best possible books I can, so I don’t like the idea of letting anyone down.\n\nWhat do you do to shake the rust off or get new ideas?\n\nI don’t really understand where my ideas come from! Sometimes they just pop up out of nowhere as little kernels, a random sketch, or a strange phrase that runs through my mind. And then I develop them from there. When those kernels aren’t popping up, I tend to stress out. If I get stressed like that, sometimes I need to take a break, not try to force it, read other books, do other fun things … maybe even get some sleep!\n\nThat said, I don’t believe in waiting around idly for inspiration to strike. If I’m really stuck, I’ll brainstorm ideas, just jot down concepts or lines, or sketch a random character and see if it goes anywhere. I also like to work on other stories or just paint or draw for fun (not with a story in mind) … and see where that goes.\n\nAnything you are habitual about when it comes to creativity?\n\nI tend to work at my desk or on my couch (or in coffee shops in the Before Times, sob). Having specific work spaces helps me focus on work. I’m not the type to say you should work every day -- life happens. But I do think consistency and self-discipline is important. So I set deadlines or goals for myself, especially when I’m developing an idea that no one else is yet invested in. Other than that, I try to be pretty flexible so my work doesn’t feel ritualistic. I feel that if you get too precious about it, it becomes a barrier to getting anything done.\n\nCan you share a positive experience you’ve had in the Kid Lit community?\n\nI’ve had some great support over the last couple of years from the KidLitCollective group. We were formerly called the Perfect2020PBs as a group of debut picture book authors in 2020, and it’s nice having that support system.\n\nI also have to give a shout out to my critique partner Nora Nickum who is a fabulous writer and fellow ocean lover. She’s an incredible editor, and (I don’t know if she realizes this) she helped me believe I could write middle grade. If you’re reading this, Nora — thank you, it means so much to me!\n\nI’ve also been working as a picture book mentor with WriteMentor for the last few years, and I’ve found that community to be really supportive of each other, no matter what stage of the journey anyone is at. It’s really cool to see people (myself included) progress and I enjoy helping others with the knowledge I’ve gained -- and then see them do the same!\n\nRecommended reading?\n\nI just read Seaside Stroll by Charles Trevino and illustrated by Maribel Lechunga. Geez, that book is gorgeous!\n\nWhat has been the highlight of your career thus far?\n\nGetting the news that I had an offer on Lloyd was such an exciting moment. It felt like a huge turning point after years of struggle. Signing with my incredible agent Jessica Watterson last year was also amazing, and another big milestone. Even though there are still ups and downs to this day, every celebratory moment I have, like selling Smile, Sophia, feels like the newest and best highlight.\n\nWhat is something you wish someone had told you when you first started writing/illustrating?\n\nI don’t know that anyone could have convinced me by telling me (I think I needed to experience it myself) but I’d say: The process takes time and everyone is on their own path. That’s cold comfort when you’re struggling or getting tons of rejections, (or watching others succeed) but if you keep developing your skills and improving bit by bit, you can move forward.\n\nWhere do you live?\n\nMy wife, daughter, and I live in Los Angeles, where I was born and raised. It’s a crazy metropolis that doesn’t make sense in many ways, but it’s beautiful all the same.\n\nWhen did you know you wanted to write picture books?\n\nWriting a children’s book has been a goal of mine for many years. I really got inspired to make it happen after the birth of my daughter, which reconnected me to children’s literature in a new and more meaningful way.\n\nTell us about your road to publication; what did that involve for you?\n\nIt all started with a birthday present: Through an elementary school auction, my wife bought me a consultation meeting with a local publisher. That initial meeting led to many months of revising, editing, and market research — all before finding an illustrator, creating a draft layout, and putting the finishing touches on the book before making it available to the public. The process required ample collaboration, and as a debut author I was grateful to have the guidance and encouragement of experienced professionals. I now have a much better understanding of how much work goes into the creation of a 24-page children’s book!\n\nCan you share a bit about your process?\n\nMy concept — a children’s book about a dozen eggs, each cooked differently to reveal a different emotion — became an exercise in trial and error. It required lots of mixing and matching! In addition, since I wanted to make a rhyming book, it took significant time to find age-appropriate words to fit into the ABCB stanza structure. It helps that I’m a bit of a word nerd; I enjoyed the challenge of emphasizing the right syllables in each line while maintaining the desired meaning. My thesaurus got a great workout.\n\nWhat do you do to shake the rust off or get new ideas?\n\nSpend time with children. As a parent, uncle, and literacy volunteer (shout-out to Reading to Kids), I’m always amazed at the new insights and fresh perspectives I glean from the little ones in my life. Their curiosity, fascinations, and sense of wonder are contagious!\n\nAnything you can’t live without while you write?\n\nI love listening to music, but I find that I often get distracted by lyrics when I’m writing. So, I usually opt for instrumental artists: Ludovico Eindaudi, Lance Allen, Chris Thile, The Greyboy Allstars, and The Six Parts Seven, to name a few.\n\nAny authors and/or illustrators who inspire you?\n\nI’ll always admire Shel Silverstein’s clever use of language; his work manages to be fun, memorable, and poignant. And I’m truly inspired by the brilliance of Gabriella Urbina, who illustrated my debut children’s book; I still marvel at her technical skills and her ability to convert ideas into images.\n\nDream project to work on?\n\nI’m a huge basketball fan, so it would be pretty special to incorporate my love of hoops into a children’s book somehow.\n\nWhere do you live?\n\nI live in a little town in Western Washington. I grew up here, left, moved around, and wound up coming back.\n\nWhen did you know you wanted to write picture books?\n\nGrowing up, I always liked writing, but I didn’t think I could make it a career. I’m diabetic, so health insurance was slightly more important than artistic fulfillment. But I grew to love picture books during my grad work in librarianship. There’s so much room for creativity within such a small space. When I got to a place in my life where I knew health insurance was taken care of, I let myself follow my passion.\n\nTell us about your road to publication, what did that involve for you?\n\nMy first attempt at writing for publication was a memoir. I worked on it for three years, then queried for another year. I racked up 140 rejections before I trunked it. I was devastated. So much time and work and agony for nothing!\n\nI wasn’t sure I could commit myself to a longer work like that again, so I turned to picture books. With two kids at home, it was what I read most anyway. I found a critique partner, read all the new picture books I could get my hands on, and followed writers on Twitter. Most of all, I kept writing and querying and getting better. But each time an agent requested more work, they would like this manuscript but not that one. It was super discouraging.\n\nEventually another writer noticed my pitch on Pitmad and invited me to be in their critique group. That was the turning point for me. I found my people. I kept writing and querying, but I knew my stuff was leveling up. There were more agent requests, but still more rejections. I felt like I was going to spend my life being good, but not quite good enough.\n\nI decided to query the unicorn book to every agent on my list and then trunk it. One of those agents was Rena Rossner at the Deborah Harris Agency. I almost didn’t send her the unicorn query because she so seldom takes on picture book authors. Plus, she’s repped some really IMPORTANT BOOKS (New York Times Bestseller and multi-award winner Dear Martin by Nic Stone, for example) and I didn’t think she’d like my silly story about a donkey with imposter syndrome. But she was on my list, so I sent it any way. Two months later, she emailed asking to set up a call.\n\nEven then, it was still a struggle. In the 18 months I’d spent querying the book, the market was flooded with unicorn stories. Every rejection we got from editors was some version of “nice, but we’ve already got one.” I was content to shelve it until unicorns stopped being the picture book version of YA vampire novels, but Rena was convinced it was different enough to sell. And thank heavens, she was right.\n\nCan you share a bit about your process?\n\nMy story ideas always come in chunks – there’s a character but no story. A mood but nothing else. I try to stay open to these story blips and write them down as they come. Sometimes it takes years for the rest of the story to materialize, but it’s almost always worth the wait. Once it comes, I can usually draft the whole picture book in one go. With longer things, I write scenes out of order as they come to me and try to connect the dots later.\n\nWhat do you do to shake the rust off or get new ideas?\n\nI take a walk, talk to my kids, or take a shower. Sometimes I need those quiet moments to let my brain do its thing and come up with whatever crazy idea or plot hole solution it wants. Other times, interacting with my kids really helps me get on their level and see the world through new eyes.\n\nAnything you can’t live without while you write?\n\nI’m all about those cheap composition notebooks you get on sale in September. Every stupid idea, every plot hole fix, every genius line I have to write before I forget it goes in the notebook. It’s a mess and nobody would understand it but me, but I can’t function without it.\n\nAny authors and/or illustrators who inspire you?\n\nThere are SO MANY. Jacqueline Woodson is a genius and every single one of her books has changed my life in some way. I love Ame Dyckman’s work. She’s so effortlessly funny and has such a quirky way of looking at the world. I’m also a huge fan of Tara Lazar, both of her books and the work she does to lift other authors. Yuyi Morales is super talented. Julie Falatko is another that I really respect. She’s super funny and real. Traci Sorell’s books are all really poetic and beautiful. There’s more but I’ll stop there.\n\nDream project to work on?\n\nI would love to branch out and try writing middle grade and YA. Right now, the one I’m dying to do is a middle grade about a group of girls having a sleepover when a crop circle appears in the field next door – something that actually happened in my town when I was 13.\n\nWhere do you live?\n\nI live in tiny “city” (if you call it a town, residents will correct you) of 2.5 miles in beautiful Vermont, near the shores of Lake Champlain. Before that, my family and I lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The desert is beautiful, too, but in a very different way!\n\nWhen did you know you wanted to write picture books?\n\nI’ve always loved to write, but I didn’t consider picture books a possibility until I had my own kids. I take them to the library at least once a week, and have from the time they were infants. Rediscovering picture books through their eyes helped me build a new appreciation for the form. I was familiar with well-loved books from my own childhood, but exploring the library with my children helped me discover new titles and artists on a weekly basis. I didn’t know it yet, but I was embarking on an intensive study of the form.\n\nTell us about your road to publication, what did that involve for you?\n\nIn my “day job” is as a school librarian, I developed relationships with local authors and independent booksellers in Albuquerque. When I shyly confessed I wanted to write while at a bookstore event, others were kind enough to tell me about the local chapter of SCBWI. From there, I heard about both StoryStorm and the 12x12 challenge. The structured approach to both, as well as in-person encouragement and support, helped me to establish a more regular writing routine.\n\nIn February 2017, I happened upon a viral video of José Alberto Gutiérrez, a Colombian trash collector who established a library for the children of his neighborhood, entirely from books found along his garbage route. At the time, I was working as a librarian in New Mexico, and much of my work involved helping students and families get access to books despite socio-economic or linguistic barriers. José addressed similar inequities with his own project. I found his story and his warmth so inspiring that I tried free writing about him one morning, and that casual free write evolved, after many drafts and revisions, into my debut picture book, DIGGING FOR WORDS!\n\nCan you share a bit about your process?\n\nMy process is kind of all over the place, and it varies from project to project! I will say that I am a total research nerd, and I have to cut myself off at a certain point and get to the actual writing. I find that starting by hand in a messy notebook and freewriting really helps. And, even though I am not an illustrator, I always make a storyboard using Debbie Ridpath Ohi’s template. Once I’m a few drafts in, I use a 32-page blank books (you can buy a pack from school supply stores) to get a feel for pacing and page turns. I’m starting to become more comfortable with Scrivener, and it’s a helpful place to organize my research, but I like the tactile experience of sketching out my vision and cutting up and rearranging text.\n\nThe process for DIGGING was interesting because I had the idea for the dual narrative from the very beginning, and I never varied from that structure. I wrote the first draft based entirely on the video that served as the original inspiration, and then went back and did much more extensive research on José and his library, as well as Colombia and Bogotá. I did not contact José until much later, because I wanted him to be able to read a polished draft of the story I had in mind. Considering my tendency to wander down too many rabbit holes and prolong my research, I should probably revisit this approach with other projects!\n\nWhat do you do to shake the rust off or get new ideas?\n\nAlthough it isn’t happening much right now, I always find myself inspired when I travel. Even if it is just a simple day trip to an art museum or a historical site, getting away from my desk and seeing something new always reinvigorates me.\n\nI also try to make sure that I read widely and vary what I read--- from picture books to adult nonfiction and everything in between. I find that if I cast my net really wide and just stay curious, good ideas come along. My problem isn’t so much generating ideas as it is finding time to write about all of them!\n\nAnything you can’t live without while you write?\n\nCoffee in the morning and Earl Grey tea in the afternoon. So basically, caffeine.\n\nI’m also a huge fan of Inkjoy pens, .5, not .7 thickness! And I love buying cheap-but-pretty composition books. I prefer composition books to spiral notebooks because I’m less likely to tear pages out or attempt to throw away “bad” ideas, and they’re so inexpensive that I don’t get too precious about them. It’s ok if they just become messy notebooks, and I’m freer with my ideas that way.\n\nAny authors and/or illustrators who inspire you?\n\nThere are so many that I’m having trouble listing just a few! One thing I love about kidlit is that other creators are so willing to share resources and encourage one another.\n\nKate Messner inspires me with how prolific she is, and how she writes across age groups and genres. I learn so much from the writing resources she shares! I’m also amazed by Mac Barnett’s ability to break with convention in The Important Thing About Margaret Wise Brown. And I love the lyrical language of picture book biographies by Anika Aldamuy Denise, Kyo Maclear, Amy Novesky, and Laurel Snyder.\n\nI’m constantly drawn to color and texture, and the interplay between text and image, so I love following illustrators on Instagram. Some of my favorites are Paola Escobar (who illustrated DIGGING), E.B. Goodale, Vanessa Brantley Newton, Oge Mora, Melissa Sweet, and Isabelle Arsenault.\n\nDream project to work on?\n\nAck! This is a tough one to answer, because I had a dream project that went in the drawer recently for . . . secret reasons. I think it goes back to the question about generating ideas, though. The exciting part of writing is looking for that next idea that sets your heart and brain on fire. I’m not sure what another dream project would be, but I know I’ll have fun exploring until I get there. And it’s always fun to daydream about being paired with an amazing illustrator whose work I admire.\n\nWhere do you live?\n\nAustin, Texas.\n\nWhen did you know you wanted to write picture books?\n\nAs an elementary teacher for 17 years, I was surrounded by picture books (and children). Reading to the children and discussing the stories was always one of my favorite things to do during the day. I fell in love with the experience and wanted to be able to write stories for children and teachers to enjoy together.\n\nTell us about your road to publication, what did that involve for you?\n\nI didn't become serious about a pursuit to publication until 2016, when I was 44 years old. I set my mind to it, wrote multiple manuscripts, researched the querying process and started my journey. After two years of querying and a handful of twitter pitch events, I connected with my agent. She sold my debut book a year later and it will be published this month on the 25th! Now, I was writing poetry and songs for years before I attempted to write my first picture book, so there were many years of \"practice\" writing. Also, I was reading picture books every day. Something that is essential if you are going to write picture books. Read, read, and read some more!\n\nCan you share a bit about your process?\n\nI am a pantser for the most part. I come up with an idea and let it roll around in my head for awhile. If it starts to take shape, I might write down the basic plot so I don't forget it. Then, I do some research if it's necessary and start writing soon thereafter. I use actual pencil and paper for the first very rough draft. I revise as I go and when the story has a beginning, middle, and end, I move to the computer. Then, it's time for multiple revision sessions before I send it to CPs. Sometimes, I rewrite a story based on feedback I receive and other times, I don't much revising at all. And of course, not all stories end up being sent to my agent. I try to pick the \"special\" ones and that usually means CP approved.\n\nWhat do you do to shake the rust off or get new ideas?\n\nI give myself time. I read. I listen to family members, friends, and students. I also like to research unusual phenomena and new inventions. Research almost always ignites a creative spark from which ideas can grow.\n\nAnything you can’t live without while you write?\n\nI like to listen to music when I write. Music has always been a part of my life, so it feels like it belongs in the background. I also like snacks. Salty and then, sweet. Or both at the same time!\n\nAny authors and/or illustrators who inspire you?\n\nTara Lazar's sense of humor inspires me daily on Twitter and her books are in a league of their own; so clever! And Jacqueline Woodson is one of my favorite authors. I love the way she weaves words together to tell such important stories.\n\nDream project to work on?\n\nI would love to have one of my stories illustrated by Raissa Figueroa. Her illustrations are gorgeous!\n\nWhere do you live?\n\nMy family and I live in rural Central Texas—not too far from Austin when we need our big city fix.\n\nWhen did you know you wanted to write picture books?\n\nI feel like I’ve always wanted to do it, but it seemed like an unlikely dream. Even though my background is in writing (I have a degree in journalism) and working with children (I was an elementary school teacher for a decade), I felt like picture book writers were on a different echelon than the rest of us. In 2016, I met a neighbor in an exercise class who told me she was a children’s author. Hearing her story and how she broke into the industry (a lot of hard work and gumption) inspired me. I joined SCBWI and started taking craft classes and, of course, wrote lots and lots. I signed with my agent later that year and we sold this manuscript about two years later.\n\nTell us about your road to publication, what did that involve for you?\n\nWell, it’s a notoriously rough road. I feel fortunate that my agent and I connected pretty early into my writing career, but I’ve still faced a lot of rejection. We submitted several manuscripts and got loads of rejections (some nice and some not so nice) before we sold SATURDAYS ARE FOR STELLA to Page Street. I had spent so long waiting for that YES! that when it finally came, I was totally unprepared for it (but still overwhelmingly thrilled).\n\nCan you share a bit about your process?\n\nI keep an idea journal, but I do all my actual drafting on my MacBook. When a story comes to me, I usually have to buckle down for as long as it takes to get the story out. Then I let it sit (for days to weeks), share it with critique partners, read it to my own kids, and revise. Each time I make revisions, I start the process over again (it can be tedious, but it is effective). When it feels right, I share it with my agent.\n\nWhat do you do to shake the rust off or get new ideas?\n\nReading a stack of brand new picture books always inspires me. I am amazed at the brilliant ideas that people come up with and how they share them so effectively. It’s impossible for me to read new stuff and not want to go tackle some of my own projects.\n\nAnything you can’t live without while you write?\n\nI can write with paper and pencil just fine, but really prefer to draft on my MacBook. The instant editing abilities are so helpful for my scattered brain. So that and a quiet house—naptime is the golden hour for writing where I live.\n\nAny authors and/or illustrators who inspire you?\n\nI grew up on Beverly Cleary books and, man, they still hold up decade after decade. She’s a master. Mo Willems is a genius. He has an ability to take such obvious, simple ideas and turn them into masterpieces. I love Bob Shea’s humor too. Abby Hanlon wrote a series called DORY FANTASMAGORY which is absolutely hilarious and seriously underrated. And Nathan Hale’s Hazardous Tales are a perfect blend of history, great writing and humor.\n\nDream project to work on?\n\nI really love history and biographies so I’d love to publish some true stories that are inspiring and really deserve more attention.\n\nTell us about your debut book.\n\nSATURDAYS ARE FOR STELLA is a tribute to the grandparent-grandchild relationship.It began in 2016 as an idea of writing a love story between grandparent and grandchild. My MC George looked forward to his Saturday dates with Stella and made a big deal of cleaning up for her and bringing her flowers. Stella kept pictures of George all over her walls and gushed about him to her girlfriends. I took it to my critique group and they thought it was sweet, but needed more. I decided having Stella die would give the story some emotional impact, but I couldn’t figure out how to end the story on a positive note. I had written the scene where George is blacking out all the Saturdays on his calendar and it reminded me of the times I had marked the weeks during each of my pregnancies. Suddenly I realized the cure to George’s sadness was a new Stella.\n\nCharlie Eve Ryan (whose work reminds me of Tomie de Paola’s) did the illustrations and I think they’re just fabulous: warm and sweet and lovely. She captured George and his Stellas perfectly.\n\nWe sold the manuscript to Page Street Kids in 2018 and the book (finally) comes out on August 11. It’s been a long journey, but worth every step along the way.\n\nWhat’s up next for you?\n\nI’m really excited about my next book. It’s a picture book biography of Edward White, the first American to walk in space.\n\nIn 2018 I was teaching a middle school class on the US Soviet Space Race and White’s name came up. I read an article where he was quoted as saying the end of his space walk was “the saddest moment of (his) life.” My picture book writing ears perked up at that because it’s such a kid-thing to say. I thought it was a great story…for someone else to tell. I’m not a big space buff and it seemed way out of my comfort zone. But the story wouldn’t leave me. I kept thinking about it, doing a little researching here and there and wondering if I could pull it off. During a summer road trip, our plans changed at the last minute and we suddenly had a free day on the east coast of Florida. My husband suggested a stop at NASA and I agreed without really thinking about Edward White. We bought tickets and rushed into the first exhibit we could without even consulting a map. I opened the door and looked up and saw a huge photograph of White and an exhibit dedicated to the Apollo 1 mission he was a member of. At that point, I felt like fate was telling me what to do. I went home thinking about it more and more and literally dreamt the first line. After that, it was a matter of hunkering down and getting the rest of the story written.\n\nWe sold the story to Philomel and the book THE STARS BECKONED: EDWARD WHITE’S AMAZING WALK IN SPACE comes out April 2021. Courtney Dawson illustrated it and really captured Edward and the midcentury period well. It’s been an incredible experience working on a nonfiction piece. White died in 1967, but I was able to share the manuscript with his children and they’ve given feedback every step of the way so I feel like what we’ve produced is completely authentic, but also a really loving, lyrical story.\n\nAnd last, but not least, favorite 80s movie?\n\nPee Wee’s Big Adventure has everything you could want in an 80s movie! Mystery, romance, horror (Large Marge), bar top dancing, a trip to Texas and Mr. T. What could be better?"
