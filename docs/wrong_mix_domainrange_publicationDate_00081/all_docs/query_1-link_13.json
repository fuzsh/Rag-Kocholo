        "text": "Nearly 700 books, including recent bestsellers by Jon Stewart and Amy Poehler and classics by Maya Angelou, Ovid, and Marcel Proust, were removed from classrooms in Orange County, Florida, due to fears they violate the state’s new laws banning materials with “sexual conduct” from schools.\n\nThe books banned at the beginning of the 2023-2024 school year were previously available in teachers’ personal classroom library collections and made available for self-selected reading. The list includes recent bestsellers Earth: The Book, by Jon Stewart, Yes, Please! by Amy Poehler, Option B: Facing Adversity, Building Resilience, and Finding Joy, by Sheryl Sandberg and Adam Grant, Eat, Pray, Love by Elizabeth Gilbert, Life by Keith Richards, Friday Night Lights by H.G. Bissinger, The Gift of Forgiveness by Katherine Schwarzenegger Pratt, The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, by Taylor Jenkins Reid, The Casual Vacancy, by J.K. Rowling, Blade Runner by Philip K. Dick, Angels and Demons by Dan Brown, and Naked by David Sedaris.\n\nAnn Patchett, whose novels Bel Canto and The Patron Saint of Liars were on the list, noted that in The Patron Saint of Liars, the only “sex” happens before the book begins.\n\n“We don’t get to see the girls having sex. They just show up pregnant at a home for unwed mothers, because they choose not to have an abortion,” she said. “They have the baby and give the baby up for adoption, just like they tell us to in the state of Florida. I would think this book would be required reading.”\n\nThe list obtained by the Florida Freedom to Read Project and confirmed to the Orlando Sentinel by Orange County Public Schools also includes “The Bondwoman’s Narrative,” by Hannah Crafts and edited Henry Louis Gates Jr., the first known novel by an African American woman, and books by Margaret Atwood, Ann Brashares, Candace Bushnell, Patricia Cornwell, Colleen Hoover, John Green, Stephen King, Robert Ludlum, Cormac McCarthy, Joyce Carol Oates, James Patterson, Jodi Picoult, Nora Roberts, Nicholas Sparks, and Gossip Girl author Cicely von Ziegler, and at least one Captain Marvel comic book.\n\nAlso banned were well-known literary works by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Isabel Allende, Maya Angelou, Saul Bellow, Raymond Chandler, J.M. Coetzee, Ralph Ellison, Louise Erdrich, Gustave Flaubert, Gabriel García Márquez, Thomas Hardy, Herman Hesse, Joseph Heller, Aldous Huxley, Barbara Kingsolver, John Milton, Toni Morrison, Haruki Murakami, Ovid, Marcel Proust, Philip Roth, Arundhati Roy, William Styron, Amy Tan, Viet Thanh Nguyen, Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Jesmyn Ward, Richard Wright, and Tom Wolfe. The opera Cendrillon and the play M. Butterfly by David Henry Huang were banned from classrooms.\n\n“This is yet another disastrous consequence of Florida’s disastrous education policies,” said Kasey Meehan, program director for PEN America’s Freedom to Read program. “Hundreds of books have now been removed from Orange County shelves under HB 1069, and we continue to be alarmed by the magnitude and scale of censorship following the implementation of this law.”\n\nThe Orlando Sentinel published a two-page print spread listing 673 of the books. PEN America has confirmed these 689 unique titles.\n\nBooks Banned in Orange County, Florida"
