        "text": "The Hugo Award was one of the most prestigious awards within the Science fiction and fantasy community. Rewarding the very best in science fiction and fantasy work and achievements. The Hugo Awards have been presented annually since 1955.\n\nThere have also been a number of retro awards given for works dating back as far as 1946. As this still primarily deals with full novels we have presented a list of \"Best Novel\" winners and short-listed Nominee's. There are however also awards for Best Novella (stories between 17,500 and 40,000 words), Best Novelette (stories between 7,500 and 17,500 words), Best Short Story for stories of less than 7,500 words. Also included are Best Related Work, Best Graphic Story, Best Dramatic Presentation, Best Semiprozine, Best Fanzine, Best Professional Editor, Best Professional Artist, Best Fan Artist, Best Fan Writer and finally Best Fancast.\n\nThe Hugo's are named after science fiction pioneer Hugo Gernsback who founded the magazine Amazing Stories and is considered by many to be a founding father of the genre. While the Hugo awards represent a world-wide audience they have often favoured American male, white authors to the detriment of the genre. Lately though this has changed and writers of different gender and race are beginning to receive nominations and awards.\n\nSince 2014 there has been attempts to \"game\" the awards from a small group of people who don't like to see diversity in their science fiction. Many of the 2015 shortlists were filled with nominations that this small group wanted to see. Thankfully the larger science fiction community used their votes wisely and as a result the majority of categories in 2015 received a \"no award\".\n\nPresented below is a list of Best novel shortlist and winners."
