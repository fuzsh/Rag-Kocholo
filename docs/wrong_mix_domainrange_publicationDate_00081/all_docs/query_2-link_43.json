        "text": "Barely Blind’s new album, Wilder Child Of A Thousand Suns, is officially out for free here. The band was rad enough to do a Track-By-Track feature with PropertyOfZack to clue fans in on the songs behind the album. Read up and check out the album!\n\nSilver Lake\n\nWhen we wrote this song we knew we were going to open the record up with it. Even before I wrote the lyrics, we all knew it would be the best, most commanding way to start out our record. The lyrics of this song mean the most to us because it is all about the dream that we had to move out to los angeles despite all odds. we knew it would take awhile to prepare; we knew it would be a wild and huge step both for the band and personally, but its something that we had to make happen. Best thing about this song is that we are now residents of the Silver Lake area.\n\nCant Expect\n\nThis is the song we’ve had the longest. I’d say this is the 15th version of these collective parts. We are so happy with it. Especially the drums and the guitar tones.\n\nInner Child\n\nSonically, this is one of the last songs we structured for the record. I think because of that it resulted in one of the most interesting songs. Also, this is one of the last songs i wrote lyrics to expect for the chorus. After listening to the song tracked, to think about melodies, i went with singing about my youth because of the line “i wish i was a kid” and the fact that this song almost always sparked a conversation about our childhoods among each other.\n\nHow to Sail the Atlantic Alone\n\nThe name of this song came from a book that Williams’ uncle wrote. This song is a freak accident. You take a guitar progression that Will had for way too long with nothing to go with and a guitar lead that I had for even longer with not even a clue which part of it should even go first; mix both up with every other idea for a couple of months and then one unexpected day it just magically fit together. So magically in fact, it took a good ten minutes to figure out what we just played.\n\nWilder Child\n\nThis song is where the title of the record comes from. Its the biggest departure we’ve taken musically. I originally wrote this song as an idea i never thought the band would want to use. When we tried the parts out full band the laid back rhythms was something we all wanted to achieve. As a project, it has brought us together and tighter as a band since the instrument switch Reid and I did for this album. The title of the record comes for the line in this song.\n\nPurgatory Creek\n\nBest description: When Summer meets Fall. Secondly, the lead in the beginning is in fact a guitar.\n\nThe Great White Buffalo\n\nWe’ve played a version of this song live for about two years now. It has had a identity crisis for awhile but as my personal life sorted itself out the songs true direction fell in place. This song was conceived on an acoustic guitar, like a good number of the beginning songs and parts for the record.\n\nLove! (Isn’t Everything)\n\nThe only song on the record with an acoustic guitar track on it. We released a version of this song last February for Valentine’s Day. This versions only difference is it being a new mix. It is by no means damming love as emotion, but it is saying that it isn’t everything. i think centering yourself around having or finding love gets us in unwanted situations. Love is sacred. Lots of people who think they know what this emotion is or feel like that have it with someone are actually so concerned with this feeling or the lack of, that they confuse other things with it. Love isn’t everything. Cherish it when you find it.\n\nUna Bella\n\nI think anyone who is pursuing an artistic career, by any stretch, (music, art, film, etc) knows what it is to put themselves out in the open. These people can not only relate to what this song is saying, but could also get a good laugh out of it as well.\n\nNature of the Beast\n\nWe released this song a while back. It is remastered now. We put this song out before love, and before we recorded or finished writing the album as our bands “mission statement.” When we wrote this song i was at a turning point personally and the burn i felt to do something special to me, Wilder Child of a Thousand Suns, was felt by everyone else in the band. We see this song as the start of everything since and all to come from us. Like the late, great Pimp C said, “I live everyday like it’s my mother fuckin’ last one.”"
