        "text": "The isolation level of a table defines the degree to which a transaction must be isolated from modifications made by concurrent operations. Write conflicts on Databricks depend on the isolation level.\n\nDelta Lake provides ACID transaction guarantees between reads and writes. This means that:\n\nMultiple writers across multiple clusters can simultaneously modify a table partition. Writers see a consistent snapshot view of the table and writes occur in a serial order.\n\nReaders continue to see a consistent snapshot view of the table that the Databricks job started with, even when a table is modified during a job.\n\nSee What are ACID guarantees on Databricks?."
