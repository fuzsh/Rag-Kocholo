Blind Lake birthdate: 2012.\n\nHOMETOWN: MALMOE, LUND Sweden\n\nCURRENT LOCATION: SKURUP, BÖSTE Sweden\n\nAMBITIONS: To spread our music to the good people on earth\n\nTURN-OFFS: Narrow-mindedness of all sorts\n\nTURN-ONS: Openmindedness, bizarre weather conditions, songs from the heart, love, X Files re-opening\n\nDREAM GIG: In front of an audience\n\nFAVORITE LYRIC: “Leaves on your ouijaboard” (from You & Oblivion by Robyn Hitchcock).\n\n“Hey daddy’o, I don´t wanna go down to the base(ment)\n\nThere´s something down there” (I don´t wanna go down to the basement by Ramones)\n\nAnd we must salute the vastly underrated Guy Kyser from Thin White Rope. He wrote (don´t know if he still makes music) like no one else: odd, scary, very evocative and darkly funny lyrics, completely original.\n\nCRAZIEST PERSON I KNOW: Harry. He´s sort of a person but a turtle in appearance. 32 years old, evil incarnate. Quietly planning to unleash great misery on mankind. Likes salad and fire.\n\nSONG I WISH I WROTE: “Moments of pleasure” by Kate Bush.\n\n5 PEOPLE I’D MOST LIKE TO HAVE DINNER WITH: Stephen King, Robyn Hitchcock, Kate Bush, Octavia Butler, David Bowie\n\nMY FAVORITE CONCERT EXPERIENCE: Ramones at Mejeriet in Lund 1989, The Residents 1990-something in Lund, Marianne Faithful 2000-something in Malmö."
