        "text": "Leaving Munising Tourist Park on Sept. 2 the Crumblies looked at one another agreeing the weather had turned too nice to go home, so we headed for a favorite spot – Blind Sucker Creek #2 State Forest Campground. On arrival we found a favorite site #22 had a tag on it claiming the site in advance for Sept. 3-5. Campsites, however, have to be occupied on the tag date and can’t be reserved ahead. After confirming the rule with a ranger, we registered for the site and set up camp. The day was cool, but bright and beautiful.\n\nBlind Sucker River has quite an interesting history. The Sucker River flows out of plains to the south which were logged in the 19th century and the River was used to float the logs east down to the mouth of Lake Superior which emptied into Lake Superior near Muskallonge Lake. There they would be gathered and moved back to Grand Marais for processing. (View a vintage clip of the risky job of transporting logs by river.)\n\nIn 1870 the Sucker River was diverted into Grand Marais Creek to flow directly to Grand Marais saving the 13 mile float of log rafts back to Grand Marais:\n\nThe flow of the Sucker River diverted, the area is now a flooding with what was the Sucker River now become the Blind Sucker River which continues to flow to Lake Superior after passing over the 1954 dam which forms the current flooding.\n\nFor an engaging saga growing out of logging tread Annie Proulx’s Barkskins:\n\n“Marchand!” screamed Byers over the roar of water, “you got a key hung on the ledge.” Marchand nodded. A few of the men on top came to the lower level and began prying at logs. Franceway and Ketchum chopped their way down to the bad log and began to cut into its crooked bend. Crackling sounds came from it and Ketchum shouted “Run!” suiting his action to the words. But Franceway lifted his arms and smote the bent devil a final blow. It broke, the jam quivered and immediately began to haul. Logs gushed over the edge. Jinot, in his bateau above the jam, saw a thirty-foot log rear up at the top of the releasing pile and plunge down like a falling arrow, striking square in the center of his back. Men onshore heard the crack. Franceway folded backward like a sheet of paper, his heels came past his ears and now a butcher’s package of meat, he went under the grind. Jinot opened his jaws to scream but his throat was paralyzed. In that moment his childhood ended.\n\nOur first day of sunshine gave way to a 2nd of drizzle. We used the opportunity to make a run to Newberry to get more dog food and staples for our unplanned stay. By the time we got back the sun had returned.\n\nAND the 30mph NW winds that blitzed us near Munising returned and continued for the next couple days\n\nWe did have more sunny moments to enjoy, including swims (short) in the Flooding at 64° air and 63° water.\n\nDetails about the history Flooding come from:\n\nhttp://quod.lib.umich.edu/f/fishery/4992510.0076.016?rgn=main;view=fulltext\n\nBlind Sucker #2 has been a favorite Crumblies’ haunt for many years. It provides some large camping sites with trees for privacy, and many sites have direct access to the water for fishing, kayaking, canoeing, swimming or shoreline lollygagging.\n\nThose camped at the Flooding get some awesome views:\n\nWithin 5 minutes you can also be walking the southern shoreline of Lake Superior looking for agates, swimming in water much colder than the flooding or camping in the Lake Superior State Forest Campground just back from the shoreline.\n\nThe flooding is 13 miles east of Grand Marais with it’s beautiful harbor and 8 miles west of the Deer Park Lodge and store and Muskallonge State Park. Getting here via westerly travel on H58 (Deer Park Road) along the shoreline road will be hard on your vehicle if it’s a rainy time: you’ll bounce on the washboard-like sections, slide in sand, clunk and swerve to avoid potholes that could wallow a hippopotamus. Blind Sucker #2’s current resident camper Ed refers to that 8 miles as “the canal road”. In the event of wet weather, coming in via county road 410 from around Perch Lake is the better choice. The road to Grand Marais can also be a challenge in wet weather which you can avoid by taking county road 416 if the logging trucks haven’t ground that road into pulp too."
