        "text": "Our local Emily / Outing / Moose River and Emily / Blind Lake ATV Trails connect into the more expansive 336-mile network of ATV trails which make-up up the Northwoods Regional ATV Trail System. In 2022 the OTHG ATV Club joined the established eight-club Northwoods Regional ATV Trail Alliance. As an alliance we took a hard look at our trails and realized that some major repairs and design changes were needed. Many of the original trail sections, opened in 2007, were designed around Class I ATV use, resulting in many bridges and boardwalks that are undersized for the more predominant Class 2 (Side x Side) style machines. Many trail sections are compacted and lie below adjacent land surfaces, which then make them prone to soil erosion and difficult to maintain.\n\nIn December 2023, Alliance members attended the ATV Minnesota Legislative Summit and received approval for a $500,000 funding resolution. The funding would be allocated from the ATV Dedicated account, which is where our registration fee's go. This resolution has since been carried forward to the State Capitol by the ATVMN Lobbyists. Today, the resolution has been turned into two bills at the MN Legislature. Senate bill S.F. 2170, authored by MN Senators Nathan Wesenberg, Justin Eichorn and Robert Farnsworth as House bill H.F. 2379, authored by House Representatives Ben Davis and Spencer IGO\n\nThe two bills will need to pass in committees before being sent forward for a full chamber vote. We are very hopeful that passage of this bill will provide some much needed funding on our Northwoods Regional ATV Trail System. When possible please thank our local legislators for authoring and introducing these bills during the 2022-2023 MN Legislative Session.\n\nWhat exactly are Bylaws and why are they needed? Bylaws are a legal document that outlines the rules, regulations, and guidelines of our club organization. They contain the basic rules of order for the why our club is in existence, and the how of the method in which the club will conduct decisions in support of our members. The OTHG Bylaws have not been amended since 2011 and needed some changes to reflect the changes of the club, riders and trails we manage. For example, in 2011 the club did not have any Grant-In-Aid trails. The Emily/Outing & Moose River ATV Trails opened in 2014, and since that time the club has needed a Grant Manager and more Trail Coordinators. The club has grown in memberships, individual/family/and business, each year, now with 325 paid individual /family memberships and almost 60 business memberships. This makes us the largest or one of largest of the 70 active ATV clubs in Minnesota. The number of Club Officers which make up the Board of Directors has stayed constant at five Officers. This has put a tremendous burden on our Officers for keeping club activities organized and fun.\n\nIn September of 2022, a group of members recognized a need for change to help our expanding club and trails. A Bylaws Committee was formed, and after a number of revisions, inputs from members, and a 45-day public review process, a final amended version of the OTHG Bylaws was presented at the March 4, 2023 club meeting. The new Bylaws were passed by a unanimous vote by members in attendance.\n\nMajor Bylaw Changes include:\n\nMoving Board of Director elections to October (end of riding season)\n\nCreating a Grant Manager and Director at Large Position on the Board of Directors\n\nCreating eight standing committees, each with oversight to one Board member\n\nEnhanced Board of Director position descriptions\n\nAdded language for the club \"to borrow funds\" for trail equipment or short-term coverage of trail expenses while grant expense reimbursements are being processed\n\nWe hope all changes will help spread around the work that is needed, enhance the level of riding opportunities, and provide more opportunities for members to get involved, which increases the fun at events that our members have come to enjoy. Club Bylaws are available to any club member by requesting a copy to overthehillsgang@gmail.com\n\nThank You to the Bylaw Committee: Kim Dylla, Tim Sink, Dave Thompson, Perry May, Rod Wegner"
