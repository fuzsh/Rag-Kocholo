Pittsburg\n\nAs though working class is not hard enough\n\nDeath takes away the father when Andy was just thirteen\n\nA mother did what she could\n\nWent into other people’s homes to clean what wasn’t hers\n\nAnd what she didn’t own\n\nThey say Andy was sickly as a child\n\nRead a lot of movie magazines\n\nShirley Temple signed a glossy\n\nHoly relic of seeing the screen\n\nHis name spelled wrong on it\n\nBut a boy grows up\n\n1949 finds New York\n\nJust the way it is\n\nThings can’t always stay like that\n\nCommercial artists get paid\n\n1960’s the dawning of new fads\n\nAndy one of the most expensive\n\nPostcard 2\n\nThe Abstract Expressionists\n\nWere all like a bunch of walking Charles Bukowski’s\n\nJohn Jaspers and his lover, Robert Rauschenberg\n\nAndy wanted at least John or did he want Rauschenberg?\n\nHell, did he want them both?\n\nHard headed, hard core alcoholics, hard living, hard loving\n\nAnd their art was the only gods they worshiped\n\n1958 Jaspers’ “Flag” paintings, Castelli Gallery\n\nArt world freaked\n\nOver some star and stripes\n\nOver some red and white\n\nShit, some blue\n\nThey were all too eager\n\nMad in their own desires\n\nNot raging, but raging\n\nHolding the pain of pills\n\nand booze\n\nLike hands of lovers\n\nLost but not in solitude\n\nNew York\n\nSick with mist, gray and opaque\n\nSplash some paint over it\n\nBefore the world is fatigued\n\n“You are too swish,” Andy.” You are just too damn swish for them.\n\nBut what is swish if not posh and what is posh if not another word for fuck\n\nAnd what’s wrong with a little commercial success, anyway?\n\nPostcard 3\n\nWhen you are you\n\nThat upsets people\n\nAnd creation of yourself\n\nIs harder to master than people think\n\nWhen you make yourself into your own myth\n\nAndy needed a studio\n\nHe couldn’t go on forever stacking paintings\n\nOn Lexington Avenue\n\nHis mother’s house\n\nAnd when you have a need\n\nLike an addict searching for a fix\n\nYou become vulnerable to your own\n\nThirst and hunger\n\nAndy was a myth already\n\nSensitive outcast\n\nPouring on\n\nIrving Blum saw all the soup can paintings on Lexington Avenue\n\nOn the floor the paintings lay\n\nPositioned above the paintings was a photograph of Marilyn Monroe\n\nBlum knew how a man so in need\n\nCould be made to see what he saw\n\nTake Andy’s desire and teach Andy how to\n\nProject his own desire so that we are all desiring\n\nWhat we never knew we wanted\n\nThe photograph was nothing really\n\nJust a sheet of paper torn out of a magazine\n\nMore pop\n\nPinned up on the wall\n\nBlum offered to take Andy to LA\n\nBut Andy wanted a NY gallery\n\nBlum took Andy by the arm\n\nAnd whispered over his ear, “Movie stars” will see it\n\nIn the city of Angels, pointing to Marilyn’s image\n\nAnd just like that Andy in LA\n\nPostcard 4\n\nYes, it happened\n\nThe Soup Can Exhibition\n\nFERUS Gallery, Los Angeles\n\nAndy’s first exhibition\n\n32 SOUP CANS\n\nThis was

all exhibitions come to a close\n\nAll exhibitionism eventually has a curtain\n\nExtravagance\n\nAttraction to oneself\n\nAs though you are your own mirror\n\nIsn’t that what exhibitionism means?\n\nWhy would we think an art exhibition is not\n\nAnother form of exhibitionism\n\nWhere the body is reaching toward another body\n\nUntil body touches body\n\nEven if the body never touches the body\n\nThe day after Andy’s LA show ended\n\nSo did the life of Marilyn Monroe\n\nAugust 5, 1962\n\nAn excess\n\nTo be driven by what is greater than desire can hold\n\nDesire is a black

Some residents claimed the irrational fear stemmed from the possibility that he did not know what he was expected to do. Others thought that he was a lucky coward who found himself having to oversee a strategic security portfolio which he did not deserve or understand.\n\nMr. Gubuzela `s political history was known only from controversial claims -- made at every opportunity by the man himself -- about his war liberation credentials. The ordinary citizens were skeptical of his ability to turn around the national army into a truly professional, patriotic and non-partisan force that could be the envy of the region, if not the continent. It had committed untold atrocities in the country and beyond national boundaries.\n\nHe was once labelled a “Wild Useless Claimant” by a no-nonsense newspaper when he claimed that all the country`s political and economic woes were visited upon the nation by the “stubborn” opposition leaders, the ruling party`s detractors and their Western allies. He was a shameless bootlicker who heaped praises upon the ruining leadership with sickening frequency and subservience. A Grade Two primary school dropout, he had endeared himself to the leadership by worshipping them at every rally or meeting, and terrorizing any soul who challenged the big wig`s bigotry and destructive policies at every conceivable corner. He would declare,” Some of us died for this country. We won`t allow any person, especially from the opposition to rule this country. These sellouts without liberation war credentials are day-dreamers. Forward with our one and only revolutionary leader. Down with all the detractors! Down with illegal sanctions!”\n\nThen one day one foreign journalist decided to ask him one general question. “Sir, please shed light on what you are doing or intend doing as minister of defense to keep soldiers fit?”\n\nHe was clad in his civilian clothes in the form of dazzling yellow socks, white shoes, a red pair of baggy trousers, a green T-shirt, and a dark and blue, deeply cupped hat that seemed to bury his head and obstruct his view of the world. With exaggerated steadiness, he cleared his throat and said, “Soon l will start some friendly wars with neighboring countries”.\n\nNo, It Was Nosiness That Killed A Cat\n\nSimilarities Between Curiosity And Nosiness\n\nBoth curiosity and nosiness seem to have a thread that has words like: interest, concern, desire, inquisitiveness and attentiveness.\n\nDifferences Between Curiosity And Nosiness\n\nI think the two major distinctions between curiosity and nosiness lie in their intentional and behavioral manifestations and implications.\n\nWhat Does A Curious Person Seek?\n\nA curious person (e.g. a researcher) seeks knowledge, information and ideas for enlightenment and development. Curiosity is a strong desire to know or learn. It leads one to make an inquiry. Hence an act of curiosity tends to be positive, creative, developmental, unselfish and well-meaning. If curiosity is the urge to explore, interest is the reward potential in learning.\n\nWhat Does A Nosy Person Seek?\n\nOn the other hand, a nosy person (e.g. a timewaster or a gossip) often invades personal and private spaces for selfish, foolish and dubious reasons. Nosiness is an eager desire to find out about things that are usually not one`s business. It has an annoying,worrisome meddling element. Such meddling or poking tends to chase away friends or even family. Hence an act of nosiness is likely to have negative, destructive, selfish and even obsessive connotations and implications.\n\nDid Curiosity Really Kill The Cat?\n\nWhen people ask prying questions about something that is none of their business, are they not nosy? Or they are simply curious? If curiosity killed the cat is an idiom that seeks to warn people that being curious can get one into trouble, then wait a minute -is it not a misfit? Not being nosy? Well, maybe like matters of the heart, matters of semantics are subjective, etymological and problematic. What is your take?\n\nOf Pursuers And Priers\n\nFor instance, I think of a journalist or a researcher as a person who pries. Their job demands that they should have a measure of movement, investigation, inquisitiveness and attentiveness. Attentive to detail. I also believe that poets and authors, to some extent, are priers too.\n\nLet If Clauses Conclude\n\nSuffice to say if curiosity is likely to win one friends, nosiness is a sure way of winning one fiends. If curiosity is professional, nosiness is unprincipled. If curiosity is careful, nosiness is tactlessly eyebrow-raising! Again, who am I to say one is nosy, not curious? Matters of semantics fascinate and fuddle me too.\n\nA book review of 'Trouble for Sale' by Maina Wahome as reviewed by Ndaba Sibanda\n\n‘Trouble for Sale’ is a work of art whose title is intriguing and apt.\n\nJust like an opening, a good title can tantalize and magnetize potential readers and buyers alike. Such is the title of Maina Wahome’s action-packed political satire.\n\nThe title is intriguing and apt not only because it is denotative or evocative of ‘trouble’ that is brewing but also by virtue of its ability to galvanize a reader into exploring and toying around with a number of questions and ideas around that imagery.\n\nOne suddenly gets rained down by a downpour of questions: What type of trouble is this? Who are the sellers? Who would sell trouble? How? Where? When? The author manages to capture the imagination of the reader right from the title to the opening of the book where the playwright introduces social, economic, and political and ideological struggles and causes in style.\n\nThe action is chiefly and cautiously centred around Kamerukia who is a Member of Parliament for Mateseko Constituency, and a temperamental husband to Watoro, and his friend,Kimendero; Mwariama, who is Kamerukia’s lawyer, Mumbi, a university student; Tomboka, Kimakia’s lawyer; Menge, Mumbi Kanyoro’s lawyer, General Francisco, the leader of the Revolution Movement , Gati, the crowd mobilizer and Dada, a superintendent.\n\nThrough the play we see how social class divisions and the trammels of patriarchy play out before master and servant, and husband and wife, respectively. When Kimendero, a wealthy retired government official, visits his equally affluent and matrimonially-unfaithful friend Kamerukia, and is so impressed with the meal that he has been treated to that he showers praises upon Kamerukia’s employees, Kamerukia conceitedly reminds him that they are not doing his family a favor by doing their job well. If anything, his language reeks of abuse, arrogance, irritability and bossiness. He has no respect for his workers and wife.\n\nFor instance, he calls out Tsion, their house-help, to clean the dining table, and the housemaid rushes in, after she has done that cleaning chore, her “crime” is to ask,” Any other service, sir?” He gives her curt responses like “,Make yourself busy with household chores before l lose my temper” and “Now get out of here once. I have serious matters to discuss with my visitor”. His utterances are a clear sign of how he frowns upon those who do not have money and power as if they are lesser humans.\n\nKimendero pays Kamerukia a “business visit” to ask about “the counterfeit and contrabands” that he deserves or else peace can easily turn into violence, and war into peace. Goods have to be cleared at the port without scrutiny. Kimendero offers him a huge amount of money while Watoro, his wife, warns her husband that any acceptance of such a lucrative and shady offer is a betrayal of his kinsmen and country. His unmannerly and materialistic husband takes her advice as an act of insolence and interference. He warns and reminds her that ” l saved you from being a penniless spinster”. He reckons he did her a huge favour just his employees who are at his beck and call, just like offering his girlfriend an apartment. He believes that he is in the business of doing people favors.\n\nKimendero: The food is well-cooked. You have obedient servants in this compound.\n\nKamerukia: This is what l have employed them to do. They are not doing me any favor. The terms of service are: give me the best services because you do receive a salary. Kimendero! Kemendero! How many times did l call you?\n\nKimendero: (Stops eating and pays attention). Three times. Why ask me the obvious?\n\nKamerukia: Common sense is not common to all. It is as if you have forgotten what our beloved ruler tells us every day.\n\nKimendero: Which is…\n\nKamerukia: Jurisdiction. Yes, my friend. This is my apartment and the jurisdiction in this compound is bestowed upon me. (Moving closer to him). Therefore, you have no mandate whatsoever to question what happens in this compound.\n\nKimendero: (Devouring the meal with gusto). Haha! Jurisdiction. You still have the temerity to talk about jurisdiction. (Laughs again). In this country, the bourgeoisie are always the controllers of factors of production. They drive the best vehicles and live in the best apartments.\n\nKamerukia: See your life! You talk too much, my friend. I need a Dictaphone to record what you say.\n\nKimendero: Are you a government spy? Do you work for this incumbent government that has experiences in unprecedented looting spree in Nyeka? Listen Kamerukia, there is no hiding place for corrupt government officials. Corruption is endemic and it is needless to say that poor governance has led to poor infrastructure.\n\nKamerukia: That is why l am telling you l need a tape recorder or a dictaphone because you can talk pages. Have you forgotten you are a retired government official who never changed the situation of the common citizens? You cannot come to my own house to lecture me on governance .\n\nKamerukia has an interesting range of personal theories. For instance, he is of the opinion that money has powers to move mountains and fill gorges, that laws are for the underprivileged, that patriotism only exists in newspapers and dictionaries, that the arms of the government are managed by vultures and dinosaurs whose desires are insatiable, that in most third world countries, corruption is indispensable, and that justice and law are miles away like heaven and earth. He is also of the opinion he is doing Mumbi, a university student who is also his girlfriend, a huge favor by offering her an apartment that is located in the furthest end of the city, yet their bone of contention is that she wants to live within the capital.\n\nHis friend, Kimendoro on the other hand, is described by Tsion as a rich but mannerless bastard because she claims he sexually mishandled her. Similarly, Mumbi threatens to spill the beans ( the conersations) to Watoro, and even accuses him of rape. Mumbi pays the supreme price as she is murdered by a hired assassin. Those who are behind such horrendous murders are powerful men. They commit crimes with impunity. They are notorious. When powerful ,corrupt and proud people kike Kamerukia are finally arrested and ordered to sleep on the floor, one begins to feel that perhaps they have come hurtling down to Mother Earth.\n\nThere is a level of balanced showing and telling, vivid descriptions and settings; convincing, interesting, diverse and developed characters as the author explores the dynamics, dramas and debates over the distribution of wealth, the production factors like geography, demography and culture.\n\nInevitably, the reader is expertly transported, led and nudged into placing recent ,relevant and historical Kenyan political players and their unbecoming behaviors and antics under the microscope. Trouble is certainly brewing, trouble has taken centre stage. Evidently ,troublesome personalities have captured and personalised public institutions and procedures.\n\nThe ordinary people are in a dilemma. Political pranksters have put their priorities and power ahead of the wishes and aspirations of the citizens. Not to be outdone are church pretenders and entrepreneurs who use and abuse religion to prey on their supernatural power-seeking followers to further their selfish ends. Men of cloth have become false prophets or wolves in sheep’s clothing in a world full of miracle-hungry and gullible souls and congregants.\n\nThe characters’ actions make sense as the storyline’s mood affords the reader the opportunity to sense the senselessness of the injustices of brutality, power,pride and greed.\n\nThe style is fitting. Maina’s characters set the pages alight with their own animated presences, actions, footprints and voices. Voices of reason. It is a breath of freshnes. Wahome’s book is a soul-searching, damning and revealing mirror held up to Kenya, and by extension, Africa and beyond. ‘Trouble for Sale’ is an indictment of what is wrong with African politics. It is a moving depiction of the complicated drama of politics and economics, politics and religion. How does one follow a political trajectory that does not harm economics? What can be learnt from such trajectories and histories?\n\nMaina’ offering is a compelling and telling read. l would recommend it to readers, researchers, historians, economists, politicians and political aspirants. Never short of wordplay ,it is a worthy addition to the genre of plays.\n\nA Review of Paul Brookes’ book “Wolf Eye Territory” by “Spriha Kant”:\n\nThis book is the transmuted voice of the poet from fierce and bitter into soft as either or both of the two traits used to be predominant in most of his previous poems— unveiling the bitter truths/facts of the world in a sort of satire—like manner and motivating readers to fight against all odds fearlessly. The poetries that are audible of the poet’s fierce and/or bitter voice are “The Gust Says,” “The Rocks Say,” “The Skies Say,” and “Gust Says Too” (each poetry from his book “Wonderland in Alice: Plus Other Ways of Seeing”), “Age Is Youth,” “Work Is Sleep. When I Retire,” “My Strangers,” and “A Movement Is Death” (each poetry from his book “A World Where”), “Lawn Cutting” and “A Clock Watch” (each poetry from his book “These Random Acts of Wildness”). No change in the body language and attitude & no betterment in the mannerisms can change anyone’s core nature so is the case with the poet that despite the arrival of softness in his voice a few poetries could not disguise his core nature. Showing glimpses of his core nature below:\n\n“knifes sharp edge\n\nsound that hurts\n\nwound that won’t stop bleeding\n\nharsh voices”\n\n“Life as weeds struggle\n\nup between flagstones\n\nwintered in mourning.”\n\nThe poet’s transmuted voice is as attractive as the graceful gait of a voluptuous lady. This gait can be enjoyed by reading his poems “Worms Of,” “Have You,” “Bone Colours,” “My Mop Bucket,” and “A One Eye,” to name a few. The metaphors and personifications used in these poems have functioned like Kohl and eyeliners, adding attractiveness to the eyes of the voluptuous lady. The stanzas quoted from the different poetries below are the different shots of the attractive eyes of the different voluptuous ladies:\n\nQuoting the two stanzas from the poetry “Bone Colors” below:\n\n“The sky is a white bone\n\nmade of clouds.\n\nThunder is percussion\n\nof lightning against bone.”\n\n“Sometimes there are holes in the sky\n\nand you can hear a bone flute.\n\nNaked branches become Aeolian harps,\n\nplucked by gust, sky’s breath.”\n\nQuoting a few stanzas from the poetry “Gust Is Deaf, Hills Are Blind,” below:\n\n“Mountains are too tall,\n\nstruggle to talk when they can’t\n\nbend a knee, get down to those smaller\n\nwho are in awe when all mountains need\n\nis to speak face to face, dispel their myth.\n\nSame with water that rushes by,\n\nno time to stand and stare, moments pass\n\nbefore they have time to fully comprehend.\n\nFlux needs a still moment but has to go on.\n\nStill waters wish they could rush.”\n\nQuoting a few lines from the poetry “Have You” below:\n\n“Trees become lampstands ready\n\nfor the moonlight bulbs to be switched on\n\nin their crowns, meanwhile sunlight bulbs move\n\nfrom crown to crown. A shared lighting display.”\n\nInside every artist, there is a thrust for bringing versatility to his/her art compelling him/her to transcend the boundary of a particular/ a few different style(s)/form(s). This thrust has let the poet Paul Brookes transmute his voice which may ultimately lead him to the other end of the boundary.\n\nBios (Spriha Kant and Paul Brookes):\n\nSpriha Kant:\n\nSpriha Kant is an English poetess & a book reviewer.
