Blind Lake: A High-Country Gem

30 minute drive from Torrey to the Blind Lake trailhead

Dispersed camping available

No rentals on-site

Blind Lake, the largest of Boulder Mountain’s 80 lakes, is a stunningly scenic reservoir accessed by a relatively easy, 1.3-mile hike. To get there, take Scenic Byway 12 from Torrey for about five miles to a right turn onto the dirt Blind Lake/North Slope Road. The trailhead is about 8 miles from the pavement — a four-wheel drive, high-clearance vehicle is recommended.

From the trailhead parking area, the path to the lake meanders through aspen and Ponderosa pine trees past two smaller lakes — which, truth be told, are more similar to ponds than lakes. You’ll climb a gentle rise before the big reveal: a glittering, turquoise-hued lake framed by a craggy Donkey Point moraine on the far shore. The trail continues around the lake for about two miles, offering access to multiple campsites (Blind Lake is an excellent place for a short, family-friendly backpacking overnight.) and several open, though rocky, spots to hunker down for lunch, to cast for trout or, for the truly adventurous, launch a stand-up paddleboard.

You can circle the lake in either direction, but if you choose to go around counter-clockwise, consider making the mile-long, side trip to Green Lake, well-marked with a sign about a third of a mile from where you first viewed Blind Lake. Swimming at Blind Lake is allowed — though at an elevation of 10,000 feet above sea level, prepare for the water to be brisk. A cool breeze is a welcome constant, keeping the bugs (mostly) at bay. Be sure to stuff a windbreaker or puffy jacket into your pack as cool can quickly become cold at this high elevation.
