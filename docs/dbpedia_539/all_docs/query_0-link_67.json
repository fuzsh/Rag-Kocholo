Let's hustle!\n\nLUKE MILLETT (PRODUCER): Hey guys, welcome to episode 554 of the Chiro Hustle Podcast. I'm your producer, Luke Mallett, and here's your host, James Chester.\n\nJAMES CHESTER (HOST): So today we have the opportunity of interviewing Dr. Jason Helfrich, and if you want to hear the story about 100% Chiropractic and its franchise model, stay tuned. Alright guys, welcome back to episode of the Chiro Hustle Podcast. Today I have Jason Helfrich on this episode 554. Just going to be a real powerful 100% Chiropractic conversation. But before we get into this interview with Dr. Jason, I just want to let you know the big why, why don't we do it. We do over here, I'm going to go through as fast as I can. In a minute, we protect the freedom of speech of America with this show. We believe that's really important. Medical Freedom, Family Health Freedom, they're not the same thing, but we support both those with the show. BJ Palmer Sacred Trust, it's this last words. If you don't know what those are, go and search for BJ Palmer's last words to Sacred Trust. You're going to learn more about chiropractic than you ever knew before. I guarantee you. And then we believe in Subluxation-based chiropractic and innate intelligence and universal intelligence. We believe that man or woman, the physical, when they get adjusted, it connects them to man or woman, the spiritual. With that being said, Dr. Jason, what's role?\n\nDR JASON HELFRICH DC (GUEST): Jim, it's a pleasure to be here. I appreciate the opportunity to chat back and forth with a like-minded individual about this incredible profession that we share.\n\nJAMES CHESTER (HOST): Yeah, man. I'm over the moon about this opportunity to talk to you today just because I know that you've been doing a whole lot to support this beautiful profession from a business standpoint, as an entrepreneur, as somebody that's helped start a bunch of careers and helped this brand get stronger with 100% chiropractic. Would you mind just jumping in and tell us your story about how that all came to be?\n\nDR JASON HELFRICH DC (GUEST): Yeah, I know I'd love to. My wife and I both are chiropractors, Vanessa and myself. And as a second career, we decided to go into chiropractic. Both her parents are chiropractors. Both of them are successful chiropractors. And so we had long been chiropractic advocates even before we were in the profession. And so we were actually restaurants for our business. So we were in Denver, Colorado, as you and I were chatting about prior. And loving it, loving the business side of it, loving the wine and culinary side of it, I still do, but now more of a side-house-level. One day we decided we don't want to do this for a whole life. We had reached the point at a very young age. She was 21. I think I was 24 or 23 and a half or something. And we opened her own place in Colorado. So we had 50 employees and we were, you know, we were booming. And we one day said, we don't want to do this for the rest of our life. We're still very young. Why don't we change gears? And at that time we said, why don't you go to chiropractic school? We love what your parents do. We love the philosophy of chiropractic. Let's head off to Davenport, Iowa and do that. And so we sold our house. We sold the restaurant. We moved out there. It took me about three months to fall in love with the profession at that level. Or I said, there's no way I'm just going to stick around and work in a restaurant while you do this. And so I jumped in. We went there with a newborn baby. We had two more while we were going through school. And so we busted that up and decided to come home to practice in Colorado where we had some family to help us with the kids. Three kids are the age of five and wanted to help launch in that practice. So we launched 100% chiropractic in 2004. Had some success. I think we had more general business knowledge than the average chiropractor. So we felt real comfortable. We had run, I'd been regional managers for restaurants and all kinds of things at a young age. So I had some pretty good knowledge base on systems and organization and financials and everything that we needed. We experienced some success. About four years into practice. From our dream home or had our dream home and fun cars. But leaving this profession better than we found it is long but important to us. Amen. So we said, let's open number two. Let's just see. Is it us? Are we that special? Is it our systems? Who are we going to find? So we found some fantastic people that are still two of our most important people in the company today. Brandon and Rebecca opened up number two on the north side of town about four years after we opened. It did very well. That means we had to open three. Let's open four. Let's open five. We got to about 25 locations throughout the country. At that point, we're in about four or five states. And the attorney started saying, you know what, you're basically a franchise at this point. And so people are buying your logo, they're buying your systems. You're opening places that you really don't even go to. You need to be a franchise. I wasn't excited about it. Kind of from the definition of what people think in their head of a franchise. They're thinking McDonald's and they're thinking all these large companies that just cookie cutter approach to things. So we were open to it on a business side. We weren't extremely excited about it. Hindsight one of the best things we ever did for a lot of different reasons that we may or may not have time to get into today. But in 2015 launched the franchise. Now we're at today about 115 locations open in 23 states. We have another 45 and build out and we're making some pretty big moves right now to be number one in the profession. So we're doing everything in our power to show this profession how to do subluxation, base chiropractic, how to connect with the patient at a high level, how to make an extremely high income for the doctor where they can enjoy their life and love what they do and practice the way philosophically that's congruent with their values. And so that's long been our vision and our mission and enjoying the process.\n\nJAMES CHESTER (HOST): Man, the hair on my arms is standing up right now just thinking about everything you said congruency, making sure people have good quality of lives. The practitioners, you know, 40 plus that are in build out mode, 115 that are up and running like those are really nice stats. And you know, me coming from Davenport, Iowa, the fountainhead. It's really cool to know that you spent a couple years back there in Davenport. It's the story is really great man and your wife's both parents are chiropractors. So she was on this path like regardless of Jason was on this path or not, you're like the huckleberry.\n\nDR JASON HELFRICH DC (GUEST): You know what? I don't know why we didn't get into it earlier. She her, yeah, her grandparents are chiropractors. Her dad's chiropractor. So but it never had like really come to her mindset to like, I want to be a chiropractor. I love it, but just as never like I'm going to be one until one day. It's just one of those aha moments. I still remember it. We're driving, you know, through Parker, Colorado where we're building the house and we're just like, what are we doing? Like this isn't going to let us provide like I don't feel the value of serving people cold drinks and hot food every night. Like it's great. It's fun, but I'd rather be on the other side of that. And then during the week be able to just like go out and make a change in people's life and feel that value that I'm going to leave this earth better than I found it. I'm not going to do that certain hot appetizers and cold beer. And so let's change gears right now. Let's go back to school. You know, let's let's take a right when we are going to take a left and man, what an incredible decision it was because I can't imagine myself anything but a chiropractor.\n\nJAMES CHESTER (HOST): Yeah, I mean, it's really to me, you guys are living and maximizing the moments of life. And I think there's a lot of people out there that listen to our show that are going to listen and they're going to be like, wow, I'm not living big enough. I'm not I'm not I'm not finding my potential. And I'm not finding, you know, the freedom and enjoying, you know, there's a guy named Jill Polish. He's a part of this group called Genius Network. And he has this acronym that he loves called ELF, Easy lucrative and fun. And as soon as I started reading your bio, I'm like, this guy has perfected the ELF principle. You've made it easy, lucrative and fun. And you focus on chiropractic nutrition, you've figured out that software is a major component of this game. Marketing, like I could talk marketing for 12 hours. Sorry, we only have 30 minutes. It's cool that you figured out how to crack the code for billing. A lot of practices, that's a big snag for them. And then podcasting, I'm excited to talk to you about the entrepreneur of juggernaut as well. But I know that there's a couple of detail oriented things that we wanted to touch on today and weaknesses in the profession and how can we improve upon them. What would you say some of the major weaknesses are that you've seen over the time that you've been part of 100% and in school and where we are today?\n\nDR JASON HELFRICH DC (GUEST): You know, I think there's a couple of different ones here. And so I think chiropractic is long. That's biggest weakness has been not telling people who we are and what we do. And for so long, we've become what the society wants us to be. What insurance companies want us to be. What that we perceive the consumer wants us to be. And it's not accurate, right? But it's the easier conversation that people can have that and agree with people and say, yeah, neck pain, back pain, yep, three visits, yep, you get 12 on your insurance. Like, it's the bullshit that sinks the profession because people aren't telling people what they really need to hear. That's part of the other bigger problem, which I think is the mindset of the doctor of chiropractic, right? We have a profession with some of the most broke mindsets I've ever seen. And so many people have so many extraordinary gifts to give people, but don't have the business knowledge or courage or honestly work ethic to go out and make that happen. And until these people get that, they need that motivation. They need that confirmation of who they are and what they do to achieve great things. Not like many, unlike many other professions, I mean, 10% of us control the profession, right? 10% of us are seeing 90% of the volume. It's no shock to people. The key is that for us to move forward, right, for us to go from crossing that chasm of 14% to get it to a point where people understand what chiropractic is, we can't have 10% of us, right? We need 25, 30, 40% of us are brothers and sisters in this profession out with a successful practice. Whether they're pediatric or sport or I could care less about that. I just want them preaching the message of what chiropractic is, not trying to be a secondary doc and taking the scraps that are out there. And so when people have that mindset with patients, you become their primary source of knowledge for health. You become their family's health coach. You become their doctor. And so I think once chiropractors start to see that, get out of the broke mindset. You can live an extraordinary life and make the income of your dreams doing this, right? But at the same time, you're going to do it when you, your why is strong enough to get this across. I think that's a big weakness of the profession is people not having the courage to go out and tell people what they need to hear.\n\nJAMES CHESTER (HOST): Yeah. And I think a lot of it is association, like how do they see other people behaving and becoming successful and or lack of success? And I think that that's the thing too, is people mirror their colleagues. And I think that when you think about an operation like 100%, people are like, I'm just going to go do my own thing. And you know, I think a lot of times a chiropractor, in my opinion, they just want to be the guy or gal adjusting and doing a day one and day two. Like that's the dream job. Like that's the dream gig, like get paid well for checking, detecting and correcting for trivial civilization. Like like you said, if you want to do it for sports, cool. If you want to do it for kids, cool. If you want to do it for whatever demographic you choose to, cool. But I think that a lot of times we just have to get more chiropractors around more successful chiropractors. And I think that that's the linchpin of like, how do we get from that mindset shift is we just need people to start shadowing success. Yeah.\n\nDR JASON HELFRICH DC (GUEST): And I think also not classic chiropractic circle the wagons and shoot inward. And so when we see someone else successful, our immediate response, when I say are, I mean, our profession is to attack, right? They must be doing that because, oh, they don't provide value or they're not doing it right or they don't adjust a person or their philosophy or whatever. As opposed to even looking into the why behind it, I see this firsthand because you'd find very few people whose philosophy is as strong as myself and my wife's. We live it. I breathe it. I love it. I'm a subluxation based chiropractor to the core. I've seen my company attack so many times because of the size it has that they must be doing things the wrong way. Why are they why are they doing it this way that in all this type stuff? And it's like if they would just look in and have a conversation, which is why I love chances like this to get out and times that I'm at school on stages and stuff is to say, man, I'm with you. Like I'm with you, but there's some business values, some business concepts that have got to be brought to the profession. And it was the best thing the joint did for the profession. The joint brought accessibility to chiropractic. They showed people you can't have five days a week with different hours because you're here and there Monday, one to two or they were like, no, no, we're in a strip mall. We're paying the rent. We're here where you go and we're here Monday through Saturday. And we're here to adjust you. And there's some value in that. There's a reason that a lot of other successful businesses follow a similar model. So when we brought like, how do we bring the philosophy of chiropractic to that business model, right? And how do we mix those two where the right chiropractors are going to come in? And honestly, it's just magical to watch when those two mix because we've got to be successful. We're not successful. We don't donate back to schools. We don't provide scholarship funds. We don't, as you said, give and serve as a role model to other young students coming out. So we got to have success in this profession. And seeing 14%, 86% of the population we didn't see. So let's not fight over the 10% we do. Let's try to reach out to people and show them here's why you need to come to chiropractic. And they should be thinking that for ear infection, for migraines, for infertility, right? For so many different things, people should be thinking chiropractic first before they start thinking medical intervention, medication, drugs or surgery. And that's what we're really trying to do is reach those people that are not in the practices because that's how we change healthcare.\n\nJAMES CHESTER (HOST): Yeah, you know, I was just having a conversation in the past couple of days with some marketing people and we were discussing how the people that we would target before on campaigns, they've left Facebook, they've left Instagram. They're on different platforms like Rumble and Substack. So like finding the people from digital has shifted a lot recently too. And the way that we interact with our community shifted too. And everybody now is starting. I know there's research out there showing that people are losing faith in the medical world with MDs. And everybody's looking for something, man. They're looking for something they just don't know what's called chiropractic. And I think that that's the major crux of what we're talking about here is I know the second thing we wanted to kind of touch on is potential. What is the potential of the chiropractic profession? How do we adjust that?\n\nDR JASON HELFRICH DC (GUEST): Well, it's a perfect lead in for what you just said because going through things like COVID and everything that we go through, it now has a consumer asking the right questions, which is like, are you sure? Right. So for years and decades, whether you're talking about vaccines or anything, people just took what someone told them to do, whether it's a government or their MD or CDC or whoever, and just did it. They were good little sheep and they followed what they should do. Now when it plays out in front of everybody, people are starting to, I'm not talking chiropractors. I'm talking to the mom that's in suburbia with three kids is asking, why would I do that? Why would I get that booster? Why would I go? Why would I wear a mask? Why can't I have a say in my kids' education? All of these things, people are saying it's a big WTF moment. Enter the answer right now, which we can show them. I'm not anti-medicine. I think it's a great thing to have for emergency medicine and stuff. We need that. That's great. But what we need to also have is our place, which is prevention. It's the first line of defense to get into stuff. It's lifestyle enhancement. It's everything that we need, not just being pain free. This is an opportunity that's in front of us right now. If we don't seize it, if we're too busy attacking the person because they adjust this way versus this way, then we're missing an opportunity to go grab this massive piece of the population. The success of practices, that's one reason we want to do it. People are like the health of humanity is a bigger purpose here to reach these people and show them you don't need that drug to fight the side effects of another drug. Your first thing you need to do is not go get tubes in your ear. We need to teach people. There's another way. It starts at birth and it starts before birth. Here's how we want to educate our potential patient and our current patients who we are. You can't give a shit what people think about it. You can't care what people judge you about. I'm going to tell you what I know you need to hear and then how you respond to that is up to you. But I know that I'm going to tell you what you need to hear. That's our opportunity that we have right now. I fear that because of the weakness of our profession and a lot of the docs that we have, I fear we're going to blow it, to be honest with you. That scares me to death.\n\nJAMES CHESTER (HOST): You made it to Chiro Hustle! Sit back and learn from the greatest influencers in the profession on the world's number one chiropractic podcast.

Let's hustle!\n\nJAMES CHESTER (HOST): Well, over the past three years specifically, we watched medical theater. Like, they've dramatized it, they've scared us. I mean, they've gone through every evolution of like the longest movie in the world. And they've played every clip and every play and they've deployed every message. And the part that they never ever ever ever ever said was, go see your chiropractor. Like they dropped the, I mean, the mainstream like agenda, dropped the ball as to finding the next man up. And I think the next man up are the next woman up if you want, like it's always been chiropractic. But they didn't say, hey man, go join your local gym, get off or find food. Like go out there and start walking 30 minutes a day, get together and play games while you're locked down with your friends and family. You know, they weren't like, there was not one mention in this, the drama of the medical theater that we love all witnessed that said, hey, make sure your nervous system's functioning well. You should probably go see your chiropractor. Like if one small like mentioned like that, it's, it's like a different world we live in right now, but they neglected it. Like they always have.\n\nDR JASON HELFRICH DC (GUEST): And to their defense, some were saying it, they were just so filtered out that they wouldn't even allow you to hear that. So there were some great MDs and some great nurses that were absolutely coming to the forefront and they were just silenced. Right. So we didn't want to hear them. And some of them would have been the foremost experts in research. And we still didn't want to hear it because it was more of an agenda based approach to what medicine is. And I don't even know if it was really for the benefit of people, but you know, I think a lot of great people did come out and say that chiropractor's medical doctors, nurses, you name it. But we weren't allowed to listen to that because we had a certain way that they wanted the message to sound and it wasn't fitting, you know, what their message was.\n\nJAMES CHESTER (HOST): Yeah, it's unfortunate because there was a lot of dogma within that whole agenda that never supported people just being accountable for their own health. They never said anything like that, you know, get enough sleep, drink enough water, like read books, you know, tell people you love them, hug more people, you know, those types of things that like human connection things.\n\nDR JASON HELFRICH DC (GUEST): But they hold your card, which is the beauty of it because when they started saying things like, well, natural immunity is not as good as synthetic immunity. Even the Joe consumer started saying that's bullshit. Like, I know that's not true because I mean, I know that to be from my own life and I from things they had seen, they knew that wasn't true. And they know it didn't make sense when they're like, it doesn't work so far. This person sick, they had three shots. The answer is getting another shot. So people started. So it's almost great that they did that because again, that led people, the consumer to ask the question of what do I do that's best for myself and my family. And it's not just chiropractors now saying the things you did, modify your nutrition, watch what you eat, stress management, you know, meditation, prayer, go to church. So these are people now that are not chiropractors saying that as well, which is fantastic because that's exactly what they need to be thinking. So now if we have our message, it's stronger than ever and people like, you know what, I resonate with that group quite a bit. I think that's something I want to go do. So then people don't come in and say, well, my medical doctor says I shouldn't see you. Like even when people would say that to me in practice, like, I don't give a shit, I don't think you should see them, right? But I'm cared about you. My main goal is for you to get healthy as a patient. And so now when people start to focus on the patient as opposed to the philosophy of the doc, then we're headed the right way in healthcare.\n\nJAMES CHESTER (HOST): Let's switch gears just a little bit. Let's go like rapid fire. We have like nine minutes left, eight minutes left. Who are some of your mentors who helped you like fundamentally become the doc you are today?\n\nDR JASON HELFRICH DC (GUEST): You know, there's chiropractic in business because I feel like right now I'm such an entrepreneur. I'm always a chiropractor and love it, but I work so much in the business field. I tend to like disruptors. I tend to like people that really come in and shake up the profession that maybe aren't acknowledged up front, but are literally on the back end. So, I mean, BJ, themselves, they were probably the biggest disruptors in healthcare, right? And so we see what they did. I was a big fan and had a chance to actually have Fred Barge as a philosophy teacher in school. Fred Barge is one of my favorites. I love the philosophy of chiropractic. On the business side of things, you know, Elon Musk, Trump, I mean, people that just erupted things and make people think a completely different way, I love to watch that play out and I'd love to see what they're doing. Then I've, you know, maybe more, I guess what they'd be called safe mentors. I mean, I like Maxwell, I like Simon Sinek, I like T. Harbecher. I like a lot of different people who give some great concepts, whether it's the power of why or millionaire mindset or Michael Gerber in the E-Meth. There's some great, great tools that these people give if people would just start to read and listen to those books. I think that it's, they would be blown away how impactful that is to running their business.\n\nJAMES CHESTER (HOST): Yeah. I always like that segment of our show just because it allows people to tell us like, like where their fundamentals come from, how do they learn how to block and tackle, you know? Yeah, yeah, that's great. And, you know, I think it's really good. Let's switch mindset a little bit. Let's go towards the new grads. Okay. Say we got ourselves like, I think it's 12 quarters now or something. They pass part one. They'd like, you know, they're about to get their doctor of chiropractic from one of these awesome schools. What advice do you give them over the next six months?\n\nDR JASON HELFRICH DC (GUEST): This one hits home because my son's actually about three quarters of the way down to the life university of my oldest son. You know, I think that the key is to expose yourself to everything when you're in school. And so it's to listen is to experience it. It's to see practices that are run in ways that you hate. It's to see practices run in a way that you love, right? It's to go to seminars that you're not necessarily going to just agree with everything you say, but ones that challenge your philosophy a little bit and really solidify. And that's how we do it. We don't always remember the easiest teacher, the easiest coach in life. We remember the people that challenged us and made us think for ourselves and work through things. And so, you know, I think you experience as a student, you go out and see, you listen. You listen to this coach, you listen to that coach, you listen to this philosophy, check out that club. And that's going to dial you into where you want to be. And then it's watch. It's going in watch excellence in action. And so there's so many doctors within your community that would probably love to have you visit the practice. And just be a fly on the wall, right? Sit on the wobble seats and just watch what it looks like to have a doc see 150 in a day. And that way it solidifies that you don't think like, well, he can't take good care of that patient, that they can't be possibly getting good care because you start to see these breakthroughs of patients. You start to see a patient doctor connection like no other, way better than the one that sees their patient for 25 minutes. And so it starts to solidify your belief system of, holy shit, I can practice the way I want to. And I see that really plays out and works beautifully. So I think that don't just go to school, don't just jump through the hoops, don't just get through that, you have to do that experience, right? And then go out and make it happen after you've built your philosophy and your business structure of what you want it to look like.\n\nJAMES CHESTER (HOST): Yeah, that's really good stuff, man. Now let's talk a snapshot of marketing. What works, what didn't work and what do you like to do today?\n\nDR JASON HELFRICH DC (GUEST): Well, what worked when I built my practice with social media, right? So I mean, it was me, everything from, you know, if I wasn't hitting goals, I was going door to door and I was out at every farmer's market and Jim front desk and anywhere that would let me come out and tell my story. Social media changed the game for chiropractic. It continues to be a dominant force. I mean, we're driving 75 to 125 new patients a month per office just with our social media campaigns of what we can do. That's why the doctors out playing golf at the lake with their kids, watching football, whatever they're doing, these people are signing up. It's almost like doing an event virtually, right? You don't even have to be there. So I think that's extraordinary. I think that's a whole different level. You have to know how to play that game, what's your message look like? I mean, there's so many things to that, but we figured out how to play that really, really well and we've dominated in that field. That being said, it won't be around forever or at least we'll modify. And so don't hang everything you have on that, right? Because you don't want Facebook to change your analytics and all of a sudden you're screwed. So you dig roots in your community, you give before you request, you go out and you meet the local pop water team and sponsor the baseball team and be at the 5K and be in the shit that you need to be involved with to show that community. Like I'm part of this community. I'm not just here to make a buck. I'm here to actually change the lives and be part of this. So I think that's essential, constantly talking to your patient base about referrals, getting the family in. That's essential for many, many reasons. So I think there's a marketing, there's a lot of games to play and you have to play all very well. I certainly think I'd be lying if I didn't say Facebook, Instagram right now is the big fish and the possibility there is endless. It can be expensive, but if you know what to do with those patients when they come in, 200 leads me nothing if you don't know what to do with them. If you don't have a front desk person that knows how to handle them and turn them into patients, it's just wasted money. But if you do, it can be magical and you can build a practice now. I see practices built to million dollar practices in the first 10 months of opening and it's extraordinary to see what these people are doing because it wasn't even the mindset of me of how do I do 125,000 month one, right in revenue. And it's incredible to see some of these docs doing this out of the gate and social media has a lot to do with that, but you got to be good at it.\n\nJAMES CHESTER (HOST): It's really encouraging. I think that that's really important for people to hear. I'll just throw a couple of bones out there too. I think people should join their local chamber, BNI chapters and they should get to know other businesses in the community. I think they should go and build a relationship with the joint and take cases that are hot, like people that have a disc issue or that have like radiculopathy that the joint doesn't mess with and say, hey, I want to be a referring office over here in Scottsdale. Would you mind sending over your tough cases to me? That'd be awesome. I'll take one.\n\nDR JASON HELFRICH DC (GUEST): Yeah, you can get a lot of great patients that they don't take insurance.\n\nJAMES CHESTER (HOST): And then I say the other the other angle is to go make relationships at the area urgent cares and say, hey, I'm the area chiropractor. This is what we do. This is how we help people. If you guys have people that need help with their issues that we address, please send them over to us, you know, and build the relationship. Take those people out and get to know them. You know, they might be your golf buddies. They might be your every Thursday, you know, coffee morning person, but build your your community up with letting people know what you do, why you do it and who it's for and go to the obvious places, places that need what you do. You can go to a plot, a plot studio. You can go to a yoga studio, but those aren't urgent cares and those aren't the joint. So go to places that would like to send you direct referrals if they build a relationship with you. You can't get too sense on the whole marketing thing when it comes to building organically in your community. Let's close this one out, man. Tell us a miracle story. What have you seen something over your career that you just can't get it out of your mind. You can't shake it. It's always something on your mind.\n\nDR JASON HELFRICH DC (GUEST): You know, I think we as chiropractors take miracles for granted because they happen so much as you build a successful practice, you know, you'd hear three or four a day or you like, yeah, of course, like of course that happened. Right. I had a baby when you couldn't for seven years of being infertile when you were adjusted because we're not that shocked by it because for us, we've seen it quite a few times. You know, I have so many different stories from patients. I mean, it would be a whole podcast on it. I had a mom that called us out to the parking lot in tears and said that she had planned to kill herself the day before. Before she came into medicine, before she got adjusted, we also ended up adjusting her two kids. And every time they came in, I could never stop thinking about like, I mean, can you imagine the path that this was going down that it's not? And you know, I think there's so many that we hear about know that there's 10 for everyone that you hear about that you don't hear about. And these are people that you changed their life and often they weren't even people that stayed in your practice. Right. You just made such an impact why they were there that they've changed their mindset on giving drugs to their kids on how they're going to treat their family. I get my miracles down. This is the biggest thing when we stopped adjusting, you don't get that in satisfaction. I don't get patients coming up and hugging me. Right. I don't get that love that doctors feel people bringing me a cake and different things like that that patients do. What I do see is I see, you know, so many new patients coming through. And so when I start to see 10,000 a month, patients new patients coming through and I see over 2 million adjustments per year when I see the things that my company is doing. And my job is to inspire and motivate and make these great chiropractors and CAs and therapists in our company successful. And then I hear their stories on a regular basis. And you know, we talk about it all the time and there's thousands of miracles. Vanessa I long ago said we need to make an impact in this profession. We made an impact all those small in Colorado with our practice successful practice, but it wasn't going to change the world. It wasn't going to change our community at the speed we wanted to. Now when I start to look at, you know what, is we're starting to, that number goes from hundreds to thousands. Now we're talking millions of adjustments. That's starting to make an impact. And when we're talking about thousands upon thousands of new patients that hear the message, that's starting to make an impact. And I start to realize we go from 115 to 1500 of these locations, we start to impact the world of healthcare, right? We start to revolutionize healthcare, which I said when I had one office, or I see you back then, and she was like, whatever, whatever. But now I start to see it really come into fruition. So there's so many miracles. I wish I could share them all, but I mean, that was one that stood out in my mind, one of many. But it's amazing to see what's happening right now and how many people were reaching. That's where I get my motivation from and that's what inspires me.\n\nJAMES CHESTER (HOST): Well done, Doc. Well done, Jason. Such a good, good, powerful segment there. Is there anything I didn't ask you that you'd like to share with our audience today?\n\nDR JASON HELFRICH DC (GUEST): No, you did ask it, but I think if I had a closing thought, it would be just realize in some of these are cliche, but just how big what you can accomplish is in this profession. And there's truth to the fact that if you just attached and affected one patient, your whole career was worth it, I believe that. But know that for that one, there's another 10,000 that are waiting for you in your area. And you can't control the response. You sit them down, you empower them or educate them. We use the word empowerment in our offices, but you empower them to understand what's going on. You show them that X-ray. You show them how 10% of that nerve is pain and 90% is internal function. And you show them how that ties into how they're living their life. Depression, mood, headaches, laziness, poor relationships, everything. And you start to paint a picture for what health really is, right? Physical and mental and emotional well-being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmities, back to Dorland's medical dictionary. You show them how they can live a life full of purpose and full of love and full of happiness. And people will line up at your door to get in there. And they will gladly pay your fee and allow you to build the life that you want. So just don't sell yourself short, I guess, to be what I'm trying to say. And don't give up. It's hard to build any business. It's hard to build a restaurant. It's probably hard to build a dry cleaner business. I bet it's tough cutting hair. But the people that bust their ass and make sure that they keep at it, build dynamic businesses that create value and change the world. And that's what I want people to realize is how big what they do is.\n\nJAMES CHESTER (HOST): 100% chiropractic for the win. People want to work with you. They want to learn more about you.
