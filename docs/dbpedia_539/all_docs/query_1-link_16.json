        "text": "Digital Demand Takes Off!\n\nHere’s Our New Digital Press\n\nWant to learn more about how this technology can help you? Call us today!\n\nRose City Label has recently added more cutting edge digital printing capability. Our full color digital, dry toner printing provides crisp detail on both coated and uncoated label stocks. The press set up is very fast and efficient, which is good for the environment and cost effective for the customer.\n\nThe quality is outstanding. Once the roll is printed, it is moved to a second machine for cutting. This all digital process doesn’t use ink, actual cutting dyes, or plates. The image is cut from a digital file that we create from your artwork. No more charges for special shapes or sizes.\n\nAny size, any shape, we can do it all. On this machine the label is laminated with a protective film die cut, and waste is removed to leave the finished label complete and ready to ship. This is the digital advantage and this is the future of short run, full color label printing.\n\nFor more information, call us today.\n\nIt’s Rose Festival Wine Time Again!\n\nRose City Label is again pleased to partner with Oak Knoll Winery to produce the commemorative Rose Festival Wine.
