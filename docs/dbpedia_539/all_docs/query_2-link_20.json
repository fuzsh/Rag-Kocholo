After Helfrich reached a settlement with the other driver’s insurance company, Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (BCBSA) and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City (BCBSKC) sought reimbursement for the benefits paid, as provided in the terms of the Plan. Helfrich appealed the district court’s judgment requiring her to reimburse BCBSA and BCBSKC (together Blue Cross) because the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act of 1959 (FEHBA) preempted a Kansas insurance regulation prohibiting subrogation and reimbursement clauses in insurance contracts. Finding no reversible error in the district court’s judgment, the Tenth Circuit affirmed.",
