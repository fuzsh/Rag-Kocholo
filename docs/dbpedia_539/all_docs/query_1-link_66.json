        "text": "Longtime Beatlefan contributor Dave Hinchberger wrote the prologue for Bill King’s new book “LARGE TIME: On the Southern Music Beat, 1976-1986.” Here is an excerpt from it. …\n\nWhen I was 14 in 1976, my family of seven moved into my grandmother’s home on the outskirts of Atlanta. Living in a small Southern town, with no way of getting around on my own, I had to entertain myself at home, either with family, friends, TV or music.\n\nMusic took me away, energized my soul and made me feel the world was at my feet every time I turned on the radio. Radio was all I had then, but it was grand. Southern rock permeated the radio waves, along with national hits. The bands that I grew up with — Mother’s Finest, Atlanta Rhythm Section, et al. — I later learned were not familiar to some folks outside of the South. This was surprising, but I eventually discovered bands well-known in their parts of the U.S. that I’d never heard of, either. Music was everywhere; all you had to do was listen.\n\nI always looked forward to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution weekend papers, a breath of fresh air in this small town, containing pop culture I craved — music, TV and film. It was always the music articles and reviews that I went to first. I was already a Beatles fan, listening to 8-track tapes and radio my parents played in their Opel station wagon. “Help!” and “A Hard Day’s Night” … I distinctly remember traveling and singing these powerful anthems with them. My grandmother worked at the local five and dime, and they had this two-album set, “The Beatles Rock ’n’ Roll Music,” a collection with gleaming foil printing, the band on the cover. Man, I wanted that album. The Beatles were everywhere in my life as I was growing up.\n\nIn 1976, I also became a Kiss fan after hearing “Kiss Alive” and “Destroyer” at a friend’s house. The music was powerful, harder, and, well … alive! Being a teenager, that driving rock spoke to me. Music … I was energized by it all.\n\nIt was during this time I began noticing that most of the music articles in the weekend paper were written by this fellow Bill King. There were many pieces on The Beatles, Paul McCartney and Wings, John Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. When I started reading Bill’s articles, The Beatles all had solo and/or band careers, and there was plenty going on, with new album releases, tours (Paul with the Wings Over America tour, a big deal that year), The Beatles’ Hollywood Bowl live performance on vinyl, Beatle cons, all of this and they hadn’t been a band since 1970?\n\nAfter fervently reading Bill’s pieces all year, I got up the courage to write to him, to tell him how much I appreciated his work and what it meant to me as a music fan, and, especially, a Beatle fan! It was a first for me; I was 14 and writing a letter that began an almost 50-year friendship that continues to this day.\n\nWe moved into Atlanta on Tuesday, Aug. 16, 1977. Yes, the day Elvis died. Writing this now, it seems to be a portent of sorts, considering the career I was going to have. I began 10th grade at Northside, a performing arts high school, which exposed me to more of the arts (“Fame” was released in theaters my senior year).\n\nBill invited me to come see him at The Atlanta Constitution, located downtown. Finally, the Martin Luther King holiday (which was only an Atlanta holiday at the time), offered me a day off from school and Bill set it up for me to come down and take a tour, Jan. 16, 1978. The bus dropped me right in front of the AJC. I saw my first newsroom … and Bill took me down to see where they printed the paper (loud!). It was all fascinating and a grand day.\n\nBill would receive a pair of tickets to review concerts for the paper. I assumed his lovely wife, Leslie, went with him to these shows. I soon discovered she only went to certain shows, and most of the time the extra ticket wasn’t used! From that point on, I would get in touch with Bill to see what shows he would be reviewing, and he was a good man to let this teenager tag along.\n\nA concert I distinctly remember was The New Barbarians (May 1979), which included Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood (my first Rolling Stones!) bassist Stanley Clarke (big fan), Ian McLagan and Bobby Keys. What a show! It was the first time this young man saw a woman stand up on her seat, turn to the crowd before the show, and take her top off! Arms raised high and waving around with the lights on. I remember looking at Bill, amazed, and he said, “Yep, at these shows anything can happen.” You might say it was my first introduction to the “sex” part of “Sex & Drugs & Rock ’n’ Roll” (nod to Ian Dury).\n\nI began working for Oz Records as a senior in high school — a dream job, not only because the whole place was decked out with yellow brick roads, flying monkeys, and a video screen setup as the Great Oz theater, but I was working … in music. My friends all were jealous that they worked fast-food and other retail jobs while I was involved with in-store appearances by The Ramones, Johnny Rotten (he had us play the new Dolly Parton record), Philip Lynott of Thin Lizzy, Molly Hatchett, etc. I was 16 and having the time of my life.\n\nThere was so much going on with The Beatles, too, with new music collections, biographies, solo releases, etc. So much was going on that, in 1978 Bill and Leslie King had created Beatlefan, now the world’s longest-running Beatles magazine! They both worked after-hours to put out this informative and magical publication, and I would stop by the Beatlefan offices in Decatur in the late ’70s and early ’80s and help Bill and Leslie with whatever needed doing. There was always plenty of Tab (the diet cola) and snacks on hand, to keep us going.\n\nMeanwhile, I became a store manager at Oz Records, and then I was hired to work at Polygram Records, starting on Jan. 4, 1985.\n\nI was all of 22, and my life suddenly had changed forever. I spent almost 10 years working for a major record label. These jobs aren’t advertised, so the fact that I even was able to interview was sheer luck. The fact that I was hired out of so many that wanted to work there was akin to winning the lottery — not in funds, but in experience.\n\nWithin six months, Polygram had released Tears for Fears’ “Songs From the Big Chair,” which became a big hit, selling almost 5 million albums — an exciting time. I also was working with Kool and the Gang, Sting, Deep Purple, Bon Jovi and, yes … Kiss!\n\nHey, we didn’t have a Beatle, but Polygram had plenty of bands I enjoyed and was able to spend time with. So many stories, wonderful times, as I tell my wife LeeAnn. I’ve been out of the business over 30 years, but those stories are still so fresh — I mean, this was the time of my life!\n\nSpeaking of stories, Bill has blessed me with a few over the years. Like the time he spent three days with Charlie Daniels up on his farm in Tennessee, visiting and interviewing him for a major article. Then there’s the trip to Augusta: He’s with James Brown, cruising down the road, eating fried chicken along the way. Here’s Bill interviewing, and James is speaking in between bites and licking his fingers. What a story! (Actually, Bill tells me, they ate the fried chicken before they got in the car, but I prefer to picture them eating it on the road — what an image!)\n\nAnother time, Bill was at an interview session with Paul McCartney for his film “Give My Regards to Broad Street.” When the interview concluded, Bill introduced himself. It turns out that Paul already had heard of Beatlefan. Wow! We make our own luck, and Bill, working diligently on the magazine for years, certainly made his, and wound up sitting next to a Beatle at a conference table.\n\nWhat I took away from working at Polygram has helped me in so many ways today as a bookseller, a writer and especially as a publisher. See what happened there? I went from my life in music, to a life of publishing, just like my good friend Bill. Who could have seen that coming?\n\nI’ve been a fan of Stephen King since “The Shining” paperback was released in 1977, so much so that I named my company The Overlook Connection, based on the hotel from the novel. I collected his work and would sell off my extras in Stephen King’s newsletter, Castlerock. Eventually, I began selling books through my own catalog and then started publishing other writers’ work. In fact, Stephen King wrote an introduction to one of our titles in 1996. Stephen King has 7.2 million followers on Twitter, and he follows 165 — one of which is our Stephen King Catalog account. I now write and edit the “Stephen King Annual,” a full-color production with articles, interviews, art and photos.\n\nDoes this sound familiar? It should, because Bill King’s influence on what I’ve done for the past few decades can be felt in every corner of who I have become. Bill’s encouragement made quite the impression on this young man — in music and in publishing. I’ve always admired and respected his accomplishments. Although I’m sure he didn’t realize it at the time, he certainly was a mentor to me.\n\nHere’s the catch to what I mentioned above about luck: Some things in life are chance, but, for the most part, we make our own luck. It all began for me at 14, writing to Bill. I wrote that appreciation because he showed me a wider world with his reviews and views on music; he made a difference. Now, I find myself at my writing desk working on this prologue for Bill’s book, almost 50 years later. Someway, somehow, Bill King has influenced my life all these years.\n\nI received a package one day, not long after I sent that first letter to Bill as a teenager. The return address was from The Atlanta Constitution, a complete surprise. It was from “the” Bill King, with a note thanking me for the kind letter. Along with it he had sent an actual 8×10 print photograph, taken by an Atlanta Constitution photographer, of Gene Simmons of Kiss performing at Atlanta Stadium earlier that year.\n\nAs a 14-year-old who couldn’t afford much (I didn’t even own a Kiss record yet), I was stunned beyond belief. What a generous soul to make this young man smile.\n\nYears later, Bill told me that my note to him was the first fan letter he ever had received. He’ll bring this up in company sometimes, me grinning and shuffling my feet. I’ve always been proud of that letter. Who knew it would lead to this moment?\n\nHere I am, writing the ultimate “fan letter,” now at the grand age of 61. You’ve come a long way, my friend, and it’s an honor to write to you again, Bill, albeit with a wider audience this time.\n\nSo, when’s the next show?\n\nWith much affection,\n\nDave Hinchberger\n\nThe full version of this essay appears in “LARGE TIME: On the Southern Music Beat, 1976-1986.”\n\nYou can purchase the book for $39.99 each postpaid in the U.S., $69.99 each postpaid outside the U.S.\n\nAdd $10 to the cost\n\nif you’d like a numbered, signed copy!\n\nSend a check, money order\n\nor credit card information to:\n\nThe Goody Press Books\n\n3009 Delcourt Drive\n\nDecatur, GA 30033\n\nYou also can pay via PayPal to goodypress@gmail.com,\n\nor via credit card at 404-713-6432.\n\nAddress all inquiries to goodypress@gmail.com.\n\nFor an order form, go to\n\nIt was early fall 1969, my senior year of high school, and the guy sitting in front of me turned around and asked whether I’d heard “Abbey Road” yet. I’d known Charles for two years, but not well. I was surprised to find out he was a major fan of The Beatles.\n\nCharles and I quickly became friends and discovered another couple of Beatlemaniacs in our class, Mike and Jimmy.\n\nBeing seniors, with all our tough courses behind us, we basically were cruising through that year, just marking time at Athens High School until next year, when we’d go across town to the University of Georgia.\n\nSo, we worked a scam where the teacher in charge of the hour of study hall we had each morning thought we were going down to the ROTC department to “work on records” (we were all officers in the cadet corps).\n\nInstead, we’d head out to Charles’ car to listen to The Beatles.\n\nOne day, while walking down the hall on our way to the parking lot, we got caught by one of the assistant principals. She and the teacher didn’t entirely buy our explanation, so, after that, we were forced to go down to the ROTC office and actually check in. Of course, then we would sneak out and go to the parking lot, so Charles could play us his growing collection of Beatles 8-track tapes.\n\nRemember 8-tracks? Was there ever a worse format for listening to music? And yet those clunky cartridges were all the rage that school year, with car units a big thing. Stores devoted entirely to 8-tracks had even sprouted up. In fact, it was at such a place, called Tape Town, that Charles had found our favorite tape of the moment — a “bootleg” called “Kum Back,” consisting of songs from The Beatles’ unreleased “Get Back” album.\n\nWe quickly became addicted to this collection of rough mixes taken from one of Glyn Johns’ acetates that had escaped Apple Corps.\n\nAs I recall, it didn’t take us long to settle on “Two of Us,” “Let It Be,” “Teddy Boy” and “Long and Winding Road” as our favorites. I particularly liked “Two of Us.” When Charles would come by my house to pick me up to go record hunting, he’d have that song cued up on his car tape deck when I got in — because he was that kind of friend.\n\nAthens didn’t yet have a progressive rock radio station, where the “Get Back” tapes generally were played, but the two local Top 40 stations recently had started weekly progressive programs, where they aired acts like Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin late on Saturday nights — “Electric Circles” on WDOL and “96 Dimensions” on WRFC.\n\nWe started calling them up to request they play some of our unreleased favorites — particularly “Two of Us” and “Let It Be,” which a couple of weeks later we got to see The Beatles doing in advance clips from the “Let It Be” movie on Ed Sullivan’s “Beatles Songbook” special.\n\nWhen the finished versions of the songs finally came out that spring as the “Let It Be” album, the 8-track of that album got major playing time during our “Beatles study hall,” too.\n\nCharles and I also went to see the film when it hit town in May. (Earlier, we had caught Ringo and Peter Sellers in “The Magic Christian” and became big fans of Badfinger, the Beatlesque band on the soundtrack).\n\nOne Sunday afternoon in February, one of the local stations held a Beatles vs. Elvis marathon, where you could call in and vote for your favorite. Knowing all the rural areas the station reached, Charles and I figured we were justified in voting about a dozen times apiece for The Beatles — but Elvis still won.\n\nMeanwhile, we didn’t take the release of a John Lennon solo single, “Instant Karma!,” as any sort of sign that The Beatles might be in their last days. The British music weeklies had been covering the disintegration of The Beatles, but we didn’t see them; nor did we see Rolling Stone, which wouldn’t show up on our local newsstands until that June, when I bought my first issue — the one focusing on “Let It Be.”\n\nSo, we weren’t aware of how close the band was to breaking up. After all, John had put out a couple of other singles, plus those avant-garde albums. Those were just sidelines, we figured.\n\nBesides, there was that surprise Beatles album that suddenly had shown up in stores!\n\nCharles called early in the morning on the last Saturday in February to say he’d seen it the previous night at Woolworth’s and that it wasn’t the “Get Back” album.\n\nI ran out and, pooling two weeks’ worth of lunch money (my only source of income since my part-time sports rewrite job at the local paper had ended), I bought the $5.98 list LP on sale for about $3.98. It was called “The Beatles Again” (later “Hey Jude”) and was a strange collection of tunes ranging from “Can’t Buy Me Love” and “Paperback Writer” to “Hey Jude” and “The Ballad of John and Yoko.”\n\nI called up the DJ on the air to find out what he knew about it.\n\n“That’s a bootleg,” he said, thinking I was talking about “Kum Back.”\n\n“No, it isn’t,” I said, reading him the track listing.\n\n“Wow, that’s far out. We don’t even have that yet at the station!”\n\nCharles and I decided that what local radio needed was a proper audio history of the Fabs, and we were the ones to do it.\n\nUnfortunately, we never got any farther than a title. We called it “The Beatles Anthology” — a name that would resurface some 25 years later. Oh, and we decided to call ourselves Goody Productions, after our nickname for our ROTC teacher, Col. Gooding H. Bean.\n\nCharles was a much more diligent ROTC student than me. We wore uniforms and drilled a couple of days a week and, as the public information officer my senior year, I kept the battalion scrapbook and wrote up ROTC events for the school paper, the Thumb Tack Tribune, where I was a staff member.\n\nThe rest of the time, ROTC students mostly listened to lectures on military history and watched old training films (which usually revolved around a fictional Lt. Hanley), as well as episodes of the Army-produced TV series “The Big Picture.” Charles and I were among the cadets who made fun of those films when the teacher was out of the room.\n\nSo, for the issue of the school paper that came out the last day of the school year, I wrote a column satirizing those outdated films being shown to the slumbering students in the ROTC department’s basement auditorium.\n\nCol. Bean wasn’t too thrilled with me when I made it to ROTC class that day, but the main upset in the Battalion was one of the more gung-ho students, whose girlfriend had misunderstood a couple of the “senior predictions” that another staff writer and I had compiled for that edition of the Thumb Tack.\n\nHe loudly was threatening to take me outside after class and exact his revenge. The colonel took me into his office, and I explained our attempts at humor. He surprisingly seemed cool with it.\n\nWhen class started, he told everyone that he thought they should hear what I had to say, so I stood up and explained that the wordplay that had the upset student’s girlfriend (who thought we were implying he’d been unfaithful) meant nothing of the kind. The senior listed before him in the predictions was a girl whose last name was May and we’d simply written that she “May or may not.” To continue the pun, for the student listed next alphabetically in the predictions, we wrote that he “definitely does.”\n\nThat just happened to be the angry cadet who now was threatening me. But I explained that it was just random luck that the joke was part of his prediction. And the colonel told everyone he thought my explanation was satisfactory.\n\nAt his urging, the angry guy shook my hand, and that was the end of it.\n\nShortly after class, when Charles and I left campus to treat ourselves to lunch at a nearby steakhouse, he still was chuckling. “You talked your way out of another mess,” he said. “I thought sure you were going to get your ass kicked.”\n\nThen, high school finally was over, but because of problems at the printer, we ended up not getting our yearbooks until midsummer, so we missed out on the mass signing sessions that traditionally were held in the gym.\n\nCharles brought his yearbook over to my house and I signed it. He signed mine, and since his was the only entry, it took up an entire page.\n\nIn part, it said that “listening to tapes in my car was fun not only for the listening but because we fooled [the teacher] and got her in a lot of trouble.”\n\nAs for ROTC, he wrote, “I guess there will still be sleeping masses in the basement, but will Lt. Hadley still excite them as much as he did us?”\n\nAs we headed to UGA that fall, Charles and I continued our Beatles listening sessions. One night, he called me excitedly about a new bootleg LP he’d found in one of those here-today-gone-tomorrow local hippie record shops that tended to pop up in college towns.\n\nI rushed down to get a copy, and it was quite a treat, since it included The Beatles’ fan club Christmas messages (which we’d never heard before) and some of the band’s terrific BBC radio performances (which I believe were mislabeled by the bootleggers as the “Decca audition”).\n\nFrom there, our respective bootleg collections grew as we ordered various LPs from dealers in the classified ads section of Rolling Stone, our new favorite magazine.\n\nEventually, through one of those ads, I discovered that there was such a thing as Beatles fanzines. But before I’d learned about them, I already had started playing with the idea of a Beatles newsletter of some kind and would photocopy prototypes. I always sent them to Charles, who was very supportive.\n\nThat eventually would become Beatlefan, and Leslie and I named our company the Goody Press, inspired by that name Charles and I had picked eight years earlier.\n\nAlthough everyone had called him by his first name, Charles, in high school, his family used his middle name. So, when I’d call his family home and ask to speak to Charles, whoever answered would say, “Sure, hold on a second” and turn from the phone and holler “Leonard!”\n\nEventually, he started going by Leonard in general, but to his high school chums, he was always “Charles.”\n\nOnce we were out of college and working in the adult world, with me in Atlanta and Charles still in Athens, we didn’t get together nearly as often, but we attended each other’s weddings, and I took Leslie over to Charles’ house one night for one of our bootleg listening sessions.\n\nHowever, as our lives and careers developed, we only saw each occasionally, usually at class reunions, where we’d always make sure we shared a table.\n\nThen, one Sunday in 2010 or 2011, as my brothers and I were chatting with our Dad, who moved to an assisted-living facility after Mom died, I felt a hand on my shoulder and looked up.\n\nIt was Charles! It turned out that, not only was his mother in that same facility, but she also was one of Dad’s daily meal companions, as they’d ended up being assigned to the same table.\n\nAfter that, Charles and I used email and social media to communicate on a semi-regular basis. I was amused that, instead of signing emails “Charles” or “Leonard,” he used “Izzy,” a play on his last name, Isbell. To me, though, he was always Charles.\n\nSometimes, when I wrote articles or columns about high school or college or UGA football, Charles would contribute memories.\n\nWe spent a lot of time chatting together when the Athens High School Class of ’70 finally had our pandemic-delayed 50th class reunion in May 2022. And we continued to message. That’s how, in February 2023, Charles told me he wasn’t well, but he was undergoing treatment and was hopeful. I called him up and we had a long conversation, laughing about our past misadventures and our old classmates, and updating each other on our grandchildren.\n\nI was looking forward to our 55th reunion and getting to see Charles again.\n\nThen, I got a call Sunday from another longtime friend, who told me that his wife had heard that Charles had died the day before. I searched for an online obituary and, to my dismay, found that she was right. My old Beatle buddy is gone.\n\nOf course, I’m at the age now where Charles certainly is not the first friend I’ve lost, but that doesn’t make it suck any less.\n\nI smile, though, at the memories. I’m really glad that Charles turned around that day in homeroom.\n\nBeatlefan Executive Editor Al Sussman offers a counterpoint to some fans who’ve been whining about various aspects of the reissue of “Let It Be.” Here’s his more evenhanded impression of the 1970 film’s restoration. …\n\nWell, I watched the new, spiffed-up “Let It Be” a day or so after its Disney+ debut and, most immediately, the sound is a major upgrade.\n\nAlso, although I’m not the best judge of picture quality since I’m legally blind, it looked great to me.\n\nI first saw “Let It Be” in mid-May 1970, and I didn’t find it depressing then or now, especially after it ended with the Jan. 31 filmed session of them doing “Two of Us,” “The Long and Winding Road” and “Let It Be,” and the rooftop performance from the day before.\n\nAs for the one little bit of tension between Paul McCartney and George Harrison, which can be seen in fuller context in “Get Back,” it doesn’t make this a movie about The Beatles breaking up. It never was about that, and it’s not now.\n\nThat said, the original film is choppy, with virtually no context provided. But that’s the way rock documentaries were made back then — seen “Gimme Shelter” or “Mad Dogs & Englishmen” lately?\n\nStill, a casual observer who really doesn’t know The Beatles’ story and never has seen either this or “Get Back” is going to need some crib notes to know what’s going on.\n\nWhy are they on a movie studio soundstage and then suddenly in a small studio? Who’s the Black guy behind the keyboard who materializes out of nowhere, and who’s that little girl in attendance?\n\nObviously, Peter Jackson had a much larger palette to work from in painting his conceptual picture of the band at work in “Get Back,” but the uninitiated are going to be bewildered during “Let It Be,” until that wonderful last third of the film.\n\nAs for other tropes that have grown up around “Let It Be” through the years, if you saw “Get Back,” you know that Yoko Ono wasn’t a disruptive presence during the sessions and Paul wasn’t as domineering as decades of revisionist history have made people think.\n\nThe restored “Let It Be” is basically as it was in 1970, save for the sound-picture upgrades, a Peter Jackson-Michael Lindsay-Hogg chat as a prelude, and a different ending, with session outtakes over the credits.\n\nIt’s not in widescreen, so the rooftop session does look better in “Get Back.” And the street-level reaction scenes intercut into the rooftop performance are still there, as they were in “Get Back.” If you have a problem with that, don’t watch it.\n\nBesides, the reaction scenes are part of the story of that performance, and they belong in any film version of it. If you just want the music, Spotify and Apple Music have fine audio packages of the rooftop session.\n\nAnd, please, spare us months of bed-wetting over whether/when a physical version of the restored film will be released. Disney+ has had “Hamilton” for a couple of years and there’s never been a video release of that. We’ve already had to endure months of whining about the video release of “Get Back” not having any special features. For “Let It Be,” let’s just wait and see.\n\nFinally, in answer to the question of why we still need “Let It Be” when we have “Get Back,” the original film deserves a reissue of some kind, despite its limitations, because of its place in “the story” of The Beatles, and because it contains material that Jackson chose not to use in “Get Back.”\n\nAl Sussman\n\nMore on ‘Let It Be’ …\n\nHere’s another fan’s view of the restored version of Michael Lindsay-Hogg’s film. …\n\nBeatlefan reader Mark Helfrich got to see a preview of work on the restored version of “Let It Be” last year and told us about it at the time.\n\n“The original director of photography, Tony Richmond, oversaw the color restoration,” Helfrich said then, adding that “the film looks better than it ever has, and to my eyes, superior to the amazing job Peter Jackson did on ‘Get Back.’ The reason why is this is the actual film we’re seeing — it has film grain. Sure, it’s been cleaned up, meaning there’s no film scratches or dirt, but the clarity is there — you can see the pores and hairs on their faces!”\n\nAfter the restored film debuted on Disney+ in May, we heard again from Helfrich about differences between what he saw in 2023 and what is streaming now.\n\nHelfrich said that, based on what he saw on Disney+ and what he has read, he believes that sometime after he previewed the film last year, Jackson’s digital restoration team added some digital “softening” to the movie’s images.\n\n“Thankfully, they didn’t go nearly as far as Jackson did with ‘Get Back,’” Helfrich said, but “contrary to what I reported last year, this release’s visual is not simply the film cleaned up and color restored with the most modern tools, which is a pity because it looked so great.\n\n“Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy ‘Let It Be’ is once again available and looks and sounds wonderful — but it isn’t presenting a restored film look anymore. There are content differences too — of course, the United Artists logos aren’t there anymore, and the black barn-door transition wipes between Twickenham and Apple, and between the Apple studio and the roof no longer exist.\n\n“And the film doesn’t end with a freeze frame and ‘The End’ in Beatles font while Paul riffs over ‘Get Back’ anymore.\n\n“Now, we have no freeze frame, just a cut to black for a bunch of credits for the 1970 and 2024 versions over an ‘Oh! Darling’ take and other session tunes, which is fine. The sound is so superior to the original it’s a definite improvement (with a bonus “fuckin’ hell” from George!).\n\n“So overall the rerelease is phenomenal, but I wish Apple would’ve just let it be the pure FILM restoration without Jacksonizing it.”\n\nHelfrich also noted that “surprisingly, the conversation between Peter Jackson and Michael Lindsay-Hogg which precedes the film, has been badly re-edited since I saw it last year, too.\n\n“Now, it is very disjointed, as if they are not talking to each other — just soundbites which don’t really flow. And the bit about Jackson calling ‘Let It Be’ really the fourth part of ‘Get Back’ is gone.\n\n“Granted, it was longer than its current length of 4:30, but it was better before. Maybe when it’s released on Blu-ray they will include the longer version.”\n\nWe pointed out to Helfrich that Disney and Apple say that Jackson went back to the original 16mm film negative for his digital restoration.\n\nHelfrich’s response: “It may be that Jackson’s company did the scanning and cleaning of the 16mm negative, and then that was color corrected, supervised by Tony Richmond,” who got a credit in the Disney streaming version.\n\nHelfrich suggested that perhaps after Richmond worked on the color “perhaps further ‘adjustments’ were made to the look of the film back in Jackson’s camp. That may be why there is a VFX supervisor, a VFX production mManager and four VFX artists listed in the credits.\n\nIn any case, Helfrich said, “what I saw, copyrighted 2023, isn’t what’s out in the copyrighted 2024 version.”\n\n***\n\nFinally, Beatlefan contributor Jim Trawicki had a brief email exchange with “Let It Be” director Michael Lindsay-Hogg in mid-May that provides a couple of footnotes to the history of the film.\n\nTrawicki had read that Lindsay-Hogg’s original cut of the film that he showed to The Beatles, before it was trimmed for its 1970 theatrical release, ran 210 minutes, and he asked the director whether that cut is still around anywhere in any form and whether it might it be issued at some time.\n\nLindsay-Hogg replied:\n\n“Jim, the first rough cut I showed them was maybe 100-110 minutes. Never near 210.\n\n“And no, alas, [the trims were] just chopped out and put back in the bins.\n\n“So, the current version is, cut for cut, what was released in 1970.”\n\nLindsay-Hogg added: “It’s hard to believe how primitive it was when you were cutting on film — a sharp knife and scotch tape and unless you had a dupe made, nothing was saved, not like now where you can save cut after cut on the machine.”\n\nA review of Philip Norman’s “George Harrison: The Reluctant Beatle” by Senior Editor Brad Hundt appears in Beatlefan #265. Hundt found the book to be “eminently readable,” but also a “by-the-numbers biography” and concluded: “Everyone who already is familiar with Harrison safely can take a pass on it.” Below is a mixed — but somewhat more enthusiastic — appraisal of Norman’s book. …\n\nHow swell at last to have a major biography of that most aloof of all rock stars, George Harrison, by respected pop music historian Philip Norman, and how sobering to learn that the reclusive rocker’s feet were all too completely made of clay.\n\nThough this book is quite detailed and very well written, what is still a worthy biography could have been splendid if not for several shortcomings.\n\nPerhaps the book’s top theme is George Harrison’s remarkable cornucopia of contradictions, something he alluded to in the “Pisces Fish” song on his superb last album, 2002’s “Brainwashed” — “Sometimes, my life it seems like fiction / Some of the days it’s really quite serene / I’m a living proof of all life’s contradictions / One half’s going where the other half’s just been.”\n\nMassive contrasts define Harrison’s story. With bomb craters from World War II still decorating his neighborhood, he grew up in a crowded little Liverpool apartment with no bathroom, whose only heat came from a “small coal fire,” and where the weekly bath was in a backyard bucket. But massive musical success would earn him enormous wealth.\n\nHarrison was the Beatle most in the background, whose growing songwriting abilities largely were ignored by the group’s leaders, John Lennon and Paul McCartney. But after the Fab Four’s 1970 breakup, the lead guitarist stunned everyone with his astonishing “All Things Must Pass” triple album, becoming the most critically and commercially successful Beatle of the early 1970s.\n\nIt is comforting to learn how Harrison usually was kind, caring and giving. Not only did he co-write “It Don’t Come Easy” and “Back Off Boogaloo,” two of Ringo Starr’s biggest solo hits, but he also did not ask for a (quite lucrative) songwriting credit for either.\n\nEven when sick in bed, dying of cancer, he offered to visit the drummer’s ailing daughter.\n\nBut Harrison was a stubborn loner who often was moody and brutally blunt. As Ringo put it, “There was the love and bag-of-beads personality and the bag of anger. He was very black and white.”\n\nIndeed, when Lennon queried his bandmates on what they thought of his girlfriend and future wife, Cynthia Powell, Harrison remarked she had “teeth like a horse.” While the second Mrs. Lennon, Yoko Ono, conceded “George was very nice,” she still complained how “very hurtful” his caustic comments could be, to which John would shrug, “That’s just George.”\n\nAnd on a long flight, when a stewardess asked the softly chanting Hindu convert if she could get him anything, Harrison snarled, “F— off, can’t you see I’m meditating?”\n\nThe supposedly most spiritual Beatle, who publicly sang warnings about “Living in the Material World,” privately luxuriated in a 25-bedroom gothic mansion. And the Beatle purportedly most at peace as a devout Hindu nevertheless smoked lots of marijuana, drank loads of liquor, snorted copious quantities of cocaine and chain-smoked French cigarettes.\n\nHe also was an inveterate adulterer, who cheated in his own house (when his first wife Pattie was home) with Ringo’s wife Maureen. This was a conquest too far even for John, who denounced it as “virtual incest,” and the affair led to the Starrs divorcing the next year.\n\nSurprisingly, the composer of so many beautiful love songs, including the classic “Something,” did not appear to be all that romantic. He betrayed both of his spouses, and he did not seem to mind losing his first wife to Eric Clapton — who remained his best buddy.\n\nWhile Harrrison enjoyed most of his time in the world’s biggest band, and all the easy camaraderie, by the latter 1960s he firmly rejected any more concert tours and had grown deeply bitter that more of his compositions were not allowed on Beatles albums. Later calling himself “the economy-class Beatle,” he felt liberated when the group finally broke up, and he never sought a reunion.\n\nAsked to help Sir Paul perform “Let It Be” at London’s 1985 Live Aid Concert, George’s typically tactless retort was that McCartney “didn’t want me to sing on it 10 years ago, so why does he want me now?”\n\nDespite his enduring shyness — during his Beatle days, Norman notes, “no more private person can ever have trodden a stage more mercilessly public” — George organized the massive Concert for Bangladesh at New York City’s Madison Square Garden in 1971, spurred by his friend, sitar player Ravi Shankar. Although he was so nervous backstage that he suffered bouts of diarrhea and vomiting, Harrison’s pair of concerts were rock music’s first and possibly best benefits, and the album featured Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Badfinger, Billy Preston, Leon Russell, George, Ringo and many more. Harrison also worked hard to make sure the proceeds actually went to hungry Bangladeshis.\n\nHe would continue to be very charitable, ultimately providing $45 million to UNICEF projects in Bangladesh and elsewhere, as well as giving substantial financial support to Romanian orphans.\n\nLikewise, George was generous with family and friends, buying houses for his mother-in-law and a Beatles staffer. He made major contributions to Hindu charities, and even risked losing his beloved Friar Park estate by putting it up as collateral to finance his Monty Python buddies’ controversial 1979 big-screen comedy “Monty Python’s Life of Brian.”\n\nYet he was embarrassingly cheap with his own loyal staff, and the megamillionaire dissolved his first marriage by paying his most important muse a paltry £120,000.\n\nHe was the “Quiet Beatle” in public, but wouldn’t stop talking in private settings, where he was much more comfortable. Still, while he could be pleasantly social and even play host at a party, Harrison much preferred gardening to people, since, as he explained in his frank fashion, “the flowers don’t answer back.”\n\nNorman’s book is unusually well-written, especially for a rock star biography, and it is likely not a coincidence that the author also is a novelist and playwright. Harrison’s life is told chronologically in extraordinary detail, especially concerning his growing up and his time with The Beatles. It was a revelation to realize just how materially deprived George’s childhood was, but how comforting to learn what a close, loving family he had. This makes his moody cynicism all the more mysterious.\n\nNorman’s narrative reveals a magnificent musician who, despite often being tone-deaf to others’ feelings, did not just mean well, but (usually) did well by his friends and so many strangers through his considerable philanthropy.\n\nThe author appears especially partial to Harrison’s dry and even gallows humor. It is remarkable to read of his being carried out of his house on a stretcher in late 1999, having almost been killed by 40 stab wounds from an insane intruder, and him asking a pair of new housekeepers, “What do you think of the job so far?”\n\nLikewise, he named his last album “Brainwashed,” because of his terminal brain cancer, and published its songs under the name of R.I.P. Music Ltd.\n\nBut Norman’s apparent fondness for his subject does not inhibit him from pointing out painful facts. Likewise, the biographer is balanced and fair covering all the major players in Harrison’s orbit.\n\nHaving written an earlier book about The Beatles, as well as biographies of Lennon, McCartney, Clapton, the Rolling Stones, Jimi Hendrix and Sir Elton John, the author has an encyclopedic knowledge of many of pop music’s major players from the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIndeed, the Harrison biography sings best when telling of George’s time with the famous Fabs. He was in what would become the world’s biggest band from when he was not quite age 15 until he was 27; these were the most dramatic and important years of his life and critical to his development as a person, musician and composer.\n\nThe book brims with compelling descriptions of each of The Beatles and their relationships with one another, as well as the staff within the group’s growing empire. Norman also provides plenty of memorable observations about the larger London pop scene, conveying the cultural context on which the band fed and, to a considerable extent, led.\n\nIn light of how strained the foursome’s internal dynamics would become by the late 1960s, it truly is touching to learn what extremely close friends they were for most of the dozen years they were a team. It also is reassuring to read how well they ultimately overcame their differences, as their Beatles past became an ever more distant blur in the rearview mirror.\n\nBut what could have been an outstanding biography is not one, due to several needless drawbacks. One of the most tiresome is when the book occasionally burrows way too deeply into utterly irrelevant minutiae about not just Harrison’s Beatles days, but trivial players from that time, about whom only the most fanatical fans care. Who buys a George Harrison biography for mundane details about long obscure local Liverpool bands from 1960?\n\nAnd although the author bemoans how Lennon and McCartney ignored Harrison too much, he spends an excessive amount of time on The Beatles’ dynamic duo. Having written biographies of each, he might have found their pronounced personalities more interesting than that of the self-effacing Harrison.\n\nAs captivating as this biography generally is when recounting George’s formative and Beatles years, just 153 of the book’s 440 pages address the period after The Beatles — the majority of his life — and his last two full decades are crammed into a mere 55 pages.\n\nSo, Norman fails to devote remotely enough attention to the 31 years of Harrison’s life when he finally enjoyed the freedom to be completely who he wanted to be.\n\nThis is all the more regrettable because George made a remarkable number of excellent albums of his own during this period, as well as with the Traveling Wilburys, the supergroup he formed with Dylan, Tom Petty, Roy Orbison and the Electric Light Orchestra’s Jeff Lynne. Indeed, Harrison appears to have enjoyed being a Wilbury more than being a Beatle, since his second band was genuinely democratic and egalitarian.\n\nGeorge also did much as a film producer and philanthropist. In fairness, Norman does touch on all of this, but not enough for the reader to develop a full understanding of any of it. Instead, when covering Harrison’s later years, the book reads like it is just hitting the big news events, with little analysis.\n\nThat brings us to the biggest flaw of the biography: After reading it, I now know far more about Harrison, but I doubt I really understand what shaped his character and drove him.\n\nThough Norman’s book is full of intriguing, fun and sometimes unsettling anecdotes, I still cannot say I truly appreciate why Harrison acted as he did. And the book ends without even attempting to draw any conclusions about its protagonist.\n\nThis is a shame, particularly considering Norman’s considerable research and writing talents.\n\nA final quibble concerns the embarrassing number of missing words, typographical errors and misspellings in the text. It is stunning how big publishers now are comfortable putting out works riddled with basic writing errors.\n\nNevertheless, “George Harrison: The Reluctant Beatle” is, overall, a very well-researched and well-written biography that boasts loads of fascinating facts. Most importantly, it brings attention to an extraordinarily talented artist who never has gotten the respect he deserves, due to being overshadowed by the greatest songwriting partnership of the 20th century.\n\nNorman has made a significant contribution to elevating Harrison’s place in the pop music pantheon, which is a very welcome development.\n\nDouglas Young\n\nDouglas Young’s essays, poems and short stories have appeared in a variety of publications. His first novel, “Deep in the Forest,” was published in 2021 and the second, “Due South,” came out in 2022. His next book, “This Little Opinion Plus $1.50 Will Buy You a Coke: A Collection of Essays,” is about to be published.\n\nBeatlefan first was published just before Christmas in 1978, so we’re marking its 45th anniversary. Through various landmark anniversaries in the past, Executive Editor Al Sussman, our original New York correspondent, has interviewed Bill and Leslie King about how the publication came to be and their adventures through the years. Here’s a new conversation to mark the magazine’s 45th birthday. …\n\nThe first issue of Beatlefan had an interview with former Wings drummer Joe English. Did the interviews in those very early days come about through your “day job” covering music at The Atlanta Constitution, or through other sources?\n\nInitially, most of them came via my job at the paper. That certainly was the case with the Joe English interview, which was set up before Beatlefan even came into being.\n\nAs I explain in the first part of my Beatlefan Annotated series in Issue #265, prior to being tapped to drum in McCartney’s band, New York native English had been living around Macon, Ga., then a music hotbed thanks to Capricorn Records and the Allman Brothers Band. He’d played in a pickup band with Butch Trucks of the ABB.\n\nI’d first met English while he still officially was a member of Wings when he attended the annual Capricorn Records Barbecue outside Macon in August 1977. At that time, he was very enthusiastic about the sessions for what turned out to be “London Town.” “It’s going to be another ‘Band on the Run’,” he told me.\n\nWhen Jimmy McCulloch left Wings a month or so later, I talked with Joe’s wife, who indicated he would continue with the McCartney band.\n\nBut, then, a couple of months later, the Wings Club Sandwich newsletter announced that English had decided to “return full time to his family in America.”\n\nA few months after that, in the spring of 1978, I got word that English was in Atlanta doing some work at a local recording studio with Tall Dogs (the jazz-rock group he’d started earlier with Butch Trucks), and that he was willing to chat about his career.\n\nSo, I spent some time with him at the studio and he talked at length about his time in Wings. I wrote the story up for the Constitution and then, later that year when Leslie and I decided to start Beatlefan, it seemed like a natural cover story.\n\nDuring the early years, many of the interviews we did continued to come to me through the newspaper, including my chats with the surviving members of Badfinger and Tony Sheridan, but as Beatlefan became better known, the process sometimes was reversed, with me getting interviews for our magazine that I later repurposed for the paper. Walter Shenson, producer of “A Hard Day’s Night,” was one of those instances.\n\nThis might sound completely primitive to younger folks, but describe how a typical issue of Beatlefan was created in those early days.\n\nIt was a very different process from nowadays. These were the days before desktop computer publishing. Back then, the articles written for us came via the mail in manuscript form produced on typewriters — or, sometimes, even handwritten! (Our contact with contributors was either via long-distance phone call, mail or mailgrams, which were delivered like a telegram.)\n\nI compiled the news from clippings sent to us — and various music trade publications we subscribed to — and wrote everything on a typewriter — first an old-fashioned one my Dad had bought me in college, and then an electric model like we used at the paper in those days.\n\nI would edit the articles with a pen or marker, and then Leslie would typeset them on Compugraphic equipment owned by a college pal, Gene Christie, which necessitated evening trips after work to the little room he rented in town about a half hour away from us by Interstate highway.\n\nThe Compugraphic would spit out long (I’m talking several feet long, in some cases) columns of type that then had to be trimmed, waxed and pasted up in page form. Those forms then would be copied by the neighborhood Kwik Kopy shop that printed our early issues on uncoated white paper stock.\n\nWe didn’t get an office until early in 1979, so I pasted up that first issue on the kitchen table of our apartment, with only a borrowed X-acto knife and wooden rolling pin as my tools. No wonder some of it’s a bit crooked! After we got the office, my artsy-and-craftsy mother built me a light table like graphic artists used, which made the paste-up process much easier.\n\nIn later years, after Gene moved to Washington, DC, we’d send him the copy, he’d typeset it and then he’d overnight the galleys (as those long strips of type were called) to us for me to paste up. After the first several years of publication, we moved to a format that featured a glossy cover and newsprint pages inside, and the magazine was printed by a weekly newspaper about an hour away from us.\n\nEventually, in 1991, we bought the first in a long series of Apple Macintosh computers (the old LC model), and so there was no more outside typesetting. I would print out the stories from the Mac, but I still pasted them up on the light table. The photos were “screened” (so that they consisted of tiny dots) at a local print shop, and they were pasted down on the pages just like the type.\n\nWe switched to another printing company in the early 2000s, where my brother Jonathan worked as an account rep, and eventually we followed him to the company that has printed Beatlefan since 2008. These days, the production is all digital — the magazine pages and photos are provided in PDF and JPEG form to the printer. And, of course, we run full-color covers.\n\nI also should mention that my brother Tim helped us out with many a mailing of Beatlefan in the early years, in addition to attending quite a few McCartney concerts with me.\n\nOne of the perks of that “day job” was that you got to attend a number of press conferences and more informal Q&A sessions with Paul, Ringo and George. Any memories from those sessions?\n\nI’ve participated in quite a few press conferences with Paul and Ringo through the years, but my first one-on-one interview with a Beatle was George, in 1976 at a press gathering in Washington, DC, after he signed with Warner Bros. He chatted casually with reporters at a reception and then, as a seated dinner wound down, I went over and knelt by him with my tape recorder and interviewed him. It was quite a thrill.\n\nAlso quite thrilling was the hour that I got to spend with Paul (and about five other reporters from Eastern papers) in a small conference room at the Plaza Hotel in New York City, when he was doing advance publicity for the “Give My Regards to Broad Street” film. As I’ve written in Beatlefan in the past, I got there early, correctly guessed where Paul would sit and positioned myself to his immediate left. I got to ask lots of questions and also snapped pictures while he talked. It was an unforgettable experience!\n\nBeginning with that first issue, there have been Beatlefan interviews with virtually every major Beatles figure alive during the magazine’s first 45 years. Any special ones come to mind?\n\nWell, Walter Shenson, whom I mentioned earlier, was pretty special. That happened at Beatlefest, as it was known then, and was arranged by Mark Lapidos. (As I explain in the blog post I did a couple of months ago about how Beatlefan came to be, Mark always has been considered the honorary “godfather” of our magazine.) I later spent time with Walter at other Beatlefests, and even got recruited to go out onstage with him in the ballroom once to interview him. And, in later years, he and I chatted on the phone a couple of times.\n\nLegendary Beatles and Apple Corps publicity director Derek Taylor was another special case. I first interviewed him in Liverpool, when Leslie and I were attending a fan convention there at the Adelphi Hotel. He was, as you might imagine, a marvelous interview subject. — extremely loquacious, debonair and charming.\n\nA few years later, he had a book coming out for one of the “Sgt. Pepper” anniversaries, and the publisher’s publicist set up a phone interview. Derek not only remembered our previous encounter, but he recalled that I had a beard, and he quoted something I’d said in our earlier interview.\n\nThen, years after that, when “The Beatles Anthology” was about to premiere, ABC set me up with another phone interview with Derek, who modestly told the publicist handing him the phone that there was nothing he could tell me about The Beatles that I didn’t already know.\n\nThrough the years, I have interviewed many other Beatles relatives, friends and associates, including Cynthia Lennon, May Pang, Mike McCartney, Alistair Taylor, Vic Spinetti, Leo McKern, Pete Shotton, Jürgen Vollmer, Sid Bernstein, Phil Ramone, Jack Douglas, Elliot Mintz and quite a few members of McCartney’s various bands. And, of course, we’ve had numerous interviews with other Beatles-related figures that were conducted by various Beatlefan contributors.\n\nOther than the obvious (John, Brian, Mal), are there any interviews that were near-misses, either for you or any of the contributors?\n\nWell, we never had a near-miss with him, but the Great White Whale would have been Neil Aspinall. But there never was a chance of that happening, for us or any other publication (though we did run a chat with him during “Anthology” times that was provided by EMI). I also would have loved to chat with Maureen, Ringo’s first wife, but she wasn’t available, either. And, of course, Jane Asher would have been a terrific interview, but she never has talked publicly about her time with Paul and The Beatles. But, generally, through our vast network of contributors and correspondents, we’ve gotten interviews with just about everyone involved with The Beatles who has a story worth telling.\n\nLeslie, tell us the story of seeing a copy of Beatlefan on the episode of CBS’ “48 Hours” devoted to Paul’s 1989-90 tour and calling Bill, in those pre-cell phone days, at a hotel in London during the U.K. leg of the tour.\n\nLeslie: CBS devoted the second anniversary edition of “48 Hours” to Paul on tour. I saw it on TV, and the Chicago Beatles fans being interviewed kept positioning a copy of the latest Beatlefan to catch the camera. I got very excited and called Bill at the hotel in Marylebone to tell him about that unexpected experience.\n\nBill: I was in London with my friends Mark Gunter and John Sosebee to see a couple of Paul’s shows at Wembley Arena and do some Beatling. We all got a big kick out of Leslie’s call about the show, and when we got back to Georgia, we watched the video. The fan CBS was following was Joy Waugh-O`Donnell, who was a subscriber to Beatlefan.\n\nBill, tell us about the story of the unnamed source who saw a copy of Beatlefan at, if memory serves, Paul’s Cavendish Avenue home?\n\nActually, it was at Paul’s studio. Someone we’re in contact with was waiting to talk with Paul and was browsing his bookshelf and came across a copy of Beatlefan. Ironically, I believe it was an issue that had John Lennon on the cover!\n\nPaul and Ringo’s return to touring in 1989 ushered in a new era for Beatlefan. Tell us about how the tour reports began and developed, and your and Leslie’s adventures during the early tours.\n\nThose early tours were monsters to deal with, coverage wise, as we still were in the days where people were sending in clippings and snapshots, and we really were inundated.\n\nIn those days, we did a detailed, city-by-city report on all the shows, since the tours weren’t of the never-ending variety, like they are now.\n\nAs for adventures, one time Ken Sharp and I were interviewing some of the members of Macca’s band before a show at Madison Square Garden and then, in trying to find our way out, we found ourselves on the floor of the arena, with Paul and the band onstage waiting to do a sound check! He obviously was waiting for us to leave, so we did.\n\nAnother time, Ken got me and Allan Kozinn seats right in front of Ringo — literally just a few feet away from him — for a show with the Roundheads at the Bottom Line club in New York City.\n\nAnd then there was the time that my brother Tim and John Sosebee and I accidentally ended up on an MPL van that took us into the backstage area before a show at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. I’ve told that story before in a SOMETHING NEW blog paying tribute to John, whom we lost last year.\n\nThrough the years, I traveled extensively following Paul and Ringo tours, hitting such places as New York, Philadelphia, Atlantic City, Dallas, St. Louis, Memphis, Orlando and London. Leslie and our kids also have seen shows in such places as DC, Houston, New York, Virginia, Alabama, Mississippi, Nashville, and multiple shows in South Carolina and North Carolina.\n\nThese days, though, I generally only hit one show per tour. Not only am I a lot older, but the cost of concert tickets has skyrocketed. Back in 1993 when Paul toured, some friends and I hit shows in New Orleans, Memphis and St. Louis, before returning to Atlanta for Paul’s concert there, and then following him to Columbia, SC (with my son Bill in tow), and then on to Orlando. Later in that same tour, we hit shows in New Jersey and Charlotte. Nowadays, even if I wanted to want to hit the road like that, the cost of seeing that many shows would be prohibitive.\n\nAs for our coverage, while we still report on the tours in Beatlefan, we don’t really do the city-by-city thing anymore, since there rarely is much difference from one venue to the next. Instead, we report the highlights of the tour and then zero-in on one or two cities, with firsthand coverage from contributors who were there. Last year, I did one of our major tour reports after Leslie and I and our kids saw Paul at the Wake Forest University stadium in North Carolina.\n\nHow did Beatlefan’s 1994 Threetles scoop come about, and how did it get international coverage? And what was the literal “kick” to the story?\n\nLongtime readers will have read this before, and I wrote about it in a Quick Cuts blog a few years back, but we had just closed out an issue of Beatlefan and took it to the printer the night before.\n\nI had taken some vacation time, because we were expecting our second child at any time. I got a phone call from one of our contributing editors that afternoon. He had just gotten off the phone with the manager of one of Ringo Starr’s closest friends. He said that Ringo, George Harrison and Paul McCartney were in the studio recording a John Lennon song, “Free As a Bird.”\n\nThis was big news. We’d already reported that the three Beatles were planning on recording together, but until that point no one knew what song.\n\nLeslie and I immediately decided to put out an issue of our Beatlefan/EXTRA! supplementary newsletter with the scoop that evening, and also to print enough additional copies to insert them into every copy of the magazine that had already gone to press as a free bonus. The Beatlefan/EXTRA! fax subscribers received the news that evening (remember when people had fax machines?) and the newsletter mailing went out later that night. Thanks to Allan Kozinn, The New York Times picked up the story and attributed it to Beatlefan, which got us mentioned widely (and even led to a couple of calls to us from London papers).\n\nSometime in the early hours of the morning, Leslie woke me up and told me that she was in labor. We took our son Bill over to the next-door neighbor’s house and then we set off in the car for the hospital.\n\nAlong the way, we ran into one roadblock and, as I was racing down one of Atlanta’s major thoroughfares at about 85 mph, an Atlanta police car suddenly pulled up beside us. I rolled down the window and hollered, “Woman in labor!”\n\nThe officer nodded and escorted us to the hospital, leading the way with blue lights flashing, and our daughter Olivia was born a few hours later.\n\nAs I’ve always told her, a lot of kids hear interesting stories from their parents about the circumstances of their birth, but how many of those stories involve The Beatles and a high-speed police escort?\n\nUnlike the out-of-the-blue shock of John Lennon’s murder, Beatlefan had time to prepare for George’s passing. You and I talked tentatively about it as early as July of 2001. What sort of plans were you able to make, and how did the magazine’s coverage actually turn out?\n\nI touched base with you and several other contributors in advance and discussed what we’d do if George passed. That meant we didn’t really have to scramble, like we did in December 1980, when we tore up our second anniversary issue, which was almost complete, and decided to turn it into a Lennon commemorative. For George, we fully planned commemorative coverage, and I was very pleased with it. I think it had some of our best-written pieces ever.\n\nAn interesting side story was that I had been the copy desk chief for The Atlanta Journal, our afternoon paper, after leaving the entertainment beat in 1986, but a few weeks before George died, the Journal had been merged into the morning Atlanta Constitution and I had been moved back to the Features Department, where I’d worked many years before as the rock critic. I helped edit the daily living and arts section.\n\nBut, for a few months, the combined papers continued to do an early afternoon edition. I worked the early morning shift in Features and was at the paper and saw on the wires that George had died. A few minutes later, one of the assistant managing editors came by my desk and asked if I would be willing to write an obituary on George (my Beatles sideline was well-known at the paper).\n\nI was honored to be asked, and immediately agreed to do it. My story on George ran on the front page of the Journal-Constitution and also was distributed nationally over the New York Times news service. It ran in papers around the country.\n\nAnother thing I recall was that, unlike John’s death, which came out of the blue and left me virtually no time to really react, because I was so busy covering it, George’s passing was something we were dreading but expecting. And, perhaps because of that, it hit me quicker, emotionally. Whereas I did several TV and radio appearances talking about John right after he was killed, I begged off when asked to do the same after George died. I just didn’t want to talk about it.\n\nWe talked 10 years ago about Beatlefan’s journalistic stance from the start. Do you still get any complaints from readers don’t like the tone of a review or article?\n\nRarely. While some folks in the very early years of Beatlefan were surprised to see a fanzine that wasn’t afraid to say an album released by a Beatle was subpar, I think fandom has moved past that point. If anything, I hear from people who hate this or that album (“McCartney III,” for example) and can’t understand why we didn’t hate it as well. Fan opinions vary much more widely these days than they did back when we first got started.\n\nSpeaking of journalism, one thing that I’ve always been pleased by is the way professional journalists have embraced Beatlefan. We’ve had quite a few of them as regular contributors through the years, including Brad Hundt, Allan Kozinn and Rip Rense.\n\nAs we’ve discussed before, Beatlefan is a print publication. How do you answer queries about why there isn’t a digital edition?\n\nI tell people honestly that we’re creatures of the print world, and we just don’t have the time or inclination to deal with a digital edition as well. We looked into that possibility briefly a few years ago, but the logistics involved were a lot more complicated than we wanted to take on. Maybe if we ever stop printing an ink-on-paper magazine, we’ll think about going digital.\n\nFinally, where do you see Beatlefan and the Beatles world in general in five years — 50 years after the magazine’s inception?\n\nWell, Paul and Ringo are older now than Leslie and I will be then, and they’re still recording and touring. We’ll just have to see.\n\nYou can read Bill King’s reminiscence about how Beatlefan was born by clicking here.\n\nAnd you can read the 35th-anniversary conversation with Bill and Leslie from 2013 by clicking here.\n\n“Wings Over the World.”\n\nThat was the proclamation I quite thoughtfully had inscribed beneath my high school graduation yearbook photo. Because “Wings Over America” seemed a bit understated for how I truly felt about that band during those musically formative years.\n\n“Wings Over America,” the classic live album from Wings’ 1976 tour, was released midway through my freshman year of high school, and when I graduated in June 1980, it was “Coming Up” — specifically the “Live at Glasgow” version — that sat atop the chart.\n\nAnd, yes, I know that, however sincere Paul McCartney was about presenting Wings as a true democracy, that never would — and never could — come to pass.\n\nIndeed, much has been written in the pages of Beatlefan about whether Wings should be considered for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in addition to Paul having been honored on his own for his solo — or, to be more accurate, “post-Beatles” — work.\n\nValid arguments can be made both for and against such a nod. And, I’ve got to confess, I think inducting Wings would be akin to inducting the Plastic Ono Band. Because membership in the group featured quite a revolving door during its tenure, except for Paul and Linda.\n\nAnd Denny, of course.\n\nDenny Laine was there from Wings’ 1971 debut, the much maligned “Wild Life” album, and was a mainstay of the group through the very important stepping-stone “Red Rose Speedway” album and the triumphant “Band on the Run.”\n\n(I found it quite poignant that Denny passed away on the exact 50th anniversary of that album’s release in America.)\n\nIt’s worth noting that, for that landmark album, Wings had been reduced to a trio, as two other members of the earliest touring lineup (guitarist Henry McCullough and drummer Denny Seiwell) had flown the coop shortly before the recording sessions began.\n\nSo “Band on the Run” was just Paul, Linda and Denny.\n\nThere followed a brief (but relatively successful) stint with drummer Geoff Britton joining the band, along with whiz-kid guitarist Jimmy McCulloch. That version of Wings recorded the single “Junior’s Farm” and a few tracks for the album “Venus and Mars.”\n\nThen Britton left and drummer Joe English was brought in to join the McCartneys, Laine and McCulloch in what many consider the quintessential Wings lineup.\n\nPerforming a set list anchored by tracks from the two most recent albums and the brand-new “Wings at the Speed of Sound” LP, this is the ensemble that set the standard for mid-’70s arena rock.\n\nThe resulting triple-disc live album from the tour topped the Billboard charts, and gave birth to a live single of Paul’s early solo classic “Maybe I’m Amazed.”\n\nThe follow-up album, “London Town,” found Wings in transition once again, with McCulloch and English taking wing, a point emphasized by the cover photo, which showed only Paul, Linda and Denny.\n\nGuitarist Laurence Juber and drummer Steve Holley were recruited for what would be Wings’ final album, 1979’s “Back to the Egg.”\n\nWith 1980 bookended by a McCartney stint in a Japanese prison in January and the unspeakable event that would follow that December, the end was nigh for Wings.\n\nBut it was Denny Laine who was there for the band’s entire run, and he even appeared on McCartney’s first post-Wings release, the classic “Tug of War.”\n\nBeyond the albums cited above — and the 1972-73, 1975-76 and 1979 tours — the run of singles during this period is mindblowing: “My Love,” “Live and Let Die,” “Helen Wheels,” “Jet,” “Band on the Run,” “Junior’s Farm,” “Listen to What the Man Said,” “Silly Love Songs,” “Let ’Em In,” “With a Little Luck,” “Goodnight Tonight,” “Coming Up” …\n\nOh, and a little Scottish waltz, released smack in the middle of the punk and disco eras, called “Mull of Kintyre,” which went on to become the biggest-selling single ever in the U.K. at that time, besting one of McCartney’s efforts with his previous band.\n\nDenny co-wrote “Mull,” too.\n\nAlong the way, Denny also was on the 1974 “McGear” album released by McCartney’s brother Michael, and Laine’s own “Holly Days,” the latter featuring only three musicians …. Denny, Paul and Linda. (Both of the latter two releases are well worth seeking out.)\n\nIt was an honor and privilege to meet Denny at many concerts and Beatles fests through the years. Beyond his formidable vocal and instrumental talents, he remained gracious when meeting fans to talk about his career before, during and after his tenure with Wings.\n\nIt was quite gratifying that, even without Wings, Laine finally was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018 as an original member of the Moody Blues.\n\nOne of my favorite musical memories of Denny can be seen in the Wings concert movie “Rockshow,” filmed during the 1976 American tour. It’s when Denny revisits his days with the Moodies, taking the lead on “Go Now,” a song that had topped the U.K. charts in 1965.\n\nThe 1976 outing was where McCartney himself finally embraced the idea of doing Beatles songs in concert, so it was cool that the tour featured Denny out front doing his earliest hit, with Paul and Linda handling the background vocals, McCulloch playing a brilliant solo, and the horn section in top form.\n\nIt’s as good a document of Wings — as a true band — as one can find.\n\nPaul was right. Wings was “a shit-hot rock ’n’ roll band.”\n\nThanks, Denny.\n\nTom Frangione\n\nYou can find more about Denny Laine in Beatlefan #265.\n\nWe asked some of our Beatlefan staff members and regular contributors to share their thoughts on The Beatles’ “Now and Then.”\n\nIn 1996, nearly a year after the rollout of “The Beatles Anthology” project, which included the release of the three “Anthology” CD sets and the VHS expanded version of the original “Anthology” documentary, I wrote a piece for Beatlefan in which I noted how enjoyable the whole process, covering nearly a year, had been.\n\nI especially enjoyed the communal feeling of the broadcast of the first installment of the documentary and, at the episode’s end, the countdown to the debut of the first electronic Beatles “reunion” song, “Free As a Bird.”\n\nAnd, 28 years later, we had a similar shared moment at the beginning of November, with the debuts of a 12-minute documentary on the making of what was being billed as “the final Beatles song,” then the new recording itself, “Now and Then,” followed by the Peter Jackson-directed music video.\n\nHowever, those three days turned out to be not nearly as universally enjoyed as Thanksgiving week of 1995, and at least part of the problem can be attributed to 21st century social media.\n\nOh, sure, there was social media in 1995-96. There were AOL chat rooms and message boards and discussion forums. But Facebook and Google and Twitter still were a decade or more away, with Instagram and the dreaded TikTok even farther away. And the vast majority of the Beatle world was not yet involved with the early social media, so we could enjoy each segment of the project without feeling obligated to express an opinion on it, save for those of us in the print-dominated Beatles media.\n\nToday, it’s a whole new world, as a 1990s catch phrase put it — one in which peer pressure dictates that everyone immediately weigh in on any big event, even if one isn’t all that knowledgeable about said event.\n\nSo, within moments of the Nov. 2 debut of “Now and Then,” there was a torrent of instant reactions. That’s all well and good, but soon came the reactions from those who only knew this as the supposed “A.I. Beatles song” (thanks for putting that out there, Paul!), as well as musical know-it-alls providing oft overdone analysis.\n\nThis also was the first time for most millennials and all of Gen Z to experience the debut of a new Beatles record and, of course, they had to chime in with their reactions. Many of them were not pleased that “Now and Then” wasn’t an upbeat slice of Beatles pop, that it wasn’t an “Eight Days a Week” for the 21st century.\n\nIt seemed that the only group truly moved by “Now and Then” was Beatles fandom’s first generation, some 60 years on from our first listen to a record by the group.\n\nI think a bit of perspective is in order. As everyone reading this presumably knows by now, “Now and Then” started out as a John Lennon demo from his late ’70s househusband days at the Dakota. It was not one of his better ones, not nearly as good as “Free As a Bird” or “Real Love,” or most of the demos and unreleased recordings heard in the late ’80s on “The Lost Lennon Tapes.”\n\nBut it was one of the three songs on a cassette said to have been labeled “For Paul” (exactly who labeled it as such has been a subject of much speculation), and which Yoko Ono gave to Paul McCartney after he inducted Lennon into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994.\n\nThose demo recordings became the foundation of the 1994-95 Threetles sessions involving McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. But the “Now and Then” demo, with the TV playing in the background, was of lousy sound quality and after some brief time spent working on it, Harrison reportedly concluded they should abandon the number. (Whether that was just because of the poor sound quality, or also because he didn’t think much of the song, has been another subject of debate.)\n\nSo, the song was put aside and became the stuff of fan obsession, much like the ’60s unreleased track “Carnival of Light,” with people making their own recordings of what they thought a Beatles version of “Now and Then” would sound like.\n\nThen came the 2020s and Jackson’s revelatory work with his MAL technology (which is a machine-learning filtering process, not what most people mean by “A.I.”) on the “Get Back” docu-series.\n\nWith this new tool available, McCartney’s continuing interest in doing something with “Now and Then” came to the fore. And, with Giles Martin brought into the project, they were able to, um, take a sad song and make it better.\n\nGoing in, I was very apprehensive about this being “the final Beatles song,” because, basically, the number really is not up to The Beatles’ group standards.\n\nBut the work done somehow gave the final recording the majesty shared by so much of the group’s canon and Jeff Lynne’s production work on “Free As a Bird” and “Real Love.”\n\nTo me, this recording does indeed have the feel of a final bow.\n\nBack in the ’70s, a lot of us held out hope that The Beatles would get together for at least one big reunion show.\n\nMy own fantasy had the group doing one blowout concert, climaxed by a performance of the entire “Abbey Road” medley, from “You Never Give Me Your Money” through “The End.” The Beatles then would take the traditional Brian Epstein-suggested bow and that would be the climax for the group.\n\nNow, in an updating of my alternate-universe fantasy, The Beatles would return to the stage after the medley, perform “Now and Then,” take another final bow, and walk off together into history. …\n\nAl Sussman\n\nWaking up to a day highlighted by a new recording featuring a never-before-released Beatles song was something nobody imagined might happen again. And, from what the surviving members of the band tell us, now that it has happened, it never will again.\n\nWe’d been anticipating “Now and Then” for months, ever since Paul McCartney mentioned in a BCC Radio interview that The Beatles’ camp had used “artificial intelligence” to create a “new” tune using John Lennon’s voice.\n\nWhat Paul meant was that new technology — created and used by film director Peter Jackson’s team to isolate obscured audio in “The Beatles: Get Back” documentary and then also used by producer Giles Martin in the remixing of last year’s “Revolver” package — had been deployed to isolate and clean up Lennon’s vocal on an old demo.\n\nWhile many in the media and on social media went crazy misinforming anyone within clicking range of a hyperlink that “A.I.” had been used to create a “fake” Lennon vocal, most fans knew what Paul meant. And we also knew that he was talking about “Now and Then,” a Lennon track that he, George Harrison and Ringo Starr all had worked on during their “Anthology” sessions in the mid-1990s, but gave up on because the sound quality of Lennon’s cassette was so bad.\n\nLikely, many people who hear the new track wrongly will believe that the Lennon voice they hear is computer-generated, but we shouldn’t let that distract or prevent us from enjoying this new Beatles song, because it is enjoyable, as well as moving, tender, surprising, melodic and vital, and also because it is a Beatles song.\n\nAll four members of the band are heard on the tune: John’s vocal, George’s acoustic rhythm guitar, Ringo’s drums, and Paul on harmony vocals and a number of instruments, including, of course, bass, keyboards and a slide guitar solo that pays tribute to Harrison.\n\nThe tune opens with a count-in a la “I Saw Her Standing There” and a few other songs from The Beatles’ catalog. That’s followed by a stately, minor-key piano melody and Lennon’s voice, clear as day.\n\nHearing Lennon here is haunting, yet welcome, like the voice of a dear friend you thought you’d never hear from again, speaking to you anew. Everything else on the track, the new instrumental parts, backing vocals and strings (arranged by Martin) supports and pays tribute to that voice, as if to say, “We hear you, John. We’re listening to you. And we are here for you.”\n\nAs such, the song arrives as a comforting message of support to the listener, telling us that The Beatles’ music is still present and here for us, offering solace, wisdom, peace and respite from all of the madness at hand.\n\nThe band did this throughout their career, providing us with positive, affirmative messages that made us feel better about things, including ourselves, from “She Loves You,” “I Want to Hold Your Hand” and “The Word” on through “Here Comes the Sun” and “The End” on “Abbey Road,” which repeats “Love you, Love you” before landing on the prayer-like sentiment, “And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make.”\n\nLennon’s song acknowledges the obstacles to love and the need to overcome them and preserve what’s important and sacred, which is friendship and commitment to a relationship. It’s a message that we need to take to heart, now more than ever.\n\nOnly the most dark-hearted cynic would see this as a money grab or a last bid for more attention. It’s a gift, and one I receive with deep appreciation and gratitude. The world today is a sad song and The Beatles (yes, The Beatles) now have made it a little bit better.\n\nJohn Firehammer\n\nThe release of “Now and Then” was another one of those moments in Beatles history when the Fab Four’s music created a global listening party.\n\nLike the release of “Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band” in June 1967, the satellite broadcast of “All You Need Is Love” a few weeks later (reaching an estimated 400 million viewers in 25 countries), the much-anticipated debut of “Free as a Bird” in 1995, and 2021’s “Get Back” documentary series, the “last Beatles song” gave fans a shared experience.\n\nReleased in a world connected virtually, “Now and Then” allowed us to listen, react and shed tears together in real time. Coupled with the release of director Peter Jackson’s music video, the song carries an emotional impact worthy of The Beatles’ legacy.\n\nFor first-generation fans, the song and video unleashed a flood of memories. For Gen-X, millennials, Gen Z and beyond, “Now and Then” brought the thrill of witnessing the release of a new Beatles song.\n\nIt has given all of us the chance to hear John Lennon again, his voice lifted pure and clear from a tape made more than four decades ago, joined by his three bandmates in a collaboration that evokes love, regret and remembrance.\n\nIt is a fitting coda to the best-loved music catalog of our time, and a moving tribute to four friends who shook the world.\n\nKathy Urbanic\n\nLook for much more on “Now and Then” in Beatlefan #265 in December."
