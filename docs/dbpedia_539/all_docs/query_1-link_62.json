        "meta_description": "The detection of cancer micrometastasis for early diagnosis and treatment poses a great challenge for conventional imaging techniques. The aim of our study was to evaluate the performance of photoacoustic imaging (PAI) in detecting hepatic micrometastases from melanoma at a very early stage and in aiding tumor resection by intraoperative guidance. Methods: In vivo studies were performed by following protocols approved by the Ethical Committee for Animal Research at Xiamen University. First, a mouse model of B16 melanoma metastatic to the liver ( n = 10) was established to study the development of micrometastases in vivo. Next, the mice were imaged by a scalable PAI instrument, ultrasound, 9.4-T high-resolution MRI, PET/CT, and bioluminescence imaging. PAI scans acquired with optical wavelengths of 680–850 nm were kept spectrally unmixed by using a linear least-squares method to differentiate various components. Differences in signal-to-background ratios among different modalities were determined with the 2-tailed paired t test. The diagnostic results were assessed with histologic examination. Excised liver samples from patients diagnosed with hepatic cancer were also examined to identify the tumor boundaries. Surgical removal of metastatic melanoma was precisely guided in vivo by the portable PAI system. Results: PAI was able to detect metastases as small as approximately 400 μm at a depth of up to 7 mm in vivo—a size that is smaller than can be detected with ultrasound and MRI. The tumor-to-liver ratio for PAI at 8 d (4.2 ± 0.2, n = 6) and 14 d (9.2 ± 0.4, n = 5) was significantly higher than for PET/CT (1.8 ± 0.1, n = 5, and 4.5 ± 0.2, n = 5, respectively; P < 0.001 for both). Functional PAI revealed dynamic oxygen saturation changes during tumor growth. The limit of detection was approximately 219 cells/μL in vitro. We successfully performed intraoperative PAI-guided surgery in vivo using the portable PAI system. Conclusion: Our findings offer a rapid and effective complementary clinical imaging application to noninvasively detect micrometastases and guide intraoperative resection.",

        "text": "micrometastasis\n\nvisualization\n\nearly stage\n\nintraoperative navigation\n\nphotoacoustic imaging\n\nMelanoma is a malignant tumor of the skin that has shown a steady increase in incidence over the past few decades (1). Melanoma metastasis consists of a consecutive series of steps, including exfoliation from primary tumors, survival of tumor cells in the circulation, staying in new organs, exudation to surrounding tissues, and angiogenesis of metastatic tumors, which ultimately proliferate in a new environment (2,3). Malignant melanoma cells shed from the primary tumor often metastasize to the lymph nodes (4), liver (5), lungs (6), and brain (7). The liver is the most frequently involved organ by metastatic choroidal melanoma (8). Cutaneous melanoma metastasizes to the liver less frequently, but 15%–20% of metastatic melanoma still occurs in the liver (9). The survival rate for patients with melanoma metastatic to the liver has been reported to be low (10). Because of its aggressive progression and high metastasis risk, melanoma is associated with a poor prognosis, as well as high morbidity and mortality rates (11). Therefore, accurate diagnosis of micrometastasis to the liver at an early stage is critical to improve the prognosis and survival rate.\n\nMetastasis is usually detected clinically by imaging methods such as ultrasound, MRI, and PET/CT. Ultrasound imaging lacks sufficient contrast in soft tissue and cannot detect blood oxygenation, and MRI is not the primary choice for the liver because of its suboptimal sensitivity, long scanning time, and high operational costs. PET is useful for detecting cancer metastasis and monitoring therapeutic response, but 18F-FDG may yield false-positive results in patients with other symptoms and has a high examination fee (12). Therefore, the current clinical imaging modalities are not ideal for detecting small tumors and micrometastasis.\n\nPhotoacoustic imaging (PAI) is a noninvasive method that combines the high spatial resolution of ultrasound with the rich contrast of optical imaging (13). It allows high-precision imaging and characterization of molecules, cells, tissues, and organs (14) so that features can be extracted from PAI scans (15). PAI can provide endogenous contrast among different anatomic structures on account of intrinsic light absorbers such as hemoglobin (16), lipid (17), and melanin (18). Ex vivo PAI of melanin in the resected sentinel lymph nodes shows an excellent correlation with histologic melanoma cell infiltration (19). In addition, in vivo PAI can track unmarked circulating melanoma cells, can image functional connections between blood vessels and the whole brain (20), and can quantify the blood flow and oxygen metabolism of lesions (21). It combines the advantages of high resolution, high sensitivity, and deep penetration, enabling early diagnosis of hepatic micrometastasis.\n\nThe high recurrence rate after tumor resection is due to incomplete removal of the malignant mass, which results in residual cancer cells. Surgeons rely primarily on visual and tactile identification of cancerous tissue to distinguish it from benign tissue, a method that is often inaccurate. In the liver, PAI possesses optimal resolution and imaging depth that are far superior to the limited resolution and imaging depth of fluorescence imaging (22). As a label-free technique, PAI obviates the shortcomings of the widely used fluorescence imaging, which requires gene expression or injection of fluorescence probes (23,24). PAI offers excellent spatial and temporal resolution to accurately determine tumor margins and tissue structures (25) and is therefore a viable option for early-stage cancer detection. In addition, its portable setup and handheld probe save time and labor.\n\nResection is the basic method of treatment for tumors that are metastatic to the liver, and it offers the optimal long-term survival rate. A previous study combined MRI, PAI, and Raman imaging to guide intraoperative tumor resection by intravenous injection of nanoparticles (26). Ideally, a label-free noninvasive portable device is needed in the operating room. In particular, the device needs to be designed for easy intraoperative navigation and real-time imaging. The combination of high-resolution, fast, and portable PAI would enable accurate diagnosis and resection for micrometastatic tumors. Further development of such a device would imply future improvements in PAI-guided tumor surgery and in patient prognosis (27).\n\nHere, we conducted a comprehensive study to accurately detect tumor micrometastases in living animals and clinical tissue specimens without labeling by high-resolution PAI systems (Fig. 1). Our results showed that PAI technique is somewhat comparable to conventional imaging technologies such as MRI and PET, permitting clinical application for early diagnosis of tumors and guiding intraoperative resection.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nPAI as a new imaging method with high sensitivity and specificity can monitor microtumors (<1 mm) that cannot be detected by traditional imaging techniques, realizing the early diagnosis of tumors and helping doctors plan treatment as early as possible. Under precise detection conditions, PAI can be further developed to help guide tumor resection by reducing residues. Although this study focused on melanoma metastatic to the liver, we believe that this method can be extended to other tumors, such as glioma and breast cancer.\n\nDISCLOSURE\n\nThis work was supported by the National Science Foundation of China (81922034 and 91859113), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (20720170065), the Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars of Fujian Province (2018J06024), and the Science Foundation of Fujian Province (2014Y2004).
