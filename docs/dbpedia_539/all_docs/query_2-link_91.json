        "text": "From advents in automation to the realities of a distributed workforce, a new era of work has dawned—and with it, a new style of teamwork. This is part of a series exploring Deloitte’s Modern Teams methodology and the nonlinear, diverse, multifunctional teams that put humanity at the center to drive meaningful business outcomes.\n\nBy now, we’ve all heard this story countless times: COVID-19 hit in early 2020, the world shut down, and healthcare was suddenly forced to pivot dramatically. But no matter how many times we process that familiar narrative, the reality is that many of the most critical stories of the last two years are only beginning to be told—and, for many organizations, are still unfolding in real time.\n\nNowhere has that been truer than in the healthcare industry, as well as in the adjacent industries that support it. That includes AT&T and Moderna, two companies in decidedly different sectors that Covid managed to thrust into a very similar situation: Needing to innovate and adapt to help save lives. For these two organizations, Covid wasn’t just about inventory disruption or brick-and-mortar closures; rather, their deep involvement in healthcare meant their products and services would be critical to helping countless people around the world.\n\nBoth AT&T and Moderna set out to achieve extraordinary things. And to get extraordinary results, each company turned to a similar approach: The construction of multidisciplinary modern teams.\n\nAT&T: Expanding Healthcare Beyond Hospital Walls\n\nThese days, it’s easy to forget that remote healthcare was not a tangible or accessible option for most Americans just three years ago. Healthcare providers simply didn’t have enough infrastructure or consistent demand for large-scale support of digital-first, remote healthcare capabilities.\n\nCovid would, of course, forever shift that paradigm. Before the pandemic forced remote options, AT&T and Deloitte were working independently on digital-first care options to improve patients’ overall healthcare journeys and aiming to ensure equitable care for countless American households.\n\nThe battle for equitable care has been a long-standing and pervasive one. Roughly a third of all Americans live in “healthcare deserts,” or areas lacking adequate access to primary care providers, hospitals, and trauma centers. Worse yet, many of those same geographic areas also lack the digital infrastructure required to even consider remote care. This was already a glaring problem for American healthcare before Covid, but the pandemic’s brutal nature magnified the issue exponentially: Suddenly remote care was more necessary than ever, and the populations who needed it the most had the least opportunity to access it.\n\nSo once Covid hit, delivering digital-first care options morphed from “important” to “mission-critical.” Priority one was developing a wide range of tools and platforms designed to enable high-quality, remote digital care that could still reach deep into these healthcare deserts. Remote treatment relies on stable connectivity—and equitable care means connectivity for all.\n\n“Our perspective was that whatever solution we put into place, connectivity needs to be a part of it already,” says Zee Hussain, AT&T’s senior vice president for Enterprise Markets.\n\nSuch solutions would need to be responsibly rushed, especially for vulnerable and remote populations that struggle with healthcare access. This meant understanding potential solutions—and their impacts—from every angle.\n\nAT&T was providing connectivity for remote care solutions in hospitals and patients’ homes before the pandemic. Some of these solutions tapped into FirstNet®, the nationwide public safety broadband network built specifically for America’s first responders and the extended public safety community. But demand for remote care dramatically increased as a result of Covid. In response, AT&T leaned into its “360-degree relationship” with Deloitte, casting the net far and wide to capture a talented team consisting of subject matter specialists in every area needed to expand virtual care solutions.\n\n“This approach was our mechanism for bringing the right brains in the room to get that degree of collaboration,” says John Levis, principal with Deloitte Consulting LLP.\n\nZee Hussain\n\nSenior Vice President Global Business at AT&T\n\nThis work wasn’t meant to produce one specific solution—rather, it was a collaboration to generate a wide range of devices, services, platforms, and interfaces that enable remote care at every intersection point. The work has been both comprehensive and equitable—a direct result of how AT&T and Deloitte built the modern teams behind it.\n\n“We’ve seen more innovation in the last two years within healthcare than the two decades prior,” Hussain says. “It's all focused on the patient. I don't think there's any turning back.”\n\nModerna: Patient safety first, no matter what\n\nBy spring 2020, eyes around the world were watching Moderna’s every move as one of a handful of companies in the race to develop a Covid vaccine.\n\nBut along with the countless complexities of rapid vaccine creation and production, Moderna had to consider something that society at large treated as an afterthought: How to deploy an adverse event-monitoring platform to account for patients’ physical reactions, side effects, or hospitalizations—at a colossal scale, in a very short timeframe, and with advanced artificial intelligence and language translation capabilities to make the tool both efficient and broadly accessible. Establishing such an innovative solution would take time Moderna and the people depending on its vaccine did not have.\n\nModerna’s pharmacovigilance team considered their options. Deployment speed and scale were obviously critical, but nothing could become more important than Moderna’s perennial north star: Patient health and safety.\n\n“That’s your guiding light,” says Jane Carroll, vice president of pharmacovigilance operations at Moderna. “It helps guide all of your decision-making. Then you’re never going to make a decision, or go down a pathway, where you know you could have a risk for how we’re looking at safety data.” The conversation couldn’t focus on how to rush a solution to market. Rather, it would need to answer, “How do we meet our product and safety standards in a fraction of the time?”\n\nWith the help of Deloitte’s software engineering team’s experience and technology, Moderna set up an accessible, equitable, and comprehensive adverse event case management solution, ElevateSafetyTM, in just four months—a previously unthinkable achievement. The key, according to Carroll, was in how Moderna approached the tool’s development: Instead of a standard pharmaceutical approach of moving monolithically from one state of development to the next, Moderna attacked the issue in a highly agile way. Leveraging the ElevateSafetyTM platform developed by Deloitte’s software engineering team, Moderna was able to deploy the vast majority of the required capability in a fraction of the time.\n\nIn many ways, Moderna was primed for the moment: It has always prioritized finding talent with innovative, entrepreneurial, and resilient mindsets. That kind of thinking was the backbone of Moderna’s unprecedented Covid response.\n\n“The right talent and team is critical,” says Carroll. “It’s all about pivoting fearlessly. It’s about questioning convention. … Remember that you can think and act differently at this company than you ever have before.”\n\nJane Carroll\n\nVP of Pharmacovigilance Operations at Moderna\n\nIn many ways, the pandemic shined a light on what makes Moderna different than the rest of its industry—and the word is out. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Moderna has seen an influx of new team members looking for a change.\n\n“I think most of the people here at Moderna—doing these kinds of projects—are people who are fully committed to innovative approaches” says Suzanne Tracy, head of digital innovation in Moderna’s pharmacovigilance operations. “We just don’t want that as an impediment anymore. There’s something bigger, better out there that we know we can achieve—and we just do it.”\n\nIn these two organizations, teamwork spurred solutions that will have a global impact by improving health access, equity, and the patient experience. AT&T’s network and connectivity solutions, paired with Deloitte’s systems integration capabilities, are shaping a virtual healthcare future. Moderna’s collaboration with Deloitte established a first-of-its-kind automated case processing solution, driving innovation and transforming Pharmacovigilance Operations, while delivering on Moderna’s commitment to patient safety and enabling the highest standards of quality and compliance.\n\nOver the last two years, the world has learned just how fast things can change. What’s important is how these companies and their teams chose to respond in the face of the unknown. “I think what builds great teams is vulnerability,” says Carroll. “Vulnerability brings trust—real, authentic trust.”\n\nAnd when lives depend on the output of these teams, trust is everything. That’s what a team is all about.\n\nStruggling with complex modern problems?
