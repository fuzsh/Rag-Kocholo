        "text": "I am using Confluence Cloud and see the same thing. Bug report time.\n\nAs a workaround you can go to the Permissions tab and see which users have Admin permission. Not as quick, but works in a pinch.\n\nIt sounds like a problem with the permission setup for your Confluence Spaces. Being a \"site admin\" does not automatically give you any Space permissions in Confluence. You still need to have Admin permission assigned to you for a Space to see the Space Permissions.\n\nThe way our Confluence Cloud instance is set up is that any admins are members of the \"administrator\" Group and this Group has all permissions, including Admin assigned in all of the Spaces. Perhaps this has been changed for your instance or you are not a member of the Group used for this type of setup.\n\nokay update -\n\nyes, we agree that this looks like a bug (the screenshot i posted above)\n\nhowever,\n\nAtlassian got back to me today and gave me these instructions to assume an admin role over a space we didnt have admin role over, (but had site admin)\n\nYou, as a site-admin, can recover access to any Space in your instance by following the steps below:\n\nIn your Confluence landing page click on Settings on the left sidebar;\n\nScroll down until you find the Space Permissions option in the left menu and click on it;\n\nFind the space you need Admin permissions and click on Recover Permissions;\n\nAfter the page reloads click on Manage Permissions;\n\nClick on Edit Permissions;\n\nAdd yourself and any user needed to the necessary permissions;\n\nSave the changes\n\nso yes, we were able to assume the admin role of the space to modify membership , and to that end, the issue is resolved.\n\nWe'll see if Atlassian feels like fixing the fact that things show up blank.\n\ncheers!"
