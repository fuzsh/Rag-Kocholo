        "text": "COOS BAY, Ore. -- The Coos Bay School District is beginning the year with some shiny new toys.The Coos Bay Schools Community Foundation is rolling out a brand new grant program this year and nearly $23,000 will be poured into the school district thanks to the new Helfrich Family Awards.39 teachers and staff members will use the grants to support art, academic, and athletic programs, such as new wrestling gear and blocking sleds for the football team. \"Kids always feel better if they have good equipment,\" says Marshfield assistant football coach John Lemmons. \"The more tools you have the better you can teach the fundamentals and get kids motivated.\"Kevin Haan says he'll bring hands-on learning to his classroom with new lab equipment. \"Rather than just learning from diagrams and a textbook it's a lot more fun and engaging for students to actually physically dissect a sheep brain; look at the parts,\" said Haan, a Harding Learning Center social studies teacher.The money came from a successful 'Evening with Mark Helfrich' fundraiser. Helfrich is the University of Oregon head football coach and a Marshfield High School graduate. Organizers say Helfrich asked for the award to recognize the contributions and service of his parents, Mike and Linda Helfrich, who taught and coached at Coos Bay Schools."
