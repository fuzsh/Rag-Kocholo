It is to them that this book is affectionately dedicated . PREFACE Upon listening to my parents recall events and ad- ventures of their earlier days, I began to wonder if any of our family history was recorded for the benefit of generations yet to come. It soon became apparent that not only was there no written record, but also that word of mouth \"information\" about early ancestors from various family members was often vague and based upon conflicting stories and legends rather than facts. After many inquiries it became apparent that consid- erable information was scattered among the many members of our widespread family. Several years were spent in begging contemporary information from members of the clan and in researching the earlier ancestors. This small book is the result of that labor of love. Although this family his was decided to publish a at this time to insure a as a basis for additiona not the end of the proje research and do hope tha hesitate to send in new correct previous imperfe errors will probably be prevented discrepancies spelled names and places It proved difficult to d information in many case ents have been referenced tory is not complete, it 11 the information available gainst its loss and to serve 1 research. This book is ct. I shall continue my t family members will not information or to verify or ctions. Regretfully, some found. Utmost care has not that have arisen from mis- , and from conflicting data, ocument or verify individual s, although original docum- in several instances. To those who will not find their information in these pages, I can only say, \"I'm sorry\". I felt that everyone should have noted the vibrations of my request for information, but some failed to send it in. The time and expense incurred in compiling a family history for publication are nonrecoverable . My sincere wish is to assist individuals in future gen- erations, helping them to trace their ancestral lines. If this objective is fulfilled, then I will have been repaid for my efforts. It is my hope 11 that those future generations will carry on with the family research and add to the information pre- sented herein. Many thanks are extended to all the members of the clan, too numerous to name, who so generously pro- vided much valuable information and demonstrated interest and support for this project.

ORIGIN OF THE FAMILY NAME The Helferich family name appears in early German history and legend, and there are several theories regarding its origin. From earliest times the name seems to have been symbolically related to eleph- ants. Thomas Lyrer, an early chronicler, tells a story which may be historicly doubtful, although it is based upon verifiable elements. His Swabian Chronicle indicates that the Swabian family branch can be traced back to Roman antiquity. He states that the forefather of the Helferich family was a Roman citizen by the name of Valerianus, a captain in command of the Quint am Veteranam German i cam E I ephant i nam, the Fifth German Veteran Legion, whose standard bore an elephant. Under orders from the Roman Emperor he crossed the Limes, a fortified frontier road from the present city of Koblenz to Regensburg on the Danube. Valerianus converted to Christianity about 235 AD and built a castle at Geislingen. He named the castle Helfenstein and took the name of Helferich for his own, after the German derivation of elephant, on his standard. Ruins of this castle are still to be seen at the summit of Helfenstein mountain at Geislingen, near the city of Ulm. The counts and their families occupied the castle until 1575 when it was destroyed in a war. The coat-of -arms , showing an elephant, is still visible in several spots, carved into the stone walls of the castle. The Royal State Archive at Stuttgart, Germany, holds a copy of the History and Descr ipt ion of the Very Old Family of the Counts von Helfenstein from 860 to 1 6OI4 by the historian Gabelkover. This work tells of Graf Ludwig XIII Helferich von Helfenstein, a member of this long line of counts, who was Canon at Cologne in 1508 and on June 27, 1511 was received into the Archbishopric at Strasbourg. In 1514 he left the cloister and joined the King of France, along with other counts, in an attempt to subdue imperial domination of the nobles. For this he was outlawed by the emperor, but soon thereafter he re- turned and was taken back into favor by Emperor Maximilian I, and in 1520 he married the emperor's daughter Margaret. He soon became bailiff of the archducal government at Weinsberg. During t the peas and over a few lo assistan had been were tor Easter , year old ants , on even the countess sent to The peas Countess estate a Maximil i in view he Bauernkrieg or Peasant's War in 1525, ants took by storm the castle at Weinsberg ran defending Count Ludwig, his knights and yal citizens. The count had requested ce but it arrived too late, after the castle captured. Count Ludwig and the defenders tured and killed on the morning following 1525. Countess Margaret, carrying her two son Maximilian in her arms begged the peas- her knees, to spare the child. However, child was mistreated and wounded. The was mocked and robbed of her jewels and Heilbronn with her child on a dung wagon, ants were later defeated and punished. Margaret was given the proceeds from her nd she went to the Netherlands. Her son an received gifts from the Roman emperor, of his father's death. * • * // 1 '^ ...v ,-5. ,. .. r^ nC}^ 'i^^mm m tfy ^s^s„. • * • - • /It \"^\"^ ^3 ^^Ck^ ¥M:^^m:- , ■': '/■•-' q: • r^^^ y^^^ '^^^^y^^u^i^njy^^^^^ \" • ii ^u^^'^iS^^ m^^^^^^^^B : ■ 1' >^?5ipn^s^/i^-K^^ ■ k ^S&^^ ^S ^^}^^^^\\^T^^^^L^- i j^^Sv ^^^^J^^OO, A -^^^ffi^\\i! 1 ^^^^ %\\\\\\ y// df^ -//^-''tP- \\vl!lVt%*'^V >v^- ■ ■ - aaStt^'^m 'fiA^isl Nl \\ '^ i^M vsfr^^^^T /^ffl \\ |//\"'jjkTlJkA/z^lfcn|. ^yVyJ^^yi.. - S^K^^^^^^5^^^' ^^^mj&%Mm tWiwv ^w( ^^^N>3iv^^^ r ^ha' y/ ^viy/Av nt^^^jc^' / y^i/f i \\\\ .\\[Yjl _Li3f\\ viiK ^Ttj\"'^^'^^ R^ iMli^r m^SiM 1 w i.ii J '5&^J^?^^^/ Wk ^^^^^^/^^p ^^/ \\ V \\ - vdsiPr ~ ^^^~' Li^^^K^*- .-^^ l^^W^^^^^ ^y^-'^.M/^x \"^^^^^I^^' ^^^\"^Tt '^<:- ^ ^ p\\ .

Goethe and Wagner spoke of it; Richard Weitbrecht in his Deutsche Heldensa- gen or German Hero-saga mentions Helferich , youngest of three sons of Konig Viking, who worked with str- ange herbs. He became a healer or \"helper of the people\". (Helfen- to help) Another story relates how a count, Graf Eberhard Helferich, took part in the Crusades, during which he saw for the first time an elephant. He was so impressed by it that for his coat-of-arms he adopted the elephant standing on a mountain with three peaks which supposedly represent the three family castles at Spitzenberg, Sigmaringen and Geislingen. The predominance of the elephant in Helferich his- tory, legend, family gravestones and coat-of-arms, suggests a blood relationship between the various families; and the three mountain peaks in the coat- of-arms representing the three castles seem strong evidence of the close ties of the Swabian families.

However, it is believed by some that there is a close connection. The heraldic arms of the early families, described as a walking elephant on a green mountain with three peaks, on a shield of black and gold, are similar to those accepted all through later descendants, suggesting a connection. THE EUROPEAN HELFERICH FAMILY John HELFERICH, our earliest ancestor in the new world, was born and lived his early life as Johannes HELFFRICH. His ancestry has been traced to the 1600's in Germany and to the early 1700's in the Netherlands, as shown in the chart which follows. The Dutch branch of his ancestry con- sists of the WEIJERINK, RIGTER, HENDRIKS and the VAN DEN BERG families in the ancient heavily fortified principal city of Zwolle in the prov- ince of Overijssel. The German branch consists of the HELFFRICH, SCHEIDT and ZIMMER families of Mensfelden, which is a small farming village near Limburg; and of the MUELLER family from Holtzheim and Nieder- neisen, located in Rheinland-Pf alz , just across the border from Mensfelden in Hessen. The earliest known HELFFRICH ancestor was Henner HELFFRICH who probably was born about 1645 and died about 1701 in Mensfelden. He married before 167S but the name of his wife is unknown. Henner was a teacher in Mensfelden, and an entry in the Wiesbaden State Archives dated January 10, 1702, states that he was \"Juror of Mensfelden, died about one year ago\". Henner HELFFRICH had two children; Johannes Fritz who was born September 3, 1678 and died February 18, 1736; and Anna Elisabetha who was born June IE, 1681. Johannes Fritz HELFFRICH married, probably about 1705, Anna Maria Elisabetha SCHEIDT, a daughter of Philipp and Elisabetha Margaretha C ] SCHEIDT Their children, all born in Mensfelden, were: i.

Gorg married September 3, 1775 in Zwolle, Overijssel Province of the Netherlands, Johanna Catrina WEIJERINK, daughter of Dark and Janna CRIGTER) WEIJERINK. Gorg Philipp was listed as a tailor in Mensfelden and was mentioned as a corporal in the regiment of Oran je-Fr iesland , Second Battalion in the com- pany of Colonel C. Waslander. He was described as being 5 feet, 8 inches tall. Gorg obtained ecclesiastical attestation from Maastricht, Lim- burg Province, to Leeuwarden on January 19, 1784 and from Leeuwarden to Workum , Friesland on April 14, 1815.

He died February 1, 18B5 in Colchester, Essex County, Ontario, Canada. He was the oldest of four sons of Georg HELFFRICH of Mensfelden, Germany, and Johanna Catrina WEIJERINK of Zwolle. John spent his early years in Zwolle, an important city at that time. He was under the constant guidance of private tutors and acquired an excell- ent education. He spoke German, French, Dutch and English fluently, and could converse in other languages . In March of 1793, John volunteered in the Nether- lands military service at the age of 17 years, and participated in the Napoleonic Wars. His first campaign, under the command of the Stadholder, was with the Duke of York in the province of Brabant, in 1794. When the French invaded the Netherlands, he went with the Stadholder's forces into Hanover. In June of 1799 John migrated to England and entered the British service in the regiment of the Earl of Bentink. In the following year he was drafted into the Corps of the Prince of Orange in the Isle of Wight, and in 1802 was discharged and sent home to the Netherlands at the cessation of hostilities. It was during this tour of duty that he met and married his first wife, Ann MOORE, said to have been the niece of General Sir John MOORE. They married in London during the spring of 1800. Ann was born about 178E. At the resumption of hostilities in 1803 John again went to England, with his new family, and re-entered the service in the King's German Legion, Second Light Infantry Battalion, under the command of Colonel Colin Halkett, where he served until discharged in 1814. During this 14 enlistment he participated in several expeditions including Hanover in 1805, Ireland in 1806, Cop- enhagen in 1807, Sweden 1808 and finally Portugal where his unit participated in the Peninsular Viar under Wellington's command. From there he went into Spain and France as Napoleon's army was driven back across the Pyrenees. It was probably during John's military expedition to Ireland in 180S that he sailed, with family, from Newport, Isle of Wight, to Ireland aboard his ship Ranger. Two of John and Ann's children were born on the Irish Sea, It has been said that while on the Isle of Wight, John's family was intimate with the Duke of Cambridge. After John's discharge in 1814 he returned to the Netherlands with his family and in 1818 they were in the city of Workum where they joined the Ref- ormed Christian Church. In 1822 the family migrated to Canada and in that year John again entered the British service as Lance-Sergeant-Tailor in Lt. Col. Surer ' s 37th Regiment in Quebec, where he served until 1824 when he was discharged for reasons of health and given a pension of sixpence per day. He was stationed at the Quebec Garrison during this per- iod of service, and it was at this time that his wife Ann died, March 28, 1823. On August 12 of that year, John and Elizabeth CBRANDEL) LASARIN were joined in marriage by the chaplain of the Quebec Garrison. Elizabeth was probably born about 1792 in Baden, Germany, and is believed to have died before 1861 in Colches- ter, Ontario, Canada. She was reputed to have been an excellently educated lady. The family moved to Colchester, Essex County, Ontario (known at that time as Western District of Upper Canada), between August of 1826 and May of 1827. In recognition of his military service John was granted a 200 acre lot of land in Col- chester in 1831. He built a log house thereupon 15 and attempted to Farm the land for three years but the extremely wet condition and poor drainage forced him to apply for more suitable land to sup- port his family, which consisted of eight at that time . Several petitions were submitted to the council, as well as to the governor, over a period of four years or more, with the strong support and backing of his neighbors. In 1851 John and family resided in a single story log house on 200 acres of land, Lot 10 of Range G, Colchester Township, 180 acres of which were in woods or forest and 20 acres were cultivated.

John v/as in Detroit in 1831 and for a period of three years he alternated his residence between that city and Sandwich, Ontario, just across the Detroit River and a bit south of Detroit.

He and Margaret joined the Wesleyan Methodist Church in Harrow about 1863 and attended services regularly. Margaret had grown up in the faith of the Scottish Presbyterian Church until her marriage. 25 Essex County abstract records show that John HELFERICH and wife sold to George HELFERICH the west Vz of lot 14, 100 acres, in the gore or second range, Colchester South. The 1861 Colchester census lists George and family residing in a V/2 story log house. The 1866 Gazeteer of Harrow district lists George as living on lot 14 of the gore between the first and second concession, and located just east of Harrow on the south side of highway 18. On September 5, 1881 a deed trans- ferred their 100 acre farm to Richard McLain for $4500. Some old Methodist Church records contain a note that on May 19, 1883, it was necessary to replace George HELFERICH as a parsonage trustee on the quarterly board, since he moved away from the area. It was at this time that George and Margaret moved to Michigan and bought a farm one mile south of Disco, a village about five miles north of Utica. On relocating to Michigan, they transferred to the Methodist Church and on May 3, 1890 George filed his intention of naturalization. They moved to Metamora, Michigan about 1900 where they remained about a year until buying a home in Washington Village where they resided until the death of George due to apoplexy. Margaret there- after resided most of the time with their daughter Mary (HELFERICH) CUNDY in Washington, Michigan, and also with their son James for a short period. Margaret has been described as having red hair, being a strict disciplinarian, careful about not having a Scottish brogue, using correct english and instilling it in her family, making her child- ren work hard for their keep, and having the abil- ity of ripping off all twelve names of her child- ren in one breath.
