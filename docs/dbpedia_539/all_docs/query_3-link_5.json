All three films center around a pair of police detectives, Hong Kong Chief Inspector Lee (Chan) and Los Angeles Police Detective James Carter (Tucker), who go on their series of misadventures involving corrupt crime figures in Hong Kong and Los Angeles. The films incorporate elements of martial arts, humor involving fish out of water situations and East-West culture shock, and the buddy cop subgenre. The films were released theatrically from 1998 to 2007, attaining commercial success, but critical reception was mixed.\n\nFilms\n\n[edit]\n\nRush Hour\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Rush Hour (1998 film)\n\nRush Hour was released on September 18, 1998, grossing $245,300,000 worldwide.[2] Martin Lawrence was originally considered for the role of James Carter.[3] Chris Tucker was finally chosen for the part. Director Brett Ratner, a big fan of Jackie Chan's Hong Kong movies, felt that American audiences would not be familiar with the jokes in Jackie's other movies, and deliberately re-used some of his gags. For example, the scene where Inspector Lee accidentally grabs Detective Johnson's (Elizabeth Peña) breasts is a reference to Jackie Chan's film Mr. Nice Guy (1997).[citation needed] Rush Hour began as a spec script written in 1995 by screenwriter/novelist Ross LaManna. The screenplay was sold by LaManna's William Morris agent Alan Gasmer to Hollywood Pictures, a division of the Walt Disney Company, with Arthur Sarkissian attached as producer. After attaching director Ratner and developing the project for more than a year with producers including Sarkissian and Roger Birnbaum, Disney Studios Chief Joe Roth put the project into turnaround, citing concerns about the $34-million budget, and Chan's appeal to American audiences at the time. Several studios were interested in acquiring the project. New Line Cinema was confident in Ratner's talents, having done Money Talks with him, so they made a hard commitment to a budget and start date for the film.[3]\n\nRush Hour 2\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Rush Hour 2\n\nRush Hour 2 was released on August 3, 2001 and grossed $347,425,832 worldwide,[4] making it the most financially successful film in the series. The film received mixed reviews compared with the first film. Other than Chan and Tucker, no cast members return to reprise their roles from the first film. John Lone, Zhang Ziyi, and Roselyn Sánchez join the cast while actors Don Cheadle, Saul Rubinek, Gianni Russo, and Jeremy Piven have guest or cameo appearances. The first two Rush Hour films both begin in Hong Kong and end in a United States airport.\n\nRush Hour 3\n\n[edit]\n\nMain article: Rush Hour 3\n\nRush Hour 3 was officially announced on May 7, 2006, and filming began on July 4, 2006. The film, set in Paris and Los Angeles, was first released on August 10, 2007, and grossed $256,585,882 worldwide.[5] Academy Award-winning film director Roman Polanski co-stars as a French police official involved in Lee and Carter's (Chan and Tucker's characters) case. Tzi Ma reprises his role as Ambassador Han, Lee's boss and friend who appeared in the first installment. This film has received an M rating by the Office of Film and Literature Classification (Australia) and a PG-13 rating by the MPAA for \"sequences of action violence, sexual content, nudity and language\". Additionally, the film was not screened in Chinese theaters in 2007 to make way for a larger variety of foreign films, according to a business representative (The quota for imported films is 20 each year).[6]\n\nFuture\n\n[edit]\n\nBecause of the films' collective box-office success, director Brett Ratner and writer Jeff Nathanson are considering the production of a fourth installment. In the DVD audio commentary for Rush Hour 3, Brett Ratner joked that the fourth Rush Hour film could be released in 2012. Ratner and Nathanson are exploring many concepts, including the use of the motion capture technique for the possible sequel and various different film projects with Chan and Tucker. It has been reported that the fourth film may be set in Moscow.[7]\n\nIn July 2009, in an interview, Ratner stated that he \"has been in contact with a long list of stars including Danny DeVito and Jet Li for possible roles in a potential Rush Hour 4\", but stressed \"nothing's been okayed yet\". In a short interview with Vulture in 2011, Ratner stated that the cost of making a follow-up to X-Men: The Last Stand would have cost more than X-Men: First Class and \"that's why another Rush Hour 4 probably won't get made, either: It'd be too much to pay me, Chris [Tucker], and Jackie [Chan] to come back.\"[8]\n\nIn August 2011, in an interview with The Breakfast Club, Tucker stated in response to the question of a fourth by saying, \"Rush Hour 4? Maybe you know, because that's a different kind of movie. You got the action and the stuff like that, and they pay 20 million dollars too... I'm just joking! No, you know Jackie Chan, you know I love working with him and those type of movies you can redo them and it's different, we'll see but I don't know though. But we've got some new stuff coming, so we'll see what happens.\"[9]\n\nIn July 2012, series producer Arthur M. Sarkissian stated that a fourth film was being worked on with Chan and Tucker, and stated that he would welcome Brett Ratner back as a director if he would \"do it in the right way.\" Sarkissian expressed some dissatisfaction with the third film, and admitted he wants the potential fourth film to be grittier, and have new ideas. Sarkissian is reportedly working on choosing which out of \"four or five\" screenwriters he has been talking to, should work on the script.[10]\n\nIn August 2014, Chan stated that the studio still wants to make Rush Hour 4, but that he will only participate if he can see a quality script first, stating \"I don’t want to do a rubbish script just because they want to make the movie\".[11] Both Chan and Tucker met for dinner to discuss Rush Hour 4 in June 2015.[12]\n\nIn November 2016, while promoting Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk, Tucker reaffirmed his optimism for a potential fourth film, stating “Yeah, we’re talking about it now doing another one, and we’re trying to get it going. I think we might be able to get one going. I love working with Jackie and I think we could do a really fun one.” In April 2017, it was reported that Indian actor Shah Rukh Khan had said yes to join the Rush Hour 4 cast.[13] By October 2017, Chan said that the script for Rush Hour 4 has been in the works and shooting for the film will most likely start in 2018 if Tucker agrees to be in the film. He stated that he was optimistic about Tucker accepting due to his previous claims of being on board for the film.[14]\n\nIn February 2018, Tucker confirmed the production of Rush Hour 4. He stated on ESPN's podcast, The Plug: \"It's happening. This is gonna be the rush of all rushes. Jackie is ready and we want to do this so that people don't ever forget it.\"[15] In February 2019, Tucker reported that the script is coming together, stating: \"We're working on a few things on the script right now, so we’re trying to get into production. But we’re working on it and trying to get it going.\"[16] He reiterated this in a podcast appearance in April that the fourth film was still a possibility, but that \"it's not in pre-production. We're working on a few things [for] the script. Jackie wants to do it. I want to do it. The studio wants to do it.\"[17] By 2018, in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations against Ratner by several actresses, Warner Bros. sources presumed that it's highly unlikely that Ratner will be directing Rush Hour 4.[18]\n\nIn March 2019, That Hashtag Show reported that a female led Rush Hour reboot was in development by STXfilms with Li Bingbing in the lead.[19]\n\nIn December 2022, the fourth film was confirmed to be in development by Chan.[20]\n\nTV series\n\n[edit]\n\nA TV series based on the premise of the film series aired from March to August 2016, with Jon Foo as Chief Inspector Lee and Justin Hires as James Carter. The films' original director Brett Ratner signed on as the show's executive producer, along with Rush Hour producers Arthur M. Sarkissian, Jeff Ingold, and Jon Turteltaub.[21] Turtletaub also directed the pilot episode with Bill Lawrence penning the series alongside Blake McCormick.[22] James Lew, who worked on the stunts for all 3 films, was a stunt coordinator for the series.[23] It was announced that Jon Foo and Justin Hires would star as Detectives Lee and Carter for the CBS series, along with Aimee Garcia and Jessika Van in regular roles.[24][25][26] The series was cancelled after one season.\n\nCharacters\n\n[edit]\n\nCharacter Films Television series Rush Hour Rush Hour 2 Rush Hour 3 Rush Hour 1998 2001 2007 2016 Chief Inspector Lee Jackie Chan Jon Foo Detective James Carter Chris Tucker Justin Hires Consul / Ambassador Solon Han Tzi Ma Tzi Ma Soo Yung Han Julia Hsu Zhang Jingchu Thomas Griffin\n\nJuntao Tom Wilkinson Henry Ian Cusick[a] Detective Tania Johnson Elizabeth Peña Sang Ken Leung FBI Agent Warren Russ Mark Rolston FBI Agent Dan Whitney Rex Linn Captain William Diel Philip Baker Hall Philip Baker Hall Philip Baker Hall Ricky Tan John Lone Isabella Molina Roselyn Sánchez Roselyn Sánchez Hu Li Zhang Ziyi Steven Reign Alan King Kenji Hiroyuki Sanada Geneviève Noémie Lenoir George Yvan Attal Jasmine\n\nThe Dragon Lady Youki Kudoh Varden Reynard Max von Sydow Sergeant Didi Diaz Aimee Garcia Captain Lindsay Cole Wendie Malick Gerald Page Kennedy Kim Lee Jessika Van Donovan Kirk Fox\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nBox office performance\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm Release date Box office gross Box office ranking Budget References North America Other territories Worldwide All time North America All time worldwide Rush Hour September 18, 1998 $141,186,864 $103,200,000 $244,386,864 #312 #455 $35 million [2] Rush Hour 2 August 3, 2001 $226,164,286 $121,261,546 $347,425,832 #114\n\n#165(A) #270 $90 million [4][27] Rush Hour 3 August 10, 2007 $140,125,968 $117,896,265 $258,022,233 #315 #422 $140 million [5] Total $507,477,118 $342,357,811 $849,834,929 $265 million [1] List indicator(s)\n\n(A) indicates the adjusted totals based on current ticket prices.\n\nCritical and public response\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm Rotten Tomatoes Metacritic CinemaScore[28] Rush Hour 62% (77 reviews)[29] 60 (23 reviews)[30] A Rush Hour 2 51% (128 reviews)[31] 48 (28 reviews)[32] A Rush Hour 3 17% (158 reviews)[33] 44 (32 reviews)[34] A-\n\nSoundtracks\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Chart positions Certifications\n\n(sales thresholds) U.S. U.S. R&B 1998 Rush Hour\n\nReleased: September 15, 1998\n\nLabel: Def Jam\n\n5 2\n\nUS: Platinum\n\n2001 Rush Hour 2\n\nReleased: July 31, 2001\n\nLabel: Def Jam\n\n11 11\n\nUS: Gold\n\n2007 Rush Hour 3\n\nReleased: August 8, 2007\n\nLabel: Def Jam\n\n— — List indicator(s)\n\nA dark grey cell indicates the information is not available for the film.\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
