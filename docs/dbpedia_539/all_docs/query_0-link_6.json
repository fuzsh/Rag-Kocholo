        "text": "VIDA — Last August, when Kelsey Helfrich married a fellow river guide at Eagle Rock Lodge, the scene was more than a wedding. Based on the wishes of the 28-year-old bride, it was a tribute to the tumbling, twisting thread of water that has drawn together a family that Kelsey and her cousins are now the fifth generations to dip its oars in the McKenzie, which drains a forested watershed rising to the 10,358-foot South Sister.\n\nIt was a tribute to the wooden drift boat, which has been a Helfrich hallmark since Prince and boat designer/builder Veltie the “Preacher”\n\nPruitt — a Eugene Bible School grad — became the first to run a handful of rugged Northwest rivers, including, in 1931, the upper Rogue. But, mostly, it was a tribute to a family — her family — on the cusp of celebrating its 100th anniversary of living, working, and playing on the McKenzie. The lead boat in her whitewater processional belonged to her great-grandfather, Prince Helfrich, who, at 25, guided President Herbert Hoover down the river in 1932. For this two-mile float to the altar, the boat was adeptly rowed by Prince’s now-81-year-old son, Dave, “by far the best boatman I know,” Kelsey says of her grandfather.\n\nMake no mistake; as attested by the wedding reception electric guitars that wailed on that summer night, this wasn’t 1914 anymore, the year Ben Helfrich settled his family along the river. But it was a reminder that if the riffles of time inevitably carve changes as they tumble forward, the deeper things endure.\n\nSetting the standard: Family, wooden boats, and, of course, the river\n\n“The Helfrich Family is so woven into the fabric and the culture of the McKenzie River, it’s hard to think of one and not think of the other,” says Greg Hatten, who runs Wooden Boat Adventures guide service and has won the McKenzie Two Fly fishing tournament. “They not only pioneered guiding on the river, but they also set the standard for how to treat guests and how to create authentic outdoor experiences in our classic wooden drift boats. We all look up to them.”\n\nThe Helfriches are to the McKenzie Valley what the Cartwright Family of “Bonanza” fame were to The Ponderosa: a multigenerational collection of testosterone — and Kelsey — that handles boats with the skill in which Hoss and Little Joe handled horses.\n\nCounting spouses, children, and in-laws, the Helfrich family now exceeds 50 people, of whom 14 are licensed river guides in Oregon and most also in Idaho. Five Helfrich families still live along the Mc­Kenzie River.\n\nKelsey is not only the family’s first female guide but the first female drift boat guide on the Rogue River and on the Middle Fork of Idaho’s Salmon River.\n\nSays Kelsey: “Anytime I get in a situation and feel nervous — some rapid with big technical challenges — I just think: Prince ran this, my grandfather (Dave) ran this, my dad (Ken) ran this.“People tell me my boating style is similar to Prince’s. He wasn’t a big guy, and he relied on finesse. His skill was in the way he read the waters, the way he knew exactly what he needed to do to make the boat go where it needed to go.”\n\nSome enchanted river\n\nIt was love at first sight. Not for Kelsey and her new husband, Kidd Youren — well, OK, maybe for Kidd — but for Ben Helfrich and the McKenzie River. He fell for the river in the spring of 1914.\n\nHaving recently moved his family from Prineville to McArthur, Calif., to raise wheat, Ben was visiting friends in Springfield when he was invited to the Mc­Kenzie home of the Rusts, between Vida and Blue River.\n\nBen Helfrich was so enchanted with the Mc­Kenzie that, within days, he’d bought 160 acres of land for $5,000 and soon moved his family from California. Today, you’ll recognize the Highway 126 portion of that land as the stretch near the old Mom’s Pies and Heaven’s Gate; Ben built those birdhouse-like cabins perched between the highway and the river.\n\nHe called it Halfway Camp."
