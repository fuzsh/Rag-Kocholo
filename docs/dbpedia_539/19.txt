A jangly rock momentum stirs on “1997,” a spirited and hook-filled success from Humdrum Book Club, a band based in Venice, California. Led by songwriter Andrew Ross and producer John Helfrich, the project spent the past couple years “writing songs and building an all-analog studio,” and now these singles are being released — with “1997” showcasing their infectious rock and pop intertwining.

Nostalgia is certainly embraced in the title and tonal pursuits, melding jangling guitar bursts and steady vocal momentum for a sound with shades of Teenage Fanclub. Power-pop, alt-rock, and touches of psychedelia collide beautifully here, complementing a thematic focus the act describes as “a whimsical exploration of extraterrestrial life through the lens of the songwriter’s younger self.” The blaring, ardent chorus is especially replay-tempting. Also be sure to check out its music video (above) — filmed on VHS in desert caves.
