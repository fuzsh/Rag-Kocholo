Oracle has announced that it has acquired Moniforce, a leading software vendor for monitoring the availability and performance of any web application. With customers spanning key industries including financial, retail and government, Moniforce’s technology is expected to strengthen Oracle’s Enterprise Manager Application Performance Management capabilities that allow application administrators to proactively detect and resolve end-user experience and application logic issues.

The transaction underscores Oracle’s strategy of lowering total cost of ownership and delivering higher quality of service for

customers running packaged or custom applications in Oracle or non-Oracle environments,said Chuck Rozwat, executive vice

president, Oracle Product Development. The addition of Moniforce significantly broadens the scope of business exceptions addressed by Oracle Enterprise Manager, allowing administrators to proactively monitor and analyze the application experience from a user’s standpoint. Such analysis can dramatically improve business outcomes and create compelling cost-saving synergies with end-to-end application performance monitoring and diagnostics encompassing the end-user, application, middleware, database and the underlying infrastructure.
