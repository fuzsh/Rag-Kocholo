And change can confound our efforts to find something that we know used to exist and very well might still exist in some form. The primary purpose of this page is to track changes in the vendors of software test tools, software test training courses, and software testing services, and also the tools and courses themselves, to help you find a resource that you're having trouble locating or at least have the peace of mind that it really no longer exists. The type of changes tracked include:\n\nA tool or course changes name\n\nA tool or course is transferred to a new vendor\n\nA tool or course is dropped from the market\n\nA vendor changes name\n\nA vendor is acquired or merged\n\nA vendor goes out of business or exits the software test market\n\nThe information on this page is in alphabetical order by vendor. To find a tool or service, search the entire page. Tool and course information is listed under the vendor as it existed when the change occurred. Keep in mind that the appearance of a vendor on this page does not imply that the vendor is no longer a thriving business, unless the information given here says otherwise. As explained above, there are many types of changes that merit an entry here, including simple name changes. Keep in mind that you may need to trace a company through several acquisitions and other changes before you find its current state. Each entry here is a link in what might be a long chain.\n\nFor some background information about this page, see the article \"Populating the Boneyard\" and the Gray Matters podcast where I discuss the Boneyard.\n\nThe information on this page is based mainly on the change log that has been maintained for testingfaqs.org for the last several years. This is not a comprehensive list of changes in the software test industry, though I'd like to hear any additional information that you may have.
