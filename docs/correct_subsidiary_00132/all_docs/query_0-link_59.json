        "text": "Columnist’s corner: As this year starts winding down, the time is upon us to look at what matters most in tech, particularly the megatrends holding potential to affect your job or career. Morgan Stanley does just that in an annual report. “It’s provocative, but we’ll take it with a grain of salt,” David Margulius writes in this week’s Enterprise Insight. U.S. IT spending as a percentage of corporate capital expenditures is back up to 50 percent and climbing, Margulius reports, though most of the action is taking place outside The States. “There are new growth opportunities everywhere you turn.”\n\nSustainable IT: We’re seeing more and more companies hop on the green IT bus, the latest being Cisco, with its CUD, as in Connected Urban Development. CUD, part of the William J. Clinton Foundation’s Global Initiative, is designed to apply technology to challenges facing cities in regards to climate change. “Cisco is clearly serious about the projects, because it’s committed $15 million to CUD and enlisted the brainpower of engineers from MIT,” Ted Samson reports in Cisco seeds green innovations aimed at climate change. But Cisco isn’t investing in CUD entirely for altruistic reasons. “These projects give the company an opportunity to showcase its technology and, the company explains, “build a much better relationship with cities and local government, and to open new markets.” For which, Samson adds, “I certainly don’t begrudge Cisco.”"
