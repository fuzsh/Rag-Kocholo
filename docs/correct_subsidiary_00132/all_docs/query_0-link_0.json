With customers spanning key industries including financial, retail and government, Moniforce's technology is expected to strengthen Oracle's Enterprise Manager Application Performance Management capabilities that allow application administrators to proactively detect and resolve end-user experience and application logic issues.\n\n\"The transaction underscores Oracle's strategy of lowering total cost of ownership and delivering higher quality of service for customers running packaged or custom applications in Oracle or non- Oracle environments,\" said Chuck Rozwat, executive vice president, Oracle Product Development. \"The addition of Moniforce significantly broadens the scope of business exceptions addressed by Oracle Enterprise Manager, allowing administrators to proactively monitor and analyze the application experience from a user's standpoint. Such analysis can dramatically improve business outcomes and create compelling cost-saving synergies with end- to-end application performance monitoring and diagnostics encompassing the end-user, application, middleware, database and the underlying infrastructure.\"\n\n\"Moniforce and Oracle believe that real end-user information is essential for improving application usage and business performance, as well as lowering total cost of ownership; a vision that reflects the growing needs of the industry,\" said Willem-Jan Scholten, CEO Moniforce. \"We're proud to become part of the world's largest enterprise software company and look forward to delivering solutions that maximize our customers' return on their application investments by ensuring the highest end-user satisfaction.\"\n\nFinancial details of the transaction were not disclosed.
