CitraTest Tevron LLC Automated software testing solution for all Citrix Environments eggPlant TestPlanteggPlant is a black-box GUI test automation tool, originally developed by Redstone Software starting in 2002. Redstone was acquired in 2008 by a UK-based company called Testplant. Despite the change in name, Eggplant's development continues unabated. It has a unique approach in that it does not reside on the system, and uses image matching technology as opposed to looking to the object-level of the application being tested. This allows for system-wide automation of a system-under-test as opposed to an application-specific solution. It also means that the technology used to build the application to be tested does not matter, nor does the system that the application runs on.
