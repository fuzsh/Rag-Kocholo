        "text": "A mortgage rescue – for some: The Bush administration today unveiled a plan negotiated with the nation’s mortgage industry leaders that is designed to help homeowners who fear they will default if interest payments on their loans ratchet higher.\n\nA White House spokesman was careful to say it is not a bailout, because the government is not putting up any money. He also rebutted critics who call it a federal intrusion in private industry, saying it’s up to mortgage players to decide whether to participate.\n\nThe spokesman also claimed the plan will “potentially help a little more than a million” people who can afford to pay their adjustable-rate loans only if the interest rate remains unchanged. Specifically, the plan will help homeowners who would be delinquent if their loans reset in a 2 1/2-year period that starts in 2008.\n\nBut that leaves many other homeowners out in the cold, writes real estate reporter Sue McAllister in Square Feet, our real estate blog.\n\n“Those already in default or facing foreclosure: Sorry, this plan is not for you, so you better hope your lender’s workout department is already doing what it can, if your loan can be saved,” she writes.\n\nHow to find the needle in the haystack: Seagate Technology, the No. 1 player in the cutthroat hard-disk drive business, said today that it will beef up its services division by acquiring a company that makes “e-discovery” software that helps corporations, attorneys and prosecutors sift through e-mails and other records more efficiently.\n\nSeagate will pay an undisclosed amount for MetaLincs, a San Jose company with about 50 employees. This is Seagate’s third acquisition since 2005 of companies that help clients back up and manage their data, including purchases of EVault and Action Front.\n\nAMT “patch” hits roadblock again: The Senate rejected a plan to approve a one-year “patch” to save millions of Americans – including countless Silicon Valley residents – from owing the alternative minimum tax next April 15. The bill is logjammed, with Democrats pushing for tax increases to offset the lost revenues under the House’s pay-as-you-go doctrine, while Republicans are vowing not to “raise taxes.”\n\nMeanwhile, confusion mounts. Taxpayers can only guess what rules will apply to their 2007 tax return as they tie up their year-end planning. The Internal Revenue Service deadline for sending instruction booklets and forms to the printer has passed, and the agency is warning that it probably would have to delay processing returns if the patch were approved because it needs weeks to update its software.\n\nBut too late for the holidays: Dell announced it will start selling its computers through Best Buy, another big step away from its heritage of selling PCs directly to consumers. Its XPS and Inspiron notebook and desktop computers won’t start showing up in Best Buy’s 900 stores until January, however – news that some see as a sign that the negotiations with Best Buy were tough.\n\nStill, if you’re dead set on a Dell gift this holiday season, you can head to Wal-mart, Staples, Bic Camera in Japan, Gome stores in China, and Carrefour and Carphone Warehouse in Europe.\n\nAnother morsel for Oracle: Oracle said today it has closed its June purchase of Moniforce, a Netherlands company that develops software that helps companies figure out what’s wrong when their Web sites start frustrating users. Oracle did not disclose financial terms.\n\nSilicon Valley tech stocks:\n\nUp: Finisar, Borland Software, Palm, Intel and McAfee.\n\nDown: Verifone was the biggest loser today, tumbling another 13 percent in the wake of its accounting mess.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index: Up 42.67 points, or 1.6 percent, to 2,709.30.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average: Up 174.93 points, or 1.3 percent, to 13,619.89."
