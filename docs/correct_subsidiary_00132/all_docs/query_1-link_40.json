        "text": "1. Technical Support Policies Effective Date: 2-MAY-2008 OVERVIEW Unless otherwise stated, these Technical Support Policies apply to technical support for all Oracle product lines. These Technical Support Policies may be referred to in former PeopleSoft agreements as the “Software Support Services Terms and Conditions”, in former Siebel agreements as the “Maintenance Services Policy”, in former Hyperion agreements as the “Standard Maintenance Program”, and in former Agile agreements as the “product support policy”. \"You\" and \"your\" refers to the individual or entity that has ordered technical support from Oracle or an authorized distributor. To receive technical support as provided by Oracle Support Services (“OSS”) and described in the Oracle Technical Support Levels section below, all programs must be properly licensed. Technical support is provided for issues (including problems created by you) that are demonstrable in the currently supported release(s) of an Oracle licensed program, running unaltered, and on an appropriate hardware, database and operating system configuration, as specified in your order or program documentation. Product release and supported platforms information for all Oracle programs other than Cimmetry AutoVue and Vuelink programs (“Cimmetry programs”), Interlace Systems programs, Crystal Ball programs, Moniforce programs and Captovation programs is available through Oracle’s web-based customer support systems as described in the Web-Based Customer Support Systems section below. Product release and supported platforms information for Cimmetry programs is available in the AutoVue Administration Guide that is included with the Cimmetry program documentation. Product release and supported platforms information for Captovation programs is available on http://captovation.com/support.htm. Product release and supported platforms information for the following programs will be provided to you in writing: Interlace Systems programs Crystal Ball programs Moniforce programs Oracle will provide technical support in accordance with Oracle’s privacy policy available at http://www.oracle.com/html/privacy.html. These Technical Support Policies are subject to change at Oracle's discretion, however the services provided will not be materially reduced during the support period (defined below). To view changes that have been made, please refer to the attached Statement of Changes (PDF). SUPPORT TERMS Technical Support Fees Technical support fees are due and payable annually in advance of a support period, unless otherwise stated in the relevant ordering document or financing or payment contract with Oracle or an Oracle affiliate. Your commitment to pay is required to process your technical support order with Oracle (e.g., purchase order, actual payment, or other approved method of payment). An invoice will be issued only upon receipt of your commitment to pay, and will be sent to a single billing address as designated by you. Failure to submit payment will result in the termination of support. Page 1 of 19\n\n2. Support Period Technical support is effective upon the effective date of your ordering document unless stated otherwise in your ordering document. If your order was placed through the Oracle Store, the effective date is the date your order was accepted by Oracle. Unless otherwise stated in the ordering document, Oracle technical support terms, including pricing, reflect a 12 month support period (the \"support period\"). All technical support services ordered for a support period and the related fees are non-cancelable and non-refundable. Oracle is not obligated to provide technical support beyond the end of the support period unless your technical support contract is renewed on or before the service expiration date. License Set A license set consists of (i) all of your licenses of a program, including any options* (e.g., Database Enterprise Edition and Enterprise Edition Options; Purchasing and Purchasing Options), Enterprise Manager* (e.g., Database Enterprise Edition and Diagnostics Pack), or self- service module* (e.g., Human Resources and Self-Service Human Resources) licensed for such programs, or (ii) all of your licenses of a program which share the same source code**. Development and demonstration licenses available through the Oracle Partner Network or the Oracle Technology Network are not included in the definition of a license set. For Crystal Ball programs, a license set is defined as the same licenses of a program contained on a single order. *As specified on Oracle’s price list. **Programs which share the same source code are: • Database Enterprise Edition, Database Standard Edition, Database Standard Edition One, and Personal Edition, and • Application Server Enterprise Edition, Application Server Standard Edition, and Application Server Java Edition). Matching Service Levels When acquiring technical support, all licenses in any given license set must be supported under the same technical support service level (e.g., Software Update License & Support or unsupported). You may not support a subset of licenses within a license set; the license set must be reduced by terminating any unsupported licenses. You will be required to document license terminations via a termination letter. Reinstatement of Oracle Technical Support In the event that technical support lapses or was not originally purchased, upon the commencement of technical support a reinstatement fee will be assessed. The reinstatement fee is equal to 150% of the last-paid support fee, or 150% of the last-published list technical support price for the licensed program less the applicable standard discount as published on the Oracle Store (“standard discount”) in effect at the time of reinstatement if support was not originally purchased for the relevant programs, prorated from the date technical support is being ordered back to the date technical support lapsed (or the license order date if technical support was never purchased). Applicable renewal adjustments are applied. Once the reinstatement fee has been assessed, technical support for the year following the reinstatement period may be purchased for an additional technical support fee as calculated based on how long the licensed program has been unsupported (“go-forward support fee”). If the lapsed support period is less than 6 months, the go-forward support fee is calculated based on the last-published list technical support price less the applicable standard discount in effect at the time of reinstatement. If the lapsed support period is 6 months or greater, the go-forward support fee is calculated based on the last-paid support fee. If support is not reinstated for the entire license set or if support for a subset of licenses from an ordering document is reinstated, then the “License Set”, “Matching Service Levels”, and “Pricing following Reduction of Licenses or Support Level” policies will apply. Applicable renewal adjustments are applied to the reinstatement fee and go-forward support fee. Page 2 of 19\n\n3. Pricing following Reduction of Licenses or Support Level Pricing for support is based upon the level of support and the volume of licenses for which support is ordered. In the event that a subset of licenses on a single order is terminated or if the level of support is reduced, support for the remaining licenses on that license order will be priced at Oracle's list price for support in effect at the time of termination or reduction minus the applicable standard discount. Such support price will not exceed the previous support fees paid for both the remaining licenses and the licenses being terminated or unsupported, and will not be reduced below the previous support fees paid for the licenses continuing to be supported. If the license order from which licenses are being terminated established a price hold for additional licenses, support for all of the licenses ordered pursuant to the price hold will be priced at Oracle's list price for support in effect at the time of reduction minus the applicable standard discount. Custom Application Bundles Technical support may not be discontinued for a single program module within a custom application bundle. Unsupported Programs Customers with unsupported programs do not receive updates, maintenance releases, patches, telephone assistance, or any other technical support services for the unsupported programs. CD packs or programs purchased or downloaded for trial use, use with other supported programs, or purchased or downloaded as replacement media may not be used to update any unsupported programs. Technical Contacts Your technical contacts are the sole liaisons between you and OSS for technical support of programs. It is the recommended standard that your technical contacts are trained representatives of your company. Such training shall include initial basic product training and, as needed, supplemental training appropriate for specific role or implementation phase, specialized product usage, and/or migration. Your technical contacts should be knowledgeable about the Oracle programs and your Oracle environment in order to help resolve system issues and to assist Oracle in analyzing and resolving service requests. When submitting a service request, your technical contact should have a baseline understanding of the problem you are encountering and an ability to reproduce the problem in order to assist Oracle in diagnosing and triaging the problem. To avoid interruptions in support services, you must notify OSS whenever technical contact responsibilities are transferred to another individual. With the order of Software Update License & Support, you may designate one (1) primary and four (4) backup individuals (\"technical contact\") per license set, to serve as liaisons with OSS. With each USD$250,000 in net support fees per license set, you have the option to designate an additional two (2) primary and four (4) backup technical contacts. Your primary technical contact shall be responsible for (i) overseeing your service request activity, and (ii) developing and deploying troubleshooting processes within your organization. The backup technical contacts shall be responsible for resolving user issues. You may be charged a fee to designate additional technical contacts. Oracle may review service requests logged by your technical contacts, and may recommend specific training to help avoid service requests that would be prevented by such training. Program Updates \"Update\" means a subsequent release of the program which Oracle generally makes available for program licenses to its supported customers at no additional license fee, other than shipping charges if applicable, provided you have ordered a technical support offering that includes software updates for such licenses for the relevant time period. Updates do not include any Page 3 of 19\n\n4. release, option or future program that Oracle licenses separately. Updates are provided when available, and Oracle is under no obligation to develop any future programs or functionality. Any updates made available will be delivered to you, or made available to you for download. If delivered, you will receive one update copy for each supported operating system for which your program licenses were ordered. You shall be responsible for copying, downloading and installing the updates. Payment Plan, Financing and Leasing Agreements Technical support fees due under payment plans, financing or leasing agreements between you and Oracle or an Oracle affiliate (\"payment plan\") are due and payable in accordance with the terms and conditions of such payment plan, but the technical support shall be ordered pursuant to the terms of the applicable ordering document. Lifetime Support Lifetime Support consists of the following service levels: • “Premier Support” which refers to the first 5 years of basic technical support services (also referred to as, and will be documented on your ordering document as, “Software Update License & Support”) • Extended Support (if offered) • Sustaining Support A description of the services available under Premier Support, Extended Support and Sustaining Support is included in the Oracle Technical Support Levels section below. When offered, Premier Support will be available for five years from the date a release of the Oracle program becomes generally available, except as noted below. Based on availability, support may be extended for an additional three years with Extended Support for specific releases. Alternatively, support may be extended with Sustaining Support which will be available for as long as you maintain technical support for your Oracle licenses. Refer to the attached document titled “Lifetime Support Policy: Coverage for Server Technologies (PDF) for specific server technology programs that are, or will be, covered by the Lifetime Support policy. Refer to the attached document titled “Lifetime Support Policy: Coverage for Applications” (PDF) for specific application programs that are, or will be, covered by the Lifetime Support policy. Refer to the attached document titled “Lifetime Support Policy: Coverage for Retail Applications” (PDF) for specific Retail application programs that are, or will be, covered by the Lifetime Support policy. Notes: 1. Active Reasoning, ContextMedia, Interlace Systems, Crystal Ball, Captovation, Notiva, and Sigma Dynamics, and other programs and releases that have already had desupport dates posted on OracleMetaLink are excluded from the Lifetime Support policy. 2. For PeopleSoft Enterprise programs that have been retired under the previous 4-year support policy, Sustaining Support will be available for as long as you maintain technical support for these programs. 3. Tax updates and regulatory changes* will be made available for up to six (6) years from the release date of the licensed software for PeopleSoft Enterprise, JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Page 4 of 19\n\n5. and JD Edwards World programs. Upgrade scripts, new software patches, and fixes to the latest release will be made available for five (5) years from the release date of the licensed software for PeopleSoft Enterprise, JD Edwards EnterpriseOne and JD Edwards World programs. *Tax updates and regulatory changes refers to those updates that address tax and/or regulatory changes which are generally made available to similarly situated licensees of PeopleSoft software, on a when and if available basis only. 4. Oracle’s PeopleTools program, which was purchased in conjunction with an application program release, will be supported for as long as such application program release is supported. PeopleTools fixes are delivered in minor releases and patches; patches are provided on the current minor release only. Patches and platform certifications for a PeopleTools minor release are created when that release becomes generally available and will be supported for twelve (12) months after the next minor release becomes generally available. To receive technical support, you may be required to apply a minor release upgrade of PeopleTools to remain current with versions of third party technologies and products as supported by the provider of the third party product. 5. For certain Oracle Retail application program releases* prior to release 11, limited Premier Support will be available for seven years from when that release became generally available. For Oracle Retail applications for which Premier Support is not available, Sustaining Support will be available for as long as you maintain technical support for these programs. *formerly Retek, ProfitLogic, and 360 Commerce 6. For supported customers, the Extended Support fee for Oracle9i Database Release 9.2 has been waived for the period August 1, 2007 to July 31, 2008. During this period, you will receive access to generally available fixes and critical patch updates (“CPUs”) for such supported Oracle9i Database Release 9.2 programs, at no additional cost other than your fees for Software Update License & Support (or any successor technical support offering to Software Update License & Support). Effective August 1, 2007, fixes and CPUs will be created against Oracle Database version 9.2.0.8 only. 7. For Oracle’s Cimmetry programs, Oracle generally will make Premier Support available for 2 years following general availability of a release, after which Sustaining Support will be available for as long as you maintain technical support for your Oracle licenses. Premier Support for Cimmetry programs will be documented on your ordering document as Software Update License & Support or Cimmetry Maintenance. 8. For supported customers whose Oracle application programs are only certified on Oracle9i Database Release 9.2 and the release for such application programs is currently supported under Premier Support or Extended Support, the Extended Support fee for Oracle9i Database Release 9.2 has been waived for the period August 1, 2008 to July 31, 2010. During this period, you will receive access to generally available fixes and critical patch updates (“CPUs”) for such supported application programs running on the Oracle9i Database Release 9.2, at no additional cost other than your fees for Software Update License & Support (or any successor technical support offering to Software Update License & Support). A list of applications that are certified on Oracle9i Database Release 9.2 is available at http://www.oracle.com/support/collateral/tsp-certified-applications.pdf. 9. For the first year of Sustaining Support for Oracle E-Business Suite Release11i9, Oracle will provide fixes for Severity 1 production bugs. No legislative updates will be provided with the Page 5 of 19\n\n6. exception of U.S. Tax Form 1099 updates for the 2008 tax year. The period for the first year of Sustaining Support for Oracle E-Business Suite Release 11i9 is July 1, 2008 - June 30, 2009. Page 6 of 19\n\n7. Right to Desupport It may become necessary as a part of Oracle's product lifecycle to desupport certain program releases and, therefore, Oracle reserves the right to desupport certain program releases. Program releases that are designated as subject to Premier Support under Oracle’s Lifetime Support policy are excluded. If Agile, Cimmetry, Interlace Systems, Crystal Ball, or Moniforce programs are desupported, you will be notified of such desupport directly by OSS. If Captovation programs are desupported, such notice will be posted at http://captovation.com/support.htm. For all other Oracle programs, desupport information, including desupport dates, information about availability of Extended Support and Sustaining Support, and information about migration paths for certain features, is posted on OracleMetaLink, Customer Connection, and e-Support. Desupport information is subject to change. For Agile, Cimmetry, Interlace Systems Crystal Ball and Moniforce programs, updated desupport information will be provided to you in writing. For Captovation programs, updated desupport information will be posted at http://captovation.com/support.htm. For all other Oracle programs, Oracle will provide updated desupport information on OracleMetaLink, Customer Connection, and e-Support as necessary. First and Second Line Support It is the recommended standard that you establish and maintain the organization and processes to provide “First Line Support” for the supported programs directly to your users. First Line Support shall include but not be limited to (i) a direct response to users with respect to inquiries concerning the performance, functionality or operation of the supported programs, (ii) a direct response to users with respect to problems or issues with the supported programs, (iii) a diagnosis of problems or issues of the supported programs, and (iv) a resolution of problems or issues of the supported programs. If after reasonable commercial efforts you are unable to diagnose or resolve problems or issues of the supported programs, you shall contact Oracle for “Second Line Support”. You shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Oracle with the necessary access (e.g., access to repository files, log files, or database extracts) required to provide Second Line Support. Oracle does not ensure its performance of the technical support described herein if such access is not provided by you when requested by Oracle. Second Line Support shall include but not be limited to (i) a diagnosis of problems or issues of the supported programs and (ii) reasonable commercial efforts to resolve reported and verifiable errors in supported programs so that such supported programs perform in all material respects the functions described in the associated documentation. Oracle may review service requests logged by your technical contacts, and may recommend specific organization and process changes to assist you with the above recommended standard practices. Third Party Vendor-Specific Support Terms You must remain on a supported environment – including applications and platforms – to receive technical support. If a vendor retires support for its product, you may be required to upgrade to a current certified application, hardware platform, framework, database and/or operating system configuration to continue receiving technical support services from Oracle. Page 7 of 19\n\n8. PeopleSoft and JD Edwards Release Information Release information for PeopleSoft Enterprise and JD Edwards EnterpriseOne programs is available in the attached table titled, “Release Types for PeopleSoft Enterprise and JD Edwards EnterpriseOne Applications” (PDF).

TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THESE WARRANTIES ARE EXCLUSIVE AND THERE ARE NO OTHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Limitation of Liability NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUE, DATA, OR DATA USE. ORACLE’S MAXIMUM LIABILITY FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR ORDER, WHETHER IN CONTRACT OR TORT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF THE FEES YOU PAID ORACLE UNDER YOUR ORDER, AND IF SUCH DAMAGES RESULT FROM YOUR USE OF TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES, SUCH LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE FEES YOU PAID ORACLE FOR THE DEFICIENT TECHNICAL SUPPORT SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY. For orders placed pursuant to a Hyperion master agreement, the following terms also apply with respect to the technical support services you have ordered. Nondisclosure By virtue of your order, the parties may have access to information that is confidential to one another (“confidential information”). We each agree to disclose only information that is required for the performance of obligations under your order.

SEVERITY DEFINITIONS Service requests for supported Cimmetry programs may be submitted by you either online using the web form available at http://www.cimmetry.com/techsup.nsf/WebTechsupForm?OpenForm or by telephone by dialing 1 514-735-9941. Service requests for all other supported Oracle programs may be submitted by you either online through Oracle’s web-based customer support systems or by telephone. The service request severity level is selected by you and Oracle and should be based on the following severity definitions: Severity 1 Your production use of the supported programs is stopped or so severely impacted that you cannot reasonably continue work. You experience a complete loss of service. The operation is mission critical to the business and the situation is an emergency. A Severity 1 service request has one or more of the following characteristics: • Data corrupted • A critical documented function is not available • System hangs indefinitely, causing unacceptable or indefinite delays for resources or response • System crashes, and crashes repeatedly after restart attempts For all supported Oracle programs other than Agile, Cimmetry, Crystal Ball, Moniforce webSensor Commerce, webSensor Enterprise, webProbe, and webAlarm and Captovation programs, reasonable efforts will be made to respond to Severity 1 service requests within one (1) hour. For Agile programs, reasonable efforts will be made to respond to Severity 1 service requests within four (4) hours during local business hours, excluding holidays; local business hours are Monday through Friday 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M., PST of the North America region. For Interlace Systems programs, reasonable efforts will be made to respond to Severity 1 service requests within two (2) hours during local business hours, excluding holidays; local business hours are Monday through Friday 9:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. Pacific Time of the North America region. For Crystal Ball programs, the Severity 1 service request definition does not apply and thus no response guidelines are available for Crystal Ball programs. For Moniforce webSensor Commerce, webSensor Enterprise, webProbe, and webAlarm programs, reasonable efforts will be made to respond to Severity 1 service requests within one (1) business day during local business hours, excluding holidays; local business hours are Monday through Friday 8:00 A.M. to 6:00 P.M.

You are requested to propose this severity classification with great care, so that valid Severity 1 situations obtain the necessary resource allocation from Oracle. Severity 2 You experience a severe loss of service. Important features are unavailable with no acceptable workaround; however, operations can continue in a restricted fashion. Severity 3 You experience a minor loss of service. The impact is an inconvenience, which may require a workaround to restore functionality. Page 18 of 19"
