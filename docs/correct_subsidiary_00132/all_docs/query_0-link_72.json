What is Middleware Middleware is the software that connects software components or enterprise applications.\"— Presentation transcript:\n\n1 Oracle Fusion Middleware 11g (OFM) Overview\n\n2 What is Middleware Middleware is the software that connects software components or enterprise applications Middleware is the software layer that lies between the operating system and the applications on each side of a distributed computer network Middleware is the infrastructure which facilitates creation of business applications, and provides core services like concurrency, transactions, threading, messaging, security, high availability It is similar to the middle layer of a three-tier single system architecture, except that it is stretched across multiple systems or applications and supports complex, distributed business software applications.\n\n3 Middleware Architecture\n\n4 House Plumbing System\n\n5 Mostly invisible and hidden Provides standard way of doing things It ties together parts of complex system It lets you worry about other things\n\n6 Middleware Hides – Distributed nature of applications – Enterprise heterogeneity (Hardware, OS, Communication protocols) – Low level programming details Provides uniform, standard, high-level interfaces to the application developers and integrators, so that applications can be easily composed, reused, ported, and made to interoperate Supplies a set of common services to perform various general purpose functions to avoid duplicating efforts, and to facilitate collaboration between applications Makes application development easier\n\n7 Middleware System Design Challenges Performance – Middleware systems rely on interception and indirection mechanisms, which induce performance penalties. Scalability – As applications become more and more interconnected and interdependent, the number of objects, users, and devices tends to increase. Management – Managing large applications that are heterogeneous, widely distributed, and in permanent evolution The availability, reliability, concurrency, security, and performance of applications may also be an issue.\n\n8 Oracle Fusion Middleware (OFW) 11g It’s a massive rebranding of – Oracle homegrown and – Acquired products\n\n9 Oracle Strategic Acquisitions: DATABASE DataScaler (October
