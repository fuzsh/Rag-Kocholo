He has more than a decade of experience working in disparate technologies such as service-oriented architecture, systems management, and everything in between. Other technology areas include cloud computing, database, middleware, and IT management software. While dabbling in these technologies, Narayan wore several hats—from software consultant, database administrator, application developer, to product manager. Prior to these gigs, he went to school at the University of Maryland, and the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur, to pursue various technical degrees. Thinking this was not good enough, he added an MBA from the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nNarayan spent close to a decade at Oracle USA Inc at Redwood Shores, CA, where he was the group product manager for management of middleware and service-oriented architecture products. During his stint at the Application and Systems Management Products division, Narayan led the charge into new markets such as real-user monitoring, Java application diagnostics, middleware management, and service-oriented architecture management. This included key acquisitions such as Moniforce, ClearApp, and AmberPoint. More recently, Narayan has moved to the clouds in San Francisco, leading Salesforce.com's platform strategy and execution with respect to cloud management and cloud data analytics. He lives in San Mateo, CA, with his wife and two-year-old son.\n\nWhen he is not commuting to work, pursuing degrees, or wearing different hats, Narayan loves to wield a racket on a badminton or tennis court, spike a volley ball, or run the half marathon once in a long while.\n\nI am constantly inspired by the two women in my life—my mother and my wife. Thank you for being there for me.\n\nAbout the Reviewers\n\nHans Forbrich is a well-known member of the Oracle Community. He started with Oracle products in 1984 and has kept abreast of nearly all of Oracle's Core Technologies. As ACE Director, Hans has been invited to present at Oracle Open World and various Oracle User Group meetings around the world. His company, Forbrich Computer Consulting Ltd., is well established in western Canada. Hans specializes in delivering Oracle University training through Oracle University and partners such as Exit Certified.\n\nAlthough his special interests include Oracle Spatial, OracleVM, and Oracle Enterprise Linux, Hans has been particularly excited about the advances in Oracle SOA, Oracle WebLogic, and Oracle Grid Control.\n\nHans has been a technical reviewer for a number of Packt Publishing books, including \"Mastering Oracle Scheduler in Oracle 11g Databases,Oracle 10g/11g Data and Database Management Utilities, and Oracle VM Manager 2.1.2.\"\n\nI wish to thank my wife Susanne, and the Edmonton Opera, for their patience while I work on these reviews as well as on my own book.\n\nHector R. Madrid is the author of the \"Oracle 10g/11g Data and Database Management Utilities\" book. He is currently working as a freelance consultant; he collaborates with Oracle University as a certified instructor for the DBA, Java, and Application Server course tracks. He is a highly respected Oracle professional with 20 years of experience as a full-time DBA. He works with a wide range of DBA requirements starting with the daily DBA duties to the tasks related to mission-critical and high-availability systems. He was the first Oracle Certified Master in Latin America. He obtained a Master's Degree in Computer Sciences from the Metropolitan Autonomous University (UAM) and he has presented different technical papers at several Oracle conferences.\n\nI want to thank my family for their patience and the time I borrowed from them during the revision of this book.\n\nArvind Maheshwari, a senior Software Development Manager for the Oracle Enterprise Manager development team, is focused on building management solutions for middleware. He has more than 15 years of experience in the IT industry and has played the role of developer, consultant, architect, and technical manager in the financial, manufacturing, and telecom industries, developing enterprise solutions that are deployed in high-availability architectures.\n\nMatt Wright is a director at Rubicon Red, an independent consulting firm helping customers enable enterprise agility and operational excellence through the adoption of emerging technologies such as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Business Process Management (BPM), and Cloud Computing."
