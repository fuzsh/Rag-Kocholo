Species of Ceratozamia grow from near sea level up to 2,100 meters in Mexico and Mesoamerica. We present a modern taxonomic treatment of Ceratozamia, based on fieldwork combined with detailed study of herbarium specimens in and from Mexico and Central America. This new revision is based on incorporation of morphological, molecular and biogeographic data that have been previously published in circumscriptions of species complexes by our group. Detailed morphological descriptions of the 36 species of Ceratozamia are provided and relevant characters for the genus are discussed and described. A majority are endemic to Mexico and are concentrated at high elevations in mountainous areas. Synonymies, lectotypifications, etymologies, taxonomic notes, distribution maps, illustrations and detailed species-level comparisons are included, as well as a dichotomous key for identification of all species. Data on distributional ranges and habitats of all species are summarized. Ceratozamiaosbornei D.W.Stev., Mart.-Domínguez & Nic.-Mor., sp. nov. is described from evergreen tropical forests of Belize and we highlight new populations and distributional ranges for C.subroseophylla Mart.-Domínguez & Nic.-Mor. and C.vovidesii Pérez-Farr. & Iglesias in the Mesoamerican region.\n\nKeywords: Circumscription, cryptic species, cycads, lectotypification, Mesoamerica, Mexico\n\nIntroduction\n\nCeratozamia Brongn. (Zamiaceae, Cycadales) is characterized by being dioecious with both megasporophylls and microsporophylls having two distinct apical horns. The 36 species of Ceratozamia occur in the tropical region of Mega-Mexico II sensuRzedowski (1991), which was established using floristic criteria and includes Mexico, Guatemala, Belize and northern Nicaragua. This genus inhabits in all these countries except Nicaragua and the greatest diversity and endemism in Ceratozamia are concentrated in the Sierra Madre Oriental and Southwest regions of Mexico (Nicolalde-Morejón et al. 2014; Martínez-Domínguez et al. 2018a). Species described as Ceratozamia from outside this region are properly recognized as other cycad genera (see Excluded names). The genus primarily occurs in oak forest, cloud forest and tropical rain forest on karstic rocks, at an elevational range of 19–2,050 m. Ceratozamia is morphologically distinguished from other genera of Zamiaceae by its two parallel adaxial canals along the rachis, entire leaflet margins, and two horns on the distal end of sporophylls in ovulate and pollen strobili.\n\nCeratozamia is monophyletic with a fossil record dating to the lower Oligocene (Kvaček 2014). Recent phylogenetic analyses of molecular data have supported Stangeria (Kunze) Baill. as sister to Ceratozamia (Nagalingum et al. 2011) while others have placed Stangeria as sister to Microcycas (Miq.) A.DC. + Zamia L. (Salas-Leiva et al. 2013; Condamine et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2022). The phylogenetic relationships within Ceratozamia have been explored using different molecular data sets. González and Vovides (2012) sampled half of the known species and used three genes (nrITS, trnL-F, D-SCAR). More recently, a phylogenetic analysis of this genus that included 28 species and a molecular data set composed of six genes (nrITS, rpoC1, matK, rbcL, psbK/I, atpF/H) produced a topology resolved with low support values (Medina-Villarreal et al. 2019); in turn, Martínez-Domínguez et al. (2020) sampled 32 species and only two genes (nrITS and matK) but produced a poorly resolved topology. Studies of diversification ages of Cycadales using phylogenomic analyses have included between 70 and 83% of currently accepted Ceratozamia species, which recovered better node support (Nagalingum et al. 2011; Condamine et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2022). As a result, species relationships within Ceratozamia are becoming clearer and more work will be needed with continued exploration that will undoubtedly lead to new discoveries.\n\nSince the description of the genus by Brongniart (1846), there has been an explosion of interest in this group. Miquel (1848) described five new species using only vegetative characters. Ceratozamia poses a taxonomic challenge, however, due to its significant vegetative morphological variation, which was a fact realized by Miquel (1868, 1869a) when he lumped all of his previously described species into C.mexicana Brongn. These early taxonomic treatments varied greatly in the number of species recognized within the genus with contrasting findings in each treatment (Regel 1857a, b; Miquel 1861, 1868, 1869a, b; Regel 1876a, b; Thiselton-Dyer 1884; Schuster 1932). Particularly, the ‘Miquel taxonomic names’ have undergone a series of rearrangements in synonymy and recognition of infraspecific categories. Many of these names were clarified by Stevenson and Sabato (1986) when they focused on the typification of all described species in the genus at that time, but did not include a list of invalid names. More recently, a regional taxonomic review focused on the Mexican Sierra Madre Oriental provided new observations that have allowed detailed reassessment and designation of nomenclatural types for some of these names (Martínez-Domínguez et al. 2018a).\n\nExplorations in Mexico during the past three decades have uncovered new species of Ceratozamia, thereby, rapidly increasing its known diversity. Nevertheless, the taxonomy of Ceratozamia has been mainly characterized by rearrangements of infrageneric taxa, treatments in floristic works and species-level treatments of species complexes (Vovides et al. 1983; Stevenson et al. 1986; Pérez-Farrera et al. 1999; Avendaño et al. 2003; Pérez-Farrera et al. 2009; Vovides et al. 2012; Martínez-Domínguez et al. 2016, 2017c). Recent taxonomic efforts based on analyses of quantitative and qualitative morphological variation, phenology as well as DNA sequences of nuclear, plastid and mitochondrial genomes have produced new insights on the circumscription of species complexes and the most comprehensive taxonomic reviews of Ceratozamia to date (Martínez-Domínguez et al. 2016, 2017a, b, 2018a, 2022a). In addition, work focusing on the morphometric variation of vegetative characters and anatomical features have contributed to the clarification of some species (Pérez-Farrera et al. 2014; Vovides et al. 2016; Medina-Villarreal et al. 2019; Gutiérrez-Ortega et al. 2021). These studies have greatly enhanced our understanding of morphological variation, particularly in vegetative characters. Recently, genomic data from 100 nuclear single-copy genes have provided evidence for future directions in the study of the ontogeny of reproductive structures and associated evolutionary processes (Liu et al. 2022).\n\nCurrently, quantitative vegetative morphological characters are considered as the most taxonomically informative characters within Ceratozamia (Vovides et al. 2004; Pérez-Farrera et al. 2009). Because these types of characters exhibit high intra- and interspecific variation, renewed morphological exploration into reproductive structures has contributed additional information. This is particularly the case for ovulate strobilus characters, such as the angle between the horns of the megasporophylls, the strobilus apex and the shape of the distal face of megasporophylls (Martínez-Domínguez et al. 2018a). Additional characters are also present in pollen strobili such as the shape of the microsporophylls, the size of the horns, and shape of the fertile and infertile part. However, the use of reproductive characters has been limited by the difficulty of collecting reproductive structures in the field and the lack of these in herbaria. Also, usually ovulate and/or pollen strobili are fragmented as a result of incorrect processing of these structures and damage during handling.\n\nThe reproductive phenology of Ceratozamia is annual (Stevenson 1981). To date, our knowledge of the phenological phases for ovulate and pollen strobili indicates four phases in each (Martínez-Domínguez et al. 2022a). In both pollen and ovulate strobili the cycle starts with emergence, which is characterized by emergence from among the cataphylls. In pollen strobili, the sequence goes from a closed strobilus, followed by an open strobilus with dehiscence of the sporangia and, finally, senescence. In ovulate strobili, opening cracks develop between sporophylls (indicating receptivity), then a late ovulate strobilus with seeds if pollinated and, finally, disintegration (Martínez-Domínguez et al. 2018b). The receptivity and open pollen phases are critical for pollination and subsequent fertilization of ovules because this genus is pollinated by “pleasing fungus beetles” of family Erotylidae (Norstog and Nicholls 1997).\n\nIn this paper, as part of our comprehensive systematic review of the genus, we describe in detail ovulate and pollen strobili, including internal structures and their character states. This was possible by broad sampling in wild populations. We also examine overlooked morphological characters, conduct a nomenclatural review of species, and offer a comprehensive identification key for the genus. Here, we synthesize biogeographic information to account for their distributional range. By default, Ceratozamia and all of its species are listed and covered by CITES Appendix 1, but only 21 of the 36 species have had asessments (Calonje et al. 2013–2022; IUCN 2021). Those data are included in species treatments when available. Thus, this monograph is particularly timely and valuable in this era of habitat destruction and illegal collecting. Having a complete taxonomic treatment will allow for appropriate identifications that will lead to informed conservation assessments and actions (Stevenson et al. 2003; Rutherford et al. 2013; Martínez-Domínguez et al. 2021).\n\nMaterials and methods\n\nThe species circumscriptions for Ceratozamia presented here are based on extensive fieldwork, as well as review of specimens from a substantial number of herbaria, including BIGU, BM, BRH, CAS, CH, CHAPA, CHIP, CIB, EAP, ENCB, F, FCME, FTG, GH, HEM, HNT, IBUG, IEB, K, L, LE, LSU, MICH, MEXU, MO, NAP, NY, P, SERO, SLPM, TEFH, U, US, XAL, XALU, UAT, USCG (acronyms according to Thiers 2022), either by examining the specimens physically or electronically through the Global Plants web portal (http://plants.jstor.org/). Because most cycad specimens are sterile, we have taken the opportunity to record the presence of cones when they are present in a collection. We also examined the protologues of all species described and exhaustively searched for type specimens in the registered herbaria. It should be noted, however, that the type specimens for C.chimalapensis Pérez-Farr. & Vovides, C.dominguezii Pérez-Farr. & Gut.Ortega, C.sancheziae Pérez-Farr., Gut.Ortega & Vovides, and C.zoquorum Pérez-Farr., Vovides & Iglesias could not be found. Decisions on lectotypes were taken only when we confirmed that there was no evidence of the holotype’s existence at the herbaria cited in the protologue. The specimens collected by us were under scientific collection permit SGPA/DGVS/5506 from SEMARNAT (Mexico) and MP-0209-2021 from ICF (Honduras). The geographical coordinates of each specimen were compiled in a database in ArcMap 10.2 (Esri, Redlands, USA) to determine the distribution of Ceratozamia using the biogeographic regionalization of the Neotropical region scheme of Morrone et al. (2022). Because species are all CITES listed, the specimens examined only indicate Municipality and elevation.\n\nCriteria to delimit species. The taxonomic treatment presented here is partly based on our previously published work on species complexes, considered from an integrative taxonomy perspective for corroboration or refutation of taxonomic hypotheses and employing the “taxonomic circle” sensuDeSalle et al. (2005), in which multiple data sources are analyzed independently for hypotheses testing (Martínez-Domínguez et al. 2016; 2017a, b, 2018a, 2020, 2022a, b). For taxa we have not treated previously, species were recognized by a unique combination of morphological characters evaluated at the population level, considering their biogeographic distribution patterns as an additional source of evidence. We have recognized neither subspecies nor varieties, but have rather described the variability when it was present.\n\nSpecialized characters and terminology. The morphological terminology used in the descriptions was standardized according to Moreno (1984) and Harris and Harris (2000). Most Ceratozamia reproductive structures and characters have been recently described (Martínez-Domínguez et al. 2020). We evaluated 20 qualitative and 23 quantitative reproductive characters in pollen and ovulate strobili (Figs , ; Table ; Suppl. material 1). Generally, the terminology for the orientation of ovulate strobilus is given using the terms “decumbent” or “erect”. However, the fertile portion of a strobilus could be inclined at an angle of 180° or prostrate, but not curved. Usually, this condition is derived from weight at maturity. Only the peduncle is curved or erect; the definition for decumbent is reclined with tip ascending, but the peduncle in this genus is not ascending. Here, we have used “pendulous”, which is a more appropriate term and is defined as drooping downward, rather than “decumbent”, as often appears in previous literature.\n\nTable 1.\n\nCharacterCharacter statePollen strobilus position(0) erect; (1) pendulousPollen strobilus shape(0) angulate; (1) cylindricalPollen strobilus color(0) greenish yellow; (1) greenish brown (2) reddish brown; (3) yellowish brownDistal face of microsporophylls(0) non-recurved; (1) recurvedMicrosporophylls shape(0) discoid; (1) obconic; (2) ellipticMicrosporophylls horns type(0) thin; (1) robustInfertile portion shape(0) orbicular; (1) rounded; (2) linearFertile portion shape(0) lobate; (1) deeply lobateOrientation of horns microsporophylls(0) straight; (1) curvedAngle between horns of microsporophylls(0) acute; (1) obtuse; (2) rightOvulate strobilus position(0) erect; (1) pendulousOvulate strobilus color (trichomes)(0) light brown; (1) blackish to dark; (2) brown; (3) reddish brown; (4) greyish; (5) wineOvulate strobilus apex(0) acuminate; (1) acute; (2) mucronate; (3) apiculateOvulate strobilus shape(0) cylindrical; (1) globoseAngle between horns of megasporophylls(0) acute; (1) right; (2) obtuseMegasporophylls horns type(0) thin; (1) robustDirection of horns megasporophylls(0) non-recurved; (1) recurvedOrientation of horn horns megasporophylls(0) straight; (1) curvedDistal face of megasporophylls shape(0) truncate; (1) prominentSarcotesta color(0) whitish yellow; (1) whitish redSeed shape(0) ovate; (1) globose; (2) spherical\n\nIn microsporophylls, seven qualitative characters have been described: 1) microsporophyll shape, 2) distal face of the microsporophyll, 3) microsporophyll horn type, 4) infertile apical portion shape, 5) fertile portion shape, 6) direction of microsporophyll horns, and 7) angle between the horns of the microsporophylls. The direction of horns was coded in relation to the base of the infertile portion in the microsporophyll. In addition, six quantitative characters have been evaluated: 1) length of microsporophylls, 2) width of microsporophylls, 3) number of microsporangia per microsporophyll, 4) horn length of microsporophylls, 5) distance between the horns of a microsporophyll, and 6) length of the infertile apical portion of a microsporophyll (Figs , ; see Suppl. material 1 for details).\n\nThe position of leaves is a character that refers to the arrangement of the leaves in relation to the stem apex. The leaves are ascending when they are oriented obliquely upward or with the upper half of the leaf curved apically. The prickles on the petioles of leaves can be robust when the prickle is abruptly tapered from the base to the apex or thin when the shape is homogenous or is gradually tapering. In several species, the prickles are grouped and can bifurcate. The number of prickles differs among species; this character is most conspicuous at the base of the petiole. Here, the prickles were counted along 10 cm from the base to distal end on the petiole (Fig. ).\n\nResults\n\nCircumscription\n\nWe recognize 36 species in Ceratozamia, including one new species from Belize, characterized by megasporophylls covered by abundant purple to wine-colored trichomes present throughout the ontogeny of the strobilus, the acuminate apex of its ovulate strobili, and pollen strobili with a long infertile portion from 0.65 to 0.80 cm long (Figs , ).\n\nHabit\n\nThe species are terrestrial or rupicolous. Ceratozamiabrevifrons Miq., C.morettii Vázq.Torres & Vovides and C.tenuis (Dyer) D.W.Stev. & Vovides are terrestrial, but all three species can occasionally be found as epiphytes (Fig. ). We found ovuliferous plants of C.morettii growing as epiphytes in Veracruz, Mexico. Adult individuals have been recorded growing up to 8 meters in height from the base of a host tree. All Ceratozamia species have a pachycaulous stem and are epigeous or semi-epigeous. Most of the species have erect stems, which may branch dichotomously with age. Only four species have an arborescent appearance, with stems of up to 2.5 meters long (C.aurantiaca Pérez-Farr., Gut.Ortega, J.L.Haynes & Vovides, C.osbornei sp. nov., C.robusta Miq., and C.subroseophylla Mart.-Domínguez & Nic.-Mor.). Some plants of C.subroseophylla have a stem up to 5 meters long but decumbent.\n\nVegetative morphology\n\nThe ptyxis of leaves can be inflexed as in C.matudae Lundell or circinate as in C.miqueliana H.Wendl. (Fig. ). The petiole of leaves elongates during leaf growth while the leaflets are progressively expanded. In the early stages of elongation, the apical end of the leaf becomes reflexed and subsequently straightens. During their development, the leaves have trichomes that are unbranched and brown or white in color. The trichomes are shed during elongation of the leaf. The color of new leaves can be green to yellowish or brown to reddish brown (Fig. ). This leaf coloration disappears at maturity, except for a few species such as C.chamberlainii Mart.-Domínguez, Nic.-Mor. & D.W.Stev., in which the color remains at the base of the leaflets, margin and rachis. The emerging leaf color is generally homogeneous among individuals in a population and within a species. However, this character is polymorphic in C.fuscoviridis W.Bull. and C.sancheziae Pérez-Farr., Gut.Ortega & Vovides where different individual plants may have brown or green leaves at emergence.\n\nCeratozamia has cataphylls and well-developed stipules (Stevenson 1981, 1992). The stipules are positioned on the base of petioles as a winglike structure with each stipule having two free tips. These stipules, which encircle shoot apex, have a linear shape and are covered by light brown trichomes (Figs , ) and are usually between 1.5 to 5 cm long and 0.4 to 2 cm wide. Cataphylls are foliar organs that emerge from apex of stem associated with reproductive events. Their development occurs in a series of two or more cataphylls. These are brown to reddish brown and triangular to narrowly triangular and covered by scarce or abundant brown or dark brown trichomes (Figs , ). They become glabrous or partially glabrous at maturity (Fig. ).\n\nReproductive morphology\n\nPollen grains are sulcate, and exine surface and sexine nearly identical (Dehgan and Dehgan 1988). Some slight differences in measurements of grains have been found; however, the ornamentation and shape of pollen are similar in all species (Vovides et al. 2021).\n\nThe ovulate and pollen strobili have two horns at the distal end of each sporophyll. The ovulate strobili show minimal variation at the species level. In most species, the ovulate strobilus shape is cylindrical, whereas in Ceratozamiamorettii and C.matudae it is globose. However, the color of trichomes, apex shape, angle between horns and the distal face of megasporophylls are useful for discriminating between species (Table ). In contrast, the pollen strobili possess distinctive characters for identifying several species including closely related taxa (Table ). The microsporophyll horns can be thin or robust, and show different orientations (i.e., straight or recurved). C.sabatoi Vovides & Vázq.Torres is the only species with recurved microsporophylls with a downward distal face (Fig. ).\n\nGenerally, the characters of reproductive structures exhibit little variation within populations. However, these characters are polymorphic in some species such as Ceratozamiadelucana Vázq.Torres, A.Moretti & Carv.-Hern., in which the infertile apical portion shape of microsporophylls can be orbicular or discoid in the same population. Other species with a similar variation pattern are C.alvarezii Pérez-Farr., Vovides & Iglesias and C.mirandae Vovides, Pérez-Farr. & Iglesias. Both of these species have an angle between the horns of microsporophylls that is either obtuse or acute.\n\nThe seeds are very similar in all species. The most common shape is ovate that can be somewhat irregular, whereas some species such as Ceratozamiaalvarezii and C.mirandae have spherical seeds, and C.matudae and C.sancheziae have globose seeds (Fig. ). Seeds are brown to light brown and are between 1.5 and 2.5 cm long, although some species have seeds up to 3.8 cm long (e.g., C.subroseophylla).\n\nPhenology\n\nPlants produce a new flush of leaves annually or biannually in a low spiral. The leaves emerge in flushes of from 2, as C.latifolia Miq., to 20 as in adult plants of C.osbornei and C.subroseophylla. However, the plants of most species produce between six and 12 leaves. Generally, the leaves emerge during January to March. Some plants at population level may produce leaves during August to September.\n\nThe ovulate and pollen strobili emerge from among the cataphylls. Polliniferous plants produce between 1 to 2 strobili per apex, whereas ovulate plants produce only 1 strobilus per apex and very rarely two in vigorous large plants such as Ceratozamiaosbornei and C.mexicana, particularly in cultivation. We found up to 5 pollen strobili in the same plant during a reproductive season; generally, these pollen strobili emerge within 1 to 2 months of each other. We have recorded very few ovulate plants with more than one strobilus. The phenology shows a slightly different pattern between species. Generally, the strobili emerge between July and September. However, in some species the emergence can occur two months later (e.g., C.miqueliana).\n\nDistribution, endemism and habitat\n\nCeratozamia occurs from Mexico to Guatemala, Belize and Honduras in Central America. According to the biogeographic regionalization of the Neotropical region (Morrone et al. 2022) Ceratozamia occurs in Mexican Transition Zone and Mesoamerican dominion of Brazilian subregion (Fig. ). In the first, there are 69% (25 of 36 species) of the species, which are distributed in Sierra Madre Oriental (SMO), Sierra Madre del Sur (SMS), Transmexican Volcanic Belt Province (TVBP), and Chiapas Highlands (CH). The SMO and CH are the provinces with the highest concentration of species richness in the genus (8 species in each province). The SMS and TVBP have 5 (C.aurantiaca, C.leptoceras Mart.-Domínguez, Nic.-Mor., D.W.Stev. & Lorea-Hern., C.mixeorum Chemnick, T.J.Greg. & Salas-Mor., C.oliversacksii D.W.Stev., Mart.-Domínguez & Nic.-Mor., and C.whitelockiana Chemnick & T.J.Greg.) and 4 species, respectively (C.delucana, C.mexicana, C.morettii and C.tenuis).\n\nIn the Mesoamerican dominion of the Brazilian subregion, species occur in two provinces: Veracruzan province and Mosquito province. In Veracruzan province 14 species are present (C.becerrae Pérez-Farr., Vovides & Schutzman, C.brevifrons, C.chimalapensis, C.decumbens Vovides, Avendaño, Pérez-Farr. & Gonz.-Astorga, C.delucana, C.euryphyllidia Vázq.Torres, Sabato & D.W.Stev., C.huastecorum Avendaño, Vovides & Cast.-Campos, C.mexicana, C.miqueliana, C.robusta, C.santillanii Pérez-Farr. & Vovides, C.subroseophylla, C.osbornei, and C.zoquorum Pérez-Farr., Vovides & Iglesias), whereas in Mosquito province only a single species (C.hondurensis J.L.Haynes, Whitelock, Schutzman & R.S.Adams) occurs. In particular, C.mexicana and C.delucana also occur in TVBP and C.robusta in CH and Veracruzan provinces. Ceratozamia has not been reported from the Yucatán Peninsula province (Fig. ); we believe this is due to lack of collections in the southwest of Yucatán (Mexico). The apparent disjunct pattern from El Petén Department (Guatemala) may be explained by this collection deficiency.\n\nWith 32 endemic species of Ceratozamia, Mexico is the center of endemism of the genus. Only four species are occur in Central American countries: C.hondurensis from Honduras; C.osbornei from Belize; and C.robusta and C.vovidesii Pérez-Farr. & Iglesias from Guatemala. Some species have a broad geographic range, while others occur in a very limited area. Most of the species that have narrower distributions can be considered micro-endemics, such as C.alvarezii and C.morettii in Chiapas States and Central Veracruz from Mexico, respectively. In contrast, C.robusta has a broad distribution, with a range from northwest Chiapas (Mexico) to Guatemala. Other species of the genus with broad distributions are C.miqueliana and C.subroseophylla. The latter species has been considered endemic to the montane region of Los Tuxtlas (State of Veracruz, Mexico). However, we found populations at southwest of Veracruz in the Uxpanapa region and Tabasco State, which represent an extension of its geographical range. In particular, the population of C.subroseophylla from Tabasco represents a new record for this Mexican state.\n\nMontane regions show the highest diversity of Ceratozamia species. The distributional pattern is congruent with the existence of the main mountain systems of Mexico. The mean elevation for Ceratozamia species is 1,100 m (range 19–2,000 m), with the majority of the species occurring between 800 to 1,200 m. Ceratozamiamiqueliana, occurs at 19 meters of elevation in lowland vegetation of Veracruz, while C.mixeorum and C.zaragozae Medellín are the species that occur at higher elevations above 1,200 m of Oaxaca and San Luis Potosí, respectively.\n\nSpecies richness in Ceratozamia tends to be correlated with moister habitats, principally in limestone rock areas. The genus is found in four vegetation types: cloud forest, evergreen tropical forest, oak forest and oak-pine forest. Most species inhabit cloud forest, whereas in oak-pine forest there are only a few species. No species is known from dry forest. Some species do grow near to rivers or lagoons, e.g., C.aurantiaca and C.miqueliana near the Santo Domingo River and Majahual lagoons, respectively.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe cycad genus Ceratozamia as here circumscribed includes 36 species, 34 of which are found in Mexico with 32 of those endemic to Mexico. C.robusta is the species with the widest distribution in the genus, occurring continuously from the central region of Chiapas State in Mexico to Guatemala. Unfortunately, herbarium specimens from Guatemala are infertile and there are few sterile specimens in herbaria in general, which has led to ambiguous and/or conflicting taxonomic identifications. Comparative vegetative morphology with these specimens suggests that C.robusta also has a wide elevational range between 400 meters and up to 1,300 meters of elevation. However, recently collected reproductive material has been observed for plants from Belize, which have revealed features that demonstrate that the Belize plants can be distinguished from those in Mexico and Guatemala resulting in our description of C.osbornei. Further population level studies of this species are needed to evaluate genetic differentiation and gene flow throughout the entire ranges of both C.osbornei and C.robusta. C.matudae was reported for Guatemala from the Sierra de Cuchumatanes in the 1940s, but no past or recently collected specimens have been located. Considering this paucity of information and the exceptionally rapid loss of forest cover in the region, a thorough exploration and study of these localities is essential.\n\nRecently, Vovides et al. (2020) recircumscribed the Ceratozamiamiqueliana complex using leaflet anatomy and other macromorphological characters. As a result, C.zoquorum was recircumscribed with a much narrower taxonomic concept. They considered the presence or absence of girder sclerenchyma and a lignified hypodermis to be a significant trait to distinguish between C.zoquorum and C.becerrae, and the latter was removed from synonymy under C.zoquorum. However, we found that the corresponding taxonomic key failed to properly identify these closely related species with anatomical characters that are contradictory to the descriptions. Thus, there is a lack of correspondence between the key entries and homologous character states in both supposed species (Vovides et al. 2020; p. 11).\n\nTherefore, the only two remaining anatomical characters relevant in this case are: 1) girder sclerenchyma present in Ceratozamiazoquorum and mostly absent in C.becerrae, and 2) a lignified adaxial hypodermis in C.zoquorum that is also absent in C.becerrae. According to the descriptions provided by the authors, the hypodermis in C.becerrae is absent only in the revolute leaflet margin with up to three layers of fibres, whereas in C.zoquorum such margin is discontinuous with 1–7 lignified isodiametric fibres.\n\nIn their anatomical evaluation, Vovides et al. (2020: 2) studied two cultivated individuals for evaluating phenotypic variation. The anatomical characters should therefore be characterized and reassessed under a broader approach by testing the morphological variation through different populations at the intra- and inter-population level: most leaflet macromorphological characters —including qualitative ones— often exhibit polymorphisms, as well as wide variation at the population level. Generally, leaflets exhibit high variation mainly in quantitative characters (Pérez-Farrera et al. 2009; Martínez-Domínguez et al. 2017a, c). Considering then that leaflets in Ceratozamia species show contrasting shapes between geographically close species, but similar shapes even when the biogeographic pattern is disjunct, we suggest that the leaflet anatomy should be re-assessed through broader sampling.\n\nBased on our research, the taxonomic value of some traditional morphological characters —such as leaflet size— should only be secondarily important, and the focus should be put on defining qualitative characters in both leaves and leaflets, and characters derived from reproductive structures as proposed in Table . Regarding the latter, we observed that the position of ovulate strobilus was not consistent throughout the different ontogenetic states. Ovulate strobili can recline due to the weight of the fertile portion of ovulate strobilus and because of the position of the plant growing on a rocky wall. This is mainly because the ovulate strobilus position is correlated with the length of the peduncle of strobili and the fact that the peduncle curves at maturity. Our data support that other characters such as those of the microsporophylls and the shape of their horns can be coded into discrete character states and, therefore, provide more taxonomic utility than previously understood.\n\nThis modern taxonomic treatment is drawn from wide sampling, thorough review of specimens in collections and molecular data (Martínez-Domínguez et al. 2016, 2017c, 2020), thus establishing a framework for future research and providing a resource for disentangling confusing species. Ultimately, this work contributes to the conservation of this threatened genus. Despite advances in the taxonomy and systematics of this genus, taxon-level data are required for a complete systematic evaluation. We suggest that the use of phenological information as well as a more nuanced understanding of phenotypic evolution —including, for example, instances of plasticity and other ontogenetic development-related phenomena— that might impact diversification in species complexes or other groups of closest related species in this gymnosperm genus, will be increasingly relevant for the task.\n\nTaxonomic treatment\n\n.

This is derived from Latin word aurantiacus for the orange color of emerging leaves.\n\nCommon names.\n\nNone recorded.\n\nUses.\n\nPeople use the leaves of Ceratozamiaaurantiaca to make flower arrangements in wreaths (Martínez-Domínguez et al. 2022a).\n\nPreliminary conservation status.\n\nWe visited three populations for Ceratozamiaaurantiaca in which we recorded between 100 to 300 adult plants. We observed seedlings, juveniles and reproductive individuals. However, one of these populations is in a risk area due to anthropogenic land-use changes and was affected by fire in 2018. In addition, it is not found within protected areas. Based upon this information, C.aurantiaca should be considered “Endangered (EN)” in accordance with IUCN criteria.\n\nDiscussion.\n\nCeratozamiaaurantiaca is most similar to C.whitelockiana, however, differs from it in its oblong leaflets abruptly acuminate with a symmetric apex, its petiole with abundant (16–24) and long prickles (0.32–0.55 cm), and its rachis that has prickles in the proximal third of the leaf. In addition, the ovulate strobili have an acute apex, and the pollen strobili have obconic microsporophylls with a rounded infertile portion. The leaves are reddish brown at emergence, whereas in C.whitelockiana they are green.\n\nSpecimens examined.\n\nMexico. Oaxaca: Mun. Chiquihuitlán de Benito Juárez, 861 m, 26 Nov 2004, C.A.

These populations are periodically producing ovulate and pollen strobili. The main problem is the loss of habitat in the central area of Veracruz, where there are no protected natural areas (Martínez-Domínguez et al. 2021). These data suggest the category “Endangered (EN)” under (B1ab(iii)) criteria.\n\nDiscussion.\n\nCeratozamiadelucana is highly variable and in vegetative morphology similar to C.morettii. However, there are clear differences in their ovulate strobili. In C.delucana, ovulate strobili are green and generally without trichomes at maturity and have an acute apex, whereas in C.morettii they are green with blackish trichomes at maturity and have an apiculate apex. Additionally, C.delucana is a larger plant than C.morettii, with C.delucana having leaves up to 223 cm long with up to 43 pairs of leaflets and ovulate strobili 17–40 cm long.\n\nSpecimens examined.\n\nMexico.

Cataphylls 4.5–7 × 4.2–7.5 cm wide at the base, persistent, triangular, reddish brown, densely tomentose at emergence, glabrous at maturity, apex acute. Leaves 2–22, 95–337.5 cm long, ascending, light green, glaucous at emergence, with whitish gray trichomes, glabrous at maturity. Petiole 40–193 cm long, terete, linear, green to yellowish (pink in new leaves); with 8–35 thin prickles, 0.13–0.50 cm long. Rachis 53–218.5 cm long, terete, linear, green to yellowish in mature leaves, with prickles. Leaflets 6–17 pairs, opposite to subopposite, insertion in one plane, broadly obovate, in general longitudinally planar, not basally falcate, membranaceous, flat, green with adaxial and abaxial sides glabrous, distal end with sinuate margins, acuminate and asymmetrical at the apex, attenuate at base, with prominent and light-green veins; median leaflets 19.9–35.7 × 8.5–17.6 cm, 9–22 cm between leaflets; articulations 0.9–1.4 cm wide, yellow and green. Pollen strobili 27–35 cm long, 3–4.3 cm in diameter, solitary, cylindrical, erect, greenish yellow with reddish trichomes at emergence, greenish with black trichomes at maturity; peduncle 6–12 cm long, 1.5–2 cm in diameter, tomentose, reddish brown to brown; microsporophylls 1.0–1.5 × 0.5–1.3 cm, discoid with a non-recurved distal face and a lobate fertile portion, infertile portion 0.37–0.45 cm long and orbicular and rounded with straight horns 0.35–0.50 cm long, 0.60–0.72 cm and an acute angle between the horns. Ovulate strobili 15–20 cm long, 5–6 cm in diameter, solitary, cylindrical, erect, yellowish green to green with abundant, deep red trichomes at emergence, greenish brown with abundant, dark reddish brown trichomes at maturity, acuminate apex; peduncle 5–11.5 cm long, 1–2.5 cm in diameter, erect, tomentose, light brown; megasporophylls 35–64, 1.5–3 × 1.2–1.8 cm, 7–8 orthostichies with 5–8 sporophylls per orthostichy, 2.0–4.0 × 2.8–3.4 cm wide, with a truncate distal face, horns straight and 0.60–0.80 cm long, 0.99–1.40 cm between horns with an acute angle between the horns. Seeds 2.3–2.5 cm long, 1.5–1.7 cm in diameter, ovate, sarcotesta whitish red when immature, light brown at maturity.\n\nDistribution and habit.\n\nCeratozamiaeuryphyllidia is endemic to the forest of Uxpanapa-Chimalapas in Oaxaca and Veracruz States, Mexico (Fig. ) where it inhabits evergreen tropical rain forest on clay soils at the top and sides of hills between 100 and 630 m elevation.\n\nEtymology.\n\nThe specific epithet represents the very wide, diagnostic leaflets of this species. It comes from the Greek euryphyllos, which means, “wide leaflet”.\n\nCommon names.\n\nNone recorded.\n\nUses.\n\nNone recorded.\n\nConservation status.\n\n(IUCN 2021). Ceratozamiaeuryphyllidia is listed as “Critically Endangered (CR)” under criteria B2ab(i,ii,iii,iv,v). We carried out a census in two populations for this species, in which we found between 20 to 60 adult plants. The population in Veracruz has reproductive plants, juvenile and seedlings; however, it is a small population and the surrounding area has been transformed to anthropogenic landscapes. We suggest that this status should be maintained.\n\nDiscussion.\n\nCeratozamiaeuryphyllidia is easily diagnosable from its congeners in Mexico by its broadly obovate, lustrous and membranaceous leaflets asymmetrical apex of leaflets. Also, the ovulate strobili are greenish brown with an acuminate apex, and its megasporophylls are green with abundant dark brown trichomes. This species is most similar to C.hondurensis, but it can be distinguished by its sinuate margins at distal end of leaflets, whereas in C.hondurensis they are entire.\n\nSpecimens examined.\n\nMexico.

Ovulate strobili 24–35 cm long, 8.5–15 cm in diameter, solitary, cylindrical, erect, green with brown trichomes at emergence, brown-green with dark brown trichomes at maturity, acuminate apex; peduncle 4–15.5 cm long, 1.8–2.5 cm in diameter, erect or pendulous, tomentose, brown to reddish brown; megasporophylls 49–195, 7–15 orthostichies with 7–15 sporophylls per orthostichy, 2.3–3.5 × 3.0–4.0 cm, with a truncate distal face, horns straight and 0.70–0.99 cm long, 1.7–2.1 cm between horns and an obtuse angle between the horns. Seeds 2–2.6 cm long, 1.5–2 cm in diameter, ovate, sarcotesta whitish yellow to yellow when immature, light brown at maturity.\n\nDistribution and habitat.\n\nCeratozamiafuscoviridis is endemic to south to central Carso Huasteco in Mexico from Hidalgo to northwest of Veracruz States (Fig. ) in cloud forests between 1,300–1,900 m elevation.\n\nEtymology.\n\nThe epithet refers to the dark-brown color of the leaf at emergence.\n\nCommon names.\n\nMexico. Veracruz: teocintle, teocintli and tepecintli (Bonta et al. 2019).\n\nUses.\n\nThis species has decorative uses associated with religious ceremonies and national holidays. The leaves are commonly used to make arches in the entrances of some Roman Catholic churches or decorate the walls during national holidays.\n\nConservation status.\n\n(IUCN 2021). Ceratozamiafuscoviridis is listed as “Critically Endangered” under criteria B1ab(i,iii,iv,v). This species requires a reassessment of its conservation status because new populations have recently been recorded, including its current circumscription that includes populations from Veracruz State. Based on the number of populations, modelled potential geographical distribution from ecological niche and its occurrence in a Natural Protected Areas (Los Mármoles National Park), C.fuscoviridis could be listed as “Endangered (EN)” (Martínez-Domínguez et al. 2021).\n\nDiscussion.\n\nCeratozamiafuscoviridis is polymorphic within populations because individual plants may have either a light green or dark-brown leaf color at emergence. Individuals with dark-brown leaf at emergence also have a brownish abaxial side. This species is most geographically proximate to C.chamberlainii, but it can be distinguished by lanceolate and papyraceous leaflets, a petiole armed with long and thin prickles; and ovulate strobili that are brownish green with dark trichomes at maturity.\n\nOsborne et al. (2006) intended to validate Ceratozamiafuscoviridis D.Moore, which was invalidly published in 1878. However, in 2017, Calonje & Sennikov published the correction to this name using a brief description by William Bull in horticultural catalogues. This work is the valid publication for the specie and the name “C.fuscoviridis D.Moore” is an isonym with no nomenclatural status.\n\nSpecimens examined.\n\nMexico. Hidalgo: Mun.
