        "text": "Abstract: This paper draws on an empirical example in Oaxaca, Mexico to understand how space is (re)constructed through material and metaphorical practice. Our research on the ways in which the Zoque-speaking Indians of Chimalapas—a forest region of the state—have sought to reframe space through the formation of buffer villages to prevent encroachment on communally held land is motivated by two broad theoretical concerns. The first is to draw attention to a region of Mexico not widely addressed in geographic literature where there exist very active indigenous struggles. A second motivation relates to the continued decoupling of binaries, in particular the construct of “powerful vs powerless”. We argue that the strategies of the marginalized are enacted through the reconfiguration of spatiality and power relations predicated in part on the differentially situated subjects within a social group. Our concern is to hint at the multiplicities involved in subordination tangibly and materially within a population that often is categorized unproblematically and scripted as ‘powerless’. In examining the intricacies of the spatial strategies employed by members of the Zoque minority we show how unities and stabilities are produced against a backdrop of conflict.\n\nIn this paper, we examine how Mexico's 1992 counter-reforms reinforced social hierarchies between two 'classes' of residents within three ejidos in an agricultural frontier in Campeche. We carried out qualitative research with 94 ejidatarios, 92 pobladores and 13 government officials. Our research shows that the reforms cemented the second-class status of pobladores, as their access to land, natural resources such as firewood and governmental subsidies is now even more contested. Ejidal residents have responded to these tensions by invoking various conceptions of citizenship to press for different forms of justice. Ejidatarios seek to enforce their legal prerogatives by advocating a tiered citizenship, inflected with aspects of 'market citizenship', in which pobladores have less access to resources and voice. Pobladores seek inclusion in the ejido via a cultural model of citizenship built around a 'civil sociality'. Despite this generalization, both groups also selectively move between and combine these citizenship frameworks to advance their claims."
