If you would like this newsletter delivered to your inbox, sign up at the bottom of our Blogs page. Thank you for joining the conversation on how to promote higher impact from carbon markets – including improving GHG integrity and SDG contributions.\n\nHave you ever wondered how Calyx Global approaches its rating process? We have a series of explainers to help answer that question. Read the overview of our approach here and dive into the details with our explainer series.\n\nOver the past couple of weeks two competing reports emerged: One was a study in Science (by West et al.) on REDD baselines that found many are overestimating their emission reduction claims. Another was put forward by Everland, stating that such claims are robust – perhaps even conservative. The two conclusions were diametrically opposed, leaving many buyers of carbon credits confused about what to believe.\n\nHaving one rating for all credits produced over the lifetime of a project does not acknowledge that some of the project's credits have the potential to be more or less impactful. To recognize this variability, Calyx Global is introducing ratings by vintage. Our ratings by vintage approach provides vintage-specific ratings for projects based on the year the credits were produced rather than having one rating for the entire life of the project.\n\nCalyx Global rates projects across two separate frameworks: greenhouse gas (GHG) integrity and impacts towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We compared the rating distribution across these two frameworks and considered the following questions: (1) Is there a correlation between GHG integrity and SDG impact? (2) Are some project types more likely to deliver higher SDG impacts?\n\nWe’ve been working hard behind the scenes to develop an experience that makes finding and learning about project quality easier and more intuitive. Keep an eye out for an announcement with more details on the launch soon!\n\nWe will be hosting a breakfast In partnership with oneshot.earth at Climate Week where we will discuss how to manage legacy credits. If you're Interested in attending the breakfast or an in-person meeting with the team, let us know.\n\nCo-founders Donna Lee, Duncan van Bergen and more of the team will be in attendance at Verge. If you are attending, we would love to connect while on site. Let us know by sending us a message at info@calyxglobal.com.\n\nWe serve to guide the carbon markets to reach their highest potential. Along the way we aim to disperse digestible information on complex topics and join conversations about best practices. Remember to visit our blog and resources pages and get in touch to explore how we could help your business have more impact and mitigate risk in carbon markets."
