        "meta_description": "A recent molecular phylogenetic analysis identified a clade containing all species of Conostegia, but that also included species of Clidemia and Miconia nested inside. A taxonomic revision of a more broadly circumscribed Conostegia is presented here. In total, 77 species of Conostegia are recognized. One species from Ecuador, C. ortizae is described as new. Twenty-nine new combinations are proposed for the species of Clidemia and Miconia that fall inside Conostegia. Two new names are proposed for the two species for which the epithet was previously occupied in Conostegia. An infrageneric classification of Conostegia is proposed recognizing three sections based on the results of the molecular phylogeny. This taxonomic revision includes ample documentation of the anatomy and morphology of most species in the genus, taxonomic descriptions, a dichotomous key, and distribution maps for all species.",

        "text": "The most recent hypothesis of relationships in Conostegia based on DNA sequences from four chloroplast and two nuclear ribosomal regions, resolved the genus as paraphyletic with species of Clidemia and Miconia nested inside (Kriebel et al. 2015). Nonetheless, all species of Conostegia fall in a major clade regardless of the type of analysis conducted (concatentation vs. concordance). A summary of the relationships within Conostegia based on the hypothesis derived from the concatenated analysis is presented in Figure 1. These results also show the paraphyly of Schnell’s (1996) subgenus Conostegia since the species of his subgenus Lobatostigma form a clade nested inside of it. With respect to Schnell’s sectional classification of subgenus Conostegia his groups are not monophyletic except sections Parvistigma and Tomentostegia. For this reason, the subgeneric classification adopted here includes only sections corresponding to the three major clades in Conostegia identified by both concatentation and concordance analyses and proposed as Conostegia sections Australis, Conostegia, and Geniculatae, respectively (Fig. 1). Section Australis has calyptrate calyces that break at one side, abundant sclereids in the hypanthium, mucilage in the ovary, exserted styles, lack of filament geniculation, and all but one species sampled lack a vascular cylinder in the style. Even then, the cylinder in Conostegia ortizae has a single vascular bundle (unlike species in section Conostegia which have more). Species in section Conostegia are almost unique within the genus in that their styles are not exserted (flowers not herkogamous). This short style is only shared with some populations of C. monteleagreana in section Australis and the clade composed of C. osaensis, C. plumosa, C. speciosa, C. subcrustulata and C. xalapensis within section Geniculatae. An additional character almost unique to section Conostegia and not shared with any of the latter short-styled taxa is the presence of a vascular cylinder within the style. Additional characteristics of section Conostegia include the abundant sclereids in the hypanthium and presence of ovary mucilage (shared with section Australis). Based on anatomy and morphology, section Australis and section Conostegia are quite similar. These two sections also share the frequent pleiostemonous condition and the lack of an evident filament geniculation. The two groups differ in that species of section Conostegia do not have exserted styles, and all have vascular cylinders in the style whereas species of section Australis have exserted style and all but one species lack the vascular cylinder in the style. Lastly, many species in section Australis have an “anther shoulder” that species of section Conostegia lack. Section Geniculatae can be recognized by the lack of calyptra in most of its species. Only the following taxa have a calyptra: C. cinnamomea, C. osaensis, C. plumosa, C. speciosa, C. subcrustulata, and C. xalapensis. The calyptra of these species differs from those of the other two sections in that they lack sclereids. Additional characteristics of section Geniculatae include the filament geniculation, the exserted style (in most of its species), small flower size, diplostemonous flowers of most of its species, and the frequently papillose seed testa. Lastly, it is noteworthy that many of the species in this section have leaves that are strongly plinerved and frequently asymmetric. Also, see the Biogeography section for remarks on the marked geographical patterns at the sectional level.\n\nOf the three main clades (sections) of Conostegia, the smallest one, Australis, is noticeable for its species being primarily South American, i.e., C. apiculata, C. centronioides, C. dentata, C. extinctoria, C. lancifolia, C. ortizae and C. rubiginosa. This is almost the only clade to contain species endemic to South America except for C. ecuadorensis and C. foreroi of section Geniculatae. Other species of section Australis (e.g. C. lasiopoda and C. tenuifolia) reach southern Central America and are common in that region, but none of the species in section Australis ranges beyond Nicaragua and none are present in the Caribbean. The only species of section Australis to reach an oceanic island is C. lasiopoda, which occurs on Cocos Island in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nSection Conostegia is mostly restricted to Central America and the Caribbean. Roughly speaking there are three distinct areas where endemic species of this section occur. The area with the most endemics is southern Central America (Costa Rica and Panama). The mountains in these two countries include the volcanic ranges in Costa Rica and the Talamanca mountains that start in Costa Rica and end in Panama, harboring endemics such as C. bigibbosa, C. chiriquensis, C. fragrantissima, C. macrantha, C. micrantha, C. muriculata, C. oerstediana, C. pittieri, C. rhodopetala, and C. vulcanicola. Some of these species reach their northernmost distribution on volcanoes of Nicaragua and some also reach the lowlands of these three countries. The second area of endemism for species of section Conostegia is in northern Central America, both in the mountains of southern Mexico as well as in some lower-elevation and drier valleys. Some of these northernmost endemics include C. arborea, C. caelestis, and C. jaliscana. Lastly the third area of endemism, which could potentially be divided into two, are the Caribbean islands of Hispaniola and Cuba (where the endemic C. lindenii grows), and the island of Jamaica where three endemics occur (C. balbisiana, C. procera, and C. pyxidata).\n\nSection Geniculatae stands out biogeographically because most of its species (80%) are endemic to the southern Central American countries of Costa Rica and Panama. The rest of the species occur in northern Central America with endemics of that area including C. fulvostellata, C. oligocephala, and C. plumosa. Other species of section Geniculatae (e.g. C. speciosa, C. subcrustulata, and C. xalapensis) are more-or-less widespread in Central America reaching South America. Just like in section Australis, only one species of section Geniculatae (i.e., C. ombrophila) reaches an oceanic island, i.e. Cocos Island in the Pacific.\n\nOngoing work in the tribe Miconieae to obtain a dated phylogeny will provide a time calibrated hypothesis that will enable a thorough biogeographical analysis of Conostegia.\n\nThirty leaves of 26 species within Conostegia were collected in the field, fixed in FAA, and then sectioned as explained above. Leaves of all Conostegia studied are hypostomatic. The cuticle is generally inconspicuous but sometimes can be relatively thick as in C. rhodopetala (Fig. 15). The mesophyll is dorsiventral (Figs 15, 16), and druses were present in all species, usually near the adaxial or abaxial leaf epidermis. The size of the druses varies. Some species such C. tenuifolia have more space in the mesophyll. Leaf thickness varied but in general leaves were thinner in section Geniculatae (Fig. 17). At least two types of coriaceous leaves were found. Populations of C. montana from Cerro Jefe, Panama, have a very thick mesophyll and are the most evidently coriaceous leaves encountered in this survey. The other thick-leaved species were found to have a hypodermis one cell layer thick. This hypodermis is found only in C. montelagreana in section Australis and in the species of the giant stigma clade (species sampled were C. bigibbosa, C. icosandra, C. oerstediana, and C. pittieri) where it appears to have evolved in their common ancestor (Fig. 15). Mentink and Baas (1992) reported the presence of a hypodermis in C. subcructulata but sections done for this study failed to locate a hypodermis in that this species (Fig. 16). In the Melastomataceae the function of the hypodermis has been suggested to be related to water storage in epiphytic species (Reginato et al. 2009) or protecting the palisade parenchyma against solar radiation in terrestrial species (Ely et al. 2005). The spongy mesophyll was usually not lignified except in some species, such as C. ombrophila and C. schlimii.\n\nThe petioles in Conostegia bigibbosa and some Costa Rican and Guatemalan populations of C. montana have two protuberances at the apex of the petiole on the abaxial surface. Scanning electron micrographs of these protuberances evidenced a glabrous area with some stomata suggesting that they might be extrafloral nectaries. However, anatomical sections in C. bigibbosa did not indicate the presence of carbohydrates. Cross sections of petioles show variation in shape from rounded to somewhat heart shaped, grooved or flat adaxially as in C. consimilis, C. schlimii, C. tenuifolia, and C. bernoulliana (Fig. 16). Five to nine amphicribal bundles are present, forming an interrupted arc. The lowermost bundles tend to be larger as in C. rufescens, C. subcrustulata and C. schlimii, (Fig. 16). Smaller bundles are sometimes present inside the primary arc as in C. bernoulliana, C. bracteata, C. rufescens, and C. tenuifolia (Fig. 16). Petioles are mostly unlignified but sclereids are present in some species, but besides the sclereids, petioles were mostly unlignified. Some lignification of the petiole was observed in C. rufescens and C. schlimii.\n\nTrichomes in Conostegia are quite diverse and variable (Fig. 19). This may not come as a surprise since trichomes in the Melastomataceae have been said to be the most diverse in the angiosperms (Wurdack 1986). In many cases trichome morphology is easy to describe, such as with simple or lepidote trichomes. Difficulty in describing trichomes arises with the vast variation in dendritic trichomes, and with the gradations from dendritic to stellate. Wurdack (1986) noted that all types in the family are multicellular and, of the 46 trichomes types he recognized, 14 were recorded in species of Conostegia sensu Schnell (1996). Schnell (1996) discussed trichomes in Conostegia extensively noting that Conostegia species tend to have a mixture of trichomes and that variation within a species is extensive. I have noted extreme variation in C. icosandra, which can be densely hirsute in the northern part of its range. Conostegia superba has also caused confusion because in the mainland specimens tend to be glabrous or almost so, but in the Dominican Republic they can be quite pubescent except for the floral buds. As noted by Schnell (1996), and even now taking the phylogeny into account, it is evident that similar trichomes have evolved independently within Conostegia. One example involves the interdependent evolution of stipitate trichomes of C. brenesii and C. caelestis. Schnell (1996) divided the trichomes of Conostegia into the three general groups recognizable based on the work on Wurdack (1986): 1) tiny glands, 2) elongate simple hairs, and 3) a series of eight potentially intergrading kinds of stellate and branching hairs. Schnell (1996) stated that continuous variation among these eight groups made it difficult to describe them. I agree with Schnell and recommend that into the future, a quantitative method should be developed to describe and perhaps discretize these complicated dendritic to stellate trichomes. In the meantime, I have chosen to document the trichomes in a similar way as Wurdack (1986) did, with extensive Scanning Electron Micrographs (Figs 20–33). Apparently all taxa have minute glands on the abaxial leaf surface, and their shape is variable and may prove to be taxonomically informative. Their small size makes them difficult to describe, especially in species with dense pubescence on the leaf abaxial surfaces. To compliment Wurdack’s (1986) initiative for Conostegia, I placed special attention on documenting these minute glands as much as possible.\n\nAll species with discolorous leaves are in section Geniculatae. However, this character has evolved independently a number of times within the section and not all discolorous leaves are the result of the same type of trichome. In some cases such as C. xalapensis the dense indument on the abaxial surface is made up of stellate trichomes with long, thin arms, whereas in closely related C. osaensis they are lepidote. Many species in section Geniculatae have an orange-colored indument of dendritic to stellate trichomes on the stems, especially towards the apex, which are less common in the other sections or if present do not tend not to form a conspicuous orange covering.\n\nInflorescences in Conostegia are variable among species as in most clades of Miconieae (Michelangeli et al. 2004). Most species have terminal erect panicles with many flowers, but the inflorescence can be deflexed. In some species previously described in Miconia as well as in some species traditionally placed in Conostegia such as C. cinnamomea and C. muriculata, the inflorescence can be evidently deflexed. Axillary or pseudolateral inflorescences tend to have fewer, smaller flowers and are present mainly in those taxa previously described in Clidemia. Some small-flowered taxa do have many flowers such as C. consimilis. Bracts are usually early deciduous in sections Australis and sections Conostegia except in species such as C. monteleagreana which has persistent bracts subtending the floral glomerules. On the other hand, many species in section Geniculatae have bracts and bracteoles that are persistent and fused at the base, forming an inconspicuous nodal collar. Inflorescence branches are particularly thin, wiry, and delicate in several species within section Geniculatae such as C. cinnamomea, C. grayumii, and C. ombrophila. It was the presence of this type of inflorescence, as well as the similar bracteoles amongst other characters that prompted Schnell (1996) to state that the similarities between C. cinnamomea and C. brenesiana are “little short of uncanny, involving almost every character, even to minute details”.\n\nAccessory branches in inflorescences are common in Conostegia, especially in taxa with relatively long terminal inflorescences. Although it is tempting to use the presence of these accessory branches in the systematics of the group, they are absent in some specimens, and in such cases it is difficult to tell if they fell off or were not there to begin with. Accessory branches are consistently absent in most species of section Geniculatae\n\nPedicels in Conostegia are also variable among species and major clades. In particular, species within section Conostegia can have quite long pedicels, as previously noted by Judd and Skean (1991). These pedicels can further elongate as the flowers develop into fruits. Pedicels are absent (flowers sessile) in some species such as C. monteleagreana in section Australis and C. colliculosa and C. povedae in section Geniculatae. Schnell (1996) noted that in certain species the pedicels are clustered at the end of the inflorescence branches. This clustering is such that the pedicels appear to arise from the axils of other pedicels hence naming these taxa in his section Axilliflora Schnell -ined (see figure of C. superba for an example). Species in this section do not form a clade as evidenced by the molecular phylogeny where C. monteleagreana falls in a different clade than C. cuatrecasii, C. rhodopetala, and C. superba (Fig. 1; see also Kriebel et al. 2015). Nonetheless, Schnell (1996) himself noted that the species of section Axilliflora did not sort out into clear groups.\n\nFloral buds in calyptrate species of Conostegia are noticeable because of their calyx tends to fall as a unit at anthesis. Calyptrate calyces have arisen independently at least 15 times just in the Neotropical genera of the family and can be variously shaped (Fig. 34) (Schnell 1996). In the Miconieae, five genera have at least some species with a calyptra namely: Conostegia, Mecranium, Miconia, Tetrazygia and Tococa (Schnell 1996). Schnell (1996) considered floral buds to be the most useful structures not only to identify species at the generic level but also within Conostegia. In general terms their size and shape can be taxonomically useful, as well as the presence of warts or different types of indument on the hypanthium. The apex of the buds can also be helpful for identifying some species. An apiculate calyptra for example, is present in several distinct species from different geographical areas. In South America, the aptly named C. apiculata is readily distinguished. In northern Central America, the distinctively apiculate calyptra of C. arborea is not easily confused with others; the same is true of C. pittieri in the mountains of Costa Rica and western Panama, but in this area there are other species that can have somewhat apiculate calyptras (e.g. C. tenuifolia and C. rhodopetala).\n\nPhylogenetic and anatomical analyses have revealed that the calyptra evolved at least three times within Conostegia (Kriebel et al. 2015). This is a surprise because most workers previously thought the calyptrate calyx was shared by all species in the genus (Judd and Skean 1991; Schnell 1996) even referring to Conostegia as monophyletic without phylogenetic analyses of any kind (Judd and Skean 1991). Schnell (1996) did point to the possibility of the independent origin of the calyptra in C. cinnamomea, and stated that because these structures had evolved in the family there was possibly a selective force driving their evolution. The adaptive value of the calyptra remains unknown.\n\nThe calyptra of species in sections Australis and Conostegia are very similar in that they have conspicuous sclereids and no calyx teeth nor appendages (Fig. 35). The sclereids for the most part form a layer or two throughout the hypanthium and calyptra (Fig. 36). The main difference in the calyptra of these two sections is that in section Australis, the calyptra ruptures at one side and/or breaks into pieces in all species observed in the field (Fig. 37). In section Conostegia all evidence points to a cleanly circumscissle calyptra which Judd and Skean (1991) and Schnell (1996) believed was the case in all species of Conostegia. Independent origins of the calyptra are also seen in C. cinnamomea, which has a very thin calyptra, and in the clade comprised of C. osaensis, C. plumosa, C. speciosa, C. subcrustulata, and C. xalapensis. The calyptra in this latter clade lacks evident sclereids (Fig. 35). Although most species have a glabrous calyptra on the inside, three closely related species, i.e. C. plumosa, C. speciosa and C. xalapensis tend to have stellate trichomes inside the calyptra.\n\nWithin section Geniculatae, sclereids are mostly absent from the hypanthium and calyx. Some scattered sclereids are seen in the hypanthium of C. schlimii. In the floral anatomy of this section there are two general patterns that are absent in sections Australis and Conostegia. First, in several species of Geniculatae there is a lining of druses around the ovary (Fig. 38). Second, several species have a distinctly bicolored anatomy where the ovary tissue stains red, indicating some lignification but the rest of the hypanthium stains blue. In fewer specimens of section Geniculatae the hypanthium stains either totally red or entirely blue. For further anatomical differences between the ovaries in section Geniculatae and the other two sections Australis and Conostegia, see below under the Gynoecium section.\n\nAnother unusual characteristic of the calyx of non-calyptrate species in section Geniculatae is the presence of an irregularly rupturing calyx in several of them (Fig. 39). This type of calyx is usually translucent. An example of the anatomy of the translucent calyx of C. friedmaniorum is presented next to the calyx of C. schlimii (a species without a translucent calyx) (Fig. 35). In all cases of species with this type of calyx, because it ruptures, the calyx lobes are irregularly shaped. The calyx teeth in calyptrate taxa are difficult to assess. In sections Australis and most calyptrate species of Geniculatae they appear to be totally absent and anatomical sections failed to reveal them. In C. cinnamomea, anatomical sections did evidence their presence. On the other hand, within the clade of C. osaensis, C. plumosa, C. speciosa, C. subcrustulata, and C. xalapensis one sees what seem to be inconspicuous calyx teeth in C. subcrustulata. Schnell (1996) included the aforementioned clade (except C. osaensis which was undescribed at the time) in his section Tomentostegia. In his description of that section, Schnell (1996) described the calyx lobes as fused and usually with free teeth or prolonged appendages. Assessing if these teeth or appendages are homologous to calyx teeth is difficult. To complicate things even more, in C. osaensis, which is the sister clade, the calyx teeth appear to be at the level of the torus as is common in species of section Geniculatae and more generally in most species of the tribe Miconieae.\n\nFlowers in the species traditionally treated in Conostegia also stand out among genera of Miconieae because most of them are pleiostemonous, meaning that they have more than double the number of stamens than petals (Fig. 40). Other pleiostemonous taxa do exist within the Miconieae, but they are not thought to be closely related to Conostegia. There is one pleiostemonous species that has been named in Conostegia, C. inusitata, which appears not to be closely related to the other named taxa in the genus. This suggestion comes from a nuclear ribosomal DNA sequence (Kriebel, unpublished data) of an undescribed and closely related species to C. inusitata, which Schnell (1996) proposed as the new species Florbella wurdackii. The genus Florbella was proposed by Schnell to accommodate these two species, but it has yet to be published. Inclusion of this DNA sequence in phylogenetic analyses of Miconieae suggests it is more closely related to a clade of mostly Peruvian species of Miconia than to species of Conostegia. The concept of Conostegia included in the present treatment includes many diplostemonous species, particularly those previously described as Clidemia and Miconia. These diplostemonous taxa are almost completely restricted to section Geniculatae (Fig. 41), with a few diplostemonous taxa also found in section Conostegia (e.g. C. setosa).\n\nThe androecium in Conostegia consists of 8–52 isomorphic stamens. The basic arrangement of the stamens consists of five of them inserted opposite the sepals and five of them opposite the petals like most species in the Melastomataceae. Increase in the number of stamens are common, even predominant in sections Australis and Conostegia. These increases result in pleiostemony, and were the subject of a recent floral developmental study (Puglisi 2007; Wanntorp et al. 2011) which found two ways in which Conostegia species increase in stamen number: 1) by having a large stamen in alternipetalous position with small ones in antipetalous position; or 2) by a process called dedoublement where the stamens split in two (Puglisi 2007; Wanntorp et al. 2011). There appears to be no clear pattern indicating evolutionary relationships, with taxa with either of these developmental pathways being more closely related to another with the opposite pathway.\n\nThe posture of the stamens can go from erect, to forming a more or less a 45-degree angle between the filament and the anther (Fig. 47). Species with stamens that form an angle tend to have at least slightly bilaterally symmetric androecia. This condition is common in sections Australis and Conostegia as well as in the clade composed of C. osaensis, C. plumosa, C. speciosa, C. subcrustulata, and C. xalapensis within section Geniculatae. Bilateral symmetry in Conostegia appears also to be related to interactions between the stamen and style during development at least partly the result of the increase in number of stamens. Species in section Geniculatae, excluding the clade mentioned above, have stamens that cleanly surround the style and are radially symmetric, yet the flowers of these species might still have slight bilateral symmetry as a result of a gently curving style. In at least two species, C. fragrantissima and C. pittieri, the stamens are bent away and opposite the style.\n\nThe filaments are mostly white to translucent. Sections Australis and Conostegia lack a clear geniculation towards the apex of the filament, whereas in section Geniculatae the geniculation is present in almost every species, except perhaps in C. fraterna (Figs 47–49). It is significant that the molecular phylogeny of Kriebel et al. (2015) placed species traditionally recognized in Conostegia such as C. plumosa, C. speciosa, C. subcrustulata and C. xalapensis in Geniculatae and that the latter three species which were studied from field-collected floral material have an evident filament geniculation. This morphological character thus supports their placement within section Geniculatae. It has to be considered that some variation does exist. For example, the micrograph of C. xalapensis (Fig. 49) does not show the evident geniculation very well whereas the photographs of the pickled stereoscope images of the same specimen do. In general, C. xalapensis shows an evident geniculation. Although most species which have filament geniculations present them towards the apex of the filament, in one species, C. brenesiana, the geniculation is in the middle of the filament.\n\nAnthers in Conostegia are almost exclusively yellow to sometimes orange (i.e. C. fragrantissima) with some taxa having hues of pink towards the apex in some populations (i.e. C. rufescens). In some species particularly in section Australis the anthers can be cream colored. Anthers in Conostegia lack evident staminal appendages with at the most, some species (e.i., C. bernoulliana) having an inconspicuous dorsal bump on the anther connective. The only structure that resembles an anther appendage in Conostegia is present in most species of section Australis. In these taxa, the anther base is briefly prolonged below the junction of the filament and anther thecae (Fig. 50). This character was recently documented in some species of Tococa (Michelangeli 2005) and Pachyanthus (Bécquer 2008). The documentation of this type of anther base in Conostegia is relevant because it had not been used before in the systematics of the group, and although lost in some species, helps to identify species in section Australis.\n\nAnther shape in Conostegia varies a lot even when considering only the species treated traditionally in the genus. This is in contrast to what has been previously stated in the literature. In their taxonomic studies of the Miconieae, Judd and Skean (1991) remarked that the non-appendaged anthers characteristic of Conostegia are ovoid, tapered to the apex, and open by a small apical pore. These anther characters lead to conclude that the genus did not evolve from within Miconia, since members of the latter genus show various modifications of either pore or connective structure. We now know that Conostegia is phylogenetically nested within the Miconieae, and furthermore that anthers of its species can be ovoid, oblong, linear, or variations on these shapes (Schnell 1996; Fig. 49). They are definitely not all ovoid. Also, they can be recurved or arcuate making them diffciult to describe. In addition, it is not very useful to say that a small pore characterizes the anthers of Conostegia. In fact, most species of Miconieae have small anther pores corresponding to their buzz pollinated syndrome, and for this reason this type of pore was coded as plesiomorphic by Judd and Skean (1991). Even if the size of the pore proves useful in the systematics of Conostegia, continuous measurements would have to be employed to determine their utility. The shape of the anther apices and anther pores is quite variable in Conostegia and merits further research. This will require careful placement of critically point dried anther apices on stubs and Scanning Electron Microscopy. Some of the variation seen in the pores has to do with the deeply channeled anthers in the ventral surface. In some taxa this deep channel reaches the pore area but in others it does not. Conostegia brenesiana stands out because of its very small anther thecae with broad pores which can resemble anthers in Miconia section Cremanium. In most species the pores are terminal to ventrally inclined. Dorsally inclined pores can be found in some species of section Geniculatae, and are especially evident in C. cinnamomea (Figs 50, 51).\n\nWith respect to the anatomy of the anthers, the sporangia in each anther theca were found to have two general arrangements. In species of section Australis and Conostegia they tend to be positioned side by side. On the contrary, in section Geniculatae they tend to be more-or-less superposed. All anthers were found to have druses. In some species such as Conostegia lasiopoda and C. oerstediana, the druses are present in the staminal connective, endothecium and anther septum (Fig. 52). In others, they are mostly restricted to the septum like in C. tenuifolia. Species in section Geniculatae tend to have druses on the proximal half of the outer side of the anthers (as in C. fraterna, C. friedmaniorum, C. ombrophila, and C. subcrustulata) (Fig. 52).\n\nPollen of species in the Melastomataceae has been rarely documented in taxonomic treatments. This may be because the few studies that have been done have revealed little variation (reviewed in Renner 1993). For the species studied, Renner (1993) summarized the pollen as small, tricolporate, radially symmetrical, and isopolar; occasionally grains may have 4, 5 or more colpi, and some grains are dicolporate or heteropolar. Faint to distinct pseudocolpi (or subsidiary colpi, in the terminology of Patel et al. 1984) are usually present. The surface sculpture is smooth and striate to rugulate or rugulate-verrucate. Polyads and tetrads are known from Tococa spadiciflora and Miconia melanotricha (Patel et al. 1984). In the case of Conostegia, Roubik and Moreno (1991) provided the only images known to me of the anatomy of pollen of Conostegia species (including C. shattuckii as Miconia shattuckii). I have found that the pollen characteristics of Conostegia agree with Renner’s (1993) general description for the family; this is shown in micrographs provided for several species (Fig. 53).\n\nThe gynoecium can have from 4 to 25 carpels (Schnell 1996). Placentation is axillary as in most Melastomataceae (Renner 1993). The placenta in most Conostegia protrudes into the locule, either in laminar fashion with the ovules attached at the sides, or it is peltate with a clear stipe (Fig. 54). Intermediates are present, and in a few cases (e.g. C. xalapensis), the placenta looks like the peltate kind but lacks a clear stipe. Species of sections Australis and Conostegia have inferior ovaries, and in some species of section Conostegia the ovary can be elevated into an evident collar around the style base. Species in these two sections all have glabrous ovary apices. In contrast, species of section Geniculatae tend to have ovaries about two thirds inferior and several species have glandular-pubescent ovary apices. A collar around the style base is usually absent in section Geniculatae. Species of sections Australis and Conostegia have a glabrous torus whereas species in section Geniculatae can have a glabrous or glandular-puberulent torus. In one species, C. osaensis, the torus is beset with lepidote trichomes.\n\nA significant discovery of this study is the deep blue stain recorded in anatomical sections inside the ovary of species in sections Australis and Conostegia (Fig. 36). On the other hand, this staining is absent in section Geniculatae. Staining with Ruthenium red has provided evidence that the substance in question is mucilaginous pectin, and field tests and photographs by Reinaldo Aguilar of with C. bernoulliana in the Osa Peninsula have demonstrated that the berries are sticky as would be expected from the presence of mucilage.\n\nConostegia can be said to have the highest diversity in style and stigma morphology in the whole Melastomataceae (Fig. 55). Most notable is the presence of crateriform lobed stigmas in several species (Figs 55, 56). These crateriform stigmas are unique to a subclade of Conostegia, although in some species the crater is reduced to almost absent but the lobes mostly remain present. Besides these obvious outliers, the diversity is still pronounced, ranging from short, stout, straight or apically hooked styles, to long, straight or gently curving styles. Stigmas can be punctiform, truncate, or variously enlarged (Fig. 55). Styles in Conostegia can be exserted or not. Biologically, this exertion corresponds to the maintenance of herkogamy (see Reproductive Biology section). Although the posture of the style appears to be taxonomically informative, this posture can vary through time within the same individual in some species. In species with exserted styles, two general trends are noticeable. The first trend, seen in species of section Australis as well as C. schlimii of section Geniculatae, is one in which the flower is either facing upward, or horizontally and thus the style is erect or horizontal. In both these similar postures, the style tends to surve gently towards the apex resulting in a more or less S shape. The other trend in species with exserted styles is almost the norm in species of section Geniculatae and involves deflexed styles. It should be noted that in this revision, exemplary flowers of all sections are presented in erect position for convenience (see Figs 40 through 43), but in the taxonomic treatment, images of live flowering plants display the natural posture of the flowers.\n\nThere are two main clades where the style is not exserted beyond the stamens (not herkogamous). The first corresponds to section Conostegia and the other to the clade comprised of C. osaensis, C. plumosa, C. speciosa, C. subcrustulata, and C. xalapensis. Aside from the crateriform and or lobed stigma clade, which are derived from section Conostegia, all remaining taxa with a short style appear to have either a straight style or one that bends upward below the stigma. Within section Conostegia, style posture appears to change in most of its members, particularly in the crateriform or lobed stigma clade. The few observations of species in this group (Stratton 1989; Schnell 1996) suggest their flowers can last about two days. During this time the style bends downward usually blocking numerous stamens. Preliminary experiments (Kriebel unpublished data) show that if the style is removed, the stamens can unveil normally and that if the stamens are removed the style still bends (see photographs in section on Reproductive biology).\n\nIn the styles of the Conostegia clade, another outstanding aspect involves the presence of a stele within for their entire length (Figs 57, 58). Specifically, section Conostegia and convergently Conostegia ortizae in section Australis present this phenomenon. This stele is unknown in the rest of the Melastomataceae. Schnell (1996) was the first to document the stele in two species which are phenotypically divergent but belong to section Conostegia. This character is helpful to confirm the hypothesis, derived by optimizing morphological traits on the molecular phylogeny, that the calyptra and short style seen in the clade composed of C. osaensis, C. plumosa, C. speciosa, C. subcrustulata, and C. xalapensis must have evolved independently from the similar morphology seen in section Conostegia. No species including the ones just mentioned of section Geniculatae were found to have a vascular cylinder inside the style. These results also coincide with Schnell’s (1996) observations of a lack of a cylinder in C. subcrustulata. The stele found in the style of C. ortizae, in general, differs from those in species of section Conostegia because it has fewer vascular traces.\n\nConostegia acuminata Steud., Flora 27(2): 722. 1844. This is the basionym for Miconia acuminata (Steud.) Naudin, Ann. Sci. Nat., Bot., Ser. 3 16: 244 (1850). The latter is the currently accepted name (Goldenberg et al. 2013).\n\nConostegia cornifolia (Desr.) Ser. ex DC., Prodr. 3: 175. 1828. Based on Melastoma cornifolium Desr., Encycl. Méth. Bot. 4: 51 (1797). This name was treated in Cogniaux’s (1891) monograph as a synonym of Miconia cinnamomifolia (Jacq.) Triana, an illegitimate name i.e. a later homonym of M. cinnamomifolia (DC.) Naudin. The currently accepted name is Miconia cornifolia (Desr.) Naudin (Goldenberg et al. 2013).\n\nConostegia cucullata D. Don ex DC., Prodr. 3: 176. 1828. Based on Melastoma cucullata Pavon Msc. ex D. Don. This name appears in Cogniaux’s (1891) monograph as a synonym of Calyptrella cucullata Triana, but in Triana’s (1872) monograph there is no description. The first valid publication of the name Calyptrella cucullata would seem to be in Cogn., Mart. Fl. Bras. 14(4): 44. 1886. This name is currently treated as a synonym of Graffenrieda cucullata (Triana ex Cogn.) L.O.Williams, Fieldiana, Bot. 29: 563 (1963).\n\nConostegia discolor DC., Prodr. 3: 174. 1828. This name was treated in Cogniaux’s (1891) monograph as a synonym of Charianthus coccineus (Rich.) D. Don, and the latter is currently considered as a synonym of Charianthus alpinus (Sw.) R.A. Howard (Penneys and Judd 2005).\n\nConostegia excelsa Pittier, J. Wash. Acad. Sci. 14: 450. 1924. This name is a synonym of Meriania macrophylla (Benth.) Triana (Almeda 1993).\n\nConostegia glabra (G. Forst.) D. Don ex DC. Prodr. 3: 176. 1828. Based on Melastoma glabrum G. Forst., Prodr. : 34 (1786). The currently accepted name for this species is Astronidium glabrum (G.Forst.) Markgr., Notizbl. Bot. Gart. Berlin-Dahlem 12: 50 (1934).\n\nConostegia gloriosa Macfad., Fl. Jamaica 2: 68. 1850. Invalid name and possibly a taxonomic synonym of C. procera (Sw.) D. Don ex DC.\n\nConostegia holosericea D. Don ex DC., Prodr. 3: 176. 1828. Nomen nudum.\n\nConostegia inusitata Wurdack, Phytologia 16: 170. 1968. Based on preliminary nrETS a relative of this species, the undescribed Florbella wurdackii, is more closely related to a clade of species of Miconia from Peru.\n\nConostegia lanceolata f. grandifolia Cogn, Prim. Fl. C.R. 1: 156. 1892 (fide Stafleu and Cowan 1976, p. 709). Nomen nudum.\n\nConostegia lutescens (Vahl) Ser. ex DC., Prodr. 3: 175. 1828. Based on Melastoma lutescens Vahl, Eclog. Amer. 3: 17 (1807). This name is a synonym of Miconia cornifolia (Desr.) Naudin (Goldenberg et al. 2013).\n\nConostegia mexicana (Bonpl.) Ser. ex DC is a synonym of Miconia mexicana (Bonpl.) Naudin (Goldenberg et al. 2013) as verified by the description and plate provided by Bonpland in his description of Melastoma mexicanum Bonpl. The description of Conostegia mexicana Cogn. matches that of C. icosandra, as does the lectotype Galeotti 2963 (BR) where it was placed in synonymy in this work. The specimen Galeotti 2963 was cited by Cogniaux (1891) under Miconia mexicana (Bonpl.) Naudin possibly by mistake.\n\nConostegia mutisii (Bonpl.) Ser. ex DC., Prodr. 3: 174. 1828. Based on Melastoma mutisii Bonpl., Monogr. Melast., 136. 1816. This currently recognized name for this species is Meriania mutisii (Bonpl.) Humberto Mend. & Fern-Alonso.\n\nConostegia myriasporoides Triana. Trans. Linn. Soc. London 28(1): 99. 1872. Schnell (1996) suggested to move this species to Cyphostyla Gleason, but this genus is now a synonym of Allomaieta. Both of these genera belong to a different tribe than Conostegia, the capsular fruited Cyphostyleae.\n\nConostegia orbeliana Almeda, Proc. Cal. Acad. Sci. 46: 333. 1990. The identity of this species is hard to confirm. It was put in the synonymy of C. volcanalis by Schnell, a species otherwise restricted to mostly north of Nicaragua. As recognized by Schnell (1996), the Panamanian specimens described as C. orbeliana differ in their smaller leaves and petioles, larger flowers and different flowering time, details of the pubescence, and anther morphology. It seems that enough differences are found between these populations to cast doubt as if they represent the same species. The problem arises in that in the southern Central American mountains other similar species to these also grow. For example, C. oerstediana and C. macrantha. Thus it seems reasonable to wait for more material of what has been described as C. orbeliana to confirm their differences.\n\nConostegia parviflora (Aubl.) DC., Prodr. 3: 175. 1828. Based on Melastoma parviflorum Aubl., Hist. Pl. Guiane 1: 433; t. 171 (1775). This name is currently treated as a taxonomic synonym of Miconia prasina (Sw.) DC. (Goldenberg et al. 2013).\n\nConostegia quadrangularis Steudel, Nomencl. ed. II 1: 405. 1841. Nomen nudum.\n\nConostegia semicrenata (Richard in Bonpl.) Ser. ex DC., Prodr. 3: 175. 1828. Based on Melastoma semicrenatum Richard in Bonpl., Monogr. Melast. : 69; t. 31. (1809). This name is a synonym of Miconia cornifolia (Desr.) Naudin (Goldenberg et al. 2013).\n\nConostegia sub-hirsuta Gomez, Anal. Hist. Nat. Madrid 23: 69. 1894. No specimen was cited in the publication.\n\nConostegiatunicata (Bonpl.) Ser. DC., Prodr. 3: 175. 1828. Based on Melastoma semicrenatum Richard in Bonpl., Monogr. Melast. : 69; t. 31. (1809). This name is a synonym of Miconia tunicata (Bonpl.) Naudin (Goldenberg et al. 2013).\n\nConostegia xalapensis f. canescens Cogn. ex Donn. Sm, Enum. Pl. Guat. 2: 21. 1891. Nomen nudum.\n\nConostegia xalapensis f. parvifolia Cogn. ex Donn. Sm, Enum. Pl. Guat. 3: 28. 1893. Nomen nudum.\n\nConostegia viridis var. angustifolia Cogn. ex Donn. Sm, Bot. Gaz. 20: 286. 1895.
