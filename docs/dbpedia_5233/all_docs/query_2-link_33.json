Euglossa obrima is found in humid environments with specimens collected in lowland areas with tropical rain forest (Chimalapas, Oaxaca, Mexico), or at mid altitudes (as high as 1600 m) in cloud mountain forest (Tlanchinol, Hidalgo, Mexico). Although collecting records are scarce, beyond the Isthmus of Tehuantepec going north, the species is absent from the Mexican lowlands along the Pacific Ocean, with records only from the lowlands along the Gulf of Mexico. The distribution of Euglossa obrima is apparently disjunct to the known distribution of Euglossa villosa which is known only from a couple of localities in Panamá, although some specimens missing locality data, deposited in the Florida Museum of Natural History, University of Florida, USA, may be from Costa Rica (Mark Whitten, pers. comm. 2006).\n\nComments.\n\nThe males collected in Chalchijapa, Santa María Chimalapa, Oaxaca, Mexico as well as those from Tlanchinol, Hidalgo, Mexico, were captured using a mix of chemicals including eugenol and methyl salicylate. One male from Guatemala was captured in a flight intercept trap, while one female from San Juan, San Luis Potosi, Mexico was collected while visiting flowers of Bidens odorata Cavanilles ( Asteraceae ).\n\nEtymology."
