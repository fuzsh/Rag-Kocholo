This cache will take you to the site of one of Aurora's historic buildings, "The Masonic Temple" (also known as "Lincoln Manor"). This property closed down several years ago and is fenced off. As a result, hiding spots were limited so you'll be searching for a micro/nano. You will NOT need to enter the fenced-off area. Please be careful and stay out of the roadway. The following is a write-up taken from the internet describing the building's history.

"The Jerusalem Temple Lodge #90 Masonic body was formed in Aurora, Illinois in October 1850, only 13 years after the city was founded. The first Worshipful Master was Benjamin Franklin Hall, who later became the first mayor of Aurora in 1857. They first met in the Main Street Building until moving into a Masonic Hall on Fox Street in 1866. The order moved again in 1910 to Broadway Street.

The Masons quickly outgrew this building and desired to build a new temple to hold meetings at. The body boasted almost a thousand members at this point, and they were easily about to raise over $200,000 for a new structure. Construction began on November 28, 1921, and the six-story structure was opened on March 10, 1924. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 19, 1982. Sold by the lodge in the 1980s, the building was then used as a banquet facility and renamed Lincoln Manor. Since the closure of that facility in 2006, the building has suffered from deferred maintenance, resulting in water infiltration and damage to architectural features."

*Interesting fact to tie this cache together* Despite the building later being renamed "Lincoln Manor", President Abraham Lincoln was not a Freemason... but several U.S. Presidents were. These include George Washington James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, James Polk, James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, James Garfield, William McKinley, Theodore Roosevelt, Howard Taft, Warren Harding, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, and Gerald Ford.
