A major fire destroyed an historic Masonic temple in the Illinois city of Aurora last night, according to reports.

The fire Monday night tore through the abandoned Lincoln Masonic Temple and led to the closure of several streets, Patch.com reported.

The temple was built in 1922 and had since been listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the report noted.

The Daily Herald reported that firefighters operated defensively at the aging structure because of its state of decrepitude and the potential for collapse. The building was a total loss. Part of the building collapsed onto power lines, according to a report from ABC.

The local CBS affiliate reported that hundreds of residents were left without power. The fire in under investigation.
