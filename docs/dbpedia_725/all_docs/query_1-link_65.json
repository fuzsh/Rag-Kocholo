        "text": "The Bunny Bread neon sign features animated, wiggling bunny ears. It is about ten feet tall. The bakery building below was constructed in 1951 and the sign was most likely built at that time. Although bread production stopped many years ago, there was still a Bunny Bread thrift outlet in the building until 2010. Later that year, just after these photos were taken, the store closed and these signs were moved to the Bundy Museum of Baking Arts in Urbana, OH. The owner said the bunny sign and letters would be restored for about $40,000. By 2014, the bunny sign was on permanent display inside the private museum. The animated neon had been restored and the panels were repainted in the original colors of blue and yellow. The letters were also restored and put on display. They have been repainted yellow and orange. Bunny Bread is still produced and sold throughout the Midwest and South.\n\nBunny Bread built several other neon bunny signs over the years. The only other large sign was built for the plant in Marquette, MI which is now located at the Upper Peninsula Children's Museum.\n\nThe Anna Plaza Motel sign appeared to be from the 1950s. It was gone by 2023.\n\nThe Terrace Motel building and sign are from the 1950s. The beige portion of the sign was a later addition. This photo is from 2010. In 2011, the sign was badly damaged when it was knocked over by high winds. It has since been repaired. For more, see these websites: 1, 2, and 3. [map]\n\nThis photo of the Hoeffken Cleaners sign was taken in 2005. The building has since been demolished and the sign is gone.\n\nBrite Way Cleaners was established in 1945. This sign is probably from the 1950s or 1960s. [map]\n\nThis Harter's Hobby House sign was replaced with a plastic sign shortly after this photo was taken in 2005. For more, see this website."
