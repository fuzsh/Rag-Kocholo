At the dive where I worked, I was asked to become a turtle and of course, I got all of the questions correct since I do not have a dirty mind.\n\nThe years went by and I never gave it a 2nd thought and then Bam... here comes Dave with his Turtle information and pond and I was once again hooked.\n\nI am in the DC/Metro area desperately searching for a pond of my own. To my dismay, I am finding a lot of folks around here that have absolutely no clue what it takes to be a turtle.\n\nIf you know anyone...\n\nMy grandfather served in the US 7th and 3rd Armies in WW2 France and Germany. His unit was attached to Patton's forces that seiged and captured Metz.\n\nOne day when I was going through some of his estate documents what looked like an old library card fell from between the pages of an old hymnal.\n\nUpon further inspection I saw his signature on the \"Stony Lake Chapter Roving International Association of TURTLES\"\n\nI immediately went online and found turtleclub.us and I proud to say I am now the Master Turtle the First Turtle Pond in Florida.\n\nCome visit www.thepinkpiano.club in Lakeland Florida and ask any of our staff if they're a Turtle.\n\nIn my youth, I was working as a Front Desk Manager at a hotel near my home. I would have a regular guest, Guy Cooley, that would stop and talk with me for, at least, half an hour every time he checked in and checked out. He would always ask me these riddles that I thought were a little dirty, but I would think about them and I answered them \"cleanly\". To which, he was surprised that a person of my age wouldn't have their mind in the gutter and answer with the low hanging fruit, dirty answers that so many people gave him prior.\n\nOn one of his final trips he slipped me a card that said \"Are you a Turtle?\" A little confused, I asked what was the story behind it. He then told me his story and how he became a Turtle and asked if I would like to become a Turtle as well. Of course, I agreed and that was that. I always greeted him with a smile and he would always ask if I was a Turtle and proudly gave him the official answer.\n\nI never knew that there was such a strong following, as I mostly forgot about it, until I started at my new job where a gentleman would come around and ask other people \"Are you a Turtle?\". Immediately I snapped back to 20 years prior and when he finally asked me I said \"You bet your sweet ass I am.\". His eyes lit up and we've been swapping riddles ever since. We've even brought another person into the Turtle Club and were excited to start our own \"Pond\".\n\nI was out in the woods one day when I stumbled across an ancient temple dedicated to an honored order of turtles. I was immediately intrigued and longed to learn more about this mysterious organization.\n\nHaving heard rumors of a secret initiation ritual, I decided to brave the temple and see if I could uncover more. When I arrived at the entrance, I found myself faced with four large stone turtles. On each turtle was inscribed a question that must be answered correctly in order to gain access.\n\nBut just as I was about to answer the first question, a voice from behind me said \"Wrong! You don't know enough about turtle philosophy.\" Startled, I turned around to find an old man wearing a robe covered with turtle scales. He then proceeded to explain the deeper meaning behind the questions and what it meant to join their order.\n\nAfter listening intently and responding correctly, he granted me entry into the temple where I my journey toward total consciousness.\n\nWhile at a meeting of another ancient fraternal organization, I was helping a member sort out an issue with his membership card for that organization. And while he was rooting through his wallet, he pulled out a green card and asked me \"Are you a Turtle?\" So of course, I said \"What?\". After several minutes of stories and the prescribed questions, I found myself to be a Turtle. The member that had made me a Turtle happened to be an elder member of that organization and a former Vietnam-era Navy fighter pilot. The exchange was rather short but struck me. I was honored that this member chose to share a little bit of his life story with me. And, I am honored to be made a Turtle by him.\n\nI was at a fundraiser event for the Kiwanis Club of Glendale. While my wife and I were eating I invited another couple to share the table with us. I was wearing my own organization attire and they noticed that I had Turtle as my road name. They asked if I was a true Turtle, in which I said how I got the nick name turtle but said I was unaware of what they meant. They in return informed me of the meaning, asked me all the questions, and we ended up talking about the whole back story for over an hour.\n\nI became a proper Turtle after learning the proper etiquette & education at Aledo Square Dancing Club in 1990. Over the years, I had been involved in initiating a Turtle here and a Turle there, UNTIL I joined and became a Texas Freemason. Since then, I have become one of the Primary Initiating Officials at the Annual Waco Gathering of Turtles during the Texas Grand Lodge Communications each year. I have been involved in bringing to the Ancient Order of Turtles over 50 new Turtles each year. Therefore, I have taken on the title of Master Imperial Turtle by rights of Initiation and Raising of Turtles to the Ancient Order of Turtles 🐢 for over 30yrs. Creation of the Texas Brush Country Pond was made in 2018.\n\nLate one foggy night in the year 2009 in the mystical hills of Humboldt County, I found myself sharing tales of the unknown with my drinking buddies. Little did I know, our laughter echoed through the ears of the ancient and honorable order of the turtles. Intrigued by our camaraderie, a mysterious figure emerged – my future sponsor.\n\nHis eyes held the wisdom of generations, for he was made a turtle by his grandfather, an air force hero during World War Two. As the night unfolded, he spoke of a hidden brotherhood, one that met in the depths of an abandoned Masonic temple beneath the Veterans Affairs building in Vallejo, California.\n\nIn the clandestine basement, amidst the dimly lit chambers, I was initiated into the enigmatic order, where history and secrecy intertwined. The air was thick with the spirits of those who came before us, guiding us through rituals that transcended time.\n\nAs destiny beckoned, I pursued my studies at the California Maritime Academy, a journey that further fortified my bond with the turtles. The Masonic temple became a sanctuary where maritime cadets and veterans convened, sharing stories that wove the tapestry of our connections mainly via libations.\n\nGraduation marked my return to the Bahamas, where I embraced the responsibility passed down through the ages. In the moonlit nights by the ocean, I now carry on the tradition of making turtles, preserving the ancient order's legacy. Each crafted turtle embodies the resilience, strength, and wisdom that binds us across borders and time – a testament to the enduring spirit of the honorable order of the turtles.\n\nI was driving at the lake, as I am a delivery driver for fedex. One of my customers that I had never delivered to before asked my name after joking around and having a job time! He didn't catch my name the first couple of times, he kept thinking I said Tammy. Thats a normal thing for me haha. So I just said Sam for short. He said nice to meet you Sam, I said same to you. I was getting in my truck to go about my way and he flagged me down to tell me the story of the lady named Sam who invited him to be a turtle 🙂\n\nAfter the raising of a few new Master Masons we go together for celebration and fellowship to honor the new members. During the celebration it was asked RUA...To which I had no idea how to answer. A fellow mason who had already answered the call, but did not respond correctly was called out and in turtle fashion treated the others to a round. It was very reminiscent of my time in the Marine Corps with challenge coins, and I said that I must be a part of this. Several of my fellow Masonic brothers joined in, and the rest as they say is history.\n\nWell, when I was in highschool my best friend's mother was/still is a turtle. I asked her about it and she said I could be a member too but I had to answer the 4 riddles. I could not so she didn't let me in. About 10-15 years later I asked again and she sent me the like. I missed one riddle so I passed. Today, July 22, 2022 I answered them all correctly and feel I earned my place.\n\nWhile stationed in Darmstadt, Germany in 2002. I had the honor of being accepted into the greatest fraternity on earth; that of Free & Accepted Masonry... After years of progressing in the ranks, I was honored with receiving the Ancient Honorable Degree of Snapping Turtle immediately following my initiation in the Magnanimous Order of Knights Templar..\n\nHaving traveled the world for years, and creating new Turtles at every opportunity I could, counting well over 600, myself and 2 other brothers made the decision to form the very first pond in Houston Tx in 2009... Aptly name \"Bayou City Pond #1\"\n\nI’ve been a turtle for about 15+ years. My husband’s friend (both deceased now) from CO procured a bunch of his friends from NY and PA during one of his trips home to NY. Another friend made up stickers for us. I put a pic of a couple of them where my profile pic goes. Their 4WD club was called the High Riders from Rochester, NY. He and myself have matching YBYSAIA state license plates on our 4Runners - his from NY, mine from PA. This was right up my alley because my Dad was a Bombardier on a B-24 in WWII. in the 15th Air Force and became a POW when they had to bail out over Hungary in 1945.. General George S. Patton liberated him. I asked him if he was a Turtle but surprisingly he had not heard of this club or remembered it. He sure had a lot of good stories to tell before he passed in 2017 at age 92. Thanks for organizing this website. People are always asking about my license plate and I tell them about the Turtles but won’t tell them what it means.. I need to buy some “official” swag and membership cards so I can start procuring my own Turtles and maybe create a pond for us to hang out in😀🐢🐢🐢. Happy Turtling! Jeanne\n\nBrother Daniel Hanttula from the Masonic Grand Lodge of Oklahoma asked me if I was a Turtle, and having No idea what he was talking about, I answered \"No\". A short few months later at an \"Oklahoma Masonic Cigar and Scotch Degree\" Daniel made me a Turtle by asking me the riddles.\n\nIt was at that meeting the new Tulsa Pond was created the \"Mystic Order of Naughty a Slut Turtles in the Enchanted Realm (M.O.N.S.T.E.R. Pond)\".\n\nI have been elected their treasurer for the pond."
