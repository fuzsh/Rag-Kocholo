New York: Columbia University Press, 2004. xxiv + 326 pp., with index and bibliography. $35.00. Nicholas S. Literski When I first saw an advertisement for Clyde Forsberg’s Equal Rites: The Book of Mormon, Masonry, Gender, and American Culture, I must admit I was somewhat alarmed. Since I fully intend to explore Forsberg’s background and apparent motives, it is only fair that I do the same with my own. For some time now, I have been researching and writing a history of the impact of Freemasonry on early Mormonism, due to be published in late 2005 or early 2006. When I learned that Equal Rites would be published well before my book was completed, I wondered if my work would be wasted. Would Forsberg, a scholar published by the Columbia University Press, beat me to the punch, steal my thunder, and otherwise tell “my” fasc...\n\nJoseph Smith, the founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormonism), is arguably one of the most complicated and fascinating individuals to emerge out of the religious milieu of nineteenth century America. While, understandably, much confessional, not to say hagiographical literature has been produced about his life and work, as well as a number of largely biased studies by religious and secular detractors, there have been comparatively few objective, scholarly analyses. The most recent scholarly studies have contributed to our understanding of the social, cultural, and religious elements that influenced his religion building imagination. However, each has tended to focus on a particular feature of Smith’s religious background. One of the areas in which this thesis is distinctive, is that it argues that Smith was fundamentally and methodologically eclectic in his approach. In order to develop this line of argument, it uses Christopher Partridge’s theory of occulture to develop a thesis around the notion of Joseph Smith as ‘occultural bricoleur.’ Using the theory of occulture, we are able to see that Smith, rather than drawing on one or two features of the vibrant spiritual milieu of nineteenth century America, actually draws liberally from a range of sources. While it is argued that there were three foundational traditions that provided a loose framework for his early thought—Universalism, Swedenborgianism, and Freemasonry—it also argues that he incorporated a range of other popular folk and magical elements. As such the thesis provides a new theory of early Mormonism.\n\nThis article examines how Mormons reinterpreted the figure of Joseph Smith (1805–1844) in the wake of their prophet’s death. As a number of Mormon sects emerged in the years immediately following 1844, rival prophets claimed continued access to Smith as a means of legitimating themselves against opposing bodies. The article argues that these re-conceptualizations of Joseph Smith served to draw boundaries between movements, with particular attention to the processes of sacralization common to many new religious movements facing their founder’s death. Specific emphasis is on the Latter-Day Saints’ efforts to regulate such practices originating from their sectarian competitors but also from LDS adherents.\n\nBefore he perceived himself as a prophet, Joseph Smith was deeply involved in folk magic, particularly as a treasure seeker. Between 1823 and 1827, however, there was a shift in Joseph Smith’s divining, the type of treasure he sought, and the treasure’s significance. Both Cryptic and Royal Arch Masonry have important parallels to Smith’s recovery of sacred records and artifacts that point to a shift in his treasure seeking. This provided a fundamental paradigm shift in his self-perception as he transitioned from treasure seeker to restorer and translator of ancient scripture, opening the way for the unfolding of Mormonism.\n\nThis paper analyzes the relationship between Freemasonry and Christianity, particularly in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The religion’s tenuous relationship with the fraternal society in its doctrine and anti-masonic sentiment throughout American history would seem to make it unlikely for Freemasonry to thrive in a developing, protestant, Midwestern city. However, in examining the society’s foundation in the region as well as the impact of Christian leaders within the society itself, this paper argues that a benevolent relationship with the institutional Christian church insulated Freemasonry from anti-masonic sentiment.\n\nIn Mormon Nauvoo, there was barely a person who did not feel the pangs of a loved one’s death. At the passing of one of his dear friends, King Follett, Joseph Smith sought to comfort those who had experienced loss. Secreted within the words of his sermon were Masonic themes which many in the audience had “ears to hear.” Joseph’s own death, greatly mourned by his followers, would contain Masonic elements. Cheryl and Nick will present the mythology of grief contained within Freemasonry’s legends and rituals. They will demonstrate how these features were present in the teachings, death, and burials of Mormonism’s founder."
