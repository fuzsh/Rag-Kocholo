        "text": "GOLDEN CITY LODGE NO.1, A.F. & A.M.\n\nGOLDEN, COLORADO\n\nLate in the year 1858, George A. Jackson with Tom Golden established winter quarters at the base of the mountains near Clear Creek. During the following winter more prospectors moved into this location and thus started the settlement which developed into the Town of Golden. In this group of men there were some Master Masons and quite naturally these became closely associated. They had a feeling of mutual faith, very necessary in the community in which they were situated.\n\nThey became leaders in organizing the City of Golden and in the early fall of 1859, some twenty-three of the brethren made an application for a dispensation to form a lodge and presented it to Auraria Lodge D.D. for recommendation, which was given and forwarded to the Grand Lodge of Kansas Territory in Leavenworth for consideration.\n\nThe Grand Master of Masons in Kansas Territory issued a dispensation to Golden City Lodge U.D. in January, 1860, and Auraria Lodge U.D. was invited to institute and install the officers on Feb. 18, 1860, wirh Brother John Hughes officiating at the installation. On that date the Lodge was instituted and the officers installed as follows: Isaac E. Hardy, Worshipful Master; Eli Carter, Senior Warden; James A. Dawson, Junior Warden; Thomas H. Simmons, Secretary; John M. Ferrell, Treasurer; and Isham Hardy, Tiler.\n\nThe first candidate, Samuel F. Shaffer was duly elected, initiated, passed and raised and the Grand Master of Kansas Territory issued a Charter to Golden City Lodge No. 34, Kansas Territory, on Oct. 17, 1860. This document reached Golden City in due time and on Jan. 8, 1861, the officers elected and appointed were installed by Right Worshipful Brother L. L. Bowen, Past Deputy Grand Master of Nebraska.\n\nA State organization meeting was held in Masonic Hall, Aug. 7, 1860, with W. M. Hardy acting as Chairman and W. L. Rothrock, Lodge Secretary, acting as Secretary. With few exceptions those attending the meeting were members of the Lodge and were largely responsible for the action taken by Congress in Feb., 1861, when that body set aside the western portion of Kansas Territory and designated it as Colorado Territory.\n\nIt is reported that Golden City Lodge first met in a log cabin on Ford Street, which was later destroyed by fire. Later a few meetings were held in the old Overland Hotel on Washington Ave. A building was erected by W. A. H. Loveland who owned the lower floor and the Lodge owned the second floor. After several years the Lodge sold their interest in the building to Loveland but leased the hall for a meeting place. The next meeting place was a much larger hall over the Linder Building and finally in the I.O.O.F. hall over the Kelly Building on the West side of Washington Street, directly across the street from the original Loveland Hall.\n\nGolden City Lodge moved into its new Masonic Temple located at 400 10th Street in 1951. This is a beautiful building which is not only a credit to the Masonic Fraternity, but a valuable asset to the community as well.\n\nNo story of Golden Lodge would be complete without mention of the Chivington chair which is owned by the Golden Lodge No.1, and in which Major Chivington sat when presiding over the lodge.\n\nSUMMIT LODGE NO.2, A.F. & A.M.\n\nPARKVILLE, COLORADO\n\nSummit Lodge No.2 was one of the lodges which formed the Grand Lodge of Colorado. It had been chartered originally by the Grand Lodge of Nebraska June 5th, 1861 as No.8 in that jurisdiction.\n\nIt furnished five of the first Grand Officers when the Grand Lodge of Colorado was organized August 2nd, 1861. These were S. M. Robbins, Deputy Grand Master; James Ewing, Senior Grand Warden; C. A. Whittemore, Grand Secretary; Joshua Miller, Senior Grand Deacon; and D. T. Robley, Grand Tiler.\n\nThe Lodge met at Seven and a Half O’clock Saturday nights after each full moon. The 14 by 16-ft. Temple was a story and a half high, five rounds of logs being laid above the second floor before the roof was built.\n\nSummit County then consisted of about the northwest quarter of our present State. The earliest minute book of the Summit County Commissioners gives details of an agreement to rent the Masonic Hall. They were to pay $1.00 per day for their meetings, $1.00 per day for county court, and $1.50 for district court.\n\nSummit, No.2 was a busy Lodge during its early days. It had 17 initiations the first year and 13 initiations the second. The third year nine members had moved outside the Territory and twelve had dimitted. Others left for the winter. The Charter was left with the Grand Secretary for two years as they hoped for a new influx of miners but was finallv surrendered in 1865.\n\nThere is a monument at Parkville to which the Grand Lodge makes a pilgrimage every summer.\n\nROCKY MOUNTAIN LODGE A.F. & A.M. NO.3,\n\nGOLD HILL, COLORADO\n\nRocky Mountain Lodge No.3 at Gold Hill, a few miles from Boulder, received its dispensation from the Grand Lodge of Nebraska May 21st, 1861 and its charter June 5th, 1861.\n\nIt was one of the lodges which formed the Grand Lodge of Colorado on August 2nd, 1861. One of its members, John M. Chivington, became first Grand Master of Masons of Colorado.\n\nOther original Grand Lodge officers from this lodge included J. M. Hart, Junior Grand Warden; C. F. Holly, Grand Orator; C. W. Smith, Junior Grand Deacon; E. S. Glotfelder, Grand Steward.\n\nThe shallow deposits on Gold Hill were soon exhausted so the lodge was very short-lived.\n\nThe Grand Lodge of Colorado through the efforts of M. W. Bro. William R. Arthur, Past Grand Master, obtained title to the mining claim upon which the original lodge home was erected. A monument was erected in 1957 and in 1961 Grand Lodge started what is expected to be a series of annual visitations to this shrine.\n\nNEVADA LODGE NO.4, A.F. & A.M.\n\nNEVADAVILLE, COLORADO\n\nNevada Lodge U. D. was instituted on December 22, 1860 by the Grand Lodge of Kansas and was also chartered by same. At the Decembcr 1861 Grand Lodge of Colorado Communication a Colorado Charter was given in place of the Kansas Charter. The following served as Officers under dispensation; Worshipful. Master Andrew Mason; Senior Warden Ira H. Morton; Junior Warden James Dyke; Secretary Asa L. Miller; Treasurer John M. Van Deren; Senior Deacon William L. Sawtell; Junior Deacon Joel Newton; Tyler John Oster, Jr. A Special communication was held on the 12th day of January, 1861. Regular communications were on the 2nd and 4th Saturday nights from the 20th of September to the 20th of March at 7:00 P.M. from the 20th of March to the 20th of September at 7:30 o’clock P.M.\n\nThe Colorado Grand Lodge granted Nevada Lodge its charter on November 16, 1861. Worshipful Brother J. H. Gest, Deputy Grand Master by authority of the Grand Lodge of Kansas installed thc following officers, Brothers Andrew Mason, Worshipful Master; A. J. Van Deren, proxy for Brother J. H. Morton; S. W. Chase, Junior Warden; J. M. Van Deren, Treasurer; A. L. Miller, Secretary; J. L. Prichard as proxy for W. L. Sawtell, Senior Deacon; J. c. Russel as proxy for W. T. Potter, Junior Deacon. On April 11, 1863 a petition was received from Empire City to form a new lodge called St. Johns Lodge with names of Andrew Mason, Worshipful Master; A. R. Ellis, Senior Warden; and L. Sawtell, Junior Warden. The petition was unanimously granted. The original fee for Petitioners was Thirty-five dollars, $15.00 for Entered Apprentice, $10.00 for Fellow Craft and $10.00 for Master Mason. Two years later they were raised $5.00 on each degree.\n\nMembership at institution 22\n\nMembership 1960 118\n\nDENVER LODGE NO.5, A.F. & A.M.\n\nDENVER, COLORADO\n\nThe first recorded informal meeting of Masons in what is now Colorado was held on November 3, 1858 and was attended by 7 men. This group included Henry Allen, Charles Blake and Andrew Sagendorf, who became Masters of Auraria Lodge U. D., J. D. Ramage, the first Junior Deacon of that lodge, and W. M. Slaughter, Dr. Levi Russell and George Lehow.\n\nThe first regular meeting of Masons in Colorado was held on October 1, 1859, when a dispensation from the Grand Lodge of Kansas was delivered by R. W. Bro. D. P. Wallingford, Past Deputy Grand Master of Missouri. This lodge, Auraria Lodge U. D., was an immediate success and on November 26, 1859 the minutes showed: “Petition of J. E. Hardy and others of Golden City K. T., praying a recommendation of this lodge to the M. W. Grand Lodge of Kansas for a dispensation authorizing and empowering them to work, was presented and recommended by the lodge.”\n\nOn August 2, 1861, the Grand Lodge of Colorado was organized. On December 11, 1861 the Grand Lodge of Colorado chartered the lodge under the name of Denver Lodge No.5.\n\nThe records indicate that in 1863 a majority of the members of Denver No.5 believed the cause of the Southern Confederacy to be a just one. When those espousing the Union cause decided to form a new lodge, Union Lodge No. 7 was born.\n\nThe lodge has had many meeting places, from the Russell and Sagendorf log cabins to the present building at 1614 Welton Street, which also houses the Grand Lodge offices, the Grand Secretary, Grand Lecturer and Grand Master, as well as the Grand Lodge Museum and Library.\n\nAndrew Sagendorf, Lawrence N. Greenleaf, Frank Church, Cromwell Tucker and Frank L. Bishop, all Past Masters of the lodge, are also Past Grand Masters of the Grand Lodge of Colorado. Harry W. Bundy, present Grand Secretary, is an Honorary Past Grand Master, the only Colorado Mason to be so honored. M. W. Bro. Bundy’s other Masonic honors are so numerous as to defy cataloguing. Stewart A. Shafer is the present Senior Grand Steward of the Grand Lodge. Nearly 40 other members of the lodge have been honored by the Grand Lodge in various positions.\n\nThe lodge celebrated its 100th anniversary with a dinner and meeting at Colorado Consistory Cathedral on October 3, 1959. The main speaker of the evening was Bro. Gordon Allott,U. S. Senator from Colorado.\n\nOn November 30,1960 the lodge’s membership was 799.\n\nCENTRAL LODGE NO.6, A.F. & A.M.\n\nCENTRAL CITY, COLORADO\n\nThe first meetings of Masons who were later to become members of the Lodge were held in a building, the site of which is now marked by the historical Monument on Gregory Street. These meetings continued for about a year and then a dispensation was granted by Grand Master Armstrong of the Grand Lodge of Nebraska. On October 5, 1861, this dispensation was cancelled and a dispensation was granted by the newly formed Grand Lodge of Colorado Territory. This Lodge was chartered as Chivington Lodge No.6, December 19, 1861 in honor of Grand Master John M. Chivington. March 6, 1862 a Committee was appointed to look into the matter of building a Masonic Hall on top of a contemplated Methodist Church but the matter was filed. A Brother Collier offered the use of the walls of a building he was erecting for a third story, if they would keep a proper roof on the building. Funds were raised and the building completed. The expense on the upkeep of the roof was so great, thought was given to selling the hall and buying the Opera House. Instead the entire building was purchased, the walls reinforced, the roof repaired, a new front added.\n\nAny mention of Central Lodge would not be complete without an account of the beautiful murals on the walls. These were done by a Brother John T. Glendenin and some finished by Brother George W. Brewer. These were completed in 1871 and have not been changed to this date. The absence of sunlight has preserved their original beauty.\n\nAlthough many lodges have pictures of George Washington, the full length portrait owned by Central Lodge is among the most valuable. It also was painted by Brother Glendenin in 1865 on a damask table cloth.\n\nAmong the visitors from all of the 50 United States and the 10 foreign countries who have visited Central Lodge, have been many art critics who have valued these art treasures at fantastic sums.\n\nThe early lighting of the hall was by candles, later by coal oil lamps which were replaced by 12 oil lamps in 1875. These lamps are unique in that they have a clock spring to drive a fan which forces air around the wick burner giving a clear white flame. In 1889 these were replaced by electric lights.\n\nThe furnishings and the equipment of Central Lodge will interest any Mason.\n\nThe first Masonic Temple in the Territory was a log house about thirty feet square with an ante-room about 12 feet square on the west side near the northwest corner. The proposal to erect a monument on the site of the first Masonic Temple was initiated by W. Bro. Rae L. Laird of Central Lodge No.6, who told the Grand Lodge on September 18, 1929: “We have located the exact spot.” The committee, named to investigate, consisted of a member each from Central No.6, Golden City No.1, Nevada No.4, and Black Hawk No. 11.\n\nMembership, November 30, 1960 103\n\nUNION LODGE NO.7, A.F. & A.M.\n\nDENVER, COLORADO\n\nThe Great Fire, a severe drought and an early winter made 1863 a trying year in Denver. Especially was this true for a group of Masons, northern sympathizers, who desired to attend Lodge but who did not enjoy the atmosphere of Denver Lodge No.5 where a majority of members were friendly to the Confederacy.\n\nDuring Grand Lodge in 1863 the idea was conceived to start a second lodge in Denver. A petition was hurriedly presented and the Grand Lodge approved the issuing of a charter without formality of dispensation.\n\nA few days later, November 30th, 1863, Union Lodge No.7 was constituted with 14 members. (In 1928 it was discovered that the Grand Lodge records did not contain a record of this action. M. W. Bro. Chase Withrow, who was Grand Lecturer at the constitution, testified to the authenticity of the constitution and the Grand Lodge records were completed.)\n\nSamuel H. Elbert, Territorial Governor, was the first Master of the Lodge. He also presided in 1864 and 1869. Webster D. Anthony also served three terms as Master and two terms as Grand Master. Roger W. Woodbury was Master two terms and Grand Master one term.\n\nOther Past Masters of Union, No.7 who were elected Grand Master are William D. Todd, William D. Pierce, Benjamin L. James and Howard T. Vaille (after whom Vaille Pass was named).\n\nFirst Grand Master John M. Chivington was one of the charter members of Union, No.7 as Rocky Mountain, No.3 at Gold Hill, his original Colorado Lodge, had suspended when the gold camp was abandoned. M. W. Bro. Chivington was the Colonel in charge of troops at the Battle of Sand Creek. After the resulting furor in the East, Colonel Chivington was cleared. Union, No.7 spread upon its minutes a resolution absolving Chivington of any blame.\n\nOn November 4th, 1884, Union, No.7 had its first class of four Fellowcrafts being raised to the Sublime Degree of Master lVlason. Two of these became Masters and one, W. D. Pierce, Grand Master.\n\nA major activity of Union Lodge, is its St. John’s fund, started in 1889, and after which the Grand Lodge Benevolent Fund is patterned.\n\nMost Worshipful Grand Master William D. Todd, a Past Master of Union Lodge, officiated at the laying of the cornerstone of the present Masonic Temple located at 16th and Welton.\n\nThe Golden Anniversary of Union Lodge, was celebrated November 20, 1913 by a sumptuous dinner and program held at 1770 Sherman, the Shrine Temple at that time. Howard T. Vaille was Worshipful Master. On the 75th Anniversary celebration Worshipful Brother William B. Killey was Master. It should be noted that Brother Hannum served the lodge faithfully as secretary for 35 years and another good and faithful secretary then began his term which was to last 25 years, namely William R. Shaw, Past Master.\n\nMembership 1960 587.\n\nEMPIRE LODGE NO.8, A.F. & A.M.\n\nEMPIRE, COLORADO\n\nDispensation for the organization of Empire Lodge at Empire City, Clear Creek County was issued November 28th, 1864 by M. W. Bro. Archie J. Van Deren.\n\nIts charter was granted at the Fifth Annual Communication on November 6th, 1865. The officers elected were installed in Grand Lodge by Past Grand Master Henry M. Teller. They were Andrew Mason, Worshipful Master; H. A. Haskins, Senior Warden; and John S. Jones as proxy for J. Mullen.\n\nAt this Grand Lodge session, Bro. Mason, who had been elected Right Worshipful Deputy Grand Master in December, 1861, was also elected and installed as Grand Master of Masons of Colorado.\n\nFifteeen Master Masons and three Fellowcrafts were reported as members. The lodge had initiated five, passed six, raised three, and had rejected one.\n\nThe following year it reported it had admitted two, initiated 11, passed 11, raised 12, and rejected two. Its membership had risen to 28, all of whom but one lived in Colorado Territory despite the shifting living habits of the miners.\n\nMONTANA LODGE NO.9, A.F. & A.M.\n\nVIRGINIA CITY, MONTANA\n\nFirst extension of Masonry outside the present boundaries of Colorado was on April 4th, 1867 when Deputy Grand Master O. B. Brown granted a dispensation to brethren at Virginia City, Montana for formation of a second lodge there. The first active lodge in Montana had been granted a dispensation by the Grand Lodge of Kansas on Dec. 7th, 1863 and chartered as Virginia City, No. 43, under Kansas, on Dec. 20th, 1864.\n\nH. L. Hosmer was appointed first Master of Montana Lodge U. D.; L. W. Frary, first Senior Warden; and William Gray, first Junior Warden.\n\nThe petition was recommended by Virginia City, No. 43 and also by Union Lodge No.7.\n\nL. W. Frary, Past Master of Golden City, No.1, had been Grand Sword Bearer of the Grand Lodge of Colorado in 1863. He had attended the first installation of the officers of Union Lodge No.7 and was a friend of several of its members.\n\nWhile under dispensation the lodge initiated five, passed two and raised one. Its records were correct and so it was chartered on November 7th, 1865. Its membership consisted of 17 Master Masons, one Fellowcraft, and three Entered Apprentices.\n\nIn 1866, Grand Secretary Whittemore reported “We have been informed by the W. M. of Montana Lodge No.9 of the organization of a Grand Lodge of Montana but nothing has been received from the officers of the new Grand Lodge.”\n\nIt had been organized on Jan. 24th, 1866 with Montana, No.9 of Colorado becoming No. 2 in the new grand body.\n\nHELENA CITY LODGE NO. 10, A.F. & A.M.\n\nHELENA CITY, MONTANA\n\nDispensation for brethren at Helena, Adgerton County, Montana Territory, was issued in 1865 by M. W. Bro. Archibald J. Van Deren. The fee for dispensation was $40 and was received by Grand Secretary Whittemore on July 10th, 1865.\n\nThe application for charter, with its fee of $20, was received on October 25th, 1865.\n\nThe charter was granted to Helena City as No. 10 on November 7th, 1865. The lodge had 15 Master Mason affiliates, one Fellowcraft, and one Entered Apprentice. It had initiated three and passed two but “for the want of time” had not conferred the third degree. However, the committee reported it was satisfied the brethren of Helena City were competent to confer the third degree in due form and therefore recommended the suspension of Article 14 of the bylaws and that charter be granted.\n\nM. W. Bro. Andrew Mason reported in 1866 that he had received a letter from Bro. Cornelius Hedges, W. M. of Helena City, No. 10 “informing me of the organization of a Grand Lodge for that Territory, and asking permission to retain the charter granted to them by this Grand Body at its last communication, which permission was not granted.”\n\nAt that same session, the Grand Lodge extended fraternal greetings to the new Grand Lodge and it was welcomed into the sisterhood of Grand Lodges.\n\nHelena City No. 10 of Colorado became No.3 of Montana.\n\nBLACKHAWK LODGE NO. 11, A.F. & A.M.\n\nBLACK HAWK, COLORADO\n\nThe first meeting of record of Black Hawk Lodge U. D. was held February 17, 1866 by virtue of dispensation issued by Grand Master of Masons for the Territory of Colorado, Andrew Mason. He appointed Brother Chase Withrow, Worshipful Master; Brother H. M. Orahood, Senior Warden; and Brother J. W. Nesmith, Junior Warden. The following Brethren were appointed officers, J. W. Currier, Treasurer; J. S. Taylor, Secretary; John Baylon, Senior Deacon; E. W. Wurtzbach, Junior Deacon; G. W. Fairhurst, Senior Steward; Zepha Myers, Junior Steward; Alonzo Smith, Tyler. At this first meeting three petitions for membership were received, namely: Mr. J. W. Ritchie, Mr. F. B. Hurlburt and Mr. F. A. Rudolph. The lodge was named after the city of Black Hawk. On October 1, 1866, Black Hawk Lodge was granted a Charter by the Grand Lodge. The Worshipful Master was H. M. Orahood.\n\nTwo of our Grand Masters have come from the ranks of Black Hawk Lodge, M. W. Brother Chase Withrow and M. W. Brother Harper Orahood. M. W. Brother Chase Withrow was serving the Grand Lodge as Senior Grand Warden and Grand Master at the same time he was Master of Black Hawk Lodge No. 11. He was elected and served as Master of Black Hawk Lodge, fifty years later. There were twenty-two signers for dispensation.\n\nBlack Hawk Lodge, November 30th, 1960 had 62 members.\n\nGEORGETOWN LODGE NO. 12, A.F. & A.M.\n\nGEORGETOWN, COLORADO\n\nGeorgetown Lodge No. 12, originally Washington Lodge No. 12, was chartered without the lodge operating under dispensation. It was granted a charter October 7, 1867 and this charter was granted to three Master Masons, namely: Andrew Mason, Worshipful Master; Jairus Hall, Senior Warden; and Dubois Tucker, Junior Warden. The first communication of Washington Lodge was held on October 22, 1867 at the Masonic Hall which was a room above the Dagleish Photograph Gallery. Lodge was opened by the three officers named in the charter and Most Worshipful Brother Henry M. Teller, Grand Master, and all Grand Lodge Officers present for the purpose dedicated and consecrated Washington Lodge No. 12. The Grand Master presented the Lodge with a large Bible which was used on the altar many years but is now in the archives.\n\nThis lodge met in several different halls until finally in December, 1890, Most Worshipful Grand Master Ernest LeNeve Foster gave permission to move to the present location. January 24, 1891, Most Worshipful Grand Master Ernest LeNeve Foster made his official visit and presented three gavels to the lodge. They had ebony handles and ivory heads. A vote of thanks was extended to Georgetown Chapter No.4, Royal Arch Masons in April 1893 for a $600.00 contribution towards expenses of moving into the new Temple and buying Furniture.\n\nA group of seventeen Masons petitioned for a dispensation to form a new lodge but were turned down by Washington Lodge, on June 5, 1881. Later in the year on October 8, 1881, a petition was again presented and at this time the prayer of the petitioners was granted. On September 20, 1882 the Lodge was chartered as Georgetown Lodge No. 48.\n\nIn the year 1900 the question of consolidating the two lodges came up and a committee was appointed from No. 12 to investigate the feasibility of this move. They met with a like committee from No. 48 and later had a joint meeting which proposed a resolution to the effect that action be taken to consolidate under Grand Lodge By-law 135. The Worshipful Master presented the resolution but since Georgetown No. 48 had already taken action against the resolution it was laid on the table. Again in 1912 it was tried but failed. However, in March of 1916 both lodges agreed to consolidate. The charters were sent to the Most Worshipful Grand Master at Denver by William H. Bullock, P. M., and the two lodges became one to be known as Georgetown No. 12.\n\nEL PASO LODGE NO. 13, A.F. & A.M.\n\nCOLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO\n\nThe name El Paso means “pass” in Spanish and it is fitting that the lodge at the foot of the Pass, now Ute Pass, be known by that name.\n\nFirst meetings of EI Paso Lodge were held in the old El Paso Hotel early in 1866 at Colorado City, now west Colorado Springs. The first meeting U. D. was on October 20, 1866. Eleven charter members were present and a resolution was passed asking the Grand Lodge to grant them a charter. Last meeting Under Dispensation was held on September 28, 1867. Until Mount Moriah Lodge in Canon City was placed Under Dispensation several Brethren would ride horseback from Canon City, fifty-five miles, to attend Lodge. They slept on the Lodge floor and rode home the next day. The charter is dated October 8, 1867 and signed by Chase Withrow, Grand Master, and the Lodge was constituted by Grand Master Henry M. Teller on November 7, 1867.\n\nThe Lodge met in many buildings until it moved into the building it now occupies at 9 North Nevada Avenue. The Cornerstone for this building was laid on May 4, 1908 by Most Worshipful Brother Joseph A. Davis, Grand Master. The building was completed the same year and dedicated with a three day celebration November 30th, December 1st & 2nd. The building is one of the most beautiful and interesting Lodges in the Country. The style of architecture is Egyptian and the Architect was Worshipful Brother Charles E. Thomas of Tejon Lodge No. 104.\n\nIn 1917 the 50th Anniversary of the Lodge was celebrated and in 1942 the 75th Anniversary. The Temple was dear of all indebtedness in 1926. El Paso Lodge, has sponsored several other Lodges namely: – Mount Moriah, No. 15, Canon City; Pueblo, No. 17, Pueblo; Manitou, No. 68, Manitou Springs; Colorado Springs, No. 76, Colorado Springs; Tejon, No. 104, Colorado Springs and Ramah, No. 165, Ramah.\n\nEI Paso Lodge is one of the larger lodges in Colorado, having almost 1000 members. Past Masters of El Paso Lodge, who served as Grand Masters are Andrew Sagendorf, who dimitted from Denver Lodge No.5; George D. Kennedy and George W. Musser. Most Worshipful Grand Master Leon H. Snyder is serving the Grand Lodge during its Centennial Celebration. He was Worshipful Master of El Paso Lodge, in 1946. Most Worshipful Brother Snyder holds many Masonic Titles, being a 330 Honorary of the Scottish Rite. He has also distinguished himself as County, State and National Committeeman of the Rupublican Party\n\nOther Brothers active in other Masonic Bodies: Worshipful Brother William A. Campbell, Grand High Priest in 1915, Brother James B. Barnes, Grand Commander of the Grand Commandery, 1921-1922; Worshipful Brother Eugene L. Anderson, Grand High Priest, 1958-1959; and many other Brothers who were prominent citizens and active in the affairs of the Lodge, City and State.\n\nCOLUMBIA LODGE NO. 14, A.F. & A.M.\n\nBOULDER, COLORADO\n\nColumbia Lodge No. 14 was granted dispensation on December 17, 1866 being sponsored by Black Hawk Lodge No.11. The dispensation was granted to twelve pioneer gold miners of Columbia City who thereby became our Masonic fathers, and to A. ]. Van Deren, fourth Grand Master (1864) of Masons of Colorado, who was designated Master of the Lodge Under Dispensation but who served as Master only at the opening meeting on January 3, 1867. The other original members were: Theo. Haswell, Senior Warden (who acted as Master throughout 1867 and was Worshipful Master throughout 1868); T. J. Johns, Junior Warden; A. Mills, Treasurer; G. W. Carter, Secretary; O. H. Henry, Senior Deacon (who was to become Master for 1870 and 1871 and, in 1875 Grand Master); E. A. Hupper, Junior Deacon; John Richardson, Tiler; ]. W. Horner; ]. W. Pomeroy; W. T. Potter; M. G. Smith (later to donate 25.5 acres of land to form the original campus of the University of Colorado at Boulder); J. F. Spaulding.\n\nDuring their eight months Under Dispensation at Columbia City before their charter as Columbia Lodge No. 14 was granted on October 8, 1867, these twelve original brethren fully initiated the following twelve brethren: A. E. Berger; W. A. Corson; Bart Esmond; Henry Green; Troy McCleary; Henry Paul; Thomas Ryalls; W. C. Slater; Wilhelm Sommer; J. A. Stanton; O. H. Tubbs (later changed to E. F. Mason) ; J. W. Wigginton.\n\nThe town of Columbia City was short lived and the lodge asked permission to move to Boulder which was granted on October 7, 1868 one year after receiving its charter. Valmont Lodge had been working under dispensation and affiliated with Columbia.\n\nM. W. Bro. Teller reported to the Grand Lodge:\n\n“The brethren of Columbia Lodge desire to change the place of holding their meetings. The most of the members residing in and about ‘Ward have removed to other sections of the country, leaving the brethren in the vicinity of Boulder City to keep up the organization. This they cannot do without considerable trouble and expense, and therefore, they desire to move the lodge to Boulder City where they have made preparations by procuring suitable rooms for lodge purposes. If this change is made it will bring Columbia within seven miles of Valmont and I do not believe both lodges can be well supported so close together. . . I cannot recommend the granting of a charter to them if Columbia lodge is allowed to meet at Boulder City.”\n\nIn 1899, thirty-one years after Columbia Lodge No. 14 left its birthplace in Columbia City to survive a depressed economic situation, sufficient prosperity returned to that place to enable another group of miners to form another Masonic Lodge there in a revived town then called Ward. But after 25 years mining again became so depressed that the second Lodge, Mount Audubon, No. 107, felt unable to continue. So in 1924 it was permitted to move to Boulder and consolidate, just as Columbia, had done 54 years before.\n\nThe Lodge had the experience of moving from one town to another, absorbing two other lodges and also meeting in nine different halls. The last home of Columbia, had its cornerstone laying on September 10, 1949.\n\nIt is notable that four Grand Masters have served as Master of Columbia Lodge No. 14. It has been mentioned that A. J. Van Deren, Grand Master in 1864, was appointed Master of Columbia, U. D.; and that O. H. Henry, an original member of the Lodge U. D., was Grand Master in 1875. Two more were produced by Columbia Lodge No. 14: J. A. Davis, who was Grand Master in 1906; and Professor Wm. R. Arthur, who was Grand Master in 1936.\n\nMOUNT MORIAH LODGE A.F. & A.M. NO. 15,\n\nCANON CITY, COLORADO\n\nMount Moriah Lodge was first born in the minds of five men riding home from a meeting of El Paso Lodge No. 13 in Colorado Springs. These men were Stephen Frazier and his two sons, Gideon and Reuben, Charles Pauls and Mills Craig. There were only eleven Brethren in Canon City but Henry M. Teller, Grand Master, gave them a dispensation on December 11, 1867, naming Gideon Frazier as Worshipful Master, Benjamin F. Smith, Senior Warden and Stephen Frazier, Junior Warden. The following brothers were appointed:- William McClure, Treasurer; Warren R. Fowler, Secretary; Reuben Frazier, Senior Deacon; Charles Pauls, Junior Deacon; H. H. Marsh, Senior Steward; B. F. Rockafellow, Junior Steward and G. W. Depp, Tiler.\n\nWhen Canon U. D. asked for a charter he name of Teller Lodge was requested but when it was granted the name was Mount Moriah. The officers under charter were the same as under Dispensation, except S. M. Cox was elected as Secretary.\n\nThe Lodge had the usual experience with different meeting places and finally decided to build their own. The cornerstone was laid on July 17, 1881 with a large attendance. The same day the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge laid the cornerstone of the new Court House, the first time the Grand Lodge laid two cornerstones in one day.\n\nAmong the members of Mount Moriah Lodge, have been a Governor, Senators and other notables. One whose name stands out through his faithfulness to the Craft was Brother Gideon Frazier. He was prominent in the following lodges, El Paso, No. 13, Mount Moriah, No. 15, Mesa, No. 55 where he was Worshipful Master for several years. Then he became charter member of Meriden Lodge No.47 in Idaho.\n\nMount Moriah, has as its charity fund the George H. Kellenberger Charity Fund started by Brother Kellenberger. Mount Moriah, membership growth has been steady from a beginning of eleven to its present membership as of November 30,1960 372.\n\nCHEYENNE LODGE NO. 16, A.F.&A.M.\n\nCHEYENNE, WYOMING\n\nDuring the absence of Grand Master Henry M. Teller during the early part of 1868 Right Worshipful O. A. Whittemore, Deputy Grand Master, granted a dispensation to the brethren of Cheyenne, Dakota Territory, to open a lodge with Brother James Scott, 1865 Master of Golden City, No. 1, as Worshipful Master.\n\nOn his return from the east M. W. Bro. Teller visited the lodge and found it in a “prosperous condition. The inhabitants of Cheyenne are as yet quite unsettled, yet I think there is suitable material to support a good lodge at that point.”\n\nIt was chartered on October 6th, 1868 with 23 members. It had initiated, passed and raised three while under dispensation.\n\nDuring the following year it initiated 25, passed 24, and raised 17. It had eight affiliations and five dimissions. Its roll contained 43 Master Masons plus the Tiler who was not a member of that lodge, seven Fellowcrafts, and eight Entered Apprentices.\n\nThe Wyoming Grand Lodge was formed in 1875 by four lodges, three of them belonging to Colorado jurisdiction. This lodge became Wyoming No. 1.\n\nPUEBLO LODGE NO. 17, A.F. & A.M.\n\nPUEBLO, COLORADO\n\nAbout mid-December of 1867, two Brethren met and examined each other and became convinced that they were Masons. Augustus Bartlett and C. J. Hart then examined other men, assembled a few Masons together and arranged to submit a petition to the Grand Lodge for dispensation for the formation of a new Lodge in Pueblo, Colorado. Dr. J. W. Dickenson then posted and prepared the Brethren to form a Lodge.\n\nThe dispensation was granted on April 5, 1868 by the Deputy Grand Master, O. A. Whittemore in the absence of the Grand Master, Henry M. Teller.\n\nThe first meeting of Pueblo Lodge U. D., April 27, 1868. The Lodge was opened upon the First, Second and Third Degrees of Masonry when the motion for regular communications was carried to meet on second and fourth Wednesdays.\n\nThe first degree to be conferred was an Entered Apprentice Degree. It was conferred upon J. W. O. Snyder on May 28, 1868. J. J. Thomas was the first man raised to the Sublime Degree of a Master Mason on June 11, 1868.\n\nPueblo Lodge U. D., made its return to the Grand Lodge in October of 1868 and applied for the Charter. The Charter was not delivered until December 28, 1868, because the printer had not finished the printing.\n\nPueblo Lodge No. 17, was dedicated and constituted by Bro. J W. Dickenson though no record remains of the authority for this action. The Lodge resolved to prohibit the introduction of spirituous, vinous or malt liquors within the Lodge.\n\nThe Lodge was given a large plot of land; some was reserved for a Lodge Cemetery. Much of this ground has been disposed of.\n\nThe Lodge moved to many locations in Pueblo for its meetings. The night of meeting has been changed several times.\n\nThe Lodge has always maintained its interest in the needs of the Fraternity, contributing to various calls.\n\nThe Lodge has many distinguished members, among the most prominent have been W. W. Cooper, Past Master and for many years the Grand Secretary. Cornelius J. Hart, Past Grand Master, Will D. Grisard, Past Grand Master, and George B. Clark, Masonic historian and museum curator.\n\nMembers at chartering were 25, members in 1960 856.\n\nLARAMIE LODGE NO. 18, A.F. & A.M.\n\nLARAMIE, WYOMING\n\nThe Union Pacific railroad platted the townsite of Laramie City in day after the tracks to Laramie were completed the first train unloaded a “strange assortment of humanity and materials” typical of a frontier town.\n\nWithin two years 28 Masons petitioned the Grand Lodge of Colorado to establish a regular lodge. Granted dispensation on January 31, 1870, the lodge held 15 stated and 43 called communications, initiated 29, passed and raised 22 before the chartering on September 28, 1870.\n\nLaramie Lodge No. 18 was host when the Grand Lodge of Wyoming was organized by the four lodges in the Territory of Wyoming December 15, 1874. Three of these were Colorado bodies. The other was affiliated with Nebraska.\n\nThe new Laramie Lodge No.3 of Wyoming furnished four of the new grand officers.\n\nFinest fraternal relations have always existed between Laramie Masons and their brethren in Colorado. On August 2, 1961, actual centennial of the Grand Lodge of Colorado, a telegram of felicitations was sent to Collins Lodge No. 19 at Fort Co1Iins which was chartered on the same date as Laramie, No. 18.\n\nCOLLINS LODGE NO. 19, A.F. & A.M.\n\nFORT COLLINS, COLORADO\n\nThe first informal meeting of Masons in Fort Collins was in Henry Clay Peterson’s Workshop in 1866. There were many Freemasons in the district prior to that date, but this was the first known meeting in the area. Brother Peterson’s “Work Shop” was the cradle of Masonry in Fort Collins.\n\nAs a result of this and subsequent meetings, a petition was sent to the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Colorado requesting a Dispensation to establish a lodge in Fort Collins. Signers of the petition were recommended by Columbia Lodge, of Boulder, as having proved themselves skilled: Master Masons, and meeting the necessary requirements.\n\nOn May 22, 1870, Fidelity Lodge, Under Dispensation was organized. Most Worshipful Grand Master Henry M. Teller appointed Henry Clay Peterson, Worshipful Master; F. J. Snider, Senior Warden; B. H. Eaton, Junior Warden. The Worshipful Master then appointed A. A. Loomis, Treasurer; J. H. Bradstreet, Secretary; J. Wills, Senior Deacon; H. Straton, Junior Deacon; and T. M. Smith, Tiler. The above men were signers of the petition for dispensation as were C. J. McDivit, J. M. Smith, G. M. Swift, B. T. Whedbee and M. G. Smith.\n\nFidelity Lodge U. D. met on the second story of the Grout Building, where they initiated nine Entered Apprentices, passed three to the degree of a fellow craft and raised three to the sublime degree of a Master Mason. Samuel P. Holland was the first candidate to receive his degrees in Fidelity Lodge U. D.\n\nA petition to change the name from Fidelity, to Collins Lodge, at the time of the granting of the charter was granted, and on September 28, 1870, Collins Lodge No. 19 received its charter.\n\nDeputy Grand Master O. H. Henry instituted the Lodge and installed its First Officers under charter on October 15, 1870.\n\nThese officers were Henry Clay Peterson, Worshipful Master; J. R. Wills, Senior Warden; B. H. Eaton, Junior Warden; Abner Loomis, Treasurer; J. H. Bradstreet, Secretary; Perry Downing, Senior Deacon; H. Stratton, Junior Deacon; C. J. McDivit, Senior Steward; A. J. Davis, Junior Steward; and J. M. Smith, Tiler. Worshipful Brother Henry Clay Peterson served his Lodge as Worshipful Master Under Dispensation, and again as a chartered Lodge in 1870, 1871, 1872, 1875 and 1878, doing much to promote the general welfare of the Lodge.\n\nThe first decade was a period of work, frustration and adjustment, and reveals a great amount of charity and relief to the poor and distressed.\n\nThe second decade saw the Lodge become a factor in the community – an influence for the betterment of Fort Collins.\n\nThe end of the third decade marked thirty years of genuine Masonry, wherein charity, ritualistic decor and the welfare of the Lodge were of prime importance, with social intercourse only at times when it did not interfere with the welfare of the lodge or its members.\n\nThe fourth decade of Collins Lodge, saw it move into its own Temple or rather a Temple for the Lodge and Constituent Bodies. This was the fourth home of Collins Lodge, the first being in the Grout Building, second the hall over Stover E. Tomlin Store, and third in the Loomis Block. The Worshipful Master at the beginning of this decade was L. D. Crain, who served as Grand Master in 1917-18.\n\nIn 1911 under guidance of I. E. Newsom as Worshipful Master, who became Grand Master in 1928, the lodge continued to move forward. The highlight of this year was the laying of the cornerstone of the Federal Building by Grand Master Robert M. Simons, assisted and supported by Collins Lodge No. 19.\n\nThe period from 1910 to 1920 showed a healthy growth in the lodge and community. A change in the By-laws was necessary to avoid the possibility of a repetition of loss in Lodge Funds, which was discovered on the death of the secretary in 1909. An audit of his books showed a deficit from 1906 to 1909 of over $1000.\n\nA Masonic Library was started in 1914.\n\nThe period 1920 to 1930 saw the planning and building of a New Temple and the furthering of social activities.\n\nThe New Temple was dedicated at a special communication June 27, 1927 by the Grand Master, Most Worshipful Brother Frank J. Reinhard, assisted by the Grand Lodge officers and” members of Collins Lodge. The Lodge received many gifts at this time, from members and relatives of deceased members.\n\nThe years 1930 to 1940 were trying years. The Lodge funds were depleted and membership dropped due to the economic condition of the country. Many were suspended for non-payment of dues. This period saw a decrease in membership from 772 to 590, a net loss of 182.\n\nMembership decreases continued in the early 1940’s, but more members were paying dues and by 1945 when the Lodge celebrated its 75th year things had stabilized. Beginning with the year 1946 the Lodge has had a healthy increase in membership and a financial recovery that saw the burning of the mortgage on the Temple, December 27, 1948.\n\nThe decade of the 1950’s continued leveling off with a stable membership and sound financial status.\n\nThe highlight of this period was the laying of the cornerstone of the County Court House by Grand Master, Most Worshipful Brother Charles A. Mantz, a former member of Collins Lodge, assisted by other Grand Lodge officers, in September, 1955.\n\nOn May 15, 1959, a petition for the degrees was received from J. L. Dickey, a great grandson of Henry Clay Peterson, the first Worshipful Master and one of the founders of Collins Lodge No. 19. Thus into the fourth generation the Collins Lodge continues to encompass its members in the precepts of Masonry.\n\nOCCIDENTAL LODGE NO. 20, A.F. & A.M.\n\nGREELEY, COLORADO\n\nOn November 29, 1870, there was granted to a group of Greeley Masons a dispensation to operate a lodge. Some months later, on September 26, 1871, M.W.G.M. Henry M. Teller granted the lodge a charter, which was signed by 30 members. From this humble beginning the lodge membership increased to 663 on November 30, 1960.\n\nDuring its 90 years of existence, the lodge has met in 6 different locations, including one meeting place that was formerly the stage of the Greeley Opera House. One building was destroyed by fire in 1883. That was occupied under a 99 year lease and in 1959 a quitclaim deed was given so that the Greeley National Bank, the present owner, might obtain a loan on it for their holding company.\n\nThe cornerstone of the present Temple, at 9th Street and 10th Avenue, was laid June 20, 1927 by M.W.G.M. Frank J. Reinhart. The first lodge meeting in the new Temple was held on October 14, 1927.\n\nIn 1908, Henry T. West, Past Grand Marshal, was made a Permanent Grand Lodge Member for his zeal, ability, and faithful services for nearly half a century. He was a regular attendant at Grand Lodge for nearly 40 years until he moved to Idaho in 1910. A letter of his recollections about the world’s development during his life span entertained the Grand Lodge in 1917. He died in 1923 having been a Mason over 70 years.\n\nDr. Zachariah X. Snyder, president of the State Normal School, now Colorado State College, served as Grand Chaplain from 1904 to 1915.\n\nTyndall Snyder, Senior Grand Steward, died in 1948. Giles N. Alkire was appointed to the Grand Officer line to succeed him but was drafted two years afterwards to follow Charles L. Young as Grand Lecturer.\n\nIrving Cannon, P. M., is now serving our Grand Lodge as Grand Marshal.\n\nThe lodge has always been interested in strengthening the ties of Masonry and is assisting in the forming of a new lodge in Greeley.\n\nARGENTA LODGE NO. 21, A.F. & A.M.\n\nSALT LAKE CITY, UTAH\n\nArgenta Lodge was given a dispensation April 8, 1871 by Grand Master Henry M. Teller; Ebenezer H. Shaw to act as Worshipful Master, Elias B. Zabriskie, as Senior Warden and Martin Harkness, as Junior Warden.\n\nOn September 26, 1871 the Grand Lodge of Colorado granted a charter to Argenta Lodge No. 21, Utah Territory. There were thirteen members. There being three Lodges in Utah Territory, they met on January 6, 1872 for the purpose of forming a Grand Lodge. This was accomplished on January 20, 1872 and Argenta was given the number 3. Argenta Lodge was a member of Colorado Grand Lodge only five months.\n\nWESTON LODGE NO. 22, A.F. & A.M.\n\nLITTLETON, COLORADO\n\nFor several months in the latter part of 1871, the necessity of a Masonic lodge in the Littleton area had been discussed by a group of Masons. A petition for a dispensation was submitted to the Grand Lodge and on March 1, 1872, the dispensation was granted by M.W.G.M. Henry M. Teller. The lodge minutes do not show that a charter was received. They merely indicate a change from “U.D.” to “No. 22”.\n\nThe meeting nights were set as the first and third Saturdays of each month and have been changed only once. That was for a short time when the meetings were held only on the first Saturday.\n\nThe first stated communication was held April 8, 1872 at the corner of what was then Rapp Avenue and Alamo Street. Nearly 50 years later, after several moves, Weston Lodge occupied its present Temple, just across the alley from its first meeting place. This Temple was dedicated on November 19, 1921 by M. W. Bro. Marshall H. Van Fleet.\n\nThere were only a few communications held between July 13, 1878 and November 4, 1882. At several meetings a charter surrender was discussed and on at least two occasions a ballot was taken but it was decided the lodge should continue its struggle for survival.\n\nThe 3 original chairs used by the Master and Wardens, the original jewels and officers’ aprons, the original three Great Lights and many other items of historic interest are still in possession of the lodge.\n\nThere were 400 members on November 30, 1960.\n\nST. VRAIN LODGE NO. 23, A.F. & A.M.\n\nLONGMONT, COLORADO\n\nOn June 22, 1872, Most Worshipful Grand Master Henry M. Teller granted a dispensation to a group of about 20 Master Masons with Ed B. Newman as Worshipful Master, W. M. Rech as Senior Warden and E. J. Coffman as Junior Warden. On June 6, the first meeting was held in the Thompson Building, located at the corner of 5th and Main Streets. The city of Longmont at this time was about one year old.\n\nThe Lodge was named after the well known and celebrated pioneer, Ceran St. Vrain who was a member of Montezuma Lodge No. 109 at Santa Fe, New Mexico Territory and who, together with Charles Bent, in 1837, built Fort St. Vrain which is now Platteville.\n\nThe first Brother to receive his degrees was W.W Secor. The charter was received on Sept. 25, 1872. Brother Ed B. Newman Worshipful Master.\n\nIn 1877, the Lodge moved to larger quarters which were the property of the Methodist Church and met there until it moved into the new Temple in 1883.\n\nIn 1879, Past Master Byron L. Carr was elected Grand Master. In 1885, Brother George E. Wyman was also elected Grand Master. In 1873, Bro. Byron Carr assisted in drafting the Colorado State Constitution and in 1896 he was elected Colorado State Attorney. Bro. E. F. Beckweth was elected Secretary of State in 1898.\n\nIn 1890, St. Vrain Lodge assisted brethren of the Berthoud district in forming their Lodge which has since been known as No. 80. During this year the membership reached 100.\n\nIn 1892, electricity was insta1led in the Temple as well as the Lodge Rooms.\n\nEarly in Feb. 1905, fire completely destroyed the Temple. The only thing salvaged was the fire-proof safe which contained all records. The Odd Fellows of this city proved to be very good friends. Their Lodge rooms were used until our Temple was completely restored. At this time signs were posted marked “No Smoking”.\n\nIn 1908, No. 23 assisted in organizing the Lodge at Lyons.\n\nIn 1911 our Brother L. H. Dickson passed away. He was Worshipful Master in 1879, Tiler from 1894 to 1911, as well as Mayor of Longmont from 1881 through 1885. This year the membership passed the 200 mark\n\nIn 1922 the 50th celebration was held. Two charter members were present. The mortgage of the new Temple was burned. Membership was 300.\n\nIn 1927, Bro. John Andrew was elected Grand Master. During this year Bro. J. W. Denio who had served this Lodge as Treasurer for 34 years resigned. In 1939, Bro. Alex M. Preston, the last charter member of this Lodge passed away. In 1947, our Bro. and Past Grand Master, John Andrews passed away. In 1950, the membership passed the 400 mark. In 1952, Bro. L. B. Flanders who served as Treasurer of the Lodge for 25 years passed away and Bro. Joseph Goforth, who served as Tiler for 33 years resigned. In 1958, No. 23 assisted in forming the Lodge at Estes Park\n\nIt is interesting to note that 20 of the 34 men elected as Mayor of Longmont have been Master Masons.\n\nThree charter members have served this Lodge as Worshipful Masters. It has assisted in laying corner-stones of the following public buildings: Bryant Pubiic School, the City Hall, the Post Office, Erie High School; also assisted in the dedication of the Masonic Temple at Johnstown.\n\nMembers, 1960 490\n\nEVANSTON LODGE NO. 24, A.F. & A.M.\n\nEVANSTON, WYOMING\n\nFor a little more than a year, from September 8, 1873 until September 30, 1874, the lodge at Evanston, Wyoming served under dispensation granted by the Grand Lodge of Colorado. Orlando North was Worshipful Master.\n\nHowever, it existed for less than four months as No. 24 of Colorado as it was one of four lodges in Wyoming Territory which formed the Grand Lodge of Wyoming on December 15, 1874.\n\nEvanston Masons were prominent in early Grand Lodge affairs. W. Bro. North, originally a member of the jurisprudence committee, became Grand Master in 1877-78. F. M. Foote, first Grand Treasurer, became Grand Master in 1880-81. R. T. Hilliard was first Junior Grand Steward and a member of the committee on foreign correspondence.\n\nDORIC LODGE NO. 25, A.F. & A.M.\n\nFAIRPLAY, COLORADO\n\nIn January 1874, Grand Master Webster D. Anthony granted a dispensation to a group of 24 Master Masons with James V. Dexter as W.M., Abraham Bergh as S.W., and J. W. Chapel, J.W. Arthur Edgar Jones was the first candidate to receive the three degrees.\n\nOn Sept. 30, 1874, the Lodge received its charter. First officers were Abraham Bergh as W.M., J. Marshall Paul as S.W., and C. G. Hathaway as J.W. The name of Brother Arthur Edgar Jones appears again as he was appointed a Steward.\n\nBrother Abraham Bergh served this Lodge as Worshipful Master on five different occasions and passed away during his fifth term.\n\nFor many years the Lodge met in the Odd Fellows Hall. In 1882 the Odd Fellows loaned No. 25 enough money to make the down payment on the new Temple. which the Lodge still owns.\n\nThe minutes show that No. 25 sent $25 to the Grand Lodge of Louisiana for the benefit of fever stricken Brothers in that State and that in Aug. 1881 several brethren of this Lodge assisted in organizing a Masonic Lodge at Breckenridge. The minutes of the October 7, 1892 state that any member reaching the age of 60 shall be exempt from payment of dues. The records further show that Brother John Z. Walker was elected Master on 7 different occasions and that Brother J. W. Sykes, secretary, served for 17 consecutive years.\n\nThe regular meeting which was held August 7, 1907 was a memorable one. Brother Arthur Edgar Jones, Grand Master, visited his own Lodge where he was made a Mason more than 33 years before. During the 50th anniversary held on Sept. 3, 1924, he was the only living charter member in attendance. On May 16, 1945, M.W. Bro. Jones passed away after having been a Master Mason for 70 years!\n\nIn 1932 Congressman Edward T. Taylor presented No. 25 with a picture of George Washington which still graces the wall of the Lodge. Many familiar names are to be found in the Guest Book, among which are William M. Nelson, W. W. Cooper, Frank D. Allen, C. R. Young, Judge Luxford, C. M. Vaile, Hazlett P. Burke.\n\nThe present financial condition is good. During the 75th anniversary of this Lodge it was reported that more than 1,800 different meetings had been held as of September 30th, 1949. Membership, 1960: 113.\n\nIDAHO SPRINGS LODGE A.F. & A.M. NO. 26,\n\nIDAHO SPRINGS, COLORADO\n\nGrand Master Webster D. Anthony granted the dispensation under date of July 16, 1874 with the following brothers as officers: Worshipful Master, R. D. Stang; Senior Warden, W. A. Ross; and Junior Warden, Robert Ellis. It is interesting to note that there were 21 names on the petition and they came from the following states: Vermont, Indiana, Kansas, California, Illinois, West Virginia, New Jersey, Michigan as well as from three different Colorado Lodges. At the first meeting two petitions were received and the first candidate to receive the first degree was John Moyle.\n\nCharter was received from the Grand Lodge under date of September 22. 1874. During the early years the Lodge met in several different places and finally in December 1884, moved into the Lodge Rooms in the Wilson Building and in May 1890, we purchased this building and to this day it is known as the Masonic Temple. Throughout the years many improvements have been made.\n\nIn June, 1884, Lodges 12, and 48, joined with us in the celebrating of St. John’s Day for the Annual Picnic. Another important date was June, 1888, when electricity was installed in the Temple.\n\nIn December, 1894, Past Master William L. Bush who was made a Master Mason in 1884 was elected Grand Master. Shortly thereafter, he visited his own Lodge and was received with honors. The guest book at this time shows brethren visiting us who were members in Cornwall, England; British North America, and states of Missouri, Michigan, Iowa, Indiana, Pennsylvania, as well as several Lodges from our own state. On many occasions the brethren from the nearby Lodges, Blackhawk, Central City, Nevadaville and Georgetown visited the Lodge and assisted in the work in the several degrees.\n\nOn several occasions this Lodge laid cornerstones both in the town surrounding cities. In 1885, it assisted the Grand Master at the local High School, then again in 1889, assisted at one of the Grade School buildings.\n\nThrough the years it contributed to various funds: notably the Johnstown Flood, the San Francisco earthquake, the Florida flood as well as to several local brethren.\n\nThe minutes of May 23, 1903, show the following motion: “That we celebrate St. John’s Day each year by attending Church” and to this day, that practice has been continued.\n\nIn May, 1932, Brother Samuel M. Smith resigned as secretary after having served this Lodge faithfully for 18 years.\n\nUp to and including August, 1960, it had a total of 2,406 meetings. Twelve of our brethren have received 50 year pins. This record would not be complete if we failed to say that probably the outstanding visitor was the late Brother Charles R. Young, Grand Lecturer, who attended here for 26 straight years, the first time being March 7, 1923.\n\nMembers, 1960 140.\n\nHUERFANO LODGE NO. 27, A.F. & A.M.\n\nWALSENBURG, COLORADO\n\nThis Lodge has rather a unique history in that one of the first white settlers, Henry Daigre, who settled here in 1863 was among those who signed a petition requesting the Grand Master of the State of Colorado for a dispensation for a Masonic Lodge in this community.\n\nThe request was granted on August 25, 1874. The Charter was dated September 22, 1875. During this year 7 Brethren were received either by initiation or affiliation, and 24 names appear as charter members. Some of the familiar names are: Quillian, Unfug, Daigre, Vasquez, Walsen, Levy, DeOlivera.\n\nDuring the first year the Lodge met in the upper story of the building which was occupied by the Walsen & Levy Store. In the next year, Charles Mazzone was constructing a new one-story building in the 700 block on South Main and by verbal agreement the Lodge added a second story. This arrangement proved very satisfactory for the records show that the Lodge met there for the next 35 years.\n\nIn 1884 eleven brethren dimitted and joined in organizing Lodge No. 59 at La Veta.\n\nIn 1901, the Worshipful Master appointed a Building Committee to consider ways and means of building our own Temple. The last meeting held in the old hall was dated June 18, 1910. The first meeting in our new Temple was dated July 2, 1910. The dedication ceremonies took place on September 10 with Grand Master George W. Musser and other Grand Officers in attendance. About 150 persons, Masons, their wives and members of the Eastern Star were in attendance.\n\nThe first candidate to receive his work in the new Temple was Brother John B. Griffis, who afterward served this Lodge so well as its secretary.\n\nThe Lodge has twice been honored by the Grand Lodge. In 1881 Past Master for many terms, Robert A. Quillen, was installed as Grand Master. Then again in 1903, Brother James R. Killian was elevated to the same office.\n\nIn 1917, the annual Past Masters night was inaugurated when Brother Walter R. Shade was Master. It is held annually either on Memorial Day or the Saturday nearest that holiday.\n\nMembers, 1960 260\n\nLAS ANIMAS LODGE NO. 28, A.F. & A.M.\n\nTRINIDAD, COLORADO\n\nThe year 1875 has meant much to Masons of Trinidad and the surrounding district. It was that year that 27 sojourning Master Masons petitioned the Grand Master for a special dispensation which was granted. The first meeting was held with Brothers Gideon B. Cornell as Worshipful Master, Albert G. Stark as Senior Warden and George R. Swallow as Junior Warden, on April 20th. The Grand Lodge granted a charter and the first regular meeting was held September 22, 1875 with the same three brothers serving as officers. The record shows that on November 16, 1875, the Lodge met in the Hall which was owned by M. Biernbaum located in the 200 block on West Main Street.\n\nIn 1877, Brother Stockley D. Hayes set apart 10 acres of his homestead and to this day it is known as the Masonic Cemetery and is being operated by the Mason Cemetery Association. In July, 1891, the Masonic Temple Association was organized and in 1900 the present site was purchased.\n\nAt a regular communication of the Lodge held in December, 1896, the following resolution was adopted: “Any member may become a ‘Life Member’ at the age of 70 if his total assets are less than $15,000.” In 1903, the first Brother received his 50 year jewel. The record does not give his name, however.\n\nBetween the years of 1905 – 1915, No.28 was suffering from growing pains! At the beginning of this period there were 175 members and by the end of 1915, the membership totaled 266 members. According to the minutes, almost every meeting saw the conferring of at least one degree and on many occasions the candidate would receive two degrees!\n\nNo. 28 has taken a prominent part in civic matters. In 1899, The Grand Lodge laid the corner-stone for the Aaron Temple. In 1909, the corner-stone of the new City Hall was laid and the next year the laying of the corner-stone for the new Court House took place. In 1911 the new Temple was completed and was dedicated by the Grand Lodge with more than 700 Brothers in attendance.\n\nOn February 25, 1917, the remains of the first Worshipful Master, Brother Gideon B. Cornell, were laid to rest in the Masonic Cemetery.\n\nOne Past Master, Brother John R. Swinton, was appointed as Grand Senior Steward on September 20, 1939 and was elected ,Most Worshipful Grand Master on September 17, 1947. He passed away while in office on September 10, 1948, just 11 days before his term of office would have expired. His Apron was presented to the Lodge on December 15, 1948.\n\nThe minutes of the regular meeting of February 21, 1950 shows that Mrs. Arthur W. Milliken presented this Lodge with an old family Bible. This Bible was printed in 1792 and bears the name of George Washington as one of the subscribers of that particular printing. It was the custom at that time to print the Bible only after a required number of individuals had subscribed.\n\nMembership, 1960 353\n\nDEL NORTE LODGE NO. 29, A.F. & A.M.\n\nDEL NORTE, COLORADO\n\nDispensation granted September 24, 1875.\n\nCharter granted September 20, 1876.\n\nExtinct.\n\nKING SOLOMON LODGE A.F. & A.M. NO. 30,\n\nLAS ANIMAS, COLORADO\n\nDuring the winter of 1875-76, a number of Masons doing business in the 3 year old town of West Las Animas, a number in the service of the Kansas Pacific Railroad, running from Kit Carson to West Las Animas, and a number of officers and soldiers on duty at Fort Lyon held a meeting for the purpose of organizing a Masonic lodge.\n\nOn February 7, 1876, M.W. Bro. Oren H. Henry granted a dispensation and the first meeting of the lodge under this dispensation was held on February 10, 1876. A charter was granted September 20, 1876, at which time there were 23 charter members. On November 30, 1960 there were 207 members.\n\nDuring its first years the lodge occupied many different meeting places. The desire for their own Temple was strong in the minds of the members and on July 19, 1902, a committee was named to draw up plans for a building. The corner-stone of the new building was laid on September 16, 1909 by M.W. Bro. John B. Haffy. That difficulties were many is attested by the fact that it was not until January 4, 1918 that the Temple was dedicated by iVLW. Bro. L D Crain.\n\nThe lodge has always taken great interest in civic affairs and has also Masonic home for many veterans who have been stationed at Fort Lyon.\n\nMembership, 1960 207\n\nSOUTH PUEBLO LODGE A.F. & A.M. NO.31,\n\nPUEBLO, COLORADO\n\nSouth Pueblo Lodge No. 31 was founded in 1876.\n\nAt that time Pueblo consisted of three villages, Pueblo, Central Pueblo, and South Pueblo. Pueblo Lodge No. 17 was the only Masonic Lodge and met on the North side of the Arkansas River. With many of its members living on the South side, the travel was difficult and dangerous because of the criminal characters lurking in the district.\n\nOne day early in 1876, two Masons, Brothers Chris Wilson and Horace N. Banks, conceived the idea of a Lodge in South Pueblo. The result was that 16 brothers met and explored the idea. This meeting was held at Victoria Hotel, Corner of “13” Street and Victoria Avenue. These brothers, for the “good of the cause,” donated from $15.00 to $25.00 apiece.\n\nOn March 9, 1876 application was made to Pueblo Lodge No. 17 for permission to apply for a dispensation.\n\nDispensation was granted and on March 22, 1876, South Pueblo Lodge U. D. was opened. This meeting was held at 319 South Union with H. N. Banks, W.M.; J J. Thomas, S.W.; J. H. Divelbiss, J.W. Stephan A. Walley was the first man to receive the degrees. The first brother raised after charter was Brother James P. Martel.\n\nThe charter was dated September 20, 1876 and the Lodge was constituted on October 6, 1876.\n\nIn the year 1880, a bridge was erected across the Arkansas River, on Union Avenue. This induced members of No. 31, No. 17 and Commandery No. 12 to combine their efforts in the construction of a Masonic Temple. At the communication of April 21, 1881, the members authorized the purchase of the site of the present Temple at Broadway and Evans Avenue.\n\nOne year from date the Temple was completed, Grand Master Horace N. Banks dedicated the Temple on May 22, 1882. From 1882 to 1893 the Lodge prospered with no financial difficulty. On March 9, 1886 the citizens of Pueblo voted to consolidate the three villages into the City of Pueblo.\n\nIn 1893 South Pueblo Lodge No. 31 sponsored the establishment of Silver State Lodge No. 95. In this year the Temple Association erected a fire station on the rear of the Temple lot and rented it to the City of Pueblo. By March 3, 1904, South Pueblo Lodge No. 31 was completely out of debt. In the year of 1923 an Improvement Program was launched; new rooms were added, the Temple remodeled and a new elevator installed. The cost was about $20,000. This debt was cleared by 1945.\n\nSouth Pueblo Lodge No. 31 has taken an active part in the proceedings of the Grand Lodge in the Laying of Corner-stones: Pueblo County Court House, 1908, Community Chest Bldg., Municipal Golf Course Building, Pueblo Jr. College, Park Hill Jr. High School, Risley Jr. High School, and the Pueblo Police Building.\n\nIn 1949 with Paul Heath, W.M., Ross Leithhead, S.W., Fred Polhill, J.W., Arthur Copley, Secty., the chairs in the Dining Hall were installed. Since that time many other improvements have been made with the Temple being in use practically every day in the week.\n\nMembership, 1960 883.\n\nOLIVE BRANCH LODGE NO. 32, A.F. & A.M.\n\nSAGUACHE, COLORADO\n\nThe first meeting under dispensation was held March 24th, 1877, with I. C. Bassett as W.M., J. G. McOllough, S.W., and Charles Hearn, J.W. At this time Cornelius J. Hart was Grand Master.\n\nCharter was granted September 18, 1877 and the Grand Master appointed Brother E. I. Elliott, Worshipful Master of Del Norte Lodge No. 29, to act for him to constitute Olive Branch Lodge No. 32. Worshipful Brother Elliott, with a number of members of Del Norte Lodge No. 29, constituted this Lodge on October 3, 1877 with J. N. Payton as W.M., Charles Hearn, S.W., and C. W. Baldwin, J.W.\n\nThe first meeting place of the lodge was the room of Centennial Lodge No. 23, I.0.0.F.\n\nThe first recorded visit of a Grand Master to this lodge was June 23, 1900 with 18 Masons present. Joseph W. Milson was the Grand Master.\n\nBrother Charles Tarbell, who has been a member of No. 32 for 49 years, has served some 33 years as Treasurer.\n\nIn the beginning No. 32 met on the 2nd and 4th Saturdays of each month. However, in 1880 a change in the Bylaws permitting them meetings “with the moon” was submitted to the Grand Lodge for its approval, and was granted.\n\nAll through the years, many of the minutes show that this lodge has looked after the welfare of its members, paying for doctors and funerals and helping the distressed not only with financial assistance, but also looking after the moral standing of its members. As early as 1890, the minutes show that this lodge observed St. John’s Day, inviting members of Monte Vista and Del Norte to be guests.\n\nStarting with 17 Charter Members, No. 32 has raised 208 Brothers over the years, 21 have been admitted by affiliation and 77 have dimitted.\n\nThe 1960 membership is 88\n\nSAN JUAN LODGE NO. 33, A.F. & A.M.\n\nSILVERTON, COLORADO\n\nSan Juan Lodge No. 33 received its charter September 18, 1877. First Lodge officers were: John Rogers, W.M.; Edmund T. Sweet, S.W.; Don M. Dana, J.W.\n\nThe location of the first Lodge Room was on the second floor of a two story frame building on the site now occupied by the brick stable of Elton McJunkin on Green or Main Street. The lower floor was occupied by a saloon. The Lodge Room was suitably furnished and the membership multiplied rapidly. On the night of December 18, 1892, a bitterly cold night, a fire started in the saloon and in a few moments enveloped the entire building, burning it completely to the ground. The original charter of the Lodge was saved by strenuous and daring effort; all else, books, records and furniture, was entirely destroyed.\n\nThe second location of the Lodge was on the present site, corner of West 13th Street and Reese Street. It was a rather small two story frame residence building where the local newspaper, The Silverton Miner, was published on the ground floor and a family resided upstairs. This building was acquired from a Building and Loan Association on account of delinquent payments. and remodeled-the upstairs for a lodge room and the lower floor for offices. After a few years, the membership constantly increasing, the Lodge room was found inadequate to accommodate the work being performed. .Members were solicited for donations to enlarge the building and with successful results. The present building now stands as one of the outstanding structures in the city, the lower floor offering rental apartments as a source of revenue. The Lodge room is also used by the Eastern Star, Silverton Chapter No. 54 Royal Arch Masons and Rainbow Girls Assembly No. 75, U. D.\n\nMembers, 1960-73.\n\nCRYSTAL LAKE LODGE NO, 34, A.F. & A.M.\n\nCRYSTAL LAKE, COLORADO\n\nDispensation granted February 19, 1878.\n\nCharter granted September 18, 1878.\n\nMembers November 30,1960 22.\n\nLEADVILLE LODGE NO. 35, A.F. & A.M.\n\nLEADVILLE, COLORADO\n\nThis pertains to Ionic Lodge No. 35 and Leadville Lodge No. 51, now consolidated as Leadville Lodge No. 35. Fourteen Master Masons petitioned for dispensation to form a lodge on June 1, 1878. It was granted and Ionic Lodge No. 35 was chartered October 26, 1878 by Most Worshipful Brother Roger W. Woodbury, Grand Master. The Lodge was constituted and officers installed on November 7, 1878 by Brother J. lVl. Fox who was appointed by the Grand Master to act as his representative. The following were the officers at this time; J. E. Cole, W.M.; H. C. Vaughn, S.W.; William Braden, J.W.\n\nOn December 1, 1881, 24 Master Masons petitioned for dispensation to form a new lodge, which was to become known as Leadville Lodge No. 51. On March 22, 1882, dispensation was granted by Most Worshipful Bro. Robert A. Quillian, Grand Master. First meeting U.D. was held on April 7, 1882 and the lodge was chartered on September 20, 1882, with Robert L. DeLay, W.M.; David H. Dougen, S.W.; and Robert L. Hatten, J.W.\n\nBoth lodges met in the same hall on different nights, sharing the rent. On July 28, 1931, both lodges voted on consolidation, which carried by a unanimous vote. October 1, 1931, was the first meeting of the new lodge known as Leadville Lodge No. 35; the Secretaries and Treasurers of both of the old lodges were ordered to close their books and turn all funds in to the Treasurer of Leadville Lodge No. 35.\n\nThe first meeting place of Ionic Lodge was in the Keystone Block on Jan. 6, 1881. Permission was asked and received to move to 5th and Harrison, where the Court House now stands. On July 15, 1909, a committee was appointed to arrange for a new building at 7th and Harrison, which still remains the meeting place. On October 6, 1910, the corner-stone of the new Masonic Temple was laid and on February 6, 1911 the building was dedicated.\n\nMany important events are listed in the minutes, such as the laying of the corner-stone for the Public Library on Oct. 10, 1902; also the laying of the cornerstone of the Lake County Court House on Aug. 5, 1880. The charter of the lodge was draped for 60 days on Sept. 19, 1901 in memory of our late Bro. William McKinley, President of the United States.\n\nLand for the Masonic Cemetery was purchased April 28, 1880. Many of the old markers are still legible. Original lodge furniture consisting of Altar, officers’ chairs, jewels, staffs, columns, and the unusual ten foot columns are still in use; also the gas lighted letter G. Early officers’ aprons were leather, with blue borders, silver tassels on three sides, emblem of office on bottom and All Seeing Eye on the flap. A gavel made from a walrus tusk and presented to the Lodge by Bro. Jas. K. Darnell of Seattle, Wash., is still in evidence.\n\nAmong the important names in the Lodge are Samuel D. Nicholson, U.S. Senator; Chas. Boettcher, Financier; Franklin Coolbaugh, Pres., American Metals Co.\n\nNo. 35 has furnished four Grand Masters, namely: M.W. Bros. Albert Branch, 1886; John M. Maxwell, 1891; A. A. Burnand, 1899; H. W. Woodward, 1911. Barney L. Whatley was Gr. Orator in 1958. H. W. Woodward was Gr. Treas. for 15 years.\n\nMembers, 1960 175.\n\nROSITA LODGE NO. 36, A.F. & A.M.\n\nROSITA, COLORADO\n\nDispensation granted April 3, 1879.\n\nCharter granted September 17, 1879.\n\nConsolidated with Silver Cliff Lodge No. 38.\n\nOURAY LODGE NO, 37, A.F.&A.M.\n\nOURAY, COLORADO\n\nDispensation granted April 18, 1879.\n\nCharter granted September 17, 1879.\n\nMembers November 30, 1960 70\n\nSILVER CLIFF LODGE NO. 38, A.F. & A.M.\n\nWESTCLIFFE, COLORADO\n\nSometime in the latter part of 1879 or early part of 1880 several brethren of Rosita Lodge No. 36, A. F. & A. M., having moved to Silver Cliff, signed a petition for dispensation to form a Masonic Lodge at Silver Cliff.\n\nThis dispensation was granted and was signed by Grand Master Byron L. Carr, on May 1, 1880.\n\nThe Lodge was instituted on Thursday, May 13, 1880, under the title of Sangre De Cristo Lodge U.D.\n\nSilver Cliff Lodge No. 38 was constituted on Thursday, October 17, 1880, by members of Rosita Lodge No. 36. By special permission of the Grand Lodge, Brother G. S. Adams, a Past Master of Rosita Lodge, was appointed Deputy Grand Master for the occasion. The ceremony took place in the same hall that is used by No. 38 today. In fact, with the exception of a short period of time, February 1, 1886, to September 1, 1887, all meetings of No. 38 have been held in the same building.\n\nOn November 4, 1909, Rosita Lodge No. 36 surrendered its charter and united with Silver Cliff Lodge No. 38. The reason for surrendering its charter was not finances, which is evident by the fact that No. 36 brought with it $1,198.27, but because by 1909 the gold mines had ceased operating around Rosita and most of the members being miners had moved to Silver Cliff where the mines were still in operation.\n\nNo meetings of Silver Cliff Lodge No. 38 were held from May 16 to October 5, 1916, because the hall was being moved to Westcliffe.\n\nOn September 26, 1940, No. 38 celebrated its 60th anniversary.\n\nOn July 14, 1953, No. 38 assisted by Grand Master Hubert Glover and other members of the Grand Lodge laid the corner-stone for the elementary school at Westcliffe.\n\nOn September 24, 1955, No. 38 celebrated its 75th anniversary. Grand Master Aubrey Spann was present for the occasion.\n\nSilver Cliff Lodge No. 38 has had but 49 Masters in its 80 years.\n\n1 Master (E.T. Wadleigh) served 8 times\n\n1 Master (E.W. Eddy) served 5 times\n\n1 Master (John Deitz) served 4 times\n\n1 Master (W.W. Hanssen) served 3 times\n\n15 Masters served 2 times\n\nGUNNISON LODGE NO. 39, A.F. & A.M.\n\nGUNNISON, COLORADO\n\nGunnison Lodge, No. 39 received a special dispensation from Most Worshipful Grand Master Lawrence N. Greenleaf under date of Jan. 1, 1881 and was granted a Charter by the Grand Lodge of Colorado, Sept. 20, 1881 with thirty brothers as charter members.\n\nThe Lodge has held its meetings during the many years of its existence in several different places. On April 13, 1957, the corner-stone for the new Masonic Temple was laid by the Most Worshipful Grand Master D. Aubrey Spann. This was the first time a Grand Master of Masons of Colorado laid the corner-stone of a Masonic Temple of which he was a member.\n\nFor many years the Lodge shared our quarters which is also No. 39. In fact, the Woodmen of the long as it survived was also No. 39.\n\nNo. 39 acknowledges close friendship with special thanks to Crystal Lake Lodge No. 34 and Montrose Lodge No. 63.\n\nBrother D. Aubrey Spann and Brother L. B. Lashbrook both took their obligation for the first degree on the same day in 1928. Brother Spann later became Grand Master of Masons and Brother Lashbrook has served many years as Secretary of the Lodge.\n\n“From a very humble beginning until the present date, the Lodge has grown slowly, but steadily. The heritage of our ancient Brothers which has been handed down from generation to generation is now ours. Let us keep this heritage clear so that we may hand it down to future generations, unblemished, and when our day’s work is done may it be our pleasure to hear from the Great Grand Master of the Universe the welcome words, ‘Well done good and faithful servant, enter Thou into the joy of Thy Lord.”\n\nMembers, 1960 203\n\nPITKIN LODGE NO. 40, A.F. & A.M.\n\nPITKIN, COLORADO\n\nThis Lodge was granted a dispensation February 10, 1881.\n\nChartered September 21, 1881.\n\nIt is now extinct.\n\nSCHILLER LODGE NO.41, A.F. & A.M.\n\nDENVER, COLORADO\n\nIn 1859 there was held, throughout the world, a spontaneous celebration of the 100th anniversary of the birth of Johann Christoph Friedrich Von Schiller, an author of humble birth, who through his championship of freedom, morality a\n\nIn 1881, a group of German speaking Masons wishing to honor this outstanding Mason, requested the Grand Lodge for a dispensation to start a lodge in Denver, using the name of Schiller. They also requested permission to conduct their work in German and keep all records in German writing. Although the dispensation was granted by M.W. Bro. Lawrence N. Greenleaf, Grand Master, the Committee on Charters and Dispensations, differed with the Grand Master in their recommendations to the Grand Lodge, and some took a very definite stand on the matter. However, the action of the Grand Lodge was favorable and on Sept. 21, 1881, Schiller Lodge No. 41 was constituted and the charter was signed by M.W. Bro. Robert A. Quillian, Grand Master, with Adolph Candler as W.M., Chas. F. Miller as S.W., and Herman Wortmann as J.W.\n\nDuring the next 38 years Schiller Lodge continued to do the work in German. However, as many of the younger members could not speak German, some of the sons joined other lodges and in 1919 the change was made to English. There are still many Masons who recall, with pleasure, their visit to this unusual lodge, in its first 38 years.\n\nSchiller Lodge first met in the Fink Bldg. at 15th and Holliday (now Market St.), next to the Old City Hall, on the 4th floor, at 14th and Larimer. Due to a fire, the lodge then moved to the Masonic Temple, 16th and Welton, then to the old EI Jebel Shrine Temple (now Rocky Mountain Consistory), then to the Colorado Consistory Cathedral, 14th and Grant.\n\nMany outstanding Masons have been members of Schiller Lodge No. 41, and their list of Honorary members shows several who are well known to all Masons, namely: M.W. Bro. Hazlett P. Burke, Past Grand Master; M.W. Bro. Adolph S. Walter, Past Grand Master of New Mexico, whose father was a member of Schiller; Luther Van Buskirk, Past Grand Tiler and who has been Tiler for No. 41 for 35 years; also Brothers Jess McCracken and Warren Summers who by virtue of their continued visitations and assistance were added to the list of Honorary members.\n\nMembership, 1960 496\n\nCORINTHIAN LODGE NO. 42, A.F. & A.M.\n\nKOKONIO, COLORADO\n\nOn April 16, 1881, a dispensation was granted to Corinthian, No. 42 and sponsored by Ionic Lodge No. 35 of Leadville. The officers were John N. Harder, W.M.; F. H. Sutherland, S.W.; Albert L. Ordeau, J .W.; and B. C. Ross, Secretary. Their first meeting U.D. was May 3, 1881. On September 19, 1881, the Charter was read and Corinthian Lodge No. 42 duly opened by J. M. Fox acting for Grand Master Robert A. Quillian.\n\nOn Oct. 13, 1881 a disastrous fire destroyed the biggest part of Kokomo including the Lodge Room. On Jan. 11, 1882 with a special dispensation from Ionic Lodge No. 35, the lodge was convened and an election held. A regular meeting was held on Jan. 21, 1882 and business resumed.\n\nOn Aug. 15, 1882 the Brethren rented the Odd Fellows Hall and meetings were held there until September 18, 1888 when the present Temple was purchased.\n\nDuring 1888, No. 42 bought furnishings and refurnished the building; then the Odd Fellows rented from them.\n\nThe dining room has been used for a church, voting place, parties and dances, also for an evening school and a post office.\n\nBro. Ben F. Rich is the one Mason most responsible for not allowing the Charter to lapse, during the lull of mining activities in the area when the resident membership dropped to a minimum of one.\n\nM.W. Grand Master Alphonse A. Burnard visited on July 24,1900.\n\nIn December, 1933, it was found that the acting Treasurer had taken all the money but $6.00. However, he deeded his home to the Lodge and the loss was recovered. On May 25, 1943, Grand Master Howard T. Vaille visited No. 42 and told the Master to “hold on to that Charter” and with the help of lodges of Leadville, Breckenridge, Eagle, Minturn and Fairplay it has been done. This Lodge is the highest in the world except the one in Peru, South America. Many railroads have made their appearance at Kokomo but there is none now. Also of the many Custom Mills and Smelters which were in operation nearby, none remains. At present there are a few mills cutting mine timbers for the mines which are operating.\n\nLoyalty of the members and widespread cooperation of other brethren have united to give Corinthian a current, membership in 1960 151\n\nEAGLE LODGE NO. 43, A.F. & A.M.\n\nMINTURN, COLORADO\n\nEagle Lodge No. 43 was formed at Mitchell, a now-extinct town on the western side of Tennessee Pass. The initial membership, so far as anyone knows, was drawn from the miners, lumbermen and railroaders who were opening up Eagle County. Most of the history relating to its dispensation, and the date of its petition for dispensation, have been lost to our records. The dispensation was issued on April 20, 1881 by Grand Master Lawrence N. Greenleaf.\n\nThe charter was issued at the Grand Lodge communication in 1881, when Robert A. Quillian was Grand Master. It was named for Eagle County, or the Eagle River, which seems to have given its name to the county. It was the first, and for many years the only, Masonic body in the county.\n\nSometime between 1881 and 1901, the Lodge moved from Mitchell to Red Cliff, which was at that time the county seat. In 1901 or 1902, it moved to Minturn. Unfortunately, all the original records, including the charter, were destroyed by fire in 1909 or 1910. There is no record of any meeting between December 4, 1909, and September 2, 1911. The only record which survived the fire was the current minute book, which was in the secretary’s home at the time.\n\nOn August 10, 1916, the present hall was purchased. The first communication ,in the new hall was held on November 17, 1917.\n\nGeorge E. Simonton, Master in 1892 and 1893, was Grand Master in 1912.\n\nALAMOSA LODGE NO. 44, A.F. & A.M.\n\nALAMOSA, COLORADO\n\nThe first recorded minutes of No. 44 are dated May 19th, 1881 with Albert Adler as Worshipful Master and Thomas M. Finley as Secretary. At this meeting two Petitions were presented. Brother M. Borosh was the first candidate to receive the three degrees. On November 5th of the same year, this Lodge received its Charter. The first Masonic Funeral was held two years later, May 1883.\n\nThe minutes of a meeting in Deccmber, 1884, contain the following two new rules: 1. “There is to be no smoking in the Lodge Hall.” 2. “The candidate for the Master Mason Degree must no longer be required to set up a free dinner for all who attend his initiation.”\n\nA great day, September 14, 1887, for No. 44: the laying of the corner-stone of our new Temple located at the corner of San Juan and Main Streets by the Grand Master of Masons for the State of Colorado!\n\nIn 1919 the Lodge secured a burial plot in the City Cemetery. About this time, the San Luis Valley Masonic Association established a beautiful campsite known as Masonic Park, located several miles above South Fork. It was operated by this Association until 1940. In 1920, there were 125 initiated to the First Degree and 62 were raised. Brother Gilbert Sheesley was the Worshipful Master.\n\nIn 1921 a member of the Lodge, Marshall H. VanFleet was elected Grand Master. Many well known names appear on the Guest Book, among which are Chief Justice John Adams, Chris Wallrich, Historian, and ‘Governor Ralph Carr.\n\nOver a period of these many years several Brothers have received 50 year pins. Among them are: W. A. Dudley, Chris Wallrich, Ira Richardson, Harry Good, Vic Bracket and Herb Curtis.\n\nThe Lodge held its meetings in several different places but the year 1956 saw the original mortgage paid in full. The Temple has been rebuilt and enlarged on two occasions.\n\nIn the Minutes of a meeting held in August 1894 the following item was recorded: “A Brother requested a loan of $20 which request was denied by the Lodge, however, immediately after the Brothers rasiesd the necessary amount and gave it to the needy Brother.”\n\nIn 1907, the Lodge laid the corner-stone for the First Baptist Church.\n\nMembership, 1960 331\n\nBOULDER LODGE NO. 45, A.F. & A.M.\n\nBOULDER, COLORADO\n\nThe population of Boulder mushroomed from 363 in 1868 to 3,063 in 1880. And just twelve years and seven months after Columbia No. 14 moved to Boulder, twenty Master Masons petitioned for a new lodge.\n\nAllen’s History of Masonry in Colorado regarded it “as a good thing for Masonry at large, a good move for the members of Boulder 45, and especially a great help to its ancestor, Columbia 14, because of the noble rivalry or rather emulatior we have so often heard about.”\n\nMany dimits accompanying the application were official and ornate document while others were simple hand-written documents on plain note paper. The dispensation was dated June 25, 1881. T. R. Palmer was Worshipful Master.\n\nThe fine spirit that has always existed between the two lodges was evident in an immediate proposal that the new group might use Columbia’s hall, jewels, and furniture temporarily for only $8 a month.\n\nThe Grand Lodge chartered Boulder No. 45 on September 21, 1881. M. W. Bro Wyman constituted the lodge and installed its officers two days later. Charter members had affiliated from Wisconsin, Iowa, Vermont, Massachusetts, Georgia, Michigan, Ohio, New York, Maine, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and other Colorado lodges.\n\nDuring the early financial struggles, when money had to be borrowed from the bank, A. M. Sawyer, “that treasurer among treasurers” advanced interest on the loan from his own pocket. No wonder he was elected 33 times!\n\nW. S. Bellman was secretary 23 terms starting in 1894. He was often called the “Past Master without a pin” for he could present all the lectures and do all the work but was so busy being secretary he had no time to be Master.\n\nThe first joint installation of officers with Columbia No. 14 occurred in 1884 and has continued until the present. The installing teams have had long periods of service. M. W. Bro. J. A. Davis ended 21 years as installing Grand Master in 1930 W. Bro. Sam Wylam served as installing Marshal for 20 years ending in 1935. Since then M. W. Bros. C. Wheeler Barnes and William R. “Pop” Arthur have officiated most of the time.\n\nThe cornerstone of the first Masonic Temple was laid on March 19th, 1894 Three special trains brought visiting Masons.\n\nThe two lodges conferred the Third degree at Grand Lodge in 1897. In 1913 Grand Lodge officers came to Boulder and conferred the same degree at a joint communication. Grand Lecturer Wm. W. Cooper acted as Worshipful Master.\n\nOn July 4, 1932 the lodge assisted in “relaying” the same cornerstone of the County Courthouse which had first been laid 50 years before on July 4, 1882. When the building was destroyed by fire in early 1932, the original cornerstone was not damaged.\n\nFire destroyed the Boulder Temple in 1944. A new Temple was built with members donating stone, lumber, and other materials and the members offering their services as “operative Masons.” The attractive, well-designed building was free of debt in 1952.\n\nDURANGO LODGE NO. 46, A.F. & A.M.\n\nDURANGO. COLORADO\n\nThe town of Durango was platted and laid out in the year of 1880. On a day in early spring 1881, Captain William C. Davidson chanced into conversation with two men, Charles M. Hilliker and John C. Miles. It became apparent during this conversation that each was a member of the Craft, whereupon it was agreed that a survey among the male members of the town would be made to determine the number of Masons therein. More than thirty claimed Masonic affiliation.\n\nA few days later an informal meeting was held and a petition, containing eleven names was prepared, and on receipt of a recommendation from San Juan Lodge No. 33 at Silverton, both were dispatched to the Most Worshipful Grand Master of Masons in Colorado.\n\nOn July 2, 1881 Most Worshipful Grand Master Lawrence N. Greenleaf granted a dispensation to the brethren of Durango to form a regular Lodge under the name of Durango Lodge U. D. The first regular meeting was held July 6, 1881.\n\nThe Lodge failed to petition the Grand Lodge for a charter at the 21st Annual Communication, September 20, 1881, but did return the dispensation, recorcIs and bylaws and also paid the Grand Lodge dues. The Grand Lodge Charters Committee report states, “we make no recommendation concerning a charter.” Later in the same session of the Grand Lodge it was moved and passed that “the Grand ,Master be authorized to issue a charter to said Lodge provided a regular petition be received prior to 60 days after above date.”\n\nOn November 1, 1881 the petition was received by the Grand Master and the charter granted November 2, 1881. On November 10, 1881 the Lodge was constituted by W. Bro. Charles M. Hilliker who had been appointed by Most Worshipful Brother Robert A. Quillian as Deputy Grand Master for this occasion.\n\nTwo brethren of this Lodge have been Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Colorado: Most Worshipful Brother Jethro C. Sanford in 1893 and William S. Pickerill in 1913. Charles L. Young served as Grand Lecturer from 1922 to 1950.\n\nMembers November 30, 1960 404\n\nBRECKENRIDGE LODGE NO. 47, A.F. & A.M.\n\nBRECKENRIDGE, COLORADO\n\nBreckenridge Lodge was granted a special dispensation by the Grand Lodge of Colorado, Aug. 27, 1881, with Worshipful Brother John Boylan acting as Worshipful Master. On Sept. 20, 1882 it was chartered with John Boylan as Worshipful Master, W. F. Eberline as Senior Warden, C. H. Blair as Junior Warden; L. B. Smart, R. H. Manzing, Roderick Mineun and F. B. Walles all as charter members.\n\nDuring the early years, the Lodge’s progress reflected the conditions and the economy of the era. However about 1906 the Lodge began to take on a “New Look.” At this time there were but 17 members, but they managed to purchase another building and moved into it. Then in 1917, they voted to purchase all new Lodge furniture. Another notable occasion occurred in 1933 when the Grand Lecturer, late Brother Charles L. Young, presented the Lodge with a new Bible and it graces the altar to this day.\n\nFrom year to year, the members made improvements to the building. The main lodge room was enlarged, the ante-rooms also were enlarged and finally a kitchen and dining room were installed.\n\nIn 1916, the Lodge purchased a tract of land containing about seven acres which has since been known as the Masonic Cemetery.\n\nNo. 47 wishes to acknowledge close friendship with the following Lodges: Blackhawk No. 11, Georgetown No. 12, ldaho Springs No. 26, Doric No. 24, Leadville No. 35, Eagle Lodge No. 43, and Corinthian Lodge No. 42.\n\nSpecial thanks go to Brother Martin. Waltz who was Worshipful Master during the years of 1910-1916. In 1957 when we celebrated our 75th anniversary, there were seven Brothers present 78 years or older, one of whom, Brother Bernard Hettie, had received all three degrees in this lodge during 1901.\n\nBetween 1881 and 1957,302 applicants received all three degrees of the order. One thousand six hundred ninety-eight stated communications, 374 special and 23 emergent communications were held. A total of 32 Brothers were received by affiliation and 46 Brothers dimitted.\n\nThrough the years the Lodge has been very proud of the part it played in public affairs. The corner-stone of the Court House was laid in 1906. G. B. Folsom donated the trowel for this occasion.\n\nMembers of this lodge have been instrumental for several decades in he!ping the Grand Lodge preserve the traditions of early Colorado Masonry. Picnics and dinners have been held in conjunction with the Grand Lodge pilgrimages to the site of Summit No.2 at Parkville and the visits to Corinthian No. 42 at Kokomo.\n\nThe original furnishings and guest register excite much comment from visitors.\n\nMembers, 1960 133\n\nGEORGETOWN LODGE NO. 48, A.F. & A.M.\n\nGEORGETOWN, COLORADO\n\nThis Lodge was granted dispensation November 26, 1881 and chartered September 20, 1882, worked a few years and then consolidated with Washington Lodge No. 12. Washington kept the No. 12 and the name Georgetown was used, making the lodge, Georgetown Lodge No. 12. (See No. 12’s History.)\n\nMT. PRINCETON LODGE A.F. & A.M. NO. 49,\n\nBUENA VISTA, COLORADO\n\nIn the fall of 1881 several prominent men of Buena Vista and the immediate area began to talk in separate groups of two or more about organizing a lodge of Free and Accepted Masons in Buena Vista. A tentative survey was made by interested persons and it was determined that there were at least twenty-one Master Masons from Grand Jurisdictions extending from Maine and Vermont to Illinois, Nebraska, Ohio, Louisiana, Wyoming and Colorado. An informal meeting was called for the evening of October 7, 1881 at the Odd Fellows Hall to discuss the idea. All twenty-one persons present were in unanimous agreement to organize. The first order of business was to appoint a committee to solicit money from each person to purchase furnishings and a second committee to arrange for a meeting place. The meeting was then adjourned to October 12, 1881.\n\nAt the meeting of October 12th, it was reported $25.00 had been subscribed and the Odd Fellows had agreed to lease their hall for Masonic use. It was then moved to petition the Grand Lodge of Colorado A. F. & A. M. for dispensation, to be known as Buena Lodge. October 15, 1881 another meeting was held and it was decided to petition for dispensation as Mount Princeton U.D. with J. E. Cole as Worshipful Master; P. J. Coston, Senior Warden; A. H. Wade, Junior Warden; A. G. Watson, Treasurer; H. W. Cole, Secretary; Thomas Campbell, Senior Deacon; G. S. Wood, Junior Deacon; W. B. Mason, Senior Steward; M. J. Marks, Junior Steward; and Samuel Wade, Tiler.\n\nFred A. Walters received the first degree on 1882, M.W. Bro. Frank Church, Grand Master Mount Princeton Lodge No. 49, A.F. & A.M., February 16, 1882. September 20, of Colorado, granted a charter to Buena Vista, Colorado.\n\nMount Princeton, while in its infancy, managed to struggle through many trying sessions. Mining was in a depressing situation. There were many suspensions for non-payment of dues and benevolent cases were a burden to the Lodge. Considerable effort was expended to have enough members present to hold a regular communication. Year on year the annual report of the Treasurer reported less than One Hundred dollars in the Treasury.\n\nDuring the early 1900’s, through World War I, Mount Princeton continued to have diffIcult years and this was much the same pattern through the 1920’s and 1930’s. It is to be noted during the 1940’s a noticeable growth was made in membership as well as the financial condition. January 25, 1945 permission was granted by the Grand Master for Mount Princeton Lodge No. 49 to purchase the Lodge building. The lodge became debt free on February 14, 1952, following payment for extensive remodeling of the lodge quarters after the purchase.\n\nPresently Mount Princeton Lodge No. 49 is enjoying fInancial stability, high percentage of attendance, proficient ritualistic work and traditional Masonic fellowship.\n\nMembership November 30, 1960 104\n\nGARFIELD LODGE NO. 50, A.F. & A.M.\n\nERIE, COLORADO\n\nThe first meeting was held Feb. 8, 1882 under dispensation of the M.W.

A. Craft.\n\nAs far as can be ascertained the Brothers of Garfield Lodge No. 50 met in the Odd Fellows Hall in Erie, the same place in which they now meet.\n\nSome of the old minute books are missing.\n\nLate Brother Wm. Whiles was Grand Tiler in 1937.\n\nMembership, 1960 81\n\nLEADVILLE LODGE NO. 51, A.F. & A.M.\n\nLEADVILLE, COLORADO\n\nDispensation granted March 22, 1882.\n\nCharter granted September 20, 1882.\n\nConsolidated with Ionic Lodge No. 35.\n\nTIN CUP LODGE NO. 52, A.F. & A.M.\n\nTIN CUP, COLORADO\n\nDuring the early “Eighties” when Tin Cup was a boom town, several Masons residing in this district got together and petitioned the Grand Master for a dispensation. Grand Master Robert A. Quillian signed it on August 18, 1882. Brother A. F. Pettengill was designated Worshipful Master, Ben F. Martin as Senior Warden and George S. White as Junior Warden. The first meeting was held Aug. 26th in the Gray Building, owned by a Lodge member.\n\nThe first funeral was held January 3, 1883 when our Junior Warden Brother George S. White was buried with Masonic Honors.\n\nEarly that same year, the Lodge purchased two lots and several months later the new Masonic Building was completed. Early in Sept. the Lodge received its charter from the Grand Lodge and moved into the new home. The charter contained a total of 24 names.\n\nThe Lodge continued as an active Lodge until February 26, 1895 when the Masonic Temple Building Committee deeded the property to the Grand Lodge and surrendered its charter.\n\nEarly in 1902, the building was sold to the Tin Cup Mercantile Co. In connection with the sale, an unusual incident occurred, one of the older brothers objected very seriously to the sale and tried to burn the building. However, the fire was discovered in time and no real damage occurred.\n\nLOVELAND LODGE NO. 53, A.F. & A.M.\n\nLOVELAND, COLORADO\n\nLoveland Lodge was formed by the following members, George M. Harris, Worshipful Master, a civil war veteran; Thomas Gross, farmer and horse breeder; David W. Miller, farmer; William B. Sutherland, doctor; Jefferson McAnelly, lawyer and later County Judge; John J. Burke, clothing store manager; Edwin M. Currier, probably a farmer; James Sullivan, “came west with family in spring of 1862, located near Bear Creek south of Denver, and later moved to vicinity of Loveland became County Commissioner.” ‘Watrous states in his history of Larimer County “He was a man of few words, but inflexible purpose, a hater of shams and a rigid adherent of right in all relations of Life”; Obediah Smith, Justice of the Peace and former school teacher; Aaron S. Benson, Bank President, also State Representative; John W. Ansell; Jerry Quigley, orchardist; Joseph B. Middleton, stage driver to Estes Park. First meetings were held in the I.O.O.F. Hall, Loveland, Colorado, or as it was originally called, Old St. Louis, a settlement twenty-three years old when the lodge was instituted. The above named brethren signed the petition for dispensation. The dispensation was granted April 17, 1883 and the charter was granted September 18, 1883 at the Grand Lodge Annual Communication, at which meeting Most Worshipful Brother Frank Church presided as Grand Master.\n\nThe Lodge was constituted during the term of Most Worshipful Brother Andrew Sagendorf who deputized George E. Wyman to actually constitute Loveland No. 53. This Lodge was named for the town in which it met, as were many of our Colorado Lodges.\n\nThe first jewels of the officers were donated by Collins Lodge No. 19, however there were some hand made jewels used previously which are in the museum of Loveland Lodge and can be seen at any time.
