        "text": "Four athletes at Forest Park School District D91 made history as they brought home medals from the Special Olympics Illinois Spring Games, the first time the district participated in the event.\n\nThe Special Olympics Illinois Spring Games was held at the end of April in Aurora, Illinois.\n\nThe four student athletes — or “Trailblazers,” as they are known — Giuliana “Gigi” Mason, 8, Josiah Milton, 11, Ivan Nhial, 10, and Immanuel “Captain” McKoy, 15, received four gold medals, as well as five silver medals across various track and field events.\n\nAt the May 9 school board meeting, the athletes were honored by the board of education, where they were presented with trophies, which included a plush Sonic the Hedgehog as a gift from the district.\n\n“When I came to see them one of the first things Immanuel said to me was ‘I am going to run like Sonic,’ so hence the Sonic,” said Supt. Elizabeth Álvarez, as the crowd cheered for the students.\n\nThree of the athletes also qualified for the upcoming State Games, which will be held from June 7-9 in Normal, Illinois.\n\nGigi will be competing in the 50M run. Immanuel will compete in both the softball throw and the 100M run. And Josiah will compete in the 50M run.\n\n“Their dedication, positivity, and hard work paid off,” Álvarez said. “For their incredible efforts and for inspiring us all. They are the reason why we have our Special Olympics here and it was another milestone to finally involve our students with Special Olympics.”\n\nThe team trained under the guidance of Daniel Dugan, P.E. teacher, as well as Amy Mills, third grade special education teacher.\n\n“The Special Olympics are an amazing opportunity for our athletes to show what they can do,” Dugan said. “Coaching our team with Amy Mills and tons of help from Nurse Erika has been incredibly rewarding. I know that our positive experience and successes this inaugural season will lead to growth in our program moving forward.”\n\nMills said it was rewarding to see the hard work pay off.\n\n“The Special Olympics is truly a remarkable organization and are very excited about all of the possibilities and opportunities it will bring the students of Forest Park,” Mills said.\n\nVictoria Egizio, assistant director of student services, also attended the event and said it was a wonderful experience to both get to attend and for those who got to participate, adding the event was “remarkable.”\n\n“It was heartwarming and empowering to observe our D91 Trailblazers in action and to see all the supporters who came to cheer them on!”\n\nThe dedication the students displayed wasn’t lost on district administrators, as David McKhiel, director of student services, said he was proud and commended the coaches and athletes for their performance.\n\n“The commitment, passion, and dedication have exemplified the very best of our school community,” he said. “Through these remarkable achievements, you have not only demonstrated an extraordinary accomplishment but also demonstrated the values of inclusion, determination, and sportsmanship.”\n\n“Your inspiring performances have left a mark, inspiring us all to strive for greatness and embrace diversity,” he said."
