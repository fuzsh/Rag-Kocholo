        "text": "Morals and Dogma - Albert Pike (1871)\n\nThe Builders - Joseph Fort Newton (1914)\n\nThe Principles of Masonic Law - Albert G. Mackey\n\nMasonic History\n\nIntroduction\n\n- The Temple of Solomon or De templo Hierosolymitano by Jacob Judah Aryeh Leon Templo -\n\nEarly traces of movements related to freemasonry already existed in England during the Elizabethan era (1558-1603 CE), the rule of the Roman Catholic House of Stuart (1603-1649 and 1660-1688 CE) and the Commonwealth of England (1649 to 1660 CE). Relations developed between masons and nascent democratic movements, as each lodge set up a polity where an individual's standing was meant to be based on merit, rather than on birth or wealth. Freemasonry also became part of the rising cosmopolitan movement of the 17th century and its claim of universal brotherhood (see also The Occult Philosophy in the Elizabethan Age, Frances Yates, Routledge, 1979 and The Origins of Freemasonry, Facts and Fictions, Margaret C. Jacob, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007 and Strangers Nowhere in the World, The Rise of Cosmopolitanism in Early Modern Europe, Margaret C. Jacob, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006).\n\nSeveral philosophical and political movements which were active around this time would influence the establishment of speculative freemasonry. Supporters of both the Roman Catholic House of Stuart and the Protestant House of Hannover, were involved in the development of early freemasonry. The adherents of the House of Stuart would be moved into the background by the supporters of the House of Hannover. The philosophical and political ideas associated with the Protestant Hannoverians would dominate the establishment of the Grand Lodge of London and Westminster in 1717. The Grand Lodge of London and Westminster was founded after the protestant George Louis, elector of Hanover (1660-1727 CE), succeeded to the British crown, as George I on 1 August 1714 and the end of the Jacobite Rising of 1715 by Tory rebels. The first group of \"Hannoverian\" freemasons were mostly Whigs and Newtonians. The Whigs' origin lay in constitutional monarchism (see also Aristotle on Politeia in his Athenaion Politeia and Politics) and opposition to the absolute rule of the House of Stuart (divine-right theory of kingship). The Whigs took full control of the government in 1715, and the \"Whig Supremacy\" would last from 1715 until 1760. It was enabled by the Hanoverian succession of George I in 1714 and the failed Jacobite rising of 1715.\n\nMasonic mythology\n\nIn order to claim legitimacy, the legendary history of freemasonry had to start in an ancient 'Golden Age' or in 'Paradise' (FWIW). European mythology has a tradition of stages of human existence, which tend to progress from an original, long-gone age in which humans enjoyed peace, brotherhood, prosperity, and happiness, compared to the current age and miseries of human civilization. Several legends about the origins of freemasonry can be related to this pattern (\"argumentum ad antiquitatem\"). The legendary history of freemasonry served as a 'mythomoteur' or constitutive myth that provided (modern) freemasonry with a sense of purpose. The legendary history constituted freemasonry through narrative and they bound freemasons into a collective consciousness. Robert Cover (1943-1986 CE) in Nomos and Narrative, wrote that \"we inhabit a 'nomos' - a normative universe. We constantly create and maintain a world of right and wrong, of lawful and unlawful, of valid and void\". Ernst Cassirer (1874-1945 CE) wrote that myth is “the art of expressing, and that means of organizing, [man’s] most deeply rooted instincts, his hopes and fears.” (see also The Supreme Court, 1982 Term -- Foreword: Nomos and Narrative, Robert M. Cover, Faculty Scholarship Series, 2705, Yale Law School, 1983 and The myth of the state, Ernst Cassirer, Yale University Press, 1977).\n\nThere are two story lines, one in the Egyptian-Graeco-Roman tradition, the other one in the Egyptian-Semitic tradition. The Greeks and Romans had their Ages of Man and the Abrahamic traditions have their paradise in the Garden of Eden. In The Constitutions of the Free-Masons (1723 and 1738) the history of freemasonry started with Adam in the Garden of Eden. The oldest (European) legends go back to ancient Egypt. Several legends state that the origin of Freemasonry go back to the Mystery Schools of Ancient Egypt. The Greek philosopher Pythagoras is traditionally thought to have been initiated in the Egyptian mysteries, where he learned about geometry. Some relate the origins of freemasonry to the Greco-Roman mysteries, such as the Eleusinian Mysteries of Greece or Roman Mithraism. Some relate Freemasonry to the Associations in Ancient Rome, such as the 'collegia opificum' (trade guilds) with the 'Collegia Fabrorum', which were believed to have been instituted by Numa Pompilius (753-673 BCE). Some relate freemasonry to the Essenes. Johann Georg Wachter (1673-1757 CE) in his Der Spinozismus im Judentum: Oder die von dem heutigen Judentum und dessen geheimen Kabbala vergötterte Welt (1699 CE), puts the Essenes in the natural theology and Deist tradition whose tradition could be traced back to Egypt and Jewish Kabbalah (Hanegraaff, 2014, p. 213; Florian, 1999, pp. 282-286; Freemasons, 1877, p. 122). Karl Friedrich Stäudlin (1761-1826 CE) is his Geschichte der Sittenlehre Jesu linked the Essenes to Pythagoras (Stäudlin, 1799, pp. 484-485; Hanegraaff, 2014, p. 214; T. S. Beall, 2004, p. 132; W.A. Laurie, 1859, p. 22). Freemasonry as an organization is also believed to have its roots in Rosicrucianism, which arose in (Protestant) Europe in the early 17th century and which was in itself an mixture of (Christian) Kabbalah, Hermeticism, alchemy, and mystical Christianity (Semitic/Abrahamic tradition) (Frances Yates, 2001). Thomas Paine (1736-1809 CE), in his essay On The Origin Of Free Masonry (1818 CE), traced the origins of Freemasonry to the religion of the ancient Druids (S. Afsai, 2010). (see also History of Freemasonry 1898, Volume 2, Albert G. MacKey, William R. Singleton, Kessinger, p. 485 and Stolen Legacy, Ch. VII: The Curriculum of the Egyptian Mystery System, George G. M.

Legend has it that Freemasonry was founded at the building of Solomon's temple by King Solomon (ca. 970-ca. 931 BCE), which itself was inspired by Egyptian Temples. Isaac Newton (1642-1727 CE) believed Solomon's temple to be an example of the ancient Prytaneion (Betty Jo Teeter Dobbs, 2002, p. 153 and Stephen G. Miller, 1977). Solomon's temple also relates Freemasonry to the Knights Templar. Chevalier Andrew M. Ramsay (1686-1743 CE) Grand Orator of the Stuart freemasonry with his Oration of 21 March 1737 (or 'Discourse of le Chevalier Ramsay given at the St.John's Lodge on 27th December 1736') would relate Stuart freemasonry to the Knights Templar. The legend of the Knights Templar would also relate freemasonry to the Essene and Pythagorean tradition (Todd S. Beall, 2004, p. 132). The Esseness learned about Pythagoreanism, and the Knights Templar brought this knowledge to Scotland where it became part of Scottish freemasonry (Hanegraaff, 2014, pp. 215-216). During the early medieval period, the Magistri Comacini were Lombard stonemasons organized in guilds. The Old Charges relate freemasonry to the masons' lodges which were involved in building the European cathedrals and which dealt with geometry (architecture) as one of the seven liberal arts (Medieval and Greco-Roman tradition). (see also Chapters of Masonic History, Part VI. Freemasonry and the Comacine Masters, H.L. Haywood, The Builder Magazine, October 1923 - Volume IX - Number 10 and The Janus Faces of Genius: The Role of Alchemy in Newton's Thought, Betty Jo Teeter Dobbs, Cambridge University Press, 2002 and Josephus' Description of the Essenes Illustrated by the Dead Sea Scrolls, Todd S. Beall, Cambridge University Press, 2004 and The Prytaneion: Its Function and Architectural Form Hardcover, Stephen G. Miller, Univ of California Press, 1977 and Esotericism and the Academy Rejected Knowledge in Western Culture, Wouter J. Hanegraaff, Cambridge University Press, 2014).\n\nFrom the reformation to the Grand Lodge of London and Westminster\n\nThe protestant reformation and the European wars of religion would cause bloodshed and social and political instability in Europe. The Thirty Years' War would ravage central Europe. The English Reformation and the English Civil War (1642-1651 CE) would cause destruction and bloodshed on the Islands. Several attempts were made to resolve the situation and to live thorough desperate times. Justus Lipsius (1547-1606 CE) wrote his De Constantia in publicis malis (1583 CE) as an attempt to reconcile Stoicism and Christianity, which became known as Neostoicism (R. B. Wernham, 1968). Guillaume du Vair (1556-1621 CE) wrote his neostoic La Philosophie morale des Stoiques (1585 CE) and De la constance et consolation ès calamités publiques (1589 CE). During the early 17th century Rosicrucianism, associated with Lutheranism, (Christian) Kabbalah, Neoplatonism, Hermeticism, alchemy, and mystical Christianity, was believed to be a a philosophical secret society resembling an early predecessor of freemasonry. Although most historical documents of 17th century freemasonry are lost, it was most likely associated with the Catholic House of Stuart in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland. The members of the House of Stuart tended to be carriers of Freemasonry which would (presumably) develop into Ecossais freemasonry during their exile after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Another element was the role of the new educated urban classes of urban England in public affairs and government. Among the founders of the Grand Lodge of London and Westminster were members of the Royal Society, and Huguenot emigres, who flocked to England after the Revocation of the Edicts of Nantes by Louis XIV (1638-1715 CE) in 1685 CE (see also The New Cambridge Modern History: Volume 3, Counter-Reformation and Price Revolution, 1559-1610, R. B. Wernham, CUP Archive, 1968, p. 443) and The Rosicrucian Enlightenment, Frances Yates, Routledge; 2nd edition, 2001 and Restoring the Temple of Vision: Cabalistic Freemasonry and Stuart Culture, Marsha Keith Schuchard, BRILL, 2002 and Freemasonry and the House of Stuart, Albert Gallatin Mackey, William R. Singleton, Lightning Source, 2005 and The History of Freemasonry: Its Legendary Origins, Albert Gallatin Mackey, Courier Corporation, 2012, p. 279 and The articulate citizen and the English Renaissance, Arthur B. Ferguson, Duke University Press, 1965, pp. 402-409).\n\nRobert Moray (1608 or 1609-1673 CE) was initiated into Freemasonry on 20 May 1641. Elias Ashmole (1617-1692 CE) on 16 October 1646 was admitted as a Freemason. Robert Moray and Elias Ashmole, both supporting the Roman Catholic House of Stuart, were part of the founding members of the Royal Society (see also Restoring the temple of vision: Cabalistic freemasonry and Stuart culture, Marsha Keith Schuchard, p. 581, 2002). Sir Robert Moray (1608 or 1609-1673 CE) was the first acting president of the Royal Society from its first meeting on 28 November 1660 to its incorporation on 15 July 1662. He presented the Charter of the Society to Charles II (1630-1685 CE) and obtained his approval (see also Freemasonry and the Birth of Modern Science, Robert Lomas, Fair Winds Press, 2003 and Sir Robert Moray, F.R.S. (1608?-1673), D. C. Martin, Notes and Records of the Royal Society of London Vol. 15, (Jul., 1960), pp. 239-250). The Bohemian Revolt (1618-1620 CE) would start the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648 CE). The defeat of Bohemian protestants in the Thirty Years' War would cause an influx of refugees into protestant England. People like Amos Johannes Comenius (1529-1670 CE) and Samuel Hartlib (ca. 1600-1662 CE) would bring new ideas to England (The Crisis of the Seventeenth Century: Religion, the Reformation and Social Change, Hugh Trevor-Roper, 1967 and From Counter-Reformation to Glorious Revolution, Hugh Trevor-Roper, 1992). Amos Johannes Comenius (1529-1670 CE) in his Via Lucis, Vestigata & Vestiganda (The Way of Light) (1641) put forward the pursuit of higher learning and spiritual enlightenment bound together. He referred to reading three books: liber homo, liber mundi, liber Theos. His magnum opus was De Rerum Humanarum Emendatione Consultatio Catholica (General discourse on the emendation of human affairs, or Consultatio) (1670) contained a plan for the creation of a Christian society. Comenius discussed the universal education for all men and the art of teaching was intended to be the core of pansophy (Jan Amos Comenius, Jean Piaget, UNESCO, International Bureau of Education, vol. XXIII, no. 1/2, 1993, p. 173-96 and Pansophiae prodromus, Jan Amos Comenius, 1639 and Pansophiae diatyposis, Jan Amos Comenius, 1643)).\n\nIn the seventeenth century philosophy and theology would undergo profound changes. Early seventeenth century philosophy is often called the Age of Reason or Age of Rationalism and preceded the Enlightenment. Emerging Deism saw God as the Great Architect of the Universe or a God who does not interfere in human affairs, but whose very nature orders and structures all of creation. God's power (potentia Dei) could be described as 'potentia dei absoluta' or 'potentia dei ordinata'. God could either override all that had been done or God was bound by his past actions and could not undo what had been done. Theists adhered to the first view, while Deists preferred the second viewpoint, which had enormous consequences on philosophical and scientific positions. For those who adhered to 'potentia dei ordinata', the world could be known with certainty as God would never chance the laws of nature or undo what had been done (J.R Wigelwsorth, 2009, p. 6-7). Isaac Newton (1642-1727 CE) in the 'General Scholium' of the second edition of his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1713 CE) would put forward a characterization of the \"Lord God παντοκρατωρ, or Universal Ruler\" against the (passive) Deistic image of God. Deism as a theology can be seen as a successor to the teachings of Giordano Bruno (1548-1600 CE), John Dee (1527-1608 or 1609 CE) and John Amos Comenius (1592-1670 CE), which also advocated a world brotherhood of harmony and peace, but without the risk of offending scientists or (protestant) theologians. The idea of a world brotherhood of harmony and peace goes back to the Cynic and Stoic κοσμοπολίτης, meaning \"citizen of the world\" (Diogenes Laertius, Βίοι καὶ γνῶμαι τῶν ἐν φιλοσοφίᾳ εὐδοκιμησάντων, VI 63). Jean Bodin (1530-1596 CE), Pierre Charron (1541-1603 CE), and Lord Edward Herbert of Cherbury (1583-1648 CE) developed a Deistic view on the position of man and a form of natural religion. Jean Bodin in his Colloquium Heptaplomeres de rerum sublimium arcanis abditis (1683) developed a view on natural religion. Seven speakers represented as many different religions, confessions, and philosophical schools of thought of which the character Toralbe presents natural religion as follows \"the laws of Nature and natural religion, which nature inspires in the heart, are sufficient for salvation\". Pierre Charron was a close friend of Michel de Montaigne (1533-1592 CE) who was influenced by Pyrrhonic skepticism and Stoicism. Pierre Charron in De la sagesse (1601 CE) wrote about the religious duty of the sage, which influenced the Deists of the seventeenth century and their view on the superstitions of mankind, idolatry and religious ceremonies. De la sagesse presented one of the first modern ethical systems to establish a basis for morality independent of religion, founded essentially on Stoic theories and the recognition and development of humanity's natural character. Edward Herbert of Cherbury wrote De Veritate, prout distinguitur a revelatione, a verisimili, a possibili, et a falso (1624 CE) in which he put forward the common notions of religion in five articles, which became the charter of the English deists. These five articles contained the whole doctrine of the religion of reason, which also formed the primitive (original) religion. What is contrary to these five articles was also contrary to reason. Although there exists revelation beyond reason, the record of a revelation is not itself revelation but only tradition and therefore can never be more than probable (see also De Potentia Dei, Thomas Aquinas, The Newman Press, 1952 and Deism in Enlightenment England, Jeffrey R. Wigelsworth, Manchester University Press, 2009 and The ‘General Scholium’ of the Principia and Isaac Newton's freemasonry, The Alchemy of Science and MysticismCh. 3, Alain Bauer, Inner Traditions, 2007, and Early Deism in France: From the so-called ‘déistes’ of Lyon (1564) to Voltaire’s ‘Lettres philosophiques’ (1734), C.J. Betts, Springer Science & Business Media, 2012, pp. 18-20 and Enlightenment Cosmopolitanism, David Adams, Routledge, 2017, p. 13 and Pierre Charron, Renée Kogel, Librairie Droz, 1972, p. 144 and The New Encyclopædia Britannica, Part 2, Volume 2, Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1983, p. 771 and The English Deists: Studies in Early Enlightenment, Wayne Hudson, Routledge, 2015, p. 50 and The life of Edward lord Herbert, of Cherbury, written by himself [ed. by H. Walpole]. With a prefatory memoir, Edward Herbert (1st baron.) 1847, pp. 7-8).\n\nThe Enlightenment would put forward concepts such as progress, perfectibility, and cosmopolitanism. The Enlightenment would take a secular and rational turn, away from the esoteric and hermetic tradition of the Renaissance. Giordano Bruno (1548-1600 CE) had visited England in 1583-1584 and he influenced the intellectually and spiritually minded Englishmen (Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition, Francis A. Yates, The University of Chicago Press and London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1964, pp. 275 ff.). Bruno had been the first major Renaissance figure to call for a broad, tolerant international ethic of world peace and universal brotherhood for which he referred to Egyptian mythology and philosophy. In France the Philosophes, after dislodging the religion of God in favor of the humanistic religion of Man, had to find some replacement for Christian salvation and afterlife. (Anna Lydia Motto, 1993). Also \"Without a new heaven to replace the old, a new way of salvation, of attaining perfection, the religion of humanity would appeal in vain to the common run of men\" (Anna Lydia Motto, 1993). The Enlightenment in Britain retained an element of millenarianism or \"a belief in a new heaven to replace the old\", albeit in a secular or rational form (Carl Becker, 1932). The promise to build a better world on this world before the end of time goes back to Joachim of Fiore (ca. 1135-1202 CE) in his Enchiridion super Apocalypsim and the theory of the three ages of the Babylonian Talmud or 'Vaticinium Eliae' (prophecy of Elijah or Elias) (Lloyd Kramer, Sarah Maza, 2006 and Wilhelm Schmidt-Biggemann, 2007). In Die Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts (1780) Gotthold Ephraim Lessing (1729-1781 CE), in a revision of Joachim of Fiore's three dispensations, pictured the Enlightenment belief system as the third dispensation after the first and second religious stages shaped by the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament (Jan A. B. Jongeneel, 2009). Unitarinaism or modern Arianism would also be part of the Newtonian movement. Newtonians, such as Isaac Newton, Samuel Clarke (1675-1729 CE), and William Whiston (1667-1752 CE) would be unitarinans or antitrinitarians. In 1712 Samuel Clarke would publish The Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity in which he put forward that Scripture pointed towards a singular Arian-like God instead of the Trinitarian view. Whiston, who succeeded Newton as the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge, would be expelled from the university as a result of his unorthodox religious views. The emergence of natural religion would accompany the rise of Newtonianism. Isaac Newton had put forward the argument from design: \"that the physical laws he had uncovered revealed the mechanical perfection of the workings of the universe to be akin to a watch, wherein the watchmaker is God.\" While Isaac Newton held the opinion that gravity was an aspect of divine activity in the world and could not have emerged out of a mere material universe, Newtonianism would open Pandora's box with regard to the relation between God and the laws of nature and matter (Wigelsworth, 2009, p. 80). Enlightenment philosophy and theology would discuss the relation between God and the laws of nature and matter. With regard to the danger of (natural) philosophy for religion we may remember the words of Tertullianus in his Liber De Praescriptione Haereticorum: \"Fuerat Athenis et istam sapientiam humanam affectatricem et interpolatricem ueritatis de congressibus nouerat, ipsam quoque in suas haereses multipartitam uarietate sectarum inuicem repugnantium. Quid ergo Athenis et Hierosolymis? quid academiae et ecclesiae? quid haereticis et christianis?\". The rationalism of the Enlightenment would be the subject of several publications and theological, philosophical and moral development. Anthony Collins (1676-1729 CE) and John Toland (1670-1722 CE) were part of a group of radical free thinkers. Collins put forward the autonomy of reason, religious freedom and an aversion to religious persecution. John Toland (1670-1722 CE) was a philosopher most famous for his book Christianity Not Mysterious; or, A treatise Shewing That There Is Nothing in the Gospel Contrary to Reason, nor above It, and That No Christian Doctrine Can Be Properly Call'd a Mystery (1696) in which, as a deist, Toland opposed the subordination of reason to revelation. In Christianity Not Mysterious, Toland applied John Locke's (1632-1704 CE) philosophy of common sense to religion. Whereas Locke suggested that Christianity is reasonable, Toland took a decisive step in arguing that reasonable meant not mysterious. The implicit, heretical conclusion is that revelation cannot contradict reason, since \"whoever tells us something we did not know before must insure that his words are intelligible, and the matter possible. This holds good, let God or man be the revealer\". Toland attributed theological mysteries to scriptural misinterpretations of priests, and in this he anticipates 18th-century exponents of natural religion (see also English Deism: Its Roots and Fruits, John Orr, 1934). In 1704 Toland published his Letters to Serena, which, inspired by Spinoza's Tractatus Theologico-Politicus (TTP), dealt with superstition, prejudice, notions of an 'immortal soul' and the autonomy of the material world with regard to 'motive force'. For Toland, motion did not require a transcendent or transitive cause of motion, which emphasized the autonomy of the material world and therefore a materialist conception of nature. The viewpoint held by Toland would develop into eighteenth century 'vitalistic materialism', which stated that motion is inherent in matter and that Newton's science had proven it. Newtonian science would move away from Newton's own metaphysics, which still located the source of motion in immaterial forces of divine origin (Margaret C. Jacob, 2013). Further developments would lead, besides the idea of self-moving matter to the notion of thinking matter. Toland also wrote the Pantheisticon, sive formula celebrandae sodalitatis socraticae (1751), which is a script for a liturgy of a Pantheist club or Socratic Society (see also John Toland: His Methods, Manners, and Mind, Stephen H. Daniel, 1984). The concept of \"pantheism\" was used by Toland to describe the philosophy of Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677 CE). Toland in his Pantheisticon refers to 'l'honnête homme' who will be 'l'homme parfait'. The \"honnête homme\" resembles the καλὸς κἀγαθός of ancient Greece. Ischomachus, the gentleman-farmer, in the dialog Οἰκονομικός by Xenophon was the model for the καλὸς κἀγαθός. Toland also translated the Spaccio de la bestia trionfante (The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast) of Giordano Bruno (1548-1600 CE) (J. A. I. Champion, 1992, p. 150-151). Toland in his translation, presents the Spaccio as a work dealing with the corruption of ancient religion (prisca theologia) and the need of religious reformation based on the 'intelligible, useful, necessary, and unalterable Law of Nature' in order to establish a 'civil theology' (theologia civilis). In Socinianism Truly Stated, by a pantheist (1705), Toland was the first to use the word pantheism: \"The sun is my father, the earth my mother, the world is my country and all men are my family\" (Paul A. Harrison, 2004, p. 29). Thomas Kuhn (1922-1996 CE) would put forward his view on 'l'honnête homme' in his Tradition mathématique et tradition expérimentale dans le développement de la physique (1975). In 1713 William Derham (1657-1735 CE) published his Physico-Theology and Astro-Theology in 1714, which both dealt with teleological arguments for the being and attributes of God. In 1709 Henry Sacheverell (1674-1724 CE) published The Perils of False Brethren, in Church, and State, which was an attack on Whigs and moderate Anglicans such as latitudinarians. He not only attacked the \"neutrality in religion\" put forward by Deists, but also natural theology which attempted to explain religion in \"new-fangl'd terms of modern philosophy\". Sacheverell's sermon would play an important role in the struggle for power between Whigs and Tories. Whigs would support the ascent to the throne of the House of Hannover, while die-hard Tories would still support the Jacobite cause (W.A. Speck, 1977, p. 150 and Ian R. Christie, 1987). In 1713 Anthony Collins published A Discourse of Freethinking, occasioned by the Rise and Growth of a Sect called Freethinkers, in favor of religious toleration, freedom of thought and against superstition (Wigelsworth, 2009, p. 119). It was in this political, theological and philosophical environment, a new Whig-Hanoverian and Newtonian freemasonry was established (see also The Heavenly City of the Eighteenth-Century Philosophers, Carl L. Becker, New Haven, 1965, p. 129 and Essays on Seneca, Anna Lydia Motto, P.

Christie, The Historical Journal, Vol. 30, No. 4 (Dec., 1987), pp. 921-931).\n\nThe 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury (1671-1713 CE) wrote The Moralists a Philosophical Rhapsody a recital of certain conversations on natural and moral subjects and attempted to motivate people to become better by showing them the goodness of human nature (see also The British Moralists on Human Nature and the Birth of Secular Ethics). Shaftesbury also reflected on the nature of philosophy in his Askêmata notebooks (hypomnemata), inspired by the Roman Stoics Epictetus (ca. AD 55-135 CE) and Marcus Aurelius (121-180 CE) (Sellars, 2016). The French Huguenot Pierre des Maizeaux (1666/1673-1745 CE), who lived in exile in London, was involved with the Huguenot information center based at the Rainbow Coffee House, which provided a meeting place for freemasons and French refugee Huguenots. Newtonianism stood for the search for a \"first cause\" through natural philosophy and scientific work, which laid the groundwork for the great scientific revolutions and discoveries during the Enlightenment. It was Isaac Newton's (1642-1727 CE) idea of a quest for moral science through natural philosophy that became the theme of the Enlightenment and freemasonry and which he put forward in his Opticks (book 3): \"And if natural philosophy in all its Parts, by pursuing this Methods, shall at length be perfected, the Bounds of Moral Philosophy will also be enlarged. For so far as we can know by natural Philosophy what is the first Cause, what Power he has over us, and what Benefits we receive from him, so far our Duty towards him, as well as that towards one another, will appear to us by the Light of Nature\". The nature of freemasonry was influenced by these new ideas, which would change the nature of freemasonry from a Roman Catholic to a Protestant and Newtonian movement. At the time of the founding of the Grand Lodge of London and Westminster, the Leibnizian-Newtonian controversy (relationist versus absolutist) was going on between their different philosophical world views on the nature of God (intellectualist versus voluntarist), matter (mechanistic versus a vitalistic view of the relationship between matter and force), and force (force versus vis viva or anima mundi). Most of the debate went on between Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716 CE) and Samuel Clarke (1675-1729 CE), a friend of Newton and became known as the Leibniz-Clarke correspondence. The disagreement between Leibniz and Samuel Clarke was as much about free will and religion as natural philosophy. Clarke also wrote The Scripture doctrine of the Trinity (1712 CE) concerning the doctrine of the Trinity. The advancement of science necessitated a more open approach to natural philosophy or \"Philosophiae Naturalis\". In 1679 Johann Sturm (1635-1703 CE) published a disputation De Philosophia Sectaria Et Electiva Dissertatio Academica against philosophical sectarianism and in favor of a more general method of philosophical inquiry, eclecticism (philosophia eclectica or electiva) (Thomas Ahnert, 2002). In 1688 Robert Boyle (1627-1691 CE) published his Tractatus de ipsa natura, sive Libera in receptam naturae notionem disquisitio ad amicum on natural philosophy. The experimental method put forward by Sturm and Boyle was meant to end fruitless verbal contests about questions of natural philosophy and allow them to be resolved by the organized and institutionalized observation of nature in the presence of witnesses (naturae scrutatores) (Thomas Ahnert, 2002). The \"philosophia sectaria\" or mere speculative argument by philosophical sects inevitably led to disagreements among natural philosophers, because its conclusions were not verifiable by experiments conducted before an audience of witnesses. In 1697 Sturm published his Physica Eclectica which emphasized the need for an undogmatic philosophical eclecticism for an experimentalist natural philosophy. Both Boyle and Sturm emphasized the limited and provisional nature of philosophical theories, which reflected their shared belief in the limits of human reason (Jan W. Wojcik, 2009). Any attempt to move beyond establishing consensus on strictly observable phenomena violated the limits of natural philosophical explanation. Going beyond observable phenomena or the visible structure of matter would lead natural philosophical into the domain of metaphysics. The discussion on natural philosophical would shape the development of experimental science in the Royal Society, the Scrutatorum Naturae Regium Concilium in Paris, the Collegia Eruditorum in Rome, the Collegium Experimentale in Altdorf, and the Accademia del Cimento in Florence, etc. . The Royal Society's motto was a quotation from Horatius's Epistulae (I, I, 14): \"Nullius addictus iurare in verba magistri, – quo me cumque rapit tempestas, deferor hospes.\" (\"(being) not obliged to swear allegiance to a master, wherever the storm drags me to, I turn in as a guest.\"). The motto reflected the anti-sectarian aims of the Royal Society and its concern with the definition of reliable testimony. The Royal Society's motto \"Nullius [addictus] in verba [iurare magistri]“ referred to the \"philosophia eclectica or electiva\" as opposed to the \"philosophia sectaria\" (Haakonssen, 2006, p. 148). The philosophical preoccupation with the limits of reason and the harmful effects of philosophical sectarianism and dogmatism not only had a profound influence on the development of science, but also on religious tolerance. Religious intolerance (sectarianism) in France would lead to an influx of Huguenots in England. The Edict of Fontainebleau (22 October 1685 CE) revoked the Edict of Nantes (1598 CE), which had granted the Huguenots the right to practice their religion without persecution from the state. In France, the Huguenot polemic against the papacy, and that of Jansenism against the semipelagianism of the Roman Catholic church would be silenced. The Edict of Fontainebleau would give the deathblow to French Reformed theology, but would lead to the naturalism, atheism, and materialism of the French Enlightenment (J. H. Kurtz, 1893, Ch. III, I, 11). The Edict of Fontainebleau would cause a large number of Protestants to leave France, among them John Theophilus Desaguliers (1683-1744 CE), who would play an important role in the foundation of the Grand Lodge of London and Westminster and early Newtonianism. Desaguliers became Isaac Newton's experimental assistant in 1713, and a fellow of the Royal Society in 1714. He wrote Physico-mechanical lectures, or, An account of what is explain'd and demonstrated in the course of mechanical and experimental philosophy (1734). The Grand Lodge of London and Westminster would be founded in 1717, during the Presidency of the Royal Society by Isaac Newton from 1703 until 1727 CE and Desaguliers would be elected as the third Grand Master of the 'Premier Grand Lodge of England' in 1719. Modern freemasonry would come into existence in an environment of \"philosophia eclectica or electiva\" and \"theologia eclectica\" in order to overcome philosophical and theological sectarianism (A. J. Bueno, 2016, p. 226). In this eclectic context we could also refer to 1 Thessalonians 5:21: \"πάντα δοκιμάζετε τὸ καλὸν κατέχετε\" (see also Shaftesbury, Stoicism, and Philosophy as a Way of Life, John Sellars, Sophia, September 2016, Volume 55, Issue 3, pp. 395-408 and Aux origines de la franc-maçonnerie: Newton et les newtoniens, Alain Bauer, Éditions Dervy, 2003 and The Newtonian system of the world, the best model of government: an allegorical poem, John Theophilus Desaguliers, Printed by A.

The foundation of the Grand Lodge of London and Westminster in 1717 took place during the era which witnessed the end of the Aristotelian dominance of philosophy in Europe, the rise and fall of Cartesianism, the emergence of \"experimental philosophy\" (later called \"empiricism\" in the nineteenth century) in Great Britain, and the development of numerous experimental and mathematical methods for the study of nature. The early eighteenth century marked the final transition of absolute monarchy to constitutional monarchy in Great Britain after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. It also coincided with the development of the Protestant Christian view of natural law in the Bill of Rights of 1689. The Act of Settlement of 1701, disqualified anyone who becomes a Roman Catholic, or who marries one, to inherit the throne of England and Ireland. The Acts of Union of 1707 joined the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland into Great Britain. Newtonianism and the ascent to the throne of Great Britain of the House of Hanover with George I of Great Britain (1660-1727 CE) provided the philosophical and political background for the creation of the Grand Lodge of London and Westminster. Besides being king of Great Britain, George I was also ruler of the continental Herzogtum Braunschweig-Lüneburg, which was part of the Sacrum Romanum Imperium. The Jacobite rising of 1715 was an attempt to regain the throne by James Francis Edward Stuart (Old Pretender). In January 1717 a Swedish-Jacobite plot was discovered in which Charles XII of Sweden would launch an invasion of Scotland in order to restore James Francis Edward Stuart to the Stuart throne. Jacobite freemasons were involved in the plot, which made it necessary to for the Hanoverian freemasons to respond. The foundation of the new Grand Lodge was an attempt to get rid of the old Jacobite Scottish Masonic heritage and to become acceptable for the new Hanoverian rulers. Freemasonry had to shed its Stuart heritage and re-emerge as a loyal Hanoverian fraternity. The foundation of modern freemasonry was a political and religious (Protestant) act related to the the ascent to the throne of Great Britain of the Protestant House of Hanover and Whig policy, combined with the rise of Newtonianism in England. The rise of the new type of freemasonry would be closely related to the triumph of Newtonianism and Hanoverian and Whig politics. The old Scottish-Irish-Stuart traditions (Antients) would get into conflict with the new Whig-Hanoverian freemasons (Moderns) (see also A Concise History of Freemasonry, Robert Freke Gould, Frederick Joseph William Crowe, Macoy Pub. & Masonic Supply Company, 1924, p. 297 and Builders of Empire: Freemasons and British Imperialism, 1717-1927, Jessica L. Harland-Jacobs, UNC Press Books, 2012 and Freemasonry and the Birth of Modern Science, Robert Lomas, Fair Winds Press, p. 265-270 and 1717 and the invasion that never was and Les Rivalités Maçonniques et la Bulle In Eminenti, Marsha Keith Schuchard, La Règle d’Abraham, 25 (2008), pp. 3-48 and Anteckningar till Konung Gustaf IIIs Historia, Elis Schröderheim, 1851, p. 81 and La Crise du Nord au Début du XVIIIe Siècle, Claude Nordmann, 1962, 10, pp. 152-153 and Mystiskt brödraskap-mäktigt nätwerke, Andreas Önnerfors, ed., 2006).\n\nThe new Grand Lodge and its concept of Freemasonry, together with the Royal Society, would become a political, scientific and philosophical instrument to spread the ideas of Newtonianism (physico-theology) and constitutional monarchy throughout Great Britain and Europe. The principles of freemasonry would become an inspiration for philosophical, political and religious reform in Great Britain, America and Europe. Besides the Royal Society there were close connections with other learned societies such as the Royal College of Physicians; the Society of Apothecaries; the Society of Antiquaries; and the Spalding Society. The time period between the publication of the Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1687 CE) and On the Origin of Species (1859 CE), saw the development of (Newtonian) physico-theology, a theology based on the constitution of the natural world according to rational and mathematical laws (Denham, 1754). Here the cosmic λόγος (order) of the Greeks, which could be found in the Book of Nature merged with the Judaic component of European culture (word), which were derived from the Jewish Torah and the Christian New Testament. The instruments of Greek geometry, compass and square, symbols of geometrical reasoning and the geometry of nature, would result in scientific Deism, while humanistic Deism was derived from moral-philosophical speculation and the moral nature of man, which could be symbolized by the Bible (see also Newtonianism, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy and Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, Isaac Newton, 5 July 1687 and The Concise History of Freemasonry, Robert Freke Gould, Courier Corporation, 2012, p. 207 and The Foundations of Modern Freemasonry: The Grand Architects: Political Change and the Scientific Enlightenment, 1714-1740, Ric Berman, Sussex Academic Press, 2012, p. 112 and Physico-theology: Or, A Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God, from His Works of Creation, William Derham, W.

The four existing Lodges were accustomed to meeting at the Goose and Gridiron Ale-house in St. Paul's Church-yard; Crown Ale-house in Parker's Lane near Drury's Lane; Apple Tree Tavern in Charles Street, Covent Garden; and Rummer and Grapes Tavern in Channel Row, Westminster. The \"Rummer and Grapes\", appears to have been a lodge of accepted and speculative masons, while the other three lodges were still mainly operative lodges. John Theophilus Desaguliers (1683-1744 CE) was a member of the \"Rummer and Grapes\" Lodge. There seems to be some symbolic meaning related to the day when the Grand Lodge was founded. The year 1717 is composed of twice 17, a number with a special meaning, as it combines the celestial perfection of 10 (e.g. Pythagorean Tetraktys) with the worldly perfection (achievable by man) symbolized by 7, meaning completeness which is gained only from true insight. St. John the Baptist also stands for faith as opposed to St. John the Evangelist who stands for reason (logos). Faith also refers to the Ladder of Divine Ascent (ca. 600 CE), which Saint John Climacus (ca. 7th century CE) called the \"Ladder to Perfection\" (see also The Genesis of Freemasonry, Douglas Knoop, Manchester University Press, 1947).\n\nThe Constitutions of the Freemasons by James Anderson, 1723 edition\n\nJohn Montagu, Duke of Montagu presents the scroll to Philip, Duke of Wharton\n\nThe 47th Proposition of Euclid, or the Pythagorean Theorem in between them,\n\ntogether with Archimedes' famous exclamation 'Eureka';\n\nJohn Theophilus Desaguliers (1683-1744 CE), jointly with colleagues within the orbit of the Grand Lodge, fundamentally altered English Freemasonry to produce an organisation that reflected and reinforced the intellectual and economic transformations then in progress within early eighteenth century English society. The pro-Hanoverian political characteristic of the Grand Lodge of London and Westminster was fundamental to its success: demonstrating to the government that Freemasons were now reliable partners in the promotion of the Hanoverian succession and safeguarding of its Whig administration. Several influential Freemasons also held senior office at the Royal Society. It was decided to create a new Charter, which would no longer refer to the Stuart type of freemasonry, but embrace the new Hanoverian rulers. A group of Masons forestalled the new Grand Lodge by having J. Roberts print a Constitution, now called the Roberts Constitutions, dated 1722. They refer to the Seven Liberal Sciences of the classical curriculum (trivium and quadrivium) and the importance of Geometry, which would return in the General Ahiman Rezon of the Antients. George Payne (ca. 1685-1757 CE), in his second term as Grand Master in 1720, wrote the General Regulations of a Freemason (1722). The General Regulations of George Payne would be included in the new Constitutions mainly written by Revd. Dr. James Anderson (1680-1739 CE) in the years 1721-22, under the guidance of Newtonians, such as John Theophilus Desaguliers (1683-1744 CE) and Martin Folkes (1690-1754 CE). The concept of the Constitutions is closely related to the general structure of the Principia of Isaac Newton as it also uses definitions, axioms and propositions. Geometric or Euclidean reasoning is woven into the construction of the Constitutions. Euclid represents the art of geometry and Pythagoras of Samos represents the art of arithmetic, both referring to divine proportion in Nature so eloquently revealed in the Principia. Six years after its formation in 1717, on Sunday 17 January 1723, the Grand Lodge of England approved The Constitutions of the Free-Masons containing the History, Charges, Regulations, & of that most Ancient and Right Worshipful Fraternity: For use of the Lodges, written by the Revd. Dr. James Anderson (1680-1739 CE). Some of his inspiration he may have got from his father (see also James Anderson: Man & Mason, James Stevenson, Heredom, Volume 10, 2000, p. 94). His father, James Anderson senior (1649-1722 CE), had been a member of the Lodge of Aberdeen, where he had compiled the elaborate Mark Book ('Lockit Buik', 27 December 1670 CE) of the lodge while he was serving as its secretary, and in the 1690s he had served as its Master. The Constitutions of the Free-Masons were published in the USA by Benjamin Franklin (1706-1790 CE) in 1734 (see also The Constitutions of the Free-Masons containing the History, Charges, Regulations, & of that most Ancient and Right Worshipful Fraternity: For use of the Lodges, Anderson, Senex and Hooke, 1723 and Jean-Theophile Desaguliers. Un huguenot, philosophe et juriste, en politique, Pierre Boutin, Honoré Champion, 1999, pp. 161-165)\n\nThe Frontispiece to James Anderson's Constitutions (1723 edition) is full of symbolic meaning. The scene on the Frontispiece, engraved by John Pine (1690-1756 CE), depicts John Montagu, Duke of Montagu (1690-1749 CE) presenting the scroll to Philip, Duke of Wharton (1698-1731 CE), who was the next Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of London and Westminster. John Montagu is wearing the robes of the Order of the Garter, while presenting the Constitutional scroll and a set of compasses to Philip Wharton, dressed in his ducal robes. Both Grand Masters of the Grand Lodge of London and Westminster are surrounded by their respective Deputy Grand Master and Grand Wardens: John Beale, doctor of physic, Josias Villeneau and Thomas Morrice are to the left, with white aprons and gloves; and William Hawkins and Joshua Timson, stand next to John Theophilus Desaguliers (1683-1744 CE), dressed in clerical robes, on the far right. Both Villeneau and Desaguliers were French Huguenots, who fled France after the proclamation of the Edict of Fontainebleau (22 October 1685) by Louis XIV of France (1638-1715 CE). The Edict revoked the Edict of Nantes (1598 CE) on religious tolerance. The resulting persecution of French protestants made many of them leave France for protestant England. In the background of the scene there is a depiction of the parting of the Red Sea (Old Testament, Exodus 14:21), recalling the successful flight of the Israelites from the Egyptians to the promised land. The reference to the parting of the Red Sea might signify here the survival of a Judeo-Christian tradition that had been in danger, but was now entering a time of security. The symbolic meaning of the parting of the Red Sea is that this one event is the final act in God's delivering His people from slavery in Egypt. The exodus from Egypt and the parting of the Red Sea is the single greatest act of salvation in the Old Testament, and it is continually recalled to represent God's saving power. In Christianity the passing through the Red Sea is also symbolic of the believer's identification with the death, burial and resurrection of Christ (Paul, 1 Corinthians 10:1-4 and Romans 6:4). The pillars on both sides depict the five noble orders of architecture introduced to England by Inigo Jones (1573-1652 CE), namely the Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. The frontispiece shows a pavement or arcade with the Five Orders, coupled, on each side; the Composite Order (first) in the foreground, receding to the Tuscan (fifth) in the background. Marcus Vitruvius Pollio (ca. 80-70 BCE, died after ca. 15 BCE) mentioned the five noble orders of architecture in his work de Architectura. Three of the Classic Orders, the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian, were used by the Greeks. The Romans adopted these three and added the Tuscan and the Composite, so making the Five Orders of Architecture. The five pillars may also allude to the monarchs who supported the rebuilding of St Paul's Cathedral by Sir Christopher Wren (1632-1723 CE) between 1675 and 1708 CE. The five monarchs were: Charles I of England (1600-1649 CE, ruled 1625-1649 CE), Charles II of England (1630-1685 CE, ruled 1649-1651 CE and 1660-1685 CE), James II of England (1633-1701 CE, ruled 1685-1688 CE), William III of England (1650-1702, ruled 1689-1702 CE) and Anne, Queen of Great Britain (1665-1714 CE, ruled 1702-1714 CE). In the foreground is the Greek word εuρηκα (Archimedes' famous exclamation \"I have found it!\") below a representation of the 47th proposition of Euclid of Alexandria or Pythagorean theorem, a symbol which is traditionally associated with Past Masters in freemasonry. James Anderson in his Constitutions (1723 CE) wrote about the 47th proposition: “The Great Pythagoras, provided the Author of the 47th Proposition of Euclid's first Book, which, if duly observed, is the Foundation of all Masonry, sacred, civil, and military…. This wise philosopher, Pythagoras, enriched his mind abundantly in a general knowledge of things, and more especially in Geometry, or Masonry. On this subject he drew out many problems and theorems, and, among the most distinguished, he erected this, when, in the joy of his heart, he exclaimed Eureka, in the Greek language signifying, \"I have found it,\" and upon the discovery of which he is said to have sacrificed a hecatomb. It teaches Masons to be general lovers of the arts and sciences.” The Pythagorean theorem and the love of the arts and sciences can be traced back to ancient Greece. Geometry is about measuring and creating standards, understanding and reasoning (philosophy). Plato made a study of geometry or some exact science an indispensable preliminary to that of philosophy. The story goes that, in order to emphasize the importance of geometry, placed above the entrance to the Platonic school of philosophy (the Academy) were the words: \"Μηδείς άγεωμέτρητος είσίτω μον τήν στέγην\" (Let no one ignorant of geometry enter my doors) (Smith, 1951, p. 88; Katz, 1993, p. 48). According to Plutarchus, Plato also wrote about God as the great Geometer: \"Άεί θεός γεωμετρεΐ\" (God eternally geometrizes) (Plutarchus, 1841, viii; Kline, 1964, p.78). We also read about the divine nature of \"number and weight\" in the Wisdom of Solomon (11:20): “Even apart from these, men could fall at a single breath when pursued by justice and scattered by the breath of thy power. But thou hast arranged all things by measure and number and weight.” (see also The Foundations of Modern Freemasonry: The Grand Architects: Political Change and the Scientific Enlightenment, 1714-1740, Ric Berman, Sussex Academic Press, 2012, p. 136 and Huguenot Heritage: The History and Contribution of the Huguenots in Britain, Robin D.

Katz, Harper Collins, 1993 and Convivalium Disputationum libri novem, viii, Plutarchus, Didot, 2 ed., 1841 and Mathematics in Western Culture, Morris Kline, Oxford University Press, 1964).\n\nWith regard to the ethical meaning of the 47th proposition of Euclid there is the Ethica ordine geometrico demonstrata (1677 CE) of Benedictus de Spinoza (1632-1677 CE). The Ethica was written in the same format as Euclid's Στοιχεῖα as an axiomatic system. It was a moral philosophy based on the logical format of the Στοιχεῖα which is 'more geometrico' (Bennett, 1984, p. 16-17). In his Ethica, Spinoza described a journey whereby the mind embarks on an exodus from a state of bondage to false beliefs and systems of power to the promised land of clarity and self-knowledge, which culminated in his 47th proposition. In 'Pars II, Propositio XLVII' Spinoza stated: \"Mens humana adaequatam habet cognitionem aeternae et infinitae essentiae Dei\" (II, P47). This adequate knowledge of the essence of God serves as a means to achieve a 'third kind of knowledge' (II,P40,S2). For Spinoza the 'first kind of knowledge', was when someone saw things as contingent, happening by chance. The use of reason allowed man to enter the 'second kind of knowledge', when he perceives things as necessary and eternal (V,P28). Finally the 'third kind of knowledge', which is intuition, deals with one's essence as modes of God in a state of pure perenity, eternity (Greenberg, 2007, p. 343; de Castela). The third kind of knowledge is an immediate understanding (intuition) of one's self and one's place within the universe or one's place within God. Spinoza also dealt with the virtues required for social and political life, chief among these being friendship and the responsibility for each man to consider the needs of society (R.A. Graeter, 2011; S.B. Smith, 2003). This goes back to the Greek and Roman idea of civil duty towards society. With regard to one's civil duty, Cicero had written: \"non nobis solum nati sumus ortusque nostri partem patria vindicat, partem amici\" De Officiis (1:22) (see also Freemasonry's System of Morality, What makes it so peculiar and why do we hide it?, Richard A. Graeter, Caliburn Lodge, 2011 and Spinoza's Book of Life: Freedom and Redemption in the Ethics, Steven B. Smith, Yale University Press, 2003 and Encyclopedia of Love in World Religions, Volume 1, Yudit Kornberg Greenberg, ABC-CLIO, 2007 and The three kinds of knowledge, Leon de Castela and A Study of Spinoza's 'Ethics', Jonathan Bennett, CUP Archive, 1984).\n\nThe charioteer in the sky which is depicted in the Frontispiece is an Indo-European symbol for the Sun God and also a symbol for the mystical ascent of the soul. A \"sun chariot\" is a mythological representation of the sun riding in a chariot. The concept is younger than that of the Egyptian solar barge, and typically Indo-European, corresponding with the Indo-European expansion after the invention of the chariot in the 2nd millennium BCE. In the sky directly overhead the sun approaching its meridian height is allegorized in the figure of Apollo Helios, Greek God of the Sun. The image of the Sun also refers to the Analogy of the Sun in the Platonic system of philosophy, where Socrates compares the \"Good\" with the sun (The Republic VI, 507b-509c). The Roman deity Sol Invictus was also depicted riding a quadriga. The Vedic Sun God Surya is also depicted riding a chariot drawn by seven horses. Interestingly Krishna is the guide and charioteer of Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita, which is part of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. In Chinese mythology the Lotus Tree of Life, the Celestial Horse from ancient China, traditionally is seen pulling the Chariot of the Emperor Archer Sun-God. The warhorses (cerigyn nojan) of the Mongols were called \"Celestial Horses\" by the Chinese. The chariot also refers to the charioteer as a symbol for mystical ascent of the soul. The Eleatic monist Parmenides (early 5th century BCE) in his poem On Nature refers to a visionary chariot ride up through the gates of night and day. Pindar (ca. 522-ca. 443 BCE) in his First Olympian Ode also refers to a golden chariot given by the gods: \"Honoring him, the god gave him a golden chariot, and horses with untiring wings\". Socrates (469-399 BCE) refers to the chariot as the aeterial vehicle of the soul in Plato's (424/423-348/347 BCE) Phaedrus. The soul is portrayed as a charioteer (Reason), and two winged steeds: one white ('spiritedness', the irascible, boldness;) and one black (concupiscence, the appetitive, desire). The Neoplatonists Plotinus (204/5-270 CE) and Iamblichus (ca. 245-ca. 325 CE) refer to the soul's struggle to ascend as a unified being to the vision of immutable reality. In the Old Testament we also find references to chariots in Kings 2:11-12 where a chariot takes the prophet Elijah up to the heavens in a whirlwind and the four-wheeled chariot of the Cherubim in Ezek 1:15-25and 10:8-22. Christians adopted the image of the Sun (Helios or Sol Invictus) to represent Christ. In this portrayal he is a beardless figure with a flowing cloak in a chariot drawn by four white horses, as in the mosaic in Mausoleum M or 'Tomb of the Julii', discovered under Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome. In the book Revelation 6:2-8 and 19:11 of John on the opening of the seven seals the rider on the white horse is called \"faithful and true\". The references to Archimedes, Pythagoras and Plato in the Frontispiece put freemasonry within the anti-Aristotelian tradition. The overall impression of the frontispiece is one of great triumph on many levels: the philosophical and scientific, organisational and traditional, and the spiritual and transcendent. These various elements combine to present Anderson's view of history as the careful unfolding of a divine plan (see also Phaedrus, Plato in Twelve Volumes, Vol. 9, Plato, William Heinemann Ltd. 1925, 253c-254e and Pindar's First Olympian Ode, Pindar, 86-87 and Marsilio Ficino and the Phaedrian Charioteer Ed. and trans.

Pulleyblank, Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, 1966, p. 9-39).\n\nThe key 'constitutional' features of the Constitutions were the reworked Charges and Regulations. The Charges occupy seven pages (pp. 49-56); and the Regulations, compiled by Payne, fourteen pages (pp. 58-72). The new Constitutions put forward an 'ethos of education and religious tolerance'. In addition Anderson compiled an artificial history (faux history) which was designed to set a literary context for Freemasonry. The constitution supported the state and its legitimate authority and, at the same time, encouraged, if not demanded, religious tolerance and moral integrity. Freemasonry was designed to be above political and social censure, admitting only 'good and true Men, free-born, and of mature and discreet Age, no Bondmen, no Women, no immoral or scandalous men, but of good Report'. Bondman refers to the Hebrew word עֶבֶד (ebhedh) for slave in the Torah, either foreign (Genesis 43:18; 44:9,33; Leviticus 25:44,46) or Hebrew (Leviticus 25:42; 2 Kings 4:1). In the New Testament (Revelation 6:15) it is used as a translation of δοῦλος, meaning someone who belongs to another (bond-slave) in contrast with a freeman. The Hanoverian freemasons created a new structure which combined latitudinarian religious tolerance with support for the parliamentary establishment (Whigs), sociability and entertainment, and the quest for and disbursement of scientific and general knowledge (Newtonianism): ideas that can be considered to be at the core of the English Enlightenment. For the new freemasons Newton's theories demonstrated not only scientific and physical truths, but also revealed a deeper moral truth. In Newtonianism a new connection developed between religion, science and morality. Newton came to be the leader of the so-called 'scientific revolution' and had spent a great deal of his 'time and energy using his mathematical , physical, and celestial theories to uncover patterns of Biblical revelation'. Freemasonry was being rebuilt in part on the intellectual foundations of freedom of the person, property and constitutional government: themes that were embraced and reinforced by the Whig aristocrats, magistracy and learned professionals at the helm of the new Grand Lodge (see also The Foundations of Modern Freemasonry: The Grand Architects: Political Change and the Scientific Enlightenment, 1714-1740, Ric Berman, Sussex Academic Press, 2012, Chapter three and The Constitutions of the Free-Masons containing the History, Charges, Regulations, & of that most Ancient and Right Worshipful Fraternity: For use of the Lodges, Anderson, Senex and Hooke, 1723 and Efflorescences and economic growth in world history: rethinking the\"Rise of the West\" and the Industrial Revolution, J. Goldstone, University of Californa, Davis, 2002, p. 372).\n\nThe new Constitutions of the Free-Masons (1723 CE) was based on the concept of a natural religion read from the Book of Nature, apprehended by human reason and binding all men who rejected stupid atheists and irreligious Libertines: \"A Mason is oblig'd, by his Tenure, to obey the moral Law; and if he rightly understands the Art, he will never be a stupid Atheist, nor an irregular Libertine.\" The main elements in the opening of the constitution are the moral law, the art, stupid atheism and irregular libertinism. The Moral Law refers to moral absolutism, the ethical view that particular actions are intrinsically right or wrong. Moral absolutism teaches that there are universal moral principles by which all actions are to be judged. It is the duty of a freemason to learn the universal moral principles and to act accordingly. One example of a universal moral principle is the golden rule or regula aurea (law of reciprocity), the principle of treating others as one would wish to be treated. The art may refer to the ancient Greek τέχνη (technê), which is translated as either craft or art (see Epistēmē and Technê). Technê is related to ἐπιστήμη (epistēmē) in the implication of knowledge of principles, but in addition technê means practice. We could relate understanding of the moral law to ἐπιστήμη and τέχνη to an art or craft. Freemasonry deals with the ἄσκησις (training or exercise) in order to develop the morality of the freemason and mastering the λόγοι (principles) behind the art and developing into a τεχνίτης (artificer, craftsman, master mason). Being a freemason is a matter of moral practice rather than just words (έργα ού λόγοι) (see also Moral Theory: An Introduction, Mark Timmons, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2012, p. 91 and The Art of Living: The Stoics on the Nature and Function of Philosophy, John Sellars, Routledge, 2011, p. 20, 25 and 27 and The Freemasons: What They Are, what They Do, what They are Aiming at, Louis Gaston de Ségur, P. Donahoe, 1869, p. 90)\n\nThe constitutions were written a a moment when two conflicting philosophical systems existed in Britain, one was a deepening alliance between philosophy and theology and the other was a skeptical tradition which lead to anti-clericalism, biblical criticism, skepticism about miracles, materialism and necessitarianism. Thomas Hobbes ((1588-1679 CE) and Baruch Spinoza (1632-1677 CE) were considered to be the major representatives of the skeptical tradition. The defenders of Christian theology wrote treatises against the \"atheistic\" doctrines of Hobbes and Spinoza. Natural religion or Deism was one element which they believed provided Christian theology with a rational defense against skepticism and atheism (a pitfall like Aristotelianism in the Scholastic tradition, Thomism and creationism). The concept of natural religion or Deism goes back to Edward Herbert of Cherbury (1583-1648 CE), who wrote De Veritate, prout distinguitur a revelatione, a verisimili, a possibili, et a falso (1624 CE) in which he put forward the common notions of religion in five articles, which became the charter of the English deists. These five articles contained the whole doctrine of the religion of reason or natural religion. He accepted the creatorship of God, but rejected revelatory religion and the continued involvement of the divine in the created world. The constitutions also dealt with atheism. The definition of a \"stupid\" atheist was inspired by A Treatise of the Foure Degenerate Sonnes, Viz. The Atheist, the Magician, the Idolater, and the Jew (1663, pp. 5-7) of John Weemes, who distinguished between the contradicting, skeptical, physical and stupid atheist. The stupid atheist is situated in between the contradicting (disputing) and the skeptical atheist. Samuel Clarke (1675-1729 CE) in his A Demonstration of the Being and Attributes of God: More Particularly in Answer to Mr. Hobbs, Spinoza and Their Followers (1705 CE) also dealt with \"stupid\" atheists. It was based on his first Boyle lecture (1704 CE), which was an attempt to prove the existence of God, along with all divine attributes against atheistic systems of philosophy. Ralph Cudworth (1617-1688 CE) in his The True Intellectual System of the Universe: the First Part wherein All the Reason and Philosophy of Atheism is Confuted and Its Impossibility Demonstrated (1678 CE) put forward his Platonist world-view and rejected four types of atheism: atomistic, hylopathian, cosmoplastic and hylozoistic. Atomical atheism meant that creation came about by chance, hylozoic atheism meant that life comes from matter, for hylopathian atheism there was a hierarchy of intelligent matter and while cosmoplastic atheism accepted the existence of a divine soul it denied a ruling principle in creation. Cudworth wrote against the materialism of Thomas Hobbes, which in his view defended not only hylozoic atheism, but also hylopathian atheism. Cosmoplastic atheism refers to late Stoicism, which according to Cudworth 'supposes one plastic or spermatic nature, one plantal or vegetative life in the whle world, as the highest priciple'. Atheism therefore was not considered a homogeneous group when modern freemasonry was founded and some of the early members adhered to some form of extreme Deism, but avoiding \"stupid\" atheism. Deism could have two meanings, deism that rationalized religion or deism that abandoned religion and deified reason. It ranged from extreme Protestantism and a belief in God, Christ, and a future life, while the other form focused on human reason and leaned towards atheism. Beside the \"stupid\" atheist, the \"irreligious\" libertine was also to be excluded from freemasonry. A libertine is one devoid of most moral restraints, which are seen as unnecessary or undesirable, especially one who ignores or even spurns accepted morals and forms of behavior sanctified by the larger society. Libertinism was associated with religious freedom and sometimes used as a metaphor for Catholicism and the absolutism and hedonism of Charles II of England (1630-1685 CE). In 1649 Samuel Rutherford (1600-1661 CE), a Scottish Presbyterian theologian, had written A Free Disputation against pretended Liberty of Conscience against libertinism. The viewpoint against libertinism goes back to the writings of Paul of Tarsus (ca. 5-ca. 67 CE) in Philippians and 1 Corinthians (1 Cor. 3-6). In Philippians (3:18-19) Paul warns not only against Judaizers but also against libertines: \"multi enim ambulant quos saepe dicebam vobis nunc autem et flens dico inimicos crucis Christi quorum finis interitus quorum deus venter et gloria in confusione ipsorum qui terrena sapiunt\" (see also The Freemasons: What They Are, what They Do, what They are Aiming at, Louis Gaston de Ségur, P.

Walter Hansen, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2009, p. 24).\n\nCalvinists, Presbyterians (Scottish Calvinists) and Newtonians played an important role in defining the ethical foundations and moral principles of the new Grand Lodge type of freemasonry. Martin Luther (1483-1546 CE) in Von weltlicher Obrigkeit, wie weit man ihr Gehorsam schuldig sei (1523 CE) wrote about 'liberty of conscience': \"Auch geschieht es auf eines jeglichen eigene Gefahr, wie er glaubt, und muß er für sich selbst sehen, daß er recht glaube. Denn so wenig wie ein anderer für mich in die Hölle oder den Himmel fahren kann, so wenig kann er auch für mich glauben oder nicht glauben; und so wenig er mir Himmel oder Hölle auf- oder zuschließen kann, so wenig kann er mich zum Glauben oder Unglauben treiben. Weil es denn einem jeglichen auf seinem Gewissen liegt, wie er glaubt oder nicht glaubt, und weil damit der weltlichen Gewalt kein Abbruch geschieht, soll sie auch zufrieden sein und sich um ihre Sache kümmern und so oder so glauben lassen, wie man kann und will, und niemand mit Gewalt nötigen. Denn es ist ein freies Werk um den Glauben, zu dem man niemand zwingen kann, Ja, es ist ein göttlich Werk im Geist, geschweige denn, daß es äußerliche Gewalt erzwingen und schaffen sollte. Daher ist das allgemein verbreitete Wort genommen; Zum Glauben kann und soll man niemand zwingen.\" (Ojakangas, 2013, p. 88; Ellerman, 1995, p. 65). The Enlightenment idea of natural right and the principle equality of natural order among all human beings, meant that everyone deserved equal dignity and respect (moral equality) (Randall, 1966, p. 933). Freemasonry was to be a 'Center of Union and the Means of conciliating true Friendship among Persons that must have remain'd at a perpetual Distance', bringing together people from different religions and denominations. The principe of freemasonry as a 'Center of Union' was put forward in the first chapter 'Concerning God and religion'. Natural religion and Deism provided the theological basis of early 18th century freemasonry. Natural religion was to be the common denominator and served the same goal as the 'philosophia perennis' which could unite mankind above and beyond different religious denominations (see also The Voice of Conscience: A Political Genealogy of Western Ethical Experience, Mika Ojakangas, Bloomsbury Publishing USA, 2013 and Intellectual Trespassing as a Way of Life: Essays in Philosophy, Economics, and Mathematics, David P.

The Constitutions laid the foundation of the legend of Hiram Abiff, King Solomon's Master Builder of the First Temple in Jerusalem, along with the pyramid style organisational model of Freemasonry. The myth of the Temple also refers to the spiritual Third Temple of Ezekiel. The references to Archimedes (ca.287-ca.212 BCE) and Pythagoras (ca. 570-ca. 495 BCE) place freemasonry in the mathematical & geometric tradition of Athens and Alexandria. Francis Bacon, 1st Viscount St. Alban (1561-1626 CE) in his New Atlantis had written about Solomon's House (i.e., the recovery of natural philosophy) as the complement to the rebuilding of Solomon's Temple (i.e., the restoration of true religion). In this view one might consider the Royal Society to be the implementation of Francis Bacon's 'Solomon's House' and the freemason's lodge to be the symbolic reconstruction of 'Solomon's Temple'. The philosophical and mathematical traditions of Alexandria and Athens had converged in the Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica of Isaac Newton (1642-1726 CE) and Newtonianism which developed from it. The Archimedean-Pythagorean philosophy would not only play an important symbolic role in freemasonry ('Solomon's Temple'), but would also play an important practical role in science ('Solomon's House'). In this regard, one could nowadays consider the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at the Centre Européen de Recherche Nucléaire (CERN) to be a gigantic magnifying glass for reading the Book of Nature in the Archimedean-Pythagorean (Alexandrian) and Newtonian tradition of mathematical physics. Even Einstein's (1879-1955 CE) theory of Special Relativity (1905 CE) and the General Theory of Relativity (1915 CE) make use of the Pythagorean Theorem (L.B. Okun, 2008, p. 622). The concept of space, mass and time in Einstein's 'Theory of Relativity' has profound consequences for natural philosophy, philosophy in general and for theology (J.R. Pilbrow, 2005; H. Halvorson & H. Kragh, 2019) (see also Regole generali di architettura sopra le cinque maniere de gli edifici, Sebastiano Serlio, 1537 and Freemasonry: Rituals, Symbols & History of the Secret Society, Mark Stavish, Llewellyn Worldwide, 2007, p.11 and Living the Enlightenment: Freemasonry and Politics in Eighteenth-Century Europe, Margaret C.

Zalta (ed.), H. Halvorson & H. Kragh, The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2019 Edition)).\n\nA second, reworked, version of the Constitutions was published in 1738 (by Anderson), to carry a Protestant meaning. The beginning of the first article \"On God and Religion\" now read \"A Mason is obliged by his tenure to observe the moral law as a true Noachite; and if he rightly understands the Craft, he will never be neither a stupid Atheist nor an irreligious Libertine, nor act against conscience\". This referred to the Seven Laws of Noah. The Seven Laws of Noah, which are a list of seven moral imperatives which, according to the Talmud, were given by God to Noah as a binding set of laws for all mankind. They apply to all the \"children of Noah\" - that is, all of humanity, both Jews and gentiles. Laurence Dermott (1720-1791 CE), the Irishman, who wrote the Ahiman rezon in 1756 for the Antients, would copy for instance the first charge from Anderson's 1738 Constitutions and also copied from Spratt's Irish Constitutions. The original Constitution of Ireland was a re-writing of the 1723 Edition by John Pennell, Grand Secretary of the Irish Grand Lodge, published in 1730. One might wonder if the 1738 Constitutions were a failed attempt to reconcile the two factions which would become to be called the 'Moderns' and the 'Antients'. A third edition of the Constitutions of the Free-Masons, was published in 1756, in which a return was made to the wording in the first edition concerning God and Religion. The Constitutions were also modified in 1813 at the union of Antients and Moderns as a compromise between the original Deistic Constitutions of the Free-Masons of the Hanoverian \"Moderns\" (Protestant, Whigs, Newtonians) and the Theistic Ahiman Rezon of the Jacobite Antients (Tories, Roman Catholic) (see also Anderson's Constitutions Of 1738, James Anderson, W. J. Hughan, Kessinger Publishing, 2004 and The Constitutions of the Ancient and Honourable Fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons, Containing Their History, Charges, Regulations, Etc., Collected and Digested by Order of the Grand Lodge, James Anderson, Entick, Brother J. Scott, 1756 and Ahiman rezon, Laurence Dermott, 1764 and Builders of Empire: Freemasons and British Imperialism, 1717-1927, Jessica Harland-Jacobs, Univ of North Carolina Press, 2007, p. 30 and United Grand Lodge of England Constitutions of the Free and Accepted Masons 1911, Sir Edward Letchworth, Kessinger Publishing, 2003).\n\nPhilip, Duke of Wharton (1698-1731 CE) was well-born, and he had the benefit of living in a time when the fact of his being the son of Philip, Duke of Wharton (1648-1715 CE), a prominent nobleman of Hanoverian sympathies. So, he seemed to be a good choice as a Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of London and Westminster. He was the choice of the conservative faction, which preferred him over the (Whig) Duke of Montagu. Nevertheless his Jacobite sympathies and massive debt would in the end force him to leave England for the continent, where he died. His Jacobite sympathies would also cause trouble for the new Grand Lodge, which Desaguliers and his circle would have to deal with (see also Schism: The Battle That Forged Freemasonry, Ric Berman, Sussex Academic Press, 2013, p. 214 and William Hogarth: A Life and a World, Jenny Uglow, Faber & Faber, 2011, p. 192 and Shakespeare Survey, Nummer 51, Stanley Wells, Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 55 and The Living Age ..., Volume 103, Eliakim Littell, Robert S. Littell, Littell, Son, 1869, p. 470).\n\nThere is a lot of discussion regarding the astronomer and architect Christopher Wren (1632-1723 CE) being a free mason. His membership was mentioned in Anderson's Constitutions. The career of Christopher Wren flourished under the Stuart kings and he is regarded to be a member of the 'London Company of Masons'. It is not very likely Christopher Wren joined the new 'Grand Lodge of London and Westminster' as he was a freemason in the old Stuart-tradition. Wren displayed a lifelong loyalty to the memory of his father's master and benefactor, the \"martyred king\", Charles I of England (1600-1649 CE). \"In 1666 Wren was nominated deputy Grand Master under Thomas Savage, 3rd Earl Rivers (1628-1694 CE), and distinguished himself above all his predecessors in legislating for the body at large, and in promoting the interests of the lodges under his immediate care. He was Master of the St. Paul's Lodge, which, during the building of the Cathedral, assembled at the Goose and Gridiron in St. Paul's Churchyard' (see also Sir Christopher Wren and his Times, Elmes, 1852). The 'Free and Accepted Masonry' tried to shed its Jacobite past and to move closer to the new protestant rulers. However, Desaguliers, Anderson and the new Grand Lodge were striving for historical legitimacy and so they tried to connect their new Newtonian and protestant type of freemasonry to its (Stuart) predecessor. Therefore they included Wren in their own history of freemasonry.

Smith, 1783, p. 25 and Parentalia Or Memoirs of the Family of the Wrens, Christopher Wren, Osborn, 1750, p. 293).\n\nThe schism between Moderns and Antients\n\nWith the accession of the Elector of Hanover as George I of Great Britain (1660-1727 CE) in 1714, Masonic supporters of the House of Stuart mounted a decades long, clandestine campaign to regain the British throne. The actual schism developed during the time when William Byron, 5th Baron Byron (1722-1798 CE) was Grand Master from 1747 until 1752. These were turbulent times, with the Jacobite rising of 1745, which had much Irish support. The Roman Catholic Irish were second-class citizens in the United Kingdom, which explains their loyalty to the House of Stuart. Penal Laws against the Irish Roman Catholics and the Dissenters made life harder for the Roman Catholic Irish. Ireland had its Freemasons, who were mainly Roman Catholic and working class or in the lower ranks of the army. Since 1725 the Irish had their own Grand Lodge of Ireland, which made them members of a foreign Grand Lodge when in England. English Masonry boasted the Hanoverian and protestant elite of society, including wealthy businessmen and members of the professions, so in a stratified society like England it is not surprising that the Irish were not particularly welcome in English lodges. London has always attracted members of the Irish community. Work was readily available, and it was natural that those who were freemasons would wish to join with their fellow masons of the English lodges, but they were not always treated as equals. Under the Premier Grand Lodge of England, masonry was changing as a new third degree was being created, and secret signs were being altered, probably out of fear for infiltration by loyalists to the House of Stuart. The Grand Lodge of England made changes in the ritual by transposing certain significant words in the first two degrees and inventing a new one for the third degree. Irish Roman Catholic freemasons from London Irish lodges became increasingly dissatisfied with the way of working of the predominantly protestant and pro-Hanoverian aristocratic London lodges (see also Schism: The Battle That Forged Freemasonry, Ric Berman, Sussex Academic Press, 2013).\n\nOn 17 July 1751, about eighty Masons, nearly all Irish Catholics held a meeting to discuss their problems at the Turks Head Inn, Greek Street, Soho. They decided that the only course of action would be to form their own Grand Lodge, using the original passwords, under which they could form lodges which they could visit as frequently as they liked, without fear of rejection. The group formed themselves into five private lodges, each meeting at a different locality in London. They formed a Grand Committee which became the Grand Lodge of the Antients and they named the competing system the Moderns. The Antients Grand Committee lasted for two years until 1753, when Robert Turner was appointed Grand Master. Finally the lodges formed a fully functional rival Grand Lodge on 27 December 1753 (day of St. John the Evangelist), the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of England, according to the Old Constitutions. September 1756 Laurence Dermott (1720-1791 CE) published a Constitution for the Antients, the Ahiman Rezon. Laurence Dermott opened the higher degrees for merchants and other non-aristocrats from the aspiring middle and working class. In 1771 with the appointment as Grand Master of the John Murray, 3rd Duke of Atholl (1729-1774 CE), the Antients had a senior member of the royal family as their Grand Master. He was a a Scottish peer and Tory politician. Due to this appointment the Antients Grand Lodge also became known as Atholl Grand Lodge. The Antients provided mutually funded welfare and an accessible social infrastructure for its members. They also claimed to adhere to a seemingly superior and more traditional and historically legitimate tradition than the 'Moderns'. The \"Antients\" adhered to the pre-Hannoverian Roman Catholic House of Stuart, which were of Scottish descent. The Antient Grand Lodge would exist until 1813 when it united with the Premier Grand Lodge to create the United Grand Lodge of England. Their last Grand Master was Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn (1767-1820 CE) (see also Schism: The Battle That Forged Freemasonry, Ric Berman, Sussex Academic Press, 2013 and Grand Lodge Bulletin, Freemasons, Volumes 36-37, Grand Lodge of Iowa, 1936, p. 468 and Ars Quatuor Coronatorum: Being the Transactions of the Quatuor Coronati Lodge No. 2076, London, Volume 29, W. J. Parre H, Limited, 1916, p. 14)\n\nThe coat of arms of the Antients, with the motto \"Kodes la Adonai\" or \"Holiness to the Lord\", was a design of Judah Leon Templo (1603-died after 1675 CE). Judah Leon Templo had exhibited in London his model of King Solomon's Temple which attracted considerable notice. Laurence Dermott, the secretary of the \"Antients\", examined this model about ninety years after its first exhibition, and in connexion with it he saw at the same time a strange coat-of arms, of which he promptly availed himself in settling the Arms of his Grand Lodge (see also Transactions, Volumes 25-27, Jewish Historical Society of England, 1977, p. 154 and The rise and development of organised freemasonry, Roy A. Wells, Lewis Masonic, 1986, p. 65). In 1813 the coat of arms of the \"Antients\" and the \"Moderns\" would be merged into the coat of arms of the UGLE.\n\nThis conflict between Moderns and Antients resembled the querelle des Anciens et des Modernes in France in the 1690s, where the \"Modernes\" had supported the idea of Progress and the \"Anciens\" had supported tradition and Authority. As such is can be seen in a broader context of the conflict between tradition and modernity. Freemasons were known either as the Free and Accepted Masons (Moderns, Newtonian, Geomatic or Gentleman masons, Whigs, Hanoverian, Protestant), or Ancient Free and Accepted Masons (Antients or Athol Masons, Tories, Jacobites, Irish, Roman Catholic) (see also Histoire de la querelle des anciens et des modernes, Hippolyte Rigault, L. Hachette et cie., 1856 and Ancients and Moderns: A Study of the Rise of the Scientific Movement in Seventeenth-century England, Richard Foster Jones, Courier Corporation, 1961 and The Foundations of Modern Freemasonry: The Grand Architects : Political Change and the Scientific Enlightenment, 1714-1740, Ric Berman, Sussex Academic Press, 2012, p. 119).\n\nDevelopment of higher degrees and 'Ecossais' freemasonry\n\nBesides the craft degrees, systems of higher and esoteric degrees also developed during the 18th century. Several myths and legends would be introduced into freemasonry in continental Europe, mainly based on Egyptian myths and those about the Knights Templar. The story goes that a group of templars escaped the persecution of 1307 and set course to Scotland. Here they are supposed to have established a Templar type of freemasonry of which the House of Stuart became Grand Master. From this legend would so-called Ecossais freemasonry develop during the exile of the Stuarts after the Glorious Revolution of 1688. A multitude of higher degrees would develop in France. François Fénelon (1651-1715 CE) in 1699 published Les aventures de Télémaque inspired by ancient Greece, which criticized the autocratic reign of king Louis XIV of France, and was in favor of a constitutional monarchy. Les aventures de Télémaque would inspire the pedagogical novel Séthos, histoire, ou Vie tirée des monumens anecdotes de l'ancienne Egypte, published in 1731 by Jean Terrasson (1670-1750 CE). This story elided freemasonry with ancient Egyptian ritual, and served as an inspiration for Mozart and Schikaneder's Magic Flute. It also became the blueprint for Cagliostro's Egyptian rite. In France, the Ordre sacré des Sophisiens, a pseudo-Egyptian secret society founded by veteran military leaders, Egyptologists, scientists, writers, and artists who had joined Napoleon's Egyptian campaign was inspired by the Egyptian Mysteries of Isis. Esoteric freemasonry would draw its inspiration from Jewish Kabbalah, Illuminism, Theosophy, chivalry, Templar and Egyptian legends. Illuminism, which relates to the mystical belief in personal enlightenment, is often confused with the Illuminati movement of Adam Weishaupt (1748-1830 CE). The development of higher degrees and 'Ecossais' freemasonry can be seen as a reaction against the increasing rationalism of the Age of Reason. Ecossais freemasonry would become a political instrument and a pan-European network of Jacobite espionage uniting Jacobites and other opponents of the Hanoverian rulers of Great Britain. Freemasonry in general was a political instrument both for the protestant Hanoverians and the Roman Catholic Stuarts. Its nature and organisation would give rise to a multitude of conspiracy theories (see also Ancient Egypt in the Popular Imagination, David Huckvale, McFarland, 2012, p. 89 and Grand Ordre Egyptien Du Grand Orient de France and The Masonic Magician, Philippa Faulks and Robert L.D. Cooper, Watkins, 2008, pp. 41-42 and Emanuel Swedenborg, Secret Agent on Earth and in Heaven: Jacobites, Jews, and Freemasons in Early Modern Sweden, Marsha Keith Schuchard, Leiden, Brill, 2011 and Secret Texts: The Literature of Secret Societies, Marie Mulvey Roberts, Hugh Ormsby-Lennon, AMS Press, 1995, p. 127 and Restoring the Temple of Vision: Cabalistic Freemasonry and Stuart Culture, Marsha Keith Schuchard, BRILL, 2002, p. 72 and Selected Papers, Consortium on Revolutionary Europe, 1750-1850, Institute on Napoleon and the French Revolution, Florida State University, 1994, p. 364 and The Dublin University Magazine, Volume 81, 1873, p. 75 and Leibniz, Mysticism and Religion, A.P. Coudert, R.H. Popkin, G.M. Weiner, Springer Science & Business Media, 2013, p. 84).\n\nIt is supposed that the higher, 'Ecossais', degrees of freemasonry have been invented by the adherents of the exiled House of Stuart for the purpose of being used as a political means of restoring, first, James II of England (1633-1701 CE), and afterward his son and grandson, James Francis Edward Stuart (1688-1766 CE) and Charles Edward Stuart (1720-1788 CE), respectively known in history as the Chevalier Saint George and the Young Pretender. The Battle of Culloden of 16 April 1746, which ended in defeat for the troops of Charles Edward Stuart, effectively ended the Jacobite cause. Most of the conclusions to which Masonic writers have arrived on the subject of this connection of the Stuarts with the advanced Degrees of Freemasonry are based on conjecture; but in the opinion of Albert Mackey (1807-1881 CE) there is sufficient internal evidence in the character of some of these Degrees, as well as in the known history of their organisation, to establish the fact that some connection did actually exist (see also he History of Freemasonry: It's Legends and Traditions, Albert Mackey, 1906)\n\nWith the expulsion of James II of England (1633-1701 CE) from the British throne in 1688, political exiles carried (Scottish) Masonic traditions throughout the 'Jacobite' diaspora, where they attracted a variety of monarchs, philosophers, scientists, and artists to their supposedly defeated creed and culture. James II, after his flight from England in 1688 resided at the Jesuit College of Clermont in Paris, until his removal to St. Germain. James II saw in the Jesuit morality plays of the College of Clermont a vessel for passing on a set of moral lessons. The Jesuit morality plays blended with the masques of the Stuart court, which reappeared in the elaborately theatrical ceremonies developed by Jacobite exiles and their local supporters in the so-called 'Scottish' lodges (see also Jacobite Freemasonry, Arthur Edward Waite, Kessinger Publishing, 2010 and Restoring the Temple of Vision: Cabalistic Freemasonry and Stuart Culture, Marsha Keith Schuchar, BRILL, 2002, p. 5 and The Perfection of Eloquence, Richard Curry, S.J.).\n\nChevalier Andrew M. Ramsay (1686-1743 CE) Grand Orator of the Stuart freemasonry with his Oration of 21 March 1737 (or 'Discourse of le Chevalier Ramsay given at the St.John's Lodge on 27th December 1736') would be influential in setting up the Scottish Rite on behalf of the exiled Stuarts (see also Gould's History of Freemasonry Throughout the World, Robert Freke Gould, Dudley Wright, Melvin Maynard Johnson, John Edward Allen, C. Scribner's sons, 1936 and Andrew Michael Ramsay G. van Veen,, Thoth 28, n. 2, 1977). In his oration, Ramsay referred to Masonry as having been founded in remote antiquity, but said that it was renewed in the Holy Land by the Crusaders who had united in Palestine for a noble purpose and to whom he referred to as our Ancestors. According to legend the Knights Templar had continued in Scotland after the death of Jacques de Molay (ca. 1244-1314 CE) on 18 March 1314. The myth that freemasonry was related to the Knights Templar is based on the life of Robert the Bruce (1274-1329 CE) and the legend of the Scottish Knights Templar at the Battle of Bannockburn of 24 June 1314. According to the d'Aumont legend it is said that in order to escape from the persecution that followed the suppression of the Knights Templar by the King of France, a certain Templar, named d'Aumont, accompanied by seven others, disguised as operative masons, fled into Scotland and there secretly founded another order which was the forerunner of freemasonry (see also Histoire pittoresque de la Franc-Maçonnerie et des Sociétés Secrétes Anciennes et Modernes, François-Timoléon Bègue Clavel, 1842).\n\nIn 1754, the Chevalier de Bonneville established a Chapter of the advanced Degrees at Paris, in the Jesuit College of Clermont and honoring Louis, Count of Clermont (1709-1771 CE), hence called the Chapter of Clermont or Clermont System. The system of Freemasonry of Chevalier de Bonne"
