Through the Virtual Food Drive, you can purchase high-demand healthy products, such as milk, eggs or baby formula. Your dollars will also go further with the Virtual Food Drive because of Loaves & Fishes’ cooperative buying power.\n\nTo organize a Virtual Food Drive for your business or group, contact jwiltz@loaves-fishes.org\n\nIf you are participating with a group, be sure to indicate the name of your group in the form under “Company Name.”\n\nTHANK YOU!\n\nLegacy Gifts-Planned Giving\n\nWhat Will Your Legacy Be?\n\nFor nearly 40 years, Loaves & Fishes Community Services has been serving families in need through healthy food and impactful programs for self-sufficiency. The support of our community has allowed this resounding commitment to struggling families to grow and evolve with the need. We are so deeply grateful to all the generous people who help bring our vital mission to life.\n\nYou can ensure your commitment to ending hunger and transforming lives continues through a planned gift which allows the momentum to continue. By including Loaves & Fishes in your estate plans, you can make an impact that lives on and on. Such a gift makes sure the Loaves & Fishes mission thrives into the future and ensures your legacy.\n\nThere are numerous ways to make a legacy gift; see below for some of them. When you indicate your intention to us, you will become part of our Feeding the Future Legacy Circle. This generous group has indicated that a planned gift will eventually be made to Loaves & Fishes. All of us are forever grateful for the generosity and foresight of those in the Feeding the Future Legacy Circle.\n\nFeeding the Future Legacy Circle members are recognized in our Annual Report, at our Night to End Hunger Gala, and throughout the year. Even more important, they know that they are leaving an incredible personal legacy that reflects their generous spirit.\n\nWhat is a Planned Gift?\n\nA planned gift is a specially designated gift that is usually part of your overall estate or financial plan. Including a planned gift is a very simple and easy thing to do. A planned gift may be revocable or irrevocable, frequently provides financial benefit to the charity at a future date rather than currently, and is sometimes the largest gift a donor will make.\n\nTypes of planned gifts include:\n\nBequest\n\nIRA Beneficiary Designation\n\nLife Insurance Beneficiary Designation\n\nCharitable Remainder Trust\n\nLead Trust\n\nGifts of Appreciated Securities\n\nReal Estate Gifts\n\nBequest\n\nMake a gift in your will or trust. You can choose to leave a specified amount or a percentage of your estate. Note that if you already have a will or trust, there is no need to rewrite the documents. You can simply add an amendment to your existing will or trust document.\n\nSample wording:\n\n“I give to Loaves & Fishes Community Services, located at 1871 High Grove Lane, Naperville, IL 60540 (TAX ID 36-3786777) the following (here state the amount or percentage of your estate you plan to contribute) for general support to advance the mission of Loaves & Fishes Community Services.”\n\nIRA Beneficiary Designation\n\nIt is very simple to list Loaves & Fishes Community Services as the beneficiary or partial beneficiary of your retirement plan assets. You can contact the organization holding the policy and direct the change. You may be able to make the change online.\n\nLife Insurance Policy\n\nYou may also choose to donate a life insurance policy or name Loaves & Fishes Community Services as the beneficiary of your life insurance policy, especially if your children are adults and financially stable. Contact your plan administrator or complete the change-of-beneficiary form online.\n\nCharitable Remainder Trust\n\nA charitable remainder trust is an irrevocable trust that pays you during your lifetime. The remainder is paid to Loaves & Fishes upon your death.\n\nLead Trust\n\nA lead trust is an irrevocable arrangement that provides annual gift income from the lead trust assets to Loaves & Fishes over a period of years. At the end of that period, the remaining assets are given to non-charitable beneficiaries, usually children or grandchildren. Lead trusts are particularly appropriate for assets that are likely to appreciate substantially over the life of the trust (typically 10-20 years).\n\nGifts of Securities\n\nInstead of giving cash to Loaves & Fishes, appreciated securities such stock or mutual funds can be donated directly to Loaves & Fishes.\n\nReal Estate Gift\n\nThere can be tremendous benefits to donating your home or vacation home to Loaves & Fishes. You will receive the tax benefit today and remain in your home as long as you would like. After you no longer live in the home, Loaves & Fishes would then take possession.\n\nPlease consult your advisor or attorney to determine the best way for you to give a Planned Gift.\n\nFor a list of estate planning attorneys familiar with Loaves & Fishes, click here.\n\nAll Planned Gifts are deeply appreciated and ensure that your legacy of compassion continues.\n\nTo learn more about Planned Giving to Loaves & Fishes, contact:\n\nNancy Wiersum\n\nEVP Advancement\n\n630-355-3663 Ext. 117\n\nnwiersum@loaves-fishes.org\n\nEric Gardner\n\nDirector of Philanthropy\n\n630-355-3663 Ext. 116\n\negardner@loaves-fishes.org"
