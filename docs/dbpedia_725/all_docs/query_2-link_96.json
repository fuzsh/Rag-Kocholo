        "text": "Senior Two-Sport Athlete Shines for Wolves\n\nSenior Mason Blanco is not usually the guy atop the box score the night after a win. However, being a “glue guy” means there are so many things a player can do that are integral to success that never show up on a stat sheet. Mason’s effort, high basketball IQ, and talent have played a vital role in helping the Wolves to a 23-5 overall record, which is why he is this week’s Oswego East student-athlete of the week.\n\nSports have always been a part of Mason’s life. “Playing both basketball and baseball competitively since first grade, and having two older brothers, Mason has always been a competitor,” says Michelle and Brad Blanco, Mason’s parents.\n\nThat competitive drive has helped Mason become a winner and cultivate close and personal relationships throughout his playing career. “The relationships I formed with my teammates helped me want to be a stronger competitor and improve my game,” says Mason.\n\nMason’s drive to be the best player and teammate is most evident in practice. “Mason is a student of the game, has a high basketball IQ, and we know he will always give his best effort in practice and games,” says Head Coach Ryan Velasquez. Ryan goes on to say, “Mason dedicated himself to the weight room this off-season and has always been a team-first guy. We know he will be in the right spots defensively and will be one of the hardest guys to guard because of how hard he works.”\n\nThe Wolves have a perfect 14-0 record in the SPC and recently earned the three seed in the Bolingbrook sectional. Mason has averaged 7 points, 1 assist, and 1 steal per game for a highly talented squad that has aspirations of being the first team in history to win a super-sectional and make it downstate.\n\nMason is as impressive off the court as he is on it. Angela Scharbert, Mason’s culinary teacher, says, “Mason has a great sense of humor and is overall a kind person.” She goes on to say, “He is outgoing, positive, encouraging, and helpful. Mason was very inclusive and supportive of the students in my class who are a part of our life skills program and would demo class recipes, participate in discussions, and became very knowledgeable about cooking.\n\nMason has earned a 3.4 GPA as a student at OE, and his resume has earned him acceptance into the University of Alabama, which he will attend this fall, and plans to major in Business. “Mason has always been able to set goals for himself and succeed in reaching them, even if that means taking extra time to get there or revising them. We can see him continuing to reach his goals and succeeding in business by doing what he has always done,” says Michelle and Brad.\n\nAngela believes Mason has both the intellect and social makeup to excel in business. “Mason is very outgoing and talks to everyone. He is confident but not arrogant. He is inclusive of everyone and a kind young man,” says Angela.\n\nIn addition to academics and athletics, Mason is always looking for an opportunity to give back. In the fall, he and fellow senior basketball and baseball player Ryan Johnson went back to their junior high alma mater, Plank Junior High, and helped coach their basketball team.\n\nMason’s senior year will end in a flurry because as soon as basketball season ends, he will grab his mitt to man the shortstop position for the Wolves baseball team. Although his schedule is busy, the relationships Mason has formed through athletics are something he will always cherish, and his advice to future Wolves is to do the same, saying, “Get involved with as many activities as you can because that is how you will meet your closest friends in high school.”"
