        "text": "The Comfort of Moses and the Ten Commandments\n\nRichard Dial (b. 1955)\n\nBessemer, Alabama\n\n1988\n\nSteel and wood with hemp and enamel\n\n57 x 33 x 32 1/2 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum purchase made possible with grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Metropolitan Life Foundation, 1990.3.5\n\nPhoto by Brad Wrisley\n\nRichard Dial—part of the creative Dial family of artists from Bessemer, Alabama—is an accomplished metalworker and furniture maker. In 1984, he cofounded Dial Metal Patterns, a small business in metal patio furniture. He learned many of the skills needed to start his entrepreneurial business while working as a machinist at Standard Pullman.\n\nThis whimsical and conceptual makeover of an outdoor chair is part of a wrought-iron furniture line Dial calls Shade Tree Comfort. Anthropomorphic, stylized, and full of humor, this line combines utility with Dial’s individualistic decorative flair. The idea behind “shade tree comfort” was to create motifs dealing with comfort and ease, such as “the comfort of the first born” and “the comfort and discomfort of first love,” for example. The understructure of this wrought-iron chair is enhanced by several accessories: a mop imitating a beard and wood and rope creating the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments. Each additive element is a clever detail interpreting the biblical Moses.\n\nScenic Overmantel\n\nWinthrop Chandler (1747–1790)\n\nPetersham, Massachusetts\n\nc. 1780–1785\n\nOil on pine panel with beveled edges\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2013.1.20\n\nThe fireplace was the focal point of most early American homes. By the early decades of the eighteenth century the areas surrounding the hearth began to receive painted embellishments. Chimneypieces, or overmantels, were set directly into the woodwork over a mantel or painted on a separate panel and then wall-hung. These received some of the earliest landscapes painted in America. Sometimes the depictions played a symbolic role, representing the actual properties of a wealthy landowner, or the scene of a significant event in the homeowner’s life. This is one of at least eight overmantels painted by Connecticut artist Winthrop Chandler, who is best known for his imposing portraits of family relations and friends in Connecticut and Massachusetts. Many of his overmantels portray imaginary vistas that nevertheless incorporate typical New England architecture and landscapes, with houses painted in bright colors and window frames and corner boards outlined in white. This example was painted for the artist’s cousin, John Chandler (1742–1794), a wealthy merchant in Petersham. Family tradition maintained that it portrayed London Bridge and the surrounding area before the Great Fire of 1666. However, it is more likely a romanticized view of the Italian city of Florence.\n\nMan with Facial Paralysis\n\nJosé F. Dos Santos (dates unknown)\n\nPatos, Paraiba, Brazil\n\nc. 1977\n\nPaint on wood\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Roberto Emerson Camera Benjamin Latin American Collection, 1991.4.71\n\nEx-voto is a Latin term meaning “from a vow.” Ex-votos are a type of Catholic offering to saints in gratitude for the answered prayer of a devotee. Also known as a milagro, or “miracle,” an ex-voto conveys the thanks for an answered prayer and operates as a type of payment for a fulfilled promise. For example, a person who delivered a healthy child might offer an image of a baby at the altar of a saint, or someone who survived a car crash might commission a carving of an automobile, and place that visual prayer at the shrine of another particular saint. A long-standing and universal practice, the making of ex-votos can incorporate silver, gold, brass, wood, bone, plastic, clay, or even wax. Ex-votos come in all shapes and sizes and are crafted at all levels of simplicity or complexity. They are usually made by working artisans as a sideline practice, though many homemade examples also exist.\n\nIn Brazil, particularly in the northeast region, ex-votos are usually made of wax or wood. Brazilian ex-votos are additionally interesting because they illustrate the blending of African, native South American, and Catholic traditions common in the northeast; Afro-Brazilians believe that the object actually contains the affliction or the illness and operates as a magical amulet by embodying the affliction. This ex-voto, which is quite distinctive in its painted details, probably was made for someone who survived a stroke.\n\nAnna Gould Crane and Granddaughter Janette\n\nSheldon Peck (1797–1868)\n\nAurora, Illinois\n\nc. 1845\n\nOil on canvas\n\n35 1/2 x 45 1/2 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2013.1.18\n\nBefore the daguerreotype was introduced into the United States, in 1839, painted portraiture represented the primary means of documenting self and family. Initially, the two methods competed side by side: photography offered an inexpensive, relatively quick, and true-to-life image, while the painted portrait held the weight of tradition and afforded the luxury of large scale and color. The aesthetic of the studio photograph had an effect that is evident in portraits of the Crane family of Aurora, Illinois, by Sheldon Peck. The artist began painting about 1820 in his native Vermont before moving to western New York and then to Illinois. Peck’s earliest efforts were stark and sober bust-length portraits on wooden panels. In Illinois, he introduced a brighter palette and a larger format of full-length figures, as seen in this example. The figures are carefully composed within a stagelike interior with a few well-chosen props—a baize cloth-covered table, an urn of flowers, a Bible. The trompe-l’oeil frame is an added attraction, as the portrait was ready to hang without any further expense. Janette Wilhelmina (1840–1861) is portrayed with her paternal grandmother, Anna Gould Crane (1774–?). According to notes in the family Bible, their portrait was painted on a linen sheet provided by the family and was paid for with the trade of one cow.\n\nLectern Box\n\nArtist unidentified\n\nNew England\n\nSecond half 19th century\n\nPaint on wood with applied printed pages\n\n7 1/2 x 14 1/4 x 10 1/2 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2013.1.23\n\nPhoto © 2000 John Bigelow Taylor, New York\n\nA sense of playfulness underlies the somber aspect of this trompe-l’oeil box. It can be confidently surmised that it was intended to hold a book, possibly a family Bible. The box simulates a cloth-covered lectern, with heavy tassels at the front corners and a green baize pad on top. A three-dimensional book sits on top of the “lectern” and is opened to a well-thumbed page containing three stanzas of verse. Completing the illusion, the poem is printed on paper and applied to the carved open book. The sensation of surprise and delight provoked by blurring the lines between reality and fantasy continued to be an aspect of the aesthetic of Fancy until it faded from fashion later in the nineteenth century.\n\nFamily Record for Andrew Bickford and Olive Clark\n\nJoshua Pool (1787–?)\n\nGloucester, Massachusetts\n\nc. 1820\n\nWatercolor, pencil, and ink on paper\n\n15 x 12 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 1998.17.6\n\nPhoto by John Parnell\n\nFamily records featuring a tree emerging from twined hearts developed in a defined area of New England, with the greatest concentration in eastern and central Middlesex County, Massachusetts, Cape Ann in eastern Essex County, Massachusetts, and coastal New Hampshire and Connecticut. The majority of needleworks featuring the image were made by female members of the family as students, while the watercolor examples are primarily the work of professional male artists. On Cape Ann, the convention was transmitted through specific family lines and in family records made primarily by Joshua Pool, William Richardson, and William Saville. Of people named in twenty-eight Cape Ann records, only Olive Clark was not a native of the region, further demonstrating the insular nature of the imagery.\n\nThe Bickford-Clark record is signed by Joshua Pool, who was probably a resident of Gloucester and possibly a student of William Saville. Olive Clark married Andrew Bickford in 1808 and gave birth to eight children between the years of 1810 and 1828. In addition to vital statistics about their families, this and other decorated Gloucester family records provide a good deal of information about local vernacular architecture. The one-and-a-half story, center-chimney house with gambrel roof is an early form, and its retention as a vital part of this farm shows the generational nature of New England architecture. The property limits are defined by a dry stone wall, which developed in part as a convenient way to use stones unearthed as the soil was tilled. The hand production of family records persisted until the middle of the nineteenth century, when they were largely replaced by printed forms.\n\nMary Valentine Bucher\n\nJacob Maentel (1778–?)\n\nSchaefferstown, Pennsylvania\n\nc. 1825–1830\n\nWatercolor, gouache, ink, and pencil on paper\n\n16 1/2 x 10 1/2 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2013.1.7\n\nAs a vehicle for documentation, folk portraits convey a wealth of information about their subjects. Each portrayal represents an agreement of priorities and conventions between artist and subject. This is deepened when the participants are personally known to each other, as was often the case between Pennsylvania German artist Jacob Maentel and many of his subjects, who were also his neighbors. In this portrait pair Mary Bucher stands proudly in her colorful domestic domain holding a book in her hand, probably a religious text, while Dr. Bucher is placed in a detailed professional interior that proclaims his medical calling. An identical chair and bisected table in each portrait visually connect the two, and serve as a reminder that a village doctor’s office was usually in his own home.\n\nDr. Christian Bucher\n\nJacob Maentel (1778–?)\n\nSchaefferstown, Pennsylvania\n\nc. 1825–1830\n\nWatercolor, gouache, ink, and pencil on paper\n\n16 1/2 x 10 1/2 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2013.1.8\n\nAs a vehicle for documentation, folk portraits convey a wealth of information about their subjects.

Borek, 1994.9.1\n\nPhoto by Gavin Ashworth\n\nAlthough some American medical students had the opportunity to study surgery abroad, the vast majority of local physicians practiced surgery without the benefit of training in major European medical centers. It is likely that the young man portrayed in this portrait was such a local physician-surgeon. That he was proud of his profession is clear; he has elected to have himself portrayed holding a Tenon-type amputation saw. In the period before anesthesia, surgery involved a “human ordeal,” and the most important element was speed. Various methods were tried to relieve the pain and anxiety of waking surgery, including mesmerism and other experimental techniques, but it was not until the mid-nineteenth century that inhalation anesthesia was devised.\n\nThe tradition of profile portraiture was well established in the United States by the 1760s and 1770s, inspired by heroic portrait medallions and coins from ancient Roman culture. By the first years of the nineteenth century, the introduction of mechanical devices such as the physiognotrace that captured the exact outline of a profile revolutionized the general availability of profile portraits at a modest expense. Several portraits by this as-yet-unidentified artist are known, all painted in a precise manner against plain backgrounds on small wooden panels.\n\nSelf Portrait at 84\n\nSidney McLaren (1895–1979)\n\nJamaica\n\n1979\n\nOil on cardboard\n\n15 3/4 x 13 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Maurice C. and Patricia L. Thompson, 2003.20.7\n\nPhoto by Gavin Ashworth\n\n“In the yard in which I was living, one day I took a bit of cardboard and pencil and started to draw the house, trees, fencing, etc. After showing it around, people praised it, so I was more interested and discovered that my mental faculties started to work by my concentrating on art. If it pleases the Lord, my desire is to go on drawing and painting until I can do no more.” Sidney McLaren is one of the most respected self-taught artists of Jamaica.\n\nIn this compelling portrait, he limned himself in grisaille with pencil and used colorful oils to fill in his shirt, the sky, and the landscape. While these bordering items are loosely and boldly rendered, the obvious care and concern he takes in his facial portrait is endearing. He signs it, “Sidney McLaren—Artist at 84 yrs. old. Life is What One Makes it. No Two Men Alike.”\n\nMantel\n\nArtist unidentified\n\nDeep River, Connecticut\n\nc. 1815–1825\n\nPaint on wood\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Steven and Helen Kellogg, 2001.17.3\n\nArchitectural woodwork in America began to receive decorative paint treatments by the early eighteenth century. Painters’ manuals and handbooks offered instruction in painting wood surfaces in imitation of expensive or exotic materials, such as marble, tortoiseshell, or wood grain.\n\nPhoto by Gavin Ashworth\n\nThis mantel from the Connecticut River Valley is an interior architectural form that echoes the style of Federal-period architecture in design and construction. The complex flattop cornice rests on fluted columns that terminate in blocks with marbleized painting. Another feature is the carved patera, a fluted oval embellishment that is found on building exteriors and interior forms such as doorways, cornices, and furniture. Although the maker of this mantel is unidentified, it is related to the work of Nehemiah Randall (1770–1850), a western Massachusetts joiner.\n\nScottish Castle\n\nJohn Kane (1860–1934)\n\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania\n\nn.d.\n\nOil on panel\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Maurice C. and Patricia L. Thompson, 2003.20.1\n\nPhoto by Gavin Ashworth\n\nJohn Kane employs the necessity of memory in this remembered landscape of Scotland, the home of his youth. Kane moved from Scotland to the United States when he was 19 in the hope of finding lucrative work. His life in America was full of disappointments and hardships: many menial-labor jobs, work-related accidents, lay-offs, alcoholism, homelessness, and poverty.\n\nThroughout all of this adversity, Kane taught himself to paint and ultimately received recognition during his lifetime for his artwork. Many now consider him one of the masters of twentieth-century folk art. This painting, one of several memory paintings Kane completed, depicts Balmoral Castle, the Scottish home of the British Royal Family since the nineteenth century.\n\nBlanket Chest\n\nArtist Unidentified, Matteson Type\n\nVicinity of South Shaftsbury, Vermont\n\nc. 1825\n\nPaint on wood\n\n40 x 40 x 17 3/4 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Howard and Jean Lipman in honor of Robert Bishop, American Folk Art Museum director (1977–1991), 1991.10.1\n\nPhoto by John Parnell\n\nThe distinctive patterning on this blanket chest identifies it with a group of similar pieces of case furniture made in the vicinity of South Shaftsbury, Vermont. Stylistically, the painted decoration is defined by cross-banding, stringing, and bold elliptical strokes. The grain painting may in fact be a rural interpretation of locally produced high-style furniture fashioned from “curled maple,” which was, as Zadock Thompson noted in his History of Vermont (1842), “used by chair makers and cabinet makers in many kinds of their work.” When carefully pieced, this figured indigenous wood created dramatic visual effects that have been likened to the “illusion of motion.” The furniture made by brothers Daniel and Asa Loomis demonstrates the direct influence of New York City design on high-style Vermont furniture, particularly that of the Richard Allison shop. This furniture in turn influenced the work of rural craftsmen, such as the unidentified maker who produced the brilliantly patterned South Shaftsbury furniture that simulates, in abstract painted designs, the high color and patterning of native maple.\n\nThe Shaftsbury group, previously ascribed to Thomas Matteson, was first identified by Caroline Hebb, who noted similar decorative traits among seven pieces of painted furniture, two of which were dated 1824 and signed with the names Thomas Matteson and Thomas G. Matison. Since then, two additional pieces bearing the Matteson name have been located, one with the intriguing inscription “Benonia Matteson to B. Burlingame Dr. [debit] / To Paint $2.70 / To Paint & Grain Chest $2.00 / $4.70.” To date, six Thomases and four Benonias can be counted among the large Matteson family in Vermont during the first quarter of the nineteenth century, though none has been specifically associated with furniture making or decorating. In addition to the exuberant painted decoration, the group shares the construction trait of trapezoidal pieces of wood, some of which are notched into lower backboards. On the back of each chest, two boards are nailed to the side panels, with the top board usually much wider than the bottom one.”\n\nMedical Treatment Sign\n\nArtist unidentified\n\nPort-au-Prince, Haiti\n\nc. 1985\n\nOil on Masonite\n\n24 x 33 x 1/8 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum purchase, 2007.4.12\n\nWhile the folk art collecting community has long been interested in trade signs made before the twentieth century, homemade, one-of-a-kind trade signs of our time are not as desired, though are still in use, primarily in developing countries around the world. In places like Africa and the Americas, where an independent aesthetic is valued and not yet run over by the homogenized corporate culture of America, one can still find fabulous, individualistic, hand-painted trade signs. Hand-painted billboards and shop signs, like this public service announcement in Creole, can be seen on motor vehicles, the sides of homes, and the facades of buildings all over the world. Closer to home in urban environments such as New York City, collectors are just beginning to detect and collect a “millennial trade sign” in the numerous hand-crafted, cardboard signs made and used by the homeless.\n\nThis trade sign, found in Haiti in the mid-1980s, was made by an unidentified artist in Port-au-Prince for Marcel Isaac’s alternative health center. It was made to announce alternative medical treatments for conjunctivitis, as well as symptoms to aid in identifying the disease.\n\nCrewel Bedcover\n\nArtist unidentified\n\nNew England or New York\n\n1815–1825\n\nWool with wool embroidery\n\n100 x 84 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Virginia Esmerian, 1995.32.1\n\nBedcovers used in American homes through the middle of the nineteenth century were largely homemade, though the fabric might be imported or domestically made by professional weavers. This richly embellished bedcover belongs to a small group of early textiles ascribed to a period from about 1760 to 1830. Most are worked on a black, or occasionally brown, twill-woven woolen foundation, and they share a similar composition of a basket of flowers against a field of vines and flowers. The dense surface embroidery is a combination of large and small floral motifs that gives an impression of symmetry, though no sections are exactly alike. It is worked in crewel, a worsted yarn of loosely twisted two-ply colored threads. Drawing upon seventeenth-century English needlework traditions, early American embroidery reinterpreted motifs in a more naturalistic style using fewer varieties of stitches: mainly self-couching Roumanian, flat, outline, and stem, though chain, buttonhole, herringbone, and loop stitches were also used. The group of crewel-embroidered bedcovers to which this example belongs was made primarily in Massachusetts and then in New York State, as migration from New England increased by the end of the eighteenth century.\n\nS.D. Plum Tavern Sign\n\nArtist unidentified\n\nProbably Meriden, Connecticut\n\n1813\n\nPaint on pine with iron\n\n51 x 34 x 3 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2013.1.55\n\nPhoto courtesy Sotheby’s, New York\n\nSometime around 1803, Seth D. Plum bought a house on Broad Street in Meriden, Connecticut. Conveniently located along the route of the new Meriden turnpike, which opened in 1799, it served as a tavern for many years. Meriden was a busy stopover, long known as halfway point on the road between Hartford and New Haven. As for Seth Plum, he appears to have been an enterprising man who achieved a certain level of prosperity, for he also operated a tin shop in Meriden from about 1808 to 1835.\n\nThe signboard for Plum’s tavern is a fine example of the most popular type of American tavern sign from about the middle of the eighteenth century until the mid-1820s or so. A scrolled and framed painted pine plank set in a vertical orientation between two turned posts, it incorporates design elements that were also typical of the architecture and furniture of the period. The coach and horses are particularly engaging, especially the way in which the horses are arranged one slightly in front of the other, with multiple pairs of legs giving the impression of rapid movement.\n\nSignboards have a long history in both North America and Europe. In 1644, the General Court of Connecticut ordered all towns in the colony to provide a place where travelers and strangers could obtain food and lodging. Following English tradition, inns and taverns were prominently marked with painted signs, often suspended between two high posts as close as possible to the road. At the same time, hanging signs had become subject to regulation in several European cities because of their ever-expanding numbers. A few years after London’s Great Fire of 1666, for example, an ordinance was enacted that required signboards to be affixed to the walls of buildings instead of projecting out into the streets. Apparently, the efforts of merchants and tradesmen to continually outdo one another in order to attract business had resulted in a dense, overhead canopy that clogged narrow urban streets and threatened pedestrians.\n\nConnecticut supported a large number of taverns and inns in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries because of its extensive network of roads and the heavy traffic generated by its proximity to several urban areas in New England and New York. In 1800, more than 650 licensed innkeepers were operating there. Consequently, the state was something of a center for signboard production and ornamental painting. It has been estimated that more than five thousand signs were used by taverns, inns, and hotels in Connecticut between 1750 and 1850. Of these, only about one hundred survive today.\n\nStorage Jar or Crock\n\nArtist unidentified\n\nNew England, probably Boston\n\nc. 1850–1870\n\nGlazed gray stoneware with cobalt decoration\n\n26 5/8 x 15 1/4 in. diam. (at top)\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2013.1.24\n\nPhoto © 2000 John Bigelow Taylor, New York\n\nDurable and inexpensive salt-glazed stoneware decorated with cobalt oxide blue slip was made in most parts of New England. The production of commercial stonewares increased as commerce and the Industrial Revolution brought about the wider processing and distribution of foodstuffs, spirits, and agricultural goods. Manufacturers up and down the East Coast placed orders for stoneware jars, bottles, jugs, and larger open-mouthed crocks, and many potteries offered to customize orders with the names of enterprises, various decorative advertising and ornamental patterns, or scenes such as that decorating this large snuff container.\n\nResearch into manufacturing potteries in Boston have revealed no such pottery operating under this name or at this address during the nineteenth century. Therefore, it is assumed that the inscribed company of “Clark Brewer and Son” was a dry-goods merchant or tobacco shop at the address, and that this crock was a custom-designed advertising fixture for the retailing of snuff within that establishment. Rappee snuff was a dark, pungent, finely ground mixed snuff, also known as Cavendish or Indian weed, and was manufactured in the West Indies, England, and Holland, as well as America. Functioning much like the fabled “cigar-store Indian,” this crock’s decorative scene depicts an American Indian chief in full regalia offering tobacco in both its raw and its processed state. Large in scale, this scene, perhaps of the legendary Seminole chief Osceola, would have been a curiosity drawing attention to the store and its contents.\n\nExamples of nineteenth-century American commercial stonewares with detailed, intricately incised sgraffito decoration on a large scale are quite rare, and few of this quality are known to survive. Its size, with a capacity of more than one hundred dry pints, as well as its finely executed decoration and glaze, suggest the work of a skilled potter, whose identity remains unknown.\n\nSultana\n\nAttributed to the workshop of Samuel Anderson Robb (act. 1876–1903)\n\nNew York\n\nc. 1880\n\nPaint on wood with iron\n\n86 x 26 1/2 x 28 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2013.1.56\n\nPhoto © 2000 John Bigelow Taylor, New York\n\nThe nineteenth century saw an explosion in three-dimensional lifelike and lifesize figures that were used to advertise a variety of businesses, especially shops that sold tobacco. Often these figures took the form of popular characters from history, literature, and theater, or were caricatures of ethnic and cultural stereotypes, notably American Indians. In New York City, a distinctive show-figure style emerged from three generations of shipcarvers who shared master-apprentice relationships and a number of short-lived business partnerships. Among the five master carvers primarily responsible for the style were Samuel Robb (1851–1928) and Thomas White (1825–1902). Robb operated the most successful workshop during the last quarter of the century, first at 195 Canal Street from 1876 to 1888, when he was joined by White, and then at 114 Centre Street from 1888 to 1903.\n\nThis monumental Sultana has survived intact with an original paint surface that shows almost no evidence of retouching. This is rare among nineteenth-century tobacconist figures, which spent much of their working lives outdoors, exposed to the elements. The figure’s form echoes the famous pose of the Statue of Liberty. The statue was installed in New York harbor in 1886, but was already well known through publicity and fund-raising efforts.\n\nWhirligig\n\nLaurentino Rosa (life dates unknown)\n\nRio Branco do Sul, Parana, Brazil\n\nc. 1990\n\nPaint on wood with wire\n\n5 1/4 x 19 x 12 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum purchase, 2007.4.18\n\nArticulated by the wind, whirligigs have been made for centuries to invite whimsy into a landscape and to attract attention. Whirligigs are usually identified as a nineteenth-century folk art form, but this figure—smoking and holding machetes—was used to attract business to Laurentino Rosa’s twentieth-century popcorn cart in a public park in Brazil. It bears a Star of David because, according to the artist, the park was near a Jewish neighborhood.\n\nBecause Rosa is Brazilian and from the northeastern part of the country, this wind toy may depict Lampiao, a Robin Hood–like folk hero from the region.\n\nThe Titanic\n\nJames Crane (1877–1974)\n\nEllsworth, Maine\n\nc. 1968\n\nOil on oil cloth with paper collage\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Robert Bishop, 1985.37.1\n\nArtists, even after the invention of photography in the mid-nineteenth century, continued in the twentieth century to paint portraits as a means of documenting people or architecture or ships. Ship portraiture occurs throughout art history, and this painting of the Titanic by Maine artist James Crane is a useful way for the artist to convey his admiration of oceangoing vessels. Crane’s multi-perspective view of the ill-fated Titanic is a captivating portrait because the innocent appeal and charm contrasts so sharply with the devastating tragedy endured by the passengers of the doomed ocean liner in 1912.\n\nCrane painted several versions of the Titanic, as well as numerous other portraits of ships north of Bar Harbor along the Route 1 coastal road of Ellsworth, Maine. He also painted townscapes. Crane worked with readily available material, such as paint, oil cloth, bed sheets, plywood, and paper collage. His entire life was peppered with creative exploration. As a young man he invented a “lock washer,” and harbored a desire to construct a flying machine based on a 1909 vision he experienced (which he only realized toward the end of his life). Although his airship never successfully flew, he displayed it in his yard alongside hand-built wooden ship models and paintings, all made by the artist while in his 80s\n\nYarn Reel\n\nArtist unidentified\n\nProbably Connecticut\n\nc. 1830–1850\n\nPaint on wood\n\n39 1/4 x 16 x 26 1/8 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum purchase, Eva and Morris Feld Folk Art Acquisition Fund, 1981.12.10\n\nPhoto by John Parnell\n\nThe large quantities of yarn typically needed in the period of home-produced textiles created a demand for a type of device that would wind the yarn into consistent skeins for later use in knitting and weaving. Yarn reels were used until the home manufacture of woven textiles was rendered obsolete by commercial goods. Many of these reels indicated when a skein had been wound by means of a weasel—a contraption of a gear, pin, or wooden spring—that would click when the round was finished. The circumference of the reel was about six-and-a-half feet, and one knot equaled forty threads, or rounds. This knot was marked until there were ten knots, or one skein. Connecticut reels often had a vase-shaped splat to which the weasel was attached. The maker of this piece transformed the basic vase into a decorated human figure. By 1850, home production had decreased substantially, and reels of this type were no longer necessary.\n\nSgrafitto Plate with Horse and Rider\n\nJohn Neis (1785–1867)\n\nUpper Salford Township, Pennsylvania\n\n1805\n\nGlazed red earthenware\n\n1 3/4 x 12 3/8 in. diam.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2013.1.26\n\nPhoto by John Parnell\n\nA number of fine sgraffito-decorated plates similar to this example depicting a galloping horse and rider and with floral or verse-inscribed borders survive from the pottery of John (or Johannes) Neis. Several potters with similar names, some with close family ties, worked in the area of Rockhill and Salford Townships in Bucks and Montgomery Counties during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, and the nature of surviving records and fluctuations in the spelling of their names have confused their identities. The John Neis who created this plate was the son of Henry and Maria Elizabeth Neis of Salford Township; his uncles Abraham and Johannes Neis were also potters. John Neis is thought to have apprenticed with his uncles or with David Spinner, a potter of Swiss descent who was also employed by the elder Neises and whose work shows a close stylistic tie to this plate. John’s sons Abraham and John followed in their father’s and great-uncles’ footsteps and became potters in Montgomery County, continuing operations in the area until the end of the nineteenth century.\n\nDecorated earthenware plates with horse-and-rider motifs and banded inscriptions based on folk proverbs or humorous maxims are found in earlier German and Swiss pottery traditions. In Pennsylvania, the pattern was maintained by immigrant potters, and rather than portraying a particular military figure, such as Emperor Joseph II or George Washington, the figure had likely become a generic, preferred motif. Civic celebrations and local militia exercises with mounted cavalry riders also could have provided inspiration for such figural portrayals. Many of the sgrafitto floral designs executed by Neis have the fluid, confident character of a metal engravimg and utilize similar curved, finely scored parallel lines to delineate the petals of flowers, shading, or the turn of a leaf.\n\nFemale Figure Wearing Ghangra\n\nNek Chand (b. 1924)\n\nChandigarh, India\n\nc. 1965\n\nTinted concrete over metal armature\n\n33 x 6 x 6 in.\n\nPhoto by August Bandal\n\nAmerican Folk art Museum, gift of the artist with additional support from Charlotte Frank, Kathryn Morrison, Cheryl Rivers, and Steve Simons, 2001.13.2\n\nBegun as a secret landscape project in Chandigarh, India, the Rock Garden by Nek Chand has become a public park for the community. In an act of passive civil disobedience, in the early 1970s, citizens of Chandigarh blocked off Rock Garden and the roads leading to it, denying access to government officials who were intent on destroying it. This community activism virtually saved Chand’s sculptural environment and preserved it as a place where people could visit, relax, and be amused. Now the second-most visited site in India (second to the Taj Mahal), Rock Garden receives government funds, is tended by city workers under the management of Chand, and is an integral part of life for the citizens of Chandigarh.\n\nMuch like the United States, India is a country entrenched in class differences and the survival of Rock Garden periodically pits the working class against government officials. Chand began to construct the fantasy environment now known as Rock Garden in 1958, while working as a road inspector in the city of Chandigarh, India. Inspired by the poured-concrete techniques of architect Le Corbusier, who designed the city of Chandigarh, Chand worked in secret in forested public land at the edge of the city. By the 1970s, he had filled his outdoor art installation with figures constructed of concrete and embellished with found materials, including rocks, tile, glass, and paint. Today, with as many as three thousand figures, this remarkable landscape covers more than twenty-five acres.\n\nThis sculpture is an early example of Chand’s artwork. Shell is inset into the concrete for facial detailing, and ground-up bricks add red color to the cement material. It was never integrated into the public environment of Rock Garden, but, rather, was made for the artist’s own satisfaction.\n\nDupatta Mithuna Plaque\n\nNek Chand (b. 1924)\n\nChandigarh, India\n\nc. 1965\n\nTinted concrete over metal armature\n\n33 x 10 x 15 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of the artist with additional support from Charlotte Frank, Kathryn Morrison, Cheryl Rivers, and Steve Simons, 2001.13.5\n\nPhoto by August Bandal\n\nNenuphars/Paix Christi\n\nAloise Corbaz (1886–1964)\n\nSwitzerland\n\nMid-20th century\n\nCrayon, colored pencil, geranium-flower juice, and thread on machine-wove paper; double-sided\n\n57 7/8 x 27 5/8 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Etienne Forel and Jacqueline Porret-Forel in honor of Sam and Betsey Farber, 2002.8.1\n\nPhoto by Gavin Ashworth\n\nBorn in Lausanne, Switzerland, Aloïse Corbaz (1886–1964) moved to Germany before World War I and was employed as a governess for the chaplain of Kaiser Wilhelm II. She began to experience delusions of a romantic relationship with her employer and exhibit an agitated manner and religious fervor, and she was institutionalized in 1918 for schizophrenia. Two years later, Corbaz made her first drawings. She utilized what was available to her in the confined setting but enriched her colorful works with an idiosyncratic assortment of found materials, such as paper packaging, magazine pages, and yarn as well as toothpaste and the juice pressed from flower petals. With these humble materials she created a fanciful world inhabited by kings, queens, dukes, and duchesses. Perspective and proportion are rendered useless in Corbaz’s scroll-like drawings and paintings.\n\nCharlestown Prison\n\nArtist unidentified\n\nCharlestown, Massachusetts\n\nc. 1851\n\nWatercolor, pencil, and ink on paper\n\n15 1/2 x 20 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2005.8.12\n\nPhoto © 2000 John Bigelow Taylor, New York\n\nPopular notions of community evoke a supportive and industrious network of neighbors with commonly held values and aims. Similarly, strong bonds may be formed through less benign circumstances. Strictures of space, behavior, and activity due to confinement forge an insular community with its own rules, apart from the world at large. This watercolor captures such an example in its depiction of the looming imposition of prison architecture on the regimented lives of its inmates and their proscribed activities within its walls. Before the early nineteenth century Massachusetts had no institutions of confinement that held large numbers of prisoners; punishments were generally meted out on an individual basis. From 1804 to 1805 a secure state prison was built on five acres of land in Charlestown. For the first sixty years in the life of the prison, inmates wore uniforms that were half blue and half red, with painted caps. A yellow stripe was added for repeat offenders, and convicts were tattooed before being released. This was an improvement, though, over previous mutilating punishments, a practice outlawed in Massachusetts about the time the Charlestown prison was built. Originally hailed as a model institution, within its first few years the Massachusetts State Prison in Charlestown became notorious for its cruel conditions.\n\nNoah’s Ark\n\nArtist unidentified\n\nProbably England\n\n1790–1814\n\nBone and wood with iron, pigment, paper, and nails\n\n8 1/2 x 14 x 9 1/4 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Jane, Steven, and Eric Lang and Jacqueline Loewe Fowler in memory of Robert Lang 1999.14.1\n\nPhoto by John Parnell\n\nNoah’s Ark is a prime example of the intriguing bone art of nineteenth-century European prisoners of war. By 1815, after the end of the Napoleonic wars and a series of revolutionary wars that wreaked havoc across Europe, thousands of French seamen (and some Dutch and Americans) were imprisoned in England, some for more than a dozen years. During this period of confinement, friends and family of officers, who generally had privileges greater than those afforded to regular soldiers, were often allowed to supplement the prisons’ inadequate rations of food, clothing, and amenities. For the ordinary seaman, however, bartering became a necessity. Many “ordinary” prisoners came from the French port city of Dieppe, a center of trade with the Ivory Coast that was known for ivory carving and ship modeling. Prisoners with carving skills found a ready market for items created from animal bones recycled from prison kitchens. In addition to bone, the only supplies needed were a knife, a small amount of dye, and glue made from boiled fish bones. Highest in demand were ships of varying sizes made to scale; guillotines, chess sets, boxes, playing cards, sewing implements, and mirror frames also were valued.\n\nNoah’s Ark resembles other works from a prisoner-of-war camp that had been located at Norman Cross, England, some of which are housed in the nearby Peterborough Museum and Art Gallery. This intricate and superbly crafted piece has an ingenious mechanism that resembles that on a carving in the Peterborough collection. Both feature a crank that animates the figures—when the crank onNoah’s Ark is turned, the animal pairs move up a gangplank into the vessel. The elaborate, formal architectural details in the upper portion of the ark, the square tower at the dock, and the windows recall the architecture of the Norman Cross camp, which closed in 1814. Bone carving by prisoners is sometimes confused with scrimshaw, whale skeletal material carved and incised by sailors during long whaling ventures. The two handicrafts are separate, but the are similar in some ways and should be studied in tandem.\n\nDevil House\n\nFrank Albert Jones (1900–1969)\n\nHuntsville, Texas\n\nc. 1964–1969\n\nColored pencil and pencil on paper\n\n30 x 40 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Chapman Kelley, 2003.21.1\n\nPhoto by Gavin Ashworth\n\nSome communities are unexpected, such as the community that evolves from prison life. Prison systems develop into places where prisoners are both colleagues and adversaries to one another, where relationships are established based on power, love, money, and time. Within the environment of prison life, unlikely artistic expressions have flowered over time and over cultures. Tattooing is perhaps the most commonly known artistic expression in prison life, but there are numerous examples of more fully developed arts, which are often allowed to mature in the gray environment of incarceration.\n\nIn 1964, Frank Jones was serving a life sentence for murder at the Texas state penitentiary in Huntsville when he began to salvage red and blue accountants’ pencil stubs and discarded paper from the prison office where he worked. With this limited palette, he rather quickly developed his singular forms and subjects, architectural structures constructed from barbed-wire-like shapes. He called them “devil houses” and peopled them with “haints,” or ghosts. Each creature smiles, so as, in the artist’s words, “to get you to come closer . . . to drag you down and make you do bad things.” Some of his drawings recall the architecture of a penitentiary. The codes of communal prison life—the cell, the barbed wire, the clock, the dehumanized creatures—are evident everywhere. Jones signed many of his drawings with only his prison number, further marking the community and the culture from which this artwork was born.\n\nCouple With Feet Touching\n\nInez Nathaniel Walker (1911–1990)\n\nNew York\n\n1973\n\nColored pencil, pencil, and crayon on paper\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Mr. and Mrs. William G. Webb, 1996.22.215\n\nIn the early 1970s, Inez Nathaniel Walker was an inmate at the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility, in Westchester County, New York, serving a sentence for homicide. Walker was in her 60s at this time, and, in an attempt to occupy herself and prevent mixing with what she perceived was a dangerous crowd, she started to draw. Using felt-tip pens, ink pens, pencil, and crayon, the artist worked on various sizes of paper, producing drawings in a quick, prolific manner. Interested in figures and visages rather than landscapes, backdrops, and environments, she drew endless depictions of people she knew, imagined, or saw on television and in popular media.\n\nExploiting line, Walker created stylized portraits employing cross-hatching, dotting, and undulating marks. She became caught up in the rhythm of consecutive parallel lines and the decorative results of curlicues and squiggles. One pictorial device the artist seemed to rely on frequently was a preference for portraiture in profile, even if the figure is in a primarily frontal pose.\n\nIn this drawing, a man sits in an easy chair while a woman hands him money, with their feet (not drawn to scale) touching and seeming to be the point from which all activity comes from.

However, the circumstances for prisoners of war are necessarily different from those of people convicted of crimes, who may be confined for many years but whose environment is possibly more stable. The American Civil War gave rise to prison camps infamous for their terrible living conditions. Point Lookout Prison, established at the mouth of the Potomac in 1863 after the Battle of Gettysburg, was designed to hold ten thousand men, but more than twice that number of Confederate soldiers and civilians were housed in tents, often with no blankets and only threadbare clothing. Soldiers were dependent upon their own wits to garner extra rations, blankets, or other amenities needed to survive their internment. John Jacob Ommenhausser may have negotiated for such extras through the exchange of sketchbooks that illustrated the hard conditions in the camp, but that also are characterized by a strong sense of the comic and the absurd. Ommenhausser was imprisoned at Point Lookout for nearly a year. This is one of several sketchbooks and groups of drawings that he made for specific recipients, as each has a different name on the title page. This example has twenty-two drawings, including the title page.\n\nBerks County Farmscape\n\nJohn Rasmussen (1828–1895)\n\nBerks County, Pennsylvania\n\nc. 1879–1886\n\nOil on zinc-plated tin\n\n26 3/8 x 35 3/8 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2005.8.15\n\nThis pristine view of a prosperous Berks County farmstead presents an idyllic scene of verdant fields receding into the distance in a patchwork of color. A locomotive chugs across the foreground promising continued progress. The sense of stability communicated through this crisp rendering is far removed from the difficult circumstances of the artist who painted it. John Rasmussen arrived in New York from Germany in 1865, and is listed as a painter and “fresco painter” in the Reading, Pennsylvania, business directories from 1867 through 1879. By June of 1879, widowed and suffering from chronic drinking problems, he was committed to the Berks County Almshouse. Here he met fellow inmate and painter, Charles Hofmann, whose portraits of the almshouse and its environs inspired the younger artist to create landscapes that were similar in composition. Rasmussen painted at least six views of the almshouse on the thin sheets of metal available through the institution’s wagon and machine shops, as well as a wider range of subject matter.\n\nLearning the ABCs\n\nAttributed to Mary B. Tucker (dates unknown)\n\nProbably Massachusetts\n\nc. 1840–1844\n\nWatercolor and pencil on paper\n\n19 1/4 x 23 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2013.1.15\n\nPhoto © 2000 John Bigelow Taylor, New York\n\nAs very young children, boys and girls received similar educations. During the eighteenth century, this was often begun at home or in a “dame” school (similar to a nursery school). By the time this watercolor was painted, though, toward the middle of the nineteenth century, even very young children were sent to the local district school. Instruction consisted mainly of learning the abcs and other simple lessons through hornbooks or primers. The props in this watercolor are indications of the children’s respective ages. The younger child is a mere baby, as evidenced by the straw rattle she holds. The older child holds a primer with the alphabet and simple illustrated words. Although the gender of the children appears indeterminate, the older child is probably a boy, as he is wearing a suit with buttons and wears his hair with a side part; rattles usually appear in portraits of girls.\n\nBook of Arithmetic Problems of Johannes Whisler\n\nArtist unidentified, probably Johannes Whisler (?–1874)\n\nMifflin Township, Pennsylvania\n\n1814–1815\n\nWatercolor and ink on paper, with leather binding\n\n13 x 8 1/2 x 1 15/16 in. (closed)\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2005.8.44b\n\nPhoto © 2000 John Bigelow Taylor, New York\n\nPennsylvania German schools taught reading, writing, arithmetic, and elements of religious instruction, among other subjects. Schools also stressed advanced mathematical problems that would later help with the intricacies of accurate account keeping. Most notebooks were homemade or provided by the teacher. This page in Johannes Whisler’s book contains mathematical problems of compounding fractions. He later penned fraktur-like drawings of mounted horsemen, trumpeting angels, tulips, birds, eagles, and various animals in the same volume. Included in this book is an account of Whisler’s courtship and marriage to Esther Scherrer, on December 5, 1815. He entered part of his narrative in a simple code that, when deciphered, records the day and hour he met his future wife.\n\nRebecca Carter Sampler\n\nRebecca Carter (1778–1837)\n\nProvidence\n\n1788\n\nSilk, metallic thread, and human hair on linen\n\n19 1/4 x 13 1/2 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2013.1.47\n\nPhoto courtesy Sotheby’s, New York\n\nRebecca Carter’s sampler provides everything any collector could seek in an eighteenth-century American sampler. Its flawless silk stitchery is exquisitely lustrous, it portrays the historically important 1762 State House in Providence, and it contains the commendable maxim “Honor and renown shall the ingenious crown.” Its six elegant and lively figures have golden blond human hair, and its maker signed it with her name and initials and dated it 1788. The back proves to be equally exceptional. There Rebecca’s adult notations reveal that it was begun by her sister Ann at the long-forgotten school of Abigail Wilkinson in Newport and completed by Rebecca at Miss Mary Balch’s school in Providence—leading to the rediscovery of Mrs. Wilkinson’s career—and that its ideally appropriate frame was provided by Providence cabinetmaker John Carlile, thus making it the only eighteenth-century Rhode Island sampler frame of known provenance.\n\nThis sampler also testifies to the superb talents of Mary Balch (1762–1831), an irreproachable schoolmistress whose forty-five years of teaching produced what is probably the largest quantity of recognizable needlework known to survive from an early New England school. The epitaph on her gravestone in North Burial Ground in Providence aptly described her as “The first who established a FEMALE ACADEMY in this Town, which by her industry and amiable qualifications attained a high reputation. She was a sincere and tender Friend and her love to God and goodwill to men were conspicuous traits of her character.”\n\nRebecca Carter was born on August 22, 1778, the sixth among twelve children. Her father, John Carter (1745–1814), was born in Philadelphia, and in 1767, after an apprenticeship with Benjamin Franklin, he moved to Providence, where he married Amy Crawford (1744–1806) in 1769. He soon became a prominent bookseller, town postmaster, and publisher of the Providence Gazette. Rebecca married Amos Throop Jenckes (1778–1809) in 1801. Their fifth child was an infant when he died in Havana, and only two of their children reached adulthood. Rebecca died on June 20, 1837.\n\nWorktable\n\nArtist unidentified\n\nNew Hampshire, possibly West Nottingham\n\nc. 1819\n\nWatercolor, pencil, and ink on bird’s-eye maple\n\n29 1/8 x 18 5/8 x 17 7/8 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2005.8.50\n\nOrnamental arts played an important role in signaling a young woman’s status in the social network around her. Such arts instruction cost extra and was offered in addition to the customary academic subjects deemed necessary to prepare a young woman for her future domestic role. This instruction might culminate in a fine pictorial silk needlework and a small piece of furniture, often a sewing table, which would be displayed in the parlor after it had been embellished with tasteful designs. The decoration was usually traced or copied in pencil from another source, outlined in ink, and filled in with transparent colors. This worktable combines typical floral motifs with pastoral landscapes. On the top, however, is a handsome depiction of the state house in Concord, New Hampshire, in its completed state after 1819. Symbols of patriotism and statehood contributed to a national ideal in the decades following the establishment of the new American republic. State houses, capitol buildings, city halls, and courthouses played a symbolic role in the public consciousness.\n\nSurprise Quilt Presented to Mary A. Grow\n\nVarious quiltmakers\n\nPlymouth, Michigan\n\n1856\n\nCotton with inked and embroidered signatures\n\n87 x 82 1/2 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift in memory of Margaret Trautwein Stoddard and her daughter, Eleanor Stoddard Seibold, 2003.2.1\n\nPhoto by Gavin Ashworth\n\nDuring the nineteenth century, occasions for members of a community to come together were as varied as the nature of their living circumstances, and were different still for men and for women. Relationships within the social network in cities, where the population was dense and transient, was not the same as that in established rural communities in New England, or widely scattered homesteads in the West and plantations in the South. This type of quilt represents a gesture of friendship from many members of a community to one of its own, and was often made upon the occasion of an engagement or marriage, or as a gift when a beloved member of a community moved away. Quilting afforded a traditional opportunity for women to gather in a communal act: This was enhanced when the quilt was a participatory project intended for presentation to a friend or neighbor.\n\nIt is not known why this particular quilt was made. Each block bears the name of a friend who contributed to this “surprise” for Mary A. Grow, as the quilt is inscribed in ink on the back. Mary Ann Hackett (1817–1896) was born in England and moved with her family to New York State, where she married William B. Grow, a minister. They moved to Plymouth, Michigan, after 1839.\n\nHoop Skirt\n\nArtist unidentified\n\nGobles, Michigan\n\n1880–1900\n\nTin\n\n27 1/2 x 29 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Martin and Enid Packard, 1988.25.19\n\nLife’s milestones present momentous occasions for friends to gather: in celebration of marriage and birth, in sorrow as friends pass into death. One such occasion has traditionally been the commemoration of wedding anniversaries. The European custom of recognizing anniversaries with gifts of increasing value took a whimsical turn in Victorian America when popular periodicals urged a “general frolic . . . for getting together old friends after ten years of married life . . .” to mark the tin anniversary. Gifts presented to the couple were often replicas of everyday items, such as this hoop skirt. Professional tinsmiths offered a host of readymade articles that could be purchased for such parties, and also made custom items to order. This is one of more than twenty tin items discovered in Gobles, Michigan, that were probably from a single tenth-anniversary celebration.\n\nLife in the Twenties\n\nAntonio Esteves (1910–1983)\n\nBrooklyn, New York\n\n1973\n\nOil on Masonite\n\n19 7/8 x 23 3/4 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of the artist, 1981.9.1\n\nAntonio Esteves, like many artists, trained and untrained, looked back to his early life experiences for subject matter and inspiration. Esteves painted this interior scene when he was in his 60s, living in Brooklyn (across the street from the Brooklyn Museum of Art), and just beginning what would be a ten-year (1973–1983) career in painting. Here, Esteves remembered an scene from his childhood apartment; he is most likely the young boy with a book sitting at the dining table. Three adults are cooking, cleaning, and relaxing. The pace and appliances of pre–World War II life are highlighted in this composition. Esteves aptly shows the sanctuary that apartments had become for city dwellers.\n\nEsteves received artistic recognition in 1976, when he participated in an annual art show at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. Twentieth-century folk art was generating a lot of interest in the New York City art world at the time, thanks in part to a devoted group of collectors who lived in the city and were involved in the fledgling, then fifteen-year-old American Folk Art Museum. Esteves benefited from this cultural moment, as did some of his peers, including Vestie Davis and Morris Hirshfeld.\n\nFriendship Chain for Sally Avery\n\nArtist unidentified\n\nWest Taghkanic, New York\n\nc. 1828\n\nGlass beads and thread\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum purchase, 2002.16.1\n\nPhoto by Gavin Ashworth\n\nToday, as in the past, friendship has encouraged the exchange of testaments of affection. During the 1820s, it was popular to inscribe such expressions into albums whose pages received sentiments and drawings dedicated by one friend to another. This fashionable trend inspired a series of explicit tokens of friendship through the nineteenth century, including narrow necklaces made as gifts that were woven on a loom with tiny glass beads. Many of these friendship chains (or neck ribbons, as they were sometimes called) are dated between 1832 and 1836, and often bear the name of the recipient. It was also typical for friendship chains to display motifs symbolic of friendship, religion, remembrance, domesticity, and other meanings. Beadwork friendship chains were draped around the neck and were long enough to tuck into a waistband, sometimes with a watch appended to a ribbon at one end. This friendship chain is not dated, but bears the maiden name of Sally Avery (1805–1884), who married Monmouth Buckbee in 1828.\n\nOpen Cupboard or Dresser\n\nArtist unidentified\n\nProbably Lancaster, Pennsylvania\n\nc. 1750–1780\n\nPaint on pine and poplar, with iron hardware\n\n85 x 60 7/8 x 20 1/4 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2005.8.26\n\nPhoto © 2000 John Bigelow Taylor, New York\n\nGermanic groups that settled in Pennsylvania beginning in the late seventeenth century maintained a strong cultural identity while participating in and contributing to each area in which they established communities. Large open cupboards were important and traditional furniture forms presented to a young woman or a newly married couple starting their own home. This type of open dresser, known as aSchüssel Schranck, was usually divided into two components: an upper compartment with sturdy shelves for the display of pewter or pottery and a lower compartment with doors for closed storage. Such cupboards represented a significant contribution to the household furnishings, and the expense varied depending upon the woods used and the decorative details included in their design. A number of examples similar to this were produced and used in the Lancaster County area.\n\nPottery was one of the strongest decorative arts traditions maintained within Pennsylvania German communities. Potteries usually served a local market and were often operated by a single master potter, with assistance from apprentices or family members. Continuity in style and technique was strengthened by interrelationships among early potters through progeny and marriage. Wheel-thrown forms were the most common, but simple slab-built and molded plates and hollowware were also made. Experienced potters might also produce whimsical animal forms that were made as decorative items and often presented as gifts.\n\nUtilitarian and decorative goods were embellished using a variety of techniques. Slip decoration was achieved either by brushing slip (liqueﬁed clay) over the entire surface of a form, or by trailing the slip in thin lines through a small glazed cup with one or more quill spouts. After the surface was coated with slip and allowed to dry, designs were sometimes scratched through to reveal the natural clay of the form underneath, in a technique known as sgrafﬁto. Further color could be added by mixing the slip with metal oxides to produce greens, blacks, browns, and blues. Finally, the form usually received a coat of clear glaze.\n\nSpiral Religious Text\n\nJohann Adam Eyer (1755–1837)\n\nProbably Bedminster Township, Bucks County, Pennsylvania\n\nc. 1780–1785\n\nWatercolor and ink on paper\n\n8 5/8 x 6 7/8 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2005.8.36\n\nPhoto © 2000 John Bigelow Taylor, New York\n\nA strong tradition of embellished and calligraphic forms was transmitted to Pennsylvania and other areas through Germanic immigration to America. Executed from the early eighteenth century through the middle of the nineteenth, fraktur was made primarily by schoolteachers and ministers for their local constituencies. Johann Adam Eyer, whose work influenced succeeding generations, was one of the most prolific fraktur artists. Although a Lutheran himself, he served as a schoolmaster in several Mennonite schools and in many Pennsylvania counties. In these schools he continued a tradition established by early schoolmaster Christopher Dock (?–1771) of rewarding students with small gifts of fraktur. In addition to the primary forms of fraktur such as Taufscheine (birth records), Eyer originated decorated Notenbüchleine (tune booklets), and made rewards of merit, bookplates, and writing samples for students. Early in his career he also made a few spiral religious texts, such as this example, also probably intended as a reward for a pupil.\n\nSlipware Charger with Combed Decoration\n\nArtist unidentified\n\nSoutheastern Pennsylvania\n\nc. 1800–1840\n\nGlazed red earthenware\n\n2 7/8 x 15 1/2 in. diam.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2013.1.25\n\nPhoto © 2000 John Bigelow Taylor, New York\n\nSlip decoration, in which liquefied colored clays or mineral oxides are painted, dripped, or “trailed” on the surface of a form prior to firing, was a common traditional method of embellishing utilitarian and ornamental earthenwares. Popular in Europe, the decorating technique was brought by immigrant craftsmen to most centers of pottery production in early America. This potter’s slip trailing cup, the miniature plate, or “cup” plate, and the charger illustrate aspects of this popular decorative technique as it was employed by numerous folk potters in Pennsylvania.\n\nWhile simple in concept, slip decoration required deep knowledge of the different properties of clays and how the various metal oxides and minerals used as colorants reacted with clay and glaze formulas during the firing. If the properties of a slip recipe were incompatible with the clay body, or if the slip did not fuse well with the glaze, it could flake off or excessively melt and flow during the firing, ruining the finished work.\n\nA potter usually made his own slip trailing cups, basing the shape, volume, and number of spout openings on personal preference. It was important that the interior of the cup be glazed so that it could be reused—if left unglazed, its porous interior would absorb and retain traces of the color oxides, contaminating later contents. The holes were fitted with hollow quill or reed spouts, which were sealed in place with wax or wet clay. The spouts helped to promote the even flow of the slip, but rarely were slip cups made with more than four spout openings, as the flow was difficult to manipulate. A potter also had to be mindful of the consistency of the slip in the cup and to apply the designs carefully and quickly before the mixture thickened and clogged the spouts.\n\nThe yellow slip design on the miniature plate was produced with a three-spouted cup much like the example illustrated. The potter moved the cup in such a way while pouring the slip to produce the wavering parallel lines of the design. The slip patterns present on the charger required multiple passes of a three- or four-spouted cup, drawn carefully across the form to maintain equal spacing of the trailed lines. Once the lines of slip were applied, a wet quill, stick, or toothed wood comb was pulled through while they were still wet, creating the combed waver of the design. Combing, often found in early English earthenware traditions, could be used with multiple slip colors, producing the swirled “agateware” decoration popular in Pennsylvania and elsewhere.\n\nSea Horse Jagging Wheel\n\nArtist unidentified\n\nNew England\n\nc. 1870\n\nWhale ivory and ebony with silver pins\n\n2 3/4 x 6 x 1/12 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2013.1.53\n\nPhoto © 2000 John Bigelow Taylor, New York\n\nThe jagging wheel—or pie crimper—is a common kitchen device with a crenellated wheel used to trim piecrusts. The opposite end sometimes features tines to perforate the crust and allow steam to escape. Its association with the delicious aromas of freshly baked pies and the warmth of the kitchen evokes a tangible longing for a loving home and decent food. The sea horse imagery is unusual for this utensil, although it is encountered in other forms of maritime art.\n\nBethesda Fountain\n\nVestie Davis (1903–1978)\n\nNew York City\n\n1964\n\nOil on canvas\n\n18 x 24 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Gloria Bley Miller, 2002.28.2\n\nPhoto by Gavin Ashworth\n\nContemporary folk art and self-taught art are frequently thought to be strictly rural phenomena. But a contemporary urban environment is just as likely to cultivate creative aspirations as a rural one; perhaps even more so, considering the preponderance of cultural stimulation available in any American city. Take Vestie Davis, for example. Davis started his life as an artist, when in his words, “One day in 1947 I was walking on 57th Street and came to a big gallery. I looked in, saw some pictures I liked, said to myself, ‘I can paint like that.’ So I walked into an artist’s material store.…” Not only was the creative impulse nurtured in urban New York, but the creative context also provided the subject matter for Davis, who captured the New York community at work and at play. His compositions of Coney Island, Wall Street, and Times Square charmingly illustrate life in the city. Working with oil on canvas and quickly establishing a flat, colorful style, Davis documented the crowded, congested landscape of twentieth-century urban America. The subject of this 1964 painting of Bethesda Fountain, a Central Park landmark and popular meeting place for New Yorkers, though made more than forty years ago, looks much the same today because Davis gives in to generic fashion statements and adopts a sameness with his figures. This creates a timelessness to his canvases. The lack of a multicultural crowd, however, is a glaring omission to most millennial viewers.\n\nDavis was a savvy businessman who successfully sold his paintings to many collectors. Explaining the crowded quality of his compositions, he once said, “I paint what people want, and they want what’s familiar to them. I painted Nathan’s hot dog stand with three hundred people, all of them eating or drinking. The more people I put in, the faster they sold.”\n\nNelson Mandela\n\nArliss Watford (1924–1998)\n\nAhoskie, North Carolina\n\nc. 1980s\n\nPaint on wood\n\n27 x 6 x 3 3/4 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, Blanchard-Hill Collection, gift of M. Anne Hill and Edward V. Blanchard Jr., 1998.10.62\n\nPhoto by Gavin Ashworth\n\nAn African American carving a likeness of Nelson Mandela, a world leader who embodies the fight for justice, vividly illustrates the twentieth-century global community. Mandela, the first democratically elected president of South Africa and one of the heroic figures of the twentieth century, was imprisoned in his homeland at the time that Arliss Watford carved his portrait. Apartheid was not yet abolished in South Africa and Mandela was a prisoner on Robbins Island, but nonetheless Watford shows the freedom fighter as strong, formidable, and proud, even presidential. It is almost as if the artist forecasts for us Mandela’s future leadership role in world politics.\n\nWatford worked as a bricklayer and dry dock worker in Virginia before opening a used furniture and television repair shop in eastern North Carolina after World War II. He had whittled in wood throughout his life, but in the 1980s he started to explore figurative carving on a larger scale. Working mostly with red cedar but also on occasion cypress knee wood, the artist created simple, compact, figurative sculpture. He said, “I just always had to be carving something, not to sell to anybody but just to carve.” Watford often chose to create images of famous world figures as often as he represented his neighbors and people from his community. Locals recall that visits to Watford’s workshop were like a field trip to a local museum of black history because every surface displayed carvings depicting twentieth-century black life in the United States and beyond.\n\nCountry Band of Five\n\nShields Landon Jones (1901–1997)\n\nHinton, West Virginia\n\nc. early 1970s\n\nPaint on wood with pencil\n\n5 in. high each\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, Blanchard-Hill Collection, gift of M. Anne Hill and Edward V. Blanchard Jr., 1998.10.69a–e\n\nPhoto by Gavin Ashworth\n\nMany rural communities maintain the tradition of whittling, which is how Shields Landon Jones started carving. He readily took to the hobby and in a short time excelled in his craft, expanding his abilities to render a figure, increase his scale, and incorporate pencil, stain, and paint.\n\nJones was inspired by his life experiences; in his West Virginia community, he was known as an accomplished fiddler, and musicians are one of his frequent subjects. This “country band” includes five musicians (the fiddler may be a self-portrait); the small scale of the figures indicates that it may be an early work by the artist. Each figure throws a strong and effective emotional punch, and the varied postures and facial expressions help individualize members of the band. The unpainted male figure, leaning forward and looking up, appears to be caught up in the music-making and transfixed by the sounds.\n\nGift Drawing: A Reward of True Faithfulness from Mother Lucy to Eleanor Potter\n\nPolly Ann (Jane) Reed (1818–1881)\n\nNew Lebanon, New York\n\n1848\n\nWatercolor and ink on paper\n\n11 3/8 x 10 1/2 in. (sight)\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2013.1.52\n\nBeginning in 1837, an intense religious revival swept through the Shaker villages. Over a period of twenty or more years known as the Era of Manifestations, or Mother’s Work, Believers accepted visionary experiences as a part of daily life. These phenomena “received by inspiration” were recognized as “gifts” by the Shaker leadership, and included messages, songs, and drawings. A little more than two hundred gift drawings survive, all but a few the work of women at the villages in New Lebanon, New York, and Hancock, Massachusetts. Polly Reed, the meticulous scribe who recorded this gift, also transcribed visions into heart- and leaf-shaped cutouts, a spiritual map, and other works in watercolor. Mother Lucy was Lucy Wright (1760–1821), a principal leader of the United Society of Believers during its formative years. The drawing also contains a visionary message believed to have been received from Mother Ann Lee (1736–1784), the founder of the Society.\n\nShaker Case of Drawers and Cupboard\n\nArtist unidentified\n\nNew Lebanon, New York\n\nc. 1840\n\nWood\n\n80 x 48 x 21 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of James and Katherine Goodman, 2001.36.1\n\nPhoto by Gavin Ashworth\n\nSoon after the founding of their first communities in New York and New England in the late eighteenth century, a distinctive tradition in the arts and crafts developed among the Shakers. Notable for its reduction of vernacular forms, Shaker design places emphasis on simplicity, harmony and function. These ideas find visual expression in the furniture that was produced in the Shaker communities; it is simple but elegant, without decorative or ornamental painting, carving, or turnings, but exacting in craftsmanship and purity of line.\n\nShakers resided in self-contained villages, generally consisting of several “families” of as many as one hundred or more members each. Built to serve the needs of this communal lifestyle, Shaker furniture is often imposing in scale. Tall case pieces combining drawers and cupboard—like this handsome example—were often produced in the mid-nineteenth century at New Lebanon, New York, the seat of the religious community’s central ministry and the most influential of the Shaker villages. The “mushroom” pulls on the drawers are typical of Shaker design, as are the simple, cut feet.\n\nAnimals Appear As Plants—Dwellers of the Sea\n\nEugene Von Bruenchenhein (1910–1983)\n\nMilwaukee\n\n1956\n\nPaint on corrugated cardboard\n\n21 x 24 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, Blanchard-Hill Collection, gift of M. Anne Hill and Edward V. Blanchard Jr., 1998.10.58\n\nPhoto by Gavin Ashworth\n\nThe son of a sign painter and the stepson of a Sunday painter who believed in reincarnation and evolution, Eugene Von Bruenchenhein was exposed to creative trades and nonconformist ideas from an early age. Before devoting the second half of his life to making art, Von Bruenchenhein worked as a florist and a baker. It was a fortunate foundation for the future artist, who eventually found his voice in a wide range of expressions: photography, painting, ceramics, sculpture, and poetry.\n\nA visionary in every sense of the word, Von Bruenchenhein illustrated his fears of modern war technology and his fascination with other worlds in fantastic, wet-on-wet apocalyptic paintings. He started working on his series of abstract canvases in the mid-1950s, and his subjects are often associated with the threat of nuclear explosions, as well as underwater creatures, perhaps in Von Bruenchenhein’s mind the inhabitants of a post-nuclear-war world. His fantastic imagery is enhanced by his out-of-this-world techniques: Von Bruenchenhein felt free to employ sticks, leaves, crumbled paper, his fingers, and brushes made from his wife’s hair as styluses to apply the paint. He used a jarring combination of colors (secondary colors like green and orange) to great effect, enhancing an otherworldly feeling.\n\nLow Blanket Chest\n\nArtist unidentified\n\nNew England\n\nc. 1830\n\nPaint on wood\n\n22 x 41 1/4 x 18 1/2 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of the Lipman Family Foundation in honor of Jean and Howard Lipman, 1999.8.7\n\nPhoto by Gavin Ashworth\n\nA high degree of individuation can be achieved even when an artisan is working within a prescribed convention. A simple utilitarian form such as this six-board low chest is transformed by the dynamic use of autumnal colors and fanlike patterns to create surfaces that fairly vibrate with energy. The effect is imaginative, rather than that of an attempt to realistically simulate natural wood graining. As such, this abstract surface treatment may be a rural expression of the aesthetic philosophy of Fancy—or imagination—that was popular in the decorative arts of the period. Fantastic and colorful patterns were created through the application of pigment dissolved in water, turpentine, or vinegar, which was then manipulated while wet using a variety of tools or textured materials such as brushes, combs, leather, or putty. In this example, the artist’s hand is literally visible in the repeated pattern of overlapping fans. The technique is traditional, the result unique.\n\nMan Feeding a Bear an Ear of Corn\n\nArtist unidentified\n\nProbably Pennsylvania\n\nc. 1840\n\nWatercolor, ink, and pencil on paper\n\n5 5/8 x 7 1/2 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2013.1.37\n\nPhoto © 2000 John Bigelow Taylor, New York\n\nBears and humans have had an ambivalent relationship in North America. The earliest European explorers were not impressed by the American bears they encountered and considered them of little economic value. After the Revolutionary War, however, when there was a compelling need to tame the wilderness and establish communities, the bear took on a frightening aspect as a threat to settlement and a symbol of all that was unknown about the land. There are many possible interpretations of this puzzling but very appealing watercolor. The building, the man, and the chained bear may signify the successful civilization of the frontier. On the other hand, bears have often figured in folktales and other stories because there is something inherently humanlike about them. The man feeding the ear of corn to this bear, who appears small and helpless, may be a twist on an old folktale in which a bear feeds corn to pigs locked in a pen to fatten them up before eating them.\n\nYet another interpretation of the watercolor may lie in fact rather than fiction. It was not an uncommon practice during the first quarter of the nineteenth century for exotic animals to be put on display to draw customers. While bears could not be considered as exotic as elephants, lions, and camels, they were exhibited in Pennsylvania as attractions outside establishments such as public taverns. In his zoo and museum at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, Charles Willson Peale exhibited two large grizzlies that had been captured by Zebulon Pike. Whatever the actual meaning, the watercolor shares some traits with other Pennsylvania German arts—the tulip and the stars and crescent moon, which may derive from printed almanacs—although they are here expressed idiosyncratically.\n\nFolding Chair\n\nHosea Hayden (1820–1897)\n\nUnion County, Indiana\n\n1883–1896\n\nHorse chestnut with rattan seat\n\n30 x 14 x 20 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Abby and B.H. Friedman, 1996.23.1\n\nPhoto by Gavin Ashworth\n\n# Hosea Hayden was an Indiana farmer who used his ready wit, keen observations, and philosophical bent to punctuate the chairs that he crafted for family and friends. Although many of the chairs commemorate specific events, this undated example does not give any clue to Hayden’s incentive for making it. The incised decoration includes an image typical of penmanship exercises of the period, as well as illustrated puns and the sentiment “Mythology the rule, science the exception.” Hayden was descended from English ancestors who immigrated to Massachusetts, fought in the American Revolution, and migrated west to Ohio and Indiana by the early 1800s. His father, Stephen, was one of the original landowners of Union County.\n\nHayden’s first known chair was made in 1883 to celebrate his father’s one-hundredth birthday; his last was made in 1896, one year before he died. Of the more than a dozen chairs that have been identified, all are folding chairs of Hayden’s original construction and most are tripods. In this example, the chair collapses when the handle is pulled up, much like an artist’s folding easel. Besides their idiosyncratic shapes, the chairs are defined by the philosophical musings and pictures incised into the wood. Based on the inscriptions, Hayden was a freethinker and a rationalist who advocated women’s rights, railed against religious hypocrisy, and satirized popular trends such as women’s fashions.\n\nEspanola\n\nJon Serl (1894–1993)\n\nSan Juan Capistrano, California\n\n1965\n\nOil on board\n\n26 x 20 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, bequest of Gary W. Hager, 1991.31.1\n\nPhoto by Gavin Ashworth\n\nJon Serl’s first hasty attempts at painting were made about the time of World War II. By this point, Serl had already experienced a full life, working in vaudeville, film, and as a laborer in California and the American Southwest. A pacifist, he fled to Canada during both world wars to avoid military service. He was married three times, divorced just as many. Eventually Serl settled in several California towns, including Laguna Beach, San Juan Capistrano, and Lake Elsinore, and devoted his time to painting.\n\nExecuted in oil on found surfaces, Serl’s paintings are often brash, bold, and expressionistic. He explored a whole range of techniques with paint and brush; a true painter’s painter, the artist applied paint in a thick impasto as well as in light washes of color. A sensitive use of color, characteristic of Serl’s best artworks, only heightens the drama of his paintings, which abound with characters. The figures that people his paintings often express dualities: male and female, nature and technology, good and evil, parent and child. Often compared to theatrical stages, his canvases usually have an unknown narrative exploring both inner and outer worlds, the emotional as well as the physical.\n\nSallie Hathaway Needlework Picture\n\nSallie Hathaway (1782–1851)\n\nProbably Massachusetts or New York\n\nc. 1794\n\nSilk on silk\n\n17 x 20 1/4 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2013.1.45\n\nPhoto courtesy Sotheby’s, New York\n\nSallie Hathaway’s elegant embroidery on black silk must have brought delight to her parents, for she was their eighth child but the first to survive infancy. Nevertheless, this was an adventurous family. Sallie’s father, John Hathaway (1753–1818), was a mariner of Freetown, Massachusetts, who married Sarah Conkling of Long Island in 1774, but they were in the western Massachusetts town of Great Barrington before Sallie was 2 years old. In 1784, they were among the second group of settlers to arrive in the newly established town of Hudson, New York, where John Hathaway soon became the successful owner of a fleet of ships.\n\nNo records reveal where Sallie was educated during the formative years of this port city on the Hudson River. Quite possibly she attended a boarding school in New York City or studied at the recently opened school kept by Miss Betsy Bostwick (1771–1840) in Great Barrington. Bostwick was the oldest daughter of the highly esteemed minister Gideon Bostwick (1742–1793) and Gesie Burghart (1749–1789). Gideon, a Yale graduate of 1762, first settled in Great Barrington as the director of a classical school. In later years, he was ordained and served as minister of the Saint James parish as well as pastor of nearby congregations in New York. The duration of Miss Bostwick’s school is unknown, but she may have been responsible for the exceptional schoolgirl art produced in Great Barrington between 1807 and 1811.\n\nAt present, the best-known pictorial embroideries on black silk were worked at unknown schools of Salem, Massachusetts, from the 1740s through the 1770s, and in Boston during the 1750s and 1760s. Black silk was also the most popular ground material for Boston coats of arms during the second half of the eighteenth century. As yet, however, nothing even slightly akin to Sallie’s silk embroidery has been found, and its place of origin remains a mystery.\n\nSallie Hathaway married Seth Jenkins Jr. (1776–1831), whose father was among the original proprietors of the town of Hudson and its first mayor, and whose family members continued to be leading citizens for a century thereafter. The couple had nine children, and Sallie’s needlework descended in the family of their youngest son, Louis Henry Jenkins (1827–1883).\n\nMother and Child\n\nSteven Ashby (1904–1980)\n\nDelaplane, Virginia\n\nc. 1970\n\nPaint on wood with hair and cotton\n\n8 x 3 1/2 x 1 1/4 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Chuck and Jan Rosenak, 1977.21.6\n\nPhoto by Gavin Ashworth\n\nSteven Ashby once said about his artwork, “I wake up with an idea that won’t let me get back to sleep. So I get up and make that idea.” Ashby’s gutsy, sardonic, and often erotic sculptures challenge the notion that folk art must be an innocent expression of traditional values. In what he called his “fixing-ups,” crudely fashioned from cast-off materials, Ashby frequently addressed erotic themes with keen wit and sly humor. After his retirement and the death of his wife, Ashby created numerous assemblages from recycled materials—odd pieces of lumber, logs, branches, roots, broken children’s toys, discarded hardware, hickory nuts, fabric, and photos cut from men’s magazines. He even dressed some of his female figures in his late wife’s clothes and costume jewelry. Ashby displayed many of his nearly life-size figures and whirligigs in his yard; he kept his more outrageous tableaux inside his house, refusing to show them to female visitors.\n\nTaufschein for Johannes Dottere\n\nNorthampton County (or Bird-in-the-Hand) Artist\n\nProbably Chestnut Hill Township, Pennsylvania\n\nc. 1831\n\nWatercolor and ink on paper\n\n15 1/16 x 12 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2013.1.32\n\nThis birth certificates exemplifies the manner in which fraktur makers depicted human forms. Human figures naturally increased the appeal of any fraktur. A man and a woman depicted on a baptismal record probably represented the child’s sponsors. The special relationship between sponsors and godchild extended from a moral responsibility for the child’s welfare to the unwritten expectation that the sponsors would raise the child if the parents died, leave a bequest if they had no children of their own, and make gifts at key stages of life. The couple on the Taufschein for Johannes Dottere by the unidentified artist known as the Northhampton County (or Bird-in-the-Hand) Artist are rather relaxed and illustrate the saying “A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush”—or, as here, “in the woods”—a bit of common sense but hardly a religious admonition.\n\nWoman in Rose Dress\n\nArtist unidentified\n\nVermont\n\nc. 1805–1815\n\nOil on pine panel\n\n26 5/8 x 24 5/8 x 1/2 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Ralph Esmerian, 2005.8.2\n\nPhoto © 2000 John Bigelow Taylor, New York\n\nAlthough portraiture falls within a conventional genre of painting, this idiosyncratic rendering by an unidentified artist is singular in style. Defined by its flat linearity and haunted quality, the young woman’s presentation is compelling. Her eccentric bangs are separated into long strands that hang limply across her face in an exaggerated representation of a style that was popular at the turn of the nineteenth century. The positioning of her arms is also unusual, with one arm crossing at the waist to hold the other at the elbow. This may be an attempt at naturalism in the pose, and has the additional advantage of permitting the heavy ring on her index finger to be included in the portrait. Her beautiful rose-colored dress with black netted fringe on the sleeves is a rural adaptation of a contemporary Parisian fashion, but it too assumes a slightly off-kilter air with the unusual embellishment of somber black birds.\n\nUntitled\n\nLeonard Daley (c. 1930–2006)\n\nJamaica\n\nc. 1990s\n\nMixed media on board\n\n24 1/2 x 25 3/4 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Maurice C. and Patricia L. Thompson, 2003.20.11\n\nPhoto by Gavin Ashworth\n\nLeonard Daley, one of a number of self-taught artists in Jamaica, typically painted mixed-media works with no apparent narrative. Daley masterfully masked any narration with his swirling compositions, which reside solely in the foreground. This lack of obvious story line combined with the flat dimension of the painting creates a mysterious effect.\n\nCalled by critics a “trickster mystic,” Daley embodied the complexity of creativity and spirituality that can be found in Jamaica, where artistic expression tends to be more improvisational and free-form, allowing for highly personal works to flourish. Much of Daley’s art has a visionary quality to it, and this sense of a magic power and charged nature is also felt in the work of his island peers, such as Everald Brown.\n\nAssemblage of Crowd Scenes\n\nPurvis Young (1943–2010)\n\nMiami, Florida\n\nEarly 1990s\n\nPaint on found wood98 1/2 x 58 x 2 1/2 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of T. Marshall Hahn Jr., 1995.22.2\n\nPhoto by Gavin Ashworth\n\nA stint in prison as a young man opened up Purvis Young to the world of art. While serving time for armed robbery, he discovered his creative talent and studied the art mural tradition, particularly urban murals from the 1960s and 1970s, such as Chicago’s Wall of Respect. He also admired canonized masters—El Greco, Rembrandt, and van Gogh, among others. Young distills all these influences into his paintings, books, and assemblages. His first project in his neighborhood of Overtown—a desolate section of urban Miami—was an impromptu mural he painted on his block in the late 1960s; sadly, it no longer exists. He has since received several public art commissions, including one in the House of Blues restaurant in Orlando, Florida.\n\nKnowing that his first attempt at artmaking was an outdoor mural, it is not surprising that he continues to work on a large scale. Extremely prolific, Young has filled his vast home studio in a warehouse building with stacks of works, all covered with his trademark subjects—writhing crowds of people, arms upraised; powerful horses; tall, commanding pregnant women; armies of trucks and clusters of buildings.\n\nAssemblage of Crowd Scenes is a large piece that recalls Robert Rauschenberg’s Combine paintings. Many small elements make a whole, tied together by similarly colored, rough-hewn frames. Not presenting an overall narrative, the various images are turned at different angles, though the entire piece is weighted by the large green rectangular painting at the base, which anchors the otherwise quiet palette. The activity within the painting, however, stands in stark contrast to the muted colors. Seething figures gather with upraised arms, hips cocked, in a stance that is simultaneously celebratory and urgent. This contradiction creates an energy in each “snapshot” and unifies the whole. A few scenes include trucks and vehicles, and in one composition the all-seeing eye, a familiar Young motif, is apparent. According to the artist, this eye, when painted blue, represents oppression by the white man. Assemblage of Crowd Scenes presents a tremendous visual cacophony that underscores the often fast, loud, and cluttered life of its maker’s urban environs. Naturally, Young’s figures are drawn as mere gestures of form—the artist has little time to document the fast-moving action that unfolds daily in the city around him.\n\nSketch Book\n\nPurvis Young (1943–2010)\n\nMiami, Florida\n\n1978\n\nMixed media in scrapbook tied with yellow cord\n\n10 3/4 x 16 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, Blanchard-Hill Collection, gift of M. Anne Hill and Edward V. Blanchard Jr., 1998.10.68\n\nPhoto by Gavin Ashworth\n\nA short stint in prison opened up the world of art to Purvis Young. While serving time for armed robbery, he studied the art-mural tradition, particularly urban murals from the 1960s and 1970s, such as Chicago’s Wall of Respect. He also admired canonized masters, including Rembrandt, El Greco, and van Gogh. The artist distills all of these influences into his paintings, books, and assemblages.\n\nYoung’s sketchbooks are crowded, dense things. This scrapbook is weighted down by the addition of more pieces of paper glued to the original pages. Endless renderings of crowds, arms raised high in protest and/or celebration fill each page. Written statements such as “Purvis How Long It Going To Take” or “You Call This Justice” seem to suggest that this entire sketchbook is a protest piece. Oppression and inequality are admonished by Young, while civil rights are championed within the pages of his journal. The quick, confident lines, the brush of color wash, show that the artist works as rapidly in this form as he does when painting.\n\nBust of a Man\n\nMaestro Bustos (life dates unknown)\n\nCuenca, Ecuador\n\nc. 1985\n\nPaint on tin with collage\n\n10 1/4 x 4 3/4 x 2 1/2 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum purchase, 2007.4.41\n\nMaestro Bustos worked as a tinsmith most of his life, constructing clever toys well into his 80s. Modes of transportation, including trains, trucks, cars, boats, and buses, were pictured by this Ecuadorian artist, using tin, paint, and collage.\n\nTin toys—mostly made of recycled metal—are common objects found throughout South and Central America, but Maestro Bustos adds the surprising use of collage, reminding the viewer of artists such as Ray Johnson, Joseph Cornell, or Kurt Schwitters. Collage is employed by many self-taught artists, including Henry Darger, Martín Ramírez, and William Hawkins, each of whom employed clipped, saved, and snipped elements from paper ephemera to build and develop their narratives.\n\nMt. Demavend 18,934 ft near Mashhad Iran\n\nJoseph Yoakum (1890–1972)\n\nChicago\n\n1966\n\nWatercolor and ballpoint pen on paper\n\n12 x 17 15/16 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, Blanchard-Hill Collection, gift of M. Anne Hill and Edward V. Blanchard Jr., 1998.10.65\n\nPhoto by Gavin Ashworth\n\nMt. Damavand (or Demavend) is an active volcano near Tehran, Iran, unique in the region for its great height and classic volcanic shape. Mashhad, which means “place of martyrdom,” is east of Tehran and is a center of commerce in the region. Chicago artist Joseph Yoakum drew this image in 1966 and was possibly inspired by images he saw in the many books in his personal library: books on world geography, for example, as well as travel guides and an atlas.\n\nUsing watercolor, pastel, colored pencils, and chalk, Yoakum prolifically worked on small-size paper, producing a drawing every few days. He seems to have particularly enjoyed drawing mountainscapes, declaring his great wanderlust to the viewer. It was assumed that Yoakum imagined all these places even though he claimed to have traveled to all of the worldwide locales he depicted. Recent scholarship, however, takes into consideration the fact that the artist traveled extensively as a circus worker. Yoakum was an advance man for the circus, and some of his subjects were certainly painted from memory, rather than imagined vistas. The artist’s nomadic life prompted his admiration of voluptuous landscapes, which later invited his organic, painted interpretations of nature. His stylized lines border on abstraction, frequently implying faces in the mountainscapes.\n\nMexico City Full of Bargains\n\nWilliam Hawkins (1895–1990)Columbus, Ohio\n\nc. 1983\n\nEnamel housepaint on paneling\n\n52 1/2 x 50 1/2 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Carl D. Lobell and Kate Stettner, 2004.2.1\n\nPhoto by Charles Bechtold\n\nGrand scale is one distinctive quality of paintings by William Hawkins; a bold, aggressive palette is another. The formal combination of the two gives a punch to Hawkins’s artworks. Like many self-taught artists, he used readily available material like salvaged wood for a support and house-paint for media, and like many he scavenged images from popular media. Even though these are common characteristics among contemporary self-taught artists, however, each artist arrives to quite a singular aesthetic through creative exploration. An African American man who learned to draw by copying from popular media sources, such as magazine illustrations, horse-auction announcements, and illustrated calendars, Hawkins started painting full time in 1983, when he was in his eighties.\n\nHawkins’s painterly compositions are some of the most audacious of his peers. He likes them big, bold, strong, and powerful. He packages the works as art by building frames for them (his early work, like this example, have frames comprised of scrap pieces of wood molding painted by the artist and nailed directly on to his painted panels), and by signing and dating his work. In all likelihood, Hawkins was inspired by a popular media source (a travel magazine, perhaps?) to capture this image of a “bargain city.” William Hawkins’s optimism and bold artistic vision infused his art with an immediacy and a rare communicative strength\n\nGold Tower\n\nEugene Von Bruenchenhein (1910–1983)\n\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin\n\n1970s\n\nPaint on chicken bones and turkey bones\n\n47 x 6 x 7 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Lewis B. Greenblatt, 1999.22.1\n\nEugene Von Bruenchenhein and his wife, Marie, were rarely financially secure, often living on the economic edge in Wisconsin. They frequently ate at fast-food restaurants and saved the remains, chicken bones, for Von Bruenchenhein’s creative inspirations. The artist built towers, spires, and chairs out of the bones, gluing them together into impossible structures and painting them in gilded palettes, further strengthening them. Unfathomable and beautiful, they are some of the most singular works in twentieth-century American sculpture.\n\nVon Bruenchenhein’s world was not fully understood nor appreciated until after his death, but the artist did not choose to remain unknown—he tried, unsuccessfully, to attract the attention of clients, galleries, and museums. He certainly valued his artwork and held himself in high esteem: In a hand-tinted photographic self-portrait, the shirt he wears bears the bold declaration, “Time Produced None Better.”\n\nPrehistoric Lizard\n\nQ.J. Stephenson (1920–1997)\n\nGarysburg, North Carolina\n\nc. 1980s\n\nWood with sawdust, paint, and mixed media\n\n4 1/2 x 27 1/2 x 15 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, Blanchard-Hill Collection, gift of M. Anne Hill and Edward V. Blanchard Jr., 1998.10.50\n\nQ.J. Stephenson, a naturalist, explorer, and trapper in rural North Carolina, built the Trapper’s Lodge Museum, a roadside attraction, in the 1950s in response to his belief that local youth were not learning traditional hunting and trapping techniques. Disappointed in the widespread turning away from nature that took place in America following World War II, he embellished his vernacular museum with concrete creatures and personal slogans. He encrusted the interior and exterior of the structure with rocks, stones, shells, fossils, petrified wood, and other miscellany to create a most singular and startling building.\n\nInspired by the success of his museum, he continued to embellish the property in the 1980s with free-standing sculptures made from building material, largely imaginary creatures that resemble extinct prehistoric species. The idiosyncratic use of sawdust in this lizard aptly replicates scaly skin and just as perfectly illustrates a resourceful response to material.\n\nWaterfalls\n\nMiecieslaw Bogun (1917–1995)\n\nNew York City\n\n1971\n\nOil on canvas with carpet\n\n30 x 37 x 2 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Herbert Waide Hemphill Jr., 1990.1.6\n\nPhoto by Gavin Ashworth\n\nMaceptaw Bogun lived in the Bronx and worked for the New York City Metropolitan Transit Authority until he retired in 1983. Bogun was ordained as a minister in the now-closed Temple of Light church in 1951 and, years later, in St. Andrew’s Spiritual Church (also no longer in existence). The artist started to paint in the late 1960s when, in his words, he “decided to try oil painting, but only when the green light was given me by the Almighty.” Referring to his work as spiritual art, he painted approximately fifteen canvases between roughly the late 1960s and the late 1980s. Waterfalls, a 1971 composition, signed “Rev. Mac” below the symbol for infinity, has a hint of religiosity with the landscape crowned by a pastel rainbow; as a spiritualist, Bogun can be assumed to have a divine reverence for nature in general.\n\nThe most distinctive character of this oil painting is its texture and dimension. Using carpet to bring a third dimension to a two-dimensional art form, Bogun brought even more topographical quality to his work by adding multiple layers of paint. The artist was attempting to re-create the texture of running water with this unusual and idiosyncratic technique. This painstaking application successfully captures light on the canvas and suggests a foreground and middle ground, making for a startling new look at a conventional art form, landscape painting.\n\nMonkey\n\nArtist unidentified\n\nUnited States or Canada\n\nLate 19th–early 20th century\n\nPaint on wood with metal, glass, and tape\n\n21 1/2 x 12 1/2 x 14 3/4 in.\n\nAmerican Folk Art Museum, gift of Dorothea and Leo Rabkin, 1988.20.3\n\nPhoto by John Parnell\n\nThis rather threatening monkey is one of several carvings of figures and animals made by an unidentified artist around the turn of the twentieth century.
