        "text": "MAKE YOUR MARK\n\nA product with the Keson name is among the best of its kind. In 1968 Roy Nosek started Keson Industries, Inc. in Berwyn, Illinois. Operating out of a small office with inventory stored in an adjacent trailer, Keson became a vital resource to professional tradespeople and contractors. The business plan was simple: Outstanding service is just as important as outstanding products.\n\nFifty years later, we are still family owned, and that idea is still our guiding principle. We’ve grown because our service meets the same exacting standards as our products.\n\nKeson LLC is an alliance of two industry leaders.\n\nIn 2018, the Nosek and Scheyer families joined together to form a new company – Keson LLC. Keson and SOLA are both family-owned, third generation companies currently led by the grandsons of the company founders. Both companies are leaders in measuring and marking tools, offer complementary product lines, and share very similar values. With a combined 120 years of market experience, Keson LLC builds upon Keson’s U.S. manufacturing, existing distribution network and strong relationships by adding SOLA’s European manufacturing expertise, precision engineering and industry-leading technology.\n\nKeson is headquartered in Aurora, Illinois, and is well known in North America for providing reliable, innovative, and easy-to-use measuring and marking products to professional tradespeople who are passionate about their work."
