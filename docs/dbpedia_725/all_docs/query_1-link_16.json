        "text": "The upper floors of the American Express Building at 72-74-76-78 Monroe Street [o.s.] (23 to 33 West Monroe Street [n.s.]) were a Masonic temple complex of several halls and allied rooms, one or two of which were home to La Fayette Chapter No. 2, and Wiley M. Egan Chapter No. 126.\n\nDesigned by Henry Hobson Richardson for the American Express Company (f/k/a American Merchants’ Union Express Company), the building was constructed in 1872 in the aftermath of the Great Fire of 1871.\n\nEach of the four halls boasted lavish ornamentation, murals, detailed moldings, and powerful pipe organs. One of the halls featured what may have been the first horse-shoe balcony in a Freemason hall in the United States.\n\nDespite being equipped with a 4,000-gallon reservoir in its attic, and a basement steam pump capable of propelling water fifty feet above the roof, building was gutted by fire on 17 June 1930.\n\nPlease click here for more details and cited references.\n\nLa Fayette Chapter’s monthly convocations are now held on the fourth Tuesday evening of each month at Jefferson Park Masonic Temple.\n\nClick here to visit the chapter’s website.\n\nThe photograph on the left depicts the exterior of the American Express Building dressed for the 1910 Triennial Conclave of the\n\nGrand Encampment of Knights Templar of the U.S.A. See the reflection of the Majestic Building’s distinctive terra cotta lower walls in the American Express Building’s windows.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Apollo Commandery No. 1, Knights Templar.\n\nClick here to see ninety more photographs of Chicago hosting the 1910 Triennial Conclave.\n\nThe cornerstone of the Central Masonic Temple formerly located at 912 North LaSalle Drive was laid 14 October 1909 by the Grand Master of Illinois, Most Worshipful Brother A. B. Ashley, following a grand parade to the site.\n\nThe temple was home to Corinthian Chapter No. 2, Wiley M. Eagan Chapter No. 126, Lincoln Park Chapter No. 177, and Saint Cecilia Chapter No. 220.\n\nSee Evert E. Lawson (ed.), 1968-1969 Masonic Directory: A Listing of Masonic Lodges and Appendant Bodies in Illinois, Glenwood, Illinois: Temple Publishers (1968).\n\nWiley M. Eagan Chapter merged into Corinthian Chapter who reassumed their former name, La Fayette Chapter No. 2. They currently meet on the fourth Tuesday evening of each month at Jefferson Park Masonic Temple.\n\nClick here to visit the chapter’s website\n\nSt. Cecilia Chapter merged into Lincoln Park Chapter, who now meet at Mont Clare Masonic Temple.\n\nThe second photograph shows the cornerstone ready for its laying on 14 October 1909.\n\nClick here for more photographs of the laying ceremony and the procession thereto.\n\nThe third photograph was taken during construction in early 1910.\n\nThe upper floors of the Chicago Masonic Temple at 47-59 State Street [o.s.] (151 to 167 North State Street [n.s.]) were a Masonic temple complex of several halls and allied rooms, one of which was home to Washington Chapter No. 43.\n\nThe twenty-two story building, designed by John Wellborn Root of Burnham and Root, was constructed in 1892. Below the Masonic floors were offices. The lower nine floors featured shops surrounding an open court. The lodge halls served also as theaters, but the building’s elevators, barely sufficient for daily commercial activity, were woefully inadequate for the theater crowds. The building, with its lackluster utility services and elevators, struggled to retain commercial tenants. The building’s death knell was the construction of the State Street subway (now part of the Red Line), which would have necessitated prohibitively expensive upgrades to the structure’s foundation. Consequently, the temple was razed in 1939.\n\nPlease click here to see Washington Chapter’s insurance policy for their furnishings at this temple, dated 7 January 1903.\n\nThe photograph on the left depicts the exteriors of the Chicago Masonic Temple and its neighbor to the south, Marshall Field & Company, dressed for the 1910 Triennial Conclave of the Grand Encampment of Knights Templar of the U.S.A.\n\nClick here to see ninety more photographs of Chicago hosting the 1910 Triennial Conclave.\n\nThe former Paul Revere Masonic Temple, located at 1521 West Wilson Avenue, in Chicago, was the home of Loyal Chapter No. 223.\n\nSee Evert E. Lawson (ed.), 1968-1969 Masonic Directory: A Listing of Masonic Lodges and Appendant Bodies in Illinois, Glenwood, Illinois: Temple Publishers (1968).\n\nPaul Revere Chapter No. 260 also resided in this temple until its 28 February 1935 merger into Loyal Chapter.\n\nPlease click here for a history of the temple from its former owner, Paul Revere Lodge No. 998, AF&AM.\n\nFollowing the building’s sale, Loyal Chapter formally removed to Evanston and became effectively dormant until being resurrected at Franklin Park on 17 July 2006. Having been renamed M.I.B. Red Chapter on 1 August 2008, the chapter removed on 29 June 2012 to Elmhurst where their convocations are held on the third Monday of each month at 7:30 p.m.\n\nThe building is now a Buddhist temple, and is a mere block east of another former Masonic temple at 4605 North Paulina Street.\n\nThe first image was captured by Google Streetview, and shows the structure in its current state.\n\nThe second image was taken by Robert W. Krueger in 1985, and is available from the Chicago Public Library’s digital collections.\n\nThe cathedral was a complex of individual, yet abutting and interconnected, buildings facing Walton Place, Dearborn Street, and Delaware Place, all owned by the Scottish Rite Valley of Chicago. The most prominent of the buildings was the limestone church at 935 North Dearborn Street [n.s.] (235 Dearborn Avenue [o.s.]), built by Collier’s Unity Church,[2] an offshoot of the Unitarians,[3] beginning with the laying of its cornerstone on\n\n29 August 1867, and later purchased by the Medinah Shriners on 30 April\n\n1903.[4]\n\nThe more significant building in the complex, from our perspective here, however, is the large structure built, and first occupied in 1905, by the Scottish Rite[5] in the centER of the block, adjoining the south side of the church, and accessing the street via a stone-faced corridor extension constructed in the vacated alleyway at 923 North Dearborn Street [n.s.] (293-5 Dearborn Avenue [o.s.]).[6] The Valley’s so-called “Small Preceptory” occupied the third floor of this building in the centre of the block, and was the meeting place of La Fayette Chapter No. 2 from the 1960s until the complex was turned over to the property developers on 19 December 2006.[7] The structure was carefully razed over the course of several weeks in September and October 2007;[8] care and precision were required in order not to damage the surrounding structures.\n\nDespite it having been constructed by the Scottish Rite, rather than a Holy Royal Arch chapter or other York Rite entity, notice the keystone design of the apex of the west wall in the second photograph on the left. In later years, large ductwork obscured the view of the keystone shape.\n\nBoth buildings face Washington Square Park, popularly known in the early 20th Century as “Bughouse Square.” [9]\n\nThe colorized postcard to the left depicts both Medinah Shriners’ church building and the Scottish Rite’s structure (albeit with the entrance to the latter erroneously coloured as brick, rather than as its actual grey stone), sometime between 1905 and 1911, C.E. The monochromatic photograph of the Scottish Rite structure and the 1891 George B. Carpenter mansion comes to us by the courtesy of the Scottish Rite Valley of Chicago. The aerial or orbital photographs of the complex are copyright by MapQuest and are used herein pursuant to the fair use doctrine. The areal photograph of the demolition\n\nwere captured by Companion Stanley W. Smith of La Fayette Chapter No. 2 on 13 September 2007. The ground-level\n\nphotographs were captured by Companion David A. Miley, also of La Fayette Chapter No. 2 on 15 September and 1 November 2007.\n\n[2] Sam Loiacono & Harry Strouse, eds., Scottish Rite Cathedral Tour, Valley\n\nof Chicago, Chicago, Illinois: Scottish Rite Valley of Chicago (2003): 1.\n\n[3] Alphonse Cerza, 33°, A History of the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite in\n\nIllinois, 1846-1965, Bloomington, Illinois: Illinois Council of Deliberation (1966): 65-66.\n\n[4] Id.\n\n[5] George W.

Rapp, and was built on the tragic site of the ill-fated Iroquois Theatre.\n\nWhen dedicated in 1926, the temple was the home of La Fayette Chapter No. 2, Wiley M. Egan Chapter No. 126, Hyde Park Chapter No. 240, and Temple Chapter No. 252. No Masonic bodies meet there at present.\n\nSee Evert E. Lawson (ed.), 1968-1969 Masonic Directory: A Listing of Masonic Lodges and Appendant Bodies in Illinois, Glenwood, Illinois: Temple Publishers (1968).\n\nThe first photograph on the left is a post card from the Curt Teich Postcard Archives of the Lake County Discovery Museum.\n\nThe second photograph was captured by the Chicago Architectural Photographing Company and is found among the University of Illinois’ Northwest Architectural Archives (American Terra Cotta Company Photographs).\n\nThe tall, dark building, seen half a block to the east, is the Daniel Burnham-designed Masonic Temple Building (1892-1939).\n\nThe third image is the cover of the temple’s leather-bound dedication book, and is a part of the archives of La Fayette Chapter No. 2.\n\nThe final image comes to us from Planet99.com.\n\nDespite its somewhat confusing name, West Chicago Masonic Temple was not located in West Chicago, but rather on the west side of the City of Chicago, at 12 South Oakley Boulevard [n.s.] (105 South Oakley Boulevard [o.s.]).\n\nThe temple was the home of Washington Chapter No. 43, Wiley M. Eagan Chapter No. 126, and York Chapter No. 148, when it opened in 1907. Wiley M. Egan Chapter removed nineteen years later to the United Masonic Temple downtown. All three of the chapters each gradually merged into what is now La Fayette Chapter No. 2.\n\nThe temple is currently home to a church. A formal cornerstone laying occurred on 2 November 1907, yet the northeast corner is bare of markings. Whether there is a ceremonial cornerstone elsewhere on the structure is currently under investigation.\n\nThe photographs were captured by Companion David Miley. The image of the commemorative fob image comes courtesy of Companion Paul A. Scheeler, Past High Priest of La Fayette Chapter No. 2.\n\nLocated on the eastern edge of East Front Street’s Block 43, this temple was home to both El Paso’s Masonic bodies – including Mackey Chapter No. 130 – but town’s Grand Opera (not to be confused with the City Opera House, a block to the west) as well.\n\nMackey Chapter relocated to El Paso’s current Masonic Temple, almost directly due south of this former temple, before merging on 1 August 2008 into Bloomington Chapter No. 26 of Bloomington.\n\nLocated at 310 East Chicago Street, Elgin’s former Masonic temple was home to Loyal L. Munn Chapter No. 96.\n\nSee Evert E. Lawson (ed.), 1968-1969 Masonic Directory: A Listing of Masonic Lodges and Appendant Bodies in Illinois,\n\nGlenwood, Illinois: Temple Publishers (1968).\n\nFollowing the 16 November 1920 fire that destroyed Monitor Temple, approximately 1,200 Freemasons – the largest gathering of men ever in the history of the city – met at the Elgin State Hospital on 24 November, to deliberate about a new temple, and to form a committee to make a recommendation.\n\nThe cornerstone was laid on 9 June 1923, and the temple was constructed at an estimated cost of US$200,000.\n\nSee Cathy Newby, “Masonic Temple”, James McDunn, ed., Postcards From the Past: A Brief History of Elgin Illinois.\n\nThe costs of maintaining the large, aging temple eventually became untenable for its resident Masonic bodies. The building was sold on 22 March 1991 for US$163,000. Ibid.\n\nThe former temple was subsequently converted into a fundamentalist low-Protestant church. On 10 October 2007, the Elgin City Council approved 5-2 the church’s request to alter the historical landmark by removing the cornerstone, square & compasses, and other Masonic symbols from its exterior, on the condition that the removal be performed by professionals under the city’s supervision. The materials were placed in the custody of the Elgin Historical Society and Museum.\n\nThe convocations of Loyal L. Munn Chapter No. 96 are now held in Palatine at 7:30 p.m. on the first Wednesday evening of each month, aside from July and August in which the chapter is dark.\n\nThe first and third photographs to the left were captured by Flickr contributor, Seth Gaines.\n\nClick here to see Mr. Gaines’ extraordinary portfolio.\n\nThe second photograph is a vintage postcard from James McDunn’s site, Postcards From the Past: A Brief History of Elgin Illinois.\n\nLocated at 721 9th Street, Highland’s John Wildi Masonic Temple was the home of Highland Chapter No. 169 until the chapter merged into Granite City Chapter No. 221 on 15 October 1984.\n\nSee Evert E. Lawson (ed.),\n\n1968-1969 Masonic Directory: A Listing of Masonic Lodges and Appendant Bodies in Illinois,\n\nGlenwood, Illinois: Temple Publishers (1968).\n\nJohn Wildi commissioned M. O. Ulrich to build a French revival-style home and carriage house for his family. Upon his death in 1910, Wildi’s widow, Louise, continued living in the home. Then in 1920, Mrs. Wildi deeded her home in a trust to the brothers of Highland Lodge No. 583.\n\nMrs. Louise Wildi also donated $10,000.00 to the lodge if they could match it for the purpose of adding on a dining room and lodge/chapter hall. On 4 March 1922 the addition was dedicated. In 1933 Mrs. Wildi set up an endowment trust fund for the maintenance and upkeep of the building.\n\nPlease click here for a much more detailed history of John Wildi Masonic\n\nTemple.\n\nThe first photograph to the left comes to us from Highland Lodge No. 583.\n\nThe second photograph was captured by Bing.\n\nThe third floor of the former DuPage County Cash Store building, located on what was then River (now 40 Chicago Avenue), was the original home of\n\nEuclid Chapter No. 13 from 1851 thru 1852. The related Euclid Lodge No. 65 was organized in 1848 in the frame building to the left of the store.\n\nThe wording on the front of the building, between the second and third floors, reads “Crockery Hardware Dry Goods Groceries”. From the Naperville Historic Walking Tour, courtesy of the Naper Settlement Museum:\n\nHenry Peaslee, 1850. This is one of Naperville’s oldest commercial buildings, similar to [214 North Ellsworth Street].\n\nThe building housed a grocery and dry goods store, with dances and social gatherings held in a hall on the third floor.\n\nPlease visit the history section of Euclid Chapter’s website to see the other buildings that formerly served as their temple.\n\nThe picture to the left shows the first lodge hall building as it looks as of April 2007.\n\nThese images are presented through the courtesy of Euclid Chapter No. 13.\n\nConstructed in 1900 at 117½ South 4th Street, Oregon’s Masonic Temple\n\nwas the home of Rock City Chapter No. 151 until their 30 June 1942 merger into Tyrian Chapter No. 61 of Polo. The combined chapter merged into Nachusa Chapter No. 56 of Dixon on 5 November 1963.\n\nThe three-story, yellow brick façade was designed in the Classical Revival style, and features ivory brick accents to create a quoin effect\n\non the upper storeys. The second story windows are consist of sets of three lights surrounding a smaller central light. Above the triangular pediment is a stone shield bearing the year 1900 and a Mark Master capstone.\n\nFollowing the departure of the chapter and other bodies, Oregon Lodge No. 420 refurbished and repainted the old annunciator globe lights to commemorate the lodge and memorialize John C. Berger.\n\nSee\n\nthe temple’s National Register of Historic Places registration form;\n\nWikipedia article, “Masonic Temple Lodge No. 420” [sic].\n\nThe first image to the left was captured by Flickr contributor Teemu008.\n\nThe second image is a close-up view of the same photograph.\n\nThe third photograph, showing the globe lamps, was captured by Andy McMurray.\n\nErected 20 November 1904 at 1 North Plum Grove Road, this structure was the oldest, continuously occupied non-commercial, non-residential building in Palatine. Built of brick by Palatine Lodge No. 314 and Palatine Chapter No. 206, the second story held the lodge/chapter hall, with storage in the attic above. The temple later also became home to Loyal L. Munn Chapter No. 96. The building’s cornerstone was hollow and held a time capsule that was opened in 2004. Its contents were donated to the Palatine Historical Society.\n\nSee “Palatine’s Masonic Hall steeped in rich history”, Melissa Hollander, Daily Herald, 2 July 2004; and an unidentified newspaper article hand-dated December 1961, on display in the current Palatine Masonic Temple.\n\nThe ground floor was originally rented out to various organisations and businesses. For the building’s first decade, that floor was the Palatine Athletic Club, at which time the temple held suburban Cook County’s first two-lane bowling alley. The temple had no non-Masonic tenants again until 1951 when the Palatine’s Public Library moved in briefly between permanent homes, to be replaced by the Palatine Leader newspaper and, thereafter, a Christian Science reading room.\n\nSee Hollander, supra.\n\nIn approximately 1961, the lodge rehabilitated the temple, replacing the utilities and updating the exterior brickwork with blue-grey paint and adding shutters to the windows. See unidentified 1961 article, supra.\n\nThe city of Palatine condemned the temple in 2009 in order to reconfigure and improve the traffic intersection at Plum Grove and Palatine Roads. A multi-step land-swap was negotiated between the city and the lodge. The city traded a its soon-to-be vacated fire station at\n\n455 West Dundee Road and approximately US$592,000 for the 1904 temple property. As the city needed the old temple nearly two years before the replacement fire station would be completed, the deal also included temporary use of a previously condemned and vacant former Harris Bank data processing annex less than two blocks west of the old temple. See\n\n“New Palatine Fire Station Coming to Quentin Road”, Brian Slupski, Palatine Patch, 27 October 2010.\n\nThe first two photographs were captured by Michael Zale (Flickr alias Neopsychedelia) in March 2008.\n\nClick here to see Mr. Zale’s Flickr portfolio.\n\nThe last two photographs depict Eugene Fifielski’s beautifully detailed scale model of the temple, and were captured by Companion David Miley on 6 November 2010. The model is displayed in the current Palatine Masonic Temple and makes periodic appearances in local parades and the public library.\n\nLocated at 150 West Wilson Street, Palatine, this former Harris Bank data processing annex was the temporary home of Loyal L. Munn and Palatine Chapters No. 96 and 206, who meet on, respectively, the first Wednesday and second Thursday of each month.\n\nIn 2009, the City of Palatine condemned the 1904 temple in order to reconfigure and improve the traffic intersection at Plum Grove and Palatine Roads. A multi-step land-swap was negotiated between the city and Palatine Lodge No. 314. The city traded a its soon-to-be vacated fire station at 455 West Dundee Road and approximately US$592,000 for the 1904 temple property. As the city needed the old temple nearly two years before the replacement fire station would be completed, the deal also included temporary use of the ground floor of this previously\n\ncondemned and vacant former Harris Bank data processing annex located less than two blocks west of the old temple. See\n\n“New Palatine Fire Station Coming to Quentin Road”, Brian Slupski, Palatine Patch, 27 October 2010.\n\nLocated adjacent to both the city’s central train station and the future site of the new city hall, this building is slated to be razed to make room for a multi-deck parking garage.\n\nRather than simply using make-shift arrangements during their brief\n\ntenure in the bank building, Palatine’s Masonic bodies outfitted the\n\nspace with a proper lodge-chapter-council hall & asylum, mounted their\n\nframed material on the walls, built daises, installed ceiling lights for\n\nthe altar and Easter Star positions, inter alia.\n\nThese photographs were captured by Companion David Miley on 6 November 2010.\n\nThe former home of Springfield Chapter No. 1.\n\nThe following is excerpted from History of Springfield Chapter No. 1, Royal Arch Masons:\n\nPlanning for this temple [now the Hoogland Centre for the Arts]\n\nwas initiated in 1904. Building sites were scarce and after mature consideration the one at 418-420 South 6th Street was approved and finally selected.\n\nThe committee canvassed the situation and recommended that an assessment of $1,666.66 be placed against each of the bodies. It was decided to call for subscriptions, Comp. Herman Pierik leading off with the sum of $1,000.00. Pledges were received of $500.00, $200.00 and one hundred and ten of $100.00 each. A great many others were received from $75.00 down to $5.00, aggregating $40,000.00. It was decided as impracticable to remodel the house as originally intended. This building was later sold for $1,000.00 which was turned into the building fund.\n\nBro. John I. Rinaker, Jr., of Central Lodge was selected as the architect and he drew the plans for the present temple.\n\nThe corner-stone was laid with appropriate Masonic services by the\n\nGrand Lodge of Illinois with Bro. Alexander Hamilton Bell, grand master, of Carlinville, presiding in 1908.\n\nThe cost of the building without the elevator was to be $50,000.00 but\n\nwith the elevator and changes suggested by the committee the cost of the building was raised to $60,000.00.\n\nComp. Pierik devoted ten years to collecting the outstanding pledges, collecting from the bodies their shares and redeeming them at maturity, all except $9,000.00. This was finally cleared up twenty-seven years after commencement of the enterprise.\n\nThey later constructed a penthouse so that the elevator could run the full four stories.\n\nThe following is from The Historic Sites Commission of Springfield Illinois, the source of the photograph to the left:\n\n“In 1960, the Masons built a large addition to the original building and placed a limestone and brick façade to both buildings. Bill Turley was commissioned as the architect for the addition and renovation of\n\nthe Masonic Temple. Mr. Turley was also the architect for the YMCA and the Thomas Rees Memorial Tower and Carillon. As part of the renovation, Mr. Turley utilized a limestone facade for the original building.”\n\nFrom the Hoogland Center for the Arts:\n\n“Then in 2001, through the generous gift of Carolyn Oxtoby and Stephen Bartholf, the Masonic Temple was purchased, and the not-for-profit organization Springfield Arts Center, Inc. began its quest to\n\ntransfigure the facility into the Center for the Arts. Additional funding was secured from the Illinois Arts Council for architectural planning and consultation. Recognizing the immense public benefit this project held for the people of Springfield, the State of Illinois awarded a grant of $5.5 million to begin the renovation. Disbursement of state monies\n\ncame in 2003, and renovation work began almost immediately.”\n\nIn 1889, Urbana Lodge No. 157 purchased the Tiernan Building, at 115 West Main Street, where the lodge and Urbana Chapter No. 80 moved into the former Busey’s Opera Hall on the third story.\n\nThe ground floor and second story were, respectively, commercial space and offices, leased to various concerns over the years. In the early twentieth century, the building was significantly remodelled and gained a new, generally classical revival façade, culminating with a rededication by M.W. Grand Master Henry T. Burnap on 14 November 1914. The Beaux-arts parapet was discovered in early 1950s to be structurally unsound, and was replaced in 1953 by architects Royer and Davis with a simpler design which complimented the classical revival style below it.\n\nClick here to read the City of Urbana’s page about the Tiernan Building, which the city considers one of their 100 most significant buildings.\n\nClick here to read Masonic author Todd E. Creason’s page about the building.\n\nUrbana Chapter No. 80 merged into Champaign Chapter No. 50, of\n\nChampaign, on 11 September 1983\n\nFormerly located at the corner of Grove and Washington Streets, in Vicksburg, Mississippi, this temple was constructed in 1848 and razed in 1973 as part of an urban renewal plan. As one can see in an aerial view,\n\nthe land is still vacant.\n\nFor one month in early 1864, the temple was the temporary home of\n\nAsboth Military Chapter UD to whom a dispensation was issued in 1863 by the Grand Royal Arch Chapter of the State of Illinois.\n\nThe chapter was officered by civilians attached to the military work at\n\nColumbus, Kentucky, where it existed from 6 July 1863 until 20 January 1864, when it was moved to Vicksburg, and it met there from 28 January to 24 February 1864. The Grand High Priest, Hiram W. Hubbard, went with the chapter to Vicksburg, Mississippi. He said upon arrival:\n\nWe found the Masonic Temple under control of the Military Authorities. The Lodge room was occupied by three Military Lodges, the Chapter room by the Military Commission, who cheerfully gave way. We found several Royal Arch Masons there from Illinois, and a number of the former officers and members of Vicksburg Chapter No. 3, who rendered every assistance in their power by furnishing robes, jewels and fixtures, and aiding in the work.\n\nThe simple yet substantial building, an example of late Georgian architecture, had cast-iron lintels, brick pilasters and cornices. The brick\n\nentablature consisted of a wide capitular architrave and frieze, and a\n\ncornice with dentils ran across the east and south sides.\n\nThe second photograph shows a close-up of the large stone inset on the west side, between the second and third floors. It bears a Square and Compasses, within a capitular archway, flanked by a level and plumb.\n\nThe third photograph shows the south entrance at 717 Grove Street, which had been converted into a window. It features a capitular architrave, the keystone of which is inscribed with the Square and Compasses.\n\nThe fourth photograph shows the east and south sides. The white × in the background, less than two blocks west, marks the Illinois Central Railroad tracks.\n\nThese photographs were produced in 1972, by the Library of Congress’ Historic American Buildings Survey, a year before the building’s demolition.\n\nClick here to see the complete file on the temple.\n\nHaving outgrown the earlier Masonic temple at the corner of Sheridan Road and Washington Street, Waukegan’s temple association purchased the former “Dickinson property” at 220 North Sheridan Road, from William I. and Charles R. Lyon in March 1919.\n\nThis new temple was designed by E.E. Roberts and constructed by Hanson Brothers for US$136,000, with the cornerstone being laid on 24 April 1920. In the mean time, the old temple was sold on 2 February 1920 to Samuel Schwartz for US$21,500 and a lease pending completion of this new temple. The earlier temple’s third floor Masonic hall became Congregation Am Echod’s synagogue.\n\nSee:\n\n•City of Waukegan, Department of Planning and Zoning, Historic Preservation Commission: “Waukegan Masonic Temple”;\n\n•Landmarks Illinois: “Old Masonic Temple, 220 North Sheridan Road, Waukegan, (E.E. Roberts, 1920-21)”;\n\n•Congregation Am Echod: “Congregation Am Echod History 1896 – 2006”;\n\nThis temple was the home of Waukegan Chapter No. 41 from 1921 until\n\nits sale in 1982, at which time the chapter and Waukegan’s other Masonic organizations established a new temple on Genesee Street,\n\nwhere convocations are held on the third Tuesday evening of each month. The 1920 temple remains abandoned and in an increasingly poor state of disrepair.\n\nSee:\n\n•City of Waukegan, Department of Planning and Zoning, Historic Preservation Commission: “Waukegan Masonic Temple”;\n\n•Landmarks Illinois: “Old Masonic Temple, 220 North Sheridan Road, Waukegan, (E.E.

Three Pillars’ companions found getting a lunch-time quorum increasingly impracticable, finally merged the chapter into West Suburban Chapter No. 207 in Downers Grove on 10 June 2010. Not only was West Suburban Chapter geographically closest, but the two chapters shared a substantial overlap in membership.\n\nThe temple was constructed in 1893 as a meeting house of the Religious Society of Friends (a/k/a “Quakers”). The property was subsequently acquired by the First United Methodist Church.\n\nIn 1951, the church built a new stone structure downtown, and their former home was re-consecrated as the Western Springs Masonic Temple. In addition to re-configuring the chapel into a lodge / chapter hall, the brethren excavated a basement and constructed a fellowship hall therein.\n\nThe photograph is presented through the courtesy of Three Pillars Chapter No. 280.\n\nThe painting hangs on the wall in the chapter hall.\n\nLocated at 311 North Main Street, Wilmington’s Masonic temple was home to Wilmington Chapter No. 142.\n\nSee Evert E. Lawson (ed.),\n\n1968-1969 Masonic Directory: A Listing of Masonic Lodges and Appendant Bodies in Illinois,\n\nGlenwood, Illinois: Temple Publishers (1968).\n\nWilmington Chapter merged into Kankakee Chapter No. 78, of\n\nKankakee, on 30 July 2004.\n\nThe chapter’s earlier temple stood on the same lot and, quite atypically, was owned by the chapter. Wilmington Chapter of Royal Arch Masons No. 142. The earlier temple was built as an Episcopal church in 1867 at a cost of US$7,000; and was long disused and in a poor state of repair when Wilmington Chapter purchased it for a mere US$600 in 1903. The chapter spent another US$473.43 on repairs, and it was consecrated as a Masonic temple on 21 October 1904. The chapter sold the deed to the\n\nTemple Association for a pro forma US$1.00 in preparation for razing that temple and constructing the current building.\n\nSee\n\nWilmington Lodge No. 208, A History of Wilmington Lodge No. 208, A.
