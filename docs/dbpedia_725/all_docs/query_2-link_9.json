        "text": "The three Lodges convened in Springfield to hold a special session of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge, Ancient Free and Accepted York Masons, State of Illinois on May 6, 1867 to announce her formation. Central Lodge was opened in due form by Most Worshipful Brother Jones who conducted the election of the first officers which ended with the following results:\n\nGrand Master - Brother Benjamin Franklin Rogers of Springfield\n\nDeputy Grand Master - Brother Harrison D. King of Chicago\n\nSenior Grand Warden - Brother E. White of Alton\n\nJunior Grand Warden - Brother William Lyman Darrow of Chicago\n\nGrand Treasurer - Brother Isaac H. Kelley of Alton\n\nGrand Secretary - Brother George L. Thomas of Chicago\n\nAfter the installation of the officers, the Lodges were renumbered according to their dates of original charter with North Star Lodge as #1, Griffin T. Watson Lodge as #2 and Central Lodge as #3. In addition to renumbering of the first three Lodges, three additional Lodges which had previously been warranted in the State of Illinois by the Grand Lodge of Ohio were also chartered - Evening Star Lodge #4 of Bloomington, Lincoln Lodge #5 of Cairo and Freemont Lodge #6 of Shawneetown.\n\nThe Illinois Jurisdiction had a strong presence in each of the hemispheres of the state. While growth would continue internally, the bond with the National Grand Lodge would deteriorate. The Grand Lodge of Illinois dissolved amity with the National Grand Lodge in 1877 like the Grand Lodge of Ohio did years earlier.\n\nThe articles of incorporation were amended in 1885 by the hands of Most Worshipful Brother Joseph W. Moore, Grand Master and Right Worshipful Brother Richard E. Moore, Grand Secretary to remove York from the name to reflect the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, State of Illinois. This was done to distinguish itself from irregular York Masons of America that were unaffiliated with the Grand Lodge of England.\n\nTo solidify the linkage of the Grand Lodge to the other Prince Hall Affiliated Grand Lodges in America, the Grand Lodge was renamed and incorporated as the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge, Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of the State of Illinois in 1909 by the hands of Most Worshipful Brother George E. Jesse, Grand Master and Right Worshipful Brother Richard E. Moore, Grand Secretary.\n\nTo distinguish itself from other organizations bearing the name Ancient Free and Accepted Masons, the Grand Lodge was renamed and incorporated as the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge, Free and Accepted Masons, State of Illinois by Most Worshipful Brother Thomas H. Samuels, Grand Master and Right Worshipful Brother Baker De Pugh, Grand Secretary. This is the name that the Grand Lodge bears to this day.\n\nToday, Illinois Prince Hall Freemasonry is recognized as a pillar for perpetual improvement in the community. Prince Hall Freemasonry promotes a way of life that binds like-minded men in a worldwide brotherhood that transcends all religious, ethnic, cultural, social and educational differences; by teaching the great principles of brotherly love, relief and truth; and, by the outward expression of these through its fellowship, to find ways in which to serve God, family, country, neighbors and self. The vision of the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Illinois is to make the institution of Freemasonry into a relevant and integral part of Illinois communities where Masons have a presence into and beyond the 21st Century.\n\nSince inception, the Most Worshipful Prince Hall Grand Lodge, Free and Accepted Masons, State of Illinois has actively participated in the causes of social activism and community improvement. This is documented by efforts before, during and after the formation of the Grand Lodge of Illinois:\n\nThe bulk of the founding members of the Grand Lodge of Illinois were abolitionists during Slavery.\n\nPGM John Jones fought to remove the Illinois Black Codes and to gain passage of the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments to the United States Constitution. He became the first black elected official in Illinois in 1871 as Cook County Commissioner.\n\nThe brethren of the City of Chicago and Aurora contributed to relief during the Chicago Fire of 1871. This led to the formation of Keystone Lodge #15 in the City of Aurora in 1874.\n\nMany brethren served their country during the Spanish American War in 1898 and World War One. Many of the officers of the Eighth Illinois Regiment were Prince Hall Masons.\n\nThe Order of the Bees for Boys and Girls was formed as the first youth initiative in 1922. The Order of the Junior Craftsmen was the second initiative formed in 1938 to focus on the development of young men. PGM Henry G. Fort partnered with the National Urban League in the 1950s and 60s to provide job training for the youths. The Order remains in existence to this date.\n\nThe Grand Lodge offered relief during the Great Depression and service during World War Two and successive wars and conflicts endured by the country.\n\nThe Grand Lodge continues to offer relief and service to distressed citizens and to our country through service and educational donations. The current efforts were clearly sourced by the labors of the past. By the grace of God, these efforts will continue well into the future."
