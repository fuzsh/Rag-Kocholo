Bromwell Grand Secretary Cincinnati, Ohio FORWARD\n\nTo the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of Ohio:\n\nThis volume closes the History of the Grand Lodge from its organization in 1808 to and including the Annual Communication of 1912. Volume I, prepared and edited by M.·. W.·. William M. Cunningham, covered the period from its organization in 1808 to 1844, inclusive, and volumes II and III, prepared by and under the supervision of the present Committee, the period from 1845 to 1912, inclusive; volume II from 1845 to 1891, and volume III from 1892 to 1912, and including an Addenda, containing reference tables, statistics, and other valuable information for the Craft.\n\nPortraits of all the Grand Masters of the Grand Lodge of Ohio from its organization until 1912, inclusive, were secured and are inserted in the History, except the following, which could not be obtained, although every effort was made to do so, viz.: Chester Griswold, 1818; William J. Irvin, 1825; Samuel Wheeler, 1826; John M. Goodenow, 1827; John Satterwaite, 1831, and A. H. Battin, 1872.\n\nTo facilitate the work the Committee, at the request of the Chairman, designated M.·. W.·. Brother W. A. Belt to prepare the indexes for these two volumes, and he has carefully and skillfully performed that tedious and important duty.\n\nThe Committee and this Grand Lodge suffered a great loss in the death of M.·. W.·. Brother Leander Burdick, who departed this life on the first day of January, A. D. 1913.\n\nBrother Burdick took a great interest in the History, and by reason of his long continued and active service in the Grand Lodge was well qualified to and did render valuable advice and assistance to the Chairman of the Committee in its preparation. The compilation of this work was practically completed and received his approval before his death. His loss was severely felt and regretted, not only by this Committee, but by every member of this Grand Lodge who had been favored by coming in contact with the benign influence of his upright, sterling qualities and high standard as a man and a Mason.\n\nSpace will not permit an extended eulogy, but reference is made to the history of his administration as Grand Master, and the valuable services he rendered the Grand Lodge and the Craft in this Jurisdiction, as recorded in this History and the Proceedings of the Grand Lodge.\n\nAt the 1913 Annual Communication of this Grand Lodge, held October 22d, 1913, the Grand Master announced the appointment of M.·. W.·. Brother O. P. Sperra to fill the vacancy in this Committee caused by the death of M.·. W.·. Brother Leander Burdick.\n\nThe Chairman desires to acknowledge and tender to the other members of the Committee his thanks for the valuable assistance and advice they so cheerfully rendered him in the compilation and preparation of the history; and to specially express his appreciation of the efficient services of R.·. W.·. Brother J. H. Bromwell and M.·. W.·. Brother W. A. Belt in furnishing data, correcting proof, preparing, compiling, and publishing of the work.\n\nThe Brethren will readily appreciate the difficulty experienced by the Chairman in condensing within the limits of two volumes the important acts and proceedings of this Grand Lodge, covering a period of sixty-eight of it's Annual Communications, and detailed in several thousand pages of its printed proceedings.\n\nMany items had to be omitted, others condensed and summarized, leaving to the Masonic Student desiring the details recourse to the printed proceedings, which should be in every Lodge library.\n\nIf the perusal of this History induces a number of the Craft to read and study the glorious record of our Grand Lodge as recorded in it annual proceedings, including the history of Freemasonry in the World, as detailed in the annual reports of our Foreign Correspondence Committee, it will have accomplished its purpose, and your Committee feel its labors have not been in vain.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJohn G.

III HISTORY OF THE GRAND LODGE FROM 1892 TO 1912 1892 M.·. W.·. LEVI C. GOODALE, GRAND MASTER\n\nGrand Lodge convened in the city hall, Springfield, Wednesday, October 19, A. D. 1892, with Grand Master Levi C. Goodale in the Chair, and all the Grand Officers present except R.·. W.·. Bro. W. F. Baldwin, Senior Grand Warden, and R.·. W.·. Bro. L. F. VanCleve, Grand Chaplain, both of whom had died since the last Annual Grand Communication; and R.·. W.·. Bro. Jewett Palmer, Grand Marshal, unavoidably detained at home. The following Past Grand Officers were present: Past Grand Masters R. C. Lemmon, Wm. M. Cunningham, C. C. Kiefer, S. S. Williams, C. A. Woodward and L. Burdick; and Past D. G. Masters J. L'H. Long and W. J. Akers and the representatives of 488 Lodges.\n\nThe Grand Master read his address, calling attention to the death of Our Grand Chaplain, Rev. LaFayette VanClove, who died March 2, 1892, and who served as Grand Chaplain of the Grand Lodge from 1877 to the date of his death, in a similar position in the Grand Chapter of Ohio and as Grand Prelate of the Grand Commandery of Ohio, K. T., for twenty-four consecutive years. A Special Communication of the Grand Lodge was held at Milford, Ohio, March 6, 1892, for the purpose of performing the funeral obsequies according to Masonic usage, over his remains. A great number of Lodges, Chapters, and Commanderies were present, and the ceremonies took place from the church in which he officiated as pastor previous to his death. The proceedings will be found On pages 3 to 6, of the Grand Lodge proceedings.\n\nAttention was called, also, to the death of our R.·. W.·. Senior Grand Warden W. F. Baldwin, who died April 3, 1892, a Special Communication of the Grand Lodge being held at the Masonic Temple, Mount Vernon, Ohio, April 12, A. D. 1892, for the purpose of conducting his funeral ceremonies according to Masonic usage, an account of the proceedings being recorded in the proceedings of the Grand Lodge, pages 7 and 8.\n\nDispensations were granted for the following new Lodges:\n\nRoseville at Roseville, Muskingum County\n\nTrinity at Bucyrus, Crawford County\n\nLinwood at Linwood, Hamilton County\n\nThe craft laid the corner stones of a number of public buildings this year.\n\nSpeaking of the \"District Lecturers\" the Grand Master says: \"The time has come, in my opinion, when this authority should be recognized by conferring upon them, at least, the privilege of membership in the Grand Lodge. They should have a place of honor in our meetings, and be clothed with appropriate collars and jewels.\"\n\nDuring the past year over four hundred questions were asked, nearly all of which could have been answered by the Code and former decisions, but only twelve are reported as not covered by the Code or former decisions, the last of which relates to the Order of the Eastern Star.\n\nHe decides under the legislation and decisions of the Grand Lodge and former Grand Masters to decline to permit the use of anterooms to Lodge Halls, etc., to be used by this organization for reception or banquet purposes. He says, \"While agreeing with my predecessors that this order is not Masonic, and that meetings of the order should not be held in Lodge rooms, I regret that fidelity to the rules of the Grand Lodge compelled me to this decision. I believe that the policy of denying the use of Lodge and anterooms to this organization is unwise. * * * It is no more than the proper demand of the law of compensation that the wives and daughters of Masons should be permitted to enjoy in part the social opportunities which follow membership in a Masonic Lodge.\"\n\nHe calls attention to the requests for recognition from the Grand Lodges of Switzerland, (Alpena), of Mexico, Japan and Italy, and refers the same to the Foreign Correspondence Committee for investigation and report.\n\nCalls attention to the claim of Chas. H. Lander, that at the time of the trouble at Worthington, he was a member of a Lodge in West Virginia, and loyal to this Grand Lodge, and requests that the same receive proper attention.\n\nReports on the litigation of the Grand Lodge, that the cases at Cleveland had been argued and submitted to Judge Lamson in September, 1890, but no decision had been rendered yet. The cases at Bucyrus were prepared for trial, but a few days before they were reached the plaintiff dismissed them. The Columbus cases had been decided by Judge Evans in favor of the Grand Lodge, appealed by the plaintiffs, Hershiser et al. to the Circuit Court of Franklin County, which sustained the demurrers of the Grand Lodge to the third amended petition following the decision of Judge Evans that the state courts had no jurisdiction to determine mere questions of membership in Masonic bodies.\n\nIn October, 1891, the Grand Lodge of Kentucky adopted a resolution inviting the several Grand Lodges to send delegates to a Fraternal Congress to be held at the Masonic Temple, Chicago, Ills., in August, 1893. A number of Grand Lodges had already appointed delegates, and the matter was submitted as to whether we should not do likewise.\n\nMASONIC HOME\n\n\"The report of the committee will show that $104,000.00 has been subscribed for the work. This afternoon the corner stone of this edifice will be laid, and ere many months Ohio will have a home for those of the craft who need shelter or the comforts of a home; and the Masons of Ohio will be enrolled on the list of those jurisdictions which are making Masonic relief practical.\" A list of the Grand Lodges which have established homes, with the approximate cost of each, is given.\n\nAfter careful investigation authorized the removal of Bloomfield Lodge No.422, from Sparta, Morrow County, to Centerburg, Knox County, which was approved by the Grand Lodge.\n\nThe following Lodges, chartered at the last communication, had been duly instituted and constituted:\n\nYork Lodge, at Columbus, by M.·. W.·. P. G. M. S. S. Williams; North Baltimore Lodge, at North Baltimore, by W. Jr. G. D. J. W. Chamberlin; Weston Lodge, at Weston, by R.·. W.·. D. G. M. Allen Andrews; Golden Rule Lodge, at Chicago Junction, by M.·. W.·. P. G. M. S. Stacker Williams. A number of Masonic Halls had been dedicated during the year.\n\nReceiving information that the Senior Warden elect of Brooklyn Lodge No.454 was an avowed active Cernean, he wired the Installing Officer to require each Officer elect, before being installed, to declare in open Lodge that he is not now a member of any organization which had been declared to be clandestine or un-masonic. The Senior Warden and Secretary refused to comply and were not installed. After correspondence, finding the report true, he declared the offices of Senior Warden and Secretary vacant, and ordered a new election, requiring the Brothers elect to make a like declaration, which was complied with.\n\nArrested the charter and took up the effects of Battin Lodge No.487 and sent same to the Grand Secretary, except the Bible which on request was left with the Brethren of the Lodge.\n\nThe Lodge room of Gibson Lodge, with its effects, was again destroyed by fire, and a dispensation issued until this session permitting them to work.\n\nIn the matter of Brother Whitehurst of Dayton: he burned all the books in his possession and made declaration he would not circulate any more, whereupon proceedings against him were dismissed.\n\nReported that in compliance with the resolution adopted at the last session of the Grand Lodge, (page 49, proceedings 1891), the Committee on Ritual had prepared and submitted to him a written copy, which he had approved and promulgated on September 1, and had the same in his custody for proper use and preservation, under the direction of the Grand Lodge.\n\nIRREGULAR MASONS\n\n\"The action of the seceders at Worthington last year, and the course pursued toward them by this Grand Lodge, has attracted the attention of other jurisdictions. The action of this Grand Lodge has been invariably sustained. One of the outgrowths of the Worthington disaffection was Franklin Lodge in Columbus; and having information that the Officers of this organization were claiming their members could visit in regular Lodges in this state, and that some were attempting to so visit, in order to prevent such visitation the Grand Master issued and mailed to each Lodge an edict calling their attention to these facts and instructing them as follows:\n\n\"Now, therefore, it is ordered, and you are hereby commanded to exact from every visitor to your Lodge, without exception, (and taken in the usual form of oath from visiting brethren), the following declaration, to wit:\n\n\"'I hereon declare on my Masonic honor, and in all truth and soberness, that I am a member in good standing of a Lodge of Masons recognized by the Grand Lodge of Ohio as regular, and that I am not a member of any organization or society which has been declared by the Grand Lodge of Ohio to be bogus, irregular, illegitimate, or un-masonic.'\n\n\"And any visitor failing to make such declaration must be denied admission to any Lodge room.\n\n\"It should be the imperative duty of every loyal Mason throughout the state to discountenance these impostors upon every occasion.\n\nMASON AT SIGHT\n\nGeneral Asa S. Bushnell, of Springfield, though not a member of the order, was one of the most enthusiastic and liberal contributors and workers in the cause of the Masonic Home; and at the earnest request of the members of the craft in Springfield and elsewhere, on the evening of October 18, A. D. 1892, the Grand Master in due form made him a Mason at sight.\n\nRecommends that in view of the long and faithful services as Grand Secretary and his declining health, a salary be voted to Bro. John D. Caldwell.\n\nThe Grand Treasurer's report shows a balance in his hands of $22,331.85 general fund, and of $428.50 charity fund.\n\nCharters were issued for the following new Lodges:\n\nTrinity, No.556, at Bucyrus, Crawford County\n\nOmega, No.564, at Defiance, Defiance County\n\nNegley, No.565, at Negley, Columbiana County\n\nRoseville, No.566, at Roseville, Muskingum County\n\nLinwood, No.567, at Linwood, Hamilton County\n\nDispensation was granted for a new Lodge, viz: National, at Barberton, Summit County\n\nThe committee reported approving the decisions of the Grand Master, his action in regard to Bro. Whitehurst, that of the Senior Warden and Secretary of Brooklyn Lodge, and his edict with reference to clandestine Masonry, and the report was adopted by the Grand Lodge.\n\nThe Grand Master announced that the Grand Lodge would convene at 2 o'clock p. m. for the purpose of laying the corner stone of the Masonic Home with appropriate Masonic ceremonies.\n\nTHE OHIO MASONIC HOME\n\nPromptly at 2 o'clock p. m., Wednesday, October 19, A. D. 1892, pursuant to announcement, the Grand Lodge reassembled for the purpose of laying with appropriate ceremonies, and according to ancient usage, the corner stone of the Masonic Home.\n\nThe procession was formed at the public square in Springfield. The first division was composed of seventeen Commanderies of Knights Templars---with over fifteen hundred Sir Knights in line and thirteen bands; and the second division of forty-two Lodges, with over two thousand Master Masons in line and five bands; and a large number of carriages; and special trains were run at short intervals to convey visitors to the grounds.\n\nArriving at the grounds, the corner stone was laid according to ancient Masonic usage, and Bro. Barton Smith, R.·. W.·. Grand Orator, delivered an address. The full ceremonies of this important event will be found recorded on pages 56 to 70 of the printed proceedings of the Grand Lodge.\n\nA Lodge of Sorrow was held at the city hall on the evening of October 19, at which appropriate addresses were delivered on the lives and services of our late Senior Grand Warden, W. F. Baldwin; our late Grand Chaplain, Rev. Bro. L. F. VanCleve, and a tribute to the memory of the five hundred and forty-nine Master Masons of this jurisdiction, who had been summoned to the Celestial Lodge above during the past year.\n\nThe Committee on Necrology reported and the testimonials were approved and ordered printed in the proceedings.\n\nM.·. W.·. Bro. J Ross Robertson, Past Grand Master of Masons in Canada, was introduced, received and welcomed with Grand Honors, and escorted to a seat in the East.\n\nThe Board of Trustees of the Masonic Home made a detailed and very satisfactory report showing that there had been received:\n\nCash donation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $ 36,860.16\n\nSubscriptions unpaid . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 47,192.50\n\nValue of grounds (approximate) . . . . . . . . .20,000.00\n\nTotal . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .$104,052.66\n\nThat there had been expended so far . . . . . . 2,760.82\n\nLeaving a balance . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .$101,281.84\n\nand the trustees and the committee make a fraternal appeal to the Lodges and members to take an active interest in securing the balance of the funds necessary to complete and furnish the Home.\n\nThe Grand Master appointed M.·. W.·. Bros. L. Burdick and J. M. Stull trustees of the Masonic Home for the term ending December 31, 1894, and M.·. W.·. Bro. C. C. Kiefer, and R.·. W.·. Bro. J. H. Bromwell for the term ending December 31, 1895, which appointments were approved by the Grand Lodge.\n\nThe committee to whom was referred the part of the Grand Master's address relating to the Order of the Eastern Star reported and recommended the following to be added to Section 79 of the Code.\n\n\"Or organizations known and designated as Chapters of the Eastern Star, when composed entirely of Masons known to be loyal to the Grand Lodge and its Officers, and of the wives and daughters of such Masons, may, with the consent of the Grand Master and by unanimous consent of the members of all Masonic bodies occupying Masonic halls, be permitted to use such Masonic halls for festival and ceremonial purposes.\"\n\nThis amendment not receiving unanimous consent was laid over to the next Annual Communication for final action.\n\nThe committee to whom was referred the Dortion of the Grand Master's address relating to the Emeritus Grand Secretary R.·. W.·. Bro. John D. Caldwell, reported in favor of allowing him a salary of $500 a year during his natural life, which was adopted.\n\nBrother Allen Andrews was elected M.·. W.·. Grand Master; Bro. Carroll F. Clapp, R.·. W.·. Deputy Grand Master; Bro. William B. Melish, R.·. W.·. Senior Grand Warden; Bro. Barton Smith, R.·. W.·. Junior Grand Warden, and Bros. Charles Brown and J. H. Bromwell re-elected Grand Treasurer and Grand Secretary, respectively, and they and the appointive Grand Officers were duly installed.\n\nCleveland was selected as the place, and Wednesday, October 18, A. D. 1893, the time for holding the next Annual Communication of the Grand Lodge.\n\nBrother E. L. Lybarger called attention to the successful administration of M.·. W.·. Grand Master Bro. Levi C. Goodale, and moved that in testimony of the appreciation of the Grand Lodge of the business like management and zeal of Brother Goodale, a Past Grand Master's jewel be secured and presented to him; which was unanimously adopted.\n\nOn motion of Bro. Barton Smith the sum of one hundred dollars was donated to Trinity Lodge located at Bucyrus.\n\nThe report of the Committee on Foreign Correspondence, reviewing the proceedings of sixty-three Grand Lodges, and covering 298 pages, is printed in the proceedings.\n\nA good portrait of M.·. W.·. Grand Master Levi C. Goodale faces the title page of the proceedings.\n\nThe Committee on Masonic History, through its chairman, M.·. W.·. S. Stacker Williams, reported progress and asked further time which was, on motion, granted.\n\n1893 M.·. W.·. ALLEN ANDREWS, GRAND MASTER\n\nGrand Lodge convened in Case Hall, Cleveland, Wednesday, October 18, A. D. 1893, with Grand Master Allen Andrews, in the Chair, all the Grand Officers in their stations, and Past Grand Masters C. A. Woodward, R. C. Lemmon, Wm. M. Cunningham, C. C. Kiefer, S. S. Williams, L. Burdick, L. C. Goodale, J. M. Goodspeed; Past Deputy Grand Masters, C. M. Godfrey, W. J. Akers, J. L'H. Long, and Emeritus Grand Secretary John D. Caldwell present, and the representatives of 473 Lodges in attendance.\n\nThe Grand Master read his address congratulating the Grand Lodge on the universal, most cordial and fraternal relations existing with our sister Grand Lodges in America, and most of the Grand Lodges of foreign nations in the world.\n\nOn May 23, he visited the Grand Lodge of Indiana at its annual session, and was most cordially received and welcomed, and was impressed with the zeal, earnestness, and business-like manner characterizing the proceedings.\n\nHe, with Bros. R. C. Lemmon, B. D. Babcock, and S. S. Williams, as representatives of this Grand Lodge, attended the Masonic Congress held at the Masonic Temple, Chicago, Illinois, August 14, 1893, and participated in the proceedings. Twenty-three Grand Lodges were represented, including Manitoba and two from Canada \"The Congress was a remarkable gathering of eminent Masons, the largest of its kind ever held in the history of our Fraternity. It had no power or inclination to organize or suggest a General Grand Lodge, for such a body is not desired by Ancient Craft Masonry. It had no power to legislate for the Grand Lodges, or even to recommend conclusions to them.\" However, the representatives discussed a number of important questions and formulated conclusions for the use and information of the craft--among which the following are of interest:\n\nSOVEREIGNLY OF GRAND LODGES\n\n\"The conclusion of the Congress is that a Grand Lodge duly organized in a state or other autonomous territory, is rightfully possessed of absolute sovereignty therein.\"\n\nTHE PREROGATIVE OF GRAND MASTERS\n\n\"That the dispensing power recognized in the old regulations as residing in the person and office of the Grand Master, has been so generally exercised by that officer, from the organization of Masonry on the Grand Lodge system down to the present time, that its existence can not be successfully denied. But that there are no dispensing powers so residing that may not be limited or wholly denied by the Grand Lodge, save such as inhere in that office under the sanction of the ancient landmarks.\"\n\nTHE CREED OF A MASON\n\n\"An unequivocal belief and trust in God is the fundamental principle which characterizes Masonry as defined by the Charges of a Freemason, and without which the institution can not be identified as Masonry.\"\n\nNON-AFFILIATES\n\n\"That every Mason ought to be a member of some regular Lodge, attend its meetings, and share its burdens.\"\n\nPHYSICAL QUALIFICATIONS\n\n\"That absolute competency to conform literally to all the requirements of the ceremonies of the several degrees of Ancient Craft Masonry, fulfills the requirements of physical perfection in a candidate for the privileges of Freemasonry, as set forth in the ancient charges.\"\n\nThe proceedings of this Masonic Congress were printed in pamphlet form and generally distributed, and furnishes much valuable information on various subjects of interest to the craft.\n\nBrother Monroe C. Crawford, Grand Master of Illinois, was President; Bro. J. L. Powers of Mississippi, Secretary, and Bro. S. Stacker Williams of Ohio, one of the Vice-Presidents.\n\nThe Grand Master answered a large number of questions relating to Masonic law and jurisprudence, and reports fifteen decisions which he thought ought to pass the scrutiny of the Jurisprudence Committee, the last of which gives a history and construction of the legislation of the Grand Lodge on the subject of intoxicating liquors; and decides that since the passage of what is known as the VanCleve resolution, making it a Masonic offense to engage in the traffic of intoxicating liquors to be drank where sold, it is the law of Masonry in this state, that to traffic in intoxicating liquors to be drank on the premises, or for purposes other than medicinal and mechanical uses, is a Masonic offense and any Brother violating this rule is guilty of un-masonic conduct, and is a proper subject for Masonic discipline; which decisions were referred to the Committee on Masonic Jurisprudence and on their report the Grand Lodge approved all of said decisions.\n\nCLANDESTINE MASONRY\n\nOn this subject the Grand Master reports the efforts of the clandestine so-called Grand Lodge, and the five subordinate Lodges and their members to gain a footing in this state, and their reckless attempts to deceive and induce persons to join their illegitimate bodies, and among other things says:\n\n\"The position taken by the Fraternity in Ohio and the measures adopted to suppress clandestine organizations claiming to be Masonic, were wise and effective. * * *\n\n\"The Cerneau bodies have melted away, and, with perhaps a single exception, have become extinct. The clandestine and illegal Grand Lodge which pretended to organize at Worthington, in 1891, according to best information, started five unlawful Subordinate Lodges, one each at Worthington, Coshocton and Bucyrus, and two at Columbus. These Lodges are aimless, lifeless and fruitless, except the two at Columbus, styled Franklin and Columbian, which have a membership, and continue to hold meetings. They solicit candidates and accept as members persons rejected by regular Lodges, and persons having but one eye, one arm, one leg, or other physical or moral imperfections, disqualifying them from membership in regular Lodges. Attempts were made to establish clandestine Lodges elsewhere in the state, but were frustrated by diligent Brethren who made known the character of these illegal organizations. The method is to make up a class of men desirous of Masonry, and pretend to them that they are about to organize a new Lodge, and that all who join in the beginning can obtain the degrees for $10.00.\n\n\"The attempt to organize a rebellion against this Grand Lodge, and plant clandestine bodies in this state, has not only failed of recognition, but has encountered the just condemnation of all the Grand Lodges in the world in fraternal correspondence with us. This is a source of satisfaction to us, and a new guarantee of the perpetuity of our institutions.\"\n\nAbout forty of the members of Franklin and Columbian Lodges requested a conference with the Grand Master and proposed to renounce and dissolve these clandestine bodies, claiming to have been deceived into joining what they believed to be regular Lodges, and requesting him to, in some way, heal them, and organize them into a lawful Lodge; but the Grand Master informed them he had no power to heal them in that manner, and their proper course was to renounce and withdraw from their present affiliation, and apply regularly for admission to a lawful Lodge, which a number of them did.\n\nThere has been little change in the litigation against the Grand Lodge by the Cerneaus. They have been beaten in every trial, and have abandoned all their cases except those in Columbus and Cleveland. The latter has not yet been brought to trial. In the two cases in Columbus they were beaten in both the Common Pleas and Circuit Courts, and have abandoned one case and taken the other to the Supreme Court, where it is now pending.\n\nThe courts have held in all these cases, that the controversy is not a subject matter of civil jurisprudence, to be decided in secular courts, but that it is a Masonic question, to be settled by the authorities of our Order, and that the civil courts of the land have no power to interfere, the very thing we have contended for, and the decision we desire.\n\nSince this case has been pending in the Supreme Court, eight of the plaintiffs, about one-fourth of the whole number, who were formerly members in good standing in Goodale Lodge No.372, expressed a desire to renounce Cerneauism and clandestine Masonry, and to be restored to their former place in the Lodge, but the Grand Master held that they must first withdraw from the law suit against the Grand Lodge, that we could not receive any one who would greet us with one hand, and carry on a warfare against us with the other, and on June 23, 1893, by leave of court these eight withdrew as plaintiffs from the case and four more have moved for leave to withdraw, and still others desire to withdraw and renounce Cerneauism.\n\nThe Grand Master arrested the charter of Paulding Lodge No.502, and the effects were forwarded to the Grand Secretary, on account of dissension among its members engendered by four or five brethren who, for some unknown reason, had for the past two years acted together to destroy the harmony and prosperity of the Lodge, and his action was unanimously approved by the Grand Lodge.\n\nThe Grand Master constituted the following chartered at the last session of the Grand Lodge:\n\nNovember 12, 1892, Roseville No.566, at Roseville, Muskingum County; November 26, 1892, Omega No.564, at Defiance, Defiance County; and issued special proxies to the following Brothers who constituted the following Lodges: December 8, 1892, No.565, at Negley, by Bro. L. L. Truesdale; 10, 1892, Trinity No.556, at Bucyrus, John Blyth; Linwood No.567, at Linwood, Hamilton County, by Bro. L. C. Goodale.\n\nThe Grand Master dedicated the following Masonic buildings:\n\nFebruary 13, 1893, Hall of York Lodge 563 at Columbus; June 27, 1893, Hall of Racine Lodge 461 at Racine; October 4, 1893, Masonic Temple at Mansfield.\n\nAnd the following were dedicated by proxy:\n\nFebruary 18, 1893, Hall of Ely Lodge 424 by Bro. A. E. Merrill; May 5, 1893, Hall of Tuscan Lodge 342 by Bro. C. E. Haman.\n\nOn January 18, 1893, at the meeting of McMillan Lodge No.141, at Cincinnati, the Past Grand Master's jewel voted to Past Grand Master Levi C.

One of these visits was to a joint meeting held by American Union Lodge No.1 and Harmar Lodge No.390, at Marietta, July 3, 1893, and he speaks in the highest terms of the cordial fraternal reception and welcome accorded him at this city where the fires were first lighted on the Masonic Altar in the great Northwestern Territory and says:\n\n\"American Union Lodge No.1 has in its possession very many old and valuable books and records that I believe this Grand Lodge should have copied and the copies placed in the hands of some competent historian, in order that the material now lying unused might be properly arranged for future reference,\" a valuable and timely suggestion, but unfortunately, like many others on the same subject, was passed by unheeded and the golden opportunity to save for the good of the Order many valuable facts and records that would be of inestimable value to the craft, now and in the future, has been lost.\n\nReports nineteen decisions rendered on subjects of general interest; which were referred to the Jurisprudence Committee, by them approved and recommended to be published and digested in the new Code now being printed, which was adopted.\n\nReports the Code Revision completed, highly commends the committee, recommends that the Monitor, Forms and Ceremonies, Burial Service and a complete index be added, and says: \"The entire work when completed will certainly be the most accurate and perfect Code ever published, and will be of untold value fo the craft.

Deputy Grand Master, the duty of procuring and presenting the Past Grand Master's jewel voted at the last session to M.·. W.·. Past Grand Master Allen Andrews, which duty was promptly performed.\n\nReports the kindest fraternal relations with all sister and foreign Grand Lodges with whom we have held intercourse, and recognized as legitimate, and that the Grand Master of Tennessee had written him asking if he knew any reason why the former fraternal relations existing between Ohio and Tennessee should not be restored, to which he replied he would cheerfully endorse any request made to that end, which resulted in an amicable understanding. This was ratified by the Grand Lodge, and the old fraternal relations restored.\n\nFour Lodges lost their rooms and property by fire during the past year, viz.: Felicity No.102, located at Felicity, Clermont County; Mount Olive No.148, located at Chester Hill, Morgan County; Bartlett No.293, located at Bartlett, Washington County; and Blanchester No.191, located at Blanchester, Clinton County.\n\nHighly commends the report of the Foreign Correspondence Committee, which receives the highest compliments from all other jurisdictions, and regrets that every Master Mason in Ohio does not have the opportunity to read the reports prepared by Past Grand Master W. M. Cunningham, who has for forty consecutive years been in attendance at the Annual Communications of this Grand Lodge.\n\nCongratulates the Grand Lodge on the practical completion of the main building at the Masonic Home, and that the Home is to be dedicated by the Grand Lodge today---\"the finest structure that has ever been erected in any Grand Jurisdiction by the craft for a similar purpose.\"\n\nHe adds: \"It is being urged by some that when the Home is completed it should be turned over to the Blue Lodges to control and provide for. I hope that you will never consent to nor accept of such a trust. The present plan of control has worked most admirably, having every legitimate and recognized Masonic body of the state equal co-workers in this great cause of brotherly love. * * *\n\n\"The entire system from the Entered Apprentice to that of the Thirty-Third and last Degree, should he contributors to this great and noble enterprise.\"\n\nCalls attention to the Order of the Eastern Star and the fact that he has granted his consent for Lodge rooms to be occupied by Chapters of that order when ever the terms of the resolution of 1893 were complied with, the conditions of said resolution, however making it almost prohibitory. He quotes from letters received from the Worthy Grand Matron of the Order in which she expresses the highest regard for and appreciation of the favors extended by the Grand Lodge and on behalf of the Grand Chapter and its fifty-three Chapters with over three thousand member tenders their assistance in building and furnishing the Masonic Home to the full extent of their ability, and the Grand Master recommends that this spirit of charity and benevolence should be met by a modification of the present rule and all that should be required is a majority vote of the Lodge and the consent of the Grand Master.\n\nRecommends that the rules be amended so as require an examination as to the proficiency of the candidate in the M. M. Degree; that the annual dues be increased, and that the District Lecturer's expenses be paid by the Grand Lodge, stating that the entire expenses of all the District Lecturers making an inspection of every Lodge in the state during the past year amounted to the sum of $1,323.38, or an average of $2.65 to each Lodge.\n\nThe Committee on Code Revision made its report attaching a copy of the revision, and its recommendation as to Decisions, By-Laws, Monitor, Forms, Ceremonials, Burial Service, Index, etc., which was referred to a Joint Committee composed of the Committees of Jurisprudence, Grievance, Charters and Dispensations sitting jointly, which Joint Committee reported recommending the Code as prepared by the committee including the By-Laws, Rules, Resolutions, etc., be adopted as the laws and regulations of this Grand Lodge, and the Subordinate Lodges under its jurisdiction, and that said committee prepare a suitable index to the whole and have three thousand copies printed and bound and placed in the hands of the Grand Secretary for distribution; which was unanimously adopted.\n\nM.·. W.·. Bro. R. C.

J. H. Bromwell, M. E. Grand High Priest of the Grand Chapter of Ohio, took the opportunity to present Brother Vinal an elegant Past Grand High Priest's jewel, which had been ordered to be prepared and given to him by the Grand Chapter of Ohio. The venerable Brother made suitable response in eloquent and touching terms.\n\nThe reports of E. Townley, Assistant Grand Treasurer, who served until the appointment of Bro. Ralph R. Rickly, and of Grand Treasurer Ralph R. Rickly were submitted and referred to the Committee Accounts, audited and found correct, the account of Bro. Ralph R. Rickly showing a balance in his hands October 15, 1895, of $26,186.32 and $240.00 accrued interest credited to the Grand Lodge, making a total of $26,426.32.\n\nThe Grand Secretary submitted his report containing valuable statistics of the membership gains and losses, and general information for the craft, including the following table of cash balances in the hands of the Grand Treasurer for the past seven years, as follows:\n\nYear . . . . . Bal. on Hand . . . . . Net Gain . . . . .

Stull, President of the Ohio Masonic Home, presented to the M.·. W.·. Grand Lodge a gavel made of wood cut from an olive tree which grew in Jerusalem, and which he had been commissioned, by the Master of the Lodge of Masons meeting in Jerusalem, to convey, with expressions of fraternal greeting to the Grand Lodge of Ohio. The M.·. W.·. Grand Master accepted the gavel with appropriate response, and used it for the remainder of the session.\n\nM.·. W.·. Bro. James W. Staton, Past Grand Master of Kentucky, being present, was formally introduced, welcomed and invited to a seat in the Fast, and responded in an appropriate address,\n\nCharters were granted to the following Lodges\n\nYondota, No.572, at Toledo, Lucas County\n\nCarthage, No.573, at Carthage, Hamilton County\n\nNew Burlington, No.574, at New Burlington, Greene County\n\nGibsonburg, No.575, at Gibsonburg, Sandusky County\n\nNorwood, No.576, at Norwood, Hamilton County\n\nBoth the Grand Master and the Committee on Charters and Dispensations heartily commend the work done by Yondota Lodge No.572, now numbering one hundred and four members, having during the ten months of its existence U. D. initiated fifty-nine and conferred the M. M. degree on fifty-five candidates, conferred in all one hundred and sixty-nine degrees, receiving therefor in fees, $2,535.00.\n\nDuplicate charters were issued to J. B. Covert Lodge No.437, at Withamsville; Blanchester Lodge No.191, at Blanchester, and Monitor Lodge No.445 at Delhi, in lien of the original charters destroyed by fire.\n\nThe action of the Grand Master in arresting charters of Central Lodge No.279, at Calais, a Kennonsburg Lodge No.480, and his action in matter of restoration of fraternal relations with Grand Lodge of Tennessee were approved.\n\nThe Committee on Masonic Jurisprudence report and recommended the adoption of the following resolutions:\n\n\"Resolved, That the Worshipful Master of each and every Lodge shall require every newly obligated Master Mason to acquire the Examination Lecture of the Master's Degree, and certify that this has be done on the annual returns of his Lodge;\" * * * which was unanimously adopted.\n\n\"Resolved, That so much of the Grand Master's address as refers to the Order of the Eastern Star be approved, and that Rule 79 of the Code be amended by striking out from the last paragraph of said rule in line five the word 'unanimous,' and in line six, the word 'all.' The paragraph will then read as follows;\n\n\"Provided, however, that any organization know and designated as a Chapter of the Eastern Star, when composed entirely of Masons under obedience to the Grand Lodge, and of the wives, daughters and families of such Masons, may, with the consent of the Grand Master, and the consent of the Masonic bodies jointly occupying such Masonic Halls, be permitted to use such Masonic Halls for festival and ceremonial purposes;\" which resolution was unanimously adopted.\n\nThe Committee on Necrology reported proper testimonials to our departed Brothers and recommended that the testimonials prepared by M.·. W.·. Bro. Wm. B. Melish and R.·. W.·. Bro. J. L'H. Long, on the lives and characters of our lamented Brothers Charles Brown and Charles M. Godfrey be printed in the proceedings; which was adopted.\n\nThe committee on the petition of H. C. Tipton for reinstatement to good standing in the Order reported in favor of such restoration and the same was adopted. The Grievance Committee reported in favor of reinstating Isadore Jacobs to good standing, which was adopted.\n\nWhen the ballots were cast for Grand Master it appeared that M.·. W.·. Carroll F. Clapp had received almost the unanimous vote of the Grand Lodge, but he stated that while the expression in his favor was most gratifying and very highly appreciated by him, he had long been of the opinion that in a Grand Jurisdiction like Ohio a Grand Master should retire at the end of one term, and therefore he respectfully declined a re-election and requested the Grand Lodge to\n\nprepare their ballots for some other person to serve them as Grand Master.\n\nThe second ballot resulted in the selection of Bro. William B. Melish as M.·. W.·. Grand Master, and the following Brothers were elected to fill the other elective stations:\n\nBrother Barton Smith of Toledo, R.·. W.·. Deputy Grand Master; Bro.

M., of Cincinnati Lodge No.133, arose in his place and stated that this day was the fiftieth anniversary of the constitution of his Lodge under its charter, and that, for the purpose of properly celebrating this auspicious event, and to advance the great Masonic charity which the Grand Lodge had dedicated on the day previous, he was instructed by Cincinnati Lodge No.133 to announce a donation of $1,000 to the Ohio Masonic Home, of which not to exceed $250.00 was to be used in properly furnishing a suitable room, to be selected by the representatives of said Lodge.\n\nThis generous gift met with hearty applause on the part of the members of the Grand Lodge.\n\nBrother Edward F. Townley, to whom $50.00 had been voted for his services as Assistant Grand Treasurer, announced that he donated the amount so appropriated to the Ohio Masonic Home, which was received with renewed applause.\n\nThe Committee on Charity reported in favor of the Grand Lodge donating the sum of $10,000 to the Ohio Masonic Home, which report and recommendation were adopted.\n\nA resolution instructing the Grand Secretary to furnish the library at the Masonic Home a complete set of the proceedings of this Grand Lodge, and as many of the proceedings of other Grand Jurisdictions IS he can procure was adopted.\n\nThe amendment to By-Law 16 of this Grand Lodge, offered at last session and laid over to this, was taken up and adopted as follows:\n\n\"Every Subordinate Lodge shall pay annually to the Grand Lodge, at the stated meetings thereof, the following Grand Dues, to wit: For each initiation, the sum of two dollars; and for each member, the gum of fifty cents, fifteen cents of which shall each year be set apart and appropriately by the Grand Lodge to the use of the Ohio Masonic Home.\"\n\nThe general report of the Foreign Correspondence Committee, covering 304 pages and reviewing the proceedings of sixty-two English speaking, and ten non-English speaking Grand Lodges is printed in the proceedings (pages 125 to 429) and contains a large number of valuable statistical tables and general information as to Masonry throughout the world that can not be found in any other publication.\n\nAll the Grand Officers present were installed, and those absent were ordered installed by their respective Lodges.\n\nDEDICATION OF THE MASONIC HOME\n\nOn the afternoon of the first day of the session Wednesday, October 23, A. D. 1895, the Grand Lodge, assisted by the Officers of all the Grand Bodies of Masonry in Ohio, many distinguished Masons from other states, thousands of Masons and citizens, dedicated the Masonic Home to the uses of pure Masonic charity, the ritual and exercises having been prepare by the M.·. W.·. Grand Master; and the following condensed account of the proceedings, and the inception and carrying out the project, is here inserted for the information of the craft:\n\nThe afternoon of October 23, 1895, was an almost perfect autumn day in the city of Springfield, O. The air in the early morning was crisp and fresh but warmed up in the bright sunshine of midday, until earth and sky took on all the loveliness of a day in Indian summer.\n\nFrom early morning the trains centering in the city of Springfield had been bringing in Commanderies and Lodges, with their showy uniforms and white aprons and their gayly-decorated bands, while hundreds of ladies, who had accompanied the visitors, lent the charm of their presence to beautify and enliven the thronged streets of the busy little city. The citizens, too, and their neighbors from the surrounding country, made this a memorable holiday, and filled the public places of the city with an ever-increasing crowd. The workshops were closed, the houses were gayly decorated, and Springfield put on its gala clothes for the most important celebration it had ever held.\n\nAt 1 o'clock in the afternoon the procession was former, and moved at 1:15 from the Public Square in Springfield in the following order:\n\nS. J. LAFFERTY, Grand Marshal\n\nCAPTAIN AM. WINGER, Chief of Staff\n\nW. F. JOSEPH, N. BATES, STEPHEN P. SANDS, and T. F. LOTT, Aides.\n\nThen followed detachments of the various Cornmanderies and their bands, acting as escort to the Grand Lodge and the Subordinate Lodges.\n\nFollowing these came open carriages containing the Grand Officers of the Grand Council, Royal and Slelect Masters, the Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons, and the Masonic Home Trustees.\n\nThese, in their turn, were succeeded by a long procession of Master Masons, and finally by the Grand Officers of the Grand Lodge in carriages. The members of the Blue Lodge were under the direction of R.·. W.·. Bro. F. C. Gulliford, Grand Marshal of the Grand Lodge, while Comp. S. B. Markland acted in the same capacity for the Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons.\n\nAfter moving upon several of the principal streets in the city of Springfield, the procession marched, by way of the old National Road, to the Home Grounds, and was massed as a solid body in front of the Grand Stand, which had been erected at the entrance to the Masonic Home building.\n\nUpon the immense porch, which was to serve as a stage, assembled the principal officers of each of the Grand Bodies, the members of the Board of Trustees of the Home, and a large number of ladies who had accompanied them, while the roof of the porch, and the stands which had been erected at either end, contained not less than a thousand spectators.\n\nAt 3 o'clock the exercises were opened with the Overture \"Frisch, Frei, Stark, Treu,\" from Keisler, rendered by the Warren Commandery Band. This was followed by the report of the Secretary of the Home, Bro. J. H. Bromwell, to the Trustees, as follows:\n\nREPORT OF THE SECRETARY OHIO MASONIC HOME\n\nTo the Trustees of the Ohio Masonic Home:\n\nBRETHREN--I submit the following as a brief report on the inception, progress, and completion of the structure which we today dedicate to the relief of distressed Masons, their widows and orphans.\n\nPRELIMINARY\n\nAt the session of the Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons of the State of Ohio, held at Springfield, October 3, 1888, the M. E. Grand High Priest, Comp. W. B. Hulman, called attention to the fact that there existed no provisions for the care, maintenance, and comfort of worthy, infirm, and aged Master Masons, or for the care and protection of Masonic widows and orphans under the direction and control of the Grand Bodies of Ohio. He recommended the purchase of from fifty to one hundred acres and the construction thereon of a Masonic Home, and suggested that for the proper consideration and presentation of the matter to the various Grand Bodies, committees of three from each should be appointed to confer together and recommend suitable action to the Grand Bodies which they represented.\n\nThis portion of the Grand High Priest's address was referred to a Committee on Charity, consisting of Companions J. H. Bromwell, J. W. Underhill, and C. C. Park, who recommended the appointment of committees as suggested by the Grand High Priest Hillman, and their recommendation was duly adopted by the Grand Chapter; and the successor of Comp. Hillman, M. E. Grand High Priest J. W. Iredell, Jr., appointed as the committee to represent the Grand Chapter, Comps. W. B. Hillman, W. W. Savage, and J. H. Bromwell.\n\nAt the session of the Grand Lodge of Ohio, held October 24, 1888, a similar action was taken, and the then Grand Master Leander Burdick appointed as the committee from the Grand Lodge, Bros. J. W. Iredell, Jr., Henry Perkins, and C. C. Kiefer.\n\nSimilar action was also taken by the Grand Commandery Knights Templars of Ohio, at its Annual Conclave held August 14, 1889, and Sir Samuel F. Forbes, Sir G. B. Harman, and Sir Edwin Morrell were appointed as a committee.\n\nAt the session of the Grand Council Royal and Select Masters, held September 10, 1889, Illustrious Comps. Levi C. Goodale, John W. Chamberlin, and Timothy S. Matthews were appointed to represent that body.\n\nThis joint committee from the various Grand Bodies met in the office of the Grand Secretary, Cincinnati, Ohio, July 20, 1889, and prepared a lengthy report, outlining briefly what other Grand Jurisdictions had done in the way of Masonic Homes, making suggestions as to the manner of raising funds, discussing the desirability of the different kinds of Homes, making some suggestions as to location and probable cost; and this report was submitted to the various Grand Bodies, and was adopted by them at their next succeeding Annual Session. The same joint committee were, by the various Grand Bodies, including the Council of Deliberation of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, authorized to procure articles of incorporation for the Ohio Masonic Home, which they accordingly did on the 25th day of February, 1890, and adopted a Constitution which provided, among other things, for the appointment of six Trustees from the Grand Lodge, three each from the Grand Chapter and Grand Commandery, one from the Grand Council, and two from the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite.\n\nPERMANENT ORGANIZATION\n\nThe first Board of Trustees appointed under this Constitution consisted of the following members:\n\nFrom the Grand Lodge - Bros.

Akers; Second Vice-President, Leander Burdick; Third Vice-President, Edwin Momrell; Secretary, J. H. Bromwell; Treasurer, J. W. Chamberlin.\n\nThe first subscriptions were made by members of the Board of Trustees, as follows: Leander Burdick, $500; G. B. Harman, $100; L. C. Goodale, $100; J. W. Iredell, Jr., $100; John M. Stull, $100; W. B. Melish, $100.\n\nPROPOSITIONS FOR LOCATION\n\nPropositions were received from various localities for the location of the Home, which finally narrowed down to the consideration of four points; viz., Tiffin, Columbus, Springfield, and Newark. The location offered by Springfield, consisting of something over one hundred and fifty acres, was finally selected, and the building which we dedicate today was placed in process of construction by the selection of Bro. John Eisenman as architect.\n\nFINANCIAL\n\nThe total amount of subscriptions received up to the present time from various sources, and the total expenditures, are as follows:\n\nReceipts from Lodges . . . . . .$38,537.63\n\n\" \" Chapters . . . . . . . . . . . . . 29,546.75\n\n\" \" Councils . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,972.21\n\n\" \" Commanderies . . . . . . . . . 9,814.99\n\n\" \" A. and A.

STULL, PRESIDENT OF THE HOME\n\nTo the Masons and Masonic Bodies here present:\n\nBROTHERS  It is fitting that we meet here today in the city of Springfield to commemorate the completion of this beautiful structure, having its origin in one of the noblest sentiments that can inspire human action-love for our fellows-and now about to be dedicated to one of the holiest purposes-human charity-and, in so doing, to give a very brief account of the origin, progress, and completion of the work.\n\nIn the year A. D. 1888, the Annual Convocation of the Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons was held in this city. Comp. William B. Hillman, who was then Most Excellent Grand High Priest, in his address to the Companions there assembled, introduced the subject of conferring with the other Grand Bodies of Masonry in relation to the establishment of a Masonic Home in the State of Ohio; and after referring to the benevolent and charitable institutions of the state  the good they were doing  and speaking of the Masonic Homes in other states, closed by saying, \"Are their obligations and necessities greater than ours ?\" and added: \"I would therefore respectfully suggest to this Grand Chapter that they appoint a committee of three to confer with a like committee to be hereafter appointed by the Grand Lodge and the Grand Commandery (should these bodies concur), to agree upon the amount to be collected, and arrange other details to accomplish this most noble charity.\" At the same session the Committee on Charities reported that it most heartily indorsed the language of the Grand High Priest, and was in full accord and sympathy with him upon the subject of establishing a Masonic Home in the state of Ohio for the relief of worthy aged and infirm Masons and their families.\n\nIt is remarkable that, in 1889, just six years ago today, the Grand Lodge passed its resolution indorsing this great movement. From that time, moved by the inspiration of Divine Providence and love of mankind, the work began to assume shape. All the other Grand Bodies became interested, fell into line, and joined the noble enterprise. Immediate action was taken to become incorporated under the laws of the state of Ohio, and to be known as \"The Ohio Masonic Home.\" The incorporation was perfected; Constitution and By-Laws formulated and adopted; trustees appointed and qualified, and executive officers chosen.\n\nMoney was needed and subscriptions called for, one Brother after another, and Masonic body after Masonic body, came royally to its support; and so the work of raising money has gone on until the grand sum of $125,101.95 has been raised and paid into the treasury of the Home. While all the contributions have been generous, I wish to make especial mention of the Grand Chapter of Royal Arch Masons for its large and magnificent donations, aggregating the total sum of $29,546.75. The several Grand Bodies enlisted in the building of the Home are: The Grand Lodge, the Grand Council, the Grand Chapter, the Grand Commandery, and the Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite. Each of these bodies is represented by Trustees selected from their number-fifteen in all.\n\nThe next duty of the Trustees was to select a site upon which to erect a suitable building. Different cities were visited in search of a desirable place. After impartially considering the various locations, their surroundings and advantages, the Trustees decided to take the one where we now are. The site  including 153 acres of land, and a contribution of $11,000 in money  was the grand offering of the city of Springfield.\n\nThis magnificent Home is before you for inspection. It is beautifully located. It has all the mode conveniences, and when entirely completed will rank among the grand and imposing structures of the state. The Masons of Ohio may justly be proud of it. The architect has spared no pains or expense to give us a model structure; and under the tasteful and painstaking direction of the Building Committee, the work has progressed without friction, moving along under skilled workmen from its foundation to its dome.\n\nThere are one hundred rooms, ninety-three of which are living rooms, all finished save Memorial Hall. Much work is needed to be done outside to make the surroundings attractive and homelike. But if we shall be favored with the continued donations and help of our Masonic Brothers of Ohio, we expect by April 1, 1896, to have every room furnished, and the Home and its surroundings in perfect order, ready to receive its inmates and begin its noble work of caring for those less fortunate than ourselves.\n\nSeveral Lodges have already advised the Trustees of their desire to furnish rooms. Two or three Chapters of the Eastern Star are taking steps to the same end, and many more will doubtless do so. Let the good work go on. Let every Lodge and every other Masonic Body in the state of Ohio, including the Eastern Star, furnish one room, or assist in doing so, and give notice to the Assistant Secretary, Bro. John W. Parsons, before leaving Springfield, of its intention so to do. And for all this work our Father, God, will reward you; and, in His name and in love for our own, I make this appeal, knowing,\n\n\"If thy burden is hard and heavy,\n\nIf thy steps drag wearily,\n\nHelp to bear thy Brother's burden;\n\nGod will bear both it and thee.\"\n\nAnd now, as we turn over the results of our labors to the Grand Master of the State, to be Masonically dedicated to the holy purpose for which it is intended, and remembering that there still \"abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity,\" in the name of that heavenly virtue, we invoke upon this Home the beneficent blessing of the Supreme Master and Architect of the Universe, that it may be perpetual, an honor to the craft, and a refuge and safe Home for worthy and distressed Masons and their families.\n\nMost Worshipful Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons in Ohio! this Temple, which commands our attention today, was built with the generous offerings of Masons, Lodges, Councils, Chapters, Commanderies, and Ancient Accepted Scottish Rite Bodies throughout the state of Ohio. Its inception had its origin in love for the indigent of the craft, their widows and orphans. The Home is nearly completed, and will soon be ready for the uses for which it was designed.\n\nAnd now, Most Worshipful Grand Master! at the special request of the Board of Trustees of the Ohio Masonic Home, I have the honor to ask you in their behalf, and in the behalf of the forty thousand Masons in Ohio, and the respective Grand Bodies of our noble Order, to dedicate and consecrate this Temple to the uses for which it was designed; namely, to the care of indigent Master Masons, their families, and the widows and orphans of deceased worthy Brothers throughout the state of Ohio. And we trust that, as the years roll on, Heaven will still, as in the past, uphold and guide the work, until the Order, wearing \"crowns of glory, and with palms of victory,\" will enter the Home where the \"weary shall ever find rest\" and Fraternity live on forever.\n\nThe Grand Architect, Bro. J. W. Iredell, of Cincinnati, who, as the first President of the Home, a afterwards as the Chairman of its Building Committee, has been most prominently identified with every detail of the work, then delivered to the Grand Master the implements of his office, which had been intrusted to him at the laying of the corner stone, informing the M.·. W.·. Grand Master that the duty then assigned to him had been performed, and the building stood completed; the following being his language:\n\nTo the M.·. W.·. Grand Master:\n\nHaving been intrusted with the responsible duty of supervising the constructing of this edifice, and the management of the workmen employed in its erection, and having, according to the best of my ability discharged the duties with which I was intrusted, I now surrender the implements committed to my care when the foundation of this building was laid. I trust that my exertions and the labors of the craft may meet with your approbation, and the approval of the M.·. W.·. Grand Lodge.\n\nThe M.·. W.·. Grand Master, in response to the address of the President, and of the Grand Architect said:\n\nMR. PRESIDENT  In obedience to your request as President of the Trustees of the Ohio Masonic Home I have caused the Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons of the state of Ohio to here assemble. This I have done, that we may dedicate and consecrate, according to ancient forms and ceremonies, this magnificent building and these spacious grounds to the purposes and uses intended  a Home for indigent Masons, their wives, children, widows, and orphans.\n\nTo feed the hungry, clothe the naked, comfort the sorrowing, and bind up the wounds of the afflicted, are among the principles inculcated and enjoined upon us as Free Masons. In building this Home you have demonstrated the Mason's unfaltering belief in the principles of Brotherly Love, relief and Truth.\n\nThe foundations of this Home have been laid broad and deep in the hearts of the members of our great Brotherhood. You have erected here a structure which is the pride of the craft of this city and of our great Commonwealth. The Masons of Ohio will, on account of their common interest in this great undertaking, be more closely cemented together than ever before; for this great work of charity has become with them a labor of love.\n\nThe same generous impulses that prompted them to build this Home, will, I trust, in the future see that it is properly provided for and maintained. The call of want, the wail of sorrow, and the cry of the orphan will not go unheeded.\n\nSome states have erected great and costly Masonic Temples; but they do not dry the tears of our Brothers' widows and orphans; they do not furnish a home for the friendless.\n\nYou are not asking me to dedicate an asylum or an almshouse, but a Home; and may it ever furnish to those for whom it is intended all the sacred associations that the name implies!\n\nIn this Home grief will be alleviated, the unfortunate comforted, the helpless strengthened, young lives saved from crime and shame, and fitted for usefulness.\n\nThis Home will be the crowning glory of Masonry in Ohio. May we therefore annually celebrate the day that gave it birth and dedication!\n\nAnd now, Mr. President, in the name of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Ohio, and in the name of the forty thousand true and valiant Masons of the Grand Jurisdiction, without regard to rank or grade, I receive this Home from you for the purposes you have indicated, and we will now proceed, according to our ancient forms and ceremonies, to dedicate and consecrate it to the benevolent uses for which it was ordained. May the Supreme Grand Architect of the Universe, the Mason's God, cause his blessing to rest upon it, and spread the work of charity and benevolence!\n\nThe Grand Marshal then proclaimed silence in the following words:\n\n\"In the name of the Grand Master of Masons the state of Ohio, I command all persons here assembled to preserve silence, and to observe due order and decorum during the ceremonies.\"\n\nThe Grand Chaplain then invoked Divine blessing after which the Sanctus from Gounod was rendered by the Temple Quartet, of Cleveland. The flowing responsive selections were then read by the Grand Chapla"
