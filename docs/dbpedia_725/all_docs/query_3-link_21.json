        "text": "Brethren building a strong fraternal network\n\nThe mission of the Valley of Chicago’s Lodge Ambassador network is to introduce brethren from the many Blue Lodges across Chicagoland (see complete list below) to fellow Masons whom they otherwise might not have an opportunity to meet through the inspiring, convenient and enjoyable Scottish Rite experience. Two Lodge Ambassadors may be designated for each Blue Lodge to assist brethren in joining the Scottish Rite.\n\nAlthough the Scottish Rite confers additional degrees with higher numbers and distinctive titles, there is no “higher” degree than that of Master Mason in all of Freemasonry, and Scottish Rite members comprise a vast network of active, dedicated Blue Lodge Masons interested in expanding the bonds of fellowship. These relationships between men of good character strengthen the fraternal chain and can last a lifetime.\n\nSponsoring candidates – a brotherly obligation\n\nA candidate may have his petition signed by any Scottish Rite Mason in Illinois that is in good standing. Sponsoring a candidate is an important responsibility, one which can have the most meaning when members of the candidate’s Blue Lodge share the Scottish Rite experience together. Of course, which brother he asks to sign his petition is the choice of the candidate\n\nAbove all, no candidate should ever have to miss a joining opportunity due to a delay in finding sponsors. If unable to locate sponsor(s) in time to participate in a Reunion or other joining opportunity (such as during the summer when many Blue Lodges go dark), a candidate may print a sponsor’s name on his petition and submit it. The Valley of Chicago will then seek to obtain the requisite signature(s) in a timely fashion.\n\nWhat are Lodge Ambassadors encouraged to do?\n\nWhile serving as a Scottish Rite representative to his Blue Lodge brethren, each Lodge Ambassador is encouraged to:\n\nKeep in touch with his Blue Lodge(s) and be willing to sponsor candidates who need petitions signed.\n\nStay informed about the Valley of Chicago by subscribing to Scottish Rite News and Echoes e-mails.\n\nWhenever convenient, attend Scottish Rite events including fraternal, charitable and social activities.\n\nSuggest the name of a reliable successor in the event he becomes unable to perform these functions.\n\nAn opportunity to share Scottish Rite Freemasonry\n\nIt is a privilege to represent the Scottish Rite at the Blue Lodge level, and Lodge Ambassadors may request support materials such as membership brochures, magazines or videos. Lodge Ambassadors demonstrating exemplary performance are eligible for special recognition including membership awards for sponsoring candidates who go on to become active Scottish Rite Masons.\n\nTo have a petition signed or to reach a Lodge Ambassador listed below for whom you do not have contact information, or to be designated a Lodge Ambassador for your Blue Lodge\n\n(especially if it is among those not yet formally assigned one), please contact the Valley of Chicago Cathedral, at 630-439-3400 or webmaster@scottishritechicago.org.\n\nNortheastern Area Lodges\n\n* Names marked with an asterisk below have been tentatively identified as prospective Lodge Ambassadors based on their Blue Lodge and Scottish Rite membership status. If your name is listed with an asterisk and you’d like to be designated a Lodge Ambassador or suggest another lodge brother you think might be interested, please contact the Valley of Chicago Cathedral."
