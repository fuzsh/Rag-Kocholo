De Hoyos has pointedly critiqued Mormons that rely on an “uncritical school” to “persuade members of the LDS Church [Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints] that Freemasonry has existed for thousands of years and that their Temple Endowment Ritual is an authentic restoration of ancient practices, rather than an unacknowledged ‘borrowing from Freemasonry.’”3 Similarly, two prominent British Masonic scholars concluded that Mormon historians refuse to address this topic because “Mormonism 1.

Mark C. Carnes has observed that: “The best history of the Mormon church, written by Mormons, skirts this issue. The authors refer to [ Joseph] Smith’s ‘purported use of the Masonic ceremony in Mormon temple ordinances’ and note that Mormons recognized that there were ‘similarities as well as differences’ in the rituals; there is no further elaboration.”5 But, as he noted, “Whether Smith stole the temple rites from Freemasonry, as the Masons claim, or received them as revelation from God is ultimately a question of faith,” but it “cannot be disputed ...that quasi-Masonic ritual figured prominently in the lives of most Mormon men.”6 Likewise, social historian Paul J. Rich concluded that: “Historians cannot afford to overlook the Masonic ingredient, which manifests itself in surprising ways” including the “pertinent case . . .of the world-wide Mormon movement,” which “has an enormous debt to Freemasonry.”7 Such criticisms provide a challenge to Mormon and non-Mormon historians to not only acknowledge the dynamic relationship between Freemasonry and Mormonism but to re-evaluate the implications of Smith’s mistaken belief, shared by many of his contemporaries, that Freemasonry had ancient origins and that it could trace it rituals back to Solomon’s ­Temple. This study will examine this dynamic relationship since the beginning of Mormonism until the present time. The scope of parallels is much broader than the strains of anti-Masonry in the Book of Mormon or the similarities that have been noted between Masonic and Mormon temple rituals. There are likenesses between Masonry’s Enochian legend and Smith’s “gold plate” narrative, the Royal Arch High Priesthood and Smith’s restoration of the High Priesthood, Masonry’s and Mormonism’s rites of washing and anointing, as well as Smith’s retranslation of existing scriptures and his translation of ancient papyri and similar subjects in Freemasonry. In order to provide a foundation for this discussion it is necessary to understand the rudiments of existing scholarship concerning the origins of Freemasonry in England, Ireland, and Scotland and its subsequent 4.

The legends of Freemasonry, which are premised on the claim of ancient origins, differ significantly from its historical origins (which are still not agreed on) but which have been traced to medieval working guilds. The energetic evolution of Masonic high degrees, which introduced elaborations on scriptural narratives, adds an additional layer of complexity to Freemasonry and its connection with Mormonism. The connection between Mormonism and Masonry began in New York and continued in Ohio, Missouri, Illinois, and Utah. Historian John L. Brooke has noted that eventually “Mormon commentary made the link with Freemasonry firm and inescapable.”8 Indeed, a catalogue of statements made by nineteenth-century LDS Church leaders demonstrates a solid belief that there was a connection between Masonry and Mormonism, particularly with respect to temple worship. In Nauvoo the connections were public and explicit as most of the Mormon hierarchy either became M ­ asons or realigned themselves with it for the first time in more than a decade. Mormon leaders taught that Solomon’s Temple was built “for the purpose of giving endowments” and had survived (in a degenerated form) in the rituals of Freemasonry. Masons accordingly practiced an “apostate endowment” just as sec­ tarians practiced “apostate religions” while Joseph Smith had restored the original ritual.9 Apostle Heber C. Kimball quoted Smith as teaching that the LDS Church had “true Masonry” and that the “Masonry of today is taken from the apostasy which took place in the days of Solomon and D ­ avid.”10 Smith’s new temple ritual in Nauvoo, which was a radical elaboration of the earlier Kirtland endowment ceremony, was designed to bestow light, knowledge, and spiritual powers on Smith’s inner circle and thereby enable them to eventually become exalted beings. It provided a synthesis of a number of eclectic and esoteric beliefs, such as baptism for the dead, access to the powers of heaven, the formulation of ways to bind those powers, and the creation of a highly ordered theocratic society. Smith’s organization of the Nauvoo Female Relief Society, which became connected with his expansive ideas concerning marriage, also contained a specter of Masonry. Smith attempted to teach the Mormon sisters to keep a secret through that society before he incorporated some of the 8. John L.

Even Brigham Young’s institutionalization and justification of a policy that prohibited blacks from holding priesthood powers and participating in Mormon temple rituals had parallels with American Masonic practices. The dynamic connection between Masonry and Mormonism continued after the LDS Church transferred its headquarters to Salt Lake City. Non-Mormon merchants and soldiers organized Masonic lodges in Utah Territory and resolutely barred Mormons (even those who were already Masons) from participating because the church taught plural marriage. After the Mormons abandoned plural marriage, Utah Masons, believing that Smith had purloined Masonic rituals, argued that Mormons consequently were still ineligible to become Masons. These developments took place during the same period when the Authentic School of Masonry was debunking the notion that Masonic rituals originated in antiquity. Thereafter, Mormon writers advanced revisionist theories concerning the origins of the endowment, which either denied or marginalized connections between Masonry and Mormonism. They may have believed that this approach promoted faith since it addressed the gap between Smith’s teachings and the Authentic School of Masonry concerning the antiquity of Masonic rituals. Thereafter, a new generation of church leaders (who had never been Masons) airbrushed the connection out of church history even though many of their predecessors who knew and admired Smith had recognized and acknowledged the connection. While most historians now acknowledge connections between Mormonism and Masonry, the current debate focuses on the significance and depth of these correspondences. Some historians contend that the goals and aspirations of Freemasonry and Mormonism were so radically different during the nineteenth century that any similarities in their rituals are superficial. While such arguments are faith-based and assume that the first Mormon was inspired, they discount the writings of early Mormon leaders and Masonic lecturers whose beliefs concerning the Craft contained many equivalents to both the spirit and form of Mormon beliefs and practices.\n\n1\n\nEuropean Freemasonry\n\nWhen Joseph Smith Jr. (1805–1844) established the Church of Christ in 1830, the Grand Lodge of London was still a relatively young organization. In 1717 four London lodges organized a grand lodge and during the next century the institution of Freemasonry experienced dramatic growth in England, on the Continent, and in America. During this same period Masons embellished their legends, which claimed that the institution of Freemasonry could be traced to Adam, Enoch, and Noah and that Masonic rituals were descended from those practiced in Solomon’s Temple. Masons also developed new “high degrees” that included the Master Masons Degree and the Royal Arch, which became core rituals. Despite the relative youth of the Grand Lodge, Masonic historians have acknowledged that the origins of the institution of Freemasonry remain “one of the most debated, and debatable, subjects in the whole realm of historical inquiry.” Frances Yates observed that “one has to distinguish between the legendary history of Freemasonry and the problem of when it actually began as an organized institution” and that “most books on Freemasonry confuse architecture in the Bible, legendary stories, the history of architecture in general, and the history of Freemasonry.”1\n\nOperative Masonry Some historians have concluded that modern Freemasonry can be traced to “the organization and practices, which have from time to time prevailed among medieval working masons.” Operative masons formed Catholic brotherhoods in England, Scotland, and Ireland that observed a simple admission ceremony (at least in Scotland and England), which included a Christian invocation, the recitation of rules and regulations (eventually 1. Frances A. Yates, The Rosicrucian Enlightenment (London: Routledge & Kegan Paul,\n\n1972), 209, 214.\n\n5\n\n6\n\nchapter 1\n\ncalled the Old Charges), as well as the administration of an oath sworn on the Bible to obey the rules and regulations and to be faithful to the monarch and the church.2 At least 115 texts have been discovered that include Old Charges that were given to masons and contain a legendary history that had been developed by the fifteenth century.3 The earliest text, called the Regius Manuscript (c. 1390, also known as the Halliwell Manuscript), records that Euclid invented geometry in Egypt and that the knowledge of Masonry was preserved and “came into England” during the reign of King Athelstane. The Cooke Manuscript (c. 1410) revealed that Jabal, who was born into the seventh generation after Adam and was the son of Lamech, “was the first man that ever found geometry and Masonry.” He was “Cain’s master mason, and governor of all his works, when he made the city of Enock, that was the first city.” Jabal’s half-brother, Tubal Cain, “was the founder of smith’s craft . . .that is to say, of iron, of brass, of gold, and of silver.”4 The Cooke Manuscript recorded that Lamech, Jabal, and Tubal Cain preserved “the sciences that they [had] found on marble (that would not burn) and on latres (which would not sink) and these stones were preserved during Noah’s flood. Pythagoras found one of the stones and Hermes found the other, many years after the flood,” and “taught forth the sciences that they found therein written.” Thereafter Abraham “taught the Egyptians the science of geometry” among whom was his clerk, Euclid. The Hebrews learned geometry in Egypt and afterward practiced it in Jerusalem where Solomon taught the craft. Finally, the science of geometry was brought to France and to England.5 These documents reflected inspiration from various sources, including the Bible, the writings of Josephus, the Hebrew Apocrypha, as well as the 2.

By the mid-sixteenth century Scottish operative masons who completed their apprenticeships received a “mason’s word,” which they were bound by oath to keep secret. This word enabled them to recognize other members of the craft (and perhaps their assignments and pay grades) and prevented “cowans,” nonmembers of the brotherhood, from obtaining unauthorized work. In England there is no evidence that operative masons used ­ ason’s word as a form of recognition. Although Scottish masons only am used a mason’s word for a short time before non-Masons began joining the brotherhood or forming their own organizations, the word was eventually incorporated into the ritual of speculative Masonry.8\n\nSpeculative Freemasonry There are at least seventeen Masonic documents that suggest that a speculative Masonic ritual, in which nonoperative gentlemen Masons who were drawn from the local gentry participated, existed as early as the mid-­ seventeenth century. Seven of these were published “from motives of curiosity, profit, or spite,” and ten were prepared by Masons for personal use and to serve as aides-mémoires.9 Some speculative lodges used Old Charges and the mason’s word, which some Masonic historians believe establishes a link between “operative” and “speculative” Masonry. According to this theory 6. Douglas Knoop and G. P.

Scottish masons bound themselves together as early as the sixteenth century in lodges where they governed their affairs and admitted new masons into the craft. In England the operative masons, who formed guilds such as the London Company of Masons, did not develop a lodge system until the eighteenth century.12 No one knows precisely why operative stonemasons would admit nonguild members, or why they would agree to transform their lodges into gentlemen’s clubs, but one possible reason was because they needed money. Historian Margaret Jacob has noted that “the Scottish records as early as the 1650s show that the local guilds were in need of cash and they began admitting non-masons who were relatives, or prominent figures, with similar philosophical interests.”13 In England, some operative lodges apparently accepted gentlemen (as they had in Scotland) while other gentlemen decided to organize their own lodges that did not include operative members and in which they adopted the symbols and legends of stonemasons as allegorical teaching aids. But some nonoperative lodges, which were controlled by gentlemen, occasionally accepted working masons who were members of an operative lodge and bound themselves to assist them in times of need. This combination of evolution and intervention led to the development of a “mystical” form of speculative Masonry that was, in part, “a reaction to Protestantism by providing a substitute for banished rituals.”14 Some of the first documented “speculative Masons” were prominent and well-connected gentlemen who were interested in Hermetic thought and esotericism.

Kirk MacNulty has suggested that “the source of these Freemasons’ interest in classical philosophy was their study of Renaissance philosophers.”17 David Stevenson, another Masonic scholar, has noted that Hermetic texts, which Renaissance gentlemen believed were written in Egypt eight centuries before Christ and foreshadowed his divine mission, but were actually written no earlier than the second century ad, emphasized “a spiritual quest whereby man could seek to distance himself from the material world and become imbued with divine power and v­ irtues.”18 This “spiritual quest” was premised on the belief that “man could understand the world around him and would then be able to alter it, bending the powers of nature to his own ends.”19 It also advanced the notion that men could “ascend in consciousness from the physical world through the levels of the psychic/soul and the spirit and experience the Divine Presence while one is incarnate.”20 As such it provided a ladder up “to recover the divine power and perfection preserved by Adam before the Fall.”21\n\nRosicrucian Enlightenment This “new interest in the Hermetic tradition” influenced the development of a less widespread movement that has been called the “Rosicrucian Enlightenment.”22 Two Rosicrucian Manifestos, Fama Fraternitatis and Confessio 15.

These documents claimed that the tomb of a mystic named Christian Rosenkreutz, who founded a secret brotherhood during the fifteenth century, was discovered that contained an altar covered with an engraved brass plate, books, and “looking-glasses of divers virtues.” Rosenkreutz’s remains were located beneath the altar and a parchment book (called I) was still in his hand “which next to our Bible is our greatest treasure, which ought to be delivered to the censure of the world.”23 Frances Yates concluded in The Rosicrucian Enlightenment that Rosicrucian thought was a product of the seventeenth (not fifteenth) century and that it advocated “a great reformation” that would result in “‘a great influx of truth and light’ such as surrounded Adam in Paradise, and which God will allow before the end of the world” in order to bring about “a return to Adamic innocence.”24 The Rosicrucian documents invited interested souls to seek out the secret brotherhood and to become enlightened through a spiritual alchemy that regenerated and changed the soul.25 Yates argued that Protestant ministers and government agents invented the Rosicrucian myth for religious (anti-Catholic) and political (anti-­Austrian) reasons. Nevertheless, some historians have speculated that Rosicrucian thought, which fueled rumors of lost ancient manuscripts, contributed to an increased interest in speculative Freemasonry.26 Some gentlemen apparently believed that by joining a lodge bound by secret oath, with origins shrouded in mystery, they would obtain illumination concerning lost knowledge and ancient mysteries. They were anxious to obtain esoteric secrets and to advance a philosophical system of “building a better man in a better world” and adopted the tools and functions of the building trade as symbols and allegory.27 They were also interested in architecture and geometry, and may have become persuaded that operative masons, who built cathedrals, castles, fortifications, and large estates, would share their knowledge concerning these subjects and that their lodges were good locations for intellectual exchanges.28 23.

Yates notes: “Freemasonry combines\n\nan esoteric approach to religion with ethical teaching and emphasis on philanthropy, and in these ways follows the pattern of the R.C. [Rosicrucian] Brothers, but as A. E. Waite points out, it differs from that pattern in not being interested in reform of arts and sciences,\n\nEuropean Freemasonry 11\n\nSir Robert Moray (1608–1673), a founding member of the Royal Society who was interested in alchemy, was initiated in 1641 into a Scottish operative lodge that was working in northern England.29 Elias Ashmole (1617– 1692), another founding member of the Royal Society, an antiquarian book collector and a student of Hermeticism, alchemy, and Rosicrucianism, was initiated in a “casual Lodge” located in Warrington, Lancashire, England in 1646. The casual lodge that Ashmole joined consisted entirely of speculative masons. He either joined a new organization, which had never admitted operative Masons, or speculative masons had already taken control of an operative lodge. Dr. Robert Plot, who was the first keeper of the Asmolean Museum, wrote that “persons of the most eminent quality...did not disdain to be of this Fellowship.”30 Ashmole “copied out in his own hand the Rosicrucian manifestos adding to them a formal letter in his own hand admiring their aims and asking them to be allowed to join them.”31 David Stevenson and other historians of Masonry have concluded that eventually these strands of esoteric Renaissance thought were spliced onto masonic legends.32 Thereafter, “the myth of Egypt, Solomon’s Temple, the Hermetic quest, the art of memory,” were supplemented with a “secret ­order of invisible brethren, dedicated to seeking ultimate truths and to understanding the mysterious universe.”33 The rudimentary legends contained in the Halliwell, Cooke, and other Masonic manuscripts were symbolically reinterpreted and expanded to include new details about Noah’s Ark and Solomon’s Temple, including the story of Solomon’s architect, Hiram Abiff.34 According to Stevenson there were “resemblances between Hermeticism and freemasonry which cannot be dismissed as mere coincidences.” When gentlemen began to enter Freemasonry it coincided with “the Hermetic striving for enlightenment and spiritual rebirth of mankind, based on secret knowledge and secret societies or cults.” This was not surprising given the Masonic Old Charges that made references to Euclid and Hermes in scientific research, or in alchemy and magic, and in many other ways” (p. 218).

Exploiting such connections, according to Stevenson, gave the Masonic craft a special status.35 Some Masonic writers have connected the Rosicrucian story concerning the discovery of a hidden tomb with the legends of Freemasonry. As noted earlier, the tomb contained an altar covered with an engraved brass plate, books, looking-glasses, and the remains of Rosenkreutz under the ­altar holding a parchment book.36 The brass plate contained “figures and inscriptions, one of which is ‘The whole Glory of God’” as well as information concerning the creation of the universe.37 Thus, Rosicrucianism assisted the Masons in advancing the theme of loss and restoration of a primitive or pure body of knowledge accompanied by the persistent presence of an apostate version. In addition, both movements valued secrecy. Stevenson has noted that even though the “secrecy associated with masonic lodges which emerged in seventeenth-century Scotland was partly a legacy of the Medieval past, of the craft keeping the ‘mysteries’ of its operative trade to itself,” such secrecy was reinforced by the “common tendency to feel that the more exclusive knowledge was, the more valuable it must be” and because “the great secrets of the universe would be cheapened if revealed to all.”38 Thereafter speculative lodges gradually developed more esoteric rituals (which incorporated the “mason’s word”) that had significant similarities with rituals practiced by Rosicrucians and other hermeticists.39\n\nThe Premier Grand Lodge Masonic historians have concluded that the transition from operative masonry to speculative Freemasonry was completed by the end of the seventeenth century.40 By that time most gentlemen Masons had discovered that 35.

Jacob, The Origins of Freemasonry, 13.\n\nEuropean Freemasonry 13\n\noperative masonry had little knowledge to impart, beyond the Old Charges concerning “enlightenment and the spiritual rebirth of mankind, based on secret knowledge and secret societies and cults.” Thereafter, they became less interested in either esotericism or Christianity and emphasized the craft’s teachings of morality, which were veiled in allegory and illustrated in symbols. While operative masons were exclusively Christians, those who dominated speculative Freemasonry were deists, Jews, and students of the Enlightenment who eventually dispensed with the religious emphases of the earlier brotherhoods. Stevenson has noted that “the lodge system, combined with secrecy, ideals of loyalty and secret modes of recognition, had created an ideal organizational framework, into which members could put their own values and which they could adapt for their own uses.” Protestants, who were suspicious of rituals and symbolism, responded to these changes by referring to Masons as “Evil-doers” and charged that “this devilish Sect of Men are Meeters in secret which swear against all without their Following.”41 On June 24, 1717, speculative Masons from four lodges met at the Goose and Gridiron Ale House in St. Paul’s Churchyard, where they organized what would eventually become the Grand Lodge of England. This new organization was controlled exclusively by gentlemen Masons and it became a bastion of Enlightenment deism.42 This Premier Grand Lodge was independent of any other guild masons (including the London Company of Masons) and participant lodges gradually increased from four in 1717 to over seventy by 1730. The Grand Lodge began exercising control over as much territory as it could and insisted, according to Tobias Churton, “that a new lodge could be described as regular only if it had been created with permission of the grand master.”43 In 1723 James Anderson (1679–1739), a Presbyterian minister and Freemason, published Constitutions of Freemasons, which summarized and elaborated the mythological history of Masonry as well as the Old Charges, which he referred to as “ancient landmarks.” Thereafter Constitutions became the official version of such legends, history, and practices.44 The landmarks included the requirement that a candidate for Freemasonry could not be “a stupid atheist.” This was a deviation from the Old Charges 41.

See Knoop and Jones,\n\nA Short History of Freemasonry, 26–38.\n\n14\n\nchapter 1\n\nthat were written when masons were Christian guild members. Some Masonic writers have concluded that Anderson’s Constitutions effectively de-­ Christianized Masonry and afterward the Grand Lodge did not require belief in a Christian God,45 but Alexander Piatigorsky has noted that there were “two streams of Masonic opinion at that time, specifically Christian and generally Deist,” and that Anderson’s Constitutions represented the latter while a book published the prior year — ​The Old (or Robert’s) Constitutions — ​was representative of the Christian approach.46 The Old Charges also required Masons to be “good and true Men, freeborn, and of mature and discreet Age, no Bondmen, no Women, no immoral or scandalous Men, but of good report.” A Mason was required to be “a peaceable subject to the civil powers.” Masons were judged on their own “personal merit,” they were expected to “work honestly on working days, that they may live credibly on holy days,” and while in the lodge they could not enter into “quarrels about religion, or Nations, or State policy.” Anderson’s Constitutions endowed Masonry with historical legitimacy and social respectability. Anderson was the first Mason who referred to God as “the great Architect of the Universe,” 47 connected the Craft with “the chosen people of God” in the Old Testament, and asserted that primitive Freemasonry (Priesthood) had been taught and practiced since the creation of the world.48 Most Freemasons believed that the Craft retained knowledge concerning the ancient mysteries that would have otherwise become lost or corrupted.49 Anderson’s “History of Masonry,” which was based on the Gothic Constitutions, traced the “Craft” from Adam to the building of Solomon’s Temple and from there to contemporary times. According to Constitutions, Adam taught his Sons Geometry, and the use of it, in the several Arts and Crafts convenient, at least for those early Times; for Cain, we find, built a city, which he called consecrated, or dedicated, after the name of his eldest son Enoch; and becoming the Prince of 45.

See Jean Calvin, Instituto Christianae religionis (Genevae, 1559). David Stevenson notes that the idea that “the universe was constructed by God according to mathematical principles was an ancient idea” and can be traced to Plato. During the Renaissance this concept was reintroduced by Pico della Mirandola, Johann Valentin Andreae, and Sir Thomas Browne. See Stevenson, The Origins of Freemasonry, 109. 48.

Noah, and his three sons, Japheth, Shem and Ham, all Masons true, brought with them over the Flood the Traditions and Arts of the Ante-deluvians, and amply communicated them to their growing Offspring.50\n\nFull Ceremonies and Catechisms After the Premier Grand Lodge was organized, some of its members, including John Theopolis Desaguliers (1683–1744) and “other likeminded men, continued looking for a fresh model” that would result in “loosening of exclusive relations with Christianity.” The new model became the story of Solomon’s Temple, which was mentioned in the “Old Charges” and in early catechisms.51 When a new third degree was developed from 1723 to 1725 the temple theme was paramount and facilitated a “spiritual quest for God’s primal revelation” and for “ancient keys to divine knowledge” that had been lost.52 When Samuel Prichard published an exposé in 1730 entitled Masonry Dissected he revealed “the full ceremonies and catechisms for the three Craft degrees” including the passwords for the various degrees.53 Afterward, Anderson published a second edition of Constitutions in which he acknowledged the newly developed three-degree ritual and slightly modified requirement for candidacy: “The Men made Masons must be Freeborn (or no Bondmen), of mature Age and of good Report, hail and sound, not deform’d or dismember’d at the Time of their making. But no Woman, no Eunuch.” He claimed, for the first time, that the Grand Lodge had revived a prior practice of gathering lodges together for quarterly meetings when it was organized in 1717. Despite this claim there is no evidence that a Grand Lodge had previously existed or that such meetings had taken place.54 50. Anderson’s Constitutions of 1723, 3. 51. Churton, Freemasonry, 72. Mackey notes that Masonic legend “assigns its origins equally\n\nto two other periods” upon which the rituals could have been developed, i.e., “the building of the Tower of Babel, when Nimrod was Grand Master, and to Egypt under the geometrician Euclid.” Mackey, The History of Freemasonry, 1:163. 52.

Lewis Edwards concludes that the 1738 edition “followed the scriptures more closely” and that the working was less tentative. Edwards, “Anderson’s Book of Constitutions of 1738,” in Anderson’s Book of Constitutions of 1738, A Facsimile of the original text with\n\n16\n\nchapter 1\n\nSome Masonic writers have concluded that Anderson’s revisions advanced a kind of “natural religion” that was consistent with Enlightenment thought, rather than revealed religion as taught by the Catholic Church.55 Subsequent published exposés demonstrate that Masonic lodges continued to modify and embellish their rituals, and that there were variations in practices and many versions of the three degrees. The rituals provided candidates with knowledge as well as passwords and pass grips that would enable them to advance from spiritual darkness (the physical world) to increasingly higher levels of “individual consciousness and the Soul” and finally to a “level of consciousness that interfaces with the Spirit.”56 In each degree the candidates were given obligations of secrecy even though it soon became apparent that not every Mason complied with that requirement. The three degrees (when fully developed) enabled initiates to take small steps, and to make progress by degrees, in order to ultimately attain perfection. The Entered Apprentice (the first degree) began his journey in Solomon’s Temple where he was taught to use Jacob’s ladder to ascend from spiritual darkness to consciousness. The candidate was compared to a “rough stone from which the perfect stone may be drawn” by “knocking chips off the disordered man on his path to (hopefully) perfection.” He was also given pass grips and passwords, obligated himself to secrecy, and was introduced to various symbols, such as the square and compass.57 The Fellow Craft (the second degree) continued his journey from darkness to illumination in Solomon’s Temple where he was introduced into the middle chamber of the temple, where most of the ritual took place, and was shown the portal to the Holy of Holies.58 During the Master Mason, or third, degree, candidates were instructed that when Adam was expelled from the Garden of Eden, where he lived in God’s presence, he became spiritually dead. This degree contained extra-­ Biblical details concerning Solomon’s Temple and focused on the death of Hiram Abiff, the temple architect in Masonic legend, who is only briefly mentioned in the Bible. Abiff was murdered by three ruffians ( Jubela, Jubelo, and Jubelum) during the construction of the temple because he refused to reveal temple secrets (the “Master’s Word” or secret name of God) commentaries by Lewis Edwards and W. J. Hughan (Bloomington, IL: The Masonic Book Club, 1978), 369, 395. 55. Churton, Freemasonry, 300–304. 56. McNulty, Freemasonry, 145. 57. Churton, Freemasonry, 15–16, 90. 58.

When they found his grave they noted that the Master’s Word was missing and they were unable to raise him from his grave by using grips from the first and second degrees. They finally lifted him from his grave by employing the grip of the third degree and the five points of fellowship. One ruffian was immediately apprehended, stabbed in the heart and head, and beheaded. The other ruffians fled to Gath but they were eventually tracked down and killed.61 During the ritual each candidate experienced death (spiritual death) and was raised by the five points of fellowship from the grave of darkness to a cradle of light, and thereafter became a new man. The candidate was taught that in order to regain consciousness and understand the real meaning of life it was necessary to be endowed with light, and with that endowment each Master Mason continued to build his spiritual temple in order to reestablish his presence with God.62 Master Masons were given additional tokens, signs, and substitute words for the lost Mason’s word that would permit them to enter into a celestial lodge. Master Masons were introduced to new symbols, including the all-seeing eye and the beehive,63 and learned that one of the symbols of 59. The construction of the Temple of Solomon (which took place between 958 bce and\n\n951 bce) is mentioned in 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, and 1 Chronicles. Both of these books were written after the Assyrians captured Jerusalem in 586 bce, the temple was destroyed, and the Jews were exiled in Babylon. The Masonic story of Hiram Abiff is much more detailed than the Biblical accounts. In the Bible “Huram” is identified as king of Tyre, who provided Solomon with “a cunning man” to help Solomon build his temple (2 Chronicles 2:13). H ­ iram, the “widow’s son,” is mentioned in I Kings 7:13–14 and 2 Chronicles 2:13–14 and 4:16, but the name “Hiram Abiff,” or “Abiff,” does not appear in the Old Testament. His cunning was required to construct two huge bronze pillars ( Jachin and Boaz) at the entrance of the temple and the “Sea of Bronze” which was used by priests as an ablutions basin. According to some exposés, the signs, tokens, and words were used to distinguish the grades of masons and their wages. See Richard Carlile, Manual of Freemasonry (London: Wm. Reeves, n.d.), 49–50; David Bernard, Light on Masonry: A Collection of all the Most Important Documents on the Subject of Speculative Free Masonry (Utica, NY: William Williams, 1829), 94–95; Hutchinson, The Spirit of Masonry, 139; Wellins Calcott, A Candid Disquisition of the Principles and Practices of the Most Ancient and Honorable Society of Free and Accepted Masons, with an introduction by Wallace McLeod (Bloomington, Illinois: The Masonic Book Club, 1989), 123–24. 60.

Some of those who were successful in gaining admission were shocked when they discovered that some English lodges had switched the passwords previously utilized in the first and second degrees to make it more difficult after Prichard published his exposé for non-­ Masons to surreptitiously gain admission into their rituals.66 Eventually some of these Irish Masons formed their own lodges and in 1751 they organized a competing “Grand Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons according to the Old Institutions,” and its members became known as the Ancients.67 In 1756 Laurence Dermott (1720–1791), who was the intellectual leader of the Ancients, published Ahiman Rezon, which was the Ancients’ book of constitutions.68 Dermott attacked the pretensions and authority of the Grand Lodge of England, which he successfully dubbed the Moderns, and claimed that it had not faithfully protected the “old institutions” of Freemasonry. In addition to objecting to changes in passwords, the Ancients noted ”the omission of prayers, no longer celebrating the holy days of the saints John the Baptist and John the Evangelist, and the perception that the rituals of the Craft were being de-Christianized and replaced with deism.”69 They believed that after the Grand Lodge was organized, Freemasonry had “fallen away” from its primitive practices and was gripped by Enlightenment ideas.70 Hutchinson, The Spirit of Masonry, 139; Wellins Calcott, Calcott’s Masonry, with Considerate Additions and Improvements (Philadelphia: Robert DeSilver, 1817), 123–24. 64.

Jones,\n\nEuropean Freemasonry 19\n\nAlthough the Ancients claimed that they had restored the old forms that were modified by the Moderns, they also embraced a new degree known as the Royal Arch because they were convinced that it was the next logical step in the Hiramic legend outlined in the Master Masons Degree. The Royal Arch explained the circumstances under which “the pure Masonic tradition,” including the Master’s Word, was preserved and restored after Hiram Abiff was killed. It elaborated the story of Enoch, who spoke to God face to face and preserved the name of God on a gold plate that was buried in vaults located below the future site of Solomon’s temple, and in the British Royal Arch the “mason’s word” was rediscovered in these vaults when Zerubbabel rebuilt the temple.71 Dermott wrote that the Royal Arch degree, which emerged after the organization of the Grand Lodge, was “the root, heart, and marrow of Masonry.”72 The Royal Arch degree may have originated in Ireland, developed on the continent, been fabricated by Laurence Dermott, or taken from the third degree.73 Although the Moderns initially rejected the Ancients’ claim that the Royal Arch was part of ancient masonry and refused to include it in their rituals, they soon determined that they “were losing potential members to the Ancients,” particularly those who were “attracted by the lure of a ‘more ancient Masonry.’” As such, they signed a Charter of Compact that created a Grand and Royal Chapter of the Royal Arch of Jerusalem that enabled Moderns to become Royal Arch Masons. Even so, they did not consider it part of ancient Masonry or one of three degrees of Craft Masonry.74\n\nHaut Grades Shortly after the Grand Lodge was organized, the Craft quickly spread to continental Europe and throughout the British Empire.75 In 1736 Scottish-­ born Andrew Michael Ramsay (1686–1743), a Jacobite living in exile in France, delivered a discourse at St. John’s Lodge in Paris in which he Freemasons’ Guide and Compendium (N.p.: Dobby, 1956), 193–212.

Grand lodges were organized in Ireland (1730), Scotland (1736), France (1738), and Germany (1741).\n\n20\n\nchapter 1\n\nappealed to aristocrats, gentry, and bourgeoisie by deemphasizing the “operative stonemason origins” of Freemasonry and by emphasizing that the Craft could make “claim to very ancient and noble origins.” Ramsay claimed that during the Crusades “many princes, lords, and citizens associated themselves and vowed to restore the temple of the Christians,” and that they “agreed upon several ancient signs and symbolic words drawn from the well of religion in order to recognize themselves amongst the heathen and the Saracens.” He also suggested that they intended to “unite Christians of all nationalities in one cofraternity.” Thereafter, according to Ramsay, ­Masons “formed an intimate union with the Knights of St. John of Jerusalem.” But Masonry was “founded in remote antiquity” and was “renewed in the Holy Land by our ancestors in order to recall the memory of the most sublime truths amidst the pleasures of society.”76 When Ramsay requested Cardinal André-Hercule de Fleury (1653– 1743), who was the Chief Minister to King Louis XV (1710–1774), to grant permission to publish his oration, he was rebuffed and the French King instead issued an edict that prohibited all of his subjects from becoming Freemasons. The French police were thereafter authorized to raid Masonic meeting places and the homes of Freemasons. In Paris, “Freemasonry was made Felony by law, and the brethren required the strictest obedience to the precepts and oaths of secrecy, or they fell into the hands of the civil authorities.”77 Shortly thereafter, Pope Clement XII (1652–1740) issued a Papal Bull in which he denounced Freemasonry and prohibited all Catholics from joining its lodges.78 These legal maneuvers did not retard the growth of French Free­masonry. Instead French Masons developed a number of high degrees (haut grades) including rituals concerning the Knights Templar. Some have suggested that Ramsay wrote, or at least inspired, these high degrees even though he did not mention Knights Templar during his oration.79 But it is more 76.

These rites taught that some Knights Templar survived the French purge and took refuge in Masonic guilds in England and Scotland where they continued as a secret society.80 In 1754 the Chevalier de Bonneville established a chapter known as the “Rite of Perfection,” which worked these high degrees. The contents of these degrees were revealed in various French exposés, including Les Plus Secrets Mystères des Hauts Grades de la Maçonnerie Dévoilés (1766). That exposé contained descriptions of seven degrees (in addition to the three degrees of Craft Masonry) that elaborated the temple-building mythology. French Freemasons also developed several degrees, including the Knight King of the Rose Croix, which some claimed was descended from Rosicrucian sources but which were actually eighteenth-century rituals. The expansion of Freemasonry to the continent and the creation of the haut grades coincided with “a revival of alchemical, Rosicrucian and Hermetic philosophy” on the continent.81 The degrees that included hermetic strands eventually influenced Masonic lecturers and ritualists in England and America and advanced “the ultimate Masonic myth . . .the restoration of the paradisiacal power of Adam.”82\n\nAdoptive Rites Although Anderson’s Constitutions prohibited the initiation of female members, some French lodges organized a system of separate adoptive lodges that included both men and women.83 Janet Mackay Burke, a Templar”) in The Philosophical Principles of Natural and Revealed Religion, which was published posthumously in 1749. 80.

These lodges initiated both men and women and considered women to be regular Freemasons.85 Snoek has concluded that two French rituals, which were exposed in 1744 (La Franc-Maçonne ou Révélation des Mystères des Francs-Maçons and La Parfait Maçon), were part of this Harodim tradition.86 Harry Carr, who republished these exposés, had previously concluded that they were not exposures of real rituals but instead smokescreens for those that were. He noted that La Franc-Maçonne included three plates, including one “depicting Adam and Eve under the Tree of Knowledge,” but that they are “only remotely relevant to the contents of the text and the ­author has made no attempt to describe them or explain their presence.”87 The La Parfait Maçon also included a woodcut of Adam and Eve being tempted in the Garden, and its first degree is set in the Garden of Eden and was described as “a sort of garden representing the Earthly paradise, with the Tree of Knowledge of good & evil, around which are placed the figures of Adam, Eve & the Serpent.”88 Regardless of whether these French rituals were connected to Harodim rites, Snoek has concluded that, based on their similar content, they were modified and expanded to create an adoptive ritual. The first exposures of a French adoptive ritual were published in London as Women’s Masonry, or Masonry by Adoption, in 1765 and in Paris as Les quatre grades complets de Seguin Frères, 1881), 2:9–11.

The adoptive rituals contained narratives that were based on stories contained in Genesis, including the Tower of Babel, Jacob’s Ladder, Noah’s Ark, and the Garden of Eden.90 Snoek concluded that “the second degree [which narrates the story of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden] turns out to be the heart of the Adoption Rite.”91 During the ritual, the garden is filled with flowers and fruits, and there is an apple tree bearing fruit in the center of the lodge room and a serpent with an apple in its mouth.92 The Master of the lodge tells the candidate to “receive the fruit from the tree which is in the midst [of the Garden of Eden]; as soon as you have tasted from it, you will become as one of us, knowing good and evil.” According to Snoek, “this confirms that the Master plays here the role of God, and that he pronounces at this moment the divinity of Eve, played by the Candidate.” But the ritual also emphasized the necessity for Eve and her other “companions” [the name of the degree] to exercise unrelenting discretion in the future and the candidates therefore took obligations of secrecy and the Master applied a paste called the “Seal of Taciturnity” with a trowel to the candidate’s lips.93 The second degree (“The Fellow-Crafts Lodge”) described in the London exposé, Women’s Masonry, or Masonry by Adoption, included a dramatization of Eve’s temptation in the Garden of Eden, “a garden of olives, watered by a river” which river represents the “rapidity of human passions, which are best curbed by becoming Masons and Masonesses,” and the fruit of the “tree of Knowledge of good and evil.”94 In 1791 a second English translation, entitled Free Masonry for the Ladies, or the Grand Secret 89.

It included a similar description of the second degree (“Companion”) and referred to a candidate as the “Elected Lady,” whose lips are anointed “with the seal of discretion.”95 By 1774, after the number of female lodges had increased, the Grand Orient of France recognized them, took control of them, and promulgated rules and regulations under which the Master or Deputy Master of a regular male lodge presided over them and was “assisted by a female President.”96 Masonic writer Robert Gilbert has noted that the “structure and working Adoptive lodges resembled Craft lodges except that the female members were not permitted to work alone: each officer was accompanied by a mason who took a parallel office.”97 Thus, regardless of whether female initiates were originally real Masons, they were eventually “adopted” by regular male lodges and women were no longer considered Freemasons or allowed to attend regular male lodges.98\n\nThree Great Expounders Throughout the eighteenth century English Freemasons continued to modify and embellish the Craft’s three-degree ritual,99 and during the 1760s at least nine exposés were published in England.100 The Craft degrees, which included tokens (pass grips), passwords, obligations of secrecy, &c.

The most influential exposures, Three Distinct Knocks (1760) and Jachin and Boaz (1762), were published without attribution and revealed that different lodges practiced variant forms of a dynamic ritual that included Christian prayers, which had not been mentioned in Prichard’s exposé.101 In addition, Arturo de Hoyas has noted that these exposés demonstrate that “only post-1760 rituals included separate obligations for the degrees, in conjunction with the penalties, tokens and words.”102 Robin L. Carr and Louis L. Williams have concluded that following exposures the ritual was further modified and that “tiny bits” can be traced to “The Old Gothic Constitutions,” “a good deal” from “The Early Masonic Catechisms,” and “the largest amount, including many of the longer charges,” from “the work of the so-called ‘three great expounders’ of the ritual.”103 These three expounders, Wellins Calcott (bap. 1726–1779?), William Hutchinson (1705–1777), and William Preston (1742–1818), polished the ritual into “a more attractive form, closer to what is familiar today” and “wrote longer charges and for the first time included something for the mind.”104 Their lectures emphasized that following Adam’s expulsion from God’s presence, God introduced “secret knowledge” to illuminate those who were worthy, and that Masonic rituals revealed such knowledge to aid men to return to God’s presence. In 1769 Calcott published A Candid Disquisition of the Principles and Practices of the Most Ancient and Honorable Society of Free and Accepted ­Masons in which he emphasized the legendary history of the Craft, that God revealed the sciences, law, and the royal art when Adam transgressed in the garden and that this secret knowledge was communicated to “the worthy only.”105 The workmen who built Solomon’s temple “had certain modes of recognition, and a system of three degrees, and these were naturally passed on to their successors.” Thus Masonry “became a regular and uniform institution” with the building of this temple.106 Solomon in All his Glory (London, 1766); and Charles Warren, The Freemason Stripped ­Naked (London, 1769). 101.

Preston’s Illustrations of Masonry, published in 1772, summarized his lectures, which explained the three degrees with clarity. Preston has been described as “the latest and greatest” of the men who “eventually took what was best in the other two [Calcott and Hutchinson] and consolidated it.”109 He became “the most important thinker in eighteenth century English Freemasonry,” as evidenced by his system of lectures to modify and standardize the widely divergent rituals that were being practiced in English lodges.110 His book was published in many subsequent editions, in England and America, and became a foundational work for later Masonic lecturers and commentators.111 Hutchinson, an attorney who was initiated into a Modern lodge in 1770, has been referred to as “the father of masonic symbolism.” In 1775 he published The Spirit of Masonry in Moral and Elucidatory Lectures,112 which has been described as “the first efficient attempt to explain the true philosophy of masonry, there represented as a Christian institution which should be open only to those who believe in the doctrine of the Holy Trinity.”113 The great expounders did little to mollify the different perspectives in English Freemasonry concerning the Royal Arch, which were not resolved until decades later when the Moderns and Ancients formed a United Grand Lodge and agreed to define “Pure Antient Masonry” as consisting of the usual three degrees of Entered Apprentice, Fellow Craft, and ­Master 107.

By 1730 Benjamin Franklin had joined the Craft in Philadelphia, printed a notice that there were several active lodges in the city, and the following year published the first American edition of Anderson’s Constitutions.1 From 1730 to 1781 the Grand Lodge of London appointed thirty-six provincial grand masters to represent it in America. Daniel Coxe was the first provincial grand master for New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, and in 1733 Henry Price became the provincial grand master for New England.2 In 1734 Boston Lodge No. 126 became the first American lodge to appear on the list of English lodges, followed by Savannah/Province of Georgia Lodge No. 139 in 1736.3 Beginning in 1761 the Ancients appointed provincial grand masters and by the end of the Revolutionary War the Ancients Provincial Grand Lodge in Pennsylvania had authorized over fifty lodges to organize in 1. Before he became a Mason, Benjamin Franklin reprinted “The Mystery of Free-­Masonry,”\n\nin his Pennsylvania Gazette which was originally published in the London Daily Journal. There were also American editions of Prichard (1749), Hiram (1768), Jachin and Boaz (published in twenty editions from 1794 to 1828); Samuel Prichard, Masonry Dissected (n.p., 1749); Anonymous, Hiram: on the Grand Master-Key to the Door of Both Ancient and Modern Free-Masonry (New York: John Holt, 1768); and Anonymous, Jachin and Boaz (Boston: J.

Robert Gould claimed that two Masons immigrated to the province of “East Jersey” in 1682: one returned a year later, and one served as deputy-governor of the province, 1685–1690. There is no evidence that either of these Masons organized a lodge. See Robert F. Gould, Gould History of Freemasonry Throughout the World (New York: Charles Scribner’s Sons, 1936), 6:1–2. 3. Roberts, Freemasonry in American History, 18–21, 23, 30. 29\n\n30\n\nchapter 2\n\nNorth America and in the Caribbean.4 In 1788 George Washington, who was initiated into Freemasonry in 1752 when he was a young man living in Fredericksburg, Virginia, was elected worshipful master of his lodge in Alexandria, Virginia, and four years later he laid the cornerstone of the new capitol building in full Masonic regalia. Steven Bullock has noted that “particularly in the years after President George Washington laid the cornerstone of the U.S. Capitol in 1792, the fraternity spread into nearly every locality in the country” and increased in “both numbers and prestige.”5 American Masons began organizing their own grand lodges after the colonies broke away from their English king. In 1781 the first American grand lodge was organized in New York and by 1800 there were eleven grand lodges, 347 subordinate lodges, and 16,000 Freemasons.6 In some states, such as Massachusetts, competing grand lodges were organized but they eventually worked out their differences. These grand lodges became new obediences or administrative organizations, which were independent of the two competing English grand lodges and claimed “exclusive jurisdiction” over all Masonic lodges that were organized within each state.\n\nThe Illuminati As Freemasonry spread in America, it became the target of sectarian attacks by religious zealots who believed that it was connected to a secret European order known as the Order of the Illuminati. They alleged that the Illuminati had infiltrated into the high degrees and that Masonry, with its secret rituals and worldwide network, was a threat to the homeland and a hazard for Christianity. This conspiracy theory was an echo of claims that had been advanced by European writers shortly after the French Revolution and was premised on paranoia concerning a short-lived secret order that was inspired by Freemasonry and organized in Bavaria.7 In 1776 Adam Weishaupt (1748–1830), the dean of the law faculty at the University of Ingolstadt, established an “Order of the Illuminati” and constructed a legendary history that traced the organization’s origins to Persia 4.

He divided the order into various classes and degrees that practiced a quasi-Masonic ritual.8 Weishaupt planned to utilize this new organization to overthrow the conservative Kingdom of Bavaria (which was dominated by the Roman Catholic Church) and to replace it with a liberal form of republican government. In 1777, Weishaupt was initiated as a Freemason in Munich’s “Zur Behutsamkeit” Lodge. He began recruiting heavily among its members and his organization soon had more than twenty-five hundred followers. In 1780 a prominent Freemason named Baron Adolf Franz Friedrich Ludwig von Knigge (1752–1796) joined Weishaupt’s order and rewrote its rituals to more closely resemble Masonic ceremonies. But von Knigge eventually left the movement after losing a power struggle with Weishaupt.9 In 1784 the Elector of Bavaria issued an edict against secret societies after some former members of the Illuminati (including Professor Joseph Utzschneider) revealed Weishaupt’s secret ambitions to the aristocracy. The following year the Bavarian monarch issued two additional edicts that prohibited all secret societies, including the Order of the Illuminati and Freemasonry, from operating within the kingdom. Soon thereafter the police seized documents that confirmed the Illuminati intended to overthrow the government and Weishaupt fled to Germany. The government conducted additional inquiries following Weishaupt’s departure to identify other members of the order who held teaching and government positions or were members of the military who were subsequently dismissed from their posts and even banished from Bavaria. The government eventually published many of the Illuminati’s secret books, letters, and other records, issued a fourth edict, and aggressively took measures that effectively destroyed the order.10 8.

Robison was a former Freemason, and Barruel was a Catholic abbot who took refuge in England; both claimed that after Weishaupt left Bavaria, the Illuminati “revived immediately, under another name, and in a different form.” Robison became interested in German Freemasonry and the Order of the Illuminati in 1795, after reading a German periodical, Religions Begeben­ heiten.13 He noted that both politics and religion were discussed when he visited a lodge in France, and that “an organization [the Order of Illuminati] has been formed for the express purpose of rooting out all the religious establishments, and overturning all existing governments of Europe.” He believed that although it “took its first rise among the Free Masons,” it was “totally different from Freemasonry” and “rose naturally from the corruptions that had gradually crept into that fraternity.”14 Robison claimed that the Illuminati encouraged its adepts to become initiated into the first degrees of Freemasonry and that if “his Superiors judge more favorably of him, he is drawn out of the general mass of Free Masons, and becomes Illuminatus Minor.”15 He believed the order had “taken so deep root that it still subsists without being detected and has spread into all the countries of Europe.”16 He asserted that members of the order took refuge in France, where they became the secret leaders of French Freemasonry, and helped foment the French Revolution and that the order ultimately accomplished its original goal of “revolution and the destruction of all authority, for the restoration of patriarchal life.”17 Both authors were convinced that the Illuminati were continuing to conspire to overthrow all civil government and religion throughout the world, including in America. Barruel asserted that the Illuminati were a manifestation of Jacobinism, a radical and anticlerical faction in France that fomented the revolution. He lamented that these Jacobins taught “that all men were equal and free! In the name of their equality and disorganizing 11.

Robison revealed that these documents proved the Illuminati planned “a project for a sisterhood,” and that the order believed that this female lodge “will be of great service, and procure us both much information and money, and will suit charmingly the taste of many of our truest members, who are lovers of the sex.”19 These lodges would consist of “two classes, the virtuous and the freer hearted (i.e. those who fly out of the common track of prudish manners); they must not know each other, and must be under the direction of men, but without knowing it. Proper books must be put into their hands, and such as teach them how to indulge their passions in secret.”20 Robison’s and Barruel’s books were published in the United States during the so-called “Quasi War” (1798–1800) with France, which helped give their theories traction in America.21 George Washington (1732–1799) “watched with dismay what he believed was the growing interference of the French government in American politics,” and asserted that “the Republican party had become ‘the French Party’” and that it was “‘the curse of this country,’ threatening the stability and independence of the United States.”22 He cautioned during his farewell address that “all obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and associations, under whatever plausible character, with the real design to direct, control, counteract, or awe, the regular deliberations or actions of the constituted authorities, are 18. Barruel denounced Jacobinism, which was among the most radical groups in the French\n\nRevolution. It referred to a French Catholic religious order, the Jacobins, in whose convent the radical French Revolutionaries used to hold their meetings, and not to Scottish Jacobites who attempted to restore the Jacobite dynasty to the throne of Scotland (or England) and were members of French Masonic lodges. 19.

Robert Clifford and published in London in 1798. See Abbé Augustin Barruel, Memoirs Illustrating the History of Jacobinism (London: T. Burton, 1798). The first American, and apparently only multivolume, edition of Barruel was published in 1799. A one-volume abridged edition was published as Abbé Augustin Barruel, The Anti-Christian and Anti-­ Social Conspiracy (Lancaster, PA: Joseph Ehren­fried, 1812). There were also contemporary newspaper accounts mentioning these works. 22. Gordon S.

During this crisis Congress enlarged the regular army, established an embargo on trade with France, and abrogated all treaties. John Adams (1735–1826) appointed Washington as “Lieutenant General and commander in Chief ” of the United States military forces and established a navy department to prepare the country for war.24 In the midst of these events, Adams designated May 9, 1798, as a day for fasting and prayer and on that day Reverend Jedediah Morse (1761–1826), a fire-breathing Congregational minister in Charlestown, Massachusetts, delivered a sermon at New North Church in Boston in which he warned his congregation that the Illuminati were a real and continuing threat to the social and religious fabric of the new nation. Although Morse did not connect the Illuminati with Freemasons during this sermon, he eventually did in the published version. He alleged that the Illuminati were “a vile and pestiferous scion grafted on the stock of simple Masonry” and they had employed Masons as “secret conductors of their poisonous principles.” In another sermon later that year, he tied the Illuminati threat to the United States conflict with France.25 23. See Worthington Chauncey Ford, ed., The Writings of George Washington (New York:\n\nG. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1893), 19: 119–20. Despite this explanation, some seceding Masons insisted that Washington was a seceding Mason and that at least two Masonic congressmen (Andrew Jackson and Edward Livingston) voted against giving him thanks after his second term as president.

Fenn, 1837); and Freemasonry on Trial: Masonic Attempt to Prevent by Law Public Initiations (Chicago: Ezra A. Cook & Co., 1893). The New England Anti-­Masonic Almanac (1831) included three letters the editors claim demonstrate that Washington agreed that both Jacobinism and the Illuminati had spread into the United States.

Jedediah Morse, A Sermon, Delivered at the New North Church in Boston (Boston, 1798). When Morse published a sermon he delivered on Thanksgiving in Charlestown, Massachusetts, he included an appendix that correlated developments in the dispute between the United States and France with the continuing danger imposed by the Illuminati. See Morse,\n\nAmerican Freemasonry 35\n\nMorse delivered another sermon on the national day of fast in April 1799 in which he charged that “it has long been suspected that secret societies . . . subversive of our religion and government, existed somewhere in this country” and that several societies of Illuminati had been present in the United States since 1786.26 He claimed in tabloid style that there were “no less than seventeen hundred of these Illuminati among us ...in concert, systematically conducting the plan of revolutionizing this country” and published lists of members in America (who were Masons initiated into the “high degrees” that were imported from France) including their ages, residences, and occupations.27 He concluded that “these societies have presumptuously assumed the forms of Masonry; but they are not of the order of true and good Masons. They are imposters.”28 During the same year John Cosens Ogden (1751–1800), an Episcopal clergyman, wrote a pamphlet in which he asserted that the real Illuminati in America were New England clergymen (Congregationalists, Methodists, and Baptists) and Federalists, that Protestant clergy in Connecticut, led by Timothy Dwight, were attempting to control American society, and that “diligent attention is needful. If this is neglected, our families, religion and country will be destroyed by the Illuminati.”29 The growing acceptance of Enlightenment ideas, the disestablishment of traditional Puritan institutions, the perception that secularism was eroding established religion, as well as the tendency of many churchmen to see signs of an approaching millennium, created a favorable environment among America’s religious establishment for Robinson’s and Barruel’s conspiracy theories. During this war of words, Congregationalists, Methodists, and Baptists who had joined the Craft and were aligned with the Republicans denied that Freemasonry was connected with any conspiracy or that it had deviated from its original religious orientation.
