HE SHARED, “FOR ANY YOUNG COACHES MY BEST ADVICE IS TO WORK, LEARN, LISTEN, AND KEEP GROWING. OFTEN WE WORRY ABOUT SO MANY OTHER THINGS AND I THINK IN DOING THAT OFTEN YOUNG COACHES LOSE SIGHT OF THE OPPORTUNITY SET FORTH IN FRONT OF THEM. IN FOCUSING ON THINGS LIKE MONEY, TITLE, OR ROLE. INSTEAD FOCUS ON BEING PRESENT, DOING YOUR JOB, AND FINDING AS MANY WAYS AS POSSIBLE TO BE AS USEFUL AND PURPOSEFUL AS POSSIBLE.”\n\nThis website uses cookies so that we can provide you with the best user experience possible.
